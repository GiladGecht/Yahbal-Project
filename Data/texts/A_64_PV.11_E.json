(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 9.05 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n The President: I now call on Her Excellency \r\nMs. Antonella Mularoni, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof the Republic of San Marino. \r\n Ms. Mularoni (San Marino): Mr. President, I \r\nwish to congratulate you on your election as the head \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session and \r\nto assure you that the delegation of the Republic of San \r\nMarino will do its utmost in collaborating with you \r\nthroughout the session. \r\n In my first speech before this Assembly as \r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of San \r\nMarino, I would like to express my most sincere thanks \r\nto the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon, for guiding this Organization with great \r\nenergy and extraordinary dedication. I wish to mention \r\nhis admirable commitment in the area of reform and \r\nhis constant and important involvement in world \r\naffairs. \r\n The United Nations reform process is fundamental \r\nto ensuring future world stability and must remain a \r\npriority in our efforts, not only because we have the \r\nduty to guarantee that the Organization and all its \r\nactivities are fully effective, but in particular in order \r\nto preserve its primary and essential value. We cannot \r\nafford to witness a decentralization of the substantial \r\nrole of the United Nations caused by the impossibility \r\nof reaching agreement on measures to be implemented \r\nfor the improvement of its functioning.  \r\n Moreover, I would like to express the \r\nappreciation of San Marino for the work accomplished \r\nin the General Assembly with the contribution of all \r\nStates Members of the United Nations, as well as for \r\nthe attention paid to particularly relevant issues, such \r\nas the world economic and financial crisis, climate \r\nchange and the global food crisis. \r\n The Republic of San Marino supports the process \r\nof the revitalization of the General Assembly. That \r\nprocess is a political reform necessary to reaffirm the \r\nAssembly’s role as the most representative body of the \r\nUnited Nations, as well as the role and leadership of its \r\nPresident. San Marino believes that the reform should \r\nmake the activities of the General Assembly more \r\nefficient and effective, improve its relations with the \r\nother main United Nations bodies to avoid duplication \r\nof work and aim at the effective implementation of its \r\nresolutions. \r\n The Security Council reform process, which the \r\nRepublic of San Marino has been following with \r\ncommitment and interest since the beginning, is also \r\nvery important. We are grateful to the Afghan Chair for \r\nthe important activity carried out and for the way in \r\nwhich it has presided over the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations aimed at reaching the widest possible \r\npolitical agreement on Security Council reforms. \r\n San Marino believes that the aims of the reform \r\nshould be to make the Security Council more \r\ndemocratic, transparent, efficient, accountable and \r\nA/64/PV.11  \r\n \r\n09-52598 2 \r\n \r\nrepresentative, to restore the balance between the \r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly, and to \r\nenhance its cooperation with the Secretariat. It is \r\nimportant that this process allow for the development \r\nof a sense of belonging to the Security Council among \r\nall Member States, thus avoiding the risk that it could \r\nbe perceived as an isolated body within the United \r\nNations. Moreover, the reform should take into \r\nconsideration the legitimate interest of all States, big \r\nand small, in being elected to the Security Council. \r\n San Marino participates with commitment and \r\ninterest in the intergovernmental negotiations on the \r\nreform of the Security Council and regrets that, to date, \r\nno reasonable compromise has been reached to make it \r\nmore representative, democratic and possibly less \r\nparalyzed by cross-vetoes concerning fundamental \r\nissues. \r\n Mr. Acharya (Nepal), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n The reforms of the General Assembly and the \r\nSecurity Council are encompassed in a wider process \r\nof transformation and strengthening of the role of the \r\nUnited Nations within the global governance system. \r\nSan Marino believes that the United Nations plays and \r\nmust continue to play a pivotal role in managing the \r\nglobal governance system and that the United Nations \r\nreform process must be aimed at reaching this \r\nobjective. \r\n Today’s world is characterized by marked \r\ndifferences in terms of power, wealth, income and \r\nsocial well-being among nations and peoples, and \r\nwithin individual nations. Unfortunately, the world is \r\nbeset by numerous ethnic and interreligious conflicts, \r\nwhich are sometimes fuelled by economic and \r\ngeopolitical factors originating outside the area of the \r\nconflict. Moreover, global warming, which is also a \r\nconsequence of indiscriminate energy consumption in \r\ndeveloped and developing countries, is one of the \r\nmajor causes of disasters and is leading, inter alia, to a \r\nreduction in agricultural yields in tropical and \r\nsubtropical countries. Furthermore, this year in \r\nparticular the world economy has undergone one of the \r\nmost devastating financial crises in history, whose \r\nconsequences are clear to everyone. \r\n These challenges can be faced only through \r\nglobal and coordinated action, and the United Nations \r\nhas the responsibility and the duty to be at the centre of \r\nthis process. Only by tapping into the rich and varied \r\ncultures and traditions represented by the United \r\nNations is it possible to manage the global governance \r\nsystem in such a way as to achieve sustainable human \r\ndevelopment. That the United Nations might relinquish \r\nits role as leader of the global governance system in \r\nfavour of other bodies would be a defeat for all. \r\n Unfortunately, the widespread poverty that affects \r\nsuch a large percentage of the global population, \r\ncausing hunger, disease and underdevelopment, is one \r\nof the most endemic problems faced by States. Despite \r\nthe efforts made and the commitments undertaken at a \r\nglobal level, poverty continues to plague the whole \r\nplanet. \r\n San Marino values the efforts and success of the \r\nFood and Agriculture Organization (FAO) over the last \r\n60 years and is proud to host Jacques Diouf, FAO \r\nDirector-General, as the official speaker at the \r\ninvestiture ceremony of the new Captains-Regent, the \r\nheads of State of the Republic of San Marino, which \r\nwill take place on 1 October 2009. \r\n San Marino endorses the Millennium Development \r\nGoals — which have unfortunately become more \r\ndifficult to achieve because of the crisis we are \r\ncurrently facing — and believes we must continue in \r\nour commitment. \r\n The strengthening of multilateralism — included \r\nby the Assembly President in the theme proposed for \r\nthis general debate, namely “Effective responses to \r\nglobal crises: strengthening multilateralism and \r\ndialogue among civilizations for international peace, \r\nsecurity and development” — is, in my opinion, a \r\ncentral element. In fact, international organizations, \r\nand the United Nations in the first instance, promote \r\nthe affirmation of democracy, rule of law, freedoms \r\nand human rights as a condition for economic and \r\nsocial development, cultural growth and education. \r\n The current world economic and financial crisis \r\nis the greatest global disaster since the very birth of the \r\nUnited Nations, all the more so because it has added to \r\na severe food crisis that has affected many regions of \r\nthe world. As this crisis concerns all countries and \r\nregions indiscriminately, it is now one of the major \r\nchallenges our Organization has to face. \r\n The Republic of San Marino, as a small State, \r\nattaches great importance to the role of the General \r\nAssembly in the lives of our nations. It has welcomed \r\nthe high-level Conference on the World Financial and \r\n A/64/PV.11\r\n \r\n3 09-52598 \r\n \r\nEconomic Crisis and has supported its outcome \r\ndocument (resolution 63/303, annex), which is the \r\nresult of long and complex negotiations. However, I \r\nnote with regret that the uncertainty in the preparation \r\nof the Conference and the difficulties encountered in \r\ndrafting the final document discouraged the \r\nparticipation of many world leaders, whose presence \r\ncould have made that United Nations conference an \r\nhistoric event. \r\n The task of the United Nations is to find, through \r\ncoordinated and global action, the right methods to \r\nmitigate the impact of the crisis and to achieve \r\nsustainable economic growth and development, taking \r\ninto account the negative effects of the crisis on the \r\nattainment of the Millennium Development Goals. \r\n Climate change has become a central issue on the \r\nUnited Nations agenda in the last three years, thanks to \r\nthe commitment and efforts undertaken by the \r\nSecretary-General in this regard. Climate change, \r\nwhich in the 1990s was already among the main \r\nenvironmental concerns, has now become an absolute \r\npriority on the political agenda of all States, including \r\nthe smallest ones like our Republic. The deep changes \r\ncaused by human intervention in the energy dynamics \r\nof the climate system are indeed the elements of this \r\nconcern for the present and immediate future. \r\nTherefore, urgent and significant changes in social and \r\neconomic development patterns cannot be further \r\npostponed. \r\n San Marino has recently submitted its first \r\nnational communication in accordance with the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change. \r\nThat communication represents the beginning of a \r\nprocess, first of all of a social and cultural nature, \r\naimed at making all citizens of our country aware of \r\nthe need to face climate changes and effectively \r\ncommit to reducing as much as possible the impact of \r\nthese changes. \r\n Among the most serious challenges we have to \r\nface at national and international levels, terrorism in all \r\nits forms and manifestations is of primary importance. \r\nThe Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy adopted by the \r\nGeneral Assembly in 2006 represents a fundamental \r\ninitiative, because for the first time all Member States \r\nagreed to a common strategic and operational approach \r\nto counter terrorism. Such a strategy laid the \r\nfoundations for a coordinated response to this \r\nemergency by envisaging preventive measures and the \r\nstrengthening of the role of the United Nations in the \r\nfight against terrorism. It also recognizes that counter-\r\nterrorism measures and the protection of human rights \r\nare not conflicting goals; on the contrary, they are \r\ncomplementary and mutually reinforcing. \r\n However, an effective response to terrorism must \r\nalso be based on education in order to foster \r\nunderstanding and respect for each other as a sine qua \r\nnon condition for achieving justice and peace. Indeed, \r\nhatred, lack of understanding and injustice provide \r\nbreeding grounds for terrorist groups and organizations \r\nto recruit new members. \r\n My country focuses great attention, both at the \r\nnational and international levels, to the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights, with special attention paid \r\nto those of the weakest and most vulnerable groups. I \r\nam pleased to recall that this year we celebrate the \r\ntwentieth anniversary of the adoption of the United \r\nNations Convention on the Rights of the Child, a \r\nfundamental instrument that has been ratified by a \r\nlarge number of States. However, we must not forget \r\nthat still today 9.2 million children under the age of \r\nfive die every year from largely preventable causes and \r\nmore than 100 million school-age children do not have \r\naccess to education. Furthermore, many children are \r\nrobbed of their childhood, are victims of sexual \r\nviolence, are used by armies or armed groups as \r\nsoldiers or sold as sexual slaves. \r\n San Marino applauds and supports the United \r\nNations and UNICEF for the efforts undertaken \r\nworldwide in order to improve the life of these \r\nchildren. We also actively endorse the United Nations \r\ncommitment to women’s rights. \r\n Finally, the protection of human rights is strictly \r\nconnected to the need to guarantee every human being \r\nand every population the possibility of living in peace \r\nand justice. It is therefore necessary to give new \r\nmomentum to the disarmament process. An important \r\nstep was taken last year in this regard by adopting the \r\nConvention on Cluster Munitions, an instrument that \r\nwill prove essential to protecting affected populations \r\nfrom those weapons, which have devastating effects on \r\ncivilians. The Republic of San Marino attaches great \r\nimportance to this Convention, which is focused on \r\nhuman dignity and the interests of victims, and hopes \r\nthat it will promptly enter into force. We therefore call \r\nupon the States that have not yet ratified it to do so as \r\nsoon as possible. \r\nA/64/PV.11  \r\n \r\n09-52598 4 \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Marco Hausiku, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Republic of Namibia. \r\n Mr. Hausiku (Namibia): I would like to \r\ncongratulate the President on his unanimous election to \r\npreside over the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth \r\nsession. We are confident that he will discharge the \r\nresponsibilities of that office with honour and dignity, \r\ngiven his track record and experience. I wish to assure \r\nhim of Namibia’s support and cooperation to ensure \r\nthat his tenure in office is crowned with success. In the \r\nsame vein, I wish to commend His Excellency \r\nMr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann for the able manner \r\nin which he presided over the Assembly at its sixty-\r\nthird session. I equally wish to express our sincere \r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General, His Excellency \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon, for his tireless efforts in leading our \r\nOrganization to respond effectively to the large number \r\nof challenges and pressing issues facing humanity. \r\n We are meeting today at a very challenging time. \r\nThe impact of the world financial and economic crisis \r\non our countries and economies is very severe. This \r\ncrisis is a major concern that requires concerted efforts \r\nto search for effective methods of coping with it, in \r\norder to mitigate its impact and to achieve sustainable \r\ngrowth and development. This crisis is taking its toll \r\non every aspect of our development and social life. The \r\nprogress that we made in the fight against poverty, \r\nhunger and diseases, as well as in achieving the \r\ninternationally agreed development goals, including \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), is \r\nthreatened. \r\n The financial crisis came in the middle of the \r\nfood and energy crisis. Skyrocketing prices of basic \r\nfoodstuffs, though said to have stabilized now, have \r\nleft many households unable to put food on the table. \r\nNet food importing countries like Namibia had to \r\ndivert resources from development to emergency relief, \r\nwhile importing high-priced food destabilized our \r\nbalance of payments and State revenues. \r\n The situation was also worsened by high fuel \r\nprices. Oil-importing developing countries like ours \r\nhave been negatively affected by ever-increasing oil \r\nprices, which have also led to price increases in other \r\nsectors, as suppliers of goods and services raise prices \r\nto make up for production and transportation costs.  \r\n The financial and economic crisis, coupled with \r\nthe food and energy crisis, has plunged the world into a \r\nglobal recession. The combination of these crises with \r\nclimate change and its adverse impact on sustainable \r\ndevelopment is cause for great concern. Namibia, like \r\nmany other developing countries, is an insignificant \r\ncontributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Yet our \r\ncountry is one of the most vulnerable to the effects of \r\nclimate change. I therefore call upon major emitters to \r\nnot only make drastic reductions in their greenhouse \r\ngas emissions, but also to use technology and financial \r\nresources to support the efforts of developing countries \r\nto adapt to the adverse effects of climate change. The \r\nGovernment of the Republic of Namibia fully supports \r\nthe efforts of the Secretary-General to mobilize \r\npolitical will to ensure a good and legally binding \r\nagreement on climate change in Copenhagen this \r\nDecember. \r\n Namibia is one of the countries with the highest \r\nsocio-economic inequality in the world because of its \r\ncolonial past. Nevertheless, the country has made \r\nprogress in the provision of health, education and other \r\ncritical services for the majority of the population, and \r\nwe are on course to meet a number of the MDGs. \r\n However, we face severe difficulties in \r\nresponding to the combination of the devastating \r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic, high levels of food insecurity \r\nand poverty. I once again call upon the international \r\ncommunity to increase support to our national \r\nprogrammes for sustainable economic and social \r\ndevelopment through measures such as market access \r\nand access to financial resources in the form of \r\nconcessional loans and foreign direct investment flows. \r\n The need for a strong and effective United \r\nNations cannot be overemphasized. The process for the \r\nreform of the Organization should be expedited in \r\norder to deliver on its promises in the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security, respect for human \r\nrights, social and economic development and the \r\nprotection of the environment. \r\n There is an urgent need to reform the Security \r\nCouncil to make it more representative, democratic and \r\naccountable. Is it not an anomaly, and unjust, that \r\nAfrica remains the only region without permanent \r\nrepresentation on the Security Council? This does not \r\nreflect the continent’s vital role in the maintenance of \r\nglobal peace and security. The need for Africa to be \r\nequitably represented on the Council, with all the \r\nprivileges associated with membership, remains our \r\npriority. In this regard, Namibia stands by the common \r\n A/64/PV.11\r\n \r\n5 09-52598 \r\n \r\nAfrican position on the reform of the United Nations as \r\narticulated in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte \r\nDeclaration. \r\n Namibia welcomes the joint communiqué on \r\nstrengthening the capacity of the African Union (AU) \r\nin peacekeeping operations, as agreed to by the United \r\nNations Security Council and the African Union Peace \r\nand Security Council, as a step in the right direction. \r\nThere is a need for more structured and formalized \r\ncooperation between the two bodies on issues of peace \r\nand security in Africa. Such cooperation should also \r\ninclude the areas of financing, logistics, transfer of \r\ntechnology and training. Furthermore, there is a need \r\nfor the United Nations to support the AU position of \r\nprinciple on not recognizing Governments that come to \r\npower through military coups. Namibia calls upon the \r\nGeneral Assembly to urgently pass a resolution \r\nprohibiting the participation of such Governments in \r\nthe activities of all United Nations institutions. \r\n The right of all people to self-determination is a \r\nfundamental human right, which is enshrined in the \r\nUnited Nations Charter. It is deplorable that almost \r\n10 years into the twenty-first century colonialism is \r\nstill an issue with which this Organization has to deal. \r\n My delegation has raised its voice repeatedly in \r\nthis Assembly, calling for the realization of the \r\ninalienable rights of the people of Western Sahara to \r\nself-determination. The international community has an \r\nobligation to assist the people of Western Sahara in \r\ntheir quest for freedom and independence. Namibia \r\ntherefore calls for the immediate and unconditional \r\nimplementation of the United Nations Settlement Plan \r\nfor Western Sahara and of all resolutions of the \r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly, with the \r\naim of holding a free and fair referendum in Western \r\nSahara. \r\n Similarly, Namibia is deeply concerned about the \r\ncontinuing suffering of the people of Palestine under \r\nIsraeli occupation. We wish to reaffirm our full and \r\nunequivocal support for the inalienable rights of the \r\npeople of Palestine to self-determination, including the \r\nreturn to their land. I wish to again call upon the \r\nparties to resume the peace process on the basis of all \r\nrelevant United Nations resolutions. \r\n My delegation wishes to reiterate its long-held \r\nposition on the unilateral economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial blockade imposed against Cuba. We believe \r\nthat the blockade constitutes a violation of international \r\nlaw and the rights of the people of Cuba. Its \r\nextraterritorial nature impedes free trade and economic \r\ndevelopment. Furthermore, it undermines the efforts of \r\nthe international community to attain the \r\ninternationally agreed development goals, as it affects \r\nthat country’s economy adversely and subjects its \r\npeople to untold pain and suffering.  \r\n We urge the Government of the United States of \r\nAmerica to heed the call of the international \r\ncommunity and to implement the resolutions of the \r\nGeneral Assembly that call for an end to the blockade. \r\nNamibia wishes to reaffirm its solidarity with and \r\nsupport of Cuba’s call for the immediate release of the \r\nfive Cuban nationals detained in the United States of \r\nAmerica. \r\n I would like to seize this opportunity to express \r\nour deep appreciation to the Governments and \r\ninternational organizations that responded in a timely \r\nmanner to our appeal for support and assistance \r\nfollowing the devastating floods that my country has \r\nexperienced during the past two years. That assistance \r\nhas greatly contributed to the alleviation of the \r\nsuffering of those in the affected areas. \r\n Finally, I wish to call upon all States Members of \r\nthe United Nations, in keeping with their \r\nresponsibilities and obligations under the United \r\nNations Charter, to fully address the challenges facing \r\nhumankind today in order to make the world a better \r\nplace for all and where we can all live together in \r\npeace, security and true justice. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. José Antonio García Belaunde, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Peru. \r\n Mr. García Belaunde (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nI wish first of all to congratulate Mr. Ali Abdussalam \r\nTreki on his election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-fourth session. Knowing his \r\nbroad experience in the United Nations and his \r\ndedication to dialogue and consensus, I assure him that \r\nPeru will constructively support his initiatives. \r\n The global outlook is extremely complex and full \r\nof great contradictions. We face the deepest economic \r\nand financial international crisis that our generation \r\nhas experienced and which once again proves that the \r\nborders in a global world are purely cartographic and \r\nthat the symbol of our times remains interdependency. \r\nThe economic and financial crisis has stymied world \r\nA/64/PV.11  \r\n \r\n09-52598 6 \r\n \r\ngrowth and, above all, exposed the weaknesses that \r\ncaused the market to malfunction. As rarely in recent \r\nhistory, the international community has mobilized \r\nhuge resources and political capital to avoid \r\nunprecedented economic collapse. A significant share \r\nof those resources must support the developing \r\ncountries, which certainly did not cause the crisis but \r\nare the most affected by it. \r\n It is regrettable that the convergence of wills and \r\ninterests with regard to the crisis is, in turn, not \r\napparent with equal resolve in the endeavour to achieve \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals by 2015 and to \r\nfirmly address the threats that endanger freedom, \r\ndemocracy and, ultimately, regional and global \r\nstability. \r\n In that context, allow me to point out that one \r\ncrucial problem we face is the huge sums spent on \r\narms acquisitions. How can we explain to our peoples \r\nthat, in the midst of one of the worst global economic \r\nrecessions and with more than 1 billion people living in \r\nextreme poverty throughout the world, countries can \r\ncommit over $1,464 billion to military expenditure in \r\n2008, and that, while economies contract, arms \r\npurchases grow in real terms every year? \r\n Recently, the President of Peru, Mr. Alan García, \r\nin a communication to South America’s ministers for \r\nforeign affairs and of defence that is being circulated \r\nas a document of this General Assembly (A/64/367), \r\nseriously questioned that state of affairs in the region \r\nand asked why, in the five years since the \r\nestablishment of the Union of South American Nations, \r\nour countries have allocated for military spending a \r\ntotal of $156 billion, but in addition have acquired \r\napproximately $23 billion more in new weapons, \r\ncannons, aircraft and ships. That figure could reach \r\n$38 billion this year. The President appealed for that \r\nabsurdity to stop if conditions are created for a \r\nstrengthening of security and confidence in the region. \r\n To that end, on this occasion I affirm Peru’s \r\nproposal that a friendship and non-aggression pact be \r\nconcluded to guarantee the commitments to \r\nstrengthening a zone of peace in South America, and to \r\nachieve the gradual reduction of arms purchases and \r\nthe future establishment of a peace and interposition \r\nforce to avert any conflict in the region. The final \r\nobjective would be to create a regional collective \r\nsecurity system that complements and is upheld by the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, enabling all our \r\ncountries to end the arms race in which South America, \r\na region that is otherwise demonstrating great maturity \r\nand respect for international law in the handling of its \r\ndisputes, seems to be engaged for no discernible \r\nreason. Our proposal will certainly require greater \r\nstudy and consideration in the light of experiences in \r\nother parts of the world. \r\n A second transnational threat that is not receiving \r\ndue attention is drug trafficking and its dangerous link \r\nto terrorism and violence in general, the consequences \r\nof which affect not only the security and rights of \r\nmillions of people, but also the environment. We are \r\npaying an enormous price through our inaction \r\nconcerning a problem that causes millions of deaths a \r\nyear and tremendous material losses. \r\n At the global level, the traffic in drugs brings in \r\naround $500 billion a year, equivalent to 8 per cent of \r\nglobal trade, while, according to data of the United \r\nNations Office on Drugs and Crime, their use affects \r\nover 200 million people, in particular young people, \r\nthroughout the world. \r\n According to the 2008 report of the International \r\nNarcotics Control Board, it is clear that South \r\nAmerica’s narcotics trafficking networks collaborate \r\nwith one another in their illicit activities, especially \r\nmoney-laundering, and recruit specialists at the highest \r\ntechnical level. It is therefore a matter of urgency that \r\ncombating narcotics trafficking once more be given top \r\npriority on the world agenda and in cooperation \r\nbetween developed countries, pursuant to the principle \r\nof shared responsibility. \r\n We must respond jointly to halt the advance of \r\nnarcotics trafficking and related criminal activities, \r\nsuch as trafficking in arms or people, the destruction of \r\nnature, corruption and terrorism. Legislation concerning \r\nillicit crops and their interdiction and eradication should \r\nbe complemented by prevention and rehabilitation \r\nprogrammes aimed at comprehensive, alternative and \r\nsustainable development. To that end, the concerted \r\nefforts of all international actors are essential under the \r\nprinciples of cooperation and, above all, shared \r\nresponsibility. \r\n In Peru, drug traffickers are working with the \r\nremnants of terrorist groups. This situation \r\nexponentially increases the level of violence among \r\nboth criminal groups, and if we do not solve the \r\nproblem now, we may find ourselves in a situation of \r\nunprecedented consequences in the future. Illicit coca \r\n A/64/PV.11\r\n \r\n7 09-52598 \r\n \r\nproduction is a process of utmost destructiveness to the \r\nenvironment. Three hectares of forest have to be \r\ndestroyed to obtain one hectare of coca. This is causing \r\nirreparable damage in the Peruvian Amazon forest; the \r\nlogging and burning of trees to clear land for illegal \r\ncrops erodes the soil and has resulted in the \r\ndeforestation of 2.5 million hectares of Amazon forest, \r\na leading contribution to global warming. \r\n For all these reasons, the Government of Peru has \r\ndevoted special attention to the problem in terms of \r\nfinancial and human resources. But the results have \r\noften left us feeling that this is a solitary struggle with \r\na problem for which the international community, and \r\nespecially the countries that consume the bulk of \r\nnarcotic drugs, do not have adequate or rapid solutions. \r\nPeru, which dedicates more than $600 million a year to \r\nfighting an illicit industry with a turnover of \r\n$22 billion, cannot fight the illicit production of drugs \r\nalone or hope for any long-term success without the \r\nfirm, supportive cooperation of the international \r\ncommunity and, particularly, of the consuming \r\ncountries, based on the established principle of shared \r\nresponsibility. \r\n Real cooperation has diminished alarmingly since \r\n2002. The largest contributor to Peru reduced its \r\ncontribution from $140 million to $128 million in 2003 \r\nand to $116 million in 2004. This year, the total will be \r\n$70 million and next year, $57 million. Peru therefore \r\nconsiders it essential for the United Nations Office on \r\nDrugs and Crime to draft a report providing updated \r\nfigures for the global resources that the international \r\ncommunity allocates to combating the illegal narcotics \r\ntrade, the donor sources and specific ongoing projects, \r\nas well as identifying key programmes to improve \r\ncooperation with the countries most affected by illegal \r\ndrug production. Such precise, reliable and \r\ninternationally comparable information would dispel \r\nmany myths concerning the efforts and joint action that \r\nwe should undertake without delay, and would be a \r\npractical starting point from which to better coordinate \r\nthe efforts of contributing States, international \r\norganizations and financial institutions with those \r\nStates most affected by illegal narcotics production and \r\ntrafficking, in order to strengthen them in this fight. We \r\nhope that this task can be accomplished without delay, \r\nsince, I repeat, international action in this area must not \r\nbe postponed. \r\n Another sensitive issue that has been the subject \r\nof special debate is that of climate change and the \r\npreservation of the environment in general. Peru is \r\nsuffering dramatically from the effects of global \r\nwarming, seen in the accelerated retreat of its tropical \r\nglaciers and its ensuing difficulties in adequately \r\nmeeting the water needs of its population. Peru \r\nconsiders it essential to establish concrete goals for \r\ntechnological cooperation and transfer, as well as the \r\ncreation of financial assistance funds for projects \r\naimed at directly combating the effects of climate \r\nchange in the countries most affected by it. Faced with \r\nthe urgent need to confront the adverse effects of \r\nclimate change, Peru supports the ongoing establishment \r\nof binding international commitments by the countries \r\nthat created this problem, and hopes that at the \r\nfifteenth International Conference on Climate Change, \r\nto be held in Copenhagen in December, all States will \r\nbe willing to adopt them. \r\n In this regard, Peru reiterates its proposal that a \r\nfinancial mechanism be established towards the \r\ncreation of a global fund to support measures aimed at \r\nmitigating and adapting to the effects of climate \r\nchange in developing countries. This would involve a \r\nduty of $0.50 on every barrel of oil, inasmuch as the \r\nfuel bears a responsibility at every stage in its chain of \r\nproduction, from extraction through refining to its \r\nuses, direct and indirect. Peru also proposes that \r\ncomprehensive programmes of adaptation to climate \r\nchange be established. Such programmes, which could \r\nbe financed by the Global Environment Facility or the \r\nWorld Bank, would identify a comprehensive approach \r\nto sectoral adaptation and emphasize strategies to \r\nreduce the occurrence of disasters and to protect the \r\nhealth and food security of affected populations, \r\neconomic infrastructure and biodiversity. \r\n Finally, we wish to raise an issue of particular \r\ninterest to Peru and developing countries in general — \r\nthe situation of migrants. Peru is an active promoter of \r\nthe defence of the human rights of migrants and their \r\nfamilies, and of the sharing of responsibility for \r\naddressing this phenomenon by their countries of \r\norigin and host countries. We endorse the principle that \r\nmigration is a factor for development and has \r\nundeniably been so throughout human history. It has \r\nenriched the culture and social life of nations, and \r\nallowed us to come into contact with the contributions, \r\ndiscoveries and developments that have gradually \r\nshaped our modern society.  \r\n It is therefore essential that we be aware that \r\nwhat migrants contribute to their host countries today, \r\nA/64/PV.11  \r\n \r\n09-52598 8 \r\n \r\nand what they can contribute in the future, will be in \r\nlarge measure the backbone of those societies. That is \r\nwhy xenophobic and discriminatory pressures must be \r\navoided, since they do nothing but delay the inevitable \r\nintegration of the world and the human race. \r\n In Latin America, we are living through a crucial \r\ntime in the consolidation of democracy and the \r\npromotion of the social and political rights of our \r\npeoples. Peru therefore expresses its deep concern over \r\nthe recent events in the sister country of Honduras, \r\nwhere the democratic system has been abruptly \r\ninterrupted. The actions taken against Brazil’s embassy \r\nin Honduras should be repudiated and should cease \r\nimmediately, pursuant to Honduras’s legal traditions as \r\na country that respects its international obligations, \r\nparticularly the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic \r\nRelations. \r\n We call for a dialogue aimed at re-establishing \r\ndemocracy in Honduras. All Honduran political groups \r\nshould take advantage of the return of President \r\nManuel Zelaya to Tegucigalpa to establish a \r\nGovernment of unity and national reconciliation as \r\noutlined in the San José agreement, which, through \r\nentirely peaceful means, will allow the country to \r\nmove forward with free, democratic and transparent \r\nelections that will guarantee the election of a \r\nGovernment that respects its Constitution and promotes \r\nnational integration and solidarity for each and every \r\nHonduran citizen. \r\n At a time when communications and technology \r\nbring us closer together than ever before, we must also \r\nunderstand that our problems and responsibilities \r\nshould also bring us closer together and that challenges \r\nto one State are challenges to all. This Assembly \r\ntherefore remains the most appropriate forum in which \r\nto discuss global and local challenges, which are now \r\nidentical and of concern to us all, and should also — \r\nwhy not? — inspire us all with hope. \r\n \r\n  Address by General Thein Sein, Prime Minister \r\nof the Union of Myanmar \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Union of \r\nMyanmar. \r\n General Thein Sein, Prime Minister of the Union \r\nof Myanmar, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency General Thein Sein, Prime \r\nMinister of the Union of Myanmar, and inviting him to \r\naddress the General Assembly. \r\n General Thein Sein (Myanmar) (spoke in \r\nMyanmar; English text provided by the delegation): I \r\nwould like to extend our warm congratulations to \r\nMr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his well-deserved election \r\nas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth \r\nsession. I would also like to pay a special tribute to \r\nMr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann for his able leadership \r\nof the sixty-third session of the General Assembly. \r\n The global financial and economic crisis that \r\nbegan last year is showing tentative signs of abating. \r\nHowever, many countries large and small still face \r\ndaunting challenges. The crisis originated in the \r\ndeveloped countries, but the developing countries have \r\nbeen the hardest hit. The nascent economic recovery \r\nhas yet to begin to lift the low-income countries from \r\nthe trough. \r\n It is commendable that the developed countries \r\nhave played a leading role in addressing the crisis. The \r\nviews of the developing countries should also be taken \r\ninto consideration, together with those of the members \r\nof the Group of Eight and the Group of Twenty. \r\nMeasures that could have adverse effects on the \r\neconomic growth of developing countries must be \r\navoided. The developing countries have worked long \r\nand hard to combat poverty and achieve favourable \r\nconditions for economic growth. Low-income countries \r\nrequire development aid beyond existing pledges of \r\nofficial development assistance (ODA) if they are to \r\nmeet the challenges posed by the global economic \r\ndownturn. The developed countries should increase \r\ntheir ODA to the developing countries. We welcome \r\nthe reaffirmation by President Hu Jintao of the \r\nPeople’s Republic of China in his statement to this \r\nAssembly that his country will increase support for \r\nother developing countries hard hit by the economic \r\nand financial crisis. \r\n Climate change is the most pressing major threat \r\nfacing our planet. It is a global challenge that requires \r\na global response. No country can be insulated from \r\nthe consequences of climate change. The rapid pace \r\nand scale of climate change requires the global \r\ncommunity to respond immediately and effectively. \r\nThe United Nations Summit on Climate Change \r\nconvened by the Secretary-General last week \r\n A/64/PV.11\r\n \r\n9 09-52598 \r\n \r\nunderlined the magnitude of the problem and the need \r\nto redouble our efforts in addressing climate change. \r\n We look forward to the Climate Change \r\nConference in Copenhagen in December. We hope that \r\nthe negotiations will be fruitful and result in a new \r\nagreement to curb greenhouse gas emissions, to go into \r\neffect in 2012 when the Kyoto Protocol’s first \r\ncommitment period expires. To be effective, any deal \r\nmust be comprehensive and consistent with the \r\nprinciple of common but differentiated responsibilities. \r\n The global financial and economic crisis and the \r\nclimate change crisis have compounded the problems \r\nwe have faced in recent years. These include rising \r\nfood prices, high energy prices and the spread of \r\npandemic diseases. No single country can effectively \r\novercome these problems alone. The global community \r\nmust work together to meet its common challenges. In \r\nthese trying times for our planet, multilateralism is \r\nmore important than ever. Dialogue among nations of \r\ndifferent religious and cultural backgrounds can \r\ncontribute to international peace, security and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n The United Nations is the single world \r\nOrganization dedicated to peace and development that \r\nenjoys almost universal participation. In recent years, \r\nsteps have been initiated to reform the Organization in \r\norder to make it more democratic, effective and \r\naccountable and enable it to meet the challenges of the \r\ntwenty-first century. Regrettably, progress has been \r\npainfully slow. \r\n If the United Nations is to make decisions in a \r\nmore democratic manner, it is essential that the role of \r\nthe General Assembly — in which all Member States \r\nare represented — be enhanced. Security Council \r\nreform is also important. For many years, the General \r\nAssembly has debated the matter but made little \r\nheadway. In addition to the focus on the vexed issue of \r\nenlarging the Council, we would like to see \r\nconstructive changes in its procedures and working \r\nmethods, particularly those that would make it more \r\ntransparent and accountable. \r\n The continued existence of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction, particularly nuclear weapons, poses the \r\ngreatest threat to mankind. Myanmar believes that the \r\ntotal elimination of nuclear weapons is the sole \r\nabsolute guarantee against the threat or use of those \r\nweapons. Accordingly, we have called on nuclear-\r\nweapon States to undertake a step-by-step attenuation \r\nof the nuclear threat with a view to achieving the total \r\nelimination of those weapons. \r\n We believe that, pending the total elimination of \r\nnuclear weapons, we should pursue efforts towards the \r\nconclusion of a universal, unconditional and legally \r\nbinding instrument on security assurances to \r\nnon-nuclear-weapon States. We support the \r\nestablishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones on the \r\nbasis of arrangements freely arrived at among States of \r\nthe regions concerned. Nuclear-weapon-free zones \r\nenhance global and regional security and contribute to \r\nreaching the objectives of nuclear disarmament. \r\n It is our hope that all nations of the world will \r\ncontinue to work together to eliminate nuclear weapons \r\nso that the power of the atom can be harnessed \r\nexclusively as a tool for the benefit of mankind and not \r\nas an instrument of self-destruction. At the same time, \r\nevery nation has the right to the peaceful use of nuclear \r\nenergy. Nuclear technologies have widespread \r\napplications in such areas as food, agriculture, health \r\ncare, industry and science. We welcome last week’s \r\nsummit meeting of the Security Council on nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation and disarmament and its reaffirmation \r\nthat the international nuclear non-proliferation regime \r\nshould be maintained and strengthened to ensure the \r\neffective implementation of the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. \r\n Some powerful nations have resorted to economic \r\nsanctions to pressure developing countries. Their aim \r\nis to influence the political and economic systems of \r\nthose countries without taking into account those \r\ncountries’ historical and cultural backgrounds. \r\nSanctions have no moral basis, as they not only hinder \r\nthe economic and social development of peoples, but \r\nalso interfere in matters that are essentially within the \r\ndomestic jurisdiction of the country concerned. As \r\nsanctions are indiscriminate and a form of violence \r\nper se, they cannot legitimately be regarded as a tool to \r\npromote human rights and democracy.  \r\n Sanctions are being employed as a political tool \r\nagainst Myanmar and we consider them unjust. I would \r\nlike to state that such acts must cease. Myanmar \r\npractises a market economy based on agriculture. We \r\nare self-sufficient in terms of food and able to \r\ncontribute to food security in the region. We have made \r\nconsiderable progress in improving socio-economic \r\nconditions thanks to the combined efforts of the \r\nGovernment and the people. Without the economic \r\nA/64/PV.11  \r\n \r\n09-52598 10 \r\n \r\nsanctions imposed on us, progress would be even \r\ngreater. \r\n Following Cyclone Nargis, which hit Myanmar in \r\nMay 2008, the Myanmar Government, the United \r\nNations and the Association of Southeast Nations \r\nestablished the Tripartite Core Group (TCG) to \r\nundertake relief, rehabilitation and reconstruction in \r\nthe affected areas. The success of the TCG has been \r\nduly recognized by the international community and \r\nacknowledged as an exemplary mechanism for future \r\ndisaster relief and rehabilitation.  \r\n The Post-Nargis Recovery and Preparedness Plan \r\n(PONREPP) has been established for the period 2009 \r\nto 2011. Further plans have also been adopted to \r\neffectively respond to similar natural disasters in the \r\nfuture. We will implement the projects diligently. \r\nPONREPP will require $691 million over a period of \r\nthree years. To date, only half of that amount has been \r\npledged by the international community. We have \r\ncarried out many rehabilitation activities relying on our \r\nown funds and resources. If more funds were \r\nforthcoming and donors fulfilled their pledges, the \r\nrehabilitation process would be speedier and more \r\neffective. \r\n The Myanmar Government and the people of the \r\naffected areas will always be grateful to the \r\nindividuals, organizations and the international \r\ncommunity at large that came to our assistance in our \r\nhour of need. \r\n Domestic peace and stability and the successful \r\nholding of democratic elections are essential to the \r\ndemocratization process in Myanmar. A new State \r\nConstitution was approved by 92.48 per cent of eligible \r\nvoters in a nationwide referendum held in May 2008. \r\nMultiparty general elections will be held in the coming \r\nyear. Subsequently, Parliament will be convened and a \r\nGovernment formed in accordance with the new \r\nConstitution. \r\n The country will have a bicameral legislature. \r\nThe Constitution provides for a presidential system of \r\ngovernance. It is envisaged that the President will be \r\nelected by a presidential electoral college. The State \r\nwill be composed of seven states, seven regions, five \r\nself-administered zones, and one self-administered \r\ndivision. The capital, Nay Pyi Taw, will be designated \r\nunion territory. In keeping with the State structure, the \r\nConstitution also establishes 14 State and regional \r\nlegislative bodies. \r\n The transition to democracy is proceeding. Our \r\nfocus is not on the narrow interests of individuals, \r\norganizations or parties, but on the larger interests of \r\nthe entire nation. We have urged all citizens, whether \r\nthey agree with us or not, to participate actively in the \r\nprocess without losing sight of the democratic goal. In \r\nthis way, the aspirations of the people will be fulfilled. \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n The Government is taking systematic steps to \r\nhold free and fair elections. Electoral laws will be \r\npromulgated and an election commission created so \r\nthat political parties can be formed and contest the \r\nelections. On 17 September 2009, 7,114 prisoners were \r\nreleased for good conduct. They, too, will be able to \r\nparticipate in the general elections next year in \r\naccordance with the law. \r\n The holding of a multiparty general election is a \r\nsignificant step in our transition to a peaceful, modern \r\nand developed democratic State. Democracy cannot be \r\nimposed from the outside, and a system suitable for \r\nMyanmar can be born only out of Myanmar society. It \r\nis the citizens of Myanmar who can best determine \r\ntheir own future. They can judge the merits of \r\ndemocracy and make adjustments as they see fit. The \r\ninternational community can best assist Myanmar’s \r\nemergence as a new nation, based on the principles of \r\njustice, freedom and equality enshrined in the new \r\nState Constitution, by demonstrating understanding. \r\n Global issues that require the attention of all \r\ncountries will increasingly come to the fore in the \r\nyears to come. Firm political will and commitment of \r\nall countries will be needed to overcome the \r\nchallenges. Previous speakers have emphasized the \r\nneed for collective efforts to find solutions to those \r\nproblems and challenges. I fully share their views and \r\naffirm that Myanmar will do its part. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nUnion of Myanmar for the statement he has just made. \r\n General Thein Sein, Prime Minister of the Union \r\nof Myanmar, was escorted from the rostrum. \r\n The President: I now call on Her Excellency \r\nMs. Patricia Espinosa Cantellano, Secretary of Foreign \r\nRelations of the United Mexican States. \r\n Ms. Espinosa Cantellano (Mexico) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): Since the last session of the General \r\n A/64/PV.11\r\n \r\n11 09-52598 \r\n \r\nAssembly, a number of crises have tested the \r\ncapabilities of multilateral institutions to face them \r\nfirmly and with unified purpose. The international \r\ncommunity has come to understand that only joint \r\naction in which developing countries are full \r\nparticipants can offer sustainable responses to these \r\nemergencies. Fortunately, we see some positive signs \r\nof economic growth in some places. \r\n Nevertheless, insecurity and uncertainty prevail. \r\nThe insecurity results from the persistence of armed \r\nconflicts, terrorism and transnational organized crime, \r\nwhich threaten our achievements in sustainable human \r\ndevelopment. The uncertainty is linked to the \r\nnegotiations that will lead to the United Nations \r\nClimate Change Conference in Copenhagen in \r\nDecember. Global warming is now a threat to humanity \r\nof incalculable proportions, to which we all contribute \r\nand for which we all, without exception, are \r\nresponsible. \r\n Contributing to sustainable human development \r\nrequires, first, conditions conducive to international \r\npeace and security. As President Felipe Calderón \r\npointed out in the Security Council summit (see \r\nS/PV.6191), nuclear proliferation and highly \r\ninsufficient legal access to peaceful uses for atomic \r\nenergy demand a renewed commitment to disarmament \r\nand the strengthening of the non-proliferation regime. \r\n I also echo the emphatic call, issued by global \r\ncivil society at the sixty-second Annual Conference of \r\nthe Department of Public Information for \r\nNon-Governmental Organizations, held in Mexico City \r\nthis year, that we, the Governments of the world, fulfil \r\nour responsibilities to attain our goal of a world free of \r\nnuclear weapons. \r\n The promotion and protection of human rights \r\nconstitute a universal ethical imperative and an \r\nobligation that no government can renounce. The \r\nprogress attained in this field at the national level has \r\nbeen possible thanks to my country’s close alignment \r\nwith the international system for the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights, which has proved an \r\ninvaluable tool for promoting improvements in our \r\nnational structures. \r\n It is clear that to attain full sustainable human \r\ndevelopment we must tackle poverty and inequality, \r\nfostering a development that ensures access for all \r\npeople to adequate food, health, education and \r\nhousing. \r\n In response to the health emergency that Mexico \r\nfaced some months ago with the outbreak of influenza \r\nA(H1N1), the World Health Organization gave its full \r\nsupport to the timely, energetic and responsible actions \r\nof my Government. This is proof that the United \r\nNations system is capable of mobilizing coordinated \r\naction by States and avoiding unilateral measures that \r\nare not appropriate in response to such emergencies. \r\nWe must continue to update our protocols for action. \r\n For Mexico, meeting the Millennium Development \r\nGoals is a State commitment. Our priority continues to \r\nbe the eradication of poverty. We must make the \r\nnecessary structural changes to reduce inequality and \r\nattain prosperity for all. We must implement policies \r\nthat ensure that concrete action is taken based on the \r\nMonterrey Consensus on financing for development, \r\nthat the Doha Round is successfully concluded and that \r\ncontributions by developed countries and multilateral \r\ndevelopment banks to projects in countries with low \r\ngrowth rates are increased. \r\n It is imperative to address urgent needs such as \r\nfood security in order to reduce inequality and \r\nstrengthen the capacities enjoyed by our peoples. Food \r\nsecurity is the very foundation of development. \r\nTherefore, we must ensure food security by eliminating \r\nmarket distortions, boosting production through the use \r\nof technology and improving productivity without \r\nmaking sacrifices on the environmental agenda. \r\n The recent Group of 20 Summit in Pittsburgh \r\ndemonstrated that the scale of the global financial \r\ncrisis requires a firm response, both in coordinating the \r\nmeasures taken by individual countries to mitigate \r\nimpact in areas such as unemployment and in avoiding \r\nprotectionist measures. There is still much left to do, \r\nbut it is a fact that the timely intervention by the Group \r\nof 20 allowed further resources to be channelled to the \r\ninternational financial institutions and strengthened the \r\nparticipation of developing countries in the decision-\r\nmaking bodies within those institutions. \r\n The United Nations must realize that we are \r\nwitnessing a reconfiguration of global economic \r\ngovernance, and that policies must be adjusted to this \r\nnew reality. We require an Organization that is strong, \r\neffective and efficient. The cuts that are being imposed \r\non all countries at home must also be reflected in \r\nUnited Nations system budgets. If it remains passive, \r\nalienated and conformist, our Organization risks losing \r\nA/64/PV.11  \r\n \r\n09-52598 12 \r\n \r\nits relevance as the premier universal and legitimate \r\nforum for solving the major problems of humanity. \r\n The challenges of global warming have made it \r\nclear that the absence of economic incentives is one of \r\nthe main reasons that the commitments under the \r\nKyoto Protocol and the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change have not been fulfilled. \r\nFor this reason, Mexico has proposed, in the \r\npreparatory negotiations for the Copenhagen \r\nConference, an innovative financing scheme, known as \r\nthe Green Fund, which would reward the efforts of \r\nStates that adopt policies aimed at reducing greenhouse \r\ngas emissions, without jeopardizing their development \r\ngoals. The Green Fund fully responds to the principle \r\nof common but differentiated responsibility. It is not \r\njust another financial mechanism that obeys the \r\nconventional criteria. \r\n All countries must be able to receive financing, \r\nbut the scale of the contributions will result from a \r\ncombination of factors that take into account, among \r\nother things, their level of development, the size of \r\ntheir population and the volume of their emissions. \r\nLeast-developed countries will not be obliged to \r\ncontribute. This initiative of President Felipe Calderón \r\nhas received growing support from Member States, \r\nwhich reinforces the will of my Government to \r\ncontinue moving forward with all parties in the \r\nnegotiations prior to Copenhagen. \r\n The negotiations aimed at achieving \r\ncomprehensive Security Council reform have made \r\nsignificant progress through a process that has heard \r\ndebate on all aspects of reform and identified proposals \r\nthat can garner the broadest possible consensus. We \r\nmust continue negotiations towards compromise \r\nsolutions which would increase the representative \r\nnature of the Council and translate into greater \r\naccountability, without jeopardizing its effectiveness. \r\n The world has undoubtedly changed since 1945, \r\nand remains in a state of permanent mutation, as the \r\nongoing discussions on the international economic and \r\nfinancial architecture demonstrate. It is absurd to argue \r\nfor static institutions in a world that is anything but \r\nstatic. \r\n As we presented our candidacy as a \r\nnon-permanent member of the Security Council for the \r\n2009-2010 term, Mexico announced that it would seek \r\nto foster closer communications between Member \r\nStates and the Security Council, something which is \r\nessential if the Council is to accomplish its tasks. As \r\nPresident of the Council during the month of April, \r\nMexico made progress in increasing the transparency \r\nof that body by issuing information on a significant \r\nnumber of the Council’s consultations. We will keep \r\nworking to enhance the effectiveness and legitimacy of \r\nthe Council in several ways. First, we will seek to \r\nstrengthen the work of the Council in preventing \r\ninternational crises relating to massive human rights \r\nviolations and strengthening protection for the \r\nthousands of internally displaced persons and refugees. \r\nSecondly, we will seek to focus the Council’s attention \r\non preventing conflicts, and not just managing them, \r\nby incorporating in its resolutions mandates that link \r\nsecurity with strengthened development aid and \r\nhumanitarian assistance. Thirdly, we wish to make \r\ndevelopment assistance a fundamental strategy for \r\nconflict prevention and reconstruction. \r\n The situation in Honduras has made evident the \r\nimportance of continuing to improve our means in \r\npreventing actions that suspend democracy and the rule \r\nof law. We can celebrate the fact that the international \r\ncommunity responded unanimously to the forceful \r\ninterruption of constitutional order in Honduras and the \r\nousting of President José Manuel Zelaya. Mexico, \r\ntogether with the majority of countries of the \r\nhemisphere, has acted within regional mechanisms, \r\nincluding the Rio Group, which we chair, to secure \r\nPresident Zelaya’s return to office and that democratic \r\norder is restored based on the initiative of President \r\nArias of Costa Rica. We issue an emphatic call to the \r\nde facto authorities to continue the dialogue with the \r\ncommission established under the auspices of the \r\nOrganization of American States, to abstain from any \r\nact that would endanger the inviolability of the \r\nEmbassy of Brazil, where President Zelaya is located \r\nand to respect his physical safety and that of those who \r\nare with him. \r\n Let us work together for a world that is more \r\nsecure and more just, a world where in the words of the \r\ngreat Octavio Paz, liberty can take root — a prosperous \r\nworld anchored by the rights and freedoms of \r\nindividuals. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Shaikh Khalid Bin Ahmed Bin \r\nMohamed Al-Khalifa, Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nthe Kingdom of Bahrain. \r\n A/64/PV.11\r\n \r\n13 09-52598 \r\n \r\n Shaikh Al-Khalifa (Bahrain) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nWith great pleasure I extend heartfelt congratulations \r\nto my brother, His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam \r\nTreki, Secretary of African Union Affairs of the Libyan \r\nArab Jamahiriya, on his unanimous election to the high \r\noffice of President of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nfourth session. His extensive diplomatic experience \r\nand intimate knowledge of the United Nations will \r\nundoubtedly enable him to conduct the work of this \r\nsession with great effectiveness. \r\n I wish also to put on record my appreciation for \r\nthe efforts of the former President of the General \r\nAssembly, Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann of \r\nNicaragua, for his able stewardship of the sixty-third \r\nsession of the General Assembly and for the many \r\nenlightened proposals he made during his tenure to \r\nenhance and develop the Organization. \r\n My highest appreciation also goes to the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his tireless \r\nefforts to enhance the purposes and principles of the \r\nCharter and to promote the role of the Organization \r\nand enhance its efficiency in coping with new \r\ndevelopments and responding to the emerging needs of \r\nour peoples. \r\n Our belief in open-mindedness, tolerance, \r\ndiversity, non-violence and rejection of extremism \r\nrequires us first to free our minds of egoism and \r\nprejudice in order to replace conflict with dialogue, \r\ndisagreements with consensus and violence with \r\npersuasion, thus broadening our alliances and outreach \r\nefforts. We must exert greater efforts to show tolerance \r\ntowards those who do not necessarily share our values \r\nand ideas. Indeed, certain philosophical or \r\nargumentative issues can be tackled and resolved only \r\nif each party is open to the other, willing to coexist \r\nwith the other and ready to resist preconceived ideas \r\nand stereotypes. The presence of common ground and \r\nof mutual understanding can help to create a more \r\nprogressive and creative world and hence more secure, \r\nbased on tolerance, constructive dialogue and human \r\ncoexistence.  \r\n While the world has become a small village as \r\ndistances have been effectively abolished thanks to \r\ntechnological advances and the communications \r\nrevolution that has erased barriers and frontiers, it is \r\nstill dominated by political antagonisms, as States \r\ncontinue to pursue conflicting individual interests. This \r\nrequires us all to design pragmatic strategies for the \r\nfuture that safeguard everyone’s interests. That can be \r\nachieved only through mindsets capable of assimilating \r\nthese transformations and processing them to serve \r\nhumanity and to ensure international security and \r\nstability.  \r\n It is clear that global security cannot be achieved \r\nthrough the sole efforts of the super-Powers, because \r\nthe challenges we face are more serious, daunting and \r\nmore widespread than ever before. This requires a \r\nbroader global alliance of United Nations Member \r\nStates as well as the support of the entire United \r\nNations system in the interest of the international \r\ncommunity as a whole. At the same time, it requires \r\nnational strategies to address the challenges, problems \r\nand issues through close and sustained coordination \r\namong nations. The task that burdens us today requires \r\nthat we discuss all the issues threatening our world, \r\nwhile taking into account the historical background and \r\nthe particular values, ideas and traditions of our \r\nrespective societies. At the same time, each party must \r\nbe ready to understand and appreciate the positions and \r\ncharacteristics of the other and be ready to collectively \r\nfight hatred and prejudice. \r\n The Kingdom of Bahrain has always been a \r\nmelting pot of diverse civilizations, cultures, religions \r\nand races and since time immemorial has adopted the \r\nconcept of tolerance and openness towards the other \r\nand coexistence; thus, we firmly believe that finding \r\ncommon ground between universal civilizations and \r\ncultures and building a culture of peace among peoples \r\nis necessary. In that context, the peaceful settlement of \r\nconflicts is deeply rooted in our values and our \r\ntraditions, which are guided by the principles of our \r\nIslamic faith.  \r\n The Arab-Israeli conflict of the past six decades \r\nhas had a great effect on our generation. It is a sad \r\nlegacy that has left behind misery and human suffering, \r\npoisoned international and regional relations and \r\ncontinues periodically to exacerbates tension, violence \r\nand military confrontation in the Middle East. We have \r\ntried repeatedly and in vain to find a solution to this \r\nchronic conflict. To be sure, one conference after \r\nanother has been held, and initiative has followed \r\ninitiative. But we have been unable to deliver our \r\nmessage to the minds, hearts and homes of the people \r\nof the region. That is the essence of the proposal that \r\nHis Highness Shaikh Salman bin Hamad Al-Khalifa, \r\nCrown Prince of the Kingdom of Bahrain, presented in \r\nhis article published in The Washington Post on \r\nA/64/PV.11  \r\n \r\n09-52598 14 \r\n \r\n16 July, which makes a meaningful contribution to the \r\nadoption of a pragmatic approach to ending the \r\nconflict. His Highness wrote: \r\n “Our biggest mistake has been to assume that you \r\ncan simply switch peace on like a light bulb. The \r\nreality is that peace is a process, contingent on a \r\ngood idea but also requiring a great deal of \r\ncampaigning — patiently and repeatedly targeting \r\nall relevant parties.” \r\nCareful examination of this argument reveals the \r\ncorrect approach to addressing the Arab-Israeli \r\nconflict, namely, directly and expeditiously \r\ncommunicating our Arab Peace Initiative to the Israeli \r\npeople through their own information and news media. \r\nIn so doing, we will be in a better position to explore \r\nthe path to peace. \r\n Today, wisdom requires that we use available \r\ncommunications and media technology prudently and \r\nwith awareness in order to establish the channels and \r\nstructures that will enable us as leaders, Governments \r\nand civil society to establish the will and momentum \r\nnecessary to create an environment conducive to \r\nadvancing the peace that we aspire to. Because today, \r\ndialogue has become an omnipresent issue on the \r\nglobal agenda of the United Nations and other \r\ninternational forums, as shown by the many ongoing \r\ndialogues, including the dialogue among civilizations, \r\ndialogue of cultures and the interfaith dialogue. All \r\nthese processes aim at enhancing peaceful coexistence \r\nbetween nations and peoples and represent the \r\nprincipal course of action to eliminate the causes of \r\nconflict, tension and discord. \r\n Mr. Acharya (Nepal), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.  \r\n The Middle East peace process requires that we \r\nall exert greater political and diplomatic efforts in \r\norder to achieve the two-State solution — Israel and \r\nPalestine — as part of a comprehensive and just \r\nsettlement based on equal security for all the nations of \r\nthe Middle East region. We believe that the failure to \r\nend this conflict is due simply to the lack of a \r\nmethodology based on justice and balance and to the \r\nabsence of a binding implementation mechanism. We \r\nare all aware that the Arab side went to great lengths to \r\nmake it clear that it supports peace as an irreversible \r\nstrategic option.  \r\n The Arab Peace Initiative unequivocally \r\nconfirmed that position. We therefore expect the \r\ninternational community, and particularly the most \r\ninfluential leading Powers, to exert effective pressure \r\non Israel to freeze and eventually dismantle all \r\nsettlements established in the territories occupied in \r\n1967, to ensure demarcation of the borders of the \r\nPalestinian State with Jerusalem as its capital, \r\npeacefully coexisting with Israel, and to withdraw from \r\nall the occupied Syrian Golan and Lebanese territories, \r\nin conformity with the relevant resolutions of \r\ninternational legitimacy and the requirements of the \r\nRoad Map and the Arab Peace Initiative. \r\n Here I would like to commend the speech of \r\nPresident Barack Obama, delivered from this very \r\nrostrum, which we consider a frame of reference for \r\nthe resumption of the Middle East peace process. \r\nPresident Obama explicitly affirmed the need to \r\nrelaunch negotiations on final status issues — notably, \r\nsecurity for both Israelis and Palestinians, boundaries, \r\nrefugees and Jerusalem — rejected the continued \r\nillegitimate Israeli settlement activity in Palestinian \r\nterritories and called for the creation of a contiguous \r\nand viable Palestinian State. \r\n Among the other challenges and concerns \r\nconfronting our region is the question of nuclear \r\nproliferation in the Middle East and the Gulf region. \r\nThe Iranian nuclear programme is undoubtedly among \r\nthe causes for this common concern; nonetheless, it \r\nshould be dealt with in such a way as to spare our \r\nregion the threat of confrontation. This can best be \r\nachieved through diplomatic means. It is in that spirit \r\nthat the Kingdom of Bahrain, pursuant to Security \r\nCouncil resolution 1887 (2009), renews its call on the \r\ninternational community to actively work towards \r\nmaking the Middle East, including the Gulf region, a \r\nzone free of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of \r\nmass destruction, thus ensuring the security and well-\r\nbeing of the peoples of the region and the world at \r\nlarge, and to call upon Israel to accede to the Nuclear \r\nNon-Proliferation Treaty in order to achieve its \r\nuniversality. All nuclear facilities and activities in the \r\nMiddle East should be placed under International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency safeguards, while \r\nacknowledging the legitimate right of States to possess \r\nnuclear technology for peaceful uses in the areas where \r\nit has become vital for development and the \r\ndiversification of energy sources, in conformity with \r\nrelevant international agreements. \r\n A/64/PV.11\r\n \r\n15 09-52598 \r\n \r\n Other important regional issues are also a matter \r\nof concern to us. Foremost among these is the situation \r\nin brotherly Iraq, whose sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegrity it is important to affirm, while not interfering \r\nin its internal affairs. We should also condemn all \r\nterrorist activities perpetrated against Iraq with a view \r\nto destabilizing its security and rekindling sectarian \r\nhatred there. \r\n Also, in order to build confidence between the \r\nMember States of the Gulf Cooperation Council and \r\nIran, it is imperative to reach a settlement on the \r\nquestion of the occupied islands belonging to the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates, through either direct \r\nnegotiations or referral to the International Court of \r\nJustice. We also reaffirm the need for joint \r\ninternational and regional efforts to assist brotherly \r\nYemen, under the supervision of the United Nations, in \r\ncoping with the heavy refugee burden and focusing on \r\nits development efforts and the restoration of security \r\nand stability throughout its territory. Similarly, we \r\nstress the importance of preserving peace, stability and \r\nunity in the brotherly Sudan and we look forward to \r\nthe cooperation of all relevant parties to resolve the \r\nDarfur issue and to achieve the desired peace. \r\n We urge the international community to shoulder \r\nits responsibilities regarding security in Somalia, \r\nwhose internal troubles and fragile central Government \r\nhave led to the spread of maritime piracy in the Gulf of \r\nAden and the Bab-el-Mandeb strait, much to the \r\ndetriment of international navigation and trade. Also, \r\nthe Kingdom of Bahrain once again reaffirms its \r\nconsistent position concerning the sovereignty of the \r\nbrotherly Kingdom of Morocco over the its entire \r\nnational territory and calls on the international \r\ncommunity to support the negotiation process initiated \r\nby the Security Council, to maintain its momentum and \r\nactivate it. \r\n With peace and development the twin concerns of \r\nour world, it is only natural to feel frustration in the \r\nface of the prevailing environmental degradation, \r\npandemics, desertification, poverty, water scarcity, \r\ndepletion of the ozone layer, climate change and the \r\nworld financial crisis. These challenges represent an \r\nimminent threat both to our life now and to that of \r\nfuture generations. It is therefore no overstatement to \r\nsay that in the twenty-first century our destinies are \r\nintertwined, and that we need to redouble our \r\ncollective efforts to address these universal dangers \r\nthat daily threaten humanity and its health, food and \r\nsecurity. \r\n In this regard, the Kingdom of Bahrain, in \r\ncooperation with the United Nations and in the \r\npresence of the Secretary-General, hosted in May the \r\nlaunch of the 2009 Global Assessment Report on \r\nDisaster Risk Reduction. The report deals with issues \r\npertaining to the protection of lives and property in \r\nnatural disaster situations related to global warming, \r\nearthquakes, floods and rising sea levels. We hope that \r\nthe major industrial countries will play a key role in \r\nforging an agreement at December’s Copenhagen \r\nClimate Change Conference, with a view to curbing \r\nharmful greenhouse gas emissions. It is our hope that \r\nthe necessary political will can be mustered to respond \r\nto this threat to humanity and to make our world safer \r\nand more sustainable. \r\n In this context, the Kingdom of Bahrain, in its \r\ncapacity as a small island developing State, wishes to \r\nexpress great concern at the evident causal relation \r\nbetween climate change and rising sea levels, which \r\nposes a serious threat to our world. We are in \r\nagreement with the other small island developing \r\nStates in their concern over the adverse impact of the \r\nincrease in average global temperature. \r\n In conclusion, the gravity that characterizes our \r\npresent session, as exemplified by the responsible \r\ndiscussions in the first week, notably at the  \r\n22 September Summit on Climate Change and the  \r\n24 September Security Council summit (see S/PV.6181), \r\nreconfirms our need to return to the spirit of the \r\nCharter: that the United Nations is the principal forum \r\nfor multilateral cooperation to address a wide range of \r\ncontemporary issues. The United Nations as an \r\ninstitution is not limited merely to the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. Rather, it is the \r\nprincipal forum for the coordination of positions and \r\nefforts aimed at addressing the challenges threatening \r\nhuman beings and their environment, alleviating \r\npoverty, controlling pandemics and settling conflicts \r\nand wars through dialogue, negotiations and other \r\npeaceful means in a world guided by tolerance, \r\npeaceful coexistence and security for current and future \r\ngenerations. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Cuba. \r\nA/64/PV.11  \r\n \r\n09-52598 16 \r\n \r\n Mr. Rodríguez Parrilla (Cuba) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): I would like to congratulate Mr. Ali \r\nAbdussalam Treki on his election to the presidency and \r\nreiterate our confidence in his ability to conduct our \r\nwork and our deliberations successfully. I would also \r\nlike to recognize the excellent leadership of Father \r\nMiguel d’Escoto Brockmann, President of the \r\nAssembly at its previous session. The ethical \r\ndimension and political scope of his presidency have \r\nenabled us to move forward towards the goal of \r\nrestoring to this Assembly all its powers, and will stand \r\nas a benchmark for the future. Thanks to his example, \r\nit has become even clearer to us now that reforming the \r\nUnited Nations is about democratizing it and bringing \r\nit closer to the people. \r\n Since the general debate of one year ago \r\nimportant events have occurred in the international \r\narena. Climate change is now more visible and \r\ndangerous. The economic crisis has become intense \r\nand global. Social exclusion has increased. \r\n However, the international community reacted \r\nwith profound optimism to the change of Government \r\nin the United States. It seemed that a period of extreme \r\naggressiveness, unilateralism and arrogance in the \r\nforeign policy of that country had come to an end and \r\nthe infamous legacy of the George W. Bush regime had \r\ncrumbled in repudiation. As those in this very Hall can \r\nattest, novel and conciliatory words from the White \r\nHouse raised great hopes, and the world welcomed his \r\nrepeated messages of change, dialogue and \r\ncooperation. Unfortunately, time goes by, and those \r\nwords do not seem to be supported by concrete facts. \r\nThe words do not coincide with reality. \r\n The most serious and dangerous aspect of this \r\nnew situation is the uncertainty about the real capacity \r\nof the present authorities in Washington to overpower \r\nthe sweeping political and ideological currents that \r\nthreatened the world under the previous Administration. \r\nThe neoconservative groups that placed George Bush \r\nin the presidency — the powers that promoted the use \r\nof force and domination under the protection of the \r\ncolossal military and economic strength of the United \r\nStates and that are to blame for crimes including \r\ntorture, assassination and the manipulation of the \r\nAmerican people — have quickly regrouped and retain \r\nimmense resources of power and influence, contrary to \r\nthe change proclaimed. \r\n The detention and torture centre at the \r\nGuantánamo Bay Naval Base — which usurps Cuban \r\nterritory — has not been shut down. The occupation \r\ntroops in Iraq have not been withdrawn. The war in \r\nAfghanistan is expanding and is threatening other \r\nStates.  \r\n As for Cuba, which has suffered American \r\naggression for half a century, last April the new United \r\nStates Government announced measures to abolish \r\nsome of the Bush Administration’s most brutal actions \r\nthat prohibited contact between Cubans living in the \r\nUnited States and their relatives in Cuba, particularly \r\nthe possibility to visit them and to send assistance \r\nwithout limitations. These measures are a positive step, \r\nbut they are extremely limited and insufficient. \r\n The announced measures included authorizing \r\nAmerican companies to carry out certain \r\ntelecommunications operations with Cuba, but other \r\nrestrictions that prevent the implementation of those \r\noperations have not been modified. Nor has there been \r\nany sign that the United States Government is ready to \r\nput an end to the immoral practice — which has \r\nrecently increased — of misappropriating Cuban funds \r\nfrozen in American banks, as well as other goods, \r\nunder the protection of venal judges who violate their \r\nown laws. \r\n The essential fact is that the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial blockade of Cuba remains in \r\nplace. The United States President, despite the \r\nexistence of laws such as the Helms-Burton Act, still \r\nhas broad executive powers, such as the granting of \r\nlicenses, by means of which he could modify the \r\nimplementation of the blockade.  \r\n If there were a true desire for change, the United \r\nStates Government could authorize the export of Cuban \r\ngoods and services to the United States and vice versa. \r\nThe United States could allow Cuba to buy anywhere \r\nin the world products comprised of more than 10 per \r\ncent American components or technology, regardless of \r\ntrademark or country of origin. The United States \r\nDepartment of the Treasury could refrain from \r\npursuing, freezing and confiscating third-country \r\ntransfers in United States dollars and other currencies \r\nto Cuban nationals or entities. Washington could lift \r\nthe ban preventing third-country vessels from docking \r\nat any American port until 180 days after calling at any \r\nCuban port. The Treasury Department’s persecution of \r\nfinancial institutions and companies that trade with or \r\n A/64/PV.11\r\n \r\n17 09-52598 \r\n \r\ncarry out operations in Cuba could also be suspended. \r\nPresident Obama could allow American citizens, by \r\nmeans of a license, to travel to Cuba — the only \r\ncountry in the world they are not allowed to visit. \r\n The Secretary-General’s report to the Assembly \r\n(A/64/97) abounds with examples. In the course of \r\n2009 numerous fines, confiscations and other \r\nhindrances have been levelled at trade carried out by \r\nCuba or by third countries with Cuba. As the United \r\nStates Treasury Department itself has reported, since \r\nJanuary this year almost half of the funds collected by \r\nits Office of Foreign Assets Control came from \r\nsanctions imposed on American and foreign companies \r\nfor alleged violations of the economic blockade against \r\nCuba.  \r\n The true and indisputable fact is that the new \r\nAmerican Government continues to ignore the \r\ninternational community’s overwhelming appeal, \r\nexpressed in this Assembly year after year, to put an \r\nend to the blockade of Cuba. Two weeks ago President \r\nObama instructed the Secretaries of State and the \r\nTreasury that, contrary to what is reflected in all \r\nAmerican opinion polls, “it is in the national interest” \r\nto maintain economic sanctions against Cuba under the \r\nTrading with the Enemy Act — a law enacted in 1917 \r\nto address wartime situations and which is today \r\napplied only to Cuba. The United States blockade of \r\nCuba is an act of unilateral aggression that should be \r\nunilaterally terminated.  \r\n For many years Cuba has expressed its \r\nwillingness to normalize relations with the United \r\nStates. On 1 August 2009, President Raúl Castro Ruz \r\npublicly reiterated Cuba’s readiness to participate in a \r\nrespectful dialogue, between equals, with the United \r\nStates — a dialogue that assumes our independence, \r\nsovereignty and self-determination. He emphasized \r\nthat we should mutually respect our differences and \r\nthat Cuba does not recognize that the Government of \r\nthat or any other country, or any other group of States, \r\nhas any jurisdiction over our internal affairs.  \r\n The Government of Cuba has suggested to the \r\nUnited States Government a set of essential topics it \r\nconsiders must necessarily be discussed during a future \r\ndialogue aimed at improving relations. Those topics \r\ninclude the lifting of the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial blockade; the removal of Cuba from the \r\nspurious list of terrorist countries; the revocation of the \r\nCuban Adjustment Act and of the “wet foot, dry foot” \r\npolicy; compensation for economic and human \r\ndamages; the return of the territory occupied by the \r\nGuantánamo Bay Naval Base; the end of all radio and \r\ntelevision aggression from United States territory \r\nagainst Cuba; and the cessation of American funding of \r\ndomestic subversion.  \r\n An essential item on that agenda is the release of \r\nthe five Cuban anti-terrorism fighters who have been \r\nunjustly imprisoned in the United States for 11 years. \r\nPresident Obama has the constitutional prerogatives to \r\nfree them as an act of justice and of his Government’s \r\ncommitment against terrorism. \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n Furthermore, we have proposed to the United \r\nStates to begin talks on setting up cooperation to tackle \r\ndrug trafficking, terrorism and human smuggling, \r\nprotect the environment and address natural disasters. \r\nIn that spirit, the Cuban Government has held talks \r\nwith that of the United States on migration and on the \r\nestablishment of direct postal services. Those talks \r\nhave been courteous and useful. \r\n Cuba enjoys extensive and fruitful relations in all \r\nparts of the world. With the single exception of the \r\nUnited States, Cuba has friendly relations with all \r\ncountries of this hemisphere and counts on the \r\nsolidarity of the region. We cooperate with dozens of \r\ncountries of Africa, Asia, Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean. \r\n Ours is a stable country with a united, cultured \r\nand healthy people who have amply proven that, even \r\nunder an embargo, they are capable of facing the \r\nconsequences of the global economic crisis and the \r\neffects of climate change, which last year cost the \r\nnational economy 20 per cent of its gross domestic \r\nproduct. \r\n Conditions in Cuba are such that it can face its \r\nown problems and find solutions to them. We do so in a \r\njust and fair society that relies on its own efforts and \r\nhas been able to advance and guide its development in \r\nthe most adverse conditions. We are ready to continue \r\nfacing those challenges calmly and patiently, confident \r\nthat no citizen has been or will be abandoned and \r\ncertain that we are defending a cause of national \r\nindependence and a socialist plan that have the huge \r\nsupport of the Cubans. Anyone who tries to stop the \r\nrevolution and bend the will of the Cuban people is \r\nsuffering from delusions. Patriotism, social justice and \r\nA/64/PV.11  \r\n \r\n09-52598 18 \r\n \r\nthe resolve to defend independence are all part of our \r\nnational identity. \r\n Latin America and the Caribbean are in a \r\ndramatic situation, characterized by the sharp \r\ncontradiction between the large majorities — which, \r\ntogether with progressive Governments and broad \r\nsocial movements, are demanding justice and \r\nfairness — and the traditional oligarchies committed to \r\npreserving their privileges. The coup d’état in \r\nHonduras demonstrates that. Those who participated in \r\nthe coup and the usurpers who kidnapped the \r\nlegitimate President of that country are violating the \r\nconstitution and brutally repressing the people, as \r\nhappened in the dark years of the military dictatorships \r\nin Latin America propped up by the United States. \r\nHundreds of thousands of assassinated, missing and \r\ntortured persons are stirring the conscience of our \r\nAmerica in the face of impunity.  \r\n It has still not been explained why the plane that \r\nkidnapped the constitutional President of Honduras \r\nmade a stopover at the American Palmerola air base. \r\nThe American fascist right, which Cheney symbolizes, \r\nopenly supports and defends the coup. President \r\nJosé Manuel Zelaya must be fully, immediately and \r\nunconditionally reinstated to the execution of his \r\nconstitutional duties. The inviolability of the Brazilian \r\nEmbassy in Tegucigalpa must be respected and the \r\nsiege of and the attacks on its property must stop. The \r\nHonduran people are valiantly resisting and will have \r\nthe last word. \r\n Those events coincide with the renewed and \r\naggressive interest of the United States in setting up \r\nmilitary bases in Latin America and in re-establishing \r\nthe Fourth Fleet, clearly with the aim of putting the \r\nregion within only a few hours’ reach of American \r\ntroops, threatening the revolutionary and progressive \r\nmovements, in particular the Bolivarian revolution in \r\nthe sister nation of Venezuela, and gaining control of \r\nthe region’s oil and other natural resources. \r\n The slander and lies against the Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela are brutal. It should be recalled \r\nthat it was thus when atrocious aggression emerged and \r\nwas instigated against our fatherland. The broader and \r\nclearer the policy towards that sister nation, the more it \r\nwill contribute to the peace, independence and \r\ndevelopment of the peoples of Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean. \r\n Latin America and the Caribbean can advance \r\nand, to a certain extent, are moving forward to new and \r\nhigher forms of integration. They have more water, \r\nland, forests and mineral and energy resources than any \r\nother region of the planet. Their population exceeds \r\n570 million. The Rio Group, the Latin American and \r\nCaribbean Summit on Integration and Development \r\nand the Union of South American Nations are bodies \r\nset up by virtue of the ties that unite us. The Bolivarian \r\nAlliance for the Peoples of Our Americas and the \r\nPetrocaribe cooperation scheme are prime examples. \r\n The optimistic forecasts from Pittsburgh on the \r\nprogression of the global economic crisis, which \r\npredict a possible economic recovery early next year, \r\nare not based on solid data and, at best, only indicate \r\nrelief from collapse for a very limited group of the \r\nworld’s most powerful economies. It is worth noting \r\nthat objectives have been set but not a word has been \r\nsaid about how to achieve them. \r\n No one should forget that what is involved is an \r\nunprecedented crisis of the capitalist system that \r\nencompasses the respective food, energy, ecological, \r\nsocial and financial crises. Nor should we overlook the \r\ndanger of debt combined with inflation, of the bursting \r\nof other financial bubbles, or of a second collapse. The \r\ndeveloping countries are not to blame, but are the \r\nvictims of the consequences of the unreasonable and \r\nunsustainable model of consumption, exploitation and \r\nspeculation, the attack on the environment and the \r\ncorruption in the industrialized economies. \r\n While the debates go on, the number of hungry \r\npeople will reach a record figure of 1,020 million in \r\n2009 — a sixth of the world’s population. This year, \r\nanother 90 million will be cast into poverty and  \r\n50 million others into unemployment. During these \r\nmonths, another 400,000 children are expected to die \r\nas a result of the crisis. \r\n The measures that have been adopted are only \r\npalliative ones that perpetuate the serious deficiencies \r\nof an unjust, exclusive and ecologically unsustainable \r\ninternational economic system. We need a fully \r\ncomprehensive and inclusive international dialogue \r\nwith the active participation of all developing \r\ncountries. We need to establish a new international \r\neconomic order based on solidarity, justice, equality \r\nand sustainable development. The international \r\nfinancial architecture should be founded anew. The \r\n A/64/PV.11\r\n \r\n19 09-52598 \r\n \r\nUnited Nations, particularly this General Assembly, is \r\ncalled upon to play a key role in this endeavour. \r\n In conclusion, I reiterate Cuba’s gratitude for the \r\ntraditional and invaluable solidarity it has received \r\nfrom this General Assembly in its struggle against \r\naggression and the blockade. Today, that solidarity \r\nremains as indispensable as ever. \r\n As Commander in Chief Fidel Castro Ruz said \r\nfrom this very rostrum nine years ago:  \r\n  “Nothing in the existing economic and \r\npolitical order serves the interests of humankind. \r\nThus this order is unsustainable and must be \r\nchanged. Suffice it to say that the world has \r\nalready more than 6 billion inhabitants, 80 per \r\ncent of whom live in poverty. Ages-old diseases \r\nof the third world — diseases such as malaria, \r\ntuberculosis and others equally lethal — have not \r\nbeen eradicated, while new epidemics like AIDS \r\nthreaten to exterminate the population of entire \r\nnations … Meanwhile, wealthy countries keep \r\ndevoting enormous amounts of money to military \r\nexpenses and to buy luxury items, and a \r\nvoracious plague of speculators exchange \r\ncurrencies, stocks and other real or fictitious \r\nvalues for trillions of dollars every day. \r\n  “Nature is being devastated. The climate is \r\nchanging under our own eyes, and drinking water \r\nis increasingly contaminated or scarce. The seas, \r\na source of human sustenance, are being depleted, \r\nand crucial non-renewable resources are being \r\nwasted on luxury and vanities … \r\n  “The dream of having truly fair and sensible \r\nnorms to guide human destiny seems impossible \r\nto many. However, we are convinced that the \r\nstruggle for the impossible should be the motto of \r\nthis institution that brings us together today.” \r\n(A/55/PV.4, p. 20) \r\n Despite everything, the fiftieth anniversary of the \r\nCuban Revolution is being celebrated victoriously and \r\nwith pride. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Abdelwaheb Abdallah, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Tunisia. \r\n Mr. Abdallah (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to extend to you, Sir, and through \r\nyou to the brotherly Socialist People’s Libyan Arab \r\nJamahiriya our sincere congratulations upon your \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-fourth session. We are confident that your broad \r\nexperience and many skills will help enrich our work at \r\nthis session and achieve the objectives to which we all \r\naspire. Our high appreciation goes also to Mr. Miguel \r\nd’Escoto Brockmann for the excellent manner in which \r\nhe conducted the work of the previous session. \r\n I also express our warmest thanks and \r\nappreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \r\ntireless efforts in the service of world peace and \r\nsecurity to promote the role of the United Nations, \r\nachieve our common noble objectives and find \r\neffective solutions to various international problems. \r\n Today our world is witnessing profound and rapid \r\nchanges that have added new dimensions to \r\ninternational relations, which in turn have altered the \r\nbalances and equations that have long governed those \r\nrelations. These changes have generated major \r\nchallenges at various levels, requiring all parties to \r\nshoulder their responsibilities with vision and wisdom \r\nand to enhance their efforts to establish the foundations \r\nof a safer, more stable and more developed world and \r\nof balanced and equitable international relations based \r\non solidarity. \r\n We must redouble our efforts to reform the \r\nUnited Nations, which was designed decades ago, in \r\norder to update it to current global circumstances and \r\nenable it to carry out its essential role in maintaining \r\ninternational peace, security and development, and in \r\nserving the interests of world solidarity.  \r\n Global circumstances have changed since the \r\ncreation of the United Nations. Its present structure and \r\nequations no longer reflect the reality of the world \r\nsituation and international relations. Given our concern \r\nfor justice and balance in international relations, we \r\nhope that the international community will introduce \r\nthe necessary reforms to the United Nations system, in \r\nparticular in the context of expanding the Security \r\nCouncil and increasing the transparency and efficiency \r\nof its work, while bearing in mind need for the \r\nbroadest possible consensus among States on pending \r\nissues. \r\n In spite of its complex and interrelated nature, the \r\nworld situation can only strengthen our attachment to \r\nthe United Nations and to its founding principles. \r\nThose principles constitute the ideal framework for \r\ncoordinating and uniting our efforts to address issues \r\nA/64/PV.11  \r\n \r\n09-52598 20 \r\n \r\nand challenges in the implementation of the noble \r\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter, finding effective \r\nsolutions to pending issues, mitigating the impact of \r\nthe economic and social crisis, and promoting \r\nsolidarity-based frameworks of partnership and \r\ncooperation, in keeping with a more comprehensive \r\napproach based on the close correlation between peace, \r\nsecurity and development. \r\n Further rapprochement and solidarity among the \r\nnations of the world remain, in our view, among the \r\nnoblest aims of the United Nations and a pillar of the \r\nnew system of international relations. Therefore, today \r\nmore than ever before, we must further disseminate the \r\nculture of tolerance, dialogue and acceptance of the \r\nother and respect for cultural differences and religious \r\nsymbols. We must build constructive relations among \r\nStates and peoples, based on moderation and the \r\nrejection of extremism, violence and fanaticism of any \r\nkind. \r\n For many years now, Tunisia has promoted \r\ninitiatives to give effect to that noble objective, the \r\nmost recent of which was “Kairouan, Capital of \r\nIslamic Culture for the Year 2009”, organized with the \r\ncooperation of the Islamic Educational, Scientific and \r\nCultural Organization and the International \r\nOrganization of la Francophonie. \r\n Globalization, with its numerous problems and \r\nmajor challenges, requires us to pay close attention to \r\nour young people and to constantly listen to their \r\nconcerns in order to protect them from exclusion, \r\nmarginalization and the dangers of seclusion, \r\nextremism, carelessness and estrangement, while at the \r\nsame time instilling in them a culture of tolerance, \r\ncompromise and moderation.  \r\n Based on the special status that we reserve for \r\nour young people, whom we consider to be our true \r\nwealth, the support of the present and foundation of the \r\nfuture, we in Tunisia have insisted on entrenching the \r\nspirit of responsibility within this group and encourage \r\nthem to participate actively in all aspects of public life \r\nand in establishing the country’s future policies and \r\nobjectives. \r\n Based on this vision and our experience in \r\ndealing with our youth and its aspirations, President \r\nZine El Abidine Ben Ali called for the proclamation of \r\n2010 as the International Year of Youth and for the \r\nconvening, under United Nations auspices and in \r\ncooperation with the relevant international organizations, \r\nof a world youth conference to be attended by young \r\npeople from all over the world and to conclude with \r\nthe drafting of an international pact uniting world \r\nyouth around universal values. \r\n We strongly hope that this initiative will \r\ncontribute to deepening awareness of the position of \r\nyoung people in society so that they become active \r\nstakeholders in the success of our development \r\nprocesses. Furthermore, young people should play a \r\nmajor role in promoting dialogue and in enhancing \r\nunderstanding and mutual respect among peoples on \r\nthe basis of universal values and noble human \r\nprinciples concerning which all cultures and \r\ncivilizations agree — values such as tolerance, \r\nmoderation and respect of the other; rejection of all \r\nforms of violence, extremism and discrimination; the \r\nculture of citizenship, solidarity, peace and \r\ncommunication; stimulation of the spirit of initiative; \r\nvolunteerism and environmental protection. \r\n This initiative already enjoys the support of Arab, \r\nAfrican and Islamic regional organizations as well as \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement. We look forward to your \r\nsupport, Mr. President, for the adoption of a resolution \r\nby the General Assembly at this session in order to \r\ngive concrete expression to this initiative. \r\n Terrorism remains a major threat to world peace, \r\nsecurity and development, in spite of numerous \r\nnational and international efforts to counter it. It \r\nremains a challenge to the international community, \r\nand we have on numerous occasions called for a \r\ncomprehensive approach in addressing a danger that \r\nspares no one. We must take into consideration the root \r\ncauses of such phenomena, as well as just and \r\nsustainable solutions to ongoing world problems. We \r\nmust work to decrease poverty, exclusion and \r\nmarginalization, and we must confront extremist \r\nmovements that favour fanaticism, seclusion and \r\nhatred. \r\n As one of the first countries to warn against the \r\ndangers of this phenomenon in the early 1990s, Tunisia \r\nrenews its call for the convening of an international \r\nconference under the auspices of the United Nations to \r\ncraft a universally binding code of conduct to fight \r\nterrorism. \r\n Faithful to its identity and keen to ensure its full \r\nintegration into its community, Tunisia strives \r\ntirelessly and resolutely to enhance cooperation with \r\nits partners in various regional affiliations. In the firm \r\n A/64/PV.11\r\n \r\n21 09-52598 \r\n \r\nbelief that the Arab Maghreb Union is an indispensable \r\nstrategic choice for the interests of the Maghreb \r\npeoples and will enhance the regional and international \r\nstatus of its members in a world where blocs and \r\ngroupings are proliferating, Tunisia has spared no \r\neffort, together with other Maghreb countries, to \r\ncomplete the process of building the Union, promote \r\ncommon Maghreb action and work to overcome the \r\ntemporary difficulties that are preventing its \r\nmaterialization. We seek thereby to ensure that the \r\nUnion enjoys the position it deserves on the \r\ninternational scene and to increase the capacity of its \r\nmember States to meet present and future challenges. \r\n Tunisia also continues to work to promote \r\ncommon Arab action, revitalize its mechanisms, \r\ndevelop cooperation and partnership relations with \r\nsister Arab States in various fields, and bring about the \r\ndesired Arab economic integration and complementarity. \r\n Many international problems, particularly in the \r\nMiddle East, remain unresolved and are a source of \r\ndeep concern for the international community, with \r\nnegative consequences for security and stability in the \r\nregion and the world. From this rostrum, we reaffirm \r\nTunisia’s constant and principled support for the just \r\nPalestinian cause and the brotherly Palestinian people \r\nin their struggle to recover their legitimate rights and to \r\nestablish their independent State on their own land. \r\n We note with satisfaction the positive stance of \r\nthe United States Administration on the Middle East \r\nissue, the elements of a just and comprehensive \r\nsettlement of the conflict, the two-State solution, and \r\nsubsequent international efforts and momentum to \r\nrevive the peace talks.  \r\n Today, we renew our appeal to the international \r\ncommunity, especially the sponsors of the peace \r\nprocess, to intensify their efforts so as to compel Israel \r\nto end its settlement policy, without preconditions, thus \r\nenabling talks between the Palestinian and Israeli sides \r\nto resume, in accordance with international resolutions, \r\nall peace terms of reference and the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative. \r\n Achieving peace and ensuring security and \r\nstability in the Middle East will require Israel to lift the \r\nblockade, dismantle the roadblocks and abandon its \r\nhumiliating measures and other provocative steps \r\nagainst the Palestinians, as well as the recovery by the \r\nPalestinian people of its legitimate national rights, the \r\nestablishment of its independent State, and Israeli \r\nwithdrawal from the occupied Syrian Golan and the \r\nLebanese lands that remain under Israeli occupation. \r\n We also express our solidarity with the brotherly \r\nIraqi people and hope that they will overcome the \r\ndifficulties they still face, achieve national \r\nreconciliation and consolidate security and stability so \r\nthat all Iraqis can devote themselves to the \r\nreconstruction of their country in a spirit of unity and \r\naccord. \r\n The hotspots of tension and conflict in many \r\nregions of Africa, some of which persist, have \r\ndevastated the continent, sapped its energies and \r\npotential, jeopardized its development, slowed its \r\ngrowth and negatively affected its societies. \r\n Faced with this situation and given the \r\nnecessarily comprehensive nature of any approach to \r\nworld peace and security, the international community \r\nand the United Nations organs, first and foremost the \r\nSecurity Council, must support the efforts of the \r\nAfrican Union and its member States and stand with \r\nthe African peoples as they seek to restore security and \r\nstability and to overcome the effects of conflict and \r\nwar. \r\n Given the organic relationship between peace, \r\nsecurity and development, and the world’s pressing \r\nneed to reinvigorate the values of cooperation and \r\nsolidarity, Tunisia proposed an initiative that was \r\nadopted by the General Assembly in December 2002 to \r\ncreate the World Solidarity Fund to fight poverty and \r\nlay the foundations of solidarity-based development. \r\nToday we renew our call to operationalize the Fund, \r\nthus enabling it to assist developing countries, \r\nparticularly those in Africa. \r\n On a different level, and taking into consideration \r\nthe rich and long-standing political, economic, social \r\nand cultural links between Tunisia and Europe, our \r\ncountry is ever keen to strengthen its relations with all \r\nthe States of that sphere. Tunisia’s relations with the \r\nEuropean Union have seen tangible progress, thanks to \r\nboth sides’ determination to upgrade their ties to the \r\nlevel of advanced partnership, thus opening prospects \r\nfor enhanced cooperation in all fields and enabling our \r\ncountry to achieve further integration with its regional \r\nand international environment. \r\n The Euro-Mediterranean region remains one of \r\nthe main focuses of Tunisia’s foreign policy. On the \r\nbasis of our strong belief in the importance of building \r\nA/64/PV.11  \r\n \r\n09-52598 22 \r\n \r\na secure, stable and prosperous Mediterranean region \r\non a foundation of equal partnership and mutual \r\ninterests, we support initiatives and mechanisms to \r\nconsolidate peace and promote development. From this \r\nperspective, Tunisia is determined to play an active \r\nrole in ensuring the success of Mediterranean \r\ncooperation for the benefit of the peoples of the region. \r\n Tunisia is also working to strengthen its ties of \r\nfriendship and to broaden and enrich its cooperation \r\nwith American and Asian States through the \r\nestablishment of a solidarity-based partnership. We are \r\nthus laying the groundwork for a new era in these \r\nrelations that will secure the interests of all sides, bring \r\nthem together, consolidate conditions of peace and \r\nstability, and achieve further progress and prosperity \r\naround the world. \r\n The peoples of the world today urgently need a \r\nclean environment and all States must preserve it in \r\norder to avoid the severe consequences of which much \r\nresearch and many studies have warned, as climate \r\nchange has caused huge economic losses to the \r\ninternational community. \r\n Seeking to meet the environmental, economic and \r\nsocial challenges caused by climate change, in \r\nNovember 2007 Tunisia hosted the International \r\nSolidarity Conference on Climate Change Strategies \r\nfor the African and Mediterranean Regions. Our \r\ncountry also hosted the African regional meeting of the \r\nPreparatory Committee for the Conference of the \r\nParties to the United Nations Convention to Combat \r\nDesertification in order to develop a unified African \r\nposition and garner support for African States that are \r\nnegatively affected by desertification and land \r\ndeterioration, as well as to promote scientific research \r\nin this field. \r\n Tunisia has spared neither effort nor energy over \r\nthe past two decades to join the ranks of developed \r\ncountries, based on an open-minded and forward-\r\nlooking vision, the foundations of which were laid by \r\nPresident Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. This vision has \r\nencompassed all fields — political, economic, social \r\nand development — and been implemented via \r\nthorough reforms to strengthen democracy and the \r\nculture of human rights in word and deed, and through \r\nthe expansion of public freedoms and the participation \r\nof all sectors of Tunisian society in charting the \r\ncountry’s political course within the frameworks of the \r\nrule of law and institutions. \r\n I reiterate in conclusion that our success in \r\nsecuring development and promoting relations of \r\ncooperation among all States is closely linked to an \r\ninternational environment characterized by security, \r\nstability and justice.  \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Osman Mohammed Saleh, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Eritrea. \r\n Mr. Saleh (Eritrea): Let me begin by \r\ncongratulating our sisterly country the Libyan Arab \r\nJamahiriya and you personally, Mr. President, on your \r\nassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-fourth session. I express our confidence that \r\nyour long-standing diplomatic skills and leadership \r\nwill lead us to a successful conclusion of the session. I \r\nwish to assure you of the full support of the delegation \r\nof the State of Eritrea in the realization of this mission. \r\n Permit me also to seize this opportunity to pay a \r\nwell-deserved tribute to the President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-third session, Mr. Miguel \r\nd’Escoto Brockmann of Nicaragua, for the very able \r\nand effective manner in which he led the affairs of the \r\nAssembly. \r\n Likewise, we commend Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon for his continuous efforts to administer \r\nthe affairs of the United Nations, and especially for \r\nconvening the Summit on Climate Change last week. \r\n The General Assembly is holding its annual \r\ngeneral debate for 2009 at a very critical juncture. One \r\nyear after the world financial and economic crisis \r\nbegan, this gathering provides us with another \r\nopportunity for reflection. \r\n The Hall in which we meet today and the lofty \r\npurposes for which it was built have both outlived their \r\ntime. This body was conceived in another era to \r\naddress the challenges of the world order prevailing \r\nafter the First and Second World Wars. Therefore, it \r\ncannot realistically cope with the demands of the \r\ntwenty-first century. From an objective point of view, \r\nthe United Nations should have embarked on a process \r\nof transformation 20 years ago, in concurrence with the \r\nend of the cold war. By now, it should have been \r\nreplaced by a reformed Organization fit to address the \r\nchallenges of the century we live in and beyond. \r\n The calls to re-engineer this renewed \r\nOrganization have not been few. Two decades have \r\npassed without any meaningful results in the direction \r\n A/64/PV.11\r\n \r\n23 09-52598 \r\n \r\nof substantive reform. The financial and economic \r\ncrisis and the global awareness that it has spawned are \r\nmere symptoms of the consequences of inaction at the \r\ncost of reform. \r\n The prevailing world order has not succeeded in \r\nguaranteeing the peace and security of our planet, in \r\nspite of all the intentions that brought forth its creation \r\nand of the harsh lessons learned from the two World \r\nWars. On the contrary, this ageing world order has been \r\nhijacked to serve the interests of the few, opening the \r\ndoor to a myriad of ramifications.  \r\n Financial institutions have been left to operate \r\nunrestrained by restrictions or regulations. Economic \r\nstructures that pillage the resources and wealth of \r\npeoples and nations have been consolidated. \r\nIllegitimate military and coercive blunders have been \r\nallowed to fester unchecked. The exploitation of war \r\nand those who help spread it have been honed in a \r\npurposeful manner. The number of people suffering \r\nfrom poverty and hunger has not been reduced; it has \r\nrather multiplied many times over. Violent extremism \r\nhas not received the attention it deserves; rather, it has \r\nbeen further fuelled and manipulated as a pretext and \r\nexcuse for ulterior motives. A culture of the politics of \r\nfear and management by crisis has been nurtured, \r\nexploited and established as a norm. Indeed, world \r\npeace and security have been imperilled beyond \r\nmeasure. The United Nations itself has been one of the \r\nvictims of this world order. Evidence to this effect is \r\nknown to us all and is well documented. \r\n Reform and change are long overdue. Despite \r\nfervent calls for reform by the international \r\ncommunity, the few who control our outdated world \r\norder are unfortunately not attuned to the notion of \r\nchange. They have instead regarded crises and \r\nsuffering as ordinary historical imperatives. To this \r\nend, they have resisted all attempts to introduce change \r\nand, through their clout, influence and advantages, \r\nhave been able to block it. Thus, no real reform has \r\noccurred so far. \r\n In this global maelstrom, where even the peoples \r\nof the developed countries have been adversely \r\naffected, none have been more exposed to harm than \r\nthe marginalized in Africa. We, the peoples of Africa, \r\nhave been victims of poverty and hunger, models of \r\nbackwardness, and metaphors for diseases and \r\nepidemics. And the continent has become a breeding \r\nground for crises and conflicts.  \r\n In this regard, the most urgent concern is the fact \r\nthat special-interest groups have rendered Africans \r\nparalysed. Hence, instead of resolving our own \r\nproblems, we find ourselves mired in poverty, hunger \r\nand disease rather than actively striving to achieve \r\ndevelopment and growth. Similarly, when it comes to \r\nthe resolution of crises and conflicts, Africans find \r\nthemselves dependent on the goodwill of others.  \r\n However, criticism cannot be reserved only for \r\nthe special-interest groups that steer the prevailing \r\nworld order; it must also be apportioned to those \r\ngroups that serve as their instruments and partners. \r\nIndeed, the role of Africa in this body, as well as in \r\nother international organizations, can best be described \r\nas inconsequential. The evidence for this unfortunate \r\nsituation is also well documented. \r\n If world peace and security are to be preserved, \r\njustice and human rights respected, hunger eradicated, \r\nand economic development and growth made to benefit \r\nthe majority in a sustainable fashion, the implementation \r\nof fundamental change in this Organization and other \r\ninternational bodies should not be left to the goodwill \r\nof the few. The change needed to transform this \r\noutdated world order into a new one must not be \r\nlimited to reform; it should be solid, genuine and \r\ncapable of bringing peace, security and prosperity to \r\ncoming generations. Reform should not be limited to \r\nincreasing the number of seats in the Security Council. \r\nIt should, rather, steer our world away from its \r\ndangerous downhill path, controlled by a powerful few, \r\nand redirect it towards one that ensures the safety of \r\nall. \r\n Though this is the ideal to which the world’s \r\npeoples aspire and strive for, the African continent, for \r\nobvious and particular reasons, needs to expend more \r\neffort to achieve it. But beyond all the good wishes, the \r\nfundamental reform we are waiting for requires \r\ncollective commitment. On this auspicious occasion, it \r\nwould not do simply to dwell on various current events \r\nor those consequences spawned by the fundamental \r\nflaws of the world order. Doing so would only confuse \r\nand distort the bigger picture. I have therefore chosen \r\nnot to address important issues concerning the Horn of \r\nAfrica and Eritrea’s specific problem of the illegal \r\noccupation of sovereign Eritrean territory, which is \r\nalready in the records of the United Nations awaiting \r\nresponsible and urgent action. \r\nA/64/PV.11  \r\n \r\n09-52598 24 \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Walid Al-Moualem, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Syrian Arab Republic. \r\n Mr. Al-Moualem (Syria) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nAllow me to congratulate the fraternal Libyan Arab \r\nJamahiriya and you personally, Mr. President, on your \r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \r\nthis session. I wish you success in your endeavours, \r\nand succeed you will, given your vast experience and \r\ncompetence.  \r\n I also extend our deep appreciation to your \r\npredecessor, Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann, for \r\nsuccessfully steering the work of the sixty-third \r\nsession; I recognize his positive stand vis-à-vis the \r\nfundamental issues with which the international \r\ncommunity is seized. I also wish the Secretary-General \r\nevery success in his undertakings as he seeks to fulfil \r\nthe purposes and principles of our international \r\nOrganization. \r\n We come here every year and stress from this \r\nvery rostrum, as do many others, that the Middle East \r\nis one of the most tense regions of the world and that \r\nthe situation is extremely ominous. From this very \r\nrostrum, most speakers stress that a just and \r\ncomprehensive peace is an urgent requirement for the \r\nrealization of the interests of all parties in the region \r\nand the world at large. However, paying lip service to \r\nthe need for peace is obviously different from working \r\nfor peace. Actions inside and outside the region have \r\nspoken louder than words, and peace has remained \r\nelusive for years.  \r\n During that time, Israel waged two devastating \r\nwars against Lebanon and Gaza. It had no qualms \r\nabout committing internationally prohibited acts or \r\nbreaching international law, encouraged and protected \r\nby the Administration of former United States \r\nPresident Bush. To date, Israel continues to impose a \r\nstifling siege on Gaza, in contravention of the most \r\nbasic humanitarian principles and tenets of \r\ninternational humanitarian law. These facts have been \r\nconfirmed by many investigations, and were most \r\nrecently published in the report of the United Nations \r\nFact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict. The head \r\nof the Mission concluded that Israel had committed \r\ngrave violations of human rights law, and international \r\nhumanitarian law, including war crimes and possibly \r\ncrimes against humanity. \r\n The international approach to the Middle East \r\nquestion has changed in previous years. Addressing \r\nthis issue has become a priority, and has been followed \r\nby immediate action on the ground. This is certainly \r\nreassuring. It is our sincere hope that these efforts will \r\nbear fruit. But the engagement by the new United \r\nStates Administration, the members of the Security \r\nCouncil, the European Union, the Organization for the \r\nIslamic Conference and the Non-Aligned Movement \r\nhas been continuously confronted with Israeli measures \r\nand positions that ignore the most basic underpinnings \r\nof the peace process. Israel defies the policies of its \r\nfriends and allies and undermines their will. Israel also \r\nchallenges the will of the overwhelming majority — if \r\nnot the entirety — of the international community. \r\nPerhaps more than ever before, Israel has now revealed \r\nits true colours: an entity that has enshrined racism, \r\naggression and tension-building while balking at peace \r\nand repudiating the advocates of peace. \r\n Israel refuses to freeze illegitimate settlement \r\nbuilding and is thus in breach of its obligations under \r\ninternational law. Israel continues to confiscate \r\nPalestinian land, build the apartheid wall, Judaize \r\nJerusalem, expel inhabitants from their homes and \r\nbring in settlers to replace them. This list is in no way \r\nexhaustive. These facts are substantiated by figures \r\nbut, in the interest of time, we shall not dwell on them \r\nin detail. Suffice it to say that the two-State solution \r\nadvocated by the international community has been \r\nrejected by the Israeli Government. The Israeli Prime \r\nMinister’s comments on the subject are sheer tactical \r\nmanoeuvres that are contradicted entirely by the \r\npolicies pursued by his Government on the ground. \r\n President Bashar Al-Assad has said that peace is \r\nantithetical to occupation. Peace and occupation cannot \r\ncoexist. He stressed that we in Syria seek a just and \r\ncomprehensive peace and that peace is our strategic \r\nchoice. It is a choice based on the implementation of \r\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 \r\n(1973), the Madrid terms of reference, the principle of \r\nland for peace and the Arab Peace Initiative. We have \r\nsupported every effort aimed at achieving this goal. To \r\nthat end, we entered into indirect talks with Israel \r\nthrough Turkish mediation and sought to arrive at \r\ncommon ground that would ultimately enable us to \r\nlaunch direct negotiations. But the absence of genuine \r\npolitical will to make peace and the war of aggression \r\nthat the Israeli Government waged against Gaza \r\nbrought this pursuit to a halt. \r\n A/64/PV.11\r\n \r\n25 09-52598 \r\n \r\n In full view of the world and in defiance of its \r\nunanimous will, Israel has chosen to be a rejectionist \r\nState. It has chosen to challenge the international \r\ncommunity. This is a dangerous position and a stance \r\nthat threatens peace and security in the region. The \r\ncontinued occupation, the Judaization of Jerusalem, the \r\nintensification of settlement activities and the racist \r\nslogans presage serious consequences for the world. \r\nThe world must not succumb to the dictates of Israeli \r\nextremists. It must not allow Israel to persist in its \r\nviolation of international law and its defiance of \r\ninternational will and decisions. \r\n Brotherly Iraq continues to bleed. The situation in \r\nIraq is a cause for serious concern to us as a \r\nneighbouring Arab country. We have continuously \r\nstressed the urgency of preserving the unity of Iraq’s \r\nterritory and people while guaranteeing its sovereignty \r\nand safeguarding its independence and its Arab-Islamic \r\nidentity. To that end, it is urgent to build Iraqi national \r\nunity on the basis of national reconciliation, which \r\nmust include Iraqis of all stripes. Iraqi national unity is \r\nthe cornerstone of the reconciliation process, but it will \r\nremain elusive unless the necessary conditions for \r\nnational reconciliation are achieved. \r\n We have continuously condemned all aggressive \r\nacts that claim the lives of innocent victims in Iraq. We \r\nhave also repeatedly called for the withdrawal of all \r\nforeign troops from Iraq and for the restoration of full \r\nIraqi independence and sovereignty. We have stressed \r\nour readiness to facilitate that withdrawal by extending \r\nour cooperation in maintaining security in Iraq. It is \r\nour hope that Iraqis will soon be able to arrive, through \r\nconstructive dialogue, at solutions that firmly support \r\nIraq’s unity, strength and prosperity while remaining \r\nfully dedicated and loyal to the unity of the land of Iraq \r\nand its people. \r\n Syria has been dedicated to strengthening \r\nbilateral Syrian-Iraqi relations in all their aspects. We \r\nestablished a bilateral council for strategic cooperation \r\nin various fields. We were distressed by the recent \r\n“Bloody Wednesday” terrorist bombings in Baghdad, \r\nwhich we strongly condemn. But we were surprised to \r\nhear, days later, accusations levelled at us — \r\naccusations devoid of any truth — implying that we \r\nharboured those suspected of masterminding those \r\nbombings. These claims and the ensuing developments \r\nare extremely unfortunate and cannot serve the \r\ninterests of Iraq or Syria. \r\n We are open to suggestions on how to solve the \r\ncurrent crisis by demanding that real evidence be made \r\navailable to substantiate those claims. This has not yet \r\nbeen done. We stress that protecting the Iraqi people \r\nand safeguarding their interests is one of our priorities. \r\nWe are also keen to safeguard the fraternal relations \r\nbetween the Iraqi and Syrian peoples and express our \r\nsatisfaction at the current efforts of Turkey and the \r\nSecretary-General of the League of Arab States. \r\n We have followed with grave concern the recent \r\ndevelopments in Yemen. We hope that security will \r\nultimately prevail. We support Yemen’s unity, stability \r\nand the prosperity of its people. \r\n Attempts to undermine the Sudan’s unity and to \r\ncompromise its security and sovereignty are also a \r\ncause of concern for us. We fully support the Sudan \r\nand its leadership and stress the need to create \r\nfavourable conditions conducive to a settlement of all \r\npending issues. In that regard, we appreciate the efforts \r\nmade by the State of Qatar in cooperation with the \r\nLeague of Arab States and the African Union. \r\n Another cause for concern is the events unfolding \r\nin Somalia, a country already afflicted by war and \r\ninternal strife. We call on our brothers there to work for \r\nnational reconciliation and to use dialogue as a means \r\nof settling their differences. We urge them to work \r\ntowards the unity of Somalia, which as the supreme \r\nnational interest should take precedence over any other \r\nconsideration, and to lay the foundations for security \r\nand stability in their country. \r\n We support the efforts of the African Union to \r\nsettle the existing conflicts that continue to plague \r\nsome parts of the African continent, to achieve \r\ndevelopment in the countries of Africa and to promote \r\nthe African role in the international system. \r\n We also renew our call for the lifting of the \r\nblockade imposed on Cuba for more than half a \r\ncentury. \r\n For years, Syria has been calling for the \r\nestablishment of a zone free of all weapons of mass \r\ndestruction in the Middle East region. To this end, \r\nSyria tabled a draft resolution before the Security \r\nCouncil in 2003 calling for the establishment of such a \r\nzone. Today Syria stresses the need for Israel to \r\ncommit to complying with the resolution of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) adopted \r\non 18 September of this year regarding Israeli nuclear \r\nA/64/PV.11  \r\n \r\n09-52598 26 \r\n \r\ncapabilities (GC(53)/RES/17), in which the Agency \r\ncalled upon Israel to place its nuclear facilities under \r\ncomprehensive IAEA safeguards and to accede to the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \r\n(NPT). We recall once again the right of all States to \r\nacquire nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, as \r\nguaranteed by the NPT. We fully support constructive \r\ndialogue as a means to settle all differences. \r\n The world is still reeling from a crippling \r\neconomic and financial crisis that has adversely \r\naffected the economic and social conditions of most \r\ncountries of the world. Very few countries, if any, have \r\nbeen spared its devastating effects. This crisis led many \r\nto question its root causes, shedding light on the \r\ndeficiencies in the financial system and its practices \r\nand thus highlighting the sound practices that could \r\nhave prevented the crisis. The world cannot deal with \r\nthe crisis as a fait accompli. We must seek answers and \r\noutcomes that endorse sound practices and remedy \r\nsystemic imbalances that are bound to affect us all in \r\nthe globalized world in which we live. Our common \r\ngoal is to establish a more secure economic and \r\nfinancial world order. \r\n It goes without saying that the countries of the \r\nSouth have disparate economies and are comparatively \r\nmore disadvantaged and adversely affected by the \r\ncurrent crisis than those of the North. The world’s poor \r\nend up paying a higher price for a breakdown that is \r\nnot of their making. Rich States are therefore duty \r\nbound to provide all forms of support to poorer \r\ncountries to help them overcome this crisis. Poor \r\ncountries have earned this support, and any positive \r\nresults that it generates will serve the interests of poor \r\nand rich countries alike. We also call for the increased \r\nparticipation of developing countries in the work of the \r\nGroup of 20, which would enable them to put forward \r\nproposals and advance appropriate responses to \r\novercome the crisis. \r\n We and many others have often called for an \r\nenhanced and reinvigorated role for the United Nations \r\nin order to build a better, more just and more secure \r\nworld. We believe that the present moment is \r\nauspicious. We therefore call on all Member States to \r\nwork seriously to ensure compliance with the Charter \r\nof our international Organization and to introduce the \r\nnecessary reforms in order to promote it, learning from \r\nthe lessons of past decades and from our achievements \r\nand failures. We sincerely look forward to a world \r\ngoverned by respect for international law in which \r\nsecurity, stability and prosperity reign supreme. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now call on \r\nHer Excellency Ms. Aïchatou Mindaoudou, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs, Cooperation and African \r\nIntegration of the Republic of the Niger. \r\n Ms. Mindaoudou (Niger) (spoke in French): The \r\ndelegation of the Niger — which I have the honour to \r\nlead and which brings the message of His Excellency \r\nMamadou Tandja, President of the Republic — is more \r\nthan pleased to see you, Mr. President, presiding over \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. Your \r\nelection, which the Niger welcomes with pride, is \r\nwithout a doubt both recognition and endorsement of \r\nyour exceptional abilities as a seasoned diplomat, \r\nwhich you have demonstrated throughout your \r\ndistinguished career. We in the Niger are well placed to \r\nattest to your commitment to the cause of Africa and of \r\nour common subregion, specifically through the \r\nCommunity of Sahel-Saharan States, that other forum \r\nin which our countries work together for the same \r\ngoals that are enshrined in the Charter of the United \r\nNations. Thus we consider ourselves to be in your good \r\nhands, ready to advance the work of the Organization \r\nin this time of formidable challenges. \r\n I should like to renew our congratulations to the \r\noutgoing President, Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann, \r\non his active and very full presidency, and to state that \r\nthe Niger was honoured to serve alongside him in its \r\ncapacity as Vice-President at the sixty-third session. \r\n On behalf of the Niger, I should like to reiterate \r\nour profound gratitude to Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon for his unflagging efforts to make the United \r\nNations a more just and effective Organization, able to \r\nmeet the expectations of its Members. \r\n My delegation welcomes your decision, Sir, to \r\ndeclare as the very apt theme for the Assembly’s \r\ncurrent session the strengthening of multilateralism and \r\ndialogue among civilizations for international peace, \r\nsecurity and development. In our view, this theme has \r\nthe potential to spur Member States to greater initiative \r\nin realizing the goals that we are pursuing, namely, \r\nthose of preserving international peace and security. \r\nWe are pleased, in this regard, by the renewed \r\ndynamism in cooperation between the Security Council \r\nand regional organizations, in particular the African \r\nUnion. We believe that this direction has the potential \r\n A/64/PV.11\r\n \r\n27 09-52598 \r\n \r\nto lead to lasting solutions to the problems of peace \r\nand security in Africa. \r\n We are convinced that such cooperation will yield \r\nresults even on the most delicate issues, such as the \r\nimplementation of the political-legal concept of the \r\nprinciple of universal jurisdiction. While my delegation \r\nwelcomes the inclusion of this topic in the agenda of \r\nthe General Assembly, we should like once again to \r\nendorse the concerns already expressed by the African \r\nUnion and to urge Member States to avoid using this \r\nprinciple inappropriately. We hope that our debate in \r\nthis common forum will make possible a better \r\nunderstanding of this concept and a better definition of \r\nthe framework governing its eventual application. \r\n We note the progress that is being made in \r\nvarious areas in the prevention and management of \r\nconflicts, both in Africa and elsewhere. And we \r\nwelcome the commitment and goodwill of all parties \r\ncarrying out concerted actions to ensure international \r\npeace and security. \r\n The recommendations of the special summit on \r\nconflict prevention and management held in Tripoli \r\nreflect the will of African leaders to take on issues that \r\nhave always slowed our continent in its march towards \r\nprogress and prosperity. It is at this level that the theme \r\nof multilateralism — which you, Mr. President, have \r\nselected for the sixty-fourth session — takes on all its \r\nmeaning. Indeed, the United Nations, as the common \r\nframework enjoying the highest level of participation \r\nby countries and other actors in the world, should serve \r\nas a laboratory in which we work towards the goal of a \r\nmore balanced international community. \r\n Governed as it is by the laws of globalization, the \r\ncurrent international scene is, as we know, much more \r\ncomplex today than in the past. We must address and \r\nmanage the consequences of the international financial \r\ncrisis and, for countries in the Sahel such as the Niger, \r\nthe recurrent effects of food insecurity. We must \r\naddress climate change in a concerted and coordinated \r\nmanner, and we must constantly question the current \r\nformulas for preventing conflict and maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security.  \r\n My delegation supports such initiatives, which \r\nmust be inclusive, because they must benefit from the \r\ncontributions and perspectives of everyone, including \r\nthe most vulnerable countries. In particular, we support \r\nthe various discussions under way on this subject, \r\nwhether in the General Assembly, the Economic and \r\nSocial Council or the Security Council, or even in the \r\ncontext of specific initiatives such as the discussions \r\nbeing held by Canada on peacekeeping operations. \r\n We in the Niger have made undeniable progress \r\nin the area of combating poverty and promoting basic \r\ndevelopment, thanks to the bold actions of the \r\nPresident. Through projects designed specifically to \r\nmeet the needs of Niger’s people, he has enabled our \r\ncountry to finally give meaning to development. Today, \r\ndevelopment is palpable in every corner of the Niger \r\nbecause of proactive and systematic efforts to build \r\nclassrooms and health clinics, dig wells, build local \r\ndrinking water systems and promote a microcredit \r\nsystem designed specifically for the most vulnerable \r\nrural women. The head of State is doing this to \r\nimprove the living conditions of our people, who \r\nsuffered from the political instability that characterized \r\nour country during the 1990s, which one could \r\ndescribe as a lost decade for Niger’s development. In \r\nlate August, a meeting was held in Niamey for the \r\nsecond 2009 review by the Poverty Reduction and \r\nGrowth Facility of the International Monetary Fund. \r\nThe Niger’s performance in those areas was \r\nacknowledged and commended at the meeting, which \r\nbrought together representatives of the World Bank and \r\nof our country’s Ministry of Economy and Finance. \r\n I recall these aspects of the situation in Niger \r\nbecause, as members are aware, a referendum was held \r\nin our country on 4 August 2009 to adopt a new \r\nconstitution. It formalizes the return to a presidential \r\nAdministration more suited to the realities of our \r\ncountry and introduces new provisions such as that \r\nestablishing two chambers, Parliament and the Senate. \r\nThe referendum, held in an atmosphere of calm and \r\ntransparency by the National Independent Electoral \r\nCommission, enabled us to adopt the new constitution, \r\nwhich formalizes the arrival of the sixth Republic.  \r\n Therefore, I wish to take this opportunity to \r\nreassure the international community, development \r\npartners, civil society and other actors and entities that \r\nmay be justifiably concerned about the political \r\nsituation in the Niger that the country is not in a \r\nsituation of lawlessness or insurrection, as some would \r\nhave one believe, but rather is a place where all people \r\nfreely express their opinions within the framework of \r\nthe democratic process, to which we are deeply \r\ncommitted. \r\nA/64/PV.11  \r\n \r\n09-52598 28 \r\n \r\n The sovereign people of the Niger have chosen to \r\nrefashion the Republic around certain values with \r\nwhich they identify. In this new endeavour, President \r\nMamadou Tandja has solemnly pledged that no group \r\nor structure will be overlooked. Following the \r\nreferendum, the President recalled his willingness to \r\nwork with all citizens of the Niger in the interest of the \r\ncountry and its people. The forthcoming legislative \r\nelections, to be held on 20 October, and the municipal \r\nelections in December 2009 will be opportunities for \r\nlarge-scale mobilization to ensure better representation \r\nfor the people in the conduct of State affairs. It is this \r\nreality of a Niger marching towards development, \r\nresolutely committed to building its future and more \r\ndetermined than ever to lift its people out of poverty, \r\nthat we must bear in mind. \r\n We fully support any joint action that can \r\ncontribute to general and complete disarmament. We \r\nhave been at the forefront in fulfilling our \r\ncommitments in this area, and we are resolved to \r\ncontinue to work in that regard within our modest \r\nmeans. Our most recent initiative was to ratify the \r\nConvention on Cluster Munitions on 14 May 2009 — a \r\nformality that made the Niger one of the very first \r\ncountries to do so and accelerated its entry into force. \r\nWe believe that this gesture, although it may seem \r\nminor, assumes its full meaning in the context of the \r\ndifficult path towards complete disarmament. For us, \r\nthis initiative, together with our country’s ratification \r\nof the Convention on Small Arms and Light Weapons, \r\nTheir Ammunition and Other Related Materials, \r\nadopted by the Economic Community of West African \r\nStates, is a significant contribution to disarmament at \r\nour level. \r\n We are following the various processes carried \r\nout at various levels to reform the United Nations \r\nsystem. This includes reform of the Security Council, \r\nwith regard to which we call for greater recognition of \r\nAfrica’s role through the Ezulwini Consensus; the \r\nongoing preparations to ensure the success of the \r\nUnited Nations climate change conference in \r\nCopenhagen; and the summit convened by the \r\nSecretary-General and just concluded here in New \r\nYork, which benefited from the valuable guidance of \r\nheads of State and Government. In addition, there is \r\nUnited Nations system-wide coherence; the definition \r\nof the new concept of the responsibility to protect, \r\nwhich needs to be clearly defined and set out, as in the \r\nConstitutive Act of the African Union; and, finally, the \r\nfollow-up to the outcome document of the Conference \r\non the World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its \r\nImpact on Development, which the previous President \r\nof the General Assembly wished to begin by appointing \r\nfacilitators. \r\n With regard to all those issues and many other \r\nimportant concerns, such as those referred to in the \r\noutcome document of the Follow-up International \r\nConference on Financing for Development to Review \r\nthe Implementation of the Monterrey Consensus, held \r\nat Doha at the end of 2008, we wish to express once \r\nagain our ongoing concern that we should develop an \r\ninclusive and transparent approach at all levels that \r\ntakes into account the concerns of both large and small \r\ncountries.  \r\n We are following with great interest, and often \r\nconcern, the progress of the commitments made within \r\nthe framework of the Millennium Development Goals, \r\nand we note that it remains mixed. At the same time, \r\nadverse phenomena are placing constraints on both \r\ndeveloped and developing countries, such as the world \r\neconomic and financial crisis. These problems now \r\nrequire that all of us redouble our efforts to keep our \r\ncommitments. In that regard, we will closely follow the \r\npreparations for the 2010 mid-term review conference, \r\nwhich, we hope, will result in efforts to accelerate the \r\nattainment of the agreed objectives. We also take this \r\nopportunity to reaffirm the irreplaceable nature of the \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development as a \r\nrelevant African initiative that must enjoy the support \r\nof the United Nations and of the international \r\ncommunity as a whole.  \r\n We welcome the decision to convene the Fourth \r\nUnited Nations Conference on the Least Developed \r\nCountries, and we salute the host country, Turkey, for \r\nits generous initiative vis-à-vis our group of countries. \r\nWe also thank other countries and partner organizations \r\nwhich have always remained sensitive to the many \r\nconstraints and concerns of our countries. We also \r\nknow that, if significant progress has been made in \r\n10 years in recognizing our difficult conditions and \r\nestablishing useful partnerships in that regard, it is \r\nthanks to the coordination of the Office of the High \r\nRepresentative for the Least Developed Countries, \r\nLandlocked Developing Countries and Small Island \r\nDeveloping States. We thank him for his initiatives, \r\nwhich remain essential for least developed and \r\nlandlocked countries in the Sahel, such as the Niger.  \r\n A/64/PV.11\r\n \r\n29 09-52598 \r\n \r\n I should also like to express my Government’s \r\nappreciation to the President of the General Assembly \r\nfor his decision to devote part of this session to the \r\nsubject of the dialogue among cultures and \r\ncivilizations. We believe that that issue is worthy of \r\nmuch attention and of action throughout the sixty-\r\nfourth session. Indeed, we must maintain the \r\nmomentum begun by eminent Member States through \r\nthe Third Ministerial Meeting on Interfaith Dialogue \r\nand Cooperation for Peace, held in 2008; the High-\r\nLevel Dialogue on Interreligious and Intercultural \r\nUnderstanding and Cooperation for Peace; and the \r\ninternational conference on dialogue among \r\ncivilizations and cultural diversity, held from 2 to  \r\n4 June 2009 in Kairouan, Tunisia. We must develop \r\nthese initiatives, for which my delegation reiterates its \r\ncongratulations to the Governments of the countries \r\nconcerned.  \r\n Along the same lines, my delegation applauds the \r\nGovernment of the Philippines, which has decided to \r\norganize a special meeting at the ministerial level for \r\nthe countries of the Non-Aligned Movement, under the \r\ntheme “Interreligious Dialogue and Cooperation for \r\nPeace and Development”, from 1 to 3 December 2009 \r\nin Manila. That shows that the theme continues to draw \r\nthe interest of many States and that you, Mr. President, \r\nwere aptly inspired in identifying it as a topic of \r\ninterest for the international community. \r\n I would like to conclude my statement by \r\nrenewing my delegation’s delight at the direction that \r\nyou, Sir, have suggested for the current Assembly \r\nsession and by reiterating our full confidence in your \r\nleadership, which promises a very fruitful and dynamic \r\nterm in the pursuit of common objectives of the \r\ninternational community. As always, you can count on \r\nthe unflagging support and readiness of the \r\nGovernment of the Niger throughout your term. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ghazi Salahuddin Atabani, Adviser \r\nto the President of the Republic of the Sudan. \r\n Mr. Atabani (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): It is my \r\npleasure at the outset to convey the best wishes of the \r\nGovernment and people of the Sudan for successful \r\ndeliberations in the sixty-fourth session of the General \r\nAssembly on its entire agenda. The agenda contains \r\ntopics reflecting the challenges faced by the \r\ninternational community and the priorities we have to \r\nset, such as the development and welfare of our \r\npeoples, the implementation of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), the mitigation of \r\neconomic and financial crises, containing the effects of \r\nclimate change and maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity. \r\n I am also pleased to extend warm congratulations \r\nto Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at this important \r\nsession. We are confident, Sir, that your political skills \r\nand diplomatic expertise will help realize our \r\nambitions to have an able, effective and transparent \r\nUnited Nations. We also wish to commend the \r\ndexterity and high competence with which your \r\npredecessor, Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann, conducted \r\nthe proceedings of the previous session. We also wish \r\nto commend the Secretary-General for the efforts \r\nundertaken by the Secretariat to fulfil the role and \r\nresponsibilities of the United Nations. \r\n Millions throughout the world look forward to \r\nour deliberations in the wake of the suffocating crises \r\nthrough which the international community is passing. \r\nTraces of the crises are still lingering in the family of \r\nnations, especially in the developing countries, while \r\nthe fruits of scientific and technological progress \r\nnourish the hope of better opportunities for a just and \r\nequitable world order. \r\n While non-compliance with the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter and \r\ninternational law and its established rules, along with \r\ndouble standards, has made the world less safe, the \r\neconomic and financial crises have exacerbated the \r\nchallenges. The world is experiencing the worst and \r\ngravest economic and financial crisis since the \r\nDepression of the 1930s. The crisis is compounded by \r\nsuch numerous and intertwined problems as the food \r\ncrisis and climate change along with their destructive \r\neffects on the developing countries and threats to their \r\nnational priorities and to the gains they have made \r\ntowards the achievement of the MDGs. \r\n In its chairmanship of the Group of 77 and China, \r\nthe Sudan has accorded special attention to the \r\nrepercussions of this crisis on the developing countries. \r\nIn those countries the crisis has given rise to poverty, \r\nhunger, unemployment and slackening of growth, if not \r\neconomic downturn, and has adversely affected \r\nbalances of trade and of payment. At the same time, the \r\ncrisis has led to falls in commodity prices, sharp \r\nfluctuations in exchange rates, sudden diversions of \r\nA/64/PV.11  \r\n \r\n09-52598 30 \r\n \r\ncapital flows and of foreign direct investment, falls in \r\nremittances and drops in tourism revenues. \r\nConcomitantly, the social sector has suffered greatly \r\nbecause of the erosion of social security networks that \r\nprovide health, education and other services. That in \r\nturn has augmented infant and maternal mortality rates. \r\n The Group of 77 and China is deeply concerned \r\nover this crisis and its impact on countries facing \r\nspecial challenges, foremost among which are African \r\nStates, the least developed countries, small island \r\nStates and countries emerging from conflict. The \r\nrealities impose a moral duty on us — especially the \r\nindustrial countries — to channel our collective \r\nresponse into a strong commitment to providing the \r\nrequired solutions. Those include direct funding, \r\ncapacity-building, promoting sustainable development, \r\naddressing debt problems, eliminating obstacles to \r\ntrade and investment and States meeting their \r\ninternational development pledges. \r\n Comprehensive reform of the international \r\nfinancial and economic system and ensuring an \r\nenhanced role for the developing countries in decision-\r\nmaking processes in international financial institutions \r\nare of central significance. Major industrial countries \r\ncannot ignore the universal legitimacy of the collective \r\nvoice of the world’s States here at the United Nations. \r\nIn this connection, the open-ended working group of \r\nthe General Assembly to follow up on the issues \r\ncontained in the Outcome of the Conference on the \r\nWorld Economic and Financial Crisis and Its Impact on \r\nDevelopment (resolution 63/303, annex), held in New \r\nYork in June 2009, must discharge its work and \r\nmandate expeditiously. \r\n By the same token, we hope that endeavours to \r\ndeal with climate change in the course of the \r\nconference to be held in Copenhagen in December of \r\nthis year will be crowned with success. The developing \r\ncountries — which were by no means responsible for \r\nclimate change and global warming — urge \r\nindustrialized countries, on the basis of their historic \r\nresponsibility, to address the root causes of climate \r\nchange by providing new and additional predictable \r\nfinancial resources, to help build capacities, to transfer, \r\nentrench and develop technology and to fulfil relevant \r\nobligations and pledges with a view to attaining \r\nsustainable economic growth that satisfies the \r\nlegitimate priorities and needs of the developing \r\ncountries. As Chair of the Group of 77 and China, my \r\ncountry will spare no effort in furthering those \r\ndemands. \r\n The absence of democracy in international \r\nrelations, as exemplified by the present form and \r\ncomposition of the Security Council, has become a \r\nmajor factor in diminishing the ability of the United \r\nNations to respond to the structural and substantive \r\nchallenges and changes in the international community. \r\nThat has been exacerbated by unilateral sanctions that \r\nhinder international trade and investment and violate \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and the rules of \r\ninternational law.  \r\n The United Nations rostrum is being used by \r\nsome to serve narrow interests such that the concept of \r\nhuman rights has become a tool for ceaseless \r\npoliticization and score settling. In the same vein, the \r\noften misused concept of terrorism has led to the \r\nvictim being equated with the aggressor, as is currently \r\nevident in the plight of the Palestinian people, who are \r\nstill chafing under the yoke of occupation. As a result, \r\nthe Palestinian question has remained unsolved, which \r\nhas gravely compromised the reputation and credibility \r\nof the United Nations. \r\n It is thus clear that for the United Nations to \r\neffectively serve a changing world, it has to effect an \r\nall-out change in its working methods and approaches \r\nso that it will truly express the voice of all nations. \r\nConsequently, my country, like all other developing \r\nnations, supports the call to reactivate the role of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and to reform the Security Council, \r\nbased on the well-known African position on this \r\nmatter. \r\n This session is of special importance to my \r\ncountry for it comes at a time when we are putting an \r\nend to what has been called the longest civil war in \r\nAfrica by concluding the Comprehensive Peace \r\nAgreement. The Agreement adopts a system making \r\ncitizenship a basis for rights and duties, and espousing \r\ndiversity as a source of unity and brotherhood built on \r\nthe rule of law, good governance, respect for freedoms \r\nand human rights, as well as fair and democratic \r\npower-sharing. \r\n Additionally, the Agreement establishes the \r\nprinciples of wealth sharing, in line with the norms of \r\nequity and equality. The implementation of the \r\nAgreement has proceeded with the completion of the \r\nformation of relevant mechanisms and institutions, \r\nalong with the full commitment by the two parties to \r\n A/64/PV.11\r\n \r\n31 09-52598 \r\n \r\nthe Agreement to the sound treatment of the question \r\nof entitlements as reflected in the handling of the \r\nquestion of Abyei. \r\n We note here the fact that donors have not \r\nfulfilled the development resources and pledges they \r\ntook upon themselves in support of the Agreement has \r\nadversely affected its implementation, particularly in \r\nthe spheres of development, rehabilitation and \r\nreintegration of former combatants in society. We \r\ntherefore urge the fulfilment of all pledges so as to \r\nfoster peace and stability, as well as the reconstruction \r\nof the country after the ravages of years of war, so that \r\npeace can be meaningful. \r\n After conducting a population census — the \r\naccuracy and credibility of which were testified to by \r\nnumerous international and regional institutions, \r\nincluding the United Nations — and in conformity with \r\nthe Agreement, we are about to hold general legislative \r\nand executive elections. We assert our resolve and \r\ndetermination to hold them in April 2010, while we \r\ncontinue to strengthen efforts aimed at political reform, \r\nwhich is indispensable for founding a durable peace. \r\nWe invite the international community, including the \r\nUnited Nations, to support the holding of elections in \r\nword and deed. \r\n Despite all the positive developments in the peace \r\nprocess, we note with profound concern the recent \r\narmed tribal conflicts in southern Sudan. Those \r\nconflicts threaten not only the stability of the Sudan \r\nand the South but also the stability of the whole region. \r\nWe would like to recall here that, in accordance with \r\nthe Agreement, the responsibility for the maintenance \r\nof peace in the South lies with the Government of \r\nSouthern Sudan. Therefore, it is everybody’s duty to \r\nurge and encourage the Government of Southern Sudan \r\nto discharge its duty for the sake of its citizens’ \r\nsecurity and prosperity. \r\n Our people have recognized that peace will not be \r\ncomplete unless it extends to our people in Darfur. The \r\nsigning of the Darfur Peace Agreement in Abuja under \r\nthe gracious aegis of the African Union affirmed the \r\nGovernment’s serious commitment to resolving the \r\nproblem of Darfur peacefully. \r\n While we were earnestly attempting to implement \r\nthat Agreement, certain international parties did not \r\nfulfil their pledges and obligations in strict application \r\nof the Agreement, such as by applying unwarranted \r\npressure on the wrong side. Instead of pressuring the \r\nparties that shied away from the peace option, pressure \r\nwas put on the Abuja signatories themselves. That \r\nhampered peace endeavours and led to the protraction \r\nof the conflict. \r\n Yet, thanks to the steadfast maintenance of the \r\nAgreement by our Government and people and our \r\nrelentless efforts to achieve peace, we are now seeing \r\npositive and far-reaching developments leading \r\ntowards lasting peace in Darfur, thanks also to the \r\ncomplete commitment shown by the National Unity \r\nGovernment and its close cooperation with the African \r\nUnion-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur \r\nthrough the Tripartite Mechanism. \r\n That policy has led to far-reaching improvements \r\nin the humanitarian situation in Darfur, as recognized \r\nand attested to by United Nations reports. That is \r\nfurther supported by our scrupulous commitment to the \r\nhumanitarian agreement signed last April with the \r\nUnited States Special Envoy to the Sudan. We reiterate \r\nour commitment to close cooperation with the United \r\nNations and with national and international \r\norganizations with a view to enhancing and developing \r\nthat policy in a manner that prevents any humanitarian \r\ndisaster or even food gaps in the future. \r\n In this connection, it is imperative to note the \r\nmassive return of internally displaced persons (IDPs) \r\nto their villages, which makes it incumbent on the \r\nGovernment, the Sudanese people and the international \r\ncommunity to seize this opportunity to foster this \r\ntrend, as it is the real test of peace. \r\n We renew our commitment and preparedness to \r\nwork expeditiously and at all times to ensure the \r\nsuccess of the forthcoming negotiations in Doha within \r\nthe framework of the Afro-Arab initiative and the \r\nefforts of the Joint Mediator, in accordance with the \r\ndecision taken by the initiatives committee in its \r\nmeeting held at the margins of this session. \r\n We welcome the declaration made by the \r\nAmerican President, Barack Obama, before the General \r\nAssembly, on his country’s readiness to help find \r\nsolutions to the problems of Darfur. Noting the positive \r\ntone in the statements voiced by the American \r\nPresident towards developing countries in general, we \r\nhope that his words will be translated into action and \r\nsincere effort in order to correct the misguided policies \r\nand positions of the previous American Administration, \r\nwhich have compromised bilateral relations and \r\naggravated the region’s problems. This, undoubtedly, \r\nA/64/PV.11  \r\n \r\n09-52598 32 \r\n \r\nrequires, first and foremost, lifting the unilateral \r\nsanctions and removing the name of the Sudan from \r\nthe United States’ list of terrorist States. \r\n We renew our appeal to the armed groups to \r\nmuster the will for a solution and for involvement in \r\nthe peace process, so that the interests of the Sudanese \r\npeople are put first and foremost. The people of the \r\nSudan are more than capable of solving their own \r\nproblems. My country has repeatedly declared its \r\ncommitment to a unilateral ceasefire as an initiative for \r\nconfidence-building and bringing about successful \r\nnegotiations, and we hope that armed factions will \r\nrespond positively so that a permanently monitored \r\nceasefire can be reached. \r\n The international community, which has, in the \r\npast, promised to take stringent measures against those \r\nwho refused to take part in the peace talks or impede \r\nthem, has to do so in deed and not just in word. The \r\nquestion of development, recovery, rehabilitation and \r\nreconstruction should be given special attention, as \r\ncalled for in Security Council resolution 1769 (2007). \r\nThere should be a transition from providing emergency \r\nhumanitarian assistance to supporting development, in \r\norder to facilitate the return and settlement of IDPs and \r\nrefugees. \r\n From this rostrum, I wish to assert my country’s \r\nkeen interest in having constructive relations with all \r\nits neighbours and its full readiness for complete \r\ncooperation with them, with a view to extinguishing all \r\nregional hot beds of tension. In this regard, I would \r\nlike to stress our preparedness and willingness to \r\nnormalize relations with Chad, in conformity with all \r\nagreements and instruments signed with them and we \r\nhope they will demonstrate the same determination and \r\nreadiness. \r\n At a time when the Government of National \r\nUnity had made remarkable progress in the \r\nimplementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement \r\nand when the Sudan had started a new phase towards \r\nthe achievement of political reform and transformation, \r\npeaceful devolution of authority, progress towards \r\nending disputes and infighting and towards the \r\nachievement of inclusive development for our people, \r\nthe President of the Republic himself, who is the chief \r\nguarantor of the Sudan’s sovereignty, was targeted by \r\nso-called international justice in a futile attempt to \r\nundermine stability and development. The Sudanese \r\nrejected this, as did the international community, \r\nincluding regional and international organizations. \r\n We emphasize that the realization of security and \r\nstability in Darfur requires speedy correction of those \r\ndevelopments and a renewed commitment to the peace \r\nprocess and the avoidance of all that may have a \r\nnegative impact on peace in the Sudan and the African \r\ncontinent. \r\n Between the signing of the United Nations Charter \r\nin the middle of the last century and the momentous \r\ndevelopments and profound challenges currently \r\nexperienced by the world, much water has flown under \r\nthe bridge of international relations, which makes \r\nannual General Assembly sessions serious opportunities \r\nfor introspection and for gleaning lessons. \r\n Let us renew our resolve to foster multilateral \r\naction, for which this Organization stands. Let our \r\nsixty-fourth session be a defining point towards \r\nachieving our collective aspirations for a world where \r\nthe values of fraternity and common destiny prevail. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now call on \r\nMr. Alexis Thambwe Mwamba, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. \r\n Mr. Thambwe Mwamba (Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo) (spoke in French): Mr. President, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Joseph Kabila Kabange, President of \r\nthe Republic, is unable to attend but has instructed me \r\nto convey to you his most heartfelt congratulations on \r\nyour election to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-fourth session. The head of State \r\nhas no doubt that your vast experience in the \r\nOrganization, broadened by your talents and your \r\nknowledge, will help you to overcome the myriad of \r\nchallenges that come with your new office. He \r\nexpresses his wish also for every success in your work \r\nat this regular session. \r\n Let me, as I begin my statement, commend your \r\npredecessor, Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann, and \r\nexpress to him our gratitude for his excellent service as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-third \r\nsession, which has just been completed, and this to the \r\nsatisfaction of all Member States.  \r\n Lastly, I pay well-deserved tribute to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Mr. Ban Ki-moon for his commitment to the \r\nquest for peace and security worldwide, in general, and \r\nfor his very commendable involvement in restoring \r\n A/64/PV.11\r\n \r\n33 09-52598 \r\n \r\nlasting peace in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \r\nmy country, in particular. \r\n At this time when the sixty-fourth regular session \r\nof the General Assembly is beginning, it is worth \r\ndwelling on the situation currently prevailing in certain \r\nregions of the planet. In the Middle East, the situation \r\ncontinues to be tenuous and to be the focus of attention \r\nof the global public. The Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo recognizes the right of the people of Israel to \r\nlive in peace in a State with internationally recognized \r\nborders, just as it would like to reiterate that the \r\nsettlement of this conflict specifically entails \r\nrecognition of the fact that the Palestinian question is \r\nat the heart of the very problem in the Middle East.  \r\n The situations in Afghanistan and in Iraq continue \r\nto be of concern. The Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo urges the international community to eradicate \r\nthe scourge of terrorism, so that those two countries \r\ncan fully return to their place on the international \r\nscene. \r\n In Africa, and speaking just about our own \r\ngeographic area in the central and southern portion of \r\nthe continent, we would like to refer to the healthy \r\nprogress made in the implementation of the agreements \r\nreached in 2006 between the Government of Burundi \r\nand the Forces Nationales de Libération; the smooth \r\nevolution of the inclusive political dialogue in the \r\nCentral African Republic; the needed promotion of \r\ngood-neighbourly relations between Chad and the \r\nSudan; the admittedly slow but sure and determined \r\npromotion of democracy; and the consolidation of \r\npeace and stability in Southern Africa. \r\n I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely \r\nthank the South African facilitation, the Economic \r\nCommunity of Central African States, the Southern \r\nAfrican Development Community (SADC) and the \r\ninternational community, as well as other bilateral and \r\nmultilateral partners, for the efforts that they have \r\ncontinued to make to achieve the considerable progress \r\nthat we hail today.  \r\n With respect to the Republic of Madagascar, I \r\nwould particularly like to express my full satisfaction \r\nwith the mediation by the eminent SADC representative \r\nwith respect to the political dialogue. Here, I would \r\nlike to reiterate the SADC position, which rejects and \r\ncondemns any unilateral decision that would violate \r\nthe spirit of the Maputo agreements.  \r\n No social or economic order remains safe, if it \r\nfails to bring beneficial effects to the greatest number \r\nof people. The crisis of the global financial system \r\ncontinues to undermine global economies worldwide, \r\nbe they developed or developing. For my country, in \r\nparticular, this crisis has led to a significant drop in \r\nexport commodity prices, declining currency reserves, \r\nthe growing cost of imports, with a depreciation of the \r\nnational currency, declining growth rates and a decline \r\nin budget and tax revenues. \r\n The consequences of this turn of events are \r\nconsiderable. This crisis has led to a shortfall in \r\nresources to finance infrastructure. It has led to broad \r\njob loss, worsening of social conflict, and, particularly \r\nat a time when we are coming out of a complex \r\nconflict, a shrinking budget to finance the necessary \r\nrestoration of State authority throughout the national \r\nterritory in order to complete the establishment of \r\npeace. It is urgently necessary therefore to review the \r\ninternational financial system. \r\n The Democratic Republic of the Congo is aware \r\nthat we will need colossal resources to ensure \r\nsustainable development in a world context that has \r\nseen surging food and energy prices and a global \r\nfinancial crisis. These phenomena are compounded by \r\nthe effects of climate change. That is why I welcome \r\nthe holding by the Secretary-General on 22 September \r\n2009 of the high-level event on this issue. If we do not \r\nmake decisions on the fate of present and future \r\ngenerations with respect to global warming and climate \r\nchange and if we are not able to prevent rising sea \r\nlevels, desertification or the extinction of species and \r\nthe loss of biodiversity, inter alia, our world will \r\ninevitably move towards the risk of a disaster for \r\nwhich the African continent will be the first to bear the \r\ncosts.  \r\n The issue of adopting a post-Kyoto agreement \r\nthat would require polluter countries to reduce their \r\ngreenhouse gas emissions and financially compensate \r\nthose who have forests needs to be seriously considered. \r\n The Democratic Republic of the Congo accounts \r\nfor more than half of the forests in the Congo basin, \r\nwhich is the second largest in the world after the \r\nAmazon region. This area has an enormous asset that it \r\nwill defend at the Conference of the Parties to the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange, scheduled for December 2009 in Copenhagen.  \r\nA/64/PV.11  \r\n \r\n09-52598 34 \r\n \r\n With respect to reform of the United Nations \r\nsystem, the Democratic Republic of the Congo agrees \r\nwith the view that the current United Nations system is \r\nno longer, in its current design, in keeping with the \r\nexpectations of those who promote it or even with the \r\nletter of Charter, which is its inspiration. That is why \r\nwe would like to reiterate our plea for the full \r\nrepresentation of Africa in the decision-making bodies, \r\nand more specifically in the Security Council.  \r\n Regardless of the outcome of the current \r\nnegotiations on this matter, my delegation continues to \r\nbe of the view that any viable reform of the Security \r\nCouncil must take into account the political and \r\nnumerical weight of Africa in the General Assembly, \r\nespecially since two thirds of the situations before the \r\nSecurity Council involve Africa.  \r\n With respect to the responsibility to protect, we \r\nbelieve that it is up to each State to protect its people \r\nfrom genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity or \r\nethnic cleansing. We are also of the view that the \r\nprincipal role of the international community in these \r\nareas should be to determine how to build institutional \r\ncapacities and provide substantial assistance to States, \r\nmore specifically to the Administrations of countries in \r\npost-conflict situations, so that they can acquire the \r\nmeans to ensure that they have the resources to provide \r\nthis protection.  \r\n I have very succinctly addressed the major \r\nchallenges that today’s world faces and for which we \r\nneed to build a common response. I have talked about \r\nreform of the United Nations and about the \r\nresponsibility to protect. I have not addressed the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo or the troubled \r\nregion of the African Great Lakes. Three years after the \r\nsuccess of the electoral operations in 2006, the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo is now, at long last, \r\nfacing the trying process of normalizing democratic \r\nlife. We understand that restoring the rule of law is an \r\nurgent priority. \r\n In that context, peace and stability can only \r\npersist if the citizens realize that politically sensitive \r\nissues can be resolved by legitimate and fair means. \r\nThe rule of law cannot go hand in hand with \r\ncorruption. It is no exaggeration to assert that the \r\nefforts initiated recently by the President of the \r\nRepublic and the Government to fight corruption and \r\nto put an end to the rule of impunity have begun to \r\nbear fruit. However, we accept that much remains to be \r\ndone in terms of capacity-building to ensure proper \r\nadministration of justice. \r\n The Congolese experience of the 2006 \r\ndemocratic elections was built on a difficult legacy of \r\nthe dark years of foreign occupation followed by an \r\ninternal rift, the consequences of which are still seen \r\ntoday in the ongoing use of rape as a weapon of war. \r\nTo address that situation, at the request of the \r\nCongolese authorities, the first investigation of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court began by considering the \r\nserious crimes that had been committed on the territory \r\nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo since 1 July \r\n2002. The rest is well known: the first three cases \r\nbefore the International Criminal Court are based on \r\nthat submission and the national courts have also been \r\ncalled upon to work on those issues. \r\n The Congolese courts currently involved are \r\ncertainly already playing an important role in restoring \r\nthe rule of law, but a successful transition from war to \r\npeace, from a divided past to a shared future, cannot be \r\nenvisaged for the people of the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo without a mechanism that can bring a sense \r\nof justice to all citizens, establish or renew civic trust, \r\nrestore the duty of memory and reconcile the people \r\nand the communities. \r\n The sexual violence perpetrated against women \r\nand girls in the eastern part of Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo is, in our view, the most shameful and \r\ngravest crime witnessed by humankind in the twenty-\r\nfirst century. Statistically, 80 per cent of the crimes \r\ncommitted in the entire country took place mainly in \r\nthe two provinces in the East of the country most \r\naffected by the effects of war, namely South and North \r\nKivu. In fact, 60 per cent of the rapes were committed \r\nin North Kivu and 20 per cent in South Kivu. Justice \r\nmust be done to the women and girls who have been \r\nraped. \r\n I can already attest to the strong resolve of His \r\nExcellency President Joseph Kabila Kabange to put an \r\nend to impunity for the perpetrators of those heinous \r\ncrimes, whether civilian or military. Despite the \r\napocalyptic picture, the situation that persists in the \r\nEast of my country continues to improve. \r\n In conformity with the relevant provisions of the \r\nPact on Security, Stability and Development in the \r\nGreat Lakes Region, the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo, working with Rwanda and Uganda respectively, \r\nlaunched joint military operations last year and early \r\n A/64/PV.11\r\n \r\n35 09-52598 \r\n \r\nthis year with a view to disarming and, where \r\nnecessary, forcing the rebels of the Lord’s Resistance \r\nArmy, on the one hand, and those of the Forces \r\ndémocratiques de libération du Rwanda (FDLR), on the \r\nother, to return to their respective countries. As part of \r\nthe same military operations, called Kimia II, the \r\nForces armées de la République démocratique du \r\nCongo (FARDC) are carrying out an offensive against \r\nthe elements of the FDLR that have remained in the \r\nmountains of South Kivu, in order to bring peace to \r\nthat region.  \r\n The results, I repeat, are positive. By way of \r\nillustration, the authority of the State has been restored; \r\nthe FDLR command posts in North and South Kivu \r\nhave been destroyed; more and more FDLR troops are \r\nsurrendering to the FARDC and to the United Nations \r\nObserver Mission in the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo (MONUC); several FDLR elements have \r\nreturned to their country of origin; all the \r\ncommunication and supply lines in North and South \r\nKivu are now open; the fight against the illegal \r\nexploitation of natural resources and the protection of \r\nVirunga National Park have been strengthened; and the \r\nincidents of rape and all other forms of sexual violence \r\nagainst women have seen an appreciable decline.  \r\n Peace is gradually being established to the great \r\nbenefit of the Congolese people. Moreover, fruitful \r\ntalks aimed at benefiting our bilateral and multilateral \r\nrelations with Burundi, Uganda and Rwanda are under \r\nway, and the future looks better. \r\n The return to normalcy in our subregion is \r\nenabling us to make efforts towards the urgent \r\npeacebuilding and economic recovery of the country. \r\nAs the President of the Republic continues to \r\nunderscore, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has \r\nresolutely undertaken to strengthen and promote the \r\nideals of national reconciliation, peace, democracy and \r\ngood governance within its borders, and is \r\nunquestionably committed to a policy of openness \r\nwithout exclusion based on dialogue and cooperation \r\nof all kinds with all countries that favour peace and \r\ndialogue. Our wish today is to see the international \r\ncommunity step up its efforts and continue to support \r\nthe process of bringing about peace and unity. \r\n On the elections, my country is preparing to hold \r\ncity, municipal and local elections, which represents a \r\ngreat meeting of the people with its history. The steps \r\nto update the national register of the Independent \r\nElectoral Commission started in the first half of 2009.  \r\n The Democratic Republic of the Congo is already \r\ninvolved in the reform of its institutions. It is important \r\nto conclude those various reforms, in particular in the \r\narea of the administration of justice. The Congolese \r\njustice system will be more effective and efficient if it \r\nhas the international community’s support, especially \r\nin terms of capacity-building. \r\n Reform of the security system is also under way. \r\nThe reform of the army and police services has had the \r\nconsistent support of bilateral partners and of the \r\nUnited Nations through MONUC, its Mission in the \r\nCongo. My country is firmly committed to working to \r\nsuccessfully conclude that reform aimed at ensuring \r\nnot only its peace, unity, territorial integrity, national \r\nsovereignty and stability but also those of the entire \r\nsubregion by preventing the reoccurrence of the \r\nsecurity problems and tensions seen there. \r\n In addition, the Government is doing its utmost, \r\nthrough duly identified ways to increase prosperity, to \r\nimplement programmes in order to meet the basic \r\nneeds of the people, in particular on health, education, \r\nfood self-sufficiency, basic infrastructure, electricity \r\nand drinking water for all, not to mention, of course, \r\nthe fight against malaria and HIV/AIDS as well as \r\npoverty alleviation.  \r\n Like other post-conflict countries, the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo underscores the urgent need to \r\norganize and hold an international conference on the \r\nfinancing of its reconstruction as soon as possible. For \r\nus, it is a question of building a new Congo, a nation \r\nopening up to the world at the centre of a continent full \r\nof change, a country where every foreigner, \r\nindiscriminately, can be free, assured of the protection \r\nof his investments, to work for his better future. All \r\nthat foreigners do to contribute to our development will \r\nbe duly acknowledged and appreciated. \r\n Emerging from a long war with many outside \r\nimplications, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \r\nmy country, is fully aware of the importance of \r\nregional cooperation. The most fervent wish of the \r\nCongolese people is to restore relations of trust and \r\ncooperation with all its neighbours, without exception. \r\nThe Government intends to pursue a policy of \r\ndialogue, openness, friendship, cooperation and good-\r\nneighbourliness, because the country has always \r\nstrived to work to bring about a more united Africa that \r\nA/64/PV.11  \r\n \r\n09-52598 36 \r\n \r\nstands together, distinct in its greater understanding, \r\ntolerance, peace and solidarity.  \r\n By way of conclusion, allow me to reiterate that \r\nso much war and fratricidal violence has taught us that \r\nthe most expensive peace is still less onerous than the \r\ncheapest war. In this regard, I appeal for international \r\nsolidarity during this stage of building our hard-won \r\npeace, for a peaceful and stable Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo is an asset to our planet’s common \r\ndestiny. \r\n I would be remiss if I did not conclude my \r\nstatement without thanking once again all those whose \r\ncommitment, courage and determination have helped \r\nand continue to help my country embrace the concepts \r\nof negotiation and peaceful settlement of crisis by \r\ncasting aside war and the use of force. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Yousef Bin Al-Alawi Bin Abdulla, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Sultanate of Oman. \r\n Mr. Abdulla (Oman) (spoke in Arabic): Allow \r\nme at the outset, Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, to \r\ncongratulate you and your fraternal country, the Great \r\nSocialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, on your \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-fourth session. We are confident that your \r\nexperience and knowledge of the role and influence of \r\nthe United Nations in international relations will play a \r\ngreat part in the success of the work of this session. I \r\nalso take this opportunity to express our thanks to your \r\npredecessor, His Excellency Father Miguel d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann of friendly Nicaragua, for his excellent \r\nefforts in guiding the work of the previous session. I \r\nwish also to express our appreciation to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his tireless efforts to enhance \r\nthe effectiveness of the Organization’s machinery. We \r\nwish him every success. \r\n There is no doubt that the United Nations has \r\nachieved much during its more than 60 years of joint \r\ninternational action. Its achievements have made a \r\npositive contribution to the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. The Organization has \r\nprovided technical assistance to developing countries \r\nin their socio-economic development projects, and has \r\nhelped to reach consensus on many political issues and \r\nconflicts, contributing to the development of \r\ninternational peacekeeping mechanisms. \r\n And yet the Palestinian issue remains unresolved \r\ndespite all the efforts of Arab countries and the \r\ninternational community. We believe that the Arab \r\nPeace Initiative and international peace efforts are the \r\nmost appropriate way to settle the Arab-Israeli conflict \r\non the basis of an end to occupation, the return of Arab \r\nlands occupied since 1967, the establishment of an \r\nindependent Palestinian State on the West Bank and \r\nGaza Strip with East Jerusalem as its capital and the \r\nremoval of all the illegal and illegitimate Israeli \r\nsettlements. This would indeed help to achieve \r\npeaceful coexistence and positive cooperation between \r\nArab States and Israel, and would contribute greatly to \r\nopening new horizons of cooperation, progress and \r\ndevelopment in the region and the world at large. Peace \r\nbased on those principles would be one of the most \r\nimportant achievements of the people of the region and \r\nwould pave the way towards ending regional crises and \r\neradicating the root causes of terrorism. \r\n We thus call on Israel to seize the historic \r\nInitiative and join the efforts to establish a just and \r\ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East, one that \r\nwould bring security and peaceful coexistence to all \r\nthe States and peoples of the region. Squandering this \r\nhistoric opportunity would constitute a grave loss for \r\nthe Israeli people, and we would all regret it. \r\n We welcome the recent positive developments in \r\nIraq. We hope that such developments will continue in \r\norder to achieve security and stability in that country, \r\ncontribute to the success of the comprehensive national \r\nreconciliation efforts and help establish positive, \r\ncooperative relations with neighbouring countries, \r\nallowing Iraq to resume its distinct positive role in the \r\nregion at all levels. \r\n We look forward to positive results from the \r\nDarfur peace talks, to be held in Doha, Qatar, between \r\nthe Sudanese Government and the Darfur opposition. \r\nWe hope that the parties concerned can build a \r\nframework for a political agreement that would help \r\nrealize security, stability and development in Darfur. \r\nWe also welcome the policies of Sheikh Sharif Sheikh \r\nAhmed, President of the Transitional Federal \r\nGovernment of brotherly Somalia, and his efforts to \r\nachieve peace in his country. We urge all of our \r\nbrethren and all factions in Somalia to renounce \r\nviolence and embrace dialogue. We support international \r\nefforts to combat piracy and armed robbery against \r\ncommercial ships off the coast of the Horn of Africa. \r\n A/64/PV.11\r\n \r\n37 09-52598 \r\n \r\n We welcome the continued cooperation between \r\nthe friendly Islamic Republic of Iran, the international \r\ncommunity and the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency. In this respect, we see some positive signs that \r\ncould lead to a sound diplomatic solution. \r\n There is no doubt that the efforts exerted by the \r\nrich industrialized nations to restore stability and \r\nbalance to the international capital markets have begun \r\nto bear fruit. This could lead to the recovery of the \r\nworld economy. We believe more international effort is \r\nneeded to reach consensus in the Doha Round of trade \r\nnegotiations, taking into account the interests of all \r\nStates, including the developing countries. In light of \r\nthe serious shortages of food, water and medicine from \r\nwhich many countries are suffering, we urge the rich \r\nindustrialized countries to increase investment in \r\nagriculture research, food security and the supply of \r\nwater and medicine, for these have a direct impact on \r\nhumankind.  \r\n It is also our hope that the Climate Change \r\nConference to be held in Copenhagen at the end of the \r\nyear will adopt a long-term plan to protect the \r\nenvironment and reduce harmful carbon dioxide \r\nemissions.  \r\n Mr. Viinanen (Finland), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to express our deep \r\nthanks and gratitude to the President of the General \r\nAssembly for his efforts in leading the work of this \r\nsession. We urge all Member States to take the \r\nnecessary practical measures to help us reach \r\nconsensus on all the issues on our agenda. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency The Honourable Wilfred Elrington, \r\nAttorney General, Minister for Foreign Affairs and \r\nForeign Trade of Belize. \r\n Mr. Elrington (Belize): Please permit me to \r\ncongratulate Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, on behalf of \r\nthe Prime Minister, Government and people of Belize, \r\non having assumed the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-fourth session and to wish him \r\nevery success in his stewardship. Permit me also to \r\nextend my Government’s thanks to Mr. Miguel d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann for his excellent stewardship of the work \r\nof the sixty-third session of the General Assembly. \r\n Belize is pleased to discharge its obligation by \r\nparticipating in the general debate of the sixty-fourth \r\nregular session of the General Assembly on the theme \r\n“Effective responses to global crises: strengthening \r\nmultilateralism and dialogue among civilizations for \r\ninternational peace, security and development”. \r\n Just over one week ago, we celebrated the \r\ntwenty-eighth anniversary of our independence. \r\nJoining us in the celebrations were members of the \r\ndiplomatic core drawn from the four corners of the \r\nglobe. And even as we made merry, our collective \r\nminds were silently cogitating upon the crises that are \r\nthreatening to destroy our collective way of life and, \r\nindeed, the very planet which sustains us. \r\n All indications are that the aftershocks of the \r\nglobal economic crisis have now begun to affect \r\nBelize’s real economy. We are experiencing declining \r\nlevels of revenue, a worrying reduction in productivity, \r\ndiminishing remittances, crushing debt-servicing \r\nobligations, unrelenting budgetary pressures and a \r\ndrying up of resources on which to draw.  \r\n These challenges are aggravated by other ills that \r\nplague our day-to-day existence. Annually, we are \r\nthreatened by hurricanes and floods of ever greater \r\nintensity, which reduce the yields of our farmers, erode \r\nour beaches and wash away vital infrastructure. \r\nWarmer seas damage our great barrier reef and impair \r\nits capacity to incubate and nurture the fish and other \r\nmarine organisms that depend upon a healthy reef \r\nsystem for their survival. Illicit traffickers in drugs and \r\narms penetrate our borders at will, leaving drug \r\naddicts, broken families, violence, death and \r\ndestruction in their wake. Our population is also being \r\nravaged by HIV/AIDS. Other non-communicable \r\nchronic diseases are approaching pandemic \r\nproportions. All these crises have placed the attainment \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals in Belize in real \r\njeopardy. \r\n The globalization that was the tide to lift all boats \r\nhas not been so even. Its networks of interdependence \r\nhave compounded how we as national Governments \r\ncan secure the basic needs of our people. Its evolving \r\nsystem of global governance is unresponsive to the \r\ncares and concerns of middle-income countries like \r\nours, for despite the devastating impact it is having \r\nupon our economies, we are yet to be invited to the \r\ntable to participate in the discussion on the global \r\neconomic crisis. Our pleas for an ambitious climate \r\nagreement are yet to be honoured with serious \r\ncontemplation in the current negotiations, although the \r\nA/64/PV.11  \r\n \r\n09-52598 38 \r\n \r\nviability of our countries hangs in the balance, and the \r\nglobal commitment of a development-oriented trade \r\nround seems to have been perfunctorily relegated to the \r\nannals of trade-negotiating history. Our demands, \r\nalthough ceremoniously acknowledged in countless \r\nresolutions and declarations, remain unceremoniously \r\nunmet. \r\n If we are to define an effective global response to \r\nthe converging global challenges that confront us, we \r\nmust first examine how we are governed. While we, as \r\nMember States of the United Nations, have endorsed \r\nthe principle of sovereign equality, it is apparent from \r\nthe structural relationships engendered in our \r\ninstitutions that the principle is honoured more in the \r\nbreach than in the observance. The United Nations has \r\nits Security Council and the Permanent Five; the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank have \r\ntheir weighted voting and the World Trade \r\nOrganization has its green room. In the larger global \r\narena, we have a proliferation of convenient \r\ngroupings — the Group of Six, the Group of Seven, the \r\nGroup of Eight, the Group of Twenty and the Major \r\nEconomies Forum, to name but a few. The club model \r\nof cooperation is deeply entrenched in our multilateral \r\nsystem. \r\n While we cannot deny that this model has \r\nfacilitated some decisions and agreements, we also \r\ncannot ignore the costs associated with that facilitation. \r\nThis model of global governance has progressively \r\naccumulated a debt of trust and confidence among the \r\nwider international community not only as a result of \r\nits manner of exclusive decision-making, but also \r\nbecause of the lack of implementation of global \r\ndecisions and agreements. The club model of \r\nmultilateral cooperation suffers from a crisis of \r\nlegitimacy. \r\n If we accept that we operate as sovereign equals, \r\nwe cannot continue to acquiesce to governance by a \r\nfew. We must accept nothing less than equal \r\nrepresentation. In that regard, we recognize and \r\napplaud our brothers from the South who have, through \r\ntheir economic prowess and political deftness, taken \r\nthe mantle of leadership in some international issues. \r\nWe are all entitled to be heard and, what is more, we \r\nare all entitled to have the decisions that are made \r\nreflect our concerns if not our demands. \r\n We need a new model for multilateral cooperation \r\nframework in which all nations have meaningful input \r\ninto the decision-making process on issues that have a \r\ndirect impact on their interests. This requires \r\nfundamental structural reform and not mere cursory \r\nefforts for technocratic coherence. Given the far-\r\nreaching geopolitical consequences that the global \r\neconomic crisis has touched off, we now have the \r\nperfect opportunity to redress the shortcomings of the \r\nexclusive club model, thereby restoring trust and \r\nconfidence in our multilateral institutions. The time for \r\ninclusive multilateralism is now upon us. \r\n Allow me to now address some of the issues that \r\nbear upon the immediate interests of my people and my \r\ncountry, Belize. Belize falls within the World Bank \r\ncategory of middle-income countries. Middle-income \r\ncountries play a pivotal role in the global economy and \r\nin global politics. We account for some two thirds of \r\nthe world’s population. Our economies provide \r\nimportant and growing sources of export demand and \r\ninvestment opportunities. Some economies of middle-\r\nincome countries are now even big enough to create \r\nsystemic risks in global financial markets. On strategic \r\nissues, middle-income countries have not infrequently \r\nemerged as key players, and one half of the world’s \r\nprotected areas are to be found in our countries.  \r\n Still, poverty remains prevalent in our countries. \r\nSome three quarters of the world’s poor live in middle-\r\nincome countries. We also account for an estimated \r\n47 per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions.  \r\n Given the aforementioned, it is evident that \r\nwhatever happens in middle-income countries affects \r\nthe entire world for better or for worse. For this reason, \r\nif for no other, it is in the interest of the world \r\ncommunity that middle-income countries remain \r\nviable, vibrant and dynamic. \r\n In order for that to happen, however, bilateral and \r\nmultilateral institutions must redefine the terms of \r\nengagement with our countries. Rather than focusing \r\non per capita income, a needs-based analysis is \r\nnecessary. Financing arrangements that tend towards \r\nthe short and medium term must also be revisited. In \r\norder to build capacity, improve our institutions and \r\nspur economic growth, we need direct fiscal and \r\nbudgetary support. Moreover, in view of the high ratio \r\nof debt-to-gross-domestic-product (GDP) in many of \r\nour countries, which has been further exacerbated by \r\nthe recent global economic crisis, the need for \r\nconcessionary financing and debt relief is ever more \r\ncritical. \r\n A/64/PV.11\r\n \r\n39 09-52598 \r\n \r\n During the 1980s and 1990s, the integration of \r\nmarkets spurred significant growth in high-income \r\nnations, while low-income nations exploited their \r\ncomparative advantage in cheap labour. However, \r\nmiddle-income countries had neither advantage in \r\nknowledge nor low-wage products and consequently, in \r\nreal terms, experienced economic stagnation. Many of \r\nus were forced to embark upon a process of \r\ndiversification to ensure our continued growth and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Therefore, in the early 1990s, Belize made rapid \r\nstrides in building up its international financial services \r\nindustry. We did so in accordance with the best \r\npractices of the industry internationally, and we were \r\nguided every step of the way by the recommendations \r\nof the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \r\nDevelopment (OECD). As a country whose GDP is just \r\nover $1 billion, the contribution of this industry to our \r\neconomy is significant. A large percentage of the \r\ndeposits from the international banking sector has been \r\nused to finance development projects, support our \r\ncitrus industry and commercial free zone and export \r\nprocessing zone businesses, which account for some \r\n$1 billion worth of investments in our country.  \r\n Furthermore, since this sector finances only \r\nforeign exchange earning businesses, it enables the \r\ngeneration of millions of dollars in foreign exchange \r\nthat directly supports our fixed exchange rate system. \r\nIt is also a source for the creation of relatively high-\r\nquality jobs for many Belizeans. On the whole, in 2008 \r\nthe international financial services industry accounted \r\nfor some 9 per cent of Belize’s GDP and 10 per cent of \r\nits gross imports. \r\n Considering the vital role that this industry plays \r\nin the Belizean economy, ensuring its integrity is in our \r\nbest interests. We have developed a regulatory \r\nframework and enacted legislation for its \r\nreinforcement. We have also made commitments to the \r\nOECD to improve transparency and establish an \r\neffective exchange of information. But now, in the \r\nmidst of an economic crisis that had its origin in the \r\nfinancial markets of the developed world, the Group  \r\nof 20 (G-20) finds it convenient to reactivate its \r\nharmful tax initiative at the expense — and to the \r\ndisadvantage — of an industry we have so \r\npainstakingly and carefully groomed into a productive \r\nsector of our economy. \r\n Beyond the calls for reform, we have heard some \r\nG-20 members call for a complete annihilation of the \r\nindustry. If that were to occur, I shudder to think of the \r\nsuffering and hardship it would occasion for our \r\ncountry and people. We are convinced that a more \r\nequitable and effective way to address the issue of \r\noffshore financial services is through a mechanism for \r\nmultilateral cooperation in which all States participate \r\non an equal footing. \r\n Climate change poses perhaps the most serious \r\nthreat to our sustainable development and viability. I \r\nneed not remind the Assembly of the emerging \r\nscientific evidence, which prognosticates more rapid \r\nclimate change and sea-level rise. Let me take this \r\nopportunity to applaud the Secretary-General for \r\nmaking climate change a priority and for convening \r\nlast week’s Summit. The urgency of a global response \r\nto this issue is inescapable. We welcome the various \r\nnational and regional efforts to construct mechanisms \r\nto address climate change and its impact. In our region, \r\nBelize hosts the Caribbean Community Climate \r\nChange Centre, which has benefited from the support \r\nof the international community and has been \r\nrecognized as a centre of excellence.  \r\n However, we know all too well from the impacts \r\nwe are observing today that piecemeal action is not \r\nsufficient. In fact, notwithstanding national and \r\nregional action, global greenhouse gas emissions \r\ncontinue to increase. We can only begin to respond \r\neffectively to this problem by agreeing to implement \r\nambitious mitigation targets and increasing our support \r\nfor adaptation. Considering that small island \r\ndeveloping States and other particularly vulnerable \r\ncoastal countries are already experiencing dangerous \r\nclimate change, avoiding adverse effects on these \r\nespecially vulnerable countries should be the \r\nbenchmark for determining our targets and our levels \r\nof support. In that regard, the prophetic words of the \r\nPresident of the Maldives resonate with good reason: \r\n“If you can’t save the Maldives today you can’t save \r\nyourself tomorrow.” \r\n Building upon the momentum of the much-\r\nproclaimed new era of engagement, we are hopeful that \r\nlongstanding issues on the international peace and \r\nsecurity agenda may achieve progress. In some cases, \r\nchange is already afoot. Cross-Strait relations between \r\nTaiwan and China have improved and, for the first \r\ntime, Taiwan has participated as an observer at the \r\nWorld Health Assembly. Haiti held elections earlier \r\nA/64/PV.11  \r\n \r\n09-52598 40 \r\n \r\nthis year, in a relatively peaceful and orderly fashion. \r\nAfter 47 years, the Organization of American States \r\nhas now lifted Cuba’s suspension from that body. \r\n We welcome these developments and expect that \r\nthey signal a change in approach that will allow for the \r\nfull integration of our sisterly nations of Taiwan, Haiti \r\nand Cuba into their rightful place in the international \r\ncommunity. However, for that integration to occur, we \r\nmust find an appropriate way for Taiwan to participate \r\nin the activities of the specialized agencies of the \r\nUnited Nations, we must sustain our support for Haiti \r\nand we must urge that efforts be made to end the \r\nanachronistic embargo against Cuba. \r\n In cases where processes have stalled, let us \r\nrenew our engagement. We cannot fail in realizing the \r\nvision of two States, Israel and Palestine, living side by \r\nside within secure and recognized borders. We also \r\ncannot fail in resolving the political stalemate in our \r\nneighbour country of Honduras. Peace and security are \r\nnot options, they are imperatives. \r\n My Government is committed to securing just \r\nand lasting peace for our people. Last year, we happily \r\nconcluded a special agreement with Guatemala that \r\nwill pave the way for the referral of the Guatemalan \r\nterritorial claim to our country to the International \r\nCourt of Justice. A preliminary and critical phase is \r\nupon us, in which we must prepare our people to \r\ndetermine by referendum whether the case shall be \r\nreferred. My Government is beginning a \r\ncomprehensive public education campaign to raise \r\nawareness and ensure that, when our people decide, \r\nthey will do so having been fully informed of the \r\nissues. We are approaching what could be a definitive \r\nmoment in our history. \r\n I began my statement by addressing the \r\ngovernance dilemma — to govern and to be governed. \r\nWhat is consistent in the demands that we  \r\nas developing countries — and small States in \r\nparticular — have made is that we want to have a \r\nmeaningful role in the governance of our affairs at the \r\ninternational level. We want to have meaningful input \r\ninto the solutions that are being crafted for the \r\nproblems that we face and of which, in some cases, we \r\nbear the disproportionate burden.  \r\n For us, the model of multilateral cooperation \r\nmust be imbued with legitimacy. For that to happen, \r\nwe must work for a more inclusive process. Twenty-\r\nfirst century challenges require a new dynamic for \r\ninternational relations, one that must be inclusive and, \r\ndare I say, democratic. The United Nations Charter is \r\nfounded upon the premise of democracy. “We the \r\npeoples of the United Nations” assert our \r\ndetermination not only to be governed by the principles \r\nset out in the Charter but also to govern by these \r\nprinciples. \r\n As such, the Charter itself vests in us a role in our \r\nown governance. We in Belize accept that role, and we \r\nare thus empowered, notwithstanding the pressing \r\nchallenges in satisfying the basic needs of our people, \r\nto return our country to a path of sustainable \r\ndevelopment. No effort will be spared to draw upon \r\nour limited resources as well as other available \r\nresources to invest in our human resources, to improve \r\nour political and legal institutions, to support \r\ntraditional and niche industries, to practise fiscal \r\nresponsibility and to protect and preserve our \r\nenvironment for present and future generations. \r\n We solemnly agree that our development is our \r\nown responsibility. We welcome the support of the \r\ninternational community in the spirit of multilateral \r\ncooperation as we take action to achieve our high \r\naspirations. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. George Yeo, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Republic of Singapore. \r\n Mr. Yeo (Singapore): When we met here last \r\nyear, financial institutions such as Lehman Brothers \r\nand American International Group (AIG) were falling \r\nlike tenpins. For weeks, credit froze as perceptions of \r\nrisk shot up. The global financial system went into \r\nseizure. National Governments took emergency \r\nmeasures to rescue banks and keep credit lines open. \r\nThe United States Treasury and the United States \r\nFederal Reserve, in particular, reacted with \r\nextraordinary boldness. For a period of time, it seemed \r\nas if everyone was flying blind. \r\n After a year, the situation no longer looks as \r\nbleak today. In fact, after a sharp contraction of the \r\nadvanced economies in the first half of this year, there \r\nare signs of a recovery. Some of the leading indicators \r\nare flashing positive again and the next two quarters \r\nwill probably register good growth globally. Whether \r\nthis growth can be sustained is, however, a different \r\nquestion. \r\n A/64/PV.11\r\n \r\n41 09-52598 \r\n \r\n It would be a mistake to think that the global \r\neconomic crisis will soon be over. The crisis came \r\nabout because of excesses and imbalances which have \r\nto be put right. Looking back, we know that the \r\nexcesses were the result of inadequate regulation of \r\nbanks and quasi-banking institutions. Over the years, \r\nclever minds turned non-banks into de facto ones \r\nwhich were not regulated as conventional banks. This \r\nunregulated financial sector grew to dwarf the \r\nregulated sector. \r\n To forestall collapse when the bubble burst, \r\nGovernments and regulators stepped in taking over \r\nfinancial institutions, guaranteeing liabilities, \r\nincreasing public spending and pumping liquidity into \r\nthe economy. These are emergency measures which are \r\nneeded to get the global economy through a critical \r\nphase. They have stabilized the financial sector and \r\nprevented the real economy from being too badly \r\naffected. \r\n However, as when steroids are administered to \r\nreduce inflammation, there is a price to be paid for this \r\ntemporary relief. First, the expectation that \r\nGovernments will step in when things go badly wrong \r\ncreates a huge moral hazard. Once Governments set a \r\nbottom limit to the consequences of risk-taking, more \r\nrisks will be taken in the future. \r\n Secondly, the huge increase in global liquidity \r\nhas slowed down or reversed the fall in inflated asset \r\nprices. Worldwide stock markets have benefited from \r\neasy money. In Asia, property markets are booming \r\nagain even though the real economy is still struggling. \r\nWithdrawing liquidity without destabilizing economies \r\nand asset markets in the coming months and years will \r\nbe a tricky business. \r\n And thirdly, the emergency measures which have \r\nbeen taken reduce the need for painful restructuring. \r\nYet without major restructuring of regulatory systems \r\nand businesses, the imbalances which created the \r\nconditions for the crisis in the first place can only get \r\nworse. \r\n While excesses in the financial sector were the \r\ntrigger of the crisis, the deeper underlying cause was \r\nthe global imbalance between producers and consumers \r\nand between saving and consumption. For too long, the \r\nworld depended on the United States consumers \r\nkeeping global demand high and on lending those \r\nconsumers the money to keep the game going. To \r\ncorrect this imbalance, Asians have to consume more \r\nand save less as a proportion of income, while \r\nAmericans have to consume less and save more. \r\nOtherwise, a global Keynesian paradox of thrift will \r\ncause the global economy to operate below capacity. \r\n Rebalancing the global economy is, however, not \r\na simple matter at all, and is not only about economics: \r\nit is also deeply political. The rise of Asia is altering \r\nthe global power structure. Nothing expresses this \r\nmore than the complex relationship that now ties the \r\nUnited States and China together. China, with its \r\nreserves of over $2 trillion, is heavily invested in the \r\nUnited States dollar, making it a major stakeholder in \r\nthe United States economy. Without continuing market \r\nconfidence in the United States dollar, not just the \r\nUnited States economy, but the entire global economy \r\nwill be put at risk. \r\n Looking ahead, however, it is not going to be a \r\nbipolar world but a multi-polar world. Europe and \r\nJapan will remain heavyweights. India, Russia, Brazil \r\nand others will become more significant players. A \r\nmulti-polar world means a messier world with a \r\ndiversity of political systems, values and worldviews. \r\nNon-State actors like civil society organizations must \r\nincreasingly be engaged. At the same time, we are all \r\nmembers of the same human family sharing the same \r\nplanet. Looking ahead, we will need more effective \r\nglobal governance across a wide range of issues from \r\nprotection of human rights and international financial \r\nregulation to efforts to combat pandemics, climate \r\nchange and terrorism. \r\n The greatest challenge confronting us today is \r\nthat of ensuring effective global governance. We do not \r\nwant a global Government but we do need better \r\ncoordination, cooperation and enforcement in many \r\nareas. The reform of the United Nations, including the \r\nUnited Nations Security Council, is going to take time. \r\nIncremental rather than dramatic change is a more \r\npractical approach. \r\n In terms of world trade, the World Trade \r\nOrganization, while far from perfect, can still function \r\nwell with effective political leadership. Once that \r\nleadership is supplied, the Doha Round of negotiations \r\ncan be concluded within the next few years. We are \r\nfortunate to have in Pascal Lamy a strong Director-\r\nGeneral at the helm. But this is a dangerous period \r\nbecause domestic politics in many countries favour \r\ngreater protectionism. At all regional and international \r\nA/64/PV.11  \r\n \r\n09-52598 42 \r\n \r\nforums, we must take a clear collective stand against \r\nprotectionism. \r\n Climate change is a long-term challenge for \r\nhumanity which needs to be addressed with some \r\nurgency. While we cannot be sure how much increased \r\ncarbon dioxide emissions will affect the global climate \r\nin the coming decades and centuries, it would be \r\nirresponsible for us in this generation not to start acting \r\nnow. The increased weather volatility we have been \r\nexperiencing in recent years could be a warning of \r\nlonger-term trends already under way. An international \r\nagreement on climate change which aligns our interests \r\nand efforts is absolutely necessary to preserve this \r\nplanet for future generations. \r\n For that reason, we must redouble efforts to \r\nconclude negotiations for an international agreement at \r\nthe Copenhagen Climate Change Conference at the end \r\nof this year. It is good that caring for the environment \r\nis increasingly becoming a moral norm in the world, \r\nespecially among the young. We must not fail them. \r\nThe strong political commitment expressed by many \r\nleaders at the Summit on Climate Change, chaired by \r\nthe Secretary-General himself here last week, gives us \r\nreason for hope. \r\n The present economic crisis is a major challenge \r\nto global governance. In November last year, then \r\nUnited States President George W. Bush convened the \r\nfirst summit of the Group of 20 (G-20). The second \r\nmeeting of leaders was held in London in April and the \r\nthird has just concluded in Pittsburgh under President \r\nBarack Obama’s chairmanship. The G-20 has now been \r\ndesignated the premier forum for international \r\neconomic cooperation, replacing the Group of Eight \r\n(G-8). \r\n This G-20 process and the swift, decisive actions \r\nthat it brought about have helped avert an economic \r\ndepression in the last year. The emergency measures \r\ntaken by various Governments in response to the \r\nfinancial tsunami have bought us precious time to \r\nrestructure and rebalance the global economy. In \r\nPittsburgh, the G-20 leaders acknowledged that a sense \r\nof normalcy should not lead to complacency. We \r\nwelcome their pledge to adopt policies needed for \r\nstrong, sustained and balanced growth. If the biggest \r\neconomies do not persist in that effort — and persisting \r\nmeans pain for domestic constituencies in many \r\ncountries — the respite we are now enjoying will lead \r\nto an even bigger crisis, this time possibly involving \r\nforeign exchange markets as well. \r\n In the coming months and years, it is important \r\nfor the G-20 process to develop greater legitimacy, \r\nespecially as it begins to deal with a broader set of \r\nissues. That the establishment of the G-20 leaders \r\nmeeting was not blessed by the United Nations or other \r\nexisting international organizations should not hold us \r\nback from giving it full support. Although the G-20 \r\nprocess is not ideal, it is the most important driver of \r\nchange that we have right now.  \r\n The United Nations itself is too intricate and not \r\nstructured to deal with issues such as a major financial \r\ncrisis. The old G-8 lacked representation, and the G-8 \r\nPlus was not acceptable because it put the additional \r\nparticipants at a disadvantage. As for the International \r\nMonetary Fund, it was never designed to tackle a crisis \r\nof such scale. In any case, the Bretton Woods \r\ninstitutions themselves need reform, which indeed is a \r\nmajor subject on the G-20 agenda. \r\n For the G-20 process to be effective and \r\nlegitimate, however, it is not enough for leaders to \r\nconfer and make general exhortations. Ministers and \r\nexperts must also meet and go into details. They should \r\nnot be confined to the same G-20 countries every time. \r\nWe need variable geometry in membership. For \r\ndifferent subjects, there could be different groups of \r\nparticipants, including both G-20 and non-G-20 \r\ncountries. The views of small States, which comprise \r\nthe majority of Members of the United Nations, must \r\nnot be ignored. The meetings should be transparent. \r\nThere must be wide consultations so that those not \r\nincluded in specific meetings can still table their views. \r\nDepending on the subject, those consultations can take \r\nplace at the United Nations or at one of the other \r\ninternational organizations. \r\n Mindful of the need to widen participation, \r\nBritish Prime Minister Gordon Brown invited regional \r\nrepresentatives, such as the Chair of the Association of \r\nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Chair of the \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development and the \r\nChairperson of the African Union Commission, to the \r\nG-20 leaders meeting in London in April 2009. \r\nPresident Obama followed this precedent in Pittsburgh. \r\nWe in ASEAN certainly hope that the inclusion of the \r\nASEAN Chair will become the norm at future G-20 \r\nleaders meetings. It is right that the United Nations \r\n A/64/PV.11\r\n \r\n43 09-52598 \r\n \r\nSecretary-General was included from the very \r\nbeginning. \r\n A balance has to be struck between effectiveness \r\nand inclusiveness. If a meeting is too big, it becomes \r\nunwieldy and unworkable. If too small, it lacks \r\nrepresentation and legitimacy. As most Members of the \r\nUnited Nations are not in the G-20, it is important for \r\nus to have a say on the role the G-20 should play as an \r\nagent of change in global governance. While we should \r\nsupport the G-20 process, we should do so in a way \r\nthat ensures that our own interests as smaller States are \r\ntaken into account. \r\n A great power shift is taking place in the world. \r\nThe formal establishment of the G-20 as a new \r\ninternational institution last week marks a momentous \r\nnew beginning. History shows that power shifts never \r\noccur smoothly. Without a good system of global \r\ngovernance, we can be sure that the power shift in this \r\ncentury will also be a troubled one. Putting that system \r\nin place requires the collective effort of all of us. We \r\nshould not be lulled by the temporary easing of the \r\nglobal economic crisis into thinking that the worst is \r\nbehind us and that we can return to our old ways. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Péter Balázs, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Republic of Hungary. \r\n Mr. Balázs (Hungary): Allow me at the outset to \r\ncongratulate the President on his assumption of the \r\nhigh post of the presidency of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-fourth session. In fulfilling his challenging \r\ntasks during this session, he may rest assured of the \r\nsupport and cooperation of the delegation of the \r\nRepublic of Hungary. \r\n The current session of the General Assembly \r\nbegins its work against the backdrop of an \r\nextraordinary downturn of the world economy. \r\nHungary was among those countries which were \r\nespecially hard hit by the storm of the current financial \r\nand economic crisis. In order to cope with its \r\nconsequences, the Hungarian Government has adopted \r\nand implemented a series of stabilization measures. As \r\na result of this policy, the first positive trends have \r\nalready emerged. Today we can claim that the \r\nHungarian economy is well on its way towards \r\nrecovery and that the foundations of a more sustainable \r\ndevelopment have been laid. If implemented \r\nvigorously, the strict fiscal policy of my Government \r\nwill put the country back into the ranks of the \r\nfinancially stable economies. \r\n At the same time, Hungary cannot and does not \r\nwant to turn a blind eye to the plight of millions \r\nworldwide, especially the most vulnerable ones in the \r\ndeveloping world, particularly in Africa, who have \r\nbeen thrown into poverty as a consequence of the \r\nglobal economic crisis. The present crisis should not \r\nundermine our common efforts to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. Hungary continues to \r\ntake its share of responsibility by implementing its \r\ndonor programmes in Afghanistan, Viet Nam and the \r\nneighbouring middle-income countries of the Western \r\nBalkans. \r\n Global crises require that we all think and act \r\ntogether in the spirit of shared responsibility. It is right \r\nthat climate change is high on the United Nations \r\nagenda, as it threatens the very foundations of our life. \r\nYet for too long we failed to respond adequately. \r\nHungary is willing to accept its share of responsibility \r\nand is fully committed to achieving important results at \r\nthe United Nations Climate Change Conference in \r\nCopenhagen. In this regard, the summit on climate \r\nchange recently convened by the Secretary-General \r\nwas a useful forum in identifying the necessary steps \r\ntowards a successful outcome. \r\n Preventing conflicts and managing crises remain \r\nhigh on our agenda. The United Nations, in \r\ncooperation with regional organizations, continues to \r\nplay a key role in this respect. Full integration of the \r\nWestern Balkans into European and Euro-Atlantic \r\nstructures is a means to promote the stability and \r\nprosperity of that region, a goal that Hungary supports \r\nactively. Interaction among countries of the region to \r\nfulfil the conditions of European integration is an \r\nessential tool. International efforts in Kosovo represent \r\na good example of effective cooperation among various \r\nstakeholders, such as the European Union and NATO. \r\n In Georgia, the situation on the ground remains \r\nfragile. We firmly believe that a peaceful and lasting \r\nsolution to the conflict must be based on full respect \r\nfor the independence, sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegrity of that country within its internationally \r\nrecognized borders. We deplore the decision that led to \r\nthe termination of the monitoring activities of the \r\nUnited Nations and the Organization for Security and \r\nCooperation in Europe in the breakaway parts of \r\nGeorgia/Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The resumption \r\nA/64/PV.11  \r\n \r\n09-52598 44 \r\n \r\nof the international presence in these regions is \r\nnecessary. \r\n The stakes in Afghanistan are high. The success \r\nof international stabilization and reconstruction efforts \r\nwill have a major impact both on our security and on \r\nthe defence of the values our societies stand for. \r\nFailure is not an option. Hungary will remain \r\ncommitted to supporting, politically and by \r\ncontributing troops and civilian and development \r\nassistance, the creation of a stable Afghanistan \r\ngoverned by the rule of law. We welcome the joint \r\ninitiative of the United Kingdom, Germany and France \r\nto hold an international conference at the ministerial \r\nlevel, co-chaired by the United Nations and the Afghan \r\nGovernment. \r\n In the Middle East, Hungary warmly welcomes \r\nthe commitment of the United States to vigorously \r\npursue a two-State solution and a comprehensive \r\npeace. It is now up to the parties themselves to engage \r\nin a meaningful process of negotiation. It is our \r\nresponsibility to assist them in carrying the process \r\nforward. \r\n The nuclear programme of Iran continues to be a \r\nmatter of most serious concern. We deeply regret that \r\nIran’s leadership has refused to abide by the relevant \r\nSecurity Council resolutions. In flagrant violation of its \r\ninternational obligations, Iran has even increased its \r\nuranium-enrichment capacities. Recent revelations \r\nabout the existence of a second enrichment facility \r\nunderscore the legitimacy of our previous concerns. We \r\nurge Iran to engage in substantive negotiations on its \r\nnuclear programme without further delay. The news of \r\nrecent missile tests only reinforces our sense of \r\nurgency. \r\n The idea of a world without nuclear weapons has \r\nlong been cherished. We welcome the affirmations of \r\ncommitment to this goal made at the recent summit-\r\nlevel meeting of the Security Council (see S/PV.6191), \r\nalong with the adoption of a comprehensive set of \r\nmeasures to strengthen the global non-proliferation \r\nregime. Hungary hopes that the momentum created by \r\nthat meeting will also have a positive impact on the \r\n2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on \r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. \r\n The global economic and financial crisis has \r\naffected the political landscape in many countries and \r\nhas led to the re-emergence of extreme nationalist, \r\nracist and xenophobic ideologies and political \r\nmovements. Like many other countries, Hungary is not \r\nimmune from this phenomenon. We cannot allow those \r\nalarming trends to prevail or to roll back the advance \r\nof democratic values and human rights. The \r\nGovernment of Hungary condemns, in the most \r\nresolute terms, all forms of racism, anti-Semitism and \r\nxenophobia and fights any manifestation of them not \r\nonly in words, but also in deeds. \r\n The promotion and protection of human rights, \r\nincluding the rights of national minorities and the \r\npreservation of their cultural and linguistic identities, \r\nhave traditionally been high on the agenda of the \r\nHungarian Government. The presence of flourishing \r\nminority communities does not weaken a State, but \r\nrather makes it stronger. Trust between the majority \r\nand minorities within a country can be built only on \r\nthat basis. The Republic of Hungary attaches great \r\nimportance to the work of the United Nations Forum \r\non Minority Issues and is determined to contribute \r\nactively to the Forum’s second meeting, to be held this \r\nNovember in Geneva. We are witnessing alarming \r\ntendencies that have a detrimental effect on the \r\npolitical participation, cultural life and educational \r\nopportunities of minorities. The international \r\ncommunity should pay special attention to respect for \r\nminority rights. \r\n At this point, I would also like to confirm the \r\ncommitment of Hungary, as a newly elected member of \r\nthe Human Rights Council, to play an active role in the \r\nmost important human rights body of the United \r\nNations. We strongly believe that there is a clear and \r\nurgent need for further institution-building in the field \r\nof the prevention of genocide and mass atrocities. For \r\nthat reason, this year Hungary prepared a feasibility \r\nstudy on the establishment of the Budapest Centre for \r\nthe International Prevention of Genocide and Mass \r\nAtrocities. It is envisaged that the Centre will work in \r\nclose cooperation with the United Nations, including \r\nthe Office of the Special Adviser on the Prevention of \r\nGenocide and Mass Atrocities and the Office of the \r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights. \r\n The ongoing changes in international politics and \r\nthe world economy have created a new situation for the \r\nUnited Nations. We welcome and strongly support the \r\nefforts aimed at strengthening the ability of the \r\nOrganization to adapt to the new realities, but we \r\ncannot be satisfied with the pace of the transformation. \r\nThe present challenges should lend additional impetus \r\nto moving forward more vigorously on such issues as \r\n A/64/PV.11\r\n \r\n45 09-52598 \r\n \r\nSecurity Council reform, peacekeeping activities, \r\nsystem-wide coherence, budgeting of the Organization, \r\nmanagement reform and reform of the environmental \r\ngovernance system of the United Nations. With a view \r\nto actively promoting those goals, Hungary presented \r\nits candidacies for the Security Council for the term \r\n2012-2013 and for the Economic and Social Council \r\nfor the term 2011-2013. \r\n Once again the United Nations stands at a \r\ncrossroads. It needs to adapt to the changing \r\ninternational environment. This change will require \r\nsacrifices, but it also offers new opportunities as it \r\npaves the way for new consensus on the future of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Daw Penjo, Foreign Secretary of \r\nthe Kingdom of Bhutan. \r\n Mr. Penjo (Bhutan): I should like to congratulate \r\nthe President on his election to preside over the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. We are \r\nconfident that under his able leadership and guidance, \r\nour deliberations will be successful. I assure him of my \r\ndelegation’s fullest support and cooperation. I would \r\nalso like to convey our deep appreciation to his \r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Miguel d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann, for his leadership at the sixty-third session. \r\n It has been only 18 months since my country \r\nsuccessfully made the transition to a democratic \r\nconstitutional monarchy. Within this period, the elected \r\nGovernment has made every effort to establish a strong \r\nfoundation for a sustainable and vibrant democracy, as \r\nit is these initial years that will determine the direction \r\nof democracy in Bhutan. Concrete steps are being \r\ntaken to empower the people and to ensure that \r\ndemocracy truly benefits every citizen. \r\n The people of Bhutan, although hesitant at first, \r\nwere guided and encouraged by our enlightened and \r\nvisionary monarchs and have fully embraced \r\ndemocracy. From our experience so far, we are \r\nconfident that a strong foundation for democracy has \r\nbeen established; it is now time to nurture and continue \r\nto strengthen this foundation. \r\n The world is grappling with multiple, interlinked \r\nglobal crises. The impact of these crises has been \r\nparticularly severe on the least developed countries, \r\nwhere levels of poverty and insecurity are already high. \r\nThe food and energy crises have driven millions of the \r\nmost vulnerable people deeper into poverty and further \r\ndesperation. Meeting their needs and freeing them from \r\nthe cycle of poverty continues to be the major \r\nchallenge to development and to achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). It is \r\ninconceivable that, in an era of unprecedented \r\nprosperity, the vast majority of the world’s population \r\nremains in poverty and destitution. The alleviation of \r\npoverty, therefore, must be at the forefront of the \r\ninternational community’s development efforts. \r\n Since the adoption of the Monterrey Consensus in \r\n2002, developing countries have made significant \r\nprogress in many areas of domestic resource \r\nmobilization. However, challenges remain, especially \r\nduring the current economic slowdown, for developing \r\ncountries to mobilize adequate domestic resources to \r\nmeet their development needs. For many such \r\ncountries, official development assistance (ODA) \r\nremains the most important source of external \r\nfinancing for achieving their development objectives \r\nand attaining the MDGs. We therefore encourage donor \r\ncountries to take concrete steps towards fulfilling their \r\nODA commitments. \r\n In Bhutan, we have achieved relative \r\nsocio-economic progress over the past five years. The \r\nannual gross domestic product growth rate has \r\naveraged around 8 per cent, the national literacy rate \r\nhas reached 60 per cent and health coverage has been \r\nsustained at 90 per cent. The royal Government \r\ncontinues to accord high priority to the social sector. \r\nBhutan launched its tenth five-year plan in July 2008 \r\nwith the overarching goal of poverty reduction and \r\nimplementing MDG-based initiatives. As this is the \r\nfirst plan to be implemented under our first elected \r\nGovernment, its successful implementation is of \r\nparamount importance to reaffirming the people’s faith \r\nin parliamentary democracy and ensuring a successful \r\npolitical transition. \r\n These successes in the political, social and \r\neconomic fields would not have been possible without \r\nthe support of our development partners, bilateral and \r\nmultilateral. To them I offer our deep gratitude and \r\nappreciation, and we look forward to their continued \r\nassistance and support during this critical transitional \r\nphase. \r\n It is becoming increasingly evident that the \r\nimpact of continuing climate change cannot be ignored. \r\nWhile its adverse effects will spare none, small \r\nA/64/PV.11  \r\n \r\n09-52598 46 \r\n \r\ndeveloping countries will bear a heavier burden, even \r\nthough they contribute the least to the causes. Despite \r\nBhutan’s negligible emission of greenhouse gases, our \r\nfragile mountain ecology faces potential threats, \r\nprimarily the adverse impact on agriculture, which is \r\nthe mainstay of our people. Erratic and severe weather \r\npatterns and the threat of glacial lake outburst floods \r\nare of particular concern to Bhutan. Other hazards, \r\nsuch as flash floods, landslides, forest fires and \r\ndroughts, are also likely to increase. When Cyclone \r\nAila hit the Bay of Bengal in May, it also had \r\ndisastrous and widespread effects in Bhutan, touching \r\nevery corner of the country. Precious lives were lost; \r\npower and water supplies affected; roads, bridges and \r\nvital infrastructure damaged. Farms, the most \r\nvulnerable sector, were the worst affected. \r\n Our capacity to carry out adaptation and \r\nmitigation measures is severely constrained by our lack \r\nof scientific, technical and financial resources. Bhutan \r\nhas always maintained that climate change must be \r\naddressed within the framework of sustainable \r\ndevelopment. The issues are inextricably linked to \r\ndevelopment, and any debate on the subject must take \r\ninto consideration equity and the right of developing \r\ncountries to be able to provide their people with better \r\nlivelihoods. \r\n My delegation appreciates the initiative of the \r\nSecretary-General in convening the high-level Summit \r\non Climate Change. It provided the necessary political \r\nimpetus for negotiations to be concluded in \r\nCopenhagen this December. We must now advance the \r\nprogress of the multilateral negotiations in every \r\npossible way to ensure that tangible results are \r\nachieved in Copenhagen for the well-being of present \r\nand future generations. In this regard, I am pleased to \r\ninform this gathering that Bhutan will assume the chair \r\nof and host the sixteenth summit of the South Asian \r\nAssociation for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) in \r\nApril 2010. Given the importance of the subject, \r\nclimate change and environment will be the Summit’s \r\ntheme, and the issue will receive our leaders’ highest \r\nattention when they meet in Thimphu. \r\n Terrorism in all forms and manifestations is a \r\nserious threat to domestic as well as global peace and \r\nsecurity. It endangers and undermines our common \r\nvalues of respect for human rights and the rule of law, \r\nand our basic desire to live in peace and harmony. \r\nPreventing terrorism preserves these fundamental \r\nvalues, through which we can achieve lasting peace \r\nand security. \r\n Even my country, which has always enjoyed \r\npeace and stability, has not been spared this evil \r\nmenace. Bhutan therefore fully supports the \r\ninternational consensus on taking firm action against \r\nterrorism. The General Assembly’s adoption of the \r\nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288) \r\nwas an important political achievement that represents \r\nour common approach to combating the scourge of \r\nglobal terrorism. We must show similar commitment in \r\nconcluding a comprehensive convention on \r\ninternational terrorism. Within our region, the leaders \r\nof SAARC have concluded an agreement on mutual \r\nlegal assistance in criminal matters, reaffirming our \r\nregion’s commitment to collectively addressing the \r\nevils of terrorism. \r\n Bhutan accords high importance to reform of the \r\nUnited Nations, particularly the revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and reform of the Security Council. \r\nWe fully support the expansion of the Security Council \r\nin both its permanent and non-permanent membership. \r\nFor their active role in global affairs and their capacity \r\nand resources to shoulder greater responsibilities, \r\nreflect present global realities and make the United \r\nNations more representative, we fully support electing \r\nIndia, Japan, Brazil and Germany, plus two African \r\ncountries, to be permanent Security Council members.  \r\n My delegation is greatly encouraged by the \r\nmomentum gained in the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on the reform process. We hope that the \r\nsixty-fourth session will build on the progress achieved \r\nso far and bring this long-drawn-out process to a \r\nsuccessful conclusion under Mr. Treki’s leadership. \r\n Natural calamities are occurring regularly every \r\nyear, and smaller developing countries are increasingly \r\nfaced with the challenge of coping with such problems. \r\nJust last week, my country was severely affected by an \r\nearthquake that measured 6.3 on the Richter scale. It is \r\none of the biggest disasters we have experienced in \r\nrecent times. Its devastating effects were felt in six \r\ndistricts of eastern Bhutan, where 13 people lost their \r\nlives and many were left injured and homeless. About \r\n1,900 homes, numerous schools, Government offices \r\nand historical monuments were destroyed or damaged. \r\nThe full impact is still being ascertained. During this \r\ndifficult period, we have been comforted by the \r\noutpouring of support from friendly countries such as \r\n A/64/PV.11\r\n \r\n47 09-52598 \r\n \r\nIndia and others, which have rendered much-needed \r\ntechnical and financial assistance for the massive relief \r\nwork. \r\n Given the increasing frequency of such severe \r\nnatural calamities and their negative effects on many \r\nparts of the world, there is a need for institutionalized \r\ndisaster preparedness and response mechanisms at the \r\nnational, regional and global levels. In this context, the \r\nestablishment of the United Nations Central Emergency \r\nFund is an important step towards providing the \r\ndisaster relief that is urgently required for life-saving \r\noperations. Bearing this in mind and as an expression \r\nof our continued support for the commendable \r\nhumanitarian work of the United Nations, Bhutan has \r\nmade a modest contribution to the Fund, which we \r\nhope to increase in the coming years. \r\n These are indeed difficult times with multiple \r\ncrises hitting us simultaneously. The threat of climate \r\nchange is real and its effects are occurring even as I \r\nspeak. Global governance needs to be made more \r\neffective to help us address the global challenges more \r\nefficiently. In this interdependent world, it will be \r\nimpossible for any country to act alone in resolving \r\nthese crises. Therefore, as we gather here once again to \r\ndeliberate and find solutions to the many difficult \r\nproblems confronting us, I conclude by reiterating my \r\ndelegation’s full support and cooperation in working \r\ntowards addressing our common challenges.  \r\nThe meeting rose at 2.05 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n"
