(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 9.10 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n The President: I call first on His Excellency \r\nMr. Peter David, Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nGrenada. \r\n Mr. David (Grenada): I am honoured, Sir, to add \r\nGrenada’s voice to the many warm congratulations \r\noffered you on your election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. Grenada \r\nlooks forward to working with you and pledges to \r\nsupport your leadership as you exercise impartial \r\nstewardship over this fine institution. Equally, we \r\ncommend your predecessor, Father Miguel d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann, for his dedication and conviction in \r\npursuing the vision of the United Nations as a home for \r\nsocial justice for all, particularly those who carry the \r\ngreatest burden. \r\n Through you, Mr. President, Grenada wishes to \r\nhighly commend Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and \r\nhis staff for their performance over the past year in \r\nadvancing the work of this Organization and \r\n“delivering as one”. We thank the Secretary-General \r\nfor his interest and participation in the recently \r\nconcluded Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) \r\nClimate Change Summit, chaired by Grenada. We wish \r\nhim and the Secretariat every continued success. \r\n The challenges facing the global community are \r\nmirrored in our regional and national context. \r\nFortunately, we have no better place than within these \r\nhallowed walls to continue the long and important \r\njourney of building a better world. We cannot respond \r\nto one challenge and choose to ignore another, because \r\nall of them are interconnected. Indeed, working \r\ntogether is our raison d’être — the essence of the \r\n“united” in the United Nations. \r\n Climate change is rightfully described as the most \r\nurgent threat facing mankind, and, at least for the next \r\nseveral months, it will remain at the top of the global \r\ndiplomatic and negotiating agenda. But what is the \r\nchallenge of climate change if not a risk to \r\ndevelopment, security and peace? What is the threat of \r\nclimate change, if not a threat to the very notion of \r\nhuman survival and ecological balance? For small \r\nStates, this threat is particularly pronounced. \r\n Today, I address this Assembly on the heels of \r\ntwo very important responses to climate change — the \r\nAOSIS Climate Change Summit and the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s summit on climate change. What is clear \r\nfrom these very well attended global meetings is that \r\nfor developing countries such as Grenada, the alarm \r\nhas been sounded — the alarm that climate change is \r\nbearing down on our countries and undermining our \r\npotential for both economic recovery in the short term \r\nand economic growth in the longer term. \r\n It is hampering our efforts to attain sustainable \r\ndevelopment, as set out in the Barbados Plan of Action \r\nand the Mauritius Strategy for Further Implementation. \r\nIn the case of Grenada, this is due to our dependence \r\non our natural resource base, which supports \r\nA/64/PV.13 \r\n \r\n09-53165 2 \r\n \r\nagriculture and tourism. Together, they account for \r\nmore than 40 per cent of our gross domestic product \r\n(GDP), and they are extremely vulnerable to the \r\nnegative impacts of storms, hurricanes and other \r\neconomically disruptive events induced by climate \r\nchange. Hurricane Ivan in 2004 brought home this \r\nreality, causing damage estimated to be equivalent to \r\n204 per cent of GDP at the time. The country is still \r\nrecovering from that event. Grenada is not unique \r\namong small island States around the world in \r\nexperiencing those impacts. \r\n The gap in terms of the experience of the reality \r\nof climate change between those Member States \r\nalready impacted and all others needs to be urgently \r\nbridged. If we fail to do that, the United Nations itself \r\nwill have to bear the consequences of the humanitarian \r\nand environmental crisis resulting from the fact that \r\nsome islands will no longer be inhabitable. \r\n When my Prime Minister, the Honourable \r\nTillman Thomas, addressed the Secretary-General’s \r\nsummit on 22 September, he spoke on behalf of the \r\nmost vulnerable States. For these 80 or more poor \r\nisland and landlocked States, a rise in temperature of \r\ntwo degrees Celsius is unacceptable, for our safety and \r\nsurvival will most certainly be at risk. That is why we \r\ninsist on a global commitment to ensuring an average \r\ntemperature increase of no more than 1.5 degrees \r\nCelsius, accompanied by appropriate midterm targets \r\nof a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by more \r\nthan 45 per cent of 1990 levels by 2020 and by more \r\nthan 95 per cent by 2050. These reduction levels \r\nrespond to our vulnerabilities, and surely, in a United \r\nNations system to which we all belong, it is \r\nunthinkable that known threats will be allowed to turn \r\ninto grave risks.  \r\n We must solve the climate change crisis and we \r\nmust solve it now. Estimates place the cost of financing \r\nadaptation and mitigation at about 1 per cent of the \r\nindustrialized world’s GDP — that is a contribution of \r\n$10,000 for every million dollars of GDP. Given the \r\nmoral principle of historical responsibility, this is \r\naffordable by any measure. \r\n With the adoption of the AOSIS Climate Change \r\nDeclaration, small island States have said we will not \r\nstand by and watch our islands sink, see our \r\nlivelihoods disappear and witness our children made \r\nhomeless due to the effects of human-induced climate \r\nchange. We again call on the international community \r\nto stand in support of the most vulnerable, so as to \r\nensure that the targets set forth in the AOSIS Climate \r\nChange Declaration are agreed to in Copenhagen. \r\nGrenada will continue to play its part in highlighting \r\nthe needs of the most vulnerable while advocating for \r\nthe strengthening of their capacity for resilience. While \r\nit continues to chair AOSIS, Grenada will always \r\nadvocate for sustainable development goals as well as \r\nfor agreements in the Copenhagen negotiations that are \r\ncommensurate to the level of the threat. \r\n The financial and economic crises continue to \r\nundermine economies worldwide. The green shoots of \r\nrecovery need to blossom everywhere. Grenada \r\ncontinues to insist, as our Prime Minister Tillman \r\nThomas stated at the June summit on the crisis, that the \r\nglobal financial and economic architecture needs \r\nfundamental and far-reaching reforms (see \r\nA/CONF.214/PV.1). Changes are needed in its rules, \r\nregulations and governance in order to facilitate the \r\neffective participation of small economies, which \r\nsuffer the effects of the crises harder and longer. Here, \r\nwe wish to echo the call for reform of the international \r\nfinancial institutions, particularly the call for a review \r\nof the policy conditions attached to lending by the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund. \r\n Grenada continues to pursue sustainable \r\neconomic development and prosperity for our people, \r\nas they show resilience to economic setbacks. A study \r\nby the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United \r\nNations shows that Latin America and the Caribbean \r\nwas the most successful region before the surge in food \r\nprices in 2008. That affirms our efforts.  \r\n However, another study showed that in times of \r\ncrisis, social spending does not favour the poor and \r\ndevelopment goals are stymied. This is our fear, and it \r\nis also our reality. That is why the Government \r\nintroduced a package of measures, greatly supported by \r\nfinancing from the Trinidad and Tobago Petroleum \r\nFund, which has begun to lay the basis for developing \r\na low-carbon and rights-based economic development \r\nmodel. In this regard, we wish to thank the \r\nGovernment of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago \r\nfor its continued assistance to Grenada and to the \r\nCaribbean region through its contribution to this Fund. \r\nWe are also grateful for the Petrocaribe agreement with \r\nthe Government of the Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela, through which several Caribbean countries \r\nare able to purchase oil on softer terms. \r\n A/64/PV.13\r\n \r\n3 09-53165 \r\n \r\n Grenada has put in place strategic initiatives that \r\ninclude revitalizing the agricultural sector, increasing \r\nlabour productivity, diversifying the export-services \r\nsector, strengthening the national investment \r\nenvironment and modernizing our tax system. In \r\nimplementing those initiatives, we seek partnerships \r\nwith the international community and the United \r\nNations system. \r\n Trade continues to be of major importance to \r\nGrenada. We are experiencing severe setbacks from the \r\nloss of preferential treatment in agricultural markets. \r\nWe are among the smallest and most open markets in \r\nthe world. And yet larger countries contest whatever \r\nbenefits we receive to offset the disadvantages of our \r\nsmall economic size, which are compounded by high \r\ntransportation cost and energy prices. \r\n Grenada is pleased that the United Nations \r\nsystem continues to pursue economic growth and \r\ndevelopment. We support the perspective that any \r\noutcome in Copenhagen must be a development \r\noutcome, for each is connected to the other. We urge \r\nsupport for meeting the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. We have made progress by achieving 80 per \r\ncent primary school enrolment, by reducing violence \r\nagainst women and by scaling up access to \r\nantiretroviral drugs for persons living with HIV/AIDS.  \r\n All the same, Grenada is striving to achieve a \r\nfaster rate of poverty eradication. That goal, however, \r\nis hampered by the drop in revenue caused by the \r\neconomic downturn and by our heavy debt burden, \r\nwhich now stands at 107 per cent of GDP. That is why \r\nwe add our voice to the call for a review of the criteria \r\nfor determining middle-income status. For while we \r\nwelcome efforts to assist highly indebted poor \r\ncountries, States such as Grenada that are currently \r\nreferred to as highly indebted middle-income countries \r\ndeserve special attention. \r\n The Government of Grenada favours peace and \r\nreconciliation, aspiring to bring people together to \r\nwork for a common good. From that platform we \r\npursue true partnership for development, beginning \r\nwith the private sector, trade unions and civil society. \r\nTogether, then, as one nation, we face the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n Development is important in its own right. It also \r\nserves as a guarantor for peace and security. We urge \r\nthe United Nations to continue its efforts in \r\npeacebuilding and peacekeeping. My country continues \r\nto support those efforts in the Caribbean region, to \r\nwhich we have contributed a small number of officers. \r\n We welcome the reopening of the office of the \r\nUnited Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in Barbados \r\nto serve the eastern Caribbean region, and we highlight \r\nthe need for more intervention to stop drug trafficking.  \r\n In our region, the proliferation of small arms is as \r\nlethal as nuclear weapons. So while we welcome the \r\nunanimously adopted Security Council resolution \r\n1887 (2009) on nuclear disarmament, shepherded by \r\nPresident Obama, we in the Caribbean call for an \r\nagreement on the small arms trade. \r\n Grenada again calls the Assembly’s attention to \r\nthe need to ensure the protection of the Caribbean Sea. \r\nThe States of the Caribbean Community and members \r\nof the Association of Caribbean States depend on the \r\ntremendous benefits from the pristine waters of the \r\nCaribbean Sea. Yet those ocean-based resources are \r\nthreatened by the trans-shipment of nuclear and other \r\nhazardous waste materials through our waters. We look \r\nto the General Assembly to strengthen the resolution \r\non this issue and to ensure that the threat is removed as \r\nsoon as possible. \r\n In what United States President Barack Obama \r\ncalls the new era of engagement, we believe that we \r\nface three major undertakings. The first is to respond to \r\nwhatever threatens us at a level commensurate to the \r\nthreat; second, to strengthen the institutional capacity \r\nof the United Nations to enable it to respond; and third, \r\nthe sacredness of this grand institution to inspire \r\nhumanity. \r\n In this endeavour, Grenada is guided by its \r\nnational values, the principles of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and its participation in the hemispheric \r\nsystem and the Caribbean regional integration process. \r\nConsequently, we reject the removal of the duly elected \r\nhead of State in Honduras and call for the immediate \r\nrestoration of President José Manuel Zelaya to the \r\nposition to which he was legitimately elected. \r\n The maintenance of the 40-year United States \r\nembargo against Cuba and the failure to bring into \r\nbeing a homeland and State for the Palestinian people, \r\ndespite numerous United Nations resolutions on both \r\nissues, remain of deep concern, for they violate the \r\nspirit and letter of international law, on which this \r\nOrganization is founded. We join the entire Caribbean \r\ncommunity in calling for an end to the United States \r\nA/64/PV.13 \r\n \r\n09-53165 4 \r\n \r\nembargo against Cuba and urge the normalization of \r\nrelations between the two countries. We call for a \r\nsincere engagement to resolve the long-standing \r\nPalestinian-Israeli and wider Middle East conflict. \r\nResolution of those entrenched conflicts will generate \r\nthe momentum needed for resolving similar conflicts in \r\nother regions in Africa and elsewhere. \r\n The United Nations plays a critical role in every \r\nfacet of global affairs. That is its strength. To become \r\nmore effective, the Organization must necessarily \r\nbecome stronger, and that is why the resolution on \r\nsystem-wide coherence is timely and has our support. \r\nLikewise, the reform of the Security Council must not \r\nbe put off for another 16 years. Reform must mean \r\ngreater democratization by removing the veto, \r\nenlarging permanent and non-permanent categories and \r\nmaking operating rules and procedures transparent. \r\n Grenada is proud to continue playing its role at \r\nthe United Nations. We support the pursuit of \r\ninternational peace and security, the rule of law and the \r\nfight against terrorism and for the eradication of \r\npoverty and the promotion of human rights. We support \r\nthe agenda of the Non-Aligned Movement, and the \r\nGroup of 77 and China. We support the just ambitions \r\nof Africa, and we proudly support the initiative of the \r\nGovernment of South Africa to mark and celebrate, \r\nacross the globe, 18 July as Nelson Mandela Day, a day \r\nof selfless giving. \r\n We welcome the United Nations support for the \r\ninitiative to establish the permanent memorial to \r\nhonour the victims of slavery and the transatlantic \r\nslave trade: lest we forget. That memorial is addressed \r\nto all humanity so that we may draw the lessons of \r\nyesteryear for our empowerment. We thank all Member \r\nStates which have already contributed, and we \r\nencourage others to support the Permanent Memorial \r\nFund. \r\n Grenada continues to value the role of the United \r\nNations as the pre-eminent institution for effecting \r\nmultilateral diplomacy. We support its ability to ensure \r\ninternational peace and stability and to accord a voice \r\nto all sovereign States, as enshrined in its Charter. We \r\nhave made significant and meaningful progress in \r\nprevious sessions of the General Assembly. Let this \r\nsixty-fourth session be another outstanding forward \r\nmovement in meeting the most pressing global \r\nchallenges of our time. \r\n The President: I now call on The Honourable \r\nSamuel T. Abal, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Trade \r\nand Immigration of Papua New Guinea. \r\n Mr. Abal (Papua New Guinea): It is indeed my \r\nhonour and privilege, Mr. President, to bring you, on \r\nbehalf of the people and Government of Papua New \r\nGuinea, our warmest greetings and to pledge our \r\nsupport as you preside over the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-fourth session. We thank your predecessor, His \r\nExcellency Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann, for his \r\nstrong leadership during his tenure as President of the \r\nAssembly at its sixty-third session. \r\n We would like to reiterate our support for the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, the United \r\nNations agencies such as the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) and UNICEF for \r\ntheir efforts to enhance the benevolent work they do \r\nfor the world and Papua New Guinea. \r\n When God distributed the peoples of the world \r\neverywhere, he wedged in Papua New Guinea, a small \r\ncountry of 6.5 million people, between the South \r\nPacific and the South-East Asia. It has been a privilege \r\nthat has allowed us to appreciate the peaceful and \r\ncolourful people of the Pacific as well as the dynamic \r\nnations of South-East Asia. We may not be a large \r\ncountry or a country of economic or military power, \r\nbut in our own way and from our own standpoint, we \r\nhave a right to contribute to the world among other \r\nnations, to collectively approach issues and problems \r\nand to speak out whether in support or in disagreement. \r\n Very recently, on 16 September, we celebrated the \r\nthirty-fourth anniversary of our independence. But an \r\nimportant achievement for us was the fact that by the \r\ngrace of God, we have had an unbroken constitutional \r\ndemocracy for those 34 years. Our current Prime \r\nMinister, the Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare, has \r\nbeen in Parliament for 41 years. He is the founding \r\nPrime Minister and has been ousted only through a \r\nparliamentary constitutional vote and has returned \r\nthree times as Prime Minister, the current term being \r\nhis fourth. I am mentioning this because Papua New \r\nGuinea is contributing to democracy in the world. \r\nThrough its democratic form of government, in a \r\nnation of over 800 languages and cultures, a people of \r\ndiversity can find a way towards harmony and political \r\nacceptance of one another. \r\n We are proud of that achievement, but we are also \r\nmindful of the many critical challenges that lie ahead \r\n A/64/PV.13\r\n \r\n5 09-53165 \r\n \r\nof us as we develop and progress. Many are challenges \r\nthat cannot be handled by one individual country — \r\nwhether large or small — on its own. The United \r\nNations must therefore continue to provide the global \r\nforum for all Member States, big and small, powerful \r\nand weak, to come together to address the many global \r\nissues and challenges we face collectively as a human \r\nfamily. And together we must confront, first, the \r\ncontinuing threats of climate change and global \r\nwarming, the global food crisis now compounded by \r\nthe global financial crisis, and the threats of diseases \r\nthat know no borders, such as H1N1, HIV/AIDS, \r\nmalaria, tuberculosis, cholera, et cetera. Secondly, we \r\nmust achieve together the social agenda of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\n Papua New Guinea firmly believes that \r\nstrengthening international peace and security is \r\nfundamental and is a prerequisite to achieving human \r\ndevelopment, progress and prosperity. My country \r\ndenounces weapons of mass destruction and is fully \r\ncommitted to the principles of a world free from \r\nweapons of mass terror. That is attested to by the fact \r\nthat we are a State party to the South Pacific Nuclear \r\nFree Zone Treaty and also fully support the Treaty on \r\nthe South-East Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone. \r\n We are now working earnestly towards early \r\nratification of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-\r\nTest-Ban Treaty. We also look forward to contributing \r\nconstructively to United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations. Papua New Guinea therefore welcomes \r\npositive initiatives of the new United States \r\nGovernment and other like-minded countries to \r\nenhance the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and \r\nencourage disarmament. \r\n A continuing major concern of Papua New \r\nGuinea is the increase in global conflicts heightened by \r\nthe illicit trade and use of small arms and light \r\nweapons, which continue to cause untold suffering to \r\nmillions of people around the world. The people of \r\nPapua New Guinea are no exception. The global debate \r\non small arms has focused on curbing their use. \r\nHowever, the supply side of weapons is never \r\ncomprehensively discussed. We therefore support a \r\nproposed arms trade treaty, which is still in \r\nnegotiations and which will deal with one of the key \r\nelements of the arms issue. \r\n In Papua New Guinea we have seen the presence \r\nof small arms and light weapons threaten the stability \r\nof communities. My Government prioritized the need \r\nto comprehensively address this issue through \r\ncommissioning the 2005 National Gun Summit Report, \r\nwhich will be implemented soon. \r\n The various global crises of today have had a \r\ndisproportionate negative impact on many developing \r\ncountries. From falling commodity prices to increases \r\nin food and energy costs, the damages caused and the \r\ncosts incurred to redress them have heavily impacted \r\ntheir development. The impact of the crisis has also \r\nreduced levels of official development assistance \r\nglobally and resulted in big shortfalls in the national \r\nbudgets of developing countries.  \r\n While we appreciate that many countries have \r\nhad to assist their economies by massive injections of \r\ncapital, we nevertheless support the strong call for \r\nreforms of the international financial architecture to \r\ninclude major developing countries like China and \r\nIndia. Such reforms would better reflect today’s global \r\neconomic realities and provide effective management \r\nof the global process, which needs to be fair, equitable \r\nand transparent. \r\n At the 2005 World Summit, leaders agreed to a \r\nset of broad reforms to the United Nations. Since then, \r\nthe Human Rights Council and the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission have been established. Furthermore, the \r\nconcept of the responsibility to protect has received \r\nbroad support, with an inclusive process now under \r\nway to better elaborate it. \r\n We support the continuing call for the reform of \r\nthe Security Council in both the permanent and \r\nnon-permanent membership categories. In this regard, \r\nwe support the ongoing intergovernmental negotiations \r\nwithin the General Assembly, which have seen the \r\nemergence of strong agreement on certain issues. \r\n We note that great strides are being made in \r\nreforming the global gender architecture. We applaud \r\nthe strong but cautious consensus reached at the sixty-\r\nthird session of the General Assembly to support the \r\ncreation of an Under-Secretary-General post to assist in \r\nbetter management of the various United Nations \r\nentities dealing with the gender issues. We take note of \r\nand commend the work of former Prime Minister of \r\nNew Zealand, Her Excellency Helen Clark, as the \r\nUNDP Administrator. We therefore strongly support \r\nthe ongoing reform, as the gender issue in its entirety \r\nA/64/PV.13 \r\n \r\n09-53165 6 \r\n \r\nremains one of the key policy issues of my \r\nGovernment. \r\n As a growing democracy in the Pacific, it is my \r\nGovernment’s desire to see our friends and neighbours \r\nin the Pacific and beyond enjoy freedom and \r\nprosperity. We reaffirm our continuing support for our \r\nPacific neighbours in their development aspirations. \r\nWe feel that on the issue of Fiji we need to continue \r\ndialogue and not to isolate them. We also support the \r\nmain thrust of the Pacific Plan and encourage our \r\nForum dialogue partners to assist with its ongoing \r\nimplementation, as we believe it will catalyse the \r\nPacific region’s development. \r\n The social sector of many of our developing \r\ncountries suffers greatly, and the United Nations has \r\nquite rightly set the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nThey provide us with one of the greatest opportunities \r\nto leverage our development process. We commend and \r\nstrongly support the Secretary-General for his proposal \r\nto convene a high-level session on the MDGs in \r\nSeptember 2010. \r\n Achieving the MDGs remains an integral \r\ndevelopment priority of our Government. We are \r\nworking to achieve the Goals in close cooperation with \r\nall stakeholders, including civil society and \r\ninternational development partners such as the United \r\nNations and its agencies, the Commonwealth, the \r\nPacific Islands Forum Secretariat and the South Pacific \r\nCommunity.  \r\n The MDGs have been incorporated into our \r\nMedium-Term Development Strategy, which focuses \r\non 15 national targets and 67 indicators under the \r\nNational Road Map. They are specifically designed for \r\nPapua New Guinea to reflect the nation’s stage of \r\ndevelopment. MDG 8 is ongoing through international \r\ncooperation with bilateral and multilateral development \r\npartners. \r\n The Joint MDGs Project was launched in August \r\n2008 and comprises the National MDGs Steering \r\nCommittee, made up of representatives of the \r\nGovernment, the United Nations, academia and civil \r\nsociety. The Project is mandated to build national \r\nawareness and facilitate a strong data collection and \r\nanalysis regime in the country. The Project also serves \r\nas a constituency for the Medium-Term Development \r\nStrategy and the MDGs. \r\n The Government has localized the Paris \r\nDeclaration on Aid Effectiveness by reaffirming its \r\nprinciples in the Kavieng Declaration to foster \r\ncollaborative commitments with our development \r\npartners in pursuing the achievement of the MDGs. \r\nOur long-term aim is to grow our economy to such a \r\nlevel as to allow us to exit from our dependency on aid. \r\nWe want to be economically independent; we choose \r\nnot to be aid-dependent forever. We want to give aid \r\nand not receive it. Our aim is also to assist others from \r\nthe richness of God’s blessings on us. \r\n The Government recognizes that greater and \r\nsustained commitment to implement policies at all \r\nlevels is needed to achieve the MDGs. That \r\ncommitment will also be supported by ongoing public \r\nsector reforms, especially in relation to delivery of \r\nbasic services to our rural majority.  \r\n For the MDGs to be achieved, strong and viable \r\npartnerships must exist.  \r\n MDG 8 is critical to the achievement of the other \r\nseven Goals. However, all our partnerships must be \r\nunderpinned by mutual respect between the partners \r\nand the Government. Some of our key partners include \r\nAustralia, New Zealand, the European Union, Japan, \r\nChina, the United States, Italy and Austria, along with \r\nmany non-governmental organizations, such as the \r\nClinton Foundation and the Bill \u0026 Melinda Gates \r\nFoundation, which continue to strongly contribute to \r\nPapua New Guinea’s development. \r\n Climate change has emerged as one of the \r\ngreatest crises now facing humanity. The consequences \r\nappear dire, and they are truly global. Such a global \r\nchallenge can only be met by a concerted global \r\nresponse. \r\n In Papua New Guinea today, we see evidence of \r\nclimate change in the inundation of coastal areas, an \r\nincrease in malaria due to warming in the highlands \r\nregion of the country, and especially in the plight of the \r\npeople of the Carteret Islands, where sea level has risen \r\nand some 1,200 people have had to be resettled. \r\n We therefore strongly support the recent Alliance \r\nof Small Island States declaration on climate change. \r\nFor many small island States to survive, we must strive \r\nto roll back atmospheric carbon concentrations to less \r\nthan 350 parts per million and limit temperature rise to \r\nless than 1.5 degrees Celsius. Therefore, emissions of \r\ngreenhouse gases must peak by 2015 and be followed \r\n A/64/PV.13\r\n \r\n7 09-53165 \r\n \r\nby reductions of 45 per cent by 2020 and 90 per cent \r\nbefore 2050. Further, we will require healthy and \r\nexpanded forest cover and widely available low carbon \r\ntechnologies, including carbon capture and storage. \r\n In this context, the importance and urgency of \r\nextensive action on reducing emissions from \r\ndeforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) can \r\nhardly be overstated, and many delegations have \r\nspoken on it. Deforestation continues at an alarming \r\npace, with around 13 million hectares of the world’s \r\nforests being lost annually — an area the size of \r\nDenmark, Norway and Belgium combined. \r\n The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \r\n(IPCC) estimates that deforestation and degradation in \r\ndeveloping countries may contribute to approximately \r\n20 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions caused \r\nby humans, while also representing around 30 per cent \r\nof the total cost-effective mitigation potential in the \r\nperiod up to 2020. Any solution to the problem should \r\nthus attract 20 per cent of any financial or institutional \r\nresponse. \r\n It is worth stressing that, without rapid and \r\nsignificant reductions in emissions from deforestation \r\nand forest degradation in developing countries, added \r\nto deep emissions reductions by rich countries, it may \r\nbe impossible to avoid global warming levels that will \r\nprove catastrophic for many vulnerable nations. \r\nWithout question, immediate action on REDD+ is a \r\ncrucial part of the climate change solution. Under the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange, we will therefore require strong institutional \r\nframeworks for REDD+, including accommodating \r\ndifferent national circumstances and providing for \r\nresource mobilization. \r\n We also recognize the excellent work and \r\nanalysis under way via the Informal Working Group on \r\nInterim Finance for REDD. This work estimates that, if \r\na total of €15 to €25 billion were provided to catalyse \r\nearly action from 2010 to 2015, then a 25 per cent \r\nreduction in annual global deforestation rates may be \r\nachieved by around 2015. \r\n Deforestation and degradation in developing \r\ncountries are the results of the stark economic need for \r\nlocal communities to survive that propels the \r\ndestruction of forests. How do we keep the trees \r\nstanding to sequester carbon? \r\n There is hope. Significantly, early actions for \r\nREDD+ can be achieved at a reasonable cost, while \r\nprotecting the livelihoods of indigenous peoples and \r\nlocal communities, protecting biodiversity, rainfall \r\npatterns and soil quality, and helping countries to adapt \r\nto climate change. To succeed, a REDD+ mechanism \r\nshould accommodate countries at different levels of \r\ndevelopment through a phased approach. The \r\nagreement should be results-based and incentives-\r\ndriven. To achieve that, it must include both a reliable \r\nframework for monitoring, reporting and verification, \r\nand encourage a predictable and sustainable system for \r\nfinancing. \r\n We must succeed in Copenhagen. If we are to \r\nsucceed, rich countries must come forward and take the \r\nlead. Without their collective leadership on emissions \r\nreductions, finance and technology, the Governments \r\nof developing countries will not be able to make a \r\ncompelling case at home to get people to allow trees to \r\nbe left standing. As a result, 20 per cent of carbon \r\nemissions will continue to flow into the atmosphere. \r\nTherefore, let me be candid. Without a transformative \r\ngrand financial bargain in Copenhagen that involves all \r\nnations, there could be no deal. \r\n Let me conclude by repeating that the United \r\nNations is the forum for agreeing on solutions for \r\nproblems and challenges. In times of global crises such \r\nas climate change, financial meltdown and social \r\nsector vulnerabilities, there is also opportunity. Indeed, \r\nthere is opportunity here, if we remember that MDG 8 \r\nallows us to leverage the greatest asset we have: strong \r\npartnerships between nations, both rich and poor. \r\n More than ever before, we need the political will \r\nof the leading developed and developing countries, for \r\nthe sake of the children of the world and for \r\ngenerations after them. I ask the General Assembly to \r\nplease consider this and make a stroke for history.  \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Samuel Santos López, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof the Republic of Nicaragua. \r\n Mr. Santos López (Nicaragua) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): Thirty years after the triumph of the people’s \r\nSandinista Revolution and the start of a process of \r\npopular and participatory democracy, on behalf of the \r\nPresident of Nicaragua and Commander of the \r\nRevolution, Mr. Daniel Ortega Saavedra, I salute and \r\ncongratulate you, Mr. President, on your election as \r\nA/64/PV.13 \r\n \r\n09-53165 8 \r\n \r\nPresident of this Assembly, which it is my honour to \r\naddress. \r\n Nicaragua is a country impoverished by historical \r\ncircumstances no different from, if not identical to, the \r\nhistories and circumstances of countries of our Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean region and others around the \r\nworld. This history has been repeated over time and \r\nspace, as we will outline later. Nevertheless, Nicaragua \r\nremains a land rich in beauty and natural resources. It \r\nis a nation symbolic of reconciliation and of national \r\nand international unity. \r\n Although few may know this, our country is one \r\nof the safest countries of this continent. Nicaragua is \r\nengaged in an exemplary, tireless and decisive \r\ncampaign against organized and petty crime in an \r\nexemplary fashion, as acknowledged by international \r\nbodies and authorities. It does so not only with \r\ncoercive and punitive measures, but, more \r\nsignificantly, by building an alternative model of \r\ndevelopment that transforms the structures of poverty \r\nand marginalization that are the breeding ground of \r\npublic security problems. Our model is based on \r\ndemocratic reform expressed by the people’s will, \r\nwhich we call “citizen power”. \r\n By means of the “From Martí to Fidel” campaign, \r\nilliteracy has been reduced to 3.16 per cent. We have \r\nmade progress in preventive medicine and have \r\nsuccessfully controlled pandemics, such as that of the \r\nA (H1N1) virus. In our country, the mortality rate from \r\nthis disease is one of the two lowest in America. These \r\nachievements have been made possible by the generous \r\nsolidarity of the fraternal people and Government of \r\nCuba, which has been consistent and has perpetuated \r\nthe internationalist calling of Commander Fidel Castro \r\nRuz. \r\n The Government of Nicaragua has opened the \r\ndoor to production credits. The Food and Agriculture \r\nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO) selected our \r\nschool nutrition programme as one of the top four in \r\nthe world. In that spirit, President Daniel Ortega has \r\nproposed the adoption of a Central American \r\nagriculture policy to transform the region into a food \r\nproduction zone, and in that same spirit, we welcome \r\nand support the World Summit on Food Security \r\nscheduled for November of this year. \r\n Today, we have an electrical power reserve of \r\n42.6 per cent, although barely two years ago there was \r\na shortfall of 3.29 per cent. This is thanks to the \r\nsolidarity of the Bolivarian Government of Venezuela \r\nunder the leadership of its President, Commander Hugo \r\nChávez Frías. Meanwhile, we continue to make \r\ntargeted efforts to promote the use of alternative \r\nrenewable energy sources, such as water, wind, \r\ngeothermal, solar power and, more recently, biomass. \r\nWe also support initiatives aimed at developing civilian \r\nnuclear energy for peaceful purposes. \r\n Clean drinking water has been made available to \r\n217,000 families. We have launched programmes such \r\nas Zero Hunger and Zero Usury, which were \r\nhighlighted in a report by the United Nations Special \r\nRapporteur on the right to food. In order to refute the \r\ndaily lies of certain media outlets in Nicaragua, FAO \r\nrecently issued a published notice of the positive \r\nresults of the programmes it coordinates with the \r\nNicaraguan Government to fight hunger and extreme \r\npoverty. \r\n Food security cannot continue to be subject to the \r\ngreediness of a few. There is enough food to nourish \r\ntwice the current world population, but thousands die \r\nevery minute around the world. While in some \r\ncountries automobiles are fed, millions of boys and \r\ngirls die with an empty stomach. That is simply \r\ncriminal. \r\n We also express our profound rejection of the \r\ndiscrimination and persecution of immigrants and \r\nunequivocally support full respect for their human \r\nrights. The Government of National Reconciliation and \r\nUnity also seeks to reverse the exclusion to which \r\nnative peoples and communities of African descent \r\nhave been subject throughout history. \r\n Nicaragua is the enemy of terrorism in any of its \r\nforms, including State-sponsored terrorism. It is for \r\nthat and many other reasons that we oppose the \r\ncriminal embargo against the heroic people of Cuba, \r\nsix generations of whom have been born since the \r\nembargo began. How many more generations must \r\noutlive it? How many more resolutions must the \r\nAssembly adopt on this topic? There are already \r\n17 resolutions on this issue. \r\n It is also rightfully of interest to this Assembly \r\nthat, while a criminal murderer of Cuban athletes \r\nenjoys total liberty, five anti-terrorist Cubans are \r\nimprisoned far from their families and incommunicado \r\nfor the sole crime of simply being anti-terrorists. \r\n A/64/PV.13\r\n \r\n9 09-53165 \r\n \r\n Today’s Nicaragua is an active militant in favour \r\nof solidarity, as well as a militant supporter of \r\ngratitude. We therefore appreciate the disinterested \r\ncooperation of the sister nations that contribute to the \r\neconomic and social development of our people. We \r\nalso embrace the just cause of Puerto Rican \r\nindependence and support the return of the Malvinas \r\nIslands to their rightful owner, the Argentine people. In \r\nthe same manner, we endorse the struggles of the \r\nSaharan and Cypriot peoples.  \r\n We also call on Israel to withdraw from the \r\noccupied Syrian, Lebanese and Palestinian territories. \r\nWe stand unconditionally with the Palestinian people \r\nin their daily fight for their own sovereign State. That \r\nis why we advocate a peaceful, just and lasting solution \r\nthat guarantees peace in that region. One year after \r\ngaining their independence, we congratulate the \r\npeoples of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and affirm that \r\nwe have already established diplomatic relations with \r\nAbkhazia. \r\n We support the new and positive focus that \r\nTaiwan has adopted in its relations with the People’s \r\nRepublic of China, as well as its participation in United \r\nNations specialized bodies and agencies. \r\n We condemn the coup d’état in Honduras and \r\nhereby proclaim our definitive decision not to \r\nrecognize the results of any electoral farce in that \r\ncountry. By means of the coup, its perpetrators have \r\nsought to kill the democratic hopes and initiatives of \r\nthe Honduran people, just as they sought to thwart the \r\nfraternal process of Bolivarian Alternative for the \r\nAmericas (ALBA). Nonetheless, a change in Honduras \r\nthat supersedes a formal and hypocritical democracy is \r\ninevitable. \r\n From this rostrum, we denounce the massacre of \r\nthe Honduran people and point in no uncertain terms to \r\nthe assassination plot against President Zalaya. We \r\nmust heed this now, because later it will be said that he \r\ncommitted suicide. From this very moment, we \r\nunconditionally support and endorse the proposal made \r\nlast night in this same forum by the Foreign Minister of \r\nHonduras, Patricia Rodas, to the Secretary-General and \r\nthe General Assembly. \r\n The time has come to make the General Assembly \r\na forum in which substantive, irreversible decisions are \r\ntaken. We cannot continue to have a Security Council \r\nwith an abusive veto privilege. \r\n The time has also come for cooperation without \r\nhumiliating preconditions, the construction of the most \r\nbeautiful dream of Bolívar and Sandino, and the dawn \r\nof a realistic and coherent solidarity. I speak of the \r\nBolivarian Alternative for the Americas, composed of \r\nthe peoples of Antigua and Barbuda, Bolivia, Cuba, the \r\nDominican Republic, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Saint \r\nVincent and the Grenadines, Venezuela, and Honduras \r\nin its resistance. ALBA is the basis for cross-cutting \r\nand inclusive cooperation between our peoples. Its \r\nmembership increases day by day. \r\n I cannot fail to note with profound concern that \r\nwe are meeting today under economic circumstances \r\nthat are similar to or worse than those of a year ago, \r\nwhen the worst world economic depression of modern \r\ntimes arose to exacerbate the existing food, energy and \r\nenvironmental crises. Unfortunately, these world crises \r\nhave met with a decrease in official development \r\nassistance, which remains conditional thanks to the \r\ninternational financial institutions, and with the \r\nreluctance of developed countries to replace the current \r\nmodel with one that is more just and respectful of \r\nMother Nature. \r\n The United Nations Conference on the World \r\nFinancial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on \r\nDevelopment demonstrated that the Group of 192, as it \r\nhas been called by my brother, Father Miguel d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann, has a voice in world economic matters. It \r\nis within the most representative institution that \r\neconomic policies affecting millions should be \r\ndecided, and not within exclusive groups, such as the \r\nGroup of Eight or the Group of 20, defenders of the \r\nmodel of domination by the few over the majority. In \r\nthat regard, we welcome establishment of the ad hoc \r\nopen-ended working group that will follow up on the \r\noutcome of the Conference. \r\n For some years now, climate change has become \r\nnot a threat of the future, but rather a very present \r\nthreat. We believe that the United Nations Climate \r\nChange Conference, to take place in December in \r\nCopenhagen, should be a debate not on the need to act, \r\nbut rather on the need for the developed countries to \r\nfulfil their historic obligation under the Kyoto Protocol \r\nand to end their attempts to repudiate the principle of \r\ncommon but differentiated responsibility. \r\n It is time for attitudes and actions to reflect a true \r\ncommitment to counteracting the harmful effects of \r\nglobal warming. We firmly believe that it is the \r\nA/64/PV.13 \r\n \r\n09-53165 10 \r\n \r\nexclusive responsibility of the General Assembly — \r\nand in no case of the Security Council — to seek the \r\nconsensus and commitments necessary for us to move \r\nforward in this struggle, which is a struggle for the \r\nsurvival of all humankind. \r\n It is not possible to democratize selfishness, \r\nexclusion or the manipulation of truth. It is not possible \r\nto put a kind face on perversion or arrogance. That is the \r\nessence of the prevailing economic system — the \r\nexploitation of one human being by another, the \r\nsubjugation of nations, and the hoarding of wealth by \r\nthe few. \r\n This is why we are in crisis; it is not because of a \r\nlack of resources, but because of the concentration of \r\nresources in the hands of a few, because of disregard \r\nfor our environment, because of the rejection of moral \r\nvalues, because of human arrogance towards other \r\nspecies and, worst of all, because of disdain for human \r\nlife itself. \r\n We are optimistic. It is necessary to replace and \r\nfind alternatives to the current socio-economic and \r\npolitical model, which has led to unjustified \r\ninterventions such as those in Iraq and Afghanistan, \r\nand to that now being committed against our region \r\nwith the establishment of military bases in Colombia \r\nunder the pretext of fighting drug trafficking. \r\n We cannot fail to be struck by the fact that, \r\ndespite the $7,558,000,000 invested, the flow of drugs \r\nout of Colombia continues to grow. In 1999, at the \r\nbeginning of Plan Colombia, the drug traffic to the \r\nUnited States and Europe was an annual 600 metric \r\ntons. Today, in 2009, that traffic has more than doubled \r\nto 1,450 metric tons. In other words, the strategy of \r\nmilitarizing Colombia has failed, absolute proof of \r\nwhich are the numbers I have cited. The true objective \r\nof installing these “seven daggers in the heart of \r\nAmerica”, as they are called by Commander Fidel \r\nCastro, is to salvage the moribund economic and \r\npolitical system with which capitalism flaunts its \r\npower by controlling the hemisphere’s water, oil and \r\nbiodiversity. \r\n We believe in the strengthening of energetic and \r\nprogressive positions in the defence of peace and \r\nrespect for the sovereignty of the countries of our \r\nregion. We are sure that it will ultimately serve to \r\nfurther advance the Latin American unity dreamt by \r\nBolívar, Morazán, Martí and Sandino. \r\n Mr. Sangqu (South Africa), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n Today, the solidarity practices of Fidel Castro and \r\nrevolutionary Cuba have grown and spread like never \r\nbefore. The wide world of Latin America has ceased to \r\nbe foreign, and as Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann said \r\nduring his particularly outstanding presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, the current scenario is not a tragedy \r\nbut a crisis. Crisis purifies. The pain we now feel is not \r\nthe death rattle of a dying man but the pain of a new \r\nbirth.  \r\n Finally, I wish to inform the General Assembly \r\nthat Nicaragua, respectful of international law, has \r\nabided by the ruling of the International Court of \r\nJustice in its decision of 13 July 2009, and has issued a \r\npresidential decree to regulate navigation in the San \r\nJuan River, over which Nicaragua has full, absolute \r\nand unquestionable sovereignty, as was recognized by \r\nthe ruling. \r\n I send greetings to all on behalf of our President, \r\nDaniel Ortega Saavedra, and of all Nicaraguans who \r\nsing in praise of Darío and who proudly carry on \r\nSandino’s legacy in order to defend ourselves today \r\nwith peace and dignity. Nicaragua is proud of its \r\ndevotion to peace, honour, solidarity and the relentless \r\nstruggle against injustice. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Jonas Gahr Støre, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Kingdom of Norway. \r\n Mr. Støre (Norway): In recent weeks, we have \r\nwitnessed a resurrection of the authority of this \r\nAssembly and a new commitment to multilateral \r\ncooperation and a belief that it can and must be made \r\nto work. The new tone of voice we have heard from the \r\nUnited States here in New York is setting forceful \r\npersuasion above persuasive force and extending a \r\nhand to those who are willing to unclench a fist.  \r\n We must all seize this moment. Every country — \r\nincluding the smallest and weakest — can make a \r\ndifference. Building bridges means that we must all \r\nreach out from where we stand today as we struggle \r\ntogether with the crises in finance, food, energy, \r\nclimate and health. New efforts must be undertaken to \r\nbreak cycles of impasse, including moving decisively \r\ntowards peace in the Middle East and a peace \r\nagreement that can deliver a Palestinian State living in \r\npeace side by side with Israel.  \r\n A/64/PV.13\r\n \r\n11 09-53165 \r\n \r\n Last month, the Secretary-General visited \r\nNorway’s Arctic to study the effects of global \r\nwarming. As we approach the Climate Change \r\nConference in Copenhagen, the pace of negotiations \r\nmust accelerate. Economy-wide reduction targets must \r\nbe set for all developed countries. Large and more \r\nadvanced developing countries should commit \r\nthemselves to measurable, reportable and verifiable \r\nactions. Cuts in emissions from rainforest preservation \r\nmust be institutionalized — as stipulated under the \r\nUnited Nations Collaborative Programme on Reducing \r\nEmissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation \r\nin Developing Countries — funded and included in the \r\nnew treaty. \r\n Financing is key to success in Copenhagen. Our \r\nNorwegian contributions and proposals may generate \r\nsubstantial new and additional financing for measures \r\nin developing countries, based on public finance and \r\ndedicated income from the carbon market. \r\n The financial crisis has pushed millions of people \r\nback into the trenches of poverty and made us stumble \r\nin our pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nLoss of income is placing public policies at perilous \r\nrisk, potentially undermining services on which the \r\npoorest and weakest depend the most, such as health \r\nand education services. Norway supports all the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. We will, for the \r\nsecond year in a row, surpass the 1-per cent mark in \r\nofficial development assistance (ODA). After the \r\nfinancial crisis hit us, we increased our ODA in \r\nabsolute terms to show solidarity with those who are \r\nless fortunate than we are. \r\n We focus our action on particular areas where \r\nNorway can make a difference. We will continue to \r\ntake on a special obligation with regard to the health-\r\nrelated Millennium Development Goals. We have \r\ntripled our contributions to health care since the year \r\n2000. Millions of lives have been saved through the \r\nefforts of a broad alliance of partners, private and \r\npublic alike. We will continue to play a leading role \r\nuntil we have achieved those Millennium Development \r\nGoals. \r\n The most disgraceful underachievement of the \r\neffort towards the Millennium Development Goals is \r\nthe lack of progress to improve maternal health. While \r\nwe can vaccinate children and give mothers a bed net \r\nunder a tree at a particular time, what women need are \r\nround-the-clock services in clinics to ensure safe \r\ndeliveries, as well as preparedness for transfer to a \r\nhospital in the event of complications. Strengthening \r\nhealth services is key to reducing maternal and child \r\nmortality and is also a vital element in guaranteeing the \r\nrights of women and children. New and dedicated \r\nefforts to combat maternal mortality will now be \r\nmobilized. \r\n The appalling rise of rape and other forms of \r\nsexual violence reveals an ugly story of men around \r\nthe world still regarding women and children as \r\nsecondary citizens. We must never rest as long as \r\nwomen are denied the services and rights that we men \r\ntake for granted. Nothing less than our claim to \r\ncivilization is at stake. \r\n Today, as we speak, the Security Council is \r\ndebating the situation in Afghanistan after the \r\nelections, as well as the need for a new Afghan \r\nGovernment to connect more strongly with its people, \r\nfight corruption and narcotics, empower State \r\ninstitutions and protect human rights, and in particular \r\nwomen’s rights, so that the day may soon come when \r\nAfghans can take care of Afghanistan’s security and \r\nwhen Afghan men and women can run a democratic \r\nAfghanistan. \r\n We must continue to support the United Nations \r\nAssistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), which \r\nhas a mandate to coordinate international assistance \r\nwith the Afghan Government. UNAMA requires \r\nadditional resources, as well as a strong commitment \r\non the part of all United Nations Member States to the \r\ncoordination of efforts under Afghan leadership. \r\n We stand on the threshold of a new era of nuclear \r\ndisarmament. The Review Conference of the Parties to \r\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons next year must set a clear and specific agenda \r\nfor the elimination of existing nuclear arsenals and for \r\nensuring that nuclear technologies are only applied \r\npeacefully, to the benefit of mankind. Recent \r\ninformation casts new doubt about Iran’s nuclear \r\nambitions. Iran itself has the opportunity and \r\nresponsibility to remove this doubt, and it is imperative \r\nthat it do so. \r\n Furthermore, while nuclear weapons pose a threat \r\nof mass destruction, actual destruction of mass \r\nproportions is caused every day by small arms, cluster \r\nmunitions and landmines. Motivated by the \r\nunacceptable harm that these weapons cause to \r\ncivilians, Norway is committed to humanitarian \r\nA/64/PV.13 \r\n \r\n09-53165 12 \r\n \r\ndisarmament. We urge all States to accede to the \r\nConvention on Cluster Munitions and to join \r\nintensifying efforts to control small arms and the arms \r\ntrade. \r\n Norway is honoured to have been elected a \r\nmember of the Human Rights Council and will work \r\nwith others to raise the credibility, effectiveness and \r\nvisibility of that important body. Last week, Norway \r\nsubmitted to the Council its first report on the human \r\nrights situation in my country, taking a critical look at \r\nour own record and inviting constructive criticism. We \r\nencourage all States to submit to similar constructive \r\ncriticism of their own records so that the review \r\nprocess becomes substantial and meaningful. \r\n Here in New York, we welcome the decision to \r\nestablish a new and enhanced gender entity and hope to \r\nsee it operational as soon as possible. We will pursue \r\nthe United Nations reform agenda and system-wide \r\ncoherence, as well as the Delivering as One agenda. \r\nThe United Nations should take pride in being subject \r\nto more public scrutiny; reform must be an ongoing \r\neffort. Only such an approach will allow us to keep \r\nlending the United Nations all the support this noble \r\nbody deserves. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Hassan Wirajuda, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Republic of Indonesia. \r\n Mr. Wirajuda (Indonesia): We meet today while \r\nthe world is in the grip of intertwined crises from \r\nwhich we must break free if we are to ensure our long-\r\nterm survival. The most urgent of these is the economic \r\nand financial crisis. It has put scores of millions out of \r\njobs, shut down tens of thousands of factories, and \r\npushed more than 100 million people below the \r\npoverty line. \r\n A few days ago, at the Group of Twenty (G-20) \r\nsummit in Pittsburgh, the 20 largest economies of the \r\nworld, both developed and developing, addressed this \r\ncrisis by agreeing to reform the global financial \r\narchitecture to meet the needs of the twenty-first \r\ncentury. No longer will we depend on just a few \r\nindustrialized nations to solve the world’s economic \r\nproblems. The developing world is now part of the \r\nsolution to those problems. Through the G-20, the \r\nvoice of the developing world will be heard in \r\ninternational economic and financial decision-making. \r\n Thus, we are building today a new and \r\nconstructive power equation, increasing the sharing of \r\nresponsibilities and contributions and widening \r\nparticipation in decision-making. This redistribution of \r\npower constitutes fundamental reform that should be \r\nreplicated in other bodies, such as the Security \r\nCouncil. And no more will our economies be left to the \r\nmercy of the market. Financial institutions and \r\ninstruments will have to be regulated and closely \r\nsupervised. There will be close consultations and \r\nmutual assessments of national economic strategies in \r\norder to ensure coordination at the global level and to \r\nidentify potential risks to financial stability. \r\n For our part in Indonesia we are working hard in \r\nthe G-20 to reform the mandate, mission and \r\ngovernance of the International Monetary Fund and our \r\nmultilateral development banks. These banks must \r\ndeliver accelerated and concessional financing without \r\nconditionalities to the low-income countries so as to \r\ncushion the impact of the crisis on the most vulnerable \r\nand the poorest. \r\n All of this has set refreshing precedents in terms \r\nof access to financial resources for developing \r\ncountries and in terms of transparency, and most \r\nimportantly, it reflects current global realities rather \r\nthan the world of 60 years ago. As such, it represents a \r\ndemocratization of the global economy and the \r\ninternational financial architecture. It has also given us \r\na remarkable insight: that it is not an array of disparate \r\ncrises that is confronting us. We are actually in the grip \r\nof one systemic crisis. The economic and financial \r\ncrisis, the challenge of climate change, the food \r\nsecurity crisis and the energy security crisis are \r\nproblems that fed on one another and thus grew to \r\ncritical proportions. That reality materialized because \r\nthe international community failed to form an effective \r\nglobal partnership to address the large bundle of \r\nchallenges that have ultimately affected all humankind. \r\n In that sense, the root cause of this overarching \r\ncrisis is the failure to achieve multilateralism and forge \r\na system of democratic governance at the global level. \r\nBut we can rectify that failure through an all-\r\nencompassing reform of the relationships between \r\nnations in the world today. \r\n In December in Copenhagen we can strive to \r\nreach a new consensus on climate change that is more \r\neffective in averting climate disaster by forging an \r\nequitable and transparent partnership between \r\n A/64/PV.13\r\n \r\n13 09-53165 \r\n \r\ndeveloped and developing nations. As the host country \r\nto the United Nations Climate Change Conference in \r\nBali, which adopted the Bali Road Map by consensus, \r\nIndonesia fervently desires that the Copenhagen \r\nmeeting will yield a new commitment to a framework \r\nto strengthen the Kyoto Protocol in 2012. This \r\nframework must stipulate deep cuts in greenhouse gas \r\nemissions and sufficient financing for adaptation to and \r\nmitigation of climate change. \r\n We would like to see the role of forests given the \r\ntop priority that it deserves. We look forward to ocean \r\nissues being mainstreamed into the new climate \r\nregime. And we cannot allow the negotiation process to \r\nbe derailed; the stakes are too high. We need not even \r\nwait for a consensus. We are ready to forge \r\npartnerships to carry out concrete projects like the \r\nIndonesia Forest Carbon Partnership Facility, which by \r\nitself is already a contribution to climate stability. In \r\nthe same spirit, Indonesia is hosting the Forest-2011 \r\nministerial meeting in Jakarta next month.  \r\n By the same token, we can launch a more \r\nsuccessful and durable Green Revolution that is based \r\non the same kind of partnership and gives developing \r\ncountries sorely needed access to resources and \r\ntechnology. That partnership can and must provide for \r\nthe massive investments required for agricultural \r\nproduction and building agricultural infrastructures. \r\nWhen sufficient investment is channelled to \r\nagriculture, the result is the productivity that Indonesia \r\nhas enjoyed in the past several years. We have a \r\nsurplus production of rice and part of that surplus will \r\nbecome a buffer stock for our national food security. \r\nPart of it will be allotted as our contribution to global \r\nfood security. \r\n Through similar reform we can involve more \r\nnations in a coordinated quest for new sources of \r\nrenewable and clean energy, without compromising \r\nfood security. A global partnership for energy security \r\nrather than a scattering of individual efforts will have a \r\nmuch better chance of achieving a technological \r\nbreakthrough that will enormously increase the \r\nefficiency of current fuel-burning mechanisms. \r\n With this new spirit of reform and \r\nmultilateralism, we will be able in 2010 to break the \r\nimpasse in the Doha Round negotiations, which will \r\nlead to an outcome that is pro-development. In that \r\nsame spirit we can tear down the barriers of \r\nprotectionism that are rising again out of fear of the \r\neconomic crisis. With trade revitalized, world gross \r\ndomestic product (GDP) could be bolstered by \r\n$700 billion a year. \r\n A global partnership that reforms the \r\ninternational financial architecture, works for climate \r\nstability, food security and energy security and brings a \r\nsuccessful conclusion to the Doha Development Round \r\nshould also bring about the fulfilment of the Monterrey \r\nConsensus. This will ensure the attainment of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. \r\n If this new spirit of multilateralism and reform can \r\npervade international socio-economic affairs, there is no \r\nreason why it should not also find its way into the \r\npolitico-security field. It can resuscitate the \r\ndisarmament agenda — especially nuclear disarmament, \r\nwhich has been lying moribund for decades. In a truly \r\ndemocratic world order, the nuclear Powers would fulfil \r\ntheir commitment to the Non-Proliferation Treaty by \r\nslashing their nuclear arsenals and abiding by the \r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. In turn, we \r\nnon-nuclear countries will continue to refrain from \r\ndeveloping nuclear weapons.  \r\n This is no longer an impossible dream. A window \r\nof opportunity has been opened with the adoption of \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1887 (2009) on the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security leading \r\nto a nuclear-weapon-free world, and with the current \r\nprocess between the United States and the Russian \r\nFederation towards deeper cuts in their respective \r\nnuclear arsenals. Thus, the disarmament agenda is \r\nbeing revived. \r\n Even the persistent Middle East conflict, with the \r\nquestion of Palestine at its core, could be more \r\nexpeditiously resolved, if the task of promoting the \r\npeace process involved a wider base of stakeholders. \r\nThe main problem in reviving the peace process at the \r\nmoment is the intransigence of Israel on the issue of \r\nillegal settlements. But the early engagement of the \r\nObama Administration in the peace effort and its even-\r\nhanded multilateral approach to the problem brings \r\nhope for an eventual two-State solution. \r\n Let us therefore respond to President Obama’s \r\ncall for partnering for peace. Likewise, the challenge of \r\nterrorism demands the broadest possible coalition of \r\nnations to put an end to it — not only through sheer \r\nforce of arms but also and mainly through a dialogue \r\nof faiths, cultures and civilizations that will put the \r\nmerchants of hate out of business. \r\nA/64/PV.13 \r\n \r\n09-53165 14 \r\n \r\n Every major problem in the world today calls for \r\nthe concerted efforts of many nations to work out its \r\nsolution. This includes transnational challenges like \r\npiracy, irregular migration, money-laundering, human \r\nrights violations, the threat of a pandemic and natural \r\ndisasters. All these problems demand reform and \r\nstrengthening of international cooperation. A clamour \r\nfor reform that must be heeded now is the call for the \r\noverhaul of the composition and workings of the \r\nSecurity Council. For by no means does the Council \r\nreflect the realities of our time — it is a throwback to \r\nthe world at the end of the Second World War. \r\n In the same way that the Group of Eight can no \r\nlonger solve the economic problems of the world, a \r\nSecurity Council paralysed by its undemocratic \r\ncomposition and the veto system can no longer \r\nguarantee our collective security. It needs to be more \r\ndemocratic, transparent and accountable. It needs new \r\nsources of strength that the developing world and their \r\nancient civilizations can help provide in the same \r\nmanner as the inclusivity of the G-20. \r\n We in Indonesia are great believers in democratic \r\nreform, because that is what saved us from being \r\ntotally crushed by the Asian financial crisis of 1997. \r\nOver the years until then, we had focused too much on \r\nthe market and on our GDP growth and thus neglected \r\nour political development. The only way out of the \r\ncrisis was reform — reform of every aspect of our \r\nnational life. And so we made the transition from a \r\nhighly centralized authoritarian regime to a \r\ndecentralized, more fully democratic system. We \r\nreformed our military, our bureaucracy and our justice \r\nsystem. We modernized our economic infrastructure. \r\n And since October 2004, the administration of \r\nPresident Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has been \r\nconsolidating and fine-tuning earlier reforms. Now, \r\nhaving won re-election in only the second direct \r\npresidential election in our history, he is ready to \r\nlaunch a second wave of reform, which will lay the \r\nfoundations for Indonesia’s becoming a developed \r\ncountry by 2025. Meanwhile, we have come to be \r\nknown as the world’s third largest democracy, the land \r\nwhere democracy, Islam and modernization not only go \r\nhand in hand but thrive together. We intend to keep on \r\nearning and deserving that recognition — by, among \r\nother ways, learning from others and sharing with them \r\nour experiences in political development. \r\n That is why, last December, we organized the \r\nBali Democracy Forum, Asia’s first intergovernmental \r\nforum on democracy. We are making this an annual \r\naffair. And it is our hope that the world, as it reforms \r\nits economic governance, will learn a truth that we \r\ncame upon during our crisis some 12 years ago: that \r\nprosperity without democracy is but a bubble. And \r\ndemocracy that does not deliver development will not \r\nendure. Economic and political development must \r\nmarch hand in hand. As it is with a country such as \r\nIndonesia, so it is with the world. It is not enough for \r\nthe world to get its economics right. It must also get its \r\npolitics right. For man does not live by bread alone. He \r\nmust also have his freedom. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Roble Olhaye, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of Djibouti. \r\n Mr. Olhaye (Djibouti): I would like to begin by \r\nextending my warmest congratulations to the President \r\non his election to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its current session. I also take this \r\nopportunity to place on record our sincere appreciation \r\nof Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann for his efforts \r\nand leadership during the sixty-third session. I wish as \r\nwell to commend the Secretary-General for his \r\ncomprehensive report on the work of the Organization \r\nand for his tireless efforts and dedication in the cause \r\nof international peace and security. \r\n The current financial and economic crisis \r\naffecting many countries around the globe, particularly \r\nin the West, has reached the shores of Africa. \r\nOriginating in the West, the uncontrolled banking and \r\nmortgage crisis, arising from over-leveraged subprime \r\nlending schemes, burst into the open, destroying the \r\nliquidity and survivability of many institutions in the \r\ndeveloped countries. \r\n It was thought that, since Africa was not a player \r\nin this sector, its financial institutions and its \r\neconomies would escape more or less unscathed. Such \r\nwas not to be; African difficulties have been \r\ncompounded. This crisis follows on the heels of the \r\nfood and energy crises and the challenges posed by the \r\nimpacts of climate change. The severity of the crisis on \r\npoor countries cannot be underestimated. Poor \r\ncountries have no choice but to work hard to restore \r\nstrong growth and recover lost ground in order to move \r\ntowards internationally agreed development goals. In \r\nthis respect, it must be emphasized that the global \r\n A/64/PV.13\r\n \r\n15 09-53165 \r\n \r\ncrisis cannot be an excuse to avoid fulfilling existing \r\ninternational aid commitments. In addition to timely \r\ndelivery, flexibility of resources and predictability, it is \r\ncritical that the aid be effective. Developing countries \r\nneed access to new funding, including credit and \r\nliquidity facilities, infrastructure investment and \r\nsupport for domestic financial systems. \r\n Members of the General Assembly are by now \r\naware of the tense standoff that prevails in the northern \r\npart of my country, following the unwarranted and \r\ndeliberately provocative incursion and occupation by \r\nEritrean forces of Djibouti’s sovereign territory at the \r\nbeginning of last year, 2008. This wholly reckless \r\naction by Eritrea, a neighbour, provoked a mutual \r\nmilitary build-up, leading to serious clashes between \r\nthe two forces. In particular, the clashes of 10 to \r\n12 June 2008 resulted in many deaths, countless \r\nwounded and prisoners taken on both sides, and this \r\nmerits a special note. \r\n My country embarked upon a calm and prudent \r\npolicy that deliberately allowed sufficient time for the \r\npossibility of comprehensive bilateral contacts at every \r\nlevel in order to resolve hostilities amicably and \r\npeacefully. Our efforts fell consistently on deaf ears, \r\naccompanied by rebuffs, blatant denials, and \r\ndismissive and condescending utterances. Regional \r\norganizations, heads of State and Government, and the \r\nUnited Nations have all attempted to initiate dialogue; \r\nthese efforts have gone for naught with Eritrea, which, \r\nin its usual brazen manner, has gone so far as to deny \r\neven the existence of any tension in the area, despite \r\nthe clear, far-reaching and unmistakable conclusions of \r\nthe United Nations fact-finding mission. Indeed, the \r\nmission’s report represents a damning indictment of the \r\nregime’s deceptive and erratic behaviour. \r\n The Security Council has consistently condemned \r\nEritrea’s forceful occupation of my country’s territory, \r\nnamely, Ras Doumeira and Doumeira Island, and in \r\nresolution 1862 (2009) of 14 January 2009, demanded, \r\ninter alia, that Eritrea withdraw its forces and all their \r\nmilitary hardware to the status quo ante; acknowledge \r\nits border dispute with Djibouti; engage actively in \r\ndialogue to defuse the tension and in diplomatic efforts \r\nleading to a mutually acceptable settlement; and to \r\nabide by its obligations as a Member of the United \r\nNations. \r\n The resolution required Eritrea to comply \r\nimmediately, and, in any case no later than five weeks \r\nafter the resolution’s adoption date of 14 January. \r\nEritrea, however, rejected the resolution the next day. \r\nThere the matter has essentially remained, in the light \r\nof the series of requests made by the Secretariat for \r\nmore time to pursue contacts, particularly with the \r\nEritrean authorities. As everyone now realizes, it is a \r\nfutile exercise to seek a credible response from Eritrea, \r\nwhose intentions have always been to procrastinate on \r\nvarious pretexts while firmly entrenching itself in the \r\noccupied territory. \r\n As Djibouti has repeatedly stated, the occupied \r\nareas of Ras Doumeira hill, which overlooks the \r\nBab-El-Mandeb strait, and Doumeira Island, which is \r\nin the same Red Sea area, are situated in one of the \r\nbusiest shipping lanes in the world. The militarization \r\nof this key strategic maritime route does not augur well \r\nfor peace in the region or for international shipping and \r\ninvestment. \r\n The dispute between Eritrea and Djibouti must \r\nnot be allowed to fester any longer. It must be resolved \r\nalong the lines of Security Council resolution 1862 \r\n(2009) without further equivocation, confusion or \r\ndeliberate procrastination. Inaction sets a dangerous \r\nprecedent that others will surely follow in the future: \r\ndeny and refuse to cooperate. The Council must not \r\nappear to be appeasing Eritrea indefinitely. It is a \r\ndangerous and an unpredictable regime that so far has \r\nnot shown any respect for international norms and \r\nbehaviour. The Council must act now, using all means \r\nat its disposal. \r\n Once again, the situation in Somalia is tense, \r\ntenuous and unpredictable. Somalia’s plight is \r\nsickening, hopeless and disgusting, to say the least. \r\nHere we have a transitional Government that enjoys the \r\nfull backing of the international community. Yet \r\nparadoxically, that same entity is woefully lacking the \r\nmoney and manpower that would enable it to confront \r\nthe deadly insurrection that has paralysed the whole \r\ncountry. Mogadishu, the capital, is essentially a war \r\nzone. Most of its civilian population has been \r\ndisplaced, having fled the never-ending anarchy, \r\nabuses, impunity and other egregious crimes against \r\nhumanity. The collateral damage to the civilian \r\npopulation is horrendous — in short, unquantifiable. \r\nCoupled with that, the Somali people are facing an \r\nextreme drought that threatens a widespread food \r\nshortage and starvation, which would necessitate major \r\ninternational emergency food aid. \r\nA/64/PV.13 \r\n \r\n09-53165 16 \r\n \r\n The presence of African Union peacekeepers has \r\nbeen a major factor in keeping the transitional \r\nGovernment in power, but they are continuously under \r\nattack, and the need for more troops, as well as for the \r\ntraining and equipping of sufficient Somali forces, \r\ncannot be overemphasized. Indeed, there is tremendous \r\ngoodwill towards the current Transitional Federal \r\nGovernment, in particular towards Sheikh Sharif \r\nSheikh Ahmed, the current President, who enjoys both \r\ntrust and international credibility. Unfortunately, that \r\nhas not been matched by a commensurate support in \r\nterms of resource flows consistent with the promises \r\nand pledges made to the Government. Resources make \r\nthe difference in the outcome of hostilities.  \r\n All the same, life in Somalia goes on, and with \r\nresources that country would be able to start addressing \r\nthe critical urgent problems and issues of security, \r\ngovernance and job creation. Addressing the terrible \r\ndrought now battering the country and crippling its \r\nalready low food stock is a top priority. We must all \r\nfulfil our obligations to enable the Government to \r\nfunction. No doubt that is a tall order, but that is what \r\nit takes and that is the challenge that we all have to \r\nconfront.  \r\n We are well aware of the flow of arms, resources \r\nand foreign fighters into Somalia and of the threat that \r\nAl-Qaida might establish a beachhead there. One can \r\nsay that the time has come for all well-meaning \r\nSomalis, as well as peoples and Governments of \r\ngoodwill everywhere, to step forward in order to create \r\na lasting and stable environment for the people of \r\nSomalia. We owe that to the people of Somalia. \r\n The stage appears set for dramatic developments \r\nin the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories, \r\nwhich is by far the longest occupation in modern times. \r\nAs we all know, the United Nations Fact-Finding \r\nMission investigating last winter’s three-week war in \r\nGaza has issued its report. While both the Israelis and \r\nthe Palestinians were strongly criticized, the \r\ncondemnation of Israel by a United Nations body was \r\nunprecedented, stating that the result was \r\n “a deliberately disproportionate attack designed \r\nto punish, humiliate and terrorize a civilian \r\npopulation, radically diminish its local economic \r\ncapacity both to work and provide for itself, and \r\nto force upon it an ever increasing sense of \r\ndependency and vulnerability”. (A/HRC/12/48, \r\npara. 1893) \r\n The peace process is frozen and there is no hope \r\nin sight of jump-starting it soon, as the new Israeli \r\nGovernment is intent on pursuing its business-as-usual \r\npolicy of more settlements and refusal to engage in a \r\nprocess that addresses the final status issues. \r\n My country is keen to have peace and security \r\nsoon restored in the northern part of the sisterly nation \r\nof Yemen, within the framework of its territorial \r\nintegrity, sovereignty and unity. \r\n One cannot fail to notice the number of countries \r\nthat have raised the issue of the representation on and \r\ncomposition of the Security Council. It is undeniable \r\nthat we are in a different world from that which existed \r\nin the aftermath of the Second World War. Given the \r\ncritical need to have a global body capable of \r\naddressing, in some manner, the challenges of an \r\nevolving international landscape, the issue is of \r\nconcern to many countries. For the United Nations to \r\nretain its credibility and authority, it must continue to \r\nbe relevant. New norms have risen, while whole \r\ncontinents lack permanent representation, let alone the \r\npower of the veto. \r\n Once again, it must be said that Africa, the \r\ncontinent with the largest number of countries, needs to \r\nhave a permanent voice in the conduct of world affairs. \r\nWe see no reason to change our position, which we \r\nnoted in 2007, that Africa seeks no fewer than two \r\npermanent seats, with all the prerogatives and \r\nprivileges of a permanent member, including the right \r\nof the veto, in addition to five non-permanent seats. Of \r\nlate, things have been changing for the better in much \r\nof Africa, but the current disastrous international \r\neconomic crisis was not of our making, as is true for \r\nthe fallout from global warming. They and other crises \r\nunderscore the urgency of our meaningful involvement \r\nin the United Nations and in world affairs. Permanent \r\nseats and increased membership on the Security \r\nCouncil would be in keeping with those growing \r\ninternational demands. \r\n Time and space do not allow us to consider in any \r\ndepth a number of other critical issues confronting \r\ndeveloping countries. There should be some mention, \r\nhowever, of the harm to countries’ trade and \r\ndevelopment stemming from the protective tariffs of \r\nthe industrialized West. The effort to provide subsidies \r\nfor a few large farming operations, blocking \r\ncompetition from farmers of the developing world, \r\nonly hurts the latter. Perhaps cotton is a good example. \r\n A/64/PV.13\r\n \r\n17 09-53165 \r\n \r\n There is also the stalemate in the Doha Round \r\ntrade talks. Those discussions must reopen in earnest, \r\nwith the commitment to reach a satisfactory \r\nconclusion. Lastly, we need to highlight the concern \r\nregarding the Millennium Development Goals and the \r\nlikelihood that they will not be achieved by 2015 in \r\nmost countries. In sum, that is tragic for so many lives. \r\nEfforts must therefore increase towards mitigating that \r\ntrend. \r\n In conclusion, I wish, on behalf of my \r\nGovernment and the people of Djibouti, to express our \r\nheartfelt sorrow and profound condolences to the \r\nbereaved families and to the Government and the \r\npeople of the Philippines for the torrential rains and \r\nheavy flooding that caused havoc and unprecedented \r\ndisruption of lives and destroyed infrastructure. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Antonio Pedro Monteiro Lima, \r\nchairman of the delegation of the Republic of Cape \r\nVerde. \r\n Mr. Lima (Cape Verde) (spoke in French): \r\nBefore beginning my statement, I would like to \r\nmention something that happened on our continent, in \r\nWest Africa, yesterday. Indeed, tragic events occurred \r\nyesterday in a country in West Africa, of which Cape \r\nVerde is a part: soldiers once again fired on a crowd. \r\nAs a neighbouring, friendly and long-standing partner \r\ncountry of Guinea, I wish, on behalf of my country, to \r\nexpress my deep sympathy and the unequivocal \r\ncondemnation of an act that disgraces the entire \r\ncontinent. I am referring to a challenge to the brave \r\npeople of Guinea and to the international community. I \r\npay tribute to the numerous victims of this odious act, \r\nwhich threatens stability and peace in the entire \r\nsubregion. \r\n(spoke in Portuguese; French text provided by the \r\ndelegation) \r\n I am pleased to congratulate Ambassador Ali \r\nAbdussalam Treki on his election to the presidency of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. I also \r\ncongratulate his predecessor, Father Miguel d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann, for his involvement, dedication and \r\ncourage, which left an important imprint on the work \r\nof the sixty-third session. To Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon, Cape Verde expresses its confidence that he \r\nwill continue to further our aspirations and consolidate \r\nthe foundations of this Organization he leads that is \r\ndedicated to the common good. We thank him for his \r\ndetailed report on the work of the Organization \r\n(A/64/1).  \r\n Peace, security and development are public assets \r\nthat are essential to the progress of humanity. However, \r\nthey have never before been as threatened as they are \r\ntoday. Therefore, I would like to share with the \r\nAssembly some of my country’s concerns in that \r\ncontext.  \r\n During the Assembly’s sixty-second session, the \r\nPrime Minister of Cape Verde, Mr. José Maria Neves, \r\nsaid: \r\n  “We are living at a time when problems and \r\nthreats are of concern to all. They are not \r\nconfined to a single State or region. Nor can there \r\nbe local solutions to the global threats of our \r\nera.” (A/62/PV.11, p. 2) \r\nHe was referring to terrorism, organized crime and \r\nhuman trafficking and to weapons and drugs that in \r\ncertain instances threaten the foundations of the \r\ndemocratic rule of law. He said that these phenomena \r\n“corrupt values, compromise development and thwart \r\nthe most legitimate expectations of peoples” who are \r\nexposed to them and that “Responses to these issues \r\nwill be ineffective unless they are undertaken within a \r\nrobust, balanced and fair multilateral perspective” \r\n(ibid.). \r\n I quote these remarks by the head of Government \r\nof Cape Verde because they are quite current and \r\nbecause the themes they address have been the object \r\nof increasing attention by the international community. \r\n Cape Verde and other West African States are \r\nfacing organized crime, which has found fertile ground \r\nfor its activities in our region because of our fragile \r\neconomies, the vulnerability of our emerging \r\ndemocracies and, in general, our States’ weak \r\ncapacities to respond to this major threat. With the \r\nsupport of the United Nations, in particular the United \r\nNations Office on Drugs and Crime and the logistics \r\ncapabilities of our partners, we, the States members of \r\nthe Economic Community of West African States are \r\npooling our capabilities to confront this tremendous \r\nchallenge that has engulfed our subregion.  \r\n In Cape Verde we believe that a small country \r\ncannot allow itself to be poor, vulnerable and unstable \r\nall at once. We therefore seek to reinforce our \r\nadvantages, reduce our weaknesses and diversify our \r\npartnerships, in addition to strengthening our relations \r\nA/64/PV.13 \r\n \r\n09-53165 18 \r\n \r\nof solidarity for the benefit of peace, stability and \r\nprogress in our subregion. \r\n Therefore, at the October 2008 conference on \r\ndrug trafficking in our region and at the April 2009 \r\nround table on Guinea-Bissau security sector reform, \r\nboth held in Praia, the capital of Cape Verde, we \r\nsought to define together the parameters of our actions \r\nin these areas. We will continue to pay special attention \r\nto this threat, as we are convinced that the zone of \r\npeace we are building in the South Atlantic must \r\nbecome a tangible reality if we wish to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and, in general, the \r\nlife of peace and progress that we wish for all. \r\n In this context in which States and democratic \r\nprocesses are threatened by exogenous elements, \r\nmultilateralism appears as an indispensable shield and \r\nan essential resource. There is no doubt that this \r\nconfluence of wills and means among the most diverse \r\ncountries and the most widespread regions at the heart \r\nof the international community constitutes the path to \r\nfollow, not only for strengthening cooperation among \r\nthe entities of international life and for the timely \r\nresolution of differences in the framework of the \r\nprinciples and values of the United Nations, but also \r\nfor the strengthening of international law, which is \r\nindispensable for strengthening peace and security in \r\nthe world.  \r\n The United Nations, in this context, remains the \r\ncentral element of the collective conscience of the \r\ncommunity of nations. Thus the revitalization of the \r\nUnited Nations system emerges as a necessity of our \r\ntime, giving priority to the participation of all, to the \r\ndetriment of unilateralism, strengthening efficiency for \r\nthe benefit of common interests and seeking solutions \r\nthat meet the aspirations of the most vulnerable and of \r\npresent and future generations. \r\n Cape Verde is contributing to that framework as \r\none of the eight pilot countries testing the Delivering \r\nas One process on the ground, which is successfully \r\nunder way as a unique programme with a unique \r\nbudgeting plan, a single purpose and single leader. This \r\nprocess has had positive repercussions on cooperation \r\nbetween the Government and the agencies, funds and \r\nprogrammes of the United Nations working in Cape \r\nVerde, thus enhancing the coherence of this \r\nprogramme, reducing transaction and administrative \r\ncosts and benefiting all. \r\n According to the United Nations Conference on \r\nTrade and Development, it is expected that the global \r\ngross domestic product will shrink by more than \r\n2.5 per cent in 2009. The growth of developing \r\ncountries will decrease from 5.4 per cent in 2008 to 1.3 \r\nper cent in 2009, which means a reduction in the \r\naverage per capita income. In light of the stagnation \r\nand reduction of economic growth, the developing \r\ncountries have seen an increase in poverty, \r\nunemployment, the cost of essential goods and \r\nmalnutrition. With the drastic reduction in investment, \r\nthere is a strong likelihood that the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals will not be achieved. \r\n It is expected that in 2009 world trade will be \r\nreduced by at least 11 per cent in real terms and by \r\n20 per cent in dollar terms. For the African continent, \r\nthe prognosis points to a significant deceleration of the \r\ngrowth of production in 2009. However, it will remain \r\npositive and drop to 3 per cent in North Africa and \r\n1 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa. The medium- and \r\nlow-income countries in this context will certainly \r\nrequire more support in the form of a coordinated \r\neffort at the international level to increase official \r\ndevelopment assistance.  \r\n The perspective of a solution to the crisis is \r\nsignificant. It requires, among other things, a new \r\npolitical strategy that includes regulation of the \r\nfinancial market. The recent meeting of the Group of \r\n20 in Pittsburgh offers some elements of response. \r\nIndeed, management of the crisis in the context of \r\nglobalization and interdependence requires an \r\nintegrated response of the parties as well as a change in \r\nthe global financial system, more efficient institutions, \r\ncountercyclical policies, better monitoring of risk and \r\ninstitutional regulation. The outcome document \r\nadopted by consensus at the United Nations \r\nConference on the World Financial and Economic \r\nCrisis of 24 to 26 June 2009 (resolution 63/303, annex) \r\ncontains recommendations to fight economic recession \r\nand establishes viable and safe financial practices, in \r\naddition to indicating important areas of intervention.  \r\n Cape Verde, despite the difficult situation created \r\nby the economic and financial crisis, seeks to preserve \r\nthe gains already made in the various areas of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, thanks to a prudent \r\nand pragmatic policy and taking its partners into \r\naccount to help diminish the impact of the crisis on the \r\narchipelago. \r\n A/64/PV.13\r\n \r\n19 09-53165 \r\n \r\n We think all international partners must \r\nimplement joint efforts to minimize the impact of the \r\neconomic deceleration, especially for developing \r\ncountries, and enable all to achieve more inclusive, \r\nequitable and balanced development, oriented towards \r\neconomic sustainability, to help overcome poverty and \r\ninequity in order to avoid an unprecedented human \r\ncrisis. \r\n The Summit on Climate Change organized by the \r\nSecretary-General last week was an undeniable \r\nsuccess. The Member States wished to participate in \r\nlarge numbers to reaffirm their determination to see \r\nthis vital problem treated in a convincing, urgent and \r\ngenuine manner. The head of State of one of the heavy-\r\nemitting countries declared that if we do not act now, \r\nno one will ever be able to do so, reinforcing what \r\nscientists have been demonstrating for some time: that \r\nour planet is at serious risk of not being able to assure \r\nlife in all its fullness because of the consequences of \r\nclimate change. And the time to act is now. \r\n The participants departed the Summit convinced \r\nthat there is no more time for evasion. The moment has \r\ncome for concerted, coherent and systematic action to \r\nachieve a convincing and meaningful reduction of \r\ngreenhouse gases, to slow global warming and avoid \r\nraised sea levels likely to endanger vast coastal regions \r\nthroughout the world, particularly the small developing \r\nisland States. Such States are increasingly vulnerable \r\nand suffer the most from the consequences of a \r\nsituation created to a large extent by emitter States. At \r\nits summit here in New York on 21 September, the \r\nAlliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), of which \r\nCape Verde is a member, adopted a declaration \r\nclarifying its position on various points being \r\nnegotiated within the framework of the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change. \r\n Cape Verde is a small archipelago with a small \r\npopulation, in a geographic location that leaves it \r\nsimultaneously isolated in the ocean and dangerously \r\nexposed to the effects of climate change and global \r\nwarming. As a Sahelian State, it has long faced \r\ndrought, desertification and a serious lack of water. \r\nThose phenomena aggravate the population’s poverty, \r\nhinder Government efforts and strongly affect actions \r\nin the areas of environmental preservation and human \r\ndevelopment. \r\n In Cape Verde we are making efforts to make the \r\nbest possible use of our river basins, saving water \r\nwherever possible and adopting modern irrigation \r\nmethods with the help of new technologies. We are \r\nimplementing an active policy in that area. A dam on \r\none of our islands is energizing the local agricultural \r\nsector and allowing us to promote better subsistence \r\nmethods among farmers, while helping us develop \r\nrenewable power sources throughout the country with \r\nthe goal of providing electricity to 95 per cent of the \r\ncountry by 2011. A research and development centre \r\nfor renewable energies aimed at serving the entire West \r\nAfrican region is under construction in Cape Verde. \r\n The international community, and the developed \r\ncountries in particular, must strive to support the \r\nspecific dynamics of those States in the areas of \r\nadaptation to and mitigation of the effects of climate \r\nchange and to enable them to minimize the risks that \r\nburden them today, given that some of those States are \r\nalready facing issues of mass dislocation and forced \r\nmigrations. \r\n For the people of Cape Verde, the ocean is more \r\nthan a nurturing mother or a demanding lover — it is \r\nour vital source of civilization and inspiration. We \r\nwant to protect it; we want to preserve it. But equally, \r\nalong with the coastal nations of the Atlantic Ocean, \r\nparticularly in its southern half, we want to see it be an \r\narea of exchange, not speculation, a realm of active \r\nsolidarity, not unruly competition. Far from making it \r\none more focus of human greed, let us preserve its \r\nunique value as a precious cradle of life and the \r\nrepository of the hopes of our planet. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Camillo Gonsalves, chairman of \r\nthe delegation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. \r\n Mr. Gonsalves (Saint Vincent and the \r\nGrenadines): At the outset, the Government and people \r\nof Saint Vincent and the Grenadines take this \r\nopportunity to extend deepest condolences to the \r\npeople of the Philippines and the Socialist Republic of \r\nViet Nam for the lives tragically lost in the wake of \r\ntropical storm Ketsana. Our thoughts, prayers and \r\nsolidarity are with them as they grapple with that \r\ncatastrophe. \r\n It is with great pleasure that we welcome \r\nMr. Treki to the leadership of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-fourth session. His experience and abilities are \r\nwell known and respected, and he has our full support \r\nin the coming year. Indeed, we in Saint Vincent and the \r\nGrenadines are particularly pleased that the presidency \r\nA/64/PV.13 \r\n \r\n09-53165 20 \r\n \r\nhas moved from Nicaragua, a country touched by the \r\nCaribbean Sea, to a continent that is the ancestral home \r\nof the vast majority of our citizens. We have, in \r\nessence, kept the presidency within our extended \r\nfamily. We trust that he will continue the exemplary \r\nwork of his predecessor, Father Miguel d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann, who fearlessly and tirelessly championed \r\nthe role of the “G-192” in addressing global \r\nchallenges. \r\n We face many challenges within our international \r\ncommunity, but at their most basic, the majority are \r\nsymptomatic of a single underlying issue: a struggle by \r\nthe powerful to cling to their dominion long after the \r\nlegitimate bases of their power have faded. We find \r\nourselves in a world governed by outdated norms and \r\nassumptions, and our failure to adapt has wrought \r\ndisastrous consequences on our peoples. \r\n In his welcome and inspiring maiden statement to \r\nthe General Assembly last Wednesday, our esteemed \r\nbrother and friend President Barack Obama of the \r\nUnited States correctly identified the challenges to our \r\nmultilateral unity as “rooted in a discontent with the \r\nstatus quo” (see A/64/PV.3). We wholeheartedly agree \r\nand endorse that assessment.  \r\n It is a discontent with the status quo of a 63-year-\r\nold Security Council, which continues to administer \r\nour collective security unchanged and impervious to \r\nthe logic of a new world. It is a discontent with the \r\nrole, effectiveness and mandate of the 65-year-old \r\nBretton Woods institutions, which were created in a \r\nbygone era to address bygone circumstances. It is a \r\ndiscontent with a 49-year-old blockade on the noble \r\npeople of our neighbour Cuba, the continued illegal \r\napplication of which is illogical when viewed through \r\nthe prism of geopolitics, economics or \r\nhumanitarianism, and can be successfully explained \r\nonly by reference to narrow local political \r\nconsiderations.  \r\n It is a discontent, even, with the stagnation of \r\nefforts to change the status quo in other critical \r\nrespects: the eight years of unresolved negotiations of \r\nthe Doha Development Round, the 12 years of the \r\ntoothless commitments of the Kyoto Protocol, and the \r\nseven years of unfulfilled Monterrey Consensus \r\npromises to achieve a 0.7 per cent of gross national \r\nproduct for official development assistance, a full 40 \r\nyears after this modest percentage was first mooted. \r\n Through it all, the geopolitical status quo \r\nremains. The structural bases of international \r\ninteraction are distressingly similar to their decades-\r\nold antecedents. Those structures were forged in the \r\nfires of World War II, hardened in the frost of the Cold \r\nWar and entrenched by the legacies of colonialism and \r\nexploitation. But World War II has long since ended, \r\nthe Cold War is relegated to history books, and the \r\nreach of formal colonialism continues to recede. The \r\nstructures spawned by those historical episodes are no \r\nlonger valid. \r\n Our discontent is born not only of stagnation but \r\nalso of exclusion. Although we have a seat in this \r\nhallowed building, it is often the seat of a spectator in a \r\nhistorical drama. The directors and actors script history \r\nnot in the General Assembly, but in other rooms and \r\nlocales, without our input or knowledge. In many \r\nsignificant ways we are attendees, rather than \r\nparticipants, on the international stage. \r\n We are in the midst of a global financial and \r\neconomic crisis of unparalleled depth and scope. Saint \r\nVincent and the Grenadines played no part in the \r\nreckless speculation and corruption that precipitated \r\nthis crisis, yet the people of our country are hard hit by \r\nits effects. Our tourism industry is suffering, \r\nremittances are shrinking, foreign direct investment is \r\nscarce, and the spectre of unemployment is a real and \r\ngathering regional threat. However, we are actively \r\nexcluded from the solutions to this problem.  \r\n Last week, we learned that the Group of 20 \r\n(G-20) anointed itself “the premier forum for our \r\ninternational economic cooperation”. Saint Vincent and \r\nthe Grenadines is not a member of the G-20, nor were \r\nwe consulted on its ascension to the ranks of arbiters of \r\nour economic fate. While there is an undeniable logic \r\nto a small group of the world’s largest economies \r\nmeeting informally to thrash out matters that affect \r\nonly their own large economies, the logic fades in the \r\nface of a crisis that has spread rapidly and \r\ncomprehensively to every corner of the globe. \r\n Additionally, the G-20 faces a serious legitimacy \r\nproblem. Aside from the Group’s being non-inclusive \r\nand unofficial, many of the countries at that table \r\nrepresent the champions of the financial and economic \r\northodoxies that led the world down the rabbit hole to \r\nits current economic malaise. \r\n Further, the G-20’s recent self-congratulatory \r\npronouncements of “mission accomplished” in the \r\n A/64/PV.13\r\n \r\n21 09-53165 \r\n \r\nmidst of this economic upheaval are of cold comfort to \r\nthe suffering peoples and countries of the world. While \r\nthe G-20 may claim that its actions have “worked”, and \r\nclaim a “sense of normalcy”, the people of Saint \r\nVincent and the Grenadines and our Caribbean region \r\nare under no such illusions. The invisible hand of the \r\nmarket is still clasped firmly around the throats of poor \r\npeople and the developing countries of the world. We \r\nsee none of the so-called green shoots that populate the \r\nfantasies of discredited economic cheerleaders. \r\n Indeed, the seeds sown by this crisis may produce \r\nthe strange and bitter fruit of increased poverty, \r\nsuffering and social and political upheaval. The crisis \r\nitself, with its disproportionate impact on the poor, will \r\nonly widen and deepen the yawning gap between \r\ndeveloped and developing countries. \r\n It is not merely the economic crisis against which \r\nthe people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines \r\ncontinue to struggle heroically. Today, we face the \r\ntriple threat of being globalized, climatized and \r\nstigmatized. We have already been globalized by the \r\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) out of our trade in \r\nbananas, which, until very recently, was the engine of \r\nour economic growth. We are on the verge of being \r\nclimatized out of our reliance on tourism as its \r\ndevelopment substitute, as climate change wreaks \r\nhavoc on our weather systems, intensifies our \r\nhurricanes, destroys our coral reefs, damages our costal \r\ninfrastructure and erodes our beaches. \r\n Now, we face being stigmatized out of our \r\ntransition into financial services, as the G-20, the \r\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and \r\nDevelopment and other non-inclusive bodies seek to \r\nscapegoat and root out so-called tax havens in a \r\npathetic effort to cast a wide and indiscriminate net of \r\nblame across a swath of legitimate and well-regulated \r\ncountries’ development efforts. \r\n We note the irony of hearing these paternalistic \r\nprescriptions from the same countries that are unable to \r\nstem corruption and mismanagement within their own \r\nborders, where corporations recklessly squander \r\ntrillions of dollars and a single buccaneer investor can \r\nmake $50 billion — an amount greater than the \r\ncombined annual budget expenditures of the entire \r\nCaribbean Community subregion — disappear into thin \r\nair. \r\n The unholy trinity of exogenous assaults on our \r\ndevelopment prospects posed by globalization, \r\nclimatization and stigmatization cannot be ignored, nor \r\ncan the security threats engendered by the illicit trade \r\nin firearms and narcotics. We in Saint Vincent and the \r\nGrenadines find ourselves unfortunately located \r\nbetween the supply of and demand for these poisons \r\nand weapons, and their deleterious effects rip holes in \r\nour cohesive social fabric. The Caribbean, which \r\nproduces not one single firearm or one single kilo of \r\ncocaine, is awash in drugs and guns, and is now the \r\nsubregion with the world’s highest per capita murder \r\nrate. \r\n Our plight cannot be ignored. Indeed, we are \r\nheartened that the United Nations Office on Drugs and \r\nCrime, which inexplicably ended its presence in our \r\nregion, has now seen fit to reconsider its decision to \r\ncede the Caribbean to drug cartels and murderers. We \r\nhope that it represents a genuine and generous \r\nrecommitment to our regional challenges. \r\n As a small archipelagic State, we, more than \r\nmost, are affected and threatened by the ravages of \r\nclimate change. We, more than most, recognize the \r\ncritical importance of a meaningful, measurable and \r\nenforceable global compact on climate change. \r\nHowever, we do not simply want to “seal the deal” at \r\nCopenhagen, as posited by the sloganeers of the United \r\nNations. We want to seal the right deal, the just deal, \r\nand the deal that ensures our continued survival. We \r\nmost emphatically will not seal a suicide pact that will \r\nassure the elimination of small island States and our \r\nway of life. \r\n The Alliance of Small Island States has recently \r\nissued a declaration that contains what we consider to \r\nbe the essential contours of any meaningful agreement \r\non climate change. We trust that our blameless position \r\non the front lines of climate change fallout will be \r\nconsidered and respected in the global effort to seal the \r\ndeal. We cannot, as in the case of the world economy, \r\nbe excluded in any way from the solutions to a problem \r\nthat so fundamentally affects us. \r\n The theme of exclusion is equally applicable to \r\nour friends in Taiwan. The United Nations and its \r\nspecialized agencies must find ways to ensure the \r\nmeaningful participation of the 23 million people of \r\nTaiwan. Just as their economic strength has merited \r\ninclusion in the WTO and the universality of global \r\nhealth challenges have logically compelled their \r\nparticipation in the World Health Assembly, so too \r\nshould the global reach of climate change merit their \r\nA/64/PV.13 \r\n \r\n09-53165 22 \r\n \r\nmeaningful participation in the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change. \r\n The interconnected networks of global air travel \r\nand our shared safety concerns similarly mandate the \r\nparticipation of Taiwan in the International Civil \r\nAviation Organization. The Government and people of \r\nTaiwan have advanced a reasonable and responsible \r\npolicy of engagement to usher a new era in cross-strait \r\nrelations. The international community can and should \r\nencourage and reward this fledgling rapprochement \r\nwith meaningful participation in the relevant \r\nspecialized agencies. \r\n Any cursory analysis of the excluded and the \r\nincluded, of the discontented and the defenders of the \r\nstatus quo, will quickly reveal that many current \r\ninequities are rooted in our colonial history and that the \r\nstruggle for geopolitical balance and inclusiveness is \r\nindeed the last struggle of decolonization as we, the \r\nformer colonial territories, remain excluded from the \r\ninner sanctums and power structures that were \r\nestablished by and for the colonizers in a time long \r\nsince passed. \r\n On 27 October this year, Saint Vincent and the \r\nGrenadines will celebrate its thirtieth anniversary of \r\nindependence. However, we recognize that \r\nindependence is a process, not a one-time event. Our \r\nindependence journey continues today. Thirty years \r\nafter gaining formal independence, we retain the Queen \r\nas our Head of State, and our highest judicial appeals \r\ntravel from our shores to the United Kingdom to be \r\ndecided by Her Majesty in Council. While we cherish a \r\nspecial, modern and respectful relationship with the \r\nUnited Kingdom, we do not intend to tarry on colonial \r\npremises a moment longer than is necessary. \r\n Even as we wage a wider war of attrition against \r\ngeopolitical colonialism, our citizens are preparing to \r\nvote on a new and home-grown constitution that will \r\nbreak the chains of outmoded dependence and place \r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines firmly on its two feet \r\nas a truly independent republic. This new proposed \r\nconstitution, the product of six years of open, \r\ntransparent and inclusive public consultations, is \r\ntestament to the political maturity of our people and to \r\nthe value of locally tailored solutions to externally \r\nimposed impediments. \r\n In a similar manner, our brothers and sisters in \r\nthe developing world, including Cuba, the Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela, Turkey, Mexico, Malaysia, \r\nIran, Libya, Brazil and many others, have forged new \r\nlinks and bonds of friendship, cooperation and \r\nsolidarity with our country that go beyond historical, \r\ngeographical or colonial linkages. We value these \r\nfriendships and partnerships as important additions to \r\nour traditional and treasured allies in the United States, \r\nthe United Kingdom, Taiwan, Canada and the \r\nEuropean Union. \r\n Just as our myriad bilateral friendships and \r\npartnerships span geographic, economic and \r\nideological divides, so too must our multilateral \r\ncooperation be inclusive and participatory. We can no \r\nlonger maintain the illusion of holding hands in \r\nartificial solidarity across the moats and turrets of \r\nstructural and systemic inequalities. Modern \r\nmultilateralism cannot proceed on the bases of the \r\nincluded and the excluded, of the political haves and \r\nhave-nots, nor can token assimilations of individual \r\ndeveloping countries serve to mask the necessity for \r\ndeep structural changes to existing power \r\narrangements.  \r\n We urge our brothers and sisters who have gained \r\nlimited access to the halls of power to not only be a \r\nvoice for their excluded brothers and to not only \r\nremember where they came from, but also to view \r\nthemselves as the tip of the spear, the thin edge of the \r\nwedge that will use their newfound privileges to \r\ndismantle these structures from within, even as we \r\ncontinue to make our presence felt outside the citadels \r\nof stasis and indifference. \r\n Psalm 118 of the Bible teaches that the stone that \r\nthe builder rejected shall become the cornerstone. We, \r\nthe poor and developing countries of the world, are the \r\nstones that the builders of this body refused and \r\nignored. In rebuilding and revitalizing, either we will \r\nbecome the cornerstones of this institution, or this \r\nedifice of multilateral cooperation will crumble into \r\nirrelevance and illegitimacy. \r\n Addressing the economic crisis, poverty and \r\ndevelopment is not an academic exercise. Climate \r\nchange is not a theoretical event. Reform of global \r\ngovernance is not a diplomatic parlour game. They are \r\nthe clear and present dangers of our time, and they \r\nreflect the need for the real and inclusive participation \r\nof Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, the Caribbean and \r\nthe developing world. They represent also a need to \r\nreflect and address our discontent with the status quo \r\nperpetuated for far too long. \r\n A/64/PV.13\r\n \r\n23 09-53165 \r\n \r\n We stand now in the autumn of our discontent, \r\nbut, as Gandhi said, “Healthy discontent is the prelude \r\nto progress”. The challenge of the discontented is to \r\nrise above ancient animosities and artificial \r\nbalkanization to achieve the clarity of vision, unity of \r\npurpose and political will to finally and successfully \r\nstorm the castles of stagnation and status quo and to \r\ndrive our peoples, our politics and our planet into a \r\nnew era of genuine inclusiveness, equity and \r\nmeaningful, people-centred progress. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Alexandru Cujba, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of the Republic of Moldova. \r\n Mr. Cujba (Moldova): I am deeply honoured to \r\naddress the General Assembly on behalf of the \r\nRepublic of Moldova. At the outset, I would like to \r\ncongratulate His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki \r\non his election to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-fourth session, to wish him \r\nsuccess and to assure his Bureau of the full support of \r\nour delegation. I would also like to pay tribute to the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his high \r\ncompetence and professionalism, and his tireless \r\nefforts in leading the United Nations in these complex \r\ntimes. \r\n The distinguished speakers who have taken the \r\nfloor in this debate have elaborated extensively on the \r\nmost pressing issues that the international community \r\nhas faced over the past year. The current financial and \r\neconomic crisis, the food and energy crises, the first flu \r\npandemic of this century, and climate change have \r\nbeen at the core of deliberations in the United Nations, \r\nrevealing the central role of the Organization in dealing \r\nwith these problems. A reformed, robust and effective \r\nOrganization has to deliver prompt reactions and \r\nsustainable responses to the major challenges to peace, \r\nsecurity and development: disarmament and \r\nnon-proliferation, climate change, food and energy \r\nsecurity, and the spread of international terrorism. \r\n We commend the efforts of the Secretary-General \r\nin strengthening the United Nations and promoting the \r\ncore values enshrined in our founding Charter: the \r\nfundamental principles of peace, justice and human \r\nrights. The Republic of Moldova supports the ongoing \r\nprocess of reform of the United Nations aimed at \r\ncreating a revitalized, representative, efficient and \r\nmore responsive Organization. Following significant \r\nadvances in the reform of its principal organs, we \r\nrecognize the steps being undertaken towards reform of \r\nthe Security Council, which undoubtedly necessitates a \r\nfirm political pledge on the part of the entire \r\nmembership.  \r\n In our opinion, the expansion of the Security \r\nCouncil is a matter not only of equity but also of \r\nefficiency. Any proposal for reform of the Council has \r\nto reflect the legitimate aspirations of the regional \r\ngroups. Thus, in supporting the expansion of the \r\nCouncil in both permanent and non-permanent \r\ncategories, we believe it indispensable to allocate an \r\nadditional non-permanent seat to the Eastern European \r\nGroup. \r\n By virtue of the primary responsibility of the \r\nSecurity Council laid down in the United Nations \r\nCharter, its reform should also contain provisions for \r\nconsolidating United Nations operational capacities in \r\nthe field and revitalizing peacekeeping operations in \r\norder to make them more effective and capable of \r\nachieving their goals, including the development of \r\ncooperation with regional organizations and Member \r\nStates for the resolution of conflicts in various areas of \r\nthe globe. \r\n Building a safer world requires the greater \r\ncommitment of Member States in the area of \r\ndisarmament, arms control and non-proliferation. We \r\nhave recently witnessed a historic summit of the \r\nSecurity Council, which voted to stop the spread of \r\nnuclear arms and endorsed a broad framework of \r\naction to reduce global nuclear dangers. The Republic \r\nof Moldova welcomes the results of the most recent \r\nConference on Facilitating the Entry into Force of the \r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, and looks \r\nforward to continued positive trends in the work of the \r\nConference on Disarmament and the Preparatory \r\nCommittee for the Review Conference of the Parties to \r\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons. \r\n The current global economic and financial crisis, \r\none of the most serious since the creation of the United \r\nNations, has affected virtually all countries, including \r\nthe Republic of Moldova. In 2008, the previous \r\nCommunist Government in Chisinau denied the \r\nexistence of an economic and financial crisis; only \r\nafter its defeat in the elections of 29 July 2009 did its \r\nrepresentatives begin to raise the alarm. \r\n The current administration, the Alliance for \r\nEuropean Integration, is assuming full responsibility \r\nA/64/PV.13 \r\n \r\n09-53165 24 \r\n \r\nfor managing the economic crisis by attracting funds \r\nfrom international financial organizations, securing \r\nforeign investment, providing jobs, reviving the real \r\nsector of the economy, ensuring the de-monopolization \r\nof production sectors, and liberalizing exports and \r\nimports. The liberal democratic Government relies on \r\nthe support of United Nations institutions and all \r\ninternational structures in promoting the rule of law, \r\nsafeguarding fundamental human rights and freedoms, \r\nand ensuring the functionality of democratic \r\ninstitutions and the freedom of mass media. \r\n The Republic of Moldova followed intently the \r\nwork of the high-level Conference on the World \r\nFinancial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on \r\nDevelopment, held this summer at the United Nations, \r\nand welcomed the adoption of its Outcome Document \r\n(resolution 63/303). The Conference highlighted once \r\nagain the role of the United Nations and gave a strong \r\nimpetus to the dialogue on identifying solutions for \r\novercoming the crisis and reforming the international \r\nfinancial architecture.  \r\n At the same time, Moldova stands for \r\nstrengthening the Economic and Social Council’s \r\ncoordinating role in formulating global economic and \r\nsocial policies and in further promoting active dialogue \r\nwith the international financial institutions and the \r\nGovernments of Member States in implementing the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. \r\n Nine years ago, in September 2000, the world’s \r\nleaders committed our countries to a global partnership \r\nin fighting poverty and achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. Today, in the context of the global \r\neconomic and financial crisis, considerable common \r\nefforts on the part of developed and developing \r\ncountries alike are needed to achieve our commitments \r\nby 2015. We welcome the decision to convene a high-\r\nlevel meeting in 2010 dedicated to evaluating the \r\nMillennium Summit decisions. \r\n The General Assembly has proclaimed 2009 the \r\nInternational Year of Reconciliation and the \r\nInternational Year of Human Rights Learning, and \r\n21 September as an International Day of Peace. It is in \r\nthis vein that we would like to reiterate the necessity \r\nfor an increased United Nations role and strengthened \r\ncooperation with regional organizations, such as the \r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, \r\nin preventing and managing crisis and conflict \r\nsituations; guaranteeing respect for and the promotion \r\nof fundamental human rights in separatist regions; \r\nundertaking more efficient international actions to \r\nstabilize the situation in countries affected by internal \r\nconflict; and taking a complex approach under \r\ninternational law to mediation and conflict resolution. \r\nThe intensification of international cooperation with a \r\nview to solving conflicts and preventing the future \r\nemergence or escalation of crisis situations that \r\nthreaten the sovereignty and territorial integrity of \r\nStates is of paramount importance for the Republic of \r\nMoldova, which faces a secessionist movement in the \r\neastern regions of the country.  \r\n Respecting the principle of the peaceful \r\nresolution of conflicts, we are confident that the \r\ndemilitarization and democratization of the \r\nTransdniestrian region are indispensable to a viable \r\nsolution to the Transdniestrian problem. The new \r\nLiberal Democratic Government’s coalition will \r\nundertake sustainable efforts to identify a lasting \r\nsolution to the Transdniestrian problem in the current \r\nfive plus two format and will consistently urge an \r\nincreased United States and European Union (EU) role \r\nin the resolution process. Concurrently, the Republic of \r\nMoldova will revive its efforts towards the withdrawal \r\nof foreign troops from the country, replacing the \r\npresent peacekeeping operation with a multinational \r\nmission with an international mandate, and achieving \r\nthe integration of the country in all socio-economic \r\nsegments by encouraging the broad participation of the \r\nnon-governmental sector.  \r\n We will consistently act in accordance with the \r\nlaw on the basic provisions of the Special Legal Status \r\nof Localities from the Left Bank of the Dniester River, \r\nadopted unanimously by Parliament on 22 July 2005. \r\nFocused on the creation of conditions needed for \r\nreconciliation and advancing the resolution process, we \r\nput forward a series of initiatives in 2007 to strengthen \r\ntrust and security between the two banks of the \r\nDniester River, in particular by ensuring free \r\nmovement, instituting common participation in \r\ndeveloping and implementing projects to restore and \r\nmodernize infrastructure, and addressing various social \r\nissues.  \r\n Unfortunately, the so-called Transdniestrian \r\nauthorities time and again have undermined these \r\ninitiatives by introducing illegal customs taxes, \r\nimpeding the elections process in the villages situated \r\non the left bank of the Dniester River, and confiscating \r\nschool premises, gravely violating the right of the \r\n A/64/PV.13\r\n \r\n25 09-53165 \r\n \r\nMoldovan citizens to study in their native language. \r\nThe implementation of democratic reforms and the \r\nnormalization of the economic and social climate on \r\nthe right side of the Dniester will accelerate the \r\nresolution of the Transdniestrian problem.  \r\n The Republic of Moldova appreciates the activity \r\nof the EU Border Assistance Mission to Moldova and \r\nUkraine and its close cooperation with the relevant \r\nborder management bodies in both States. Its \r\ncontribution to border security and transparency has \r\ncreated a more constructive atmosphere in which to \r\nseek a resolution of the Transdniestrian problem. The \r\nRepublic of Moldova will further direct its efforts to \r\nresuming negotiations in the existing format in view of \r\nresolving the Transdniestrian problem. We count on the \r\nconsistent support and political will of all mediators \r\nand observers in the resolution of this conflict. \r\n Ongoing terrorist activities in various parts of the \r\nworld demonstrate that terrorism continuously \r\nthreatens the security, fundamental democratic values, \r\nhuman rights and the letter of the law that are the basis \r\nof the United Nations Charter. This scourge can be \r\ndefeated only by firm, common action by the \r\ninternational community. In this context, we would like \r\nto reaffirm that the Republic of Moldova fully \r\nparticipates in the global fight against terrorism by \r\nimplementing measures at the national level and by \r\ncontributing to the international community’s efforts. \r\nThe new Government of Moldova will take concrete \r\naction in combating international terrorism in \r\naccordance with international instruments, pertinent \r\nresolutions of the Security Council and relevant \r\nnational documents, such as our national strategy for \r\npreventing and combating money-laundering and the \r\nfinancing of terrorism.  \r\n In compliance with the United Nations Global \r\nCounter-Terrorism Strategy (see resolution 60/288), the \r\nRepublic of Moldova will further contribute to future \r\nUnited Nations efforts at consolidating international \r\nlegislation to combat terrorism, especially in view of \r\nfinalizing the negotiations of the comprehensive \r\nconvention on international terrorism and organizing a \r\nhigh-level conference on terrorism under United \r\nNations auspices. We believe that special attention \r\nneeds to be paid to fighting those aspects of terrorism \r\nthat are nourished by separatist tendencies that affect \r\nthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of States. \r\n Climate change poses a grave challenge to the \r\ninternational community. Global warming and its \r\nrelated effects, including natural disasters, have \r\nbecome major threats to our peoples and to \r\ninternational security. Its consequences greatly affect \r\nvulnerable States, compromising economic growth and \r\nthe achievement of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. International cooperation is essential to dealing \r\nwith the obvious threat of climate change. We have to \r\nraise alarm concerning the urgent need to strengthen \r\nregional and global cooperation and to enhance the \r\nassistance of donor States to developing countries and \r\nto countries with economies in transition.  \r\n In recent years, the Republic of Moldova has \r\nbeen confronted with considerable natural calamities, \r\nfrom acute droughts to severe floods. Each year, the \r\nintensity and frequency of these phenomena increase. \r\nThe harm caused to the population, to the agricultural \r\nand food sectors, as well as to the overall national \r\neconomy is huge. In this respect, the implementation of \r\nthe United Nations Conventions addressing climate \r\nchange and desertification and the development of an \r\ninternational strategy for disaster reduction are of \r\nincreasing urgency for countries severely affected by \r\ndroughts and desertification.  \r\n The Republic of Moldova recognizes the \r\nimportance of environmental protection to ensuring the \r\nsustainable development of the country, as well as the \r\nneed for this issue to inform all national policies. In \r\nthis connection, we welcome the outcome of last \r\nweek’s Summit on Climate Change and strongly \r\nsupport the continuation of negotiations. We hope that \r\nwe will conclude the forthcoming Copenhagen \r\nConference with a new far-reaching document. We \r\npraise the Secretary-General’s efforts in mobilizing the \r\npolitical will needed for the adoption of a new, \r\nequitable and ambitious agreement.  \r\n The Republic of Moldova strongly supports the \r\nactivity of the High-Level Task Force on the Global \r\nFood Security Crisis set up and led by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. The efficient collaboration between the Food \r\nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, \r\nthe Bretton Woods institutions and other relevant \r\nUnited Nations structures, aimed at mobilizing new \r\nfunds in order to overcome the global food crisis, will \r\nsignificantly contribute to the achievement of a \r\ncomprehensive action plan on food security. We \r\nsupport the convening of the World Summit on Food \r\nSecurity in Rome in November this year.  \r\nA/64/PV.13 \r\n \r\n09-53165 26 \r\n \r\n The Republic of Moldova is firm in its path \r\ntowards European integration and committed to the \r\nuniversal values of peace, democracy, respect for \r\nhuman rights, the rule of law and economic freedom. \r\nEuropean integration constitutes the major strategic \r\ngoal of Moldova’s foreign and internal policies. We \r\nwelcome positive developments in our relations with \r\nthe European Union and their progress over the past \r\nfew years, particularly after the victory of the Alliance \r\nfor European Integration in the parliamentary elections \r\nheld on 29 July 2009.  \r\n The new Government will firmly pursue the goal \r\nof rehabilitating the image of the Republic of Moldova \r\nin the international arena and will negotiate in the near \r\nfuture a new association agreement with the European \r\nUnion. The leaders of the Alliance for European \r\nIntegration are firmly committed to an efficient reform \r\nof the socio-economic system in the Republic of \r\nMoldova, without which the advancement of the \r\ncountry towards progress and prosperity is hardly \r\npossible. Those commitments represent eloquent proof \r\nof the positive evolution of the political situation in the \r\nRepublic of Moldova after the recent parliamentary \r\nelections. The democratic process has been resumed.  \r\n The new Parliament has accepted the \r\nresponsibility of complying with all the \r\nrecommendations formulated by the European \r\nParliament and the Parliamentary Assembly of the \r\nCouncil of Europe with regard to the events of 7 April. \r\nThose recommendations call for Moldova to improve \r\nits electoral legislation and to initiate the process of \r\ndirect application of EU legislation. From this \r\nperspective, we count on the support and opportunities \r\noffered by the United Nations and its Member States to \r\npromote Moldova’s political and social economic \r\nobjectives, its aspirations to European integration, the \r\nresolution of the Transdniestrian problem and the \r\nwithdrawal of foreign troops. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to confirm the \r\nadherence of the Republic of Moldova to the ideals of \r\nthe United Nations and the will to further cooperate \r\nthrough concrete action with a view to accomplishing \r\nthe commitments assumed. While respecting the \r\ndiversity of views, cultures and religions of everyone, \r\nwe must also be united in reaching for a common \r\ngoal — protecting humanity and preserving human \r\ndignity as a foremost universal value. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Anastassis Mitsialis, chairman of \r\nthe delegation of the Hellenic Republic. \r\n Mr. Mitsialis (Greece): On behalf of Her \r\nExcellency the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nHellenic Republic, Ms. Dora Bakoyannis, who \r\nunfortunately could not be in New York today, I would \r\nlike to address the General Assembly. \r\n Allow me first to congratulate the President of \r\nthis body, Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki. I am confident \r\nthat his extensive prior experience will serve us well \r\nand guide us through the trials that we are called upon \r\nto address. I would also like to pay tribute to \r\nMr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann for his tireless efforts \r\nto promote the work of the General Assembly during \r\nits sixty-third session. \r\n I cannot but take pride in addressing the General \r\nAssembly of the most important ecumenical institution \r\nhumankind has ever created, the original idea of which \r\nwas initially conceived and put into practice by Greeks \r\n25 centuries ago. The ancient Greek Amphictyony was \r\nthe precursor and matrix of the concept of \r\nmultilateralism, which is the only way to deal \r\neffectively with the many and varied challenges faced \r\nby the international community. The United Nations is \r\nin fact, along with the various regional alliances and \r\norganizations, the essential framework for joining \r\nforces and collectively confronting our common threats \r\nand promoting our common values. \r\n Greece currently has the privilege of being at the \r\nhelm of one of the most important regional security \r\norganizations, the Organization for Security and \r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE). The OSCE’s \r\nconsensus-based decision-making process, along with \r\nits comprehensive approach to security, is a testament \r\nto the power of multilateralism. Greece has pledged to \r\nbe an honest broker and to work with every single \r\nparticipating State to realize the common vision for \r\npeace, security and development for all 56 members of \r\nthe organization. The Corfu Process, our common \r\npromise to turn the page on European security within \r\nthe framework of a structured all-inclusive dialogue, \r\nproves once more that where there is a will there is a \r\nway. \r\n Indeed, our annual gathering at the United \r\nNations is important, but it is not enough. What is \r\nneeded first and foremost is the political will to turn \r\nwords into deeds. We stand at a most critical juncture \r\n A/64/PV.13\r\n \r\n27 09-53165 \r\n \r\nfor our environmental, social and economic future, and \r\nall of us — policy-makers, diplomats, scientists, \r\nactivists and concerned citizens alike — have a \r\nresponsibility to preserve the habitability of our planet \r\nand hand over to our children a better world than the \r\none bequeathed to us. \r\n It was Aristotle who said that nature acts as if she \r\nforesees the future, and currently nature’s auguries are \r\nnot encouraging at all. We cannot afford to forget that \r\nour planet is in a state of environmental emergency. \r\nScientific evidence on the issue is compelling. The \r\nsocio-economic impact of climate change on the global \r\neconomy, if left unchecked, is likely to dwarf the \r\ncurrent economic recession.  \r\n Now is the time to speed up our joint efforts to \r\neffectively address the negative impact of climate \r\nchange, while respecting the principle of common but \r\ndifferentiated responsibilities and the respective \r\ncapabilities of each country. Copenhagen will be the \r\nlitmus test of our commitment to an ambitious, all-\r\ninclusive climate change agreement. \r\n The urgency of the situation is such that, if I may \r\nparaphrase the man who first set foot on the moon, \r\neven if man now takes a giant leap in trying to mitigate \r\nthe consequences of climate change, it will \r\nunfortunately still only be a small step for mankind. \r\nBut small steps are important too. Greece continues to \r\nstrongly support the financing of climate change \r\nadaptation and mitigation projects and of low-carbon \r\ndevelopment strategies. We have repeatedly proven our \r\ncommitment to this effect by supporting the most \r\nvulnerable countries’ adaptation to climate change \r\nthrough the provision of a total sum of €21 million \r\nthrough the end of 2011. \r\n The challenges posed to all nations by the current \r\neconomic crisis require an ambitious and imaginative \r\nrange of responses that provide effective and lasting \r\nsolutions. The United Nations can play a vital role in \r\nachieving these objectives. Our commitment to the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) needs to be \r\nreaffirmed. Regenerating the world economy and \r\npromoting sustainable pro-growth policies are \r\nfundamental to solving the crisis and essential to \r\nmaintaining and improving progress towards the \r\nachievement of the MDGs. Support for the most \r\nvulnerable nations, which have been even more deeply \r\naffected by food insecurity and climate change, is \r\nwhere a special effort must be made. \r\n Our action against hunger and want has not yet \r\nproduced the desired results, while humanitarian and \r\ndevelopment aid needs to be streamlined in order to be \r\nmore effective and productive. Synergetic multilateral \r\naction is urgently needed. People living on the edge \r\nhave run out of time. They need to know whether the \r\ndecisions of their leaders at the Pittsburgh summit are \r\nthe right decisions that will put us back on the road to \r\ndevelopment. \r\n We know that climate change, the economic crisis \r\nand the North-South divide are exacerbating pressures \r\non people to migrate. These crises are creating living \r\nconditions that contribute to one of the greatest \r\ndisgraces of humanity and one of the greatest insults to \r\nhuman dignity — the modern slave trade or human \r\ntrafficking.  \r\n Some 192 million people have been forced from \r\nthe lands of their birth. Almost a million people have \r\nbeen arrested since 2000 while trying to cross from \r\nTurkey to Greece in their quest for a better life. This \r\nmodern form of the slave trade has claimed thousands \r\nof lives. We owe it to them and to the people who have \r\nlost their lives to change things, to fight traffickers and \r\nwork together to discourage illegal migration by \r\nbringing development and giving a vision to countries \r\nthat migrants leave.  \r\n Athens will host the Global Forum on Migration \r\nand Development from 2 to 5 November 2009. We seek \r\nspecific proposals for actions and policies and we want \r\nto formulate best practices for adoption by the \r\nparticipating States. \r\n Terrorism continues to pose a serious threat to \r\ninternational peace, stability and security. The \r\ninternational commitment to confronting terrorism \r\nmust remain strong, and our efforts to successfully \r\naddress this challenge should be intensified. But if our \r\nefforts are to be successful and self-sustaining, they \r\nmust garner the broadest possible consensus and \r\nacceptance and be based on respect for the fundamental \r\nprinciples of international law and international \r\nhumanitarian law and on full respect for and the \r\nprotection of human rights. \r\n This brings me to an issue that has come to the \r\nforefront of international attention and concern — the \r\nissue of human rights. Respect for human rights is one \r\nof the cornerstones of the contemporary legal order. \r\nHuman rights conventions and institutions have raised \r\nthe awareness and sensitivity of States, Governments, \r\nA/64/PV.13 \r\n \r\n09-53165 28 \r\n \r\ncivil society, international organizations and \r\nnon-governmental organizations. \r\n Greece has submitted its candidacy for a seat on \r\nthe United Nations Human Rights Council for the \r\nperiod 2012-2015, as it wishes to play a proactive role \r\nin the protection of human rights. We believe that the \r\nCouncil can play a crucial role in the improvement of \r\nthe situation of human rights worldwide. That role \r\nshould not be restricted to pointing out the violators, \r\nbut should mainly help overcome shortfalls and \r\nimplement universal standards. \r\n Interest in the protection of human rights must be \r\ngenuine and anthropocentric, and protection must be \r\ncarried out in full compliance with the fundamental \r\nprinciples of international law and the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations.  \r\n We should award a special place to gender issues \r\nin the system of human rights protection. Women’s \r\nrights deserve all our attention, because they continue \r\nto be violated systematically and flagrantly in many \r\ncorners of the world. Education and equal working \r\nopportunities are key areas. \r\n As I said earlier, Greece approached its current \r\nterm in office as OSCE Chair with a heightened sense \r\nof responsibility and sensitivity, based on the belief \r\nthat security and stability are not and should not be a \r\nzero-sum game. In the post-cold-war era, where \r\nsecurity challenges are multifaceted and interlinked, \r\nthe security needs of all States should be given due \r\nconsideration despite contradictory and often mutually \r\nexclusive political perceptions of what is right and just. \r\n Since January, our aim has been to build \r\nconsensus and achieve collective and comprehensive \r\nsolutions to deep-rooted and protracted conflicts, \r\nconvinced that enhancing the security of one will \r\nundoubtedly enhance the security of all. Our efforts \r\nhave been based on mutual trust and confidence and on \r\nthe realization that security is both indivisible and \r\ncomprehensive. In some cases however, as in Georgia, \r\nconsensus has been elusive. \r\n Our most important collective achievement has \r\nbeen the launching of the Corfu Process, a profound \r\nand open debate on the future of security in Europe. \r\nThe Corfu Process marks a pan-European effort to \r\nrevisit and redefine the broader European security \r\nsystem. At the Athens Ministerial Meeting in \r\nDecember, we aim to lay a solid foundation, so that our \r\ndialogue will start producing tangible results. \r\n A few days ago the Security Council adopted \r\nresolution 1887 (2009), thus taking an important step \r\nin the direction of advancing nuclear disarmament and \r\nnon-proliferation. We applaud that important decision. \r\nYet, practical tools are essential for the achievement of \r\nhigh-minded political goals such as this. Greece firmly \r\nbelieves that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons remains the cornerstone of the \r\nnuclear non-proliferation regime. Broad participation \r\nin it, along with the conclusion of comprehensive \r\nsafeguards agreements and the implementation of the \r\nadditional protocol, is, beyond any doubt, the most \r\neffective answer to threats of nuclear proliferation. It is \r\nequally important to have additional ratifications of the \r\nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the early drafting \r\nof a fissile material cut-off treaty. \r\n As regards major international and regional \r\nissues, conflicts and flashpoints, Greece fully \r\nsubscribes to the European Union (EU) policy and \r\naction, as described by its presidency. The role of the \r\nEU in the handling of a number of urgent and difficult \r\nsituations, such as piracy in Somalia, has proved to be \r\nvital, successful and effective. \r\n The broader region of South-Eastern Europe and \r\nthe Eastern Mediterranean is at the forefront of Greek \r\nforeign policy. It is a vital region from a geopolitical \r\nand geo-strategic perspective, but also one of the most \r\nvolatile areas of the world. Our vision for the region \r\nincorporates the consolidation of security, stability and \r\ndevelopment. Our aim is to work with all neighbouring \r\nStates in the region to promote stability, democracy \r\nand robust economies, with the ultimate goal of \r\nelevating the quality of life of the citizens to the \r\nhighest European standards. This vision is founded on \r\nfour pillars: first, the establishment and safeguarding \r\nof good neighbourly relations; secondly, the full \r\nintegration of all the countries of South-Eastern Europe \r\ninto European and Euro-Atlantic structures; thirdly, the \r\nenhancement and further deepening of regional \r\ncooperation in the fields of infrastructure, economy \r\nand trade; and, last but not least, the strengthening of \r\nbonds and cultural interaction at the level of civil \r\nsocieties. We are doing everything in our power to \r\nmaterialize this vision. \r\n We continue to build upon the agenda of the \r\nThessaloniki European Council of 2003, which laid the \r\n A/64/PV.13\r\n \r\n29 09-53165 \r\n \r\nfoundations for the integration of the Western Balkan \r\ncountries into the European Union, on the condition, of \r\ncourse, that the accession criteria and requirements are \r\nfully met. The prospect of a future within Europe for \r\nalmost all the Western Balkan countries is now within \r\nreach and seems more feasible than ever. \r\n At the same time, Greece is promoting regional \r\ncooperation by financing of and participating in \r\nsignificant infrastructure projects, and by joining \r\nforces with other neighbouring countries to establish a \r\nreliable and adequate energy-distribution network. It is \r\none of the top investment and trade partners in most of \r\nthe neighbouring countries, thus contributing to the \r\ndevelopment of the entire area. \r\n Above all, we are working hard to establish and \r\nconsolidate good neighbourly relations by pursuing and \r\npromoting the peaceful settlement of disputes on the \r\nbasis of international law. However, long-standing \r\ndisputes persist. For the past 15 years Greece has \r\nparticipated in United Nations-led negotiations on the \r\nissue of the name of the former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia. Greece has participated in good faith. \r\nRegrettably, no substantive or tangible progress has \r\nbeen made so far, despite the fact that Greece has taken \r\na huge step towards a compromise. We have accepted \r\nthe use of the term “Macedonia” along with a \r\ngeographical qualifier that reflects reality. Of the large \r\ngeographical region of Macedonia, only a part falls \r\nwithin our neighbour’s territory. So how can this \r\ncountry claim exclusive rights to the name? The \r\npersistence of the leadership in Skopje in claiming \r\nexclusive rights to the name by denying a geographic \r\nqualifier and the anachronistic rhetoric and policies \r\nthat run contrary to the principle of good neighbourly \r\nrelations raise serious questions as to that \r\nGovernment’s real motives. Greece is negotiating for a \r\nsolution that will respect the dignity of both countries \r\nand both peoples. We are negotiating for a clear \r\nsolution to which both sides will agree and which our \r\nneighbour will use with pride in its dealings with \r\neveryone — a solution that will make everyone a \r\nwinner. \r\n The Cyprus issue is still an open wound at the \r\nvery heart of Europe. Thanks to the efforts of President \r\nChristofias, a new round of talks has started under the \r\nauspices of the United Nations. This gives rise to hope, \r\nbut there is still a long way to go, and there are many \r\nhurdles and difficulties to overcome. Greece supports a \r\ndefinitive, sustainable and just solution, based on the \r\nUnited Nations resolutions and compatible with \r\nEuropean Union values, principles and institutional \r\nframework, one that will lead to the reunification of the \r\nisland. We strongly believe that the two communities \r\nshould be left alone, with no external pressures, \r\nguidance or interventions, to decide on their common \r\nfuture. The solution must be theirs and theirs alone. \r\nArtificial deadlines, strict time frames and threats of a \r\npermanent division have no role in the quest for a \r\ndurable solution. They add unnecessary pressure and \r\nstrain to the delicate negotiating process and raise \r\nquestions about the true intentions of those promoting \r\nthem. \r\n The current situation in Cyprus is unacceptable. \r\nTurkish military forces continue to occupy part of the \r\nterritory of a European Union member State. Turkey — \r\na European Union candidate — refuses to recognize a \r\nfully fledged European Union member and future \r\npartner. Once-vibrant cities like Famagusta remain \r\nghost towns. The families of missing persons continue \r\nto wonder about their loved ones’ fates, while the \r\nunspeakable atrocities of the past come to light, little \r\nby little. This picture is unimaginable in the eyes of the \r\naverage European citizen and completely incompatible \r\nwith today’s European reality. We hope that the Cypriot \r\npeople — both Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots — \r\nwill be able to leave behind the painful past and look, \r\nreunited, to the future that awaits them within the \r\nEuropean family, which constitutes the best guarantee \r\nfor their security and prosperity. Turkey, which holds \r\nthe key to the solution of the Cyprus issue, knows full \r\nwell that such a solution would also speed up its own \r\njourney to the European Union. \r\n Greece is probably the most sincere supporter of \r\nTurkey’ s accession to the European Union — and this \r\nis true even at a difficult time. It is our conviction that \r\nTurkey would be a better neighbour for Greece if it \r\ncarried out all necessary reforms and became a \r\nEuropean Union member State. Turkish membership \r\nwould contribute to stability in our region. Yet, this is \r\nnot a blank check, nor is it a leap of faith. In order to \r\nbecome a member of the European Union, Turkey will \r\nhave to fulfil all the criteria set by the European Union. \r\n The Government I represent has invested in \r\nGreek-Turkish rapprochement. Kostas Karamanlis is \r\nthe first Greek Prime Minister to have paid an official \r\nvisit to Ankara in 40 years. We dared to turn the page. \r\nWe went beyond words, but we have not seen an active \r\nresponse from the other side. Turkey declares that it \r\nA/64/PV.13 \r\n \r\n09-53165 30 \r\n \r\nwants zero problems with its neighbours. Yet, Turkish \r\nfighter jets kept flying only a few metres above the \r\nrooftops of Greek islanders’ homes throughout the \r\nsummer. The Turkish Parliament maintains a threat of \r\nwar against my country. \r\n Disputes should be settled peacefully and in \r\naccordance with international law. The United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea, which embodies \r\ncustomary law, shows the way to settle maritime \r\nboundary disputes peacefully. Greece would welcome a \r\ndecision by Turkey to follow the example of the other \r\n160 Members of the United Nations that have ratified \r\nthe Convention. Such a move, along with clear \r\npolitical will on the Turkish side to invest in friendly \r\nrelations with Greece, could strike a definitive blow to \r\nthe tensions and mistrust in our bilateral relations and \r\ncontribute to the promotion of peace and stability in \r\nour entire region. \r\n Aristotle proposed that it is possible to fail in \r\nmany ways, while to succeed is possible in only one \r\nway. It is our conviction that this one way is effective \r\nmultilateralism led by the United Nations. We need the \r\nleadership of the United Nations, if we are to carry out \r\nour ultimate mission — safeguarding the dignity, lives \r\nand freedoms of the citizens we represent. We need to \r\ngive the Secretary-General the tools to guide this \r\nOrganization, so that the United Nations can once \r\nagain take up its central role in international life and \r\nmeet the myriad challenges facing humanity. We have \r\nto identify the weaknesses of the United Nations and \r\nwe must have the courage to redress them, using \r\ncommon sense, just as we would do at home, in our \r\ncountries, because every failure of the United Nations \r\nis a personal failure for each and every one of us, and \r\nbecause the world is changing, and we have to change \r\nwith it. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Carsten Staur, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of the Kingdom of Denmark.  \r\n Mr. Staur (Denmark): At this moment in time, \r\nmajor economic and environmental challenges are \r\ngiving rise to increasing global concerns and impacting \r\npeople all over this planet. To meet those challenges \r\neffectively, we need, more than ever, a dynamic and \r\nproactive multilateral system. We need the United \r\nNations to provide global answers to global challenges. \r\n In less than three months, we will meet again in \r\nCopenhagen to seal the deal on climate change. The \r\neffects of climate change are increasingly felt all over \r\nthe world, not least in developing countries, and the \r\nwhole world is looking to us for answers. And answers \r\nwe must provide — new directions for the future, \r\ntransformational changes in the way we do business \r\nand a new paradigm for growth and development. In \r\nthis respect, I do welcome the leadership of the \r\nSecretary-General as demonstrated by his call for a \r\nSummit on Climate Change a few days ago and by his \r\nconcluding remarks on that occasion. \r\n The message is clear: we must act now to avoid \r\npotentially disastrous changes in the global climate. \r\nThe focus in Copenhagen three months from now will \r\nbe on three deliverables. First, we must agree on a \r\ncommon goal for a significant reduction in global \r\ncarbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and we must set clear \r\ntargets for both medium and longer term. Secondly, we \r\nmust agree on a pathway towards achieving these \r\ntargets. And, thirdly, we must set in motion the policies \r\nand measures to sustain our efforts on that pathway. \r\n Reducing CO2 emissions is a challenge for \r\nindustrialized countries, emerging economies and \r\ndeveloping countries alike. There is no contradiction \r\nbetween economic growth and ambitious policies to \r\naddress climate change. Pursuing a green economy is \r\npossible, as shown by the example of, among others, \r\nmy own country. And, in this context, it is also \r\nimportant to keep in mind the security risks emanating \r\nfrom climate change in all parts of the world. I \r\nwelcome the Secretary-General’s recent report on this \r\nissue entitled “Climate change and its possible security \r\nimplications” (A/64/350), and look forward to further \r\ndeliberations on this topic. \r\n The ongoing financial and economic crisis is \r\nreversing hard-won progress in developing countries \r\nstriving to achieve the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). The international community must assist the \r\npoorest of those countries in mitigating the immediate \r\neffects of the crisis, while at the same time ensuring \r\nthat we do not lose sight of the longer-term challenges \r\nin relation to the MDGs and the climate change \r\nagenda. There is an imminent risk that the economic \r\ncrisis will lead to the overall stagnation — or even the \r\nreduction — of official development assistance. That is \r\na challenge we must counter and overcome, and it is \r\nmore crucial than ever that all donors speed up delivery \r\non their aid commitments. \r\n A/64/PV.13\r\n \r\n31 09-53165 \r\n \r\n African countries, in particular, are facing \r\nsignificant obstacles in their efforts to achieve the \r\nMDGs. As recommended by the Africa Commission \r\nand the MDG3 Global Call to Action, both initiated by \r\nthe Government of Denmark, there is a need to focus \r\nstrongly on employment for young people, economic \r\nempowerment of women and private sector-led \r\neconomic growth. Renewed focus on those policy areas \r\nwill also be essential in coping with the economic \r\ncrisis and its impact on the continent. \r\n As we embark on the final stage towards 2015, \r\nthe upcoming 2010 MDG Summit gives us an \r\nimportant opportunity to identify means to speed up \r\nachievement of the MDGs. Denmark looks forward to \r\nthis occasion and is ready to engage actively in the \r\nprocess. \r\n In an increasingly globalized and dynamic world, \r\nwhere the problems we face tend to become ever more \r\ncomplex and intertwined, it is important to treasure and \r\nuphold the principles and the objectives enshrined in \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations: to promote and \r\nencourage respect for human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms for all; to establish conditions under which \r\njustice and respect for international obligations can be \r\nmaintained; and to promote social progress and better \r\nstandards of living. \r\n States must protect their own populations, and \r\nStates must be accountable to the global community. In \r\nthat context, I welcome the recent debate held in this \r\nHall on the responsibility to protect, which showed \r\noverwhelming support for the concept on the part of \r\nMember States. It bodes well for our continued \r\ndeliberations on that issue. \r\n I should also like to use this opportunity to \r\nencourage all United Nations Members that have not \r\nyet done so to become States parties to the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. There should be no \r\nimpunity for the perpetrators of the most serious \r\ninternational crimes. \r\n Among the most serious present dangers to peace \r\nand security is the proliferation of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction and their means of delivery. The upcoming \r\nReview Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is of utmost \r\nimportance. The meeting of the Security Council on \r\n24 September, headed by President Obama (see \r\nS/PV.6191), provided ample evidence. We welcome the \r\nnegotiations between the United States and Russia on \r\nreductions to follow up on the Treaty on Strategic \r\nOffensive Arms, and we welcome President Obama’s \r\ncommitment to the ratification of the Comprehensive \r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, both of which will have a \r\npositive impact on the NPT Review Conference. \r\n I should like to take the opportunity to call on \r\nIran and the Democratic People’ s Republic of Korea to \r\ncomply with their obligations to suspend enrichment \r\nactivities and to start negotiations on transparent \r\ncivilian nuclear programmes, as set forth in Security \r\nCouncil resolutions. \r\n The election in Afghanistan was far from perfect. \r\nWe need to engage with the new Government to create \r\nthe crucial legitimacy between the Afghan Government \r\nand the Afghan people. The new Afghan compact to be \r\nbuilt is that between the Government and the people, \r\nand our role should be to strengthen that compact and \r\nhold the Government accountable. In terms of the role \r\nof the international community, we need to be better \r\ncoordinated and more effective in our support for \r\nbuilding the capacity of the Afghan Government. In \r\nthis the United Nations and the United Nations \r\nAssistance Mission in Afghanistan play a crucial role. \r\n In neighbouring Pakistan, the international \r\ncommunity and the Friends of Democratic Pakistan \r\nmust seize the opportunity to support the democratic \r\nGovernment in fighting poverty and extremism. We \r\nmust help Pakistan build a stable, democratic and \r\nprosperous State. This would be a significant \r\ncontribution to peace and development in South Asia. I \r\nwarmly welcome the efforts of the Government to fight \r\nterrorism, while, at the same time, it tries to alleviate \r\nthe hardship experienced by Pakistan’s internally \r\ndisplaced persons (IDPs). It is a positive development \r\nthat so many IDPs have returned. Now, a full and fast \r\nimplementation of the Malakand development strategy \r\nis important. \r\n The deadlock in the Middle East peace process \r\nand the high level of regional tensions demand new \r\ninternational efforts to promote stability and peace in \r\nthe region. We are encouraged to see the enhanced \r\nAmerican engagement in the Middle East, and we urge \r\nall in the region and all parties to the Middle East \r\nconflict to honour the Road Map commitments, move \r\nspeedily ahead and, once and for all, settle their \r\ndifferences in accordance with the international \r\nagreements and the Arab Peace Initiative. Furthermore, \r\nDenmark is in favour of expanding the mandate of the \r\nA/64/PV.13 \r\n \r\n09-53165 32 \r\n \r\nQuartet to include a regional dimension. Also, the \r\nSyrian and Lebanese peace tracks should feature \r\npermanently on the agenda of the Quartet. \r\n Pirates operating in the Indian Ocean and the \r\nGulf of Aden off the coast of Somalia are a security \r\nchallenge that poses new legal challenges. Denmark \r\nhas taken the lead in the international community’s \r\nwork to identify practical and legal solutions so as to \r\nensure the prosecution of suspected pirates. We \r\nwelcome the increasingly active involvement of the \r\nUnited Nations in that issue. \r\n In that respect, we have to remember that what is \r\ntaking place on the open sea is closely linked to the \r\nsituation on the ground in Somalia. Bringing security \r\nand stability to the Somalis is of the highest priority, \r\nand Denmark supports the efforts of the United Nations \r\nand the African Union, and the Djibouti process. \r\n The United Nations itself must be able to change \r\nin order to effectively meet and deliver on all those \r\nnew challenges. It is important to keep up momentum \r\nin the intergovernmental negotiations on reform of the \r\nSecurity Council in order to adapt that key body to the \r\nworld of today. The United Nations peacekeeping \r\ncommitments continue to play a decisive role in global \r\npeace and security, with now more than 100,000 \r\npeacekeepers deployed in nearly 20 missions globally. \r\nHowever, the immense growth and the demand for \r\nstrengthening the capacity to manage and to sustain \r\nthose peacekeeping operations have revealed shortfalls \r\npertaining to the decision-making processes and the \r\nengagements themselves. Denmark, therefore, warmly \r\nsupports recent initiatives that would enable us to meet \r\nthe growing demands with a system in place that is \r\nmore effective, more transparent and more \r\naccountable. \r\n Security is a precondition to programme delivery. \r\nSome degree of risk cannot be avoided, but the \r\nchallenge is to mitigate it. Denmark, therefore, \r\nsupports the continuing overhaul of security \r\nassessments and procedures. However, the situation in \r\na country after the end of a conflict is also often \r\nextremely volatile. There is a need to ensure quick, \r\neffective and efficient support in post-conflict \r\nsituations and to strengthen peacebuilding efforts. The \r\nUnited Nations is uniquely suited to lead those efforts, \r\nand we welcome the strong emphasis on that issue and \r\nlook forward to the review of the peacebuilding \r\narchitecture next year. \r\n The work of the United Nations in the area of \r\ngender, women’ s rights and development has for too \r\nlong been fragmented and underfunded. In that light, \r\nthe recent decision by the General Assembly in \r\nresolution 63/311 to create a new gender entity within \r\nthe United Nations is of great significance. We will \r\nsupport the Secretary-General in every possible way in \r\nhis efforts to ensure the swift establishment of such an \r\nentity. The rapid creation of a new gender entity will \r\nrepresent a milestone in the important work of \r\nreforming the United Nations system. \r\n All United Nations entities, funds and \r\nprogrammes and the Secretariat need to act more \r\ncoherently. On the operational side, we strongly \r\nsupport the “delivering as one” initiative which seeks \r\nto base the various parts of the system on a common \r\nunderstanding of needs and priorities and with full \r\ncountry ownership of the joint programme. It is a \r\ncollective responsibility and an opportunity to \r\ncomprehensively pursue that agenda. More effective \r\nand efficient ways of working system-wide are \r\nimportant; therefore, harmonization of the \r\nOrganization’ s business practices must be accelerated \r\nacross the system. \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n Multilateral cooperation is the best means of \r\nmaintaining international peace and security and of \r\nresponding to the challenges, risks and opportunities in \r\nan interdependent and globalized world. This \r\nOrganization holds great legitimacy and moral force, \r\nand we encourage the United Nations — Member \r\nStates, the entire organizational system and the \r\nSecretariat — to seize the moment and take the lead in \r\naddressing the new global challenges. An ambitious \r\nand successful outcome to the upcoming fifteenth \r\nsession of the Conference of the Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change in \r\nCopenhagen in December would be a significant step \r\nin that direction. \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Ronald Jean Jumeau, chairman of the delegation of \r\nthe Republic of Seychelles. \r\n Mr. Jumeau (Seychelles): On behalf of President \r\nJames Michel of Seychelles, leader of one of the \r\nsmallest nations of this Assembly, I congratulate you, \r\nSir, on your election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-fourth session. \r\n A/64/PV.13\r\n \r\n33 09-53165 \r\n \r\n With a population of just over 85,000, we are \r\npainfully aware of our vulnerability as a nation at the \r\nmercy of the ebb and flow of global tides. Our \r\nvulnerability is all the more acute in this age marked \r\nby economic and other crises and the increasingly \r\ndestructive effects of climate change. However, \r\nprecisely because of that, our citizens are aware of our \r\nresponsibility as a nation within the community of \r\nnations. We are aware that the solutions to our \r\nproblems do not lie solely within our borders. As \r\nan assembly of nations, we must take into account \r\nmore than ever the responsibility that we have and that \r\nwe share. That is our responsibility to our peoples and \r\nto humanity as a whole.  \r\n The international community has not shirked that \r\nresponsibility in the face of the world financial crisis, \r\nfor example, as every nation has had to react in one \r\nway or another. In Seychelles, our inherent \r\nvulnerabilities and economic imbalances, which had \r\naccumulated over time, meant that we had to act earlier \r\nthan many other States to face up to the crisis. We \r\nentered into a Standby Arrangement with the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and are also \r\ndiscussing debt rescheduling through the Paris Club. \r\n The process has been difficult for every \r\nSeychellois, but we are seeing the results, and our \r\nnation is emerging stronger and more resilient. We still \r\nhave a long way to go, but we, and our multilateral and \r\nbilateral partners, have all been surprised at how \r\nquickly we have emerged and managed to improve our \r\neconomic situation. The process has also marked a \r\nmilestone in the relationship between multilateral \r\nfinancial institutions and a small island developing \r\nState. It has proved to us that, although the voices of \r\nthe smaller States are often drowned in the tumult of \r\nthe international arena, the instruments of the global \r\neconomy can be adapted to meet the needs of a smaller \r\npartner. \r\n Our specificities and vulnerabilities have been \r\nrecognized throughout the discussions with our \r\nmultilateral and bilateral partners. Seychelles would \r\nlike to salute the role played by the IMF, the World \r\nBank and the African Development Bank in that \r\nprocess. We would also like to express our appreciation \r\nto our bilateral partners and other organizations that \r\nhave supported us in one way or another in facing up to \r\nthe crisis. It is an example of a responsibility shared. \r\nThrough shared responsibility, a crisis can be \r\ncontained. Through shared responsibility, what \r\nappeared to be impossible has become achievable. \r\n It is our duty in this Assembly to use the principle \r\nof shared responsibility in solving our global problems, \r\nespecially in offering solidarity and assistance to those \r\nStates in need of outside support. We have all heard \r\nhow the unrest in Somalia has spilled beyond its \r\nborders to manifest itself as piracy on the high seas. \r\nSeychelles is one of the States directly affected and \r\nheavily impacted by that scourge, as pirates prey on \r\nshipping and lay siege to the yachting, tourism and \r\nfishing industries of the Western Indian Ocean. \r\n The long-term effects are much broader: as \r\ninsurance premiums for shipping increase, the cost of \r\ntransporting essential goods rises correspondingly. \r\nAlso, we have often seen that economic desperation, \r\ncoupled with long-term political instability, can lead to \r\na breeding ground for terrorism. \r\n Seychelles is pleased to note the increasing \r\nengagement of many States in the fight against piracy \r\nin the Indian Ocean. We share the responsibility to \r\nensure peace and stability in the region; as always, this \r\nis the prerequisite for progress. We must take action in \r\nthree areas to effectively tackle the piracy situation. \r\nThe root cause of the problem lies within Somalia. The \r\nlong-term solution lies in establishing peace, stability, \r\nprogress and the rule of law within Somalia. Through \r\nenhanced coordination and the sharing of information, \r\nwe must ensure that piracy is not economically viable. \r\nWe must share information to ensure that, by keeping \r\nvessels beyond their reach, we are always ahead of the \r\npirates. \r\n We must ensure that there is enough deterrence in \r\nterms of military assets in the region. Seychelles alone \r\nhas an exclusive economic zone of 1.4 million square \r\nkilometres to patrol and protect, which we would not \r\nbe able to do effectively without the help of friendly \r\ncountries. \r\n Nowhere is our shared responsibility more \r\nneeded than in protecting and nurturing our shared \r\nenvironment. For the small island developing States \r\n(SIDS), the preservation of our environment is about \r\nour safety, our security, our economy and, ultimately, \r\nour survival. Thus, the battle against climate change is \r\nfor a battle for our survival. Small island States and \r\nother particularly vulnerable nations, such as the least \r\ndeveloped countries, cannot look at that issue in any \r\nother way. \r\nA/64/PV.13 \r\n \r\n09-53165 34 \r\n \r\n The fight against climate change is a fight based \r\non our undeniable human right to exist not only as \r\nnation States, but as peoples and communities. For \r\nexample, the Arctic peoples and other indigenous \r\npeoples are also suffering from climate change first \r\nhand. Their voices, just like those of us in the SIDS \r\nand other particularly vulnerable States, need to be \r\nheard by the world’ s leaders. \r\n Nothing is more critical to our survival as States, \r\nas nations, as peoples and as communities than an \r\nurgent, coherent and effective response to the effects of \r\nclimate change. But the response thus far has been \r\nsorely lacking. Weeks before Copenhagen, we are still \r\nunsure as to what type of an agreement we will get \r\nthere. Furthermore, there are indications that if an \r\nagreement is made, it will not suffice to save many \r\nisland States. \r\n As the last small island developing State to speak \r\nin this general debate, Seychelles therefore feels it has \r\na duty to remind the international community that in \r\nthe coming weeks before Copenhagen, the Alliance of \r\nSmall Island States will continue to steadfastly call for \r\nthat which is necessary to our survival. That includes \r\nstabilizing long-term atmospheric greenhouse gas \r\nconcentrations at well below 350 parts per million; \r\nensuring that average global surface temperature \r\nincreases be limited to well below 1.5 degrees Celsius \r\nabove pre-industrial levels; and requiring global \r\ngreenhouse gas emissions to peak by 2015 and decline \r\nsignificantly thereafter. Furthermore, greenhouse gas \r\nemissions should be reduced by more than 85 per cent \r\nby 2050. Annex 1 greenhouse gas emissions should be \r\nreduced by at least 45 per cent by 2020 and by 2050, at \r\nleast 95 per cent of 1990 carbon dioxide levels should \r\nbe reduced. Non-Annex 1 emissions should also \r\ndemonstrate significant deviations from baseline over \r\ncomparable time periods. \r\n Before concluding, Seychelles must salute the \r\nUnited Nations for the body of work it has contributed \r\nto advancing our understanding of how climate change \r\nis damaging our planet. Seychelles also thanks \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his leadership in \r\nensuring that climate change, and especially the plight \r\nof the particularly vulnerable such as the small island \r\ndeveloping States, get the attention they deserve. \r\n The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \r\nhas shown us that climate change is a disaster very \r\nmuch in the making. It is a disaster which, unlike \r\nprevious global disasters, is not occurring in one \r\nsudden instant, but rather is gaining in pace and \r\ndestructive power over time. It is also a disaster which \r\nis man-made, which is to say that it is our fault. As \r\nsuch, it is a disaster that we have a duty and a \r\nresponsibility to prevent and that we can prevent. \r\n We cannot afford to leave any nation behind in \r\nCopenhagen, no matter how poor, how weak or how \r\nsmall. Once again, this is our shared responsibility that \r\nwe must assume.  \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Kodjo Menan, chairman of the delegation of the \r\nTogolese Republic. \r\n Mr. Menan (Togo) (spoke in French): At the \r\noutset, allow me to convey the warm greetings of the \r\nHead of State, Government and people of Togo on the \r\noccasion of the sixty-fourth session of the General \r\nAssembly. I also wish to add that the Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Togo, who unfortunately is absent \r\nfrom New York, asked me to read out the following \r\nstatement : \r\n  “From this rostrum, where the leaders of the \r\nentire planet have expressed their views on the \r\nmajor questions of the time, I should in turn like \r\nto share with this Assembly the following ideas, \r\nprompted by the developments in our world over \r\nthe past 12 months.  \r\n  “Before performing this duty, however, I \r\nwish to convey to you, Sir, the warm \r\ncongratulations of the Government and the people \r\nof Togo on your well-deserved election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at this \r\nsession. I can assure you of my delegation’s \r\nwillingness to work with you to carry out your \r\nmandate, the success of which will do honour to \r\nAfrica and in particular to your country, the \r\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya, with which Togo \r\nmaintains friendly relations of solidarity and \r\ncooperation. \r\n  “Also I wish to convey to your predecessor, \r\nFather Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann, my \r\ncongratulations on his work and in particular for \r\nthe commendable initiatives he undertook \r\nthroughout his mandate to restore the General \r\nAssembly to its due place and role under the \r\nUnited Nations Charter. To His Excellency \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon, I convey our \r\n A/64/PV.13\r\n \r\n35 09-53165 \r\n \r\ncongratulations for the dynamic and pragmatic \r\nmanner with which he has guided our \r\nOrganization.  \r\n  “I hereby forcefully reaffirm Togo’s full \r\nadherence to the ideals of peace, security and \r\ndevelopment that are at the centre of the priorities \r\nof our Organization. My country also endorses \r\nthe approaches adopted by our Organization in \r\nrecent years to further sustainable development \r\nby promoting peace and security and by \r\nmobilizing international solidarity in the \r\neconomic, social and cultural arenas. \r\n  “Political, administrative and economic \r\ngovernance remains essential to the consolidation \r\nof peace and security in our countries and \r\nundoubtedly helps to speed up achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. However, no \r\nharmonious and lasting development is possible \r\nwithout a climate of peace and national concord. \r\nThat is why the Government of Togo spares no \r\neffort to create conditions conducive to bold \r\nreforms and to lay the foundations for a new \r\nrepublican pact and national reconciliation. \r\nIndeed, since 2005, the Government, under the \r\nguidance of the Head of State, has worked \r\ntirelessly for a policy of openness, the promotion \r\nof democracy, the strengthening of the rule of law \r\nand the reduction of poverty. A number of \r\nreforms have been undertaken in this regard, \r\nespecially in the political, constitutional, \r\ninstitutional and socio-economic areas. \r\n  “Politically, the Head of State has engaged \r\nin dialogue as an instrument of political \r\nconsensus. This approach, based on a politics of \r\ncomplete openness, culminated in the signing in \r\nAugust 2006 of the Global Political Accord, \r\nwhich in turn led to the formation of a \r\nGovernment of national unity, facilitated by His \r\nExcellency Blaise Compaoré, President of \r\nBurkina Faso. I recall that the implementation of \r\nthe Global Political Accord and the 22 \r\ncommitments undertaken with the European \r\nUnion led to the holding of free and democratic \r\nlegislative elections in October 2007, which were \r\nwelcomed unanimously by the international \r\ncommunity. In the same spirit, a Truth, Justice \r\nand Reconciliation Commission has been set up, \r\nthe members of which were appointed on 29 May \r\n2009. Its purpose is to shed light on the political \r\nacts of violence that occurred in Togo between \r\n1958 and 2005 in order once and for all to banish \r\nimpunity from our country and to reconcile the \r\npeople of Togo with their history. \r\n  “With regard to constitutional reform, \r\nsignificant progress has been made. In August, \r\nthe National Assembly adopted a law modifying \r\nthe electoral code, relaxing the eligibility \r\nconditions for presidential elections, and allowing \r\nfor the establishment of a national independent \r\nelectoral commission and its reconfiguration in \r\norder to adapt it to current political realities. At \r\nthe same time, discussions of certain questions \r\ncontinue with the firm resolve of the Government \r\nto carry out the rest of the reforms on the basis of \r\nconsensus, since we have made concerted action \r\nand dialogue the foundation of our political \r\naction in Togo. \r\n  “In the institutional area, we have striven to \r\nreconstitute the Constitutional Court, the National \r\nHuman Rights Commission and the High \r\nAuthority for Audiovisual and Communication. \r\nSimilarly, the Government of Togo has \r\nestablished a court of audits and adopted statutes \r\nfor the army, the security forces and the \r\nopposition. It has also made arrangements for the \r\npublic financing of political parties and the \r\norgans of the private press. \r\n  “As concerns the judiciary, our vast \r\nmodernization programme of the judicial system \r\ncontinues in a satisfactory manner, with a view to \r\ninvolving the people more closely in the \r\nadministration of justice. In this regard, the \r\nGovernment has taken measures to guarantee \r\ncitizens freedom of expression, for example, by \r\ndecriminalizing press offences. Furthermore, to \r\ndemonstrate its desire to respect human dignity \r\nand defend human rights, our Government \r\nsubmitted to the National Assembly a bill \r\nabolishing the death penalty. This law, adopted \r\nunanimously on 24 June, is the outcome of a \r\nconstitutional provision that requires the State to \r\nguarantee the physical and mental integrity, life \r\nand security of all persons living on our national \r\nterritory. \r\n  “The efforts undertaken by the Government \r\nin the areas of health, education and employment, \r\nparticularly for young people, have also seen \r\nA/64/PV.13 \r\n \r\n09-53165 36 \r\n \r\nconsiderable progress. In the field of health, we \r\nhave established a national health development \r\nplan for the years 2009 to 2013, at a cost of \r\n317 billion CFA francs, reflecting the will of the \r\nTogolese Government to respond effectively to \r\nour people’s health needs. With regard to \r\neducation, Togo’s educational system has suffered \r\nfrom the financial constraints afflicting the \r\ncountry for the past 15 years due to the \r\nsuspension of cooperation. This situation, \r\ncompounded by a high demand for education, has \r\nresulted in a decline in teaching conditions and \r\nserious structural problems. In the face of these \r\nconstraints, the Government has committed to \r\nestablish a sectoral education plan that will allow \r\nthe country to launch a fast-track initiative in \r\n2010 to ensure education for all. \r\n  “To put a new face on public administration \r\nand make it a genuine instrument for the \r\nreconstruction and modernization of our country, \r\nwe have undertaken broad reforms that require, \r\ninter alia, the recruitment of new officials. Thus, \r\nthousands of young people have found work in \r\nthe public and private sectors thanks to the \r\ncreation of better production conditions for the \r\neconomic and social development of the country.  \r\n  “With regard to the economic sector, \r\nappropriate measures have been taken to put \r\npublic finances on a sound footing, create a \r\nfavourable framework for business and attract \r\ninvestment, particularly from abroad. In this \r\ncontext, I take this opportunity to once again \r\nmake an urgent appeal to all our bilateral and \r\nmultilateral partners, particularly the European \r\nUnion and the Bretton Woods institutions, to help \r\nTogo in its efforts towards socio-economic \r\nrecovery. \r\n  “In the opinion of my delegation, the \r\ndevelopment and proliferation of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction represent a growing threat to \r\ninternational peace and security, and thus a reason \r\nfor us to give these questions the highest priority. \r\nIn this regard, my country welcomed the Security \r\nCouncil summit held on 24 September, under the \r\npresidency of the United States, on nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation and disarmament. While we \r\nreaffirm that multilateralism is the fundamental \r\nprinciple governing our consideration of \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation, Togo hopes \r\nthat the Security Council summit will lead to a \r\nnew approach to this crucial question. With regard \r\nto light arms, Togo reiterates its desire to see the \r\ncurrent session of the Assembly commit to \r\nstrengthening the implementation of the project \r\naimed at negotiating a treaty on the traffic in light \r\narms, as has been done by the Economic \r\nCommunity of West African States in this area. \r\n  “Concerning terrorism, an obstacle to peace \r\nand lasting development, my country feels that it \r\nhas become imperative to improve and globalize \r\nthe international legal framework in order to \r\ncombat this scourge, which has assumed a new \r\nform in modern times. In this regard, the \r\ncompletion within a reasonable time frame of \r\nnegotiations on a draft comprehensive convention \r\nagainst international terrorism would be salutary \r\nand in the interests of all.  \r\n  “Similarly, the phenomenon of drugs, and in \r\nparticular the illicit traffic in drugs along the west \r\ncoast of Africa, has become a true danger and a \r\ndestabilizing factor for the region. In light of the \r\nscale of this scourge, it is beyond a shadow of a \r\ndoubt that no country can combat or hope to put \r\nan end to it alone. Togo therefore appeals for \r\ninternational cooperation, and in particular for \r\nassistance from the wealthy countries and \r\ncompetent organizations, in eradicating this \r\nphenomenon and thereby restoring the climate of \r\nsecurity so essential to development. For its part, \r\nin spite of its scarce resources, Togo has \r\nundertaken a relentless struggle against drug \r\ntraffickers and is cooperating with its neighbours \r\nin order to contain the scourge. \r\n  “As we all know, international peace and \r\nsecurity continue to be threatened and the \r\nstability of certain countries disturbed by \r\nconflicts, terrorism and underdevelopment, all of \r\nwhich are largely man-made. Indeed, in the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Chad, the \r\nCentral African Republic and Darfur, where \r\ncrises continue, our Organization should continue \r\nto engage in a search for solutions that will allow \r\nthose countries to recover the peace and security \r\nnecessary to their development.  \r\n  “In Somalia, despite the initiatives \r\nundertaken in April 2009 by the international \r\ncommunity and by the African Union in July \r\n A/64/PV.13\r\n \r\n37 09-53165 \r\n \r\n2009 in support of security institutions and the \r\nAfrican Union Mission in Somalia, the situation \r\nremains precarious and disturbing. That is why \r\nmy country urgently appeals for other urgent \r\nmeasures to be taken to prevent that country from \r\nsuccumbing to chaos for good. \r\n  “Regarding Côte d’Ivoire, we note with \r\nsatisfaction the positive evolution of the political \r\nsituation in that country since the Ouagadougou \r\nPolitical Agreement. Consequently, we call on the \r\nstakeholders to display the political will to \r\norganize the presidential election. \r\n  “With regard to Guinea, it would seem \r\nappropriate and timely to encourage the political \r\nclass to find, through dialogue and consultation, \r\nways and means of ensuring a rapid return to \r\nconstitutional order. \r\n  “As to the situation in the Niger, where the \r\nrevision of the Constitution has provoked a crisis, \r\nmy country hopes that the parties concerned in \r\nthe Niger will strive to restore dialogue and \r\nconsensus in order to maintain a climate of peace \r\nand harmony in that sister country. \r\n  “Outside the African continent, in the \r\nMiddle East, a theatre of violence and desolation, \r\nan equitable and final settlement of the conflicts \r\nbetween the countries of this region should be \r\nfound as soon as possible. To that end, the \r\ninternational community should encourage the \r\nvarious actors to find a peaceful solution to their \r\nconflicts. In this regard, my delegation reaffirms \r\nthat the solution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict \r\nrequires the creation of a Palestinian State living \r\nside by side with the State of Israel within secure \r\nand internationally recognized borders.  \r\n  “Furthermore, my country deplores the \r\ncontinuing acts of terrorism that have afflicted \r\nthe peoples of Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan and \r\nundermined the efforts of these countries to \r\npromote development. That is why we urge the \r\ninternational community to increase its assistance \r\nto the Governments of those countries in their \r\nfight against terrorism in order to promote peace \r\nand reconstruction.  \r\n  “After two decades of economic stagnation \r\nresulting from policies of budgetary austerity \r\nimposed on developing countries, the latter are \r\nnow facing new challenges from the food, \r\nfinancial, energy and environmental crises. In the \r\nlight of this situation, it is imperative to work to \r\nmitigate the financial shock and to pursue bold \r\npolicies to increase the agricultural and energy \r\nproduction capacities of the developing countries. \r\nAt the same time, we need to consider overall \r\nstructural reform of the world economic and \r\nfinancial system in order to prevent a resurgence \r\nof such crises.  \r\n  “My country therefore welcomed the high-\r\nlevel Conference on the World Financial and \r\nEconomic Crisis and Its Impact on Development, \r\nheld from 24 to 26 June, which illustrated the \r\nneed for international solidarity in the face of the \r\ncrisis in order to ease the suffering of the peoples \r\nof developing countries. \r\n  “In that context, Togo welcomes the early \r\nimplementation, in April 2009, of one of the \r\npledges made at the G-20 meeting in London, \r\nconcerning the establishment of the Global Trade \r\nLiquidity Programme amounting to $50 billion \r\nfrom 2009 to 2011, $15 billion of which are \r\nallocated to the African continent. Similarly, my \r\ncountry welcomes the initiative taken in March \r\n2009 by the African Development Bank to create \r\na special $500 million funding mechanism for \r\nAfrican trade. \r\n  “Furthermore, my delegation is pleased that \r\nthe United Nations, at the initiative of the \r\nSecretary-General, has taken the measure of the \r\ndanger posed to humanity by the problem of \r\nclimate change and the degradation of the \r\nenvironment. In this regard, the high-level \r\nmeeting that took place a few days ago in this \r\nvery body was an opportunity to analyse the \r\nsituation and to clear the way for the Climate \r\nChange Conference in Copenhagen in December. \r\nTo paraphrase a great man, we have inherited the \r\nEarth and we should not destroy it. Living \r\ncreatures come and go, but the Earth remains.  \r\n  “In the face of the questions that my \r\ndelegation has just raised, it is imperative to \r\nintensify partnerships of all kinds if we wish to \r\nprevent a situation in which, 64 years after its \r\ncreation, our shared Organization should find \r\nitself still facing the same challenges. It is to be \r\nhoped, therefore, that Member States, in whose \r\nA/64/PV.13 \r\n \r\n09-53165 38 \r\n \r\ninterest it is that the United Nations should be \r\nmore democratic, strong and effective, should \r\ndetermine to give it the resources necessary to \r\npermit it to achieve the Millennium Development \r\nGoals and thereby to meet the challenges that our \r\nworld faces today.”  \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Oumar Daou, chairman of \r\nthe delegation of the Republic of Mali. \r\n Mr. Daou (Mali) (spoke in French): At the outset, \r\nSir, it is a pleasure for Mali to congratulate you on \r\nyour election as President of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-fourth session and on your outstanding \r\nmanagement of our work. The trust placed in you does \r\nhonour to the whole of Africa and is a brilliant tribute \r\nto the great Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and its leader, \r\nwhose commitment to African unity and just causes is \r\nacknowledged by all. I assure you of our full support in \r\nyour new responsibilities and congratulate your \r\npredecessor, Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann of \r\nNicaragua, on his excellent work throughout his \r\nmandate. \r\n I also congratulate Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon on his strenuous efforts to strengthen the role \r\nof our Organization, and reaffirm our desire for his \r\nsuccess in his assigned missions.  \r\n The current general debate is a timely opportunity \r\nfor us to consider together the urgent problems facing \r\nthe international community, to share our worries and \r\nconcerns about the challenges that affect the world, and \r\nto find sustainable solutions pursuant to the heartfelt \r\naspirations of our peoples.  \r\n While the financial and economic crisis that burst \r\nonto the scene last year has spared no country, it \r\nundoubtedly weakened the economies of the \r\ndeveloping countries, especially in Africa, a continent \r\nthat has long been marginalized. Fluctuations in food \r\nand oil prices have decreased revenues and exacerbated \r\ninflation in many developing countries. \r\n The current multifaceted crises in the realms of \r\nfinance, food, energy and the environment have \r\nplunged hundreds of millions of people into poverty \r\nand aggravated circumstances already straitened by \r\nunemployment and the high cost of access to basic \r\nservices. The plight of the most vulnerable strata of \r\nsociety in developing countries, especially women and \r\nchildren, calls for action by the international \r\ncommunity and should be at the heart of international \r\nconcerns. \r\n Even as this year we celebrate the twentieth \r\nanniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the \r\nChild, hundreds of millions of children still live at risk \r\nand in extreme poverty. More than 26,000 children \r\nunder the age of five die each day in developing \r\ncountries of diseases that for the most part could have \r\nbeen avoided if adequate resources had been mobilized \r\nand effective measures put in place to respond to \r\nimmediate needs.  \r\n The breadth and complexity of the challenges that \r\nmust be met cannot distract the international \r\ncommunity from its responsibilities. It goes without \r\nsaying that the resolution of the world financial and \r\neconomic crisis requires a democratization of the \r\ninternational monetary system, notably the institution \r\nof a new international financial architecture based on \r\nthe genuine participation of all nations, including \r\ndeveloping countries. Only a global and cooperative \r\neffort will succeed in laying the groundwork for a \r\nlasting recovery. It is also essential to strengthen global \r\ndevelopment partnerships in order to create conditions \r\nfavourable for the reduction of poverty, the \r\nimprovement of health and education, gender equality \r\nand environmental protection, as set out in the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\n In this regard, the Government of Mali has \r\nlaunched an innovative project to focus the MDGs on \r\nthe 166 Malian municipal districts most vulnerable to \r\nfood shortages. That initiative, inspired by the \r\nMillennium Village approach, is part of the economic \r\nand social development project instituted by the \r\nPresident of the Republic, His Excellency Mr. Amadou \r\nToumani Touré. The project’s principal aim is \r\n “to assure robust and sustainable growth that \r\nproduces opportunities and prosperity for all \r\ncitizens; to open the way to the achievement of \r\nthe MDGs by 2015, thus allowing all Malians to \r\nenjoy the fundamental rights of all human beings \r\nto have enough to eat, to have access to potable \r\nwater, to enjoy basic services within a radius of \r\nfive kilometres and to send their children, both \r\nboys and girls, to primary school; and to create \r\ngood working conditions for the majority of the \r\ncountry’s young people”. \r\n As part of that initiative, the Forum on Initiative \r\n166, organized by the Malian Government in the \r\n A/64/PV.13\r\n \r\n39 09-53165 \r\n \r\nmargins of this session of the General Assembly, has \r\nincreased awareness among development partners and \r\ndonors alike of the need to support the efforts of the \r\nmore than 2.5 million people living in nearly 3,000 \r\nvillages in the 166 districts to raise themselves out of \r\nextreme poverty and launch their own social and \r\neconomic development process. \r\n Despite the progress made in developing \r\ncountries with regard to the MDGs, the 2015 deadline \r\nlooms on the horizon and much remains to do. We dare \r\nbelieve that the pledges made by the industrialized \r\ncountries, notably at the Group of 20 summits held in \r\nWashington, D.C., London and Pittsburgh, will be \r\nhonoured.  \r\n We also urge donor nations, international \r\nfinancial institutions and development organizations to \r\ngive full attention to the special circumstances of the \r\ngroup of landlocked developing nations. Given their \r\nlack of access to oceans, their isolation and their \r\nremoval from international markets, those countries \r\nface great difficulties in their endeavours to ensure \r\ntheir economic growth and social well-being and to \r\nparticipate in the global economy and international \r\ncommerce. We remain convinced that pushing forward \r\nthe implementation of the Almaty Programme of \r\nAction for landlocked countries will greatly contribute \r\nto the realization of the goals identified. \r\n Climate change remains one of the greatest \r\nchallenges of the day. We welcome the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s initiative to convene a summit devoted \r\nexclusively to climate change and environmental \r\ndegradation. We believe that the international \r\ncommunity must intensify its efforts to reach an \r\ninternational accord at the Conference in Copenhagen \r\nthis December. \r\n The maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity is a prerequisite for all development. That is \r\nwhy Mali remains firmly devoted to the ideals of peace \r\nand stability both inside and outside its borders. In that \r\nspirit and at the initiative of the President of Mali, a \r\nregional conference will shortly be convened in \r\nBamako on peace, security and development in the \r\nSahelo-Saharan region. Our most ardent wish is to \r\ntransform that area into a haven of peace, stability and \r\nprosperity. \r\n Mali welcomes the progress made in Africa in \r\nrestoring peace, stability and post-conflict \r\nreconciliation under the auspices of the African Union \r\nand the United Nations. We reaffirm our active \r\nsolidarity with the peoples of the Middle East and will \r\ncontinue to support the relevant United Nations \r\nresolutions on the Middle East and the Palestinian \r\nquestion.  \r\n International terrorism is yet another serious \r\nthreat to international peace and security. Mali \r\ntherefore firmly and unequivocally condemns terrorism \r\nin all its forms and manifestations, and applauds the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s adoption of the Global Counter-\r\nTerrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288), as promoted by \r\nour heads of State and Government at the 2005 World \r\nSummit. \r\n Today more than ever, our nations must \r\ncoordinate their efforts to overcome together the great \r\nchallenges faced by humanity. The strengthening of \r\ninternational cooperation demands greater solidarity. \r\nThat is in the interest of us all, because humanity needs \r\nto harness all of its potential if it is to achieve \r\nharmonious and sustainable development in an \r\nenvironment of peace and security. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Charles Thembani \r\nNtwaagae, chairman of the delegation of the Republic \r\nof Botswana. \r\n Mr. Ntwaagae (Botswana): I congratulate you, \r\nSir, on your election as President of the General \r\nAssembly and on the very effective manner in which \r\nyou are presiding over its proceedings. I also pay \r\ntribute to your predecessor, Mr. D’Escoto Brockmann, \r\nfor his leadership and commitment and for the very \r\nable manner in which he guided us throughout the past \r\nsession. Under his leadership, a lot was achieved and \r\nwe also weathered a number of turbulent storms. \r\n The global economic environment has \r\nexperienced many challenges since our last session. \r\nNever before has our common goal of advancing the \r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter \r\nfor the betterment of all mankind been so tested. The \r\nchallenges confronting humanity have since grown \r\ntenfold, both in scope and magnitude. The sheer \r\nenormity of these fast-evolving challenges threatens \r\nthe very existence of the human race and the security \r\nof our planet. \r\n I am convinced that these challenges are neither \r\nbeyond our collective capability to address, nor are \r\nthey insurmountable. Our moral imperative is to ensure \r\nA/64/PV.13 \r\n \r\n09-53165 40 \r\n \r\nthat the United Nations has the requisite resources, the \r\ntools and the capability to respond to the ever-changing \r\nenvironment in a timely, effective and decisive manner \r\nin order to help Member States address the many \r\ncomplex and multidimensional challenges. \r\n It is important to remind ourselves of the decision \r\nwe adopted at the World Summit in 2005 to \r\n “strengthen the United Nations with a view to \r\nenhancing its authority and efficiency, as well as \r\nits capacity to address effectively … the full \r\nrange of challenges of our time”. (resolution 60/1, \r\npara. 146) \r\n In that respect, my delegation welcomes the \r\nprogress made in implementing ongoing reforms of the \r\nUnited Nations with a view to streamlining rules, \r\nmandates and policies in order to promote \r\ntransparency, coherence and efficiency in the system. \r\n The global economic crisis that has besieged us \r\nhas accentuated existing challenges and made them \r\nmore complex. The crisis has been felt more seriously \r\nin developing countries. Human, financial and other \r\nresources are severely overstretched as countries seek \r\ncreative and innovative ways to mitigate what has \r\nbecome the greatest economic threat of our time. The \r\ncrisis therefore warrants a concerted effort involving \r\nboth developed and developing countries. We should \r\nemerge from the crisis stronger and wiser, with new \r\nthinking about a new global financial architecture. \r\n In the present circumstances, poverty levels in \r\nmany economies appear to be spiraling out of control. \r\nOur poverty reduction strategies therefore need to be \r\nrevised to face the new challenges. That goes for the \r\ncommitments we signed on to at the 1995 Copenhagen \r\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development and at the \r\n2000 Millennium Summit. The new strategy should \r\nfocus on raising the living standards of all people the \r\nworld over. In dealing with those challenges, we \r\nshould deploy all the resources of nature and \r\ntechnology to better life on the planet. But in doing so \r\nwe should avoid any actions that could endanger the \r\nvery lives that we want to uplift. \r\n The devastating HIV/AIDS pandemic is among \r\nthe myriad challenges to which we committed \r\nourselves to tackle through international cooperation \r\nand assistance. HIV/AIDS undoubtedly continues to be \r\none of the most daunting challenges of our time. \r\n In June of last year, our leaders gathered in New \r\nYork for the midterm review of the implementation of \r\nthe goals and targets of the Declaration of Commitment \r\non HIV/AIDS, which was adopted in 2001. The review \r\nrevealed that, despite heightened political momentum \r\nand national and global responses to HIV/AIDS, not \r\nmuch progress had been made towards mitigating its \r\neffects. Only a handful of countries were reported to be \r\non track to achieving some of their commitments, \r\nwhile the majority of countries were found to be \r\nlagging far behind in implementing them. That \r\nsituation underscores the urgent need to accelerate the \r\nmomentum for universal access to HIV/AIDS \r\nprevention, treatment, care and support. \r\n The ongoing global economic crisis has already \r\nplaced people living with HIV/AIDS at great risk, as \r\nmany countries have had to cut down on some \r\nHIV/AIDS programmes due to budgetary constraints. \r\nBudget reductions in HIV/AIDS programmes, in \r\nparticular, in developing countries, will obviously \r\nresult in increased loss of life, as well as an increase in \r\nthe cost of health care in the future. \r\n We need to redouble our implementation efforts \r\nas we draw closer to the 2010 deadline for achieving \r\nthe goal of ensuring universal access to HIV/AIDS \r\nprevention, treatment, care and support. To that end, it \r\nis essential that as Governments we renew our \r\ncommitment to put our people first when it comes to \r\nthe kind of policies and programmes we formulate and \r\nimplement. \r\n The adverse impact of climate change and global \r\nwarming is another problem that requires our urgent \r\nand sustained attention. Our collective response to the \r\nchallenge of climate change and global warming \r\nnecessitates pragmatism and decisive action. History \r\nwill judge us harshly if we cannot muster the political \r\nwill and commitment to put in place measures required \r\nto save planet Earth. The Copenhagen meeting \r\nscheduled for December of this year provides an \r\nopportunity to galvanize the efforts of the international \r\ncommunity to address the challenges of climate \r\nchange. \r\n More important, the Copenhagen meeting will be \r\na defining moment in the negotiations on the global \r\ncommitments to be made with regard to the Kyoto \r\nProtocol after 2012. Botswana is strongly committed to \r\nthose negotiations. We will do everything in our power \r\nto ensure their successful and timely conclusion. We \r\n A/64/PV.13\r\n \r\n41 09-53165 \r\n \r\ntherefore call upon Member States to ensure that no \r\neffort is spared in giving the issues under negotiation \r\nthe priority attention that they deserve. \r\n Turning to international peace and security, my \r\ndelegation is deeply concerned about the deterioration \r\nof the global security situation. We are convinced that \r\nthe security of our world is dependent upon the entire \r\nmembership of the United Nations working in unison. \r\n The number and intensity of conflicts still raging \r\nin some parts of the world, in particular in Africa, is a \r\ncause for grave concern. It is sad that Africa appears — \r\nat least in my estimation — to have experienced more \r\nincidents of civil strife and violent confrontation than \r\nany other part of the world. In that regard, it is worth \r\nnoting that the Security Council remains seized of \r\nconflict situations and developments in a number of \r\nAfrican countries and regions, including Chad, the \r\nCentral African Republic, the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo, the Great Lakes region, Eritrea and \r\nEthiopia, Somalia and the Sudan, to name but a few. \r\n Somalia remains the most dangerous place in the \r\nworld, and a blemish on the conscience of the \r\ninternational community. Incidents of violence, \r\nkidnapping, banditry and piracy abound. Peacekeepers \r\nhave also not been spared that barbarity. We commend \r\nBurundi and Uganda for the courage and heroism of \r\ntheir troops in support of the peace effort. International \r\nsupport and assistance is urgently required to deploy a \r\nstabilization force to strengthen the African Union \r\nMission in Somalia and to support long-term peace and \r\nstability in that country. \r\n With regard to the situations in the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo and the Great Lakes region, it is \r\nthanks to the collective efforts of the United Nations \r\nOrganization Mission in the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo and former President Obasanjo of Nigeria, \r\nSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General for the \r\nGreat Lakes Region, as well as other international \r\ninitiatives, that there are now prospects for positive \r\ndevelopments. However, we should not underestimate \r\nthe gravity of the challenges that continue to hamper \r\nthe achievement of lasting peace, stability and \r\nsustainable development in that region and many more \r\nin Africa. \r\n Apart from finding lasting solutions to conflicts, \r\nwe should put in place measures to deal with post-\r\nconflict situations, as there is a danger that countries \r\nemerging from conflict could easily relapse into it. \r\nRegional bodies such as the African Union, as well as \r\nthe United Nations, must stay focused on assisting \r\ncountries to deal with both conflict and post-conflict \r\nsituations. \r\n We all know the causes of conflict and instability. \r\nThey are the result of bad governance, mismanagement \r\nof national resources and the absence of democracy. In \r\nthat respect, we cannot simply demand the full and \r\nactive support of the international community in efforts \r\nto achieve lasting peace and stability. We must do more \r\nto consolidate the democratic process, respect for \r\nhuman rights and the rule of law. In that way, we \r\nwould be more deserving and worthy of assistance. \r\n Botswana is disturbed by the emerging trend of \r\ncoups and of the unconstitutional transfer of power in \r\nAfrica and in other parts of the world. We had thought \r\nthat the era of military coups was now history. We \r\nunreservedly condemn the coups that took place in \r\nMauritania, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar and \r\nHonduras. We would have been very disappointed if \r\none such as Rajoelina, who masterminded the \r\noverthrow of a democratically elected Government in \r\nMadagascar, had been allowed to address this \r\nAssembly. We therefore applaud the decision taken by \r\nthe General Assembly in that regard.  \r\n The Southern Africa Development Community \r\ncorrectly decided to suspend the regime in Madagascar \r\nfrom participating in the councils and structures of the \r\nsubregional organization. Our continental organization, \r\nthe African Union, has also maintained a principled \r\nposition of automatically suspending any regime that \r\ncomes into power by overthrowing the constitutional \r\norder. The international community must be united in \r\nits determination to isolate the regime in Antananarivo. \r\nWe must not give it any comfort by embracing it in \r\ninternational forums. \r\n We are also witnessing a disturbing development \r\nthat undermines democracy and subverts the will of the \r\npeople. There is a growing resort to changing \r\nconstitutions in order to prolong the grip on power of \r\nleaders and political parties that have lost elections. In \r\nthat regard, Africa, and indeed the world at large, must \r\ncollectively and in one voice reject the extra-\r\nparliamentary transfer of power and isolate illegal \r\nregimes until constitutional order is restored. \r\nEmbracing them in any small measure would be \r\nimmoral and would perpetuate those hideous acts \r\nthroughout the globe. \r\nA/64/PV.13 \r\n \r\n09-53165 42 \r\n \r\n The world can be a better place for us and for \r\nfuture generations if we persistently nurture democratic \r\npractices, good governance and respect for the rule of \r\nlaw. As leaders, we should commit to building \r\nfraternity and greater mutual understanding among \r\npeoples across cultures and faiths. We have the \r\nresponsibility to lead by example. We must desist from \r\nusing inflammatory language that promotes tension and \r\nconflicts. \r\n We cannot and must not condone leaders who, for \r\ntheir own selfish interests, change the constitutions of \r\ntheir countries in order to ensure their continued stay in \r\npower. At the same time, we should ensure that our \r\nelections are credible and that they reflect the \r\nsovereign will of the people. Governments should not \r\nbe allowed to conduct elections and then tamper with \r\nthe outcomes in order to suit their interests. People \r\nmust be allowed to freely choose their leaders. \r\n Botswana reiterates its position that it is fully \r\ncommitted to respecting the integrity and impartiality \r\nof the International Criminal Court so that it can freely \r\ncarry out its judicial mandate. We equally support the \r\nprinciple of universal jurisdiction under international \r\nlaw and practice. However, we object to situations \r\nwherein its abuse becomes blatant. \r\n In conclusion, I wish to reiterate that the daunting \r\nchallenges facing our world today, as stated previously, \r\ncannot and should not be tackled by any one country or \r\nby a group of countries alone. They require a strong \r\nmultilateral approach that needs the commitment and \r\nunyielding support of the international community as a \r\nwhole. Let us join hands together in an effort to \r\naddress those complex challenges. Our timely, \r\ncoordinated and effective action will go a long way in \r\nsecuring a better future for generations to come. \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nArchbishop Celestino Migliore, chairman of the \r\ndelegation of the Observer State of the Holy See. \r\n Archbishop Migliore (Holy See): As you, Sir, \r\nassume the presidency of the General Assembly at this \r\nsixty-fourth session, my delegation wishes you all the \r\nbest in your endeavours and looks forward to working \r\nwith you to address the many challenges facing the \r\nglobal community. \r\n Every year, anticipation surrounds the General \r\nAssembly in the hope that Governments will be able to \r\nfind points of agreement on the persisting problems \r\nthat afflict humankind and to adopt a common \r\ndirection for resolving them in a peaceful manner for \r\nthe well-being of all. Understandably, the deliberations \r\nof the preceding session of the General Assembly were \r\ndominated by preoccupation with the world financial \r\nand economic crisis. It is only fitting that this year \r\ndelegations have been asked to focus on the theme \r\n“Effective responses to global crises: strengthening \r\nmultilateralism and dialogue among civilizations for \r\ninternational peace, security and development”. \r\n In view of a political and cultural dialogue \r\noriented towards the harmonious evolving of the world \r\neconomy and of international relations, we would do \r\nwell to revisit the Preamble of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, where it affirms that “We the peoples \r\nof the United Nations determined … to reaffirm faith \r\nin fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth \r\nof the human person, in the equal rights of men and \r\nwomen and of nations large and small”.  \r\n The various world crises that have intertwined in \r\nthe past months bring to the discussion presuppositions \r\nof thought and principles of individual, social and \r\ninternational behaviour that extend well beyond the \r\nfinancial or economic fields. The idea of producing \r\nresources and assets — which is the economy — and \r\nstrategically managing them — which is politics — \r\nwithout seeking together with the same actions to carry \r\nout also the good — which is ethics — has been proven \r\nto be a naive or cynical and fatal delusion. The more \r\nsolid and profound contribution that the General \r\nAssembly must make to the solution of international \r\nproblems lies in promoting the principles contained in \r\nthe Preamble and in Article 1 of the Charter of this \r\nOrganization in a manner that such high human and \r\nspiritual values serve to renovate the international \r\norder from within, where the real crisis lies. \r\n A first element of truth is found precisely in the \r\nphrase “We the peoples of the United Nations”. The \r\ntheme of peace and development, in fact, coincides \r\nwith that of the relational inclusion of all peoples in the \r\nunique community of the human family that is \r\nconstructed in solidarity. Evident in the various Group \r\nof Eight, Group of 20, regional and international \r\nmeetings, held in parallel with the work of the \r\npreceding General Assembly, was the necessity to give \r\nlegitimacy to the political commitments assumed and \r\nto confront them with the thoughts and needs of the \r\nentire international community so that the solutions \r\ndevised would reflect the points of view and the \r\n A/64/PV.13\r\n \r\n43 09-53165 \r\n \r\nexpectations of the populations of all continents. That \r\nis why efficacious modes must be found to connect the \r\ndecisions of the various groupings of countries to those \r\nof the United Nations, where every nation, with its \r\npolitical and economic weight, can legitimately explain \r\nitself in a situation of equality with others. \r\n It is in that context of truth and sincerity that the \r\nrecent appeal of Pope Benedict XVI can be seen in \r\nperspective. As he notes in his encyclical “Charity in \r\nTruth”, in the face of the unrelenting growth of global \r\ninterdependence there is a strongly felt need, even in \r\nthe midst of a global recession, for an urgent reform of \r\nthe United Nations, and likewise of economic \r\ninstitutions and international finance, so that the \r\nconcept of the family of nations can acquire real teeth. \r\nSuch reform is urgent in order to find innovative ways \r\nof implementing the principles of the responsibility to \r\nprotect and of giving poorer nations an effective voice \r\nin shared decision-making. \r\n Admittedly, building the United Nations as a true \r\ncentre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the \r\nattainment of those common ends is an extremely \r\ndifficult task. The more the interdependence of peoples \r\nincreases, the more the necessity of the United Nations \r\nbecomes evident. The need to have an organization \r\ncapable of responding to the obstacles and increasing \r\ncomplexity of the relations between peoples and \r\nnations thus becomes paramount. \r\n As we consider the nature of development and the \r\nrole of donor and recipient countries, we must always \r\nremember that true development necessarily involves \r\nan integral respect for human life, which cannot be \r\ndisconnected from the development of peoples. \r\nUnfortunately, in some parts of the world today, \r\ndevelopment aid seems to be tied rather to the recipient \r\ncountries’ willingness to adopt programmes that \r\ndiscourage demographic growth by methods and \r\npractices disrespectful of human rights and dignity. \r\n In that regard, it is both cynical and unfortunate \r\nthat frequent attempts continue to be made to export \r\nsuch a mentality to developing countries, as if it were a \r\nform of cultural progress or advancement. Yet such a \r\npractice is by its nature not one of reciprocity but \r\nimposition, and to predicate the decision to give \r\ndevelopment aid on the acceptance of such policies \r\nconstitutes an abuse of power. \r\n Every human being has the right to good \r\ngovernance, that is, the right to participate in all social \r\nactions, at the national and international level, whether \r\ndirectly or indirectly, as a guarantee for all persons a \r\nfree and dignified life. At the same time, it is an \r\nessential part of that dignity that everyone takes \r\nresponsibility for his actions and actively respects the \r\ndignity of others. \r\n Rights always exist inseparably from \r\nresponsibilities and duties. This applies to individual \r\nmen and women and, by analogy, to States, whose true \r\nprogress and affirmation depends on their capacity to \r\nestablish and maintain responsible relations with other \r\nStates and to express a shared responsibility for world \r\nproblems. \r\n The implementation of the principle of the \r\nresponsibility to protect, as formulated at the 2005 \r\nWorld Summit and approved by the unanimous \r\nconsensus of all United Nations Member States, \r\nbecomes a touchstone of the two enunciated principles \r\nof truth in international relations and of global \r\ngovernance. \r\n The recognition of the core objective and \r\nindispensability of the dignity of every man and \r\nwoman ensures that Governments always undertake \r\nwith every means at their disposal to prevent and \r\ncombat crimes of genocide, ethnic cleansing and any \r\nother crimes against humanity. Thus, by recognizing \r\ntheir interconnected responsibility to protect States will \r\nrealize the importance of accepting the collaboration of \r\nthe international community as a means of fulfilling \r\ntheir role of providing responsible sovereignty. \r\n The mechanisms of the United Nations for \r\naddressing common security and the prevention of \r\nconflicts were developed in response to the threat of \r\ntotal war and nuclear destruction in the second half of \r\nthe last century, and for this reason alone they deserve \r\nperennial historical remembrance. Moreover, the work \r\nof peacekeepers have stabilized and ended innumerable \r\nlocal conflicts and have made related reconstruction \r\npossible. \r\n Nevertheless, it is well known that the number of \r\nconflicts that the United Nations has not been able to \r\nresolve remains high and that many of them have \r\nbecome occasions of serious crimes against humanity. \r\nThat is why the acceptance of the principle of the \r\nresponsibility to protect and of the underlying truths \r\nthat guide responsible sovereignty can be the catalyst \r\nfor the reform of the mechanisms, procedures and \r\nrepresentativeness of the Security Council. \r\nA/64/PV.13 \r\n \r\n09-53165 44 \r\n \r\n In this context, my delegation would like to recall \r\nhere the Honduran people, who continue to suffer \r\nfrustration and hardship from the already too long \r\npolitical upheaval. Once more, the Holy See urges the \r\nparties concerned to make every effort to find a prompt \r\nsolution in view of the good of the people of Honduras. \r\n This session of the General Assembly began with \r\nthe special Summit on Climate Change, and in \r\nDecember there will be the Copenhagen Climate \r\nConference. The protection of the environment \r\ncontinues to be at the forefront of multilateral \r\nactivities, because it involves, in consistent form, the \r\ndestiny of all the nations and the future of every \r\nindividual man and woman. \r\n Recognition of the double truths of \r\ninterdependence and personal dignity also requires that \r\nenvironmental issues are taken as a moral imperative \r\nand translated into legal rules, capable of protecting \r\nour planet and ensuring future generations a healthy \r\nand safe environment. \r\n In closing, I would like to say that in these \r\nchanging times the international community — “we, \r\nthe peoples” — has the unique chance and \r\nresponsibility to ensure full implementation of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter and thus greater peace and \r\nunderstanding among nations. \r\n The President: We have two requests for the \r\nexercise of the right of reply. I would like to remind \r\nMembers that statements in the exercise of the right of \r\nreply are limited to 10 minutes for the first statement \r\nand five for the second one. \r\n Mr. Giorgio (Eritrea): I am grateful for the \r\nopportunity to make a statement in exercise of the right \r\nof reply in connection to the statement made by the \r\ndistinguished representative of Djibouti. \r\n The Government of Djibouti has been engaged in \r\na public campaign against Eritrea for quite some time. \r\nThat has continued today in the statement made by the \r\ndistinguished representative of Djibouti in his address \r\nto this Assembly. \r\n When those allegations were initially made, \r\nEritrea chose not to respond through a similar intensive \r\ndiplomatic and media campaign, simply because \r\nEritrea did not want to fall into the trap of escalating a \r\ncrisis created by others as part and parcel of the \r\nmisguided and destabilizing policies and acts found in \r\nthe Horn of Africa. \r\n It is strange to subject a Member State to \r\ncondemnation on the basis of incomplete and one-sided \r\ninformation, and then request the United Nations \r\nSecretary-General to send a United Nations fact-\r\nfinding mission. \r\n It raises serious concerns when we see that it has \r\nbecome a common practice to embroil countries in \r\nendless crises, only in order to control regions by \r\n“managing these crises”. What is unfortunate about \r\nthat state of affairs is that they represent attempts to \r\npressure and use the United Nations to exacerbate \r\nconflicts by the same actors who fomented it in the \r\nfirst place. There are numerous contemporary crises \r\nthat illustrate this trend, among which is, of course, the \r\n“conflict” that is being instigated between Djibouti and \r\nEritrea. \r\n On 10 June 2008, Djibouti went, unfortunately, \r\nbeyond diplomatic and media hate campaigns to launch \r\nan unprovoked attack on one of our units on the border. \r\nIn spite of that unwanted and unnecessary \r\ndevelopment, it is important to note that through \r\npatience and restraint, Eritrea has been able to forestall \r\nand contain the transparent ploy. \r\n Eritrea’s desire remains the restoration and \r\ncultivation of good-neighbourly relations with Djibouti \r\non the basis of each side’s full respect of the territorial \r\nintegrity and sovereignty of the other. \r\n The way forward is for Djibouti to desist from \r\nallowing Mount Musa Ali to be occupied and used by \r\ntroops hostile to Eritrea. Eritrea does not have any \r\nterritorial ambition and has not occupied any land that \r\nbelongs to Djibouti. \r\n Miss Hassan (Djibouti) (spoke in French): Thank \r\nyou, Mr. President, for allowing my delegation to \r\nexercise its right of reply in response to the statement \r\nmade by the delegation of Eritrea. The statement that \r\nthe members of the Assembly just heard was an \r\nexpression of denial and defiance towards the \r\ninternational community, as described earlier by our \r\nhead of delegation, Mr. Roble Olhaye, in his statement \r\nto the Assembly this morning (see A/64/PV.12).  \r\n Without wishing to become involved in a sterile \r\nand futile discussion, my delegation simply wishes to \r\nrefer to concrete facts that various regional and \r\ninternational organizations were able to observe during \r\ntheir fact-finding missions, carried out since the \r\nbeginning of the crisis between my country and Eritrea. \r\n A/64/PV.13\r\n \r\n45 09-53165 \r\n \r\nThe conclusions of the United Nations fact-finding \r\nmission — to mention just one — are unequivocal. \r\nEritrea has rejected all mediation and cooperation \r\ninitiatives aimed at resolving this crisis. In addition, \r\nthe adoption on 14 January 2009 of Security Council \r\nresolution 1862 (2009), which very clearly condemned \r\nEritrea’s occupation of Ras Doumeira and Doumeira \r\nIsland and demanded that it withdraw its military \r\nforces to restore the status quo ante, acknowledge its \r\nborder dispute with Djibouti, engage actively in \r\ndialogue to diplomatically resolve the conflict and \r\nabide by its obligations as a United Nations Member, \r\nshows that the members of the Security Council were \r\nfully aware of the scope of the problem and of the lack \r\nof cooperation on Eritrea’s part.  \r\n Moreover, I wish to recall that Eritrea \r\ndistinguishes itself in our region by the fact that, since \r\nits independence, it has been the source of numerous \r\nmilitary aggressions towards several countries in the \r\nregion, including Yemen, the Sudan and Ethiopia. The \r\nlatest deadly provocation was the attack perpetrated \r\nagainst my country on 10 June 2008. Since then, we \r\nhave spared no effort to resolve this crisis through \r\ndialogue, in vain.  \r\n There is a very simple fact that cannot escape \r\neven Eritrea: for dialogue, there must be two parties. \r\nThe denial and distortion of facts cannot be an \r\nacceptable or conceivable response when one claims to \r\nbe a responsible United Nations Member. My country \r\nhas always been and remains convinced that States \r\nMembers of the United Nations cannot take shortcuts \r\nregarding international law, nor can they be allowed to \r\nscorn it. Thus, it is high time that resolution 1862 \r\n(2009) be implemented. \r\n Mr. Giorgio (Eritrea): Let me take this \r\nopportunity to offer some clarifications.  \r\n Security Council resolution 1862 (2009) and the \r\nrelevant presidential statements preceding it were \r\nadopted before the facts on the ground had been \r\nascertained. As the conflict erupted, there was a desire \r\nat the highest level on the Eritrean side to address the \r\nmatter quietly. That approach was accepted by Djibouti \r\nat the highest level, only to be later abandoned and \r\ninternationalized for reasons that are best known to \r\nDjibouti. \r\n Even now, Eritrea still wishes the restoration and \r\ncultivation of good-neighbourly relations with Djibouti \r\non the basis of full mutual respect for each other’s \r\nterritorial integrity and authority.  \r\n Miss Hassan (Djibouti) (spoke in French): I am \r\ntaking the floor to respond to the statement just made \r\nby the representative of Eritrea.  \r\n As I just said in my previous statement, in no way \r\ndo I wish to get the Assembly involved in an argument \r\ntoday. The facts speak for themselves. I should just like \r\nto recall that available United Nations documents \r\nprove what I just stated: that the United Nations fact-\r\nfinding mission concluded that there was good \r\ncooperation on Djibouti’s part and a lack of \r\ncooperation and total rejection of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s good offices on Eritrea’s part.  \r\n Furthermore, I am very pleased to hear that the \r\nEritrean delegation is speaking of calm and good-\r\nneighbourly relations. I think that perhaps that is the \r\nbeginning of a change in position, which is desirable. \r\nThat is why I should like the Members of the General \r\nAssembly to refer to the report of the fact-finding \r\nmission (S/2008/602), which is an official United \r\nNations document.  \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): We have heard \r\nthe last speaker in exercise of the right of reply. \r\n As we are now approaching the conclusion of the \r\ngeneral debate, I should like to make a brief statement. \r\n \r\nStatement by the President \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The general \r\ndebate of the General Assembly has now concluded. \r\nOn behalf of the Assembly, I thank all speakers for \r\ntheir statements. I have listened carefully to their views \r\nand suggestions. The breadth and depth of their vision, \r\nas well as the passion of their convictions, are genuine \r\ntestimony to the importance of this universal body. \r\n I had suggested, at the beginning of the session, \r\nthat we reflect on “Effective responses to global \r\ncrises — strengthening multilateralism and dialogue \r\namong civilizations for international peace, security \r\nand development” as the main theme for this debate. I \r\nwelcome the fact that that topic has served as a catalyst \r\nfor important policy discussion. Throughout our \r\ndebate, we have heard a clear call for dialogue and \r\nhave seen a willingness to work side by side.  \r\n It is obvious that the greatest challenges facing us \r\ntoday span the entire globe and cannot be resolved by a \r\nA/64/PV.13 \r\n \r\n09-53165 46 \r\n \r\nsingle country, small group or region. Our increasing \r\ninterdependence calls for concerted and united \r\nresponses to those challenges based on common \r\nunderstanding, close international cooperation and \r\nshared responsibilities. I welcome a new era of \r\nengagement based on mutual interests, mutual respect \r\nand a more just and democratic world order in which \r\nsovereign Member States participate on an equal \r\nfooting.  \r\n The vision of nations uniting to face common \r\nchallenges lies at the heart of the United Nations. I am \r\nencouraged by the fact that, both inside and outside \r\nthis Hall and at various meetings and events held on \r\nthe sidelines of this debate, we have seen a renewed \r\ncommitment to the promotion of effective and \r\ninclusive multilateralism.  \r\n I shall work with all Member States to advance \r\nthat objective. In that context, we must ensure full \r\nparticipation and ownership on the part of everyone \r\nand, in particular, take into account the interests of the \r\ndeveloping world, which comprises the vast majority \r\nof small- and medium-sized States.  \r\n There were also clear calls to promote greater \r\ncoherence and understanding among regional and \r\npolitical groupings as well as dialogue among faiths, \r\ncultures and civilizations. I believe that we need to \r\nadopt this path in order to fully tap the opportunities \r\nthat present themselves to address the global \r\nchallenges collectively and more effectively. The \r\nGeneral Assembly is uniquely placed to synergize our \r\nefforts in that regard and to forge collective strategies \r\nfor the common good.  \r\n There is a widely shared concern about the \r\nimpact of climate change on our planet and our present \r\nand future generations. We have heard powerful \r\ntestimony from small island States, whose very \r\nsurvival is threatened. But no country will be spared \r\nthe impact of climate change. Climate change is a \r\ngrowing global threat which will have consequences \r\nfor the global economy, health and safety, food \r\nproduction, peace and security and the realization of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The \r\npoorest nations, which often contribute the least to the \r\nphenomenon, are the most vulnerable to climate \r\nchange. \r\n There is a readiness by Member States to agree \r\non a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and to \r\nmake the upcoming United Nations Climate Change \r\nConference in Copenhagen a success. We must now \r\nmaintain this momentum. \r\n I have heard calls for more collective action to \r\nprevent conflicts and settle disputes that threaten \r\ninternational peace and security. In some areas we have \r\ntaken small but concrete steps towards sustainable \r\npolitical solutions, as in Afghanistan, Cyprus, Haiti, \r\nIraq, Liberia and Timor-Leste, but much more needs to \r\nbe done, particularly in Africa, including in the Sudan \r\nand the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I have also \r\nnoted members’ concerns about unresolved conflicts \r\nthat require our urgent attention. \r\n Of utmost concern to the international community \r\nis the situation in the Middle East, particularly the \r\nlong-standing issue of Palestine, the core of the Arab-\r\nIsraeli conflict. The situation is unsustainable, \r\nparticularly the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. I am \r\nencouraged by the efforts of the President of the United \r\nStates to promote a just, lasting and comprehensive \r\nsolution to the conflict in the Middle East. This entails \r\nfull backing of the international community and a more \r\neffective role of the United Nations. \r\n The United Nations has unique legitimacy to play \r\nan active role in international peace and security. There \r\nhas been broad support for the United Nations role in \r\npeacekeeping, peacebuilding, conflict prevention, \r\nmediation and protection of civilians. \r\n Disarmament remains a clear priority for Member \r\nStates. There is also widely shared concern about the \r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, as a \r\nthreat to international peace and security. We have \r\nheard passionate and progressive calls for a world free \r\nof nuclear arms. I am encouraged by the willingness of \r\nMember States to engage constructively with respect to \r\nthe Review Conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \r\nTreaty. Let us all work together to ensure equal \r\nsecurity for all. \r\n Member States were unanimous in their view that \r\npeace and security was intricately linked to sustainable \r\ndevelopment. There is broad agreement on the need for \r\na collective response to the unprecedented global \r\nfinancial crisis. People in developing countries have \r\nbeen hit particularly hard by the financial and \r\neconomic crisis, which has exacerbated unemployment, \r\npoverty, hunger and insecurity. I have noted the \r\nsuggestions for strengthening the international \r\neconomic system, including the Bretton Woods \r\ninstitutions, with a view to making them more \r\n A/64/PV.13\r\n \r\n47 09-53165 \r\n \r\ninclusive, transparent and democratic in their decision-\r\nmaking. \r\n We will continue the follow-up to the high-level \r\nConference on the World Economic and Financial \r\nCrisis and Its Impact on Development. We must not \r\nallow the Millennium Development Goals to become \r\nthe prime victim of the financial crisis. As was rightly \r\nnoted, at the current rate it will take more than \r\n100 years to achieve the MDGs. Drastic measures are \r\ntherefore needed. Next year, the tenth anniversary of \r\nthe Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) will \r\nprovide us with the opportunity to reinvigorate the \r\nglobal partnership to make the MDG’s a reality. I look \r\nforward to the cooperation and support of all for the \r\nsuccess of the September 2010 high-level event. \r\n Some five years after 2005 World Summit, our \r\njoint endeavour to reform the United Nations continues \r\nenergetically. I have heard urgent calls for reforming \r\nthe Security Council comprehensively, making it more \r\nrepresentative, democratic and open and, hence, more \r\nlegitimate. Many members have also emphasized the \r\nneed to begin the review of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission and the Human Rights Council and to \r\ncontinue the process of revitalizing the General \r\nAssembly. We shall pursue all these objectives \r\ntogether. \r\n Through multilateralism and dialogue, we can \r\ncollectively achieve all these goals. We will need to \r\nwork efficiently, with civility, discipline and a \r\nreadiness to compromise for the greater good. I want to \r\nassure all present that I intend to conduct this work \r\nwith transparency, fairness and respect for the General \r\nAssembly’s central and crucial role in the United \r\nNations. \r\n I look forward to working with all members in \r\nthis spirit as we face our common challenges. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n May I take it that it is the wish of the General \r\nAssembly to conclude its consideration of agenda item 8?  \r\n It was so decided. \r\n \r\nOrganization of work \r\n \r\n The President: Before adjourning the meeting, I \r\nwould like to draw the attention of the General \r\nAssembly to document A/INF/64/3, which has been \r\ndistributed desk to desk. It contains the programme of \r\nwork of the Assembly and the schedule of plenary \r\nmeetings for the period from October to December \r\n2009. I would also like to inform Members that the \r\nlists of speakers for items listed in document \r\nA/INF/64/3 are now open. \r\nThe meeting rose at 1.50 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\n"
