(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m. \r\n  \r\nNatural disasters in Indonesia, the Philippines \r\nand Samoa \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): Before \r\nproceeding to the items on our agenda for this \r\nmorning, I should like, on behalf of all the members of \r\nthe General Assembly, to extend our deepest \r\nsympathies to the Governments and the peoples of \r\nIndonesia, the Philippines and Samoa for the tragic loss \r\nof life and material damage that have resulted from the \r\nrecent natural disasters. \r\n May I also express the hope that the international \r\ncommunity will show its solidarity and respond \r\npromptly and generously to any requests for assistance.  \r\n \r\nAgenda item 107 (continued) \r\n \r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of the \r\nOrganization (A/64/1) \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): Members will \r\nrecall that the Secretary-General presented his annual \r\nreport (A/64/1) to the General Assembly at its 3rd \r\nplenary meeting, on 23 September 2009. \r\n Mr. Lidén (Sweden): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of the European Union (EU). Croatia, the \r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Albania, \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Serbia, \r\nArmenia, the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine align \r\nthemselves with this statement. \r\n I wish to thank the Secretary-General for his \r\nreport (A/64/1) on the work of the Organization. \r\n The European Union would like to reconfirm its \r\ncommitment to facing the multiple challenges before \r\nus through effective multilateralism. We need the \r\nbroad-based legitimacy of the United Nations to \r\nunderpin international actions and norms and to \r\ncoordinate our efforts. The United Nations, for its part, \r\nwill have to adapt to remain relevant and to be able to \r\naddress the issues before us. \r\n Climate change has proven to be one of the \r\ngreatest challenges of our generation, and 2009 is a \r\ncritical year. It is also a year of hope and opportunity. \r\nThe European Union will go to Copenhagen in \r\nDecember determined to reach a comprehensive, fair \r\nand ambitious global climate agreement. On scientific \r\ngrounds, global temperature rise must be kept below \r\n2 degrees Celsius. To secure this target, global \r\nemissions need to be reduced by at least 50 per cent by \r\n2050. This is possible, and requires all countries to \r\ncontribute and cooperate. Developed countries must \r\ntake the lead in reducing emissions. The European \r\nUnion commitments stand firm. The EU is also \r\nprepared to contribute our fair share of financing and \r\nsupport to developing countries’ mitigation and \r\nadaptation efforts. \r\n The European Union appreciates the leadership of \r\nthe Secretary-General and commends his initiative to \r\norganize a Summit on Climate Change, where world \r\nleaders showed unanimous determination to seal an \r\nambitious deal in Copenhagen.  \r\nA/64/PV.14  \r\n \r\n09-54337 2 \r\n \r\n By bringing development actors around the world \r\ntogether to work towards the same goals, the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) play a unique \r\ncatalytic role in driving development progress. The \r\nEuropean Union is very encouraged by the reports of \r\nconcrete progress on the MDG regarding HIV/AIDS, \r\nmalaria and tuberculosis. On the other hand, we are \r\ndeeply concerned about the setbacks in many other \r\nareas, with MDG 5 on maternal mortality, sadly, \r\nstanding out. \r\n The year 2015 is fast approaching. In order to \r\nachieve the MDGs, we need to step up all efforts — \r\nnational and international, regional and private, \r\ngovernmental and non-governmental, in the North and \r\nin the South. The role of the United Nations in \r\ndevelopment is pivotal, and the European Union will \r\ncontinue to support its work. \r\n The United Nations is in a unique position to \r\npursue good offices efforts in preventive diplomacy \r\naround the world. We support the continued \r\nstrengthening of United Nations capacity in this field, \r\nincluding through the Mediation Support Unit. The \r\nEuropean Union is building up a similar capacity and \r\nlooks forward to close cooperation with the United \r\nNations and regional organizations. \r\n Furthermore, the EU supports the objectives of \r\nthe Alliance of Civilizations initiative in order to \r\ncontribute to mutual understanding among nations. \r\n United Nations peacekeeping is at a critical \r\njuncture. The paper entitled “A New Partnership \r\nAgenda: Charting a New Horizon for UN \r\nPeacekeeping” provides a basis for a strategic \r\nreflection about the role and capacity of the United \r\nNations in the field of peacekeeping. As the Secretary-\r\nGeneral points out in his report, the challenges that \r\nface the peacekeepers of today are unprecedented in \r\nscale, complexity and risk level. It is therefore crucial \r\nthat the process of forming partnerships and sharing \r\nthe burden continue with a view to finding the best \r\ncollective responses to global and regional conflicts. \r\nThe EU is committed to a strong and close partnership \r\nwith the United Nations in peacekeeping. We continue \r\nto be involved in both United Nations-led and United \r\nNations-mandated peacekeeping operations. EU \r\nmember States contribute nearly 40 per cent of the \r\npeacekeeping budget. The recent transfer of \r\nresponsibilities between the two organizations in Chad \r\nand in Kosovo highlights the close partnership between \r\nthe EU and the United Nations. \r\n Efficient cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand other regional organizations, in particular the \r\nAfrican Union, is vital in making peacekeeping efforts \r\nmore effective. \r\n The full implementation of Security Council \r\nresolutions on women, peace and security is important \r\nto the European Union. We must ensure that they are \r\nfollowed up by concrete action. \r\n The United Nations has taken important steps in \r\nrecent years to develop a more systematic approach to \r\npost-conflict peacebuilding. The Peacebuilding \r\nCommission has proven to be an important vehicle to \r\nmobilize political and financial support and to focus on \r\nkey priorities. We must continue to take steps that can \r\nenhance joint coordination of policies and activities, \r\nboth at Headquarters and in the field. \r\n In his report, the Secretary-General points to \r\ncounter-terrorism and disarmament and non-proliferation \r\nas two areas where the United Nations should make a \r\nreal difference. The European Union commends the \r\nCounter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force for its \r\nwork and would like to see further steps towards a \r\nmore coherent United Nations approach to counter-\r\nterrorism, including the finalization of a \r\ncomprehensive convention on terrorism. As stated in \r\nthe report of the Secretary-General, there is \r\nencouraging growing momentum in global arms \r\ncontrol and disarmament. Over the next year, we have \r\na chance to revitalize multilateral work on these issues. \r\nThe European Union places strong emphasis on \r\nachieving a successful outcome to the 2010 Review \r\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. \r\n At the same time, we continue to face major \r\nproliferation challenges. We will continue to pursue \r\nresolute action in response to them. In that context, the \r\nEuropean Union stresses the crucial importance of full \r\nand immediate compliance with Security Council \r\nresolutions. \r\n One of the main purposes for the establishment of \r\nthe United Nations was to achieve international \r\ncooperation in promoting respect for human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms. In spite of the progress made, \r\nas outlined in the report of the Secretary-General, \r\nmuch remains to be done. In order for the United \r\n A/64/PV.14\r\n \r\n3 09-54337 \r\n \r\nNations to become more efficient, human rights must \r\nbe integrated into all policy areas of the United \r\nNations. The European Union will continue its work in \r\nkeeping human rights at the top of the United Nations \r\nagenda. \r\n We value what has been achieved to date by the \r\nSpecial Adviser to the Secretary-General on the \r\nPrevention of Genocide and look forward to further \r\ninformation and outreach to Member States on his \r\nactivities. \r\n The EU would like to express its gratitude and \r\nstrong support to the Special Advisers of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, and not least the Secretary-General himself, \r\nwith regard to the valuable report (A/63/677) on the \r\nimplementation of the responsibility to protect. In \r\nparticular, the EU looks forward to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s further proposals for strengthening the \r\nUnited Nations early warning capability, as suggested \r\nin the report. The EU stands ready to contribute to the \r\nefforts ahead. \r\n Resolution 63/311, on system-wide coherence, \r\nwhich was adopted by the General Assembly on the \r\nlast day of its sixty-third session, provides a good basis \r\nfor further work in the Assembly to improve the ability \r\nof the United Nations to make a difference for people \r\nin need. Of particular importance is the strong and \r\nunanimous support expressed by the General Assembly \r\nin the resolution for the establishment of a composite \r\ngender entity headed by an Under-Secretary-General. \r\nThe European Union stands ready to work with other \r\nMember States to finalize the remaining details of the \r\nentity. We are confident that this process can be a swift \r\none. \r\n The European Union looks forward to \r\ncontributing constructively to further progress in other \r\nareas concerning system-wide coherence during this \r\nsession of the General Assembly. Improving the \r\ngovernance structures and funding modalities for \r\nUnited Nations development work is essential for the \r\nOrganization to be an effective partner for developing \r\ncountries. On the delivering as one principle, we \r\nencourage the Secretary-General to move forward as \r\nsoon as possible with the independent evaluation of the \r\neight pilot projects. \r\n Some important steps in management reform \r\nwere taken in the past year. The European Union will \r\ncontinue to support efforts to modernize and reform the \r\nOrganization. At the same time, especially in this \r\nperiod of global economic crisis, we need to ensure \r\nthat the resources of the Organization are used in the \r\nmost effective and efficient way, without preventing it \r\nfrom carrying out its mandates. In that regard, we will \r\ncarefully study the budget and reform proposals \r\npresented to Member States. \r\n The European Union would like to see a change \r\nmade to the scale of assessments this autumn. The EU \r\nbelieves firmly that a fair and more balanced way to \r\nshare the budgetary responsibilities of the United \r\nNations is essential to the effective functioning of the \r\nOrganization. \r\n Lastly, on behalf of the European Union, I would \r\nlike to thank the Secretary-General and his staff and to \r\nexpress our gratitude for their commitment and \r\nachievements in carrying out the mandate we have \r\nentrusted to them. I assure them of the full support of \r\nthe European Union. \r\n Mr. Ali (Malaysia): Change is upon us. This past \r\nyear, the Organization and the international community \r\nat large went through one of the darkest periods in \r\nglobal economic history. As we recover from the \r\nimpact of the global crisis, we are learning to change \r\nhow we accomplish things. More cooperation is \r\nevident among Members of the United Nations, just as \r\nthe Organization itself has learned that adapting to \r\nchange is the only way by which it can remain \r\nrelevant, which is important for an Organization that is \r\nmore than 60 years old. \r\n The Secretary-General’s report (A/64/1) on the \r\nwork of the Organization refers to the adaptation \r\nprocess that the Organization has undergone both in \r\nthis past year and in previous years. We commend the \r\nongoing efforts of the Secretary-General in that regard. \r\nHowever, the reform of the United Nations as an \r\nOrganization should not be a stand-alone project, \r\nlimited only to the approval of the chief administrative \r\nofficer of the United Nations. \r\n Member States of the United Nations must also \r\nhave a fair amount of say in the goings-on of the \r\nSecretariat and other United Nations organs, bodies, \r\nagencies and programmes, especially when the reforms \r\ninvolve the creation of new mandates or an expansion \r\nof existing ones. There should also be restraint on the \r\npart of Secretariat bodies when it comes to proposing \r\nand embarking upon activities that could be \r\ndetrimental to the work of the Organization, in \r\nA/64/PV.14  \r\n \r\n09-54337 4 \r\n \r\nparticular when the views and opinions of Member \r\nStates have not been sought. \r\n This year, after Member States had been \r\nbelabouring the point for many years, the Counter-\r\nTerrorism Implementation Task Force (CTITF) was \r\nfinally formally institutionalized and placed under the \r\nDepartment of Political Affairs. During the four years \r\nsince its establishment by the Secretary-General, in \r\n2005, the CTITF was free to establish working groups. \r\nThe nine working groups it established existed without \r\nany kind of mandate from the Member States. That is \r\nsomething that we, along with many countries of the \r\ndeveloping world, viewed with great concern. To have \r\nun-mandated and unapproved working groups on the \r\nquestion of terrorism, which is one of the highly \r\npolitical and frequently recurring issues at the United \r\nNations, is simply baffling to this Member State. \r\n In particular for a developing country such as \r\nMalaysia, the practice of appointing officials within the \r\nUnited Nations system itself is a matter of concern. \r\nThe appointment of advisers to the Secretary-General \r\nand other staff in top posts more often than not seems \r\nto be the exclusive purview of the five permanent \r\nmembers of the Security Council. The rest of us \r\nMember States only find out about an appointment \r\nwhen it is a done deal. While we do not challenge the \r\nSecretary-General’s prerogative to appoint the \r\nmembers of his team, more transparency, consultation \r\nand dialogue will no doubt go a long way towards \r\ncontributing to the inclusiveness factor that is in the \r\nspirit of the United Nations. \r\n As an Organization with universal membership, \r\nthe United Nations is well-primed to play a leading \r\nrole in studying the impact and consequences of events \r\nby gathering information. However, before the system \r\nis fully locked into place, we welcome the recent \r\nefforts by the Secretary-General to brief Member States \r\nabout the possible implementation of the Global \r\nImpact and Vulnerability Alert System, which he has \r\nproposed. We believe that further discussions are \r\nneeded in order to fine-tune the system while ensuring \r\nthe optimization of the Organization’s resources and \r\nfurther guaranteeing that the core business of the \r\nOrganization is not jeopardized. \r\n Malaysia welcomes the establishment of the \r\nUnited Nations Dispute Tribunal and the United \r\nNations Appeals Tribunal under the new system of \r\njustice for the Organization. After a few hiccups, the \r\nDispute Tribunal was able to meet during summer of \r\n2009, and was still meeting as of last week. For \r\nMember States to be able to assess the effectiveness of \r\nthe new system of justice, a report on the work of the \r\nUNDT thus far should be forthcoming. \r\n For many around the world, the United Nations is \r\na beacon of hope. The United Nations has always been \r\ncentral in the areas of peacekeeping and development. \r\nThe past year was no different in that regard. In a \r\nsense, it is heartening to note that, despite the shrinking \r\nglobal economy, the Organization’s commitment in \r\nthose two areas has not diminished. In both \r\npeacekeeping and development, the Organization has \r\nin fact experienced an increase in budgetary \r\nallocations. \r\n However, in an environment where funding \r\nallocations are decreasing, the expenditures of the \r\nUnited Nations on peacekeeping alone are simply \r\nstaggering. This year’s forecast for peacekeeping \r\nexpenditures is expected to increase from $5.3 billion, \r\nnearly a year ago, to $7.8 billion. That figure \r\nrepresents more than half of the entire United Nations \r\nHeadquarters budget of $13.9 billion, and does not \r\ninclude the nearly $600 million that will need to come \r\nfrom the budget of the United Nations Headquarters. \r\nWhile Malaysia is as committed as any other Member \r\nto having United Nations peacekeepers on the ground, \r\nwe will need to carefully weigh each and every \r\npeacekeeping mission, as well as the viability of \r\nongoing missions that should turn from peacekeeping \r\nto peacebuilding. The practice of clustering all \r\npeacekeeping funding together for the approval of \r\nMember States without a critical analysis of the need \r\nfor specific missions needs to be stopped. \r\n As the United Nations has shown that it can work \r\nin cooperation with regional partners such as the \r\nEuropean Union and the African Union, this may be \r\none way of managing the staggering costs of United \r\nNations peacekeeping. It would also allow regional \r\npartners some measure of ownership over the \r\nmaintenance of peace and security in their regions, \r\nwith the United Nations standing by to offer technical \r\nand strategic support. \r\n The global economic crisis has put a damper on \r\nthe momentum of the international community when it \r\ncomes to achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals in general, specifically when it comes to the \r\nproblem of eradicating poverty. The United Nations \r\n A/64/PV.14\r\n \r\n5 09-54337 \r\n \r\nassessment that more than 100 million people have \r\nregressed to a state of extreme poverty is sobering, to \r\nsay the least. The Organization will need to work even \r\nharder to fulfil the Secretary-General’s promise of \r\ndelivering to those most in need. \r\n But the Organization has done well in its \r\ncoordinated efforts and cooperation with other entities \r\nin responding to international calamities. Buoyed by \r\nthe success of its 2006 reform initiatives, the \r\nOrganization must be commended for its efforts to \r\nfully mobilize the resources at its disposal for quick \r\nand effective humanitarian responses. But the \r\nOrganization must not be complacent. The increase in \r\nthe total funding for humanitarian operations received \r\nfrom Member States in 2008 must be matched this year \r\nand the next so that the worldwide humanitarian \r\nassistance provided by the United Nations will be able \r\nto continue. \r\n At this juncture, allow me to express the \r\ncondolences of my Government and its people to the \r\npeople of Indonesia in connection with the devastating \r\nquake that hit the island of Sumatra recently. I \r\nunderstand that a United Nations assessment team will \r\nbe in Padang this Friday to determine the extent of the \r\nhumanitarian assistance that will be needed in the \r\nweeks and months to come. Similarly, I would like to \r\nextend our condolences to Samoa and the Philippines \r\nwith regard to the devastation and loss of life caused, \r\nrespectively, by the tsunami and typhoon. \r\n On 24 September 2009, the United Nations took a \r\nbig step in connection with the issue of nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation and disarmament. In particular, the \r\nSecurity Council summit placed the matter clearly in \r\nthe international spotlight. If ever there was a time to \r\ncapitalize on the attention that has been generated \r\naround this issue, it is now. The Secretary-General \r\nmust do all he can to keep the question on the agenda, \r\nwhile at the same time creating a conducive \r\nenvironment for Member States to pursue this \r\nparticular matter. The Organization’s most recent push \r\nin this area will hopefully hasten the entry into force of \r\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. \r\n Climate change is another important area in \r\nwhich the Secretary-General has not shown hesitancy. \r\nThe problem becomes graver with every passing year. \r\nThis year’s meeting at Copenhagen needs to deliver \r\nresults. As it should be, the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is the main \r\nforum in which climate change is addressed. All other \r\nmeetings held outside of the scope of the UNFCCC \r\nshould supplement the work of the Convention, not \r\nduplicate it. The Organization as a whole has been able \r\nto assist national Governments in implementing the \r\nagreements related to climate change. We commend the \r\neffort by the United Nations Environment Programme \r\nto launch the Green Economy Initiative and Global \r\nGreen New Deal, as announced at Pittsburgh in \r\nSeptember 2009. Those are the kinds of deals that the \r\nUnited Nations should always try to seal. \r\n As we start the work of the Main Committees \r\nduring the sixty-fourth session of the General \r\nAssembly, Malaysia notes that the United Nations \r\nbudget for the 2010 to 2011 biennium will be \r\nnegotiated this year. Given today’s difficult economic \r\nsituation, we call upon Member States to provide, in a \r\ntimely manner, the resources necessary for the \r\nfunctioning of the Organization’s operations. We urge \r\nthe Organization to prioritize its areas of responsibility \r\nand to allocate those resources accordingly. Cutting \r\ncorners is a must, but not at the expense of the core \r\nbusiness of the United Nations. \r\n Finally, pursuant to the report of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group on the Revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly (A/63/959), more must be done to raise the \r\nprofile of both the United Nations and the General \r\nAssembly itself. The Department of Public Information \r\nmust be tenacious in its efforts to generate wider media \r\ncoverage of the issues being debated at the General \r\nAssembly. Because the United Nations should not \r\nstand in isolation, Malaysia welcomes the initiative of \r\nthe Secretary-General to reach out to different \r\nsegments of society through programmes such as the \r\nGlobal Compact and the recently launched Academic \r\nImpact. Multi-stakeholder approaches are very much \r\nthe norm now. Any effort that advances the causes that \r\nwe as Member States hold dear in our hearts must be \r\nsupported. \r\n The delegation of Malaysia stands ready to \r\nstrengthen the Organization’s capabilities to function \r\neffectively and efficiently so that it may turn to doing \r\nits job in fulfilling the needs of the peoples of the \r\nworld who are most in need. \r\n Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): Allow \r\nme at the outset to express our deep gratitude to \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his report on the \r\nwork of the Organization (A/64/1) and for its clear \r\nA/64/PV.14  \r\n \r\n09-54337 6 \r\n \r\nmessage that the huge challenges currently facing our \r\nworld make it imperative to strengthen our collective \r\nmultilateral action, with the United Nations at its \r\ncentre. \r\n Yet, despite the Secretary-General’s tireless \r\nefforts aimed at enhancing the Organization’s \r\ncredibility by laying out plans for reforming and \r\nenergizing it so that it may better perform its functions, \r\nthe success of the United Nations in fulfilling its duties \r\nwith the necessary efficiency, effectiveness and \r\nintegrity depends on the political will of Member \r\nStates and on the support they give the Secretary-\r\nGeneral so that he can carry out his duties as well as \r\npossible. This year’s report shows that the challenges \r\nwe are facing require global multilateral action that \r\ndraws on the strengths of all countries and on their \r\nrespective contributions to collective international \r\naction. \r\n Development activities, deservedly, are at the \r\nforefront of the report, which explains that the world \r\nfinancial crisis and the accompanying economic \r\ndownturn have resulted in a shortage of the resources \r\nneeded to continue the work of achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), so that we \r\nwill have to redouble our efforts between now and the \r\ntarget date of 2015. It is thus of pivotal importance that \r\nthe Secretary-General submit to the 2010 MDG review \r\nsummit concrete proposals in all areas of development, \r\nin particular social development, which has not yet \r\nreceived sufficient support. I would also like to \r\ncommend the report’s discussion of the intention to \r\nestablish a comprehensive approach within the United \r\nNations system for addressing crises, as well as a \r\nglobal early warning system for determining possible \r\nimpacts and identifying the most vulnerable parties. \r\nThis will require Member States to work towards that \r\ngoal and put in place the necessary machinery. \r\n This situation belies the claim made by developed \r\ncountries that the world financial and economic crisis \r\njustifies abandoning their development financing \r\ncommitments. On the contrary, from the point of view \r\nof the developing countries, not only has the current \r\ncrisis made it even more important for developed \r\ncountries to carry out their previous development \r\ncommitments in full; it means that financial \r\ncontributions actually need to be increased to help \r\ndeveloping countries overcome the ramifications of the \r\ncrisis itself, not to mention other crises they face. This \r\nis particularly true of commitments to Africa, since \r\nmany of these have yet to be fulfilled, which threatens \r\nthe ability of the majority of the continent’s countries \r\nto attain the MDGs by the year 2015. \r\n Moreover, we share the Secretary-General’s view \r\nthat 2009 should be the year for confronting climate \r\nchange. The Secretary-General has exerted massive \r\nefforts to influence international action on this issue, \r\nmost recently the successful summit he convened at the \r\nbeginning of the sixty-fourth session. All such efforts \r\nshould be built upon in order to reach a new agreement \r\nat December’s Copenhagen Climate Change \r\nConference that guarantees the international \r\ncommunity’s unity on the issue. \r\n The Egyptian delegation agrees with the warning \r\nin the Secretary-General’s report that a deteriorating \r\neconomic situation could possibly lead to political \r\ntension and the exacerbation of internal crises, \r\nthreatening stability in Africa. We also agree that \r\ngreater emphasis should be placed on United Nations \r\nefforts in the fields of preventive diplomacy, the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes and post-conflict \r\npeacebuilding. Last year the General Assembly adopted \r\nthe Secretary-General’s proposals for increasing the \r\nrole of the Department of Political Affairs in the area \r\nof preventive diplomacy (see resolution 63/261).  \r\n We should also turn our attention to reform of \r\npeacekeeping operations, especially in the light of the \r\npositive outcome resulting from the separation of the \r\nDepartments of Peacekeeping Operations and Field \r\nSupport. This will require an in-depth study of \r\ninitiatives aimed at promoting and enhancing the \r\neffectiveness of the United Nations role in \r\npeacekeeping operations, based on the “New Horizon” \r\nnon-paper and taking into consideration the views and \r\nsuggestions of Member States, in a framework of \r\ntransparency and frankness that reflects the interests of \r\nall parties: host countries, troop contributors and donor \r\ncountries. \r\n By the same token, Egypt firmly supports the role \r\nof the Peacebuilding Commission in promoting peace \r\nand stability in post-conflict countries, especially in \r\nAfrica. We also welcome the committee’s priorities in \r\ndefining the general strategic framework formulated by \r\nthe national authorities in each country, in coordination \r\nand cooperation with the United Nations, especially the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission. In this regard, we stress \r\nthe necessity of considering a number of specific \r\nmeasures during the 2010 comprehensive review of the \r\n A/64/PV.14\r\n \r\n7 09-54337 \r\n \r\nPeacebuilding Commission. Most important of these \r\nare: strengthening the principle of national ownership \r\nin all phases of peacebuilding; enhancing and \r\ndeveloping the institutional relationship between the \r\nCommission and the General Assembly, the Security \r\nCouncil and the Economic and Social Council; and \r\ndeveloping the relationship between the Commission \r\nand all active national parties, including \r\nnon-governmental organizations and civil society. We \r\nshould also ensure that the General Assembly \r\ncontinues to support and strengthen the Peacebuilding \r\nSupport Office and provide the Commission with the \r\nposts and financial resources required for holding \r\nmeetings and fulfilling relevant tasks, including field \r\nvisits, as well as providing support for the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund. \r\n There is no doubt that the natural disasters that \r\nhave befallen the Philippines, Indonesia, Samoa, \r\nAmerican Samoa and other places emphasize the \r\nimportance of continued improvement of the United \r\nNations role in providing humanitarian assistance, in a \r\nmanner that enhances its effectiveness in countries \r\naffected by disasters, whether natural or man-made, \r\nespecially as regards institutional capacity-building \r\naimed at helping such countries respond effectively \r\nand successfully. This should begin with a preventive \r\nstage helping countries improve prediction, early \r\nwarning and preparedness; it should be followed with \r\nassistance aimed at mitigating a disaster’s impact, \r\nembarking on reconstruction and moving forward from \r\nrelief to development. \r\n In spite of the steps taken within the multilateral \r\nframework to promote respect for human rights, and \r\nthe radical reforms represented in the establishment of \r\nthe Human Rights Council and the introduction of the \r\nperiodic review mechanism, there are still attempts by \r\nsome to politicize human rights issues, through \r\nselectivity and double standards, as a pretext for \r\ninterfering in countries’ internal affairs, contrary to the \r\nUnited Nations Charter. We therefore look forward to \r\ncontinued strengthening of the role of the Human \r\nRights Council in the light of developments resulting \r\nfrom the agreement on the Council’s institutional \r\nstructure. We also await a comprehensive evaluation in \r\n2011 of the Council’s work, strengthening it and \r\nenabling it to take on the substantive role expected of \r\nit, in coordination with the Office of the United \r\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights. This \r\nshould also put an end to any attempt to impose special \r\nconcepts or standards, or to give political and civic \r\ndimensions priority at the expense of economic, \r\ncultural, and social ones, while giving due attention to \r\nthe right to development as a cornerstone of capacity-\r\nbuilding efforts and promoting respect for human \r\nrights and basic freedoms. \r\n As we welcome the efforts of the High \r\nRepresentative for the Alliance of Civilizations, we \r\nwould like to point out with a note of caution that this \r\nnoble concept is still more a theory than a practical \r\nreality. It will require greater action on the part of \r\nacademic, cultural and media institutions to resist \r\nmisconceptions and stereotypes and promote the \r\nconcepts of tolerance, peaceful coexistence and respect \r\nfor cultural specificities. \r\n Within the framework of the reform and \r\ndevelopment process launched at the World Summit in \r\n2005, Egypt has participated effectively in the ongoing \r\nconsultations regarding the responsibility to protect, as \r\noutlined in paragraphs 138 and 139 of the Summit \r\nOutcome (resolution 60/1). We look forward to \r\ncontinuing this constructive dialogue with a view to \r\nformulating a common, serious and objective approach, \r\novercoming fears, and affirming the concepts of early \r\nwarning and capacity-building as main pillars of that \r\nresponsibility, without politicization or double \r\nstandards. \r\n Together during the sixty-third session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, we managed a step towards an \r\nimportant and essential common goal, namely, gender \r\nequality and the empowerment of women to practice \r\ntheir fundamental rights and to realize their creative \r\npotentials. We hope that positive momentum will \r\ncontinue during the sixty-fourth session. \r\n Within the framework of the intergovernmental \r\nprocess to consider the recommendations of the Report \r\nof the High-level Panel on United Nations System-\r\nwide Coherence (see A/61/583), and as Chair of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement (NAM), Egypt contributed, \r\nthrough the NAM Joint Coordinating Committee and \r\nthe Group of 77 and China, along with our partners \r\nfrom developed countries, to the adoption by consensus \r\nof resolution 63/311. That represented a step forward \r\ntowards qualitatively enhancing the gender architecture \r\nwithin the United Nations and moving towards \r\nachieving the required and necessary enhancement of \r\nfinancing and governance systems. It also assures that \r\nissues related to business practices and the “One \r\nA/64/PV.14  \r\n \r\n09-54337 8 \r\n \r\nUnited Nations” programme will continue to be \r\naddressed. We look forward to continuing our joint \r\nefforts in this regard during the sixty-fourth session. \r\n We still have a great deal of work to accomplish \r\non both revitalizing the role of the General Assembly \r\nand reforming and expanding the membership of the \r\nSecurity Council. Both issues are interrelated and are \r\nlinked to several aspects of United Nations reform \r\nwhich could restore the institutional balance that is \r\ncurrently lacking among the principal organs of the \r\nOrganization. This imbalance results in the loss of the \r\nfundamental character and identity of the United \r\nNations as the engine of multilateral international \r\naction. \r\n Last but not least, Egypt welcomes the recent \r\ninitiatives which created an encouraging momentum \r\ntowards achieving the goal of a world free of nuclear \r\nweapons. We share the Secretary-General’s view that \r\nthe review process of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \r\nTreaty (NPT) has regained some of the momentum it \r\nhad lost in 2005, which could help towards the success \r\nof the 2010 NPT Review Conference. \r\n However, realizing such expectations requires \r\nthat the credibility of the NPT be strengthened through \r\nachievement of the Treaty’s universality, with the \r\naccession of all countries without exception. That \r\nshould not be done through the creation of a \r\ndiscriminatory reality that will impose additional \r\ncommitments and restrictions on the non-nuclear \r\nmember countries while giving countries that are not \r\nparties to the Treaty the freedom to develop their \r\nnuclear weapons programmes. That would impose a \r\nnew nuclear reality outside the framework of the \r\nTreaty. \r\n In that context, we were hoping that the \r\nSecretary-General would refer in his report to Israel’s \r\nambiguous nuclear capabilities, which create an \r\nunacceptable exception in the Middle East, especially \r\nsince the indefinite extension of the NPT in 1995 \r\nincluded integrated arrangements and specific steps to \r\naddress the situation in the Middle East that have not \r\nyet been implemented. \r\n Hence, I reaffirm once again that the success of \r\nthe 2010 Review Conference will depend primarily on \r\nthe implementation of the terms agreed for the Treaty’s \r\nindefinite extension, especially the Conference’s \r\nresolution on the Middle East. Egypt will make the \r\nutmost effort to promote the balanced implementation \r\nof that agreement, with a view to supporting the \r\nnon-proliferation regime and the initiatives that were \r\nlaunched in that regard. \r\n Mr. Liu Zhenmin (China) (spoke in Chinese): \r\nThe Chinese delegation welcomes Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon’s report on the work of the Organization \r\n(A/64/1). I take this opportunity to express my \r\nappreciation and gratitude to Mr. Ban Ki-moon for his \r\ndiligent work and outstanding performance over the \r\npast year. \r\n Deepening economic globalization and the rapid \r\ndevelopment of science and technology have further \r\nstrengthened the interdependence among countries and \r\nregions. Countries worldwide find their interests and \r\ndestinies increasingly integrated. No one can remain \r\nimmune to the acute challenges presented by the \r\nfinancial and economic crisis, climate change and the \r\nneed to provide security in the areas of food, energy, \r\nresources and public health. And no one can cope with \r\nthese challenges single-handed. In the face of these \r\nunprecedented opportunities and challenges, we must \r\nopt for multilateralism, promote the democratization of \r\ninternational relations and strengthen global \r\ncoordination and cooperation. \r\n In addition to the lack of fundamental \r\nimprovement and the grave lack of resource for \r\ndevelopment, developing countries are now facing \r\nfurther domestic economic difficulties and a worsening \r\nexternal development environment as a result of the \r\ninternational financial crisis. That crisis has caused \r\nimmense setbacks in their efforts to attain the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs).  \r\n Although developing countries are not \r\nresponsible for the outbreak of this crisis, they are its \r\nprincipal victims. In coping with the international \r\nfinancial crisis, we should also pay attention to the \r\nunprecedented development crisis. Any endeavour to \r\naddress the financial crisis must take into account the \r\nneed for development, particularly the special concerns \r\nof the least developed countries and African countries. \r\n The United Nations should increase its input in \r\ndevelopment, play a bigger role in responding to the \r\nfinancial crisis and promoting development, and work \r\nhard to create an international environment favourable \r\nto the development of developing countries so as to \r\nensure the timely attainment of the MDGs. The success \r\nof the high-level Conference on the World Financial \r\nand Economic Crisis and Its Impact on Development, \r\n A/64/PV.14\r\n \r\n9 09-54337 \r\n \r\nheld during the sixty-third session of the General \r\nAssembly, demonstrated the important role of the \r\nGeneral Assembly in responding to the financial crisis. \r\nChina supports the full implementation of action to \r\nfollow up on the outcome of the Conference. \r\n Climate change involves the common interests of \r\nall countries, particularly the development interests of \r\ndeveloping countries and the welfare of their peoples. \r\nAt the recent United Nations Summit on Climate \r\nChange, President Hu Jintao of China set out my \r\ncountry’s position on climate change and announced a \r\nseries of measures that China will take in this regard. \r\nAs the world’s most populous developing country, \r\nChina still faces numerous difficulties in its \r\ndevelopment endeavours. \r\n Nevertheless, it puts great emphasis on the issue \r\nof climate change. We will work together with other \r\ncountries, take a responsible approach to the issue, \r\nabide by the United Nations Framework Convention on \r\nClimate Change and its Kyoto Protocol as the main \r\nchannel for tackling climate change, adhere to the \r\nprinciple of common but differentiated responsibilities \r\nand the mandate of the Bali Road Map, and make \r\nactive efforts to push for the success of the Climate \r\nChange Conference to be held in Copenhagen. \r\n While the overall international security situation \r\nis stable, some long-standing hot-spot issues remain \r\nunresolved, and regional conflicts still flare up from \r\ntime to time. The financial and economic crisis has \r\nexacerbated existing social problems in some countries \r\nand has triggered new social conflicts — even political \r\nturbulence.  \r\n The international struggle against terrorism still \r\nfaces daunting challenges. Somali pirates now pose a \r\nnew threat to the security of international shipping. In \r\nplaces such as the Middle East, Darfur, the Horn of \r\nAfrica, Iraq and Afghanistan, the United Nations is \r\nplaying a significant role in peacekeeping and post-\r\nconflict reconstruction. \r\n At the request of the countries and regional \r\norganizations concerned, the United Nations has also \r\nbeen actively engaged in good offices efforts and \r\npreventive diplomacy, thus contributing to preventing \r\nthe further escalation of instability. Facts have proven \r\nthat, in addressing regional hot-spot issues and \r\ninternational disputes, it is imperative to adhere both to \r\nthe purposes and principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations and to peaceful dialogue. In deploying United \r\nNations peacekeeping missions, equal attention should \r\nbe paid to promoting political negotiations. \r\n China is firmly opposed to all forms of terrorism, \r\nseparatism and extremism. Combating terrorism \r\nrequires the elimination of the breeding grounds for \r\nterrorism. Double standards should not be allowed in \r\nthe fight against terrorism; nor should terrorism be \r\nlinked with any specific country, ethnic group or \r\nreligion. Within the framework of the Global Counter-\r\nTerrorism Strategy, the United Nations should continue \r\nto integrate the resources of the relevant organs of the \r\nsystem and implement the four pillars of the Counter-\r\nTerrorism Strategy in a comprehensive and balanced \r\nmanner. \r\n Mr. Mohamad (Sudan), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n The process of international arms control, \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation now faces an \r\nimportant opportunity. Countries should set their sights \r\non the goal of universal security, uphold the new \r\nsecurity concept characterized by mutual trust, mutual \r\nbenefit, equality and cooperation, give full play to the \r\nrole of multilateral mechanisms, including the United \r\nNations, continuously consolidate and reinforce the \r\nexisting multilateral mechanisms for arms control, \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation, strengthen \r\ndialogue and cooperation in the field of security and \r\nmake joint efforts to create a harmonious and stable \r\nsecurity environment at the international and regional \r\nlevels. China has always stood for the comprehensive \r\nprohibition and total destruction of nuclear weapons \r\nand for the realization of a nuclear-weapon-free world. \r\nThe international community should effectively \r\npromote the process of nuclear disarmament, eliminate \r\nthe risk of nuclear proliferation and promote the \r\npeaceful use of nuclear energy and international \r\ncooperation in this regard. \r\n China supports the necessary and reasonable \r\nreform of the United Nations as a means to enhance its \r\nauthority and efficiency, increase its capacity to \r\nrespond to various threats and challenges and fulfil \r\nmore effectively the responsibilities entrusted to it \r\nunder the Charter. While some positive progress has \r\nbeen achieved in the reform of the Organization since \r\n2005, there is still some way to go towards meeting the \r\nexpectations of Member States. The reform of the \r\nUnited Nations should be a multidimensional and \r\nmultisectoral undertaking with particular emphasis on \r\nA/64/PV.14  \r\n \r\n09-54337 10 \r\n \r\ndevelopment, which is the major concern of developing \r\ncountries. It is necessary to increase inputs in that \r\nfield, guarantee resources for development and \r\nstrengthen development institutions. \r\n China supports the revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly, which we believe is the joint political \r\nresponsibility of all Member States. The revitalization \r\nof the Assembly should first of all find expression in \r\nthe active participation of Member States in the policy \r\ndeliberations of the Assembly and the effective \r\nimplementation of its resolutions and decisions.  \r\n China supports Security Council reform, which is \r\nan important part of the overall reform of the United \r\nNations. China is of the view that priority should be \r\ngiven to increasing the representation of developing \r\ncountries in the Council, especially African countries. \r\nThe intergovernmental negotiations on Security \r\nCouncil reform have provided a new platform for \r\nMember States to explore this issue. We hope that \r\nMember States will continue broad-based and \r\ndemocratic consultations with a view to achieving the \r\nwidest possible agreement on a package solution to all \r\ncategories of questions on Security Council reform.  \r\n China supports a strengthened United Nations \r\ncapacity for peacebuilding endeavours. China hopes \r\nthat the Peacebuilding Commission will integrate the \r\nresources of the relevant United Nations organs, \r\nstrengthen coordination and cooperation with them and \r\ncontinue to seek successful ways to assist countries in \r\npost-conflict situations in their efforts to engage in \r\npeaceful reconstruction and embark upon the path \r\ntowards stability and development. \r\n The establishment of the Human Rights Council \r\nis one of the important achievements of United Nations \r\nreform. The Human Rights Council has witnessed an \r\nimprovement in its institutional operation and in its \r\ncapacity to respond to emerging human rights \r\nsituations and to reduce the number of internal \r\nconfrontations. Since the Human Rights Council is \r\nexpected to be a forum in which human rights issues \r\nare dealt with in a fair, objective and non-selective \r\nmanner, China hopes that, in taking part in the work of \r\nthe Human Rights Council, various parties will proceed \r\nfrom the standpoint of promoting and protecting human \r\nrights, avoid politicizing human rights issues, pay \r\nequal attention to all kinds of human rights, increase \r\nmutual understanding and narrow differences on the \r\nquestion of human rights through dialogue, cooperation \r\nand communication. \r\n The United Nations needs a stable financial \r\nfoundation in order to function normally. The principle \r\nof the capacity to pay is the basic tenet in defining \r\nways to assess contributions. It should continue to be \r\nupheld. Stability should be maintained in the scale of \r\nassessments and its calculation methods. That \r\ncontributes to a stable financial foundation for the \r\nUnited Nations. In the context of the ongoing \r\nexpansion and deepening of the international financial \r\ncrisis, maintaining the current method of calculating \r\ncontribution assessments is in the interests of the \r\nmajority of States. \r\n In his speech during the general debate at this \r\nsession of the General Assembly, President Hu Jintao \r\nof China called on the international community to join \r\nhands in the march forward, uphold the ideals of peace, \r\ndevelopment, cooperation, win-win progress and \r\ntolerance and work towards a harmonious world of \r\nenduring peace and common prosperity. China will \r\ncontinue to firmly support the United Nations in \r\nplaying a central role in international affairs, resolutely \r\nstand for the maintenance and enhancement of the \r\nauthority of the Organization and work tirelessly for \r\nthe noble cause of peace and the development of \r\nhumankind. \r\n Mrs. Viotti (Brazil): I would like to thank \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his report on the \r\nwork of the Organization (A/64/1), which describes the \r\nactivities of the United Nations during a period \r\ncharacterized by multiple and combined crises. We \r\nappreciate the continued efforts of both the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the Secretariat to promote the purposes \r\nand principles of the United Nations. \r\n The report calls for a new multilateralism as the \r\nway forward for the international community to meet \r\nthe challenges brought about by the economic, \r\nfinancial, food, energy, environmental and health \r\ncrises. That has been Brazil’s vision for a long time \r\nnow. Ever since he took office, President Lula has \r\ncalled for, and worked towards, globalization with \r\nsolidarity and social responsibility. \r\n The universal character of the United Nations \r\nmakes it an invaluable platform to foster global \r\ncooperation on our common challenges. In order to \r\nmaintain that fundamental feature, the United Nations \r\nsystem must reform and strengthen itself.  \r\n A/64/PV.14\r\n \r\n11 09-54337 \r\n \r\n The General Assembly has provided ample \r\nevidence of its own vitality by addressing some of the \r\nmost urgent and pressing issues facing the international \r\ncommunity. The interactive dialogues on the food \r\ncrisis, energy efficiency and human trafficking and the \r\nConference on the World Financial and Economic \r\nCrisis and Its Impact on Development are examples of \r\nthe renewed impetus of this organ.  \r\n The General Assembly has also shown leadership \r\nin holding intergovernmental negotiations on the \r\nreform of the Security Council. A new multilateralism \r\ncalls for a new Security Council — one with greater \r\nrepresentation for developing countries in both \r\ncategories of membership. \r\n The increased participation of developing \r\ncountries in multilateral regimes is a means of raising \r\ntheir voices with regard to finding solutions to \r\nproblems that concern and severely affect them. It \r\ncannot, and must not, mean shifting to their shoulders a \r\nburden that is not theirs. This is especially true with \r\nregard to the economic and climate crises. Although a \r\nhost of measures have been devised within several \r\nforums in recent months to avoid economic collapse \r\nand to build the foundations for recovery, much more \r\nneeds to be done.  \r\n Developing countries need new and additional \r\nresources for the implementation of countercyclical \r\npolicies. Financial market regulations need to be \r\noverhauled in developed countries to avert a recurrence \r\nof the problems that generated the global crisis, with \r\nits serious implications for developing countries. In \r\naddition, the economic recovery must be jobs-\r\nintensive, promote decent work for all and establish \r\nadequate social protections. Its effects must be \r\nwidespread and reach, in particular, the poorest \r\ncountries. \r\n With regard to climate change, its link to \r\ndevelopment cannot be overstated. Bold commitments \r\nmust be taken in Copenhagen within the framework of \r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange (UNFCCC) and its Kyoto Protocol, and based \r\non the principle of common but differentiated \r\nresponsibilities and respective capabilities. If \r\ndeveloping countries are to embark on the path of low-\r\ncarbon development, access to and transfer of \r\ntechnology will be imperative, as will be adequate new \r\nand additional financial resources both for nationally \r\nappropriate mitigation actions and for adaptation under \r\nthe provisions of the UNFCCC. \r\n We need to forge a new international covenant to \r\nfoster sustainable development. It is important that we \r\nrecommit to the agreements and goals set in 1992 in \r\nRio de Janeiro at the United Nations Conference on \r\nEnvironment and Development, and in 2002 in \r\nJohannesburg, at the World Summit on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. A new conference in 2012 is warranted, \r\nin our view. We are encouraged by the support we have \r\nreceived from the Group of 77 and China and from \r\nother countries for our offer to host that conference. \r\n Concerns over food security must also remain \r\nhigh on our agenda. In addition to taking urgent \r\nmeasures to ensure that sufficient food reaches the \r\nhungry and vulnerable in a timely manner, we must \r\naddress the underlying distortions that have generated \r\nunderinvestment in agriculture, particularly in \r\ndeveloping countries. We also need an integrated \r\napproach to food security that can allow for \r\ncomprehensive and long-lasting solutions. Such an \r\napproach must include investment in production and \r\ninfrastructure, research, trade, social safety nets, \r\nemergency food assistance and nutrition. Special \r\nattention and support should be given to the food and \r\nagricultural needs of Africa. \r\n We welcome the auspicious signs of recent \r\nmonths in the area of disarmament. We must build on \r\nsuch progress. The entry into force of the \r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the \r\ncommencement of substantive negotiations on a fissile \r\nmaterial treaty would significantly strengthen the \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation regime. There is a \r\nclear and inextricable link between disarmament and \r\nnon-proliferation; they are mutually reinforcing \r\nprocesses in which the best guarantee against nuclear \r\nproliferation is nuclear disarmament. The balance \r\nbetween the three pillars of the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons must be \r\nmaintained. \r\n United Nations peacekeeping is another \r\nimportant element of our efforts to make and keep the \r\nworld safe for all. Having experienced unprecedented \r\nlevels of deployment in increasingly complex \r\nsituations, peacekeeping should be adapted to the \r\nneeds of the twenty-first century. Enhanced \r\ncooperation among the Security Council, troop- and \r\npolice-contributing countries, the Secretariat and \r\nA/64/PV.14  \r\n \r\n09-54337 12 \r\n \r\nregional organizations is key to successfully addressing \r\nthe challenges before us. \r\n The peacebuilding efforts of the United Nations \r\nare another tool at our disposal in the search for peace \r\nand development. They are already bearing fruit in \r\nBurundi, Sierra Leone, Guinea-Bissau and the Central \r\nAfrican Republic. We must continue to strengthen the \r\nUnited Nations peacebuilding structures and make \r\nthem more responsive to the needs of countries \r\nemerging from conflict. The synergies between conflict \r\nprevention, peacemaking, peacekeeping and \r\npeacebuilding should be strengthened. \r\n Conflicts, the food crisis and natural disasters are \r\nredoubling the pressures on humanitarian assistance. \r\nWe commend the progress made in ensuring more \r\ntimely, predictable and accountable humanitarian \r\nresponses from the United Nations system, as well as \r\nstrengthened responses to United Nations consolidated \r\nand flash appeals. It is unfortunate, however, that the \r\ntotal requirement of the humanitarian appeals has not \r\nbeen fully met. \r\n The Human Rights Council continues its \r\nimportant work of promoting and defending human \r\nrights. The implementation of the Universal Periodic \r\nReview, the adoption of the Optional Protocol to the \r\nInternational Covenant on Economic, Social and \r\nCultural Rights and the positive outcome of the Durban \r\nReview Conference are all relevant developments. The \r\nCouncil must continue to operate in a non-selective \r\nand constructive manner, while maintaining the \r\ncapacity to address situations of particular concern. \r\n Despite its many shortcomings, which we must \r\nkeep working to redress, this Organization is still \r\nmankind’s best hope for building a more just and \r\nhumane international system. Today, I reiterate Brazil’s \r\nfirm commitment to such a lofty yet very concrete \r\nendeavour. \r\n Mr. Dapkiunas (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): The \r\nBelarusian delegation supports the recommendation \r\nmade by the Secretary-General in his report (A/64/1) \r\nthat difficult international questions be addressed \r\nthrough multilateralism. We share the view that \r\nmultilateralism has never been as important as it is \r\ntoday, and that the multilateral efforts of powerful \r\ncountries and the contributions of all countries are \r\ntherefore necessary to address global problems. From \r\nthe viewpoint of Belarus, multilateralism and \r\npartnerships are cooperative mechanisms that have no \r\nviable alternative in tackling numerous and \r\ncontradictory global problems. The Non-Aligned \r\nMovement has long affirmed that point.  \r\n We are pleased that, after a long interruption, \r\ncountries worldwide are again thinking in terms of a \r\nsingle coordinating system and that world leaders are \r\nbeginning to talk in the common language of common \r\nsense. \r\n We repeat the appeal made at the general debate \r\nof the General Assembly 10 days ago by the Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Belarus to members of the \r\ninternational community, including the world power \r\ncentres and leading political groups, to translate their \r\ngood intentions into practical deeds by developing \r\nglobal partnerships and crisis strategies.  \r\n We believe that within the framework of \r\nmultilateral efforts to promote the global good, greater \r\nattention should be paid to forming energy partnerships \r\nto overcome the global energy crisis. We need \r\nimmediate and decisive multilateral action in the \r\nsphere of energy to establish a global mechanism to \r\nincrease access to new and renewable energy \r\ntechnologies for developing countries and transitional \r\neconomies, which could become a special new kind of \r\npartnership. By taking part in such a mechanism, all \r\ninterested parties — including developed countries, the \r\nprivate sector and non-governmental entities — would \r\nmake it possible to form a clear framework for \r\ncoordinated action and to promote broad, universal use \r\nof the latest energy technologies and new and \r\nrenewable energy sources. Coordinating efforts in the \r\nenergy field will lay the foundation for a quantum leap \r\nforward. Belarus calls on the delegations of United \r\nNations Member States and the Secretary-General to \r\nstudy this question thoroughly. \r\n Belarus also supports the measures proposed by \r\nthe Secretary-General to combat hunger, poverty and \r\ndisease. At the same time, we believe that it will be \r\nimpossible to implement such measures without first \r\nstrengthening the economic potential and the political \r\nrole of medium-income States. We believe that the \r\nUnited Nations system must undertake active steps to \r\nassist those countries in solving their specific social \r\nand economic problems. Success in the work of \r\nmedium-income countries will make it possible to form \r\na stable global system to open new opportunities for \r\nthe economic growth of poor countries and increase \r\nassistance for development. \r\n A/64/PV.14\r\n \r\n13 09-54337 \r\n \r\n A few days ago, from this rostrum (see \r\nA/64/PV.10), the Belarus delegation informed the \r\nAssembly of the formation of one of the most up-to-\r\ndate global partnerships against human trafficking and \r\nslavery in the twenty-first century. The logical outcome \r\nof the creation of such a partnership should be a global \r\nplan of action for combating human trafficking.  \r\n Important steps have already been taken to that \r\nend. The idea of a global plan won wide support in the \r\ncourse of the thematic debates of the General Assembly \r\nin May. The President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-third session appointed the ambassadors of Cape \r\nVerde and Portugal as coordinators for consultations on \r\nquestions of producing a global plan. We call on all \r\ndelegations to take an active part in the work of \r\npreparing and adopting this plan. If we approach this \r\nquestion constructively, we will be able to translate \r\ninto concrete effect the Secretary-General’s declaration \r\nthat we are giving the highest priority to the problems \r\nof women and children.  \r\n We support the efforts of the United Nations to \r\nkeep the theme of human rights at the centre of the \r\ninternational agenda. We see the development of \r\ninterfaith and intercultural dialogue as the basis of \r\nstability and security as an important step in this \r\ndirection. At the recent ministerial meeting on \r\ninterfaith dialogue for the benefit of peace and \r\ndevelopment organized by the Philippines, Belarus \r\nsuggested the idea of the General Assembly’s holding \r\nthematic debates on interfaith dialogue. We propose \r\nthat the leaders of the world’s leading religions and \r\nfaith-based non-governmental organizations be invited \r\nto these debates, which could make an important \r\ncontribution to the development of mutual \r\nunderstanding and respect for our respective cultures \r\nand religions. \r\n Belarus welcomes the return of disarmament to \r\nthe international agenda and the attention accorded that \r\nimportant issue by the Secretary-General. Belarus \r\nstresses the particular role and responsibility of the \r\nnuclear-weapon States. We note with satisfaction the \r\npositive signals of growing attention to questions of \r\nnuclear disarmament and non-proliferation within \r\nindividual States and international forums. \r\n As a State party to the Treaty on the Reduction \r\nand Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, which is to \r\nexpire in December 2009, Belarus welcomes the \r\nintention by the Russian Federation and the United \r\nStates of America to come to an agreement on the \r\nfurther reduction and limitation of their strategic \r\noffensive weapons and to conclude new legally binding \r\nagreements. Belarus’ adherence to the strategic \r\noffensive weapons Treaty through its signature of the \r\n1992 Lisbon Protocol is inseparably linked to its \r\ndecision to join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons as a non-nuclear-weapon State. \r\n In this regard, we are convinced that one \r\nimportant priority, along with nuclear disarmament, \r\nnon-proliferation and ensuring genuine and equal \r\naccess to peaceful nuclear technology, is the provision \r\nof clear, legally binding security assurances to \r\nnon-nuclear-weapon States. Unfortunately, the question \r\nof providing negative security guarantees is not \r\naddressed in the report of the Secretary-General.  \r\n After the tragic events of 11 September 2001, the \r\nUnited Nations assumed a lead role in combating \r\ninternational terrorism. That led, in 2006, to the \r\nadoption of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. In \r\nthe context of the counter-terrorism efforts mentioned \r\nin the report of the Secretary-General, we call for \r\nconsideration of the idea put forth during the general \r\ndebate by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belarus \r\nthat the United Nations declare 11 September the \r\ninternational day of the fight against terrorism (see \r\nA/64/PV.10). \r\n The delegation of Belarus supports the efforts of \r\nthe Secretary-General to strengthen the United Nations. \r\nWe are impressed by his comparison of the Secretariat \r\nto a heart and of the General Assembly, the Security \r\nCouncil and the Economic and Social Council to \r\narteries and nerves that “transport the life blood and \r\nenergy to the Organization” (A/64/1, para. 130).  \r\n In that regard, we consider it imperative to \r\nactively pursue the work of revitalizing the General \r\nAssembly so as to maintain the health of the \r\nOrganization’s cardiovascular and nervous systems. \r\nThe delegation of Belarus hopes that the realization of \r\nsuch proposals, as rightly pointed out by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, will make the refurbishment of the facade of \r\nthe Organization’s Headquarters into a symbol of its \r\ninternal renewal. \r\n Mr. Rosenthal (Guatemala) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nAt the outset, I would like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the presentation of his clear report on the \r\nwork of the Organization (A/64/1). We note that the \r\npast 12 months, which have witnessed so many major \r\nA/64/PV.14  \r\n \r\n09-54337 14 \r\n \r\nevents throughout the world, are reflected in the \r\ndiversity and intensity of the activities of the United \r\nNations. On the one hand, the Organization has been \r\nable to address the emerging challenges; on the other \r\nhand, however, the results have been mixed. \r\nAccordingly, it is worth highlighting some of the issues \r\nraised by the Secretary-General in his report. \r\n First, he has eloquently and persuasively outlined \r\nthe scope and magnitude of what he calls the tectonic \r\nshifts that are shaping the emerging global landscape. \r\nSecondly, he has emphasized the diverse and numerous \r\nchannels of interaction between nations and societies \r\nthat shape the high level of interdependence that, for \r\nbetter or for worse, unites us. Thirdly, he has identified \r\nthe most relevant emerging issues affecting \r\ntransnational phenomena. Fourthly, he has also stressed \r\nthe increasing speed with which human endeavours are \r\nglobalizing. \r\n In short, if we see the situation as an equation in \r\nwhich, on the one hand, there is a demand for \r\ntransnational efforts, and on the other, a response to or \r\noffer of such efforts, the demand side of the equation is \r\nbroad, diverse and complex. Indeed, humanity is facing \r\nchallenges that require international cooperation as \r\nnever before. The Secretary-General provides some \r\nexamples in his report, referring to the impact of the \r\nfinancial and economic crisis on the feasibility of \r\nmeeting the Millennium Development Goals, the \r\nchallenge of climate change, the risks of the influenza \r\nH1N1 pandemic, food insecurity, the proliferation of \r\nconventional arms and weapons of mass destruction, \r\nand countering terrorism. We believe that he should \r\nhave added to that list the fight against transnational \r\ncrime.  \r\n In any event, there is no question that no single \r\ncountry among us, large or small, is equipped to \r\nconfront these challenges on its own. For that reason, \r\nwhen we look at the other side of the equation for \r\naddressing the challenges — that is, the response or \r\nsupply side of transnational efforts — the Secretary-\r\nGeneral is correct in pointing out the imperative of \r\nexploiting the vast potential of multilateralism, and, \r\nwithin it, of the United Nations.  \r\n Today as in the past, the world needs our \r\nOrganization. It is a well-worn platitude to say that if \r\nthe United Nations did not exist, it would have to be \r\ninvented. That is undoubtedly true, but one might well \r\nwonder whether or not it would be better to invent a \r\nnew organization instead of working under the weight \r\nof the old petrified structures and working methods \r\nthat so frequently slow down our work. I want to make \r\nit clear that I am not advocating for such a radical \r\ndeparture. I simply want to make the point of how \r\nurgent reform is. \r\n In that regard, following the logic of that \r\nargument, demand changes and expands very rapidly, \r\nwhile the capacity of the Organization to respond \r\nchanges at glacial speed. Topics such as the reform of \r\nthe Security Council, the revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly and system-wide coherence, which have \r\nbeen on the agenda for many years, attest to the \r\nsluggishness that characterizes our own capacity to \r\nadapt to changing circumstances. The report may well \r\nfall short on that score, urging us to accelerate our \r\nefforts in bringing about the rather modest progress \r\nachieved in recent years in promoting the \r\norganizational, structural and normative changes that \r\nwill be needed in “defining the nature of \r\nmultilateralism in the new century” (A/64/1, \r\npara. 155).  \r\n This year we will have the opportunity to make \r\nprogress in that direction. We will have to approve the \r\nregular and peacekeeping budgets, as well as the scale \r\nof assessments for their financing. We will have to find \r\na way to respond to the single most important pending \r\nmatter, namely, the reform of the Security Council, \r\nwhich would decidedly spark the reform of the United \r\nNations system of governance. We will have to prepare \r\nourselves to carry out an in-depth assessment of the \r\ndegree of attainment of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. We are poised to address a matter that could \r\nliterally define the future of humankind at the \r\nCopenhagen Conference of the Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change. \r\nWe also have before us important decisions concerning \r\ndisarmament, respect for human rights and \r\ninternational cooperation in general. \r\n Are we up to meeting the challenges? Part of the \r\nanswer must be sought within this universal forum, \r\nnamely, the General Assembly. Of course it is difficult \r\nto reconcile the sometimes opposing interests of \r\n192 Member States. It is equally difficult to face the \r\npowerful interests in the real world around us, which \r\nare affected by the recommendations and actions \r\npromoted by the United Nations. At the end of the day, \r\nhowever, a climate of cooperation must prevail over \r\nconfrontation if we are to have at least an opportunity \r\n A/64/PV.14\r\n \r\n15 09-54337 \r\n \r\nto address the major problems affecting humankind, \r\namong which we rank first providing the inhabitants of \r\nthe planet with a level of material and spiritual welfare \r\ncompatible with the means and knowledge that are at \r\nour disposal. We know what we have to do to eradicate \r\npoverty. We should now move on to action. \r\n Of course, adapting the Organization is not \r\nexclusively the work of intergovernmental bodies. The \r\nSecretariat and the specialized agencies and \r\nprogrammes all have a role to play. The responsibility \r\nfalling to the Secretary-General is therefore daunting. \r\nFor our part, we acknowledge the enormous effort of \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon to live up to his \r\nresponsibilities and we appreciate the transparency of \r\nhis efforts, as reflected in his periodic meetings with \r\nthe General Assembly to inform us about his activities. \r\n I would like to take this opportunity early in our \r\nwork during the sixty-fourth session of the General \r\nAssembly, and on today’s agenda item, to reiterate the \r\ncommitment of our delegation to do everything within \r\nour power so that the United Nations can respond in a \r\nconstructive and positive manner to the great \r\nchallenges described in the Secretary-General’s report. \r\n Mr. Sinhaseni (Thailand): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the 10 States members of the \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), \r\nnamely, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, the \r\nLao People’s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, \r\nMyanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and \r\nViet Nam. \r\n At the outset, may I join the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly in expressing condolences to our \r\nfellow ASEAN member countries of Indonesia, the \r\nPhilippines and Samoa for the natural disasters that \r\nrecently befell them.  \r\n ASEAN wishes to thank the Secretary-General \r\nfor his report on the work of the Organization (A/64/1).  \r\n The world today faces multiple global crises. It \r\nhas become clear that, as the world becomes ever more \r\ninterconnected, no country can solve such crises alone. \r\nMany challenges — for example, climate change, \r\ninfluenza and the world economic crisis — require \r\nunity of purpose, harmony of effort and a spirit of \r\ncooperation from all parties, large and small, rich and \r\npoor.  \r\n ASEAN fully concurs with the report of the \r\nSecretary-General that we are now at a critical \r\nmultilateral moment. Although imperfect, the United \r\nNations, with its universal membership and legitimate \r\nconvening power, still stands out as the best instrument \r\nthere is to harmonize interests and bring the world \r\ncommunity together to advance the global public good. \r\nThe onus is upon each and every Member State to live \r\nup to the expectations of our peoples and transform this \r\ncritical time of crisis into a real opportunity to \r\nstrengthen this collective institution that we all own. \r\nThis is a time that will test the collective commitment, \r\nresolve and unity of all Member States. \r\n As it has always been, ASEAN will continue to \r\nbe a strong and consistent supporter of the \r\nmultilateralism that is embodied in the United Nations. \r\nIn our own region, ASEAN will continue to do all it \r\ncan to advance the goals and principles enshrined in \r\nthe Charter. I would now like to share with the \r\nAssembly ASEAN’s views on some critical issues.  \r\n First, ASEAN attaches great importance to \r\ndevelopment. We are therefore concerned about the \r\nimpact of the world financial and economic crisis on \r\nthe development of countries around the world, in \r\nparticular those that are most vulnerable to external \r\nshocks. We are concerned that, although developed \r\neconomies have been significantly affected by this \r\nmost recent crisis, it is the poor and vulnerable people \r\nin developing economies who are being hit hardest and \r\nlongest by this downturn, which was triggered in \r\nanother corner of the world. We are concerned that the \r\neconomic crisis, when coupled with the food security \r\nand energy crises, which have already caused strains in \r\ndeveloping countries, not only will prevent those \r\ncountries from realizing their Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs), but could reverse the hard-won gains. \r\n Here, ASEAN has made clear its concern, which \r\nderived from our own first-hand experience during the \r\neconomic crisis of the late 1990s, at various meetings \r\nof the United Nations, as well as at the Group of 20 \r\nsummits in London and, more recently, in Pittsburgh. \r\nWe will continue to stand with the United Nations in \r\nemphasizing the human face of this economic crisis \r\nand the necessity of assisting the poor and vulnerable \r\npopulations in developing countries. \r\n The current world economic crisis has provided \r\nan impetus for ASEAN to strive for broader and deeper \r\neconomic integration among the 10 ASEAN countries \r\nand between ASEAN and its regional partners, such as \r\nChina, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Australia, New \r\nA/64/PV.14  \r\n \r\n09-54337 16 \r\n \r\nZealand and India. While pushing for greater \r\nintegration, ASEAN has also moved ahead with efforts \r\nto strengthen social safety nets in the region in order to \r\ncushion our population from the adverse impacts of the \r\ncrisis.  \r\n ASEAN has been working closely with our Plus \r\nThree partners — China, Japan and the Republic of \r\nKorea — to strengthen that regional self-help financial \r\nmechanism through the establishment of a regional \r\nreserve pooling arrangement under the Chiang Mai \r\nInitiative Multilateralization (CMIM), with a total fund \r\nof $120 billion. We look forward to the launching of \r\nthe CMIM by the end of 2009. ASEAN and its Plus \r\nThree partners have also agreed to develop a regional \r\nsurveillance mechanism to monitor and analyse \r\nregional economies and to support CMIM decision-\r\nmaking. \r\n ASEAN will play its role in the preparations for \r\nthe upcoming MDG summit next year and will \r\ncontinue to emphasize to the international community \r\nthat, unless we all translate the summit into meaningful \r\nchanges on the ground, in 2015 we will end up with \r\nunfulfilled targets and promises. \r\n Secondly, tackling climate change is not a matter \r\nof luxury for ASEAN but an issue of utmost necessity. \r\nYear after year, ASEAN countries endure severe \r\nweather patterns resulting from climate change, all of \r\nwhich entail enormous damage in terms both of human \r\nlives and of economic losses. Memories of Cyclone \r\nNargis, which struck Myanmar last year, and the latest \r\nmassive tropical storms that have hit the Philippines \r\nand many countries in South-East Asia offer a stark \r\nreminder of what is at stake to all the negotiators who \r\nare currently meeting in Bangkok at this very moment \r\nfor their penultimate round of negotiations before the \r\nCopenhagen meeting in December. The message from \r\nnature to all those participating in the negotiations is \r\nclear: either we put aside our individual interests and \r\nstrive for a compromise that has the collective interests \r\nof all at heart, or we all risk even more severe weather \r\npatterns in the future. In short, it is a choice between \r\nwin-win and lose-lose. \r\n In the same vein, ASEAN believes that countries \r\nshould use this moment to promote greater investment \r\nin green technologies in order to build a green \r\neconomy. Such technologies should be made accessible \r\nand affordable to countries that are in need. ASEAN \r\nalso believes that international cooperation and \r\nassistance to strengthen the mitigation and adaptation \r\ncapacities of developing countries, including in the \r\nform of funding mechanisms, should be further \r\nstrengthened and expanded. \r\n Thirdly, ASEAN is determined to strengthen its \r\nalready strong partnership with the United Nations in \r\nthe area of humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. \r\nWe are pleased with past and ongoing cooperation with \r\nthe United Nations humanitarian agencies in South-\r\nEast Asia, for example in Myanmar in the aftermath of \r\nCyclone Nargis and the humanitarian operations in \r\nIndonesia and the Philippines following earthquakes \r\nand tropical storms, respectively. We are also moving \r\nahead to strengthen the region’s cooperative framework \r\nin that area. The ASEAN Agreement on Disaster \r\nManagement and Emergency Response is scheduled to \r\nbe implemented at the end of this year. That Agreement \r\nwould provide a solid basis for further cooperation \r\nwith the United Nations system on disaster reduction \r\nand emergency response. \r\n Fourthly, in this globalized era, peace, stability \r\nand security in one region are intertwined with peace, \r\nstability and security in every region. As the saying \r\ngoes, no country or region is an island unto itself. \r\nASEAN thus believes that the goals and principles \r\nenshrined in the Charter have become even more, not \r\nless, relevant. ASEAN strongly believes that the United \r\nNations remains an indispensable pillar for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. We \r\nsupport the comprehensive approach to peace and \r\nsecurity of the United Nations, which has sought to \r\nstrengthen the Organization’s capacity in conflict \r\nprevention, peacekeeping and peacebuilding.  \r\n We are committed to supporting the agenda of \r\ngeneral and complete disarmament. We welcome recent \r\npositive developments in that field, such as the \r\nadoption of the programme of work of the Conference \r\non Disarmament, the negotiations between the United \r\nStates and the Russian Federation on a new legally \r\nbinding agreement, and the recent adoption by the \r\nSecurity Council of resolution 1887 (2009) on nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation and disarmament. \r\n ASEAN strongly believes in the goal of a \r\nnuclear-weapon-free world. We fully support the \r\nestablishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in various \r\nparts of the world as positive steps and important \r\nmeasures towards attaining the objective of nuclear \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation. We will actively \r\n A/64/PV.14\r\n \r\n17 09-54337 \r\n \r\nparticipate in the forthcoming Second Conference of \r\nStates Parties and Signatories of Treaties that Establish \r\nNuclear-Weapon-Free Zones and in the Review \r\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in 2010. At this \r\nsession of the Assembly, ASEAN will propose a draft \r\nresolution on the South-East Asia Nuclear-Weapon-\r\nFree-Zone. ASEAN hopes that the draft resolution will \r\nreceive strong support from fellow Member States, as \r\nin the past. \r\n Fifthly, ASEAN is taking significant steps in the \r\narea of human rights. During their recent meeting in \r\nThailand in July, the ASEAN foreign ministers \r\nendorsed the terms of reference of the ASEAN \r\nIntergovernmental Commission on Human Rights. The \r\nCommission is scheduled to be officially established \r\nduring the upcoming ASEAN summit in Thailand at \r\nthe end of this month. ASEAN envisions the \r\nCommission as an evolving body and believes that its \r\nestablishment will significantly advance the cause of \r\nhuman rights in the region. \r\n Finally, ASEAN agrees with the report of the \r\nSecretary-General that the United Nations needs to \r\nadapt to the new environment by being modern, \r\nefficient, nimble and more accountable in its \r\nadministration. ASEAN is of the view that the United \r\nNations should be more efficient in its capacity to \r\ndeliver services to those in need in the field, while \r\nensuring coherence and coordination among all \r\nrelevant agencies within the system. \r\n However, in this complex world of multiple \r\ncrises, it is clear that the United Nations cannot and \r\nshould not be expected to do everything. The United \r\nNations should focus on its comparative advantages \r\nand work closely with partners in various sectors. It is \r\nin that context that ASEAN welcomes efforts by the \r\nUnited Nations to strengthen partnerships with regional \r\norganizations around the world. We welcome the \r\nreference in the report of the Secretary-General to \r\nclose partnership between the United Nations and \r\nASEAN. \r\n This year, ASEAN has begun a new chapter in the \r\nhistory of the organization with the entry into force of \r\nthe ASEAN Charter. The 10 ASEAN countries are \r\nmoving ahead with ASEAN community-building \r\nprocesses. We firmly believe that a strong and resilient \r\nASEAN will be a strong and effective partner for \r\ncountries in the region and for the United Nations. That \r\nis our commitment. \r\n Mr. Takasu (Japan): First of all, I wish to express \r\nmy deep appreciation to Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon for his dedication to leading the wide-ranging \r\nactivities of the Organization. \r\n The most pressing challenge before the United \r\nNations is to achieve the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). The global economic and financial \r\ncrisis has seriously affected the efforts of many \r\ndeveloping countries to achieve the MDGs. All means \r\navailable to us should be mobilized towards the target \r\nyear of 2015. We should sharpen our focus on the \r\ndevelopment agenda towards the high-level meeting to \r\nbe held next year. \r\n Pursuit of the reduction of poverty alone will not \r\nlead to the achievement of the MDGs. Large segments \r\nof the bottom billion poor are trapped in conflict or \r\nstruggling for survival in fragile situations. About half \r\nof post-conflict countries have relapsed into conflict \r\nwithin 10 years. \r\n The end of conflict should be accompanied by \r\nvisible changes in everyday life, and the arrival of \r\npeace by immediate efforts to strengthen social and \r\neconomic stability. In order to end the vicious cycle of \r\nconflict and poverty, it is essential to tackle both in an \r\nintegrated manner. The Peacebuilding Commission is \r\nthe key organ for promoting such an integrated strategy \r\nand to fill some of these gaps. \r\n Human security advocates a human-centred and \r\nintegrated approach aimed at realizing every \r\nindividual’s freedom from fear and want. Human \r\nsecurity pursues the bottom-up perspective, focusing \r\non not only the protection, but also the empowerment \r\nof the individual and the community. Therefore, the \r\nhuman security approach is essential to achieving the \r\nMDGs and peacebuilding efforts. \r\n We wish to see the human security perspective \r\nproperly and well reflected within the work of the \r\nUnited Nations. The recent decision (resolution \r\n63/311) on system-wide coherence among gender-\r\nrelated activities, for instance, will also benefit from \r\nthe human security approach. We commend the work \r\ndone by the Friends of Human Security over the past \r\ntwo or three years. We very much look forward to the \r\ndebate of the General Assembly on that issue during \r\nthis session. \r\nA/64/PV.14  \r\n \r\n09-54337 18 \r\n \r\n Peacekeeping and peacebuilding are, obviously, \r\nthe core activities of the United Nations. Peacekeeping \r\noperations and special political missions are \r\ncontinuously expanding, and sometimes even \r\noverstretching our capacities. The relevant United \r\nNations organs should collectively elaborate \r\nimprovement measures to manage them effectively \r\nunder clear and achievable mandates. It is essential, \r\ntherefore, to ensure that all stakeholders, troop-\r\ncontributing countries, police-contributing countries \r\nand donors be closely involved in the planning, \r\nmanaging and evaluating of peacekeeping operations. \r\n With regard to peace, we welcome the current \r\npositive movement towards global nuclear \r\ndisarmament. As the only country that has suffered \r\nnuclear devastation, we are determined to stop nuclear \r\nproliferation and to work with others for the \r\nelimination of nuclear weapons. \r\n As we approach the 2010 Review Conference of \r\nthe Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons, we find ourselves at a critical \r\njuncture. We must take a crucial step towards the \r\ncreation of a world free of nuclear weapons. Japan will \r\nsubmit a draft resolution during this session to lay out \r\nmeasures towards the total elimination of nuclear \r\nweapons and we appeal for support in this regard. \r\n Climate change is another major challenge \r\nconfronting humanity. We must mobilize our efforts \r\nand innovative technology towards reaching an \r\nagreement on an effective post-2013 regime during the \r\nUnited Nations Climate Change Conference in \r\nCopenhagen. Japan highly commends the initiative of \r\nthe Secretary-General to raise political momentum by \r\norganizing the Summit on Climate Change. \r\n At the opening meeting of the Summit, Japan’s \r\nPrime Minister Yukio Hatoyama announced Japan’s \r\nmid-term target to reduce its emissions by 25 per cent \r\nby 2020 from 1990 levels. He also introduced the \r\nHatoyama Initiative, which aims at supporting the \r\nefforts of developing countries through technology and \r\nfinancial assistance. Japan will play a leading role \r\ntowards the successful conclusion of the Copenhagen \r\nConference through such initiatives. \r\n It is also essential for the United Nations to \r\ncontinue to protect and promote human rights as one of \r\nits three pillars. Even after the sixtieth anniversary of \r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights, serious \r\nviolations of human rights remain unabated in many \r\nparts of the world. Japan supports mainstreaming the \r\nhuman rights approach throughout all United Nations \r\nactivities. \r\n United Nations reform will not be complete \r\nwithout meaningful Security Council reform. Japan \r\nwelcomes the good progress made in the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations since last February. The \r\nGeneral Assembly adopted the decision to immediately \r\ncontinue the intergovernmental negotiations during this \r\nsixty-fourth session, building upon progress made so \r\nfar. \r\n Japan believes that the Security Council needs to \r\nbe reformed by expanding both permanent and \r\nnon-permanent membership in order to reflect the \r\nreality of the world in which we live. We are pleased \r\nwith President Treki’s emphasis on the need for \r\nexpeditious reform of the Security Council. We hope \r\nthat a concrete outcome will be achieved at this session \r\nunder his able guidance and leadership. \r\n Japan attaches great importance to transparent, \r\naccountable and efficient management of the United \r\nNations. Japan welcomes and supports the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s determination to make a more efficient and \r\nresponsive Secretariat. However, as the world economy \r\naffects the Member States’ financial situations, the \r\ntrend whereby the United Nations continues to expand \r\nits regular and peacekeeping budgets is no longer \r\nsustainable. It is important to make the Secretariat \r\nmore efficient and dynamic in order to fulfil its \r\nmandates at an affordable level for Member States. \r\n To that end, the Secretariat should work \r\ndiligently to prioritize expenditures and find less costly \r\nways to implement mandated activities. New \r\nrequirements should be met in principle through the \r\ndeployment of available resources. We should maintain \r\nstronger financial discipline in planning and \r\nimplementing the 2010-2011 programme budget, as \r\nwell as the peacekeeping operations budget. \r\n Let me conclude by reiterating Japan’s strong \r\ncommitment to creating an effective and better \r\nfunctioning United Nations. \r\n Mr. Núñez Mosquera (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nWe thank the Secretary-General for presenting his \r\nannual report on the work of the Organization \r\n(A/64/1). We agree with its accurate analysis of the \r\ncurrent situation of the world, plunged into an acute \r\neconomic and financial crisis with devastating effects \r\n A/64/PV.14\r\n \r\n19 09-54337 \r\n \r\nfor all countries, in particular for the developing \r\nnations, which, although not responsible for it, are the \r\nones to suffer most from its disastrous consequences. \r\n Since the adoption of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals in 2000, our country has warned \r\nthat those very modest targets would not be achieved \r\nunless the existing unfair and unbalanced international \r\neconomic order was radically changed. Today, we \r\nendorse that prediction, given the multiple crises that \r\nare collectively striking the countries of the South and \r\nthat, in turn, are the result of a structural crisis of \r\ncapitalism, exacerbated by neoliberal policies that \r\npromote an economic model based on unsustainable \r\nproduction, consumption and distribution patterns. We \r\ntherefore reiterate that the true cause of the failure to \r\nachieve the Goals and the other internationally agreed \r\ndevelopment objectives lies in the lack of political will \r\nshown so far by the developed countries. \r\n The report notes that additional financial \r\nresources are needed to address the growing needs of \r\nlow-income countries, and we agree. However, that is \r\nnot enough. The creation and implementation of \r\npolicies that focus on the human being and that \r\npromote the development of all countries are required. \r\nNevertheless, the prompt actions to rescue bankrupt \r\nfinancial institutions of the North contrast shamefully \r\nwith the meagre expenditure on official development \r\nassistance and the reluctance of the developed bloc to \r\ncommit to providing new and additional resources.  \r\n It is crucial to find collective solutions to global \r\nproblems not only to promote development, but also \r\nfor the very survival of the human race. In that regard, \r\nthe report’s acknowledgement that the United Nations \r\nmust play a key role in addressing the multiple crises \r\ncurrently threatening the world and use this historical \r\nmoment to promote progress is fundamental. However, \r\nthat progress will not be possible without a new \r\ninternational economic order, founded on sustainable \r\ndevelopment and the creation of wealth on the basis of \r\njustice and fairness, the economic and financial \r\ninstitutions of which, under the aegis of the United \r\nNations, make promoting development their main \r\nobjective. \r\n In that context, we believe the recent United \r\nNations Conference at the Highest Level on the World \r\nFinancial and Economic Crisis and its Impact on \r\nDevelopment to be an important first step, which we \r\nhope can be complemented and advanced by the work \r\nof the open-ended working group of the General \r\nAssembly that will follow up on the issues addressed at \r\nthat event. \r\n As one of the United Nations system’s responses \r\nto the crisis, the report mentions the establishment of a \r\nGlobal Impact and Vulnerability Alert System that will \r\ntrack the impact of global crises on the poor and the \r\nmost vulnerable people. We hope that such a system \r\nwill be a useful tool and not mere repetition of the data \r\nand proof that we already have. What we need is not a \r\ndiagnosis, but urgent and viable solutions. Therefore, \r\nwe believe that we must consider establishing a system \r\nthat monitors the responses being made to the crises, in \r\nparticular responses arising from those who are really \r\nresponsible, as well as the actual effects of such \r\nresponses on the countries most affected. \r\n The phenomenon of climate change attracts \r\nparticular attention in view of the Copenhagen \r\nconference. The last summit on climate change \r\nconvened by the Secretary-General reaffirmed the main \r\nconcerns of the developing world regarding the need \r\nfor financing and the transfer of technology and know-\r\nhow so as to advance the processes of adaptation and \r\nmitigation. It is clear to all that the success of those \r\nnegotiations will depend to a large extent on the will of \r\nthe developed countries to meet their commitments and \r\nto set themselves new and more ambitious goals in line \r\nwith their historical responsibility and with their \r\necological debt to humankind. \r\n We uphold the need both for the United Nations \r\nand for its in-depth reform and democratization. \r\nHowever, that must be done by respecting its Charter, \r\nnot by redrafting it or by distorting its purposes and \r\nprinciples. The main challenge facing us is reforming \r\nthe United Nations so that it serves the interests of all \r\nnations equally. We cannot allow the reform to fail and \r\nto end up turning our Organization into an instrument \r\nthat serves the interests and whims of a few rich and \r\npowerful countries. \r\n The report covers the controversial issue of the \r\nresponsibility to protect while many important \r\nquestions and legitimate concerns surrounding that \r\nconcept have still not been properly addressed. It is up \r\nto the General Assembly to continue examining the \r\nmatter transparently and in depth and to take the \r\nappropriate decisions. Some are seeking to implement \r\nthe concept even before it is clearly defined. Cuba is \r\nagainst that, as it would open the way for turning the \r\nA/64/PV.14  \r\n \r\n09-54337 20 \r\n \r\nresponsibility to protect into an instrument that can be \r\neasily manipulated in order to attack the sacred \r\nprinciples of sovereignty, territorial integrity and \r\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of States. \r\n We must revitalize the leading role of the General \r\nAssembly, the only United Nations organ where there \r\nis no place for hegemonies, where we all have a voice \r\nand a vote, and where the obsolete right of the veto \r\ndoes not exist. On the other hand, we will not be able \r\nto talk about a true reform of this Organization until \r\nreal reform of the Security Council takes place. The \r\nintergovernmental negotiation process on Council \r\nreform that began last year has been an important step \r\nforward. However, it has not produced the concrete \r\nresults that we hoped. We trust real progress will be \r\nmade during this session. We urgently need a truly fair \r\nand representative Security Council that acts on behalf \r\nof all and within its mandate under the Charter, without \r\nencroaching on the functions and prerogatives of the \r\nsystem’s other bodies, as is increasingly happening. \r\n Concerning the chapter of the report on \r\nhumanitarian affairs, we reaffirm the importance of \r\ncontinuing to work to improve effectiveness and \r\ntimeliness in the coordination of United Nations \r\nhumanitarian assistance. We reaffirm the validity of the \r\ngoverning principles of humanitarian assistance \r\nrecognized in Assembly resolution 46/182. The report \r\nrefers to United Nations humanitarian assistance \r\nactions in response to some 55 emergencies in the \r\nperiod under consideration, but only a few of these are \r\nmentioned. We would have appreciated more \r\ninformation on the others. \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n With respect to reform of the United Nations \r\nsystem, we believe it is essential to take into account \r\nthe vision of the countries of the South, the majority of \r\nwhich are affected by those humanitarian emergencies. \r\nWe recognize the work being done by the Central \r\nEmergency Response Fund. On the other hand, the \r\nso-called cluster approach should receive \r\nintergovernmental consideration and analysis by \r\nMember States. \r\n Cuba reaffirms the importance of the principles \r\nof international cooperation and genuine dialogue on \r\nhuman rights. The use of political manipulation, \r\nselectivity and double standards in this area must be \r\neradicated. We must all prevent the current United \r\nNations human rights mechanisms, including the \r\nHuman Rights Council, from being affected by such \r\nvices. In that spirit, my country has participated \r\nactively in the creation of the Council and has taken \r\npart in its work with a great sense of responsibility. We \r\nhope the Council can continue to remain at a remove \r\nfrom the issues that defeated its predecessors. \r\n In his report the Secretary-General refers to \r\nsupport provided on the ground by the United Nations \r\ncountry teams so that States can implement \r\nrecommendations resulting from the universal periodic \r\nreview. In this regard, we are concerned that that \r\nreference is limited to the results of the review only as \r\nthey pertain to developing countries, where the country \r\nteams are present. It must not be forgotten that the \r\ncountries of the North must also be accountable to this \r\nmechanism for their human rights situations, including \r\nthose countries that have not yet been reviewed. We \r\nmust bear in mind that human rights are universal, \r\nindivisible and interdependent. \r\n As to the coherence of the United Nations, we \r\nconsider that this negotiation exercise must remain \r\nwithin the framework of intergovernmental \r\ndeliberations, since ultimately it will be the Member \r\nStates that make a decision concerning it. In this \r\nrespect, any proposal to reform operational activities \r\nmust reflect the development needs and priorities of \r\nrecipient countries. Operational activities, with their \r\ninherent diversity, cannot be required to follow \r\ninflexible formulas intended to be applied equally to \r\nall. Moreover, any initiative in this area by the \r\nSecretariat coordination mechanisms must be duly \r\npresented to Member States for appropriate \r\nconsideration and possible adoption. Here once again \r\nwe call upon the United Nations System Chief \r\nExecutives Board to respect intergovernmental \r\nmandates and substantially improve transparency and \r\naccountability for Member States. \r\n I would like to conclude by echoing the \r\nSecretary-General’s appeal in his report when he said: \r\n“Let us join together to make 2009 the year when \r\nwe remade the world, restoring global hope and \r\nsolidarity and renewing the foundation for \r\ninternational security and peace, sustainable \r\ndevelopment and human rights.” (A/64/1, \r\npara. 159)  \r\nGreat challenges lie ahead. More than ever, the world \r\nneeds the United Nations and our joint action. \r\n A/64/PV.14\r\n \r\n21 09-54337 \r\n \r\n Mr. Badji (Senegal) (spoke in French): Taking \r\nthe floor for the first time in the sixty-fourth session of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to reiterate, following the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Senegal, His Excellency \r\nMaitre Abdoulaye Wade, the hearty congratulations of \r\nthe Senegalese delegation on your election, \r\nMr. President, to your prestigious post. As you know, \r\nthe support of my delegation is something you can \r\ncount on in the performance of your important \r\nfunctions. As for the Secretary-General, there is hardly \r\nany need to reaffirm our great satisfaction with the \r\nexcellent manner in which he presides over the destiny \r\nof the Secretariat. \r\n Consideration of the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the work of the Organization (A/64/1) \r\noffers us an opportunity to examine the principal \r\nactivities of the United Nations, evaluate their \r\nrelevance and effectiveness and, ultimately, redirect \r\nthem. This task is facilitated, we should acknowledge, \r\nby the quality of the report, which has been submitted \r\nby the Secretariat. Combining concision and \r\nexhaustiveness, the report has missed no sphere of \r\nactivity of the United Nations, from the most modest \r\nconcerns to efforts to strengthen the Organization, all \r\nwhile safeguarding the welfare of humanity. \r\n There has been significant progress in all these \r\nareas, and as the Secretary-General tells us in his \r\nreport, the world today is more prosperous and \r\npeaceful than ever before, and the ideal of a universal \r\nnormative framework has never before been so close. \r\nBut those excluded from that prosperity and peace are \r\nso numerous that it seems to us that the particular \r\nneeds of Africa, of peacekeeping or of climate change \r\nshould have our greatest attention. Furthermore, we are \r\nof the opinion that universal acceptance of the \r\nnormative global framework that is the United Nations \r\nis largely dependent on speeding up and deepening the \r\nprocess of reform under way. \r\n With regard to the particular needs of Africa, the \r\nreport informs us that Africa’s average annual growth \r\nrate was 6 per cent in the period 2004 to 2008 and fell \r\nin 2009 to just 0.9 per cent, and that we can also expect \r\nan increase in unemployment and in precarious \r\nemployment, a result of the drop in export earnings and \r\ngovernment revenues. Such a situation shows that if \r\nthe effects of the financial crisis on the developed \r\ncountries are beginning to dissipate, its consequences \r\nfor African economies are far from diminishing, \r\nparticularly with regard to the serious threat that the \r\ncrisis poses for our capacity to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. \r\n With regard to the world food crisis, though it has \r\ncertainly been eclipsed in the Western media by other \r\nevents, it remains a heavy burden draining our \r\neconomies, and, according to recent estimates, nearly \r\n300 million Africans suffer chronic hunger. The \r\nparadox of this untenable situation is that solutions to \r\nconquer hunger in the world are known, but the means \r\nto implement them are lacking.  \r\n The enormous means immediately mobilized in \r\nresponse to the financial crisis make clear that the \r\nresources to fight hunger definitely exist; the problem \r\nis that those resources are not at the disposal of the \r\npoor countries, especially in Africa, where the hungry \r\nlive. To point that out is not to run from our own \r\nresponsibilities but to affirm them, because for the \r\nmost part our countries have, within the limits of our \r\nrespective resources, undertaken the actions necessary \r\nto limit the effects of the crises. \r\n Clearly, solutions to the food, energy and \r\nfinancial crises will require much greater resources \r\nthan the budget lines the African countries assign to \r\nthem in national or even regional initiatives. That is \r\nwhy, while I welcome the Group of Eight’s decision to \r\nmobilize $20 billion to fight world hunger and to \r\npromote sustainable agriculture, I would like to express \r\nthe hope that that commitment be rapidly realized by \r\ninitiatives like the Global Partnership for Agriculture \r\nand Food Security launched 26 September last year by \r\nthe Secretary-General of the United Nations and \r\nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton. \r\n The report is unequivocal when it states that \r\nclimate change is the great challenge on which history \r\nwill judge our generation. In this regard the laudable \r\ninitiative that was the summit meeting of 22 September \r\n2009 allowed our heads of State and Government to \r\nsend a strong political message that we hope will be \r\nechoed in Copenhagen.  \r\n However, allow me to repeat here that, for Africa, \r\nthe urgency of the transition to a world economy more \r\nfrugal with carbon emissions is beyond all doubt. We \r\nare ready to make our contribution to the joint effort \r\nbefore us to lead to what it is being called the Global \r\nGreen New Deal — with the understanding, however, \r\nthat we do not consider that we have to endanger our \r\nown development. We need sufficient resources not \r\nonly to ensure the development of our respective \r\nA/64/PV.14  \r\n \r\n09-54337 22 \r\n \r\ncountries but also to take measures necessary to adapt \r\nto — and indeed to survive — the consequences of \r\nclimate change. In those consequences I include, \r\namong others, rising sea levels and floods, which \r\nalready take a heavy toll on our feeble economies. \r\n Africa, for its part, has already taken up arms \r\nagainst the pernicious effects of climate change by \r\nmeans of several diverse initiatives, among which is \r\nthe continental project, the Great Green Wall. This \r\nproject consists of a green swath 15 kilometres wide, \r\nstretching from Dakar to Djibouti, that, if it is realized, \r\nwill constitute a veritable supplemental green lung, to \r\nthe benefit of the entire planet. \r\n But whatever actions we the developing countries \r\ntake, and whatever commitments we agree to, one \r\nconstant remains: without a clear commitment on the \r\npart of the Annex 1 countries to make adequate \r\nresources available on a non-discriminatory basis, there \r\nis great danger that the tireless efforts we have \r\ndeployed since the December 2007 meeting in Bali \r\ntowards an acceptable and effective post-Kyoto regime \r\nwill, in Copenhagen this December, prove to have been \r\nin vain. \r\n On the subject of peacekeeping, the report \r\nrecounts the unprecedented size and complexity of the \r\ndifficulties faced by United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations. Given those circumstances, there is reason \r\nto welcome the important administrative reforms \r\ninitiated by the Secretary-General, which merit our \r\ncomplete support, especially the one relating to \r\ndeveloping a standing police capacity in a strengthened \r\nPolice Division. Senegal’s resolute commitment to \r\npeacekeeping and the attention its leaders give the \r\nissue can be clearly seen on a map of our deployment \r\nof troops on the ground.  \r\n We welcomed with great attention the reform \r\nproposals submitted by France, Canada and the United \r\nKingdom, as well as the ideas set out in the non-paper \r\njointly presented by the Department of Peacekeeping \r\nOperations and the Department of Field Support.  \r\n We believe it important to make it clear that one \r\nof the major challenges to peacekeeping at this time \r\nlies in operationalizing the mission to protect civilians. \r\nBy this I mean translating that goal into an operational \r\nstrategy and bringing it into conformity with other \r\nmission objectives, while respecting the neutrality and \r\nimpartiality that should guide all blue helmet \r\noperations.  \r\n Another challenge, no less important, is the \r\nquadrupling, in the space of ten years, of the overall \r\nbudget for peacekeeping operations, which without any \r\ndoubt constitutes a heavy burden on the international \r\ncommunity. While we understand the concern of some \r\ndelegations to find an immediate solution to such an \r\nexponential increase, we should keep in mind that a \r\nlack of predictability in programming financial \r\nresources for peacekeeping operations, or a drastic \r\nreduction in the budget through across-the-board cuts, \r\nwould not only undermine the fragile peace and \r\nstability in most of the intervention zones but would \r\nalso dampen the international community’s \r\ndevelopment efforts in those zones. \r\n The necessary condition for any success in the \r\nactivities of the Organization, including in the three \r\nkey areas I have mentioned, is to make the United \r\nNations a stronger Organization. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral has made a commitment to that goal and has \r\nmade it one of his primary concerns. That warrants our \r\npraise. The numerous reforms he has launched within \r\nthe Secretariat, which have just been supplemented by \r\nour recent decision to create an entity devoted solely to \r\nwomen’s issues, are important steps towards that \r\nstronger United Nations. \r\n But those advances will always feel unfulfilled \r\nwithout reform of the Security Council. The \r\nintergovernmental negotiations that we conducted since \r\nthe sixty-third session have made it even clearer that an \r\nagreement is within reach, provided that we all \r\ndemonstrate, for our own parts, an elevated sense of \r\nhistory. Thus, we hope that the present session will \r\nprovide the outcome to which we aspire. \r\n Mr. Natalegawa (Indonesia): I take this \r\nopportunity to thank the Secretary-General for his \r\nreport on the work of the Organization (A/64/1). \r\n We are meeting in the midst of new and old \r\nchallenges that need to be addressed collectively and \r\neffectively. These include the impacts of the multiple \r\ncrises — financial, food and energy. In the background \r\nis the force of climate change, slowly gathering \r\nspeed — not to mention the current rapid spread of \r\nH1N1 influenza. \r\n At the same time, we are still confronted by \r\nperennial problems, such as the challenges of \r\nachieving a nuclear-free world, persistent inter-State \r\nand intra-State conflicts, human rights violations, \r\ntransnational organized crime and, in particular, \r\n A/64/PV.14\r\n \r\n23 09-54337 \r\n \r\nterrorism. These are a set of cross-border challenges \r\nthat can be addressed only through a multilateral lens. \r\nRenewed international efforts and cooperation to tackle \r\nthe multifaceted threats become more pivotal. We must \r\nseize this moment to embrace new multilateralism: to \r\nwork in solidarity, in unity and in the interest of all. \r\n Thus, the need to perfect the triangle of \r\ndevelopment, freedom and peace has never been \r\ngreater. Central to such an effort is the strengthening of \r\nour multilateral institutional architecture, which should \r\nbe more robust and more proactive. In that context, we \r\nneed to ensure that the United Nations can truly be \r\nmore relevant by making it more democratic and \r\ncoherent. It is only through such efforts that the United \r\nNations can become a credible and reliable institution \r\ncapable of performing its functions and its mandate in \r\nline with Member States’ needs. \r\n In addressing the development imperative, we \r\nmust take into account the three systemic crises \r\naffecting us now: the financial, food and fuel crises. \r\nAgainst that bleak backdrop is the threat of climate \r\nchange. The most urgent task for us at this session is to \r\ndisentangle the global economy from the economic \r\ncrisis and recession. We all have made important \r\ncontributions to ensure progress, yet the underlying \r\ncauses of the crisis still have not been addressed fully \r\nor effectively. We need to ensure that we take action to \r\nfollow up on the outcome of the United Nations \r\nConference on the World Financial and Economic \r\nCrisis and Its Impact on Development, in full and in a \r\ntimely fashion. At the same time, our work at this \r\nsession must also create synergy with other processes. \r\n In the meantime, global food security remains \r\nelusive, with inadequate access and supply of food for \r\nthe majority of the world’s poor. With approximately \r\n1 billion people now suffering from hunger and \r\nmalnutrition, we cannot afford to keep this issue out of \r\nthe main focus of the United Nations. The Organization \r\nshould continue to play an active role in mainstreaming \r\nagricultural policies in the international development \r\nagenda. Central to that is the strengthening of \r\ninternational food security and social safety nets. \r\n With regard to climate change, in Copenhagen we \r\nneed to reach a comprehensive agreement that is \r\ninclusive, equitable and fair. The Summit on Climate \r\nChange, held in New York on 22 September, has \r\ngalvanized the political momentum to reach a \r\nconsensus. The negotiations should be guided by the \r\nBali Road Map, based on the principle of common but \r\ndifferentiated responsibilities and respective \r\ncapabilities. \r\n Although it is important to note that the \r\nnegotiations should be carried out under the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, \r\nthe United Nations process plays a crucial role in \r\nproviding a constructive way to inject political support \r\ninto the climate conference in Copenhagen. \r\n Concerning the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs), many developing countries have made good \r\nprogress. We are, however, concerned that the current \r\nglobal crises threaten to set back the progress made. \r\nGiven the very limited time until 2015, our work this \r\nyear must also be able to contribute concretely to our \r\nglobal efforts to achieve the MDGs. \r\n The United Nations should ensure active \r\nmonitoring and evaluation on the achievement of the \r\nMDGs, so as to provide valuable inputs for next year’s \r\nMDG review meeting. The role of the United Nations \r\non the global development agenda must be promoted. \r\n Indonesia deeply appreciates the expressions of \r\nsupport and solidarity by many on the occasion of the \r\ndevastating earthquake that recently hit Western \r\nSumatra. We also express condolences to our friends in \r\nthe Philippines, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Laos, India, \r\nSamoa, American Samoa, Tonga and others in the \r\nregion, who have also recently been struck by natural \r\ncalamities. \r\n The human and economic losses resulting from \r\nnatural disasters highlight the importance of \r\nintensifying joint emergency response to and \r\npreparedness for disasters, especially in developing \r\ncountries. In that context, the United Nations \r\nhumanitarian system should continue to mobilize funds \r\nand strengthen capacities, which are vital aspects in \r\naddressing emergencies throughout the world. \r\n The new spirit of multilateralism must also be \r\nutilized to address the long-standing peace and security \r\nchallenges confronting the world. Peace in the Middle \r\nEast is particularly crucial to long-term global stability. \r\nIndonesia remains fully supportive of the two-State \r\nsolution, in which Israel and Palestine would live side \r\nby side in peace, and in which the Palestinian State \r\nwould enjoy full, unqualified sovereignty and \r\nauthority. At this critical juncture, we wish to \r\nunderscore that the United Nations has a historical \r\nA/64/PV.14  \r\n \r\n09-54337 24 \r\n \r\nresponsibility to work to find a truly comprehensive \r\nand lasting peace in the Middle East.  \r\n Terrorism is a complex phenomenon. \r\nConsequently, the fight against it requires a \r\ncomprehensive approach. We must steadfastly combat \r\nterrorism without, however, resorting to repressive and \r\nundemocratic measures. The root causes, such as \r\npoverty and injustice, should also be urgently \r\naddressed. The United Nations can thus play a unique \r\nrole by building on various national and regional \r\nefforts to overcome the challenges of terrorism. \r\n We are now at a promising juncture in our efforts \r\nto achieve a world free from nuclear weapons. Given \r\nthe current positive atmosphere among Member States, \r\nStates parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons, nuclear-weapon States and \r\nnon-nuclear-weapon States should strive to agree on \r\nconcrete steps to ensure the attainment of the objective \r\nof total and complete disarmament and to strengthen \r\nnon-proliferation at the Review Conference next year. \r\nIn that context, the United Nations should continue to \r\nwork towards the revitalization of multilateral \r\ndisarmament efforts. \r\n With respect to peacekeeping, Indonesia \r\nwelcomes the ongoing discussions on the future \r\ndirection of United Nations peacekeeping operations. \r\nWe should ensure that that process provides a \r\nframework on such operations that builds a strong \r\nglobal partnership encouraging ownership on the part \r\nof all stakeholders. In addition, we should not neglect \r\nthe potential role of women in peacekeeping \r\noperations. However, peacekeeping is not a panacea for \r\ndealing with the root causes of conflict; its potential \r\nlies in creating a favourable environment so that \r\npolitical processes can advance. \r\n We need to reaffirm that all human rights are \r\nuniversal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated \r\nand must, therefore, be treated in a fair and equal \r\nmanner, on the same footing and with the same \r\nemphasis as that placed on other issues in the United \r\nNations. In order to advance the work of the Human \r\nRights Council, the General Assembly must provide \r\nstrategic guidance. The United Nations should also \r\nstrengthen its advocacy efforts and take concrete steps \r\nto integrate human rights into all aspects of its work. \r\n On the issue of the responsibility to protect, \r\nprevention is key. Deliberations should focus on the \r\neffort to strengthen the capacity of Member States to \r\nmeet the requirements of good governance and the rule \r\nof law. To that end, the General Assembly should \r\ninclude a comprehensive and clear strategy aimed at \r\nstrengthening those objectives. \r\n Understandably, not all solutions lie with the \r\nUnited Nations, but its relevance cannot be \r\noverestimated. We should invest in more-adequate \r\nresources for the United Nations. The United Nations \r\nshould also make every effort to be more transparent, \r\ndemocratic, effective and efficient in fulfilling its \r\nmandate. \r\n We need a reformed Security Council that is \r\ncredible and that reflects the plurality of our world \r\ntoday. The role of the General Assembly should be \r\nreaffirmed as the chief deliberative, policymaking and \r\nrepresentative organ of the United Nations. The \r\nEconomic and Social Council needs to be empowered, \r\nso that it can advocate and coordinate policy on all \r\naspects of development, especially in an era of \r\ninterlinked crises. \r\n While there is no certainty as to what the future \r\nholds, if history is our teacher, then there is hope that \r\nwe can prepare better for what lies ahead. For that \r\npurpose, the culture of work in the United Nations \r\nmust be reformed. We must ensure that results-based \r\nmanagement, good governance, transparency and \r\naccountability are integral parts of management in the \r\nUnited Nations system. That is what system-wide \r\ncoherence is all about. \r\n Let me conclude by emphasizing that the \r\nchallenges we face today are immense. Our success \r\nwill be defined in terms of how we can address the \r\nchallenges of development, peace and security and \r\nhuman rights, all on an equal footing and with the \r\nUnited Nations at the centre of the effort. \r\n Mr. Puri (India): I would like to begin by \r\nthanking the Secretary-General for the comprehensive \r\nnature of his report on the work of the Organization \r\n(A/64/1). Given the global nature of today’s \r\nchallenges, the Secretary-General rightly noted that \r\nthis is the ultimate multilateral moment. It is therefore \r\nimperative that the United Nations embody the hope of \r\nthe new multilateralism. \r\n The Secretary-General has identified five \r\nessential elements for a renewal of multilateralism. \r\nWhile we are in broad agreement with regard to the \r\nelements identified, it is evident that the fifth \r\n A/64/PV.14\r\n \r\n25 09-54337 \r\n \r\nelement — reform of the global multilateral \r\narchitecture — holds the key to progress on the other \r\nelements. \r\n Efforts to promote a new multilateralism have \r\nlittle chance of success without comprehensive reform \r\nof global governance structures. The ongoing financial \r\ncrisis has further highlighted the urgent need to take \r\nconcrete action in order to restructure international \r\ngovernance architectures in a manner that reflects \r\ncurrent realities and provides for the enhanced \r\nrepresentation of developing countries. \r\n If we want our multilateral institutions to be able \r\nto counter current and emerging challenges, we cannot \r\ncontinue with structures that date from the Second \r\nWorld War and do not reflect the current and emerging \r\nglobal realities. Small steps, such as an enhanced role \r\nfor the Group of 20, are a beginning, but certainly not \r\nthe end. In that context, there is a critical need at the \r\nUnited Nations for an expansion in both the permanent \r\nand the non-permanent membership of the Security \r\nCouncil and an improvement in its working methods. \r\n We are happy that a unanimous decision was \r\nrecently taken to resume immediately the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform. The decision to build on the progress already \r\nachieved allows us to focus now on what is the opinion \r\nof the overwhelming majority: that there should be an \r\nexpansion in both the permanent and the \r\nnon-permanent categories. \r\n We are still grappling with the adverse effects of \r\nan unprecedented global economic and financial crisis. \r\nDeveloping countries, in which the crisis did not \r\noriginate, have been the most affected. It is imperative \r\nthat stimulus efforts and other actions to help \r\ndeveloping countries be continued and enhanced. At \r\nthis time, there is no place for protectionism in any \r\nform in the developed countries. \r\n The Secretary-General has eloquently brought out \r\nthe direct correlation between resource availability and \r\nprogress in achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). The fact that efforts by developing \r\ncountries to achieve the MDGs have been affected by \r\nthe economic and financial crisis demands that the \r\ninternational community significantly spur the \r\nprovision of greater assistance and investment flows to \r\ndeveloping countries. \r\n At the recently held mini-ministerial meeting of \r\ntrade ministers in New Delhi, we made major progress \r\ntowards revitalizing the Doha phase of multilateral \r\ntrade negotiations. We hope that the Doha Round will \r\nnow make progress towards an outcome that is \r\ndevelopment-oriented and can assist developing \r\ncountries in meeting their development goals. \r\n The Secretary-General has correctly highlighted \r\nclimate change as a top priority. We appreciate his \r\ninitiative in organizing the Summit on Climate Change \r\non 22 September 2009. As a country that is hugely \r\naffected by climate change, India will be part of the \r\nsolution and will push for an ambitious and equitable \r\noutcome at Copenhagen. The outcome must be in \r\naccordance with the provisions and principles of the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange — in particular, common but differentiated \r\nresponsibilities — and ensure that developing countries \r\ncan pursue their overriding development imperative of \r\npoverty eradication. We are also undertaking numerous \r\nmitigation and adaptation measures domestically to \r\naddress climate change. Many of these will have \r\nspecific, quantitative and time-bound goals.  \r\n On the multilateral side, there has to be a greater \r\nfocus on technology access for developing countries. \r\nThe United Nations must play a true facilitator’s role in \r\nproviding access to affordable and cost-effective \r\ntechnology for developing countries, as well as its \r\ntransfer to them. There is also no escaping the need to \r\nrevisit the intellectual-property-rights regime from the \r\nperspective of balancing rewards for innovators with \r\nthe common good of humankind. \r\n Peacekeeping remains the most visible United \r\nNations activity and also one that, perhaps more than \r\nany other, represents the aspiration of the Charter to \r\nprevent the scourge of war from afflicting societies. \r\nHowever, as things stand today, the United Nations has \r\nneither the resources nor the expertise to satisfactorily \r\nexecute many of its ambitious peacekeeping mandates. \r\nThere are countries that are willing and able to \r\ncontribute more in terms of resources. The challenge is \r\nin creating a framework that will enable the United \r\nNations to access and utilize those resources and \r\ncapacities. \r\n As a Member State that is closely associated with \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping, India will actively \r\ncontribute to building the renewed global partnership \r\non peacekeeping that the Secretary-General has called \r\nA/64/PV.14  \r\n \r\n09-54337 26 \r\n \r\nfor, including in the area of the rule of law and the \r\ndeployment of police units. I am happy that the work \r\nof India’s female formed police unit deployed in \r\nLiberia has been much appreciated. \r\n Peacebuilding is one of the United Nations \r\nactivities that must evolve significantly and quickly in \r\nthe coming years, given the huge needs in post-conflict \r\nsocieties. Of course, peacebuilding must be, first and \r\nforemost, a national process. But the international \r\ncommunity must be there to assist countries recovering \r\nfrom conflict.  \r\n Here again, I would like to reaffirm the \r\ncommitment of my Government to partner with the \r\nUnited Nations, this time in its peacebuilding efforts. \r\nIndia has unique combinations of the relevant \r\nexperience, expertise and capacities, which, we \r\nbelieve, are critical for nation-building in any part of \r\nthe world. \r\n We welcome the efforts made by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to use the opportunity of the sixtieth \r\nanniversary of the adoption of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights to strengthen Member \r\nStates advocacy efforts in the human rights field and to \r\ntake concrete steps to integrate human rights into all \r\naspects of the Organization’s work. \r\n While integrating human rights in the work of the \r\nUnited Nations, we should ensure that the development \r\nagenda pursued by the United Nations is not \r\nundermined by the introduction of new conditionalities \r\nin the provision of development assistance. One of the \r\npriorities on the human rights front should be to \r\nenhance the Organization’s commitment to making the \r\nright to development a reality sooner than later. \r\n India has consistently been of the view that the \r\nresponsibility to protect its population is one of the \r\nforemost responsibilities of every Member State. We \r\nagree with the Secretary-General that the consultations \r\non the application of the responsibility to protect to the \r\nfour mass atrocities he has identified and the emphasis \r\non the non-use of force should continue, and therefore \r\nwe sponsored General Assembly resolution 63/308. \r\nHowever, we need to be cognizant that creation of new \r\nnorms should include safeguards against their misuse. \r\nIn this context, the responsibility to protect should in \r\nno way provide a pretext for humanitarian intervention \r\nor unilateral action. \r\n We appreciate the progress made by the United \r\nNations Democracy Fund in the last four years. India \r\nwas one of the first countries to support its \r\nestablishment and has already contributed $20 million. \r\nLet me assure you that we will continue to be actively \r\nengaged in this Fund and its activities, which we \r\nbelieve contribute to the promotion of good and \r\nparticipative governance practices. \r\n Terrorism is the scourge of our times. It needs to \r\nbe combated with all the power at the command of the \r\ninternational community. While I am glad that the \r\nUnited Nations has been working on operationalizing \r\nthe Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, we believe it is \r\nessential for us to adopt, at this session, a \r\ncomprehensive convention against international \r\nterrorism, which has been in negotiations for over \r\nfifteen years. This would then provide a solid legal \r\nbasis for the fight against terrorism. \r\n India fully shares the concerns arising from the \r\nexistence of weapons of mass destruction and their \r\npossible acquisition by non-State actors and terrorists. \r\nIndia attaches the highest priority to the goal of \r\nuniversal nuclear disarmament and has an impeccable \r\nnon-proliferation record. Nuclear disarmament and \r\nnuclear non-proliferation are mutually reinforcing \r\nprocesses and thus require concerted and cooperative \r\ninternational efforts. We welcome the renewed global \r\ndebate on achieving a world free of nuclear weapons. \r\n India’s civilizational ethos of Vasudhaiva \r\nKutumbakam, we are one family, guides the way we \r\nperceive the work of the United Nations. We will do all \r\nthat we can to strengthen the United Nations and unite \r\nthe international community in order to address the \r\nworld’s problems through decisive action. In that spirit, \r\nthe Indian delegation looks forward to meaningful and \r\nresults-oriented discussions on the various items on the \r\nagenda of the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Davide (Philippines): Allow me to convey \r\nonce more, Sir, the Philippines’ congratulations on \r\nyour assumption of the presidency of our General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-fourth session. I am confident \r\nthat with your gifts of understanding and wisdom and \r\nthe wealth of your experience in multilateral \r\ndiplomacy, you would breathe fresh and invigorating \r\nair into the work of this most representative parliament \r\nof nations and crown your stewardship with victories. \r\n The Philippines also congratulates the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his comprehensive report on the work of \r\n A/64/PV.14\r\n \r\n27 09-54337 \r\n \r\nthe Organization (A/64/1). The report is, no doubt, a \r\nproduct of the mind, heart and soul of a man who \r\nwants nothing but a United Nations that can truly fulfil \r\nits vision and mission in these challenging times. The \r\nreport deserves careful consideration, not only here at \r\nthe seat of the United Nations, but also in our \r\nrespective capitals. His account of the state of the \r\nworld and of how the United Nations has grappled with \r\ntransboundary challenges illustrates the need for both \r\ncollective resolve and action on the part of the entire \r\nUnited Nations membership. \r\n In that regard, the Philippines fully aligns itself \r\nwith the statement delivered by the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Thailand on behalf of the \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations. Nonetheless, \r\nit wishes to stress a few points. \r\n My delegation supports the general principles \r\nenunciated in the Secretary-General’s recommendations \r\nfor a new multilateralism and his conclusions on forging \r\nan effective way forward with the United Nations at the \r\nhub of his call for a new multilateralism. This new \r\nmultilateralism calls for priority to be accorded to \r\ntransboundary challenges, such as climate change, \r\neconomic growth, food security, global health, \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation and the fight against \r\nterrorism. \r\n However, prioritization without a time-bound \r\nworkplan could lead to an interminable debate. For \r\nexample, the tendency to look beyond the high-level \r\nclimate change meeting in Copenhagen this coming \r\nDecember reveals the potential for indecisiveness in \r\nreaching concrete agreements in Copenhagen. \r\nCopenhagen must be a defining moment on climate \r\nchange, with the results of the Summit on Climate \r\nChange convened by the Secretary-General last \r\nSeptember kept in mind. Only residual issues or issues \r\non the modalities of implementation of agreed courses \r\nof action reached in Copenhagen should be remitted to \r\nthe next year’s climate change event in Mexico City. \r\n In the field of financing for development, in 2010 \r\nthe United Nations will organize the fourth high-level \r\nfollow-up conference on the Monterrey Consensus. \r\nParallel and marginal issues should not obscure the \r\nvery purpose of the Monterrey Consensus, namely, to \r\nallocate at least 0.7 per cent of gross national product \r\nof the developed countries to official development \r\nassistance (ODA) for the poor countries. Very few \r\ncountries have succeeded in meeting this target. This \r\nforthcoming conference should explore how most of \r\nthe developed countries could meet their ODA \r\ncommitment under the Monterrey Consensus in a \r\ntimely fashion and manner. \r\n On food security, there is a need to expand the \r\nhorizons of multilateral cooperation from the \r\ntraditional supply and demand dimension to include the \r\nfutures market and commodity trading in general, as \r\nthat market has the capacity to distort food security \r\nfactors through sheer commercial greed. There should \r\ntherefore be a specific time frame to consider how \r\nfutures markets can be mainstreamed into the food \r\nsecurity planning process.  \r\n Global health is another crucial area for global \r\ncooperation. The rapid manner in which nations, \r\ninternational organizations and the peoples of the \r\nworld have responded to pandemics such as the recent \r\nswine flu (H1N1) is indeed inspiring. However, actions \r\nin this regard have dealt mostly with post-outbreak \r\nmeasures. Of equal importance are pre-emptive or \r\npreventive measures, and that dimension of the work \r\nshould also be time-bound through a reporting system \r\nmonitored at the multilateral level. \r\n Nuclear disarmament and nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation deal with broad, highly politicized \r\nand sensitive concerns, which are nonetheless crucial \r\nin ensuring a sense of security for the world as a \r\nwhole. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons (NPT), whose parties meet every five years, \r\nstands out in the firmament of the disarmament regime. \r\nThe 2010 NPT Review Conference under the \r\nPhilippine presidency will meet next year after a long \r\nhibernation period characterized by lack of progress in \r\nthe accomplishment of its goals of nuclear \r\ndisarmament, nuclear non-proliferation and peaceful \r\nuses of nuclear energy.  \r\n Nonetheless, there are positive indicators that \r\naugur well for a successful 2010 NPT Review \r\nConference. While consensus on moving the NPT \r\nprocess forward is anticipated, every effort should also \r\nbe exerted to identify, wherever possible, areas of \r\nconvergence through time frames for implementation. \r\n The fight against terrorism, a detestable scourge \r\nat the national, regional and international levels, has \r\nincreased in intensity worldwide, and international \r\ncooperation in this area deserves to be sustained. To \r\nenhance the effectiveness of this global campaign, an \r\nagreed time-bound element is needed for the enactment \r\nA/64/PV.14  \r\n \r\n09-54337 28 \r\n \r\nof legislative and regulatory measures at the national \r\nlevel in the combat against terrorism. \r\n The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are \r\nthe best model of a time-bound international \r\ncooperative effort, establishing a 15-year period as the \r\nspecific target for the realization of the eight MDGs. \r\nThe achievement of the target goals is easily \r\nmeasurable and monitored. Unless the United Nations \r\ncontinues to specify time frames or timetables for \r\naccomplishing agreed courses of action, we will be \r\nhampered in our delivery of global public goods in a \r\ntimely fashion, particularly to our most vulnerable  \r\npopulations. The Philippines submits that specifying \r\ntime frames is a very effective way of re-engineering \r\nthe United Nations and should be at the core of a new \r\nmultilateralism. Otherwise, that multilateralism may be \r\nlost in the sound and fury of rhetoric. \r\n Finally, let me place on record the profound \r\ngratitude of the Philippines to Member States that have \r\nexpressed their condolences, sympathies and \r\ncompassion in the wake of the loss of life and \r\ndestruction of property that Typhoon Ketsana has \r\ncaused our country and our people. \r\nThe meeting rose at 1 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
