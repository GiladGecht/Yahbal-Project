(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) \r\n \r\n \r\n In the absence of the President, Mr. Hackett \r\n(Barbados), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3:10 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 107 (continued) \r\n \r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of the \r\nOrganization (A/64/1) \r\n \r\n Mr. Kim Bonghyun (Republic of Korea): First of \r\nall, I would like to thank the Secretary-General for his \r\nannual report on the work of the Organization \r\n(A/64/1), which provides a comprehensive and clear \r\noverview of what has been achieved over the last year \r\nand lays out a coherent blueprint for what must be \r\naccomplished in the future. As the Secretary-General \r\nsaid in his report, “We are seeing the convergence of \r\ncomplex challenges across a spectrum of issues that lie \r\nat the core of the United Nations mission” (A/64/1, \r\npara. 4). \r\n To confront these immense challenges and make \r\nthe world a safer and more prosperous place, the \r\ninternational community must work together more than \r\never before. In this regard, my delegation strongly \r\nsupports the idea that we should build on a new \r\nmultilateralism that contains the five essential elements \r\nreferred to in the Secretary-General’s report. We should \r\nengage in multilateral cooperation using the United \r\nNations as the platform and hub of that new \r\nmultilateralism. My delegation is fully committed to \r\nengaging actively and constructively in order to further \r\nadvance and restore global hope and solidarity. \r\n With less than six years left until the target year \r\nof 2015, the prospects of achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) in a timely fashion seem \r\nto be imperilled. The global economic crisis has had a \r\nnegative impact on achievement of the MDGs. It is \r\nestimated that between 73 and 103 million more people \r\nwill remain in extreme poverty this year, with women \r\nand children suffering disproportionately from the \r\nimpact of the crisis. The particularly difficult situation \r\nin sub-Saharan Africa demands more of our attention. \r\nNext year’s MDG Review Summit must play a crucial \r\nrole in summoning political will and inducing Member \r\nStates to redouble their efforts in order to make \r\nmeaningful use of the next five years. \r\n Based on its development experience, both as a \r\npartner country and a donor, the Republic of Korea will \r\nfulfil its pledge to triple its 2008 official development \r\nassistance (ODA) by 2015. In an effort to support the \r\nfight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in \r\nsub-Saharan Africa, we are mobilizing further \r\nresources through the air ticket solidarity levy. In \r\naddition, we are striving to improve the quality of \r\nODA by joining the Organization for Economic \r\nCooperation and Development (OECD) Development \r\nAssistance Committee in 2010, and we will continue to \r\ncontribute to strengthening the global partnership for \r\nmore inclusive and effective development cooperation \r\nby hosting the fourth High-Level Forum on Aid \r\nEffectiveness in 2011. \r\n As the Secretary-General has rightly pointed out, \r\nclimate change is the most pressing challenge of our \r\ntime. Responding to climate change has become an \r\nA/64/PV.15  \r\n \r\n09-54411 2 \r\n \r\nindispensable and urgent priority for all of humanity. In \r\nthat regard, my delegation greatly appreciates the \r\nleadership of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in \r\nplacing climate change at the top of the agenda and in \r\ngalvanizing global efforts to ensure a successful \r\noutcome of the Copenhagen Conference in December. \r\nMy delegation also appreciates such initiatives by the \r\nSecretary-General as convening the 22 September \r\nSummit on Climate Change, which helped demonstrate \r\nleaders’ strong political will to seal the deal in \r\nCopenhagen. The Republic of Korea, as a non-Annex I \r\ncountry, plans to announce its voluntary midterm \r\nmitigation target for 2020 before the end of this year. \r\nKorea has also proposed the establishment of a registry \r\nof nationally appropriate mitigation actions of \r\ndeveloping countries at the secretariat of the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, \r\nwith a view to inviting developing countries to \r\nparticipate voluntarily in mitigation. We hope that our \r\nefforts and proposals will contribute positively to \r\nsuccessful outcomes at Copenhagen. \r\n The United Nations peacekeeping operations face \r\nnew challenges in meeting ever-growing demands for \r\npeacekeeping with increasingly complex and \r\nmultidimensional mandates — far beyond what the \r\nBrahimi report (A/55/305) envisaged nearly 10 years \r\nago. My delegation welcomes the initiatives of \r\nMember States and the Secretary-General to \r\nreconfigure United Nations peacekeeping operations to \r\nmeet those new challenges. With regard to new \r\ninitiatives, my delegation wishes to emphasize two \r\nfactors critical to ensuring greater success: \r\nstrengthening partnerships among all the stakeholders \r\nand partners, and setting clear, credible and achievable \r\nmandates. In this connection, my delegation \r\nappreciates and welcomes the Secretary-General’s \r\n“New Horizon” initiative, emphasizing a new United \r\nNations peacekeeping partnership. \r\n As regards disarmament and nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation, my delegation shares the view that \r\nthere is encouraging momentum in the field, especially \r\ntowards achieving a world free of nuclear weapons, as \r\nstipulated in Security Council resolution 1887 (2009). \r\nWe highly appreciate the Secretary-General’s efforts in \r\nthis field, including his five-point proposal for nuclear \r\ndisarmament. The Republic of Korea is ready to \r\ncooperate with all Member States to take full \r\nadvantage of this window of opportunity for tangible \r\nprogress. \r\n Despite significant progress in the field, serious \r\nviolations of human rights continue to be committed in \r\nmany parts of the world. The United Nations system \r\nand Member States should be ever more determined to \r\nwork together to promote and protect human rights. As \r\nthe Secretary-General points out, increasing economic \r\nhardship, exacerbated by the global economic crisis \r\nand other challenges, including climate change, further \r\naffects vulnerable groups such as minorities, migrants, \r\nwomen, children and persons with disabilities. The \r\nOrganization and its Member States should fully \r\nrecognize the relevance of human rights in crafting \r\nresponses to such global challenges. \r\n The United Nations has made significant progress \r\nin preventing and responding to mass atrocities. The \r\ncomprehensive report of the Secretary-General \r\n(A/63/677) on implementing the responsibility to \r\nprotect provided a strong base for sincere and \r\nproductive General Assembly debates, leading to the \r\nadoption of resolution 63/308 by consensus confirming \r\nthe firm commitment of Member States to the \r\nresponsibility to protect. Now we must move towards \r\nactual implementation of that norm on the ground. The \r\nRepublic of Korea is convinced that our continued \r\ndeliberations on implementing the responsibility to \r\nprotect will produce a policy framework for the United \r\nNations system, regional organizations and individual \r\nGovernments. \r\n The Republic of Korea welcomes the Assembly’s \r\nunanimous adoption of resolution 63/311 on system-\r\nwide coherence, in particular the agreement on the \r\nestablishment of a stronger gender architecture in the \r\nform of a composite entity, as a way to pursue gender \r\nequality and the empowerment of women more \r\neffectively. My delegation expects the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to implement the resolution in a timely \r\nmanner, including the early introduction of a \r\ncomprehensive proposal on the composite entity. \r\n Let me conclude by renewing the Republic of \r\nKorea’s support of the Secretariat’s efforts to make the \r\nUnited Nations a more effective, more accountable and \r\nbetter functioning Organization under the able \r\nleadership of the Secretary-General. A better world \r\ndepends on it. \r\n Mr. Pálsson (Iceland): I would like, at the outset, \r\nto thank the Secretary-General for his concise and \r\nvaluable report on the work of the Organization \r\n(A/64/1). \r\n A/64/PV.15\r\n \r\n3 09-54411 \r\n \r\n The past year has been a gruelling one for the \r\nworld and for the United Nations. The global financial \r\nand economic crisis has affected the well-being of \r\nmillions of people, threatening to set back the \r\ndevelopment efforts of the international community by \r\nseveral years. At a time of dwindling national \r\nresources, the crisis is putting unprecedented strain on \r\nour multilateral system, raising questions about the \r\neffectiveness of our Organization in dealing with some \r\nof its manifestations. But the primary lesson of the \r\nrecent turmoil is hardly that we should now turn \r\ninward or fall back on our individual means. Quite the \r\nopposite, the need to cooperate within the existing \r\nframework of international institutions is now greater \r\nthan ever. As the Secretary-General rightly observes in \r\nparagraph 4 of his report, this is the “ultimate \r\nmultilateral moment”. \r\n The world community must do its utmost to \r\nprevent the financial crisis from turning into a real \r\ndevelopment emergency. Extraordinary efforts will be \r\nneeded to prevent the financial crisis from reversing \r\nthe hard-won gains made towards achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals in areas like primary \r\neducation, maternal health and the fight against hunger. \r\nI take this opportunity to compliment the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the initiative he is taking in introducing the \r\nGlobal Impact and Vulnerability Alert System. \r\n One of the risks associated with the current global \r\ncrisis is that it may undermine confidence in the \r\ninternational system, including the United Nations, at a \r\ntime when we can least afford it. To prevent this from \r\nhappening, we need, among other things, stronger and \r\nmore representative international institutions, sound \r\nglobal regulatory frameworks and greater surveillance \r\nand supervision in the area of international finance. But \r\nmore is required in order to fashion the new \r\nmultilateralism that the Secretary-General has called for \r\nin his report. We must also accelerate progress on a \r\ncomprehensive United Nations reform. Key to this effort \r\nis the urgent need to improve the working methods of \r\nthe Security Council and to widen its membership. A \r\nSecurity Council that is more representative of the \r\nworld we live in, including the developing countries, \r\nwill carry greater weight and authority. \r\n As small States comprise a large share of the \r\nUnited Nations membership, any enlargement must also \r\nensure that the interests of small States are fully taken \r\ninto account. The promotion of greater accountability \r\nand efficiency in the work of the Organization, as well \r\nas measures to render the wider United Nations system \r\nmore coherent, coordinated and responsive, is another \r\nimportant facet of the reform process. \r\n This includes strengthening the so-called gender \r\narchitecture, long characterized by fragmentation and \r\nthe lack of accountability. Iceland welcomes the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s unanimous decision to create a \r\nnew and consolidated United Nations gender entity to \r\nbe headed by an Under-Secretary-General and urges \r\nthe Secretary-General to move forward on that decision \r\nas expeditiously as possible. \r\n However, to redeem the full potential of the \r\nUnited Nations we need more than structural \r\nimprovements. We should also reform the way our \r\nOrganization reacts to global challenges of the highest \r\norder. The genocides of the twentieth century show that \r\ntoo often the international community has failed to \r\nprevent or respond adequately to mass atrocities. By \r\nmoving to operationalize the concept of the \r\nresponsibility to protect, the Organization can now take \r\ndeliberate steps to shore up the protection of basic \r\nhuman rights and the rule of law. My delegation hopes \r\nthat the current session of the General Assembly will \r\nwork constructively towards that end. \r\n An extended economic crisis exacerbates the risks \r\nof conflict and the impacts of poor food security and \r\nhealth care, and deteriorating living conditions in \r\ndifferent parts of the world threaten to undermine the \r\nupholding of human rights. For that reason, Iceland \r\nfully subscribes to the Secretary-General’s view that, at \r\nthis time, it is imperative for the United Nations to make \r\na special effort to promote respect for human rights. \r\n To ensure prosperity and peace for future \r\ngenerations, it is also essential that we take measures \r\nto safeguard the earth’s ecosystem. While climate \r\nchange may, as the Secretary-General has said, be the \r\ndefining challenge of our generation, the interlinkages \r\nbetween climate and other aspects of our ecosystem, \r\nincluding land use, energy and oceans, should also be \r\nrecognized. No country is shielded from the impact of \r\nclimate change, and an effective solution to the \r\nproblem will require the active cooperation of each and \r\nevery Member of the United Nations. We must join \r\nhands and work to conclude a legally binding \r\nagreement in Copenhagen. At the same time, a gradual \r\nbut fundamental reorientation of energy policy should \r\nbe seen as essential for preventing future climate \r\nchanges. Member States should work, among other \r\nA/64/PV.15  \r\n \r\n09-54411 4 \r\n \r\nthings, to increase the share of renewable energy \r\nresources used in meeting world energy demand, aided \r\nnot least by the International Renewable Energy \r\nAgency established in January of this year. \r\n In connection with climate change, we must also \r\nconsider the state of the oceans, which are essential to \r\nsustaining the world’s social and economic \r\ndevelopment. A host of man-made environmental \r\nhazards, including pollution, overfishing and climate \r\nchange, are threatening the productivity of our oceans. \r\nIf we are to eradicate poverty and hunger, reduce child \r\nmortality and combat disease, we must also prevent \r\nand reverse the degradation of the oceans. Regrettably, \r\nthere is currently no systematic effort to keep the state \r\nof the world’s oceans under continuing review. That is \r\nwhy world leaders decided at the Johannesburg \r\nSummit seven years ago to launch a regular process \r\nunder the United Nations for global reporting and \r\nassessment of the state of the marine environment, \r\nincluding socio-economic aspects. As the start-up \r\nphase of this valuable initiative has now been \r\ncompleted, Iceland supports the initiation of the first \r\nfully integrated assessment of the regular process to be \r\ncompleted by the year 2014. \r\n As the Secretary-General’s report makes clear, the \r\ntasks before us have rarely been more demanding or \r\ndiverse. This should not be a source of discouragement. \r\nLet us instead make the best possible use of the \r\nopportunity afforded by this “ultimate multilateral \r\nmoment” to ensure a fruitful and productive session of \r\nthe United Nations General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Valero Briceño (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): The Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela warmly welcomes the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, and gratefully \r\nappreciates his introduction of his report on the work \r\nof the Organization (A/64/1). That report is part of the \r\nSecretary-General’s obligation to give an annual report \r\nto the General Assembly on the Organization’s \r\nactivities, in accordance with Article 98 of the United \r\nNations Charter. The Secretary-General’s report \r\nprovides an opportunity at today’s debate to address \r\nkey topics on our agenda this year. \r\n The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela agrees \r\nfully with the Secretary-General’s observation that we \r\nare in a time of crisis — economic and financial crisis, \r\nfood crisis and climate crisis — and that only by \r\nstrengthening multilateralism will we be able to meet \r\nthe challenges before us. This multifaceted global \r\ncrisis has revealed the exhaustion of the savage \r\ncapitalism that is gripping the world under the rubric \r\n“neo-liberalism”.  \r\n Venezuela appreciates the success of the high-\r\nlevel Conference on the World Financial and Economic \r\nCrisis and Its Impact on Development and hopes for a \r\nfruitful follow-up. The Conference was particularly \r\nimportant for the work of the General Assembly and \r\ndemonstrated the need to reform and transform the \r\nworld economic and financial architecture in order to \r\ncorrect the imbalances provoked by speculative \r\nfinancial capital.  \r\n My delegation endorses the statements made by \r\nvarious organizations and Member States to the effect \r\nthat the General Assembly is the principal organ of the \r\nOrganization and must maintain its independence from \r\nthe other organs. We must therefore reverse the \r\nSecurity Council’s tendency to involve itself in topics \r\noutside its field of competence, as that weakens the \r\ncentral role of the General Assembly within this \r\nmultilateral institution. \r\n On several occasions, Venezuela has stressed the \r\nneed to move ahead more expeditiously and resolutely \r\nin reforming the United Nations. We are convinced that \r\nonly by ensuring the democratization of the \r\nOrganization, greater transparency in its methods and \r\nits genuine accountability to Member States will fertile \r\nground be laid in which the United Nations can \r\nflourish. \r\n Venezuela welcomes the decision of the General \r\nAssembly to pursue intergovernmental negotiations on \r\nSecurity Council reform at the sixty-fourth session. \r\nThat is fundamental if the Organization is to restore its \r\ncredibility before the world and no longer be seen as an \r\ninstitution held hostage to hegemonic interests. The \r\nOrganization must, of course, have a starring role in \r\naddressing the problems that beset all humankind. It is \r\nprecisely by correcting its deficiencies and by \r\nfaithfully adhering to the United Nations Charter that it \r\nwill be able to present itself to the people of the world \r\nas a model of justice, equity and genuine commitment \r\nto international peace, security and development. \r\n We must reform the Security Council forthwith, \r\nexpand its membership, eliminate the veto and improve \r\nits working methods, including in particular direct and \r\nuniversal participation of the General Assembly, by \r\nsecret ballot, in the selection of the Secretary-General. \r\n A/64/PV.15\r\n \r\n5 09-54411 \r\n \r\nThe Secretariat must fulfil its mandates from the \r\nGeneral Assembly and prioritize those related to the \r\ncomprehensive development of peoples and the fight \r\nagainst poverty in order to attain a world of abundant \r\njustice, equality and solidarity. \r\n My delegation welcomes the comments made by \r\nvarious Member States to the effect that the General \r\nAssembly must remain the principal forum for debate \r\nwithin the Organization. We must therefore prevent the \r\nSecurity Council from involving itself in issues that are \r\noutside its competencies but within the purview of the \r\nGeneral Assembly.  \r\n My delegation notes the progress made towards \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs), as described in the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport, and in particular the increased global \r\ninvestment in the fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis \r\nand malaria. \r\n The crisis of capitalism has, however, multiplied \r\nits negative effects throughout the world, in particular \r\nin developing countries. All forecasts indicate that \r\ninjustice and inequality will become more pronounced \r\nand that many countries will be unable to meet the \r\nMDGs. For that reason, we note with concern that, \r\nalthough we stand at the threshold of the 2010 MDG \r\nreview, no projects or actions have been proposed \r\ntowards the achievement of the Goals.  \r\n My delegation has been particularly struck by the \r\nfact that the Secretary-General’s report contains a \r\nsection on genocide prevention and the responsibility \r\nto protect. This is a conflation of two distinct topics — \r\ngenocide and the responsibility to protect. We are told \r\nthat the Special Advisers to the Secretary-General have \r\na mandate to work on both concepts, including, clearly, \r\nthe responsibility to protect. We are concerned, \r\nhowever, that initiatives are being implemented on \r\nwhich the General Assembly has not yet reached \r\nconsensus.  \r\n The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela will \r\nalways raise its voice to defend the principles of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter and of international law, \r\nincluding respect for the sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegrity of States, non-interference in internal affairs, \r\nand the promotion of and protection of all human rights \r\nto be preserved intact. \r\n Mr. Al Habib (Islamic Republic of Iran): I thank \r\nthe Secretary-General and the Secretariat for all of \r\ntheir efforts in preparing the report on the work of the \r\nOrganization (A/64/1). Allow me to take this \r\nopportunity to share with the Assembly my country’s \r\nviews on some of the main agenda items addressed in \r\nthe report, which also comprise the main challenges \r\nahead. \r\n At the outset, I should say that we are all facing \r\nthis precipice together in the same ship and that \r\nmultilateralism is the only safe way to forge ahead \r\ntowards a safer world. Unilateralism is the main \r\nadversary of a multilateral and integrated approach and \r\nwill thwart our attempts to develop a common \r\nunderstanding of the global public good. That is why \r\nthe interlinkage between global, regional and national \r\nobjectives should be drawn in a completely unbiased \r\nand well-balanced manner that leaves no room for \r\nfurther unilateralism or polarization. \r\n In this sense, the existing global multilateral \r\narchitecture must be renovated so that it can properly \r\naddress the challenges of the twenty-first century. \r\nLessons learned from the twentieth century should not \r\nbe repeated but should serve as hazard lights and \r\nguiding torches, allowing a new global multilateral \r\narchitecture to flourish. Yes, the United Nations can \r\nand should be the hub of this new world if it is able to \r\nrestructure the global architecture to ensure that justice \r\nprevails over prejudice and if the world’s peoples are \r\nto enjoy the rule of law rather than the rule of might — \r\na world free from threats, aggression, discrimination, \r\nhatred and poverty. To that end, the balance between \r\nthe principal organs of the United Nations should be \r\nrestored and the role and authority of the General \r\nAssembly reaffirmed in ways that promote \r\nmultilateralism. \r\n There is general agreement that the international \r\ncommunity must be vigilant not to let the horror of the \r\nmass killings and genocide of the past be repeated in \r\nthe future. This should in no way prejudice the \r\nestablished principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations, particularly respect for the sovereignty, \r\nterritorial integrity and political independence of \r\nStates, as well as non-intervention in their internal \r\naffairs. We should also be highly alert to this \r\nhumanitarian notion being misused and abused to \r\nundermine the foundational principles of Charter-based \r\ninternational law, in particular the prohibition of the \r\nthreat or use of force, as set forth in Article 2.4 of the \r\nCharter.  \r\nA/64/PV.15  \r\n \r\n09-54411 6 \r\n \r\n After all, we should remember that the inaction of \r\nthe international community in the face of grave mass \r\natrocities in the previous decade was not the result of \r\nthe absence of concepts or a normative framework; \r\nrather, it was the consequence of the failure of the \r\nSecurity Council — in fact, of certain member \r\nStates — to act when action was needed. \r\n The Islamic Republic of Iran believes that the \r\nnotion of responsibility to protect needs to be further \r\ndiscussed and clearly defined and refined. The \r\nAssembly’s debate of this item at the sixty-third \r\nsession showed that there are still many questions and \r\nconcerns surrounding the concept that need to be \r\naddressed. The General Assembly is the competent \r\norgan of the United Nations to continue the debate on \r\nthe concept and to address the concerns and questions \r\nof many delegations concerning it and its implications. \r\n It should be repeatedly emphasized that \r\nmultilateralism and multilateral solutions agreed in \r\naccordance with the Charter provide the only \r\nsustainable method of addressing disarmament and \r\ninternational security issues. At the top of the United \r\nNations agenda are the continued existence of nuclear \r\nweapons and their possible use or threat of use as a \r\nmatter of grave concern and a threat to international \r\npeace and security. Therefore, nuclear disarmament \r\nremains the highest priority. However, we regret to see \r\nthe slow pace of progress towards nuclear \r\ndisarmament, as well as the lack of progress by \r\nnuclear-weapon States towards the total elimination of \r\ntheir nuclear arsenals. In fact, reductions in \r\ndeployment and in the operational status of nuclear \r\nweapons cannot substitute for irreversible, verifiable \r\nand transparent cuts in and the total elimination of \r\nnuclear weapons. It is now up to the Conference on \r\nDisarmament to establish an ad hoc committee on \r\nnuclear disarmament to follow through. \r\n The 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \r\n(NPT) should play a crucial role in a balanced \r\napproach towards nuclear disarmament, nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation and the peaceful uses of nuclear \r\nenergy. Meanwhile, we wish to reaffirm that the \r\nchoices and decisions of each country with respect to \r\nthe peaceful use of nuclear energy should be respected. \r\nThere should be no interference in a State’s policies or \r\narrangements for the peaceful use of nuclear energy, \r\nincluding its fuel-cycle policies. \r\n With respect to paragraph 116 of the report of the \r\nSecretary-General, we would like to emphasize that, as \r\na result of Iran’s proactive cooperation and full \r\ntransparency in the implementation of the workplan \r\nagreed between Iran and the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA) in the summer of 2007, all \r\noutstanding safeguards implementation issues have \r\nbeen resolved and closed. Naturally, pursuant to the \r\nmodality agreed to in the workplan, the implementation \r\nof safeguards in Iran must become normalized. We \r\nreiterate that Iran’s nuclear programme is and has \r\nalways been undertaken for peaceful purposes and in \r\nfull conformity with the provisions of the NPT. \r\nTherefore, the concern expressed in paragraph 116 is \r\nwithout foundation. \r\n Establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the \r\nMiddle East is yet another priority that cannot be \r\naddressed due to the non-adherence of the Israeli \r\nregime to the NPT and its ongoing development and \r\nstockpiling of nuclear weapons. The necessary steps \r\nshould be taken in different international forums, \r\nincluding the NPT Review Conference and IAEA, for \r\nthe immediate establishment of such a zone. \r\n With regard to the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs), we share the concerns expressed by the \r\nSecretary-General in his report on the slow pace of \r\nprogress in their overall attainment. The full impact of \r\nthe financial and economic crisis on their achievement \r\nhas yet to be unveiled. However, it is quite obvious \r\nthat negative economic growth, diminished resources, \r\nfewer trade opportunities for the developing countries, \r\npossible reductions in aid flows and protectionist \r\ntendencies will slow or reverse the progress that has so \r\nfar been achieved. We know from past experience that \r\nwhenever political will is complemented by adequate \r\nfinancial resources and commitments, progress has \r\nbecome attainable. Otherwise, and despite all the good \r\nwill and wishful thinking, we may unfortunately miss \r\nthe 2015 deadline for the achievement of the MDGs. \r\n As the defining challenge of our generation, \r\nclimate change inflicts serious damage on the vital \r\nsocio-economic infrastructure of countries and erodes \r\ntheir progress in development. While developing \r\ncountries are committed to the Convention and the Bali \r\nAction Plan, concerted ambitious commitments and \r\nmeasures must be undertaken by developed countries \r\nto address the needs of developing countries in all four \r\nmajor components of the Action Plan, namely, \r\nmitigation, adaptation, finance and technology. That is \r\n A/64/PV.15\r\n \r\n7 09-54411 \r\n \r\na basic requirement for the success of the Copenhagen \r\nConference. \r\n In the same vein, investing in sustainable forest \r\nmanagement will create 10 million new green jobs, \r\nproviding long-term employment opportunities for the \r\nrural sector and fostering pro-poor sustainable \r\ndevelopment in many developing countries. In \r\naddition, such an investment would also make a major \r\ncontribution to climate change mitigation and \r\nadaptation efforts, biodiversity conservation, and \r\ncombating deforestation and desertification. \r\n The President took the Chair. \r\n Finally, one major regional impact of climate \r\nchange that has emerged in recent years as a huge \r\nchallenge to many countries, including in my region, is \r\ndust storms and sandstorms. Dust storms and \r\nsandstorms are among the most serious and hard-to-\r\nbeat challenges that have arisen in recent years. They \r\ninflict substantial damage on the socio-economic \r\nsituation of many countries, impair the normal life and \r\nhealth of the people, erode agricultural lands and \r\npollute water resources throughout arid regions. It is a \r\nregion-wide problem that, in addition to the firm \r\nnational determination of all countries involved, \r\nrequires regional and global cooperation and \r\ninteraction to combat this challenge. The post-Kyoto \r\narrangements will have to look at the dust storm and \r\nsandstorm issue closely in order to identify the root \r\ncauses of the problem and eradicate it. \r\n Mr. Montoya (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nAllow me, Mr. President, to reiterate my delegation’s \r\ncongratulations to you and your Bureau on your \r\nelection to lead our work, and to wish you every \r\nsuccess in that important task. You can count on our \r\ncooperation and support in achieving a fruitful \r\noutcome to your work. \r\n The report of the Secretary-General (A/64/1) \r\nreflects the efforts of the United Nations to fulfil its \r\nobjectives. The work of the Secretary-General and his \r\nteam, reflected in the results achieved by the \r\nOrganization, deserves the recognition of the Member \r\nStates. \r\n There are many notable elements in the report. I \r\nwould like to refer first to the chapter on delivering \r\nresults for people most in need. Despite the hard work \r\nto achieve the Millennium Development Goals, we \r\nnote with concern, as the report states, that although \r\nthe overall poverty rates in the developing world will \r\nstill continue to fall, they will do so at a slower pace as \r\na result of the world economic crisis. \r\n Furthermore, we are not encouraged by forecasts \r\nfor the crisis’s impact on food security, progress in \r\nprimary and secondary education, the struggle for \r\ngender equality and women’s empowerment, child \r\nmortality and developments in health care, in particular \r\nexpanding coverage for the poorest and most \r\nvulnerable people. The economic crisis has been and \r\nremains a tough test of the goals agreed at the \r\nMillennium Summit. \r\n Given the context of the crisis and the global \r\neconomic recession, the international community must \r\nstep up its efforts in jointly supporting those most in \r\nneed and adopting additional measures that will make \r\nit possible to achieve the Millennium Development \r\nGoals, which must be reaffirmed as a central priority of \r\nour Organization.  \r\n In that regard, we welcome the proposal in \r\nparagraph 33 of the report regarding the development \r\nof a comprehensive response of the United Nations \r\nthrough the creation of a global impact and \r\nvulnerability alert system. That tool would allow us to \r\nclosely follow the effects of global crises on the poor \r\nand most vulnerable. Member States should support the \r\ndevelopment, establishment and system-wide \r\nimplementation of that important initiative, and of \r\nnational development plans and strategies. \r\n For its part, the chapter on securing global goods \r\naddresses topics that the Colombian State also \r\nconsiders to be essential and priorities on the world \r\nagenda. Climate change, global health, the fight against \r\nterrorism and disarmament must indeed be matters of \r\nparticular importance to the United Nations. As \r\nPresident Alvaro Uribe Vélez recently said in his \r\naddress to the General Assembly (see A/64/PV.4), \r\nColombia has made significant progress in developing \r\nbiofuels without affecting food security; implementing \r\nenvironmentally friendly mass transport systems; \r\nprotecting its water sources and conserving \r\nbiodiversity, the latter at the world level; and \r\ndeveloping clean energy. All those initiatives help to \r\ncombat climate change.  \r\n The conservation of our jungle of 578,000 square \r\nkilometres, over 51 per cent of the territory, is also a \r\nsignificant contribution in that regard. The Family \r\nForest Wardens programme implemented in Colombia \r\nA/64/PV.15  \r\n \r\n09-54411 8 \r\n \r\nis monitored by the United Nations and has received its \r\nhighest approval. Through that programme, more than \r\n90,000 rural families have become involved in the \r\ncollective work of tending the jungle and preventing \r\nthe destruction that follows upon the cultivation of \r\ncrops used to produce illicit drugs.  \r\n We welcome and note with hope United Nations \r\nactivities to promote awareness and the political \r\ncommitment of all Member States, accompanied by \r\nconcrete action, to address climate change. We trust \r\nthat the Copenhagen Conference will produce \r\nsubstantial progress in that field. \r\n With regard to health care, Colombia is \r\nimplementing policies that have made it possible to \r\nexpand coverage, in particular for the least protected, \r\nwith tangible results. In March 2009, 90 per cent of the \r\npopulation — over 40 million Colombians — belonged \r\nto a health-care programme. Over half of those had \r\naccess to State-subsidized support, which benefits the \r\nunemployed and people working in the informal \r\nsectors, those living in poverty, indigenous people and \r\nthe displaced, among others. The major objective for \r\nsocial security health care is to achieve universal \r\ncoverage by 2010. \r\n On the other hand, Colombia has supported and \r\nwill continue to support the various initiatives of the \r\ninternational community to combat terrorism and the \r\ndanger that related crimes, such as arms trafficking, \r\nmoney-laundering and the trade in illicit drugs, pose to \r\nthe stability of all States. We highly value the United \r\nNations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, a plan with \r\nconcrete steps to address that scourge, in full respect \r\nfor and observance of human rights. \r\n It is also important to underscore the efforts of \r\nthe Secretariat to institutionalize the United Nations \r\nCounter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force, which \r\nwould make it possible to coordinate and streamline \r\nthe entire system. Likewise, we urge all Member States \r\nto revive efforts to conclude and to adopt the \r\ncomprehensive convention on terrorism. \r\n It is well known that my country has adopted \r\nstrict measures against the production and trafficking \r\nof illicit drugs. We call on the international community \r\nto shoulder its share of responsibility in that process by \r\ndiscouraging the permissive consumption of illicit \r\ndrugs. Each gram illicitly consumed fuels violence, \r\narms trafficking, death, damage to the jungle and water \r\npollution. \r\n Colombia joins the recent appeal of heads of \r\nState, world leaders and the Secretary-General for \r\ndisarmament. The context is conducive to progress \r\ntowards nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. \r\nThat will should give rise to more resolute action with \r\nregard to the illicit trade in small arms and light \r\nweapons. It should also promote greater cooperation in \r\ncombating anti-personnel mines. In a few weeks, the \r\nSecond Review Conference of the Ottawa Convention \r\nwill take place in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia. We \r\nhope that the current resolve in favour of disarmament \r\nwill be reflected in full support for and broad \r\nparticipation in the Cartagena Conference on anti-\r\npersonnel mines. \r\n My delegation would also like to highlight the \r\neffort of the Secretariat and the Organization towards \r\ncreating a stronger United Nations, as the report \r\nsuggests. Actions to change the system should produce \r\nthe strengthened instruments and resources that the \r\nOrganization requires to fulfil its mandate. The steps \r\ntaken by the Secretary-General in that regard, \r\ndescribed in the report, constitute support for the \r\nOrganization’s efficient work. System-wide coherence, \r\nintergovernmental machinery that ensures the \r\nparticipation of civil society, and cooperation with \r\nregional organizations must be part of that process. \r\n Complementary to that are the activities of \r\nMember States towards the revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and Security Council reform. Those \r\nmeasures, carried out in a harmonious and coordinated \r\nway, can contribute to the strengthening and the \r\nflexibility that the Organization needs in order to adapt \r\nto the responsibilities entrusted to it and to the \r\nchallenges of multilateralism in the twenty-first \r\ncentury.  \r\n The international community needs multilateralism \r\nto be ever more vigorous, genuine and dynamic. In a \r\nworld increasingly interconnected and interdependent, \r\nno nation can confront alone the tremendous challenges \r\nimposed by the new world realities. We share one \r\ndestiny. The United Nations is indispensable to building \r\nthat shared future and to ensuring that the aspirations \r\nand hopes of future generations are fully realized. \r\n Mr. Sangqu (South Africa): Since this is the first \r\ntime that I am taking the floor on behalf of my \r\ndelegation at the sixty-fourth session, please allow me \r\nto congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President \r\nof the General Assembly and to assure you of our \r\n A/64/PV.15\r\n \r\n9 09-54411 \r\n \r\ndelegation’s support in ensuring the success of this \r\nsession. My delegation also wishes to thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his report on the work of the \r\nOrganization at the sixty-third session (A/64/1). \r\n Today the world is facing multiple challenges — \r\nunderdevelopment, poverty and hunger, the global food \r\nand financial crises and the scourges of war and \r\nterrorism, to name but a few. I believe that it is only \r\nthrough a strong commitment to multilateralism \r\nthrough the United Nations that we in the international \r\ncommunity can address those crises in order to create a \r\nbetter life for those we represent. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report highlights many of these areas. \r\n The eradication of dehumanizing poverty and \r\nhunger must remain central to the work of the United \r\nNations. The Organization must continue to work \r\nharder to unite the world in working towards the total \r\neradication of poverty and to put an end to the \r\nsuffering of the world’s poor and marginalized. \r\n Developing countries did not cause the economic \r\nand financial crisis, but they are severely affected by it, \r\nand this is especially true for Africa. South Africa \r\nshares the concern expressed by the Secretary-General \r\nabout the grave impact of the current financial and \r\neconomic crisis on the poor and the most vulnerable, \r\nespecially in Africa. It is a fact that the crisis has \r\nseverely affected Africa’s growth rate and thereby its \r\ncapacity to address poverty and to achieve \r\ninternationally agreed development goals, including \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\n The report correctly states that Africa has indeed \r\nachieved impressive rates of growth over the past \r\ndecade, which has allowed the continent to \r\nprogressively move towards achieving sustainable \r\ndevelopment, which in turn has contributed to the \r\npeace, security and stability that we see on the \r\ncontinent. However, a confluence of crises, such as the \r\nglobal food and financial crises, has had a severe \r\nimpact on Africa and is likely to reverse these positive \r\ndevelopments. Those crises have contributed to a \r\nsubstantial increase in unemployment and a slowdown \r\nin trade resulting in lower export earnings, ultimately \r\naffecting the livelihoods of the people of the continent.  \r\n Therefore, the United Nations must play a \r\nsignificant role in finding solutions to the global \r\neconomic crisis. In this regard, we concur with the \r\nSecretary-General that the international community \r\nmust implement its renewed commitments made at the \r\nGeneral Assembly high-level meeting on Africa’s \r\ndevelopment needs held last September. \r\n Similarly, the impact of climate change on Africa \r\nis devastating and will severely undermine \r\ndevelopment and poverty eradication efforts. In \r\nCopenhagen we must reach a binding, inclusive, fair \r\nand effective global agreement on this critical \r\nchallenge. The agreement must recognize that solving \r\nthe climate change problem cannot be separated from \r\nthe struggle to eradicate poverty. Developed countries \r\nbear the greatest responsibility for climate change and \r\nits impact. Our goal should be to significantly reduce \r\nemissions across the globe without constraining \r\ndevelopment in the countries of the South. \r\n We have noted with concern the impact that the \r\nglobal downturn has had on women and children \r\nespecially. In this regard, the Secretary-General’s \r\nassessment of the implementation of the MDGs \r\nrelating to child and maternal mortality is grim, and we \r\nagree with his conclusion that those areas require \r\nurgent attention from the entire international \r\ncommunity in order to stop and reverse the worsening \r\nof the situation. \r\n We are pleased that the United Nations has \r\nworked to strengthen its support for Africa’s \r\ndevelopment agenda. However, this work is not yet \r\ncomplete. Our delegation is of the opinion that we need \r\nto further enhance cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the African Union and various other \r\nregional organizations in Africa, such as the Southern \r\nAfrican Development Community. We therefore will \r\nwork hard with other States Members of the United \r\nNations to ensure that the African Union’s participation \r\nat the United Nations will allow for this enhanced \r\ncooperation. \r\n Cooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nAfrican Union is even more essential with regard to \r\npeace and security. We are pleased to note that the \r\nSecretary-General states in his report that the \r\nrelationship between the two organizations is a steadily \r\nexpanding strategic one. South Africa will continue its \r\nwork during this session, within both the General \r\nAssembly and the Security Council, to further enhance \r\nthat relationship. In this regard, we look forward to the \r\nSecretary-General’s bold report on the financing of \r\npeacekeeping operations undertaken by the African \r\nUnion, including the use of assessed contributions. \r\nA/64/PV.15  \r\n \r\n09-54411 10 \r\n \r\n We agree with previous speakers that it is \r\nessential for us to move forward on the reform of this \r\nOrganization, especially the Security Council. South \r\nAfrica will continue to participate in the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council to ensure that the historic injustice \r\nagainst Africa is corrected and that the Council’s \r\nmembership is increased in both categories. It is also \r\nessential that the Council’s working methods be \r\nimproved. \r\n With regard to disarmament and non-proliferation, \r\nSouth Africa remains committed to the goals of \r\ndisarmament, non-proliferation and arms control, \r\nincluding the illicit trade in small arms, and will \r\ncontinue actively to pursue and promote the importance \r\nof the multilateral approach in this regard during this \r\nsession. We appreciate the recent pronouncements by \r\nsome nuclear-weapon States of their intentions to \r\nreduce their nuclear arsenals. We should take up this \r\nnew momentum and utilize the opportunity of the 2010 \r\nReview Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to recommit \r\nourselves to the full implementation of obligations \r\nunder the Treaty. \r\n Finally, I wish to reiterate my delegation’s \r\ncommitment to the full and effective implementation of \r\nthe outcomes of the United Nations Durban Review \r\nConference and the World Conference against Racism, \r\nRacial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related \r\nIntolerance. In our continued commitment to fight to \r\nrid the world of the scourge of racism, we will continue \r\nto advocate the set of values our continent is known \r\nfor. It is with this in mind that our delegation will \r\npresent a draft resolution to this Assembly calling for \r\nthe celebration of an international Nelson Mandela day \r\nevery 18 July.  \r\n We will also submit a draft resolution in the \r\ncoming days on the 2010 World Cup of the Fédération \r\ninternationale de football association, which our \r\ncountry is proud to be hosting on behalf of Africa. The \r\ndraft resolution celebrates the fact that it is the first \r\ntime that this prestigious event will be hosted by our \r\ncontinent, Africa, and acknowledges the broad appeal \r\nof football in promoting peace and development. My \r\ndelegation humbly calls for the Assembly’s support for \r\nthese two draft resolutions. \r\n The President: I now call on the observer of the \r\nObserver State of the Holy See. \r\n Mr. Swanepoel (Holy See): I make the following \r\nstatement on behalf of the Permanent Observer of the \r\nHoly See, Archbishop Celestino Migliore.  \r\n My delegation wishes to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report on the work of the organization \r\n(A/64/1) and its clear call for the membership to \r\nrestore hope and solidarity so that the sixty-fourth \r\nsession of the General Assembly becomes a point of \r\nrenewal for this Organization. \r\n This past year the global community became \r\nmore aware of the fragility of prosperity and growth. \r\nThe world was hit by an economic crisis that has led to \r\ntheir security and the ability to provide even the basic \r\nnecessities for their families. This crisis raised a \r\nnumber of questions about the causes and \r\nconsequences of the economic downturn and created \r\neven more questions as to what the future will hold. \r\nTherefore, as we begin this sixty-fourth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, one year after the deepening of the \r\nfinancial crisis, we do so with a new sense of purpose \r\nto learn from the mistakes and renew our commitment \r\nto the need for cooperation. \r\n One area for a renewed sense of commitment to \r\naddressing the world’s problems is in working to lift \r\nthe burdens placed upon so many in this world due to \r\nlack of economic resources. On numerous occasions, \r\nmy delegation has pointed to the need for greater \r\nglobal solidarity in order to tackle the moral \r\nimplications that currently face the world and to give a \r\nrenewed priority to the poor. We welcome the \r\nSecretary-General’s recognition of the moral grounds \r\nunderlying the need to give priority to the most \r\nvulnerable in this endeavour. \r\n For such an effort, my delegation stresses the \r\nurgency of the need for the United Nations and \r\ndeveloped countries to come together to give assistance \r\nto the many nations that are unable to respond to the \r\nfinancial crisis and that continue to face security and \r\ndevelopment challenges. For some of the countries \r\nlagging behind the rest of the world, the precarious, \r\ndrifting economic situation was not created but rather \r\nexacerbated by the current financial crisis. \r\nDevelopment aid will be effective only to the extent \r\nthat local governments and civil society confront the \r\nsituation with the impetus generated by the sense of \r\nresponsibility needed to address chronic political, \r\nadministrative and social malfunctioning. \r\n A/64/PV.15\r\n \r\n11 09-54411 \r\n \r\n My delegation welcomes the Secretary-General’s \r\ncalls for an increased commitment to peacebuilding \r\nand peacekeeping, for these are the vital cornerstones \r\nupon which the United Nations was created. All this \r\nwill be achieved only in the context of a renewed \r\ncommitment to responsible sovereignty at both the \r\nnational and international levels. \r\n The upcoming Copenhagen Conference on \r\nClimate Change will test the ability of the international \r\ncommunity to work together on a problem that has both \r\nglobal and local consequences. At the heart of the \r\nclimate-change debate is the moral and ethical need for \r\nindividuals, companies and States to recognize their \r\nresponsibility to use the world’s resources in a \r\nsustainable manner. With this responsibility comes the \r\nduty of all States and international corporations that \r\nhave somehow disproportionately used and abused \r\nglobal resources to shoulder their fair share in solving \r\nthe problem. \r\n In the light of the agreement to work towards a \r\nlegally binding instrument on the import, export and \r\ntransfer of conventional arms, the Convention on \r\nCluster Munitions and the recent consensus among \r\nmajor nuclear Powers to reduce nuclear stockpiles, \r\nthere has been an increasing commitment by some \r\nStates to address this fundamental issue. However, the \r\nongoing proliferation of nuclear arms and the desire by \r\nsome States to continue to spend disproportionate \r\namounts of money on weapons suggest that further \r\nefforts are needed if we are to make serious progress in \r\ncontrolling and unilaterally disarming these \r\ninstruments of destruction. \r\n Our efforts to renew the work of the United \r\nNations will remain unfulfilled unless the international \r\norganizations and individual States are able to \r\nincorporate the voices of civil society into all aspects \r\nof the work of the Organization. Civil society partners \r\nare critical players in delivering humanitarian relief, \r\npromoting the rule of law and bringing to light gross \r\nviolations of human rights.  \r\n In this regard, faith-based organizations play a \r\nvital role in providing insight into the local needs of \r\ncommunities, delivering care and fostering solidarity \r\nboth locally and internationally for the needs of people \r\naround the world. My delegation welcomes the \r\nSecretary-General’s recognition of the critical role of \r\ncivil society actors, and we hope to work with the \r\ndelegations to further include civil society organizations \r\nin providing lifesaving care to those in need. \r\n Widespread corruption, health pandemics, \r\npersistent maternal mortality in some regions of the \r\nworld, economic crisis, terrorism, food security, \r\nclimate change and migration all illustrate that in an \r\nincreasingly globalized world, national solutions are \r\nonly one part of the formula for contributing to peace \r\nand justice. These global problems call for an \r\ninternational response, and it is therefore imperative \r\nthat the United Nations and other international \r\norganizations look inward and outward in order to \r\nmake the necessary reforms to respond to the \r\nchallenges of this interconnected world.  \r\n In commending the Secretary-General’s \r\nleadership, my delegation looks forward to working \r\nwith you, Mr. President, and the membership in the \r\nnext year to help create an Organization guided by \r\nduty, morality and solidarity with those in need. \r\n The President: May I take it that the General \r\nAssembly takes note of the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the work of the Organization contained in \r\ndocument A/64/1? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President: The Assembly has thus concluded \r\nthis stage of its consideration of agenda item 107. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 114 \r\n \r\nFollow-up to the outcome of the Millennium Summit \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/64/L.1) \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): We shall now \r\nproceed to consider draft resolution A/64/L.1. We will \r\nadopt this resolution without a vote, by consensus.  \r\n I give the floor to the representative of the \r\nSecretariat. \r\n Mr. Botnaru (Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management): In connection with draft \r\nresolution A/64/L.1, entitled “High-level United \r\nNations Conference on South-South Cooperation”, I \r\nwish to put on record the following statement of \r\nfinancial implications on behalf of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, in accordance with rule 153 of the rules of \r\nprocedure of the General Assembly. \r\n Under the terms of operative paragraph 1 of the \r\ndraft resolution, the General Assembly would decide: \r\n “that the High-level United Nations Conference \r\non South-South Cooperation: \r\nA/64/PV.15  \r\n \r\n09-54411 12 \r\n \r\n  “(a) Will be held at Nairobi from 1 to \r\n3 December 2009; \r\n  “(b) Will be held at the highest possible \r\nlevel; \r\n  “(c) Will have the overarching theme \r\n‘Promotion of South-South cooperation for \r\ndevelopment’; \r\n  “(d) Will consist of plenary meetings and \r\ninteractive multi-stakeholder round tables on the \r\nfollowing sub-themes; \r\n  “(i) Strengthening the role of the United \r\nNations system in supporting South-South \r\nand triangular cooperation; \r\n  “(ii) South-South and triangular cooperation \r\nfor development: complementarities, \r\nspecificities, challenges and opportunities; \r\n  “(e) Will result in an intergovernmentally \r\nagreed outcome; \r\n  “(f) Will also result in summaries by the \r\nChairperson”  \r\nand, under operative paragraph 12, would decide \r\n “to postpone the sixteenth session of the High-\r\nlevel Committee on South-South Cooperation \r\nfrom 2 to 5 June 2009 to one convenient day in \r\nJanuary 2010”. \r\n The High-level Conference on South-South \r\nCooperation — which I shall refer to as the Conference \r\nhereafter — had already been included in the calendar \r\nof meetings for 2009 on the understanding that the \r\nConference would be held in New York, in accordance \r\nwith the headquarters principle embodied in General \r\nAssembly resolution 40/243, and no later than the first \r\nhalf of 2009, according to Assembly resolution \r\n62/209 of 19 December 2007. Had the Conference \r\nbeen held at the established headquarters of its body, \r\ni.e., New York, in the first half of 2009, as decided in \r\nresolution 62/209, the required conference services \r\nwould have been provided from the existing conference \r\nservice capacities, without programme budget \r\nimplications. \r\n The aforementioned understanding, reached at the \r\ntime of drafting the calendar of meetings for 2009, is \r\nno longer valid, as the venue would be changed from \r\nNew York to Nairobi, from 1 to 3 December 2009. \r\n According to paragraph 5 of resolution 40/243, \r\nUnited Nations bodies may hold sessions away from \r\ntheir established headquarters when a Government \r\nissuing an invitation for a session to be held within its \r\nterritory has agreed to defray, after consultation with \r\nthe Secretary-General as to their nature and possible \r\nextent, the actual additional costs directly or indirectly \r\ninvolved. Therefore, the offer by the Government of \r\nKenya to host the High-level United Nations \r\nConference on South-South Cooperation requires the \r\nGovernment of Kenya to reimburse to the United \r\nNations the actual additional costs directly or indirectly \r\ninvolved as a result of the change of venue of the \r\nConference from New York to Nairobi.  \r\n Consequently, the related programme budget \r\nimplications set out in this oral statement include only \r\nthe estimated direct costs of providing the required \r\nlevel of conference services as if the Conference were \r\nstill to be held in New York — which I shall hereafter \r\nrefer to as “the New York cost” — while the \r\nGovernment of Kenya would defray any difference \r\nbetween the New York cost and the actual costs \r\nincurred by the United Nations in order to provide the \r\nrequired conference services and other related \r\nincidental support services, including, inter alia, \r\nprotocol services, sound engineering, safety and \r\nsecurity and webcasting services.  \r\n It is estimated that the Conference would require \r\nmeeting services for 13 meetings, with interpretation in \r\nall six official languages and document services for \r\n76 pages of documentation in all six official languages. \r\nThe costs of providing such services in New York are \r\nestimated at $333,000, including $163,600 for meeting \r\nservices and $169,400 for documentation services. \r\nSince the Conference has already been included in the \r\ncalendar of meetings for 2009, those costs in New York \r\ncould be met from within the approved appropriation \r\nunder Section 2, General Assembly Affairs and \r\nEconomic and Social Council Affairs and Conference \r\nManagement for the biennium 2008-2009. \r\n As regards the postponement of the sixteenth \r\nsession of the High-level Committee on South-South \r\nCooperation from 2 to 5 June 2009 to one convenient \r\nday in January 2010, it is determined that no additional \r\nresources would be required, on the understanding that \r\nthe specific date of the meetings of the sixteenth \r\nsession of the High-level Committee would be decided \r\nin consultation with the Secretariat. \r\n A/64/PV.15\r\n \r\n13 09-54411 \r\n \r\n In summary, should the General Assembly adopt \r\nthe draft resolution, there would be no programme \r\nbudget implications for the programme budget for the \r\nbiennium 2008-2009, on the condition that the \r\nGovernment of Kenya would defray the actual \r\nadditional costs directly or indirectly involved, in \r\naccordance with resolution 40/243. \r\n The President: The Assembly will now take a \r\ndecision on draft resolution A/64/L.1, entitled “High-\r\nlevel United Nations Conference on South-South \r\nCooperation”. I should like to announce that, since the \r\nintroduction of the draft resolution, the following \r\ncountries have become sponsors: Kenya, Mexico, Saint \r\nLucia, Suriname and Thailand.  \r\n May I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt \r\ndraft resolution A/64/L.1? \r\n Draft resolution A/64/L.1 was adopted (resolution \r\n64/1). \r\n The President: I shall now call on those \r\nrepresentatives who wish to speak in explanation of \r\nposition on the resolution just adopted.  \r\n Mr. Mohamad (Sudan): Following the adoption \r\nof resolution 64/1, I have the honour to deliver this \r\nstatement on behalf of the States members of the Group \r\nof 77 and China (G-77).  \r\n We greatly value South-South cooperation and \r\nlook forward to a successful outcome of the \r\nConference to be held from 1 to 3 December 2009 in \r\nNairobi. I wish to take this opportunity to express the \r\nGroup’s gratitude to the Government of Kenya for its \r\ngenerous offer to host the Conference. The Group also \r\nwishes to express its appreciation to our dear friend \r\nand colleague His Excellency Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz \r\nAl-Nasser, President of the High-level Committee on \r\nSouth-South Cooperation and Permanent \r\nRepresentative of the State of Qatar to the United \r\nNations; Mr. Raymond Landveld of Suriname, \r\nfacilitator; Mr. Nor Eddine Benfreha of Algeria, G-77 \r\ncoordinator; and all delegations for their support and \r\ncommitment in this important process. \r\n I wish to stress the G-77’s conceptual framework \r\nfor and principles of South-South cooperation as set \r\nout in the Yamoussoukro Consensus and reaffirmed at \r\nthe recent 33rd Annual Meeting of Ministers for \r\nForeign Affairs of the G-77, held here in New York on \r\n25 September 2009.  \r\n South-South cooperation is a common endeavour \r\nof peoples and countries of the South and must be \r\npursued as an expression of South-South solidarity and \r\na strategy for the economic independence and self-\r\nreliance of the South, based on their common \r\nobjectives and solidarity. South-South cooperation and \r\nits agenda must be driven by the countries of the South.  \r\n We also maintain that South-South cooperation \r\nmust not be seen as a replacement for North-South \r\ncooperation. Strengthening South-South cooperation \r\nmust not be a measure for coping with the receding \r\ninterest of the developed world in assisting developing \r\ncountries. In addition, cooperation between countries of \r\nthe South must not be analysed and evaluated using the \r\nsame standards as those used for North-South relations.  \r\n Furthermore, we maintain that financial \r\ncontributions from other developing countries should \r\nnot be seen as official development assistance from \r\nthose countries to other countries of the South. They \r\nare merely expressions of solidarity and cooperation \r\nborn of shared experiences and sympathies. South-\r\nSouth cooperation is a development agenda based on \r\npremises, conditions and objectives that are specific to \r\nthe historical and political context of developing \r\ncountries and to their needs and expectations.  \r\n South-South cooperation deserves its own \r\nseparate and independent promotion.  \r\n South-South cooperation respects national \r\nsovereignty in the context of shared responsibility, and \r\nit strives for strengthened multilateralism in the \r\npromotion of an action-oriented approach to \r\ndevelopment challenges.  \r\n South-South cooperation also promotes the \r\nexchange of best practices and support among \r\ndeveloping countries in the common pursuit of their \r\nbroad development objectives, and not just in the \r\ntraditional economic and technical areas. South-South \r\ncooperation is based on the collective self-reliance of \r\ndeveloping countries. The modalities and mechanisms \r\nfor promoting South-South cooperation are based on \r\nbilateral, subregional, regional and interregional \r\ncooperation and integration, as well as on multilateral \r\ncooperation. \r\n In conclusion, I wish to reiterate our commitment \r\nto, and support for, this process. We shall continue to \r\nwork towards the successful outcome of the High-level \r\nA/64/PV.15  \r\n \r\n09-54411 14 \r\n \r\nConference on South-South Cooperation, as well as to \r\nengage in a constructive dialogue with all our partners.  \r\n The President: I give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Qatar, who will speak in his capacity \r\nas President of the High-level Committee on South-\r\nSouth Cooperation. \r\n Mr. Al-Nasser (Qatar), President of the High-\r\nlevel Committee on South-South Cooperation (spoke in \r\nArabic): It is a source of great satisfaction for me that \r\nthe General Assembly has adopted resolution 64/1, on \r\nthe High-level Conference on South-South \r\nCooperation, which is to be held at the highest level at \r\nKenya’s capital of Nairobi from 1 to 3 December 2009. \r\nThe resolution sets out the Conference’s timing, \r\nobjectives, methods and organizational arrangements. I \r\nam very grateful to the Government of Kenya for its \r\ngenerous offer to host the Conference in Nairobi. I am \r\nconfident that it will live up to the expectations of \r\nMember States.  \r\n I am also certain that the Conference will be \r\namong the most important milestones in promoting and \r\nenhancing South-South cooperation. South-South \r\ncooperation is a component of triangular cooperation, \r\nwhich also includes cooperation between the countries \r\nof the North and the South on the economic, financial \r\nand technical levels. This nexus of cooperation cannot \r\nbe broken, as its components are interdependent and \r\ncomplementary to one another. \r\n The adoption of the resolution was the \r\nculmination of the tireless efforts that I have exerted in \r\nmy capacity as President of the High-level Committee \r\non South-South Cooperation. In that undertaking, I \r\nenjoyed the support of the President of the General \r\nAssembly, who will now launch negotiations on the \r\ndraft outcome of the Conference. I am grateful for the \r\nsincere desire of Member States to hold the Conference \r\nno later than the end of the current year, so that it can \r\ncoincide with the thirtieth anniversary of the Buenos \r\nAires Plan of Action for Promoting and Implementing \r\nTechnical Cooperation among Developing Countries.  \r\n I am also grateful to the delegation of Mexico, \r\nwhich supported one of the options raised during our \r\nmeeting last August, subsequently building upon it \r\nuntil Member States were able to reach a consensus \r\nformula on the substance of standards that are \r\nimportant to all, in the North and South alike. That \r\ntook place in the context of a series of conferences, \r\ndecisions and outcome documents related to the \r\npromotion of cooperation among developing countries. \r\nThey include the Doha Declaration on Financing for \r\nDevelopment, the Havana Programme of Action, which \r\nwas adopted during the South Summit, the Marrakesh \r\nFramework for the Implementation of South-South \r\nCooperation and the Doha Plan of Action, which was \r\nadopted by the second South Summit. \r\n As members are aware, the Conference is \r\nintended to evaluate the progress made in South-South \r\ncooperation, reaffirm goals and commitments to \r\nenhance that cooperation, exchange best practices and \r\nlessons learned and identify obstacles and constraints \r\nand the necessary measures and initiatives to overcome \r\nthem, including significant measures for implementing \r\nthe recommendations and obligations emanating from \r\nprevious conferences, as well as to address new \r\nchallenges and emerging issues. The Conference is also \r\nintended to provide an opportunity for decision makers \r\nto take advantage of the momentum in South-South \r\ncooperation, which can serve to strengthen their \r\ndevelopment strategies to achieve internationally \r\nagreed development goals, including the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. \r\n As is clear from the text of the resolution, it is \r\nproposed that the Conference be convened under the \r\ntheme of “Promotion of South-South cooperation for \r\ndevelopment”. The Conference will consist of plenary \r\nsessions and round tables on the following sub-themes: \r\nstrengthening the role of the United Nations system in \r\nsupporting South-South and triangular cooperation; \r\nand South-South and triangular cooperation for \r\ndevelopment. The Conference will result in an \r\nintergovernmentally agreed outcome. \r\n I wish to express my deep gratitude to the Special \r\nUnit for South-South Cooperation for its efforts to \r\nprovide substantive and technical support to the \r\npreparatory process for the Conference, as called for by \r\nthe resolution. \r\n In order to ensure that the Conference comes to a \r\nsuccessful conclusion, I appeal to Member States, the \r\nUnited Nations and its specialized agencies and \r\nprogrammes, international organizations, regional \r\ncommissions, international financial institutions, civil \r\nsociety organizations and representatives of the private \r\nsector to contribute to the preparations and to establish \r\nthe conditions necessary for its success. I also urge \r\nthem to participate in it, in accordance with the rules of \r\nprocedure of the General Assembly.  \r\n A/64/PV.15\r\n \r\n15 09-54411 \r\n \r\n I also call upon Member States to provide \r\nfinancial assistance to developing and least developed \r\ncountries, through the United Nations Fund for South-\r\nSouth Cooperation, to enable them to participate in the \r\nConference. I would also like to take this opportunity \r\nto encourage Member States to provide voluntary \r\ncontributions to support the Government of Kenya in \r\nsuccessfully preparing for the Conference, especially in \r\nthe light of the current difficult global economic and \r\nfinancial conditions.  \r\n I also hope that the outcome of the Conference \r\nwill include a declaration and plan of action agreed \r\nupon by Governments to strengthen and enhance the \r\nfuture of South-South cooperation and to make such \r\ncooperation pivotal in assisting countries of the South \r\nto achieve sustained economic growth and combat the \r\nscourges of unemployment, poverty and other \r\ndevelopment challenges that affect the interests of the \r\ninternational community as a whole. \r\n Mrs. Masot Planas (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThe delegation of Cuba would like to express its \r\ngratitude for the hospitality of the Government of \r\nKenya and for the efforts made by the Government of \r\nQatar through its presidency of the High-level \r\nCommittee on South-South Cooperation, as well as \r\nthose of Suriname as facilitator of the process.  \r\n The delegation of Cuba joined the consensus on \r\nresolution 64/1, which was adopted today and which \r\ndecides to convene the High-level United Nations \r\nConference on South-South Cooperation. That is an \r\nillustration of the importance we attach to the \r\nConference. \r\n Everyone is aware of Cuba’s position throughout \r\nthe negotiations, which became unnecessarily difficult. \r\nThe main goal of the Group of 77 and China was to \r\nsubmit a procedural draft resolution that set aside \r\nsubstantive issues for consideration during negotiations \r\non the Conference’s outcome document. It is for that \r\nreason that we would like to express our views with \r\nregard to the reference in the resolution to the Doha \r\nDeclaration on Financing for Development. That \r\nreference is intended to establish a link between the so-\r\ncalled principles of aid effectiveness and South-South \r\ncooperation — a goal championed by developed \r\ncountries during the process. \r\n South-South cooperation constitutes a step \r\nforward in the economic and political paradigms of \r\ndeveloping countries — this can be seen from the \r\nefforts we undertake on our own initiative in favour of \r\ndevelopment, through the mobilization of resources \r\nthat exist in the South. Through South-South \r\ncooperation, our countries — with their diverse \r\neconomic, social, cultural and geographical structures, \r\nas well their diverse endowment with natural \r\nresources, among other things — have found \r\nopportunities to work in an economically \r\ncomplementary fashion, and a way to promote the \r\nexchange of ideas, experience, know-how, technical \r\nadvances, capacities and practical results, without any \r\nconditionality or interference in the internal affairs of \r\nother States, and on the basis of solidarity and mutual \r\nrespect. \r\n As various United Nations resolutions reflect, \r\nSouth-South cooperation is not a substitute for but a \r\ncomplement to North-South cooperation. If there exists \r\na genuine interest in helping the countries of the South \r\nto achieve their sustainable development goals, then \r\nwe wonder: why do the countries of the North continue \r\nto fail to meet their commitment to give 0.7 per cent of \r\nGDP as part of official development assistance? Why is \r\nthere an effort to focus attention on the so-called \r\nprinciples for making “effective” use of aid? This is \r\npart of the tired discourse of the donors, seeking to \r\nimpose their conditions and to interfere in decisions \r\nthat should be taken by the countries of the South \r\nalone. Cuba rejects the attempt to use these \r\n“principles” as a foundation for South-South \r\ncooperation — cooperation in which our countries \r\nengage on the basis of solidarity and respect. \r\n Cuba does not consider the specific mention of \r\nthe Doha Declaration on Financing for Development \r\nnecessary in a procedural resolution. In the same way, \r\nwe will reject any attempt to prejudice the final \r\ndocument of the Conference with elements that have \r\nno relation to the principles relevant to South-South \r\ncooperation. \r\n I should like to conclude by reiterating the \r\nunequivocal commitment of the Cuban delegation to \r\nthe holding of the Conference on South-South \r\nCooperation. Together with the rest of the countries of \r\nthe South which share in such cooperation, Cuba has a \r\ngreat deal to contribute to the Conference, stemming \r\nfrom the experiences and initiatives carried out by our \r\ncountry across the economic, social, technical and \r\ncultural fields. We hope that the Conference will \r\ncontribute to financing intraregional and interregional \r\nagreements on cooperation, and that it will be a step \r\nA/64/PV.15  \r\n \r\n09-54411 16 \r\n \r\nforward towards achieving the goals of eradicating \r\nhunger, eliminating poverty, providing access, as a \r\nbasic right, to education and health to all citizens, as \r\nwell as closing the gap that separates the countries of \r\nthe North and the South. \r\n Ms. Loza (Nicaragua) (spoke in Spanish): My \r\ndelegation associates itself with the statement made by \r\nthe representative of the Sudan on behalf of the Group \r\nof 77 and China. We express our gratitude to the \r\ndelegations of Kenya, Qatar, Suriname and Algeria for \r\ntheir efforts. \r\n Resolution 64/1, entitled “High-Level United \r\nNations Conference on South-South Cooperation”, is \r\nthe result of broad consultations and negotiations to \r\nachieve consensus. However, my delegation should \r\nlike to explain its position and its understanding \r\nregarding certain points contained in the resolution we \r\nhave just adopted. \r\n Nicaragua does not accept and will never accept \r\nany type of conditionality applicable to South-South \r\ncooperation. Nor will it accept the imposition of \r\nguidelines that are not in line with the basic principles \r\nof South-South cooperation. In this sense, the only \r\nreason my delegation joined the consensus on citing \r\nthe Doha Declaration on Financing for Development is \r\nthe linkage with triangular cooperation that appears in \r\nthat document. We do not see our acceptance of that \r\nreference as extending to other points covered in that \r\ndocument. \r\n In our view, the notion of aid effectiveness and its \r\nprinciples are not applicable to South-South \r\ncooperation, which has its own fundamental principles. \r\nThe intention on the part of developed countries to \r\ninclude it in this context is yet another attempt to elude \r\ntheir responsibilities with respect to meeting their \r\nofficial development assistance commitments and to \r\nimpose conditionalities on cooperation that is based on \r\nsolidarity among the countries of the South. \r\n It is offensive to see how developed countries — \r\nin particular, those that do not meet the guideline of \r\n0.7 per cent of GDP for official development \r\nassistance — are trying to impose a series of rules that \r\nrun counter to the very basis of South-South \r\ncooperation. That is something that we will simply not \r\nallow. \r\n Today, more than ever, the people of Nicaragua \r\nenjoy, among other things, free health care and \r\neducation. Our sons and daughters benefit from a \r\nschool feeding programme that the Food and \r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations has \r\nheld up as one of the four best in the world. And this is \r\nthanks to South-South cooperation — disinterested and \r\nunconditional aid from countries of the South. \r\n In this context, Nicaragua reaffirms the principles \r\nof South-South cooperation — in particular, solidarity, \r\ncomplementarity, fair treatment, equal sovereignty of \r\nStates, self-determination of peoples and \r\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of States. All of \r\nthose principles are contained in the various documents \r\nof the Group of 77 and China relating to South-South \r\ncooperation, including the Buenos Aires Plan of Action \r\nand the Havana Programme of Action.  \r\n Similarly, we underline the strictly \r\ncomplementary nature of South-South cooperation with \r\nregard to North-South cooperation. When the idea of a \r\nUnited Nations conference on South-South cooperation \r\narose, the point was to find a way in which the United \r\nNations could support developing countries with \r\nconcerted actions and measures to strengthen and \r\nimprove cooperation among ourselves. We hope that \r\nthis goal will be met through an action-oriented final \r\ndocument that will be based on the guidelines for \r\nSouth-South cooperation and will enable developing \r\ncountries to strengthen our cooperative trade and reach \r\nour national development objectives. \r\n Mr. Bachmann (Switzerland): After a long \r\nnegotiation process on modalities, Switzerland \r\nexpresses its gratitude to all the delegations that \r\nparticipated, to the President of the High-Level \r\nCommittee for South-South Cooperation and to the \r\ndistinguished facilitator from the Republic of Suriname \r\nfor their tireless efforts. \r\n As the importance of South-South cooperation, as \r\na complement to North-South cooperation, has grown \r\nenormously in recent years, we find it timely for the \r\nGeneral Assembly to consider constructively what has \r\nbeen achieved so far, the lessons learned and what \r\nrecommendations can be made for future action. \r\n We believe in the potential complementarity \r\nbetween South-South and North-South cooperation, \r\nincluding through triangular cooperation, and we hope \r\nsynergies can be developed between them. For this to \r\nhappen, it is important to clarify the complementarities \r\nand commonalities between South-South and North-\r\nSouth cooperation. If traditional donors are to increase \r\n A/64/PV.15\r\n \r\n17 09-54411 \r\n \r\nemphasis on South-South cooperation, it is essential \r\nthat we understand its functioning, its potential impact \r\non national capacities and its accountability \r\nmechanisms. \r\n As there is only a short time left before the start \r\nof the Conference, we hope that the preparation \r\nprocess will be efficient. The presentation of a \r\nworkplan, so that we can harmonize agendas with other \r\nprocesses, would be most welcome. \r\n Finally, I should like to thank, again, the \r\nGovernment of Kenya for agreeing to host this \r\nimportant Conference and for the patience it has shown \r\nthroughout the process so far. Thirty years after Buenos \r\nAires, South-South cooperation deserves a successful \r\ninternational conference to celebrate its achievements \r\nto date and to contribute to effective and better \r\nintegrated South-South cooperation. \r\n Mr. Muita (Kenya): I take this opportunity to \r\nexpress appreciation to you, Sir, as well as to your \r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Miguel d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann, for your spirited efforts to ensure that the \r\nHigh-level United Nations Conference on South-South \r\nCooperation takes place as agreed in resolutions \r\n62/209 and 63/233. I also wish to thank His Excellency \r\nMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of the State of Qatar, in his capacity as \r\nPresident of the High-level Committee on South-South \r\nCooperation, for his enthusiasm and tireless efforts in \r\nthis regard. \r\n The Government of Kenya welcomes the \r\nadoption of resolution 64/1 and strongly believes in \r\nSouth-South cooperation as a viable mechanism for \r\npromoting the development of countries of the South, \r\nincluding through sharing of experiences, promotion of \r\ntrade, transfer of appropriate and affordable \r\ntechnology, and investment. We underscore the \r\ncomplementary role of South-South cooperation to the \r\ntraditional North-South cooperation. The important \r\nrole played by development partners in promoting \r\nSouth-South cooperation cannot be overemphasized. \r\nEqually important is the role of the United Nations in \r\nnurturing and promoting South-South cooperation. \r\n It is within the context of the above \r\nunderstanding that Kenya offered to host the \r\nConference as part of our contribution to what we \r\nconsider a noble objective. I wish, however, to observe \r\nthat negotiations on the modalities of the resolution \r\nintroduced some anxious moments. For instance, there \r\nwere times when Kenya was tempted to reconsider \r\naltogether its decision to host the Conference. \r\nHowever, thanks to the encouragement and \r\ndetermination shown by many delegations, we decided \r\nto stay the course.  \r\n In the midst of global and national challenges, I \r\nhave the confidence that the adoption of resolution \r\n64/1 on the High-level United Nations Conference on \r\nSouth-South Cooperation this afternoon provides all \r\ndelegations a momentous opportunity to show the \r\nworld that there is no crisis or issue that can shake the \r\nunity and focus of the United Nations. This is the spirit \r\nthat should guide us as we proceed forward. \r\n With less than two months to go before the early \r\nDecember 2009 date for the Conference, the Kenya \r\ndelegation calls upon all Member States, the United \r\nNations system and other stakeholders to fully \r\ncooperate and support the final preparatory processes \r\nwith a view to ensuring a successful conference. \r\n The adoption of this resolution brings a high \r\nsense of urgency to all stakeholders. Each one of us has \r\na responsibility that we must discharge efficiently and \r\neffectively. As this is a United Nations conference, the \r\nKenya delegation has full trust and confidence, Sir, in \r\nyour leadership and guidance. The Kenya Government \r\nis ready to do its part. Furthermore, my delegation calls \r\nupon all delegations to demonstrate a high sense of \r\ncommitment, cooperation and diligence in the \r\nnegotiation of the outcome document and other related \r\nissues, so that the Conference will reflect our common \r\nendeavour for successful South-South cooperation. \r\n To conclude, I express our appreciation to all \r\ndelegations for accepting the offer of Kenya to host the \r\nConference. I take this early opportunity to welcome \r\nall Member States to Nairobi. We shall soon be sharing \r\nwith you information regarding the logistics and \r\nfacilitation for the Conference. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I thank Kenya and its \r\nGovernment for kindly offering to host this important \r\nConference and for their continued support. The \r\nConference will undoubtedly be very successful.  \r\n The General Assembly has thus concluded this \r\nstage of its consideration of agenda item 114. \r\nThe meeting rose at 4.55 p.m. \r\n"
