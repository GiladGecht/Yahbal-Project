(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 136 \r\n \r\nScale of assessments for the apportionment of the \r\nexpenses of the United Nations  \r\n \r\n  Report of the Fifth Committee (A/64/482) \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): If there is no \r\nproposal under rule 66 of the rules of procedure, may I \r\ntake it that the Assembly decides not to discuss the \r\nreport of the Fifth Committee that is before it? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): Statements will \r\ntherefore be limited to explanations of vote. The \r\npositions of delegations regarding the recommendation \r\nof the Fifth Committee have been made clear in the \r\nCommittee and are reflected in the relevant official \r\nrecords. \r\n I remind members that under paragraph 7 of \r\ndecision 34/401 the General Assembly agreed that \r\nwhen the same draft resolution is considered in a Main \r\nCommittee and in plenary meeting a delegation should, \r\nas far as possible, explain its vote only once, either in \r\nthe Committee or in the plenary meeting, unless that \r\ndelegation’s vote in plenary meeting is different from \r\nits vote in the Committee. I remind delegations that, \r\nalso in accordance with General Assembly decision \r\n34/401, explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes. \r\n Before we begin to take action on the \r\nrecommendation contained in the report, I advise \r\nrepresentatives that we shall proceed to take a decision \r\nin the same manner as in the Fifth Committee. \r\n The Assembly will now take a decision on the \r\ndraft resolution recommended by the Fifth Committee \r\nin paragraph 6 of its report. The Fifth Committee \r\nadopted the draft resolution, entitled “Scale of \r\nassessments for the apportionment of the expenses of \r\nthe United Nations: requests under Article 19 of the \r\nCharter”, without a vote. \r\n May I take it that the Assembly wishes to do the \r\nsame? \r\n The draft resolution was adopted (resolution \r\n64/2). \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The Assembly \r\nhas thus concluded this stage of its consideration of \r\nagenda item 136. \r\n \r\nAgenda items 73 and 74 \r\n \r\nReport of the International Criminal Tribunal for \r\nthe Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Genocide \r\nand Other Serious Violations of International \r\nHumanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of \r\nRwanda and Rwandan Citizens Responsible for \r\nGenocide and Other Such Violations Committed \r\nin the Territory of Neighbouring States between \r\n1 January and 31 December 1994  \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/64/206)  \r\n \r\nA/64/PV.16  \r\n \r\n09-54853 2 \r\n \r\nReport of the International Tribunal for the \r\nProsecution of Persons Responsible for Serious \r\nViolations of International Humanitarian Law \r\nCommitted in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia \r\nsince 1991  \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/64/205) \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): May I take it \r\nthat it is the wish of the Assembly to take note of the \r\nfourteenth annual report of the International Criminal \r\nTribunal for Rwanda? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): May I take it \r\nthat it is the wish of the Assembly to take note of the \r\nsixteenth annual report of the International Tribunal for \r\nthe Former Yugoslavia? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I call on \r\nMr. Dennis Byron, President of the International \r\nTribunal for Rwanda. \r\n Mr. Byron: I am greatly honoured to address the \r\nmembers of the General Assembly today. \r\n I extend my sincere congratulations to you, Sir, \r\non your election as President, and wish you a \r\nsuccessful tour of duty. \r\n The year 2009 marks a sad anniversary. Fifteen \r\nyears ago, between April and July 1994, genocide was \r\ncommitted in Rwanda; 800,000 or more people were \r\nkilled, and still more were mutilated, raped and \r\ntortured. Fifteen years later, efforts on all levels \r\ncontinue, in Rwanda and elsewhere, to cope with this \r\npast and to prevent similar atrocities from happening \r\nagain anywhere in the world. Courts and tribunals, on \r\nthe national and international levels, make up just one \r\nof many tools that are required in these efforts, but \r\nthey are essential for the aim of bringing justice to the \r\nvictims. \r\n This year also marks the fifteenth anniversary of \r\nthe International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, which \r\nwas established by Security Council resolution 955 \r\n(1994). The resolution gave the Tribunal, an organ of \r\njustice, a unique mandate, which included not only \r\nconducting trials, but also assisting with the restoration \r\nand maintenance of peace and contributing “to the \r\nprocess of national reconciliation” (Security Council \r\nresolution 955 (1994), seventh preambular \r\nparagraph) — an ambitious political goal. \r\n Looking back to where international criminal \r\njustice was 15 years ago, I do not think I exaggerate if \r\nI call the achievements of the Tribunal a milestone — \r\nboth for international law and for the international \r\nstriving for justice in the broader sense. \r\n The fourteenth annual report, covering the \r\nTribunal’s activities from 1 July 2008 to 30 June 2009, \r\nwhich I have the honour to present today, gives \r\nevidence of the intense work continuing at the \r\nTribunal. Every effort is being put into completing the \r\nfirst instance to the maximum extent possible in 2010 \r\nwithout compromising on strict standards of fair trial \r\nrights for the accused. \r\n Currently, seven trials involving 10 accused are \r\nin the evidence phase. Four of them will be completed \r\nthis year. Two more trials will commence shortly. This \r\nintense trial activity involved the rendering of over 800 \r\nwritten and oral decisions and orders.  \r\n In parallel, the Trial Chambers focus on the \r\ndelivery of judgements. Since 1 July 2008, they have \r\nrendered final judgements in eight cases involving 11 \r\naccused. By the end of this year, four more judgements \r\nwill be delivered.  \r\n In 2010, we expect the judgements in nearly all \r\ncurrently pending first-instance trials — that is, in 14 \r\ntrials against 24 accused. Possible spillovers concern \r\nmainly the Karemera et al. trial, which has been \r\ndelayed by the adverse health condition of one \r\naccused. \r\n While the Tribunal is putting every effort into \r\nhandling efficiently this enormous workload, three \r\njudges, from Fiji, Argentina and the Czech Republic, \r\nleft the Tribunal at the end of last year. Three new ad \r\nlitem judges, from the United Republic of Tanzania, \r\nMadagascar and Turkey, as well as a new permanent \r\njudge from the Russian Federation, have since joined \r\nus and have been assigned to a number of cases. Their \r\nmandates have been extended until the end of 2010. \r\n All judges work on several cases simultaneously. \r\nMany hear the evidence in one case while working on \r\njudgements in other cases. The judges have taken on \r\nthis challenging task with full commitment, and benefit \r\nfrom the essential support of very dedicated legal and \r\nadministrative staff. For the Tribunal and its \r\n A/64/PV.16\r\n \r\n3 09-54853 \r\n \r\ncompletion strategy, it is essential to ensure that all \r\njudges complete their current assignments. \r\n The 11 ad litem judges and the seven permanent \r\njudges at trial level handle a comparable workload and \r\nresponsibility. The remaining differences in their terms \r\nand conditions of service, in particular concerning their \r\nentitlement to a pension after many years of service, \r\nare therefore a serious source of concern. I sincerely \r\nhope that the Assembly will address this matter in a \r\nresolution as soon as possible. \r\n The Chambers of the Tribunals continue their \r\nefforts to improve the judicial management of trials, \r\nbut are always mindful that the ultimate limits to all \r\nmanagement efforts have to be, and indeed are, the fair \r\ntrial rights of the accused. \r\n From 1 July 2008 to date, the Appeals Chamber \r\nof the Tribunal, which is shared with the Tribunal for \r\nthe Former Yugoslavia, has delivered two judgements \r\nand more than 30 interlocutory and other decisions, \r\nincluding three which confirmed the denial of requests \r\nfor the referral of cases to national jurisdictions. \r\nCurrently, eight appeals from judgement are pending, \r\nwith further appeals expected in most, if not all, cases \r\ncurrently at first instance. In order to enable the \r\nAppeals Chamber to handle this high workload, \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1878 (2009), of last July, is \r\ntherefore of critical importance. It authorized an \r\nenlargement of the Appeals Chamber over the coming \r\nyears by up to eight additional judges. \r\n The high intensity of activity at both trial and \r\nappeals level also involved a particularly high \r\nworkload for Prosecutor Hassan Jallow and Registrar \r\nAdama Dieng and their respective offices. \r\n The Office of the Prosecutor focuses on securing \r\nthe arrest of the remaining fugitives. As of today, \r\n11 fugitives remain at large. I am pleased to report the \r\nsuccessful arrest and transfer of two accused from the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda to \r\nArusha in recent weeks. Grégoire Ndahimana made his \r\ninitial appearance before a judge of the Tribunal last \r\nweek, pleading not guilty on all charges against him. \r\nIdelphonse Nizeyimana, who was arrested last Monday, \r\nwill make his initial appearance next week. He is one \r\nof the four fugitives who are considered high-rank \r\nresponsible in the genocide and who are to be brought \r\nto trial before the Tribunal. For the other eight, \r\nProsecutor Jallow and Registrar Dieng continue \r\nworking with national authorities in order to ensure \r\nthat the conditions for a referral of their cases to \r\nnational jurisdictions are met.  \r\n As the Assembly may recall, two cases were \r\ntransferred from the Tribunal to France in 2007, while \r\nprevious requests for referral to Rwanda were denied \r\nby the Trial and Appeals Chambers because of fair trial \r\nconcerns. The emphasis of the Tribunal, supported by \r\nmany Member States, is now on technical support to \r\nenable renewed requests for referral to the country \r\nwhere the horrendous crimes alleged were committed. \r\n The Office of the Prosecutor also responds to an \r\nincreasing number of requests for cooperation from \r\nnational authorities that are themselves investigating \r\ncases of genocide and crimes against humanity, and \r\nwish to obtain, in particular, access to the \r\ncomprehensive archives of his Office. \r\n The Office of the Registrar coordinates all \r\nmatters of judicial and other cooperation between the \r\nTribunal and Member States. As the Assembly knows, \r\nthe Tribunal depends on State support and cooperation, \r\nand not only financially. I should only mention that \r\nindictees have been arrested and transferred to the \r\nTribunal from 26 countries, in Africa, Europe and \r\nNorth America. Seven countries have concluded \r\nagreements with the Tribunal allowing those convicted \r\nto serve sentences in their prisons. \r\n In the reporting period, I have rendered decisions \r\nfor the transfer of 18 convicts to Mali and Benin for \r\nthe enforcement of their sentence. Two acquitted \r\npersons remain for the time being in Arusha while the \r\nRegistrar continues his efforts to find a country of \r\nrelocation. I call once more for the support of all \r\nMember States to find, as in previous cases, \r\nsustainable solutions in this matter. \r\n In the pre-closure phase, the downsizing process \r\nhas begun. At the end of September, the contracts of \r\nover 50 staff members were not extended in sections \r\nwhere services were no longer considered essential. At \r\nthe same time, it is critical to ensure an adequate level \r\nof competent and experienced staff for the core \r\nactivities of the Tribunal — the conduct of trials and \r\nthe preparation of judgements. We are confronted with \r\na high departure rate in the face of the forthcoming \r\nclosure. The importance of the December 2008 \r\nAssembly resolution 63/256, which encouraged the \r\nextension of contracts “in accordance with the relevant \r\nprevailing trial schedules, in order to remove \r\nuncertainty with regard to future employment” \r\nA/64/PV.16  \r\n \r\n09-54853 4 \r\n \r\n(resolution 63/256, para. 5), can therefore not be \r\noverestimated. It has been a key political guideline for \r\nproviding staff with contract security and facilitating \r\nstaff retention. \r\n While we work on meeting the targets of our \r\ncompletion strategy, we also prepare the closure of our \r\nTribunal. Closing down an international court means \r\nnavigating in uncharted waters. We have been working \r\nintensively with United Nations Headquarters — in \r\nparticular, the Office of Legal Affairs — and the \r\nMember States in the Security Council, in discussing \r\nand assisting the drafting of the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to the Security Council on the residual \r\nmechanism that will take over remaining and \r\ncontinuous tasks after the Tribunal has closed down. \r\nSuch tasks could include trials if remaining fugitives \r\nare arrested, but also the supervision of witness \r\nprotection orders, the enforcement of sentences and, \r\nvery importantly, the management of the Tribunal’s \r\nvast archives. \r\n But, beyond the structure that will follow the \r\nTribunal in its concrete tasks, we will have to look and \r\nthink further past the legal achievements. What legacy \r\nwill the Tribunal leave to the victims, to the Great \r\nLakes region and to the international community? \r\n The answer must be a continuous and \r\ncomprehensive fight against impunity for those who \r\ncommitted genocide, war crimes and crimes against \r\nhumanity in Rwanda in 1994. The Tribunal was \r\nestablished by the Security Council to prosecute those \r\nmost responsible for the genocide. Those at lower \r\nlevels must be dealt with by national jurisdictions, in \r\nRwanda and third countries where genocide suspects \r\nare still residing.  \r\n Closure of the Tribunal must not send the wrong \r\nsignal to the many suspected of the worst crimes still \r\non the run that they can now breathe more easily. \r\nRather, national jurisdictions need to ensure that \r\ngenocide suspects are not finding sanctuary. The \r\nTribunal stands ready to assist national jurisdictions in \r\ntheir efforts to ensure that impunity does not prevail. \r\nTherefore, the Tribunal continues to work on capacity-\r\nbuilding, in particular through the opening of \r\ninformation centres, training activities and awareness-\r\nraising in Rwanda, but also, for example, through \r\nconferences with national prosecuting authorities and \r\nother prosecutors of international crimes from all over \r\nthe world. \r\n I thank the members of the Assembly for their \r\nsupport for the Tribunal over the last one and a half \r\ndecades. Recently, we submitted our budget request for \r\nthe next biennium, 2010-2011, and I call upon the \r\ninternational community to continue its support for our \r\nefforts to complete our mandate by providing us with \r\nthe necessary funds. I also ask for support in our \r\nefforts to ensure equity in the terms and conditions for \r\nall our judges. \r\n I say to the members of the Assembly: “Your \r\nGovernments have been our faithful and trustful \r\nsupporters, even in difficult times. We will not cease \r\nour efforts to deserve your trust and support, because \r\nyour support and our efforts have the same goal: to \r\nensure that impunity of those who commit genocide, \r\nwar crimes and crimes against humanity is not \r\nacceptable for an international community that is based \r\non the rule of law.” \r\n The ad hoc Tribunals for Rwanda and the former \r\nYugoslavia were the starting point of an amazing \r\ndevelopment of international criminal justice in the last \r\n15 years, followed by the Special Court for Sierra \r\nLeone, the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of \r\nCambodia, the Special Tribunal for Lebanon and the \r\npermanent International Criminal Court. At the same \r\ntime, more and more countries have changed or \r\nenacted national legislation so as to allow dedicated \r\nprosecutors and judges in their own jurisdictions to \r\nbring to justice the perpetrators of horrendous crimes, \r\neven if they are former prime ministers, military or \r\nreligious leaders or wealthy businessmen. \r\n Let us continue working together, nationally and \r\ninternationally, to make the ambitious goal of ending \r\nimpunity for genocide, war crimes and crimes against \r\nhumanity more and more of a reality every year. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I thank the President of the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. \r\n I now call on Mr. Patrick Robinson, President of \r\nthe International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. \r\n Mr. Robinson: At the outset, Mr. President, I \r\ntake the opportunity to congratulate you on your \r\nelection to the high office you now hold in the \r\nAssembly and to wish you every success. \r\n It is an honour to appear before the General \r\nAssembly today in my capacity as President of the \r\nUnited Nations International Criminal Tribunal for the \r\n A/64/PV.16\r\n \r\n5 09-54853 \r\n \r\nFormer Yugoslavia and to present to the Assembly the \r\nTribunal’s sixteenth annual report. \r\n I am proud to speak on behalf of an institution \r\nthat has had an unprecedented impact upon the \r\ndevelopment of international humanitarian law, \r\ninternational criminal law and international criminal \r\nprocedure. During the nearly 16 years of its operation, \r\nthe Tribunal has shown that international justice works, \r\nand it has led the way in putting an end to the culture \r\nof impunity. The Tribunal’s achievements would not \r\nhave been possible without the support of the members \r\nof the Assembly, and I take this opportunity to convey \r\nmy gratitude to them for the support they have given to \r\nthe Tribunal, support that remains essential to the \r\ncompletion of our work. \r\n The Tribunal’s commitment to its completion \r\nstrategy remains steadfast, and all our efforts are aimed \r\nat finishing the Tribunal’s work as quickly as possible \r\nin accordance with our mandate.  \r\n During the reporting period, three appeal \r\njudgements were rendered, bringing to 86 the number \r\nof appeal cases fully completed. Additionally, three \r\ntrial judgements were rendered, bringing to 50 the \r\nnumber of trials that have been heard. At our peak, we \r\nran eight trials simultaneously in three courtrooms, \r\ntaking advantage of gaps in trial schedules.  \r\n In that regard, I wish to give a special \r\ncommendation to the indefatigable efforts of the newly \r\nappointed Registrar and the staff of the Registry for the \r\nvery competent support they provide to the Chambers \r\nof the Tribunal and to the Office of the Prosecutor. \r\nWithout translation and interpretation, both in and out \r\nof court, without the support for victims and witnesses, \r\nwithout the technical assistance and the endless \r\nnumber of other services that are quietly and \r\nconsistently delivered by the Registry, the Tribunal \r\nwould immediately cease to function. \r\n Currently, only two cases remain at the pretrial \r\nstage, and they will commence this year. Our current \r\nestimates are that all but four of our trials will \r\nconclude in 2010, with three finishing in early 2011, \r\nand the final trial, that of Radovan Karadžić, ending in \r\nearly 2012. Unfortunately, there are two fugitives still \r\nat large: Ratko Mladić and Goran Hadžić. Failure to \r\nbring them to justice will leave a stain on the historic \r\ncontribution of the United Nations to peacebuilding in \r\nthe former Yugoslavia. I therefore urge Member States \r\nto do all within their power to ensure the apprehension \r\nof those fugitives as a matter of urgency. \r\n During my presidency, I have taken measures to \r\nensure the orderly completion of our work. A \r\ncomprehensive assessment of all present and \r\nanticipated appellate work has been carried out, and \r\nmid-2013 has been identified as the completion date of \r\nour proceedings. It is important to bear in mind that the \r\ndownsizing of the Tribunal, which commences in 2010, \r\nwill result in a reduction of staff by 40 per cent by the \r\nend of 2011. \r\n At the same time, the Tribunal is continually \r\nlooking for new and creative ways to increase the \r\nproductivity of our work. While it is impossible to \r\nforesee all causes of delay in a judicial environment, \r\nresponsible management dictates that potential \r\nobstacles be identified, controlled, and ultimately \r\ndispelled. \r\n One specific factor of critical concern to the \r\nTribunal is the retention of its highly qualified staff. \r\nThis I wish to stress because it is a factor that is not \r\nentirely within the Tribunal’s control. The importance \r\nof retaining the staff necessary for completing the \r\nTribunal’s work, while downsizing those whose tasks \r\nhave been discharged, places the Tribunal in an \r\nextraordinarily difficult position.  \r\n Upholding the morale of an institution during the \r\nfinal stages of its lifespan is a great challenge. Many \r\nstaff members will be tempted to seek more permanent \r\nemployment elsewhere, long before their posts in the \r\nTribunal are abolished. This is a great risk to the \r\nproductivity of our work. In fact, many have already \r\nleft, and currently we are losing staff at a rate of one a \r\nday. If that rate of attrition continued, by the end of the \r\nyear we would have lost 30 per cent of our staff. \r\n In that regard, I am extremely grateful to the \r\nGeneral Assembly for its adoption last year of \r\nresolution 63/256, which recognizes the difficulty and \r\nallows the Tribunal to offer contracts to staff, in line \r\nwith the dates of planned post reductions and in \r\naccordance with trial schedules. However, while that \r\nmeasure is beneficial, it is not enough. Highly qualified \r\nand professional staff, essential for the completion of \r\nthe Tribunal’s work, continue to depart at alarming \r\nrates. When a staff member who has served at the \r\nTribunal for a number of years decides to leave, the \r\nproblem that arises involves more than just filling a \r\nA/64/PV.16  \r\n \r\n09-54853 6 \r\n \r\nvacant post, a process that, incidentally, consumes \r\nprecious Tribunal resources in and of itself.  \r\n Our jurisdiction is a very specialized one, \r\nrequiring a high level of expertise and hands-on \r\nexperience, so that even a very knowledgeable and \r\nexperienced professional person needs time to obtain \r\nthe skills required to successfully function at the \r\nTribunal. The flow of essential staff away from the \r\nTribunal needs to be stemmed now. Failure to take \r\nswift action in this regard will extend the time needed \r\nfor the completion of the Tribunal’s mandate, because \r\nof its impact on the efficiency of our work. \r\n The Tribunal has long been active in bringing this \r\nmatter to the attention of Member States, but, other \r\nthan in resolution 63/256, to which I referred earlier, \r\nno further supportive action has been taken. I am aware \r\nthat significant changes to the contractual regime in the \r\nUnited Nations are on the Assembly’s fall agenda, \r\nchanges that could be of great assistance to our efforts \r\nto retain staff. In particular, the continuing \r\nappointments will offer some of the stability that we \r\nsorely need. The end-of-service grant is another \r\ninitiative that could help us to slow our attrition rate \r\nand ensure that we can complete our mandate as \r\nexpeditiously as possible. I also urge the Assembly to \r\nassist the Tribunal in devising other measures to retain \r\nits highly qualified staff. \r\n Another matter that I wish to bring to the \r\nAssembly’s attention is the work the Tribunal is \r\ncarrying out to ensure that it fulfils its mandate of \r\ncontributing to the maintenance of peace and security \r\nin the former Yugoslavia and to ensure that local \r\njurisdictions have the capacity to continue with the \r\nprosecution of war crimes cases in accordance with \r\nSecurity Council resolutions 1503 (2003) and 1534 \r\n(2004).  \r\n While working full speed on its trials and \r\nappeals, the Tribunal has enlisted the expertise of other \r\ninternational organizations and engaged in a series of \r\ncapacity-building initiatives. I am happy to report that \r\nthe projects brought to the Assembly’s attention last \r\nyear by my predecessor have now been concluded, \r\nresulting in the publication of a manual that describes \r\nthe practices of the Tribunal in unprecedented detail, as \r\nwell as giving a comprehensive assessment of \r\ncapacity-building efforts in domestic jurisdictions \r\nthroughout the former Yugoslavia. \r\n On the basis of that assessment, the Tribunal is \r\ndeepening its cooperation with the United Nations \r\nInterregional Crime and Justice Research Institute and \r\nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in \r\nEurope Office for Democratic Institutions. And, \r\ntogether with them, we are preparing an ambitious \r\nproject to guarantee that the national justice systems in \r\nthe region have the capacity to deal with their growing \r\nwar crimes caseload, as the Tribunal heads towards the \r\ncompletion of its core activities. Generous funding \r\nfrom the European Commission is expected for this \r\ntimely undertaking.  \r\n The Prosecutor’s Office has also been active in its \r\ncapacity-building efforts, forging strong partnerships \r\nwith its counterparts in the region. To this end, the \r\nProsecutor — again, with funding from the European \r\nCommission — has established a visiting professionals \r\nprogramme, under which prosecutors from the region \r\nwork with the Office of the Prosecutor on cases at the \r\nTribunal in The Hague. \r\n There is another matter that I feel obliged to \r\nbring to the Assembly’s attention, one that I strongly \r\nbelieve must be addressed if there is to be lasting peace \r\nand reconciliation in the region. I refer to \r\ncompensation to victims for the atrocities they suffered \r\nduring the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia. As \r\nPresident of the Tribunal, I have met on numerous \r\noccasions with victims’ groups, which have expressed \r\ntheir anguish at the failure of the international \r\ncommunity to provide any kind of compensation for \r\ntheir suffering.  \r\n In many respects, the victims feel that they have \r\nbeen forgotten by the international community and that \r\ntheir rights have been disregarded. With respect to their \r\nright to compensation, I must agree that the \r\ninternational community has forgotten them. Currently, \r\nthere is no effective mechanism by which victims can \r\nseek compensation for their injuries, despite the fact \r\nthat their right to such compensation is firmly rooted in \r\ninternational law.  \r\n I need only refer to the Assembly’s 1985 \r\nDeclaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims \r\nof Crime and Abuse of Power (resolution 40/34, \r\nannex), but reference can also be made to the “Basic \r\nprinciples and guidelines on the right to a remedy and \r\nreparation for victims of violations of international \r\nhuman rights and humanitarian law”, referred to by the \r\nCommission on Human Rights in its resolution \r\n A/64/PV.16\r\n \r\n7 09-54853 \r\n \r\n2000/41, adopted in April 2000. The Statute of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court provision addressing \r\nvictim compensation contrasts sharply with the absence \r\nof comparable provisions in our Statute. \r\n Those instruments were established by the \r\ninternational community because justice is not only \r\nabout punishing perpetrators, but also about restoring \r\ndignity to victims by ensuring that they have concrete \r\nmeans to rebuild their lives. The Declaration itself \r\nidentifies sources of compensation, including the \r\noffender, or national funds, but in circumstances where \r\nthe State is unable to compensate the victim it proposes \r\nthat other funds be established for the purpose.  \r\n Former Tribunal President Jorda brought the \r\nmatter to the attention of the Security Council in \r\nNovember 2000, in a letter suggesting that \r\n“the President of the Security Council \r\nrecommend to the Council and to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that methods of compensating victims of \r\ncrimes in the former Yugoslavia, notably a claims \r\ncommission, be considered by the appropriate \r\norgans of the General Assembly”. (S/2000/1063, \r\nappendix, para. 48)  \r\nBut, sadly, to date nothing has been done, and I fear \r\nthat failure by the international community to address \r\nthe needs of victims of the conflicts that occurred in \r\nthe former Yugoslavia will undermine the Tribunal’s \r\nefforts to contribute to long-term peace and stability in \r\nthe region. That is why I implore the Assembly to \r\nsupport the establishment of a claims commission as a \r\nmethod of complementing the Tribunal’s work by \r\ncompensating victims of crimes in the former \r\nYugoslavia. \r\n In closing, I would like to reflect once again upon \r\nthe tremendous achievements of the Tribunal. Its \r\nestablishment in 1993 ushered in a new era in \r\ninternational affairs and led to the establishment of \r\nother international criminal justice institutions. In that \r\nregard, the impact of the Tribunal on the development \r\nof international justice has been profound. I urge the \r\nGeneral Assembly to ensure that this work is not \r\nunnecessarily tarnished by the continuing flight from \r\njustice of the remaining two fugitives. \r\n I would also like to re-emphasize that the \r\nTribunal is doing all it can to complete its work \r\nexpeditiously and fairly, while upholding the highest \r\nstandards of a United Nations international court. But \r\nif the Tribunal is to meet its current target dates it \r\nneeds the help of Member States in ensuring that the \r\norderly completion of its work is not hampered by the \r\ndeparture of its highly qualified and still very \r\nnecessary staff. \r\n Together we strive towards the same objective: \r\nfighting impunity and bringing justice to victims of \r\ngross violations of international law. As the Tribunal \r\ncompletes its mandate, the torch will be passed to the \r\njudges, prosecutors and defence counsel in the former \r\nYugoslavia to continue this ambitious endeavour. \r\n Mr. Ban Ki-moon, in his remarks on 17 July 2008 \r\nat the commemoration here at United Nations \r\nHeadquarters of the tenth anniversary of the adoption \r\nof the Rome Statute of the International Criminal \r\nCourt, stated that the  \r\n“fight against impunity started in earnest with the \r\nestablishment of the International Criminal \r\nTribunals for the Former Yugoslavia and for \r\nRwanda. These courts pioneered the emergence \r\nof international criminal justice, and the \r\nenforcement of international humanitarian law”. \r\n It is our hope that the entrenchment of justice and \r\nthe rule of law will lead to lasting peace and prosperity \r\nin the former Yugoslavia, a peace and prosperity so \r\njustly deserved.  \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf of \r\nthe Assembly, I thank the President of the International \r\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. \r\n Mr. Lidén (Sweden): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of the European Union. Croatia, the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Albania, Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina, Montenegro, the Republic of Moldova, \r\nArmenia and Georgia align themselves with this \r\nstatement. \r\n This year, once again, the European Union \r\nreaffirms its unwavering support for the work of the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) \r\nand the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former \r\nYugoslavia (ICTY). As Judge Patrick L. Robinson, \r\nPresident of the International Criminal Tribunal for the \r\nFormer Yugoslavia and Judge Charles Michael Dennis \r\nByron, President of the International Criminal Tribunal \r\nfor Rwanda, have just shown in their presentations, the \r\nTribunals are making invaluable contributions to our \r\nshared goal of ending impunity for serious \r\ninternational crimes. The European Union thanks them \r\nA/64/PV.16  \r\n \r\n09-54853 8 \r\n \r\nboth for their excellent reports, and commends them \r\nfor their efforts to successfully complete the work of \r\nthe Tribunals. The European Union also pays special \r\ntribute to the relentless work of all the staff of the \r\nTribunals. \r\n Since their establishment the Tribunals have \r\nserved as an inspiration to the international community \r\nby refusing to let perpetrators of heinous crimes escape \r\njustice. This sends a clear signal that war crimes, \r\ngenocide or crimes against humanity will not go \r\nunpunished, and fosters a culture of accountability.  \r\n The Tribunals have played key roles in \r\nstrengthening the rule of law and promoting long-term \r\nstability and reconciliation, and not only in the Balkans \r\nand Rwanda. Their work has had far wider effects than \r\nthat. The Tribunals have been forerunners and ground-\r\nbreakers in their development of case law and \r\njurisprudence, making invaluable contributions to \r\ninternational humanitarian law and international \r\ncriminal law. Their contributions span from making \r\nessential definitions regarding the reach of \r\ninternational humanitarian law to the important finding \r\nthat rape and sexual violence with the intent to destroy \r\na protected group as such can constitute genocide. \r\n The work of the two Tribunals has shown that \r\ninternational criminal law is an enforceable body of \r\nlaw. This contributed to and accelerated the elaboration \r\nand adoption of the Rome Statute of the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC) in 1998, to which the European \r\nUnion reaffirms its strong commitment. Neither the \r\nTribunals nor the ICC were ever intended to replace \r\nnational courts. This principle has guided them and the \r\ninternational community also to engage actively in the \r\nstrengthening of national judicial systems. \r\n In recognition of strengthened domestic capacity, \r\nthe Security Council in its resolutions 1503 (2003) and \r\n1534 (2004) called on the ICTY and ICTR to transfer \r\nall lower and mid-level accused back to competent \r\nnational jurisdictions in the region for trial by domestic \r\ncourts. The ongoing strengthening of the Rwandan \r\nlegal system and its ability to adjudicate cases from the \r\nICTR will, hopefully, permit the ICTR to transfer such \r\ndefendants to the Rwandan courts and thus allow the \r\nTribunal to fulfil its completion strategy. These \r\nstrengthening efforts have been fully supported by the \r\nEuropean Union. We note with appreciation the efforts \r\nmade by Rwanda to meet the demands regarding the \r\nright to a fair trial. \r\n Despite continuing appeals by the international \r\ncommunity, 13 accused remain at large, 2 indicted by \r\nthe ICTY and 11 indicted by the ICTR. The failure to \r\narrest these accused remains a grave concern to the \r\nEuropean Union. Among those still at large are key \r\nindictees allegedly responsible for the most serious \r\natrocities, such as Ratko Mladić and Félicien Kabuga. \r\n The EU commends the cooperation of the \r\nUgandan authorities and INTERPOL which led to the \r\nvery recent arrest and transfer to the ICTR of one of \r\nthe top accused who is facing multiple charges of \r\ngenocide and crimes against humanity. While there are \r\nmany commendable instances of cooperation, the \r\nEuropean Union continues to urge all States to \r\ncooperate immediately and unconditionally with both \r\nTribunals in full adherence with their obligations under \r\nthe relevant Security Council resolutions regarding the \r\narrest and surrender of remaining fugitives, and the \r\ntransfer of any documents requested by the Prosecutor. \r\n The European Union remains committed to \r\nensuring that all indictees face justice. In this regard, \r\nthe EU recalls that cooperation with the ICTY is \r\nessential in relation to the EU stabilization and \r\nassociation process. \r\n The EU encourages States to conclude \r\nagreements on the enforcement of sentences and on the \r\nrelocation of witnesses, indispensable for the effective \r\nimplementation of the Tribunals’ work. \r\n The Tribunals are approaching the end of their \r\nwork. They were not intended to be permanent, and \r\nwill cease to exist when the Security Council deems \r\nthat the work for which they were set up has been \r\naccomplished. We look forward to that moment, as it \r\nwill mark the end of the Tribunals’ mission and \r\nconfirm their undisputed success. \r\n The European Union takes note of the estimated \r\ndelay in meeting the original completion strategy \r\ndeadlines due to a number of factors, including the late \r\ncapture and transfer of fugitive indictees. The EU urges \r\nthe Tribunals to continue to identify further measures \r\nto complete their work as efficiently and promptly as \r\npossible. We acknowledge the importance of the \r\nTribunals’ being granted appropriate resources to \r\nenable them to complete the proceedings as soon as \r\npossible without compromising due process. \r\n The European Union is committed to preserving \r\nthe legacy of the Tribunals after their closure. As \r\n A/64/PV.16\r\n \r\n9 09-54853 \r\n \r\nalready stated, their contribution has not been limited \r\nto the development of case law. Their practice and \r\nexperience on how to prosecute and prevent crimes \r\nagainst humanity, genocide and war crimes have been \r\nequally extensive, and should be transferred to \r\ninternational and national jurisdictions. \r\n The European Union therefore warmly welcomes \r\nthe publication by the ICTY, assisted by the United \r\nNations Interregional Crime and Justice Research \r\nInstitute, of a manual of its developed practices for use \r\nby other domestic and international courts. We also \r\nwelcome the report produced collaboratively by the \r\nICTY, the Organization for Security and Cooperation \r\nin Europe and the United Nations on the capacity-\r\nbuilding needs of the local judiciaries dealing with war \r\ncrimes proceedings in the region concerned. \r\n The EU further welcomes the work on residual \r\nissues by the Security Council’s Informal Working \r\nGroup on International Tribunals, including identifying \r\nwhich functions need to continue after the two \r\nTribunals have completed their work. We highly value \r\nthe open and transparent discussions under Austrian \r\nchairmanship on those issues. The EU fully supports \r\nthe establishment of mechanisms to deal with residual \r\nfunctions. We stand ready to work with the Council to \r\nfind the most appropriate, cost-effective solutions to \r\nthe residual and legacy issues. \r\n Mr. Morrill (Canada) (spoke in French): I have \r\nthe honour to speak on behalf of Canada, Australia and \r\nNew Zealand — the CANZ delegations. \r\n First, Canada, Australia and New Zealand pay \r\ntribute to the International Criminal Tribunal for the \r\nFormer Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), whose \r\npioneering work has made a significant contribution \r\ntowards ensuring accountability by those responsible \r\nfor the most serious international crimes: genocide, \r\ncrimes against humanity, and war crimes. \r\n By bringing to justice the perpetrators of such \r\ncrimes, the Tribunals have helped to strengthen the rule \r\nof law and to promote long-term stability and \r\nreconciliation in the Balkans and in Rwanda. Their \r\nwork shows that peace and justice can go hand in hand. \r\nThe jurisprudence of both Tribunals also forms a \r\nsignificant part of their legacy, one which will be \r\ndrawn upon for many years to come. \r\n CANZ welcomes the capture of Idelphonse \r\nNizeyimana and his transfer to the ICTR, and commends \r\nthe remarkable cooperation of the Government of \r\nUganda in that endeavour. In order for the Tribunals to \r\ncomplete their work it is imperative that all the \r\nremaining indictees be surrendered, particularly Ratko \r\nMladić, Goran Hadžić and Félicien Kabuga. States that \r\ncontinue to help these fugitives escape international \r\njustice undermine not only our common fight against \r\nimpunity, but their own commitment to the rule of law. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n CANZ appreciates the efforts being made by both \r\nTribunals towards achieving the goals outlined in their \r\nrespective completion strategies. We note as well the \r\nrecent Security Council resolutions extending the terms \r\nof office of the judges of the ICTY and the ICTR. \r\nCANZ continues to urge both Tribunals to identify \r\nmeasures that will enable them to complete their work \r\nas efficiently and promptly as possible, including the \r\ntransfer of cases to national courts where appropriate. \r\nWe hope that the further steps that Rwanda has taken \r\nover the last year to strengthen its judicial system will \r\nsee the first cases referred to Rwanda in the near \r\nfuture. \r\n With both Tribunals working towards the end of \r\ntheir mandates, a vital aspect of concluding the \r\nTribunals’ work is how to address the associated \r\nresidual issues of completion, including enforcement of \r\nsentences, the continuing protection of witnesses, \r\ndetention issues, future applications by convicted \r\npersons, and the preservation and protection of archives. \r\n CANZ welcomes the important steps that have \r\nbeen taken already by both the ICTR and the ICTY to \r\ndeal with residual issues. In fact, residual issues \r\nflowing out of the ending of the work of the \r\nICTR/ICTY are the subject of an informal meeting \r\nconvened by Austria as the Chair of the Security \r\nCouncil’s Informal Working Group on International \r\nTribunals that is taking place on this very day. \r\n While every situation is different, CANZ believes \r\nthat lessons learned and solutions found in the \r\nICTR/ICTY context may also be applicable to other \r\ntribunals, such as the Special Court for Sierra Leone, \r\nthe Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia \r\nand the Special Tribunal for Lebanon. Equally, the \r\nwork being done in other tribunals on residual issues \r\ncan help to inform the discussions relating to the \r\nICTR/ICTY. We note past and current efforts of \r\nA/64/PV.16  \r\n \r\n09-54853 10 \r\n \r\nexchange between the tribunals. We also encourage \r\nfurther discussion within the international community \r\nto ensure that the lessons learned and the mechanisms \r\ndeveloped in one tribunal are examined for potential \r\napplication to others. We are also pleased to note that \r\nCanada will support a workshop on residual issues to \r\nbe held here in New York early next year. \r\n The ICTY and the ICTR continue to contribute \r\nsignificantly to the fight against impunity. The \r\nsuccessful completion of their work relies on the \r\ncooperation and support of all States. We call upon \r\nStates to give practical effect to their commitment to an \r\neffective system of international criminal justice. For \r\nour part, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand will \r\ncontinue to offer the Tribunals our full support and \r\ncooperation in this vital dosing stage of their existence. \r\n Mr. Starčević (Serbia): Having heard the \r\npresentation of the annual report of the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), \r\nby its President, Judge Patrick Robinson, I would like \r\nto express my satisfaction with the comprehensive \r\napproach taken in the report, as well as with the \r\nappraisal given to the efforts of my Government. In \r\nthis connection, I once again pledge Serbia’s full \r\ncommitment to fulfilling its international obligations \r\nwith regard to cooperation with the ICTY. A successful \r\nconclusion of cooperation with the ICTY remains one \r\nof the utmost priorities of the Government of Serbia. In \r\nthat respect, we attach importance to the visit of Judge \r\nRobinson to Belgrade last July, the first such visit of a \r\nPresident of the ICTY to Serbia. The visit provided \r\nadditional impetus and encouragement to the efforts \r\nthat my country is making. \r\n The level of cooperation with the ICTY, especially \r\nas regards access to archives and provision of \r\ndocuments to the Tribunal, witness protection and the \r\nprovision of waivers for testifying in the proceedings, \r\nprovides ample proof of the commitment of the \r\nGovernment of Serbia and its relevant authorities to \r\nfull cooperation with the ICTY.  \r\n We also note with appreciation the assessment \r\nthat the professionalism and efficiency of our services \r\ninvolved in the search for fugitives has generally \r\nimproved. Cooperation with, and monitoring by, the \r\nOffice of the Prosecutor, as well as other relevant \r\ninternational factors, give further testimony that every \r\neffort is being made in tracking down the last two \r\nremaining fugitives, apprehending them and bringing \r\nthem to justice. The capture of Ratko Mladić and \r\nGoran Hadžić, for my country, remains not only an \r\ninternational obligation, but also an indication of our \r\nacceptance of international standards with respect to \r\nindividual responsibility for war crimes and other \r\nviolations of international humanitarian law. \r\n Let me express our firm conviction that the fight \r\nagainst impunity is in the common interest of all the \r\npeoples of the former Yugoslavia. Having witnessed a \r\ntrend of increased regional cooperation in the processing \r\nof persons indicted for war crimes, we are convinced \r\nthat further strengthening of national judicial capacities \r\ncontributes in the best way to the realization of \r\nuniversal principles of justice and fairness.  \r\n In that sense, it is important to acknowledge that, \r\n15 years following the conflict, new realities have \r\nemerged in our region, especially improved relations \r\nand cooperation between States, as well as restored \r\nadministrative capacities. We therefore believe that \r\nwhat is needed is that the competent organs of the \r\nUnited Nations reconsider and revise their position on \r\nthe serving of prison sentences by convicted persons in \r\ntheir home countries. We hope that the ICTY will lend \r\nits support to the aspirations and intentions of the \r\ncountries of the region in this regard. \r\n Speaking about cooperation within our region, I \r\nwould also like to remind the General Assembly of one \r\nnegative example. Media in Serbia and neighbouring \r\ncountries have widely reported that documents, \r\nincluding United Nations Interim Administration \r\nMission in Kosovo documents, pertaining to the \r\nexistence of clandestine clinics where abducted Serbs \r\nfrom Kosovo were taken to suffer the worst fate of \r\nbeing subjected to the forced harvesting of organs till \r\ndeath, the practice highlighted in the book of former \r\nICTY prosecutor Carla Del Ponte, were destroyed. The \r\nlegal bodies of Serbia issued an appeal for assistance, \r\nincluding by the ICTY, in the conduct of its \r\ninvestigation of this grave matter. \r\n Serbia’s unequivocal support for the Tribunal was \r\ndemonstrated by the adoption of an official position by \r\nthe Government of the Republic of Serbia on 13 March \r\n2009 in relation to the residual mechanism and \r\ncompletion strategy of the ICTY. That position has \r\nbeen duly circulated to the members of the Security \r\nCouncil. We also remain committed to our position on \r\nthe issue of ICTY archives, circulated in November \r\n A/64/PV.16\r\n \r\n11 09-54853 \r\n \r\n2008, and stand ready to support all initiatives that \r\ncould expedite the remaining work of the Tribunal. \r\n Mr. Wetland (Norway): I start by expressing \r\nNorway’s continuing support for, and full recognition \r\nof, the achievements and high standards of the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunals for Rwanda and the \r\nFormer Yugoslavia, as reflected in the Tribunals’ well-\r\nreasoned judgements and the annual reports before us. \r\nWe thank the Presidents of the two Tribunals, Judges \r\nByron and Robinson, for their detailed and informative \r\nreports, which describe the progress made during the \r\nlast year. \r\n The Tribunals’ work has been crucial in \r\nadvancing justice and the rule of law in Rwanda and \r\nthe former Yugoslavia. The Tribunals will leave a \r\nlegacy of international jurisprudence that can guide \r\ncourts and deter the future commission of grave \r\ncrimes, as well as prevent impunity. \r\n As the completion dates for the Tribunals draw \r\nnearer, I would like to focus on three specific issues, \r\nall of which are significant for the successful \r\ncompletion of the Tribunals’ work: continued efforts by \r\nthe Tribunals to implement their completion strategies; \r\nthe cooperation of Member States; and the agreement \r\nin the Security Council concerning residual issues. \r\n Both Tribunals are continuing the hard work to \r\ncomplete their mandates. The Yugoslavia Tribunal has \r\nconcluded proceedings against 120 of the 161 indicted \r\npersons. The Rwanda Tribunal has delivered judgements \r\nfor 45 of the accused at the first instance, and for 27 of \r\nthe accused at the appellate level. We commend both \r\nTribunals for their commitment to meeting the \r\ncompletion strategies, while ensuring that due process \r\nstandards and fundamental legal principles are fully \r\nrespected. We urge the Tribunals to continue their \r\nefforts in this regard. \r\n The Tribunals cannot successfully complete their \r\nmandates without the full cooperation of States. It is \r\ncrucial at this point that States give both Tribunals their \r\nunreserved support. All States must honour their \r\nobligations with regard to requests for full and \r\neffective assistance to the Tribunals. This applies with \r\nregard to witnesses, financial and material support and \r\npractical assistance in the enforcement of sentences. \r\nMoreover, the important responsibility for enforcing \r\nsentences must be shared by more States. We welcome \r\nthe conclusion of new agreements by the Yugoslavia \r\nTribunal, and look forward to additional agreements \r\nbeing concluded. \r\n The failure to arrest remaining fugitives \r\ncontinues to be of concern to us. It is not acceptable \r\nthat perpetrators of serious international crimes are \r\nevading legal proceedings. We therefore welcome the \r\narrest this week of Idelphonse Nizeyimana, one of the \r\nremaining accused by the Rwanda Tribunal, and his \r\nprompt transfer to Arusha from Uganda. This is an \r\nimportant step forward. We urge the continued \r\ncooperation and support of all Member States in order \r\nto fulfil their obligation to arrest and transfer fugitives \r\nto the Tribunals without delay. \r\n Lastly, I draw the Assembly’s attention to the \r\nissue pending in the Security Council, namely, how the \r\nresidual issues should be dealt with after completion of \r\nthe Tribunals. We have read with interest the report of \r\nthe Secretary-General (S/2009/258), dated 21 May \r\n2009. While we are fully aware of the ongoing \r\ndeliberations in the Council’s Informal Working Group \r\non International Tribunals, we urge the Council to \r\nconclude its work on these important issues as soon as \r\npossible. This will help to ensure a proper transition \r\nfrom two Tribunals to one or possibly two mechanisms \r\nthat can perform the necessary tasks after the closure \r\nof the Tribunals. \r\n One of the key outstanding issues concerns the \r\nlocation of such a mechanism or mechanisms. Norway \r\nwould support an approach which also fully \r\nincorporated the needs of other United Nations-assisted \r\ncourts. \r\n One should take full advantage of possible \r\nsynergies. As we all know, the International Criminal \r\nCourt is expected to move into its permanent premises \r\nin 2014. According to the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, the current relocation plans for the Court \r\ncould still be adapted to accommodate the needs of a \r\nresidual mechanism. Without prejudice to the outcome \r\nof the discussions in the Security Council, I suggest \r\nthat that is one of many issues that indicate the need \r\nfor expeditious action by the Council. \r\n Mr. Vilović (Croatia): I begin by welcoming \r\nPresident Robinson and President Byron and thanking \r\nthem for presenting the Tribunals’ respective reports.  \r\n Croatia continues to support the Tribunals’ efforts \r\nto ensure early and orderly completion of their work. \r\nWe recognize that they have entered a critical period in \r\nA/64/PV.16  \r\n \r\n09-54853 12 \r\n \r\nwhich it will be necessary to begin to downsize while \r\ncontinuing to work on remaining cases and \r\ntransitioning towards an appropriate infrastructure that \r\nwill take up their residual issues in the future. \r\n Allow me to make a few remarks regarding the \r\nactivities of the International Criminal Tribunal for the \r\nFormer Yugoslavia (ICTY) over the past year, given \r\nthe importance that my country attaches to its work.  \r\n For Croatia it remains imperative that the \r\ntransition towards the Tribunal’s closure leave no \r\nimpunity gaps. Notwithstanding the impressive trial \r\nfigures quoted in the report by President Robinson, the \r\nmandate of the ICTY cannot be declared completed \r\nwithout bringing to justice two remaining fugitives — \r\nRatko Mladić and Goran Hadžić — who bear \r\nresponsibility for some of the gravest crimes \r\ncommitted in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Croatia: \r\nthe massacres in Srebrenica and Vukovar. The arrest \r\nand trial of high-level fugitives must be a priority, not \r\njust for the Tribunals, but for the international \r\ncommunity. We therefore welcome the recent arrest of \r\nhigh-level fugitives indicted by the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), and hope to see \r\nan early beginning of their respective trials.  \r\n More than a year ago another high-profile \r\nfugitive, Radovan Karadžić, was arrested. We regret to \r\nnote that his case is still in the pretrial phase, despite \r\nthe fact that more than a dozen years have passed since \r\nhis indictment.  \r\n We take note of the anticipated dates for the \r\nclosure of the Tribunals, which will slip well into the \r\nnext decade. While we share concerns expressed about \r\nlengthy trials, we also recognize the need to be \r\nrealistic. The early closure of the two Tribunals is a \r\nlegitimate objective, but not at the expense of the fair \r\ntrial guarantees.  \r\n Croatia welcomes steps that the Tribunals are \r\ntaking towards redeploying resources and personnel in \r\norder to better respond to new circumstances after \r\n2010, when an influx of appeals is expected. We are \r\nalso aware of the problem of the attrition of personnel, \r\nas highlighted by Presidents Byron and Robinson. In \r\norder to bring their mandate to an orderly closure, the \r\nTribunals have to have sufficient capacity and \r\nresources. \r\n We are cognizant that justice, and in particular \r\ninternational justice, is costly, complex and, sometimes, \r\nslow. While the Tribunals’ mandates are slowly coming \r\nto a close, the trials before national courts will \r\ncontinue. It is the courts of our region that will \r\ncontinue the work started by the ICTY. The Croatian \r\njudiciary has clearly demonstrated its ability to conduct \r\ntrials of even the most sensitive cases, including the \r\none case that was transferred to it by the ICTY.  \r\n As the processing of war crimes is likely to \r\ncontinue in the foreseeable future, Croatia has a special \r\ninterest in finding sustainable, just and practical \r\nsolutions for discharging the Tribunals’ residual \r\nfunctions, notably those related to the future of the \r\nTribunals’ archives, liaising with the Prosecutor’s \r\nOffice, and the modalities of serving the sentences.  \r\n Croatia will continue to insist on, and fully \r\nsupport, the fulfilment of the mandate of the ICTY, \r\nrecognizing it as a key force in a process of restoring \r\nthe victims by providing justice, which in turn paves \r\nthe way for a better future, a future of peace, security, \r\ncooperation and prosperity, for the whole region.  \r\n We are glad that the present report has confirmed \r\nCroatia’s overall good cooperation with the ICTY. \r\nCroatia’s commitment to full, open and unequivocal \r\ncooperation with the Tribunal is unwavering, including \r\nin the Gotovina et al. case, as demonstrated by the \r\nclose and intense working relationship developed \r\nbetween the Office of the Prosecutor and the Croatian \r\nGovernment on all levels. In the case that I have just \r\nmentioned, the Croatian authorities have continued to \r\ntake concrete administrative, investigative and judicial \r\nmeasures, in close consultation with the Prosecutor, in \r\norder to meet to the maximum extent possible the \r\nOffice of the Prosecutor’s requests regarding missing \r\ndocuments. We believe that recent steps, in conjunction \r\nwith the earlier measures undertaken as part of an \r\nadministrative investigation, and the ensuing criminal \r\nproceedings, will prove once again that the cooperation \r\nwith the Office of the Prosecutor is full and open. \r\n The crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia \r\nand Rwanda over the past decade continue to haunt our \r\ncollective conscience. The two Tribunals have already \r\nmade a profound impact through the process of \r\nindividualizing guilt for crimes committed and \r\nbuilding a body of law as their lasting legacy to the \r\nregions affected and to the world, not least as a \r\nprecursor to the establishment of the International \r\nCriminal Court. \r\n A/64/PV.16\r\n \r\n13 09-54853 \r\n \r\n The Tribunals’ success and their legacy will be \r\njudged by their credibility. That is why it is essential \r\nthat there be no closure without a credible strategy \r\nwhich will ensure that impunity cannot outlast justice. \r\nThe Tribunals’ mandates should not be terminated \r\nbefore putting in place appropriate structures for \r\nmanaging residual issues, including trials of the \r\nremaining high-profile fugitives. Croatia will continue \r\nto work with others to that end. \r\n Mr. Muita (Kenya): My delegation congratulates \r\nyou, Sir, on your election to preside over the \r\nAssembly’s deliberations, and also congratulates the \r\nother members of your Bureau. We assure you of our \r\nfull commitment and support as you discharge the task \r\nbefore you. \r\n I begin by thanking the President of the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), \r\nJudge Dennis Byron, and the President of the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former \r\nYugoslavia, Judge Patrick Robinson, for their \r\ncomprehensive annual reports submitted to the \r\nAssembly in conformity with the respective Statutes \r\nestablishing the Tribunals. \r\n Kenya notes the numerous challenges facing both \r\nTribunals, which include unprecedented judicial \r\nworkloads during their winding-up phase. We are, \r\nhowever, encouraged that, due to exceptional leadership, \r\ncommendable progress has been made towards \r\nachievement of their respective completion strategies. \r\nIn that regard, my delegation welcomes the measures \r\ntaken by both Tribunals, including amending their rules \r\nof procedure, with a view to expediting the delivery of \r\njustice. That is a positive step towards reducing the \r\npending workload. \r\n Enforcement of sentences by the ICTR is a matter \r\nof concern. In this respect, my delegation is pleased \r\nthat some countries have agreed to host persons \r\nconvicted by the Tribunal for purposes of serving their \r\nsentences. Kenya believes this support and assistance \r\nhelps ease congestion in the Tribunal’s detention \r\nfacilities, and is critical to the proper discharge of its \r\nfunctions. We continue to urge Member States to give \r\nenhanced cooperation, and in this connection welcome \r\nthe positive development noted in paragraph 54 of the \r\nreport, where we learn that during the reporting period \r\nthe ICTR continued to receive a number  \r\n“of requests for mutual legal assistance from \r\nnational jurisdictions conducting investigations, \r\nwith a view to the prosecution or extradition of \r\nRwandan fugitives appearing on the INTERPOL \r\nwanted list”. \r\n Kenya will consistently continue to support the \r\ninternational criminal justice system. Through the \r\nrelevant Government departments and agencies, my \r\ncountry has been working closely with both the ICTR \r\nand the International Criminal Court in all areas. \r\n I am happy to inform the Assembly that on \r\n30 September Kenya signed an extradition treaty with \r\nRwanda. That is a positive development as the ICTR \r\ndraws closer to completion of its mandate, because it \r\nwill facilitate further cooperation between the two \r\ncountries during the Tribunal’s post-closure period. \r\n My country believes that both Tribunals have \r\ncontributed immensely to the development of \r\ninternational criminal law. Their jurisprudence provides \r\nuseful reference material for various stakeholders.  \r\n My delegation encourages the efforts to promote \r\ndissemination of information on the activities of the \r\nTribunals. The issue of providing safe custody of the \r\nrecords and material emanating from both institutions \r\nis a challenge that needs to be resolved. The \r\nGovernment of Kenya is looking very favourably into \r\nthis question with respect to the ICTR. \r\n The official visits to both Tribunals by high-\r\nranking officials from Governments and other \r\norganizations, in our view, reflect the recognition \r\nconferred on the Tribunals. We also believe that they \r\nplay an important role in enhancing the image of both \r\ninstitutions as central organs for international dispute-\r\nresolution. We encourage such visits as part of the \r\nawareness programmes, and appreciate the measures \r\nput in place to educate officials from Member States. \r\n Kenya supports the case put forward by the \r\nPresident of the International Criminal Tribunal for \r\nRwanda on behalf of the ad litem judges, who \r\ndischarge the same functions as the permanent judges \r\nof the Tribunals. We urge the Assembly to resolve the \r\nmatter. \r\n Finally, my delegation appreciates support for \r\ntraining provided by the EU to both Tribunals. We are \r\nconvinced the training will promote understanding of \r\ninternational criminal law and the need to prevent \r\nfuture occurrences of the heinous crime of genocide. \r\nWe urge the EU and other development partners to \r\nA/64/PV.16  \r\n \r\n09-54853 14 \r\n \r\nconsider extending the training programmes to wider \r\nregions. \r\n I once again reaffirm my country’s commitment \r\nto the ideals and principles of the international criminal \r\njustice system.  \r\n Mr. Gasana (Rwanda): My delegation thanks the \r\nPresident of the International Criminal Tribunal for \r\nRwanda (ICTR) for the presentation of his report to the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n The Government of the Republic of Rwanda \r\nappreciates the contribution of the international \r\ncommunity to justice and reconciliation in Rwanda in \r\nthe aftermath of the 1994 genocide, and recognizes the \r\ncontribution the ICTR has rendered to this end. I also \r\ntake this opportunity to commend the authorities of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, the Government of \r\nUganda and INTERPOL for their concerted efforts in \r\narresting genocide fugitives Grégoire Ndahimana and \r\nIdelphonse Nizeyimana, both of whom are now in \r\nArusha, Tanzania, awaiting justice. \r\n My delegation is of the firm view that the best \r\nway to give the strongest impetus to justice and \r\nreconciliation in Rwanda would be by justice being \r\ndone, and being seen to be done, where the crimes took \r\nplace. Rwanda on its part has done everything within \r\nits modest means to provide justice to its people, \r\nthrough a combination of traditional and more formal \r\nsystems of justice. It is for that reason that my \r\nGovernment insists that no residual mechanism of the \r\nICTR should have a trial capacity after 2010.  \r\n All cases for which trial has not begun by the end \r\nof 2010 must be transferred to the national courts of a \r\nState in whose territory the crime was committed or in \r\nwhich the accused was arrested, or to any other State \r\nwilling and able to accept them. That is the only way \r\nfor the international community to ensure that the \r\nglobal fight against impunity for the remaining \r\nfugitives is carried on while achieving the stated \r\nobjective of putting an end to the work of the ICTR. \r\n Rwanda has long called for the transfer of \r\naccused in the custody of the ICTR for trial before our \r\ndomestic courts. Public administration of justice in \r\nRwanda is clearly preferable to any form of justice \r\noutside Rwanda, either in third-party States on the \r\nbasis of universal jurisdiction or before an international \r\ntribunal. The international community has a singular \r\nopportunity to achieve this through adequate joint \r\nefforts of the ICTR and the Government of Rwanda to \r\nensure that the requirements for transfer are satisfied. \r\n Recent suggestions by the ICTR that domestic \r\njustice in Rwanda is somewhat below standard are \r\nunacceptable. The Government of Rwanda has \r\nundertaken wide-ranging reforms of legal instruments \r\nto accommodate and clarify aspects of the law that \r\nwere hindering the transfer of cases to Rwanda. \r\nWhereas the Tribunal’s Office of the Prosecutor has \r\nbeen transferring files of unindicted suspects to the \r\nRwandan Public Prosecution Authority, recent requests \r\nby the ICTR Prosecutor to transfer outstanding cases \r\ninvolving lower-rank accused to Rwanda were denied \r\nby the Trial Chambers. Those decisions are not \r\nencouraging for our future collaboration and \r\ncooperation. \r\n We look forward to the ICTR reviewing its \r\nrulings that resulted in preventing domestic courts in \r\nother countries from extraditing fugitives to Rwanda \r\nfor trial. From experience, it is noticeable that the \r\nusefulness of international prosecutions is limited. The \r\nICTR has prosecuted a handful of cases, and, with the \r\nexception of the few cases in Belgium, Switzerland, \r\nthe Netherlands, Canada and Finland, there is a total \r\nlack of interest and enthusiasm in prosecuting \r\nRwandan genocide suspects abroad. Those countries \r\nthat have the appropriate laws perhaps lack the \r\nresources, but mostly lack the political will to do so. \r\n As I have mentioned, Rwanda has over the years \r\nmodernized its domestic justice system, modelled on \r\ninternational standards, including prison conditions, \r\ntraining of judicial personnel and promoting judicial \r\nindependence and impartiality. Because the Tribunal \r\nwas never meant to provide justice for the masses, \r\ngenocide justice has been essentially a domestic \r\nprocess. \r\n Rwanda is of the view that the ICTR residual \r\nmechanism must be entrusted with unfinished or \r\nongoing business that relates back to proceedings \r\nalready conducted or ongoing at the cut-off date of \r\n31 December 2010, bearing in mind that, for consistency \r\nand fairness, no new trials should commence past the \r\nfirst quarter of 2010. \r\n All other matters must be transferred to national \r\nsystems. Hence, should the defence of an accused \r\ntransferred within a national system seek access to \r\nrecords in a previous case which are material to its \r\ncase, and, of course, which are not available to the \r\n A/64/PV.16\r\n \r\n15 09-54853 \r\n \r\npublic, the residual mechanism would be competent to \r\nhandle the request. \r\n The same goes for variations of protective \r\nmeasures and so on. It should be borne in mind that \r\njust because some cases have been conducted before \r\nthe ICTR that does not create a requirement that the \r\naccused in other cases must have access to ICTR \r\narchives for them to have a fair trial. Those that have \r\nbeen tried before our domestic courts did not have such \r\naccess, nor was it necessary or required.  \r\n The Government of Rwanda has also expressed \r\nits preference that those convicted by the ICTR should \r\nserve their sentences in Rwanda, a call which thus far \r\nhas gone unheeded, despite our willingness and efforts \r\nto meet all the conditions required for Rwanda to \r\naccommodate ICTR convicts, in accordance with \r\ninternational standards. Rwanda, with the support of \r\nmembers of the international community, has invested \r\nresources in the legal, physical, professional and \r\nlogistical infrastructures to meet the requirements of \r\ninternational judicial standards. \r\n Rwanda maintains that if the work of the ICTR is \r\nto have any significance for Rwandans, at least some \r\nof the convicts ought to serve their sentences in the \r\ncountry where the crimes were perpetrated. That could \r\ngo a long way to demonstrate the importance of \r\ninternational accountability in a manner that most \r\nRwandans can understand and relate to. \r\n In conclusion, on behalf of my Government, I \r\ncommend the representative of Sweden, who said, \r\nspeaking on behalf of the EU, “We note with \r\nappreciation the efforts made by Rwanda to meet the \r\ndemands regarding the right to a fair trial.” \r\n Mr. Hoxha (Albania): First, I join other \r\ndelegations in expressing our appreciation for the work \r\nof the International Criminal Tribunals for the Former \r\nYugoslavia and for Rwanda, and their respective \r\nPresidents Judge Patrick L. Robinson and Judge \r\nCharles Michael Dennis Byron. We all agree that their \r\nwork throughout the years has been and remains of \r\nvital importance in creating a legacy for the future of \r\ninternational criminal justice and international law as a \r\nwhole. \r\n My delegation aligned itself with the statement \r\ndelivered by the representative of Sweden on behalf of \r\nthe European Union. In addition, in my national \r\ncapacity, I would like to emphasize the following. \r\n Albania strongly supports all efforts to strengthen \r\ninternational criminal justice. We must ensure that \r\nthose responsible for serious crimes are held \r\naccountable and brought to justice. In this regard, we \r\ncommend the International Criminal Tribunal for the \r\nFormer Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda for their irreplaceable \r\nrole in combating impunity in fulfilment of their \r\nmandates and at the same time establishing standards \r\nfor global justice in the interest of peace and security. \r\n Albania supports the efforts of the Tribunals to \r\ncomplete their work at the earliest date and accomplish \r\nthe completion strategy pursuant to Security Council \r\nresolutions 1503 (2003) and 1534 (2004) by adopting \r\nconcrete measures to enhance the efficiency of the \r\nproceedings. The courts must have full support from \r\nthe Security Council and the international community \r\nin order to maintain high dedication and efficiency in \r\nprosecuting and bringing to justice the remaining \r\nfugitives.  \r\n On the other hand, we also consider the referral \r\nof cases to competent national jurisdictions an essential \r\npart of the completion strategy. In this regard, we \r\nwelcome the improvements of domestic judicial \r\ninstitutions in conducting fair trials for all lower and \r\nmid-level accused in the respective regions. We take \r\nnote of the efforts made by Rwanda in order to meet all \r\nthe benchmarks for fair trials. \r\n Albania has signed an agreement with the ICTY \r\nand offered its prison facilities for the sentenced \r\npersons to serve their prison terms in Albania as a \r\nconcrete measure of support for the ICTY. \r\n Albania considers that the arrest of the remaining \r\nfugitives — Ratko Mladić and Goran Hadžić as well as \r\nFélicien Kabuga — should remain a top priority for the \r\nsuccessful accomplishment of the Tribunals’ work. We \r\ncall on the States in the region, especially those where \r\nfugitives are suspected to be at large, to fully cooperate \r\nwith and render all necessary support to the Tribunals. \r\nThe arrest of the fugitives will mark the ending of a \r\ntragic period in the history of the Balkan region and the \r\nregion concerned in Africa, and at the same time pave \r\nthe way for long-term reconciliation. We owe this to \r\nthe victims and their families, and we owe it to \r\nourselves, as there can be no peace and prosperity \r\nwithout a resolute fulfilment of justice. \r\n My delegation also wishes to echo the particular \r\nconcern of President Robinson regarding compensation \r\nA/64/PV.16  \r\n \r\n09-54853 16 \r\n \r\nof the victims. We fully subscribe to his concern and \r\nremarks, and believe that the matter needs to be \r\nproperly addressed as an important part of making \r\njustice. \r\n Mr. Kuzmin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): First, I express my gratitude to the Presidents \r\nof the Tribunals for their reports. \r\n The Tribunals set up by the Security Council \r\nmore than 15 years ago, as temporary courts, \r\nundoubtedly have done considerable work in order to \r\nbring to justice those persons guilty of international \r\ncrimes on the territories of the former Yugoslavia and \r\nRwanda. The history of their creation shows that the \r\nSecurity Council considered their function in a broader \r\ncontext, as one of the measures designed to maintain \r\ninternational peace and security, and for post-conflict \r\nsettlement in the regions. By its very nature, the \r\ninternational, ad hoc tribunal cannot and should not \r\nendlessly take the place of the existing courts and \r\ntribunals of individual countries.  \r\n The position of principle of the Russian \r\nFederation is that the Tribunals should keep within the \r\ntime limit for a completion strategy. Both should be \r\nguided by the time frames laid down by the Security \r\nCouncil and do everything possible to ensure that their \r\nsubstantive work is concluded by the end of 2010.  \r\n Unfortunately, the language of both reports \r\nsuggests that the Tribunals, for various reasons, offer \r\ndiscouraging prospects of their observing those time \r\nframes. Security Council resolutions 1877 (2009) and \r\n1878 (2009) once again extended the functions of the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former \r\nYugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Criminal \r\nTribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), this time until \r\n31 December 2010. We stress the exceptional nature of \r\nthose measures, which were made necessary by the \r\nneed to bring cases already under way to their logical \r\nconclusion. \r\n We welcome the Tribunals’ efforts to locate \r\nfugitives from justice. In this context, we note the \r\nsuccess of the Rwanda Tribunal, which, together with \r\nINTERPOL and the law enforcement agencies of \r\nvarious States, has succeeded in arresting two suspects \r\nover the last few months. We share the concern of the \r\ninternational community that two suspects in the ICTY \r\ndossier still remain at large, as well as eleven suspects \r\nof the ICTR. \r\n However, the real difficulties in finding and \r\narresting fugitives should not be used to drag out the \r\nTribunals’ work for an indefinite period. Completion of \r\ntheir work is closely connected with the transfer of \r\ncases to national jurisdictions, which is the thrust of \r\nSecurity Council resolutions 1503 (2003) and 1534 \r\n(2004). Unfortunately, the Tribunals approach the \r\nmatter with caution, the grounds for which are not \r\nalways solid. We call on them to activate their \r\nmechanisms for bringing national courts into taking \r\nover outstanding cases.  \r\n In this context, we note the work done by the \r\nTribunals to develop the potential to transfer to local \r\ncourts their accumulated experience and carry out legal \r\nresearch which will make it possible to adapt \r\ninternational precedents to national criminal court \r\nprocedures. We would also encourage the efforts of the \r\nTribunals to accelerate the tempo of the judicial \r\nprocesses and to attempt to rationalize the work of \r\ncourts for parallel consideration of a number of cases. \r\n This year the General Assembly and the Fifth \r\nCommittee will have to discuss and adopt draft \r\nresolutions on the budget for the Tribunals for the next \r\ntwo-year period. We believe that during a universal \r\nfinancial crisis the Tribunals’ attention should be drawn \r\nto the need to stay within the indicated budgetary \r\nlimits, and to take into account in forthcoming \r\nexpenditure the need to preserve their heritage, \r\nparticularly their archives, and transform themselves \r\ninto mechanisms of their own residual competence. \r\n Mr. Mahiga (United Republic of Tanzania): At \r\nthe outset, I thank both Judge Charles Michael Dennis \r\nByron, President of the International Criminal Tribunal \r\nfor Rwanda (ICTR) and Judge Patrick Lipton \r\nRobinson, President of the International Criminal \r\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), for \r\npresenting their annual reports to the General \r\nAssembly. Tanzania appreciates their ability to lead the \r\nTribunals and ensure that the purposes for which they \r\nwere established are fully met.  \r\n Furthermore, we commend the Presidents’ efforts \r\nin implementing the completion strategies for both \r\nTribunals, and express our strong support for their \r\nimportant work in ending impunity in Africa and the \r\nworld over. The ICTR and the ICTY have \r\ndemonstrated their significant role in fighting impunity \r\nand promoting the rule of law. They have further \r\nshown that genocide, crimes against humanity, war \r\n A/64/PV.16\r\n \r\n17 09-54853 \r\n \r\ncrimes and other crimes under international law cannot \r\nbe tolerated, and that perpetrators of such atrocities \r\nmust face retribution. \r\n As the host State of the International Criminal \r\nTribunal for Rwanda, Tanzania has continued to \r\nperform its inherent obligation in ensuring the smooth \r\nrunning of the Tribunal’s activities. That support has \r\ntaken the form of making logistical arrangements, \r\nissuing visas and permits, processing applicable tax \r\nexemptions and ensuring the security of both the \r\npremises of the court and its staff.  \r\n We extend our condolences over one of the \r\njudges who met his death in Tanzania. Investigations \r\nwere properly carried out, and the results were shared \r\nwith the United Nations and his home country. \r\n Tanzania reaffirms its commitment to continuing \r\nto discharge its duties as the host State of the Tribunal \r\nuntil the completion of its work in the remaining few \r\nyears. \r\n Having thoroughly gone through the reports of \r\nthe two courts, we have noted with appreciation the \r\nachievements so far in ensuring that the purposes of \r\ntheir establishment are fully met. Tanzania appreciates \r\nthe difficulties of the two Tribunals, as reflected in the \r\nreports before us, and we are prepared to continue \r\ncooperating with the ICTR to overcome any \r\ninconvenience or difficulties that may persist. \r\n As we are all aware, the smooth running of the \r\ncourt, and thus delivering justice to both the acquitted \r\nand the convicted, largely depends on the mutual \r\ncooperation and assistance of Member States. Tanzania \r\nhas noted with concern the hurdles which the court \r\nfaces with regard to the relocation of acquitted persons \r\nto third States and of convicted persons to serve their \r\nsentences. Since the court is one of our own creations, \r\nand since it is our desire and common goal to ensure \r\nthat the ends of justice are met, we call on all Member \r\nStates to cooperate with it by accepting convicted \r\npersons to serve their sentences in States’ detention \r\nfacilities, as part of international responsibility-\r\nsharing. \r\n We note with concern that there remain at large in \r\nour region a number of fugitives who are still to face \r\njustice for crimes alleged to have been committed in \r\nRwanda. We call on the Member States in our region \r\non whose territory those fugitives have been located to \r\ncooperate with the court by assisting in their arrest and \r\ntransfer as soon as possible to face justice at the ICTR \r\nin Arusha. We commend the efforts and initiatives, \r\nprompted by the Democratic Republic of the Congo \r\nand Uganda, to arrest and transfer the fugitives who \r\nwere apprehended in those countries two weeks ago, \r\nand who are already in Arusha facing justice before the \r\nICTR. \r\n As the Tribunal is now implementing its \r\ncompletion strategy, the issue of maintaining its \r\narchives and the residual function are of the utmost \r\nimportance. Tanzania is willing and ready to continue \r\nhosting the Tribunal’s archives with the same \r\ndedication and commitment as we did throughout the \r\noperation of the court from its inception more than 10 \r\nyears ago. We strongly believe that the infrastructure \r\nalready in place makes Arusha an ideal location to keep \r\nthe records of the court as an important historical \r\nlearning institution for the benefit of future generations \r\nin the subregion and the African continent as a whole. \r\nAlready the court archives have been made available to \r\nmany universities in our region, and they are an \r\nintegral part of capacity-building and the training of \r\nfuture generations of lawyers in our region. \r\n Tanzania has been designated by the African \r\nUnion as the seat of the African Court on Human and \r\nPeoples’ Rights. The cases to be handled by that Court \r\nwill benefit immeasurably from the precedents of cases \r\nand judgements handled and rendered by the ICTR in \r\nArusha. \r\n We are following with interest the deliberations \r\nof the Security Council’s Informal Working Group on \r\nInternational Tribunals, chaired by Austria, with regard \r\nto the Tribunals’ residual mechanisms. We trust that \r\nconsideration will be given to preservation of the \r\narchives, and access to them, in order to support \r\nsuccessful mechanisms, such as the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC). The experience of the African \r\nTribunal, preserved in the archives in Arusha, \r\nTanzania, would offer ready-made facilities to support \r\nthe ICC, should that be one of the recommendations of \r\nthe Informal Working Group. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): May I take it \r\nthat the Assembly wishes to conclude its consideration \r\nof agenda items 73 and 74? \r\n It was so decided. \r\nThe meeting rose at 12.10 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
