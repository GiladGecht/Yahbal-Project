(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.30 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nPlane crash in Haiti \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): Before \r\nproceeding to consider the item on the agenda for this \r\nmorning, I wish to convey, on behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, our deepest sympathy and condolences to \r\nthe Governments of Uruguay and Jordan and to the \r\nfamilies of the 11 United Nations staff members who \r\nwhere killed in Haiti in a plane crash on Friday, \r\n9 October 2009. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 48 \r\n \r\nIntegrated and coordinated implementation of and \r\nfollow-up to the outcomes of the major United \r\nNations conferences and summits in the economic, \r\nsocial and related fields \r\n \r\n  Commemoration of the fifteenth anniversary of \r\nthe International Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): In accordance \r\nwith resolution 63/9, of 3 November 2008, the General \r\nAssembly will now devote one day of plenary meetings \r\nto the commemoration of the fifteenth anniversary of \r\nthe International Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment. \r\n Before we proceed, I should like to remind \r\nmembers that, in a letter dated 6 October 2009 \r\naddressed to all Permanent Representatives and \r\nObservers, I indicated my intention to invite \r\nMs. Thoraya Obaid, Executive Director of the United \r\nNations Population Fund, to make a statement this \r\nmorning following the intervention by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. May I take it that it is the wish of the General \r\nAssembly to invite Ms. Obaid to make such a \r\nstatement? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\ncommemoration of the fifteenth anniversary of the \r\nInternational Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment is an important opportunity to mark the \r\nprogress that has been made over the years and to take \r\nnote of the challenges that remain in meeting the \r\nobjectives set out in Cairo.  \r\n The Cairo Conference was part of a series of \r\ndevelopment conferences held by the United Nations in \r\nthe 1990s. As the Assembly may recall, those \r\nconferences covered a wide range of themes — from \r\nprotecting the environment to promoting human rights \r\nand from social development to human settlements and \r\nadvancing the status of women. All of those \r\nconferences contributed to the Millennium Summit and \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which \r\nprovide a unifying framework for international \r\ndevelopment. They are inscribed on an international \r\nagenda that is based on common goals that continue to \r\nguide our efforts today. \r\n In fact, we are talking about a process that goes \r\nback at least 40 years, when the United Nations \r\nPopulation Fund was established. During the past four \r\ndecades, we have learned that every society’s hopes \r\nA/64/PV.17  \r\n \r\n09-55404 2 \r\n \r\nand prospects for peace, prosperity and social and \r\neconomic development are closely tied to its \r\ndemography. It is evident that if States are to provide \r\nadequately for their citizens, they need to incorporate \r\npopulation analysis and policies into their development \r\nstrategies. \r\n We also understand better that there is a limit to \r\nthe pressures that our global environment can \r\nwithstand. It is clear from the climate change crisis that \r\nwe must tackle unsustainable patterns of production \r\nand consumption. Rising carbon emissions, \r\ndeforestation and water shortages point to the need to \r\nbring people and the environment into greater balance \r\nand harmony. Urgent and collective action is required \r\nto protect the natural resources on which all life \r\ndepends. We also need to ensure that the benefits of \r\nglobalization are equally shared by all. And we have to \r\nurgently cope with the wide-ranging consequences of \r\nthe world financial and economic crisis, especially its \r\nimpact on global poverty, which is on the rise, and \r\ndevelopment objectives, which have been set back.   \r\n The consensus reached in Cairo 15 years ago \r\ncontinues to guide us on the way ahead with regard to \r\nthe interlinked issues of population, economic growth \r\nand sustainable development. It includes \r\nrecommendations related to child survival, women’s \r\nhealth and safe motherhood. It makes a strong case for \r\nreproductive health and rights, gender equality and the \r\nempowerment of women. \r\n Better understanding of those issues has brought \r\nabout real change in the daily lives of millions of \r\nwomen, men and young people. They now have greater \r\nchoices and can make informed decisions on \r\nfundamental aspects of their lives. Today, more girls \r\nare going to school. More infants are surviving. More \r\npeople are living free of HIV and AIDS. All that is \r\ngood news for which every nation in the world can be \r\nproud of and can take some credit. That progress has \r\nbeen achieved by enhancing knowledge and individual \r\nopportunity and by broadening choices. We should \r\nmaintain that spirit of international consensus and \r\ncooperation.  \r\n I would like to pay tribute to the United Nations \r\nPopulation Fund, which has supported countries in \r\ncarrying the Cairo agreement forward. I would also \r\nlike to pay tribute to civil society for its contribution to \r\nthis collective effort. \r\n As we look ahead, we must ensure that the vision \r\nand goals of Cairo are an integral part of the 15-year \r\nreview of the Beijing Platform for Action and the \r\n10-year review of the MDGs to be carried out by the \r\nGeneral Assembly next year.  \r\n In the end, the overarching goal is to create \r\ngreater balance between population and development \r\nand to improve the lives of current and future \r\ngenerations. Let us today renew and strengthen our \r\ncommitment to the vision and holistic nature of the \r\nCairo agreement. Let us also commit ourselves to \r\nstronger action to implement in full the Programme of \r\nAction of the International Conference on Population \r\nand Development. \r\n I now give the floor to the Secretary-General. \r\n The Secretary-General: We are here today to \r\ncommemorate a watershed event. The 1994 Cairo \r\nConference marked a major shift in the international \r\nmindset on population issues. Countries from around \r\nthe world affirmed that population, far from being \r\nabout numbers, is about people, and that women’s \r\nhealth, education, employment and empowerment were \r\nthe keys to a sustainable future. \r\n The Cairo Conference grappled with some of the \r\nmost sensitive issues of our day and achieved a \r\nconsensus. Nearly 180 Governments agreed to put \r\ngender equality, reproductive health and reproductive \r\nrights at the centre of development. They \r\nacknowledged the importance of universal education, \r\nespecially for girls. They recognized the need to \r\nprevent the unnecessary deaths of infants, children and \r\nmothers, and they stressed the need to make sure that \r\nall people who want reproductive health care can get it. \r\nParticipants also agreed that women and girls will \r\nnever be empowered unless we eliminate violence \r\nagainst them and ensure that they can control their own \r\nfertility. \r\n The Conference was a shining example of what \r\nthe United Nations does like no other organization in \r\nthe world — act as a pioneer in addressing global \r\nchallenges and bring Governments together to set \r\ninternational goals that go further than many countries \r\nwould on their own. \r\n Fifteen years ago in Cairo, for the first time, \r\nGovernments acknowledged that every person has the \r\nright to sexual and reproductive health. Today, we meet \r\nto hail the progress that has been achieved, to \r\n A/64/PV.17\r\n \r\n3 09-55404 \r\n \r\nacknowledge the many problems that remain, and to \r\nstrengthen our resolve to overcome them.  \r\n Fifteen years ago, fewer than half of all women \r\nused modern contraception. Today, more women and \r\ncouples — 56 per cent, up from 47 per cent — can \r\nchoose if or when they want to have children, and how \r\nmany. Fifteen years ago, 71 out of every 1,000 babies \r\ndied during their first year of life. Today, that number \r\nhas been cut to 51 per 1,000. Fifteen years ago, fewer \r\nthan half of all women giving birth in developing \r\ncountries had skilled health personnel to help them. \r\nNow, more than 60 per cent receive this lifesaving \r\nassistance. \r\n The international community has worked hard for \r\nthis progress. I especially wish to pay tribute to the \r\nUnited Nations Population Fund for its tireless \r\nadvocacy and invaluable activities.  \r\n But as we all know, despite these efforts, the \r\nCairo consensus remains more a goal than a reality for \r\nfar too many people. Some 200 million women still do \r\nnot have access to safe and effective contraception. Too \r\nmany women resort to abortions that are not safe \r\nbecause they lack access to family planning. In too \r\nmany countries, girls are still married off as child \r\nbrides. The dangerous practice of genital mutilation \r\nand other harmful traditions continue to have a terrible \r\nimpact. Sexual violence, especially during conflict, \r\ncontinues to victimize women on a mass scale. And the \r\nnumber of deaths from childbirth — a staggering toll \r\nof more than half a million women each year — has \r\nnot changed since the Cairo Conference. \r\n We have a clear plan to address these problems: \r\nthe Programme of Action of the International \r\nConference on Population and Development. The \r\nProgramme is critical to achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. It is especially important for Goal \r\n5, which is to cut maternal mortality and achieve \r\nuniversal access to reproductive health care. Progress \r\non reaching that target has been slower than on any \r\nother. Maternal health is linked directly to a country’s \r\nhealth system. When we improve maternal health, all \r\npeople will benefit. \r\n To fully carry out the Cairo Programme of Action \r\nmeans providing women with reproductive health \r\nservices, including family planning. It means backing \r\npoverty-eradication initiatives, and it means preventing \r\nrape during wartime and ending the culture of \r\nimpunity. All of these actions require funding. \r\n This may be a time of global financial turmoil \r\nand economic downturn, but it is not a time to renege \r\non our promises to protect and invest in women — for \r\ntheir sake and for the sake of our collective future. I \r\nam personally committed to doing everything possible \r\nto empower women here at the United Nations and \r\naround the world. I call on all development partners to \r\njoin me in recommitting to the Cairo Programme of \r\nAction until all of its promises are fulfilled. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his statement.  \r\n May I take it that the General Assembly wishes to \r\nclose the list of speakers on this item now? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): In accordance \r\nwith the decision made earlier and without setting a \r\nprecedent, I now give the floor to the Executive \r\nDirector of the United Nations Population Fund.  \r\n Ms. Obaid (United Nations Population Fund): I \r\nwould like to thank you, Sir, for your opening remarks \r\nand for giving me the opportunity to address the \r\nAssembly at this special commemoration. I would also \r\nlike to thank the Secretary-General for his unwavering \r\nsupport for the Programme of Action of the \r\nInternational Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment (ICPD). \r\n Fifteen years ago, at the International Conference \r\non Population and Development in Cairo, \r\n179 Governments ignited a spark of change that \r\ncontinues to improve the lives of people. The \r\nProgramme of Action puts people at the centre of \r\ndevelopment. It calls for the collection and analysis of \r\npopulation data to guide equitable policy decisions. It \r\npositions reproductive health, including family \r\nplanning, healthy relationships and the well-being of \r\nindividuals, as a right. It makes it clear that when \r\nwomen are empowered and supported in determining \r\nthe number and spacing of their children — a decision \r\nthat is seemingly simple yet so complex — they \r\nimprove their own lives and the well-being of their \r\nfamilies, communities and countries. \r\n The right to sexual and reproductive health and \r\nwomen’s empowerment are core to the linkages \r\nbetween population and development. Reproductive \r\nchoices are central to gender equality and can influence \r\npopulation dynamics. The Cairo agenda addresses the \r\nneeds and rights of all people, irrespective of their \r\nA/64/PV.17  \r\n \r\n09-55404 4 \r\n \r\nsituations, including migrants, refugees and displaced \r\npersons, and it makes a connection between \r\npopulation, the environment and peace, security and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n The holistic Cairo consensus remains practical \r\nand pertinent as we confront today’s daunting \r\nchallenges. Today, I pay tribute to Governments and \r\ncivil society for their accomplishments since the 1994 \r\nInternational Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment, and I call on the private sector to be \r\nmore responsive.  \r\n I pay tribute to Ms. Nafis Sadik, former \r\nExecutive Director of the United Nations Population \r\nFund (UNFPA), who was the Secretary-General of the \r\nCairo Conference. She has devoted her professional \r\nlife to promoting the right of women to make decisions \r\nabout their own lives. And I salute the dedicated staff \r\nof UNFPA for their commitment to working with \r\nGovernments, civil society and communities in order to \r\nimplement the Programme of Action, often under \r\nchallenging circumstances. \r\n During the past 15 years, we have learned a great \r\ndeal in carrying the Cairo consensus forward, and I \r\nwould like to share with the Assembly five lessons \r\nlearned that point the way forward. \r\n First, we know that the aspirations expressed in \r\nthe Cairo consensus are taking root at the local level. \r\nAlthough the debate on sexual and reproductive health \r\nis not always easy, dialogue is expanding and concrete \r\nprogress is being made. Today, there is growing \r\nrecognition that cultural values and interpretations of \r\nsacred texts can either punish and harm women or \r\nliberate and support them. Countries and communities \r\nare engaged in conversations and programmes that \r\naddress culturally loaded issues such as child marriage, \r\ngirls’ education, HIV prevention, female genital \r\nmutilation/cutting and violence against women.  \r\n All over the world, communities are \r\nprogressively invoking values and beliefs that protect \r\nthe rights of women and young people, and bringing \r\nabout change from within. We are witnessing a \r\ngrowing number of men of all walks of life standing \r\nside by side with women to end traditional practices \r\nthat harm women, as well as to end violence against \r\nwomen. Here, I would like, on behalf of UNFPA, to \r\nexpress appreciation for the leadership shown by the \r\nSecretary-General in his campaign Unite to End \r\nViolence against Women.  \r\n Secondly, we know that investment is critical. \r\nWhile we keep repeating that no woman should die \r\ngiving life, women continue to die needlessly from \r\npreventable causes during pregnancy and childbirth — \r\none woman during every minute of my statement. The \r\ngood news is that momentum for maternal health is \r\nbuilding and there is growing commitment at the \r\nhighest levels. Now we need to match that commitment \r\nwith increased funding for a comprehensive package of \r\nmaternal and reproductive health services to achieve \r\nMillennium Development Goal (MDG) 5.  \r\n In war or peace, in natural or man-made disasters, \r\nin a prosperous economy or during a financial crisis, \r\nwomen continue to get pregnant. What happens after \r\nthat depends on whether they are rich or poor. They \r\ncan give birth, or they sometimes seek abortion, safely \r\nand legally or unsafely, outside national laws; they \r\nsometimes miscarry; and too often, they die from \r\npreventable causes while giving birth. We cannot \r\nchange or postpone those facts of life until the war \r\nends, until communities have recovered from the \r\ndisaster or until the economy is strong again. \r\n During this decade, funding for population and \r\nreproductive health has remained at the same level, \r\nwhile funding for other areas of health has increased \r\nsubstantially. Today, I call on all Governments to make \r\nthe health and reproductive rights of women a financial \r\npriority. By ensuring universal access to reproductive \r\nhealth — including family planning — to all, rich or \r\npoor, women can manage the number and spacing of \r\ntheir pregnancies. That will accelerate progress \r\ntowards achieving all the Millennium Development \r\nGoals, particularly MDG 1: eradicate extreme poverty \r\nand hunger. \r\n Thirdly, we know that today\u0027s demographic \r\nchallenges are unprecedented and that they demand \r\ncoherent policy responses. Population data, if properly \r\nanalysed and utilized, provide a solid foundation for \r\ndeveloping responsive policies and programmes and \r\nfor monitoring and ensuring accountability. The \r\n2010 round of censuses provides much-needed data, \r\nand surveys and rapid assessments lead us to target \r\nresponses to the most vulnerable. \r\n While we welcome the largest population of \r\nyoung people in the world’s history, we are, at the \r\nsame time, seeing an increase in the number of older \r\npersons worldwide. Governments are responsible for \r\nproviding support to old and young simultaneously in a \r\n A/64/PV.17\r\n \r\n5 09-55404 \r\n \r\nchallenging development context. I call upon the \r\nAssembly to take this opportunity to foster \r\nintergenerational solidarity. \r\n While we are witnessing rapid population growth \r\nin the world’s poorest nations, some of the world’s \r\nrichest countries face population declines. In order to \r\naddress both scenarios, women and couples need \r\nexpanded choices when it comes to childbearing and \r\nchild-rearing. \r\n In the poorest countries with high fertility and \r\nmortality rates, intensified efforts are needed to \r\nprovide reproductive health services — including \r\nfamily planning — to meet the unmet need of the \r\n200 million women who want to plan their families but \r\ndo not have the means to do so. In countries with low \r\nfertility, specific policies and programmes are needed \r\nto ensure that women and couples can balance work \r\nand family life and that there is social protection for \r\nthe ageing. In several Nordic countries, there is \r\npreliminary evidence that, after a certain point of \r\ndevelopment — especially development that benefits \r\nwomen and supports them with family-friendly policies \r\nand services — fertility rises again. This shows once \r\nagain the direct link between economic and social \r\ndevelopment, poverty reduction, women’s \r\nempowerment, gender equality and population \r\ndynamics. \r\n Fourthly, we know that working in silos does not \r\nproduce maximum benefits, because people’s lives, \r\nneeds and rights are intertwined. In order to generate \r\ngreater progress, development partners are increasingly \r\nworking together across sectors to build national \r\ncapacity, engage communities and strengthen national \r\nsystems. The United Nations is harmonizing its support \r\nfor countries aimed at increasing national ownership \r\nand scaling up national programmes. United Nations \r\nreform for development effectiveness is critical if we \r\nare to achieve better results on the ground. \r\n My fifth and last point is that, knowing that hard-\r\nwon development gains can be easily reversed and very \r\ndifficult to regain, we must take urgent and concerted \r\naction to protect the most vulnerable. Today, women \r\nand children constitute almost 80 per cent of the \r\nworld’s poor. As world leaders take decisions \r\nconcerning the financial, energy, food and climate \r\nchange crises, they must focus on the impact of those \r\ncrises on the poor, especially women and children. \r\nOtherwise, women and children will bear the brunt of \r\nthose multiple crises and society as a whole will be \r\ndiminished. That is an important message to carry \r\nforward to the climate change conference in \r\nCopenhagen.  \r\n Our challenge is to summon the courage and \r\nwisdom to respond to those crises and to foster \r\ndevelopment that is both socially equitable and \r\nenvironmentally sound. To that end, the ICPD \r\nProgramme of Action remains a valid blueprint. As we \r\nlook forward to 2015, we need to accelerate the \r\nimplementation of the ICPD Programme of Action, and \r\nas we commemorate its fifteenth anniversary and look \r\nforward to the next five years, development partners at \r\nthe global, regional and country levels are reaffirming \r\ntheir commitments. \r\n In September, almost 400 representatives of \r\nnon-governmental organizations (NGOs) — a third of \r\nthem young people — came from 130 countries to the \r\nNGO Forum on Sexual and Reproductive Health and \r\nDevelopment. In the Berlin Call to Action, they called \r\non Governments to accelerate the implementation of \r\nthe promises made in Cairo, including the provision of \r\nyouth-friendly services and comprehensive sexuality \r\nand life-skills education. That would allow young \r\npeople to make informed decisions and take \r\nresponsible action, because ignorance is death. They \r\nurged Governments to strengthen their commitment to \r\nsexual and reproductive health and rights for all. As \r\nNGOs, they pledged to work in partnership with \r\nGovernments, United Nations agencies and other \r\ndevelopment partners to ensure the full and timely \r\nimplementation of the ICPD Programme of Action. \r\n This month, we are looking forward to many \r\nevents, including an NGO conference in Beijing on \r\nsexual and reproductive health for Asia and the Pacific, \r\na meeting of the Partners in Population and \r\nDevelopment, and a ministerial meeting on maternal \r\nhealth and an international parliamentary conference, \r\nboth to be held in Addis Ababa, to galvanize greater \r\ncommitment and action. \r\n As we move forward, my colleagues and I at \r\nUNFPA will continue to listen to the members of the \r\nAssembly. We will continue to work with their national \r\ninstitutions and with civil society, and we will continue \r\nto support them in implementing their national \r\nprogrammes as envisioned in the ICPD Programme of \r\nAction. In this, we are guided by passion for the \r\nagenda, compassion for the people we serve and \r\nA/64/PV.17  \r\n \r\n09-55404 6 \r\n \r\ncommitment to national ownership by Governments \r\nand communities. \r\n I thank the Assembly for putting people first. \r\n Ms. Kurbanova (Tajikistan) (spoke in Russian): \r\nIt is my honour to extend the greetings of the \r\nGovernment of the Republic of Tajikistan to the \r\nmembers of the Assembly at this meeting devoted to \r\ncommemoration of the fifteenth anniversary of the \r\nInternational Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment.  \r\n Upon achieving independence, Tajikistan chose \r\nthe model of a social State, as enshrined in its \r\nConstitution. This has determined State policy \r\npriorities in the areas of social security and social \r\ndevelopment. State support for families and children is \r\nrecognized by the Government of Tajikistan as its \r\nhighest priority. This is reflected in the generally \r\nrecognized status of our social institutions as well as in \r\nthe urgent problems facing our society at the current \r\nstage of its development. The newly adopted \r\nConstitution of the Republic reinforces and guarantees \r\nuniversally recognized values to protect the equal \r\nrights of men and women in our society. The Republic \r\nof Tajikistan has ratified virtually all international \r\ninstruments on the equality of the rights of men and \r\nwomen and on combating all forms of violence against \r\nwomen and children. \r\n A review of the basic indicators for the \r\ndevelopment of Tajikistan’s population over the past \r\n15 years since the Cairo Conference in 1994 shows that \r\nthe Republic of Tajikistan survived a period of political \r\ninstability and has undertaken the process of \r\ndeveloping market relations. My country’s economy is \r\nnow moving towards a qualitatively new stage of \r\nmanagement and administration.  \r\n However, there are still quite a few unresolved \r\nproblems, the principal one being the matter of \r\novercoming poverty. According to the 1999 World \r\nBank Living Standards Survey for the country, the \r\npercentage of the population living below the poverty \r\nline was 82 in 2003, 64 in 2005, and 53.5 in 2007. \r\nAccording to the World Bank data, the factors \r\nresponsible for that reduction in poverty were, first and \r\nforemost, peace, macroeconomic stability and \r\nmigration of the population.  \r\n Since the Government of the Republic of \r\nTajikistan recognizes poverty as one of its most \r\nimportant problems, it has devoted significant efforts \r\nto implementing a poverty reduction policy. To \r\npromote speedy and socially just economic growth, \r\nincrease real incomes and improve the quality of life, \r\nour Parliament has approved a poverty reduction \r\nstrategy paper. This document is aimed at an increase \r\nin the real income of the population, a just distribution \r\nof the benefits of economic growth, the strengthening \r\nof targeted assistance, the expansion of private \r\ninitiatives for the creation of jobs, increasing access by \r\nthe poorer social strata to health and education, and an \r\nenhancement in the quality of management and \r\nsecurity.  \r\n A decisive factor in the country’s population \r\ngrowth rate is the birth rate, which makes up for any \r\nlosses caused by natural population decline or \r\nemigration. Population growth in Tajikistan is thus \r\nensured, with between 190,000 to 200,000 children \r\nborn every year. In recent years, we have seen a stable \r\ndownward trend in the birth rate, going from \r\n34.2 births per thousand to 27.9 per thousand.  \r\n A high growth rate has an impact not only on the \r\nage structure of the population, but also on the size of \r\nthe family. Families with many children are in a less \r\nadvantageous situation, materially speaking, than those \r\nwith fewer children, and they have a higher risk of \r\nwinding up below the poverty level.  \r\n One of the major problems in the country is \r\ninfant mortality. The primary causes of infant \r\nmortality, according to the 2008 data, are infectious \r\nand parasitic diseases, which account for 35.4 per cent \r\nof infant mortality, respiratory illnesses, which account \r\nfor 28.3 per cent, and perinatal problems, which \r\naccount for 20.1 per cent.  \r\n Another health problem for the population of \r\nTajikistan is the area of women’s reproductive health, \r\nin particular the high maternal mortality rate. \r\nAccording to data from the Ministry of Health of the \r\nRepublic of Tajikistan, the maternal mortality rate in \r\n2008 was 43 per 100,000 live births.  \r\n Migration has had a strong impact on the shaping \r\nand development of our population. At the beginning \r\nof the 1990s, there was a considerable outflow of \r\npopulation from Tajikistan, primarily from large and \r\nindustrially developed cities, where there was a high \r\npercentage of non-indigenous inhabitants. Every year, \r\n100,000 individuals emigrated.  \r\n A/64/PV.17\r\n \r\n7 09-55404 \r\n \r\n Now, migration involving changing one’s place of \r\nresidence has stabilized. The outflow from the \r\nRepublic has dropped by a factor of five, reaching \r\nabout 10,400 people in 2008. In the period from \r\n1994 to 1998, there was an exodus of approximately \r\n280,000 highly educated and qualified people. This \r\nundoubtedly had a serious impact on the social and \r\neconomic situation in the country and, consequently, \r\non the living standards of the entire population, in \r\nparticular children. Currently, the major reasons for \r\nemigration are study, job opportunities and low income \r\nlevel. As a result, we are seeing some temporary \r\nemigration in search of jobs, primarily to Russia. This \r\naccounts for more than 500,000 migrants.  \r\n The employment problem in the Republic of \r\nTajikistan, as a country of labour surpluses, is one of \r\nthe central issues in our national poverty reduction \r\nstrategy paper. The development of market relations \r\nhas led to a restructuring of the economy. Jobs in the \r\nState sector were quickly reduced and people had to \r\nfind work in the growing private sector and through \r\nentrepreneurship. The number of gainfully employed in \r\nthe country grew by 17.5 per cent from 1994 to 2008. \r\nThe number of those employed grew by 16.9 per cent \r\nand accounted for 2,160,000 people by 2008. We have \r\nalso seen a rise in the nominal wage in the Republic.  \r\n The high birth rate and high number of children \r\nin families has a direct impact on the economic and \r\nsocial situation of families, on women’s employment \r\nand on the level of their education. There are over \r\n3.6 million women in Tajikistan — that is, women \r\naccount for 49.8 per cent of the population. My country \r\nattaches great significance to women’s reproductive \r\nhealth and safe motherhood, as confirmed by work to \r\nestablish a new approach to reproductive health and \r\nissues of human rights.  \r\n The Government has ratified international legal \r\ninstruments on the rights of women and children, has \r\ncreated new institutions to manage State policy on \r\npopulation and development and is monitoring on an \r\nongoing basis the implementation of national \r\nprogrammes and strategies. All of this has enabled us \r\nto analyse the situation in the area of reproductive \r\nhealth. Taking into account the current situation and \r\nthe state of reproductive health among the population, \r\nand in order to ensure a comprehensive approach to \r\nimproving activities in the fields of reproductive health \r\nand family planning, the Government of the Republic \r\nof Tajikistan approved in 2004 a strategic plan for \r\nreproductive health for the period leading up to 2014.  \r\n The extremely poorly developed network of \r\ninstitutions providing maternal and child health care \r\nhas contributed to the development of such negative \r\nphenomena as anaemia among the population. A great \r\ndeal of attention is currently being paid to training and \r\nretraining medical personnel in the area of reproductive \r\nhealth and the use of modern contraceptive techniques \r\nand new educational programmes. Among the basic \r\nefforts aimed at improving reproductive health and \r\nensuring reproductive rights are the efforts aimed at \r\nproviding quality services and at strengthening the \r\nsystem of immunization and vaccine services.  \r\n The Government of the Republic of Tajikistan has \r\nchosen a strategy for ensuring safe motherhood \r\nthrough family planning services offered by qualified \r\nreproductive health specialists since 1996. There has \r\nbeen a yearly increase in the number of visits to \r\nreproductive health centres and other health centres for \r\nissues pertaining to family planning, which now \r\naccount for about 45 per cent of total visits.  \r\n In conclusion, the problems and issues that we \r\nwill discuss jointly at this session are, in our view, \r\nhighly relevant. Modern solutions are required to \r\nimprove the social development of the populations of \r\nMember States of the United Nations. I am convinced \r\nthat the decisions adopted by the Assembly will form \r\nthe basis for mutual cooperation, which, in turn, will \r\npromote dynamic economic development in all our \r\nStates. \r\n The challenges of solving unemployment, \r\nproviding health care, protecting maternal health and \r\nother important issues are addressed in the national \r\ndevelopment strategy of Tajikistan, which was drawn \r\nup on the basis of the Millennium Development Goals \r\nand is an extremely important strategic document for \r\nour Government. At the present time, all of our efforts \r\nare aimed at the implementation of that national \r\nstrategy. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I now give the \r\nfloor to Ms. Vita Skilling, Minister for Health and \r\nSocial Affairs of the Federated States of Micronesia, \r\nwho will make a statement on behalf of the Pacific \r\nIslands Forum. \r\n Ms. Skilling (Federated States of Micronesia): As \r\nwe mark the fifteenth anniversary of the International \r\nA/64/PV.17  \r\n \r\n09-55404 8 \r\n \r\nConference on Population and Development, I am \r\npleased to make this statement on behalf of the Pacific \r\nIsland Forum countries — Australia, the Cook Islands, \r\nthe Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, \r\nNauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Republic of \r\nthe Marshall Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, \r\nTokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu.  \r\n We would like to reiterate our strong and \r\nunequivocal support for the Programme of Action of \r\nthe International Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment (ICPD), adopted in Cairo in 1994; the \r\nfive-year review of the implementation of the ICPD \r\nProgramme of Action, which culminated in the twenty-\r\nfirst special session of the General Assembly, held in \r\nNew York in 1999; the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) endorsed in 2000; the 2005 World Summit \r\nOutcome; and the expanded MDG targets and \r\nindicators contained in the MDG monitoring \r\nframework adopted by this body. \r\n While we acknowledge the significant progress \r\nPacific Island member countries have made since 1994 \r\ntowards achieving the goals of the ICPD Programme of \r\nAction, there are a number of critical issues of \r\nparticular relevance to our region that require urgent \r\nattention from our Pacific Island countries and national \r\nand international partners. \r\n Recognizing the importance of building on \r\ncurrent national and regional initiatives and having \r\nmade progress on the commitments so far, we would \r\nlike to reiterate our support for these commitments and \r\nto assure the international community that we are \r\nworking towards achieving our targets. In this respect, \r\nwe would highlight in particular the Cairns Compact \r\non Strengthening Development Coordination in the \r\nPacific, adopted by the leaders of the Pacific Islands \r\nForum in August 2009 and endorsed by their \r\ndevelopment partners; the Pacific Policy Framework \r\nfor achieving universal access to reproductive health \r\nservices and commodities, which was developed and \r\nendorsed by the Pacific Ministers of Health in Fiji in \r\nNovember 2008; the Madang Declaration made by the \r\nMinisters of Health in Papua New Guinea in 2009; the \r\nregional declarations made by Pacific parliamentarians \r\nsince 2003 on combating HIV and on addressing the \r\nissues facing youth; the revised 2004 Pacific Platform \r\nfor Action; the Pacific Plan; and other relevant \r\npopulation and gender declarations and commitments. \r\n We acknowledge that preventable maternal \r\nmortality and morbidity constitutes the greatest health \r\ninequity.  It is an indicator of social injustice and could \r\nconstitute a violation of human rights. While the \r\nPacific Island member States have undertaken \r\nstrategies for accelerated action to address maternal \r\nmortality and morbidity, some countries in the Pacific \r\nstill experience unacceptable, avoidable maternal \r\ndeaths owing to the inability of women to access \r\nrelevant services, including family planning, in a \r\ntimely manner. Special action is urgently needed in \r\nsome countries to ensure access to quality prenatal, \r\npostnatal and emergency obstetric care for all mothers \r\nand voluntary family planning services, regardless of \r\nan individual’s socio-economic, educational and \r\ndemographic status or geographic residence. \r\n Given the high rates of unintended teenage \r\npregnancy and sexually transmitted infections and the \r\nexpanding HIV epidemic in the Pacific, and despite the \r\naction taken by our member countries and partners to \r\ndate, there is an increasingly urgent need to support \r\nuniversal access to reproductive health information, \r\nservices and commodities. Key to achieving this is a \r\nfocus on strengthening health systems and addressing \r\ninequities, with particular attention devoted to \r\nvulnerable groups and underserved populations, \r\nincluding young people. \r\n While significant progress has been made in \r\naddressing youth issues, there is a need for sustained \r\nnational action to ensure youth involvement in policy \r\nmaking and programming, especially in sexual and \r\nreproductive health issues, through information, \r\neducation and youth-friendly services, with a particular \r\nfocus on reducing unintended pregnancies, HIV \r\ninfections and sexually transmitted infections. \r\n We acknowledge that our region is slow in \r\nmaking progress towards gender equality and women\u0027s \r\nempowerment and that, to date, it has a lower \r\npercentage of parliamentary seats occupied by women \r\nthan any other region in the world. There are also other \r\nchallenges. Endemic violence against women and girls \r\nin some communities poses a significant risk to human \r\nsecurity and undermines our efforts to end poverty in \r\nour region. Recognizing the high prevalence of \r\nviolence against women and its associated negative \r\nlong-term consequences for women, their families and \r\ncommunities in the region, we would like to call the \r\nattention of the General Assembly to the need for \r\nincreased and sustained national action to eradicate \r\n A/64/PV.17\r\n \r\n9 09-55404 \r\n \r\nsexual and gender-based violence. We want to see an \r\nend to permissive community attitudes concerning this \r\nproblem, and to ensure that all individuals have equal \r\nprotection by law and equal access to justice. \r\n Finally, adapting to the impacts of climate change \r\nis an urgent challenge facing us all, particularly Pacific \r\nisland countries. Sustainable development activities \r\nand measures directly aimed at climate change \r\nadaptation are vital to securing livelihoods. It is \r\ntherefore crucial that climate change be incorporated \r\ninto the national development strategies of vulnerable \r\ncountries. We would also like to request urgent and \r\nsustained international action to support low-lying \r\nPacific islands in addressing issues of climate change, \r\nincluding population displacement and impacts on \r\nhuman welfare and development, as a matter of \r\ninternational responsibility. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I now give the \r\nfloor to Her Excellency Ms. Vanda Pignato, First Lady \r\nand Minister of Social Inclusion of El Salvador. \r\n Ms. Pignato (El Salvador) (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nam immensely gratified at the opportunity to take part \r\nin this special meeting, at which the pre-eminent \r\nmultilateral global Organization is celebrating the \r\nfifteenth anniversary of the holding of the International \r\nConference on Population and Development and of its \r\nmain outcome, the Programme of Action adopted on \r\nthat occasion (see A/CONF.171/13/Rev.1). \r\n That event was an important one in the history of \r\nthe United Nations because it laid out a broader vision \r\nand provided an in-depth look at problems related to \r\npopulation and development. The Conference, the \r\ndebates that took place and its legacy undoubtedly \r\nconstitute a turning point on this matter. Indeed, since \r\nthen there has been a growing awareness that, as noted \r\nin the first chapter of the 1994 Programme of Action, \r\npopulation, poverty, production and consumption \r\npatterns and the environment are very closely \r\ninterconnected, such that none of them can be \r\nconsidered in isolation.  \r\n The issue of development is no longer seen as \r\nsomething that is merely economic; indeed, social \r\nconsiderations have become an integral part of the \r\nconcept of development. In terms of the causes and \r\neffects of development, population issues are no longer \r\nseen as a statistical data set from which to spin \r\nabstractions, but rather a defining aspect in the lives of \r\nmen and women around the world and of the problems \r\nthey face.  \r\n The Conference’s new perspective on man’s \r\nrelationship to his environment made ecology a \r\nhousehold word around the world. Attention was drawn \r\nto the plight of so-called minorities and vulnerable and \r\noppressed groups within countries, thus promoting \r\nequity policies around the world. The need to adopt a \r\ngender-based approach was highlighted as an essential \r\npart of any analysis or solution to the problems that \r\nafflict our planet. The concept of diversity was not \r\ninvented at the Conference but was re-validated as an \r\nindispensable cultural part of the relationship between \r\nhuman beings and between nations and continents. \r\nFresh light was shed on the issue of international \r\nmigration as a phenomenon made possible by \r\nglobalization, with a decisive emphasis on \r\ndevelopment. Lastly, the lucid and global treatment of \r\nthese and other very important topics made an impact \r\nthat is still felt today. The recommendations made and \r\nagreements achieved at the Conference are therefore a \r\npart of the main public policies of many States.  \r\n Unfortunately, 15 years have passed and the \r\nconcrete results of the Programme of Action have been \r\nslow to manifest themselves. They have been surpassed \r\nby the increasing awareness of these issues on the part \r\nof younger generations around the world. In that \r\nrespect, this commemoration is an urgent reminder to \r\ncontinue our efforts to reach those pending goals. It is \r\nalso a wake-up call to countries, Governments, \r\ninternational cooperation agencies and donor countries \r\nto continue their efforts beyond the 20-year threshold \r\nthat we originally set out and to ensure that compliance \r\nwith that deadline becomes a reality.  \r\n That means that all of us — national and \r\ninternational stakeholders, non-governmental \r\norganizations and other institutions, the academic \r\nworld and intellectuals — must combine our efforts so \r\nthat this increased awareness leads to actions aimed at \r\nthe formulation and adoption of human rights laws and \r\nfull respect for these rights in their most \r\ncomprehensive definition.  \r\n I come from a small country in a region afflicted \r\nby inequality, poverty, exclusion and resource scarcity, \r\nand ravaged by insecurity and crime due to the \r\ndestabilizing forces of drug trafficking and organized \r\ncrime. We are far from achieving the minimal threshold \r\nof dignity in daily life, even though our current efforts \r\nA/64/PV.17  \r\n \r\n09-55404 10 \r\n \r\nare firmly aimed at achieving basic guarantees in terms \r\nof human rights for all, in particular in terms of food, \r\nhealth, education and housing — in other words, at \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals, which \r\noverlap considerably with the Programme of Action. \r\n We are making serious efforts to achieve \r\nstandards of social conduct that are based on respect \r\nfor diversity and that foster tolerance of all kinds. An \r\nexample of such efforts is the Ciudad Mujer project, \r\nwhich my country’s Government established to bolster \r\nthe empowerment and rights of women.  \r\n One could say that this is a problem that belongs \r\nto my country and my region — that we should be the \r\nones to address and resolve the problems that I have \r\nmentioned here. While that is partly true, it is also a \r\nserious mistake. The problems of a region and its \r\npeoples are the problems of the entire international \r\ncommunity. Inequalities within and between countries \r\nare an unresolved matter and an open wound that is felt \r\nby the vast majority of the world, who seek to live in \r\nsolidarity with each other and in humane conditions. \r\n We have great faith in the work of the \r\nOrganization. That is why we believe that United \r\nNations participation and control, through its different \r\nbodies for policy implementation, must be greater and \r\nmust be proactive. I am thinking in particular of the \r\norigin and consequences of the international financial \r\ncrisis that was unleashed a few months ago, which \r\nmost affected the smallest countries and the weakest \r\neconomies.  \r\n In addition, in terms of population, I would like \r\nto point out that we still have to make considerable \r\nefforts to ensure the human rights of a growing part of \r\nour global society, that is, older persons. The \r\npopulation of older persons is growing in all countries. \r\nPolicies to provide care and assistance for them are \r\nfrankly lacking in our societies. This is a highly \r\nvulnerable sector of the population that requires special \r\nattention, as has already been acknowledged with \r\nregard to other sectors and population groups.  \r\n In the Americas, we have taken an important \r\ninitial step in terms of so-called soft law initiatives, \r\nnotably with the adoption of the Brazilian declaration \r\non the rights of older persons, which serves as a guide \r\nfor the steps we must take. Its adoption was followed \r\nby three meetings, the last of which took place last \r\nweek in Santiago, Chile. Moreover, on the international \r\nlevel, we have begun by adopting the Madrid Political \r\nDeclaration and International Plan of Action on \r\nAgeing.  \r\n I know that I share that concern with most of the \r\nmembers here. I would therefore like to take this \r\nopportunity, on behalf of El Salvador, to call for the \r\nsteps at the United Nations necessary to strengthen the \r\nprotection, promotion and full enjoyment of the rights \r\nof older persons.  \r\n I should like to reiterate that the Cairo \r\nProgramme of Action continues to be relevant. In fact, \r\n15 years following its adoption, it is more important \r\nthan ever. We must continue to work to implement it. \r\nThis means that we must work to make the Programme \r\nof Action a reality and a permanent component of \r\nhuman rights to guide the efforts of our global \r\nmultilateral Organization.  \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Mario Aoun, Minister of Social \r\nAffairs of Lebanon. \r\n Mr. Aoun (Lebanon) (spoke in Arabic): I wish at \r\nthe outset to convey our gratitude to Ms. Thoraya \r\nObaid, Executive Director of the United Nations \r\nPopulation Fund, for her statement. \r\n The repercussions of the global economic crisis \r\nare still being felt today as we commemorate the \r\nfifteenth anniversary of the convening of the \r\nInternational Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment. The impact of that crisis poses a \r\ngrowing threat to all countries, but especially to \r\ndeveloping countries. Today’s meeting is also taking \r\nplace against the backdrop of a more serious crisis, that \r\nof food. Demographic statistics reveal that the number \r\nof people living in poverty or extreme poverty is \r\ncontinuing to increase to unprecedented levels \r\nthroughout the world. That has further widened the \r\nsocial gap and worsened inequalities between social \r\ngroups. There has also been a decrease in the number \r\nof jobs, as well as a rise in unemployment throughout \r\nthe world following massive layoffs. In addition to \r\nthose crises, we also face even more challenging health \r\nand environmental problems that have the potential to \r\nworsen people’s living conditions by undermining \r\nefforts to achieve social development.  \r\n We are all aware of the fact that carrying out \r\ndemographic and development studies and analysing \r\ndemographic trends are key to developing an \r\ninternational strategy to help us to emerge from the \r\n A/64/PV.17\r\n \r\n11 09-55404 \r\n \r\neconomic crisis and mitigate its effects by preventing \r\nthreats and making it possible to resolve health, \r\nenvironmental and social problems in the world’s \r\nsocieties. All of that compels us to intensify our efforts \r\nand to enhance international cooperation in order to \r\nestablish a climate conducive to progress in achieving \r\nthe goals of the International Conference on Population \r\nand Development and in addressing the challenges we \r\nface and the obstacles to progress. \r\n Carrying out a review of demographic issues and \r\ntheir impact on development is more important than \r\never, in particular following the global economic crisis. \r\nThat entails identifying priorities and reconsidering \r\ngoals so that they meet the needs of regional and \r\ninternational societies to achieve human development \r\nand contain the recent crises.  \r\n The international community is continuing to \r\nwork tirelessly to end war and conflict, given their \r\nnegative impact on achieving the goals of the \r\nInternational Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment. However, the fact that certain countries \r\nare continuing to defy the will and decisions of the \r\ninternational community and to endanger the stability \r\nand security of certain societies through their actions \r\ncould undermine the chances for implementing social \r\ndevelopment goals by eroding basic conditions for a \r\ndecent life, which could serve to sow the seeds of a \r\nsocial revolution that could endanger social stability \r\nand security. \r\n Despite all the difficulties Lebanon has faced, \r\nincluding in particular the consequences of Israel’s war \r\nagainst it in July 2006, as well as the threats \r\nconfronting us today, my country has endeavoured to \r\nimplement the goals of the Conference. We have done \r\nso despite our very modest means. We would not have \r\nbeen able to achieve tangible human development \r\nresults, which have exceeded our economic \r\nperformance, without assistance from some \r\ninternational organizations, the private sector and \r\nfriendly countries. Our results are contributing to \r\nimproved public health conditions, addressing certain \r\nhealth problems affecting certain sectors of the \r\npopulation and improved reproductive health. There \r\nhave also been tangible results in ensuring primary \r\neducation for all, increasing enrolment rates in both \r\nhigh school and post-secondary education and bridging \r\nthe gap between male and female student. \r\n We have also made strides in the area of gender \r\nequality and in ensuring increased awareness by \r\nwomen of their rights and their participation in \r\neconomic and political life. \r\n We have also had success in reducing poverty by \r\naddressing its causes. We have provided assistance to \r\nfamilies living in poverty or extreme poverty by \r\nestablishing a programme and adopting a plan of action \r\nat the Ministry for Health and Social Affairs, working \r\ntogether with international organizations and private \r\ngroups.  \r\n Achieving the goals of the International \r\nConference on Population and Development could \r\ncontribute to resolving various development and \r\ndemographic problems and issues. In prioritizing those \r\ngoals, we must bear in mind the demands of current \r\ninternational emergencies. We therefore call for greater \r\ninvolvement by Government entities, international and \r\nregional organizations and civil society groups working \r\non development and population issues. That \r\ninvolvement should help us to achieve the goals by \r\nmaking the necessary political and legislative changes \r\nat the national, regional and international levels to \r\naddress the relevant issues.  \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I now give the \r\nfloor to Her Excellency Ms. Gandi Tugsjargal, Minister \r\nfor Social Protection and Labour of Mongolia. \r\n Ms. Tugsjargal (Mongolia) (spoke in Khalkha \r\nMongol, English text provided by the delegation): On \r\nbehalf of the Government of Mongolia and my \r\ndelegation, I would like to express my sincere gratitude \r\nto the United Nations, the United Nations Population \r\nFund (UNFPA) and other organizers of these special \r\nmeetings to focus global attention on population and \r\ndevelopment issues. \r\n Fifteen years have passed since the landmark \r\nInternational Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment (ICPD) in Cairo. We have gathered here \r\ntoday for the third time at our regular venue to review \r\nglobal achievements, constraints and lessons learned in \r\nthe area of population and development, as well as to \r\nidentify challenges in fulfilling goals and objectives of \r\nthe ICPD in the coming five-year period. \r\n The 1994 International Conference on Population \r\nand Development was a watershed event that produced \r\na concrete and detailed plan based on international \r\nconsensus in this area. Since then the international \r\nA/64/PV.17  \r\n \r\n09-55404 12 \r\n \r\ncommunity and national Governments have made \r\nsustained efforts for the implementation of the ICPD \r\nProgramme of Action (see A/CONF.171/13/Rev.1).  \r\n We are pleased to see that the Cairo agenda has \r\nnot remained a promise but has been translated into \r\nconcrete initiatives, policies, laws and programmes, at \r\ninternational and national levels, that are having \r\nsubstantial impacts on the well-being of millions of \r\npeople across the world. It is also worth noting that \r\nmany developing countries have made major progress \r\ntowards attaining objectives set out in the ICPD \r\nProgramme of Action.  \r\n Yet we all know that major gaps remain in the \r\nProgramme’s implementation. We are also confronting \r\nvarious new and emerging challenges that are causing \r\nsetbacks in efforts to achieve the established goals and \r\nobjectives. Current food, fuel and financial crises, \r\nglobal warming and, in some regions, armed conflicts \r\nhave adversely affected the well-being of people in one \r\nway or another. Therefore, my delegation is looking \r\nforward to identifying the right strategies to address \r\nthese challenges and gaps through this global review \r\nexercise. \r\n National efforts and actions are instrumental for \r\nthe implementation of the ICPD agenda. Mongolia has \r\nmade substantial progress in its implementation. The \r\nICPD principles have been reflected in key policy \r\ndocuments such as the National Population \r\nDevelopment Policy, the Health Sector Master Plan, \r\nthe National Reproductive Health Programmes, the \r\nNational Gender Equality Programme and the Law on \r\nCombating Domestic Violence.  \r\n Many issues on the agenda of the Programme of \r\nAction have been linked to the national Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) endorsed by the \r\nParliament of Mongolia in 2005, which facilitated the \r\nachievement of the national targets for the reduction of \r\nmaternal mortality by 2015. I am pleased to report that \r\nMongolia has considerably reduced maternal and child \r\nmortality in recent years. Also, we are making progress \r\nin the provision of reproductive health and education \r\nservices for adolescents. In this regard, I wish to thank \r\nUNFPA for its continued support and excellent \r\ncollaboration with the Government of Mongolia in \r\nmaking such progress. \r\n The Government of Mongolia consistently \r\nincreased the public budget for basic social services, \r\nincluding health and education, when the country’s \r\neconomy was growing at a faster rate, during the years \r\n2006 to 2008. In the light of the current economic \r\nslowdown, the Government is committed to \r\nmaintaining the progress achieved and to continuing \r\ninvestments in the health and education sectors. \r\n Despite those achievements and progress, there is \r\nmuch work to do on the population and development \r\nagenda. We are committed to continuing our efforts to \r\nreduce poverty, address migration-related issues and \r\nprovide better basic social services for disadvantaged \r\ngroups. In addition, more attention should be paid to \r\nsuch emerging challenges as population ageing, \r\ntrafficking in women and children and intensified \r\nurbanization.  \r\n I wish to take this opportunity to report that \r\nnational stakeholders, in collaboration with UNFPA, \r\nsuccessfully organized a national forum last \r\nSeptember, in the course of which we analysed our \r\nprogress, constraints and lessons learned in the area of \r\npopulation and development and identified the main \r\nchallenges ahead, along with ways to tackle them. \r\n Today we are holding a substantive discussion on \r\nchallenges in the area of population and development. \r\nWe have been living with a multitude of crises in \r\ndifferent sectors. We are witnessing how those crises \r\nhave affected the livelihoods of millions of people \r\naround the world. As a developing country Mongolia \r\nhas been seriously affected by the current global \r\neconomic and financial crisis and is currently coping \r\nwith its negative consequences. It is a real threat to the \r\nfull implementation of the ICPD agenda and the \r\nMDGs.  \r\n It is indeed true that no country in the world can \r\novercome the crisis on its own, even if it is investing \r\nall its efforts to that end. For that reason, in this time of \r\neconomic interdependence, close cooperation at the \r\nregional and subregional levels and among \r\nneighbouring countries is crucial to recover from the \r\ncrisis within the shortest possible period. \r\n In moving from crisis to crisis we have learned \r\nthat it is crucial to develop and strengthen reliable and \r\nsustainable systems to ensure income security, \r\naccessible health services and education for all, not \r\nonly in times of crisis but also during non-crisis \r\nperiods. In particular, health, unemployment and old-\r\nage safety nets must be improved. The United Nations \r\nand its funds and organizations should enhance their \r\n A/64/PV.17\r\n \r\n13 09-55404 \r\n \r\ntechnical assistance to the developing countries in \r\nthose areas. \r\n The complex challenges, both existing and \r\nemerging, in the areas of population and development \r\nshould be addressed with new and creative approaches \r\nat both the international and national levels. For \r\nexample, international migration is of particular \r\nconcern for both origin and destination nations. The \r\nsituation has been further complicated by uneven \r\ncapacities — or, in most cases, the lack of any \r\ncapacity — to develop policy and carry out appropriate \r\nmanagement of the issues at hand. Therefore, I wish to \r\nsee the United Nations play a greater role in this area. \r\n I would like to conclude my speech by \r\nreaffirming, on behalf of the Government of Mongolia, \r\nour commitment to invest all our efforts to achieve the \r\nobjectives of the ICPD. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Jean-Marie Ehouzou, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Benin. \r\n Mr. Ehouzou (Benin) (spoke in French): We are \r\nmeeting in New York today, 12 October 2009, during \r\nthe sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly, to \r\ncommemorate a major event for all Member States of \r\nour Organization, in particular for African populations, \r\nnamely, the fifteenth anniversary of the Cairo \r\nInternational Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment (ICPD). Indeed, in the course of those \r\nimportant international meetings in 1994, \r\n179 participating Governments adopted a 20-year \r\nprogramme that is evaluated every five years. \r\n The efforts made from year to year since then \r\nhave made us aware of the fact that population, \r\npoverty, problems stemming from our habits of \r\nproduction and consumption, and threats to the \r\nenvironment are questions so closely linked that none \r\ncan be dealt with individually. The Conference also \r\nmarked a new degree of understanding among those \r\nworking to promote international development about \r\nthe indissoluble link between population and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n The ICPD Programme of Action (see \r\nA/CONF.171/13/Rev.1) spells out the specific \r\nobjectives to be implemented by all countries. One of \r\nthe most important is the integration of population \r\nquestions into strategies, planning, the decision-making \r\nprocess and the allocation of development resources at \r\nevery level and in every region. The aim here is to \r\nsatisfy the needs and improve the quality of life of \r\npresent and future generations. \r\n Today we can reaffirm that the 15 years of \r\nProgramme implementation have made possible \r\nnotable demographic, social, economic, ecological and \r\npolitical changes in most of the countries that \r\ncommitted to it. There has been distinct progress in the \r\nareas of access to reproductive health care, declining \r\nbirth and mortality rates, raising education and income \r\nlevels and improving educational systems and the legal \r\nand socio-economic status of women. \r\n In my country, Benin, we launched bold \r\ninitiatives following the Cairo Conference to \r\nimplement the Programme of Action, as demonstrated \r\nby the adoption in May 1996 of a declaration on \r\npopulation policy, which has provided us with a \r\nnational framework of reference in this area. Since \r\nApril 2006 the Government of Boni Yayi, President of \r\nthe Republic of Benin, has adopted numerous measures \r\nand taken important steps in areas related to that \r\ncommitment. Allow me to mention a few of them here. \r\n Socio-demographic surveys have been conducted, \r\nof which the most recent was a modular survey of \r\nhousehold living conditions. We have developed \r\npolicies and plans of action that integrate population \r\nquestions. We have strengthened capacity and analysis \r\nin the area of gender equality, improved the legal status \r\nand laws governing the condition of women and \r\ndeveloped micro-finance as an effective economic \r\ninstrument for the empowerment of women. We have \r\nadopted regulations in the legal, economic, legislative, \r\nstrategic and institutional areas aimed at enhancing the \r\nwell-being of the family, the basic unit of society, and \r\nat promoting equality of opportunity within families. A \r\nnew family code has been adopted. We are \r\nstrengthening action in the areas of employment, \r\nreproductive health and children’s rights to health and, \r\nfor those under five years old, to schooling and \r\nliteracy, with the support of development partners. We \r\nare intensifying the fight against HIV/AIDS, resulting \r\nin a significant reduction in the prevalence of this \r\ndisease. \r\n We pay a heartfelt tribute to the United Nations \r\nPopulation Fund (UNFPA) for the very effective and \r\nbalanced support it has given Benin in dealing with the \r\nissues within its sphere of competence, where we have \r\nshown encouraging — though still insufficient — \r\nA/64/PV.17  \r\n \r\n09-55404 14 \r\n \r\nresults. We hope to be able to continue to benefit from \r\ndynamic international cooperation with all our \r\ndevelopment partners to meet the numerous challenges \r\nthat confront us in our efforts to achieve the goals of \r\nthe ICPD. \r\n Those challenges include, among others, access \r\nto better reproductive health services, capacity \r\nstrengthening, caring for street children, and \r\nintegrating environmental concerns into all sectors of \r\nnational life. Such challenges continue to be a heavy \r\nburden on social requirements, particularly in the areas \r\nof nutrition, education, health, employment, housing, \r\nurban management and the availability of production \r\nelements. Those challenges are increasing, and, given \r\nthe deterioration of the current international context, \r\nthey threaten to wipe out the gains made. \r\n We know the extent to which the present financial \r\ncrisis has compounded the energy, food and \r\nenvironmental crises and is seriously affecting the \r\nsituation of a number of developing countries in \r\ngeneral and those of the least developed countries, of \r\nwhich Benin is one, in particular. Poverty is growing in \r\nthe continent of Africa much faster than anywhere else, \r\nand I would like to appeal to the developed countries to \r\nincrease their support of developing countries in \r\ndifficulty. \r\n Benin also supports the recommendations and \r\nmeasures in the Secretary-General’s report entitled \r\n“Africa’s development needs: state of implementation \r\nof various commitments, challenges and the way \r\nforward” (A/64/208). They emphasize strengthening \r\nthe continent’s capacity to deal with the effects of the \r\ncrises and preserve the gains that have been made. \r\nTherefore we should be able to present acceptable \r\nresults of the comprehensive implementation of the \r\nICPD Programme of Action in five years. It goes \r\nwithout saying that the progress we will have made \r\nhere will help us move towards achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals by 2015. \r\n To be sure, the forecasts made by authoritative \r\nanalysts acknowledge that those objectives can be \r\ncompromised by current problems. But we must give \r\nthe lie to such forecasts. To do so, we need greater \r\nsolidarity, determination and consistency in the steps \r\nwe undertake to achieve our goals. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Sugiri Syarief, Minister of \r\nthe National Family Planning Coordinating Board of \r\nIndonesia. \r\n Mr. Syarief (Indonesia): Let me begin by \r\nexpressing to you my delegation’s sincere appreciation, \r\nMr. President, for convening this important meeting to \r\ncommemorate the International Conference on \r\nPopulation and Development Cairo (ICPD) consensus, \r\nafter 15 years of its implementation. We also welcome \r\nyour statement, which truly emphasized the strategic \r\nimportance of the issue at hand. The significance of \r\nthis meeting is also reflected by the presence of the \r\nSecretary-General. We acknowledge and appreciate his \r\njoining us for the review. I would also like to extend \r\nmy appreciation to the Executive Director of the \r\nUnited Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) for her \r\nremarks and for the relentless support shown by the \r\nentire agency for the issue of population and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n We are not here just to review the progress made \r\nin implementing the Conference’s Programme of \r\nAction (see A/CONF.171/13/Rev.1) but also to chart \r\nthe course for future implementation over the next five \r\nyears.  \r\n As the world’s fourth most populous nation, with \r\n231.4 million people, Indonesia attaches great \r\nimportance to issues pertaining to population and \r\ndevelopment. We have made considerable strides in \r\nimplementing the ICPD Programme of Action within \r\nthe context of the Millennium Development Goals \r\ndevelopment framework. The details of my full report \r\nare in the Indonesian Country Report document, which \r\nis before the Assembly. \r\n For Indonesia, implementation has been linked to \r\npopulation policies and programmes that constitute an \r\nintegral part of the Long-Term Development Plan \r\n(2005-2025) and Medium-Term Development Plan \r\n(2010-2014). As part of our population and \r\ndevelopment law, the ICPD Programme of Action has \r\nbeen the guiding light for action in that regard. The \r\noverall objective of Indonesia’s population policy is to \r\nenhance population quality, manage population size \r\nand growth, guide population mobility and improve \r\npopulation information systems. \r\n Fifteen years after the Cairo Conference, we can \r\ntell the Assembly that Indonesia has achieved \r\nsignificant progress. So far, one of the main results of \r\nour implementation efforts has been a sharp reduction \r\nin the number of people who must survive on less than \r\n A/64/PV.17\r\n \r\n15 09-55404 \r\n \r\n$1 a day. Thus Indonesia has achieved one of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). Now the \r\nchallenge for the country is to reduce the number of \r\nthose struggling to survive on $2 per day. The aim is to \r\nequip them in such a way so that they do not easily fall \r\nbelow the national poverty line in the event of another \r\neconomic crisis. \r\n Part of our national poverty reduction strategy is \r\nto improve school enrolment rates — especially those \r\nof girls and women, so that they can be part of an \r\neducated workforce capable of meeting the needs of \r\nthe labour market. Because of that strategy, enrolment \r\nrates have increased considerably. As revealed by \r\nselected indicators, such as the gender-related human \r\ndevelopment index and the gender empowerment \r\nmeasure, women are deriving substantial benefits from \r\nthe strategy. We are also addressing occupational \r\nstereotypes that limit the horizons of women at the \r\nlower socio-economic levels. \r\n In addition, work is being done to eliminate other \r\nobstacles that are hindering the advancement of \r\nwomen. Action is being taken to protect the rights of \r\nworking women, particularly those who work overseas; \r\nto narrow the gender gap in education, especially \r\nintermediate and tertiary education; to reduce the high \r\nmaternal mortality rate; to halt domestic violence; and \r\nto prevent the trafficking of women and girls. \r\n Nothing better demonstrates the urgent need for \r\ndecisive action to help women than the issue of safe \r\nmotherhood in Indonesia. Approximately 9,800 women \r\ndie each year as a result of pregnancy and delivery \r\ncomplications. In response, a maternal health \r\nprogramme focusing on improving cost-effective \r\naccess to and the availability of high-quality maternal \r\nhealth services is being brought into operation. We \r\nhave also strengthened cross-sector and cross-\r\nprogramme cooperation and empowered families and \r\ncommunities. We have improved planning coordination \r\nand activities, including advocacy, to ensure safer \r\npregnancy and child survival. Further, we have \r\noptimized the allocation of funds and enhanced \r\nprogramme management through surveillance, \r\nmonitoring and evaluation. \r\n On another important front for women — family \r\nplanning — we are also making progress. We are \r\ncurrently engaged in revitalizing our family planning \r\nprogramme, even as unfavourable social and political \r\nchanges at the global level have affected it. More \r\nwomen and couples can now choose the number and \r\nspacing of their children through family planning. \r\nIndonesia is also beginning to end rapid population \r\ngrowth and to keep its fertility rate close to \r\nreplacement level. At present, the fertility rate is 2.34. \r\nIn addition, infant mortality is declining in most \r\nprovinces, having been reduced to 34 per 1,000 live \r\nbirths. The maternal mortality rate in 2007 was 228 per \r\n100,000 live births, which is close to the objective set \r\nout in our medium-term development plan, although \r\nwe may not achieve the MDG target by 2015. \r\n As part of that thrust, Indonesia is committed to \r\nthe promotion of reproductive health and reproductive \r\nrights. Women can avail themselves of comprehensive \r\nreproductive health education and services. In the area \r\nof adolescent reproductive health, we have integrated \r\nrelevant issues into our national development strategy \r\nsince 2000. The main focus of the adolescent \r\nprogramme is to provide teenage girls and boys with \r\nreproductive health information and counselling related \r\nto gender equality, responsible sexual behaviour and \r\nthe prevention of unwanted pregnancy, avoiding drug \r\nabuse and acquiring life skills. \r\n However, efforts to achieve reproductive health \r\ngoals are being hindered by the spread of HIV/AIDS in \r\nIndonesia. Indonesia is seeing an alarming increase in \r\nthe infection rate, and therefore we are exploring \r\nvarious ways and means to combat HIV/AIDS in a \r\ncomprehensive manner. More life-saving drugs are \r\nreaching people living with HIV/AIDS. We have \r\nadopted measures to prevent mother-to-child HIV \r\ntransmission and have taken steps to ensure that HIV \r\nprevention and treatment services are available in all \r\nhealth-care settings. \r\n Much more remains to be done, and that is why \r\nIndonesia has welcomed international support in \r\nreaching its population-related goals. Thus, our \r\ninitiative in establishing Partners in Population and \r\nDevelopment: a South-South Initiative has been very \r\nhelpful in terms of building capacity and gaining \r\naccess to the funds and technical expertise provided by \r\nthe international donor community. \r\n As a result of the challenges associated with \r\nimplementing the ICPD Programme of Action over the \r\npast 15 years, Indonesia has learned many valuable \r\nlessons. First, whatever the challenges may be, \r\nimplementation efforts and commitment must not \r\nweaken at any level. Secondly, the Programme of \r\nA/64/PV.17  \r\n \r\n09-55404 16 \r\n \r\nAction can be implemented only if sufficient human \r\nand financial resources are mobilized for that purpose. \r\nThirdly, national institutional capacities must be \r\nstrengthened through a diversity of mixed partnerships. \r\nFollowing those three principles, Indonesia expects to \r\nmake broader and deeper progress in achieving the \r\ngoals of the Programme of Action. \r\n Finally, as a means of accelerating future \r\nprogress, it is important that these special meetings of \r\nthe General Assembly concentrate on building \r\nconsensus among Member States concerning financing \r\nfor the Programme of Action and the availability of \r\nadditional expertise to help developing countries. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I next give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Shashi Tharoor, Minister \r\nof State for External Affairs of India. \r\n Mr. Tharoor (India): As I am speaking for the \r\nfirst time in the General Assembly as representative of \r\nIndia, please allow me, Sir, to congratulate you on your \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly. We look \r\nforward to working under your leadership. \r\n I am honoured and privileged to participate in \r\ntoday’s open debate to commemorate the fifteenth \r\nanniversary of the International Conference on \r\nPopulation and Development (ICPD), which was a \r\nmajor international initiative on an issue of critical \r\nimportance to India.  \r\n The International Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment, held in Cairo in 1994, was a landmark \r\nconference. Overcoming deep divisions among \r\nMember States, it succeeded in forging an \r\nunprecedented global consensus and integrated the \r\ndiverse range of population, development and human \r\nrights issues into a blueprint for 20 years of action, \r\npopularly known as the Cairo consensus. \r\n The Programme of Action (see \r\nA/CONF.171/13/Rev.1) addressed the complex \r\ninterrelationships among population, economic growth \r\nand sustainable development, as well as population \r\ndistribution, gender equality and the empowerment of \r\nwomen, urbanization, migration, data collection and \r\nanalysis. For the first time, population and \r\ndevelopment issues were dealt with in a holistic \r\nmanner and individual human beings were placed at \r\nthe very heart of the development process. There was a \r\nsubstantive effort to clarify the concept of reproductive \r\nrights and the Programme also emphasized the \r\ncentrality of reproductive health. It also acknowledged \r\nthe central role of women and young people in the \r\ndevelopment process. \r\n In my own country, this led to a shift in the \r\nGovernment’s approach towards population \r\nstabilization from being target-based to being one \r\nbased on making informed and voluntary choices. The \r\nCairo consensus provided much of the groundwork for \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which \r\nhave now become the benchmark indicators for \r\nsocio-economic development. \r\n I would like to pay tribute today to two women \r\nleaders of the United Nations system, who have also \r\nbeen friends and close colleagues of mine: Ms. Nafis \r\nSadik of Pakistan, Secretary-General of the Cairo \r\nConference and a long-serving and effective leader of \r\nthe United Nations Population Fund, and Ms. Thoraya \r\nObaid of Saudi Arabia, Ms. Sadik’s dynamic and \r\ndedicated successor. Their work in promoting the rights \r\nof women remains indispensable to the future of our \r\nplanet. India is proud to applaud and support their \r\nefforts. \r\n Today’s event offers us an invaluable opportunity \r\nto comprehensively review the progress made so far \r\nand analyse the challenges that lie ahead. The \r\nstatements of the Secretary-General and the President \r\nof the General Assembly have underscored the critical \r\nimportance of realizing the vision set out 15 years ago. \r\nA review would indicate that the global achievements \r\nhave been mixed at best. There have been slippages \r\ninternationally as well as in many countries, including \r\nmy own. It is a matter of regret that, globally, we are \r\nstill far from realizing the goal of universal primary \r\neducation; infant and child mortality and maternal \r\nmortality rates continue to remain high; and access to \r\nuniversal reproductive health is still distant in many \r\nparts of the world. \r\n Nevertheless, it is my firm belief that these goals \r\nare still achievable. Resolute political will and \r\nconcerted global action are needed to realize these \r\ngoals. The benchmarks set by the ICPD continue to \r\nhighlight the onerous task ahead for all of us. \r\n India has been making a steady progress towards \r\nrealizing the vision of the ICPD and the attainment of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. Despite the global \r\neconomic slowdown, the Government of India has \r\naccorded very high priority to the education and health \r\n A/64/PV.17\r\n \r\n17 09-55404 \r\n \r\nsectors, and has enhanced allocation by 19 per cent to \r\nthe social sector during the current financial year. \r\n The National Rural Health Mission (NRHM), \r\nlaunched in 2005, is one of the biggest interventions of \r\nits kind in the health sector in the world. The NRHM \r\nseeks to significantly upgrade effective health care \r\nthroughout India, covering over 600 million people. It \r\naims to improve the access of rural people, especially \r\npoor women and children, to equitable, affordable, \r\naccountable and effective primary health care. \r\n The reproductive and child health programme is \r\none of the main components of the NRHM, and \r\nincludes the ambitious programme of Janani Surakksa \r\nYojana, a safe-motherhood intervention to promote \r\ninstitutional delivery with specific focus on poor \r\npregnant women. So far, this Programme has benefited \r\nmore than 10 million women and has emerged as a \r\nmajor successful intervention in reducing maternal and \r\ninfant mortality. As Ms. Obaid reminded us, no woman \r\nshould die giving life.  \r\n In statistical terms, India’s infant mortality rate is \r\n55 per 1,000 live births. The maternal mortality ratio \r\ndeclined from 301 in the period 2001-2003 to 254 in \r\nthe period 2004-2006. These are areas that require \r\nmajor attention on our part, and our Government is \r\nseized of the problem. As regards the incidence of \r\nHIV/AIDS, it remains under 1 per cent and is showing \r\nsigns of reaching a plateau. \r\n India’s family planning programme is one of the \r\noldest in the world. It is based on the voluntary and \r\ninformed choice and consent of citizens in availing \r\nthemselves of reproductive health-care services. The \r\nprogramme aims at achieving population stabilization \r\nby addressing unmet needs through decentralized \r\nplanning and programme implementation. At primary \r\nhealth-care institutions, there has been an integration \r\nof the HIV/AIDS programme with reproductive health \r\ncare.  \r\n India’s eleventh plan recognizes that the \r\ndevelopment of children is at the centre of the plan. \r\nThis abiding policy commitment to an integrated \r\napproach to enhancing young child survival, growth, \r\ndevelopment and early learning is being translated into \r\naction through the Integrated Child Development \r\nServices Universalization with Quality initiative. The \r\nIntegrated Child Development Services is today the \r\nworld’s largest early childhood development \r\nprogramme, reaching out to over 78 million young \r\nchildren and pregnant and lactating mothers. There is \r\nadded emphasis on convergence of services under \r\nvarious schemes and programmes, including health, \r\nearly childhood education and safe drinking water, so \r\nas to achieve the desired impact.  \r\n India has also embarked on ambitious \r\nprogrammes for human resource development. The \r\nSarva Siksha Abhiyan — “Education for All” — \r\ncampaign, launched in the year 2000, is a major \r\nnational intervention towards achieving universal \r\nprimary education and allowing us to reap the benefits \r\nof a demographic dividend from a young population. \r\nThis year, the Government of India has brought into \r\nforce the Right to Education Act. The Act aims to \r\nguarantee to each child, up to the age of 14, the right to \r\neducation. The Government has also launched a female \r\nliteracy mission this year with the aim of reducing \r\nfemale illiteracy by half in the next three years.  \r\n Gender equity and empowerment have been \r\nguiding principles in the development policies of the \r\nGovernment of India. India’s planning process is fully \r\ncommitted to enabling women to be equal partners in \r\ndevelopment. Gender budgeting has been introduced \r\nacross all sectors.  \r\n We have also moved on empowering women in \r\nthe area of governance and decision-making. The \r\nseventy-third and seventy-fourth constitutional \r\namendments introduced the provision of one-third \r\nreservation of seats for women in local self-\r\ngovernment institutions in India. We now have the \r\ndistinction of having the largest number of women \r\nrepresentatives in local Government in the world and \r\nsome three million of them hold elected office in my \r\ncountry. \r\n In these difficult times, when the world is still \r\ngrappling with the adverse effects of an unprecedented \r\nglobal economic and financial crisis, developing \r\ncountries, where the crisis did not originate, have been \r\nthe most affected. This threatens to undermine and \r\neven reverse the gains made so far in their arduous \r\njourney of development. Therefore, the need for donors \r\nto honour their pledges and the international \r\ncommunity to keep up the stimulus and other efforts to \r\nspur the economies of developing countries cannot be \r\noveremphasized.  \r\n The Government of India remains firmly \r\ncommitted to realizing the vision set out in Cairo 15 \r\nyears ago and to fulfilling the MDGs by 2015. While \r\nA/64/PV.17  \r\n \r\n09-55404 18 \r\n \r\nwe shall certainly do all that we can domestically and \r\nwithin our capacities with our partners in the South, it \r\nis imperative that the international community meet its \r\ncommitments in the global partnership that is critical \r\nfor a better quality of life for all of us on our shared \r\nplanet.  \r\n The President: I call on Mr. Joakim Stymne, \r\nState Secretary of Sweden. \r\n Mr. Stymne (Sweden): On behalf of the \r\nEuropean Union (EU), I am honoured to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly on the commemoration of the \r\nfifteenth anniversary of the International Conference \r\non Population and Development (ICPD). The following \r\ncountries align themselves with this statement: Turkey, \r\nCroatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, \r\nAlbania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Serbia, \r\nIceland, Ukraine, Armenia and Georgia. \r\n The International Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment, held in Cairo in 1994, was a \r\ngroundbreaking event, placing the individual at the \r\ncore of population and development issues. It helped us \r\nto understand better how States and all of us, as women \r\nand men, must reach out to each other and work \r\ntogether to promote sustainable development, human \r\nrights, gender equality and the empowerment of \r\nwomen. We moved away from a focus on the number \r\nof people to focus on human rights, and we laid the \r\ngroundwork for a new global consensus on population \r\nand development. \r\n Over the past 15 years, progress has been made in \r\nmoving the Cairo agenda forward. Universal access to \r\nreproductive health has become part of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). Infant and child \r\nmortality have declined. More girls can attend school; \r\nmore women and couples have access to means to plan \r\ntheir families, space pregnancies and limit the number \r\nof children if they so wish; and the response to HIV \r\nand AIDS has been expanded and strengthened. Many \r\ncountries have endorsed national policies, laws and \r\nprogrammes to improve women’s health and their \r\nenjoyment of human rights, and have embraced the \r\nrecommendations of the ICPD. Governments have \r\nrecognized the importance of population data and \r\nanalysis as a basis for development strategies, policies \r\nand programmes. \r\n Despite the progress made, we still face many \r\nchallenges. The effects of the global financial and \r\neconomic downturn are being felt in many parts of the \r\nworld. Poverty is still one of our most serious \r\nconcerns, and more than 1 billion people still suffer \r\nfrom hunger, 884 million people lack access to safe \r\ndrinking water, and over 2.5 billion people lack access \r\nto basic sanitation. Climate change impacts, from \r\nrising sea levels to drought and other weather-related \r\ndisasters, are affecting our living conditions, including \r\nmigration movements. Education is a key factor in \r\nsustainable development, and universal access to \r\neducation, as outlined in the Programme of Action (see \r\nA/CONF.171/13/Rev.1), is fundamental to the \r\nachievement of internationally agreed development \r\ngoals, including the MDGs. \r\n It is of global concern that the crises have \r\naggravated the already severe conditions for the \r\npoorest, including social infrastructure. There is no \r\ndoubt that the current situation has reversed recent \r\ngains. It is alarming that many families that were \r\nmoving out of poverty are being plunged back into it \r\nagain despite their own best efforts. Among those \r\nparticularly affected are women, young people and \r\ngroups that were already in vulnerable situations, \r\nmarginalized and disadvantaged in terms of power. \r\nGirls are the first to be pulled out of school when \r\nresources are lacking. \r\n International migration is a vital part of today’s \r\nglobalized existence. Global communications and \r\ntransportation have made it possible for people to \r\nenjoy more freedom of movement than ever before. \r\nThere are clear linkages between migration and \r\ndevelopment. Remittances are one example of the \r\nbenefits of migration for the migrant’s country of \r\norigin. Remittances increase the diversity of family \r\nincome sources, help to ensure against risks, make \r\ninvestments in education and health possible, and \r\nprovide a source of capital for the establishment of \r\nsmall enterprises in developing countries. However, \r\nwith today’s financial and economic downturn, that \r\nsource of income for many poor people around the \r\nworld is threatened. \r\n The EU is committed to promoting the positive \r\nsynergies between migration and development. The \r\naim of the EU’s Global Approach to Migration, \r\nadopted in 2005, is to increase coherence among \r\nvarious policy areas in order to realize the potential of \r\nhuman mobility. The three pillars of the Global \r\nApproach — promoting mobility and legal migration, \r\noptimizing the link between migration and \r\ndevelopment, and combating irregular immigration — \r\n A/64/PV.17\r\n \r\n19 09-55404 \r\n \r\nmust all be pursued in a coherent manner. The Global \r\nApproach, as well as the European Pact on \r\nImmigration and Asylum, adopted in July 2008, will be \r\nimplemented in true partnership with countries of \r\norigin, transit and destination. \r\n International dialogue on migration and \r\ndevelopment has deepened in recent years. After the \r\nUnited Nations High-level Dialogue on International \r\nMigration and Development in 2006, international \r\ndialogue has continued in the Global Forum on \r\nMigration and Development. The first meeting of the \r\nState-led, informal and voluntary Global Forum was \r\nheld in Brussels in 2007 and the second in Manila in \r\n2008. The third meeting will take place in Athens from \r\n4 to 5 November this year. \r\n Migration is, among other factors, a significant \r\ncontribution to urbanization as people move in search \r\nof social and economic opportunities. The proportion \r\nof people living in urban areas will continue to \r\nincrease in the future. That population shift poses new \r\nsocio-economic challenges to developing countries. \r\nRapid urban growth strains the capacity of local and \r\nnational Governments to provide basic services, such \r\nas health care, education, water, electricity and sewage. \r\nDevelopment policies are more effective when \r\ncountries include population dynamics, such as \r\nurbanization, in their planning and decision-making. \r\n Women all over the world demand change and \r\ninsist on opportunities to improve their own situations \r\nand the well-being of their families. However, \r\nwomen’s political participation and access to decision-\r\nmaking processes are still restricted and women \r\ncontinue to be discriminated against in law and in \r\npractice in many parts of the world. Progress in that \r\nregard has been too slow. The European Union \r\nwelcomes the strengthening of the United Nations \r\ncapacity to promote gender equality and women’s \r\nempowerment. Resolution 63/311, establishing a new \r\ngender entity, is an important step towards the \r\nrealization of the United Nations obligations to women \r\naround the world. \r\n Violence against women and girls, including \r\nsexual violence, is a major obstacle to the achievement \r\nof the objectives of equality, development, peace and \r\nsecurity. In that connection, we urge that every effort \r\nbe made to intensify the implementation of Security \r\nCouncil resolutions 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008) in \r\norder to ensure compliance with international law, the \r\neffectiveness of conflict resolution, human security, \r\npeacebuilding and the fight against impunity for \r\nperpetrators.  \r\n The EU and its member States have taken \r\nimportant steps to address such violence, including \r\nplans of action to implement resolutions 1325 (2000) \r\nand 1820 (2008), and we welcome the newly adopted \r\nresolution 1888 (2009) and the important steps to be \r\ntaken under resolution 1889 (2009) on women and \r\npeace and security, which further set the agenda for \r\nnext year. \r\n The ICPD Programme of Action and the Beijing \r\nPlatform for Action (see A/CONF.177/20/Rev.1) \r\ntogether paved the way for a progressive and forward-\r\nlooking approach to gender equality, recognizing the \r\nimportance of women’s empowerment and that \r\nwomen’s rights are human rights. Men and boys must \r\nbecome fully involved in policy and programme \r\ndevelopment aiming to improve the equal sharing of \r\nresponsibilities with women and girls so as to foster \r\nchanges in attitudes and behaviour patterns in order to \r\npromote and protect the human rights of women and \r\nthe girl child. The Programme of Action highlights the \r\nimportance of improving communication between \r\nwomen and men on issues of sexuality and \r\nreproductive health and the understanding of their joint \r\nresponsibility. \r\n There is one thing that bears repeating over and \r\nover again. On the fifteenth anniversary of the adoption \r\nof the ICPD Programme of Action, the EU reaffirms its \r\nstrong support for and commitment to the Programme’s \r\nfull implementation, as well as for the key actions for \r\nits further implementation agreed at the Five-Year \r\nReview and Appraisal of the ICPD, and in the \r\nCopenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action for \r\nSocial Development (see A/CONF.166/9). \r\n The EU also emphasizes that gender equality \r\ncannot be achieved without guaranteeing women’s \r\nsexual and reproductive health and rights, and \r\nreaffirms that expanding access to sexual and \r\nreproductive health information and health services is \r\nessential to achieving the Beijing Platform for Action, \r\nthe Cairo Programme of Action and the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. \r\n In the countdown to 2015 — with only five years \r\nremaining — the European Union will accelerate \r\naction to guarantee universal access to reproductive \r\nhealth and ensure reproductive health commodity \r\nA/64/PV.17  \r\n \r\n09-55404 20 \r\n \r\nsecurity. We will continue to work closely with the \r\nUnited Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), \r\nGovernments, civil society and other partners to \r\npromote sexual and reproductive health and rights, as \r\nwell as women’s empowerment and gender equality, \r\nwith the aim of achieving the goals set out at relevant \r\ninternational conferences, including the ICPD. \r\n The EU commends the United Nations system — \r\nand in particular UNFPA — on its successful efforts to \r\nimplement a holistic approach, as established in the \r\nProgramme of Action. The EU recognizes that the right \r\nto attain the highest standard of health, including \r\nsexual and reproductive health, is a basis for action. \r\nThe incorporation of the ICPD agenda into national \r\ndevelopment strategies — especially in national health \r\npolicies, strategies, programmes and budgets — is a \r\nprerequisite for achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. \r\n This approach is particularly important in view of \r\nthe fact that, every year, more than half a million \r\nwomen die from causes related to pregnancy and \r\nchildbirth and that little progress has been made over \r\nthe past 15 years. Most maternal deaths occur in \r\nsub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. A woman’s \r\nlifetime risk of maternal death in sub-Saharan Africa is \r\n1 in 22, while in developed countries the risk is less \r\nthan 1 in 6,000. According to the United Nations, \r\n13 per cent of maternal deaths at the global level are \r\ndue to unsafe abortions and in parts of sub-Saharan \r\nAfrica the figure is 30 to 40 per cent. That means we \r\nare far from achieving MDG 5 and its targets.  \r\n The causes of maternal mortality are well known, \r\nand in the vast majority of cases they are preventable. \r\nWith over 99 per cent of maternal deaths occurring in \r\ndeveloping countries, there is an urgent need to address \r\nthe largest health inequity of our time. We cannot \r\naddress the issue of maternal mortality unless we adopt \r\na multisectoral approach to protecting the rights of \r\nwomen and girls and take urgent action to strengthen \r\nnational health systems.  \r\n The close connection between health, economic \r\nand social well-being is well documented. Disease and \r\nill-health weaken the poor by diminishing their \r\npersonal capacity and their ability to contribute to their \r\nhouseholds, resulting in lost incomes and lower \r\nproductivity. \r\n HIV and AIDS continue to pose a threat to \r\ndevelopment and the well-being of individuals. Most \r\nnew HIV infections are spread through unsafe sex. \r\nThere is therefore a need to integrate HIV and AIDS \r\nand sexual and reproductive health and rights into \r\npolicies and programmes at the local, regional and \r\ninternational levels. Comprehensive sexuality \r\neducation and access to youth-friendly health services, \r\naffordable and high quality male and female condoms, \r\nand other forms of prevention and contraceptives must \r\nbe part of our response in fighting HIV and AIDS. \r\nSpecial attention to the roles and responsibilities of \r\nmen is needed. \r\n Over the years, we have learned that, in order to \r\nadvance the implementation and achievement of the \r\ngoals of the ICPD Programme of Action, countries and \r\ncommunities must feel ownership and protect the \r\nagenda. We cannot stress enough the importance of \r\ninvolving Governments, communities, civil society \r\norganizations and civil society as a whole. More \r\nimportantly, however, women, men, girls and boys \r\nmust be fully involved in efforts that address their \r\nspecific situations and challenges. \r\n UNFPA has spearheaded this process by \r\nexploring different ways to promote gender equality \r\nand human rights so that they are internalized and \r\nunderstood at the community level and by individuals. \r\nChange comes from within. Sufficient financial \r\nresources, both domestic and international, are vital to \r\nachieving the goals set in Cairo. Despite the current \r\neconomic and financial crisis, the international \r\ncommunity must honour the internationally agreed \r\ntargets for the delivery of official development \r\nassistance. \r\n Mr. Christian (Ghana), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n Equally important, however, is political will. \r\nGiving people the freedom and opportunities they need \r\nto grow, to take responsibility, to make informed \r\nchoices and to fulfil their dreams is the overall \r\nobjective of the ICPD and our common task. It is not a \r\nquestion of numbers, but something much more \r\nimportant: the rights, well-being and development of \r\neach and every individual. That is how we can achieve \r\nsustainable human development. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on Her \r\nExcellency The Honourable Haja Afsatou Olayinka \r\nKabba, Minister of Fisheries and Marine Resources of \r\nSierra Leone. \r\n A/64/PV.17\r\n \r\n21 09-55404 \r\n \r\n Ms. Kabba (Sierra Leone): Permit me to reiterate \r\nthe sentiments expressed by my President, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Ernest Bai Koroma, on Mr. Treki’s \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-fourth session when he addressed this Assembly \r\nthree weeks ago, and to reassure Mr. Treki of the \r\nsupport of the delegation of Sierra Leone. Let me also \r\nthank him for convening a meeting on this very \r\nimportant agenda item. My delegation fully associates \r\nitself with the statement to be delivered by the \r\nPermanent Representative of the Sudan on behalf of \r\nthe Group of 77 and China. \r\n I would also like to pay tribute to the Executive \r\nDirector of the United Nations Population Fund \r\n(UNFPA), Ms. Thoraya Ahmed Obaid, for the direction \r\nshe has been giving to this process.  \r\n I feel highly honoured to address the Assembly as \r\nwe join others all around the world in celebrating the \r\nfifteenth anniversary of the International Conference \r\non Population and Development (ICPD). I also wish to \r\nrecall that Sierra Leone was fully represented at that \r\nmeeting and was a signatory to the Programme of \r\nAction (see A/CONF.171/13/Rev.1) that emanated from \r\nit. \r\n We are fully aware that the Programme of Action \r\nrecognizes the right to development, education, health \r\ncare — including sexual and reproductive health — the \r\nempowerment of women and gender equality as \r\ndecisive factors needed to facilitate development and \r\nreduce poverty. The right to decide freely on the \r\nnumber and spacing of children was reaffirmed as a \r\nfundamental right of individuals and couples. \r\n It is now a recognized fact that the ICPD was \r\nremarkable in many ways. In the first place, it was able \r\nto gather consensus among the nations of the world on \r\nmany complex development issues facing our world \r\ntoday. In the second place, it established a clear \r\nunderstanding of the interrelationships between \r\npopulation and development and how we can live in a \r\ndynamic world that will be sustainable not only for us \r\nbut also for our future generations. \r\n Despite the current difficult global economic \r\nsituation, my country, Sierra Leone, has kept itself very \r\nmuch abreast of developments with regard to the ICPD \r\nand its Programme of Action. We have always \r\nmaintained that the ICPD was a watershed that has \r\nthrown new light on the linkages between reproductive \r\nhealth and rights and other aspects of development. \r\n Coming from a post-conflict country in a region \r\nthat is poverty-stricken and characterized by high \r\nmaternal and infant mortality, we fully agree with all \r\nthe principles of the ICPD and share the view that the \r\nideas inherent in them are as relevant today as they \r\nwere valid in 1994. These principles are further \r\nstrengthened through their incorporation into \r\nMillennium Development Goals 3, 5 and 6 and have \r\nenabled the Government to focus on its path to \r\ndevelopment. \r\n In spite of the difficult economic situation in the \r\nworld today and its effect on my country, I must \r\nexpress my Government’s unflinching support for the \r\nUNFPA in assisting our local efforts in implementing \r\nthe ICPD Programme of Action and in reaffirming our \r\ncommitment to all its ideals.  \r\n My Government is now aware that universal \r\naccess to reproductive health care is necessary to \r\nreduce poverty as it increases the possibility of higher \r\ninvestment in human development, sustainable \r\nlivelihoods and food security. Reproductive health \r\nproblems disproportionately affect women — \r\nespecially the poor — and can further impoverish \r\nstruggling families. When women have access to \r\nreproductive health care, including family planning \r\nservices, they are empowered to have smaller, healthier \r\nfamilies and are better able to maintain their own \r\nhealth as well as that of their families. \r\n I must say that, by pursuing the principles of the \r\nICPD, Sierra Leone has made a number of strides since \r\n1994. A National Family Planning Programme was \r\nestablished, and this has now been upgraded to the \r\nReproductive Health Division of the Ministry of Health \r\nand Sanitation. The Government has developed a \r\nreproductive health strategy and a national \r\nreproductive health policy. The reproductive health \r\npolicy is set within the framework of the national \r\nhealth policy of Sierra Leone, which upholds primary \r\nhealth care as a key strategy for delivering health care \r\nin Sierra Leone. This policy recognizes that \r\nreproductive health should be conceived of in the \r\ncontext of primary health care, as stated in the ICPD. A \r\nreproductive health commodity security strategy and \r\ndrug-distribution systems have now been put in place. \r\nThe Government has also recently established a \r\nReproductive and Child Health Directorate to \r\noperationalize that strategy. \r\nA/64/PV.17  \r\n \r\n09-55404 22 \r\n \r\n With the assistance of donors and United Nations \r\nagencies, a number of health facilities have been \r\nupgraded to strengthen the provision of basic and \r\ncomprehensive emergency obstetric care for women. \r\nThe UNFPA has sent a number of doctors, and nurses \r\nhave been sent for training and retraining in specialized \r\nskills within the subregion.  \r\n An innovative approach has been the use of \r\ncommunity motorized ambulances to transport \r\npregnant women from areas where it is difficult to \r\naccess transportation to places where there are \r\nhospitals or other health facilities for them to access \r\nmedical care. Women also undertake fund-raising \r\nfarming activities through gardening. The proceeds \r\nfrom these activities are saved and used to support \r\nwomen during pregnancy and delivery. The \r\nestablishment of health insurance schemes and birth-\r\nwaiting homes and the enforcement of by-laws at the \r\ncommunity level are some of the innovative things that \r\nhave been done in my country. \r\n There is also full involvement on the part of \r\ntraditional and religious leaders, with the leadership of \r\nthe Office of the First Lady, in advocating for a \r\nreduction in maternal mortality. A number of gender \r\nlaws have been passed to empower women, in \r\nparticular with regard to marriage and inheritance. A \r\nnational gender strategic plan has been formulated to \r\nenhance gender empowerment and equity. \r\n At the recent state opening of the third session of \r\nthe third parliament of the Second Republic of Sierra \r\nLeone, on 9 October 2009, His Excellency the \r\nPresident, Mr. Ernest Bai Koroma, outlined the \r\nprogress on Government policies and interventions in \r\nthe health sector. Infant and under-five mortality rates \r\nhave been reduced significantly. Many more Sierra \r\nLeoneans are sleeping under insecticide-treated bed \r\nnets than ever before. Maternal mortality rates have \r\nfallen by a third over the past three years. Blood banks \r\nhave been established in all regions of the country. A \r\nmidwifery school is under construction in the Northern \r\nprovince, and modern medical storage and \r\nmanagement facilities are under construction in the \r\ncapital city and the 12 districts. \r\n The Government is stepping up the fight against \r\nHIV/AIDS and has established 337 sites for the \r\nprevention of mother-to-child transmission, 103 \r\ntreatment centres for people living with HIV and 384 \r\nvolunteer-based confidential and counselling centres.  \r\n His Excellency the President further informed \r\nparliament that the first priority of the Government is \r\nto ensure free access to health care for pregnant women \r\nand children under the age of five. The Government \r\nwill also establish a National Health Commission, \r\nseparate from the civil service, to institute rules and \r\ncodes of conduct, as well as to regulate and improve \r\nthe conditions of service of health workers and the \r\nquality of health-care delivery in general. \r\n Our efforts have not proceeded free from \r\nchallenges. The scarcity of human resources for health \r\ncare — for emergency obstetric care, in particular — \r\nhas been a particular challenge. There has never been a \r\nfull complement of staff in public health units due to \r\nbrain drain in the medical field. The Government \r\nappreciates UNFPA’s contribution in the area of \r\ntraining doctors and nurses. Other donors, such as the \r\nEuropean Union and the United Kingdom Department \r\nfor International Development, are also involved in \r\nupgrading the capacity of staff within the Ministry of \r\nHealth. Access to health facilities is also difficult due \r\nto bad roads. This is contributing to delays leading to \r\nhigh maternal mortality. \r\n The Government’s new targets for reproductive \r\nhealth include, among other things, commitments to \r\nimproving the reproductive health status of women \r\nnationwide by providing more resources, as prioritized \r\nin our second poverty reduction strategy, the agenda \r\nfor change; the development of the Reproductive \r\nHealth Strategic Plan through joint programming with \r\nthe United Nations and other donor partners; post-\r\nconflict rehabilitation of public health units and \r\nmaternity wards in hospitals nationwide, which were \r\ndestroyed during the war; undertaking more capacity-\r\nbuilding activities through training and the provision of \r\nlogistical and material support. \r\n I should like to reiterate my Government’s \r\ncommitment to achieving the goals of the ICPD and the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. While we pledge our \r\nsupport to ensure that we achieve these goals, I would \r\nbe remiss in my duty as an advocate not to appeal to \r\nour benefactors that, without their additional financial \r\nsupport, it will be difficult to ensure that no woman \r\nwill die in giving life. We count on you, and may God \r\nbless you all. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHer Excellency Ms. Naela Gabr, Deputy Minister of \r\nForeign Affairs for Multilateral Affairs of Egypt. \r\n A/64/PV.17\r\n \r\n23 09-55404 \r\n \r\n Ms. Gabr (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I should like to say how gratified we are at the \r\nconvening of these meetings in commemoration of the \r\nfifteenth anniversary of the International Conference \r\non Population and Development, which was held in \r\nCairo in 1994. I wish also to express our appreciation \r\nto the Secretary-General for his inspiring statement on \r\nthis occasion. Furthermore, I wish to express also our \r\nspecial thanks to Ms. Thoraya Obaid, Executive \r\nDirector of the United Nations Population Fund, for \r\nher statement today and for the unflagging assistance \r\nthat the Fund has extended to developing countries in \r\nsupport of their efforts to achieve the goals of the \r\nProgramme of Action of the Cairo Conference (see \r\nA/CONF.171/13/Rev.1). I would also like to associate \r\nmyself with the statement to be made by the \r\nrepresentative of the Sudan on behalf of the Group of \r\n77 and China. \r\n Fifteen years ago, Egypt was pleased to host the \r\nfirst International Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment, reflecting the priority we attach to \r\npopulation issues and their close relation to the \r\ninternational development agenda. In Cairo, the \r\ninternational community reached a consensus that \r\nreflects our peoples’ aspirations towards the \r\nadvancement of population issues at the international \r\nlevel. That consensus was premised on enhancing \r\nsustainable human development and on asserting the \r\nconcept of empowering all members of the family by \r\nstressing education, health care and gender equality, by \r\nproviding every opportunity to achieve sustainable \r\neconomic, social and environmental development and \r\nby working towards the eradication of poverty. \r\n The International Conference in Cairo thus \r\nmarked an historic turning point in reaffirming the \r\ndirect link between population issues, in their many \r\ndiverse forms, and the achievement of development in \r\nits various aspects. The Cairo Programme of Action \r\n(see A/CONF.171/13/Rev.1) and the relevant \r\nrecommendations adopted by the General Assembly in \r\n1999 in resolution 53/183, along with the special \r\noutcomes of other major United Nations conferences, \r\nhave contributed to the formulation of a comprehensive \r\ninternational framework for sustainable development, \r\nin the economic, social and environmental fields. \r\n I think that all those who work in this multilateral \r\nframework sense the significance of what was achieved \r\nin Cairo in thematic, programmatic and intellectual \r\nterms. Therefore, it is imperative to utilize our \r\ncommemoration today — five years before the set date \r\nfor the achievement of the Cairo Conference’s goals \r\nand six years before the target date for the achievement \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) — to \r\nconsider and approve the best means to face the huge \r\nobstacles to achieving those goals. Those obstacles \r\ninclude the global economic and financial crisis and its \r\nimpact on developing countries, the interrelated \r\nchallenges of poverty, armed conflicts and climate \r\nchange and the energy and food security crises. These \r\nand other crises have resulted in additional burdens on \r\ndeveloping countries in the form of dwindling \r\neconomic growth, declining exports and remittance \r\nrevenues, rising unemployment and a steady increase \r\nin the number of those living below the poverty line. \r\nAll of those factors undermine the gains that \r\ndeveloping countries have achieved over the past \r\nseveral years. \r\n From that perspective, Egypt believes that \r\nmaking real progress in achieving the goals of the \r\nProgramme of Action and the internationally agreed \r\ndevelopmental goals depends on the mobilization of \r\nthe necessary political will to face these crises and \r\nchallenges and to overcome the implementation gap in \r\nthe outcomes of major United Nations conferences and \r\ndecisions on economic and social issues. Therefore, we \r\nemphasize that the negative repercussions of the \r\ninternational economic and financial crisis, along with \r\nother crises, should constitute yet another compelling \r\nreason for developed countries to reaffirm their \r\ncommitment to support developing nations’ efforts to \r\nachieve the goals of the Programme of Action and \r\nother internationally agreed development goals, \r\nparticularly the MDGs.  \r\n The situation should also spur renewed \r\ncommitments to support developing countries’ capacity \r\nto mitigate the negative socio-economic effects of \r\nthese crises in family and population matters. \r\nParticularly, adequate resources should be provided to \r\nfund services in family planning, reproductive health \r\nand the prevention of HIV/AIDS and to finance \r\nresearch activities, including the collection and \r\nanalysis of data on population and development \r\npolicies. \r\n Since hosting the International Conference, as \r\npart of Egypt’s growing political commitment to \r\nparticipate actively in international efforts aimed at \r\nachieving development goals, Egypt has played a \r\nleading role in numerous development activities at the \r\nA/64/PV.17  \r\n \r\n09-55404 24 \r\n \r\nregional level, and we have made achieving the goals \r\nof the Programme of Action a high national priority. \r\nThat resolve stems from our belief that achieving those \r\ngoals supports the greater framework of our national \r\nand regional development strategies in the Arab and \r\nAfrican contexts. At the same time, it will strengthen \r\nour regional capacities to implement effectively the \r\noutcomes of all major United Nations conferences in \r\nthe economic and social fields, in our regional efforts \r\nto achieve the internationally agreed development \r\ngoals, including the MDGs. Those efforts are \r\nparticularly important in our fellow African countries, \r\nmany of whose chances to implement the MDGs by the \r\n2015 target remain weak. \r\n In this context, Egypt underscores the nexus \r\nbetween the implementation of the goals of the Cairo \r\nProgramme of Action and the achievement of the \r\nMDGs. From that standpoint, Egypt looks forward to \r\nthe 2010 summit proposed by the Secretary-General to \r\nreview progress made in achieving the MDGs, as that \r\nsummit will present a vital opportunity to intensify our \r\ninternational efforts aimed at achieving those goals and \r\nat formulating a common vision on how to push the \r\ninternational development agenda forward. \r\nUndoubtedly, it should inform our efforts to achieve \r\nthe MDGs and the goals of the Cairo Programme of \r\nAction. \r\n On the national front, the decision taken by Egypt \r\nin 2009 to create a new ministry specifically to deal \r\nwith family and population issues in all their \r\ndimensions, reiterates our firm political commitment to \r\naddress these issues. In addition, numerous policies \r\nand laws have been adopted by the Egyptian \r\nparliament in the past few years, aimed at deepening \r\nour commitment to women’s empowerment, achieving \r\ngender equality, improving the human rights situation \r\nand reducing maternal and child mortality rates. Egypt \r\nhas also decided to host the regional office of the \r\nUnited Nations Population Fund in Cairo, which we \r\nhope will become operational soon so as to \r\ncomplement the work of the Fund’s country office in \r\nsupport of our efforts to implement the goals of the \r\nCairo Programme of Action. \r\n As we celebrate the fifteenth anniversary of the \r\nCairo Conference on Population and Development, I \r\nwould like to express Egypt’s continued concern over \r\nthe suffering of the Palestinian people under \r\noccupation, and to underline the negative repercussions \r\nof this situation for the achievement of internationally \r\nagreed development goals, particularly those of the \r\nCairo Programme of Action. The continuation of this \r\nsituation undermines the efforts of the Palestinian \r\npeople to achieve their economic and social \r\ndevelopment goals and to establish their independent \r\nState on all the territory occupied by Israel in 1967, \r\nwith East Jerusalem as its capital. In addition, the \r\neffects of Israel’s blockade and closure policies have \r\ndenied the Palestinian people access to their basic \r\nneeds. Moreover, Israel continues the blockade of the \r\nGaza Strip, in defiance of Security Council resolution \r\n1860 (2009), and refuses to enter into any real peace \r\nprocess aimed at fulfilling the interests of the \r\nPalestinian and Israeli peoples in living in peace and \r\nsecurity. \r\n In conclusion, we hope that today’s meeting will \r\nlaunch a serious discussion moving us towards a \r\ncommon understanding of how best to implement our \r\ngoals by 2014, how, in the following phase of \r\ncollective work to preserve what will have been \r\nachieved and how to continually build on those \r\naccomplishments. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Johannes Kyrle, Deputy Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Austria. \r\n Mr. Kyrle (Austria): At the outset, I wish to align \r\nmyself with the declaration made by the Swedish \r\npresidency on behalf of the European Union. \r\nAustria — in its national capacity — would like to add \r\nsome specific comments and reflections on issues that \r\nare particularly relevant to us. This year’s anniversary \r\nof the International Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment (ICPD) reminds us of the five years \r\nremaining to implement the commitments made in \r\nCairo in 1994, where 179 countries for the first time \r\nacknowledged the interdependence between population \r\nissues and development. Also, for the first time, there \r\nwas consensus on a global scale that empowering \r\nwomen and meeting people’s needs with regard to \r\neducation and health, particularly reproductive health, \r\nare necessary, both for individual advancement and for \r\nsustainable and balanced development. \r\n The Programme of Action adopted at the Cairo \r\nConference in 1994 — often referred to as the Cairo \r\nAgenda — established the paramount importance of \r\nadvancing gender equality, equity, empowerment of \r\nwomen, ending violence against women and ensuring \r\nwomen’s ability to control their own fertility for \r\n A/64/PV.17\r\n \r\n25 09-55404 \r\n \r\npopulation and development policies. It centres on \r\nproviding universal education, reducing infant, child \r\nand maternal mortality, and ensuring universal access \r\nby 2015 to reproductive health care, including family \r\nplanning, assisted childbirth and prevention of sexually \r\ntransmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS. While it \r\nhas provided much of the groundwork for the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), its broad and \r\ncomprehensive vision on development and its \r\nrequirements includes many elements not covered in \r\nthe eight MDGs. In particular, it addresses the complex \r\nrelationship between population, economic growth and \r\nsustainable development, as well as population \r\ndistribution, migration, climate change and \r\nurbanization. \r\n Today’s commemorative session provides an \r\nexcellent opportunity to highlight the international \r\nconsensus on the decisive importance for the \r\ndevelopment process of population dynamics, sexual \r\nand reproductive health rights, gender equality and \r\nwomen’s empowerment, and to take stock of progress \r\nmade and challenges remaining. In this context, Austria \r\nwarmly welcomes the General Assembly’s recent \r\ndecision at its sixty-third session to establish a \r\ncomposite gender entity headed by an Under-Secretary-\r\nGeneral. This will, we believe, significantly enhance \r\nthe capacity, accountability and effectiveness of the \r\nUnited Nations in the area of gender. \r\n In 2005, universal access to reproductive health \r\ncare became one of the targets under MDG 5, \r\nimproving maternal health. Numerous countries have \r\nconsidered the recommendations of the Cairo \r\nConference and have adopted national policies, laws \r\nand programmes to further women’s health and in \r\nparticular to guarantee access to reproductive health \r\ncare. Today, more women in poor countries choose to \r\nuse family planning, more women enjoy the assistance \r\nof skilled attendants at birth, more infants survive and \r\nmore girls are going to school, undeniably a gratifying \r\ntestimonial of progress. \r\n Yet the progress achieved so far is not sufficient, \r\nand the Cairo Agenda remains as relevant as ever: a \r\nbillion people still live in absolute poverty, and every \r\nyear, more than half a million women die from \r\ncomplications related to pregnancy and childbirth, \r\nwhile 3 million infants die within the first week of life, \r\nmostly of causes related to their mother’s health and to \r\ncomplications during pregnancy and delivery. In this \r\ncontext, the contribution of the United Nations \r\nPopulation Fund (UNFPA) to the achievement of \r\nMDG 5 on improving maternal health is of paramount \r\nimportance. Universal access to reproductive health \r\nand safe motherhood must become fundamental rights \r\nworldwide. \r\n Every man, woman and child must have the same \r\nopportunity to lead a healthy life without \r\ndiscrimination. More needs to be done to fully \r\nimplement this principle in our common response in \r\nthe fight against HIV and AIDS. Many of those most in \r\nneed of prevention, treatment and care services still \r\nface discrimination, marginalization and even \r\ncriminalization. We are especially worried by the \r\nincreasing feminization of HIV/AIDS, with more \r\nwomen and girls becoming infected. In order to reverse \r\nthis alarming trend we need to step up our efforts to \r\nguarantee women’s and girls’ access to information and \r\nservices for sexual and reproductive health and rights. \r\n Austria will continue to support international \r\nefforts to fight HIV and AIDS and is very proud to be \r\nhosting the XVIII International AIDS Conference in \r\nVienna in July 2010, organized in cooperation with the \r\nJoint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS and \r\nother partners. The Conference brings together all \r\nrelevant stakeholders, representatives of Governments, \r\nUnited Nations agencies, civil society and academia, to \r\nevaluate progress and further discuss future priorities. \r\nA total of 25,000 participants and 6,000 journalists are \r\nexpected in Vienna on this occasion. Austria very much \r\nhopes that the Conference will contribute to progress \r\ntowards our common goal and in our global fight \r\nagainst HIV and AIDS. \r\n Austria is deeply concerned about the high level \r\nof gender-based violence worldwide, in particular \r\nsexual violence against women and children in armed \r\nconflict. Every day, worldwide, hundreds of women, \r\ngirls and children are systematically violated and \r\nsexually abused in conflict settings. The flagrant use of \r\nsexual violence as a deliberate means of warfare \r\nconstitutes a major threat to international peace and \r\nsecurity that must end immediately. States and other \r\nparties to conflict must observe their international legal \r\nobligations, while the international community must \r\nstand ready to prevent violence, protect individuals, \r\nend impunity and redress victims. \r\n Lasting peace, reconciliation and sustainable \r\ndevelopment are impossible without the active \r\ncontribution of women to peacebuilding and conflict \r\nA/64/PV.17  \r\n \r\n09-55404 26 \r\n \r\nprevention. Women can make an important \r\ncontribution to all peace processes, particularly to \r\nnegotiations and mediation, as well as to post-conflict \r\ngovernance and reconstruction. In this regard, Security \r\nCouncil resolutions 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008) have \r\nunderlined the need to include women in peacebuilding \r\nand peacekeeping measures. Austria actively and \r\nfirmly supported and co-sponsored Security Council \r\nresolution 1888 (2009) on women and children in \r\narmed conflict, which was unanimously adopted by the \r\nCouncil on 30 September 2009. Apart from fighting \r\nsexual violence effectively, we want to give victims of \r\nsexual violence in conflict situations a voice, improved \r\nprotection and better medical and psychological care. \r\nMoreover, we will actively contribute to making next \r\nyear’s commemoration of the tenth anniversary of \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1325 (2000) a success and \r\nto generating renewed and revitalized momentum \r\ntowards its full implementation. \r\n Austria commends UNFPA for the important role \r\nit plays in working to end all forms of violence against \r\nwomen, including harmful practices. Austria therefore \r\nsupports the Fund’s work by contributing financially, \r\ninter alia, to the Task Force on Violence against \r\nWomen and the United Nations campaign to eliminate \r\nfemale genital mutilation by 2015. \r\n Donor and partner countries alike have been \r\nseverely hit by the recent economic and financial \r\ncrisis, putting adequate funding for the implementation \r\nof the Programme of Action at risk. Let us use this \r\nopportunity to renew our commitment to the Cairo \r\nAgenda, assess progress, identify remaining challenges \r\nand give fresh impetus for the next five years to \r\nsuccessfully implement the Programme of Action by its \r\ntarget date. \r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
