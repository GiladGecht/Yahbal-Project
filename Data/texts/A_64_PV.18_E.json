(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) \r\n \r\n \r\n In the absence of the President, Ms. Štiglic \r\n(Slovenia), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 48 (continued) \r\n \r\nIntegrated and coordinated implementation of and \r\nfollow-up to the outcomes of the major United \r\nNations conferences and summits in the economic, \r\nsocial and related fields \r\n \r\n  Commemoration of the fifteenth anniversary  \r\nof the International Conference on Population \r\nand Development \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHer Excellency Ms. Mara Brawer, Under-Secretary for \r\nEquality and Quality of Education of Argentina. \r\n Ms. Brawer (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): At \r\nthe outset, I would like to convey to the Assembly the \r\ngreetings of our President, Cristina Fernández de \r\nKirchner. Argentina is very happy to join in this \r\ngathering as we commemorate the fifteenth anniversary \r\nof the International Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment, which offers an important opportunity to \r\nassess the progress that has been made and to revitalize \r\nour efforts to achieve the goals agreed at Cairo with a \r\nview to facilitating the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). \r\n Our country firmly supports the Programme of \r\nAction (see A/CONF.171/13/Rev.1) of the International \r\nConference on Population and Development, which \r\nclearly reflects the close links among population, \r\npoverty, health, education, models of production and \r\nconsumption, and the environment. \r\n The profound international financial crisis, \r\ncoming half-way to the deadline for achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, seriously jeopardizes \r\nour ability to achieve the Goals. Until 2008, significant \r\nprogress had been made at the global level in the \r\nreduction of poverty and the eradication of hunger, as \r\nwell as in relation to the commitments made in the area of \r\neducation. However, the international economic crisis has \r\nput the brakes on these significant achievements, and \r\ntoday international organizations consider it unlikely \r\nthat we will be able to achieve the commitments linked \r\nto the Millennium Development Goals. \r\n In the case of Argentina, it is fortunate that our \r\ncountry is enjoying its lowest degree of economic and \r\nfinancial vulnerability in recent decades. The growth in \r\nArgentina’s economy in recent years has enabled the \r\nArgentine Government to increase the resources \r\nallocated to social policy. This is the case because \r\nArgentina promotes a socio-economic model that seeks \r\nto redress social inequalities and to promote inclusion \r\nand social progress by creating opportunities that \r\nguarantee equal access to education, health care, \r\nhousing and decent work, which promotes production \r\ncommensurate with the increased purchasing power of \r\nthe majority of the population. \r\n As we understand it, economic growth must be \r\nguided by the political will to create quality \r\nemployment. The rule of democracy and the \r\nA/64/PV.18  \r\n \r\n09-55501 2 \r\n \r\neradication of poverty are sustained by decent work, as \r\nevidenced by the fact that Argentina was one of the \r\nfirst countries to identify decent work as a factor of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. The Argentine \r\nexperience indicates that when job creation is made the \r\ncentral strategy of poverty reduction, it is possible to \r\nachieve highly satisfactory results in the attempt to \r\nmeet the other Millennium Development Goals.  \r\n Argentina considers education to be a national \r\npriority and a State policy. We see education as being a \r\npublic good, a fundamental right and a joint responsibility \r\nof society as a whole. The principle of equality \r\nrecognized by our National Education Law is a key pillar \r\nof the search for a just and democratic society. \r\n When the Millennium Development Goal of \r\nachieving universal primary education by 2015 was set, \r\nArgentina came very close to achieving it very quickly, \r\nand continues to make progress in this area, having \r\nadded the goal of universal secondary education. \r\nSimilarly, convinced that the efforts of society and \r\npublic policy must be centred on the human being if we \r\nwish to improve the quality of life of peoples, reduce \r\npoverty and social exclusion, and ensure equal \r\nopportunity and the development of individuals and \r\ncommunities, Argentina believes health to be a human \r\nright essential to development. \r\n It is the responsibility and a duty of the State to \r\nimplement health-care systems and policies to that end. \r\nIn that respect, my country understands that health \r\nmust take precedence over economic interests. Health \r\ndetermines the development and growth of a nation, \r\nand that is why we consider health care to be an \r\ninvestment, not an expense, and a responsibility of the \r\nState and society as a whole. \r\n The problems of health go beyond national and \r\njurisdictional borders. We must therefore address, on \r\nthe one hand, situations relating to such long-standing \r\nproblems as poverty and social exclusion that remain \r\nunresolved, and, on the other, new problems related to \r\nthe environment, increased longevity, new modes of \r\nliving, new diseases or the re-emergence of old \r\npathologies. Argentina is therefore convinced that if we \r\nwish to ensure equitable health care, we must ensure \r\nuniversal and comprehensive coverage in the provision \r\nof essential services and benefits for all peoples of the \r\nworld, bearing in mind the variables of culture, gender, \r\nethnicity, sexual orientation and personal capacities. \r\n In this framework, my country believes it \r\nnecessary to guarantee comprehensive sex education at \r\nall educational levels and modalities. We approach \r\ncomprehensive sex education in a way that stresses a \r\nholistic concept of sexuality and the promotion of \r\nhealth. This approach is integrated into a strategy for \r\nimproving the individual quality of life and creating \r\nconditions conducive to the exercise of human rights in \r\ngeneral, and sexual and reproductive rights in \r\nparticular. We also believe that comprehensive sex \r\neducation helps to equate gender equality with the \r\nrejection of all forms of discrimination, to re-evaluate \r\neducational subject matter, and to strengthen \r\nintergenerational ties based on trust and respect, \r\nthereby promoting quality education. \r\n Issues related to reproductive rights and universal \r\naccess to reproductive health care are among the major \r\npriorities of our Government, as reflected in our laws \r\nand our implementation of various measures in this \r\narea at the national and provincial levels. One of the \r\nmost important outcomes of our endeavours is the \r\nSexual Health and Responsible Procreation Law \r\nenacted in 2002, creating a national programme for \r\nsexual health and responsible procreation with a view \r\nto providing and facilitating universal access to sexual \r\nand reproductive health services. \r\n In Argentina, the percentage of live births \r\nassisted by doctors or midwives in 2007 was \r\napproximately 99 per cent, reflecting Argentina’s \r\ncommitment to universal access to health care. \r\nMoreover, we reduced maternal mortality by 15.4 per \r\ncent from 1999 to 2007. Although that reduction is \r\nsignificant, further reducing the rate is a challenge that \r\nArgentina has accepted with increasing and ongoing \r\nvigour. It is also important to note that, as a result of \r\nthe Government’s initiatives aimed essentially at \r\nimproving prevention of childhood illness and \r\npaediatric care, we were able to reduce infant mortality \r\nby 48.2 per cent from 1990 to 2007. I also wish to \r\npoint out that the trends seen in infant and under-five \r\nmortality rates suggest that we will be able to achieve \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals by 2015. \r\n Argentina’s efforts to meet these goals are also \r\nreflected in our fight against disease. In that context, \r\nhaving seen annual increases throughout the 1990s in \r\ncases of HIV/AIDS, calculated per million inhabitants, \r\nfrom 2002 we were able to reverse the trend and are now \r\nbeginning to see a clear drop in the rate of infection. In \r\nthat context, it is important to note that in 2007, this \r\n A/64/PV.18\r\n \r\n3 09-55501 \r\n \r\nparticular indicator — 36.5 cases of HIV infection \r\nper million inhabitants — was below the goal of 37 cases \r\nper million inhabitants proposed for 2015. With regard to \r\ncondom use in casual sexual encounters among young \r\npeople 15 to 24 years of age, Argentina is meeting the \r\n2015 goal of 75 per cent. As Argentina’s current rate is \r\n85 per cent, we have surpassed the goal by 10 per cent. \r\n Our country has integrated gender-mainstreaming \r\ninto all public policy and created specific institutional \r\nmechanisms to that end. In that respect, we would \r\npoint to the so-called Quotas Law, which in 1991 \r\nincreased the number of women in elected posts in the \r\ncountry. Women must now occupy a minimum of \r\n33 per cent of all elected positions in our country. \r\n Furthermore, women’s empowerment requires a \r\nlife free of violence against women and the recognition \r\nthat gender violence is a violation of their human rights \r\nand the direct or indirect violation of many other rights \r\nenshrined in international treaties and agreements. In \r\nthat connection, in March 2009 a comprehensive \r\nprotection law was enacted to prevent, punish and \r\neradicate all forms of violence against women in areas \r\nwhere they interact with others. Complementary to that \r\nlaw, a campaign was launched under the theme \r\n“Another life is possible. We have the right to a life \r\nwithout violence”. The campaign is being carried out \r\nby the Ministry of Education, with the participation of \r\nmany other State bodies and international and civil \r\nsociety organizations. \r\n I also wish to recall that Argentina has stated that \r\nachieving the MDGs will be possible if they are \r\nimplemented within the framework of a national \r\ndevelopment policy and in an international context \r\nwhere the more developed countries assume the \r\nresponsibility to reverse negative trends marked by \r\nincreasing inequality and exclusion and decreasing \r\nflows of cooperation aid. \r\n To conclude, Argentina, through me, wishes to \r\nreaffirm its commitment to the Cairo Programme of \r\nAction and to the key steps to implement it. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on Her \r\nExcellency Mrs. Ritva Koukku-Ronde, Under-\r\nSecretary of State of Finland. \r\n Mrs. Koukku-Ronde (Finland): I thank you, \r\nMadam President, for giving me the opportunity to \r\naddress the General Assembly. It is a great honour for \r\nme to be present at this event. In addition to the \r\ncommon statement of the European Union, Finland \r\nwould like to address a few additional items. \r\n The Programme of Action (see A/CONF.171/13/ \r\nRev.1) of the International Conference on Population \r\nand Development (ICPD) set forth a broad agenda that is \r\nstill very relevant. I would like to focus on the parts of \r\nthe Programme that relate to population issues. \r\n It is now clearer than ever before that population \r\nissues are closely linked to poverty and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Poverty can be overcome only if \r\ndevelopment is ecologically, environmentally, \r\neconomically and socially sustainable. Demographic \r\ndynamics have a strong influence on all our aspirations \r\nto sustainable futures. Aggregate demand in world \r\nmarkets is the key to overcoming the global economic \r\ncrisis and to achieving economic sustainability. \r\nObviously, poverty reduction among the rapidly \r\ngrowing populations of the South is the most promising \r\nway to increase global demand. \r\n Population growth, associated with unsustainable \r\nproduction and consumption patterns, is threatening \r\npoverty eradication. Furthermore, the cohesion and \r\nstability of societies are threatened as economic \r\nopportunities and service provision are unable to meet \r\nthe demand equitably. How can we generate growth for \r\nall mankind without compromising sustainability? As \r\nthe World Commission on the Social Dimension of \r\nGlobalization of the International Labour Organization \r\nhas concluded, global governance has to be fair and \r\nsustainable. We cannot achieve global consensus in \r\nclimate negotiations unless we demonstrate a serious \r\ninterest not only in saving the planet, but also in \r\nsecuring decent work opportunities and social \r\nprotection for the people of developing countries. \r\n That said, I would like to highlight the links \r\namong population growth, climate change and food \r\nsecurity. Those are issues that no country can tackle \r\nalone. We have a shared responsibility, as we are all \r\naccountable to future generations for our planet’s \r\nsurvival. \r\n The links between climate and population have \r\nbasically two dimensions. On the one hand, the impacts \r\nof climate change, from droughts and floods to \r\ndestabilized livelihoods, are already apparent and being \r\nfelt most by those who are already impoverished. On \r\nthe other hand, uncontrolled population growth will \r\nfurther increase those effects. Most environmental \r\nproblems, including those arising from climate change, \r\nA/64/PV.18  \r\n \r\n09-55501 4 \r\n \r\ntend to be aggravated by population size and growth. \r\nTherefore, the fact that the world’s population has \r\nreached almost 7 billion and continues to grow by \r\nsome 78 million each year is unquestionably relevant. \r\n The demand for food is projected to double by \r\n2030. It is estimated that 20 per cent of that increase is \r\nrelated to population growth. The fastest population \r\ngrowth is taking place in the poorest nations of the \r\nworld, many of which are already facing serious \r\ndifficulty in meeting current food needs. To respond to \r\nfood security in the medium and long terms, we need \r\nto integrate trade and aid policies, as well as to \r\nincrease agricultural production. \r\n At the heart of all this are the individual and the \r\nchoices that she or he makes. Population stabilization \r\nwill occur naturally, not as a matter of coercion, when \r\nindividual women and men have equal rights to make \r\nchoices, access to sexual and reproductive health care, \r\nand security in old age through decent work and social \r\npensions. Access to health care and contraceptives is a \r\nright that belongs to all, and it is crucial for all women, \r\nwed and unwed. \r\n The number of women of reproductive age will \r\nrise dramatically by 2050, and we will have the largest \r\never generation of reproductive age. Maternal mortality \r\nis among the health indicators that show the greatest \r\ngap between the rich and the poor, both among and \r\nwithin countries. There is a huge, unmet need for \r\nfamily planning. The need for services and education \r\nfor young people is therefore dire. \r\n Healthy women mean an increase in both local \r\nand global productivity. They play a central role in \r\npoverty reduction and in creating sustainable \r\ndevelopment, but to focus on women alone is not \r\nenough. We need, as stated at the ICPD, the \r\nconstructive involvement of men. \r\n Sustainable development requires a \r\ncomprehensive approach in which the social, economic \r\nand environmental dimensions of national policies and \r\nglobal governance are developed side by side. That \r\nneeds to happen at both the global and local levels. \r\nGlobal governance is needed, since we are dealing with \r\nproblems without passports, but we must also \r\nrecognize that all nations are responsible for their own \r\ndevelopment. \r\n In the late nineteenth century, Finland had a poor, \r\nagrarian and scattered population. Births took place at \r\nhome with the assistance of lay midwives. Today, the \r\nFinnish maternity and childcare system is unique in the \r\nworld. After the Second World War, legislation was \r\nenacted to guarantee free maternity care for all Finnish \r\nwomen. Nowadays, the service reaches 99 per cent of \r\nall families. Maternity clinics focus on the health and \r\nwell-being of pregnant women and their children. The \r\nprogress of pregnancy is screened regularly and the \r\nclinics provide information on everyday life and proper \r\nnutrition for pregnant women. Men are also included \r\nand strongly encouraged to accompany their partners. \r\nAfter birth, the baby’s health is monitored with regular \r\nvisits to a childcare clinic until she or he attends \r\nschool. \r\n The effects of this system were and are \r\nenormous. After the legislation was enacted in 1944, \r\nFinland’s infant mortality rate was more than halved in \r\n10 years. Since then, the infant mortality rate has been \r\nin steady decline; today, it is one of the lowest in the \r\nworld at 0.26 per cent. \r\n The Cairo Programme of Action and the \r\nMillennium Development Goals complement each \r\nother. The United Nations, along with its specialized \r\nagencies and funds, such as the United Nations \r\nPopulation Fund (UNFPA), is essential to achieving \r\nthese goals. The United Nations system has a central \r\nrole in Finnish development policy, both in terms of \r\nfunding and political significance. UNFPA has a \r\nunique mandate in achieving the rights-based \r\ndevelopment goals related to population development \r\nand reproductive health globally. UNFPA is our valued, \r\nlong-time partner, with which we have worked, for \r\nexample, to improve adolescent sexual and \r\nreproductive health, to reduce maternal mortality and \r\nto ensure reproductive health commodity security. \r\nFinland is among the 10 major donors giving core \r\nsupport to UNFPA. \r\n In conclusion, we should adopt an integrated, \r\nlong-term approach to population issues — one that \r\ntakes into account all aspects, global and individual \r\nalike. We must make sure each individual has access to \r\nmeans, care and information. Success will then be \r\nmirrored at the global level as sustainable population \r\ngrowth. \r\n While we recognize the progress made, we feel \r\nthat now, more than ever, we must keep our priorities \r\nstraight. We must honour our commitments. Finland \r\nremains committed. We are increasing our official \r\n A/64/PV.18\r\n \r\n5 09-55501 \r\n \r\ndevelopment assistance, and we also remain committed \r\nto the targets set in Cairo 15 years ago. We know what \r\nworks, and the time to act is now. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nMs. Raeda Al Qutob, Secretary-General of the Higher \r\nPopulation Council of Jordan. \r\n Ms. Al Qutob (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): It gives \r\nme great pleasure to speak, on behalf of both my \r\ncountry, the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, and the \r\nHigher Population Council, in this special meeting to \r\ncommemorate the fifteenth anniversary of the \r\nInternational Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment (ICPD), held in Cairo in 1994, which \r\nrepresented an important milestone on the road to the \r\nidentification of the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nJordan aligns itself with the statement to be delivered \r\nby the representative of the Sudan on behalf the Group \r\nof 77 and China. \r\n This debate is of special global strategic \r\nsignificance, since it will examine and analyse the \r\nmilestones already reached and assess their impact on \r\nvarious sectors of the population and their quality of \r\nlife, especially in the light of the international \r\neconomic and financial crisis. Here, I should like to \r\npay tribute to Ms. Thoraya Obaid, Executive Director \r\nof the United Nations Population Fund, for her tireless \r\nefforts and to express my support for her important \r\nstatement this morning. \r\n We in Jordan reiterate our full commitment to the \r\nICPD Programme of Action (see A/CONF.171/13/Rev.1) \r\nand the Millennium Development Goals, and believe \r\nthat they form a holistic and comprehensive package of \r\nobjectives that will collectively raise the standards and \r\nquality of life of all population sectors in general and \r\nthe more vulnerable groups in particular. We also \r\nbelieve that they will contribute to alleviating poverty, \r\nuniversalizing education, reducing social inequalities \r\nand raising the standard of health services provided to \r\nchildren and women, in particular in such areas as \r\nreproductive health, violence against women and \r\nsexually transmitted diseases like HIV/AIDS. \r\n Jordan, a small country with a population of some \r\n6 million, has reached many milestones in the areas of \r\npopulation and development, yet we aspire to go even \r\nfurther. The average fertility rate in Jordan had been on \r\nthe decrease in recent decades, most significantly in \r\nthe 1990s. However, that decrease gradually began to \r\nslow over the next decade and then came to a virtual \r\nhalt, until the fertility rate settled at 3.6 births \r\nper woman in 2007. This represents a decrease of only \r\n0.1 births per woman from 2002. \r\n However, on the positive side, the infant \r\nmortality rate also substantially decreased over this \r\nperiod, from 34 per 1,000 in 1990 to 19 per 1,000 in \r\n2007. Furthermore, mortality rates among children \r\nunder five fell from 39 per 1,000 in 1990 to 21 \r\nper 1,000 in 2007. As a result, average life expectancy \r\nin Jordan now exceeds 70 years. \r\n Moreover, the maternal mortality ratio resulting \r\nfrom pregnancy complications, delivery and the \r\npostpartum period has also declined as reproductive \r\nhealth and planned parenthood services have improved, \r\nand almost all deliveries now take place in hospitals \r\nunder the supervision of qualified medical workers. \r\nThis enhances our potential for achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goal of reducing maternal \r\nmortality, which stood at 41 per 100,000 live births in \r\n1996. Work is ongoing to improve that statistic. \r\n With regard to reproductive health and \r\nreproductive health rights, Jordan’s Ministry of Health, \r\nthe Royal Medical Services, the private sector and \r\ncommunity health centres have all made commendable \r\nefforts to implement reproductive health programmes. \r\nThe Ministry of Health has also developed a \r\nreproductive health commodity security plan to ensure \r\nsustained family planning services and methods. \r\nFurthermore, the Ministry has also established a \r\nspecial budget line for family. This is considered to be \r\na milestone towards ensuring reproductive rights. \r\nMoreover, Jordan has amended its civil status \r\nlegislation to increase the minimum age for marriage to \r\n18 for males and females alike. \r\n The Ministries of Education, Higher Education \r\nand Scientific Research have, over the past two \r\ndecades, incorporated the concepts of population, \r\ndevelopment and reproductive health into school \r\ncurricula at the primary and secondary levels, as well \r\nas within the core courses of university study at all \r\npublic and private universities. \r\n Access to and enrolment in primary education has \r\nnow reached near optimum levels, and plans and \r\nstrategies are being elaborated to reduce school drop-out \r\nrates, increase private sector funding and involvement, \r\nraise the standards of education, and reduce the \r\neducational gap between male and female students. \r\nA/64/PV.18  \r\n \r\n09-55501 6 \r\n \r\n The Government of Jordan has also made great \r\nefforts in the area of the environment, including \r\nthrough the establishment of the Ministry of \r\nEnvironment, which has already developed a \r\ncomprehensive national strategy for the preservation of \r\nJordan’s environment and has been mandated to \r\nimplement legislative reforms to that end. However, \r\nthe rapid increase in the urban population, coupled \r\nwith increased urbanization, is exhausting the \r\nKingdom’s limited natural resources and negatively \r\naffecting the environment. \r\n Jordan has made great strides towards the \r\nempowerment of women in the areas of health, \r\neducation and combating violence and discrimination \r\nagainst women. Women’s political and economic \r\nparticipation, however, still requires more attention. \r\nThe Jordanian Government has mapped out strategies \r\nand implemented many national programmes and plans \r\nto prevent, treat and create awareness of AIDS. It is \r\nnoteworthy that Jordan has one of the lowest \r\nincidences of AIDS in the region. \r\n With Jordan approaching a window of demographic \r\nopportunity, the Higher Population Council has \r\ndeveloped a policy document to take advantage of that \r\nopportunity to benefit the country’s workforce, \r\nespecially young people and women, by training them \r\nin skills that can match them to the requirements of the \r\njob market, as well as empowering various groups to \r\nbecome producers, investors, savers and contributors to \r\nthe national economy. That would be a qualitative \r\nimprovement in the economic, social, technological \r\nand environmental life of Jordan. \r\n Since the Cairo Conference, Jordan has witnessed \r\nnational, regional and international events that have \r\ncaused it to drastically alter its consideration of \r\npopulation and development issues in order to deal \r\nwith the social, cultural and political challenges we \r\nface, challenges brought about by social and \r\ndemographic change, repercussions of globalization \r\nand the international economic downturn. In particular, \r\nJordan has had to address demographic challenges \r\npeculiar to the country caused by several factors, \r\nincluding waves of forced migration into the Kingdom, \r\nstabilization of the total fertility rate and population \r\ngrowth in urban areas, which have created an \r\nimbalance in population distribution among the \r\ncountry’s governorates. \r\n Jordan, like other countries, has had to deal with \r\nthe ramifications of the international economic and \r\nfinancial crisis, which has already affected children, \r\nfamilies and communities and contributed significantly \r\nto a downturn in the standard and quality of life of \r\nindividuals as well as to an increase in poverty and \r\nunemployment. We have yet to ascertain its impact on \r\ninfant and childbirth mortality, female school dropouts \r\nand violence against women and girls. However, \r\nJordan will continue to strive to improve the living \r\nconditions of its entire population. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nMr. Osvaldo Lapuente, Under-Secretary for Planning and \r\nProgramming in the Office of the President of Guatemala. \r\n Mr. Lapuente (Guatemala) (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nwould like to thank the President for convening this \r\nmeeting to commemorate a new anniversary of the \r\nCairo Conference on Population and Development. I \r\nwould also like to thank the Secretary-General and the \r\nExecutive Director of the United Nations Population \r\nFund (UNFPA) for their invaluable contribution to \r\nsocial development from the perspective of population \r\nanalysis by way of the follow-up in the United Nations \r\nsystem to the Programme of Action adopted at the \r\nConference (see A/CONF.171/13/Rev.1). \r\n Fifteen years is clearly not a long time, since we \r\nare still far from the consensus agreed on in Cairo, \r\nwhere we sought to situate the world in a context \r\noriented towards equality and social justice. Even then, \r\nhistory demonstrated the urgent need for a clear \r\ndirection in the public policy agenda, one capable of \r\navoiding the tragedies that result from poverty, \r\ndiscrimination and a lack of equitable access to \r\ndevelopment opportunities in our countries. Fifteen \r\nyears later, many challenges still remain, and \r\nconditions around the world demand a new kind of \r\ndevelopment model for our countries. \r\n Nevertheless, it is amazing that in such a short time \r\nthe world has progressed at a dizzying and surprising rate, \r\nshowing that ingenuity spurs positive processes for \r\nimprovement in people’s living conditions. At this \r\npoint, our globalized world has achieved the highest \r\nlevels of technological development, generating \r\nunprecedented enthusiasm for science and innovation. \r\nAt the same time, we have been so preoccupied with \r\ntrade and establishing a free financial system that we \r\nhave lost sight of the true point of globalization, which \r\nis sustainable human development. \r\n A/64/PV.18\r\n \r\n7 09-55501 \r\n \r\n Today we are still in the turbulence of the \r\nfinancial crisis. Though it peaked in September 2008, \r\nwe are still dealing with the effects of the contraction \r\nof our economies, the loss of jobs, budget cuts in vital \r\nprogrammes and a drop in tax revenues, among other \r\nconsequences that are affecting our peoples’ quality of \r\nlife.  \r\n As Guatemala’s President Colom said in a recent \r\nspeech to the United Nations Economic Commission \r\nfor Latin America and the Caribbean, our \r\nAdministration must return to making the human being \r\nthe centre of everything we do. As a medium-to-low-\r\nincome country, Guatemala has achieved an acceptable \r\nrate of growth in the last five years, averaging between \r\n4 and 5 per cent annually, with an estimate for 2009 of \r\n0.4 per cent. The balance achieved in terms of our \r\nsocial agenda encourages us to keep working on the \r\nremaining targets of the Programme of Action and \r\nespecially to produce results in the agenda for the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\n Though the financial crisis has affected our \r\ngrowth rate, we are still holding to the strategic \r\nguidelines of the priority framework. Social policy is \r\nthe Administration’s chief driving force as it seeks an \r\narea-based approach, with as broad as possible \r\nparticipation by citizens, to impact indicators in the \r\nareas of health, education, housing, access to good-quality \r\npublic services with broader coverage, security, \r\nrecreation, jobs and other essential development factors. \r\n As a prelude, I should mention that in 2001 our \r\nSocial Development Law, approved unanimously by \r\nthe members of the legislature, came into effect. That law \r\nis without precedent in our nation’s political history, since \r\nit was formulated with the joint participation of organized \r\ncivil society, religious authorities, universities, trade \r\nunions and women’s organizations. \r\n Concerning population, we would like to \r\nhighlight the fact that we are creating the institutional \r\nconditions needed to continue lowering the mortality \r\nrate in general and maternal and infant mortality in \r\nparticular. In 1996, the infant mortality rate was 34.8 \r\nper thousand live births, while in 2007 that indicator had \r\ndropped to 24.5 per thousand. We hope that by the end of \r\n2009 the effects of the reduction will be even greater. \r\n In 2006, about 51 per cent of the population was \r\nliving in poverty, while 15.2 per cent faced extreme \r\npoverty. The proportion of people in poverty was even \r\ngreater in rural areas, reaching 70.4 per cent. Hardest \r\nhit, at 75 per cent, were the indigenous population, \r\nwho historically have not had access to education and \r\nwhose primary source of income is agriculture. \r\n For the period from 2008 to 2012, the \r\nAdministration is giving priority to implementing human \r\ndevelopment programmes, based on a strategy of focused \r\nsocial protection that identifies areas that have \r\nconcentrations of poverty and exclusion and that lack \r\naccess to basic services. The strategy is directed at the \r\nsectors of society with the least access to opportunities. \r\n The target population is families with children up \r\nto 15 years of age and pregnant or nursing mothers, \r\nwho are given conditional cash allowances. That \r\nsupport takes the form of monetary grants to poor \r\nfamilies, who are duly selected on the basis of living \r\nconditions and food vulnerability, on condition that \r\ntheir children are sent to assistance services for health, \r\nnutrition and primary education. The programme has \r\nreversed the traditional conduct with regard to those \r\nwho live in poverty. In addition, the education policy \r\nput forward for that period aimed at increasing \r\ninvestment, promoting literacy, expanding the system’s \r\ncoverage, improving teacher training and educating \r\nparents about values, health, nutrition and social \r\ndevelopment management. \r\n In 2001, Guatemala’s illiteracy rate for persons \r\naged 15 and higher stood at 30.4 per cent, while in \r\n2008 it was 21.1 per cent. That substantial reduction is \r\nan improvement that resulted from greater availability \r\nof resources and the changes made to literacy \r\nprogrammes. Similarly, the formal educational \r\nsystem’s coverage increased. In the preschool age \r\ncategory, net coverage increased from 41 per cent in \r\n2001 to 49 per cent in 2008. \r\n With regard to health services, we have been \r\nimplementing an aggressive policy of free services, \r\neliminating absolutely all charges for services \r\nrendered, which has triggered an increase in demand \r\nfor such services. The policy guidelines on reducing \r\npost-partum mortality for the period 2008 to 2012 \r\ninclude free quality prenatal, labour and delivery and \r\npostpartum care and care for newborns that, given our \r\ncountry’s rich diversity, is also culturally sensitive. \r\n With regard to gender equality, it is important to \r\npoint out that Guatemala has put in place legal \r\nmechanisms for the protection of women. We have \r\ndone so as part of an institutional process that included \r\nthe establishment of the presidential secretariat on \r\nA/64/PV.18  \r\n \r\n09-55501 8 \r\n \r\nwomen and the Office for the Defence of Indigenous \r\nWomen’s Rights. We have also put in place new legal \r\ninstruments, including a law on femicide and other \r\nforms of violence against women.  \r\n Also as part of that process, we have drawn up a \r\ndevelopment policy to create opportunities for women. \r\nWe have also harmonized its goals and operative \r\ncomponents with those of other policies, such as on \r\nrural development, youth and environment, as well as \r\nthe population and social development policy to which \r\nI have referred, among others. \r\n The results point to an increase in women’s \r\nparticipation in electoral processes and decision-\r\nmaking positions, governmental and non-governmental \r\nalike. There has also been an increase in their \r\nparticipation in civil society through representative \r\nbodies such as our country’s congressional women’s \r\ncommission. There are now services in place to provide \r\ncomprehensive care for women survivors of violence, \r\nwith particular emphasis on survivors of sexual \r\nviolence. There is also greater access for women, \r\nadolescent girls and younger girls to health, education \r\nand technical assistance services. \r\n With regard to rationalizing the decision-making \r\nprocess, Guatemala has in recent years made a significant \r\ninvestment in generating improved demographic, social \r\nand economic data. Some examples include the carrying \r\nout of censuses on population, housing and agriculture \r\nand the national surveys on living conditions and \r\nmaternal and child health.  \r\n With that brief summary of some of the progress, \r\nchallenges and expectations of Guatemala’s social \r\ndevelopment agenda, which I know participants at this \r\ncommemorative meeting share, I should now like to \r\ntake this opportunity to reiterate that we are convinced \r\nthat the results to date will only be sustainable if we \r\nbuild upon them and assume national, State ownership \r\nof them by putting in place long-term public policies, \r\nthat is to say, intergenerational policies. \r\n Although we feel optimistic about news coming \r\nfrom various parts of the world that there are now \r\ninitial signs of economic recovery, I should like to urge \r\nall peoples, countries, those who help us and, in \r\nparticular, our countries’ economic and social sector \r\nstakeholders not to abandon social protection efforts \r\nand more closely embrace their historical responsibility \r\nfor our social underdevelopment. I also urge them to \r\nsystematically focus attention on vulnerable groups as \r\npart of national efforts and create the conditions for the \r\ngeneration of real wealth and prosperity, as that is the \r\nonly real way of leaving poverty behind. \r\n My Government’s commitment is grounded in a \r\ndynamic alliance with all social, economic and political \r\nstakeholders. The goal is to move from transition \r\nprocesses to stable environments underpinned by the \r\ngeneration of wealth and market competitiveness \r\nwhere there is broader and more inclusive prosperity. \r\n I should like to emphasize that, just as we have \r\nmade structural changes in our public investment in \r\n2009, we in Guatemala need to take a step forward to \r\nensure that our society as a whole makes a change in \r\nthe marginal costs for the State, which hovered around \r\n15 per cent of our gross domestic product in 2008. \r\n We are well aware that it is the ethical and moral \r\nindicators for development that measure real change, \r\nand these can only be reflected in improved quality of \r\nlife for our citizens. On behalf of the Government of \r\nGuatemala, allow me to echo the words of our \r\nPresident to say that we are seeking a balance between \r\nsocial cohesion and economic growth against a \r\nbackdrop of sustainable equality for current and future \r\ngenerations of our Central American country. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of the Sudan. \r\n Mr. Mohamad (Sudan): The world came together \r\nin Cairo 15 years ago at the International Conference \r\non Population and Development (ICPD) and agreed by \r\nconsensus on a 20-year Programme of Action that \r\nintegrated a comprehensive range of population, \r\ndevelopment and human rights issues necessary for \r\nensuring that every person lives a healthy and dignified \r\nlife. On that occasion, 179 States agreed to make a \r\ncollective effort, among other things, to achieve \r\nuniversal access to education and reduce infant, child \r\nand maternal mortality.  \r\n Notwithstanding the fact that the Conference had \r\na positive impact on poverty eradication and economic \r\ndevelopment, there remain considerable challenges and \r\ngaps — including as a result of the economic and \r\nfinancial crisis — that need to be addressed in order to \r\nattain the internationally agreed development goals, \r\nincluding the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), \r\nalong the way to achieving the goals of the \r\nConference. That is why today’s meeting is an \r\nimportant and timely event and an opportunity to \r\n A/64/PV.18\r\n \r\n9 09-55501 \r\n \r\nrecommit ourselves to the attainment of the objectives \r\nof the ICPD. \r\n According to the 2009 MDGs report, which \r\nincorporates many of the goals of the Conference, less \r\nprogress has been made towards MDGs 3, 4, 5 and 6, \r\nwhich are identified in the Programme of Action \r\nadopted in 1994, as they relate to economic and social \r\ndevelopment. In that context, most developing \r\ncountries have experienced a major per-woman \r\nreduction of donor funding for family planning since \r\nthe mid-1990s. Gender parity in education has yet to be \r\nachieved in developing countries. \r\n Furthermore, the report shows that the target of \r\neliminating gender disparities in primary and \r\nsecondary education by 2005 in developing countries \r\nwas missed. The disadvantage for girls when it comes \r\nto enrolment persists at higher levels of education. \r\nWith regard to health, there has been little progress in \r\nreducing maternal mortality. There were 480 maternal \r\ndeaths per 100,000 births in 1990, as compared to 450 \r\nin 2005. \r\n While some regions in developing countries \r\nexperienced a substantial decline in maternal deaths, \r\nothers made little improvement. Women in those \r\nregions face the greatest lifetime risk of dying as a \r\nresult of pregnancy and childbirth. The number of \r\npeople newly infected with HIV peaked in some \r\nregions in 1996, declining to 2.7 million worldwide in \r\n2007. Unfortunately, in some areas in least developed \r\ncountries, HIV prevalence has almost doubled since \r\n2001, with two thirds of those living with HIV in \r\ncertain other areas being women. \r\n A fully functional, efficient and quality health \r\nsystem is essential for the realization of the ICPD \r\nProgramme of Action and the MDG health-related \r\ngoals. Many countries have health-care systems that \r\nare deficient in infrastructure and human resources. We \r\nbelieve that the achievement of MDG 8, regarding a \r\nglobal partnership for development, is crucial for those \r\ncountries to improve and strengthen the capacity of \r\ntheir health systems to ensure availability, accessibility \r\nand quality of services, with the support of the \r\ninternational community. What we need is genuine \r\nstrong will to ensure adequate financing and the \r\neffective delivery of the goals set, as well as the \r\nstreamlining and harmonization of aid operations. \r\n The Group of 77 and China firmly believe that \r\nthe principles, goals and objectives set out in the ICPD \r\nProgramme of Action, as well as in other outcomes of \r\nmajor United Nations conferences and summits, \r\ntogether provide a comprehensive framework for \r\ninternational development. The implementation of the \r\nICPD Programme of Action is crucial for the \r\neradication of extreme poverty and the achievement of \r\nthe other MDGs. \r\n The Group believes that population issues must \r\nbe addressed in a comprehensive manner, as outlined in \r\nthe ICPD Programme of Action. The Group of 77 and \r\nChina note with concern that resources directed \r\ntowards the implementation of the Programme of \r\nAction have consistently been below target. To address \r\nthat concern, donors, United Nations agencies and \r\nother international organizations must work together to \r\nenhance financial and technical support to developing \r\ncountries, including in the field of capacity-building, in \r\norder to ensure the realization of the ICPD Programme \r\nof Action. \r\n With only five years remaining until the \r\nconclusion of the ICPD Programme of Action and as \r\nwe are already past the midpoint of the MDGs’ target \r\nend date, it is vital for Member States to recognize the \r\ngaps and challenges, consolidate lessons learned and \r\nreaffirm commitments. It is likewise essential to renew \r\nefforts aimed at sustaining current achievements and \r\nincreasing resources to accelerate the realization of the \r\nProgramme of Action and the MDGs. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to thank the President \r\nfor organizing this meeting. I would also like to take \r\nthis opportunity to express our Group’s appreciation to \r\nMs. Thoraya Obaid, the Executive Director of the \r\nUnited Nations Population Fund, for her informative \r\nstatement and her outstanding contribution. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on the \r\nrepresentative of Mexico. \r\n Mr. Vélez (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): It is an \r\nhonour for me to speak today on behalf of the Rio \r\nGroup on the fifteenth anniversary of the International \r\nConference on Population and Development (ICPD). \r\n Within the framework of the commemoration of \r\nthe fifteenth anniversary of the Cairo Conference of \r\n1994, and in compliance with resolution 644/XXXII of \r\n2008 of the Economic Commission for Latin America \r\nand the Caribbean (ECLAC), the Latin American and \r\nCaribbean Demographic Centre — the ECLAC \r\nPopulation Division and the United Nations Population \r\nA/64/PV.18  \r\n \r\n09-55501 10 \r\n \r\nFund (UNFPA) held a regional seminar in Santiago de \r\nChile from 7 to 8 October 2009 in order to study the \r\nprogress made in Latin America in the implementation \r\nof the ICPD Programme of Action and the Programme \r\nof Action’s relation with the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs), including Goal 5, universal access to \r\nreproductive health. \r\n The seminar brought together governmental, \r\nparliamentary, civil society and academic experts from \r\nall Latin American countries. It also included experts \r\nfrom the English- and Dutch-speaking Caribbean \r\nsubregions, who also attended the concluding \r\nsubregional seminar that was held in Antigua and \r\nBarbuda during this past August. \r\n That seminar provided a forum for assessing the \r\nactivities carried out by the countries in the region in \r\nfulfilling the ICPD Programme of Action, which led \r\nthem to reaffirm its relevance. Participants analysed \r\nproposals for accelerating its implementation over the \r\nnext five years as well as for defining a road map \r\ntowards 2014 and beyond.  \r\n Over the past five years, Latin America has made \r\nsignificant progress in improving the standard of living \r\nof its people. In 2008, the most significant and \r\nprolonged cycle of economic expansion experienced in \r\nthe region since 1970 came to an end. In that context, \r\npoverty and abject poverty had been reduced and, in \r\nmany cases, inequality as well. Nonetheless, the region \r\ncontinues to have more than 180 million poor people \r\nand more than 70 million people living in abject \r\npoverty. \r\n Presently, the global economic crisis has a \r\nnegative impact on our development. One of the most \r\ndifficult lessons of previous crises was the \r\nconfirmation of the fact that social losses are recovered \r\nonly very slowly in subsequent growth cycles. For \r\nexample, it took 24 years to return even to the levels of \r\npoverty that had existed prior to the economic crisis of \r\nthe 1980s, which was twice the amount of time it took \r\nthe gross national product to recover. \r\n In recent years, Latin America has made progress \r\nin its demographic transition and also in its changes in \r\nage structure, bringing with it, in many countries, a \r\ntemporary window of opportunity, that is, a \r\ndemographic bonus. That has also contributed to \r\nimprovements in various social indicators. Likewise, \r\nthe high level of urbanization in the region and the \r\nconsolidation of a more robust system of cities \r\nfacilitate implementation of public policies aimed at \r\nsocial protection and poverty reduction. \r\n In the five years remaining for complying with \r\nthe timeline of the ICPD Programme of Action by \r\n2014, most of the countries in Latin America face \r\ndifficulties in achieving all of their objectives, despite \r\nthe fact that many of them have made important gains \r\nin the fields of population and development. The same \r\napplies to the agreed MDGs. It is therefore important \r\nto issue an urgent call for action on behalf of the \r\npeoples and countries of the region to Governments, \r\ncivil society organizations and international \r\norganizations, so as to ensure the realization of the \r\ngoals of the ICPD Programme of Action and the \r\nMDGs, thereby reinforcing actions undertaken in \r\nresponse to emerging issues. \r\n The MDGs will not be reached by 2015 if the \r\ntarget of universal access to reproductive health is not \r\nmet. That therefore makes that target a priority for the \r\nregion, which requires solid commitment in terms of \r\npolitical will and financial resources. Over the next \r\nfive years, Latin America is going to be facing the \r\ndouble challenges of strengthening its actions so as to \r\nachieve the objectives of the ICPD Programme of \r\nAction and, at the same time, responding to emerging \r\nchallenges. \r\n In that context, it is imperative to define a five-\r\nyear strategy for countries, making use of coordination \r\nmechanisms that will allow their actions to have a \r\nstronger impact. A strong partnership among \r\nGovernments, parliaments, civil society organizations \r\nand development agencies should allow the region to \r\nmake better progress in the period ahead, help us to \r\nprioritize key challenges identified in that five-year \r\nreview, apply identified lessons learned and best \r\npractices and share information through South-South \r\ncooperation. \r\n It is fundamental that the commitment that the \r\ncountries of the region have demonstrated to the ICPD \r\nProgramme of Action be reaffirmed, continue and be \r\ntranslated into concrete actions over the next five years. \r\nFor subsequent decades, we must start thinking now \r\nabout an agenda with respect to population and \r\ndevelopment at the global, regional, subregional and \r\nnational levels. To this end, the technical secretariat of \r\nthe ECLAC Ad Hoc Committee on Population and \r\nDevelopment should develop, with the support of \r\nUNFPA, a proposal to present at the next meeting of the \r\n A/64/PV.18\r\n \r\n11 09-55501 \r\n \r\nCommittee. That agenda for the future should address \r\nthe debts and pending issues identified during this five-\r\nyear review process, among them inequality, adolescent \r\npregnancy and maternal mortality. It should also include \r\nemerging themes such as the protraction of old age, the \r\nmore complex gender and intergenerational relationships \r\nin some societies, the effects of the second demographic \r\ntransition, climate change, natural disasters, the \r\neconomic and food crises, the spread of the new HIV \r\nepidemic, the link between productive and reproductive \r\nroles, urban segregation, the increase in international \r\nmigration and intercultural issues. \r\n In sum, for the next decades, new agreements are \r\nneeded, new targets need to be defined and new \r\nmeasures need to be put into practice. Together with \r\nthat agenda, it is necessary to begin the process of \r\nidentifying and establishing — at the appropriate \r\ntime — instruments and mechanisms to continue \r\nadvancing the agenda initiated by the Programme of \r\nAction of the International Conference on Population \r\nand Development.  \r\n The Acting President: I now call on Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Mia Ventura, Deputy Executive \r\nDirector of the Commission on Population of the \r\nRepublic of the Philippines. \r\n Ms. Ventura (Philippines): I wish to express my \r\ndelegation’s appreciation to Mr. Treki for organizing \r\nthe commemoration of the fifteenth anniversary of the \r\nInternational Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment, a conference that produced a Programme \r\nof Action (see A/CONF.171/13/Rev.1) encompassing a \r\nbroad range of cross-cutting issues, including \r\npopulation, development and human rights. I would \r\nalso like to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and \r\nUnder-Secretary-General and Executive Director of the \r\nUnited Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) Thoraya \r\nObaid for their commitment and engagement in \r\nadvancing population awareness activities as an \r\ninstrument for assisting Member States in formulating \r\ntheir respective policies and strategies aimed at \r\naccomplishing the internationally agreed development \r\ngoals, including the Millennium Development Goals.  \r\n It would also be appropriate to recall the first \r\nExecutive Director of UNFPA — a Filipino, Mr. Rafael \r\nSalas, who raised global awareness on the link between \r\npopulation and development and was a catalyst for the \r\nestablishment of UNFPA in 1969.  \r\n The participation of my delegation in this event is \r\nan opportunity to renew the commitment of the \r\nPhilippines to contribute to the achievement of the \r\ngoals and provide solutions to the challenges outlined \r\nin the ICPD Programme of Action, as well as other \r\ninternationally agreed development goals, including \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. In view of the \r\ntime constraint, a longer version of this statement \r\ncontaining the progress report of the Philippines on the \r\nProgramme of Action will be circulated to participants. \r\n The Philippines associates itself with the \r\nstatement just made by the Permanent Representative \r\nof the Republic of the Sudan as Chairman of the Group \r\nof 77 and China. Allow me to highlight some issues \r\nfrom the perspective of my delegation.  \r\n The incidence of poverty and malnutrition among \r\nchildren under five declined significantly to 32.9 per \r\ncent and 24.6 per cent, respectively, in 2006, as \r\ncompared to 45.3 per cent and 34.5 per cent in 1991. \r\nPopulation also decreased, by 2.04 per cent in the \r\nperiod from 2000 to 2007 and by 2.36 per cent in the \r\nperiod from 1995 to 2000, and it is projected to decline \r\nby a further 1.8 percent by 2015. If these downward \r\ntrends continue, that will allow the Philippines to \r\naccelerate its economic growth and development.  \r\n An important factor contributing to that \r\naccomplishment is the advocacy of my Government for \r\npopulation management as an avenue for poverty \r\nalleviation. Funds are allocated in the national budget \r\nto ensure universal access to services in reproductive \r\nhealth and family planning, including maternal, \r\nnewborn and child health and nutrition programmes \r\nand other reproductive health services. Also, the Local \r\nGovernment Units enacted reproductive health and \r\nfamily planning ordinances with the concomitant \r\nallocation of resources as part of their Contraceptive \r\nSelf-Reliance initiative.  \r\n A strategy designed to strengthen the Responsible \r\nParenthood Programme was implemented to empower \r\ncouples and families and assist them in achieving their \r\nfertility goals through responsible parenthood and \r\neffective parenting, fertility awareness, responsible \r\nsexuality, birth spacing and scientific natural family \r\nplanning. However, the unmet need of couples for \r\nfamily planning has to be addressed more \r\ncomprehensively. \r\n Key policy reforms were instituted to reduce \r\nmaternal mortality. We aim to establish facilities to \r\nA/64/PV.18  \r\n \r\n09-55501 12 \r\n \r\nreduce maternal deaths from the current figure of \r\n162 for every 100,000 live births to 52.  \r\n There has been considerable improvement in the \r\nstatus of women in my country, as reflected in their \r\nenhanced political participation, employment, \r\neducation, health and decision-making power. Several \r\nkey laws and programmes were enacted to empower \r\nwomen and promote gender equality, such as the \r\nGender and Development Budget Policy, which \r\nallocates at least 5 per cent of national and local \r\ngovernment budgets for women and development \r\ninitiatives. The Magna Carta of Women is a law signed \r\non 14 August 2009 to ensure women’s equitable \r\nparticipation and representation in government, \r\npolitical parties, international bodies, civil service and \r\nthe private sector. \r\n The Philippines is taking strides to address all \r\naspects of human development, especially among our \r\nchildren, by, among other measures, arresting the \r\ndecline in basic education enrolment. Another measure \r\nis the adoption of the reform agenda for health, which \r\nhas four components: first, more, better and sustained \r\nfinancing, second, regulation to ensure equality and \r\naffordability, third, ensured access and availability of \r\nservice delivery, and fourth, improved performance in \r\ngovernance. \r\n The health of Filipinos has improved over time, \r\nas evidenced by recent data. Lifespans are longer — \r\n67.8 years for males and 72.5 years for females. The \r\ninfant mortality rate declined from 30 infants per \r\n1,000 live births in 2003 to 24 in 2006. In the same \r\nperiod mortality rates for children under five declined \r\nfrom 42 children per 1,000 surviving children to 32. \r\n I will conclude my statement by addressing the \r\nissue of international migration and development.  \r\n Last year, the Philippines had the singular honour \r\nof hosting the second Global Forum on Migration and \r\nDevelopment, which was graced by the presence of \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon. The event was an \r\nopportunity for the participants and stakeholders to \r\nrenew their international commitment to ensuring the \r\nprotection, welfare and human dignity of migrant \r\nworkers. The report on the second Forum was \r\ncirculated to all Member and Observer States and other \r\nstakeholders and to the Secretary-General for \r\nconsideration. \r\n The Philippines continues to be engaged and will \r\nactively participate in various processes and forums to \r\nfoster cooperation among all stakeholders in order to \r\nunderscore the positive consequences that migration \r\nbrings to both sending and receiving countries and \r\nexpresses the hope that international migration and \r\ndevelopment remains high on the United Nations \r\nagenda. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Sri Lanka. \r\n Mr. Chandra (Sri Lanka): I thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, and the \r\nExecutive Director of the United Nations Population \r\nFund (UNFPA), Ms. Thoraya Obaid, for organizing this \r\nseries of meetings to commemorate the fifteenth \r\nanniversary of the International Conference on \r\nPopulation and Development (ICPD) and for their \r\nstatements. \r\n We have only five more years ahead of us to \r\ncomplete the 20-year ICPD Programme of Action that \r\nwas agreed 15 years ago. Today, I take the floor with \r\nmixed feelings. On the one hand, I am pleased to report \r\non the significant achievements that my country has \r\nmade over the past several years in the key areas set \r\nout at the ICPD. On the other hand, regrets naturally \r\ncome to me when I think of the millions of human \r\nbeings around the globe who are not fortunate enough \r\nto have a decent life free from poverty, hunger, illness \r\nand fear. \r\n The modest ambitions envisaged in the Cairo \r\nConsensus of 1994, following Economic and Social \r\nCouncil resolution 1989/91, were based on the \r\nfundamental principles of individual freedom. The \r\nCairo Consensus essentially has a futuristic and \r\nindividual-centred approach to redressing major social \r\nissues such as population management and sustainable \r\neconomic growth and development, with a special \r\nfocus on the status of women and their health and \r\neducation. Additionally, the goals of the ICPD \r\nclustered around guaranteeing universal education and \r\nreducing infant, child and maternal mortality. Access \r\nby 2015 to reproductive health care, including family \r\nplanning, assisted childbirth and prevention of sexually \r\ntransmittable diseases such as HIV/AIDS is another \r\nprime objective of the ICPD. \r\n The ICPD marked a significant shift from the \r\ntraditional focus on setting demographic targets and \r\nmanaging population numbers to an approach built on \r\n A/64/PV.18\r\n \r\n13 09-55501 \r\n \r\nmeeting the needs of individuals and families with the \r\naim of improving their quality of life.  \r\n My country, which has enshrined in its \r\nConstitution the core values of human freedom and \r\ndevelopment, became a co-signatory to the ICPD \r\nProgramme of Action (see A/CONF.171/13/Rev.1) at \r\nits inception. That significant step reaffirmed our \r\ncommitment to the fundamental right of men, women \r\nand youth to have access to information and support \r\nservices and the opportunity to exercise their rights to \r\nthe highest attainable standards of reproductive health.  \r\n By recognizing gender equality and the \r\nempowerment of women, the process has enabled \r\nyoung couples to make informed decisions in planning \r\ntheir own families. The current population figures in \r\nmy country prove that the personal choice given to \r\nindividuals to decide on their family size yields \r\ndesirable results. The annual average population \r\ngrowth in the period from 2000 to 2007 in Sri Lanka \r\nwas 0.4 per cent, which made an immense contribution \r\ntowards achieving the Cairo principles. Investments in \r\nreproductive health have thus improved prospects for \r\nsustainable development and poverty reduction. \r\n The Millennium Declaration adopted by our \r\nleaders in 2000 (resolution 55/2) re-energized the \r\nICPD principles and Programme of Action. It is the \r\nfirm belief of my delegation that the foundation laid by \r\nthe ICPD played a complementary role in accelerating \r\nthe progress towards achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) by 2015. Therefore, it \r\nwould not be irrational to assume that the full \r\nimplementation of the 20-year ICPD Programme of \r\nAction will undoubtedly help in realizing the MDGs. \r\n Permit me to shed some light on the success story \r\nof my own country, Sri Lanka. To explain with figures, \r\nour prevalence rate for use of modern contraceptive \r\nmethods has increased from 20 per cent to 70 per cent \r\nsince 1975, most significantly over the last 15 years. \r\nMore than 96 per cent of childbirths are attended by \r\nskilled health practitioners, thus minimizing the health \r\nrisks and complications associated with childbirth. The \r\nmortality rate of children below five years of age has \r\nreached the lower end — from 32 per thousand in 1990 \r\nto 13 per thousand in 2006. The percentage of the \r\npopulation between 15 and 49 years of age infected \r\nwith HIV remains at a very low figure, below 0.1 per \r\ncent. \r\n We have not only achieved the universal primary \r\neducation targets but also ensured gender equality. The \r\nratio of girls to boys in primary education remains \r\nhigh. The adult literacy rate complements that figure \r\nby exceeding an average of 94 per cent among both \r\nmales and females, and the female literacy rate exceeds \r\n92 per cent. Life expectancy at birth remains as high as \r\n72 years for males and 78 years for females. \r\n Despite these impressive achievements, \r\nchallenges relating to fulfilling the MDGs remain. The \r\nrelatively high child malnutrition rate remains at an \r\nalarming 22.8 per cent, which demands urgent \r\nattention. Additionally, the per capita expenditure of \r\nthe poorest quintile remains at 7.0 per cent. \r\n The Government of Sri Lanka has therefore given \r\nspecial attention to those areas and has already \r\nlaunched several empowerment projects at the grass-\r\nroot level. President Mahinda Rajapaksa, in his \r\nGovernment’s policy document “Mahinda Chintana”, \r\nhas proposed pragmatic solutions. The measures being \r\nimplemented include a free midday meal for students, \r\nwomen’s empowerment through providing village-level \r\nmicrocredit, and special health-care and poverty \r\nalleviation programmes for the poor.  \r\n The commitment demonstrated by our political \r\nleadership has yielded positive results in changing the \r\npoverty map in Sri Lanka, particularly in the Eastern \r\nProvince, which suffered from the scourge of brutal \r\nterrorism for over three decades. Under the Eastern \r\nReawakening programme the region is currently \r\nexperiencing rapid development. \r\n Since the Cairo Conference, the Government of \r\nSri Lanka, with the generous assistance of UNFPA, has \r\nimplemented the agreed Programme of Action by \r\nadhering to the Population and Reproductive Health \r\nPolicy. Currently, an advanced phase of this policy, \r\nwhich includes the training of reproductive health-care \r\nservice providers, is being implemented. In addition, \r\nmanagement of sexually transmitted infections, \r\nHIV/AIDS prevention and cancer screening have been \r\nadded to the range of health-care services provided \r\nunder the policy’s agenda. \r\n In those efforts, the Government has worked hand \r\nin hand with all multilateral and bilateral stakeholders \r\nto reach the current status regarding ICPD targets in \r\nour country. In particular, the United Nations country \r\nteam, with the support of UNFPA — which is the \r\nimplementing agency for the ICPD — has worked \r\nA/64/PV.18  \r\n \r\n09-55501 14 \r\n \r\ntirelessly at the grass-roots level. We thank partner \r\nGovernments and non-governmental agencies for their \r\nassistance. On behalf of my Government, I wish to \r\nexpress my gratitude for all those partners for their \r\ncontinued dedication and tremendous contributions. \r\n The Acting President: I call next on the \r\nrepresentative of Israel. \r\n Mr. Carmon (Israel): We are gathered here today \r\nto commemorate the fifteenth anniversary of the \r\nInternational Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment (ICPD). Its Programme of Action (see \r\nA/CONF.171/13/Rev.1) has guided numerous \r\ninitiatives, policies and programmes in the field of \r\npopulation at the national, regional and international \r\nlevels for the past 15 years. \r\n Although I am addressing the Assembly today in \r\nmy national capacity, allow me to reflect on my role as \r\nChair of the Commission on Population and \r\nDevelopment. The Commission has played a key role \r\nin the work of the ICPD process. Indeed, as early as \r\n1989, the Commission proposed that an international \r\nconference be held in 1994, and it served as its \r\npreparatory committee. After the Cairo Conference, the \r\nCommission was strengthened through the decision to \r\nincrease its membership and meet in annual sessions, \r\neach focused on a specific theme related to population \r\nand development. \r\n Thanks to ongoing efforts to improve its methods \r\nof work, the Commission conducts a thorough annual \r\nreview of progress made in the implementation of each \r\nof the chapters of the Programme of Action. The \r\nCommission has thus been effective in providing \r\nadditional guidance to Member States on how to \r\naccelerate the implementation of the Programme. \r\n Mr. Mohamed (Maldives), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n The Commission’s resolutions have allowed for a \r\nrealignment of priorities as challenges and \r\ndevelopments arise. In particular, given that several of \r\nthe key ICPD goals and objectives became part of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) in 2000, the \r\nCommission has focused on their implementation. In \r\naddition, its deliberations have succeeded in ensuring \r\nthat all relevant indicators of achievement are included \r\nin the MDG framework. \r\n Since 1994, the ICPD Programme of Action has \r\nprovided a blueprint for a holistic approach to \r\npopulation issues. It deserves our support because it \r\nputs individuals and human rights at the centre of \r\npopulation and development issues, and it provides \r\ncomprehensive guidance in all aspects of population \r\ndevelopment while considering the important principle \r\nof sustainable development. \r\n Israel is particularly appreciative of the direction \r\nthat the Programme of Action provides regarding the \r\nintegration of gender and the empowerment of women \r\ninto development and population policies. The \r\nimportance of those issues in my country is \r\ndemonstrated by the fact that the Israeli Authority for \r\nthe Advancement of the Status of Women is part of the \r\nPrime Minister’s Office. It promotes policies and \r\nprogrammes to enhance the status, health, safety and \r\nequality of women, as we consider such initiatives to \r\nbe essential for the general well-being of society. \r\n Israel fully supports the right of couples and \r\nindividuals to freely decide the number and spacing of \r\ntheir children. Today, Israel’s total fertility rate is high \r\nfor a developed country: an average of 3 children per \r\nwoman. That national average results from very \r\ndifferent family sizes, decided upon by persons with \r\nvaried religious and cultural values. Extreme fertility \r\ngaps between different population groups — a leading \r\nindicator of socio-economic inequality — are \r\ndiminishing as the distribution of, and access to, social \r\nand health services and opportunities increase \r\nthroughout all segments of society. At the same time, \r\nIsrael is proud of its achievements regarding the high \r\neducational attainment of women and their high levels \r\nof participation in the labour force and of income. \r\n Israel considers that the health of its population is \r\na crucial public good. Our health system covers every \r\nresident in the country.  \r\n A particularly successful aspect of the system is \r\nthe Mother and Child Health Clinics, known in Hebrew \r\nas Tipat Chalav. Those clinics provide prenatal, post-\r\npartum and reproductive health services to women. \r\nThey also administer vaccinations and maintain records \r\non the physical and mental development of children. \r\nThe clinics have been recognized by UNESCO as a \r\nsuccessful model of public health and education, and \r\nIsrael now partners with developing countries in order \r\nto assist them as they replicate the Israeli model. \r\n As a country that has absorbed millions of \r\nimmigrants and refugees, Israel has developed \r\ncomprehensive programmes to assist those particular \r\n A/64/PV.18\r\n \r\n15 09-55501 \r\n \r\npopulations. Since the Programme of Action was \r\nadopted in 1994, Israel has successfully integrated \r\nimmigrants, who account for nearly one sixth of our \r\npopulation. Throughout that period of exceptionally \r\nhigh population growth, the level of employment has \r\nremained stable, while life expectancy, educational \r\nattainment and income levels have steadily increased. \r\nAs we move forward, Israel stands ready to share its \r\nsuccessful experience in that respect with other \r\ncountries that could benefit from the lessons we have \r\nlearned. \r\n In the area of development cooperation, our \r\nCentre for International Cooperation — MASHAV — \r\nworks to, inter alia, empower women around the world \r\nand improve their health. Israel has also partnered with \r\nmany United Nations bodies in the global effort to \r\nachieve the MDGs. Those partnerships have led to \r\nvarious programmes relevant to population goals, \r\nincluding those addressing migration and health, early-\r\nchildhood education and the prevention of HIV/AIDS \r\nin Africa. \r\n Israel is committed to the full implementation of \r\nthe ICPD Programme of Action, and we stand ready to \r\nshare ideas and experiences, confront challenges, \r\nexpand our partnerships and collaborate in developing \r\nfurther initiatives. In that respect, the interlinkages \r\nbetween climate change, population dynamics and \r\nglobal health are becoming increasingly important. \r\nThose issues are of great concern and are directly \r\nrelated to the issues of population and development. \r\n Furthermore, Israel recognizes the major \r\ncontributions that the United Nations Population Fund \r\nhas made to the implementation of the Programme of \r\nAction and considers that the Fund’s assistance to and \r\nsupport for reproductive health programmes can make \r\na major contribution to the achievement of the MDGs. \r\n As a representative of the State of Israel, but also \r\nas Chairman of the Commission on Population and \r\nDevelopment, I look forward to the activities of the \r\nCommission and to collaborating with all relevant \r\npartners to increase the number of improvements in the \r\narea of population and development. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on the \r\nrepresentative of Poland. \r\n Mr. Herczyński (Poland): On behalf of Poland, I \r\nam honoured to address the General Assembly on its \r\ncommemoration of the fifteenth anniversary of the \r\nInternational Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment (ICPD). At the outset, let me underline \r\nthat Poland associates itself with the statement \r\ndelivered by the representative of Sweden on behalf of \r\nthe European Union (EU). \r\n The Cairo Conference, held in 1994, has played \r\nan essential role over the past 15 years in the process \r\nof improving the quality of life and access to health. In \r\naddition, by putting human beings at the heart of all \r\nactivities, the ICPD was a great step forward in the \r\nprocess of promoting full respect for human dignity \r\nworldwide. \r\n I would like to stress that the ICPD Programme \r\nof Action (see A/CONF.171/13/Rev.1) was adopted by \r\n179 countries. Since then it has been implemented in \r\nall continents and in countries representing various \r\ncultures and historical experiences and facing different \r\nsocial and economic problems. That illustrates a great \r\ncommon understanding within the international \r\ncommunity of problems pertaining to population, \r\ndevelopment, gender equality, the shared \r\nresponsibilities of men and women and reproduction-\r\nrelated health issues. \r\n The ICPD was also a reaction to the HIV/AIDS \r\nepidemic, a great global threat and a challenge that the \r\ninternational community continues to face today. With \r\nregard to the response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, as \r\nmentioned in the EU statement, Poland has high hopes \r\nfor progress in research and development of other \r\nforms of prevention, namely, microbicides that could \r\nsignificantly reduce HIV infections worldwide. \r\n Poland shares the view that the right to attain the \r\nhighest standard of health, including sexual and \r\nreproductive health, is a basis for action. The \r\nincorporation of the ICPD agenda into national \r\ndevelopment strategies — especially in national health \r\npolicies, strategies, programmes and budgets — is a \r\nprerequisite for achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). At the same time, while \r\nwe support the statement made on behalf of the EU, we \r\nwould like to stress that in our understanding any \r\nreference made to sexual and reproductive health and \r\nrights does not constitute encouraging or promoting \r\nabortion on request. \r\n At the beginning of the twenty-first century, we \r\nhave become more and more conscious of the fact that \r\nglobal economic and social development still faces \r\nmany impediments. Both the economic downturn, \r\nA/64/PV.18  \r\n \r\n09-55501 16 \r\n \r\nwhich affected developing as well as developed \r\ncountries, and, in the field of health, the A(H1N1) flu \r\npandemic, which crossed borders with lightning speed, \r\nproved that common efforts by all members of the \r\ninternational community are fundamental to coping \r\nwith and overcoming crises of a global nature. \r\n Looking back on the 15 years that have elapsed \r\nsince the Cairo Conference, we can say that, although \r\nmuch has been done, many problems still require \r\nurgent collective efforts. The cooperation of the \r\ninternational community is essential to attaining all \r\ninternationally agreed development goals, including \r\nthe MDGs. It is our belief that we should focus on \r\nfighting poverty and enabling universal access to \r\neducation. The family, as a basic unit of society, should \r\nbe at the heart of our actions. In the field of maternal \r\nhealth, where progress towards the achievement of the \r\nrelevant MDGs remains slow and even unsatisfactory, \r\nthe main problem to be solved is how to enable access \r\nto health and obstetric care. \r\n I would like to reconfirm Poland’s commitment \r\nto the effective implementation of the ICPD \r\nProgramme of Action. Poland expresses its strong \r\nsupport for the activities of the United Nations system \r\nin that regard, in particular those of the United Nations \r\nPopulation Fund. We are ready to actively participate \r\nin discussions and actions leading to the attainment of \r\nthe ICPD goals. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of New Zealand. \r\n Ms. Graham (New Zealand): New Zealand fully \r\naligns itself with the joint Pacific island members’ \r\nstatement delivered earlier today by The Honourable \r\nVita Skilling, Secretary of Health and Social Affairs of \r\nthe Federated States of Micronesia.  \r\n New Zealand is regarded internationally as a \r\nsteadfast advocate of the goals agreed at the \r\nInternational Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment (ICPD), held in 1994 in Cairo. The \r\nagreement forged at the ICPD and the Programme of \r\nAction that came out of the Conference (see \r\nA/CONF.171/13/Rev.1) were significant in addressing \r\nsome of the most sensitive aspects of sexual and \r\nreproductive health and for promoting a rights-based \r\napproach to dealing with population issues. \r\n New Zealand has vigorously pursued the ICPD \r\ngoals over the past 15 years — from supporting \r\npractical initiatives in the Pacific region, such as in the \r\nareas of adolescent sexual and reproductive health, to \r\nincreasing our core contributions to the United Nations \r\nPopulation Fund and the International Planned \r\nParenthood Federation, as well as through \r\ncontributions to the global policy dialogue, including \r\nmost recently in the Human Rights Council. In June of \r\nthis year, New Zealand co-led a successful initiative \r\nthrough the Council that resulted in the consensus \r\nadoption of a resolution on preventable maternal \r\nmortality and morbidity and human rights. The wide \r\nsupport it received from 72 members forms a strong \r\nfoundation for further progress on these issues. \r\n However, this anniversary reminds us that there \r\nare only five years remaining to fulfil our \r\ncommitments made in 1994, and much work remains to \r\nbe done. The current global financial and economic \r\ncrisis is having an impact on the lives of people in \r\ndeveloping countries in particular. That makes it all the \r\nmore important to remain focused on our goals. If we \r\ndo not, there will be long-term consequences for \r\npopulation issues and sexual and reproductive health. \r\nWe will continue to see gender inequality, high rates of \r\nunintended teenage pregnancy and maternal mortality, \r\nas well as increasing social and economic disparities. \r\nWe must continue to promote universal access to \r\nreproductive health. We must continue to reduce \r\nmaternal deaths. And we must continue to support \r\nprogrammes that invest in women’s economic \r\nempowerment. \r\n New Zealand is very conscious that — after \r\nsub-Saharan Africa — the Pacific, and more \r\nspecifically Melanesia, is the area of the world second \r\nleast likely to meet the targets set by the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. As the Assembly is aware, the \r\nGoals are inextricably linked to those of the ICPD \r\nProgramme of Action. \r\n Perhaps most critically, the adverse effects of \r\nclimate change will have direct consequences on \r\nhuman welfare, food security and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. How we address climate change in \r\nCopenhagen will hopefully signal a renewed effort to \r\nachieve the goals of the ICPD. New Zealand wants to \r\nsee any future international agreement on climate \r\nchange include responses to mitigation and adaptation \r\nthat take into account population dynamics.  \r\n There is also a need to make progress on those \r\nissues outside the climate framework, such as \r\n A/64/PV.18\r\n \r\n17 09-55501 \r\n \r\nincreasing access to sexual and reproductive health and \r\nvoluntary family planning services. Those services \r\nmust incorporate a rights-based approach to lowering \r\nfertility, slowing population growth and empowering \r\nwomen. All those efforts will contribute to climate \r\nchange mitigation and will build resilience for \r\nadaptation. \r\n In conclusion, New Zealand wishes to restate our \r\ncommitment to these goals and our focus on sexual and \r\nreproductive health, HIV and AIDS and gender \r\nequality. We intend to do so through continued \r\ncollaboration with our partners, particularly those in \r\nthe Pacific region. \r\n Mr. Webb (United States of America): The \r\nUnited States would like to share its condolences with \r\nthe families of the 11 United Nations workers who \r\nrecently died in a plane crash in Haiti.  \r\n It is my great honour to be here today to \r\ncommemorate the fifteenth anniversary of the Cairo \r\nProgramme of Action (see A/CONF.171/13/Rev.1) of \r\nthe International Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment (ICPD). We appreciate the thoughtful \r\nremarks of other delegations today. I would like to \r\nrecognize all of the other Governments and \r\norganizations represented here, and others around the \r\nworld, for their support of the ICPD Programme of \r\nAction over the past 15 years. The United States \r\nstrongly supports the goals and ideals of the ICPD and, \r\nunder President Obama’s leadership, has renewed our \r\ncommitment to work with the international community \r\nto implement the ICPD Programme of Action.  \r\n The ICPD represented a turning point in the \r\nworld’s perspective on population and development. \r\nThe international community recognized the \r\nimportance of the voluntary decisions made by \r\nindividuals and couples about the number, timing and \r\nspacing of their children and the importance of \r\nensuring that information and services were available \r\nto make and implement informed decisions. It also \r\nclearly recognized the importance of population and \r\ndevelopment objectives critical to achieving the goals \r\nof sustained economic growth in the context of \r\nsustainable development; education, especially for \r\ngirls; gender equity and equality; infant, child and \r\nmaternal mortality; and the provision of universal \r\naccess to reproductive health services.  \r\n We stand here today, 15 years on, with many \r\naccomplishments, but with daunting challenges still \r\nahead. I want to highlight some of the \r\naccomplishments, note some of the continuing \r\nobstacles and describe some of what the United States \r\nplans to do, moving forward. \r\n The international community has made \r\nsignificant progress towards fulfilling the Cairo \r\nProgramme of Action in the past 15 years. According \r\nto a report published by the United Nations Population \r\nFund (UNFPA), more births are now attended by \r\nskilled health personnel. In East Asia, the percentage of \r\ninfants delivered with the assistance of skilled \r\npersonnel has risen from 71 per cent in 1990 to \r\n98 percent in 2006 — a tremendous accomplishment. \r\nIn Latin America and the Caribbean, the increase over \r\nthe same period was from 68 per cent to 86 per cent, \r\nand in North Africa, from 45 per cent to 79 per cent. \r\nMore women and couples are choosing to plan the size \r\nof their families, space their pregnancies and choose \r\nthe number of their children. The use of modern \r\ncontraception has increased worldwide, from about \r\n47 per cent of women of reproductive age in 1990 to \r\n56 per cent in 2007.  \r\n Infants and children are also healthier. Infant \r\nmortality has declined in every region. In South and \r\nCentral Asia, there were 80 deaths per 1,000 live births \r\nin the period from 1990 to 1995. UNFPA estimates that \r\nthis rate declined to 56 deaths per 1,000 live births for \r\nthe period from 2005 to 2010. In sub-Saharan Africa, \r\nthe decline was from 109 to 89 deaths per 1,000 live \r\nbirths over the same period.  \r\n The United States was heartened that so many \r\ndelegations took a strong interest and actively \r\nparticipated in the forty-second session of the \r\nCommission on Population and Development last \r\nMarch, which focused on the ICPD and produced a \r\nhighly substantive outcome document. That document \r\nreaffirmed the commitment of Member States to the \r\nICPD Programme of Action without qualification and \r\nprovided clarity on important commitments. The \r\ndocument included an unprecedented emphasis on \r\nhuman rights and a new commitment to comprehensive \r\neducation on sexuality and gender equality, a call for \r\naccess to reproductive health commodities and services \r\nfor adolescents, an assertion of the importance of \r\nintegrating programmes that address HIV with sexual \r\nand reproductive health and a strong multilateral \r\nstatement that the ICPD Programme of Action is \r\nintegrally related to the achievement of the Millennium \r\nA/64/PV.18  \r\n \r\n09-55501 18 \r\n \r\nDevelopment Goals. We look forward to working \r\ntowards the implementation of these commitments.  \r\n The United States was particularly pleased by the \r\noutcome document’s strong focus on youth education \r\nand services. Many developing countries, including \r\nthose struggling to meet their Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goal commitments, are grappling with \r\nunprecedented surges in their youth populations. This \r\nis putting tremendous new strains on health and \r\neducation infrastructure, including that related to \r\nfamily planning and maternal and child health and \r\nsurvival. \r\n Much work remains to be done to realize the \r\npromise of Cairo. It is also clear that much more \r\nprogress needs to take place in fulfilling Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goal 5, which calls for a two-thirds \r\nreduction in maternal mortality by 2015.  \r\n Every minute of every day, a woman dies from \r\nconditions related to pregnancy or childbirth. This \r\namounts to 530,000 deaths annually. Women, girls and \r\ntheir babies still die every day as a result of \r\npregnancies that are too early, a lack of skilled medical \r\npersonnel, inadequate spacing of births or insufficient \r\npost-natal care. For every death, 20 or more women \r\nsuffer from injury, infection and disease. The dire \r\nproblem of maternal mortality is particularly grave in \r\ncertain regions where, according to the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Fund for Women (UNIFEM), as many as \r\none in 10 women die from pregnancy-related causes. \r\nAs I have just mentioned, infant mortality in \r\nsub-Saharan Africa remains at an unacceptably high \r\nrate of 89 deaths per 1,000 live births.  \r\n UNFPA data shows that pregnancy is the leading \r\ncause of death in teenage girls in developing countries. \r\nGirls ages 15 to 19 are twice as likely to die from \r\npregnancy-related complications as women in their \r\n20s, while girls under 15 are five times more likely to \r\ndie. These deaths of mothers occur even though the \r\nmeans for preventing maternal mortality are cost-\r\neffective and well-known, including skilled birth \r\nattendance, birth spacing and prenatal care and \r\nnutrition. The world needs to take additional action to \r\nprovide that life-saving care. President Obama, \r\nSecretary Clinton and Ambassador Rice have made it \r\nclear that the United States strongly supports human \r\nrights, women’s rights and reproductive rights, as well \r\nas universal access to reproductive health and family \r\nplanning.  \r\n The United States has a strong history of \r\nsupporting family planning as part of its foreign \r\nassistance programmes. Through the United States \r\nAgency for International Development (USAID), the \r\nUnited States provided family planning assistance to \r\nover 50 countries in 2009, including 35 to 40 per cent \r\nof donor-supplied contraceptives to the developing \r\nworld. USAID also supports the Demographic and \r\nHealth Surveys Project, which provides essential \r\ninformation about family planning and health dynamics \r\nin many countries. United States Government \r\nprogrammes have also trained more than half a million \r\nmedical professionals, including clinic supervisors and \r\nadministrators, physicians and community-based \r\nworkers, so that the advances in reproductive health \r\nwill belong to, and remain in, the host country. Modern \r\ncontraceptive use prevalence rates increased from 24 to \r\n38 per cent on average in 36 countries receiving \r\nassistance from the United States. From 1990 to 2000, \r\nthe percentage of contraceptive users increased in \r\nevery region. The United States is also funding UNFPA \r\nand strongly supports its life-saving work.  \r\n In May of this year, President Obama announced \r\nthe United States Global Health Initiative — a six-year, \r\n$63 billion effort that emphasizes global health as an \r\nessential element of United States foreign policy. In his \r\nannouncement, President Obama said that we cannot \r\nfix every problem, but that we have a responsibility to \r\nprotect the health of our people, while saving lives, \r\nreducing suffering and supporting the health and \r\ndignity of people everywhere. Reproductive health and \r\nfamily planning are essential aspects of that effort. \r\n As the United States moves forward on this \r\ninitiative, we are pleased to join with the international \r\ncommunity in commemorating the fifteenth \r\nanniversary of the ICPD and re-endorsing its \r\nProgramme of Action. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Praveen Mishra, Secretary for \r\nHealth and Population of Nepal. \r\n Mr. Mishra (Nepal): I should like to make this \r\nstatement on behalf of The Honourable Khadka \r\nBahadur Bashyal, Minister of State for Health and \r\nPopulation of the Government of Nepal, whose \r\npresence here I would like to recognize.  \r\n First of all, I would like to extend my special \r\nthanks to the President of the General Assembly for \r\norganizing this commemorative meeting on the \r\n A/64/PV.18\r\n \r\n19 09-55501 \r\n \r\nfifteenth anniversary of the holding of the landmark \r\nInternational Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment (ICPD), held in Cairo in 1994. \r\n The Conference addressed broad issues \r\nconcerning the interrelationships between population, \r\nsustained economic growth, health, education, \r\neconomic status and the empowerment of women. The \r\nProgramme of Action (see A/CONF.171/13/Rev.1) that \r\nwas adopted in Cairo is a forward-looking plan that \r\ncalls for action at various levels, including a strategic \r\nfocus at the national level. \r\n The implementation of the Cairo Programme of \r\nAction would contribute directly to the achievement of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to reduce \r\npoverty, hunger, poor health and HIV/AIDS and \r\npromote gender equality. \r\n Some successes have been achieved in translating \r\nthe commitments we made into policies and action \r\nprogrammes, but much remains to be done. At this \r\npoint in time, we believe that the best way to \r\ncommemorate the ICPD is to carry out a pragmatic and \r\nconstructive analysis of achievements, constraints and \r\nlessons learned so as to enrich and accelerate the \r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action. \r\n There is no doubt that the goal of Cairo remains \r\nas relevant now as it was then. Despite progress on \r\nmany fronts, more than a billion people still live in \r\nextreme poverty, which is generally associated with \r\nlarge family size, low use of family planning methods, \r\nlow educational levels and poor nutrition. All of these \r\nfactors work against the goals of the ICPD. \r\n Least developed countries such as Nepal are \r\nfacing formidable challenges to delivering population \r\nand health-care services. Nepal has undertaken various \r\nmeasures to implement the commitments undertaken in \r\nCairo, including the adoption of a national population \r\npolicy to reduce the population growth rate and \r\nregulate migration. In addition, Nepal has focused on \r\nincreasing income-generating activities and improving \r\nwomen’s status and easy access to basic education and \r\nreproductive health and family planning services. We \r\nhave increased our health budget by about 15 to 20 per \r\ncent each year over the past three years. We are \r\nenhancing the governance of the health sector so that \r\nquality health care reaches the people of the remote \r\nmountains and villages of Nepal. \r\n We have integrated the ICPD Programme of \r\nAction and the MDGs into our poverty reduction \r\nstrategy paper. Similarly, our three-year interim \r\ndevelopment plan also continues to address poverty \r\nreduction goals, with a focus on social inclusion and \r\nwomen’s empowerment, equity and access to and \r\nutilization of health-care services, thus complementing \r\nthe goals of the ICPD. \r\n Some positive indicators have emerged in Nepal. \r\nOverall poverty and human development have \r\nimproved significantly in the recent past. The \r\npercentage of people living below the absolute poverty \r\nline has fallen to 31 per cent from 42 per cent. This has \r\nbeen possible due to an increase in wages, urbanization \r\nand the inflow of remittances from migrants. \r\nFurthermore, Nepal’s human development index has \r\nslightly improved, although it still remains very low. \r\n Despite various challenges, including the decade-\r\nlong internal conflict that we are now resolving \r\npeacefully, Nepal is making steady progress in health \r\ncare. We are on course to meet the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals related to child survival and \r\nreducing maternal mortality. In the past decade, we \r\nhave halved both the number of maternal deaths and \r\ndeaths of children under the age of five. \r\n The ICPD Programme of Action recognized that \r\neducation for girls is a best practice for development. \r\nVarious literacy campaigns and scholarship \r\nprogrammes, especially for the poor, dalits and \r\nvulnerable and marginalized people, has helped to \r\nimprove the literacy rate to some extent, although the \r\nschool dropout rate is still high. There has also been a \r\nsubstantial reduction in the country’s fertility rate in \r\nthe past decade. The Nepal Demographic and Health \r\nSurvey showed a total fertility rate for Nepal of 3.1, \r\nalthough in rural areas it is still very high. \r\n Safe motherhood is one of the most important \r\ncomponents of reproductive health, and the ICPD \r\naccorded it high importance. Three major strategies \r\nhave been adopted in Nepal in that regard, namely, \r\npromoting birth preparedness and the availability of \r\ntransportation and blood supplies; encouraging \r\ninstitutional delivery; and expanding 24-hour \r\nemergency obstetric care devices at select public health \r\nfacilities in every district. \r\n The maternal mortality ratio is still very high, at \r\n281 per 100,000 live births. In order to solve problems \r\nassociated with complications from pregnancy, the \r\nA/64/PV.18  \r\n \r\n09-55501 20 \r\n \r\nconcept of basic and comprehensive emergency \r\nobstetric care is being implemented at primary health-\r\ncare centres, health posts and hospitals. There has been \r\na progressive reduction in the child and infant \r\nmortality rates during recent years. However, the \r\nneonatal mortality rate remains high. \r\n The Government has given priority to \r\nreproductive health services and rights in our three-\r\nyear interim plan and in Nepal’s Health Sector \r\nProgramme-Implementation Plan. It has announced \r\nfree health-care services up to district-level hospitals \r\nand free maternity care in all health institutions. The \r\nGovernment has recognized uterine prolapse as a major \r\nhealth problem and devoted resources to prevent it \r\nthrough specialized camps in select districts that have a \r\nhigh prevalence rate of this condition. \r\n In Nepal, the pace of change in demographic \r\nindicators is slow. The country’s population is largely \r\nrural, illiterate, poor and young. There is an urgent \r\nneed to build national capacity to ensure that young \r\npeople benefit from the development process. \r\nAddressing young people’s issues through the ICPD by \r\nmaking the most of their potential is a challenging \r\nissue. \r\n We have been implementing the Beijing \r\nDeclaration and Platform for Action, as well as our \r\nnational action plans on the Convention on the \r\nElimination of All Forms of Discrimination against \r\nWomen and on combating the trafficking of girls. \r\nDiscriminatory laws have been amended. Gender focal \r\npoints have been established in ministries and at the \r\nNational Women’s Commission. Support has been \r\nprovided in skill development for single women for \r\ntheir social and economic empowerment. Mechanisms \r\nrelating to gender budgeting have been initiated. The \r\ninvolvement of women in the formulation and \r\nimplementation of local development programmes has \r\nbeen institutionalized. The Parliament has passed a \r\nresolution stating that women’s participation must be at \r\n33 per cent in all State mechanisms. Currently, one \r\nthird of Nepal’s 601 National Constituent Assembly \r\nmembers are women. \r\n Nepal has achieved a lot in terms of human \r\ndevelopment and gender indicators. The gender \r\ndevelopment index has improved and female-male \r\ndisparities have been reduced. The progress in \r\nincreasing women’s access to literacy education and \r\nhealth-care services has been significant, yet disparities \r\nbetween men and women, castes and ethnic groups \r\nremain. The Government has prepared a long-term \r\npopulation perspective plan for the period 2010 to \r\n2031, which will serve as a key guide for \r\nmainstreaming ICPD issues in sectoral plans, policies \r\nand programmes. \r\n I take this opportunity to acknowledge the \r\nimportant role of the United Nations Population Fund \r\nin promoting and ensuring access to and utilization of \r\nreproductive health services and rights, including by \r\nproviding voluntary family planning programmes, \r\npromoting gender equality and empowerment, \r\neliminating gender-based violence, strengthening \r\nintegrated health management information systems, \r\nand supporting the carrying out of population census \r\nfor the production of quality sociodemographic data. \r\n We are acutely aware that the present global \r\nfinancial crisis makes our task of providing basic \r\nreproductive health care to our citizens much more \r\ndifficult, but long-term and predictable financing is a \r\nmust to help developing countries, especially the least \r\ndeveloped and those emerging from conflict, \r\ncomplement their national endeavours to meet the \r\nhealth-related Millennium Development Goals. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Switzerland. \r\n Mr. Maurer (Switzerland) (spoke in French): \r\nFifteen years ago, the International Conference on \r\nPopulation and Development marked a historic break \r\nwith the traditional discourse on population issues. In \r\nplacing individuals and their rights at the centre of the \r\nanalysis of population dynamics, the Cairo consensus \r\nendorsed a paradigm change, thus opening the way for \r\nan approach based on the dignity and general well-\r\nbeing of human beings. \r\n In many respects, the consensus embodied in the \r\nCairo Programme of Action (see A/CONF.171/13/Rev.1) \r\nremains a model of vision and justice, in terms not only \r\nof analysis, but also of action. Whoever takes the time to \r\nreread the Programme of Action cannot help but be \r\ninspired by the deeply humanistic spirit of its contents. \r\n I should like, in this connection, to return to \r\nwhat, in the view of my Government, constitutes the \r\nprincipal achievements of Cairo. In terms of \r\nreproductive rights and health, the Programme of \r\nAction recognizes the fundamental right of all couples \r\nand individuals to freely and responsibly decide on the \r\n A/64/PV.18\r\n \r\n21 09-55501 \r\n \r\nnumber of children they desire and on the spacing of \r\ntheir births. This recognition of the freedom to choose \r\nas a fundamental determining factor of reproductive \r\nhealth represents a historic breakthrough. \r\n The Programme of Action highlights the need to \r\nensure universal access to basic health services, to \r\ninvolve communities in health-care policy planning \r\nand to develop maternal health services within the \r\nscope of primary health-care services. Finally, with \r\nregard to gender equality, the Programme of Action \r\nrecognizes that the empowerment of women and the \r\nimprovement of their status in political, social, \r\neconomic and health-care terms constitute essential \r\nconditions for sustainable development. \r\n Those are the central elements, and we believe \r\nthat no new element has emerged since consensus was \r\nreached on this text that would justify reopening the \r\ndebate on its comprehensive and ambitious contents. \r\nThat is why we must protect the achievements of Cairo \r\nfrom the erosion wrought by time. \r\n I have spoken of a text that is ambitious; is it, \r\nperhaps, too ambitious? This question is justified in \r\nview of the difficulties encountered in meeting its \r\nobjectives and of the intensity of the efforts that we \r\nwill have to make if we are determined to reach them \r\nin due time. Given the limited time and means at our \r\ndisposal, what should our priorities be? \r\n Today, we know that responding to the unmet \r\nneeds for family planning would be sufficient to reduce \r\nby one third the global rate of maternal mortality by \r\navoiding unwanted pregnancies and the dangerous \r\nabortions in which they often result. This is why we \r\nmust provide the 200 million women who, at present, \r\nwould like to delay or avoid another pregnancy with \r\nthe assurance that they can avail themselves of \r\neffective and safe methods of contraception. \r\n In some regions of the world, the complications \r\nthat arise during pregnancy or delivery are still the \r\nmost frequent cause of death among women. That is \r\nwhy we must guarantee access to primary health-care \r\nservices for women, with the possibility of obtaining \r\nemergency obstetrical care if needed. \r\n Finally, despite some apparent success, for \r\ninstance in school enrolment, glaring disparities persist \r\nbetween the sexes when it comes to the decision-\r\nmaking power of women and the quality of their \r\nsources of income. That is why we must strengthen the \r\njudicial, political and socio-economic mechanisms for \r\nguaranteeing the participation of women in decision-\r\nmaking processes and ensuring that their work is \r\nadequately remunerated. \r\n In conclusion, I should like, on behalf of my \r\nGovernment, to take this occasion to applaud the \r\nunique and irreplaceable work of the United Nations \r\nPopulation Fund in favour of the principles and \r\nobjectives of the Cairo Programme of Action. Be it on \r\nthe level of promotion, acceptance of or support for the \r\nimplementation of the Programme, the Fund has \r\nalways excelled in its role as the primary partner of \r\nGovernments. Switzerland would like to reiterate its \r\nsupport for the United Nations Population Fund and to \r\nassure it of our continued commitment to the Cairo \r\nAgenda. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Kazakhstan. \r\n Mrs. Aitimova (Kazakhstan): As we gather today to \r\ncommemorate the fifteenth anniversary of the \r\nInternational Conference on Population and Development \r\n(ICPD), the relevance and topicality of that Conference \r\nseem as evident as when the States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations made their unanimous pledge to progress \r\non population, development, gender equality and the \r\nempowerment of women in the 20-year ICPD Programme \r\nof Action (see A/CONF.171/13/Rev.1). \r\n On behalf of the Republic of Kazakhstan, I \r\nshould like to begin with some words of appreciation \r\nto the Executive Director of the United Nations \r\nPopulation Fund (UNFPA), Ms. Thoraya Ahmed \r\nObaid, and to UNFPA staff, both at headquarters and in \r\nthe field, for their devoted work in assisting \r\nGovernments, civil society and local communities \r\nworldwide to achieve the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) and further implement the ICPD.  \r\n We highly appreciate UNFPA assistance to \r\nKazakhstan in ensuring universal access to high quality \r\nreproductive health care, HIV prevention, sexual health \r\neducation and youth-friendly services. UNFPA \r\ntechnical assistance in mainstreaming data related to \r\npopulation census and dynamics, reproductive health \r\nand gender equality into the national Human \r\nDevelopment for All agenda has helped my \r\nGovernment to ensure adequate demographic and other \r\ndevelopment strategies. UNFPA policy advocacy and \r\npublic awareness-raising on reproductive health \r\ncare — including family planning, equal gender rights, \r\nA/64/PV.18  \r\n \r\n09-55501 22 \r\n \r\nsupport for emergency preparedness, gender budgeting \r\nand resource mobilization — are interlinked with \r\nKazakhstan’s national development strategies and \r\ncompetitiveness agenda targeting the most vulnerable. \r\n Although Kazakhstan has entered the tier of \r\nmiddle-income countries, access to certain health and \r\nsocial services for our population remains at a lower \r\nlevel than that required to meet all current needs and \r\ncosts and to attain long-term population and \r\ndevelopment objectives. As elsewhere, Kazakhstan has \r\nadopted and gradually implemented various national \r\npolicies, laws and programmes in full compliance with \r\nthe MDGs and the Cairo consensus. \r\n Strengthening the progress made on three \r\nMDGs — eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, \r\nachieve universal primary education, and promote \r\ngender equality and empower women — and \r\nmainstreaming environmental sustainability and \r\nsocially oriented development policies in all national, \r\nsectoral and local strategies and processes are the \r\ncornerstones of our State policy. Results-oriented and \r\npeople-centred programme interventions are being \r\ncarried out throughout the country — especially in the \r\nnotorious Semipalatinsk Nuclear Polygon area, in \r\neastern Kazakhstan, and in the Aral Sea basin, in \r\nsouthern Kazakhstan — with a particular focus on the \r\ncomprehensive recording of childhood diseases, \r\nreducing maternal and child mortality and achieving \r\nuniversal access to sexual and reproductive health \r\neducation and services. \r\n Stable economic growth, social development, \r\nenvironmental protection and an optimal balance \r\namong them are important preconditions for the \r\nimplementation of international and national \r\ncommitments in the economic, social and related \r\nfields. However, the ongoing world financial and \r\neconomic crisis has had an adverse impact on national \r\ndevelopment trends and on the ability of countries to \r\nstrengthen and adequately fund their social protection \r\nsystems. This undoubtedly raises valid concerns about \r\npossible deterioration across all development \r\nindicators, particularly social determinants. \r\n Kazakhstan regards unacceptably high maternal \r\nand child mortality rates — two interrelated MDGs in \r\nthe area of health — as its highest priorities. Since \r\n2008, Kazakhstan has applied the World Health \r\nOrganization definition of live births. Despite the fact \r\nthat this measure is aimed at improving infant \r\nmortality data, our country is seeking to improve \r\nmonitoring and to bring its health-care system in line \r\nwith internationally agreed standards. This step is \r\nbeing taken to help us achieve MDG 4: reduce child \r\nmortality. Kazakhstan already has evidence of positive \r\ntrends in that area.  \r\n Understanding the importance of sustainable \r\ninvestments in women and children, Kazakhstan \r\nsolicits donor funds and financial assistance from \r\ndevelopment partners to help cover programme costs in \r\norder to meet the country’s new development needs.  \r\n The timely realignment of programme \r\ninterventions and the redirection of adequate State \r\nfunds have proved to be keys to the successful \r\nimplementation of health-related national programmes \r\nand strategies. In recent years, the Government has \r\nredoubled its efforts to support women and children, \r\nproviding one-time benefits for childbirth and other \r\nchild-care benefits. The system of compulsory social \r\ninsurance to cover pregnancy, childbirth and health \r\ncare for children less than one-year old was introduced \r\nin 2008. Moreover, beginning on 1 July 2009, the \r\nrevised national budget for 2009-2011 provides for \r\nsustained increases in all social benefits and guarantees \r\nfor the population. A 9-per cent annual increase in \r\nState social benefits is scheduled. In total, the \r\nallocations for pensions and other benefits will have \r\nnearly doubled from 2008 to 2011.  \r\n The Government of my country attaches great \r\nimportance to the recently adopted resolution 63/311, \r\non a more effective and relevant United Nations entity \r\nfocused on gender equality and women’s \r\nempowerment. We strongly believe that the new \r\ncomposite entity, with adequate institutional capacity, \r\nwill be able to become a stronger advocate for gender \r\nrights and interests and women’s empowerment, to \r\npromote effective system-wide gender mainstreaming, \r\nand to be a better fund-raiser for this key aspect of \r\ndevelopment. \r\n The poor and vulnerable worldwide are more \r\npowerless than ever, and therefore should remain the \r\nfocus of national poverty reduction strategies and \r\ninterventions. In that context, the legal empowerment \r\nof the poor — especially women — in the community \r\nand workplace is becoming essential for the effective \r\nstrengthening of national strategies aimed at poverty \r\nreduction and sustained economic growth. Each \r\ncountry has primary responsibility for its own \r\n A/64/PV.18\r\n \r\n23 09-55501 \r\n \r\ndevelopment and for the strengthening of its social \r\nsector, and increasing opportunities for citizens is \r\ndirectly linked to effective poverty eradication. \r\n In the context of the transition towards the \r\nprinciple of global responsibility for the promotion of \r\ndevelopment, Kazakhstan shares the view of many that \r\nit is important to honour all previously announced \r\ninternational commitments in the area of financing for \r\ndevelopment, including the ICPD Programme of \r\nAction. Global, regional and subregional response \r\nmeasures should include the strengthening of \r\ninternational cooperation and the establishment of \r\ninnovative forms of partnership in the area of \r\ndevelopment financing — especially now, on the eve of \r\nthe 2010 MDG summit. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that the \r\ncurrent pressing challenges to the international \r\ncommunity require ever greater political will and \r\nflexibility on the part of all United Nations Member \r\nStates in engaging in truly global and regional \r\ncooperation that benefits all. Kazakhstan therefore \r\nreaffirms its commitment to the ideals of the \r\nInternational Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment, as well as to their implementation. We \r\nlook forward to continuing our fruitful work with \r\nUNFPA through its newly opened subregional office in \r\nAlmaty, as well as at the bilateral and multilateral \r\nlevels. \r\n The Acting President: I call on the \r\nrepresentative of Cuba. \r\n Mr. Núñez Mosquera (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nToday, we recall the efforts of the international \r\ncommunity 15 years ago, when we set ourselves \r\ncommendable goals to improve the lives of all people \r\nand to pursue development. The 1994 International \r\nConference on Population and Development was a \r\nturning point in international debates on population. It \r\naddressed social, political and cultural issues having a \r\nmajor impact on humankind, and changed the way we \r\nthink about controlling countries’ population growth as \r\na way to achieve development. \r\n We wish to refer today to the Cuban heroine \r\nVilma Espín Guillois, prominent advocate for women’s \r\nrights, who headed the Cuban delegation at the meeting \r\nin Cairo and whose efforts were crucial to the inclusion \r\nof the universal right to reproductive health, safe \r\nmotherhood and gender equality in the outcome \r\ndocuments of the Conference. Fifteen years ago, the \r\nCuban fighter stated: \r\n “We attempt to blame poor people for \r\noverpopulation, the depletion of essential \r\nresources, environmental contamination and global \r\nclimate change. Are poor people the cause? \r\nObviously, it is unsustainable modes of irrational \r\nproduction and consumption that have unleashed \r\nthe global climate change and huge ecological \r\nproblems that threaten life on the planet.” \r\nHer words remain as valid as ever today.  \r\n This could have been a day for congratulation, \r\nbut it is not. As we meet here, the right to development \r\nis still an illusion for poor countries. The world’s \r\npopulation includes 1.02 billion who are starving. \r\nHIV/AIDS affects more than 36 million people. \r\nClimate change, resulting from misguided policies \r\nseeking economic growth and consumerism at any \r\nprice, is causing an increasing number of disasters. \r\n According to the most recent report of the \r\nInternational Labour Organization (ILO), in 2009, \r\nglobal unemployment could increase by between 18 \r\nand 30 million workers owing to the economic crisis, \r\nand by over 50 million if the situation continues to \r\ndeteriorate. The ILO report also maintains that, in the \r\nlatter scenario, nearly 200 million workers, mostly in \r\ndeveloping economies, could join those living in \r\nextreme poverty. The ILO message is realistic, not \r\nalarmist. \r\n Maternal mortality remains disproportionately \r\nhigh in the countries of the South. Although not \r\nnecessarily predictable, all complications can be \r\nprevented. Every minute, one woman dies; 100 women \r\nhave pregnancy-related complications; and 300 \r\nconceive without wanting or having planned their \r\npregnancy. The goal, set out in the Cairo Programme of \r\nAction, is that  \r\n “[t]he international community should strive for \r\nthe fulfilment of the agreed target of 0.7 per cent \r\nof the gross national product for overall official \r\ndevelopment assistance and endeavour to \r\nincrease the share of funding for population and \r\ndevelopment programmes commensurate with the \r\nscope and scale of activities required to achieve \r\nthe objectives and goals of the Programme of \r\nAction” (A/CONF.171/13/Rev.1, Chapter I, \r\nannex, 14.11).  \r\nA/64/PV.18  \r\n \r\n09-55501 24 \r\n \r\nThat goal remains unfulfilled, while the tendency to \r\nallocate vast resources to war and destruction \r\ncontinues. In 2008, spending on military weapons and \r\nforces was $1.4 billion. \r\n The global crisis is not limited to the financial \r\nsector. It is economic and social. It is a global \r\nphenomenon with deep structural roots that negatively \r\naffect the rise in unemployment and poverty, and thus \r\nthe lives and well-being of billions of human beings, in \r\nparticular women, who already represent the majority \r\nof the poor. Globalization has not reduced poverty. On \r\nthe contrary, poverty has increased in recent years and \r\nwill continue to do so. \r\n The cause of the current economic and social \r\nimbalances is the lack of political will to reach a fair \r\nand balanced international economic order that \r\nresolves the largest and most complex problems of the \r\nworld’s people, above all those of developing \r\ncountries. Although, in terms of demographic transition \r\nand human development indices, some Latin American \r\ncountries are in advanced demographic transition, they \r\nstill need international support and cooperation. The \r\nLatin American region has not escaped the scourge of \r\npoverty. We note with regret that the Latin American \r\nregion remains the most unequal in the world. \r\nAccording to data of the Economic Commission for \r\nLatin America and the Caribbean, the current global \r\ncrisis will result in a 15-per cent increase in poverty \r\nthis year. It is almost predictable that women and girls, \r\nwho today are the poorest of the poor, will continue to \r\nsee their health deteriorate. \r\n In talking about population and development, I \r\ncannot fail to note the impact of the unilateral coercive \r\npolicies of the imperial Power. My country’s \r\ndevelopment has been hampered and, for over five \r\ndecades, its population has suffered the negative \r\nimpact of the commercial, economic and financial \r\nembargo imposed against Cuba by the United States of \r\nAmerica. That hostile policy is inhuman and \r\ncontravenes international law and the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n Cuba’s population policies are based in a vision \r\nof development as a comprehensive economic and \r\nsocial process. That policy is founded on the principle \r\nthat economic growth without progress and social \r\njustice does not lead to real development or to full \r\nequity and social justice. With great effort and the \r\nsupport of its population, Cuba has made progress in \r\nreducing maternal and infant mortality, ensures \r\nreproductive rights for all citizens without distinction, \r\nand continues to strive to prevent and control \r\nHIV/AIDS, while consistently elevating the cultural \r\nfooting of the Cuban people. \r\n The Cairo Programme of Action remains relevant \r\nas a basis for achieving the population goals on which \r\ndevelopment depends. Once again, we reiterate the will \r\nof the Cuban Government to meet its international \r\ncommitments on population and development and to \r\nfoster South-South cooperation. We appeal for an end \r\nof hegemonies and for the elimination of obstacles that \r\nhinder the equal development of all. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on the \r\nrepresentative of the People’s Republic of China. \r\n Mr. Zhang Yesui (China) (spoke in Chinese): \r\nFifteen years ago, the International Conference on \r\nPopulation and Development (ICPD) was convened in \r\nEgypt. Representatives of 179 countries gathered in \r\nCairo to sign the Programme of Action (see \r\nA/CONF.171/13/Rev.1), which identified goals and \r\nestablished timetables. ICPD was a milestone in the \r\nhistory of population and development, setting the \r\ndirection of our efforts.  \r\n Today, we are holding this plenary meeting to \r\ncommemorate the fifteenth anniversary of ICPD, \r\nreview the path that we have trodden over the past \r\n15 years, exchange our experience in population and \r\ndevelopment, and jointly explore ways to respond to \r\nchallenges in the field of population. This meeting is of \r\ngreat significance. It will certainly give a strong \r\nimpetus to the effort to achieve the goals contained in \r\nthe Programme of Action and the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). \r\n Since the convening of ICPD 15 years ago, in an \r\naim to realize the goals set by the Programme of \r\nAction, Governments have formulated plans for \r\npopulation development in accordance with their \r\nspecific economic, societal, resource and \r\nenvironmental situations, and have registered \r\nsignificant achievements in these fields. We are pleased \r\nto note that the past 15 years have witnessed a decline \r\nin the global birth rate, an increase in life expectancy, a \r\ndecrease in maternal mortality, and growing literacy. \r\nPeople now have more choices in their access to \r\nreproductive health care, and the principles and the \r\nspirit advocated by ICPD have been widely \r\ndisseminated and supported.  \r\n A/64/PV.18\r\n \r\n25 09-55501 \r\n \r\n The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) \r\nhas done a remarkable job to promote and achieve the \r\ngoals of the ICPD Programme of Action and the \r\nMDGs. I take this opportunity to express our sincere \r\nappreciation for the great contributions of UNFPA \r\nExecutive Director Thoraya Obaid and her staff. \r\n While celebrating our achievements to date, we \r\nmust not lose sight of the fact that many difficulties \r\nand challenges remain to be overcome in order to \r\nrealize the goals contained in the Programme of Action \r\nand the MDGs. Problems such as poverty, disease, \r\nageing and gender inequality still plague the \r\ndevelopment of the world’s people, especially those in \r\ndeveloping countries. The financial and economic \r\ncrisis has severely stricken many developing countries \r\nanew, seriously hampering their capacity to address \r\npopulation and development issues. \r\n The international community should seize the \r\nopportunity offered by the commemoration of the \r\nfifteenth anniversary of the ICPD to step up its \r\npopulation efforts and strengthen international \r\ncooperation in that field. Developed countries should \r\nhonour their commitments and provide more assistance \r\nto help developing countries overcome their difficulties \r\nin achieving the ICPD goals and the MDGs. In that \r\nway, people in every country and every region of the \r\nworld can enjoy equal opportunities for development, \r\nthus creating conditions conducive to the common \r\nprosperity of humankind. \r\n The Chinese Government has always \r\nconscientiously implemented the ICPD goals and the \r\nMDGs, and has included efforts to implement those \r\ngoals in its work in the field of population and \r\ndevelopment. After years of unremitting effort, China \r\nhas realized rapid economic growth and the \r\ncomprehensive development of its population, thus \r\ncontributing positively to the stabilization of world \r\npopulation growth. As a developing country with a \r\npopulation of 1.3 billion, China wishes to take this \r\nopportunity to share its experience in the field of \r\npopulation and development, as its contribution to the \r\njoint efforts of the international community to realize \r\nthe ICPD goals and the MDGs. \r\n First, we have adhered to our basic national policy \r\nof family planning and sought to address the question of \r\npopulation in an integrated manner. Based on its specific \r\nnational situation, the Chinese Government has \r\nsteadfastly implemented its national family-planning \r\npolicy. After many years of hard work, China’s \r\npopulation growth rate has fallen to 5.08 per thousand in \r\n2008; the maternal mortality rate has been reduced to \r\n36.6 per 100,000; and there has been marked \r\nimprovement in health care, education and social \r\nsecurity. \r\n Secondly, we have always worked to promote \r\ngender equality and to meet people’s needs for family \r\nplanning and reproductive health care. Gender equality \r\nis an important policy of the Chinese Government, and \r\nwe take an integrated approach in trying to rectify the \r\nunbalanced sex ratio of babies through initiatives such \r\nas “Caring for Girls”. We are providing regular \r\nprenatal and perinatal care to pregnant women and new \r\nmothers, and well-baby care to children under three. \r\nThe Chinese Government also places great emphasis \r\non combating HIV/AIDS and has effectively curbed \r\nthe spread of the AIDS pandemic. \r\n Thirdly, we have endeavoured to facilitate orderly \r\nmovements and a reasonable distribution of the \r\npopulation and to enable migrants to have equal access \r\nto public services. In recent years the number of \r\nmigrants in China has reached 147 million annually. In \r\nareas with large concentrations of migrants, we have \r\nestablished effective forms of regional cooperation, \r\norganized various methods for providing care for \r\nmigrant workers from rural areas, continuously \r\nexpanded free family planning services for migrants and \r\neffectively protected their legitimate rights and interests. \r\n Fourthly, we have always pursued a strategy of \r\nsustainable development in an effort to achieve \r\ncoordinated development of population, resources and \r\nthe environment. The Chinese Government has always \r\ntried to address the question of population in an \r\nintegrated manner and in a way that suits our country’s \r\nspecific situation. \r\n In realizing the ICPD goals and the MDGs, China \r\nalso faces numerous difficulties and challenges. In \r\nresponse to those challenges, the Chinese Government \r\nwill implement the concept of rational development in \r\na comprehensive manner. It will continue to maintain a \r\nlow birth rate; take an integrated approach to \r\naddressing the sexual imbalance of newborns; \r\nstrengthen management of and services for the migrant \r\npopulation; take active measures to respond to the \r\nquestion of an ageing population; drastically increase \r\nits inputs into education, health care, employment, \r\nsocial security and urban and rural housing; and \r\nA/64/PV.18  \r\n \r\n09-55501 26 \r\n \r\nreinforce efforts to improve people’s lives so as to \r\nensure happiness for our people. At the same time, the \r\nGovernment will continue to strengthen exchanges and \r\ncooperation with other countries in the field of \r\npopulation and development, support the work of \r\nUNFPA and contribute to our common effort to \r\npromote the realization of the ICPD goals and MDGs. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of the Islamic Republic of Iran. \r\n Mr. Al Habib (Islamic Republic of Iran): I would \r\nlike to begin by associating myself with the statement \r\nmade by the representative of the Sudan on behalf of \r\nthe Group of 77 and China. \r\n The 1994 International Conference on Population \r\nand Development (ICPD) was a turning point in global \r\nhealth-care discussions, especially in promoting the \r\nissue of reproductive health. Participants committed \r\nthemselves to a new approach regarding health and \r\npopulation development at the national level and took \r\ninto account its Programme of Action (see \r\nA/CONF.171/13/Rev.1) in developing their national \r\npolicies. Fifteen years have passed since then, and I \r\ncan proudly report on the progress my country has \r\nmade so far towards achieving the goals of the \r\nConference, while fully observing our cultural and \r\nreligious values. And here I would like to mention \r\nbriefly some of our achievements in the area. \r\n We have seen a significant drop in illiteracy, \r\nparticularly among women and people in rural areas. \r\nThe growing number of working women is paralleled \r\nby the number of girls entering university, which has \r\noutstripped the number of boys for a number of years. \r\nDissemination of public health information, especially \r\nin remote and rural areas, has helped increase public \r\nawareness and has considerably eased implementation \r\nof health policies. A system of organized information \r\ngathering is in effect and is being utilized in policy \r\ndevelopment. \r\n There has been a significant improvement in the \r\nchildren’s health-care index, while free school food \r\nprogrammes have been adopted and are being \r\nimplemented. Coverage of reliable birth control \r\nmethods has reached 60 per cent, and unmet family-\r\nplanning needs stand at less than 5.9 per cent. \r\nSignificant progress in improving maternal health care \r\nhas been made, and the MDG target for maternal health \r\nis within reach. In that regard, we have recorded a \r\n50 per cent drop in the number of unwanted \r\npregnancies. Policies based on the principles for \r\npreventing HIV/AIDS are being developed and \r\nimplemented, and care for the elderly and healthy \r\nliving for senior citizens are now on the working \r\nagendas of the relevant ministries. Last but not least, \r\nclose to universal health insurance coverage, free to \r\npoor and needy families, is now in sight. \r\n In conclusion, and based on such success stories, \r\nwe are of the view that a development-based approach \r\nto population issues, rather than one simply focused on \r\nrights, would be more conducive to our common \r\nefforts to implement the ICPD objectives. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of the Russian Federation. \r\n Mr. Maksimychev (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): The International Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment (ICPD) linked fully, for the first time, the \r\ndynamics of population with questions of sustainable \r\ndevelopment. The Cairo Programme of Action, which was \r\nthe outcome of the Conference, has served as a powerful \r\nincentive for countries of the international community, \r\nincluding Russia, to produce comprehensive national \r\npolicies for resolving demographic issues in the context \r\nof the needs for long-term economic growth and social \r\ndevelopment. \r\n We are convinced that achieving the ICPD goals \r\nwill make a substantial contribution to attaining the \r\ninternationally agreed development objectives. In \r\nparticular, we view the role of the Cairo Programme as \r\none of encouraging policies designed to improve \r\npeople’s well-being, broaden access to educational and \r\nhealth-care services and lower infant and maternal \r\nmortality. Over the last 15 years, considerable progress \r\nhas been achieved in implementing the ICPD \r\nProgramme of Action. At the same time, this progress \r\nhas not been steady, either in terms of key indicators or \r\nin terms of various groups of countries. \r\n In that regard, we believe we need to prevent, \r\ndespite the current financial and economic crisis, a \r\ndecrease in the amount of resources for programmes in \r\nthe field of population, particularly in the neediest \r\ncountries. We highlight the special roles in \r\nimplementing the Cairo Programme of Action played \r\nby the United Nations Population Fund and the United \r\nNations Commission on Sustainable Development. \r\n Regarding the demographic development of our \r\ncountry since the beginning of the 1990s, there has \r\n A/64/PV.18\r\n \r\n27 09-55501 \r\n \r\nbeen a sharp decline in population, which has assumed \r\na steady and long-term character. That decline was \r\ncaused by changes in families’ reproductive behaviour, \r\nmanifested in a considerable reduction of population \r\nrenewal and a very high mortality rate, the reasons for \r\nwhich are, in a number of cases, preventable. \r\n In order to stabilize the size of the population, the \r\nGovernment of the Russian Federation has taken active \r\nsteps to develop a national population policy. In 2007, \r\nwe adopted a draft demographic policy for the period \r\nup to 2025. That policy established a programme of \r\ncomprehensive measures to support the population in \r\nsuch fields as health care, housing and migration. \r\nDemographic policy has become a central pivotal link \r\nin the chain of our social policies. \r\n In 2006, we adopted a federal law that provides \r\nfor State support to families with children. On \r\n1 January 2010 it will be three years since the \r\nbeginning of work on the programme to promote \r\nmaternity and larger family size, including promoting \r\nthe birth of second and subsequent children. Reducing \r\nthe high mortality rate is the focus of a national project \r\ncalled “Health”, aimed at developing primary health \r\ncare. It seeks to obtain wage increases for doctors and \r\nlower- and middle-ranked primary medical service \r\npersonnel and to improve equipment and logistics for \r\nemergency medical assistance services. We have also \r\nbegun building high-tech medical and perinatal centres. \r\nWe have strengthened our preventive care and \r\nimmunization services and have considerably improved \r\nassistance for childbirth. \r\n Additionally, last year marked the start of special \r\nprogrammes for combating heart disease and road \r\ntransport accidents, which are the main culprits in \r\npremature deaths. \r\n Thanks to those measures, we have achieved \r\nconsiderable progress in reducing natural population \r\nloss. In the light of migration growth, natural loss in \r\n2008 constituted 122,000 persons, which is a lot less \r\nthan in previous years. After two years of \r\nimplementing the draft demographic policy, the birth \r\nrate in Russia has increased from 10.4 to 12.1 per \r\nthousand. In August this year, for the first time in \r\n15 years, the number of births in the country exceeded \r\nthe number of deaths. \r\n Considerable progress has been achieved in \r\nlowering infant and maternal mortality rates. Over the \r\nlast two years, infant mortality has dropped by 14 per \r\ncent and maternal by 10 per cent. In 2008, Russia \r\ncelebrated its Year of the Family. The measures held to \r\nmark that year were primarily aimed at improving the \r\nlegislative basis of our social policy, which made it \r\npossible to consolidate positive trends in supporting \r\nfamilies with regard to births and raising children, \r\ncarry out preventive work with regard to family \r\nwelfare, orphans and unsupervised children, and \r\nstrengthen social support systems for children in \r\ndifficult life situations. \r\n Considerable attention was also devoted to \r\nmeasures promoting healthy life styles, organizing \r\nfamily holidays, stays in health centres and harmonious \r\nfamily development.  \r\n An important element in the review and \r\nevaluation of progress achieved in implementing the \r\nICPD Programme of Action is a comprehensive \r\nanalysis of international migration. For many reasons, \r\nmigration plays a particular role in the achievement of \r\nRussia’s strategically necessary demographic growth. \r\nToday, an important task is to establish an overall \r\nnational migration policy that will, through legislation \r\nand institutions, meet the demands of the times. \r\n Among the priorities of the Russian migration \r\npolicy is State regulation of labour migration, aimed at \r\nstimulating a migratory influx of Russian speakers \r\nwithin the framework of the Government programme \r\nto provide assistance to promote voluntary resettlement \r\nin the Russian Federation of our compatriots living \r\nabroad and at establishing an effective system for \r\npromoting the adaptation of migrants and their \r\nintegration into Russian society. \r\n Remaining work that needs our attention includes \r\nagreements on readmission, as the most important \r\ninstrument in combating illegal migration, as well as \r\nthe establishment of the infrastructure necessary for \r\nimplementing those agreements. \r\n The Russian Federation actively supports \r\ndeveloping international dialogue on the problem of \r\ninternational migration. We are convinced that the \r\nforum established as a result of the General Assembly’s \r\nHigh-level Dialogue on International Migration and \r\nDevelopment is an important platform for an exchange \r\nof experience and for giving further momentum to the \r\nwork on resolving problems in the area of the \r\ninternational migration and development. \r\nThe meeting rose at 5.55 p.m. \r\n"
