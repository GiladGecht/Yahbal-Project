(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 48 (continued) \r\n \r\nIntegrated and coordinated implementation of  \r\nand follow-up to the outcomes of the major  \r\nUnited Nations conferences and summits in the \r\neconomic, social and related fields \r\n \r\n  Commemoration of the fifteenth anniversary of \r\nthe International Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I should like to \r\ninform the Assembly that, although the list of speakers \r\nwas closed yesterday morning, the representative of \r\nUganda has requested to participate in the debate on \r\nthis item. \r\n May I take it that it is the wish of the Assembly \r\nto include Uganda in the list? \r\n It is so decided. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to the \r\nPermanent Representative of the Kingdom of Norway. \r\n Mr. Wetland (Norway): The Cairo International \r\nConference on Population and Development (ICPD) \r\nmarked a watershed moment in that reproductive health \r\nand rights became an essential priority of development. \r\nFifteen years after the adoption of the ICPD \r\nProgramme of Action (see A/CONF.171/13/Rev.1), we \r\nnote that there has been progress in some fields, but \r\nalso that much remains to be done. \r\n After Cairo, we met in Beijing and Copenhagen, \r\nand from there we went through a sequence of \r\nimportant meetings to adopt the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) in 2000. Rightly, the \r\nrights and needs of women and children figure \r\nprominently in those Goals. The implementation of the \r\nICPD Programme of Action is crucial to achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. Looking ahead \r\ntowards the United Nations summit next year, we note \r\nthat substantial progress has been made. However, it is \r\nstriking that we have hardly made any progress at all \r\ntowards reaching MDG 5, on maternal mortality and \r\nreproductive health.  \r\n Every single minute, a woman dies somewhere in \r\nthe world as a result of pregnancy and birth-related \r\ncomplications. Almost all of those deaths could be \r\nprevented if basic health services had been available. \r\nFrom the facts available, most recently in the Human \r\nDevelopment Report, it is clear that it is possible to \r\nmake pregnancy and birth something that women need \r\nnot fear, but it is also clear that we have far to go \r\ntowards that vision. In many countries, giving birth is \r\nthe most dangerous thing a woman can do. A day that \r\nshould be a celebration of life is still for too many a \r\nday of sorrow and agony.  \r\n Why? The answer is that we have not taken the \r\nissue seriously. In many parts of the world, including \r\ndeveloped nations, women are seen as second-class \r\ncitizens. The men who make decisions do not allocate \r\nenough resources to meet the particular needs of \r\nwomen. As a result, half a million young mothers die \r\nof conditions that could have been prevented. The low \r\nA/64/PV.19  \r\n \r\n09-55571 2 \r\n \r\nstatus of women and lack of gender equality are the \r\ncauses of this disgraceful situation. We welcome in this \r\nregard resolution 63/311 establishing a new gender \r\nentity to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations \r\nto promote gender equality and the empowerment of \r\nwomen. Concerted and coordinated action is urgently \r\nneeded to make progress on MDG 5. We know what \r\nneeds to be done, but to do it requires significantly \r\nenhanced political will and leadership, community \r\nengagement and mobilization of resources.  \r\n The ICPD Programme of Action highlights “the \r\nright of men and women to be informed and to have \r\naccess to safe, effective, affordable and acceptable \r\nmethods of family planning” (A/CONF.171/13/Rev.1, \r\nChapter I, annex, para. 7.2). While a lack of \r\nreproductive health services makes sexual activity \r\nmore risky for both sexes, it does do particularly for \r\nwomen. However, we are up against ancient and deeply \r\nrooted prejudices. Our guiding principle should be that \r\nevery pregnancy is wanted.  \r\n The rights and needs of young people must also \r\nbe addressed. A stronger focus on young girls would \r\nalso reduce teenage pregnancies, a major cause of \r\ndeath among young girls. Lack of education and \r\nservices does not stop those who are young or \r\nunmarried from having sex. There is absolutely no \r\nevidence that suppressing information about sex, health \r\nand reproduction reduces sexual activity. On the \r\ncontrary, there is evidence from many countries that \r\nsex education promotes responsible sexual behaviour. \r\nFunds available for family planning have gone \r\nsubstantially down in recent years. There is now hope \r\nthat this trend can be reversed. \r\n I would also like to touch briefly on the issue of \r\nabortion. We all know that this is a sensitive issue, but \r\nregardless of this sensitivity, unsafe and clandestine \r\nabortions do happen and too often end in death. It is \r\ntherefore imperative to make sure that abortions that in \r\nfact are taking place are carried out in a safe manner. \r\nThe decriminalization of abortion is clearly needed. \r\n Governments, international agencies and civil \r\nsociety have recently started to move the health of \r\nmothers and children higher on the agenda. This has \r\ngiven hope for accelerating progress towards achieving \r\nMillennium Development Goals 4 and 5.  \r\n The new Norwegian Government of Prime \r\nMinister Jens Stoltenberg remains committed to \r\nmaintaining official development assistance at a high \r\nlevel. Today, we presented the State budget for 2010. \r\nIn it, we have allocated 1.09 per cent of next year’s \r\nestimated gross national income to development. This \r\nis an increase of 4 per cent and a sign of solidarity with \r\nthe poor parts of the world, not least in the face of the \r\nfinancial crises. The Government is also maintaining \r\nearlier commitments to take on a special responsibility \r\nregarding MDG 4 on child mortality and MDG 5 on \r\nmaternal mortality and reproductive health, and this \r\nhigh level of support will be maintained by Norway. \r\n The President: I now call on the representative \r\nof Japan. \r\n Mr. Osuga (Japan): I would like to begin by \r\nthanking you, Sir, for convening this important meeting \r\nand by congratulating the United Nations Population \r\nFund (UNFPA) and other relevant international \r\norganizations on all their efforts and achievements \r\nduring the past 15 years in implementing the \r\nProgramme of Action (see A/CONF.171/13/Rev.1) of \r\nthe International Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment (ICPD). \r\n The delegation of Japan joins others in \r\ncelebrating this fifteenth anniversary and in sharing its \r\nviews on what needs to be done in the years that \r\nremain. \r\n The world has made great progress in the field of \r\nglobal health during the past 15 years. Japan raised the \r\nissue of infectious diseases for the first time at the \r\nGroup of Eight summit it hosted in Kyushu-Okinawa \r\nin 2000, and again last year, at the Hokkaido Toyako \r\nSummit, Japan focused on the issue of global health, in \r\nparticular the importance of maternal and child health \r\nand the strengthening of health systems.  \r\n Global health is now a top priority issue being \r\ndiscussed at the highest levels. As a result, foreign aid \r\nin the field of health has doubled, under-five mortality \r\nrates have gone down, and access to HIV/AIDS \r\ntreatment has seen major progress. \r\n However, a number of international goals related \r\nto global health remain unmet. Maternal and \r\nreproductive health, in particular, requires a redoubling \r\nof our efforts. While directing sufficient funding to this \r\narea remains a major challenge, we must also take all \r\nnecessary steps to ensure that the allocated funding is \r\nused in the most effective way so that it is fully and \r\npromptly delivered to those people in need on the \r\nground. My delegation believes that the donor \r\n A/64/PV.19\r\n \r\n3 09-55571 \r\n \r\ncommunity should redouble its efforts to seek \r\nmodalities of implementation that ensure access to \r\nappropriate health care and services for all those in \r\nneed. \r\n I would like to take this opportunity to touch \r\nupon several issues pertaining to the ICPD Programme \r\nof Action, as well as to global health in general, which \r\nare of importance to Japan. \r\n First, Japan has made human security one of the \r\nmajor pillars of its foreign policy. That is because we \r\nbelieve that the human security approach provides us \r\nwith pertinent insight as well as practical tools for \r\ntackling the global issues that we face today, which \r\nrange from poverty to peacebuilding, from infectious \r\ndiseases to environmental degradation. \r\n The ICPD Programme of Action emphasizes the \r\nintegral linkages between population and development, \r\nand focuses on meeting the needs of individuals rather \r\nthan on achieving demographic targets. The ICPD \r\nProgramme of Action underscores the importance of \r\nreproductive health, as well as the empowerment of \r\nwomen in general, by providing them with more \r\nchoices through expanded access to education and \r\nhealth services, skill development and employment, \r\nand through their full involvement in decision-making \r\nprocesses at all levels. \r\n What the ICPD Programme of Action aims to \r\nachieve coincides precisely with the ultimate objective \r\nof promoting human security, namely, to build a \r\nsociety where all people are protected from threats \r\nagainst their lives, livelihoods and dignity and are \r\nempowered to realize their full potential. That is why \r\nJapan believes that the international community should \r\nreinvigorate its determination and its efforts to fulfil \r\nthe ICPD Programme of Action. \r\n The second issue I would like to raise is the \r\nstrengthening of health systems. Health, in particular \r\nthe health of the most vulnerable people in the world, \r\nis undoubtedly a major human security issue. If we are \r\nto achieve improvements in maternal and child health, \r\nreproductive health and in combating infectious \r\ndiseases, all individuals should have access to \r\nnecessary health care. To this end, national health-care \r\npolicies should be drafted with a bottom-up perspective \r\nand implemented so as to allow the allocation of \r\nlimited financial resources commensurate with the real \r\nneeds on the ground. That is the key challenge in \r\nstrengthening health systems. \r\n It is Japan’s firm belief that only qualified human \r\nresources can lay the cornerstones of sustained national \r\ncapacity and country ownership. Therefore, my \r\nGovernment intends to contribute actively to the \r\ndevelopment of human resources in the health sector of \r\ndeveloping countries. At the fourth Tokyo International \r\nConference on African Development in 2008, Japan \r\ncommitted to train up to 100,000 health-care workers \r\nand to help them to stay in the country. In order to \r\nnurture the sense of ownership of individual health \r\nworkers, Japan’s assistance will focus not only on the \r\nnumber of trainees, but also on training higher-quality \r\nhealth workers. \r\n The third and last theme I would like to \r\nemphasize is collaboration with international and civil \r\nsociety partners. International organizations, including \r\nUNFPA and the International Planned Parenthood \r\nFederation, in concert with non-governmental \r\norganizations and civil society organizations, continue \r\nto play an important role in implementing the ICPD \r\nProgramme of Action with their expertise, field-level \r\nmobility and political neutrality. Japan will continue to \r\nplace high priority on partnering with international and \r\ncivil society organizations, private foundations, the \r\ncorporate sector, academia and parliamentarians in \r\norder to contribute to the implementation of the ICPD \r\nProgramme of Action and the achievement of the \r\nrelated Millennium Development Goals.  \r\n In this regard, I would like to draw the \r\nAssembly’s attention to the 2009 Rafael M. Salas \r\nCommemorative Lecture scheduled to take place on \r\n23 November, in which Mr. Yasuo Fukuda, former \r\nPrime Minister of Japan and Chairman of the Asian \r\nForum of Parliamentarians on Population and \r\nDevelopment, will present his lecture on population \r\nand development. \r\n Finally, the delegation of Japan, as the vice-chair \r\nof the United Nations Commission on Population and \r\nDevelopment at its forty-third session and representing \r\nthe Asian regional group, looks forward to having in-\r\ndepth discussions on population and development \r\nduring the 2010 session of the Commission which will \r\nfocus on maternal and child health. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of the Netherlands. \r\n Mr. Schaper (Netherlands): I make this \r\nstatement on behalf of Burkina Faso and the \r\nNetherlands.  \r\nA/64/PV.19  \r\n \r\n09-55571 4 \r\n \r\n Let me start by thanking the organizers of this \r\nimportant meeting. \r\n This year marks the fifteenth anniversary of the \r\nInternational Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment (ICPD) and the fortieth anniversary of \r\nthe United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). It is a \r\ntime for commemoration and well-deserved \r\ncongratulations, but definitely not a time to sit back. A \r\nlot remains to be done. \r\n Fifteen years ago, representatives at the ICPD in \r\nCairo shifted the population debate away from a top-\r\ndown approach focused on population numbers to a \r\nbottom-up approach focused on human rights and \r\npeople’s individual needs. We consider this paradigm \r\nshift to be a success story. We reiterate our full support \r\nfor the Cairo consensus and the entire Programme of \r\nAction (see A/CONF.171/13/Rev.1). \r\n After the Millennium Summit, it took six years of \r\nhard work before the Cairo agenda was fully reflected \r\nin the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The \r\nMDG target on universal access to reproductive health \r\nby 2015 was not added until 2007. Regrettably, family \r\nplanning and reproductive health continue to pose \r\nchallenges. If the two MDG 5 targets on maternal \r\nhealth and on reproductive health are not achieved, the \r\nother MDGs will not be attained either. It is smart \r\neconomics to invest in MDG 5. \r\n We aim at concrete actions and results at the \r\ncountry level, but in order to achieve that we also need \r\nto place maternal and reproductive health higher on the \r\nglobal development agenda. The upcoming action-\r\nfocused High-level Meeting on MDG 5, sexual and \r\nreproductive health and rights, in Addis Ababa on \r\n26 October, co-hosted by UNFPA and the Netherlands, \r\nis one example of the efforts to do so. \r\n There is a growing awareness that population \r\nissues have long been neglected in the development \r\ndebate and in national planning. Demographic \r\ndevelopments often mean fast-growing populations, a \r\nfact that offers both opportunities and threats. Access \r\nto reproductive health services, including the widest \r\npossible choice of contraceptives, is of crucial \r\nimportance to help minimize social and economic \r\nproblems at the national and household levels. There is \r\nalso a need to strengthen the involvement of men and \r\nto increase their awareness of the importance of \r\nreproductive health services for the health of their \r\nwives, children and themselves, and consequently for \r\nmany other aspects of family life, including economic \r\nprosperity. \r\n Addressing the needs of young people is also \r\nessential. The unprecedented number of young \r\npeople — more than half of the world’s population is \r\nunder 25 years old — compels us to make their future \r\nour priority. \r\n In April this year, an international coordination \r\nmeeting on the UNFPA Global Programme to Enhance \r\nReproductive Health Commodity Security was held in \r\nBurkina Faso. The Global Programme has broken from \r\nan ad hoc technical assistance approach and moved \r\ntowards supporting countries to develop more \r\npredictable, planned and sustainable policies. Country \r\nleadership and the strengthening of national planning, \r\nfunding and logistic systems are key features in that \r\napproach, as is making commodity security an integral \r\npart of national health policies. Further efforts are \r\nneeded, including strengthening UNFPA’s capacity to \r\nprovide upstream advice and support, and sufficient \r\ndonor funding to do so. \r\n In Burkina Faso — under Government leadership \r\nand with the support of bilateral and international \r\npartners — progress has been made in several ICPD-\r\nrelated areas. For example, prenatal care has improved \r\nconsiderably, with an increase from 61 per cent in 2004 \r\nto 75 per cent in 2008; the rate of skilled attendance at \r\nchildbirth rose from 33 per cent in 2004 to 65 per cent \r\nin 2008; and the contraceptive prevalence rate evolved \r\nfrom 16 per cent in 2004 to 28 per cent in 2008. \r\n Burkina Faso continues to experience high \r\nfertility rates at 6.1 children per woman, and high \r\npopulation growth. Additionally, the unmet need for \r\nfamily planning services remains considerable at 29 \r\nper cent. There is political commitment at the highest \r\nlevel, which puts access to reproductive health and \r\nHIV/AIDS supplies at the top of the political agenda. \r\nHIV/AIDS prevalence and female genital mutilation \r\nare declining but remain high. \r\n On 1 September this year, Burkina Faso was \r\naffected by unprecedented rainfall that resulted in \r\nfloods. In Ouagadougou alone, 150,000 people lost \r\ntheir homes and all their belongings. Women, children \r\nand elderly people were severely affected. The main \r\nhospital was shut down, and its patients and services \r\nwere relocated. That situation affects mainly the \r\npoorest and will have a negative impact on the well-\r\nbeing of the population, including health and the \r\n A/64/PV.19\r\n \r\n5 09-55571 \r\n \r\ndevelopment efforts of the Government, including in \r\nsexual and reproductive health services, the need for \r\nwhich is too often overlooked in emergency responses. \r\n While thanking all partners for their prompt \r\nreaction in supporting Burkina Faso’s national \r\nendeavour to address the needs of the victims, we urge \r\nthe international community to stay mobilized and to \r\ntake concrete actions to help overcome the mid- and \r\nlong-term effects of that disaster. \r\n The Netherlands and Burkina Faso call for more \r\nalignment of the United Nations and other international \r\nactors with national policies and systems, further \r\ndecentralization, high quality human resources, the \r\nimproved communication and monitoring of \r\ndevelopment results. We welcome and support \r\nUNFPA’s active and leading role in initiatives aimed at \r\nimproving inter-agency coordination and at the \r\nharmonization of business practices and joint actions, \r\nsuch as “The Health 4” mechanism of UNFPA, the \r\nWorld Health Organization, UNICEF and the World \r\nBank. \r\n However, cooperation with other similar \r\ninitiatives and a focus on concrete results at the \r\ncountry level are urgently required. We would also \r\nunderline the importance of working with the private \r\nsector and with for-profit and not-for-profit \r\norganizations. \r\n Given today’s food and financial crises and \r\nclimate change, the visionary and holistic Cairo \r\nagenda — with its focus on people, population, \r\npoverty, the environment and the health and rights of \r\nwomen — remains more relevant than ever. We expect \r\nUNFPA to continue to lead and all Member States to \r\nhonour the promises of Cairo together. \r\n The President: I now call on the representative \r\nof Malta. \r\n Mr. Borg (Malta): It is an acknowledged fact that \r\nthe International Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment (ICPD) held in Cairo, and the fifteenth \r\nanniversary of which we are commemorating today, is \r\none of the principal achievements of the Organization. \r\n The 1994 Cairo Declaration and Programme of \r\nAction (see A/CONF.171/13/Rev.1) were reconfirmed \r\nsix years later when world leaders endorsed the \r\nMillennium Declaration and the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), which as Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon said,  \r\n “have become a universal framework for \r\ndevelopment and a means for developing \r\ncountries and their development partners to work \r\ntogether in pursuit of a shared future for all.”  \r\n Yesterday, the State Secretary of Sweden \r\naddressed this commemorative meeting on behalf of \r\nthe European Union member States. My delegation \r\nwould like to make a few remarks in addition to those \r\nof Sweden, whose statement generally reflects Malta’s \r\nposition on the ICPD and its outcome. Before doing \r\nthat, however, I would like to clarify Malta’s position \r\nwith respect to the issue of sexual and reproductive \r\nhealth and rights. \r\n As it did in Cairo 15 years ago, Malta would like \r\nto reaffirm today its position that any position taken or \r\nrecommendation regarding women’s empowerment and \r\ngender equality should not in any way create an \r\nobligation on any party to consider abortion as a \r\nlegitimate form of reproductive health right, service or \r\ncommodity. Malta continues to hold the view that any \r\ndiscussion of rights and services in connection with \r\nreproductive health cannot take place outside the \r\nframework of one of the most fundamental human \r\nrights — the right to life. \r\n Malta strongly believes that the right to life \r\nextends to the unborn child from the moment of \r\nconception, and that therefore the use of abortion as a \r\nmeans of resolving health or social problems is a denial \r\nof that right. It is within this framework of human \r\nrights — the right to life — that Malta has, over the \r\npast 15 years, placed high priority on the Cairo \r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action (see \r\nA/CONF.171/13/Rev.1). In that spirit and in fulfilment \r\nof that commitment, Malta will continue to implement \r\nthe values and objectives of the ICPD. \r\n Economic and social development continues to be \r\nan integral part and a pillar of the Cairo legacy and a \r\ndominant factor on today’s development agenda. For \r\nmany years now, United Nations Member States have \r\nworked assiduously to address the many critical issues \r\nthat the world population continues to face. The world \r\npopulation is experiencing difficult and challenging \r\ntimes. The financial and food crises, climate change, \r\ndiseases such as malaria and HIV/AIDS, the AH1N1 \r\ninfluenza pandemic, terrorism, natural disasters, the \r\ntrafficking of persons, particularly women and \r\nchildren, and the illegal trafficking of arms and drugs \r\nare all compounding the risks that our generation is \r\nA/64/PV.19  \r\n \r\n09-55571 6 \r\n \r\nfacing, and at times even threatening the very existence \r\nof our populations. Indeed, there is a prevalent \r\nrecognition that those crises and threats are \r\nmarginalizing the Cairo Programme of Action and the \r\nMDGs and could even place them beyond our reach \r\nunless a renewed effort is made by all of us to turn the \r\ntide of our current predicament in the protection of our \r\npresent and future generations. \r\n Today’s commemorative meeting comes at a time \r\nwhen we note with satisfaction the number of high-\r\nlevel conferences, interactive thematic dialogues and \r\nother events organized throughout the past year to \r\naddress the issues to which I just referred, as well as \r\nothers. Through the active participation of all \r\nstakeholders, the international community is breaking \r\nnew ground. With the direct involvement of all \r\nconcerned, we have been able to identify many of the \r\nills besetting our societies and, in many cases, have \r\nsingled out possible cures and remedies that could \r\ncontribute to a revitalization of the global economy, to \r\nthe protection and upholding of the rights of the poor \r\nand vulnerable, to the adaptation and mitigation of \r\nclimate change, to combating impunity and promoting \r\nthe rule of law, to addressing the responsibility to \r\nprotect and to strengthening democracy and good \r\ngovernance.  \r\n In addition, we, as States Members of this \r\nOrganization, have agreed in our numerous \r\ndeclarations to commit ourselves to delivering what the \r\nSecretary-General has described as “global goods” \r\nthrough a new global agreement in Copenhagen, \r\nadvancing global health, countering terrorism, \r\naddressing the needs of Africa, achieving the goal of a \r\nworld free from nuclear weapons and creating a \r\nstronger United Nations. \r\n Fifteen years ago, the Cairo Conference gave \r\nhope to those millions and millions of people around \r\nthe world who, unfortunately, continue to find \r\nthemselves in the midst of interminable unrest, \r\ndestruction, misery, poverty, internal displacement, \r\nviolence and deprivation of their basic human rights. \r\nThrough renewed and concerted efforts, we must make \r\nsure that the Cairo commitments and the MDGs are \r\nfaithfully implemented and enable our Organization to \r\ncontinue to establish itself as a major custodian of \r\nhuman endeavours for the equal and common benefit \r\nof all. That is a goal to which our countries and all \r\nstakeholders must recommit themselves on this \r\nanniversary. It is a goal that we must seek and \r\naccomplish together. It is a goal that Malta will \r\ncontinue to honour and protect. \r\n The President: I call now on the representative \r\nof Kenya. \r\n Mr. Muita (Kenya): My delegation is indeed \r\ngrateful to you, Mr. President, and to the General \r\nAssembly for convening this important meeting to \r\ncommemorate the passing of 15 years since the \r\nInternational Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment (ICPD) was held. Members will recall \r\nthat we agreed thereon a Programme of Action (see \r\nA/CONF.171/13/Rev.1) that integrated a \r\ncomprehensive range of issues related to population, \r\ndevelopment and human rights issues.  \r\n My delegation associates itself with the statement \r\nmade by the representative of the Sudan on behalf of \r\nthe Group of 77 and China. \r\n I take this opportunity to reaffirm Kenya’s \r\ncommitment to the continued implementation of the \r\nICPD Programme of Action and its key actions. Kenya \r\nhas been consistent in implementing the ICPD \r\nProgramme of Action and recognizes that its effective \r\nimplementation requires the commitment of financial \r\nresources, which have continued to decline in the face \r\nof competing priorities and the global recession. The \r\nProgramme has been useful in providing an important \r\nframework for the agenda related to population \r\ndevelopment in Kenya and is recognized as a key \r\ncomponent in the achievement of internationally \r\nagreed goals, including the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). \r\n At the national level, Kenya’s scorecard on the \r\nimplementation of the ICPD Programme of Action \r\nindicates that significant achievements have been made \r\nin all areas, particularly the development and \r\nimplementation of legal frameworks, policies, \r\nguidelines and plans of action. Critical innovative \r\ninterventions such as the Constituency Development \r\nFund, the Youth Enterprise Development Fund and the \r\nWomen Development Fund have continued to spur \r\neconomic growth and to promote job creation and \r\nparticipation at the grass-roots level throughout the \r\ncountry. Other achievements include the creation of a \r\nbudget line item for reproductive health commodities \r\nand the adoption and sustenance of free primary and \r\ntuition-free secondary education.  \r\n A/64/PV.19\r\n \r\n7 09-55571 \r\n \r\n As far as population growth is concerned, it is \r\nimportant to note that, during the 1990s and early in \r\nthis decade, Kenya made significant progress in \r\nlowering its fertility and overall population growth \r\nrates. That momentum, however, slowed somewhat \r\nduring the mid-2000s. Key demographic indicators \r\nhave stagnated, while others have deteriorated. It is \r\ntherefore uncertain whether some goals of the \r\nProgramme of Action and some MDGs will be \r\nachieved as expected. \r\n A number of challenges and constraints have \r\nbeen encountered that continue to hamper the smooth \r\nimplementation of the ICPD Programme of Action. I \r\nbelieve that these could serve as lessons from which \r\nwe could all learn. They include the failure to fully \r\nintegrate population, gender and environmental \r\nconcerns into development planning at all levels; the \r\nslow and ineffective pace of the implementation of \r\nprogrammes, particularly those meant to address \r\npoverty reduction; weak institutional capacity to \r\neffectively implement or enforce formulated policies \r\nand laws aimed at promoting gender equity and the \r\nempowerment of women; low levels of domestic \r\nresource mobilization and allocation for population and \r\nreproductive health programmes, and hence an over-\r\nreliance on donor funding; inadequate linkage of \r\nHIV/AIDS prevention strategies with care and support; \r\nand a weak institutional framework for implementing \r\nintegrated population- and health-related programmes \r\nand projects. \r\n The task ahead, particularly in the area of \r\npopulation and development is daunting, and even \r\nmore so in these challenging times. However, we \r\nalways draw inspiration from the fact that we have \r\nmade commendable progress even in the face of the \r\ntoughest of situations. The critical factors in all the \r\nmodest gains are the partnerships that have been \r\ncreated and the exemplary leadership, guidance and \r\neffective participation of all stakeholders throughout \r\nthe 15 years of implementing the ICPD outcome.  \r\n Kenya commends the United Nations for leading \r\nthe way. We especially appreciate the stewardship of \r\nthe United Nations Population Fund in the promotion \r\nof the rights of every woman, man and child to enjoy a \r\nlife of health and equal opportunity. My delegation also \r\nacknowledges the contribution that the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme, the Office for the \r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the World Food \r\nProgramme and others continue to make in Kenya’s \r\nand other developing countries’ quest to implement the \r\nProgramme of Action. In this respect, special mention \r\nneeds to be made of the focus on and positive results in \r\nthe areas of reproductive health, including HIV/AIDS \r\nprevention initiatives and advances on gender. \r\n There is profound apprehension that many \r\ncountries in sub-Saharan Africa will not attain the \r\nMillennium Development Goals by the 2015 target. In \r\nthe context of a number of MDG goals and targets, \r\nKenya shares that fear. The statistics suggest that the \r\nachievement of universal primary education, the \r\npromotion of gender parity, the empowerment of \r\nwomen and the reversal of HIV/AIDS infections by \r\n2015 is within reach, but efforts to eradicate extreme \r\nhunger and poverty, reduce child mortality and \r\nimprove maternal health continue to face considerable \r\nchallenges. \r\n Notwithstanding these challenges, the \r\nGovernment has a responsibility to deliver and be \r\naccountable. We are convinced that success will largely \r\ndepend on the individual as well as collective actions \r\nof the community of nations. The Kenya Government \r\nreaffirms its commitment to keeping its part of the \r\nbargain. We urge all other stakeholders, especially the \r\nmain development partners, to do the same. \r\n We feel that some areas require urgent follow-up. \r\nThe sustainability of HIV/AIDS funding is critical. \r\nAntiretroviral treatment is a life-long commitment; \r\ntherefore, people undergoing treatment should have \r\naccess to drugs in a sustained way. So far, funding for \r\nprevention programmes has been inadequate and \r\nshould be enhanced, since prevention is the best way to \r\nfight HIV/AIDS. Financial support for fighting \r\nHIV/AIDS should be provided in the form of grants \r\nand not loans. \r\n Kenya and other deserving developing countries \r\nshould be considered for debt relief and/or cancellation \r\nwithout conditionalities. The funds mobilized should \r\nbe channelled to priority areas that promote economic \r\ngrowth and development, including infrastructure \r\ndevelopment, increasing agricultural productivity, job \r\ncreation initiatives and improving health-care systems. \r\nThere is a need for enhanced resource allocation for the \r\nProgramme. To date, financial commitments, \r\nparticularly those undertaken by donors, have not been \r\nhonoured. Unless the international assistance rises to \r\nthe levels agreed in Cairo, ICPD goals will not be \r\nachieved. \r\nA/64/PV.19  \r\n \r\n09-55571 8 \r\n \r\n As we reflect on the achievements made in the \r\n15 years since Cairo, we must also acknowledge the \r\nmissed opportunities and inadequate response to \r\nmultiple unmet needs. We must strengthen our shared \r\ndetermination to finish what we started 15 years ago, \r\nso that in the next five years no one will be denied his \r\nor her reproductive rights. Similarly, no one should go \r\nhungry. It is therefore crucial for us to reassess the \r\nstrategies we have used to address the ICPD \r\nProgramme of Action and the MDGs. \r\n Finally, while acknowledging that we are making \r\nsignificant strides in the areas under discussion, we \r\nnote that success will be slow if we do not develop \r\nstrong partnerships among key stakeholders, including \r\ndevelopment partners, Governments, civil society and \r\nthe private sector. \r\n In this regard, my delegation calls for concerted \r\nefforts to develop joint initiatives to transfer \r\nappropriate technologies and to foster engagement with \r\nall sectors of society in order to achieve the \r\ninternationally agreed goals, including the MDGs. The \r\nKenya Government will remain engaged in this \r\nendeavour. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Pakistan. \r\n Mr. Sial (Pakistan): Fifteen years ago, we, the \r\npeople of the world, achieved an important agreement \r\nat the International Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment (ICPD) in Cairo on the link between \r\npopulation and development. The consensus reached at \r\nCairo placed individual human rights at the centre of \r\nthe development process. It also acknowledged the \r\ncentral role of women and young people in the \r\ndevelopment process. \r\n Today, as we meet to commemorate the fifteenth \r\nanniversary of this consensus, we remain conscious of \r\nthe progress made thus far and of the challenges we \r\nwill face in achieving the ICPD goals in the next five \r\nyears. We are indeed faced with increased challenges in \r\nthe wake of the current multiple global crises, \r\nincluding that of finance. \r\n My delegation aligns itself with the statement \r\nmade by the representative of the Sudan on behalf of \r\nthe Group of 77 and China. \r\n I thank the Executive Director of the United \r\nNations Population Fund (UNFPA), Ms. Thoraya \r\nObaid, for her introductory statement. I avail myself of \r\nthis opportunity to commend the role of UNFPA in the \r\nadvancement of goals and objectives related to \r\npopulation and development. UNFPA is one of the \r\nmajor sources of financial and technical assistance to \r\nthe population programmes in Pakistan. Our long-\r\nstanding partnership with UNFPA dates back to 1971, \r\nwhen UNFPA opened its first office in Pakistan. Since \r\nthen, seven country programmes have been jointly \r\nimplemented. \r\n As we all know, the hard-earned reduction in \r\nglobal poverty and efforts made towards development \r\nhave now been overshadowed by the current financial \r\ncrises. More than ever before, improvement in socio-\r\neconomic development will depend on addressing the \r\npopulation challenge. \r\n Mr. Mohamed (Maldives), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n In the area of population planning, like other \r\ndeveloping countries Pakistan faces similar challenges \r\nof internal migration, rapid urbanization, youth bulge \r\nand a high rate of unmet needs, inter alia. Pakistan’s \r\nurban population has also doubled. The focus of the \r\nGovernment’s policy, therefore, is to generate work \r\nopportunities in urban and rural areas alike. To slow \r\ndown the pace of internal migration from rural to urban \r\nareas, more work opportunities are being created in \r\nrural areas. \r\n Following the ICPD Programme of Action (see \r\nA/CONF.171/13/Rev.1) and the elaboration of \r\nPakistan’s national population policy, the main \r\nobjective of our country programme has been to lead \r\ntowards population stabilization and sustainable human \r\ndevelopment, with a focus on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and poverty reduction. \r\n Responding to the population challenge, the \r\nGovernment of Pakistan has formulated various \r\npolicies in the areas of population, health, environment \r\nand education by integrating population concerns into \r\ndevelopment strategies. Pakistan’s population policy \r\nseeks to attain a balance between population and \r\nresources. Its goals are set out in three major areas of \r\nthe ICPD: expanded access to education, particularly \r\nfor girls, reduced mortality rates and increased access \r\nto quality reproductive health services and family \r\nplanning. That policy sets out a broad framework that \r\nprovides a forward-looking vision to achieve the \r\nultimate aim of economic development by raising the \r\nquality of life for the common man and for women \r\n A/64/PV.19\r\n \r\n9 09-55571 \r\n \r\nthrough focusing on family planning under the \r\numbrella of reproductive health, especially in rural \r\nareas. The policy is the outcome of a participatory \r\nprocess and enjoys the consensus of all stakeholders, \r\nincluding non-governmental organizations and civil \r\nsociety. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to reiterate that \r\nPakistan is fully committed to the goals and objectives \r\nof the International Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment. Our objectives are clearly articulated, \r\nand we are confident and ready to accept the current \r\nchallenges and to achieve international commitments. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on the \r\nrepresentative of Turkey. \r\n Mr. Çorman (Turkey): At the outset, I would like \r\nto associate myself with the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of the European Union presidency (see \r\nA/64/PV.17). I would like to make some brief remarks \r\nin my national capacity to highlight the importance that \r\nmy Government gives to the International Conference \r\non Population and Development (ICPD). \r\n It is indeed a great pleasure to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly on the commemoration of the \r\nfifteenth anniversary of the International Conference \r\non Population and Development. The Programme of \r\nAction adopted at the Conference (see \r\nA/CONF.171/13/Rev.1), held in Cairo in 1994, remains \r\na guiding light in population and development policies, \r\nhighlighting gender equality, the empowerment of \r\nwomen, reproductive health and the need to address \r\nmaternal mortality as the road map for the \r\nempowerment and for the full and equal participation \r\nof women. \r\n Over the years, much has been achieved to attain \r\nthose goals. However, we need to make further \r\nprogress to attain the 2015 targets on gender and sexual \r\nreproductive health because, as stated in the \r\nProgramme of Action, we believe that reproductive \r\nrights are human rights. That is why my country \r\nremains a firm and dedicated supporter of the ICPD \r\nCairo agenda. The United Nations Population Fund \r\n(UNFPA) has a special responsibility in leading the \r\npromotion and implementation of that agenda. We are \r\npleased to see that UNFPA is making strong efforts to \r\nfulfil that responsibility in different parts of the world. \r\nWith only five years to 2015, we remain committed to \r\nenhancing our cooperation with concerned partners in \r\norder to achieve universal access to reproductive health \r\nand to enable women’s empowerment. \r\n Within that framework, we look forward to \r\nwelcoming to Istanbul the participants in the high-level \r\nregional meeting on maternal health — Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goal 5 — which is being organized by \r\nthe UNFPA Regional Office for Eastern Europe and \r\nCentral Asia for 11 November 2009. The aim of the \r\nmeeting is to reinforce the political and financial \r\ncommitment to improving maternal health and access \r\nto reproductive services for disadvantaged populations \r\nin Central Asia and Eastern Europe. The meeting \r\nimmediately precedes the high-level regional forum \r\nthat will take place in Istanbul on 12 and 13 November, \r\nmarking the fifteenth anniversary of ICPD. The \r\nGovernment of Turkey is working closely with the \r\nUNFPA Regional Office for Eastern Europe and \r\nCentral Asia to ensure the success of those meetings. \r\n Finally, in today’s globalized world, migration \r\nand development are becoming even more closely \r\nlinked. Considering that the fundamental cause of \r\nillegal migration is poverty and underdevelopment in \r\ncountries of origin, it would be more realistic that the \r\ncountries of origin and of destination jointly develop \r\ninitiatives aimed at the root causes of the problem. \r\nWhile we agree that cooperation in migration \r\nmanagement should be based on partnership, given the \r\nmagnitude of the illegal migration problem, the \r\nsolutions are beyond the means of a single country, \r\nthus requiring burden-sharing. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on the \r\nrepresentative of Jamaica. \r\n Mr. Wolfe (Jamaica): The convening of this \r\ncommemorative meeting is indeed timely, offering us a \r\nunique opportunity to take stock of our achievements \r\nover the last 15 years and to underline our expectations \r\nfor the years ahead. As the Assembly is about to \r\nundertake preparations for next year’s high-level \r\nmeeting to review the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs), this meeting will also serve to assist in that \r\nendeavour, as the Programme of Action of the \r\nInternational Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment (ICPD) (see A/CONF.171/13/Rev.1) is \r\nnot only by and large encompassed in the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) but forms part and parcel \r\nof the global development agenda. Fifteen years after \r\nthe Cairo Conference, we continue to hold the view \r\nA/64/PV.19  \r\n \r\n09-55571 10 \r\n \r\nthat the Programme of Action remains relevant in a \r\ndynamic globalized environment. \r\n The timing of this meeting is also apt in that it \r\ncoincides with an inauspicious period characterized by \r\nunprecedented turmoil in the global environment. \r\nDeveloping countries, in particularly small island \r\ndeveloping States like my own, have never been more \r\nbuffeted by the complex and multidimensional \r\nchallenges that we have been forced to confront \r\nthrough no fault of ours. We are faced with a global \r\nfinancial and economic crisis of an enormity that far \r\ntranscends our limited capacities to respond and that \r\ntherefore threatens to decimate our fragile economies. \r\nWe are saddled with an inordinately high and \r\nunsustainable level of indebtedness and have limited \r\nor, worse still, no access to liquidity, and with extreme \r\nvulnerability to external shocks and susceptibility to \r\nnatural disasters. We are challenged to address food \r\nsecurity. Because of all that, our capacity to attain our \r\nnational development objectives and internationally \r\nagreed development goals is seriously compromised. \r\n Notwithstanding the myriad challenges, Jamaica \r\nhas recorded several important accomplishments in our \r\nefforts to implement the ICPD Programme of Action \r\nand to make it the cornerstone of all our policies, plans \r\nand programmes on population and development \r\nmatters.  \r\n Jamaica was among the first countries in the \r\ndeveloping world to develop an explicit and \r\ncomprehensive national population policy following \r\nthe 1994 Conference. In 2006, our Government made a \r\nparadigm shift from five-year medium-term planning \r\nto a long-term planning horizon, encapsulated in the \r\nlong-term population plan Vision 2030. Preparations \r\nare currently under way for implementation of the \r\nPopulation Plan through three-year medium-term \r\nplanning frameworks. \r\n Jamaica had a relatively well-developed family \r\nplanning programme even prior to the ICPD. Since \r\nthen the Government of Jamaica, with the kind \r\nassistance of UNFPA and USAID, has embarked on a \r\nstrategic programme targeting the reproductive health-\r\ncare needs of adolescents and youth. To a large extent, \r\nthose groups were excluded from the main focus of the \r\nnational family planning and reproductive health \r\nprogramme. Since the ICPD, implementation of \r\nadolescent and youth-friendly clinics and health and \r\nfamily life education programmes in schools and \r\ncommunities has resulted in substantial reductions in \r\nfertility and unwanted and unintended pregnancies and \r\nhigher contraceptive prevalence among adolescents and \r\nyouth. \r\n With the support of UNFPA and the European \r\nCommission, Jamaica has also embarked on another \r\nstrategic programme, one that targets the reproductive \r\nhealth needs of persons with disabilities and focuses on \r\nadolescents and youth with disabilities. The success of \r\nthat programme has been regarded as a best practice \r\nand is being piloted in other countries. I am also \r\npleased to report that Jamaica is on target for achieving \r\nuniversal access to reproductive health by 2015. \r\n Jamaica was among the first countries following \r\nthe ICPD and the social summit to develop a national \r\npoverty eradication policy and programme of action. In \r\nthe early 1990s, absolute poverty was estimated at \r\naround 30 per cent of the population, with rural areas \r\naccounting for higher levels, at about 50 per cent. The \r\nlatest estimates indicate that absolute poverty is around \r\n10 per cent of the population, well below the levels \r\nrecorded in the 1990s. \r\n The Government of Jamaica has pursued a \r\nmulti-pronged strategic approach in targeting the poor. \r\nVarious programmes for vulnerable groups — \r\nincluding lactating women, children, adolescents, \r\nyouth, the elderly and persons with disabilities — are \r\nbeing pursued. The MDG target for reducing extreme \r\npoverty and hunger between 1990 and 2015 was \r\nachieved by 2007, and Jamaica is well on its way to \r\neradicating absolute poverty. However, there are well-\r\nfounded fears that the current global economic \r\nrecession may undermine some of our gains in that \r\narea. \r\n The HIV/AIDS epidemic, which started in 1982 \r\nin Jamaica, is among the greatest challenges facing the \r\ncountry. Jamaica has formulated a national HIV/AIDS \r\nstrategic plan in line with a CARICOM HIV/AIDS \r\nstrategic plan. Other initiatives implemented include \r\nthe integration of programmes relating to HIV/AIDS \r\nand other sexually transmitted diseases into the family \r\nplanning and maternal and child health programmes. \r\n Following the Millennium Summit, Jamaica \r\nundertook a more systematic and comprehensive \r\napproach to the epidemic. That was greatly facilitated \r\nby the availability of increased funding through the \r\nGlobal Fund and similar funding initiatives. \r\n A/64/PV.19\r\n \r\n11 09-55571 \r\n \r\n Over the past five years, Jamaica has finally \r\nstarted to see tangible gains. Deaths from AIDS have \r\nstarted to decline as a result of greater public access to \r\nantiretroviral treatment, the use of prophylaxis against \r\nopportunistic infections and improved laboratory \r\ncapacity to conduct investigations. Paediatric AIDS \r\ncases have also declined, indicating the success of the \r\nprogramme for the prevention of mother-to-child \r\ntransmission.  \r\n Despite these important gains, the level of \r\ninfection remains fairly high, at around 1.5 to 1.7 per \r\ncent of the population 15 years and over. Jamaica is of \r\nthe view that with enhanced support and adequate \r\nfunding, we should be able to achieve the targets. \r\n In relation to the ICPD and the MDG goal of \r\nreducing maternal mortality by two thirds between \r\n1990 and 2015, some programmes implemented to date \r\nat the national level have integrated projects \r\nconcerning maternal and child health, family planning \r\nand sexually transmitted infections. We have \r\nestablished baby- and mother-friendly clinics and \r\nprovided antiretrovirals to prevent mother-to-child \r\ntransmission of HIV. Free health care has been made \r\navailable in public hospitals and clinics island-wide. \r\nAlthough there has been much progress, it is highly \r\nunlikely that Jamaica will achieve all the targets by \r\n2015. \r\n Jamaica has an enviable record of promoting \r\ngender equality, equity and empowerment of women. \r\nAmong our most important achievements are the \r\nestablishment in the 1970s of various institutions \r\ndedicated to the advancement of women and the \r\nintroduction of the Women in Development Studies \r\nProgramme at the University of the West Indies. Those \r\nprogrammes have contributed significantly to the \r\nprogress of women in many spheres. Girls have \r\nsurpassed boys in both enrolment and performance at \r\nthe secondary and tertiary levels. Major initiatives will \r\nhave to be implemented to bridge the disparity as it \r\nrelates to males in education. \r\n Despite successes in education for women, \r\nprogress in some areas still lags behind that of males. \r\nThe share of women in wage employment in the \r\nnon-agriculture sector has reflected steady progress \r\nsince the 1990s and is close to parity, at 49 per cent in \r\n2007. Women’s representation at the highest levels in \r\nboth the public and private sectors and as it relates to \r\npolitical representation is grossly below par vis-à-vis \r\ntheir male counterparts. \r\n Jamaica’s path to progress has been characterized \r\nby challenges in several areas, including funding. \r\nHowever, over the next five years Jamaica will \r\nconcentrate its efforts on, inter alia, developing a \r\nnational policy on migration and development, \r\nreviewing the existing draft policy on gender, \r\nexpanding programmes to achieve universal access to \r\nfamily planning services by 2015, evaluating and \r\nredesigning our services to meet 2015 targets for infant \r\nand maternal mortality and expanding programmes to \r\nreduce the rate of HIV/AIDS infections.  \r\n We note that funding in some areas has either \r\nbeen reduced or has dried up altogether. At this critical \r\njuncture, especially in this time of crisis, we caution — \r\nindeed, urge — the international community, in \r\nparticular the developed countries, to provide the \r\nresources necessary to facilitate the full and effective \r\nimplementation of the ICPD Programme of Action. \r\nDespite the odds, Jamaica is determined to remain on \r\ncourse in our relentless pursuit of a better quality of \r\nlife for current and future generations. \r\n The Acting President: I call next on the \r\nrepresentative of Serbia. \r\n Mr. Milanović (Serbia): Serbia aligns itself with \r\nthe statement delivered by the representative of \r\nSweden on behalf of the European Union (see \r\nA/64/PV.17). \r\n Fifteen years ago, we reached an important \r\nconsensus on an issue that used to be divisive: the \r\nrelationship between population growth and \r\ndevelopment. Today we should be proud of the \r\nprogress that has been made in carrying forward the \r\nagenda of the International Conference on Population \r\nand Development (ICPD).  \r\n The vast majority of countries have adopted \r\nnational policies, laws and programmes to advance \r\nwomen’s health and rights, including reproductive \r\nhealth. Many have embraced the concept of \r\nreproductive health and are moving at a respectable \r\npace to reduce infant, child and maternal mortality and \r\nHIV infection. The majority of nations are using \r\npopulation data and analysis to inform their economic \r\nand social plans, policies and programmes. \r\nFurthermore, thanks to the work of all of us, but \r\nespecially the United Nations system, more women are \r\nA/64/PV.19  \r\n \r\n09-55571 12 \r\n \r\nchoosing to use family planning, more infants survive \r\nand more girls are going to school. Finally, the General \r\nAssembly resolution to establish a new gender entity in \r\nthe Secretariat is an additional important step towards \r\nthe realization of our obligations to women. All of this \r\nshows how far we have advanced in the past 15 years. \r\n However, notwithstanding the evident progress, \r\nmuch still has to be done. While a solid policy has \r\nbeen devised and the legal foundation has been laid, \r\nthe implementation continues to be a real challenge. In \r\nmany countries, mandates remain unfunded: national \r\nbudgets can usually not meet the demand and \r\ninternational assistance is insufficient. Nevertheless, \r\nsome progress has been achieved and Serbia welcomes \r\nthe fact that the funding for United Nations Population \r\nFund (UNFPA) work is increasing. \r\n But we should always bear in mind that, unless \r\nurgent action is taken, it is estimated that, over the next \r\n10 years, there will be 2.5 million maternal deaths in \r\nAfrica alone. It should be noted that, while there has \r\nbeen an increase in resources mobilized, funding \r\noverall is significantly short of what is necessary to \r\nmeet current needs and costs, which have increased \r\ntremendously since the targets were agreed on in 1994. \r\nIn a time of crisis, however, the effective and efficient \r\nuse of resources and increased coherence among \r\ndevelopment partners are of utmost importance. \r\n It is evident that the current economic crisis hit \r\nall of us very hard. It is now threatening the progress \r\nwe have made in the past several years, and assistance \r\nwill be needed more than ever before. According to the \r\nlatest statistical data, in the first half of 2009 the \r\nnumber of infant deaths per 1,000 live births in Serbia \r\nrose by almost 25 per cent compared to 2008. These \r\nexamples should not be overlooked, and we hope that \r\nwe still have an opportunity to reverse this trend. \r\n Unfortunately, we have to note that we are still \r\nfar from meeting Millennium Development Goal \r\n(MDG) 5. Maternal mortality remains our biggest \r\nproblem, and addressing it will require a multisectoral \r\napproach. It is encouraging that coordination at the \r\ncountry level among UNFPA, UNICEF, the World \r\nHealth Organization and the World Bank is increasing, \r\nand we expect further progress in that regard. Of all the \r\nhealth indicators, maternal mortality reveals the largest \r\ngap between rich and poor; we have to close that gap \r\nand improve social justice. Serbia welcomes the fact \r\nthat UNFPA is paying special attention to the issue of \r\nmaternal health. \r\n The rise in natural disasters requires better \r\nemergency preparedness and more work in disaster risk \r\nreduction. Climate change is the main reason for this \r\nincrease, and effective responses, based on scientific \r\nanalysis, must be developed. In that regard, we are \r\npleased that the theme of the 2009 UNFPA Report on \r\nthe State of World Population, to be released on \r\n18 November, is “Facing a Changing World: Women, \r\nPopulation and Climate”.  \r\n In conclusion, I would like to welcome the \r\nsuccessful implementation of the UNFPA \r\nregionalization plan. We also hope that UNFPA will \r\ncome up with an adequate solution for the Regional \r\nOffice for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, based on \r\nthe same principles that led to the relocation of other \r\nregional offices. \r\n The Cairo Consensus is fully aligned with the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and provided much of \r\nthe groundwork for them. It is important that the goals \r\nand principles of ICPD continue to move forward \r\nthrough Member States’ active cooperation and \r\nresolve, and, in that regard, I want to emphasize once \r\nagain Serbia’s full and firm support. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of the Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic. \r\n Ms. Phommachanh (Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic): At the outset I wish to express our \r\ngratification at the convening of this meeting to mark \r\nthe fifteenth anniversary of the International \r\nConference on Population and Development (ICPD) \r\nand to express our sincere appreciation to the \r\nSecretary-General for his inspiring statement on this \r\noccasion. I would also like to express our special \r\nthanks to Executive Director Thoraya Obaid of the \r\nUnited Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) for her \r\nremarks and for the assistance extended by the Fund in \r\nsupport of the implementation of the ICPD Programme \r\nof Action (see A/CONF.171/13/Rev.1). \r\n As we commemorate the fifteenth anniversary of \r\nthe International Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment, I would like to reiterate the strong \r\nsupport of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic for \r\nthe ICPD Programme of Action, which underscores the \r\nintegral and mutually reinforcing linkages between \r\n A/64/PV.19\r\n \r\n13 09-55571 \r\n \r\npopulation and development and sets forth a series of \r\nimportant population and development objectives and \r\ngoals. Its implementation has led to significant \r\nimprovements in the lives of women, men and \r\nchildren. \r\n Since the 1994 adoption of the Programme of \r\nAction and its implementation in the Lao People’s \r\nDemocratic Republic, the country has seen a notable \r\nimprovement in health in general and reproductive \r\nhealth in particular. In 2005, 35 per cent of married \r\nwomen practised family planning, representing a \r\nsteady increase of 15 per cent in the decade since 1995. \r\nMaternal mortality decreased from 650 per 100,000 \r\nlive births in 1995 to 405 in 2005. During the same \r\nperiod, infant mortality fell from 104 per 1,000 live \r\nbirths to 70. In this regard I would like to express my \r\nGovernment’s appreciation for the support provided in \r\nthis area by the international community, especially \r\nUNFPA, which took the lead in implementing the \r\nICPD vision that has helped us make this progress. \r\n The Government of the Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic is committed to achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). While we recognize and \r\nappreciate the progress that has been made, we are also \r\nmindful of the challenges that still lie ahead. We are \r\nkeenly aware that, while we are on track in such areas \r\nas reducing child mortality and combating tuberculosis \r\nand malaria, maternal mortality is still very high. \r\nAlthough the rate has decreased in the past 15 years, \r\n405 deaths per 100,000 live births is too many. Also, \r\nprogress varies between urban and rural areas and \r\nsocio-economic quintiles. \r\n The Lao People’s Democratic Republic is \r\ntransforming itself from a landlocked country to a \r\n“land-linked” country with the development of road \r\nnetworks. Our population is very young, with more \r\nthan half below 20 years of age. With declining \r\nfertility, the country is expecting the proportion of the \r\npopulation that is of working age to grow for the next \r\nfew decades. My Government is aware of the \r\nopportunity that these factors create for social and \r\neconomic development, but also of their potential for \r\nputting our population at greater risk of reproductive ill \r\nhealth. \r\n There is a great need to continue to invest in \r\nuniversal access to reproductive health care for women, \r\nmen and youth in order to protect them from disease, \r\ngive them greater opportunities for education and \r\nemployment, alleviate population pressure on our \r\nprecious environment, and contribute to improved food \r\nsecurity and reduction of poverty. Universal access to \r\nreproductive health, a cornerstone of the ICPD \r\nProgramme of Action, is the key to achieving and \r\nfacilitating all of the MDGs, not only MDG 5. \r\n My Government has recently begun to implement \r\nevidence-based strategies and action plans, such as the \r\nintegrated package of maternal, neonatal and child \r\nhealth services and the skilled birth attendant \r\ndevelopment plan. We are expanding the availability \r\nand use of adolescent and youth reproductive health \r\ncounselling and clinical services, but they need \r\nacceleration. Successful implementation of these plans \r\nand interventions is indispensable to achieving ICPD \r\nand MDG goals. Despite the financial and economic \r\ncrisis, investment in reproductive health must not \r\ndiminish, since it would derail MDG achievement. For \r\nour part, we are making efforts to attain greater aid \r\neffectiveness through improved coordination of \r\ndevelopment assistance by implementing the Vientiane \r\nDeclaration on Aid Effectiveness, a localized version \r\nof the Paris Declaration. \r\n To this end, we encourage UNFPA to further \r\nfulfil its commitments in leading implementation of the \r\nICPD Programme of Action. We welcome the outcome \r\nof the Asia-Pacific High-level Forum on ICPD at 15, \r\nheld in Bangkok on 16 and 17 September, and call for \r\neffective implementation of the Forum Declaration, \r\nwhich outlined the challenges we face and the way \r\nforward to achieving the ICPD goals by 2014 through \r\nconcerted action in areas such as maternal health, \r\nfamily planning, sexual and reproductive health, \r\ngender equality and women’s empowerment, \r\npopulation ageing, international migration and \r\nstrengthening health systems. \r\n In conclusion, my delegation would like to \r\nexpress our sincere gratitude to the UNFPA and \r\ndevelopment partners for assisting the Lao People’s \r\nDemocratic Republic to integrate population, \r\nreproductive health and gender issues into national, \r\nsectoral and provincial policy, plans and programmes \r\nin line with our national population and development \r\npolicy. We wish to reaffirm the unwavering \r\ncommitment of the Government of the Lao People’s \r\nDemocratic Republic to further cooperation with the \r\ninternational community and United Nations agencies, \r\nparticularly UNFPA, in the fulfilment of the ICPD \r\nProgramme of Action and MDGs. \r\nA/64/PV.19  \r\n \r\n09-55571 14 \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Bulgaria. \r\n Mr. Raytchev (Bulgaria): The commemoration of \r\nthe fifteenth anniversary of the International \r\nConference on Population and Development (ICPD) \r\nand its Programme of Action gives me the welcome \r\nopportunity to join with previous speakers in \r\nemphasizing the importance and the achievements of \r\nthe Conference and its outcome. My delegation \r\nwelcomes the statement made by the Executive \r\nDirector of the United Nations Population Fund \r\n(UNFPA), Ms. Thoraya Obaid, and we congratulate \r\nUNFPA for its dedicated work on the implementation \r\nof the ICPD Programme of Action.  \r\n Bulgaria aligns itself with the statement made by \r\nSweden on behalf of the European Union. I would like \r\nto provide some brief additional remarks from a \r\nnational perspective. \r\n One of the main achievements of the ICPD \r\nProgramme of Action is that it put people and human \r\nrights in the limelight and articulated the connections \r\namong many interrelated factors, such as human \r\ndevelopment, empowerment of women, health, \r\npopulation dynamics, economic growth, urbanization, \r\nmigration and protection of the environment. \r\nTherefore, given the interdependence of our world and \r\nin the light of today’s financial, climate, food and \r\nenergy crises, the ICPD agenda remains more relevant \r\nthan ever.  \r\n As was pointed out by many previous speakers, \r\nnumerous examples can be cited to illustrate progress \r\ntowards achieving the ICPD goals over the past \r\n15 years. However, equally abundant is the proof that \r\nwe are lagging seriously behind. Hence, there can be \r\nno doubt that a lot more ought to be done and that we \r\nall ought to be more committed, more active and \r\ninvolved during the five years that remain until 2015. \r\n For its part, Bulgaria is proud of its participation \r\nin the Conference and of having remained firmly \r\ncommitted to the implementation of the Plan of Action \r\nthat was its outcome. Besides our active involvement \r\nin the work of the Commission on Population and \r\nDevelopment (CPD) as Chair and Vice-Chair of the \r\nCommission’s forty-first and forty-second sessions, \r\nrespectively, I would like to provide three further \r\nillustrations of my country’s continued commitment to \r\nthe fulfilment of the ICPD goals and objectives at the \r\nnational, regional and global levels. \r\n First, in 2006, Bulgaria developed its National \r\nDemographic Strategy 2006-2020, which is a \r\nfundamental and comprehensive document that \r\nincorporates the recommendations of both the ICPD \r\nProgramme of Action and the European Commission \r\non responding to demographic challenges. The \r\nGovernment of Bulgaria considers the goals contained \r\nin the Strategy not only to be a blueprint for reversing \r\nnegative demographic trends, while guaranteeing \r\nwomen’s and men’s sexual and reproductive health and \r\nrights, but also to be vital to our efforts to constantly \r\nimprove the living standards of the population at large. \r\n Secondly, following up on ICPD \r\nrecommendations regarding youth, Bulgaria has \r\ndeveloped partnerships with various organizations that \r\nare targeted at young people and their health, education \r\nand welfare, in order to improve adolescents’ sexual \r\nand reproductive health. In the framework of this \r\npartnership, the peer education network called Y-PEER \r\nBulgaria, which stands for Youth Peer Education \r\nNetwork Bulgaria, was established in 2000 with \r\nsupport from the Bulgarian authorities and UNFPA. \r\nThe network is designed to develop successful youth-\r\nadult partnerships between peer educators and \r\nsupportive adults. In addition, through the regional \r\nY-PEER International Centre for Peer Education \r\nTraining and Research, which was opened in Sofia in \r\nOctober 2007 and connects more than 5,000 young \r\npeople from 42 countries, Bulgaria is cooperating with \r\ncountries from Eastern Europe and Central Asia by \r\nexchanging experience, knowledge and good practices. \r\n Lastly, Bulgaria takes its responsibilities as an \r\nemerging donor very seriously. The promotion of \r\nhealth services, education and training of specialists, \r\ncultural diversity and tolerance, and socio-economic \r\nreforms are among the priority areas of the new \r\nBulgarian development cooperation policy aimed at \r\ncontributing to the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals at the global level. \r\n It is clear to all of us today, with only five years \r\nremaining in the countdown to the 2015 deadline, we \r\nmust continue to act with urgency to achieve our \r\ncommon goal — to put our world into greater balance \r\nand to improve the lives of present and future \r\ngenerations. Bulgaria remains committed to sharing the \r\nexperience drawn from our manifold activities in the \r\nfields of population and development as well as to \r\nproviding assistance to those in need. \r\n A/64/PV.19\r\n \r\n15 09-55571 \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Chile. \r\n Mr. Del Campo (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nshould like to begin by thanking the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly for having organized this important \r\ncommemorative meeting. My delegation also aligns \r\nitself with the statement made by the representative of \r\nthe Sudan on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, and \r\nthe statement made by the representative of Mexico on \r\nbehalf of the Rio Group.  \r\n I also wish to reiterate my country’s commitment \r\nto the 20-year Programme of Action agreed 15 years \r\nago at the International Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment (ICPD) in Cairo, which we are \r\ncommemorating today.  \r\n A commemoration like this one should be a \r\nhappy occasion, and looking back we should appreciate \r\nthe efforts and the achievements made so far in the \r\nfield of population and development. But we are \r\ncelebrating this commemoration in the middle of the \r\ngreatest economic and financial crisis since the 1930s, \r\na crisis that is strongly affecting many regions of the \r\nplanet, despite some hopeful indicators.  \r\n Earlier speakers have repeated the message of the \r\n2009 report on the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs), namely, the lack of sufficient progress when \r\nit comes to MDGs 3, 4, 5 and 6, the failure to reach the \r\ngoal of eliminating gender disparities in primary and \r\nsecondary education by 2005, a lack of sufficient \r\nprogress in reducing maternal mortality, and the \r\npersistence of diseases such as AIDS. Furthermore, the \r\nfact that a half million women have died for maternity-\r\nrelated reasons is unacceptable.  \r\n This should lead us to think more deeply about \r\nthe importance of renewing our commitment and our \r\nefforts to achieve those goals in the next five years. \r\nAccordingly, I would like to highlight once again my \r\ncountry’s contribution to the International Drug \r\nPurchase Facility. I would also like to reaffirm my \r\ncountry’s gratification at the recent adoption of \r\nresolution 63/311 on system-wide coherence.  \r\n Gender equality and the autonomy of women are \r\nfundamental pillars of the Government of my country. \r\nRecently, President Michelle Bachelet Jeria reaffirmed \r\nmy country’s commitment to meeting the targets set in \r\nour pro-gender-equity agenda entitled “Commitments \r\nto Advance in Gender Equity 2006-2010”. Among the \r\nachievements in that agenda we highlight gender-\r\noriented reforms in social security. They will guarantee \r\na basic pension to women who are heads of household \r\nand a bonus per child born or adopted. The number of \r\nchildcare centres will expand from the 700 when \r\nPresident Bachelet took office to more than 4,000 by \r\nthe end of her term. A law guarantees a progressive, \r\ngradual increase in the minimum salary of household \r\nworkers. Ninety women’s centres and 25 shelters for \r\nwomen and their children who are victims of serious \r\ndomestic violence are in full operation.  \r\n Among the achievements of my country, I would \r\nlike to highlight women’s average rate of finishing \r\nschool: 54.4 per cent in 1990, 80.6 per cent in \r\n2000 and the same percentage in 2006. That positive \r\ntrend is also seen in the large number of women who \r\nbegin and complete university programmes, which in \r\nturn improves women’s entry into the labour market. In \r\nthe field of health, I would like to highlight the benefits \r\nof the health plan known as AUGE, which provides \r\nguarantees to pregnant women at risk of premature \r\ndelivery, to women affected or potentially affected by \r\ncervical cancer or breast cancer and to pregnant women \r\nwith AIDS. Those are examples of my country’s \r\ncommitment to the goals we are discussing. \r\n Finally, I would like to renew my country’s \r\ncommitment to continue contributing to the United \r\nNations Population Fund.  \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Nicaragua. \r\n Mrs. Rubiales de Chamorro (Nicaragua) (spoke \r\nin Spanish): The delegation of Nicaragua welcomes the \r\ncommemoration of the fifteenth anniversary of the \r\nInternational Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment (ICPD). We also reiterate our \r\ncommitment to working together for the success of the \r\nachievements made and goals agreed at that \r\nConference, held in Cairo in 1994.  \r\n Fifteen years have passed, and we must now \r\nexamine the achievements to date and prioritize the \r\nmost important objectives for our countries. Our \r\nGovernment places the highest importance on the \r\nfulfilment of the goals and objectives established in the \r\nICPD Programme of Action (see A/CONF.171/13/Rev.1) \r\nfor the eradication of extreme poverty, as well as the \r\nother Millennium Development Goals. \r\nA/64/PV.19  \r\n \r\n09-55571 16 \r\n \r\n My delegation associates itself with the statement \r\nmade by the Sudan on behalf of the Group of 77 and \r\nChina (see A/64/PV.18) and with the statement made \r\nby Mexico on behalf of the Rio Group (ibid.). \r\n We would like to take this opportunity to thank \r\nthe United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) for its \r\ncooperation with Nicaragua for almost 40 years. It has \r\nimplemented a series of cooperative programmes, \r\noffering technical and financial assistance in important \r\nareas and in the neediest communities and territories. \r\n On this occasion I would especially like to \r\nhighlight that during 2009 our country has received \r\ntwo awards from UNFPA. One is for the Movimiento \r\nComunal for its promotion of health, particularly in \r\nprotecting and promoting sexual and reproductive \r\nhealth, with emphasis on the human rights of women, \r\nyoung people and adolescents, and for its work to \r\neradicate domestic violence, teenage pregnancy and \r\nHIV/AIDS and to promote equitable gender relations at \r\nthe community level. Last week we received another \r\nUNFPA prize, the International Award for the Health \r\nand Dignity of Women. That award is given to those \r\nwhose work has made a significant impact on the lives \r\nand health of women and girls. It manifests the \r\nengagement, dedication and commitment realized \r\nthrough the national network of women’s health \r\ncentres with regard to health issues and the prevention \r\nof violence in Nicaragua. That is incontrovertible proof \r\nof our compliance with the goals we set in Cairo.  \r\n In January 2007, when President Ortega once \r\nagain took up the administration of our country, we \r\nplaced a priority on the fight against poverty and \r\nhunger, universal access to education and health care \r\nfree of charge and citizen participation in decision-\r\nmaking. In other words, our goal is the restoration of \r\nthe rights of Nicaraguan citizens, both men and \r\nwomen. Our Government has set in motion a process to \r\nreview the poverty reduction strategy and the national \r\nplan for sustainable human development.  \r\n Those are precisely the premises on which we \r\nbase our priorities, which are to eradicate poverty in \r\nthe country and to advance inclusive economic and \r\nsocial development plans that take into account the \r\nmost disadvantaged classes, which have been ignored \r\nunder the preceding neo-liberal Governments. We have \r\nworked to create and implement citizen participation \r\nmechanisms that guarantee the inclusion of the needs \r\nand interests of the most dispossessed in the \r\nformulation of public policy. We fully agree with what \r\nUNFPA Executive Director Thoraya Obaid said in her \r\nstatement (see A/64/PV.17) about the absolute primacy \r\nof human development; that is the central tenet of our \r\nGovernment. \r\n I would like also to underline that on 16 July our \r\nGovernment officially announced, after its passage in \r\nthe National Assembly, the Sovereignty and Food \r\nSecurity Act, and later a directive for its execution, \r\nleading to its implementation at the national level. That \r\ninitiative complements the commitments made at the \r\nICPD, since it aims to guarantee the right of all men \r\nand women in Nicaragua to enough nutritious, safe \r\nfood for their vital needs.  \r\n The Special Food Security Programme in \r\nNicaragua — PESA — has been described by the Food \r\nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations \r\n(FAO) as an outstanding and recognized model among \r\nthe 62 food security programmes that FAO is carrying \r\nout around the world because it operates across many \r\nsectors. That has earned it FAO’s recognition and has \r\nled to a memorandum of understanding for future joint \r\nactions between FAO and Nicaragua. \r\n Aware that improving access to basic services is \r\nan important element in promoting social integration \r\nand equitable economic development for all, our \r\nGovernment has declared that health and education \r\nwill be provided to all free of charge. The National \r\nMartí-to-Fidel Literacy Campaign has drastically \r\nreduced illiteracy in Nicaragua, and UNESCO recently \r\ndeclared our country free of illiteracy. \r\n In the area of health, to guarantee access, the care \r\nparadigm was reformulated to produce a community \r\nand family health model based on systematic care for \r\nfamilies in their own homes. As a result we have \r\nachieved a significant reduction in maternal mortality, \r\ndropping from 90 deaths per 100,000 live births in \r\n2006 to 64 per 100,000 in 2008. The World Health \r\nOrganization estimates that Nicaragua has already \r\nsurpassed the Millennium Development Goal of \r\nhalving the prevalence and death rate of tuberculosis as \r\ncompared to 1990. \r\n In addition to the Sovereignty and Food Security \r\nAct, our Government is implementing concrete \r\nmeasures in the field of agriculture, promoting the \r\norganization of agricultural and livestock public \r\nservices to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of \r\nGovernment programmes for rural areas, as well as the \r\n A/64/PV.19\r\n \r\n17 09-55571 \r\n \r\norganization of research and transfer of technology in \r\nrural areas, with special emphasis on respect for ethnic \r\ngroups and communities of people of African descent, \r\nto improve productive practices that are \r\nenvironmentally friendly and respectful of Mother \r\nEarth. In 2007, we implemented a food production \r\nbonus for impoverished rural families as part of our \r\nZero Hunger programme, whose direct beneficiaries \r\nhave been rural women. We have handed out almost \r\n40,000 bonuses.  \r\n These concrete measures are making a difference. \r\nThat is precisely what my Government hopes to hear \r\nfrom the international community. We must move from \r\nrhetoric and discourse to concrete and practical action \r\nthat directly benefits those most in need. \r\n The chaotic situation into which we have been \r\nplunged by the capitalistic system requires solidarity \r\namong brotherly countries, in full respect for dignity \r\nand sovereignty. The Bolivarian Alternative for the \r\nAmericas has become a genuine example of unity, \r\ncomplementarity and solidarity in confronting current \r\nchallenges. \r\n We appeal to the developed countries to shoulder \r\ntheir share of responsibility towards developing \r\ncountries and to address the effects of a crisis that \r\noriginated in those countries and was caused by them. \r\nThe impact of the crisis should not serve as an excuse \r\nnot to honour the pledges made for official \r\ndevelopment assistance, which could endanger the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of the Republic of Ecuador. \r\n Mr. Chiriboga (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nAllow me to reiterate the full support of my delegation \r\nfor the work of the President at this session and to \r\nendorse the statements made by the representative of \r\nthe Sudan on behalf of the Group of 77 and China and \r\nby the representative of Mexico on behalf of the Rio \r\nGroup. \r\n There is no doubt that the International \r\nConference on Population and Development and its \r\nProgramme of Action (see A/CONF.171/13/Rev.1) \r\ncreated the mechanisms necessary to identify \r\ndevelopment and human rights as complementary \r\nelements in achieving a life of dignity for all. While \r\nthere are many obstacles to overcome, many resulting \r\nfrom the economic and financial crisis generated in the \r\nNorth, it is no less certain that a coordinated effort at \r\nthe international level will successfully achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals.  \r\n In Ecuador, we have proposed a more inclusive \r\nand non-predatory development strategy to eradicate \r\npoverty and guarantee a life with dignity. In that \r\ncontext and with the 2008 adoption of a new \r\nConstitution, we in Ecuador understand development \r\nas an organized, sustainable and dynamic convergence \r\nof economic, political, social, cultural and \r\nenvironmental systems that guarantee the condition of \r\ngood living, or sumak kawsay. Good living requires \r\nindividuals, communities, peoples and nationalities \r\neffectively to enjoy their rights and exercise their \r\nresponsibilities in the context of interculturality, \r\nrespect for diversity and harmonic coexistence with \r\nnature. \r\n Based on these objectives, the national \r\nGovernment created a national development plan as a \r\nstrategic instrument to implement in a systematic and \r\norganized manner the changes promoted by the new \r\nconstitutional framework. The plan outlines and seeks \r\nto concretize a road map that will allow us to identify \r\nthe tipping point and changes in the historical \r\ntrajectories of development and democracy in Ecuador \r\nin the context of ethical and political guidelines and a \r\nnew type of civic conviviality. \r\n The proposals contained in the national \r\ndevelopment plan set up important technical and \r\npolitical challenges, as well as methodological and \r\nstructural innovations. The plan represents a \r\nconceptual rupture with old development paradigms \r\nthat advocated stabilization policies, structural \r\nadjustment, a State reduced to its minimal expression, \r\nand neo-liberal policies that weakened the political and \r\ninstitutional system and unleashed a profound socio-\r\neconomic crisis.  \r\n The plan restores a vision of development that \r\nprioritizes the achievement of good living and its \r\nconcomitant expanded liberties, opportunities and \r\nhuman potential and the recognition that each of us \r\nmust work towards a shared future for all. That will \r\nnecessarily entail a change in the modalities of the \r\nState that will restore its capacities to manage, plan, \r\nregulate and redistribute, and intensify the processes of \r\ndevolution, decentralization and citizen participation. \r\n In its conceptual break with the concept of \r\ndevelopment and the modality of the State, the plan \r\nA/64/PV.19  \r\n \r\n09-55571 18 \r\n \r\npromotes eight strategies for change: the \r\ndemocratization of the means of production; \r\ninternational sovereign relations through an active and \r\nstrategic integration with the world; the diversification \r\nof production; integration and territorial development; \r\nensuring the sustainability of natural heritage; \r\nincreasing the effective planning, regulation and \r\nmanagement capacity of the State; economic \r\ndemocratization, social activism, guaranteed rights; \r\nand the transformation of the higher educational \r\nsystem with increased investment in science, \r\ntechnology and innovation. The plan is not conceived \r\nas the sum of its parts and diverse elements. It is \r\nholistic and based on a rights-oriented approach that \r\ntranscends the traditional sectoral perspective and is \r\noriented towards environmental sustainability and \r\ngender, generational, intercultural and territorial \r\nequality. \r\n The harmonization of the sectoral with national \r\nobjectives involved considerable coordination efforts \r\nand inter-State streamlining to align problem-solving, \r\npolicy and sectoral visions with the major national \r\ninterests. The plan proposes 12 major national \r\ndevelopment objectives, consistent with the provisions \r\nof the 2008 Constitution, which promote equality and \r\nsocial cohesion based on diversity, pool the potentials \r\nof the population and their quality of life, promote a \r\nhealthy and sustainable environment, guarantee \r\nsovereignty, promote integration, create stable and \r\ndignified work, strengthen the public polity, guarantee \r\nthe prevalence of human rights and justice, establish a \r\nsocio-economic system based on solidarity and \r\nsustainability, and consolidate the transformation of the \r\nState for the sake of good living.  \r\n In the current context, planning for development \r\nfaces new challenges: understanding and acting in a \r\ncontext of systemic global crisis, formulating strategies \r\nto minimize its impact on the country without hurting \r\nthe poorest, and simultaneously crafting policies that \r\nwill generate structural change more rapidly and more \r\nappropriately as a mechanism to achieve development. \r\n These proposals do not require us to ignore the \r\nworld community. At the global level, we must \r\npromote planetary coordination based on mutual \r\nrespect, international law and multilateralism as tools \r\nof conviviality among countries. At this juncture, it is \r\nimperative that we redefine the world financial order, \r\nwhich has been distorted by speculation and privilege, \r\nin line with the vision of human rights and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n The devastating effects of climate change have \r\ncompelled our countries to rethink their development \r\nmodels, and Ecuador wishes to contribute its solutions. \r\nEcuador has launched the Yasuní-ITT initiative in order \r\nto forgo extraction of nearly 900,000 barrels of oil in \r\nthe Yasuní National Park, thereby preventing the \r\nenvironmental contamination of 410 million metric \r\ntons of carbon. The Yasuní area is also home to \r\nvoluntarily isolated populations and one of the most \r\nmegadiverse areas of the world. The Yasuní-ITT \r\ninitiative thus represents concrete action to combat \r\nglobal warming, prevent fossil fuel exploitation in \r\nareas of high biological and cultural sensitivity, protect \r\nbiodiversity in the Amazon, and respect the rights of \r\nthe indigenous cultures in voluntary isolation. \r\n The problem of world hunger is one not of \r\nresources, but of systems. Poverty and exclusion \r\ncontinue to grow even as many regions are raising their \r\nconsumption of biofuels and continue to subsidize the \r\nexpansion of biofuel crops. These systems of \r\nextraction, commerce, finance and global governance \r\nare exhausted and will not lead to viable long-term \r\nalternatives or overcome the crisis, and are even less \r\nlikely to achieve the good living that our peoples \r\ndeserve. That is why we appeal for urgent \r\nconsideration of how to give effect to the proposals \r\nthat we have made in this statement.  \r\n The Acting President: I now call on the \r\nrepresentative of Antigua and Barbuda. \r\n Mr. Hunte (Antigua and Barbuda): I welcome \r\nthe opportunity for Antigua and Barbuda to join the \r\ninternational community in commemorating the \r\nfifteenth anniversary of the International Conference \r\non Population and Development (ICPD). Antigua and \r\nBarbuda aligns itself with the statement made by the \r\nChairman of the Group of 77 and China (see \r\nA/64/PV.18).  \r\n At the seminal International Conference in Cairo \r\nin 1994, the international community agreed on an \r\nambitious, far-reaching and worthy plan of action for \r\n20 years. Now, with five years left to fully achieve the \r\ngoals and commitments of ICPD, the time is opportune \r\nfor us to take stock of the progress that we have made, \r\nto assess the challenges that remain and to determine \r\nwhat is needed to ensure that the next five years will \r\n A/64/PV.19\r\n \r\n19 09-55571 \r\n \r\nresult in full and complete implementation and \r\nachievement.  \r\n ICPD resulted in an international agreement in \r\nthe form of the Programme of Action (see \r\nA/CONF.171/13/Rev.1) setting out what we consider to \r\nbe some of humankind’s most worthy human \r\ndevelopment goals: providing universal education; \r\nreducing infant, child and maternal mortality rates; \r\nuniversal access to reproductive health care; and \r\nprevention of transmission of infectious diseases, such \r\nas HIV/AIDS. Today, those goals remain a fundamental \r\npart of our economic and social development plan. \r\nLike many of our Caribbean neighbours, we have made \r\nmodest but significant and measurable progress on the \r\nachievement of those goals in the past 15 years. We are \r\ntherefore determined not to become complacent, \r\nrecognizing that full and effective implementation of \r\nthe ICPD Programme of Action by 2014 will require \r\nsignificant resources and commitment, as we build on \r\nwhat we have achieved thus far. Much remains to be \r\ndone within the remaining five years. \r\n In August, we were honoured to host the \r\nCaribbean subregional meeting to assess the \r\nimplementation of the ICPD Programme of Action \r\n15 years after its adoption, with the support of the \r\nUnited Nations Population Fund and the Economic \r\nCommission for Latin America and the Caribbean \r\n(ECLAC). The meeting involved the participation of \r\nGovernment representatives from 15 Caribbean \r\ncountries and a number of experts from \r\nnon-governmental organizations in the fields of \r\npopulation and development, sexual and reproductive \r\nhealth, and rights and gender. The objective of the \r\nmeeting was to discuss the achievements, challenges \r\nand gaps experienced in the Caribbean in the \r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action resulting \r\nfrom the ICPD agenda. \r\n I am pleased to report that the meeting showed \r\nthat the countries of our region have made significant \r\nprogress in achieving economic and human \r\ndevelopment. That is due to the fact that our \r\nGovernments have put in place programmes and \r\npolicies on social protection to address the needs of our \r\nmost vulnerable populations, such as children, youth, \r\nwomen and the elderly. However, such social \r\nprotection programmes are under severe threat as a \r\nresult of the current economic and financial crisis. We \r\nare currently faced with extremely tough choices to \r\nmake, including reducing social expenditure in order to \r\nmake up for severe revenue shortfalls and lack of \r\nfinancing for development programmes.  \r\n The sustainability of what we have achieved is \r\nnow in doubt, and progress could be reversed as a \r\nresult of the economic crisis. That is why it is so \r\nimportant for us to assess the way forward and \r\ndetermine how we will achieve what remains to be \r\nachieved, as well as how we will consolidate and \r\nsecure the progress made and prevent a reversal of the \r\npositive human development trends. Despite those \r\ntremendous challenges, my Government remains \r\ncommitted to the ICPD agenda, to the principles of the \r\nCairo consensus, and to moving forward in the next \r\nfive years with our ambitious and worthy social \r\ndevelopment programmes, which will help us achieve \r\neffective implementation by 2014. \r\n Given the impact of the global economic and \r\nfinancial crisis and the changing population and \r\ndevelopment dynamics, which bring new and emerging \r\nchallenges, an urgent call for action for the Caribbean \r\nsubregion for 2014 and beyond was issued at the \r\nconclusion of the subregional meeting held in Antigua \r\nand Barbuda this August, calling for the establishment \r\nof a five-year subregional strategy. Such a strategy is \r\nnecessary, so that our Governments, working together \r\nand in collaboration with civil society organizations, \r\nparliaments and United Nations agencies, can achieve \r\nthe ICPD targets and the Millennium Development \r\nGoals, by establishing clear priorities for results, \r\nbenchmarks and implementation and monitoring \r\nmechanisms. \r\n I therefore take this opportunity of the \r\ncommemoration of the fifteenth anniversary of ICPD to \r\nrepeat that call for action to the international \r\ncommunity and to urge the United Nations system, \r\nincluding the United Nations Population Fund and \r\nECLAC, to support us in that urgent call to make such \r\na subregional strategy for the Caribbean a reality. With \r\nonly five short years left in the plan of action and with \r\nhuman development indicators turning increasingly \r\nnegative owing to the global recession, we must \r\ngalvanize and coalesce our energies and meagre \r\nresources into a firm strategy for success, and \r\nrecommit ourselves, at all levels, to the worthy \r\nobjectives of ICPD. \r\n Finally, we commend the United Nations \r\nPopulation Fund and other development partners, \r\nwhich have worked so tirelessly in advancing the ICPD \r\nA/64/PV.19  \r\n \r\n09-55571 20 \r\n \r\nProgramme of Action over the past 15 years, and we \r\nlook forward to their continued support and advocacy \r\nin implementing our national development goals. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on the \r\nrepresentative of the Republic of Maldives. \r\n Mr. Mohamed (Maldives): The Cairo \r\nConference on Population and Development in \r\n1994 was instrumental in injecting a very necessary \r\nmultidimensional impetus to the global efforts aimed at \r\npopulation and development. The important goals of \r\nuniversal primary education by 2015, enhanced \r\nreproductive and sexual health, and the reduction of \r\ninfant and maternal mortality rates continue to serve as \r\nimportant objectives that contribute to the national \r\ndevelopment of Member States. \r\n The Maldives is a small island developing State \r\nwith a population of just over a quarter million. \r\nPopulation development forms an integral part of the \r\ncountry’s overall national developmental strategy. As \r\nsuch, many of the goals of the International Conference \r\non Population and Development (ICPD) find \r\nexpression in the overall developmental objectives of \r\nthe Maldives. The provision of health, education, \r\nhousing and youth employment and addressing other \r\nsocial issues and environmental management are \r\ncrucial elements of the country’s population strategy. \r\n However, the available resources and the inherent \r\nsocial and economic situation of the country do not \r\nmatch the determination of the Government to advance \r\nits developmental goals. For instance, the quarter \r\nmillion people in the archipelago live in dispersed \r\nisland communities among 196 inhabited islands. Very \r\nhigh costs are attached to ensuring service delivery to \r\nthe remote islands. As such, the unique geophysical \r\ncharacteristics of the islands, the geographical \r\ndispersion of the population, the limited natural \r\nresources and the patterns of global consumption and \r\npopulation growth present numerous economic, social \r\nand environmental challenges. \r\n Over the past five years, the Maldives has seen a \r\n10 per cent increase in its population, which has \r\nseverely stretched the demand for housing and other \r\neconomic and social services in the country. The \r\nunequal access to education and health facilities in the \r\ncountry has drawn more than a third of the total \r\npopulation to the capital, Malé. The resulting extreme \r\novercrowding in the capital has led to increased \r\nenvironmental degradation on the island, owing \r\nprimarily to over-extraction of groundwater and a \r\ncontaminated aquifer. \r\n Disparities exist within the population in areas \r\nsuch as poverty, income equality, child nutrition, \r\nadequate and affordable housing, and employment for \r\nwomen and young people. The Maldives is also \r\ncurrently grappling with the menace of drug addiction \r\nand the growing violence among youth, as well as a \r\ndisturbing and growing level of violence against \r\nwomen. The United Nations Office on Drugs and \r\nCrime has declared the use of illicit narcotics as the \r\nsingle greatest challenge facing the development of \r\nMaldivian society. With a large proportion of the \r\npopulation under the age of 25 affected by drug use \r\nand abuse, the Government faces a hard journey ahead \r\nin combating trafficking in and use of illicit narcotics. \r\n In addition to those issues, gender equality \r\nremains an immense challenge. Though gains have \r\nbeen made towards ensuring gender equality, women’s \r\nparticipation in public life and leadership positions \r\ncontinues to be low. For instance, even with the \r\nremoval of the constitutional gender bar, which had \r\ntraditionally prevented women from competing for the \r\noffice of President, the total number of women \r\npoliticians has fallen. Cultural stereotyping and \r\ninadequate support networks create barriers to \r\nwomen’s successful participation in public life. Those \r\nissues can largely be attributed to the fact that women \r\nbear a large share of domestic responsibilities. The \r\nsituation is further exacerbated by the prevailing high \r\ndivorce rate, which leads to a situation where many \r\nsingle women bear the brunt of childcare. Flexible \r\nworking hours, together with an adequate social safety \r\nnet, are therefore a necessity for the complete \r\neconomic and social empowerment of women. \r\n Despite the challenges I have highlighted, the \r\nMaldives has made strenuous efforts to meet \r\ninternational development goals. In that regard, the \r\ncountry has adopted a rights-based approach to \r\ndevelopment. Two small achievements can be seen in \r\nthe considerable progress made in reducing population \r\ngrowth to 1.7 per cent and in stabilizing the fertility \r\nrate, which stands at 2. Noteworthy strides in reducing \r\nbirth rates and child and maternal mortality rates have \r\nalso been made. We have also had some success in our \r\nefforts to achieve higher antenatal health coverage, \r\nwhich rose from 62 per cent in 1999 to 91 per cent in \r\n2004. \r\n A/64/PV.19\r\n \r\n21 09-55571 \r\n \r\n Under the national reproductive health strategy \r\nmapped out for the period 2008-2010, issues that need \r\nto be further addressed include high levels of anaemia \r\nand malnutrition among pregnant women; unmet needs \r\nfor contraception; inadequate knowledge of \r\nreproductive tract and sexually transmitted infections; \r\nprevention; and the limited availability of services for \r\nother aspects of reproductive health care, such as \r\ninfertility management and the treatment of \r\nreproductive organ cancers. While increased health \r\nawareness, as well as access to health-care services, \r\nhas led to a decrease in communicable diseases, \r\nchanging lifestyles have contributed to an increase in \r\nnon-communicable illnesses such as heart disease, \r\ncancer and diabetes. \r\n Extensive work needs to be undertaken to address \r\nthese challenges, which jeopardize our overall \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). To meet the growing demands caused by \r\nurban migration, the Government has embarked on the \r\nunprecedented initiative of decentralizing the \r\ngovernance system. This is expected to lessen income \r\ninequality, improve the quality of health and education \r\nservices, increase employment opportunities outside \r\nthe capital and reverse the tide of internal migration. \r\nThe large and rapid displacement of the population has \r\nnot been met with an equal response by Government in \r\nthe provision of economic and social services, which \r\nhas created several social problems. \r\n Resource mobilization is a central focus of the \r\nnew Administration’s development policy. The \r\nMaldives currently allocates more than a quarter of its \r\ndevelopment budget to social development, of which \r\neducation and health share a significant portion. \r\nSubstantial investment is being made in infrastructure \r\ndevelopment to facilitate the provision of key services \r\nin strategic areas of the country. However, stepped-up \r\ninternational developmental assistance to low- and \r\nmiddle-income countries is a prerequisite for the \r\nsuccessful implementation of population development \r\npolicies and for success in achieving national \r\ndevelopment objectives in line with the MDGs. \r\n While some progress has been made in reaching \r\nthe ICPD goals, the Maldives wishes to reiterate the \r\nimportance of strong partnerships between civil \r\nsociety, corporations and Governments in overcoming \r\nthe challenges of population development. It is further \r\nimperative that we fully utilize this opportunity to \r\ncreate greater understanding and recommit ourselves to \r\ninternational cooperation in achieving our common \r\nobjectives and fulfilling shared aspirations for a better \r\nworld. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Mauritania. \r\n Mr. Ould Hadrami (Mauritania) (spoke in \r\nFrench): My delegation associates itself with the \r\nstatement made by the representative of the Sudan on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China. I would like to \r\ncongratulate President Treki on his excellent opening \r\naddress and to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \r\nfor the steadfast support he has given the Programme \r\nof Action of the International Conference on \r\nPopulation and Development (ICPD). \r\n In our view, the commemoration of the fifteenth \r\nanniversary of the ICPD is important because it allows \r\nus to take stock of progress made in implementing the \r\nICPD Programme of Action (see A/CONF.171/13/Rev.1) \r\nand the principal results that have been achieved. For \r\nmy country, Mauritania, this is an opportunity to share \r\nwith you various steps related to the ICPD Programme \r\nof Action taken by our Government, which adopted a \r\nNational Policy Declaration on Population in 1995. \r\nBefore so doing, I would like to pay special tribute to \r\nthe United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and in \r\nparticular to its Executive Director, Ms. Thoraya \r\nObaid, for her leadership and vision concerning \r\npopulation and development issues. \r\n On the political level, we wish to note the \r\nstrengthening of Mauritania’s commitment to \r\npromoting and respecting women’s rights by adhering \r\nto international conventions relating to human rights, \r\nin particular those concerning children’s rights and the \r\nelimination of all forms of discrimination against \r\nwomen. The number of women in elected office has \r\ngrown, largely owing to the introduction in July \r\n2006 of a quota system requiring that 20 per cent of \r\nMauritanians elected be female, which has allowed \r\nwomen to hold 18 of 95 National Assembly seats, nine \r\nof 56 in the Senate, and more than 1,120 seats on \r\nmunicipal councils and even a rural mayor. It is also \r\nhighly symbolic that two months ago we nominated six \r\nfemale ministers, including the Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs, for the first time in our country’s history. \r\n The strong involvement of women at the level of \r\ncivil society, reflected in the high number of women’s \r\nnon-governmental organizations and cooperatives, of \r\nwhich there are about 4,500, and their diverse areas of \r\nA/64/PV.19  \r\n \r\n09-55571 22 \r\n \r\nactivity, is an excellent indicator of the dynamism and \r\nreadiness of Mauritanian women to play a leading role \r\nin grass-roots development. \r\n At the institutional level, we have seen the \r\nadoption of new laws aimed at combating \r\ndiscrimination against women, particularly through the \r\nPersonal Status Code and the laws on compulsory \r\nprimary education, HIV/AIDS and the 20 per cent \r\nquota for parliamentary and municipal council seats. \r\nWe have drawn up a national strategy for the \r\ninstitutionalization of gender issues, and we are taking \r\ninto account the gender aspect in the review process of \r\nour strategic framework to combat poverty and the \r\nestablishment of a group for gender follow-up. The \r\npublic authorities have taken on various issues that had \r\nbeen considered taboo, such as female genital \r\nmutilation, force-feeding and tattooing, and cases of \r\ngender-based violence. Despite social constraints, we \r\nhave seen an increase in the awareness of women, as \r\nsome claim their rights in areas such as spousal abuse. \r\n On economic and social levels, we should note \r\nthat although there have been relatively important \r\ngains in the advancement of women, progress in the \r\neconomic sphere remains far below expectations. After \r\nthe assessment of the first stage of the strategic \r\nframework to combat poverty, it turned out that \r\nwomen’s economic participation saw only a slight \r\nimprovement in terms of their access to production \r\nfactors, in particular at the level of micro-financing, \r\nthrough the Nissa Bank, small and medium-sized \r\nenterprises and other revenue-generating activities. \r\n Mauritania has paid particular attention to the \r\neducation sector in general and to girls’ education in \r\nparticular, with their rate of enrolment exceeding \r\n90 per cent. However, that has been hampered by a \r\nhigh rate of school dropouts among girls, which \r\nreduces their chances of integrating into active life.  \r\n Regarding health-care issues, there have been \r\nimprovements in conditions for mothers and children. \r\nFor example, maternal mortality dropped from 747 per \r\n100,000 live births in 2001 to 686 in 2007. Pregnant \r\nwomen also enjoy greater access to health care \r\nthroughout their pregnancy, including pregnancy \r\npackage plans and the elimination of obstetric fistulas, \r\nand to health care in rural areas in particular. A road \r\nmap has been developed to reduce maternal and \r\nneonatal mortality, and now, in cooperation with \r\nUNFPA and UNICEF, there is a strategy for the \r\nsurvival of children. Health centres for pregnant \r\nwomen have opened, including the hospital for mothers \r\nand children in Nouakchott. \r\n There are still constraints and challenges. We see \r\nthat a long road still lies ahead of us to meet those \r\nchallenges and to overcome the obstacles to the full \r\nand complete participation of Mauritanian women at \r\nall institutional, political, economic, and social levels. \r\nThe major remaining constraints and challenges \r\ninclude the following.  \r\n First, the compulsory education law has not been \r\nsupported by accompanying measures that would \r\nguarantee the continuity of studies, and that has led to \r\na rise in drop-out rates among girls. Secondly, health \r\nindicators are showing rather disquieting signs. The \r\nrate of maternal mortality remains among the highest \r\nin the subregion, and access to health care remains \r\nvery weak. Thirdly, the literacy rate of women is 49 per \r\ncent, while for men it is 66.5 per cent. Fourthly, the \r\npoverty rate of households led by women has gone \r\nfrom 40 to 45 per cent. Fifthly, women still face \r\nenormous difficulties accessing credit — a lack of \r\nguarantees, capital and confidence, for example — and \r\nthat hampers their productivity. Sixthly, the \r\nunemployment rate remains at the very high rate of \r\n47.3 per cent. \r\n Additionally, there are still numerous obstacles to \r\ngender mainstreaming. Coordination of national efforts \r\nto implement the strategy needs further reinforcement. \r\nThe effective implementation of gender mainstreaming \r\nand the desired measures for positive discrimination \r\nrequire the mobilization of greater human and financial \r\nresources.  \r\n It is clear that Mauritania faces difficulties that \r\nprevent it from achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals, in particular Goals 2, 3, 4 and 5, which relate to \r\npopulation. My country will continue its own efforts \r\nwithin this framework and hopes to see, to this end, \r\nincreased support from development partners. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Afghanistan. \r\n Mr. Tanin (Afghanistan): At the outset, let me \r\nthank the President for convening this meeting to \r\ncommemorate the fifteenth anniversary of the \r\nInternational Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment (ICPD) and its resulting Programme of \r\nAction. I would also like to thank the Secretary-\r\n A/64/PV.19\r\n \r\n23 09-55571 \r\n \r\nGeneral for his remarks yesterday and Ms. Thoraya \r\nAhmed Obaid for her stirring call to action on behalf of \r\nthe United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) (see \r\nA/64/PV.17). \r\n Afghanistan aligns itself with the statement \r\ndelivered on behalf of the Group of 77 and China (see \r\nA/64/PV.18). \r\n Afghanistan thanks UNFPA for its leadership role \r\nin implementing the ICPD Programme of Action (see \r\nA/CONF.171/13/Rev.1) since its inception, including \r\nits assistance to Afghanistan. We hope that all nations \r\nwill take this opportunity to recognize our substantial \r\nprogress and take stock of our remaining challenges. \r\n The International Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment, held 15 years ago in Cairo, was a \r\nbreakthrough in the way we collectively understood the \r\nrelationship between people and economic \r\ndevelopment. It ushered in a revolution in our attitudes \r\ntowards reproductive health and human rights. That \r\nunderstanding greatly informed the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), whose tenth anniversary \r\nwe will be celebrating next year. \r\n Afghanistan remains strongly committed to the \r\nICPD Programme of Action, the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and to other internationally agreed \r\ndevelopment goals. Through the framework of the \r\nAfghanistan National Development Strategy and other \r\nnational strategies, Afghanistan is aiming to \r\nsystematically rebuild the shattered infrastructure of \r\nthe country, build a dynamic national economy and \r\nimprove the daily lives of Afghans by providing \r\nsecurity and access to basic services and health care \r\nand by focusing on human rights, particularly the rights \r\nof women and girls. We have made progress in each of \r\nthese areas, and we are certain that with the help of the \r\ninternational community we will eventually be able to \r\nguarantee a dignified, healthy life for all Afghans. \r\n Health indicators in particular in Afghanistan \r\nhave improved since the fall of the Taliban in 2001. \r\nThe percentage of those with access to basic health \r\nservices has increased from 9 per cent in 2001 to \r\n85 per cent in 2008. Use of contraceptives in rural \r\nAfghanistan has tripled, from 5 per cent in the multiple \r\nindicator cluster survey (MICS) conducted in 2003 to \r\n16 per cent in the Afghanistan health survey conducted \r\nin 2006. \r\n Trends in prenatal care in rural Afghanistan show \r\na several-fold increase, from 5 per cent in the \r\n2003 MICS to 32 per cent in the 2006 Afghanistan \r\nhealth survey. Use of skilled birth attendants was \r\nsubstantially lower than use of skilled prenatal care, \r\nbut a threefold increase was observed in rural \r\nAfghanistan, from 6 per cent in the MICS to 19 per \r\ncent in the Afghanistan health survey. Overall, \r\napproximately 15 per cent of women who delivered in \r\nthe last two years had their delivery in an institution. \r\n In addition, over 6 million children are now in \r\nprimary and secondary school in Afghanistan, up from \r\n1 million in 2001. Tens of thousands of students are in \r\nhigher education, and more institutions to \r\naccommodate them are being built every year. Most \r\nnotably, more than 30 per cent of those students are \r\nwomen and girls, something unthinkable under the \r\nTaliban. \r\n However, high rates of maternal and infant \r\nmortality remain a particular challenge in Afghanistan. \r\nIlliteracy, lack of roads and transportation, inadequate \r\nfinancing for many key programmes, inadequately \r\ntrained health staff at all levels, including a general \r\nlack of female health staff, have all contributed to \r\nimpeding access to health services. \r\n Moreover, the deterioration of the security \r\nsituation in certain parts of Afghanistan, especially in \r\nthe south and south-east, has impacted on the gains \r\nmade in the past years in the areas of health and gender \r\nand is impeding the successful achievement of MDGs \r\nin Afghanistan. Finally, the lack of comprehensive, up-\r\nto-date data is a serious impediment to our efforts, and \r\nwe ask UNFPA to continue to support us with technical \r\nand financial assistance as we seek to undertake the \r\nAfghanistan population and housing census, \r\nrescheduled from 2008. \r\n Globally, according to the most recent MDG Gap \r\nTask Force Report, we are still lagging behind in \r\nseveral areas, particularly in MDGs 3, 4, 5 and 6. We \r\nencourage the international community to take this \r\nconference as a call to redouble our efforts towards \r\nachieving the MDGs and the other internationally \r\nagreed development goals in the larger framework of \r\nthe ICPD Programme of Action. In particular, South-\r\nSouth cooperation, through regional groups and other \r\nmultilateral organizations, will be crucial to achieving \r\nour goals. We must also ensure that the financial crisis \r\nand other constraints do not restrict the technical and \r\nA/64/PV.19  \r\n \r\n09-55571 24 \r\n \r\nfinancial aid to developing, least developed and post-\r\nconflict countries.  \r\n Though the past 15 years have seen \r\ngroundbreaking progress, we must sustain those \r\nachievements and recognize that all of our efforts will \r\nbe required if we are to be successful in achieving the \r\nambitious goals we have set for ourselves. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Brazil. \r\n Mrs. Dunlop (Brazil): Fifteen years ago, \r\n179 countries met in Cairo and adopted by consensus \r\nan ambitious 20-year Programme of Action (see \r\nA/CONF.171/13/Rev.1) that contributed to the progress \r\nof the international agenda in such relevant issues as \r\npopulation, development, human rights, reproductive \r\nand sexual health and rights, gender equality and \r\nmigration. It is only fitting that we gather today to \r\ncommemorate that major achievement. I would like to \r\ntake the opportunity of this historic moment to reaffirm \r\nBrazil’s commitment to the principles and objectives of \r\nthe International Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment (ICPD). \r\n The importance of the principles and plan of \r\naction adopted in the Cairo Conference is highlighted \r\nby the fact that a substantive part of that agenda was \r\nfurther consolidated and expanded upon in subsequent \r\nUnited Nations conferences. Many of the Cairo goals \r\nhave in fact become key elements of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), particularly those related \r\nto health, gender, education and cooperation. \r\n It is also important to highlight how the Cairo \r\nConference perceived social and economic \r\ndevelopment as a critical component of long-term \r\nsustainability, particularly one that is balanced in \r\ngender terms, socially inclusive and environmentally \r\nsensitive, and one that provides equal treatment and \r\nopportunities to different age groups.  \r\n In the light of recent trends in global economic \r\ngrowth and development, in which the effects of the \r\nfinancial and economic crisis of 2008 and 2009 are still \r\nhanging over us, it is all the more urgent that the Cairo \r\nplatform be renewed and that implementation of the \r\ncommitments made therein be given impetus. We \r\nshould recast those commitments against the backdrop \r\nof the work yet to be done in the United Nations with \r\nrespect to reshaping the global financial and economic \r\narchitectures under the ongoing processes we agreed to \r\nin last June’s conference on the financial crisis, and \r\nwith respect to the preparations for the conference on \r\nSouth-South cooperation to be held next December in \r\nKenya and our preparations for the September \r\n2010 high-level meeting to review progress on the \r\nMDGs, among other activities of the General \r\nAssembly. A people-centred and employment-led \r\nglobal economic recovery would do justice to the \r\naspirations set out in Cairo 15 years ago. \r\n Brazil recognized the importance of the Cairo \r\nthemes even before 1994. In 1988 our Constitution \r\nrecognized health as a right of all citizens and the \r\nprovision health services as an obligation of the \r\nBrazilian State. Our Government created the Universal \r\nHealth System, which guarantees free, universal public \r\nhealth care and services to everyone who suffers from \r\ndisease and infections, including sexually transmitted \r\nones such as HIV/AIDS.  \r\n Currently, however, the Brazilian Government is \r\ndeeply concerned with the prospects of the \r\nfeminization of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In response to \r\nthat new trend, measures and specific programmes to \r\nreduce the vulnerability of women and teenagers to the \r\nvirus have been put in place.  \r\n Looking back over the last few years, Brazil has \r\nachieved remarkable progress in many areas with \r\nregard to the advancement of women. Since the \r\ncreation in 2003 of the Special Secretariat on Policies \r\nfor Women, the Brazilian Government has adopted a \r\nseries of cross-cutting policies, plans and programmes \r\naimed at empowering women, reducing gender \r\ninequalities and promoting social inclusion. \r\n Important steps have also been taken in \r\ncombating violence against women. The Second \r\nNational Plan of Policies for Women resulted in the \r\nadoption of the National Pact to Curb Violence Against \r\nWomen and the enactment of the Maria da Penha Law, \r\nwhich helped to enforce legal protection in cases of \r\ndomestic violence against women and girls. Another \r\npriority stressed in the National Plan is the \r\nempowerment of women through education and the \r\npromotion of women’s participation in all areas of \r\ndecision-making. The reality in Brazil is that women \r\noutnumber men in schools at all levels. \r\n In Brazil the agenda for sexual and reproductive \r\nhealth and rights in accordance with the principles and \r\nobjectives agreed in Cairo is being fully implemented. \r\nSocial policies have incorporated the outcome of \r\n A/64/PV.19\r\n \r\n25 09-55571 \r\n \r\nvarious national debates in which Brazilian civil \r\nsociety participated actively through the national \r\nthematic conferences. Several advisory councils were \r\ncreated to follow up on the implementation of those \r\ninitiatives.  \r\n The Brazilian national policy for integral \r\nassistance to woman’s health, established in the 1980s, \r\nincludes strategies for reducing maternal and neonatal \r\nmortality and incorporates initiatives inspired by the \r\nagenda of sexual and reproductive health and rights. \r\nThrough a human rights perspective, family planning is \r\nunderstood as a matter of individual choice rather than \r\na strategy for population control. \r\n Despite the progress achieved in the \r\nimplementation of the goals set out in Cairo, \r\nformidable challenges remain. We must do more to \r\npromote gender equality. We must do more to reduce \r\nmaternal and neonatal mortality. We all need to \r\nredouble our national efforts and also to recommit to \r\nincreased cooperation towards the fulfilment of the \r\nCairo Programme of Action during the five remaining \r\nyears. \r\n Brazil will continue to do its part. We will also \r\nwork with all Member States and with the United \r\nNations system, the United Nations Population Fund \r\nand the Commission on Population and Development, \r\nat whose forty-third session we have the honour to \r\nserve as Vice-Chair, in order to further our common \r\ngoals. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Uganda. \r\n Mr. Rugunda (Uganda): It is with great pleasure \r\nthat Uganda joins the rest of the United Nations \r\ncommunity on this auspicious occasion to \r\ncommemorate the International Conference on \r\nPopulation and Development (ICPD).  \r\n I would like to associate Uganda with the \r\nstatement made by the representative of the Sudan on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China. I would also like \r\nto reaffirm Uganda’s commitment to the ICPD \r\nprinciples and Programme of Action (see \r\nA/CONF.171/13/Rev.1) and acknowledge the \r\nimportance of implementing them in the achievement \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\n Uganda participated actively in the events leading \r\nto the ICPD and in the Conference itself, which took \r\nplace in Cairo, Egypt, in 1994. As it did for many other \r\ncountries, the ICPD presented Uganda with an \r\nopportunity to learn from other developed and \r\ndeveloping countries how to make progress on matters \r\nof reproductive health, population and development.  \r\n After the ICPD, Uganda formulated and adopted \r\na national population policy for sustainable \r\ndevelopment. In 2007, the policy was revised in line \r\nwith our national development plan, which runs from \r\n2007 to 2015, and is part of the country’s blueprint for \r\naction to improve maternal, neonatal and reproductive \r\nhealth for the purposes of achieving MDG 5. \r\n An evaluation of the implementation of the \r\nnational population policy has shown that, like many \r\nother nations on the African continent, Uganda \r\ncontinues to have high maternal mortality. A \r\nstrengthened partnership between all stakeholders is \r\nrequired if countries like Uganda are to meet their \r\ntarget to lower maternal mortality by 2015. In \r\nfinalizing its national action plan, Uganda aims to \r\naccelerate the reduction of maternal and neonatal \r\nmorbidity and mortality and to undertake all actions \r\nagreed under the Maputo Plan of Action. \r\n In this regard, Uganda is committed to continuing \r\nto increase the allocation of resources to programmes \r\nand activities geared to achieving the implementation \r\nof the ICPD Programme of Action. There is also \r\nincreased recognition of the need for up-to-date data on \r\npopulation and development to guide us in our \r\ndecision-making. All these issues have been given \r\npriority attention in our draft five-year national \r\ndevelopment plan. \r\n We have identified some key critical areas to \r\nwhich immediate attention should be given. We have \r\nput in place programmes to accelerate economic \r\ngrowth and eradicate poverty and to provide universal \r\nprimary and secondary education, a road map for \r\nreducing maternal and infant mortality, and a draft bill \r\nfor the elimination of female genital mutilation, inter \r\nalia. In addition, Uganda is also taking other positive \r\nsteps in respect of reproductive rights and closing the \r\nlarge gap in unmet needs for family planning. \r\n Uganda’s success in reducing HIV prevalence \r\nfrom a high 18 per cent to a relatively low 6.7 per cent \r\nwill be sustained through strengthened focus on \r\nprevention, especially among those in union, as well as \r\ncontinued efforts in treatment and care through an \r\nintegrated approach. \r\nA/64/PV.19  \r\n \r\n09-55571 26 \r\n \r\n The aforementioned measures show the very \r\ntangible and concrete ways that Uganda is reaffirming \r\nits commitment to delivering on the ICPD Programme \r\nof Action and to achieving the health-related MDGs, \r\nincluding the new target on universal access to \r\nreproductive health, consistent with our national \r\ndevelopment plan. Addressing unmet needs for family \r\nplanning in Uganda would allow upwards of 60 per \r\ncent of women to gain access to reproductive health \r\nservices — a level comparable to that of any middle-\r\nincome country in the world. \r\n We are convinced that our initiative for universal \r\naccess to secondary education will strengthen efforts to \r\ndelay marriage and give girls better career and family \r\nchoices, which is good for women’s empowerment, \r\ngender equality, reproductive rights and, ultimately, \r\neconomic development. \r\n Finally, we recognize that there are still a number \r\nof challenges hindering the smooth implementation of \r\nthe ICPD Programme of Action. Uganda therefore \r\nreiterates its commitment to work with all development \r\npartners in order to continue its implementation. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on the observer \r\nof the Observer State of the Holy See. \r\n Father Bené (Holy See): I make the following \r\nstatement on behalf of the Permanent Observer of the \r\nHoly See, who unfortunately is not able to be with us \r\nhere this afternoon. \r\n As we call to mind the fifteenth anniversary of \r\nthe International Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment (ICPD), we recognize the many \r\nchallenges facing the international community to \r\nachieve the goal of greater sustained economic and \r\nsocial development. \r\n When States came together in Cairo in 1994, \r\nmany of them were under the impression that a \r\npopulation explosion was going to occur and hamper \r\nthe ability to achieve adequate global economic \r\ndevelopment. Now, 15 years later, we see that this \r\nperception was unfounded.  \r\n In many developed countries, population \r\ndemographics have declined to the point where some \r\nnational legislators are now encouraging an increase in \r\nbirth rates to assure continued economic growth. \r\nSimilarly, in many parts of the developing world, \r\ndevelopment has been occurring at previously \r\nunachieved rates and the greatest threat to development \r\nresults not from a population explosion but from \r\nirresponsible world and local economic management. \r\nFor nearly a century, attempts have been made to link \r\nglobal population with the food, energy, natural \r\nresources and environmental crises. Yet, on the \r\ncontrary, it has been consistently demonstrated by \r\nhuman ingenuity and the ability of people to work \r\ntogether that human persons are the world’s greatest \r\nresource. \r\n The ICPD report (A/CONF.171/13/Rev.1) \r\nreiterated the need for States to promote and strengthen \r\nthe family as a vital element of producing greater \r\nsocial and economic development. The ever-increasing \r\npresence of women in the job market has raised new \r\nchallenges for the family and women both in the work \r\nsector and at home. Sexual and economic exploitation, \r\nthe trafficking of women and girls, and discriminatory \r\npractices in the job market have challenged \r\nGovernments to promote and apply policies to end \r\nthose injustices and to support the family in its proper \r\nresponsibilities. \r\n Demographic policies must also take into account \r\nthe needs of migrants as part of an overall \r\nresponsibility to place the human person at the centre \r\nof all development policies. Too often migration is \r\nseen by Governments and individuals as an unwitting \r\nconsequence of globalization, and negative stereotypes \r\nof migrants are used to promote policies that have a \r\ndehumanizing effect and create unconscionable \r\ndivisions within families.  \r\n As noted in the most recent Human Development \r\nReport, migration exists in all regions of the world, \r\nwith migrants often providing necessary skills and \r\ntalents to destination countries while at the same time \r\nensuring valuable support to their countries of origin. \r\nWhile other aspects of the ICPD Programme of Action \r\n(see A/CONF.171/13/Rev.1) have received greater \r\nattention in the past, to truly achieve all the \r\nconstructive proposals of the ICPD report, greater \r\nefforts must be made to enact human-centred policies \r\nthat recognize the shared benefits of migration. More \r\nmust be done to make the ICPD’s appeal for \r\ndevelopment in all countries a means of addressing the \r\nreasons behind migration and to enact policies that \r\nprotect migrants from illegal trafficking. \r\n The ICPD’s call for universal access to quality \r\neducation continues to serve as the most effective \r\nmeans of promoting sustainable economic, social and \r\n A/64/PV.19\r\n \r\n27 09-55571 \r\n \r\npolitical development. It also goes without saying that \r\naccess to education for women and girls at all levels is \r\nat the heart of empowering women within society and \r\npromoting equality between men and women. \r\n Too often in addressing the role of the ICPD on \r\nmaternal health, attempts are made to promote a notion \r\nof sexual and reproductive health that is detrimental to \r\nunborn human life and to the integral needs of women \r\nand men within society. Efforts to address maternal \r\nmortality, obstetric fistula, child mortality, prenatal and \r\nantenatal care, sexually transmitted diseases and other \r\nhealth matters are hampered by sanitary policies that \r\nfail to take into account the right to life of the unborn \r\nchild and that promote birth control as a development \r\npolicy and disguised health service. Suggesting that \r\nreproductive health includes a right to abortion \r\nexplicitly violates the language of the ICPD, defies \r\nmoral and legal standards within local communities, \r\nand divides efforts to address the real needs of mothers \r\nand children. \r\n Renewing our effort to respond to the integral \r\nhealth and social needs of the community entails taking \r\ninto account the social, cultural and spiritual needs of \r\nall and adhering to the international standard set in the \r\nICPD, which calls for national laws to be fully \r\nrespected. For its part, the Catholic Church remains \r\ncommitted to providing access to health care for \r\neveryone. Through their over 5,000 hospitals, \r\n18,000 health clinics and 15,000 homes for the elderly \r\nand disabled, as well as other health-care programmes \r\nthroughout the world, Catholic-based institutions are \r\ncommitted to providing the right to quality and \r\neffective and morally responsible health care for all. \r\n Ultimately, the ICPD final report, like many \r\ndevelopment instruments, must seek to assure \r\nespecially the development of the most vulnerable \r\nwithin society. In that regard, providing for the overall \r\nphysical, emotional and spiritual well-being of children \r\nis paramount in order to ensure that future generations \r\nmay know abject poverty and child mortality as a \r\nhistorical remnant rather than a daily reality. \r\n The Acting President: In accordance with \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 57/29 of 19 November \r\n2002, I now call on the observer for Partners in \r\nPopulation and Development. \r\n Mr. Singh (Partners in Population and \r\nDevelopment): The historic International Conference \r\non Population and Development (ICPD), the fifteenth \r\nanniversary of which we are celebrating today, has \r\nmany firsts to its credit. At the ICPD, for the first time, \r\na far-reaching, comprehensive definition of \r\nreproductive health, including family planning, was \r\nestablished by 179 member countries. Though it is \r\nbased on a working definition used previously by the \r\nWorld Health Organization, it incorporates significant \r\nrevisions of many of the concepts included in the \r\nworking definition and links reproductive health \r\nservices to primary health care. There is clear and \r\nunambiguous recognition of the right of men and \r\nwomen to be informed and to have access to safe, \r\neffective, affordable and acceptable methods of family \r\nplanning of their choice. Since 1994, the ICPD \r\ndefinition of reproductive health has been increasingly \r\nadopted and used by countries all over the world for \r\nthe formulation and implementation of relevant \r\npolicies and programmes. \r\n The Conference set a quantitative goal, for the \r\nfirst time, for the universal delivery of reproductive \r\nhealth services, proposing that such services be \r\nprovided to all individuals of appropriate ages as soon \r\nas possible and no later than 2015. At the same time, it \r\nspecified qualitative goals for improving the quality, \r\noutreach and effectiveness of family planning and \r\nother reproductive health services. It also provided a \r\nset of fairly precise estimates for the mobilization of \r\ndomestic and international resources needed to achieve \r\nthose goals. \r\n A new definition of reproductive rights was \r\nestablished, going well beyond that formulated at the \r\nWorld Population Conference in Bucharest on the \r\nrights of couples and individuals. In that context, the \r\ninclusion in the ICPD Programme of Action (see \r\nA/CONF.171/13/Rev.1) of the right to obtain the \r\nhighest standard of sexual and reproductive health is \r\nhighly significant. Among its other recommendations, \r\nthe Conference sought to delineate the role of men in \r\nsexual and gender relations, crystallized the \r\ninternational community’s growing concern with \r\nHIV/AIDS, assigned high priority to action on unsafe \r\nabortion as a major health concern, emphasized the \r\nneed to give particular attention to the sexual and \r\nreproductive health needs of adolescents, and clearly \r\nlinked the high incidence of maternal mortality to other \r\nissues relating to family planning, women’s health and \r\nsafe motherhood. \r\n The Cairo Conference broke new ground in many \r\nother areas. While emphasizing the integral \r\nA/64/PV.19  \r\n \r\n09-55571 28 \r\n \r\nrelationship between population and development, it \r\nunderscored the importance and urgency of instituting \r\nand implementing population policies. It endorsed a \r\nholistic view of social development and a whole range \r\nof quantitative and qualitative goals within a 20-year \r\nframework, covering health care, education — \r\nparticularly for girls — and a complement of legal and \r\nsocial measures aimed at promoting gender equality. It \r\ngave full and unequivocal support to the concept of \r\npartnership between Governments and civil society. \r\nBut, above all, it will be remembered for the clear links \r\nit established between women’s right to choose and \r\ntheir empowerment.  \r\n The Conference also gave unstinting support to \r\nthe concept of South-South cooperation, and the \r\nPartners in Population and Development (PPD) was \r\nestablished at the Conference itself as a practical \r\ndemonstration of the relevance and importance of that \r\nconcept. Today, PPD groups together with \r\n24 Governments of developing countries and, through \r\na series of programmes in the areas of policy dialogue, \r\ntraining, research, information exchange and technical \r\nassistance, seeks to promote and strengthen South-\r\nSouth cooperation with respect to population and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n The goals of ICPD are now firmly linked to the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). But, as in \r\nthe case of the MDGs, there has been insufficient \r\nprogress towards achieving the ICPD goals by 2015, \r\nparticularly in the areas of universal reproductive \r\nhealth services and maternal health. The current \r\neconomic crisis makes that task doubly difficult, \r\nparticularly in the poorer countries, most of which are \r\nin Africa.  \r\n Before I close, I would like to pay a special \r\ntribute to Ms. Nafis Sadik, Secretary-General of ICPD, \r\nunder whose visionary leadership ICPD achieved its \r\nhistoric results, and to Ms. Thoraya Obaid, Executive \r\nDirector of the United Nations Population Fund \r\n(UNFPA), under whose direction UNFPA has sought, \r\nin a steadfast and consistent manner, the promotion of \r\nand support for the achievement of the ICPD goals.  \r\n The commemoration of the fifteenth anniversary \r\nof the ICPD gives us all the opportunity to reflect on \r\nhow much remains to be done and, as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral pointed out at the beginning of this debate, to \r\nrecommit ourselves to achieving the ICPD goals and \r\nthe MDGs through increased political commitment; the \r\nimplementation of effective policies and programmes \r\nat the national level, with sustained support by \r\ninternational organizations such as UNFPA; and the \r\nallocation of adequate domestic and international \r\nresources to get the job done. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate to commemorate the fifteenth \r\nanniversary of the International Conference on \r\nPopulation and Development.  \r\n The General Assembly has thus concluded this \r\nstage of its consideration of agenda item 48. \r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
