(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 110 \r\n \r\nElections to fill vacancies in principal organs \r\n \r\n (a) Election of five non-permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The General \r\nAssembly will now proceed to the election of five \r\nnon-permanent members of the Security Council to \r\nreplace those members whose term of office expires on \r\n31 December 2009. \r\n The five outgoing non-permanent members are \r\nthe following: Burkina Faso, Costa Rica, Croatia, the \r\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya and Viet Nam. Those five \r\nStates cannot be re-elected. Their names, therefore, \r\nshould not appear on the ballot papers. \r\n Apart from the five permanent members, the \r\nSecurity Council will include in the year 2010 the \r\nfollowing States: Austria, Japan, Mexico, Turkey and \r\nUganda. The names of those States, therefore, should \r\nalso not appear on the ballot papers. \r\n Of the five non-permanent members that will \r\nremain in office in the year 2010, two are from Africa \r\nand Asia, one is from Latin America and the Caribbean \r\nand two are from Western European and other States. \r\nConsequently, pursuant to paragraph 3 of General \r\nAssembly resolution 1991 A (XVIII), of 17 December \r\n1963, the five non-permanent members should be \r\nelected according to the following pattern: three from \r\nAfrica and Asia, one from Eastern Europe and one \r\nfrom Latin America and the Caribbean. The ballot \r\npapers reflect that pattern. \r\n In accordance with established practice, there is \r\nan understanding to the effect that, of the three States \r\nto be elected from Africa and Asia, two should be from \r\nAfrica and one from Asia. \r\n I should like to inform the Assembly that those \r\ncandidates, their number not exceeding the number of \r\nseats to be filled, receiving the greatest number of \r\nvotes and a two-thirds majority of those present and \r\nvoting, will be declared elected. In the case of a tie \r\nvote for a remaining seat, there will be a restricted \r\nballot limited to those candidates that have obtained an \r\nequal number of votes. \r\n May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to \r\nthat procedure? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): In accordance \r\nwith rule 92 of the rules of procedure, the election shall \r\nbe held by secret ballot and there shall be no nominations. \r\n Regarding candidatures, I have been informed by \r\nthe Chairpersons of the respective regional groups of \r\nthe following. For the three vacant seats from among \r\nthe African and Asian States, there are three endorsed \r\ncandidates, namely, Gabon, Lebanon and Nigeria. For \r\nthe one vacant seat from among the Eastern European \r\nStates, there is one endorsed candidate, namely, Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina. For the one vacant seat from among \r\nthe Latin American and Caribbean States, there is one \r\nendorsed candidate, namely, Brazil.  \r\nA/64/PV.20  \r\n \r\n09-55962 2 \r\n \r\n In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of \r\nprocedure, we shall now proceed to the election by \r\nsecret ballot. \r\n Before we begin the voting process, I should like \r\nto remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the \r\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly, no \r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a \r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting. \r\n We shall now begin the voting process. Members \r\nare requested to remain seated until all ballots have \r\nbeen collected. \r\n Ballot papers marked “A”, “B” and “C” will now \r\nbe distributed. I request representatives to use only \r\nthose ballot papers that have been distributed. \r\n May I ask representatives to write clearly on the \r\nballot papers marked “A”, for the African and Asian \r\nStates, the names of the three States for which they \r\nwish to vote; on the ballot papers marked “B”, for the \r\nEastern European States, the name of the one State for \r\nwhich they wish to vote; and on the ballot papers \r\nmarked “C”, for the Latin American and Caribbean \r\nStates, the names of the one State for which they wish \r\nto vote. \r\n A ballot will be declared invalid if it contains \r\nmore names of Member States from the relevant region \r\nthan the number of seats assigned to it. A ballot will \r\nalso be declared invalid if all the names of the Member \r\nStates on that ballot do not belong to the relevant \r\nregion. If a ballot paper contains names of Member \r\nStates that do not belong to that region, the ballot \r\nremains valid, but only the names of the Member \r\nStates that belong to the relevant region will be \r\ncounted. The names of Member States that do not \r\nbelong to that region will not be counted at all. \r\n At the invitation of the President, Ms. Weston \r\n(Australia), Ms. Del Águila-Castillo (Guatemala), \r\nMs. Würtz (Hungary), Ms. Beshimova (Kyrgyzstan), \r\nMr. Blatter (Switzerland) and Mr. Chigejo \r\n(Zimbabwe) acted as tellers. \r\n  A vote was taken by secret ballot. \r\n \r\n  The meeting was suspended at 10.30 a.m. and \r\nresumed at 11.30 a.m. \r\n \r\n The President: The result of the voting is as \r\nfollows: \r\n Group A — African and Asian States \r\n Number of ballot papers:   190 \r\nNumber of invalid ballots:   0 \r\nNumber of valid ballots:    190 \r\nAbstentions:     0 \r\nNumber of members voting:  190 \r\nRequired two-thirds majority:  127 \r\nNumber of votes obtained:   \r\n Nigeria     186 \r\n Gabon     184 \r\n Lebanon     180 \r\n Togo      1 \r\n Sierra Leone    1 \r\n Iran (Islamic Republic of)  1 \r\n Liberia     1 \r\n Group B — Eastern European States \r\n Number of ballot papers:    190 \r\nNumber of invalid ballots:    0 \r\nNumber of valid ballots:    190 \r\nAbstentions:      7 \r\nNumber of members voting:   183 \r\nRequired two-thirds majority:   122 \r\nNumber of votes obtained:  \r\n Bosnia and Herzegovina   183 \r\n Group C — Latin American and Caribbean States \r\n Number of ballot papers:    190 \r\nNumber of invalid ballots:    0 \r\nNumber of valid ballots:    190 \r\nAbstentions:      7 \r\nNumber of members voting:   183 \r\nRequired two-thirds majority:   122 \r\nNumber of votes obtained:  \r\n Brazil        182 \r\n Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)  1 \r\n  Having obtained the required two-thirds majority, \r\nthe following States were elected members of the \r\nSecurity Council for a two-year term beginning \r\n1 January 2010: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, \r\nGabon, Lebanon and Nigeria. \r\n \r\n The President: I congratulate the States that have \r\nbeen elected members of the Security Council, and I \r\nthank the tellers for their assistance in this election.  \r\n This concludes our consideration of sub-item (a) \r\nof agenda item 110. \r\nThe meeting rose at 11.35 a.m. \r\n \r\n"
