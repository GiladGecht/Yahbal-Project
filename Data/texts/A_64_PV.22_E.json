It signified Africa’s willingness, capacity \r\nand determination to assume full control of its destiny. \r\nThe entire international community has welcomed \r\nNEPAD as an African-owned and African-driven \r\npolitical, economic and social development blueprint \r\nfor the continent’s future. In this context, the African \r\nPeer Review Mechanism has been widely acclaimed as \r\na positive and innovative approach to ensuring good \r\ngovernance. Thirty African countries have acceded to \r\nthe Mechanism, and 12 of those have been peer-\r\nreviewed. \r\n In September of last year the General Assembly’s \r\nhigh-level meeting on African development adopted a \r\ndeclaration (resolution 63/1) that not only underlined \r\nits full commitment to meeting Africa’s development \r\nneeds but also called for a mechanism to ensure that \r\nMember States continued to address those challenges, \r\ntaking into account that a stronger Africa also requires \r\na stronger United Nations system. In this regard, we \r\nneed to strengthen our commitment and consider the \r\nbest ways to advance NEPAD — a comprehensive, \r\nAfrican continental programme based on the \r\nconsolidation of democracy and good governance — \r\nby implementing eight priority areas: infrastructure; \r\npolitical, economic and corporate governance; \r\nagriculture; education; health; science and technology; \r\nmarket access and tourism; and environment. \r\n Special attention to Africa is vital to achieving \r\ninternationally agreed development goals, including \r\nthose set out in the Millennium Declaration (resolution \r\n55/2), and is essential for putting the continent firmly \r\nback on the world’s development agenda and on a path \r\nto irreversible and sustainable development.  \r\nA/64/PV.22  \r\n \r\n09-56757 2 \r\n \r\n It is encouraging that there has been progress in \r\nimplementing the various components of NEPAD’s \r\nupdated Programme for Infrastructure Development in \r\nAfrica, which focuses on energy, transport, water and \r\nsanitation, and information and communications \r\ntechnology. On the environment front, African \r\nenvironment ministers have adopted a common \r\nplatform for the global climate change negotiations \r\nleading up to Copenhagen in December. Under the \r\nleadership of the African Union Commission, in \r\ncollaboration with the Economic Commission for \r\nAfrica and the African Development Bank, good \r\nprogress has also been made in the preparatory phase \r\nof the Climate for Development in Africa programme, \r\nincluding progress in the establishment of the African \r\nClimate Policy Center as the programme’s policy arm. \r\n I welcome the efforts to implement the African \r\nLeaders Malaria Alliance initiative, aimed at protecting \r\nall those at risk from malaria with lifesaving \r\ninterventions by the end of 2010. It is tragic and \r\nunacceptable that malaria kills almost a million \r\nAfricans every year and affects over 200 million more, \r\nmostly women, pregnant women and children under \r\nfive years of age. \r\n It is therefore essential that the international \r\ncommunity provide enhanced support for NEPAD’s \r\nproposed agenda in order to tackle poverty, disease, the \r\nfood crisis, climate change and the financial and \r\neconomic crisis, all of which have undermined Africa’s \r\nefforts to achieve its development objectives, \r\nespecially the Millennium Development Goals. Those \r\ncrises threaten the livelihoods, well-being and \r\ndevelopment opportunities of millions of people, \r\nexacerbate political and social tensions and hamper the \r\ncapacity of States to deliver basic services to their \r\ncitizens. \r\n Thus it is essential to create an environment \r\nconducive to investment and long-term economic \r\ngrowth in Africa, fired with a sense of urgency and \r\nbacked by concrete actions. Africa’s own efforts must \r\nbe complemented by a substantial commitment from \r\nthe international community, a better understanding of \r\nthe special needs of Africa and greater coordination \r\nbetween policies and programmes. The international \r\ncommunity must redouble its efforts to ensure full, \r\neffective and timely implementation of the \r\ncommitments made for Africa’s development. I believe \r\nthe September 2010 high-level meeting will be an \r\nimportant occasion to review and re-energize the \r\npursuit of development objectives, particularly in \r\nAfrica, and I therefore encourage all Member States to \r\nwork for its success. I hope this debate will provide \r\nuseful input and insight for that process. \r\n Mr. Lidén (Sweden): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of the European Union. Turkey, Croatia, the \r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Albania, \r\nMontenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ukraine, \r\nRepublic of Moldova and Serbia align themselves with \r\nthis statement. \r\n We welcome this opportunity to jointly discuss \r\ndevelopment and health, as well as peace and security \r\nin Africa. \r\n Africa is a major partner of the European Union \r\n(EU). Through globalization our two continents’ \r\nopportunities and challenges are becoming increasingly \r\nintertwined. The EU wants to make common cause \r\nwith Africa in tackling problems and making the best \r\nof our joint opportunities. \r\n The EU-Africa Joint Strategy agreed in 2007 is a \r\nvery good basis for our increasingly deepening \r\ncooperation. Last week, the ministerial troikas of the \r\nEU and the African Union (AU) met at Addis Ababa. \r\nThey addressed situations of common concern in \r\nSomalia and the Sudan and expressed deep concern \r\nover the situation in Guinea. They agreed to work \r\ntogether on climate change in the lead up to \r\nCopenhagen. \r\n There are reasons for optimism about Africa’s \r\ndevelopment despite many unresolved challenges and a \r\nglobal financial crisis. Peace, political freedom and \r\neconomic growth have progressed in recent years. But \r\nAfrica, like no other continent, is heavily affected by \r\nthe current economic downturn. It also carries a \r\ndisproportionate weight when it comes to food security \r\nand climate change. \r\n The European Union is fully committed to \r\nsupporting African countries and their peoples in their \r\nquest for peace, democracy, respect for human rights \r\nand sustainable development. The EU will continue to \r\nbuild on the positive developments in Africa of the last \r\ndecade. Despite slow progress in many areas, reaching \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in Africa \r\nseems possible if all of us accelerate our efforts for the \r\nfinal stretch leading to 2015. \r\n In only seven years, the AU has become an \r\nindispensable regional actor. Africa’s regional \r\n A/64/PV.22\r\n \r\n3 09-56757 \r\n \r\ncooperation is gaining momentum. This is a positive \r\nsignal, as Africa’s problems can best be solved through \r\njoint efforts, by Africans themselves. The EU praises \r\nthe assessment of AU member States through the \r\nAfrican Peer Review Mechanism. \r\n Africa’s voice in international trade negotiations \r\ncan be strengthened through regional cooperation. \r\nAfrican integration leaves Africa better equipped to \r\ndeal with peace and security issues, economic and \r\nsocial questions, as well as climate change.  \r\n Climate change, food security and development \r\nare global concerns and should not be dealt with \r\nseparately, as was pointed out in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report. The specific nature of the concerns \r\nmay differ, but we share some fundamental challenges \r\nin how to address them in an effective manner. \r\n The African-European strategic partnership is \r\nguided by basic principles of the unity of Africa, the \r\ninterdependence between Africa and Europe, \r\nownership and joint responsibility, respect for human \r\nrights, democratic principles and the rule of law, as \r\nwell as the right to development. \r\n It is clear that the African continent is responsible \r\nfor its own development. This is the core approach of \r\nthe New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD). Support from the international community \r\nmust be aimed at helping the African continent develop \r\nits potential on the basis of its own resources. Our aim \r\nshould be to switch the emphasis from aid to \r\ncooperation and trade as soon as possible. \r\n The aim of the partnership is to facilitate an open, \r\nbroad-based dialogue and cooperation on human rights \r\nand democratic governance, including the full \r\nenjoyment of such rights by women and children. I \r\nwould like to draw particular attention to women in \r\nAfrica. Women’s rights and opportunities are \r\nfundamental for peacebuilding, economic growth, \r\ndevelopment and well-being. \r\n The EU reaffirms its overall collective official \r\ndevelopment assistance target of providing 0.56 per \r\ncent of gross national income (GNI) by next year, and \r\n0.7 per cent of GNI by 2015. Of the increases, we will \r\nchannel at least 50 per cent to Africa. We are also \r\nimproving coherence among EU policies in the areas of \r\nresource mobilization and more effective development \r\nassistance. \r\n Trade is a necessary prerequisite for economic \r\ngrowth and sustainable efforts against poverty. \r\nTogether we must continue promoting a market-\r\noriented world trading system. Access for African \r\ngoods and services to international markets, including \r\nthe European, needs to be improved. A successful \r\nconclusion of the Doha Round in 2010 is crucial and a \r\ntop priority for the European Union. \r\n Another challenge for us all in Africa is health. \r\nAfrica faces a huge burden of potentially preventable \r\nand treatable diseases which cause unnecessary deaths \r\nand untold suffering, while simultaneously blocking \r\neconomic development and damaging the continent’s \r\nsocial fabric. Experts increasingly agree that infectious \r\ndiseases are the most negative factor for Africa’s \r\ndevelopment and seriously hamper efforts to reach the \r\nMDGs. \r\n AIDS remains the leading cause of death in \r\nAfrica; an unimaginable number of 300,000 African \r\nchildren are born with HIV each year. Another health \r\nchallenge relates to Africa’s women. Nineteen of the \r\n20 countries with the highest maternal mortality rate \r\nare in Africa. Last year, more than 250,000 women \r\ndied of complications during pregnancy and childbirth. \r\nThis is simply unacceptable. \r\n Malaria inflicts a great toll on Africa. Every \r\n30 seconds, a child somewhere in the world is killed by \r\nmalaria. Approximately 1 million people are killed by \r\nmalaria each year, with the majority of those deaths in \r\nAfrica. It is estimated that malaria costs Africa more \r\nthan $12 billion each year in direct losses. \r\n In recent years, significant progress has been \r\nmade in the fight against malaria. Rwanda, Eritrea and \r\nZambia have shown how it is possible to roll back this \r\ndisease. A clear focus on effective intervention, \r\nincreased funding and political determination have \r\nproven to be successful. We welcome the establishment \r\nof the African Leaders Malaria Alliance (ALMA) \r\nformed to ensure political championing of action \r\nagainst malaria. \r\n However, significant financial gaps remain. As \r\nthe world’s largest donor both in general and in the \r\nhealth sector in particular, the EU will continue to lead \r\nglobal efforts to sustain financial commitments in \r\nresponse to malaria. \r\n Combating HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, \r\nthrough strengthening of national health systems, will, \r\nA/64/PV.22  \r\n \r\n09-56757 4 \r\n \r\nin our view, be one of the most effective ways to \r\nalleviate poverty and promote equitable and \r\nsustainable economic progress. The burden of those \r\nthree diseases severely affects the poorest countries. \r\nWe need to further invest in the health-care workforce \r\nand build capacity for prevention, treatment and care. \r\n In the past decade a number of armed conflicts in \r\nAfrica have ended. We have seen peaceful resolutions \r\nto brutal conflicts in Angola, Sierra Leone and Liberia. \r\nAlso, progress is being made in Burundi with elections \r\nplanned for next year. A settlement of the crisis in Côte \r\nd’Ivoire seems to be within reach. The recent \r\ndiplomatic reconciliation between the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo and its neighbours, still to be \r\nconsolidated, opens the possibility for regional \r\ncooperation to pave the way for long-term stabilization \r\nof the Great Lakes region. \r\n At the same time, however, armed conflicts \r\ncontinue in the Sudan, Somalia and the eastern \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, with great \r\nsuffering of civilians. The European Union is also \r\nseriously concerned at the increasingly violent political \r\nclimate in Guinea.  \r\n We have also seen a disturbing resurgence of \r\nunconstitutional changes of government in Africa. That \r\ndevelopment threatens to undermine the stability of the \r\ncontinent and the promotion of durable peace and \r\nsustainable development. On a more positive note, we \r\nwelcome the swift action taken by the African Union \r\nand the regional economic communities following the \r\nunconstitutional changes of government in Guinea, \r\nMadagascar and Mauritania. \r\n Members of the European Union support and \r\nparticipate in the work of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, especially in its country-specific \r\nconfigurations for Burundi, Sierra Leone, Guinea-\r\nBissau and the Central African Republic. The \r\nCommission can lend important support to national \r\npriorities and be an effective forum for strengthened \r\nmutual accountability. The diversity of the membership \r\nof the Commission has provided broad international \r\nlegitimacy to the peacebuilding agenda. \r\n The European Union actively supports the \r\nAfrican Union and the African agenda for peace and \r\ndevelopment. Such cooperation could be further \r\nfacilitated by a strengthened dialogue between the \r\nEuropean Union and Africa in the framework of the \r\nUnited Nations. The support for Africa’s search for \r\npeace is one of the European Union’s priorities. Under \r\nthe framework of the African Peace Facility, the \r\nEuropean Union has committed an additional \r\n€300 million for the period from 2008 to 2010. In \r\naddition, the European Union currently has four \r\nmissions deployed on the African continent within the \r\nframework of the European Security and Defence \r\nPolicy.  \r\n To conclude, after decades of lost growth, there \r\nare now signs that Africa is turning a corner. Africa is \r\nfinding its place on the global arena, not least through \r\nthe African Union engagement in finding solutions \r\nboth to African and to international challenges. The \r\nEuropean Union joins the countries and people of \r\nAfrica in their endeavour to realize their ambitions. \r\n Mr. Sharif (Sudan): I have the honour to deliver \r\nthis statement on behalf of the member States of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China on agenda items 63 and 47. We \r\nwish to thank the Secretary-General for his reports on \r\nthe items that we are discussing today. \r\n African countries have taken concrete steps to \r\nimplement the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) through the development of \r\nsectorial policy frameworks, the design of specific \r\nprojects and the establishment of expenditure targets in \r\nNEPAD priority areas. Much has been achieved in \r\nAfrica since the adoption of the Millennium \r\nDeclaration (resolution 55/2) in 2000, NEPAD and an \r\nAfrican Union programme that is now under way. \r\nAfrican leaders have taken ownership and leadership of \r\nthe continent’s socio-economic renewal agenda and \r\nhave transformed the content of the development \r\nagenda through NEPAD. \r\n The NEPAD policies and priorities have become \r\nan acceptable and approved framework for Africa’s \r\ndevelopment. Through NEPAD, African countries have \r\nfundamentally changed the development paradigm. The \r\nnarrow approach of the Poverty Reduction Strategy \r\nPapers has been expanded to include a comprehensive \r\nand holistic approach to development through African \r\nownership. In fact, most African countries now have \r\ntheir own national development strategies. Those \r\nefforts require an enabling national and international \r\nenvironment conducive to growth and development, \r\nwith the participation of the multi-stakeholders. \r\nDespite efforts in implementing NEPAD, Africa is still \r\nfar from realizing the levels of support required under \r\nthat partnership. \r\n A/64/PV.22\r\n \r\n5 09-56757 \r\n \r\n In the 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution \r\n60/1), the heads of State and Government stated that \r\nAfrica was the only continent not on track to meet the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. \r\nThat was reiterated in the follow-up resolutions (63/1 \r\nand 63/239, annex), which emphasized that vigorous \r\nimplementation of the development commitments were \r\nneeded without delay, in particular those commitments \r\nmade in support of African development, which faces \r\nserious challenges requiring collective action on the \r\npart of African countries and the international \r\ncommunity.  \r\n Resources must be mobilized for African States \r\nto support efforts aimed at achieving the MDGs within \r\nthe framework of national development programmes \r\nand at implementing the NEPAD programme. Urgent \r\nand concerted action by developed countries and the \r\ninternational community is needed to succeed in \r\neradicating poverty and hunger in Africa. In that \r\nregard, the Group of 77 and China reiterates that the \r\nmain challenge remaining for the development of \r\nAfrica is a global partnership for development that \r\nmust be fully implemented. It has become clear that \r\ndespite all the actions and commitments by African \r\ncountries, the main constraint to African development \r\nremains the lack of adequate resources. \r\n The African Union has made substantial progress \r\nin conflict prevention by creating mechanisms that are \r\ninstrumental for the promotion of durable peace and \r\nsustainable development on the continent. African \r\nownership in resolving conflicts has produced \r\nremarkable results. Conflict prevention and the \r\nconsolidation of peace must benefit from the \r\ncoordinated, sustained and integrated efforts of the \r\nUnited Nations system, Member States and regional \r\nand subregional organizations, as well as from \r\ninternational and regional financial institutions. \r\nDevelopment is the best contributor to peace; hence, \r\nachieving development, economic growth and poverty \r\neradication should be at the heart of conflict prevention \r\nstrategies. At the same time, there should be a \r\ncoordinated and comprehensive approach towards \r\ncombining peacebuilding, emergency assistance and \r\nlonger-term development support measures. \r\n Progress towards sustaining development in \r\nAfrica requires, among other steps, writing off the \r\nunsustainable debt of African countries, both by \r\nbilateral and by multilateral donors. Reaching the \r\ntarget of reducing poverty by half by 2015 would \r\nrequire an average growth rate of 7 to 8 per cent per \r\nannum. To achieve that rather high rate of growth, we \r\ncall for a number of measures towards mobilizing \r\nexternal resources. \r\n As far as the environment is concerned, we \r\nrecognize the importance of addressing, in an \r\ninterrelated and mutually supportive manner, the three \r\ndimensions of sustainable development. The Group of \r\n77 and China, therefore, strongly calls for \r\nstrengthening measures to enhance assistance to the \r\nAfrican countries in their fight against land \r\ndegradation, drought and desertification by multilateral \r\nand bilateral donors and through public and private \r\npartnership. \r\n HIV/AIDS and malaria pandemics are taking a \r\ncatastrophic toll on many African societies, paralysing \r\ntheir economies and ruining their social fabric. The \r\ninternational community should be acutely aware that \r\nmuch more substantial collective effort is needed for \r\neffective prevention, care and impact mitigation of \r\nthese deadly pandemics. There is now growing \r\nawareness of the tragedy and its ruinous impact; what \r\nis badly needed is genuine political commitment, the \r\ncommensurate provision of requisite funds and a \r\nprogrammatic response to these pandemics.  \r\n We call upon the international community to \r\ncontinue supporting the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \r\nTuberculosis and Malaria as well as country-led \r\ninitiatives to create conditions for full access to \r\ninsecticide-treated mosquito nets, insecticides for \r\nindoor residual spraying for malaria control and \r\neffective anti-malarial combination treatments, \r\nincluding through the free distribution of mosquito nets \r\nwhere appropriate. \r\n Mr. Tommo Monthe (Cameroon), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair.  \r\n Finally, the Group of 77 and China urges the \r\ninternational community to remain conscious of the \r\nfact that the food crisis, the energy crisis and climate \r\nchange are having some of their worst impacts in \r\nAfrica. The global financial economic crisis has \r\nproduced profound adverse impacts on African \r\ndevelopment. Poor African countries, with their high \r\ndependence on agricultural commodity exports, are \r\namong the most adversely affected by the failure of \r\nglobal trade negotiations and the continued application \r\nof massive subsidies by developed countries. Official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) has shrunk to \r\nA/64/PV.22  \r\n \r\n09-56757 6 \r\n \r\nhistorically low levels, representing less than one third \r\nof internationally agreed targets. It is imperative that \r\nODA be increased, and, of course, combined with a set \r\nof other policy measures that would enhance \r\ndevelopment in the countries of Africa.  \r\n Mr. Jomaa (Tunisia): I have the honour of \r\ndelivering this statement on agenda items 63 and 47, \r\nwhich deal with the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) and the 2001-2010 Decade to \r\nRoll Back Malaria, respectively, on behalf of the Group \r\nof African States.  \r\n The African Group associates itself with the \r\nstatement made by the representative of the Sudan on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China. We wish to thank \r\nthe Secretary-General for the three comprehensive \r\nreports under consideration (A/64/204, A/64/208 and \r\nA/64/210).  \r\n The political declaration on Africa’s development \r\nneeds (resolution 63/1), adopted at the high-level \r\nmeeting on 22 September 2008 (see A/63/PV.4), \r\nreflects the resolve of Member States to strengthen and \r\nintensify international cooperation to find a long-term \r\nsolution to Africa’s development needs. \r\n The high-level meeting acknowledged that \r\ntremendous gains were possible if the global \r\ncommunity translated its commitments into concrete \r\nresults. Unfortunately, the Secretary-General’s reports \r\nremind us that most African countries remain off-track \r\nwith respect to achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). The combined effect of the economic, \r\nfinancial and food crises, as well as climate change and \r\nhigh energy prices, has undermined gains in poverty \r\nreduction and threatens to reverse the gains achieved \r\nover the last seven years in meeting some of the \r\nMDGs. \r\n No one is more responsible for Africa’s \r\ndevelopment than the African people themselves, as \r\nwell as their States and institutions. African countries \r\nhave taken huge steps to implement NEPAD. The past \r\nyear has witnessed progress in achieving NEPAD \r\nprojects in key sectors such as infrastructure, the \r\nComprehensive Africa Agriculture Development \r\nProgramme, education and training, environment, \r\ninformation and communication technologies, science \r\nand technology. Equally, there has been progress in \r\nmoving the African Peer Review Mechanism forward, \r\nwith 30 countries acceding and 12 countries’ peer \r\nreviews completed. In addition, strategies, tools and \r\napproaches to gender mainstreaming within NEPAD \r\nhave been under development since 2004 and progress \r\nhas been made in the implementation of some NEPAD \r\nprogrammes aiming at the empowerment of African \r\nwomen. \r\n Similarly, the international community, including \r\nthe United Nations, should take concerted and urgent \r\naction to mitigate the socio-economic impact of the \r\nfinancial and economic crisis and help African \r\ncountries recover ground in their progress towards the \r\nimplementation of NEPAD and the achievement of the \r\nMDGs. In particular, development partners should \r\ndeliver on their aid commitments. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral recommends in his report on NEPAD that \r\ndonors significantly increase aid disbursement in \r\n2009 and 2010 in order to maintain their commitments \r\nto provide Africa with an additional $25 billion in \r\nofficial development assistance per year by 2010, at \r\n2004 prices. \r\n Moreover, developed country partners should \r\ntake further steps and concrete measures to increase \r\ntheir foreign direct investment and technology transfer \r\nlevels into Africa and successfully conclude the Doha \r\nRound of trade negotiations with a development \r\ndimension by honouring their promises to reduce tariff \r\nand non-tariff barriers to African products and to \r\neliminate agricultural subsidies that distort global \r\ntrade, without undermining food aid to Africa. The full \r\nimplementation and operationalization of the Aid for \r\nTrade initiative in African countries is needed, if they \r\nare to implement and benefit from World Trade \r\nOrganization agreements and expand their trade and \r\nmarkets. \r\n By the same token, African countries attach great \r\nimportance to South-South cooperation, particularly in \r\ninfrastructure, technical support and other productive \r\nand innovative sectors. \r\n As far as climate change is concerned, \r\ndevelopment partners should lend strong support to \r\naddressing its effects by investing in mitigation and \r\nadaptation measures for the prevention of deforestation \r\nand by increasing funding for renewable energy in \r\nAfrica, such as solar, wind and geothermal power. \r\nEvery effort should be made to move away from coal-\r\nbased projects towards these energy sources. In doing \r\nso, development partners should take Africa’s \r\ndevelopment needs into full account in the negotiations \r\n A/64/PV.22\r\n \r\n7 09-56757 \r\n \r\nleading up to the United Nations Climate Change \r\nConference. \r\n Although some progress was seen in 2008 in \r\ntrade liberalization and ease of doing business, African \r\nStates are still far from achieving the agriculture target \r\nof allocating 10 per cent of their national budgets to \r\nagricultural development and exceed the 6 per cent \r\nagricultural sector growth target. With respect to \r\nhealth, at a time of multiple crises, African States were \r\nnot in a position to spend 15 per cent of their budgets \r\non health, as was called for in the African Union Abuja \r\nDeclaration. These two sectors present examples where \r\ndevelopment partners should work together with \r\nAfrican States to address their specific needs. \r\n The world financial and economic crisis presents \r\na unique challenge to African countries as their \r\neconomies are heavily dependent on exporting a small \r\nnumber of commodities. In this regard, Africa’s \r\ndevelopment partners should enhance their assistance \r\nto African Governments to strengthen regional \r\nintegration and diversify their exports in order to cope \r\nwith the demands of global markets. \r\n The continent is exploring ways and means to \r\nrestore and consolidate peace and stability as a \r\nprerequisite for the achievement of internationally \r\nagreed development goals and Africa’s integration into \r\nthe global economy. Fortunately, many volatile regions \r\nhave attained sustainable levels of stability, and others \r\nhave witnessed a reduction in the level of conflict. \r\n That has been due, among other reasons, to \r\ntransformations in the African Union (AU) and its \r\nPeace and Security Architecture, the United Nations \r\nmultidimensional approach to peacekeeping, the \r\nrenewed commitment of the international community \r\nto confront the scourge of conflict, the establishment of \r\nthe AU’s Panel of the Wise, the deepening cooperation \r\namong the AU, the United Nations and subregional \r\norganizations and the establishment of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission to provide support to \r\ncountries emerging from conflict. \r\n We believe that ensuring economic and social \r\ndevelopment is the best way to prevent conflicts in \r\nAfrica. In this regard, the African Group agrees with \r\nthe Secretary-General’s report that new and creative \r\nprogrammes must be found to generate human, \r\nfinancial and technical resources and effective \r\npartnerships to ensure that the link between peace and \r\ndevelopment is appropriately addressed at all stages in \r\nall peace efforts. \r\n All stakeholders should therefore work together \r\nwith an integrated approach to address the root causes \r\nof tension on the continent, such as unemployment, \r\nfood insecurity and the effects of climate change, such \r\nas water scarcity and desertification. The continent is \r\naware of the need to enhance democratic governance \r\nand to pursue legitimate interests and respect for \r\nhuman rights and the rule of law. To that end, the \r\nAfrican Peer Review Mechanism is providing \r\ninnovative safeguards to improve governance and \r\npromote accountability. \r\n Malaria places a heavy burden on Africa. Indeed, \r\nnine out of 10 cases of malaria worldwide occur in \r\nsub-Saharan Africa, and 90 per cent of Africa’s \r\npopulation is at risk. Children under five years of age \r\nand pregnant women are the most vulnerable to \r\nmalaria. With approximately 250 million cases \r\nannually, malaria is the cause of death of almost a \r\nmillion Africans every year, most of them children. \r\nMalaria is said to be a disease of poverty and a cause \r\nof poverty. Its impact on socio-economic development \r\nis immense — approximately $12 billion annually — \r\nand consequently, the disease has slowed economic \r\ngrowth by up to 1.3 per cent per year through death \r\nand lost hours of economic productivity, as well as \r\nhaving an impact on public funds and family incomes. \r\n African leaders are highly committed to the fight \r\nagainst malaria. In the Abuja Declaration, they \r\ncommitted themselves, inter alia, to “halve the malaria \r\nmortality for Africa’s people by 2010”, and resolved to \r\n“initiate appropriate and sustainable action to \r\nstrengthen the health systems to ensure that by the year \r\n2005 ... at least 60 per cent of those at risk of malaria, \r\nparticularly children under five years of age and \r\npregnant women”, benefit from protective measures.  \r\n At the 2000 ordinary session of the Assembly of \r\nthe African Union, meeting at Lome, African leaders \r\ndeclared 25 April as African Malaria Day, a date which \r\nhas now become World Malaria Day.  \r\n While much progress has been achieved in the \r\nfight against malaria, many challenges still remain. \r\nThese include the development of resistance to drugs \r\nwhich has forced countries to change their drug \r\npolicies to combination therapies, which are more \r\nexpensive. It is a matter of concern that resistance to \r\ncombination therapies has begun to occur. Moreover, \r\nA/64/PV.22  \r\n \r\n09-56757 8 \r\n \r\nthe emergence of counterfeit and substandard drugs \r\nwill further compound this problem. Other challenges \r\ninclude weak procurement and distribution systems, \r\ninadequate access to medical equipment, especially for \r\nrapid diagnostic testing, and inadequate availability of \r\nskilled medical personnel. \r\n The current financial, energy and food crises \r\nfurther constrain Member States’ ability to allocate \r\nsufficient funds for malaria control. Climate change is \r\nanother challenge that has to be taken into account in \r\nthe fight against malaria, as it may lead to other \r\ngeographical areas that were not originally malaria \r\nendemic to become so. \r\n We are encouraged by the increase in funding for \r\nmalaria control from bilateral and international \r\norganizations, including the Global Fund to Fight \r\nAIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the World Bank’s \r\nbooster programme, the United States President’s \r\nMalaria Initiative and the Islamic Development Bank. \r\nWe also commend the Bill \u0026 Melinda Gates \r\nFoundation for funding research as well as other \r\ninnovative financing mechanisms such as the \r\nInternational Drug Purchase Facility for improving \r\navailability of malaria medicines. \r\n Malaria-related ill-health and death throughout \r\nthe world can be substantially eliminated with political \r\ncommitment and commensurate resources if the public \r\nis educated and sensitized to malaria and if appropriate \r\nhealth services are made available, particularly in \r\ncountries where the disease is endemic. It is important \r\nto remind ourselves that we just have a year to 2010, \r\nthe Roll Back Malaria target for halving the malaria \r\nburden and the target for universal access to health \r\nservices and for malaria elimination in Africa. We thus \r\nneed to redouble our efforts if we are to achieve the \r\n2010 goals. It is also imperative that we begin looking \r\nbeyond 2010 in our fight against malaria. \r\n Africans are committed to working hard in order \r\nto turn Africa into a zone of active partnership and to \r\nestablish conditions on the continent conducive to \r\npeace and sustainable development. The priority task \r\nnow is for all stakeholders to effectively honour the \r\ncommitments they have undertaken with regard to \r\nAfrica. \r\n Mr. Sinhaseni (Thailand): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the 10 member States of the \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), \r\nnamely Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, the \r\nLao People’s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, \r\nMyanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Viet Nam and \r\nThailand. \r\n ASEAN aligns itself with the statement delivered \r\nby the representative of the Sudan on behalf of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China. ASEAN would like to thank \r\nthe Secretary-General for his comprehensive report \r\nregarding the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) (A/64/204). \r\n ASEAN stands firm in solidarity with Africa and \r\nis committed to supporting Africa’s aspiration for \r\ngrowth, development and prosperity, as reflected in \r\nNEPAD. We fully support the main objective of \r\nNEPAD: to generate broad-based and equitable \r\neconomic growth that would allow Africa to reduce \r\npoverty and be better integrated into the global \r\neconomy. In this spirit, I have the honour to share \r\nASEAN’s views on some key issues. \r\n First, ASEAN welcomes progress achieved in \r\nrecent years by African countries and organizations in \r\nimplementing various sectoral priorities of NEPAD, for \r\nexample in areas of infrastructure, agriculture, public \r\nhealth, education and human resources development, \r\ninformation and communications technology and \r\nscience and technology, as reported by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. \r\n ASEAN commends the leaders and peoples of \r\nAfrica for their unwavering determination to achieve \r\nthe noble goals they have set for themselves. We \r\nwelcome the assessment of the Secretary-General in \r\nhis report (A/64/204) that progress in these priority \r\nareas has put African countries in a stronger position to \r\nachieve many of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) by the year 2015. We also agree that there \r\nshould be no room for complacency. \r\n Secondly, like developing countries in other parts \r\nof the globe, African countries have faced multiple \r\nchallenges arising from the multiple crises that have \r\naffected the world in the past few years. The current \r\nfinancial and economic crisis; food and energy security \r\nconcerns; stalled multilateral trade negotiations; the \r\nspread of pandemics and deadly infectious diseases; \r\nand the adverse impacts of climate change, particularly \r\ndesertification, have threatened to reverse many \r\nAfrican countries’ hard-won progress towards the \r\nMDGs as well as towards sustainable growth and \r\ndevelopment as envisaged by NEPAD. Addressing \r\nthose challenges is a matter of great urgency. \r\n A/64/PV.22\r\n \r\n9 09-56757 \r\n \r\n ASEAN believes it important to keep reminding \r\nall parties concerned of the human face of the current \r\nfinancial and economic crisis, especially in its impact \r\non vulnerable populations in developing countries. \r\nASEAN has made this point clear at every meeting \r\nrelating to this issue, for example, at the United \r\nNations and Group of 20 Summits in London and, \r\nmore recently, in Pittsburgh. ASEAN will continue to \r\nemphasize this human dimension of the financial and \r\neconomic crisis, not only because we feel strongly \r\nabout the issue, but because we ourselves lived through \r\na similar crisis in the late 1990s. \r\n Thirdly, in the face of such complex and \r\nintertwined crises and challenges, ASEAN firmly \r\nbelieves that the international community should \r\nrespond with stronger and more coordinated \r\ninternational cooperation and partnership. The current \r\nfinancial crisis in developed countries should not lead \r\ndonors to cut back on their pledged commitments to \r\ndeveloping countries, including those in Africa. \r\nCommitments made in L’Aquila, London and \r\nPittsburgh must be honoured. \r\n In the view of ASEAN, developing countries \r\nshould be assisted with capacity-building and projects \r\naimed at, inter alia, strengthening social safety nets to \r\ncushion vulnerable societies and populations from the \r\nimpacts of the current global economic downturn and \r\nstrengthen their resilience to weather future shocks. \r\nASEAN calls upon all parties to implement fully the \r\nPolitical Declaration on Africa’s Development Needs \r\n(resolution 63/1), adopted at the close of the high-level \r\nmeeting held in September 2008. With the high-level \r\nconference to review progress on the MDGs scheduled \r\nfor September 2010 (resolution 63/302), we urge all \r\nMember States to take full advantage of that meeting to \r\nreflect on achievements and shortcomings thus far, \r\nwith a view to reenergizing national, regional and \r\ninternational efforts vis-à-vis the MDGs within the five \r\nyears remaining until 2015. Next year will be vital for \r\nus to add further momentum before it is too late. \r\n Fourthly, ASEAN believes that South-South \r\ncooperation and tripartite partnership can positively \r\ncomplement traditional North-South cooperation in \r\nsupporting development in Africa. ASEAN is of the \r\nview that, in many cases, developing countries are in a \r\nbetter position to understand one another and to share \r\ntheir experiences regarding successes and challenges in \r\ntheir development efforts. We strongly believe that \r\ndevelopment assistance and partnerships should aim to \r\nempower African countries and their peoples by \r\nunlocking their potential on the basis of their \r\ncomparative strengths, national priorities and national \r\nownership. In this context, we recognize the \r\nimportance of South-South cooperation among \r\ncountries of ASEAN and Africa, as well as tripartite \r\npartnerships between ASEAN, African countries and \r\ndonors, as an effective way to promote trade, \r\nagriculture, food security and health care in Africa. \r\n Fifthly, the nations of ASEAN are committed to \r\nstrengthening relations and partnerships with Africa. \r\nAs fellow developing countries, we stand ready to \r\nshare our experience in economic and social \r\ndevelopment with our African partners. As I speak, \r\nindividual ASEAN member States are working with \r\ntheir African partners in such diverse areas as human \r\nresources development, capacity-building, public \r\nhealth — including combating infectious diseases such \r\nas malaria — fisheries and agricultural development. \r\n ASEAN also welcomes the progress made in the \r\nNew Asian-African Strategic Partnership with a senior \r\nofficials’ meeting, held in Jakarta on 12 and \r\n13 October, with the aim of maintaining the Strategic \r\nPartnership’s momentum and reaffirming ASEAN’s \r\nstrong commitment to strengthening cooperation \r\nthrough the implementation of concrete activities and \r\nprogrammes under the Strategic Partnership framework. \r\n As we ourselves deepen our integration to \r\nbecome an ASEAN community, we also fully support \r\nefforts to deepen regional integration in Africa. We \r\nnote with interest that the latest report of the United \r\nNations Conference on Trade and Development on \r\neconomic development in Africa in 2009, released in \r\nJuly (UNCTAD/ALDC/AFRICA/2009), recommends \r\nthat Africa deepen regional economic integration \r\ninitiatives as a means of building stronger and more \r\nresilient economies. While we believe in the \r\nimportance of reaching a development-oriented \r\noutcome of the Doha Round to ensure a free and fair \r\nglobal trade regime beneficial to developing countries, \r\nwe also believe that, like other regions, Africa would \r\nbenefit enormously from closer intraregional trade as \r\nwell as better integration and harmonization in the \r\nareas of infrastructure and trade policy. We agree with \r\nthe UNCTAD report’s recommendation that regional \r\nintegration could enhance African countries’ \r\nproductive capacity, increase their economic \r\ndiversification and improve their competitiveness. \r\nA/64/PV.22  \r\n \r\n09-56757 10 \r\n \r\n As shown by the results of integration among the \r\n10 ASEAN member States, and between ASEAN as a \r\ngroup and its partners in East Asia, pooled resources \r\nand economies of scale would allow African countries \r\nto enhance their respective comparative advantages \r\nwhile participating more fully and effectively in the \r\nglobal economy. ASEAN fully supports ongoing efforts \r\nto promote integration between Africa’s three \r\nsubregional groups — the Common Market for Eastern \r\nand Southern Africa (COMESA), the Southern African \r\nDevelopment Community (SADC) and the East African \r\nCommunity (EAC) — under the COMESA-SADC-\r\nEAC Harmonization Process. Here ASEAN stands \r\nready to work with and share its experience on regional \r\nintegration with its African partners. \r\n Finally, ASEAN believes that the association \r\nbetween the nations of ASEAN and Africa should be \r\nstrengthened so as to encompass more than just the \r\nrelations between the Governments of both regions. \r\nThe peoples of ASEAN and Africa should be \r\nencouraged to learn and understand more about one \r\nanother. At the moment, there are many men and \r\nwomen from ASEAN who are working with their \r\nAfrican partners in various development and business \r\nprojects in Africa. Likewise, there are also many \r\nAfrican professionals and students who are working \r\nwith their ASEAN partners or studying in various \r\nfields in ASEAN member States. Further educational, \r\nbusiness and cultural exchange programmes between \r\nthe two regions should be further promoted in order to \r\nbring their peoples closer together. ASEAN strongly \r\nbelieves that closer people-to-people contacts would \r\nform a strong and lasting foundation for partnership \r\nand friendship between ASEAN and Africa. \r\n Mr. Tharoor (India): I am happy to participate in \r\ntoday’s joint debate on the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD). Allow me to thank \r\nthe Secretary-General for his comprehensive report on \r\nimplementation and international support with regard \r\nto NEPAD (A/64/204) and for the other reports \r\nprepared for this joint debate. \r\n India’s ties with Africa are historic. Trade across \r\nthe Indian Ocean has linked us for hundreds of years. \r\nFor the people of India, Africa is also the land of \r\nawakening of the father of our nation, Mahatma \r\nGandhi. In the past, we have shared the pain of \r\nsubjugation and the joy of freedom and liberation. We \r\nhave worked shoulder to shoulder in the fight against \r\napartheid and racial discrimination. India was at the \r\nvanguard of the struggle against colonialism, apartheid \r\nand racial discrimination — a struggle that helped \r\ntransform the lives of millions of people in Africa and \r\nAsia. During our march together, we have traversed \r\nsimilar paths, shared similar values and cherished the \r\nsame dreams. Our long and historic relationship has \r\nnow evolved into a sustainable and enduring \r\npartnership. \r\n In his report, “New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment: seventh consolidated progress report on \r\nimplementation and international support”, the \r\nSecretary-General underscored that international \r\ncooperation is vital for Africa’s development. The \r\nreport emphasizes the need for concerted and urgent \r\naction by international development partners to \r\nmitigate the socio-economic impact of the global \r\nfinancial and economic crisis and help African \r\ncountries in their progress towards the implementation \r\nof NEPAD and the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. The report also highlights India’s \r\ncontribution towards Africa’s development in the \r\ncontext of South-South cooperation. \r\n India has a long-standing, close and multilayered \r\nrelationship with Africa. A vibrant India and a \r\nresurgent Africa are witnessing an intensification of \r\nrelations and a growing convergence of interests in \r\ntheir common quest for sustainable economic growth \r\nand development. Our partnership encompasses \r\npriority sectors integral to the developmental goals of \r\nAfrica in the twenty-first century. India is committed to \r\nworking together with Africa in accordance with the \r\npriorities of the continent. Priority areas of cooperation \r\ninclude infrastructure development, capacity-building, \r\nagriculture, health and food security and technology \r\ncooperation. We have accorded high priority to the \r\ndevelopment of economic infrastructure, including \r\nrailways, information technology, telecommunications \r\nand power. \r\n The First India-Africa Forum Summit, held in \r\nDelhi in April 2008, was a major milestone in India’s \r\nengagement with Africa. The Delhi Declaration and the \r\nAfrica-India Framework for Cooperation, adopted \r\nduring the Summit, highlighted our shared vision and \r\nworld view. Taken together, these provide a sound \r\nfoundation for the intensification of our engagement in \r\nthe years to come. \r\n India has so far extended more than $3 billion in \r\nconcessional lines of credit to countries in Africa. \r\n A/64/PV.22\r\n \r\n11 09-56757 \r\n \r\nDuring the India-Africa Forum Summit, India also \r\ndecided to increase the available concessional lines of \r\ncredit for Africa to $5.4 billion for the next five years. \r\n Since the inception of the Indian Technical and \r\nEconomic Cooperation (ITEC) programme in 1964, \r\ncapacity-building and human resource development in \r\nAfrica have been areas of high priority for the \r\nGovernment of India. The ITEC programme has \r\nbenefited thousands of experts and students from \r\nAfrica who have come for training courses in \r\nprofessional institutions in my country. Those courses \r\ncover diverse fields such as agriculture and \r\nagro-processing, entrepreneurship development, tool \r\ndesign, small-business creation, the promotion of rural \r\nindustries and information technology. We have \r\nincreased the number of training slots for African \r\ncountries from 1,100 to 1,600 under the programme. In \r\naddition, several thousand African students are \r\ncurrently studying in Indian universities and colleges. \r\nWe have also doubled the number of scholarships for \r\nAfrican countries to 500. \r\n Over the next five to six years, India will also be \r\nundertaking in Africa, on a grant basis, projects in \r\ncritical areas such as higher and vocational education, \r\nscience, information technology, agriculture and \r\nrenewable energy. A sum of $500 million has been \r\nallocated for that endeavour. \r\n The Pan-African e-Network project, which seeks \r\nto bridge the digital divide between Africa and the rest \r\nof the world, is one of the most far-reaching initiatives \r\nundertaken by India. Already, 42 countries have joined \r\nthis programme, which is intended to provide \r\ne-services, with priority on telecommunication, \r\ntele-education and telemedicine services and \r\nconnectivity for extremely important persons — VVIP \r\nconnectivity — through a satellite and fibre-optic \r\nnetwork among the heads of State of all 53 countries. \r\nThe project would give major benefits to Africa in the \r\narea of capacity-building through the skill and \r\nknowledge development of students and medical \r\nspecialists, as well as for medical consultation. \r\n India has been actively engaged with NEPAD \r\nsince the very beginning. The Government of India \r\nannounced a $300 million line of credit for NEPAD \r\nduring the India-Africa Forum Summit. That line of \r\ncredit is in addition to the $200 million in lines of \r\ncredit for NEPAD extended in 2002. \r\n The Indian private sector is increasingly engaged \r\nin Africa. Indian companies have made large \r\ninvestments in Africa in the areas of industry, \r\nagriculture, services, human resource development and \r\ninfrastructure. India’s trade with Africa has been \r\ngrowing rapidly. India’s bilateral trade with Africa \r\ntotalled more than $36 billion in the period 2008-2009, \r\nwhich represented an almost sixfold increase in as \r\nmany years. We look forward to working with our \r\nAfrican partners to take those trade and investment \r\nlevels to new heights. \r\n In his report on NEPAD, the Secretary-General \r\ncalled for a long-overdue successful outcome to the \r\nDoha Round of multilateral trade negotiations. At the \r\nIndia-Africa Forum Summit, India and Africa decided \r\nto work together on pressing global issues of shared \r\ninterest and concern, including those involving the \r\nWorld Trade Organization, such as the issue of cotton \r\nsubsidies. India has unilaterally announced duty-free \r\nand quota-free market access to goods from 34 least \r\ndeveloped countries (LDCs) in Africa. This covers \r\n94 per cent of India’s total tariff lines and provides \r\npreferential market access on tariff lines comprising \r\n92.5 per cent of the global exports of all LDCs. \r\n As indicated in the Secretary-General’s report, an \r\nimportant factor in addressing the causes of conflict \r\nand contributing to durable peace and sustainable \r\ndevelopment in Africa is the commitment of the \r\ninternational community, including United Nations \r\norganizations, to allocate increased financial, human \r\nand technical resources for regional strategies. \r\n For its part, India has been extensively involved \r\nin peacekeeping efforts in Africa over the past six \r\ndecades. At present, India has more than 7,000 \r\npeacekeepers serving in Africa, including a 5,000-\r\nstrong contingent in the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo. India’s first full all-female formed police unit \r\nis currently deployed in Liberia. In addition to \r\npeacekeeping, this unit has been successful in reaching \r\nout to the most vulnerable sections of society — \r\nwomen and children — and in inspiring women, who \r\nhave so often been the victims of war, to see \r\nthemselves also as sources of succor and strength in \r\nthis recently war-torn society. \r\n As a founding member of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, India remains actively engaged with the \r\nwork of the Commission. The report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral (A/64/210) mentions that 92 per cent of \r\nA/64/PV.22  \r\n \r\n09-56757 12 \r\n \r\nPeacebuilding Fund-allocated funds have gone to \r\nAfrican countries. We are hopeful that, with the \r\nrevision of the terms of reference for the Peacebuilding \r\nFund, the efficiency and effectiveness of the Fund will \r\nbe further improved. \r\n Africa’s fight against malaria is dealt with in the \r\nWorld Health Organization report on “2001-2010: \r\nDecade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing Countries, \r\nParticularly in Africa”, transmitted in a note by the \r\nSecretary-General (A/64/302). It is a matter of deep \r\nregret that more than 1 million malarial deaths still \r\noccur each year when the disease is preventable, \r\ntreatable and perfectly curable. \r\n While we are happy to note that a number of \r\npreventive measures, such as the distribution of treated \r\nmosquito nets, are being undertaken on a much larger \r\nscale, it also remains a fact that the developing world’s \r\nability to combat public health crises of this nature has \r\nat times been circumscribed under the pretext of \r\nintellectual property rights. Access to affordable \r\nmedicines is a fundamental part of the right to health, \r\nand this has even been recognized by the trade-related \r\naspects of intellectual property rights regime. \r\nUnfortunately, this remains more in the realm of theory \r\nthan that of practice. \r\n The Africa-India Framework for Cooperation \r\n2008 includes capacity-building programmes for \r\nmedical and health specialists to tackle pandemics like \r\nmalaria, filariasis, polio, HIV and tuberculosis. \r\n In conclusion, I should like to state that India \r\nenvisions an Africa that is self-reliant, economically \r\nvibrant and at peace with itself and the world. While \r\nhighlighting the vitality of the African continent, the \r\nfirst Prime Minister of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, \r\nsaid:  \r\n “Of one thing there can be no doubt, and \r\nthat is the vitality of the people of Africa. \r\nTherefore, with the vitality of her people and the \r\ngreat resources available in this great continent, \r\nthere can be no doubt that the future holds a great \r\npromise for the people of Africa”. \r\n It is this promise that our partnership with Africa \r\nseeks to fulfil. India will offer its fullest cooperation to \r\nharness the great potential of the African people for the \r\ncause of Africa’s progress and development. \r\n Mr. Talbot (Guyana): I have the honour to speak \r\non agenda item 63 on behalf of the States members of \r\nthe Caribbean Community (CARICOM) that are \r\nMembers of the United Nations, namely: Antigua and \r\nBarbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, \r\nGrenada, Haiti, Jamaica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint \r\nLucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, \r\nTrinidad and Tobago and my own country, Guyana. \r\n The States members of the Caribbean Community \r\nare pleased to renew our solidarity with Africa and its \r\npeople, with whom we share strong bonds of history \r\nand culture and a sense of common purpose. As we \r\nstrive to promote development in our respective \r\nregions, we envisage increased prospects for mutual \r\ncooperation and exchange. Africa can continue to count \r\non CARICOM’s full support for the achievement of the \r\nobjectives of the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) and the promotion of durable \r\npeace and sustainable development on the continent. \r\n The high-level meeting on Africa’s development \r\nneeds, held one year ago, took account of the state of \r\nimplementation of various commitments as well as the \r\nchallenges encountered. In adopting a political \r\ndeclaration on Africa’s development needs, the \r\ninternational community recommitted itself  \r\n“to reinvigorate and strengthen a global \r\npartnership of equals based on our common \r\nvalues, mutual accountability, shared \r\nresponsibility and the determination to \r\ncollectively act for our common future and to \r\nmobilize the resources, including human, \r\nfinancial and technological, required to end \r\npoverty, hunger and underdevelopment in Africa, \r\nwith the explicit objective of turning existing \r\ncommitments into concrete actions” (resolution \r\n63/1, para. 3). \r\nOne year later, we can rightfully revisit those \r\ncommitments to take account of progress to date. \r\n CARICOM is therefore grateful to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the reports before us on this agenda item \r\n(A/64/204, A/64/208 and A/64/210). Taken together, \r\nthey provide a mixed picture of progress accompanied \r\nby setbacks. The reports point to the achievement of \r\nsome progress in the implementation of NEPAD \r\ndespite the negative impact of the various crises — \r\nfinancial and economic, food, climate change and \r\nenergy — that beset the world and Africa. But coming \r\nas they do at a time when African countries are poised \r\nfor significant economic growth, these crises \r\ncontributed to some setbacks in key areas in 2008, such \r\n A/64/PV.22\r\n \r\n13 09-56757 \r\n \r\nas economic growth, agricultural development and \r\npoverty eradication, as well as in several other human \r\ndevelopment indicators. \r\n CARICOM has observed with interest the actions \r\ntaken by Africa and its partners to advance the \r\nimplementation of varied national and subregional \r\ndevelopment plans and strategies in the framework of \r\nthe New Partnership. However, we also note that the \r\ngap between promise and delivery remains wide and \r\nthat the countries of Africa will continue to need the \r\ninvaluable support of the international community if \r\nthey are to realize the objectives of NEPAD. \r\n Africa’s fundamental challenges are well known \r\nand have been well articulated by the international \r\ncommunity. The ongoing multiple global crises, the \r\nvariable socio-economic performance across the \r\ncontinent and the emergence of new challenges pose an \r\neven more formidable obstacle to the sustainable \r\ndevelopment prospects for Africa. The inadequacy of \r\nresources remains a major constraint on African \r\ndevelopment. Despite the serious, sincere and \r\nconsistent efforts of African countries to implement \r\nNEPAD, Africa is still far from enjoying the levels of \r\nsupport required under its partnership with the \r\ninternational community.  \r\n CARICOM is of the view that considerable gains \r\nwould be possible if the international community were \r\nto translate its commitments into concrete results. \r\nOfficial development assistance, foreign direct \r\ninvestment and trade are key engines of growth in \r\nAfrica. For that reason, there is a need for great \r\nvigilance to ensure that the upward trend of foreign \r\ndirect investment flows to Africa is maintained and that \r\ndevelopment partners meet their pledge to raise aid \r\nflows to Africa to $66 billion annually, at 2008 prices, \r\nby 2010. \r\n Africa’s debt sustainability challenges must also \r\nbe tackled coherently. Various multilateral and bilateral \r\ndebt reduction initiatives have lowered debt-servicing \r\ncosts for many African countries. However, the current \r\ncrisis presents new debt sustainability challenges. In \r\naddition, the manifest lack of progress in the Doha \r\nRound of multilateral trade talks also constrains the \r\nvistas of Africa’s development progress. CARICOM is \r\nconvinced that the international community should \r\nensure that multilateral agreements address Africa’s \r\nneeds and incorporate appropriate development \r\nprovisions. \r\n The development of agriculture is critical to \r\nAfrica’s development prospects. More collaborative \r\naction is therefore necessary to assist the continent in \r\ncoping with the food crisis and to embark on a truly \r\nAfrican green revolution. As elaborated during this \r\nyear’s session of the Commission on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, where a focus on Africa was included in \r\none of the thematic clusters, helpful action in that \r\nregard should include encouraging and facilitating \r\ninvestments, especially in rural infrastructure \r\nspecifically to address the socio-economic \r\ndevelopment of rural communities and vulnerable \r\ngroups; increasing research and development efforts; \r\npromoting land reform and security of tenure; and \r\nsupporting economic diversification and the \r\nimprovement of income distribution. \r\n CARICOM is ever mindful of the complex \r\ninterrelationship between governance and \r\ndevelopment. We support the continued efforts of \r\nAfrican countries to improve economic and political \r\ngovernance and to strengthen mechanisms for the \r\nparticipation, inclusion and empowerment of all \r\nsegments of African society, including civil society, \r\nwomen and girls, and communities and households, in \r\nthe political and development processes on the \r\ncontinent. CARICOM also believes that focused efforts \r\nmust continue to be made to eliminate the combination \r\nof internal and external factors that engender conflict \r\nand stymie development. \r\n CARICOM continues to endorse the requirement \r\nidentified in the political declaration on Africa’s \r\ndevelopment needs (resolution 63/1) that all \r\ncommitments to and by Africa to comprehensively \r\naddress the special development needs of the continent \r\nbe effectively implemented and given appropriate \r\nfollow-up by the international community and by \r\nAfrica itself. CARICOM emphasizes the importance of \r\nenhanced and improved monitoring of the NEPAD \r\nimplementation process. As the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport points out, “[t]oo often in the past, Governments \r\nhave convened high-level summits on development, \r\nadopted bold targets, and then failed to deliver” \r\n(A/64/208, para. 47).  \r\n We have taken particular note of the fact that, \r\nrather than devising new mechanisms, the results of the \r\nvarious existing monitoring processes will be brought \r\ntogether more effectively. In that regard, we welcome \r\nthe enhanced support provided by the United Nations \r\nsystem to the African Union and the NEPAD \r\nA/64/PV.22  \r\n \r\n09-56757 14 \r\n \r\nprogramme, especially through the auspices of the \r\ninter-agency task force on Africa and the efforts to \r\nmainstream NEPAD into United Nations normative and \r\noperational activities. \r\n The States members of CARICOM are \r\nencouraged by the recognition that Africa is capable of \r\nand has made dedicated efforts towards resolving the \r\nmany challenges that it faces. The progress in the \r\nimplementation of NEPAD projects and in moving \r\nforward the African Peer Review Mechanism is fitting \r\ntestimony to that recognition. African countries \r\nthemselves and their development partners must now \r\ncontinue, including through stronger linkages with the \r\nprivate sector and civil society, their prudent action to \r\nensure that the progress achieved so far is not unduly \r\nundermined. CARICOM therefore avails itself of this \r\nopportunity to again call on the international \r\ncommunity to significantly enhance its support for \r\nAfrica’s development through NEPAD. In that regard, \r\nwe see an important role for South-South cooperation \r\nas part of the international response.  \r\n The CARICOM countries work with our brothers \r\nand sisters in Africa in various forums, here at the \r\nUnited Nations and in the context of the \r\nCommonwealth and of the African, Caribbean and \r\nPacific group, among others. We are honoured to \r\npartner with Africa and with other countries and \r\nregions in the project to establish a permanent \r\nmemorial to the victims of slavery and the transatlantic \r\nslave trade. We will continue to work with Africa to \r\nfurther strengthen the institutional mechanisms for \r\ncollaboration between our two regions and among our \r\npeoples and for the consolidation of our long-standing \r\nrelationships and the productive linkages between \r\nAfrica and the Caribbean in economic, social, cultural \r\nand other domains. \r\n Mr. Loh (Singapore): I would like to begin by \r\naligning myself with the statements made by the \r\nrepresentatives of the Sudan, on behalf of the Group of \r\n77 and China, and of Thailand, on behalf of the \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), on \r\nthis agenda item. \r\n The New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD) has grown from strength to strength since its \r\nadoption in 2001. The Secretary-General’s seventh \r\nconsolidated progress report on the implementation and \r\ninternational support of NEPAD (A/64/204) indicates \r\nthat, despite the global financial and economic crisis \r\nand its negative impact, Africa has achieved progress \r\nin the past year in areas such as infrastructure, \r\nagriculture, education, health, the environment and \r\nscience and technology. We applaud the good work that \r\nis being done through NEPAD. \r\n At the recent briefing by the United Nations \r\nOffice of the Special Adviser on Africa on the African \r\nPeer Review Mechanism (APRM) established under \r\nNEPAD, we were heartened to note that 30 countries \r\nhad voluntarily acceded to the Review Mechanism. \r\nSeventeen of those 30 member countries have also \r\nlaunched the process for themselves. The APRM not \r\nonly makes it possible for African countries to \r\nbenchmark good governance in Africa to international \r\nnorms and standards, but also showcases the \r\ninnovation in African thinking on governance. From \r\nthe case studies highlighted, it is clear that much \r\nprogress has been made in the areas of governance and \r\nsocio-economic development in Africa. \r\n However, such hard-earned progress could be \r\nrolled back as African countries are increasingly \r\naffected by the financial crisis, the latent food and \r\nenergy crisis and the effects of climate change. Many \r\nAfrican countries are already behind schedule towards \r\nmeeting the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. \r\nIn such circumstances, while NEPAD’s principle of \r\nanchoring the development of Africa on its resources \r\nand the resourcefulness of its people should not \r\nchange, there is a real danger that Africa will continue \r\nto lag behind without concerted and sustained \r\ninternational cooperation and assistance. \r\n Official development assistance, foreign direct \r\ninvestment and trade are key engines of growth in \r\nAfrica. Africa’s development partners therefore need to \r\ntake serious steps to maintain the upward trend of \r\nforeign direct investment inflows to the continent. In \r\nthis regard, the Singapore Minister of Trade and \r\nIndustry, along with the business delegations of \r\n31 Singaporean companies, visited Nigeria, South \r\nAfrica and Ghana just two weeks ago. Foreign direct \r\ninvestment from Singapore in Africa has also grown at \r\nan average of 146 per cent a year over the past 22 years \r\nto reach $36 billion in 2007.  \r\n Besides investing in Africa, Singapore has also \r\nprovided technical assistance and cooperation to our \r\nAfrican friends under the Singapore Cooperation \r\nProgramme (SCP), which was established under the \r\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs of Singapore to coordinate \r\n A/64/PV.22\r\n \r\n15 09-56757 \r\n \r\nand strengthen our technical assistance under a \r\ncentralized framework. When it became independent in \r\n1965, Singapore was fortunate to have friends from \r\nmany countries who shared their development \r\nexperience with us. Without their assistance, our \r\nprogress would have been much more difficult. Having \r\nbenefited from the assistance rendered to us, and in the \r\nsame spirit of assisting friends, Singapore is glad to \r\nshare our experience and competencies with fellow \r\ndeveloping countries through the SCP. \r\n For example, in 2008 participants from seven \r\ncountries across Africa learned about environmental \r\nmanagement, urban development and town planning \r\nthrough a course jointly sponsored by the Singapore \r\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs and the United Nations \r\nCentre for Regional Development. Seventy senior \r\nofficials and education specialists from Ghana, \r\nMadagascar and Mozambique also attended a two-\r\nweek workshop entitled “Leaders in Education and \r\nTraining for Sustained Growth in Africa”, which was \r\njointly organized by the World Bank, the Ministry of \r\nForeign Affairs of Singapore and International \r\nEnterprise Singapore. \r\n More recently, Singapore welcomed a high-level \r\ngroup of 35 senior policymakers from Ghana, Kenya, \r\nMozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda and Tanzania to \r\nSingapore for the Third South-South Study Visit on \r\nskills and knowledge for sustained development in \r\nAfrica, under the auspices of the Singapore-World \r\nBank Third Country Training Programme. The South-\r\nSouth Study Visit was organized with the objective of \r\nsharing Singapore’s experience in skills and knowledge \r\ndevelopment. The programme focused on how formal \r\neducation and training systems are linked to the skills \r\nassociated with a country’s development strategy and \r\nthe growth of industry and private enterprise. \r\n Let me conclude by saying that NEPAD should \r\ncontinue to be driven by African ownership and \r\nleadership. Nonetheless, the international community \r\nshould do more to support Africa’s efforts to achieve \r\nsustainable development. In this regard, Singapore is \r\ncommitted to doing our part as a responsible global \r\ncitizen to assist fellow developing countries in human \r\nresource capacity-building. We are happy to share the \r\nlessons and expertise gained from our own \r\ndevelopment journey, and we know that we have much \r\nto learn from our African counterparts as we progress \r\nforward together. \r\n Mr. Liu Zhenmin (China) (spoke in Chinese): At \r\nthe outset, I welcome the reports submitted by the \r\nSecretary-General on the agenda items under \r\ndiscussion (A/64/204, A/64/208 and A/64/210). The \r\nChinese delegation supports the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of the Sudan on behalf of the Group of \r\n77 and China. \r\n Africa is home to most developing countries, and \r\nAfrican countries account for a quarter of the States \r\nMembers of the United Nations. Without peace and \r\ndevelopment in Africa, there will be no world peace \r\nand development.  \r\n The international community should offer more \r\nunderstanding and care in addressing the special \r\nchallenges faced by African countries in the process of \r\ndevelopment. It is the consistent view of the Chinese \r\ndelegation that, given the difficulties confronted by \r\nAfrican countries, the international community should \r\ntake Africa’s concerns seriously, respect its positions, \r\nheed its calls and support its requests.  \r\n In September 2008, the United Nations convened \r\nthe high-level meeting on Africa’s development needs, \r\nwhich adopted a political declaration (resolution 63/1) \r\ndemonstrating the common will of all countries to \r\nstrengthen cooperation in helping African countries to \r\nspeed up their development. \r\n This year marks the eighth anniversary of the \r\nlaunch of the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD). Over the past eight years, with \r\nthe strong support of the international community, \r\nAfrican countries have made progress in areas such as \r\ninfrastructure, agriculture, health, education, environmental \r\nprotection, information and communication technology, \r\ngender mainstreaming and the African Peer Review \r\nMechanism.  \r\n Nevertheless, the impact of the financial, food \r\nand energy crises and of climate change has unleashed \r\nan unprecedented development crisis on the African \r\ncontinent, causing concern over the prospect of \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \r\nthere. The international community should take \r\nimmediate action to reduce the implications of the \r\ncrisis for the economic and social endeavours of \r\nAfrican countries and help them to make progress in \r\nimplementing NEPAD and achieving the MDGs. In this \r\nregard, we maintain that the international community \r\nshould place great emphasis on the following areas. \r\nA/64/PV.22  \r\n \r\n09-56757 16 \r\n \r\n First, with respect to the prompt delivery on its \r\ncommitments to assistance, the international \r\ncommunity should follow through on all its assistance \r\ncommitments to Africa. In particular, developed \r\ncountries should increase their official development \r\nassistance (ODA) to 0.7 per cent of their gross national \r\nproduct. For many African countries, ODA provides \r\nthe main source of funding for their economic and \r\nsocial development. This external assistance should be \r\ntargeted at and serve the fundamental and long-term \r\nneeds of people of Africa. \r\n Secondly, the international community should \r\nprovide additional financing. Due to the global \r\nfinancial crisis, most developing countries have \r\nwitnessed a sharp decrease in fiscal revenue and \r\nexperienced difficulties in securing external financing. \r\nThey are finding it impossible to adopt countercyclical \r\npolicies to stimulate economic growth. International \r\nfinancial institutions should forge a mechanism to \r\nprovide rapid and effective financial assistance and \r\nfinancing support to African countries without \r\nconditionalities, so as to help them overcome their \r\neconomic difficulties. \r\n Thirdly, the international community should \r\nrespect African ownership. The countries of Africa \r\nhave worked assiduously to achieve strength through \r\nunity, seek regional peace and stability, and revitalize \r\ntheir economies. While rendering assistance to African \r\ncountries, the international community should also \r\nhave confidence in the wisdom of the African \r\nGovernments and peoples, and respect the ownership \r\nand leadership of the recipient countries. \r\n Fourthly, the international community should \r\nexpand South-South cooperation. In seeking \r\ndevelopment, developing countries have always sought \r\nmutual understanding and support. As a useful \r\ncomplement to North-South cooperation, the South-\r\nSouth cooperation has emerged as an effective driving \r\nforce for Africa’s economic development. We should \r\nexplore various forms of South-South cooperation for \r\nthe benefit of African development. \r\n Fifthly, the international community should assist \r\nAfrican countries in capacity-building. African \r\ndevelopment requires enhanced resources for \r\nsustainable development to take hold. The international \r\ncommunity should increase its input in African \r\ncountries in the areas of infrastructure, agriculture, \r\neducation, health and environmental protection. In the \r\nmeantime, the international community should increase \r\naid for trade to African countries to enhance their \r\nability to engage in foreign trade and ultimately \r\npromote their economic and social development. \r\n Sixthly, the role of international organizations \r\nneeds to be strengthened. The United Nations system \r\nhas a unique role to play in supporting NEPAD. We \r\nneed to take advantage of the United Nations Regional \r\nCoordination Mechanism in Support of the African \r\nUnion and its NEPAD Programme to strengthen \r\ncoordination among United Nations agencies in \r\nproviding assistance to Africa at the regional level and \r\nin increasing efficiency. \r\n The partnership between the United Nations \r\nsystem and the African Union, the African \r\nDevelopment Bank and regional economic \r\ncommunities should also be strengthened to ensure \r\nconsistency between the focus of the United Nations \r\nagencies and the priorities of NEPAD. International \r\nfinancial and development institutions should also step \r\nup their support for Africa. \r\n The experience of countries around the world \r\nshows that peace and stability are the anchors of \r\ndevelopment, and African development, too, calls for a \r\npeaceful environment. Most armed conflicts in and \r\namong African countries are rooted in poverty and lack \r\nof development. Armed conflicts not only impede \r\nAfrican development, but also exacerbate poverty on \r\nthe continent. \r\n We also believe that, in order to resolve conflicts \r\nand achieve sustainable development in Africa, great \r\nemphasis should be placed on preventive diplomacy. \r\nThe Secretary-General points out in his report that “the \r\ncost of armed conflict in Africa is equivalent to or \r\nexceeds the amount of money the continent receives in \r\ninternational aid” (A/64/208, para. 34). If it is not \r\nsquandered by armed conflict, that money can no doubt \r\nbe used to serve Africa’s growing development needs. \r\nChina supports the United Nations and the African \r\nUnion in their efforts to resolve conflicts in Africa and \r\nto create a peaceful and stable environment for the \r\ndevelopment of African countries. \r\n The traditional friendship between the peoples of \r\nChina and Africa dates back to ancient times. China-\r\nAfrica cooperation is an important component of \r\nSouth-South cooperation. It is China’s consistent \r\nforeign policy to further develop and strengthen its \r\npartnership with Africa, characterized by long-term \r\n A/64/PV.22\r\n \r\n17 09-56757 \r\n \r\nstability, equality, mutual benefit and all-round \r\ncooperation, as well as to support Africa with concrete \r\naction in its efforts to establish peace and promote \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Since the onset of the financial crisis, China, \r\nwhile overcoming its own difficulties, has continued to \r\nprovide various forms of assistance to African \r\ncountries, including grants, interest-free loans and \r\nconcessional loans. China focuses its assistance on the \r\nstrengthening of China-Africa cooperation in \r\nagriculture, infrastructure, human resource training and \r\npublic health, which are all priority areas of NEPAD. \r\n At the 2006 Beijing Summit of the Forum on \r\nChina-Africa Cooperation, the Chinese Government \r\nannounced its decision to exempt 33 heavily indebted \r\npoor and least developed countries in Africa that have \r\ndiplomatic relations with China from repaying their \r\ninterest-free loan debts to China that matured at the \r\nend of 2005. By the end of the first quarter of 2009, \r\nChina had successfully exempted 150 matured debt \r\naccounts owed by 32 countries. \r\n The Chinese Government also attaches great \r\nimportance to the concerns of African countries over \r\nmarket access and trade imbalances, and has taken a \r\nhost of measures to promote trade with African \r\ncountries. In 2008, total trade between China and \r\nAfrica stood at $106.84 billion, an increase of 45.1 per \r\ncent over the previous year. Of this amount, China’s \r\nimports from Africa accounted for $56 billion, \r\nregistering an increase of 54 per cent over the previous \r\nyear. \r\n In the future, China will provide further \r\nassistance and support to African countries in such \r\nareas as agriculture, education, health, health care and \r\nclean energy. We will also continue to support African \r\ncountries in their conflict prevention, reconciliation \r\nand peacebuilding endeavours. \r\n Mr. Midekssa (Ethiopia): As I am taking the \r\nfloor for the first time, allow me, on behalf of my \r\ndelegation, to congratulate Mr. Treki on his election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly, and to assure him \r\nof my delegation’s full support in ensuring the success \r\nof this session. \r\n I would also like to thank the Secretary-General \r\nfor his compelling and in-depth reports (A/64/204, \r\nA/64/208 and A/64/210) on both agenda items under \r\ndiscussion. \r\n My delegation associates itself with the \r\nstatements made by the representatives of Tunisia, on \r\nbehalf of the African Group, and of the Sudan on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China. We attach great \r\nimportance to the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) and I should therefore like to \r\nmake the following points. \r\n In recent years, there has been an unprecedented \r\nnumber of new activities aimed at fast-tracking African \r\ndevelopment and improving the position of Africa in \r\nthe international community. It is perhaps no \r\nexaggeration to say that the main driving force behind \r\nthis thrust is the African Union, whose work since its \r\ninception in 2001 has developed into a process that is \r\ninternationally recognized as the primary framework \r\nfor African development.  \r\n The NEPAD framework has provided Africa a \r\nbasis for renewal and revitalization. It is a \r\ncomprehensive and integrated development framework \r\nthat addresses key social, economic and political \r\npriorities in a coherent and balanced manner. It is \r\ndesigned to address the challenges facing the African \r\ncontinent, focusing on issues such as poverty, \r\nunderdevelopment, backwardness and the continued \r\nmarginalization of the continent. \r\n The framework’s prime objective is to eradicate \r\npoverty; to place African countries, both individually \r\nand collectively, on a path of sustainable growth and \r\ndevelopment; to halt the marginalization of Africa in \r\nthe globalization process, and to enhance its full and \r\nbeneficial integration into the global economy. \r\n Partnership and cooperation between and among \r\nAfrican countries and through regional and continental \r\nintegration, as well as forging a new international \r\npartnership that changes the existing lopsided \r\nrelationship between Africa and its partners, including \r\npublic-private partnerships, are paramount principles \r\nof NEPAD. The same goes for ensuring that all \r\npartnerships are linked to the Millennium Development \r\nGoals and other agreed development targets. As a long-\r\nterm goal, the need to establish and strengthen \r\npartnership between Africa and a greater number of \r\ndevelopment partners has been acknowledged all \r\nalong. \r\n Since 2000, Africa has had an average growth \r\nrate of real output above 5 per cent and inflation has \r\ndeclined to single digits. There have also been \r\nsignificant improvements in governance and a \r\nA/64/PV.22  \r\n \r\n09-56757 18 \r\n \r\nreduction in armed conflicts, making the region more \r\nattractive to private capital flows. This strong \r\nperformance was, however, buffeted last year by high \r\nfood and oil prices and the economic crisis that ensued.  \r\n The current global financial and economic crisis \r\nrepresents a serious setback for Africa because it is \r\ntaking place at a time when the region is making \r\nprogress in economic performance and management \r\nand when it is slowly recovering from the negative \r\neffects of the fuel and food crises. The impacts on \r\nAfrican economies, initially expected to be less severe, \r\nare profound. Growth rates in African countries have \r\nslowed, as the crisis is hitting the key drivers of \r\ngrowth, especially trade flows, capital inflows, the \r\nnatural resource sector and agricultural exports. \r\nHousehold incomes are falling owing to job losses and \r\ndecreased remittances from family members working \r\nabroad. There is also a concern that budget pressures in \r\ndonor countries will reduce aid flows. The ability of \r\nGovernments to undertake social expenditures to \r\nprotect the most vulnerable groups will also be \r\nconstrained, which in turn will impede progress \r\ntowards achieving the MDGs. \r\n The crisis has exposed weaknesses in the \r\nfunctioning of the global economy and has led to calls \r\nfor the reform of the international financial \r\narchitecture. While the worst of the recession may be \r\nover, the global economy is likely to enter a protracted \r\nperiod of low growth and volatility until the structural \r\nproblems are addressed.  \r\n We wish to reiterate that NEPAD will continue to \r\nserve as a framework that provides a good basis for \r\nrevitalization of Africa’s development. The current \r\nsituation makes more apparent than before the need to \r\nreinvigorate the global partnership in order for Africa \r\nto continue in its development path. \r\n We also must not forget that this crisis was \r\nbrought about by failures of regulation and the inherent \r\nvolatility in the international financial system as \r\ncurrently configured. The future international financial \r\narchitecture must be transparent and inclusive, with a \r\ngreater voice and representation for emerging and \r\ndeveloping economies, including those of Africa. That \r\nwill improve coherence and coordination in \r\npolicymaking at the global level and will assist Africa’s \r\nendeavour to attain the objectives enshrined in the NEPAD \r\nframework. We also feel that a pro-development and \r\nspeedy conclusion to the Doha Round of global trade \r\ntalks will facilitate much-needed changes in the \r\ninternational financial system. \r\n We also attach great importance to the issue of \r\ninfectious diseases like malaria. Malaria claims \r\nmillions of lives in Africa. Of the 500 million people \r\nafflicted with malaria worldwide, 450 million are in \r\nsub-Saharan Africa. In addition, malaria costs the \r\ncontinent over $10 billion annually. Over the past few \r\nyears there has been a change in attitude that has put \r\nmalaria high on the agenda of Governments, \r\ninternational organizations and development \r\nprogrammes.  \r\n Further, there is a new form of cooperation \r\nbetween the low-income countries and the developed \r\ndonor community. The important debates under way in \r\ndifferent forums are further indication that malaria \r\ncontrol and prevention are receiving due attention \r\nthroughout the international community. Since the \r\nWorld Health Organization and its partners funded the \r\nRoll Back Malaria project and held the Abuja Summit \r\nin 2000, malaria has become one of the foremost areas \r\nof concern worldwide. \r\n The Ethiopian Government, cognizant of the \r\nimpact of the disease, implemented the Roll Back \r\nMalaria project as a social movement at the national \r\nlevel in 2000, one year after finalizing the country’s \r\nfive-year strategic plan. So far, the Ministry of Health \r\nand Roll Back Malaria partners in Ethiopia have \r\nundertaken a malaria prevention and control campaign \r\nas an integral part of the Plan for Accelerated and \r\nSustained Development to End Poverty, which \r\nultimately contributes to the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. In the past few years \r\nthere has been remarkable success in curbing the \r\nspread of malaria and its death toll. \r\n Although infection and mortality rates for malaria \r\nhave significantly declined, the cooperation among the \r\nEthiopian Government, its development partners and \r\nthe international community is still vital to meeting the \r\nultimate objectives of the Roll Back Malaria project. \r\nWe therefore urge donors to respond to the financial \r\nand human resources needs that this crisis presents in a \r\nmore coordinated, systematic and comprehensive way, \r\ncommensurate with the magnitude of the problem. \r\n Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to express our appreciation to the \r\nSecretary-General for his reports on the progress \r\nachieved in the implementation of the New Partnership \r\n A/64/PV.22\r\n \r\n19 09-56757 \r\n \r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD) (A/64/204), on \r\nAfrica’s development needs and the state of \r\nimplementation of various commitments, challenges \r\nand the way forward (A/64/208), on the \r\nimplementation of the recommendations contained in \r\nthe report of the Secretary-General on the causes of \r\nconflict and the promotion of durable peace and \r\nsustainable development in Africa (A/64/210), and on \r\nthe Decade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing \r\nCountries, Particularly in Africa (A/64/302).  \r\n In this context, I would like to align myself with \r\nthe statements delivered by the representative of \r\nTunisia on behalf of the African Group and by the \r\nrepresentative of the Sudan on behalf of the Group of \r\n77 and China. \r\n More than a year has passed since we gathered in \r\nthe General Assembly at the level of heads of State and \r\nGovernment on 22 September 2008, when our leaders \r\nadopted by consensus the political declaration on \r\nAfrica’s development needs (resolution 63/1). That \r\ndeclaration constitutes a road map that reflects the joint \r\nvision of the international community on how to \r\nimprove the development situation of Africa in a \r\nmanner complementary to the outcomes of major \r\nUnited Nations conferences and summits in the \r\neconomic and social fields.  \r\n Since then, the development challenges facing \r\ndeveloping countries have intensified, especially on \r\nour African continent. They include the increase in \r\nfood and energy prices and climate change. Those \r\nchallenges have in turn been exacerbated by the \r\nnegative impact of the world financial and economic \r\ncrisis, making African countries the most afflicted, \r\nparticularly in light of that impact on the efforts of the \r\ncontinent to eradicate poverty and to achieve \r\nsustainable development and sustained economic \r\ngrowth. \r\n Accordingly, Egypt stresses the importance of \r\ndevoting a specific segment of the outcome document \r\nto be adopted by the summit that the Secretary-General \r\nhas called on the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) to a precise and comprehensive review of the \r\ndevelopment situation in Africa and how to rectify it. \r\nThat is particularly necessary because our continent \r\nhas the largest number of the least developed countries, \r\nand most of its countries are far from achieving the \r\ninternationally agreed development goals, especially \r\nthe MDGs.  \r\n Undoubtedly, the United Nations system — \r\nespecially the Office of the Special Adviser on \r\nAfrica — will have a central role in those actions, in \r\nparallel with the African Union and the regional and \r\nsubregional organizations and institutions and with the \r\nfull support of developed countries and international \r\nfinancial institutions. All this should be carried out in a \r\nmanner that confronts the negative effects of those \r\ncrises and challenges and mobilizes the international \r\npolitical will to improve the conditions of the peoples \r\nof the continent on the ground, in order to meet their \r\nlegitimate aspirations. \r\n From that perspective, Egypt believes that our \r\nactions should be premised on two central interrelated \r\nand complementary tracks. The first is the immediate \r\nand full implementation of commitments to Africa \r\ncontained in the outcomes of United Nations \r\nconferences and summits and in decisions, in addition \r\nto the international commitments to Africa by the \r\nGroup of Eight (G-8), the Group of Twenty (G-20) and \r\nother relevant international financial institutions and \r\nforums. The second is the allocation of new and \r\nadditional resources for the continent to help \r\nstrengthen the development finance channels available \r\nto its countries in order to alleviate the added burden \r\nimposed on their internal budgets because of the crises \r\nfacing us all, which hinder the abilities of those \r\ncountries to achieve those goals. \r\n Furthermore, I would like to emphasize that the \r\nimprovement in development on the continent remains \r\nincomplete without affirming and seriously moving \r\nforward on reform of the existing deficiencies in the \r\ninternational economic and financial system — a \r\nreform that ends the marginalization of the African \r\ncontinent in international economic decision-making \r\nand enhances its voice and participation. The status \r\nquo, which deprives the countries of the continent of \r\ntheir right to participate actively in the management of \r\nthe global economic system, cannot continue at a time \r\nwhen that system gravely affects their economic \r\nsituation. We also cannot agree to establish a new \r\nsystem that reinforces that marginalization instead of \r\naddressing it. Therefore, we appreciate the efforts and \r\ncommitments of the G-20.  \r\n Egypt believes it is necessary to expand the \r\nG-20’s membership in order to make it more \r\nrepresentative of the African continent, in parallel with \r\ncoordinating its efforts with the United Nations system. \r\nUndoubtedly, the participation of Ethiopia, as Chair of \r\nA/64/PV.22  \r\n \r\n09-56757 20 \r\n \r\nNEPAD, and of the Chairperson of the African Union \r\nCommission in meetings of the G-20 constitutes a \r\nsignificant addition, but it is not sufficient. Africa’s \r\nrepresentation remains low in that group and needs to \r\nbe expanded as soon as possible. \r\n From another perspective, I would like to point \r\nout that international development cooperation with the \r\nAfrican continent is premised on the concept of \r\nequitable partnership. Accordingly, NEPAD was \r\ndesigned to be a central forum for a global partnership \r\nwith Africa in the economic and social fields. That \r\npartnership requires that each party meet its \r\ncommitments faithfully and fully.  \r\n Thanks to the partnership, African countries have \r\ntaken long strides in various aspects of development. I \r\nrefer in particular to the establishment and \r\noperationalization of the African Peer Review \r\nMechanism — now comprised of 30 countries, \r\nincluding Egypt — which reflects the improvement and \r\nprogress achieved by the continent in the fields of good \r\ngovernance, human rights and democracy. Africa’s \r\ncommitment to the three pillars agreed upon in the \r\n2005 summit — development, security and human \r\nrights — forms the basis of its achievements and \r\nprogress.  \r\n On the other hand, we note the slow pace with \r\nwhich our development partners have implemented \r\ntheir development commitments to the continent, for \r\nexample, the commitment by the G-8 industrialized \r\ncountries to reach the goal of doubling aid to Africa by \r\n2010, in addition to numerous commitments in the \r\nareas of foreign direct investment, international trade, \r\nofficial development assistance, external debt and other \r\nsources of development finance, all of which still need \r\nto be implemented immediately. \r\n All of those aspects suggest that the first step is \r\nto overcome the gap between what was agreed upon \r\nand what has been delivered. In this context, we \r\nreiterate our call for an international consensus on the \r\nestablishment of an intergovernmental follow-up \r\nmechanism before the end of the sixty-fifth session of \r\nthe General Assembly, based on what our leaders \r\nagreed to on 22 September 2008. That mechanism \r\nwould review the implementation of all development \r\ncommitments related to Africa, assess the fulfilment of \r\neach side’s commitments and constitute a \r\ncomprehensive framework for all existing processes \r\nthat monitor the implementation of those commitments. \r\n Egypt supports the efforts of the United Nations, \r\nin coordination with the African Union, to address \r\nconflicts in Africa, whether through addressing the \r\ncauses of conflict and carrying out conflict prevention \r\nmeasures such as early mediation, or by providing \r\nsupport to the political processes in a number of \r\nhotbeds of tension. The latter approach has contributed \r\nto reaching peaceful settlements in several conflicts, \r\nnotably the crises in Kenya and Zimbabwe, to restoring \r\nconstitutional order in Mauritania, and to the efforts to \r\ndeal with the situations in Madagascar, Guinea and the \r\nHorn of Africa, as well as other conflict situations in \r\nAfrica. \r\n From that perspective, Egypt is committed to \r\nsupporting peacekeeping operations undertaken by the \r\nUnited Nations to promote peace and stability in many \r\nAfrican countries. Egyptian participation in several \r\npeacekeeping operations on the continent — \r\nparticularly the significant Egyptian participation in \r\nthe African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in \r\nDarfur, the United Nations Mission in the Sudan and \r\nthe United Nations Organization Mission in the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo — is a \r\nmanifestation of that commitment. \r\n Here, Egypt welcomes the steps undertaken to \r\ndeepen the level of cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the African Union and among their organs, \r\nespecially with regard to the United Nations support to \r\nbuilding the African Union’s capacity in the areas of \r\nmediation, conflict prevention and promotion of human \r\nrights, as well as the Organization’s support for the \r\nAfrican Union peacekeeping operations established \r\nunder the mandate of the United Nations.  \r\n Egypt underlines the importance of enhancing the \r\npredictability and sustainability of funding of those \r\noperations in accordance with Security Council \r\nresolution 1809 (2008) and the statement by the \r\nCouncil President dated 18 March 2009 \r\n(S/PRST/2009/3). In this regard, Egypt looks forward \r\nto a fruitful discussion during the meeting to be held by \r\nthe Security Council later in October 2009 on the \r\nreport of the Secretary-General that was issued in \r\nresponse to that statement (A/64/359), as well as on the \r\nProdi report (A/63/666).  \r\n Similarly, Egypt looks forward to enhancing the \r\nrole that the United Nations plays in responding to the \r\nsituation in Somalia, in order to achieve stability and \r\nprepare the ground for the process of reconstruction \r\n A/64/PV.22\r\n \r\n21 09-56757 \r\n \r\nand development in a way that enables the Transitional \r\nFederal Government and the international community \r\nto address the repercussions of two decades of chaos, \r\nin particular the problem of piracy off the coast of \r\nSomalia. \r\n Egypt also supports the United Nations \r\npeacebuilding efforts in Burundi, Sierra Leone, \r\nGuinea-Bissau and the Central African Republic \r\nthrough the Peacebuilding Commission, as well as \r\nthrough the Peacebuilding Fund projects that benefit \r\nmore African countries. Egypt stresses the need to \r\nupgrade the level of cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the African Union in peacebuilding, along \r\nthe lines of the existing cooperation in the fields of \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes and peacekeeping. \r\nEgypt looks forward to participating actively in the \r\nreview of the work of the Peacebuilding Commission \r\nscheduled for 2010, after the completion this year of \r\nthe review process for the Peacebuilding Fund. \r\n Since the Millennium Summit launched the \r\nDecade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing Countries, \r\nParticularly in Africa, international efforts have \r\nsucceeded in increasing the number of malaria-free \r\ncountries to 93 and have tangibly reduced infection \r\nrates in a number of countries. That was a result of \r\nprogrammes implemented through cooperation among \r\nthe United Nations and its relevant bodies, \r\ninternational financial institutions, non-governmental \r\norganizations, civil society and the private sector, and \r\nof the increase in funding for such programmes. \r\nHowever, the continuance of the disease in 109 \r\ncountries reaffirms the need for ongoing support to \r\nensure the sustainability of funding in order to cut the \r\nmortality rate by half by 2010, with a view to reducing \r\nmortality by 75 per cent by 2015. \r\n Those facts underline the dire need to support \r\nefforts to revamp the infrastructure of the economic, \r\neducation and health systems in developing countries. \r\nAlso, the technical knowledge needed to support such \r\nefforts and ensure the early diagnosis, treatment and \r\nprevention of the disease through the participation of \r\nall sectors of society must be shared.  \r\n That approach entails intensifying national \r\nawareness campaigns, along with implementing \r\nprevention and treatment programmes. At the same \r\ntime, it also means working to improve health-care \r\nsystems and to train qualified cadres, a matter that \r\nexceeds the capacities of the Governments of many of \r\nthose countries unless foreign assistance is provided. \r\nThat is particularly true in Africa, whose countries are \r\noverwhelmed by the burden of malaria. \r\n In this context we commend the recent \r\ndeclaration issued by donor industrialized countries \r\nduring the G-8 summit in Italy in 2009, which resulted \r\nfrom Egypt’s recent intensive coordination effort for \r\nthe allocation of $2 billion to support projects to \r\ncombat the spread of malaria. Furthermore, Egypt \r\ncommends the initiative of the President of Tanzania to \r\nestablish the African Leaders Malaria Alliance, which \r\nwas launched in New York on 23 September 2009. \r\nThose efforts require parallel commitment on the part \r\nof the international community to support them at all \r\nlevels. \r\n In addition to national capacity-building, it is \r\nimperative to concentrate on enhancing regional \r\ncapacities to confront the transboundary aspects of \r\nmalaria. That was one of the motivations of the \r\ndecision of the African Union Summit in Sirte in 2005, \r\nbased on an Egyptian initiative to establish an African \r\ncentre to promote cooperation and share knowledge \r\nand expertise in the fight against malaria and to liaise \r\nwith specialized centres in this field all over the \r\ncontinent.  \r\n In addition, further enhancement of international \r\nefforts is needed. Egypt thus looks forward to the \r\ngranting of observer status in the General Assembly to \r\nthe Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and \r\nMalaria as an additional step towards the strengthening \r\nof the existing relationship between the United Nations \r\nand the private sector in this arena. It is also imperative \r\nto resolve the trade-related aspects of the intellectual \r\nproperty rights to malaria medications and vaccines \r\ncurrently in circulation or being developed. Indeed, the \r\ninternational community must shoulder this \r\nresponsibility so as to ensure the effectiveness of our \r\nefforts to eliminate malaria and avoid risking its spread \r\nagain if we are to realize our common goals, especially \r\nMDG 6, in every State without exception and by the \r\ntarget date. \r\n Mr. Kleib (Indonesia): It is an honour for me to \r\nspeak on this important agenda item. Indonesia has a \r\nhistoric link with the African continent through the \r\nAsia-Africa Bandung Conference of 1955. We \r\ntherefore welcome the opportunity for the international \r\ncommunity to lend its support to the development \r\nefforts of the region as embodied in the New \r\nA/64/PV.22  \r\n \r\n09-56757 22 \r\n \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). I \r\nthank the Secretary-General for the progress reports on \r\nthe implementation of NEPAD (A/64/204) and on the \r\ncauses of conflict and promotion of durable peace and \r\nsustainable development in Africa (A/64/210). \r\n Indonesia associates itself with the statements \r\nmade by the Sudan on behalf of the Group of 77 and \r\nChina and by Thailand on behalf of the Association of \r\nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN). \r\n The Secretary-General’s reports in documents \r\nA/64/204 and A/64/208 point to several significant \r\ndevelopments under NEPAD. The important progress \r\nmade on several fronts speaks to the unswerving \r\ncommitment of African leaders to ensure that African \r\npriorities are defined and truly owned by Africa. \r\nUndeniably, however, like other developing regions, \r\nAfrica faces emerging and persistent challenges. \r\n First, while Africa was far from the epicentre of \r\nthe economic and financial crisis, its impact has \r\ncertainly added to the ongoing financial impediments \r\nthat the continent confronts. Secondly, food security in \r\nAfrica continues to lag. The food crisis in 2008 drove \r\nmore people in Africa into poverty. In the meantime, \r\nthe continent’s population continues to rise. Thirdly, \r\nclimate change, which is expected to cause prolonged \r\ndrought, is likely to seriously affect the availability of \r\nfood. The combination of those problems, together \r\nwith other development challenges, has slowed \r\nAfrica’s momentum towards internationally agreed \r\ndevelopment goals, including the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). \r\n Urgent, bold policy measures, with short- and \r\nlong-term objectives that recognize the interlinked \r\nnature of those crises, can contribute to regaining and \r\naccelerating momentum towards the MDGs and other \r\ninternationally agreed development goals in Africa. In \r\nthis context, the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture \r\nDevelopment Programme is an important initiative that \r\nshould be given full support, in view of its important \r\naim of launching a new green revolution in Africa. \r\nFurthermore, achieving critical momentum towards \r\ndevelopment goals also requires effective adaptation to \r\nclimate change so as to avoid its adverse effects. Africa \r\nand other developing countries, however, lack such \r\nadaptive capacity. My delegation therefore urges the \r\ncompletion of an ambitious agreement on adaptation in \r\nCopenhagen. \r\n Permit me to make some brief remarks on \r\nsub-item (b) of agenda item 63: causes of conflict and \r\nthe promotion of durable peace and sustainable \r\ndevelopment in Africa. We note from the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report in document A/64/210 the steady \r\nprogress that has been made in promoting peace in \r\nAfrica. Given the advantages that African regional and \r\nsubregional organizations possess in their potential to \r\ninfluence the prevention and resolution of conflicts, the \r\nUnited Nations should enhance their capacity for \r\ncapacity-building, preventive diplomacy and \r\npeacemaking. \r\n Based on our shared and long-standing history \r\nwith the peoples of Africa, Indonesia renewed its \r\ncommitment to strengthen cooperation at the 2005 \r\nAsia-Africa Summit. That Summit gave rise to the \r\nNew Asia-Africa Strategic Partnership (NAASP), \r\nwhose implementation is centred on the three pillars of \r\npolitical solidarity, economic cooperation and \r\nsociocultural relations. To further the two regions’ \r\nmutual commitment, a meeting held in Indonesia on \r\n12 October adopted the Jakarta Statement on the New \r\nAsian-African Strategic Partnership. That document is \r\na further measure to strengthen and solidify \r\ncooperation between the regions through the \r\nimplementation of concrete activities and programmes \r\nin the NAASP framework. Indonesia also looks \r\nforward to the second Asia-Africa Summit, to be held \r\nin South Africa next year, representing a major \r\nmilestone for the two regions. \r\n Through this series of events, we hope to fully \r\nand effectively implement the eight areas of \r\ncooperation under the NAASP: food security, energy \r\nsecurity, tourism, small and medium enterprises, \r\ncounter-terrorism, combating transnational organized \r\ncrime, the Asian-African Development University \r\nNetwork, and gender equality and women’s \r\nempowerment. Indonesia, as the host of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement Training Centre, has also been \r\npromoting and enhancing capacity-building in the \r\nNAASP areas, as well as in other areas such as health, \r\ndisaster management and risk reduction. We further \r\nencourage the use of the Training Centre as a means to \r\nstrengthen and promote closer cooperation between the \r\nregions of Asia and Africa. \r\n Through NEPAD, Africa has taken bold steps to \r\ndetermine and take full control of its destiny. Africa \r\nhas taken important measures, and the international \r\n A/64/PV.22\r\n \r\n23 09-56757 \r\n \r\ncommunity needs to fully support its home-grown \r\nefforts. \r\n Mr. Badji (Senegal) (spoke in French): Senegal \r\nwould like to thank the Secretary-General for his \r\ncomprehensive report to the General Assembly on the \r\nprogress achieved in the implementation of the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) \r\n(A/64/204) and for his note on the Decade to Roll Back \r\nMalaria on the African continent (A/64/302). We are \r\nonce again grateful for their quality. \r\n I would also like to stress that my delegation \r\nassociates itself with the declarations made on behalf \r\nof the African Group and of the Group of 77 and \r\nChina. \r\n The reports highlight Africa’s efforts to free itself \r\nfrom underdevelopment, but they also present the \r\nexisting gaps and constraints, including in the area of \r\nessential international support. In creating NEPAD in \r\n2001, Africa’s leaders wished to give a new impetus to \r\nthe response to the continent’s problems by identifying \r\ninnovative home-grown strategies that would put \r\nAfrica on the track for development. Beyond \r\nrecognizing the dire need for an indigenous culture of \r\ndevelopment, NEPAD remains a vision of a new \r\nconcept of the nature and direction of Africa’s relations \r\nwith the rest of the world, which must henceforth be \r\nbased on the principle of genuine partnership. That \r\nreconsideration of what Africa brings to the table of \r\ngiving and receiving sets out the changes necessary for \r\nthe arrival of the global New Deal that is so desired. \r\n The whole world recognizes that Africa has made \r\nsignificant progress on several fronts during the first \r\neight years of this ambitious development programme. \r\nThis is true of the progressive transformation the \r\ncontinent has made towards stability, despite some \r\npersistent hotbeds of latent or resurgent conflict. This \r\nis also true of the strengthened governance and \r\ntransparency and increasing democratization of African \r\nsociety, as it is true of the promotion of gender and \r\nhuman rights issues. \r\n This positive picture cannot hide the harsh and \r\nbitter reality of a continent where serious food, \r\neconomic and financial crises continue to cause \r\npersistent insurmountable difficulties seriously \r\ncompromising Africa’s future. \r\n If it is indeed true that the crises affect all \r\ndeveloping and developed countries, it is no less true \r\nthat Africa has been hit particularly hard by this \r\nalarming situation because of its vulnerability. Figures \r\nspeak for themselves here. Out of more than \r\n920 million people — 60 per cent of whom are under \r\n25 years of age — more than two fifths live under the \r\npoverty threshold. There are between 21 million and \r\n23 million people infected with HIV/AIDS, with an \r\nadditional 1.7 million infected each year. There are \r\nalarming health indicators with regard to high infant \r\nand maternal mortality rates and 90 per cent of the \r\ndeaths due to malaria on the planet occur in Africa. \r\n In 2009 the growth rate fell to 0.9 per cent, \r\nwhereas it was at 6 per cent between 2004 and 2008. \r\nMore worrying and even more serious are the \r\nfrightening statistics on the status of food worldwide. \r\nAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organization of \r\nthe United Nations, more than 1 billion people suffer \r\nfrom hunger and nearly one third of them — \r\n300 million — are in Africa.  \r\n Given this complex international environment the \r\nchallenges facing Africa have only continued to \r\nincrease, placing it today at a crossroad when it comes \r\nto implementing NEPAD sectoral priorities and \r\nachieving African development.  \r\n It is easy to imagine the magnitude of the task, in \r\nparticular when, in addition to the current crises, there \r\nare other nearly insurmountable obstacles — disasters \r\nwhich shake our economies almost daily — further \r\ndistancing us from the signs of a possible recovery.  \r\n Here I refer in particular to the absence of any \r\noutcome of the Doha trade negotiations, which were \r\nsupposed to give momentum to the exports of the \r\ncountries of the South. It is clear that without limits on \r\nthe agricultural subsidies which so severely distort free \r\ntrade, the frontiers of poverty will not be pushed back. \r\nI also refer to the crushing burden of debt and \r\nweakened foreign direct investment (FDI), both of \r\nwhich cast dark shadows over prospects for economic \r\ngrowth. \r\n Lastly, I refer to the unfair and unjustifiable \r\nsituation affecting many African countries due to the \r\nuntimely and uncontrolled fluctuations in the price of \r\noil. Even if development aid, debt cancellation or free \r\ntrade remain valuable for the countries of the South, \r\nparticularly those in Africa, they will only be of limited \r\nimpact in the current situation without further specific \r\nmeasures to correct the detrimental effects of the \r\nconstraints. \r\nA/64/PV.22  \r\n \r\n09-56757 24 \r\n \r\n Here I welcome the joint initiative of NEPAD and \r\nthe Organization for Economic Cooperation and \r\nDevelopment (OECD) which aims to bring the level of \r\nFDI to $60 billion, as intended by the OECD, to foster \r\ninvestment, promote lasting growth, create \r\nemployment and reduce poverty. The Group of 20 has \r\nalso announced helpful measures, in particular with \r\nregard to Africa, in reaffirming its resolve to attain the \r\nMDGs and to meet its aid commitments. Among these \r\nmeasures is the commitment to provide $50 billion \r\nper annum for social welfare, to foster trade and to \r\nmaintain development in low-income countries. \r\nDespite these efforts by our partners, a real deficit of \r\nappropriate international support remains.  \r\n But that is not the only obstacle in the path of \r\nAfrica’s economic resurgence. The failure to integrate \r\nNEPAD’s priorities with the actions of the United \r\nNations system of organizations is another situation \r\ndeserving criticism. These bodies must act effectively \r\nand in a manner that fits with the development model \r\nestablished by NEPAD in accordance with resolution \r\n57/7. This is an urgent and indispensable matter.  \r\n I cannot conclude without expressing Senegal’s \r\nsupport for the Secretary-General’s recommendations \r\non the implementation of prudent borrowing policies \r\nwith improved management of foreign debt in order to \r\nattenuate the socio-economic impact of the current \r\ncrisis, and on the Global Impact and Vulnerability Alert \r\nSystem, which is designed to react in a coordinated \r\nmanner to crises in order to mitigate their effects. \r\n Sustainable development in Africa can be \r\nachieved only with the establishment of lasting peace \r\nand stability. Aware as it is of this, my country has \r\nspared no effort to provide its good offices in several \r\nconflict situations in West Africa and we are pleased \r\ntoday to see our brothers in Mauritania and Guinea-\r\nBissau return to a climate of peace, fostering economic \r\nand social development. This is the same ideal of peace \r\nand fraternity that my country hopes to see prevail in \r\nour sister Republic of Guinea so that this country, so \r\ndear to mine, can once again be set on the path to \r\npeace, stability and development so fervently desired \r\nby its great people.  \r\n The same must be true of Somalia, plunged into \r\ninterminable chaos; Madagascar whose stability has \r\nbeen so severely shaken, as well as for the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo and Darfur, where we are \r\nparticipating in peacekeeping operations. The \r\ninternational community must therefore remain vigilant \r\nand attentive to all these situations so that lasting peace \r\ncan be established definitively in these countries and \r\nregions of our continent.  \r\n International action is also absolutely necessary \r\nto halt the devastating malaria pandemic which claims \r\nso many victims every year in Africa — more than \r\n1 million — and causes enormous losses in the \r\ncontinent’s gross national income, estimated at more \r\nthan $12 billion. \r\n African efforts must be further supported with \r\ngreater mobilization of resources, in particular through \r\nthe Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and \r\nMalaria and implementation of the quick impact \r\ninitiatives agreed upon at the 2005 World Summit. \r\n In concluding, I would like to recall that NEPAD \r\nprovides the world a unique and effective framework \r\nfor implementing a partnership for development for the \r\nbenefit of Africa. We hope that the international \r\ncommunity and the United Nations system will be able \r\nto lend further support to the realization of the \r\nambitious hope that NEPAD holds for the leaders of \r\nAfrica, which is to propel Africa on the upward path to \r\ndevelopment and prosperity. \r\n Mr. Scott (United States of America): In the \r\ncontext of this important meeting, I would like to \r\naddress one key element to which we are pleased to \r\nmake a special contribution. For many years, the \r\nUnited States has been committed to the prevention \r\nand treatment of malaria, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, \r\nand we remain determined to combat those diseases \r\nworldwide, as part of our commitment to attain the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. \r\n The United States Government’s commitment to \r\nfight malaria is a key component of our foreign \r\nassistance strategy. We have worked in close \r\ncollaboration with host countries, other donors, \r\nnon-governmental, faith-based and community \r\norganizations, the private sector and the United \r\nNations. The United States Government’s assistance in \r\nthe fight against malaria and in the wider health sector \r\nin developing countries has helped bring about \r\nunprecedented improvements in public health. To \r\nstrengthen those efforts, President Obama has \r\nannounced a six-year, $63 billion global health \r\ninitiative that will allow the United States Government \r\nto continue to lead in the fight against malaria, \r\nHIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. We will do so while \r\n A/64/PV.22\r\n \r\n25 09-56757 \r\n \r\nfocusing increasing attention on strengthening health \r\nsystems and broaching broader health challenges, \r\nincluding child and maternal health, family planning \r\nand neglected tropical diseases. \r\n Malaria is one of the major causes of illness and \r\ndeath among children under the age of five in Africa \r\nand adversely affects productivity among all age \r\ngroups. Malaria places a tremendous burden on \r\nnational health systems as well as individual families. \r\nEconomists estimate that malaria accounts for \r\napproximately 40 per cent of public health \r\nexpenditures in Africa and annual economic costs of \r\n1.3 per cent of the continent’s gross domestic product. \r\n The United States is a major supporter of the \r\nGlobal Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, \r\nand a portion of those United States contributions \r\nsupport malaria programmes through the President’s \r\nMalaria Initiative. The United States is helping 15 \r\nhigh-burden countries in Africa to scale up effective \r\nmalaria prevention and treatment interventions, in the \r\nform of insecticide, treated mosquito nets, combination \r\ntreatments, indoor residual spraying with insecticides \r\nand preventive treatment of pregnant women. In close \r\ncooperation with host countries and other development \r\npartners, we are seeking major reductions in the \r\nnumber of people infected with malaria in Rwanda, \r\nZambia and Zanzibar. Declines at the district level \r\nhave also been reported from Mozambique, Tanzania \r\nand Uganda. These achievements have been associated \r\nwith substantially reduced mortality rates of children \r\nunder the age of five in both Rwanda and Zambia. \r\n During the first three years of implementation, \r\nthe United States reached more than 32 million people \r\nwith malaria prevention or treatment measures. In \r\n2008, we procured more than 6.4 million long-lasting \r\ninsecticide-treated nets for free distribution to pregnant \r\nwomen and young children and a total of 15.6 million \r\nartemisinin-based combination treatments. Indoor \r\nresidual spraying activities covered 6 million houses \r\nand protected nearly 25 million people at risk of \r\nmalaria. In addition, the President’s Malaria Initiative \r\nsupported a broad range of programmes to strengthen \r\nhealth systems and health education in host countries. \r\n By reducing the burden of malaria in highly \r\nendemic countries, where the disease is a leading child \r\nkiller and often accounts for 30 to 40 per cent of \r\noutpatient visits and hospital admissions, our \r\nassistance through the Malaria Initiative allows critical \r\nresources and overstretched health workers to \r\nconcentrate on controlling other childhood illnesses \r\nsuch as diarrhoea and pneumonia. In addition to the 15 \r\nfocus countries, the United States has anti-malaria \r\nprogrammes in four non-focus countries and two \r\nregional platforms — the Amazon Malaria Initiative, \r\ncovering eight countries making up the Amazon Basin \r\nof South America, and the Mekong Malaria \r\nProgramme, covering five countries, plus the Yunnan \r\nProvince of China, in the Greater Mekong subregion of \r\nSouth-East Asia. \r\n To conclude, I would like to note that while the \r\nUnited States Government has had significant \r\nanti-malaria programmes for years, the current focus \r\nand funding is unprecedented. The President’s Malaria \r\nInitiative represents a historic $1.2 billion, five-year \r\nexpansion of United States Government resources to \r\nfight malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, the region most \r\naffected by the disease. The goal of this initiative is to \r\nreduce malaria-related deaths by 50 per cent in the \r\n15 African countries with high burdens of the malady \r\n— leading to the possibility of a better life for those \r\nspared the ravages of this dread disease. \r\n Mr. Benitez Versón (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nCuba wholeheartedly endorses the statement made on \r\nthis important item by the delegation of the Sudan on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China.  \r\n Today, 20 October, our country celebrates Cuban \r\nCulture Day. On today’s date in 1868, in the city of \r\nBayamo, which had recently been taken by rebel \r\ntroops, the Bayamesa — Bayamo’s song — was sung \r\nfor the first time in Cuba. This marching song became \r\nour national anthem. Barely 10 days after the start of \r\nour First War of Independence, Carlos Manuel de \r\nCéspedes, the father of our country, set his slaves free. \r\nThis was one of the most significant acts of justice in \r\nthe early history of our country. The historical bonds \r\nbetween Cuba and Africa go back five centuries, when \r\nover 1.3 million African slaves arrived on our soil. It is \r\nnot possible to grasp the cultural and political history \r\nof the Cuban archipelago without taking into account \r\nthe African stamp on our genes and social life.  \r\n Before the revolutionary triumph in 1959, the \r\nneocolonial political elites in Cuba, controlled by \r\nforeign capital interests, did very little to allow Africa \r\nto take its rightful place in our society. Only the zeal of \r\nthe Cuban Revolution to build a new society gave \r\nvalidation to what our national poet Nicolás Guillén \r\nA/64/PV.22  \r\n \r\n09-56757 26 \r\n \r\ncalled our Cuban colour, giving expression in that \r\nimage to what we are and what we aspire to be. Africa \r\nis an inseparable part of our existence, of our island \r\nethos. For Cubans, Africa is an extension of our \r\nhomeland. \r\n The National Museum of the Slave Route is \r\nlocated in the San Severino Castle, in the city of \r\nMatanzas. Inaugurated this past June, it perpetuates the \r\nmemory of the rebel spirit of African ethnic groups like \r\nLucumis, Carabalis, Congos, Gangas, Mandingas, \r\nMinas, Bibis and Yorubas who, after being dragged \r\nfrom their homelands, refused to allow their destiny to \r\nbe decided by the colonizers of that time. Therefore, no \r\none should be surprised at our coming here today to \r\nproclaim with just pride that the Cuban people has \r\ndirectly and naturally inherited the gallantry, bravery, \r\nand culture of the African resistance, which has been \r\nheroically struggling for centuries to overcome \r\nchallenges that still exist today. \r\n Very shortly after the triumph of the revolution, \r\nCuba began modestly repaying its huge debt to those \r\nhundreds of thousands of African slaves who made \r\nCuba their homeland and dedicated their lives to its \r\nindependence. The profound internationalist ideals of \r\nthe Cuban revolution have enabled our country to stand \r\nfirmly at Africa’s side with unconditional support for \r\nmatters ranging from anti-colonialist struggles to \r\ncooperation projects in many fields for the economic \r\nand social development of the continent. \r\n More than 381,000 Cuban soldiers and officials \r\nfought unselfishly to defend the integrity and \r\nsovereignty of our brotherly African nations over a \r\nperiod of almost three decades. And from Africa we \r\nbrought back only the remains of our dead comrades \r\nand the honour of having accomplished our duty. \r\nToday, more than 2,400 Cubans provide services in \r\n35 African nations with a view to promoting \r\ndevelopment in areas as diverse as public health, \r\neducation, agriculture, sports, construction and others. \r\n As in the past, Cuba will continue contributing its \r\nhuman capital and experience in collaboration with \r\nmany countries of the continent. Today as part of the \r\nComprehensive Health Care Programme alone, more \r\nthan 1,120 Cuban medical doctors and health \r\ntechnicians work in 23 African countries, providing \r\nservices to a population of over 48 million people. At \r\npresent, more than 2,200 youths from 45 African \r\ncountries are studying in our universities and \r\npolytechnic institutes. To date, over 32,000 young \r\npeople from the continent have graduated in various \r\nspecialities. \r\n For its part, Africa has always stood by Cuba’s \r\nside. During more than 50 years of an unjust and cruel \r\neconomic, commercial and financial blockade imposed \r\nby the United States on Cuba, African Governments \r\nand peoples have closed ranks 17 times at the United \r\nNations General Assembly to demand the right of the \r\nCuban people to decide their destiny. We are confident \r\nthey will do so once again on 28 October in this very \r\nHall.  \r\n Likewise, Africa demonstrated its strong bonds of \r\nsolidarity with the Cuban people after the country was \r\nlashed by devastating hurricanes in 2008. Once again, \r\nwe express our thanks for the moral and material \r\nsupport we received from our African brothers and \r\nsisters in such difficult circumstances. \r\n The need for Africa’s development will not be \r\nmet by the rhetorical lamentations of powerful people \r\nor by the repeated review of statistics referring to \r\nvarious calamities. Inevitably, there must be a change \r\nin the current international system — a system that \r\nplunges 80 per cent of the world’s population into \r\npoverty, while the remaining 20 per cent of that \r\npopulation, living in the rich countries, squanders the \r\nworld’s resources. It is that same system that requires \r\nAfrican countries to continue spending five times more \r\nof their resources in servicing a shocking foreign debt \r\nthan on health and education programmes. \r\n It is that same system where powerful \r\nmultinationals strive to control African mineral \r\nresources; where, with a few exceptions, rich countries \r\nfail to comply with the humble commitments of official \r\ndevelopment assistance and where an unjust regime of \r\npatents and trade prevents the development of African \r\nnations.  \r\n To address African problems, we must at all costs \r\nrid ourselves of the philosophy of profit that underpins \r\nthe current international order. Our country will \r\ncontinue to support the African Union and all of the \r\nregional coordination mechanisms in their efforts to \r\nfind their own solutions to African problems. However, \r\nAfrica also needs the determined support of the \r\ninternational community. Africa needs an integrated \r\napproach from the United Nations to solve all problems \r\nrelated to peace, security and development on the \r\ncontinent. \r\n A/64/PV.22\r\n \r\n27 09-56757 \r\n \r\n To conclude, I wish to emphasize that Cuba \r\nadvocates a more just, equitable and peaceful \r\ninternational order. That is the only requirement for \r\nAfrica and the rest of the developing nations to face the \r\nchallenges of working for the well-being of our \r\npeoples without confronting absurd obstacles. \r\n We do not call for a paternalistic approach to \r\nAfrica, but rather equal opportunities. Africa requires \r\nand deserves, first and foremost solidarity and respect. \r\nOur African brothers and sisters can always count on \r\nthe unwavering solidarity and unconditional support of \r\nCuba. \r\n Mr. Sumi (Japan): It is my great pleasure and \r\nhonour to address the Assembly today to discuss the \r\nimportant agenda items relating to African \r\ndevelopment. Before I begin, I wish to thank the \r\nSecretary-General and his staff for their diligent work \r\nin consolidating the reports we have received. Also, let \r\nme congratulate the integration of the New Partnership \r\nfor Africa’s Development into the African Union. \r\n African development is one of the most urgent \r\npriorities for the world today and for the United \r\nNations. At the Fourth Tokyo International Conference \r\non African Development (TICAD IV) held in May \r\n2008, we heard the voices of Africa’s leaders, and now \r\nit is time for us to explain how we have responded to \r\nthose voices.  \r\n Japan pledged at TICAD IV to double its official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) to Africa, to \r\nproactively and flexibly provide up to $4 billion in soft \r\nloans and to work to double Japanese private \r\ninvestment to Africa over the following five years. In \r\nimplementing its commitments, the Government of \r\nJapan established a TICAD Follow-up Mechanism as a \r\nframework for monitoring implementation of the \r\nYokohama Action Plan and putting it into practice. Last \r\nMarch, the TICAD Ministerial Follow-up Meeting was \r\nheld in Botswana to review and assess TICAD-related \r\nactivities, and recommendations were made to \r\naccelerate implementation of the Action Plan. \r\n Japanese ODA to Africa covers a wide range of \r\nsectors, including infrastructure, agriculture, trade and \r\ninvestment, community development, health care, \r\neducation, water and combating climate change. These \r\nareas correspond to the key sectoral priorities of \r\nNEPAD and reflect the genuine needs of Africa. For \r\nexample, food security in Africa is an important issue. \r\nOn the occasion of TICAD IV, the Japan International \r\nCooperation Agency launched the Coalition for African \r\nRice Development initiative in partnership with the \r\nAlliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA) to \r\nsupport the efforts of African countries to increase rice \r\nproduction. The initiative has already been activated in \r\n12 African countries. \r\n On the occasion of the general debate, Japan \r\nhosted a side event entitled “Promoting Responsible \r\nInternational Investment in Agriculture”, along with \r\nthe United Nations Conference on Trade and \r\nDevelopment, the Food and Agriculture Organization \r\nof the United Nations, the International Fund for \r\nAgricultural Development and the World Bank. \r\nParticipants shared the view that responsible \r\ninvestment in agriculture will harmonize and maximize \r\nthe interests of receiving countries, local communities \r\nand investors.  \r\n This meeting marked the first step towards \r\ndeveloping principles and an international framework \r\nto promote such investment. Furthermore, as an \r\nimportant pillar of the TICAD IV follow-up, public-\r\nprivate partnerships are being actively promoted with a \r\nview to improving the investment climate in Africa.  \r\n At TICAD IV, the Japan Bank for International \r\nCooperation (JBIC) announced it would provide up to \r\n$2.5 billion over five years to encourage Japanese \r\nprivate sector investment in Africa. By September this \r\nyear, the disbursement of $1.2 billion had been \r\napproved. The JBIC Facility for African Investment \r\nwas established in April this year with a view to \r\nsupporting Japanese firms to engage in business \r\ndevelopment in Africa by offering them equity \r\ninvestments, guarantees and local currency financing. \r\nIn addition, $300 million in soft loans has been \r\nextended to the African Development Bank to assist the \r\nprivate sector in African countries. \r\n Another example of public-private partnership is \r\nthe fifth Africa-Asia Business Forum, which Japan \r\nco-organized in collaboration with the Government of \r\nUganda and relevant United Nations agencies in \r\nKampala in June this year. The Forum focused on the \r\ntheme of forging business linkages for sustainable \r\ntourism development in Africa. Over 250 participants \r\nfrom more than 30 countries, including representatives \r\nfrom government, business, civil society and \r\ninternational organizations participated in this event. \r\n In promoting cooperation between Africa and \r\nJapan, we fully respect local leadership, ownership and \r\nA/64/PV.22  \r\n \r\n09-56757 28 \r\n \r\npartnership, as enshrined in the core principles and \r\nvalues of NEPAD. We regard these principles as \r\nessential to the promotion of sustainable development \r\nin Africa. The concept of human security needs to be \r\ntaken into consideration in the implementation of \r\npolicy measures aiming to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) in order to ensure that the \r\ndesired accelerated growth will benefit and empower \r\nindividuals and communities and not aggravate social \r\nand economic disparities. As Prime Minister Yukio \r\nHatoyama stated at the General Assembly last month, \r\nJapan intends to redouble its efforts towards the \r\nachievement of the MDGs and the promotion of human \r\nsecurity in Africa. \r\n The Government of Japan is pleased to see the \r\nSecretary-General’s note on the 2001-2010 Decade to \r\nRoll Back Malaria in Developing Countries, \r\nParticularly in Africa (A/64/302). My delegation is also \r\npleased to learn about malaria control achievements in \r\nAfrica last year, particularly in five specific African \r\ncountries — Eritrea, the Gambia, Rwanda, Sao Tome \r\nand Principe and Zambia. These countries are \r\napproaching or have reached the 2010 World Health \r\nOrganization World Health Assembly and Roll Back \r\nMalaria Partnership morbidity and mortality reduction \r\nimpact target of 50 per cent or greater. We note, \r\nhowever, that, although we have seen many \r\nimprovements, most countries have not yet achieved \r\nuniversal coverage with insecticide-treated nets and \r\nother malaria control interventions. The Government of \r\nJapan, as a major donor to the Global Fund to Fight \r\nAIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, renews its \r\ncommitment to international cooperation on malaria \r\ncontrol. \r\n In conclusion, my delegation would like to \r\nreaffirm Japan’s long-term commitment and \r\ncontribution to the development of Africa as a \r\ncontinent of hope and opportunity. \r\n \r\nProgramme of work \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I should like to draw the \r\nattention of the General Assembly to document \r\nA/INF/64/3/Rev.1, which contains the revised \r\nprogramme of work of the Assembly and schedule of \r\nplenary meetings for the period 15 October to \r\n15 December 2009, and which was issued on Monday, \r\n12 October 2009. \r\n Concerning agenda item 110 (b) on the election \r\nof members of the Economic and Social Council that is \r\nscheduled to take place on Monday, 26 October 2009, I \r\nshould like to draw the attention of members to a letter \r\ndated 16 October 2009 and circulated in document \r\nA/64/493 from the Permanent Representative of the \r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, \r\nin his capacity as Chair of the Group of Western \r\nEuropean and Other States. In this regard, I should like \r\nto inform members that on Monday, 26 October, the \r\nGeneral Assembly will first conduct a by-election to \r\nfill the four vacancies of the Western European and \r\nother Group, and then proceed to the election of \r\n18 members of the Economic and Social Council. \r\n Members are also informed that, at the request of \r\nthe sponsors, consideration of agenda item 46, “Global \r\nroad safety crisis”, scheduled for Tuesday, 27 October \r\n2009, has been postponed to a later date to be \r\nannounced. Finally, I should also like to remind \r\nmembers that the lists of speakers for items listed in \r\ndocument A/INF/64/3/Rev.1 are open. \r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\n"
