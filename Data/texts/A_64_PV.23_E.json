In our view, many African countries have \r\nmade important progress in recent years and significant \r\nparts of the continent are moving in the right direction. \r\nThere have been more free and fair elections, and more \r\nprudent economic management, with more reform-\r\nminded and democratic leadership. \r\n Africa continues to face major health, education, \r\nagricultural, environmental and peace and security \r\nchallenges. Much remains to be done to assist African \r\ncountries to achieve the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) and build stable political and economic \r\ninstitutions. Achieving the MDGs is a shared \r\nresponsibility, based on commitment, partnership, and \r\nperseverance. \r\n Canada is doing its part to help Africa achieve the \r\nMDGs. Canada has met its Group of Eight (G-8) \r\ncommitment to double aid to Africa from 2003-2004 \r\nlevels to $2.1 billion. Furthermore, Canada reaffirmed \r\nits commitment to double its overall international \r\nassistance by 2010-2011 from 2001-2002 levels. This \r\nwill bring Canada’s total international assistance to \r\napproximately $5 billion per year. \r\n As part of the joint G-8 pledge on food security, \r\nCanada will more than double its investment in this \r\narea and provide $600 million in increased funding \r\nover three years, reaching $1.18 billion in overall \r\nfunding. Canada has also untied all its food aid and \r\ncommitted to untie all bilateral assistance by 2013. \r\nThis will not only improve aid by increasing its impact, \r\nbut also enable us to respond better to the needs of \r\ndeveloping countries. \r\n For example, in response to the African \r\nDevelopment Bank’s forecast of a shortfall of \r\nresources over the next year, Canada announced at the \r\nlast Group of 20 summit that it will temporarily triple \r\nits callable capital. This initiative will provide the \r\nBank with about $2.6 billion in additional capacity. \r\nCanada’s response recognizes the efforts by the African \r\nDevelopment Bank to ensure that it has sufficient \r\nA/64/PV.23  \r\n \r\n09-56896 2 \r\n \r\nresources with which to respond quickly to the \r\ndemands of its borrowing members while it continues \r\nits poverty reduction efforts. \r\n Private sector expansion is an important \r\ncomponent of overall development. Canada is a \r\nsignificant economic partner for Africa, with more than \r\n290 Canadian companies operating in at least \r\n36 countries. Canada is the largest non-African foreign \r\ninvestor in mining in Africa, often playing a significant \r\nrole in the development of the mining industry on the \r\ncontinent. The Canadian Government encourages and \r\nindeed expects Canadian companies to meet high \r\nstandards of corporate social responsibility when they \r\noperate abroad. \r\n Democratic and effective governance are also key \r\nto the success of African socio-economic development. \r\nThe New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD) and its African Peer Review Mechanism \r\n(APRM) are vehicles to help achieve this goal through \r\nthe creation of an enabling environment for stability \r\nand socio-economic development. Canada strongly \r\nsupports NEPAD and considers the APRM initiative \r\nvital to the overall success of Africa’s development. \r\nWe welcome the progress made by African countries in \r\nthe implementation of the APRM. Twenty-nine \r\ncountries have already signed on, and nine have \r\ncompleted the review process. Canada was among the \r\nfirst donors to support the APRM and has contributed \r\n$6 million to the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme Trust Fund. \r\n Canada has also maintained a strong commitment \r\nto regional and multilateral initiatives to advance \r\nglobal malaria prevention and control efforts. In 2008, \r\nCanada pledged an additional $450 million over three \r\nyears to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis \r\nand Malaria, bringing Canada’s total commitment to \r\nclose to $1 billion. Approximately one quarter of these \r\nfunds are channelled towards fighting malaria. \r\n Since 2003, the Canadian International \r\nDevelopment Agency’s support for the prevention of \r\nmalaria has resulted in the distribution of over \r\n7.9 million bednets in Africa through partnerships with \r\nthe Red Cross, UNICEF and World Vision Canada; \r\n$60 million has been allocated to increase access to \r\ntreatment at the community level for malaria and \r\npneumonia, two of the leading killers of children \r\nworldwide. It is conservatively estimated that these \r\ntwo programmes will save over 250,000 lives. \r\n Canada has long been engaged with our African \r\npartners in finding durable solutions to protracted \r\nconflicts across the continent, both through direct \r\nbilateral partners and through our engagement in \r\nsupport for African institutions, including the African \r\nUnion (AU), the Economic Community of West \r\nAfrican States (ECOWAS) and the Southern Africa \r\nDevelopment Community. We are pleased with the \r\nleadership roles that these institutions are assuming to \r\ndeal with crises in the region. To cite but one recent \r\nexample, ECOWAS and the AU have been co-leading \r\nthe International Contact Group addressing the situation \r\nin Guinea. Furthermore, as a committed member of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and Chair of its Sierra \r\nLeone country-specific configuration, Canada is also \r\nworking in direct partnership with States seeking a \r\npeaceful and sustainable recovery from conflict. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n The ongoing conflict in the Sudan and the \r\nresultant humanitarian crisis in Darfur have become \r\nperennial issues on the agenda of the Security Council, \r\nwhile growing insecurity — most particularly in \r\nSouthern Sudan — is of mounting concern as we \r\napproach such critical milestones in the North-South \r\nComprehensive Peace Agreement as the 2010 Sudanese \r\nelections and the 2011 referendum on Southern \r\nsecession. A return to civil war in the Sudan must be \r\navoided. \r\n Since 2006, Canada has contributed over \r\n$647 million in support of peace and humanitarian \r\nefforts in the Sudan, including support for the \r\nimplementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement \r\nand for the Darfur peace process. Our support has \r\nincluded partnering with African countries contributing \r\npersonnel to the two Security Council-mandated \r\npeacekeeping missions in the Sudan, namely the \r\nUnited Nations Mission in the Sudan, in southern \r\nSudan, and the African Union-United Nations Hybrid \r\nOperation in Darfur and its predecessor mission, the \r\nAfrican Union Mission in the Sudan. \r\n In the Great Lakes region, Canada views the \r\nresolution of ongoing, complex and interlinked \r\nconflicts as key to building long-term prosperity and \r\ndevelopment. As co-chair, with the Netherlands, of the \r\nGroup of Friends of the Great Lakes Region, Canada \r\nsupports the process of the International Conference on \r\nthe Great Lakes Region in its goal to implement lasting \r\n A/64/PV.23\r\n \r\n3 09-56896 \r\n \r\nsolutions to regional problems of peace, security, \r\nstability and development. \r\n Peace and prosperity in the Great Lakes region \r\ncannot, however, be accomplished without addressing \r\nthe ongoing conflict in the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo, particularly in the eastern region. Canada \r\ncurrently has Canadian officers fulfilling key roles in \r\nthe United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo, and has provided more than $98 million \r\nfor humanitarian and development assistance since \r\n2006. \r\n Canada has been actively involved in efforts to \r\nbring stability and humanitarian assistance to Somalia. \r\nCanada participates in the International Contact Group \r\non Somalia and has provided over $65 million in \r\nhumanitarian assistance since December 2006 to help \r\nrespond to the urgent needs of Somalis and of Somali \r\nrefugees in Kenya. In response to pirate attacks against \r\naid vessels off the coast of eastern Africa, Canada will \r\nonce again be deploying a naval vessel to the region \r\nthis November for a six-month tour of duty. \r\n Africa has achieved much success over the past \r\nfew years. We Canadians join our African partners in \r\ncelebration of this progress. The African continent is a \r\nregion of great promise and potential. Through \r\ncoordinated African-led commitments and partnerships, \r\nthis potential is being realized. Canada will continue to \r\ncontribute to resolving the challenges faced by \r\nAfricans and will do its part in working towards the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals. \r\n Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): The world financial and economic crisis has \r\njeopardized the steady socio-economic development of \r\nthe African continent. Today, as never before, it is \r\nimportant to implement political agreements in support \r\nof Africa achieved both at the United Nations and in \r\nother multilateral forums, including the Group of Eight \r\nand the Group of 20 (G-20). We reaffirm Russia’s \r\ncommitment to implementing international commitments \r\nto assist African countries, in particular in terms of \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals and \r\nimplementing the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD), which are the generally \r\nrecognized frameworks for working with Africa. \r\n At the G-20 Summit, it was decided to \r\nsignificantly increase assistance to the world’s poorest \r\ncountries, the majority of which are African States. We \r\nwill actively help to implement this. Recently, we \r\nconcluded an agreement with the World Bank to \r\ncontribute $50 million to the Rapid Social Response \r\nMulti-Donor Trust Fund Facility. We are considering \r\nadditional opportunities to provide assistance on a \r\nbilateral basis. A good foundation for subsequent \r\naction in support of NEPAD was laid by the political \r\ndeclaration on Africa’s development needs (resolution \r\n63/1), adopted at last year’s high-level plenary meeting \r\non the theme “Africa’s development needs: state of \r\nimplementation of various commitments, challenges \r\nand the way forward”.  \r\n We believe that in the future it will not only be \r\nimportant to focus on providing financial assistance as \r\na means of reacting to the crisis, but also essential to \r\nfocus national and international efforts on ensuring \r\nlong-term economic growth, development of \r\ninfrastructure, and social support to the poorest and \r\nmost vulnerable strata of the population. Priority must \r\nalso be given to programmes encouraging the \r\nparticipation of private capital in infrastructure and \r\nsocial projects.  \r\n Strengthening Russia’s traditional friendly \r\nrelations with African States and broadening \r\nmultifaceted interaction with them remains a foreign \r\npolicy priority for us. Tens of thousands of Africans \r\nhave graduated from educational institutions in our \r\ncountry, and many Russian professionals — including \r\nphysicians, engineers and geologists — have worked \r\nand continue to work in many African countries. \r\nRecently, interaction between Russia and Africa has \r\nregained considerable momentum. The most vivid \r\nproof of this was last June’s visit by President Dmitry \r\nA. Medvedev of the Russian Federation to Africa, \r\nduring which we reaffirmed our commitment to \r\ndeveloping an overall partnership with Africa as well \r\nas with the African Union, subregional organizations \r\nand individual countries in the economic and \r\nhumanitarian areas. \r\n Dealing with socio-economic problems in Africa \r\nis impossible without ensuring lasting peace on the \r\ncontinent. To this end, a proactive stance by Africans \r\nthemselves is essential. It is important to consistently \r\nimplement measures to strengthen harmony; to \r\neliminate illegal armed groups; to broaden cooperation \r\non border security in order to seal borders against \r\nconflict spill-over and trafficking in illegal weapons \r\nand drugs; and to curb violations of the norms of \r\ninternational humanitarian law and put an end to \r\nimpunity for crimes against humanity. \r\nA/64/PV.23  \r\n \r\n09-56896 4 \r\n \r\n We welcome current efforts being made in those \r\nareas by the African community, as we do the vigorous \r\nwork of the African Union Peace and Security Council, \r\nincluding its establishment of an African Standby \r\nForce. It is exceedingly important to continue to work \r\nto develop cooperation between the United Nations \r\nSecurity Council and the African Union Peace and \r\nSecurity Council. \r\n As a permanent member of the Security Council, \r\nRussia makes significant contributions towards \r\ndeveloping a strategy for the international community \r\nas well as practical measures to strengthen peace and \r\nsecurity in the region. We participate in the majority of \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations in Africa. We \r\nhave created opportunities for increasing Russian \r\nassistance to help Africa build its capacity to resolve \r\ncrises, first and foremost by providing additional \r\ntraining in Russia for African peacekeeping troops, \r\nalong with the provision of rear guard and logistical \r\nsupport for African Union peacekeeping operations \r\nauthorized by the Security Council, as well as aviation \r\nand transport services. \r\n Mr. Benmehidi (Algeria) (spoke in French): First \r\nof all, Mr. President, I would like to express my \r\ndelegation’s appreciation for the very illuminating \r\nintroduction with which you opened this debate \r\ndevoted to the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment and the promotion of sustainable \r\neconomic growth and sustainable development. \r\n My delegation fully associates itself with the \r\nstatements delivered by the representatives of the \r\nSudan and Tunisia on behalf of the Group of 77 and \r\nChina and the African Group, respectively. \r\n I should like to thank the Secretary-General for \r\nhis reports on the issue we are addressing today: the \r\nseventh consolidated progress report on implementation \r\nand international support for the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) (A/64/204), the report \r\non the state of implementation of various \r\ncommitments, challenges and the way forward \r\n(A/64/208) and the report on the causes of conflict and \r\nthe promotion of durable peace and sustainable \r\ndevelopment in Africa (A/64/210). Those reports and \r\nthe recommendations they contain serve to remind us \r\nthat Africa has made significant progress since we \r\nbegan to implement NEPAD, which is now an agency \r\nof the African Union. The establishment of this new \r\nmechanism and its incorporation into the Union will \r\nproduce effective complementarity in the Union’s \r\nmissions and efforts as a whole in the common pursuit \r\nof Africa’s development and integration.  \r\n Algeria, which was among the first African \r\ncountries to promote NEPAD, would like once again to \r\nunderscore the importance of this strategic framework \r\nin ensuring the rebirth of the continent. The Partnership \r\nreflects the resolve of African countries to place the \r\ncontinent on the path towards economic and social \r\ndevelopment by taking charge of its own development \r\nefforts.  \r\n The report of the Secretary-General clearly \r\nindicates that, despite every commitment and effort \r\nmade by African countries and their institutions, the \r\nmain problem continues to be the lack of financial \r\nresources. Six years from the deadline established by \r\nthe international community for the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), Africa is the \r\nonly continent still facing major obstacles in its efforts \r\nto combat poverty and need. The ongoing global \r\neconomic and financial crisis, a complex food crisis \r\nand the exacerbation of the negative consequences of \r\nclimate change could potentially undermine the \r\nsignificant progress made in the implementation of \r\nsustainable development programmes, which are of \r\ncrucial importance to the continent.  \r\n Algeria concurs with the Secretary-General on \r\nthe urgent need for action to address the economic and \r\nfinancial crisis. In that regard, international \r\ndevelopment cooperation is essential in the current \r\ninternational environment. My country calls on \r\ninternational development partners, including the \r\nUnited Nations, to act in unison as a matter of urgency \r\nto ameliorate the social and economic effects of the \r\ncrisis and help African countries to get back on track \r\ntowards the implementation of NEPAD and the \r\nachievement of the MDGs. \r\n The international community, in particular \r\ndeveloped countries and international financial \r\ninstitutions, should therefore act to help Africa to make \r\nuse of all of NEPAD’s capacities and all the \r\ncommitments made to put an end to poverty and bolster \r\nsustainable development in the context of the \r\nPartnership as soon as possible, as was called for at the \r\nGleneagles Group of Eight (G-8) Summit. To that end, \r\nofficial development assistance to Africa in 2010 \r\nshould rise to at least $55 billion in 2004 dollars. \r\nSimilarly, the promise made by the G-8 at the meeting \r\n A/64/PV.23\r\n \r\n5 09-56896 \r\n \r\nheld in L’Aquila in July 2009, namely, to provide an \r\nestimated $20 billion in agricultural assistance to \r\nincrease investment in that sector in developing \r\ncountries, and in particular to achieve a green \r\nrevolution in Africa, must be kept.  \r\n Algeria would like to reiterate its appreciation for \r\nthe contributions of numerous partners whose \r\ncommitment and backing, combined with the efforts of \r\nAfrican countries themselves, have made a difference \r\non the ground. That was especially the case with regard \r\nto the determined efforts made in the course of the past \r\ndecade to alleviate the debt of the world’s most heavily \r\nindebted developing countries, especially in Africa. \r\n The willingness of our development partners \r\nsince the 2007 G-8 Summit at Heiligendamm to \r\nrekindle their interest vis-à-vis partnership with Africa \r\nwas clearly a promising development, which we very \r\nmuch appreciate, as it seems to us to herald a genuine \r\nreactivation of that partnership. In that regard, Algeria \r\nwelcomes the decision taken in response to the \r\ncommendable initiative of the Italian presidency of the \r\nG-8 to implement the decision taken at the 2008 \r\nHokkaido Summit to effectively reactivate the \r\nG-8/Group of Five plus three follow-up mechanism, \r\nwhose added value in strengthening partnership \r\nbetween the two parties is beyond question. \r\n In the consensus document they adopted at the \r\nSeptember 2008 high-level meeting on Africa’s \r\ndevelopment needs and the MDGs (resolution 63/1), \r\nheads of State or Government reiterated the importance \r\nthey attach to the continent’s development. They \r\nestablished a framework and identified the steps to be \r\ntaken towards the overall goal of contributing to \r\nAfrica’s development and, in particular, to ensuring the \r\nimplementation of NEPAD programmes. In addition, \r\nthey stressed the importance of cooperation to provide \r\nongoing coordinated support to NEPAD to help African \r\ncountries to mobilize financial resources for the \r\ncontinent’s development. The United Nations system \r\nprovides the clear goals and road map to that end, \r\nwhich we should support. \r\n To that end, we believe that the United Nations \r\nsystem should improve the quality and effectiveness of \r\nits programmes and redouble efforts to increase its \r\noverall assistance to Africa through advocacy efforts \r\nand appropriate financing. We also think that it must of \r\ncourse fully respect the provisions of the political \r\ndeclaration contained in resolution 63/1 related to the \r\nestablishment, before the sixty-fifth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, of a follow-up mechanism with a \r\nmandate to review the implementation of the \r\ncommitments related to Africa’s development.  \r\n My delegation shares the Secretary-General’s \r\nobservation contained in his report on the causes of \r\nconflict and the promotion of durable peace and \r\nsustainable development in Africa. The establishment \r\nof a peaceful environment is an essential element of \r\neconomic and social development. We are pleased to \r\nnote that, despite the difficulties referred to in the \r\nreport, significant progress has been made in the areas \r\nof security, democracy, good governance, capacity-\r\nbuilding and increased cooperation between the \r\nAfrican Union and the United Nations in promoting \r\nhuman rights and eliminating all forms of \r\ndiscrimination against women on the continent. \r\n Mr. Cabral (Guinea-Bissau), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n The African Union, in line with the spirit of its \r\nConstitutive Act, has devoted itself to combating \r\nconflict and political instability in Africa, with a view \r\nto making the continent free of conflict during the year \r\n2010. That goal was underscored in the Tripoli \r\ndeclaration on the elimination of conflict and the \r\npromotion of sustainable development in Africa, which \r\nwas adopted in September 2009. \r\n Algeria is pleased to note the operationalization \r\nof the African Peace and Security Architecture set out \r\nin the protocol establishing the African Union Peace \r\nand Security Council, as well as that of the Panel of the \r\nWise and the putting in place of the key elements of \r\nthe African Standby Force and the Continental Early \r\nWarning System.  \r\n The African Union Peace and Security Council \r\nand the Panel of the Wise continue to play an important \r\nrole in the prevention and resolution of conflicts on the \r\ncontinent. We therefore commend the efforts made by \r\nthe United Nations to cooperate with the African Union \r\nin order to strengthen and improve the Union’s \r\npeacekeeping capacities. \r\n The African Union plays a key role in preventing \r\nand mediating numerous conflicts in Africa, as \r\nreflected in the outstanding results achieved in such \r\ncountries as Burundi, Comoros, the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, Liberia and the Sudan, as well \r\nas in the progress made in the search for peace in other \r\nA/64/PV.23  \r\n \r\n09-56896 6 \r\n \r\ncountries and areas. That progress has sparked hope \r\nand improved prospects for development and rebirth \r\nthat must now be supported by sustained peacebuilding \r\nand post-conflict reconstruction efforts. \r\n The African continent is aware of the need to \r\nstrengthen democratic governance, promote legitimate \r\ninterests and to respect human rights and the rule of \r\nlaw. To that end, I should like to recall that African \r\ncountries have made significant efforts to honour their \r\nNEPAD commitments, including with regard to health, \r\nagriculture, education, information technology, science \r\nand technology and, in particular, with regard to \r\nestablishing the African Peer Review Mechanism, that \r\ntoday comprises 30 African countries, including \r\nAlgeria. That also illustrates that the continent has \r\nmade genuine progress in the areas of good \r\ngovernance, respect for human rights and promoting \r\ndemocracy in an atmosphere of cooperation. That \r\nunderscores how much Africa is committed to \r\nsustainable development, peace and human rights as \r\nthe foundations for progress.  \r\n In conclusion, I would like to reiterate my belief \r\nthat successfully achieving NEPAD’s goals will not be \r\npossible without a plan devised and carried out by \r\nAfrican countries. With the continent’s abundant \r\nnatural and human resources and the commitment of \r\nAfrican leaders to achieve those goals, success is \r\npossible — so long as NEPAD has the unfailing \r\nsupport of the international community. \r\n Mr. Carmon (Israel): I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Assembly for convening this important \r\ndebate. Israel welcomes the Secretary-General’s \r\nseventh consolidated progress report on implementation \r\nand international support for the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) (A/64/204). The \r\nreport examines policy actions taken by the \r\ninternational community to help African countries meet \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and \r\nimplement the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment projects and programmes.  \r\n Today, as the international community addresses \r\ndevelopment in Africa, one of its major challenges, the \r\nworld should examine the achievements and challenges \r\nthat lie ahead. As we strengthen our partnerships in \r\ndevelopment, so too will we become partners in \r\nprosperity. With the stark realities of the financial and \r\neconomic crises, we must reaffirm — in both word and \r\ndeed — our commitment to the MDGs and the \r\nprinciples of development and humanity that gave rise \r\nto today’s debate.  \r\n Israel’s long-standing relationship with the region \r\nbegan after the historic visit of then-Foreign Minister \r\nof Israel, Golda Meir, in 1958, to the young, \r\nindependent States of Africa. Since then, Israel has \r\nsought to build upon those cooperative relationships \r\nacross the continent. Only recently, Foreign Minister \r\nAvigdor Liberman visited a number of African \r\ncountries in order to continue and deepen Israel’s \r\ndedication to development.  \r\n Israel’s international development agency, \r\nMASHAV, lies at the heart of our development efforts \r\nin Africa. Founded as a modest programme focused on \r\ngrass-roots-level human capacity-building in Africa \r\nonly a decade after Israel’s inception, MASHAV has \r\nblossomed into an extensive programme that promotes \r\nsustainable development, food production, public \r\nhealth programmes and equality throughout the \r\ndeveloping world, in particular on the African \r\ncontinent. In addition to bilateral country cooperation, \r\nMASHAV is developing new and innovative \r\npartnerships. Last year, MASHAV signed, among other \r\nthings, a memorandum of understanding with the \r\nUnited Nations Development Programme in Africa, as \r\nwell as an agreement with the United Nations Food and \r\nAgriculture Organization. Those agreements are \r\nintegrating the work of MASHAV into the context of \r\nAfrican development. \r\n Combating HIV/AIDS must continue to be a high \r\nglobal priority. On this matter, Israel has built and \r\nmaintained cooperation with the Joint United Nations \r\nProgramme on HIV/AIDS, UNICEF, civil society \r\npartners in African countries and private organizations. \r\nIn this context, Israel will organize a multi-disciplinary \r\ntraining programme on HIV antiretroviral therapy for \r\ndoctors, nurses and technicians from African countries \r\nthat will take place in January. While such programmes \r\nbring doctors from Africa to Israel, others send teams \r\nof specially trained Israeli health professionals and \r\nvolunteers to work with orphaned HIV-positive \r\nchildren through the use of support programmes and \r\ncommunity-based initiatives. \r\n Another area of emphasis in the field of health is \r\nprenatal and neonatal care. The Tipat Chalav \r\nconcept — which appropriately means “drop of milk” \r\nin Hebrew — offers community-based prenatal and \r\nhealthy-baby clinics. The Tipat Chalav model is \r\n A/64/PV.23\r\n \r\n7 09-56896 \r\n \r\ncurrently being implemented in Kumasi, Ghana, and \r\nwill have a dramatic impact on rates of infant \r\nmortality. \r\n Social development is another key aspect of \r\ntoday’s debate. To further enhance such work, this year \r\nIsrael will assume the chair of the Commission on \r\nPopulation and Development. In this context, \r\nMASHAV programmes address the connections among \r\ngender, poverty reduction and sustainable development, \r\nas well as the need for gender-sensitive policymaking. \r\n Harnessing agricultural technology has the power \r\nto transform development and hasten growth. In \r\nIsrael’s case, despite environmental and climatic \r\nchallenges, we succeeded in making the most unlikely \r\nenvironments — notably the desert — bloom. \r\nTechnology sharing in this field, along with increased \r\ninternational cooperation, will facilitate greater \r\nsustainable development on the African continent. One \r\nof Israel’s hallmark projects is the promotion of \r\nsustainable agriculture through the widespread use of \r\nlow-pressure irrigation systems that enable small \r\nfarmers to establish individual market gardens with \r\ntheir own water-rationing facilities. The project is part \r\nof the Techno-agricultural Innovation for Poverty \r\nAlleviation programmes. Such efforts also offer better \r\nfood security to often vulnerable populations. \r\n In the area of desertification, Israel has given \r\nspecial emphasis to developing programmes in Africa \r\nin accordance with the United Nations Convention to \r\nCombat Desertification, including initiatives aimed at \r\ndryland development. In coordination with the relevant \r\nagricultural and environmental ministries in many \r\nAfrican States, we offer our perspective on managing \r\ndrought, entrepreneurship and livelihoods in desert \r\nconditions, as well as soil degradation, among other \r\nrelevant issues. For this reason, Israel is actively \r\ninvolved in the work of the Commission on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (CSD) and endorsed the recommendations \r\nof the seventeenth CSD policy session in 2009, the \r\nCSD-17 initiative, “Realizing a Green Revolution in \r\nAfrica”. \r\n Israel welcomes the Secretary-General’s report \r\nentitled “Agricultural technology for development” \r\n(A/64/258). This year, we are proud to present a \r\nfollow-up draft resolution to resolution 62/190 on \r\nagricultural technology for development. We will work \r\nto achieve consensus on this important resolution with \r\nthe productive and positive engagement of as many \r\nStates as possible, and with the clear view that Africa \r\nwill be the main beneficiary of such a resolution. \r\n In conclusion, I wish to reiterate my country’s \r\ncommitment to the ideals enshrined in today’s debate \r\nand to reaffirm that we will continue to do our part to \r\ncontribute to the global human family. \r\n Mr. Balé (Congo) (spoke in French): My \r\ndelegation joins in supporting the worthy statement \r\nmade this morning by the representative of Tunisia on \r\nbehalf of the African Group, and we associate \r\nourselves with the statement made by the delegation of \r\nthe Sudan, on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, on \r\nagenda items 63 (a) and (b). \r\n The Republic of the Congo, being one of the \r\ncountries where malaria is the most severe, would like \r\nto focus its statement on agenda item 47, concerning \r\nthe Decade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing \r\nCountries, Particularly in Africa (A/64/302). First of \r\nall, I would like to thank the President of the Assembly \r\nfor calling this meeting on that subject. I also take this \r\noccasion to express my thanks to the Secretary-General \r\nfor having made the report available to Member States. \r\n My delegation has no doubt that the World Health \r\nOrganization’s 2009 World Malaria Report, to be \r\npublished at the end of this month, will shed light on \r\nthe spread of this terrible affliction and will permit all \r\npartners to better appreciate the efforts being made to \r\nfight malaria, as well as their impact on health through \r\nthe end of 2008. \r\n In 2000, heads of State and Government in Africa \r\nmade commitments to roll back malaria. They set noble \r\ngoals, including achieving 80 per cent coverage in four \r\nwell-defined areas of intervention, with the corollary of \r\na reduction of at least 50 per cent in malaria cases and \r\nmortality between 2000 and 2010, and of at least \r\n75 per cent between 2000 and 2015. The Global \r\nMalaria Action Plan took on those same objectives, \r\ngiving them a global dimension. \r\n Information from last year described an increase \r\nin coverage in Africa and around the world. It \r\nconfirmed the impact of combating malaria with \r\nincreased intervention measures in countries that had \r\nhad low to moderate malaria rates. Today, as the 2010 \r\ndeadline approaches, despite the tremendous progress \r\nthat has been made in combating this scourge, areas of \r\nconcern remain. These include, in particular, resistance \r\nA/64/PV.23  \r\n \r\n09-56896 8 \r\n \r\nto artemisinin monotherapy, insufficient funding, and \r\nweakness in purchasing and supply chains. \r\n Malaria affects more than a hundred countries \r\nthroughout the world. It is the premier cause of \r\nmortality and morbidity, especially in Africa, where the \r\ndisease kills over a million people every year. \r\nMoreover, each year it costs the continent more than \r\n$12 billion and slows its economic growth by 1.3 per \r\ncent. The Republic of the Congo, as I said before, is \r\none of the countries of Africa where malaria is most \r\nendemic. The health situation shows a rate of \r\nprevalence for malaria of 5.6 per cent, compared with \r\nthe rates for tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS, which are \r\n0.4 per cent and 4.2 per cent, respectively. \r\n As we study those disturbing statistics, the urgent \r\nneed for coming up with innovative, better adapted \r\nstrategies for fighting malaria in order to contribute to \r\nthe well-being of individuals and communities \r\nbecomes clear. Women and children are the most \r\nvulnerable targets of all and should be at the heart of \r\nsuch strategies. As a stakeholder in the Abuja \r\nDeclaration and a member of the International Drug \r\nPurchase Facility initiative to help developing \r\ncountries access treatment for HIV/AIDS, malaria and \r\ntuberculosis, my country has made the fight against \r\nmalaria one of its national priorities within the \r\nreference frameworks for action based on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). The Strategy \r\nDocument on Poverty Reduction and the National \r\nHealth Development Plan, implemented through the \r\nHealth Services Development Programme, as well as \r\nthe private sector Medium-Term Financing Framework, \r\nconstitute the main pillars of our national strategy. \r\n As to the implementation of our national plan to \r\ncombat malaria, the Government has taken a number of \r\nsteps, of which the most significant was the free \r\ndistribution of more than half a million insecticide-\r\ntreated mosquito nets in October 2007. More recently, \r\nthe Government instituted last September mother-and-\r\nchild weeks dedicated to providing vaccination, \r\nvitamin A supplements, parasite treatment and the \r\ndistribution of 470,000 insecticide-treated nets. Since \r\nDecember 2007, the Republic of Congo has invested \r\nmajor resources in ensuring free antimalarial treatment \r\nfor children up to 15 years of age and their mothers. \r\nWe are pleased to note that this free treatment, which \r\nhas so far been used in 1,764,504 cases of simple \r\nmalaria — almost a third of the population — has \r\nreached 100 per cent of our health units. This \r\nlifesaving experiment will be gradually extended to \r\nmore serious cases of malaria and will be part of the \r\neffort to ensure universal access to medication. \r\n For the Republic of Congo, universal access to \r\nmedication, especially to the most vulnerable \r\npopulations, remains a key element in the fight against \r\nmalaria. With respect to its actions against this scourge, \r\nthe Government has established a central purchasing \r\nagency for buying and supplying health units with \r\nessential generic medications and expanding free \r\nantimalarial treatment beyond those under 15 years of \r\nage to all age levels of the population. However, \r\nuniversal access to medications alone cannot help us \r\nroll back malaria and lead to the ultimate solution we \r\nall hope for — its eradication, pure and simple. In spite \r\nof the Government’s ongoing efforts, the fight against \r\nmalaria in the Republic of Congo still faces challenges \r\nthat the national authorities are committed to \r\naddressing. \r\n We need more vigorous promotion of a public \r\nawareness campaign on using treated mosquito nets. \r\nGaps in preventive treatment coverage and the practice \r\nof indoor insecticide spraying, as well as insufficient \r\nuse of labs and rapid diagnostic tests, are also areas \r\nthat health authorities will need to tackle more \r\nvigorously in future. Finally, training health personnel \r\nin the correct treatment of malaria is still lacking and is \r\na priority, particularly in capacity-building, both \r\nnationally and in the competent subregional bodies. \r\n Given this urgency, and the scope of the financial \r\neffort required, the commitment of the State is not \r\nenough to encompass the extent of the response needed \r\nto deal with this disease. The Government therefore \r\nintends to develop a partnership with the private sector, \r\nparticularly as regards prevention. A scourge like \r\nmalaria obviously demands more significant action and \r\nresources, nationally and globally, if we are to reach \r\nour goals. According to the report before us, almost \r\ntwo thirds of the funding allocated to combat malaria \r\nwill go to Africa, which has about 90 per cent of the \r\nworld’s deaths due to the disease. The same source \r\nindicates that $5 billion is needed to achieve the goals \r\nset by Roll Back Malaria and the MDGs. At the same \r\ntime, we fear that the context of the global economic \r\nand financial crisis may negatively affect the financing \r\nof antimalaria programmes and, furthermore, might \r\ncompromise progress already made. The effective \r\ncontrol of malaria requires interventions on a greater \r\nscale, predictable and sustainable financing, and better \r\n A/64/PV.23\r\n \r\n9 09-56896 \r\n \r\nparticipation by the communities dealing with the \r\ndisease, as well as strengthened partnerships on the \r\nglobal, regional and national levels. \r\n My delegation, which has always supported \r\ninitiatives to roll back malaria, fully supports the \r\nrecommendations in the Secretary-General’s report and \r\ncalls for their positive consideration. This is also the \r\nmoment to say how grateful we are to our bilateral and \r\nmultilateral partners involved in this common cause, \r\nand to ask them not to abandon their commitments — \r\nparticularly in difficult periods such as this when \r\nmultiple crises throughout the world threaten to devour \r\nour financial resources — in order that our campaign’s \r\ngoals will be achieved on time. The Congolese \r\ndelegation would like to welcome from this rostrum the \r\ncreation of the Alliance of African Leaders against \r\nMalaria, launched on 23 September 2009 on the \r\nsidelines of the General Assembly. This initiative \r\nshows African leaders’ willingness to stand on the front \r\nline of the fight against this scourge. \r\n In conclusion, my delegation would like to \r\nexpress at this time its support for a draft resolution on \r\nthe establishment of a global fund in support of the \r\nfight against malaria, initiated by the delegation of \r\nTanzania. It renews the call for a broader, stronger \r\nmobilization against this disaster, whose devastating \r\nconsequences call for more active and dynamic \r\nsolidarity on the part of the international community. \r\n Mrs. Waffa-Ogoo (Gambia): The Gambia \r\nassociates itself with the statements made during this \r\ndebate by Tunisia and Sudan on behalf of the African \r\nGroup and the Group of 77, respectively. In my turn I \r\nwould like to thank the Secretary-General for his \r\ncomprehensive reports on the items under discussion. \r\n This statement will speak to the progress of the \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) in \r\nits implementation and in international support, as well \r\nas the Decade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing \r\nCountries, Particularly in Africa. \r\n NEPAD is the blueprint in which the African \r\nleadership articulates its broad vision and takes \r\nownership of the holistic development of the continent. \r\nIt offers a new, vigorous impulse for our leaders to pull \r\nAfrica out of stagnation. In his reports, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has highlighted progress made in many of the \r\nNEPAD priority areas, such as infrastructure, \r\nagriculture, health, education, information and \r\ncommunications technology, the environment, and \r\ngender equality and women’s empowerment, including \r\nthe response of the international community in support \r\nof NEPAD. \r\n Prior to the onslaught of the multiple crises of the \r\nlast few years, African Governments had gained \r\nconsiderable momentum in terms of socio-economic \r\ndevelopment, as demonstrated by strong economic \r\ngrowth rates in many countries, improved governance \r\nand better policy performance. It is indeed ironic that a \r\ncontinent that possesses sufficient natural resources, \r\nincluding large areas of arable land with diverse \r\nagro-ecologic conditions, still finds more than half of \r\nits population affected by hunger, particularly in \r\nsub-Saharan Africa. \r\n African agriculture is in crisis, leaving millions \r\nof people malnourished. The natural resource \r\nendowments of the continent seem, in most cases, to be \r\na curse, rather than a blessing. Against this \r\nbackground, the Gambia calls on the international \r\ncommunity to ensure that the resource gap between \r\nAfrica and the rest of the world is closed. We call for a \r\nreversal of the competitive advantages given to the \r\nagricultural industries of industrialized countries in the \r\nform of subsidies, and support the Secretary-General’s \r\ncall for the long-overdue conclusion of the Doha \r\nRound of multilateral trade negotiations with an \r\noutcome that encompasses a development dimension. \r\n The commitment made by the World Bank, \r\nthrough the Africa Action Plan, to develop the African \r\nprivate sector, create jobs, enhance exports, expand \r\ninfrastructure, raise agricultural productivity and \r\nstrengthen human development is highly encouraging. \r\nWe therefore call on our partners to continue to invest \r\nin infrastructure in order to break down the barriers \r\nthat hold Africa back. Investment in infrastructure — a \r\nprecondition for economic growth — is critical to \r\nAfrica’s sustainable development agenda. \r\n Food insecurity, desertification, land degradation \r\nand climate change must be halted and reversed \r\nthrough financial support and technology transfer. The \r\ninternational community needs to increase investment \r\nin the productive sectors of African economies — and \r\nnot just in the extractive industries — to allow for \r\nrapid economic growth. In this same manner, the \r\nprivate sector in developed countries, as well as in the \r\ncountries of the South, must be encouraged to take an \r\nactive role in promoting closer economic ties with \r\nAfrican countries for mutual benefit, as well as in the \r\nA/64/PV.23  \r\n \r\n09-56896 10 \r\n \r\ndevelopment of small- and medium-sized enterprises \r\n(SME). SME development is critical to the generation \r\nof economic activity and to long-term sustainability. \r\nGiven the continued role it can play in the development \r\nprocess, due attention must be devoted to fostering \r\nSME in order to encourage entrepreneurship and \r\nenterprise development in our countries. In developing \r\ncountries, SME accounts for approximately three \r\nquarters of GDP and just over 60 per cent of \r\nemployment creation. \r\n Due note has been taken of the positive \r\nimplementation of the human resource development of \r\nnurses and midwives — as highlighted in the report of \r\nthe Secretary-General — through postgraduate \r\nprogrammes, with a view to enhancing their \r\nprofessional skills. However, given the dire impact of \r\nthe brain drain — in the health sector in particular — a \r\nmechanism must be found to halt and reverse the mass \r\nexodus of highly trained personnel from African \r\ncountries to developed countries in search of greener \r\npastures. \r\n We therefore welcome the progress that has been \r\nmade in the implementation of the NEPAD/Spanish \r\nFund for African Women Empowerment, which \r\npromotes gender equality and women’s entitlement by \r\nproviding them with the means to unlock their \r\neconomic potential, fight poverty and develop small- \r\nand medium-sized enterprises, among other things. \r\n Malaria inflicts a heavy economic burden on \r\nAfrica as a whole, and on sub-Saharan Africa in \r\nparticular, draining the wealth of its nations and \r\nhouseholds. According to the World Health \r\nOrganization (WHO), malaria costs Africa $12 billion \r\nevery year. A poor household can spend up to 34 per \r\ncent of its total income on fighting malaria. This state \r\nof affairs is not sustainable. However, the Roll Back \r\nMalaria Global Strategic Plan 2000-2015 has \r\ndemonstrated that this trend could be reversed. When \r\nthe Roll Back Malaria Partnership was established, \r\ndeaths caused by malaria, particularly in Africa, were \r\nat unprecedented levels, and malaria was the \r\n“Cinderella of diseases”, receiving little attention from \r\nthe international community. \r\n Without doubt, the past few years have been \r\ncharacterized by success in the malaria sector, both as \r\nit concerns Roll Back Malaria partners and the \r\nPartnership as a whole. The campaign gained further \r\nmomentum, new partners joined the effort, significant \r\nresources were mobilized and ambitious goals and \r\nplans set. Fresh tools to prevent and treat the \r\ndevastating disease are now available and efforts are \r\nbeing made to make these affordable, though there is \r\nneed for additional resources to accelerate treatment. \r\n Some 108 countries are now free of malaria, and \r\nmore countries in Africa have registered significant \r\nsuccess in the fight against the disease, having attained \r\nWHO morbidity and mortality targets. However, we \r\nmust heed the warning not to underestimate the \r\nproblem or overstate the successes. Our leaders have \r\nbeen fully engaged in the fight against malaria. The \r\nAbuja Declaration to Roll Back Malaria in Africa, the \r\nrecently launched African Leaders Malaria Alliance \r\nand the heroic steps being made towards the \r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals \r\nrelating to health are clear testimony of their resolve \r\nand commitment. In spite of these efforts, much more \r\nremains to be done. \r\n Notwithstanding my previous remarks, the global \r\nfinancial and economic crisis is expected, in all \r\nlikelihood, to put pressure on resources and threaten \r\nthe attainment of the ambitious goals of universal \r\ncoverage by 2010 and zero deaths by 2015. This will \r\nrequire strong progress at the country level, especially \r\nin sub-Saharan Africa. We therefore urge the \r\nPartnership and the international community as a \r\nwhole to make special efforts to assist countries that do \r\nnot yet have well-mobilized and well-supported \r\npartnerships on track to help them meet their targets. \r\nMore emphasis should be placed on at-risk groups such \r\nas children and pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa. \r\n In conclusion, the Gambia wishes to place on \r\nrecord its appreciation for the concerted efforts made \r\nin the fight against malaria by the international \r\ncommunity through the work of organizations such as \r\nthe Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and \r\nMalaria, the Malaria Initiative of the President of the \r\nUnited States, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, \r\nthe World Bank and the International Drug Purchase \r\nFacility. We call on all concerned to redouble their \r\nefforts to bring about the total eradication of the \r\ndisease by 2015. \r\n Mr. Faqeeh (Saudi Arabia) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nThe delegation of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia would \r\nlike to extend its thanks to the President of the General \r\nAssembly and the Secretary-General for their efforts in \r\nconvening this meeting on agenda items 63 (a) and (b) \r\n A/64/PV.23\r\n \r\n11 09-56896 \r\n \r\nand 47, concerning the development of Africa and the \r\nDecade to Roll Back Malaria in the Developing \r\nCountries, Particularly if Africa. Supporting \r\ndevelopment, both regionally and internationally, is \r\none of the most important goals of the Kingdom. \r\n The invitation by the Secretary-General to \r\nachieve development in Africa comes as the world \r\nfaces a set of difficult circumstances, including the \r\neconomic crisis which is directly affecting the \r\neconomies of African States and development in their \r\ncontinent. For so long now, the African continent has \r\nsuffered from socio-economic problems such as \r\npoverty, unemployment and poor health care, all of \r\nwhich calls for joint action to achieve development and \r\nend the suffering of the peoples of those States. \r\n The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia contributes \r\nannually to such development programmes as the \r\nAfrican Development Bank (ADB), to which it has \r\ncontributed $25 million. That contribution will be \r\ndrawn on over five years. The Kingdom is a member \r\nState of the ADB Group and is among the States \r\nsupporting the African Development Fund and the Arab \r\nBank for Economic Development in Africa. The \r\nKingdom has doubled its contributions to renew the \r\nresources of the International Fund for Agricultural \r\nDevelopment in the amount of $50 million.  \r\n In the field of combating AIDS, tuberculosis and \r\nmalaria, the Kingdom has announced a 2008-2010 \r\ncontribution of $18 million to the Global Fund to Fight \r\nAIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria — $6 million per \r\nyear; $10 million has already been paid to the Fund.  \r\n Although Saudi Arabia is a developing country \r\nthat is witnessing considerable population growth with \r\nthe attendant increasing financial requirements to cover \r\nits human development, basic infrastructure and \r\ncapacity-building, it supports and assists other, needier \r\ncountries in a manner that far exceeds the \r\ninternationally suggested ratios.  \r\n Reports issued by the Office for the Coordination \r\nof Humanitarian Affairs state that Saudi Arabia was in \r\nthe forefront of countries contributing to humanitarian \r\nrelief operations in 2008. It contributed $1 billion to \r\nthe Islamic Solidarity Fund for Development and has \r\nmade contributions to 18 other financial and \r\ninternational institutions. It has also extended \r\nconcessional loans and unreimbursable assistance \r\namounting $100 billion, from which 95 developing \r\nStates have benefited. This represents 4 per cent of the \r\nKingdom’s gross national product, a ratio far higher \r\nthan the United Nations target. \r\n Proceeding from the interest of the Servant of the \r\nTwo Holy Shrines to spread education as widely as \r\npossible, Saudi Arabia is earmarking $500 million for \r\neducation projects in developing countries. In the field \r\nof debt relief, the Kingdom has forgiven more than \r\n$6 billion owed to it by poor countries. It has also \r\ncontributed its full share to the International Monetary \r\nFund debt relief fund. Once again, we call upon the \r\nindustrial countries to fulfil their obligations, in the \r\nform of direct assistance or relief on debts owed to \r\nthem by the needier States, or by opening their markets \r\nto developing country exports without unjustifiable \r\nrestrictions.  \r\n The effective role undertaken by the Kingdom of \r\nSaudi Arabia through its direct presence and its \r\neffective initiatives in the field of humanitarian and \r\nrelief work in areas affected by natural and \r\nenvironmental disasters worldwide makes it one of the \r\nStates providing the most relief to the disadvantaged \r\nand the afflicted. It has carried out concrete relief \r\nprojects for many States hit by war and disaster. The \r\nKingdom is always responsive to the issues and crises \r\nof the world in support of the disadvantaged anywhere \r\nand at any time.  \r\n In this context, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia \r\ntakes geographical diversity into consideration in the \r\ndistribution of such assistance, which has reached a \r\ngreat number of States in many parts of the developing \r\nworld. By the end of 2008, the Saudi Fund for \r\nDevelopment had extended concessional loans to \r\nfinance 73 economic and development projects in \r\ndeveloping countries, 42 of which are in Africa. Saudi \r\nArabia is one of the principal contributors to the OPEC \r\nFund for International Development to finance projects \r\nin 48 States in Africa, including projects related to \r\nagriculture, industry, education, energy, health care, \r\npotable water, communications and transportation. We \r\nalso contribute to the regional and international funds \r\nthat channel most concessional loans to Africa. \r\n In conclusion, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is \r\neager to support the efforts of NEPAD and to meet its \r\ninternational obligations towards the African continent, \r\nin order to achieve lasting peace and sustainable \r\ndevelopment there. \r\n Mr. Christian (Ghana): At the outset, I would \r\nlike to commend the Secretary-General for his in-depth \r\nA/64/PV.23  \r\n \r\n09-56896 12 \r\n \r\nreview of the current situation in Africa. Ghana aligns \r\nitself with the statements delivered by the \r\nrepresentatives of the Sudan and Tunisia on behalf of \r\nthe Group of African States and the Group of 77 and \r\nChina, respectively.  \r\n It is a matter of great concern to my delegation \r\nthat the very modest and hard-earned progress of the \r\npast few years is being severely undermined by a \r\ncombination of internal factors and external forces. \r\nThe ongoing financial and economic crisis coupled \r\nwith high food and energy prices and chronic \r\nshortages, as well as climate change, have all had a \r\nvery negative impact on economic growth, agricultural \r\ndevelopment, poverty eradication and overall human \r\ndevelopment. \r\n No doubt, these trends have thrown into doubt the \r\nnoble aspirations of the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) and the high hopes for an \r\nAfrican renaissance that greeted the programme in \r\nAfrica and beyond when it was first launched by \r\nAfrican leaders in July 2001 and formally endorsed by \r\nthe General Assembly in September 2002 (see \r\nresolution 57/2).  \r\n Africa cannot afford another lost decade. The \r\nstakes are just too high. We already have a consensus \r\non the path forward. That has been clearly set out in \r\nthe internationally agreed development goals, \r\nincluding the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nTherefore, we must move quickly and urgently to fulfil \r\nall outstanding commitments especially in the areas of \r\nsustainable economic growth, human development, \r\ngovernance and security, official development \r\nassistance, debt relief, trade liberalization and aid for \r\ntrade. \r\n There is ample evidence that whenever African \r\nleaders and their development partners have acted with \r\ndetermination and common purpose the results have \r\nbeen outstanding. There are now fewer civil wars and \r\nmore democratic countries than ever before. Let me \r\nhasten to add that even one civil war is a war too many, \r\nas it costs lives, brings about displacement, the \r\ndestruction of property and lost opportunities for \r\ndevelopment — all of which exacerbate human misery. \r\nNonetheless, in general terms, we have been greatly \r\nencouraged by the real progress in economic growth \r\nand private sector development, primary education, \r\nwomen’s rights and the fight against poverty and \r\ndiseases. \r\n No less significant is the steady progress towards \r\ngreater accountability and better economic \r\nmanagement. To date, 29 countries have voluntarily \r\nacceded to NEPAD’s African Peer Review Mechanism, \r\nand 15 have already launched reviews. The growing \r\nrole of civil society in many countries is also a great \r\nsign of progress, and citizens are increasingly holding \r\nGovernments accountable for their actions. \r\n There have also been some positive developments \r\nin Africa’s health sector. Heads of State or Government \r\nendorsed the Africa Health Strategy for the period \r\n2007-2015, which aims to strengthen the quality and \r\ncoverage of the continent’s health systems. The World \r\nHealth Organization has launched an effort to \r\nmaximize positive synergies between global health \r\ninitiatives, such as the Global Alliance for Vaccines \r\nand Immunization and national health systems. \r\n Many African countries have significantly \r\nreduced their AIDS prevalence rates, and a growing \r\nnumber of Africans living with the virus are \r\nundergoing antiretroviral treatment. Two thirds of \r\nAfrican countries have adopted policies that include \r\nthe use of drugs that are effective against malaria. \r\nEthiopia, Rwanda, Tanzania and Zambia have achieved \r\nparticularly impressive reductions in malaria-related \r\nmortalities. \r\n We believe we can still build on those positive \r\ntrends towards less conflict, more democracy and \r\ngreater development if we continue to cooperate and \r\nact with a common purpose. At the same time, we \r\naccept the fact that, ultimately, the responsibility for \r\ndriving progress rests with African leaders. Their task \r\nis not easy, given capacity constraints and the many \r\nchallenges they face. \r\n What Africa seeks, above all, is partnership and \r\nmutual accountability, whether in governmental or \r\ncorporate endeavours. Donors must honour their \r\ncommitments; trading partners and corporations must \r\nhonour their social responsibilities, respect human \r\nrights and ensure environmental standards. \r\n With the right support, Africa can also contribute \r\nsolutions to global problems. Its vast human and \r\neconomic potential, natural resources and sources of \r\nclean energy offer highly attractive investment \r\nopportunities that can be exploited to benefit, not just \r\nAfrica, but also the rest of the world. If that is to be \r\nachieved, Africa needs a stronger voice on the \r\ninternational stage, in the multilateral architecture and \r\n A/64/PV.23\r\n \r\n13 09-56896 \r\n \r\nin key decision-making forums — whether the Group \r\nof Eight (G-8), the Group of 20 or trade or climate \r\nchange negotiations — in order to attract the political, \r\nfinancial and technical support required. \r\n Enormous challenges remain in several key \r\nsectors. Africa’s health systems remain underfunded, \r\nunderstaffed and ill equipped. Africa also continues to \r\nhave the largest number of armed conflicts, and \r\napproximately one fifth of the continent’s population \r\nstill lives in conflict zones. But there have been a \r\nnumber of positive developments over the past few \r\nyears.  \r\n The availability of infrastructure is critical to the \r\ndevelopment of Africa’s private sector, including a \r\nreliable supply of energy and safe roads to connect \r\nfarmers to markets. Strategies to respond to those \r\nneeds should be developed in parallel with efforts in \r\nthe field of water access and sanitation. Infrastructure \r\nis currently a key constraint on Africa’s enterprise \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Africa has enormous potential for energy \r\nproduction from renewable sources — solar, hydro, \r\nwind, nuclear and geothermal. Almost all sub-Saharan \r\nAfrican countries have sufficient renewable resources \r\nthat can be exploited with modern technologies to \r\nsatisfy current energy demand. Studies show that daily \r\naverage solar radiation levels in Africa are very high, \r\nand the continent could be the world’s future solar \r\nsuper-power. \r\n The potential for development in Africa’s real \r\neconomy is huge, particularly in the infrastructure, \r\nrenewable energy, agriculture and telecommunications \r\nsectors. Greater investment in those sectors would \r\ncreate not only jobs in Africa, but also markets for \r\ndeveloped countries. Africa can provide a valuable \r\ngrowth platform for the global economy and pioneer \r\nclean development models that contribute to global \r\nefforts to manage climate change. \r\n It is encouraging that a number of developed \r\ncountries — including the members of the G-8 — have, \r\nin recent times, emphasized the urgency of concluding \r\nthe Doha Development Round. While pressing for the \r\nconclusion of the Doha Round, it is critical that we \r\nrethink trade policy in order to boost agricultural \r\nproduction around the world. Policies for fertilizer \r\nmarkets should provide the response needed to address \r\nshortages in food production, while policies on grain \r\nstorage and buffer stocks must also be taken seriously. \r\nPromises on aid for trade must be honoured.  \r\n The unique development experiences of emerging \r\neconomies, such as those of China, Brazil and India, \r\nare relevant to the situation of African countries and \r\nshould serve as a model for international cooperation if \r\nthe continent is to realize its full potential for sustained \r\neconomic growth and accelerated development. \r\n Mr. Loulichki (Morocco) (spoke in French): My \r\ndelegation is pleased to participate in this debate on \r\nissues related to development in Africa in the light of \r\nthe excellent reports submitted by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. Those reports paint a clear picture of the \r\nchallenges facing our continent and contain \r\nrecommendations on ways likely to help Africa find its \r\nway back to the path of peace and development. \r\n In addition to associating itself with the \r\nstatements made by the representative of the Sudan on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China and by the \r\nrepresentative of Tunisia on behalf of the Group of \r\nAfrican States, my delegation would like to share the \r\nfollowing comments with the Assembly.  \r\n Data published by various international \r\ninstitutions show that Africa is the continent most \r\naffected by the successive food and energy crises and, \r\nmost recently, the financial crisis, which swiftly \r\nbecame an economic crisis. Those crises arose at a time \r\nwhen African countries had been engaged in bold \r\npolitical and economic reform efforts that had allowed \r\nthe continent to make significant progress towards \r\nattaining its objectives both in terms of development \r\nand in such areas as democracy, human rights \r\nprotection and the implementation of sustainable \r\neconomic policies.  \r\n The economic forecasts for Africa predicting a \r\n2009 growth rate of less than 3 per cent — perhaps \r\neven 2 per cent — remain much lower than the \r\n7 per cent annual rate considered necessary for the \r\ncontinent to achieve the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) by the 2015 deadline. In addition, over \r\nthe past few years, despite the changes in the \r\ninternational economic context — which has, \r\nunfortunately, become very unfavourable — African \r\ncountries have continued and even stepped up their \r\nefforts to improve the well-being of their populations. \r\nUnfortunately, those sincere and committed efforts by \r\nAfrican countries have not been supported as they \r\nA/64/PV.23  \r\n \r\n09-56896 14 \r\n \r\nshould have been and have suffered from a lack of the \r\nsubstantial resources needed for their success.  \r\n It is becoming increasingly clear that the \r\ncombined effects of successive crises have made \r\nimplementing the MDGs on our African continent \r\nmore difficult by slowing the pace of their achievement \r\nas 2015 approaches. Thus, millions of people living in \r\nAfrica could sink into poverty and destitution.  \r\n In the area of health, despite the progress made \r\nthanks to the efforts of African countries and their \r\ndevelopment partners, HIV/AIDS and malaria remain \r\nmajor challenges for the continent that could \r\nundermine its development process. The recent crises \r\nand their effects on African economies have only \r\naggravated their health and social situation, thereby \r\nfurther reducing the chances that the health-related \r\nMDGs will be achieved. \r\n Even the official development assistance \r\nprovided to Africa before the crisis was mostly below \r\nthe $70 billion per year considered necessary for the \r\ncontinent to attain its development objectives. We hope \r\nthat the renewal by the Group of 20 and the Group of \r\nEight of their commitments regarding Africa will be \r\ndiligently and fully implemented. At the same time, if \r\nthe African continent is to assume ownership over its \r\ndevelopment process, it is also necessary to help \r\nAfrican countries establish an atmosphere conducive to \r\nforeign direct investment so that they can address weak \r\ninfrastructures, which continue to heavily overshadow \r\nAfrica’s attractiveness in terms of investment.  \r\n As economic and social development depends on \r\nconflict settlement and peacebuilding, the Kingdom of \r\nMorocco welcomes our continent’s increasingly \r\nsteadfast commitment to promoting the settlement of \r\npersistent conflicts. My country continues to provide \r\nassistance on several fronts, in particular through its \r\nparticipation in United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations deployed in Africa and in the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission. \r\n Morocco has always been convinced of the \r\nadvantages and merits of South-South cooperation in \r\npromoting the social and economic development of our \r\ncontinent. Of course, that in no way detracts from the \r\nvaluable contribution of North-South cooperation. In \r\nline with that conviction, my country has always \r\nworked, under the vision of His Majesty King \r\nMohammed VI, to strengthen partnership ties with its \r\nAfrican family in the context of fruitful and mutually \r\nbeneficial South-South cooperation, based on human \r\ndevelopment and experience sharing.  \r\n As evidence of that commitment, Morocco has \r\ninitiated several partnership and cooperation \r\nprogrammes with African countries in areas as diverse \r\nas infrastructure, agriculture, health, education, \r\ntransport, telecommunications and the training and \r\ndevelopment of African management abilities. Also as \r\nproof of its solidarity, in particular with Africa’s least \r\ndeveloped countries, my country took the initiative a \r\nfew years ago to cancel their bilateral debt to grant \r\nthem quota- and duty-free access to the Moroccan \r\nmarket. \r\n Africa remains among the continents suffering \r\nmost from the negative effects of climate change. In \r\nfact, our continent is threatened today more than ever \r\nby rising sea levels, which could affect 30 per cent of \r\nits coastal infrastructure. The increase in average \r\ntemperatures in Africa, consecutive droughts and \r\nscarce precipitation could pose a huge threat to African \r\nagriculture, which accounts for exactly 55 per cent of \r\nall exports and which feeds 70 per cent of the African \r\npopulation. In that context, the results of the \r\nCopenhagen negotiations on climate change must take \r\ndue consideration of the concerns of our continent, not \r\nonly in terms of economic growth, but also in terms of \r\nhuman and social development, resource mobilization \r\nand technology transfer. \r\n The African continent also continues to draw \r\nleast benefits from international exchanges. African \r\ncountries still encounter difficulties in participating \r\neffectively in international trade, despite the efforts \r\nthat they have agreed to in order to open up their \r\neconomies and to implement freer trade. The \r\nconclusion of the World Trade Organization \r\nnegotiations in the Doha Round, which, let us be clear, \r\nis described as a development round, should be \r\naccomplished in such a way that it takes into \r\nconsideration the concerns of African countries with \r\nregard to development. \r\n The international community has held, or is \r\npreparing to organize in the coming months, a series of \r\nvery significant international meetings to deal with \r\nvarious development issues. Be it through the World \r\nSummit on Food Security, the Copenhagen Climate \r\nChange Conference, the High-level United Nations \r\nConference on South-South Cooperation or the High-\r\nlevel Dialogue on Financing for Development, the \r\n A/64/PV.23\r\n \r\n15 09-56896 \r\n \r\ninternational community as a whole is urged to make a \r\ncommitment to the development of Africa. That \r\ncommitment must translate into specific measures, in \r\nparticular mobilization of the resources needed to \r\nimplement them, so that achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals can at last become a reality in \r\nAfrica. \r\n In conclusion, my country remains convinced that \r\nit is necessary to establish a true global partnership for \r\nAfrica’s development, which continues to be the only \r\nway to help our continent to achieve its development \r\ngoals and to give hope to millions of African people \r\nand the clear message that they can live in dignity, \r\nprotected from poverty and pandemics. \r\n Mrs. Mtamboh (Zambia): At the outset, allow \r\nme to express my sincere and heartfelt congratulations \r\nto the President on his election. My delegation assures \r\nhim of its support for the successful execution of his \r\nmandate. Zambia associates itself with the statements \r\nof the representatives of the Sudan, on behalf of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China, and of Tunisia, on behalf of the \r\nAfrican Group.  \r\n We are grateful for the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral entitled “2001-2010: Decade to Roll Back \r\nMalaria in Developing Countries, Particularly in \r\nAfrica”, contained in document A/64/302. My \r\ndelegation is of the view that the challenges that the \r\nworld faces today, such as (H1N1) influenza, avian \r\ninfluenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome and \r\nHIV/AIDS, call for more unity and concerted efforts \r\namong nations, aimed at the early sharing of concerns, \r\nthe mobilization of resources and the collective \r\nimplementation of evidence-based interventions. \r\n I am pleased to state that Zambia is making \r\nsteady progress in meeting its national health goals, as \r\nwell as the internationally agreed development targets, \r\nincluding the Millennium Development Goals. Allow \r\nme to refer to our country’s 2007 demographic and \r\nhealth survey, which covers a period of five years. It is \r\nworth noting that a number of important basic health \r\nindicators have improved in Zambia. Notable among \r\nthese is the fact that 70 per cent of our children receive \r\nall the required immunizations. Partly as a \r\nconsequence of that, the under-five mortality rate has \r\ndropped from 168 to 119 deaths per 1,000 live births.  \r\n In addition, the maternal mortality ratio has \r\nimproved from 729 to 591 per 100,000 live births; the \r\ninfant mortality rate has improved from 90 to 70 per \r\n1,000 live births; protection from malaria has increased \r\ncountrywide for those under five years of age and for \r\npregnant women; the incidence rates of malaria have \r\ndropped and the number of deaths recorded at our \r\nhealth facilities from the disease has dropped by 60 per \r\ncent; and the prevalence of HIV has decreased from \r\n16 to 14.3 per cent.  \r\n Zambia is threatened with the loss, or even the \r\nreversal, of those encouraging gains because of the \r\nprevailing global financial and economic crisis, as well \r\nas the withholding of pledged resources by some of our \r\ncooperating partners in the health sector. However, we \r\nare encouraged by the words of the President of the \r\nRepublic of Rwanda, His Excellency Mr. Paul Kagame, \r\nwho, in his speech this year at the fifty-ninth session of \r\nthe World Health Organization’s Regional Committee \r\nfor Africa, said that with self-reliance, the \r\nreprioritization of our health action plans, a conscious \r\nemphasis on primary health care and the use of local \r\nresources, as well as low-cost effective interventions, \r\nwe can indeed attain the MDGs. \r\n Zambia is the current Chair of the Roll Back \r\nMalaria Partnership Board. Noting that malaria \r\nremains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality, \r\nnot only in Zambia, but in many other parts of the \r\nworld, allow me to place special emphasis on that \r\nglobal health challenge. The good news is that Zambia \r\nis indeed one of the countries to have achieved \r\nuniversal coverage of preventive interventions against \r\nmalaria. By universal coverage, we mean the \r\nownership and the use of commodities intended to keep \r\nmalaria away from Zambian communities by the \r\ncommunities themselves. \r\n Mr. Sangqu (South Africa), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n I am pleased to note that other countries have \r\nalso achieved universal coverage. In that regard, I must \r\nacknowledge the role played by Minister Tewodros \r\nAdhanom, the former Chairman of the Roll Back \r\nMalaria Partnership Board, who is now Chairman of \r\nthe Board of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \r\nTuberculosis and Malaria, as well as the Minister of \r\nHealth of Ethiopia. Mr. Adhanom worked very hard as \r\nthe Chairman of the Roll Back Malaria Partnership \r\nBoard. During his term in office, all the funds required \r\nto meet the 2010 Roll Back Malaria targets were \r\nmobilized. He also worked very hard to ensure that a \r\nroad map for each country to achieve the 2010 Roll \r\nA/64/PV.23  \r\n \r\n09-56896 16 \r\n \r\nBack Malaria targets was put in place. Indeed, he left \r\nthe Roll Back Malaria Partnership with the strength \r\nneeded to take on the remaining challenges. I salute \r\nhim greatly and wish him well at the Global Fund. \r\n It is truly encouraging that we now have \r\nresources to protect about 460 million of the \r\napproximately 500 million African people who have \r\nbeen targeted. It is also pleasing that country-specific \r\nroad maps are already in place for the attainment of the \r\ndesired universal coverage. What we now need is the \r\nrequisite political will to assure all of us of the required \r\nleadership for success. \r\n We have only 15 months to do this work. By \r\n31 December 2010, we should all be able to celebrate \r\nhaving met our set targets. For the many that have yet \r\nto reach the target, there is still a lot of work to do. \r\nNonetheless, for the few that have already reached \r\ntheir targets, the challenge remaining is that of \r\nmaintaining these gains. \r\n My delegation is pleased to report that, over the \r\npast six years, Zambia has recorded impressive gains in \r\nthe health sector. The 2007 Zambia demographic and \r\nhealth survey I mentioned earlier attests to this. Those \r\ngains are evidence of the realization of the pledge that \r\nour Government has made in the fifth National \r\nDevelopment Plan to secure the health of Zambians by \r\naddressing public health challenges such as malaria. It \r\nought to be mentioned that judicious malaria control in \r\nZambia — in particular, that undertaken by the \r\nMinistry of Health — was a significant contributor to \r\nthose remarkable achievements. Further, it is pleasing \r\nto note — and worth mentioning — that in some areas \r\nof Zambia such as the Southern Province, which has a \r\npopulation of more than 2 million people, malaria is no \r\nlonger a major public health concern. \r\n The Ministry of Health in Zambia is succeeding \r\nin addressing malaria as a public health challenge \r\nthrough the simultaneous and diligent implementation \r\nof a package of evidence-based interventions.  \r\n The first is indoor residual house spraying. \r\nZambia’s indoor residual house spraying programme, \r\nwhich was originally implemented in five districts in \r\n2003, is now being implemented in 36 districts — half \r\nof the districts in the country. That progress is indeed \r\nremarkable, especially considering that, combined with \r\nthe coverage of insecticide-treated nets, Zambia has \r\nachieved the Roll Back Malaria goal of ensuring \r\n80 per cent coverage of the population with malaria \r\npreventative measures.  \r\n The second intervention is insecticide-treated \r\nbednets. Since 2004, the Ministry of Health has \r\ndistributed over 6 million such nets across the country. \r\nCountry-wide coverage of insecticide-treated bednets \r\nis now approximately 60 per cent. The third is case \r\nmanagement and diagnosis. The Ministry of Health has \r\nensured the availability of malaria treatment medicines \r\nand diagnostic tools in all public health facilities. \r\nMeasures have been put in place to minimize drug \r\nstock-outs. There are adequate stocks of the requisite \r\nantimalarials at our central distribution facility, the \r\nMedical Stores Limited. Improved logistical \r\nmanagement has also been of benefit, as has \r\nintermittent presumptive treatment — a measure with \r\nwhich we have performed extremely well. The \r\nproportion of pregnant women accessing malaria \r\npreventive treatment has increased. The 2007 \r\ndemographic and health survey revealed that the \r\npercentage of pregnant women who took an \r\nanti-malarial drug during pregnancy increased from \r\n35 per cent in 2002 to 86.5 per cent in 2007. The 2008 \r\nmalaria indicator survey revealed similar results. \r\n These successes have been the consequence of a \r\nnumber of factors. These include political will, \r\nsimultaneous use of evidence-based interventions, \r\npartnerships involving our Government and \r\ncooperating partners in the health sector, and \r\ncommunity mobilization and participation.  \r\n I should like to mention some of the challenges \r\nthat still remain. First, we anticipate covering \r\napproximately 1.2 million household structures across \r\nthe country with indoor residual house spraying, which \r\ntranslates into protection from malaria for over \r\n7 million people. This requires resources, both \r\nfinancial and material, which are limited. Secondly, it \r\nis worth mentioning that, when pledges of support are \r\nmade, they must be honoured — and aid should not be \r\nused as a tool for coercion. Thirdly, with regard to \r\nirrational drug use — while it is noted that not every \r\ncase of fever is caused by malaria, fostering acceptance \r\namong health workers that rapid diagnostic test kits are \r\nreliable remains a challenge. Fourthly, community \r\nsecurity and distribution requires further strengthening. \r\n In conclusion, I should like to mention that the \r\nGovernment of the Republic of Zambia is very grateful \r\nto all its cooperating partners at the local, regional and \r\n A/64/PV.23\r\n \r\n17 09-56896 \r\n \r\nglobal levels for their support. It is our conviction that, \r\nwith informed interventions, healthy partnerships and \r\ndedication to duty, we shall in no time rid Zambia and \r\nthe rest of the world of malaria. \r\n Mr. Wetland (Norway): It was truly heartening \r\nto listen to the speaker before me, the representative of \r\nZambia, and I must commend that country for its \r\nachievements in pursuing the health-related \r\nMillennium Development Goals in particular. \r\n As a friend and partner, Norway continues to \r\nsupport the vision and goals of the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD), which is a genuinely \r\nAfrican initiative. NEPAD demonstrates a willingness \r\nand determination to fight poverty on the continent and \r\nto strengthen the integration of Africa into the global \r\neconomy. NEPAD also represents a recognition that \r\nAfrican countries need to reinforce cooperation among \r\nthemselves in order to effectively address many of the \r\ncommon challenges. \r\n Africa has been hit hard by the recent food and \r\neconomic crises. Moreover, a climate crisis is looming. \r\nHowever, those challenges should not let us lose sight \r\nof the significant progress Africa has seen during the \r\npast decade, which includes unprecedented economic \r\ngrowth and improvements in governance. NEPAD has \r\nbeen part of that development. I should like to address \r\na few key issues that NEPAD will face in the years to \r\ncome. \r\n How should the resources to finance the goals \r\nand objectives of NEPAD be mobilized? The primary \r\nresponsibility rests with African nations themselves. \r\nTraditional aid should primarily be a supplement and \r\ncatalyst. We welcome the progress made in mobilizing \r\nthose domestic resources.  \r\n That said, Africa still needs substantial \r\nassistance. Commitments to increase aid must be \r\nhonoured. Too little attention has been given to the big \r\nmoney flowing out of Africa. Illicit capital flows from \r\npoor countries amount to hundreds of billions of \r\ndollars annually; that is around three times the level of \r\naid going into Africa. A lack of transparency and the \r\ninability to control capital flows have resulted in huge \r\namounts evading developing countries’ tax collectors. \r\nProceeds from crime and corruption move almost \r\nfreely from poor countries to safe havens, which are \r\noften in rich and middle-income countries. That is also \r\nwhy international cooperation to fight illicit capital \r\nflight and tax havens must be strengthened and made \r\neffective. And Africa should be assisted in establishing \r\nbetter tax systems and broadening the tax base. \r\n NEPAD has contributed to giving infrastructure \r\ndevelopment higher priority in the fight against poverty \r\nin Africa. We welcome that.  \r\n Africa is facing an energy deficit that may \r\nseverely hamper development if the power-generating \r\ncapacity is not substantially increased. Energy is a \r\nsector particularly well suited for regional cooperation. \r\nThe potential for clean energy in Africa is enormous, \r\nwith about 93 per cent of Africa’s hydropower \r\npotential still undeveloped. Hydropower is clean and \r\nrenewable energy, but the required investments are \r\noften of such a magnitude that aid can cover only a \r\nminor share. There is a need to involve the private \r\nsector to attract the required financing, technology and \r\nknowledge. That requires good governance, robust \r\ninstitutions, technical capacity and a favourable \r\ninvestment climate. We believe that those challenges \r\ncould be more forcefully addressed within the context \r\nof NEPAD. \r\n A few weeks ago, Uganda saw the inauguration \r\nof the first significant hydropower plant to be built in \r\nAfrica in 14 years. It is a joint Norwegian-Ugandan \r\nproject involving Norwegian private and public finance \r\nand expertise — TrønderEnergi and Norfund. The plant \r\nwill increase Uganda’s electricity production by \r\n7 per cent. I believe we can and should see more such \r\nsuccess stories that will bring growth and prosperity to \r\nthe people of Africa. \r\n The world has indeed changed since 2001. A \r\nclear example that the NEPAD framework was drafted \r\nin a different context than today is the modest attention \r\npaid to climate change in that document. Africa is \r\njoining forces in the run-up to Copenhagen. One \r\namong many commendable steps is the Climate for \r\nDevelopment in Africa Programme, a joint initiative by \r\nthe African Union, the United Nations Economic \r\nCommission for Africa and the African Development \r\nBank aiming at integrating climate risk management \r\ninto policy and decision processes throughout Africa. \r\nWe look forward to learning more about what role \r\nAfrican countries see for NEPAD in terms of \r\nadaptation to climate change in Africa. \r\n We all know that war and armed conflicts are \r\nmajor factors in undermining development. No other \r\ncontinent has suffered more from armed conflicts than \r\nAfrica in recent decades. Many of the conflicts that \r\nA/64/PV.23  \r\n \r\n09-56896 18 \r\n \r\nravaged the continent during the 1980s and 1990s have \r\nsince been brought to an end, and we have seen that \r\nsome of the countries emerging from conflicts in recent \r\nyears have achieved remarkable growth and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n It is important to highlight the role of women in \r\nachieving peaceful, sustainable development. This fall \r\nwe have seen a renewed global commitment not only to \r\nthe protection of women in conflict, but to highlighting \r\nthat women are part of the solution in situations of \r\nconflict.  \r\n We need to renew our efforts to promote women’s \r\nrights and their participation in democratic processes. \r\nOne glance at this year’s Human Development Report \r\nsays it clearly: there is a strong correlation between the \r\nlevel of gender equality and the growth and prosperity \r\nof countries. So the greatest gains countries can \r\nachieve, economically and politically, come from \r\nempowering women, ensuring equal opportunity and \r\nhealth care and increasing the participation of women \r\nin economic activity. That is not only the right thing to \r\ndo from a human and ethical perspective; it is hard-\r\ncore macro-economic policy. Empowering women \r\ngives competitive advantage. Improving women’s \r\neducational opportunity gives competitive advantage. \r\nCountries that recognize that and adjust their policies \r\nare going to prosper more than others. \r\n We must strive to uphold the pledges that we \r\nhave previously made with regard to achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and create the \r\nnecessary conditions for sustainable growth and \r\ndevelopment. That will be the most significant \r\ncontribution we can make towards peace and stability \r\non the African continent.  \r\n Norway is committed to a long-term partnership \r\nwith Africa and its people. Two weeks ago Norway \r\npresented its aid budget for 2010. In it we pledge to \r\ngive 1.09 per cent of our estimated gross national \r\nincome for development assistance. We will remain at \r\nthat high level for many years to come. Even though \r\nwe face a financial crisis, we increased the aid budget \r\nby 4 per cent as a token of solidarity with those who \r\nare less fortunate than ourselves, and thus we will \r\nremain a partner for Africa. \r\n Mr. Davide (Philippines): The Philippines aligns \r\nitself with the statement by the representative of the \r\nSudan on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. \r\nHowever, there are some elements that we wish to \r\nstress. Let me start with agenda items relating to the \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). \r\n The story of Africa’s development has been a \r\npriority of the General Assembly for quite some time. \r\nIt is a tale of a rich continent that paradoxically finds \r\nitself struggling to provide an adequate standard of \r\nliving to its teeming millions. All of us in this Hall are \r\nacutely aware of the promise and potential of the \r\ncountries and people of Africa, and we must constantly \r\nstrive to provide the necessary support for NEPAD. \r\n The Secretary-General’s twin reports on \r\nNEPAD — A/64/204 and A/64/208 — show that up to \r\nthe time in 2008 when the global financial and \r\neconomic crisis struck most of the world, Africa was \r\npursuing a deliberate path to growth. However, the \r\ncombination of food and energy price volatility, the \r\nturmoil in financial and economic markets and the \r\nincreasingly devastating effects of climate change has \r\nconspired with a waning international commitment to \r\nprovide much-needed financial and technical resources \r\nto derail Africa’s march towards the attainment of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), among other \r\ninternationally agreed development goals. \r\n There are two upcoming important United \r\nNations events on development-related issues that must \r\naddress NEPAD in their discussions. The first is the \r\nHigh-level Conference on South-South Cooperation to \r\nbe held, appropriately, in Nairobi this December. The \r\nsecond is the summit to review progress on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals to be held in New \r\nYork in 2010. The Assembly President has already set \r\nthe process of discussions on those two major meetings \r\nin motion by selecting co-facilitators to guide the \r\nprocess forward. \r\n United Nations discussions about the several \r\ncrises I mentioned earlier are proceeding apace. The \r\nOutcome of the Conference on the World Economic \r\nand Financial Crisis and Its Impact on Development \r\n(resolution 63/303, annex) outlined several \r\nrecommendations that we are taking forward. The \r\nUnited Nations System Chief Executives Board for \r\nCoordination is also pursuing nine joint crisis \r\ninitiatives meant to address the global financial and \r\neconomic crisis in much the same way that the \r\nComprehensive Framework for Action drawn up by the \r\nHigh-level Task Force on the Global Food Security \r\nCrisis provided short-, medium- and long-term \r\nrecommendations for consideration and implementation. \r\n A/64/PV.23\r\n \r\n19 09-56896 \r\n \r\nThe Economic and Social Council, together with its \r\nsubsidiary bodies, is likewise seized on many of the \r\nsame development issues and is actively pursuing \r\ndiscussions in order to come up with recommendations \r\nto be brought to the General Assembly in due time. All \r\nof those avenues for discussion and action can and \r\nshould remember to consider the needs of the most \r\nvulnerable — which includes Africa — in drawing up \r\nrecommendations. \r\n Let me now proceed to agenda item 47, entitled \r\n“2001-2010: Decade to Roll Back Malaria in \r\nDeveloping Countries, Particularly in Africa”, and the \r\nnote by the Secretary-General transmitting the report \r\nprepared by the World Health Organization (A/64/302). \r\nThe report and its summary set out many promising \r\ntrends and indications of progress in the global effort \r\nto fight malaria. \r\n It is fitting that an assessment of the world \r\nmalaria condition is being made at this juncture, since \r\nthe extent to which malaria is controlled and \r\neliminated determines how much we are progressing \r\ntowards the achievement of Millennium Development \r\nGoal 6: to combat those deadly diseases that have the \r\nbroadest and starkest impact on development. The \r\nH1N1 influenza was recently added to those diseases.  \r\n Time is running fast towards the 2015 deadline \r\nfor the MDGs. Our journey towards it is diverted by \r\nother crises of every kind, for which summits have \r\nbeen convened. \r\n The Government of the Philippines gives priority \r\nto the control and eradication of malaria, as it \r\ncontinues to be among the top 10 causes of morbidity \r\nin the country. Most locations in the Philippines where \r\nmalaria is endemic are in the poorest and most remote \r\nareas, with a high percentage of indigenous peoples. \r\n Malaria control and eradication efforts in the \r\nPhilippines have been scaled up through a five-pronged \r\nstrategy that emphasizes working with local \r\ngovernment health units. The strategy includes: first, \r\nraising political awareness and promoting community \r\ninvolvement, especially at the local level; second, \r\nstrengthening diagnosis, promptly and effectively \r\ntreating malaria and expanding the availability of drug \r\nsupplies in all health-care facilities; third, streamlining \r\nreferrals of severe cases, including through training \r\ndoctors on the management of such cases, training \r\nhealth workers on treatment policies and protecting \r\nmothers by providing nets treated with insecticide; \r\nfourth, building buffer stockpiles of essential supplies \r\nfor malaria and dengue; and, fifth, promoting \r\noperational research to improve the delivery of services \r\nto internally displaced families, indigenous communities \r\nand schoolchildren. As a result of those efforts, malaria \r\ncases in the Philippines have consistently been \r\ndeclining — from more than 76,000 cases with 150 \r\ndeaths reported in 1990 to 33,800 cases with 89 deaths \r\nin 2006. \r\n In order to facilitate programme management and \r\ninculcate health-seeking behaviour among the Filipino \r\npopulation, especially the high-risk population, the \r\nPhilippine Government declared that November every \r\nyear would be Malaria Awareness Month. That \r\ninitiative bands together various Government agencies, \r\nsuch as the Departments of Health, of Interior and \r\nLocal Government, of Education, of National Defence \r\nand of Tourism, all local government units — the \r\nprovinces, cities, municipalities and barangays — and \r\nthe National Commission on Indigenous Peoples, \r\nsynergizing the mandate of each for the prevention and \r\nthe elimination of malaria in the Philippines. \r\n While it is very heartening that global funds \r\nmade available for malaria have substantially \r\nincreased — from less than $0.2 billion in 2000 to \r\n$2 billion at the end of 2008 — it is disconcerting to \r\nnote that significant sources of funding come from \r\nonly a few large external contributors. That means that \r\nwithout a good number and diversity of funding \r\nsources, there is a risk that antimalaria efforts will be \r\njeopardized if any of those major sources dries up. We \r\ntherefore advocate a diverse portfolio of global funding \r\nfor malaria in order to ensure the sustainability and to \r\nlessen the vulnerability of antimalaria efforts, \r\nparticularly in developing countries. \r\n The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and \r\nMalaria, as well as the Roll Back Malaria project, offer \r\nmajor assistance to the Philippine fight against the \r\ndisease. Notwithstanding the fact that a significant \r\nportion of our antimalaria efforts is funded from \r\nexternal sources, the Philippine Government, driven by \r\nits commitment to a malaria-free Philippines by 2020, \r\nincreased its malaria control budget from 3.4 million \r\npesos in 2001 to 60 million pesos in 2008, representing \r\na 2,000 per cent increase in funding in the national \r\nbudget to fight malaria. \r\n We can see some emerging challenges in the fight \r\nagainst malaria. The global economic and financial \r\nA/64/PV.23  \r\n \r\n09-56896 20 \r\n \r\ncrises threaten current and prospective funding for \r\nhealth programmes, including international health \r\nassistance. Global warming increases the incidence of \r\nclimate-sensitive diseases such as malaria. Those \r\nchallenges only underscore that international \r\ncooperation to rid the world of malaria will require \r\ncontinued and enhanced cooperation on other related \r\nissues, such as financial and economic downturns of a \r\nregional or international nature and climate change.  \r\n The General Assembly, as the biggest parliament \r\nof nations, must focus on the findings of the World \r\nHealth Organization that while there has been \r\nremarkable progress in malaria control, these potential \r\nthreats demand increased attention: first, resistance to \r\ninsecticides and antimalarial medicines and the lack of \r\nalternatives; second, insufficient funding to reach \r\nuniversal coverage; and third, weakness in global and \r\nintranational purchasing and supply, resulting in \r\nshortages of key commodities at the national and \r\nhealth facility levels. \r\n Mrs. Viotti (Brazil): One of the key priorities of \r\nBrazil’s foreign policy is strengthening cooperation \r\nwith Africa, land of the forefathers of a significant part \r\nof the Brazilian people. For that purpose Brazil has \r\nestablished a network of embassies in the African \r\ncontinent. Today, we are present in 34 African \r\ncountries through resident embassies, including in \r\nAddis Ababa, the headquarters of the African Union. \r\n Brazil has also been one of the mentors and main \r\nsupporters of the Africa-South America summits, the \r\nsecond of which took place less than a month ago in \r\nIsla Margarita, Venezuela. South America and Africa \r\nare building a bridge of dialogue and cooperation. Our \r\ncommon efforts have resulted in a significant increase \r\nof South American-African trade, from $6 billion to \r\n$36 billion in the last six years.  \r\n As an Africa-owned and Africa-driven blueprint \r\nfor development, the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) can count on Brazil’s full \r\nsupport. Our approach to NEPAD is that of a call for a \r\npartnership with Africa, rather than a partnership for \r\nAfrica. Brazil believes in cooperation as a tool of \r\ntechnical and technological emancipation and as a \r\nconduit for sharing successful experiences in the fields \r\nof health, energy and, in particular, agriculture. \r\n Our cooperation with Africa is consistent with \r\nNEPAD’s focus on agriculture as a means to wealth \r\ngeneration and poverty alleviation. The Brazilian \r\nAgriculture and Husbandry Research Company opened \r\nan office in Accra through which it is cooperating with \r\nvarious African countries. To take that cooperation \r\neven further, Brazil will host a meeting of ministers of \r\nagriculture next year. We believe in the African \r\npotential for the production of biofuels. Brazil’s \r\nexperience in that area has made possible the \r\ndevelopment of one of the cleanest sources of energy, \r\nsure to be in growing demand in the years to come, \r\nwithout endangering the food supply and food security. \r\n Brazil is aware of the impact of the global \r\neconomic and financial crisis on African countries. We \r\npraise their efforts to tackle economic hardship, which \r\nis aggravated by a global financial disarray for which \r\nthey cannot be held responsible. Those efforts have to \r\nbe supported. It is important that the international \r\nfinancial institutions be able to provide countries most \r\nin need with more liquidity and credit that are subject \r\nto less conditionalities. Brazil is working towards this \r\naim in the Group of 20, together with other developing \r\ncountries.  \r\n The Secretary-General’s note on the Decade to \r\nRoll Back Malaria (A/64/302) gives us an updated \r\npicture of how different countries are faring in the fight \r\nto control and eradicate this serious tropical disease. \r\nBrazil is committed to the international fight against \r\nmalaria through bilateral cooperation and participation \r\nin multilateral efforts. Our engagement with the Global \r\nFund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and the \r\nRoll Back Malaria Partnership reflects this commitment.  \r\n The international community has made \r\nremarkable progress in the past few years in pursuit of \r\nthe goals of achieving universal coverage of malaria \r\nprevention and treatment by December 2010 and \r\nreducing global malaria deaths by 50 per cent from the \r\n2000 levels and to near zero preventable deaths by \r\n2015. It is not acceptable that children continue to die \r\nfrom preventable diseases. Besides expanding the use \r\nof insecticide-treated nets, it is imperative that \r\nadequate mechanisms be put in place to ensure access \r\nto drugs for malaria treatment if we are to avoid \r\npreventable deaths and eliminate this scourge. \r\n Mr. Neville (Australia): I thank President Treki \r\nfor convening this joint debate on the New Partnership \r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD) and the Decade to \r\nRoll Back Malaria in Developing Countries, \r\nParticularly in Africa. I will address each item in turn.  \r\n A/64/PV.23\r\n \r\n21 09-56896 \r\n \r\n First, NEPAD continues to provide an important \r\nframework for addressing the critical challenges facing \r\nthe African continent. In his address to a meeting of \r\nAfrican Union foreign ministers in Addis Ababa in \r\nFebruary this year, the Australian Foreign Minister \r\nidentified three priority areas for Australian \r\nengagement with African countries: first, support for \r\nAfrican efforts to promote economic growth and \r\nprosperity through investment and trade; secondly, \r\nsupport to accelerate progress towards the achievement \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals; and thirdly, \r\nsupport to address peace and security challenges in \r\nAfrica. These priorities are consistent with the \r\nobjectives of NEPAD.  \r\n In the past year, Australia has increased its \r\ndevelopment assistance to Africa by 40 per cent. The \r\nAustralian Government believes that it can assist \r\nAfrican countries with their long-term development in \r\nareas where our expertise and experience can make a \r\nunique and positive contribution. To this end, Australia \r\nis deepening its development cooperation engagement \r\nwith Africa through three sectoral programmes: food \r\nsecurity and agriculture, water and sanitation, and \r\nmaternal and child health.  \r\n Furthermore, the Australian Government sees \r\neducation as a key to assisting to Africa to realize its \r\neconomic and social development potential. We are \r\nexpanding our scholarships programme in Africa \r\nthrough short courses and fellowships and capacity-\r\nbuilding partnerships facilities. These facilities will \r\nfocus on priority areas, including mining and natural \r\nresource management, agriculture and public sector \r\nreform, and will be flexible to respond to requests from \r\nAfrican Governments.  \r\n Finally, on this item Australia shares the \r\nSecretary-General’s frustration with the ongoing Doha \r\nRound of trade negotiations. We join the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in calling for a conclusion to the Doha Round. \r\nAustralia is pursuing an outcome that is for the good of \r\ndevelopment, for the good of agricultural trade reform \r\nand for the good of multilateral trading regimes. The \r\nearly conclusion of the Doha Round will also be a \r\nsignificant economic stimulus at a time when the \r\nworld’s economy has faced its greatest threat since the \r\nGreat Depression of the 1930s.  \r\n Turning to the Decade to Roll Back Malaria in \r\nDeveloping Countries, I would like to thank the World \r\nHealth Organization for its report on this item (see \r\nA/64/302, annex). Malaria has a serious economic as \r\nwell as human impact on Africa. It fuels the cycle of \r\npoverty, afflicting primarily the poor, who tend to live \r\nin malaria-prone rural areas in poorly constructed \r\ndwellings that offer few if any barriers against \r\nmosquitoes. It is an unacceptable tragedy that the \r\ndisease accounts for nearly one in five childhood \r\ndeaths in Africa.  \r\n In the Asia-Pacific region, malaria also causes \r\nsignificant morbidity and mortality. Over 60 per cent of \r\nmalaria cases outside of Africa occur in the Asia-\r\nPacific region; a high proportion of these cases are \r\nvivax malaria, for which the clinical tools required for \r\ndiagnosis and management are less well developed. It \r\nis important to recognize that malaria is a global issue.  \r\n Australia is playing a leading role in addressing \r\nmalaria in the Asia-Pacific region. Through the Pacific \r\nMalaria Initiative, Australia is providing targeted \r\ntechnical and management support to assist \r\nGovernments to implement their national malaria \r\naction plans. The Initiative is already making \r\nimpressive progress. In Solomon Islands, the malaria \r\nincidence rate has been reduced from 199 malaria cases \r\nper 1,000 people in 2003 to 82 cases per 1,000 in 2008. \r\nIn Vanuatu, the rate has been reduced from 74 malaria \r\ncases per 1,000 in 2003 to 14 cases in 2008. The \r\nInitiative has highlighted the importance of working \r\nwithin partner Government systems, of strong political \r\nleadership and of providing appropriate technical \r\nexpertise.  \r\n Australia was also pleased to host the inaugural \r\nmeeting of the Asia-Pacific Malaria Elimination \r\nNetwork in February 2009. The Network was \r\nestablished to bring attention to the work of malaria \r\nelimination in the Asia-Pacific region, which is home \r\nto a quarter of the countries in the world that have \r\nembarked on this elimination. It represents another \r\nmeans of strengthening the technologies, skills, \r\nsystems and leadership that are needed to reduce and \r\neventually eliminate this disease in the Asia-Pacific \r\nregion.  \r\n Mr. Touray (Sierra Leone): Allow me to \r\ncongratulate the President and the members of the \r\nBureau on their election to conduct our work during \r\nthis session and to reassure them of my delegation’s \r\nsupport for the successful conclusion of our work. \r\n My delegation fully aligns itself with the \r\nstatements made by the Permanent Representative of \r\nA/64/PV.23  \r\n \r\n09-56896 22 \r\n \r\nthe Sudan and the Permanent Representative of Tunisia \r\non behalf of the Group of 77 and China and the African \r\nGroup, respectively. Given the importance my \r\ndelegation attaches to the respective agenda items, we \r\nwould like, however, to make a few pertinent \r\ncomments from a national perspective.  \r\n We join others in thanking the Secretary-General \r\nfor his comprehensive and forward-looking reports \r\n(A/64/204, A/64/208 and A/64/210). My delegation \r\nfurther wishes to express its appreciation to the Special \r\nAdviser on Africa, Under-Secretary-General Cheick \r\nSidi Diarra, and his dedicated team for their advisory \r\nand advocacy work in promoting Africa’s development \r\nagenda. \r\n We are reviewing various reports on the progress \r\nof implementation of the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment; the political declaration on Africa’s \r\ndevelopment needs, adopted 22 September 2008 \r\n(resolution 63/1); the 1998 recommendations on the \r\ncauses of conflict and the promotion of durable peace \r\nand sustainable development in Africa; and the Roll \r\nBack Malaria programme, at a very crucial moment in \r\nthe global economic architecture. \r\n Clearly, the entire global community is grappling \r\nwith the deepening effect of an unprecedented \r\neconomic and financial crisis that undoubtedly has had \r\na much graver impact on the developing world and in \r\nparticular has set back the 34 least developed countries \r\nin Africa from attaining internationally agreed \r\ndevelopment goals, including the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, by the target date of 2015. \r\n However, despite the gloom there are prospects \r\non the horizon. With the support of the international \r\ncommunity significant, progress has been made in \r\nfostering the objectives of the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD). Conflicts on the \r\ncontinent have diminished. Many households sleep \r\nunder insecticide-treated mosquito bednets. Some \r\nAfrican heads of State, including the President of \r\nSierra Leone, recently launched the African Leaders \r\nMalaria Alliance to combat this deadly pandemic. \r\nNonetheless, we concur with the Secretary-General’s \r\nassessment that the key challenge is to ensure that the \r\ncurrent economic downturn, including the food and \r\nenergy crisis that preceded it, does not lead to a \r\nreversal of the gains achieved so far. \r\n The integration of NEPAD into the African Union \r\nmarks a new dawn in advancing the socio-economic \r\ntransformation agenda of the continent. It provides a \r\nwindow for strategic partnerships to explore areas of \r\ncooperation to address global challenges such as the \r\ndebt issue, climate change, trade and regional \r\nintegration and sustainable development. We are \r\nencouraged by the ongoing implementation of NEPAD \r\nprojects ranging from the Comprehensive Africa \r\nAgriculture Development Programme — of which my \r\ncountry is a recent member — to projects on \r\ninfrastructure, environment, gender mainstreaming, \r\neducation and training in information and \r\ncommunication technologies.  \r\n At the level of governance, advances in the \r\nimplementation of the African Peer Review \r\nMechanism — involving 30 acceding countries, 12 of \r\nwhich are being reviewed — demonstrate the continent’s \r\nresolve to achieve a paradigm shift. \r\n On the home front, my Government has \r\narticulated and is currently implementing its Agenda \r\nfor Change with the assistance and support of the \r\nUnited Nations Joint Vision. It is a framework through \r\nwhich Government has set clear priorities such as \r\nenergy, agriculture and infrastructure as the drivers of \r\ngrowth and the necessary conditions for human \r\ndevelopment. The strategies for delivering these \r\npriorities include, among other things, improving \r\npublic service capacity and enhancing public and \r\nprivate sector partnerships, as well as our domestic \r\nfinancial system.  \r\n It is in this regard that we are intensifying our \r\ncooperation with traditional and new partners, \r\nparticularly through South-South cooperation. The \r\nrecent visit of President Koroma to Brazil and the \r\nconclusion of a tripartite agreement with Cuba and \r\nSouth Africa for improving health care delivery in my \r\ncountry are a clear demonstration of the Government’s \r\ndetermination to replicate best practices at that level. \r\n Cognizant of the fact that the responsibility for \r\npeace and security in Africa, including the capacity to \r\naddress the root causes of conflict and to resolve \r\nconflicts in a peaceful manner, lies primarily with \r\nAfrican countries themselves, the African Union and \r\nsubregional organizations are strengthening their \r\ncapacities in conflict prevention and resolution. They \r\nare also taking the lead in peacekeeping operations on \r\nthe continent.  \r\n The African Union and subregional organizations \r\nare playing a significant role in responding to conflicts \r\n A/64/PV.23\r\n \r\n23 09-56896 \r\n \r\nand potentially explosive situations. The African \r\nUnion’s recent efforts to quell the post-election crisis \r\nin Kenya and its peacekeeping efforts in Darfur and \r\nSomalia are clear indications of the continent’s \r\npreparedness to rise to the occasion, with much-needed \r\nsupport from the international community and the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n While these efforts are continuing, we are also \r\nwitnessing a new wave of challenges involving \r\nunconstitutional changes of Government, transnational \r\norganized crime, narcotic drug trafficking, particularly \r\nin the Gulf of Guinea, piracy and issues of governance, \r\nhuman rights and corruption. Thus, the need to forge \r\npartnerships to strengthen capacities to respond to \r\ncrises and security threats cannot be overemphasized. \r\n In this respect, my delegation urges a \r\ncomprehensive review of the implementation of \r\nrecommendations contained in the 1998 report of the \r\nSecretary-General (A/52/871) on the causes of conflict \r\nand the promotion of durable peace and sustainable \r\ndevelopment in Africa in the light of the new and \r\nemerging issues affecting human security on the \r\ncontinent. \r\n In concluding this brief intervention, I reiterate \r\nmy Government’s commitment to furthering the \r\nobjectives of NEPAD, the promotion of good \r\ngovernance, sustainable peace and development, and \r\nfurther call upon our partners to intensify, among other \r\nthings, efforts to first, eliminate all protectionist and \r\ndistorting trade barriers by promoting and facilitating \r\nmarket access to developing countries, especially the \r\nleast developed; secondly, to deliver on their \r\ncommitments to achieve the official development \r\nassistance target of 0.7 per cent and 0.15 per cent of \r\ngross national income for the developing and least \r\ndeveloped countries, respectively; thirdly, to ensure \r\nadequate and predictable funding and support for the \r\npeacebuilding efforts of countries emerging from \r\nconflict in order to facilitate their early recovery efforts \r\nfor sustainable peace and development; fourthly, to \r\npromote and strengthen cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and the African Union, as well as the \r\nsubregional organizations; and finally, to address the \r\nunsustainable debt burden of heavily indebted poor \r\ncountries. \r\n Mr. Gaspar Martins (Angola): Angola fully \r\naligns itself with the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of the Sudan on behalf of the Group of \r\n77 and China, as well as with the statement made by \r\nthe representative of Tunisia on behalf of the African \r\nGroup. \r\n We take this opportunity to express our sincere \r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for his seventh \r\nconsolidated progress report (A/64/204) on \r\nimplementation and international support for the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD); his \r\nprogress reports entitled “Africa’s development needs: \r\nstate of implementation of various commitments, \r\nchallenges and the way forward” (A/64/208) and \r\n“Implementation of the recommendations contained in \r\nthe report of the Secretary-General on the causes of \r\nconflict and the promotion of durable peace and \r\nsustainable development in Africa” (A/64/210); and his \r\nnote entitled “2001-2010: Decade to Roll Back Malaria \r\nin Developing Countries, Particularly in Africa” \r\n(A/64/302). We are confident that those reports will \r\nenable a better understanding of the progress made by \r\nAfrican countries in implementing the key priorities of \r\nNEPAD. \r\n Angola notes with satisfaction that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report urges international development \r\npartners, including the United Nations system, to take \r\nconcrete and urgent actions to mitigate the impact of \r\nthe socio-economic crisis in order to assist African \r\ncountries in stimulating their economies and \r\nimplementing NEPAD. We are certain that such an \r\neffort will support Africa in its quest to achieve \r\ninternationally agreed development goals, including \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. \r\n The recent 10.2 per cent increase in official \r\ndevelopment assistance to Africa and the 16 per cent \r\nincrease in foreign direct investment on the continent \r\nare notable achievements for Africa and its partners. \r\nWhile we remain concerned that extractive industries \r\ncontinue to absorb a disproportionate amount of those \r\nflows, those figures show that there are real \r\nopportunities on the continent. We are also concerned \r\nthat the current global economic recession may reverse \r\nthat trend, exposing many African economies to an \r\nexogenous shock where many will not have the policy \r\nspace to enact the recommended policies. \r\n NEPAD has been designed for Africa and by \r\nAfricans to tackle the major challenges to sustained \r\neconomic growth and sustainable development in \r\nAfrica. We are pleased to note that some projects \r\nconceived under NEPAD are being implemented, in \r\nA/64/PV.23  \r\n \r\n09-56896 24 \r\n \r\nparticular in the domains of infrastructure, information, \r\nhealth, education, the environment, agriculture, science \r\nand technology, gender mainstreaming and civil \r\nsociety involvement. There are visible signs of \r\nprogress, owing to a global partnership. In that context, \r\nwe welcome the several partnership initiatives our \r\ncontinent has been developing with various countries \r\nand regions of the world. \r\n My delegation recognizes that peace, development \r\nand the protection of human rights are interlinked and \r\nmutually reinforcing. In that regard, we are pleased \r\nwith the level of cooperation between the African \r\nUnion and the United Nations family, in particular as \r\nthe African Union aims for political stability and the \r\nresolution of conflicts where they linger on the \r\ncontinent. In recent years, the African Union has \r\nsubstantially improved its capacity to contribute to the \r\npeaceful resolution of conflicts in the continent. We \r\ncall on Africa’s partners to continue to support such \r\nefforts, as they are crucial for the economic growth and \r\nsustainable development of the continent. \r\n Angola maintains its commitment to the sectoral \r\npriorities of NEPAD. One such priority area is \r\ninfrastructure, as it improves the conditions for the \r\ndevelopment of other sectors of the economy and plays \r\nan important role in attracting investment. \r\n The Angolan Government is implementing a \r\nnational reconstruction programme that aims to build \r\nor rehabilitate the infrastructure that will facilitate \r\ntrade and improve communication and movement \r\nthroughout the country. The programme has enabled us \r\nto connect all 18 Angolan provinces. \r\n Although we have registered tangible progress in \r\nthe health sector in Africa, it is important to highlight \r\nthat future African generations are still at a risk of \r\nbeing condemned to suffer from malaria and other \r\ntreatable diseases. Life expectancy figures are \r\nparticularly gloomy for children under the age of 5. We \r\nstrongly believe that the nature of those diseases \r\ncompels us to undertake joint efforts at all levels to roll \r\nback its prevalence on the continent. For that reason, \r\nmy country reaffirms its commitment to halve malaria \r\nmortality and commends other efforts and initiatives to \r\nthat end. In that regard we welcome the launching of \r\nthe African Leaders Malaria Alliance and the \r\nstrengthening of the United States Global Health \r\nInitiative, to which President Obama has pledged \r\n$63 billion over the next six years. \r\n I must convey our appreciation to the Global \r\nFund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the \r\nWorld Bank, which finances the Angola HIV/AIDS, \r\nMalaria and Tuberculosis Control Project, the Bush \r\nPresidential Initiative and other initiatives carried out \r\nby foundations. Combined, the efforts of Africans and \r\ntheir partners seek to deploy resources, institutions and \r\nknowledge in the fight against preventable and \r\ntreatable diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, \r\nHIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases. \r\n The full implementation of all the commitments \r\nmade to and for Africa, including NEPAD, was the \r\nsubject of the political declaration of the high-level \r\nmeeting on Africa’s development needs and on the \r\nstate of implementation of various commitments, \r\nchallenges and the way forward, which was held on \r\n22 September 2008 here in New York. Among other \r\nthings, that document recognized that Africa as a whole \r\nwas being disproportionately affected by the negative \r\nconsequences of the financial and economic crisis, \r\nclimate change, the food crisis and volatile commodity \r\nprices. \r\n In order to overcome those challenges, Angola \r\nbelieves that the international community should, \r\namong other things, remain seized of the reform and \r\nstrengthening of the international financial system and \r\narchitecture so as to align it with the global need for \r\nstability, agility, support, participation, transparency, \r\ncoherence and coordination. In addition, it should take \r\nconcrete steps to reach a successful conclusion of the \r\nDoha Round of trade negotiations, with the full \r\nrealization of its development mandate, and undertake \r\nambitious commitments vis-à-vis technology transfer \r\nand financing for adaptation under the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, so as to \r\nenable African countries to adapt to the impact of \r\nclimate change and develop competitive green \r\neconomies. \r\n My delegation stresses the need for concrete \r\nactions and time-bound commitments to meet specific \r\nneeds relating to development assistance, trade, \r\nfinance, access to markets, debt relief and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Finally, we look forward to the full \r\nimplementation of the recommendations contained in \r\nthe Secretary-General’s reports related to NEPAD. \r\nFurthermore, we stress the need for this body to \r\nconsider the establishment of a monitoring mechanism \r\n A/64/PV.23\r\n \r\n25 09-56896 \r\n \r\nto enable us all to remain seized of the coordinated and \r\ncoherent implementation of all commitments to, and \r\nby, Africa. \r\n Mr. Owoseni (Nigeria): Nigeria aligns itself with \r\nthe statements made earlier by the representatives of \r\nthe Sudan and Tunisia on behalf of the Group of 77 and \r\nChina and the African Group, respectively. \r\n My delegation commends the efforts of the \r\nSecretary-General in providing elaborate reports under \r\nsub-items (a) and (b) of agenda item 63, which is now \r\nunder consideration. We are particularly thankful for \r\nthe report (A/64/208) — and the insights it provides — \r\non the challenges that lie ahead with regard to the full \r\nimplementation of the September 2008 political \r\ndeclaration on Africa’s development needs. The \r\nsymbolism of that report underscores the continued \r\ncommitment of the United Nations system to maintain \r\nAfrica’s development as a top item on the international \r\ncommunity’s agenda. \r\n My delegation also wishes to take this \r\nopportunity to commend the leadership provided by the \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) \r\nand the Office of the Special Adviser on Africa in \r\nupdating Member States through their comprehensive \r\nbriefings. By doing so, they have afforded us an \r\nopportunity to appreciate the achievements that \r\nNEPAD has had and the challenges on the path towards \r\nthe realization of its goals and objectives. \r\n Since coming into being, NEPAD has engendered \r\noptimism, even in the face of daunting challenges. \r\nAfrica remains confident that that strategy was the \r\nright model for mitigating crises and propelling the \r\ncontinent’s sustainable development and growth. That \r\nbelief underpins the tenacious commitment to creating \r\nan environment that will enable progress in the \r\nflagship sectors, including infrastructure, agriculture, \r\nhealth, education, the environment, science and \r\ntechnology, information and communication technology, \r\ngender mainstreaming and civil society. \r\n Nigeria attaches the utmost importance to the \r\nAfrican Peer Review Mechanism (APRM), a wholly \r\nunique African instrument for promoting and \r\nstrengthening good governance that has gained \r\npopularity both within and outside Africa. Not only has \r\nthe number of participating countries grown, the \r\nnumber of those that have been peer reviewed has also \r\nincreased, thus deepening the culture of accountability, \r\ntransparency and genuine self-examination on the \r\ncontinent. The success of the APRM has made it a \r\nregular paradigm of reference at many extra-African \r\nforums. My delegation therefore calls on those \r\ncountries on the continent that have not yet acceded to \r\nit to do so, since, in the final analysis, good governance \r\nis about the well-being of the people. Good governance \r\nis a sine qua non precondition. \r\n As African countries navigate through the \r\nlabyrinth of age-old economic difficulties, our efforts \r\ncontinue to contend with the inevitable influence of \r\nunforeseen exogenous circumstances which are \r\nmanifested through a deluge of global crises in the \r\nenergy and food sectors. The modest growth recorded \r\nin recent years has been substantially undermined by \r\nthe current global financial and economic crisis. The \r\nresult is the further weakening of the capacity of Africa \r\nto attain the internationally agreed development goals, \r\nincluding the Millennium Development Goals. In order \r\nto achieve a true and realistic global recovery, the \r\ninternational community needs to take appropriate \r\nmeasures to fend off further economic reversals on the \r\ncontinent. \r\n The United Nations and NEPAD provide ready \r\nplatforms for articulating and formulating appropriate \r\nresponses to Africa’s needs. Accordingly, we believe \r\nthat the recommendations contained in the political \r\ndeclaration on Africa’s development needs of \r\nSeptember 2008 and in the outcome document of the \r\nUnited Nations High-level Conference on the World \r\nFinancial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on \r\nDevelopment, which was held from 24 to 26 June \r\n2009, have the capacity to turn around the fortunes of \r\nthe continent. \r\n The success achieved in consolidating the \r\nstrategic partnership that NEPAD has created with \r\nfriends of Africa from all over the world has further \r\nstrengthened our faith in the United Nations system. \r\nNigeria welcomes Africa’s productive engagement with \r\nJapan and the European Union, countries in the context \r\nof the South-South process, including China, India and \r\nTurkey, as well as countries participating in the Africa-\r\nSouth America Summit. \r\n We call for the expeditious implementation of the \r\nsuggested useful remedies, including enhancing \r\nnational capacities for the domestic mobilization of \r\nresources, the scaling up of official development \r\nassistance, increasing foreign direct investment, the \r\nspeedy reactivation and conclusion of the Doha Round \r\nA/64/PV.23  \r\n \r\n09-56896 26 \r\n \r\nof trade negotiations, the expansion of the scope of \r\nmultilateral and bilateral debt relief and outright debt \r\ncancellation for the poorest countries. \r\n Climate change stands out in the panoply of \r\nsocio-economic challenges. It is not just an inhibitor to \r\nsustainable development but also an existential danger \r\nto the continent. My delegation commends the \r\nSecretary-General for once again demonstrating an \r\nunrelenting commitment to face this challenge \r\nfrontally. We welcome the rare sense of optimism that \r\nresulted from his summit and hope that the momentum \r\nthat has been generated will catalyse a comprehensive \r\nand all-inclusive agreement at Copenhagen in \r\nDecember.  \r\n For us in Africa, the enormity of the effects of \r\nclimate challenge has compelled us to take a collective \r\napproach to resolving it. In that regard, my delegation \r\ncalls on the international community to uphold the \r\ncommon African position deriving from the uniqueness \r\nand peculiarity of climate change impact, especially \r\nconsidering the continent’s relatively weaker capacity \r\nto respond. \r\n My delegation acknowledges that meaningful \r\nsustainable development can only take root in an \r\natmosphere where peace and security prevail. Thus, in \r\nAfrica’s quest for development, even with the \r\ncollaboration of partners, long drawn-out crises and \r\nconflicts constitute serious impediments. Such crises \r\ndissipate Africa’s resources and retard growth. It is for \r\nthat reason that my delegation concurs with the \r\nSecretary-General’s conclusions and recommendations \r\ncontained in his report (A/64/210). We urge Member \r\nStates to work towards establishing lasting peace. \r\n Nigeria appreciates the continued commitment of \r\nthe United Nations to restore peace and order in most \r\nof Africa’s hot spots. We are heartened that the \r\nexperience with the African Union-United Nations \r\nHybrid Operation in Darfur has yielded some \r\noutstanding results. The success of that partnership \r\nshould therefore be a lesson that can be adopted as \r\nstrategy, not only for peacekeeping but also in \r\nformulating early warning mechanisms to halt potential \r\nconflicts.  \r\n Equally gratifying is the work of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, which provides invaluable \r\nfinancial and other critical support for countries just \r\ntransiting from peacekeeping towards peace, stability \r\nand development. \r\n At this critical moment in history, we believe that \r\nthe opportunity provided by the international \r\ncommunity’s support must be adequately complemented \r\nand reciprocated. As Africans, we must dedicate \r\nourselves to adopting best practices and innovative \r\nstrategies to maximize the gains. We cannot but agree \r\nwith the call in the report on the need to invest in  \r\n “mechanisms aimed at preventing conflict at the \r\ncommunity, local, national and regional levels \r\nand supporting partners in the field to build their \r\ncapacity to effectively address the new and \r\nemerging threats to peace and stability”. \r\n(A/64/210, para. 71) \r\n Similarly, we call for a preventive approach to the \r\nmanagement of crises and conflicts. The efficacy of \r\nthis approach derives from the institution of political \r\ngovernance, which is predicated on the principles of \r\ndemocracy, fairness, justice and the equitable \r\nallocation of resources. In that equation, there should \r\nbe zero tolerance for democratic reversals in the form \r\nof unconstitutional changes of Government, self-\r\nsuccession or self-perpetuation in office. \r\n Since the holding of the 2000 Abuja Summit, \r\nwhich adopted the Abuja Declaration and plan of \r\naction, tremendous improvements and progress have \r\nbeen made in the area of rolling back malaria. \r\nHowever, that pandemic continues to ravage the \r\ncontinent, causing a high number of deaths among both \r\nchildren and adults. \r\n The effects go beyond the health of the \r\nindividual. Economically, it brings a lot of hardship to \r\npeople, particularly in Africa. Although considerable \r\nefforts have been made by affected countries and by \r\ndonor agencies, the goals of Roll Back Malaria have \r\nnot been realized. Africa is committed to eliminating \r\nthe malaria scourge. To that end, Nigeria remains \r\ncommitted to hosting the Abuja-Plus Ten Summit on \r\nRoll Back Malaria in 2011. We therefore reiterate our \r\nearlier call for the support of the Secretary-General, \r\nnot only to make the proposed summit possible but \r\nalso to facilitate the realization of its objectives. \r\n Nigeria firmly believes that although the \r\nchallenges facing Africa may be daunting, they are not \r\ninsurmountable. With effective harmonization and \r\ncoordination, the targets set out in the frameworks of \r\nthe African Union, NEPAD and the APRM could fast \r\ntrack our transformation from a continent of \r\nlamentation to one of opportunity. My delegation \r\n A/64/PV.23\r\n \r\n27 09-56896 \r\n \r\ntherefore calls for the continued support of the \r\ninternational community in the process of integrating \r\nNEPAD into the structures and processes of a reformed \r\nAfrican Union. Furthermore, the advancement of the \r\nvarious programmes of NEPAD, such as the African \r\nPeer Review Mechanism and the Comprehensive \r\nAfrica Agriculture Development Programme, support \r\nfor the global strategic partnerships that are already \r\nimproving the investment scenario on the continent and \r\ncollaboration with, and support for, the Peace and \r\nSecurity Architecture of the African Union are critical \r\nfor success. Above all, there is an urgent need to \r\nprioritize the redemption of the promises of aid made \r\nto Africa at various international forums.  \r\n We firmly believe that an African continent in \r\nwhich hunger, poverty and disease are effectively \r\ncombated, basic infrastructure functions and conflicts \r\nmake way for peaceful coexistence is the continent to \r\nwhich we all aspire to meaningfully contribute to \r\nglobal peace and prosperity. \r\n Mr. Valero Briceño (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): I would like to thank \r\nthe President for convening this important meeting.  \r\n My delegation would like to associate itself with \r\nthe statement delivered by the representative of the \r\nSudan on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.  \r\n The fact that we are discussing the future of \r\nAfrica is a cause for hope. The Venezuelan people, \r\nwhich has roots in Africa, is comprised of an array of \r\ndifferent cultures that serve to make up our national \r\nidentity. We are therefore not indifferent to Africa’s \r\nfuture. We are committed to it.  \r\n The second summit of heads of State and \r\nGovernment from Africa and Latin America, which \r\nwas held from 26 to 27 September on the island of \r\nMargarita in Venezuela, was a major step towards \r\nexpanding South-South cooperation. Such cooperation \r\nhas taken on new urgency in the light of today’s \r\nunbridled savage capitalism, whose underpinnings \r\ninclude the exploitation, dispossession and subjugation \r\nof countries by other countries. That has been the \r\norientation of North-South relations. What is being \r\nproposed today is a new humanistic form of \r\ncooperation that is grounded in solidarity. \r\n At the Africa and South America summit, leaders \r\nfrom both regions committed themselves to fomenting \r\nSouth-South cooperation in order to create societies \r\nwhere social justice is the law of the land. It was also \r\nproposed to achieve sustainable economic growth, \r\ngenerate dignified work and promote social inclusion \r\npolicies through the effective participation of young \r\npeople, civil society and people with special needs, \r\nwhile at the same time taking the gender perspective \r\ninto consideration. They also committed themselves to \r\nensuring equality and mutual respect among States and \r\nto promoting economic cooperation while facilitating \r\nthe equitable distribution of benefits resulting from the \r\nexchange of goods and services.  \r\n With regard to national policies, the leaders \r\ncalled for increasing scientific knowledge and \r\ncapacities and for their transfer, namely, by bringing \r\ntogether the scientific communities of Africa and South \r\nAmerica, with a view to ensuring society’s ownership \r\nof scientific and technical understanding so as to \r\npromote educational and health opportunities and \r\nbetter living conditions for people. \r\n The Margarita summit took to a higher plane the \r\ninteraction between two regions that are seeking new \r\nhorizons to realize the ideals of justice and equality \r\nthat their peoples have sought since colonial times.  \r\n Venezuela attaches great importance to South-\r\nSouth cooperation in the context of its international \r\nrelations. We have signed more than 100 agreements \r\nwith various African countries. Those agreements, \r\nwhich are currently being implemented, were ratified at \r\nthe Africa-South America summit. Venezuela currently \r\nhas diplomatic relations with every country of the \r\nAfrican Union. Before President Chávez came to \r\npower, Venezuela barely had eight embassies in Africa. \r\nToday, we have 18. \r\n The Margarita summit called for the strengthening \r\nof the Bank of the South, which South American \r\ncountries have already set up and which will initially \r\nbe capitalized at $20 billion. The Bank will be able to \r\nestablish agreements with the African Development \r\nBank based on fairness and without the heinous \r\nconditionalities imposed by the Bretton Woods \r\ninstitutions.  \r\n President Chávez also called for promoting \r\nPetroSur and for the establishment of a research and \r\nimplementation coordinating body for energy projects \r\nin service of South America and Africa. PetroSur aims \r\nat establishing cooperation and integration mechanisms \r\nbased on complementarity, while fairly and \r\ndemocratically utilizing energy resources with a view \r\nA/64/PV.23  \r\n \r\n09-56896 28 \r\n \r\nto alleviating poverty and inequality. PetroSur also \r\naims to minimize the negative consequences on \r\ndeveloping countries caused by fluctuations in the \r\nprice of energy, which is mainly affected by \r\ngeopolitical factors and speculative variables. It also \r\nrecognizes the importance of promoting cooperation \r\nand strategic alliances between oil companies of the \r\ncountries of the South.  \r\n Also at the Africa-South America summit, the \r\nleader of the Bolivarian revolution stated that there is \r\nan urgent need to establish a university of the South. \r\nSuch an undertaking, which is deeply rooted in the \r\nspirit of liberation, could contribute to bridging the \r\nscientific and technological gap between developed \r\nand developing countries, as well as have a positive \r\nimpact on the countries of South America and Africa. \r\n The international community should resolutely \r\nsupport the countries of Africa to combat malaria, \r\nHIV/AIDS and other catastrophic illnesses. In that \r\n regard, it is crucial to ensure universal free access to \r\ntreatment for those illnesses, as we do in Venezuela. \r\nLikewise as we do in Venezuela, generic \r\npharmaceutical drugs to prevent and treat those \r\nillnesses should be manufactured under compulsory \r\nlicensing. It is immoral that multinational drug \r\ncompanies enrich themselves on people’s illness and \r\nsuffering. Human health cannot be a business. \r\n The United Nations must firmly commit itself to \r\nthe New Partnership for Africa’s Development. All \r\nAfrican countries must attain the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. This should be a challenge that \r\nevery country in the world rises to. The Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela reiterates its readiness to foster \r\nSouth-South cooperation and to fight side by side with \r\nAfrican peoples and Governments to attain the \r\ndevelopment they so deeply desire.  \r\nThe meeting rose at 6 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
