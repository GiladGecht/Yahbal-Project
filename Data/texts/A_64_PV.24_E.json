(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) \r\n \r\n \r\n In the absence of the President, Mr. Hackett \r\n(Barbados), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda items 63 and 47 (continued) \r\n \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development: progress \r\nin implementation and international support \r\n \r\n (a) New Partnership for Africa’s Development: \r\nprogress in implementation and international \r\nsupport \r\n \r\n  Reports of the Secretary-General (A/64/204 and \r\nA/64/208) \r\n \r\n (b) Causes of conflict and the promotion of durable \r\npeace and sustainable development in Africa \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/64/210) \r\n \r\n2001-2010: Decade to Roll Back Malaria in \r\nDeveloping Countries, Particularly in Africa \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/64/302) \r\n \r\n Mrs. Kafanabo (United Republic of Tanzania): \r\nThis year’s debate on rolling back malaria is \r\nparticularly important given that 2010 is the end of the \r\nDecade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing Countries, \r\nParticularly in Africa. We thus need to take stock of \r\nour achievements, challenges and the way forward to \r\nensure that we meet our 2010 goals. \r\n We thank the Secretary-General for his note on \r\nthis agenda item, and we commend his personal \r\ncommitment and efforts in the fight against malaria. \r\nWe align ourselves with the statements made by the \r\nSudan on behalf of the Group of 77 and China and by \r\nTunisia on behalf of the African Group. \r\n Malaria continues to place an unacceptable \r\nburden on health and economic development in \r\nTanzania, thus contributing to poverty and \r\nunderdevelopment. Malaria is the number one cause of \r\nmorbidity and mortality in Tanzania, with an estimated \r\n11 million cases and 80,000 deaths per year. Children \r\nunder five years of age and pregnant women, whose \r\nimmunity is low, represent the most vulnerable groups. \r\n We have, however, been able to reduce to zero \r\nthe deaths due to malaria in Zanzibar by undertaking \r\nresidual spraying on malarial mosquito breeding sites, \r\nproviding long-term insecticide treated nets at every \r\nbed site, early treatment for those infected with \r\nmalaria, and control and surveillance measures to \r\nprevent any re-emergence or epidemic. \r\n  The success in Zanzibar will, however, be very \r\nfragile if malaria is not contained on the mainland. \r\nMalaria is a disease that knows no boundaries, and the \r\nGovernment is thus mindful of keeping up surveillance \r\nefforts in Zanzibar to ensure that malaria does not \r\nre-emerge through transmission from the mainland. \r\n The Government of Tanzania is addressing the \r\nproblem of malaria through the implementation of our \r\nfive-year Medium-term Strategic Plan 2008-2013. The \r\nPlan has been developed in line with the Global \r\nMalaria Action Plan. The new Plan advocates a rapid \r\nscaling-up of interventions to reduce the burden of \r\nA/64/PV.24  \r\n \r\n09-56939 2 \r\n \r\nmalaria by 80 per cent from current levels by the end \r\nof 2013. \r\n Significant progress has been made in controlling \r\nmalaria. New and more effective medicines to treat \r\nmalaria, namely artemisinin combination therapy \r\n(ACT), are available in the public sector, which \r\nprovides 60 per cent of malaria treatment. ACT is \r\nhowever prohibitively expensive in the private sector, \r\nwhere 40 per cent of the population access medicines \r\nas their first point of contact. Measures to address the \r\naffordability of ACT in the private sector through the \r\nAffordable Medicine Facility for Malaria are in \r\nprogress. These have drawn lessons from a pilot \r\nprogramme that was done in collaboration with the \r\nClinton Foundation. \r\n The provision to vulnerable groups of highly \r\nsubsidized insecticide-treated nets through a discount \r\nvoucher system began in 2004 and is continuing. Some \r\n4.3 million nets have been purchased using the \r\nvoucher. The Government is now scaling up the \r\nprogramme to cover all children under five through a \r\ncampaign to deliver, free of charge, 7.2 million long-\r\nlasting insecticide-treated nets by March 2010. At the \r\nbeginning of 2010, the National Malaria Control \r\nProgramme will distribute an additional 14.6 million \r\nlong-lasting insecticide-treated nets to all sleeping \r\nplaces in the country free of charge, thus attaining \r\nuniversal coverage of insecticide-treated nets by the \r\nend of 2010. The ownership of mosquito nets has \r\nincreased significantly over the years, from less than \r\n15 per cent of households in 1999 to nearly 60 per cent \r\nby the end of 2007. \r\n Indoor residual spraying has also begun in \r\nselected districts where malaria is highly endemic or \r\nepidemic. In these districts, more than 90 per cent of \r\nhouseholds have been sprayed within the past 12 \r\nmonths, with dramatic results seen in the reduction of \r\nmalaria prevalence, anemia and the hospitalization of \r\nchildren in those areas. In this regard, a plan for the \r\nimplementation of indoor residual spraying by the year \r\n2010 has been developed. Due care is taken to ensure \r\nthat the environment is not contaminated. \r\n We are now experiencing the impact of these \r\ninterventions. There is a noticeable decline in the \r\nnumber of malaria cases, especially among children \r\nunder five. According to the Tanzania HIV/AIDS and \r\nMalaria Indicator Survey for 2007-2008, there has been \r\na significant decline in mortality for both infants and \r\nchildren under five years of age — from 99 per 1,000 \r\nin 1999 to 58 per 1,000, and, over the same period, \r\nfrom 147 per 1,000 to 91 per 1,000, respectively. \r\n The scale-up of malaria control interventions has \r\nno doubt contributed to this decline, as have other \r\nchildhood interventions such as the integrated \r\nmanagement of childhood illnesses, vitamin A \r\nsupplementation, immunizations, exclusive breastfeeding, \r\nzinc supplementation and oral rehydration therapy. \r\n Success in the fight against malaria can be \r\nattributed to both leadership and resources. African \r\nleaders in the continent have shown commitment and \r\nleadership in the fight against malaria. Our President, \r\nHis Excellency Jakaya Kikwete, is very committed in \r\nthe fight against malaria. During the general debate of \r\nthis Assembly session, President Kikwete chaired a \r\nmeeting that launched the Africa Leadership Malaria \r\nAlliance, a forum that will provide political leadership \r\nin the fight against malaria at the very highest level. \r\nWe thank the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General \r\nfor Malaria and his office for the support rendered \r\nduring the launch. \r\n Funding for malaria has seen a substantial \r\nincrease over the years. However, there is still a large \r\nresource gap. Our focus has thus been on prevention, \r\nas it is cheaper and easy to do. While access to prompt \r\neffective treatment is a key element to the success in \r\nfighting malaria, we have been unable to guarantee \r\naccess to treatment for the majority of our people, \r\nparticularly in the rural areas. In order to curb malaria, \r\nwe need effective treatment infrastructure, and this \r\nmeans access to a health-care facility that is adequately \r\nequipped and that has in place skilled health-care \r\nworkers who will make the diagnosis and administer \r\nmedication. This is our major challenge. \r\n The Government has embarked on a \r\ncomprehensive programme to deal with the question of \r\naccess to health care. The programme will ensure that \r\nthere is a dispensary in every village and a health-care \r\ncentre in every ward. This programme will certainly be \r\ninstrumental in the success of our anti-malaria effort, \r\nas it will guarantee prompt diagnosis and treatment. It \r\nis in this endeavour that we need partnerships and \r\nsupport from the international community. We thank \r\nthe bilateral and multilateral partners who have \r\nprovided us with financial and technical support, \r\nincluding Japan, the European Union, the World Health \r\nOrganization, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \r\n A/64/PV.24\r\n \r\n3 09-56939 \r\n \r\nTuberculosis and Malaria, the Roll Back Malaria \r\nPartnership, the President’s Malaria Initiative, the \r\nClinton Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates \r\nFoundation. We call for their continued support to \r\ncomplement the Government’s efforts in implementing \r\nthe malaria strategy and eradicating malaria in \r\nTanzania. \r\n In conclusion, allow me to reiterate the \r\ncommitment of the Government of Tanzania to work \r\ntowards achieving the 2010 goals we have set to roll \r\nback malaria. \r\n Mr. Sangqu (South Africa): I thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his reports (A/64/204, A/64/208, \r\nA/64/210 and A/64/302) on the items that we are \r\ndiscussing today: the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD); the causes of conflict and the \r\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable \r\ndevelopment in Africa; and the Decade to Roll Back \r\nMalaria in Developing Countries, Particularly in \r\nAfrica. \r\n South Africa aligns itself with the statements \r\nmade by the Sudan, on behalf of the Group of 77 and \r\nChina, and by Tunisia, on behalf of the African Group. \r\n The adoption of NEPAD by the African Union in \r\n2001 was the affirmation by Africa of a shared vision, \r\nconviction and pledge by its leaders to place African \r\ncountries, both collectively and individually, on a path \r\nto sustainable economic growth and development and \r\nto halt the marginalization of Africa in the \r\nglobalization process.  \r\n The key priorities for NEPAD, as Africa’s socio-\r\neconomic blueprint for development, remain viable \r\ninfrastructure, agricultural development and \r\ninformation and communications technology \r\nconnectivity, among others. In this regard, NEPAD has, \r\nover the years, focused on developing programmes and \r\nbankable projects, mainly in these areas.  \r\n The key challenge that NEPAD continues to face \r\nis lack of funding and resources for its effective \r\nimplementation. We believe that early implementation \r\nof major projects and mobilization and injection of \r\nresources in these sectors will spur development and \r\nenhance regional integration of African economies. \r\nNEPAD and regional integration are the cornerstones \r\nof the strategy for the economic rejuvenation and \r\nprosperity for our continent. It is therefore for this \r\nreason that the implementation of NEPAD programmes \r\nat all levels needs to be enhanced. \r\n As we have heard from many others in the \r\ndeveloping world, the lack of funding has been \r\ncompounded by the impact of the global financial and \r\neconomic crisis, which has been severe in emerging \r\nand low-income countries, especially those in sub-\r\nSaharan Africa. Africa played no role in causing this \r\ncrisis and yet it bears the brunt of its impact. \r\n Given this reality, many African countries are \r\nstruggling to meet the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) due to, among other reasons, a lack of \r\nresource flows. To this end, Africa resolved to \r\nundertake the necessary measures to enhance the \r\ndevelopment of expanded and integrated national \r\ndevelopment plans and related policies, and fast-track \r\nthe adoption of NEPAD programmes, which include \r\nreforms and increased investments in key areas such as \r\nagriculture, infrastructure, health, human resource \r\ndevelopment and education, as a means of achieving \r\nthe MDGs. \r\n We continue to commend the work done by the \r\nUnited Nations in support of Africa’s special \r\ndevelopment needs. We believe that a lot still needs to \r\nbe done by the United Nations to ensure that the \r\ninternational community remains mobilized to \r\ncollectively implement the commitments made to \r\nAfrica. \r\n In this regard, we believe that the Office of the \r\nSpecial Advisor to the Secretary-General on Africa \r\nneeds to be further strengthened to continue its critical \r\nrole in mobilizing the entire United Nations family and \r\nits organs, agencies and funds to mainstream the \r\nobjectives of NEPAD and the achievement of the \r\nMDGs into their programmes and funding for Africa. \r\nThe United Nations should continue to raise awareness \r\nand promote NEPAD among stakeholders, including \r\ndonors, civil society and the private sector. This \r\nadvocacy role is particularly important at this juncture, \r\nwhen international partners, who are dealing with the \r\nconsequences of the financial crisis on their own \r\neconomies, increasingly find themselves looking \r\ninwards. \r\n Africa’s economic development is inextricably \r\nlinked to the global economic structure. In this regard, \r\nSouth Africa looks forward to the early conclusion of \r\nthe Doha round of negotiations, focusing on its \r\nintended and agreed development agenda. \r\nA/64/PV.24  \r\n \r\n09-56939 4 \r\n \r\n The pursuit of peace, stability and security on the \r\ncontinent cannot be separated from the pursuit of \r\njustice, self-determination, human rights and economic \r\ndevelopment. My delegation therefore concurs with the \r\nSecretary-General when he states in his report that:  \r\n “the determination of Africa’s peoples to work \r\ntowards peace and development has driven many \r\nof the successes and encouraging developments \r\nduring the reporting period”. (A/64/210, para. 70) \r\n Africa has, in the past few decades, made \r\ncommendable progress in working to end conflicts and \r\npromote democracy and development on the continent. \r\n The African Union is in the process of \r\nimplementing its African Peace and Security \r\nArchitecture, including the Peace and Security \r\nCouncil, Continental Early Warning System, Panel of \r\nthe Wise and African Peer Review Mechanism, and \r\nthese efforts should be supported by the United Nations \r\nand the entire international community. \r\n Despite these commendable efforts, the continent \r\nis still vulnerable to the effects of unconstitutional \r\nchange in government, lack of transparent electoral \r\nsystems, climate change, rapid urban growth, youth \r\nunemployment, drug trafficking and food insecurity, all \r\nof which could lead potentially to open conflict. As \r\nnoted in the report of the Secretary-General, the global \r\neconomic and financial crises have threatened the \r\nlivelihoods, well-being and development opportunities \r\nof millions of people and have exacerbated political \r\nand social tensions. \r\n On the issue of climate change, it is well \r\ndocumented that Africa, the continent that contributes \r\nthe least to global warming, will suffer \r\ndisproportionately in terms of its economic impact. \r\nAfrica’s ability to deliver on its fundamental \r\ndevelopmental priorities is being undermined by the \r\nimpact of climate change, and it is therefore critical to \r\nsecure an agreement on a comprehensive international \r\nadaptation programme as a priority outcome of the \r\ncurrent international negotiations on climate change. \r\nCopenhagen must deliver an outcome that is binding, \r\nfair, just and effective, one that balances adaptation and \r\nmitigation while also balancing development \r\nimperatives with those of climate change. During those \r\nnegotiations, the international community must give \r\nserious consideration to questions relating to financing \r\nfor mitigation and adaptation, technology transfer and \r\nbuilding human and institutional capacity. \r\n My delegation welcomes the deepening of \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nAfrican Union at all levels and reiterates the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s call for the international community to invest \r\nin mechanisms aimed at preventing conflict and \r\nsupporting partners in the field of conflict prevention, \r\nconflict management, peacekeeping and peacebuilding. \r\nIt is only by addressing the deep-rooted causes of \r\nconflict and appropriately addressing the nexus \r\nbetween peace and development that durable and \r\nsustainable peace can be secured. \r\n In his related report to the General Assembly and \r\nthe Security Council entitled “Support to African \r\nUnion peacekeeping operations authorized by the \r\nUnited Nations” (A/64/359-S/2009/470), the Secretary-\r\nGeneral characterizes the role of the African Union in \r\nsupporting the prevention, management and resolution \r\nof conflicts under Chapter VIII of the United Nations \r\nCharter as a “welcome development”. In that important \r\nreport the Secretary-General makes critical \r\nrecommendations on how the United Nations and the \r\ninternational community could further ensure the \r\nsustainability and predictability of Africa’s \r\npeacekeeping efforts. It is my delegation’s strong view \r\nthat the General Assembly could contribute \r\nsignificantly to building Africa’s peacekeeping facility \r\nand financing by considering and acting on the \r\nrecommendations of the Secretary-General. The \r\nSecurity Council will be debating the same report on \r\n26 October. \r\n We wish to once again commend the General \r\nAssembly for proclaiming the period 2001-2010 the \r\nDecade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing Countries, \r\nParticularly in Africa. \r\n We welcome and commend the initiative taken by \r\nAfrican leaders called Malaria Alliance to protect all \r\nthose at risk of the scourge of malaria. Those efforts \r\nseek to complement measures undertaken by Member \r\nStates that have committed to increase Government \r\nspending on health. The progress towards that goal is \r\nslow but progressive, as more and more countries \r\nincrease their budget allocation to the health sector. \r\n Since 2001, several initiatives to increase funding \r\nfor malaria control have emerged to complement our \r\nGovernment expenditure on health and other bilateral \r\nand multilateral arrangements in individual countries. \r\nWe call for the implementation of all commitments \r\n A/64/PV.24\r\n \r\n5 09-56939 \r\n \r\nmade to Africa on health, in particular those geared to \r\nfighting the scourge of malaria in Africa. \r\n South Africa supports private initiatives to \r\naddress global health challenges and expresses its \r\nsupport for the work of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \r\nTuberculosis and Malaria. \r\n At a national level, South Africa is committed to \r\nthe implementation of its Comprehensive Plan for the \r\nTreatment, Management and Care of HIV and AIDS so \r\nas to reduce the rate of new HIV infections by 50 per \r\ncent by the year 2011 and to reach 80 per cent of those \r\nin need of anti-retroviral treatment by 2010. \r\n South Africa reiterates the call by the African \r\nSummit to Roll Back Malaria that development \r\npartners should cancel in full the debt of poor and \r\nheavily indebted countries in Africa in order to release \r\nresources for poverty alleviation programmes. \r\nInvesting in Africa’s economic and social development, \r\npromoting human rights and strengthening its peace \r\nand security capacity will go a long way towards \r\nensuring durable and sustainable peace in Africa. \r\n Africa is a continent where a billion people live, a \r\ncontinent that stood midwife to humanity, a continent \r\nthat, despite its many challenges, is rich in \r\nopportunities and pregnant with endless possibilities. \r\nAfrica has much to offer. Together, we can unlock the \r\nvast economic potential of that continent as we \r\ncontinue in this forward-looking trajectory. Failure is \r\nnot an option. History will not judge us by the lofty \r\nideals we have for Africa but by what we do today in \r\nensuring a better, safer, prosperous and peaceful \r\nAfrica. \r\n Mr. Al Habib (Islamic Republic of Iran): At the \r\noutset, my delegation would like to align itself with the \r\nstatement made by the representative of the Sudan on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China (see A/64/PV.22). \r\n With regard to the very important agenda items of \r\ntoday’s deliberations, it is worth noting that the \r\nunderlying causes of problems in Africa cannot be \r\novercome simply by increasing the level of aid or \r\nofficial development assistance. If we are truly looking \r\nfor a solution for sustainable economic growth and \r\npeace and stability in Africa, the lack of a conducive \r\ninternational environment and chronic, lingering \r\nsystematic shortcomings have to be effectively \r\naddressed. Taking into account the fact that Africa is \r\nthe only continent not on track to meet the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) by 2015, special attention \r\nshould be paid to the issues of providing adequate \r\nfinancial assistance and trade opportunities for Africa \r\nto favour its sustainable growth and the eradication of \r\npoverty and preventable diseases. \r\n In this context, we regard the 2010 United \r\nNations MDG summit as an opportune occasion to take \r\nstock of the existing gaps and to identify the measures \r\nneeded for the timely achievement of the MDGs. \r\nBringing those targets and regions that lag behind back \r\non the track to success should be the main focus of the \r\nsummit and its outcome. To this end, Africa should \r\nreceive adequate and immediate funding and attention. \r\nAccordingly, the unconditional and urgent fulfilling of \r\ncommitments made is crucial. \r\n The Islamic Republic of Iran, in the spirit of \r\nSouth-South cooperation, has put Africa at the top of \r\nits international development cooperation programmes. \r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran allocated a total of  \r\n$50 million to financial assistance in grants to Africa \r\nduring the period from 2005 to 2008. A growing trend \r\ncan be seen in the assistance figures during that period, \r\nwhich increased from $4.5 million in 2005 to  \r\n$24 million in 2008. In the past year, 14 African \r\ncountries received assistance. Additionally, the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran provided $9 million to three African \r\ncountries for the eradication of malaria within the \r\nframework of the Organization of the Islamic \r\nConference. Furthermore, 10 hospitals belonging to \r\nIran’s Red Crescent Society continue to provide \r\nmedical services almost free of charge in a number of \r\nAfrican countries. Taking into account the importance \r\nof human resource development, the Government of \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran has granted several \r\nscholarships for African students in Iranian \r\nuniversities. \r\n We support the ongoing efforts of African \r\ncountries to achieve their aspirations and economic \r\ndevelopment, and we welcome the encouraging \r\nprogress achieved in different parts of the continent. \r\nHowever, we are concerned about the consequences of \r\nthe financial and economic crisis, which occurred, as \r\nthe report of the Secretary-General notes, at the most \r\nunfortunate time. Given the reliance of many African \r\ncountries on the export of a few commodities, the crisis \r\ncontinues to take a heavy toll on Africa. \r\n The response of the international community to \r\nthe challenge that Africa is facing in ensuring that the \r\nA/64/PV.24  \r\n \r\n09-56939 6 \r\n \r\ncrisis does not reverse the progress made should \r\ncomplement the national policies of African countries \r\nand assist their implementation. In addressing the \r\nglobal financial crisis, adequate attention should be \r\npaid to the systemic and structural problems at the \r\nglobal level. And at the same time, the special needs of \r\nAfrica have to be taken into account, particularly in the \r\nareas of trade, funding, infrastructure and peace and \r\nsecurity. \r\n Mr. Shin Boonam (Republic of Korea): The \r\nRepublic of Korea is pleased to participate in the joint \r\ndebate on the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) and health issues in Africa. \r\nOne year after the high-level meeting on Africa’s \r\ndevelopment needs (see A/63/PV.3 and A/63/PV.4), we \r\nwelcome the opportunity to continue making progress. \r\n While Africa has made steady progress, it is \r\ndisproportionately affected by the current multiple \r\ncrises. As a result, it requires additional efforts and \r\nassistance. In particular, official development \r\nassistance (ODA) must grow, even if the global \r\nfinancial crisis discourages donor countries from \r\nmaintaining current levels of aid. The Republic of \r\nKorea has already affirmed its commitment to triple its \r\nODA by 2015. \r\n Development cooperation with Africa should be \r\nfirmly based on country-specific needs and requests. \r\nTo enhance our understanding of Africa’s development \r\nneeds, the Republic of Korea has been running several \r\nhigh-level dialogue channels. As mentioned in the \r\nSecretary-General’s report (A/64/208), the Ministerial \r\nConference on Economic Cooperation between the \r\nRepublic of Korea and Africa held last October \r\npromoted exchanges of economic development \r\nexperiences and dialogue on the development issues of \r\nmutual interest. In addition, the Korea-Africa Forum, \r\nsince its inception in 2006, has served as an avenue for \r\ncooperation among Governments, businesses and civil \r\nsociety in Korea and Africa. The second round of the \r\nmeeting will be jointly held with the African Union in \r\nSeoul next month. We anticipate the Forum will further \r\ncontribute to the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment. \r\n The high-level development cooperation between \r\nthe Republic of Korea and Africa is now complemented \r\nby village and ground-level support. Through the \r\nMillennium Village Project, which now operates in \r\nmore than 80 villages in sub-Saharan Africa, we are \r\nproviding financial support and technical assistance \r\nbased on accumulated knowledge from our own rural \r\ndevelopment experience. The Millennium Village \r\nProject provides local ownership, as it depends on \r\nleadership and implementation by the communities on \r\nthe ground in Africa. The Republic of Korea believes \r\nthat the focus of the Millennium Village Project on \r\ngrass-roots efforts will help Africa achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\n To support grass-roots efforts for Africa, we also \r\nsend a great number of Korean volunteers to Africa and \r\ninvite African trainees to share our development \r\nexperiences. In particular, the Republic of Korea will \r\ndraw on the comparative advantage of its advanced \r\ninformation and communication technologies, thus \r\nbolstering Africa’s economic and social development \r\nby narrowing the digital gap. \r\n Our own experiences have demonstrated the \r\nsuccess of export-based development. As a result, we \r\nunderstand that trade policy also plays an important \r\nrole in Africa’s integration into the global economy. \r\nUltimately, there is no one-size-fits-all solution to \r\nimprove trade in Africa in a short time, but Aid for \r\nTrade and adequate national strategies will eventually \r\nenhance the competitiveness of African countries. We \r\nalso believe that successful conclusion of the Doha \r\nRound will foster development in Africa and, \r\nconsequently, the growth of global trade. \r\n Africa’s population remains vulnerable to a wide \r\nrange of health issues, including HIV/AIDS and \r\nmalaria, but we have the means to respond. The Global \r\nFund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, \r\nalong with many other institutions and stakeholders, \r\nhas done a great deal, but the financing for health \r\ndevelopment assistance is still not sufficient. \r\n For its part, the Republic of Korea introduced an \r\nair-ticket solidarity levy, which is primarily earmarked \r\nfor combating diseases and achieving MDGs in Africa. \r\nSuch innovative development resources that go beyond \r\ntraditional ODA can have a significant impact on \r\nmeeting our MDG targets. \r\n The Republic of Korea would like to offer \r\ncongratulations on the progress in NEPAD’s \r\nimplementation during the past year. We look forward \r\nto seeing additional progress in Africa, particularly in \r\nthe areas of infrastructure and basic health and \r\neducation, as recommended by the Secretary-General \r\nin his report (A/64/204). The Republic of Korea was \r\n A/64/PV.24\r\n \r\n7 09-56939 \r\n \r\nable to overcome development obstacles by investing \r\nheavily in those fields and fully supports measures that \r\nwould allow Africa to implement them. \r\n As I conclude my remarks, let me reiterate the \r\ncommitment of the Republic of Korea to working with \r\nAfrica to confront development challenges facing it. It \r\nis in our common interest to help Africa achieve \r\nsustainable and more equitable development through \r\nan enhanced development partnership. \r\n As the saying goes, “Good company on the road \r\nis a shortcut”. The Republic of Korea will be good \r\ncompany on the road to Africa’s development. \r\n Mr. Khan (Pakistan): At the outset my delegation \r\nwishes to align itself with the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of the Sudan on behalf of the Group of \r\n77 and China (see A/64/PV.22). \r\n The two complementary reports of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on agenda item 63 (A/64/204 and A/64/208) \r\ncontend that despite the global financial and economic \r\ncrisis and its negative impact, some progress has been \r\nachieved in the implementation of the New Partnership \r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD). The first of those \r\nreports also notes that the main challenge now for \r\nAfrican countries is to ensure that the financial crisis, \r\ncombined with the latent food and energy crisis, does \r\nnot reverse the progress made in Africa and reduce the \r\nrisk of increasing poverty and hardship for the most \r\nvulnerable groups. \r\n We strongly believe that the way forward for \r\nmeeting Africa’s development needs requires more \r\nintense, coordinated, balanced and integrated actions in \r\norder to effectively implement the development \r\ncommitments made by the international community to \r\ncomprehensively address all challenges to Africa’s \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n In our view, an urgent and well-coordinated \r\nglobal action would help mitigate the socio-economic \r\nimpact of the crisis and help African countries recover \r\nground in their progress towards the implementation of \r\nNEPAD and the achievement of internationally agreed \r\ndevelopment goals, including the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). Clearly, the international \r\ncommunity has to scale up its efforts in order to meet \r\nall its commitments towards generating the resources \r\nneeded to achieve sustainable development and \r\nsustained economic growth in Africa. \r\n Pakistan strongly feels that further bolstering \r\ninvestments, expanding trade by allowing greater \r\nmarket access to exports from Africa, and building \r\ncapacity and human resources are the most important \r\ntools for putting Africa on the fast track for \r\ndevelopment. Those tools, we believe, should be the \r\nthree main pillars for a strategic partnership between \r\nAfrica and the rest of the world. \r\n Pakistan has consistently supported the political \r\nand economic aspirations of Africa. We support \r\neffective and early implementation of the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development. We have \r\nactively supported and contributed to efforts to \r\npromote durable peace and sustainable development in \r\nAfrica. Durable peace can be achieved only through a \r\ncomprehensive strategy that includes conflict \r\nprevention, addressing the root causes of conflict and \r\nstrengthening long-term capacities for peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes, peacemaking and peacekeeping; \r\nand sets up a coherent system-wide response to post-\r\nconflict peace-building, reconstruction and \r\ndevelopment. In this regard, United Nations \r\npeacekeeping is an indispensable tool for restoring \r\npeace and stability in conflict situations and has \r\nparticularly proved its utility and effectiveness in the \r\nAfrican continent. \r\n Pakistan is committed to supporting the United \r\nNations peace efforts in Africa. Our contribution comes \r\nin the form of a contingent of nearly 10,000 troops, \r\nwhich continues to be among the two largest \r\ncontingents deployed in Africa over the last decade. \r\n Pakistan also has an Africa plan for trade \r\ndevelopment, and its bilateral trade with countries of \r\nthe continent today reaches nearly $1.8 billion a year. \r\nFurthermore, we provide bilateral assistance in the \r\neconomic, social and technical spheres to a number of \r\nAfrican countries in the context of South-South \r\ncooperation. In particular, Pakistan has been \r\nsuccessfully running the Special Technical Assistance \r\nProgramme for Africa since 1986. Under that \r\nprogramme hundreds of young African professionals \r\nfrom both the public and private sectors have received \r\ntraining in different fields, including public \r\nadministration, management, banking, customs, \r\naccounting and diplomacy. \r\n We are in the process of further expanding the \r\nscope and scale of our assistance and cooperation \r\nprogrammes for Africa. Our Prime Minister has \r\nA/64/PV.24  \r\n \r\n09-56939 8 \r\n \r\nexpressed his desire to help Africa replicate \r\nprogrammes focused on the eradication of hepatitis-C \r\nand schemes for providing safe drinking water and \r\nlow-cost housing, which are being carried out as his \r\nspecial initiatives in Pakistan. \r\n I wish to conclude by saying that the challenges \r\nfaced by Africa are colossal. But the opportunities, \r\nmeans and resources to address them are also immense, \r\nthough they must be harnessed effectively. NEPAD \r\npresents a realistic framework for action. The African \r\nUnion is emerging as a dynamic factor promoting \r\nAfrican ownership in tackling Africa’s problems. The \r\nsubregional organizations in Africa are also playing an \r\nimportant role. We are confident that with \r\ncommensurate political will on the part of the \r\ninternational community, in particular the developed \r\nworld, to faithfully implement the commitments made, \r\nAfrica can hope to realize its full political and \r\neconomic potential. \r\n Mr. Zinsou (Benin) (spoke in French): My \r\ndelegation would like to express through me its high \r\ncommendation of the admirable fashion in which the \r\nPresident is conducting the Assembly’s deliberations at \r\nits sixty-fourth session and to thank him for organizing \r\nthis joint debate on the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD), the causes of conflict and the \r\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable \r\ndevelopment in Africa, and the implementation of the \r\n2001-2010 Decade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing \r\nCountries, Particularly in Africa. \r\n In 2001, the African heads of State and \r\nGovernment adopted NEPAD to endow the continent \r\nwith a coherent and harmonized development \r\nframework that would allow Africa to regain the \r\ninitiative in its endeavours to bring about an economic \r\nupswing by harnessing the conception and \r\nimplementation of the actions it requires, while \r\npledging to develop an effective and efficient \r\npartnership with the international community in order \r\nto achieve that goal. We thank the Secretary-General \r\nfor the four reports he has produced on these issues, \r\nwhich take stock of the progress achieved in pursuing \r\nthe objectives of NEPAD and the Decade and which \r\nallow us a comprehensive view of the interactions of \r\nthe issues of concern regarding the evolution of the \r\nsituation in Africa. It is an extremely instructive \r\nexercise in which my delegation willingly takes part.  \r\n It is a fact that with NEPAD Africa has \r\nestablished clear priorities, as well as coherent \r\nstrategic guidance for the efforts needed to bring about \r\nits development. The African countries have thereby \r\nshouldered the requirement of responsible partnership \r\nwith the international community. The lines of action \r\ndecided upon are manifold, but two of them seem to be \r\nthe most dynamic and the most conducive to restoring \r\neconomic and social progress in Africa — namely, the \r\npromotion of agriculture and the development of \r\ninfrastructure.  \r\n These are two areas of activity that require \r\nsubstantial investment and call for the mobilization of \r\nsubstantial technical and financial support from \r\npartners in development.  \r\n Several initiatives have been taken to bolster the \r\ncapacity to manage the changes required in Africa, \r\njudging by the plethora of seminars and workshops \r\norganized at various levels on issues related to \r\nNEPAD. Those initiatives create conditions conducive \r\nto investment. The joint endeavours undertaken in this \r\ncontext must be continued without letting up in order \r\nto maintain the dynamic and to maximize their \r\nmultiplying effects for all African economies. \r\n My delegation would like to stress the appeal \r\nlaunched by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Benin \r\nfrom this very rostrum during the general debate, at the \r\n8th meeting, for the establishment of an investment \r\nfund under the auspices of the United Nations and the \r\nAfrican Union in order to carry out continent-wide \r\ninfrastructure projects in Africa in the context of an \r\ninnovative public-private partnership in order to rise to \r\nthe serious challenges posed for Africa by climate \r\nchange. Such an investment fund could be financed \r\nthrough the adaptation funds established at the Bali \r\nConference, held in December 2007.  \r\n The serious threats that climate change is posing \r\nto the progress made in promoting development in \r\nAfrica must be brought under control in order to \r\nprotect the achievements and preserve the momentum \r\nin the cumulative process of creating wealth, which can \r\nonly lead to development.  \r\n With regard in particular to strengthening peace \r\nand security in Africa as a precondition for all \r\neconomic and social progress, despite the significant \r\npositive advances as a result of the efforts undertaken \r\nto strengthen the capacities of the international \r\ncommunity to effectively prevent conflicts, it is clear \r\n A/64/PV.24\r\n \r\n9 09-56939 \r\n \r\nthat there are significant challenges to overcome. We \r\nreiterate the Secretary-General’s call on Africa’s \r\npartners to help put in place useable and effective \r\nmediation means. That would help to bolster the \r\noutstanding efforts made by the United Nations and the \r\nAfrican Union to halt wars and crises on the continent. \r\nBenin is proud to have made a significant contribution \r\nto those efforts.  \r\n Above and beyond that approach of strengthening \r\ncapacities, when it comes to implementing the 10-year \r\nplan to assist the African Union, the international \r\ncommunity would also do well to step up its efforts to \r\nbring about more effective control over the underlying \r\nstructural causes of conflict, whose continued existence \r\nserves to undermine the continent and increase the \r\nlikelihood that new conflicts will break out. That \r\nwould entail increasing systemic and structural \r\nprevention efforts by supporting economic and social \r\nreforms and the fight against external factors that have \r\na negative impact on the situation in African countries \r\nwhen it comes to the maintenance of peace and \r\nsecurity.  \r\n Efforts under way to combat the proliferation of \r\nsmall arms and light weapons should also be \r\nintensified. There is nothing more pernicious than \r\ncyclical instability, which the Secretary-General has \r\nrightly underscored has a negative impact on progress \r\ntowards peace and development.  \r\n Countries participating in the African Peer \r\nReview Mechanism deserve special attention from the \r\nUnited Nations with regard to the support they should \r\nbe given in implementing the recommendations \r\nemanating from that process, especially when it comes \r\nto taking concrete steps to emerge from the situations \r\nof risk that are identified. \r\n In ensuring access to basic services for \r\nmarginalized communities, we are not only providing \r\nthe services themselves, we are contributing to peace \r\nand security. We should continue to pay crucial \r\nattention to supporting efforts to provide water and \r\nelectrical services in rural and suburban areas, as well \r\nas access to basic health care and school costruction, as \r\neffective ways of ensuring that all citizens can improve \r\ntheir social conditions. It is therefore crucially \r\nimportant that we combat unemployment, especially \r\namong young people, as well as fight organized crime, \r\nwhich increases insecurity in both the countryside and \r\nin cities. \r\n Those issues have been the focus of special \r\nattention in the context of the efforts made to achieve \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. We welcome the \r\nmomentum towards that end, which should not be \r\nhampered by virtue of the successive crises that have \r\ntaken place in recent years. We urge donor countries to \r\ncontinue their support for programmes that have a \r\ndirect impact on people’s living conditions.  \r\n  The President took the Chair. \r\n \r\n We agree with the Secretary-General that, for \r\ntheir part, African countries should make the necessary \r\nefforts to honour the commitments they have \r\nundertaken when it comes to the share of national \r\nbudgets to be devoted to financing efforts in the areas \r\nof health and promoting agriculture, as well as in \r\nparticular related areas such as locally processing \r\nagricultural products to increase their added value and \r\nthe revenue they produce. \r\n The policies of Benin’s Government are firmly \r\ngrounded in that philosophy, especially when it comes \r\nto agriculture. The Government of Benin fully endorses \r\nthe major areas for priority action that have been \r\nidentified by the NEPAD secretariat, namely, \r\nstrengthening human resources, providing agricultural \r\ninputs, including seeds and fertilizer, land reform and \r\nprotecting the rights of agricultural workers. Those \r\npriorities were taken into consideration in developing \r\nthe strategic outline that was adopted by the \r\nGovernment of Benin to promote rural development in \r\nour country. \r\n In that connection, our Government has just held \r\na round table on the financing of our national \r\nagricultural investment programme, which is based on \r\nconcerted agricultural policies at the continental level \r\nin the context of a detailed African agricultural \r\ndevelopment programme. Its goal is to reduce poverty \r\nthrough growth, improve food security by increasing \r\nproduction and maintaining an appropriate and secure \r\nproduction environment as the impetus for the \r\ndignified  development of an emerging economy. \r\nAgriculture in Benin is responsible for 36 per cent of \r\ngross domestic product, 75 to 90 per cent of our export \r\nincome, 15 per cent of State revenues and 70 per cent \r\nof all jobs.  \r\n The round table, which was organized with the \r\nsupport of both NEPAD and the Economic Community \r\nof West African States, aimed at producing consensus \r\namong the various stakeholders with regard to the \r\nA/64/PV.24  \r\n \r\n09-56939 10 \r\n \r\nprovisions of the national agricultural investment \r\nprogramme, identifying which partners were to be \r\nsupported and, above all, mobilizing resources to \r\nproduce real investments destined for the agricultural \r\nsector. \r\n We would like to pay tribute to friendly countries \r\nthat have supported the efforts of the Government of \r\nBenin in this field, especially India, a country with \r\nwhich our Government is developing an agricultural \r\nmechanization programme at the national level. The \r\nopportunities that exist for South-South cooperation \r\nand for the launching of triangular cooperation in this \r\narea must be exploited. However, the efforts that have \r\nbeen made will not be successful unless meaningful \r\nprogress is made in resolving the issue of agricultural \r\nsubsidies. As the Assembly is aware, that continues to \r\nbe a stumbling block in the Doha Round of multilateral \r\ntrade negotiations.  \r\n There is good reason to commend the progress \r\nmade with regard to the Decade to Roll Back Malaria. \r\nHowever, we are still far from achieving the goals that \r\nhave been set. The political will that has been \r\nmanifested by affected countries, which was recently \r\nillustrated once again by the establishment of the \r\nAfrican Leaders Alliance against Malaria, has been \r\nstymied by the low level of necessary financing that \r\nhas been mobilized to ensure full coverage of the \r\npopulation. The observations contained in the report of \r\nthe Secretary-General (A/64/302) leave no doubt that \r\nreal challenges continue to exist when it comes to the \r\nquality of infrastructure to diagnose and adequately \r\ntreat malaria. \r\n The international community must do everything \r\npossible to save the lives of the millions of people who \r\ndie every year from bouts of malaria. Those deaths \r\ncould be prevented through the comprehensive use of \r\nexisting tools. We should continue to pay particular \r\nattention to the issue of the parasite’s resistance to \r\ninsecticides and antimalarial medicines. However, \r\nthere is also reason to celebrate. In particular, we \r\nshould commend those countries which have already \r\nreached the targets set for 2010, and the other countries \r\non the way to successfully eradicating this disease, an \r\nachievement which will make an important \r\ncontribution to improving conditions for sustainable \r\ndevelopment in those countries. \r\n The complexity of the challenges facing Africa \r\ncalls for more coherent and coordinated action, as \r\nhighlighted by the report of the United Nations Joint \r\nInspection Unit entitled “Towards more coherent \r\nUnited Nations system support to Africa” \r\n(JIU/REP/2009/5). We support the recommendations \r\naimed at improving the division of labour among the \r\norganizations of the United Nations system with a view \r\nto achieving the operational coherence needed to be \r\neffective. Regional coordination mechanisms must be \r\nestablished as soon as possible, while the capacity of \r\nthe Economic Commission for Africa to take action \r\nshould be strengthened with a view to bolstering its \r\nability to provide strategic support to regional African \r\ninstitutions and Governments. \r\n In this context, there is a need to safeguard the \r\ncapacity of African Governments to harness \r\nmechanisms for defining national priorities and to \r\nensure that they are fully coordinated, while seeking to \r\nbring about harmonious integration in national plans \r\nand regional and subregional strategies and \r\nprogrammes. This would create the conditions for \r\nresults-based management, which can serve as a \r\nguarantee of the effectiveness of efforts to promote \r\npeace, stability and sustainable development. \r\n Mr. Swe (Myanmar): I wish to begin by thanking \r\nthe Secretary-General for his seventh consolidated \r\nreport regarding the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) (A/64/204). My delegation is \r\npleased to learn from the report that, despite the \r\nfinancial and economic crisis which has affected \r\ncountries large and small, some progress was still \r\nachieved in the implementation of NEPAD. This is \r\nreassuring, but much more needs to be done to mitigate \r\nthe adverse affects of the crisis, especially on low-\r\nincome countries, to prevent the risk of increasing \r\npoverty and misery for the most vulnerable groups. \r\n My delegation associates itself with the \r\nstatements made by the representative of the Sudan, on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China, and by the \r\nrepresentative of Thailand, on behalf of Association of \r\nSoutheast Asian Nations, on the need to take concerted \r\naction to ensure the successful implementation of \r\nNEPAD and the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) in Africa. \r\n For several years, the Assembly has been \r\nconsidering progress in the implementation of NEPAD \r\nand international support for the programme. We \r\nwelcome this practice. It is an effective means for the \r\ninternational community to take stock of the situation \r\n A/64/PV.24\r\n \r\n11 09-56939 \r\n \r\nand to provide NEPAD the prominence it deserves on \r\nthe global development agenda. \r\n The international community’s attention and \r\nfocus on addressing Africa’s development needs has \r\nbeen demonstrated by the various high-level meetings \r\non Africa in the past year. A number of key messages \r\nhave already emerged from these high-level meetings. \r\nFirst, in order to generate broad-based, equitable and \r\nsustainable growth, more intense and coordinated \r\naction is required to implement the commitments \r\nmade. The international community must live up to its \r\ncommitments on assistance to Africa, in particular as the \r\ncrisis has underscored the need to guard against back-\r\nsliding in the implementation of key socio-economic \r\ndevelopment programmes. \r\n Secondly, it is essential to help African countries \r\nbuild their capacity. They have made tremendous \r\nefforts to take development into their own hands by \r\nimproving their governing capabilities and increasing \r\ntheir capacity and potential for development. The \r\ninternational community should complement these \r\nefforts by offering African countries favourable \r\nconditions in debt relief, market access and technology \r\ntransfer to help them overcome development obstacles. \r\nIn the field of the global economy, it is important to \r\nprovide African countries with an enabling external \r\nenvironment for their development. \r\n Thirdly, emergency aid and debt relief, as well as \r\nconcessional lending, should be increased to mitigate \r\nthe adverse effects of the global crisis, in particular as \r\nthe global financial and economic downturn has placed \r\nadditional burdens on African countries. Official \r\ndevelopment assistance flows, increased debt relief and \r\nlending by the international financial institutions \r\ntherefore remain essential. \r\n Fourthly, in addition to urgently fulfilling all \r\nofficial development assistance commitments, new and \r\nadditional financial resources should be made available \r\nto address adaptation needs arising from the effects of \r\nthe  global crisis. In this context, the proposal made by \r\nthe World Bank to design a special stabilization and \r\ndevelopment fund for Africa is positive. \r\n Fifthly, sustained and more intensive efforts are \r\nneeded to achieve long-term debt sustainability. The \r\nrecommendations of the MDG Africa Steering Group \r\npresent a comprehensive picture of the progress made \r\nin promoting sustainable development in Africa over \r\nthe past few years. However, formidable challenges \r\nremain. In this regard, we welcome actions focused on \r\nsupporting African regional and subregional \r\norganizations, including the Common Market for \r\nEastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), the Southern \r\nAfrican Development Community (SADC) and the \r\nEast African Community (EAC), under the COMESA-\r\nSADC-EAC Harmonization Process. There is also \r\nconcern relating to the financial and human resources \r\nrequired to solve Africa’s interlinked multidimensional \r\nproblems. It is clear that the international community \r\nmust scale up its efforts in order to meet all \r\ncommitments to generate the resources required for \r\nachieving the MDGs. \r\n To conclude, the challenges faced by Africa are \r\nformidable, but the opportunities, means and resources \r\nto address those challenges are immense. NEPAD \r\npresents a realistic framework for action. The African \r\nUnion is emerging as a main force in promoting \r\nAfrican ownership for solving Africa’s problems. The \r\nsubregional organizations in Africa are also playing an \r\nimportant role. The international community must play \r\nits part and fulfil the commitments made so that Africa \r\ncan realize its full economic and political potential. \r\n Mr. Tommo Monthe (Cameroon) (spoke in \r\nFrench): My delegation associates itself with the \r\nstatements made by the representatives of Tunisia and \r\nthe Sudan, on behalf of the Group of African States and \r\nthe Group of 77 and China, respectively, on the agenda \r\nitems under consideration, namely 63 (a) and (b). \r\n We should also like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the quality of the reports presented under \r\nthis agenda item this year (A/64/204, A/64/208 and \r\nA/64/210). They reflect the range of measures \r\nundertaken by the African organizations and countries, \r\nthe international community and, in particular, by the \r\norganizations of the United Nations system in the \r\nstrategic domains defined by the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) and by the various \r\nUnited Nations resolutions relating to the promotion of \r\nsustainable peace and development in Africa. By \r\nadopting NEPAD in 2001, African countries were \r\nendeavouring to devise a plan, or more specifically, a \r\nvision, of realistic development drawn up by African \r\nthemselves, determined to take charge of their own \r\ndevelopment in order to helping the continent \r\novercome its lack of development. \r\n From this standpoint, strategic priorities were \r\ndefined in the following fields: infrastructure, \r\nA/64/PV.24  \r\n \r\n09-56939 12 \r\n \r\nagriculture and food security, health, education and \r\ntraining, the environment, information and \r\ncommunication technologies, science and other \r\ntechnologies, gender equality, female empowerment, \r\ncivil society participation, and an intra-African review \r\nmechanism. In all those fields, the Secretary-General’s \r\nreports underscore the progress achieved, and we \r\nwelcome this, especially when it comes to the gradual \r\nintegration of NEPAD within African Union structures \r\nand processes.  \r\n In Central Africa, NEPAD has allowed the \r\nEconomic Community of Central African States \r\n(ECCAS) to lay the foundation for the development of \r\npriority infrastructure in order to accelerate regional \r\nintegration, to contribute to economic growth as well \r\nas to reduce poverty in member States. \r\n The transportation sector is one where the most \r\nimportant actions have been taken. Developments \r\ninclude the consensual master plan for transportation in \r\nCentral Africa and a priority network that involves 55 \r\nprojects. Among those projects is the filling in of the \r\nmissing links in trans-African routes crossing Central \r\nAfrica, NEPAD priority projects, the laying down of all \r\nof the inter-capital routes among States, as well as the \r\nmain transportation infrastructure which supports \r\ninternational trade of States in the subregion, that is, \r\nthe main ports, international airports, railways, and a \r\nlakes and rivers transportation network. Heads of State \r\nor Government of the subregion set up a committee to \r\nmonitor the implementation of all of those \r\nprogrammes. \r\n For its part, Cameroon has established certain \r\nstructures to support NEPAD projects. Institutionally, \r\nfor example, the President of the Republic monitors at \r\nthe highest level NEPAD, as well as the Africa Peer \r\nEvaluation Mechanism. Cameroon is a member of the \r\nNEPAD Steering Committee. In this context, a \r\ndepartment was set up within the Foreign Ministry and \r\nfocal points in charge of NEPAD issues have also been \r\nappointed in various sectgorial ministries. \r\n Our Government has also adopted a set of \r\nmeasures geared towards reducing poverty and \r\nimproving the living conditions of our population. \r\nThose measures include free primary education, \r\nimprovements in health care options, and fighting \r\nagainst rising costs through a price-stabilization policy. \r\n As can be seen, important strides have been \r\nachieved. It is clear that NEPAD is fully underway, and \r\nwe have moved from words to plans to projects to \r\nconcrete actions. At the same time, we should not be \r\nblinded to certain difficulties which prevent a more \r\nextensive implementation of NEPAD. There is, in \r\nparticular, a certain sluggishness when it comes to the \r\nlevel and pace of efforts which are required. \r\n For example, while $25 billion in additional \r\nannual aid is expected by 2010 for the African \r\ncontinent, only $12.5 billion has been disbursed thus \r\nfar. The gap between what has been promised and what \r\nis actually being done is widening. Another example is \r\nthat sustained annual growth of 7 per cent for over 10 \r\nyears is required for viable development, but the \r\nmajority of African countries do not meet that \r\nrequirement. \r\n Given that situation, vigorous corrective \r\nmeasures are necessary. First of all, the repeated \r\npromises made by Africa’s development partners must \r\nbe fulfilled. The continent itself must step up its efforts \r\nto mobilize resources for NEPAD programmes and \r\nprojects. Additional efforts must also be made to speed \r\nup the multilateral negotiations under way, specifically, \r\nthose of the Doha Round, in order to establish an \r\ninternational environment which is more conducive to \r\nAfrica’s development. The contributions of various \r\nUnited Nations bodies must be subject to more \r\nrigorous and strategic planning which would encourage \r\nmore specific and periodically measurable goals.   \r\n Here, the Office of the Special Adviser to the \r\nSecretary-General on Africa, as well as ECCAS, have \r\nleading roles to play in marshalling international \r\nopinion and resources, in coordinating the efforts, as \r\nwell as the contributions, of various parties at the \r\nglobal, regional and subregional levels and in the \r\nongoing assessment of those results. In other words, \r\nthe road ahead is still filled with challenges and must \r\nprompt even more efforts for, dedication and solidarity \r\nto Africa. \r\n With respect to governance and to peace and \r\nsecurity, the reports submitted by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral have also mentioned the progress that has been \r\nachieved with respect to the African Peer Review \r\nMechanism and strengthening the African Union Peace \r\nand Security Council and the capacity of the continent \r\nto conduct peacekeeping operations and calm conflict \r\nzones. However, those concerns continue because of \r\nongoing or new sources of tension or conflict. \r\n A/64/PV.24\r\n \r\n13 09-56939 \r\n \r\n We believe that the search for solutions in this \r\narea must be coordinated around preventive diplomacy \r\nto prevent situations from getting worse and leading to, \r\nin turn, incalculable additional costs. Here, we \r\ncongratulate the Secretary-General for his decision to \r\nestablish a permanent office of the United Nations in \r\nCentral Africa in response to the unanimous appeal \r\nmade by countries in the subregion. \r\n Cameroon has always expressed its preference for \r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes, but where conflict \r\nhas broken out, our country has made its contribution \r\nto the restoration and maintenance of peace through \r\nour participation in peace mechanisms. \r\n Thus, we have provided the United Nations with \r\nseveral special representatives and we are also \r\ninvolved in peacekeeping operations in Cambodia, \r\nNamibia, Burundi, Rwanda, Chad, the Central African \r\nRepublic, Guinea-Bissau, the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo and Haiti. Our country currently welcomes \r\n84,000 refugees and a great number of displaced \r\npersons due to conflict and instability in Central \r\nAfrica.  \r\n Finally, we would like to stress that with the \r\ncurrent global financial, energy, climate and food \r\ncrises, the development of Africa is, once again, at a \r\ncrossroads. Selfishness and the Afro-pessimism of the \r\n1980s threaten us even as we harbour the hope for a \r\nbetter future, a future made possible by the modern \r\ninstruments available to help us overcome poverty. It is \r\ncertainly up to the African continent itself to make \r\nchoices and to take decisive steps, but our development \r\npartners are just as certainly called upon to realize their \r\noften-repeated promises to Africa.  \r\n In a world increasingly interdependent only an \r\nongoing combination of efforts will be able to \r\nequitably rebuild the interests of each and every one of \r\nus. \r\n The President: I now give the floor to the \r\nobserver of The Observer State of the Holy See. \r\n Archbishop Migliore (Holy See): In \r\ncongratulating the Secretary-General for his report on \r\nthe New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD) (A/64/204), my delegation would like to \r\noffer some remarks on the overall situation in Africa. \r\n First of all, there are certain prejudices that must \r\nbe eliminated once and for all. Often, when one speaks \r\nabout Africa, both journalistically and at the academic \r\nor political level, one speaks of extreme poverty, coups \r\nd’état, corruption and regional conflicts. Also, when \r\nspeaking positively of Africa, it is always about the \r\nfuture of Africa, as if it had nothing to offer at the \r\npresent time. \r\n The reality is that Africa, even in its most \r\ndifficult years, has been able to provide the \r\ninternational community examples and values worthy \r\nof admiration and, today, Africa can also offer signs of \r\nfulfilment of many of its hopes. Just think about the \r\nvarious cases in which Africa has proven its great \r\ncapacity to manage the processes of transition to \r\nindependence or reconstruction after situations of \r\nconflict. Consider too, the presence of so many valiant \r\nofficials in the United Nations and United Nations \r\nagencies through which Africa shows the world the \r\ncapability and talents of her people to manage the \r\nmultilateral sector. Think also of the increasing \r\ncontribution of the sons and daughters of Africa to the \r\nscientific, academic and intellectual life of the \r\ndeveloped countries. \r\n Some African countries have succeeded in \r\nrealizing the dream of a diversified agriculture, which \r\nobtains results that were up to this point considered \r\nimpossible. They have proven that family farming, \r\neven on a very small scale, can actually be \r\nmultifunctional, capable of ensuring countries’ food \r\nsecurity and even generating export balance, while \r\nmanaging the conservation of land and natural \r\nresources. What is more, many African countries have \r\nmade impressive strides in the field of elementary \r\neducation and improving the situation of women. \r\n It remains true, nevertheless, that most of the \r\npeople living in extreme poverty are in Africa and that \r\nthe eradication of poverty and hunger, reducing by half \r\nthe proportion of people whose income is less than $1 \r\na day by 2015, is beyond the reach of most African \r\ncountries.  \r\n Africa needs, therefore, a hands-on, tangible \r\nsolidarity, not only to cope with the negative impacts \r\nof its crises, but to help eradicate the unacceptable \r\nscourge of poverty and make available to other \r\ncountries Africa’s true potential. Africa requires a \r\nstrong reinforcement of its basic economic support, \r\nwhich consists of official development assistance and \r\ngrants for eradicating extreme poverty and for the \r\ncreation and maintenance of basic social structures. \r\nLong-term financing programmes are needed to \r\nA/64/PV.24  \r\n \r\n09-56939 14 \r\n \r\novercome the external debt of the highly indebted poor \r\ncountries, to consolidate economic and constitutional \r\nsystems and to create social security networks. Likewise, \r\ninternational trade practices have to adapt to Africa’s \r\npeculiar needs and economic challenges. \r\n In the current crisis, developed countries should not \r\nreduce their development aid to Africa; on the contrary, \r\nthey should embrace a farsighted vision of the world and \r\nthe world economy and move to increase their \r\ninvestments in poor countries and those who live there. In \r\nthe same vein, Africa needs support for its agricultural \r\nprogrammes. In addressing food insecurity, due \r\nconsideration must be given to structural systems, such as \r\nsubsidies in developed countries and commodity \r\ndumping, which drive down the ability of African farmers \r\nto make a living. In addition, the long decline in \r\ninvestment in the agricultural sector in Africa must be \r\nreversed and a renewed commitment to assisting family \r\nfarmers to provide sustainable food production must be \r\nundertaken. Failure to assist Africans to feed themselves \r\nand their neighbours will only result in continued \r\nsenseless loss of life from inadequate food security and \r\nincreased conflict over natural resources. \r\n Africa also needs support in diversifying its \r\neconomies. Recently, the world observed, both in a \r\npositive and negative manner, the institutionalization of \r\nthe Group of 20 as a strong point of reference to manage \r\nthe world economy.  \r\n The positive aspect is that the large industrialized \r\ncountries have felt the need to call to the negotiating table \r\nmajor emerging markets of the South. The involvement of \r\nemerging or developing countries now makes it possible \r\nto better manage the crisis. The negative aspect carries the \r\nrisk of excluding small countries from participating in \r\nthose important discussions. However, one notes that the \r\nemerging economies that will have an influence on \r\npolitics and the world economy are those that have \r\nsucceeded, to a greater or lesser extent, in diversifying \r\ntheir industrial and agricultural production. \r\n Finally, Africa needs integration support. NEPAD \r\nand all regional and subregional initiatives of trade, \r\neconomic and cultural cooperation, conflict management, \r\npeacekeeping and reconstruction should be promoted and \r\nstrengthened. The African Union has proven to be a \r\nstrong focal point for connecting Africa with the United \r\nNations and the international financial and trade \r\norganizations. Similarly, the African Union acts as a point \r\nof convergence in coordinating the many subregional \r\nmultilateral initiatives in Africa.  \r\n The integrated economy of the present day does not \r\nmake the role of States redundant, but instead commits \r\ngovernments to greater collaboration with one another. \r\nThe articulation of political authority at the local, national \r\nand international levels is one of the best ways of giving \r\ndirection to the process of economic globalization. \r\n The President: In accordance with General \r\nAssembly resolution 49/2 of 19 October 1994, I now call \r\non the observer for the International Federation of Red \r\nCross and Red Crescent Societies. \r\n Mr. Jilani (International Federation of Red Cross \r\nand Red Crescent Societies): As we approach the \r\nconcluding stages of the Roll Back Malaria 2010 targets \r\nof universal coverage for all populations at risk, the \r\nInternational Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent \r\nSocieties (IFRC) reaffirms its commitment to work in \r\npartnership towards achieving those targets. We are very \r\nactive as part of the global Roll Back Malaria Partnership \r\nconstituency. Also, the IFRC chairs the Alliance for \r\nMalaria Prevention, a partnership of more than 30 \r\norganizations including government, business, faith-based \r\nand humanitarian organizations. Furthermore, National \r\nRed Cross and Red Crescent Societies, as auxiliaries to \r\ntheir public authorities, are active in Africa, consistent \r\nwith the strategies outlined by the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development, but also in parts of Asia, the \r\nCaribbean and South America.  \r\n The IFRC malaria programmes are focused on \r\nscaling up insecticide-treated net ownership and ensuring \r\nthat net distribution is accompanied by extensive and \r\nprolonged community education and empowerment \r\nefforts. Follow-on “hang up” campaigns carried out by \r\nRed Cross/Red Crescent-trained volunteers in the \r\ncommunity significantly reduce the incidence of malaria, \r\nas not only our own data but also a Centers for Disease \r\nControl and Prevention survey confirm.  \r\n Combining distribution with follow-on support and \r\ntraining is especially crucial in order to reach the most \r\nvulnerable groups, such as those living in remote areas, \r\nrefugees and people affected by stigma and \r\ndiscrimination. Trained Red Cross and Red Crescent \r\nvolunteers who live in the very same community and \r\nspeak the same local language are ideally placed to help \r\nfamilies to overcome social or cultural barriers that may \r\nprevent the effective hanging and use of nets. \r\n A/64/PV.24\r\n \r\n15 09-56939 \r\n \r\n Last August, the IFRC and the American Red Cross \r\nstaff, working together with the Mozambique Red Cross \r\nSociety, carried out a survey of mosquito net usage \r\nfollowing mass distribution and a hang-up campaign in \r\nMozambique’s Nampula Province. In that campaign, \r\nMozambique Red Cross volunteers went from door to \r\ndoor, verifying that beneficiaries were hanging the nets \r\nproperly. The survey focused on two districts targeted by \r\nhang-up intervention groups, compared with two districts \r\nin which the Red Cross was active as a control group. The \r\nfindings confirmed that mass distribution raised net \r\nownership from very low levels to more than 70 per cent \r\nin a very short time. Otherwise, 48 per cent of the \r\nhouseholds visited in the intervention group had their nets \r\nhanging, compared to only 31 per cent in the control \r\ngroup.  \r\n The key message of the Red Cross and the Red \r\nCrescent is that communities must own the activities that \r\nsupport prevention. To increase ownership, families must \r\nhave the support necessary to understand the transmission \r\nof malaria, prevention through nets and treatment. The \r\nIFRC will replicate and expand hang-up campaigns and \r\nwill team up with partners to accelerate the delivery of \r\nnets. \r\n Lastly, the IFRC also includes a malaria component \r\nin its emergency response activities when disasters occur \r\nin malaria-endemic areas or where epidemics are possible \r\nas a result of disaster. \r\n The President: The debate that we have just \r\nconcluded has been a strong demonstration of goodwill, \r\nsolidarity and support for Africa. Over two days, Member \r\nStates and regional groups have reaffirmed their support \r\nfor Africa’s development objectives and, particularly, for \r\nthe New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), \r\nthe continent’s blueprint to achieve those objectives. \r\n The debate was a timely opportunity to review \r\nprogress in the implementation of and international \r\nsupport for NEPAD and to identify the ways and means \r\nof addressing the challenges. Many delegations spoke of \r\nprogress in NEPAD priority areas, such as infrastructure, \r\nagriculture, health and education, and highlighted the \r\nchallenges faced by Africa in attaining the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. While acknowledging Africa’s \r\nprimary responsibility for its own development, member \r\nStates renewed calls for strengthening international \r\npartnership to accelerate that process. In that regard, the \r\nimportance of South-South cooperation and Africa’s \r\nstrategic partnerships was highlighted. \r\n African delegations outlined the efforts made to \r\nadvance the priorities of NEPAD, as well as to tackle the \r\nchallenges of peace and security, emphasizing in that \r\nregard the role of the African Union, regional \r\norganizations and the United Nations. Some \r\nrepresentatives welcomed the progress made in the \r\nintegration of NEPAD into the African Union structure \r\nand process. The African Peer Review Mechanism was \r\nwidely praised. \r\n Among the many challenges confronting Africa, the \r\nimpact of the food, fuel and economic crises, climate \r\nchange, HIV/AIDS and other diseases, transnational \r\norganized crime, narcotic drug trafficking, and the need to \r\nimprove the status of women were particularly stressed. \r\nMany expressed their concern and dismay at the \r\ncontinuing toll of malaria in Africa and in developing \r\ncountries elsewhere. We heard a number of specific \r\nproposals to address those challenges. \r\n It is widely acknowledged that while Africa’s own \r\nreform efforts must be sustained, the international \r\ncommunity must also provide the necessary support in \r\nterms of investment, trade, debt relief and official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA). Africa’s development \r\npartners were called upon to meet their ODA pledges, \r\nparticularly the Gleneagles commitment to double aid to \r\nAfrica by 2010, and the long-standing commitment of \r\nmany developed countries to increase ODA to 0.7 per \r\ncent of gross national income.  \r\n Several representatives called for the \r\nimplementation of the political declaration on Africa’s \r\ndevelopment needs (resolution 63/1), adopted at the high-\r\nlevel meeting on 22 September 2008, whereby the \r\ninternational community recommitted itself to \r\nreinvigorating and strengthening a global partnership of \r\nequals. Several delegations mentioned the calls for a \r\nmonitoring mechanism to review the full and timely \r\nimplementation of all commitments related to African \r\ndevelopment. \r\n In the light of the debate, it is my sincere hope that \r\nthe international community will continue to stand with \r\nAfrica and to follow up on its pledges in support of Africa \r\nin order to help attain from the international partnership \r\nmore tangible results on the ground for the benefit of the \r\npeople of Africa.  \r\n I thank all members for their contribution and \r\nparticipation. \r\n The Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of agenda items 63 and 43. \r\nThe meeting rose at 11.50 a.m. \r\n"
