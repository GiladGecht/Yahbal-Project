(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 110 (continued) \r\n \r\nElections to fill vacancies in principal organs \r\n \r\n (b) Election of eighteen members of the Economic \r\nand Social Council  \r\n \r\n  Letter dated 15 October 2009 from the \r\nPermanent Representative of the United \r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern \r\nIreland to the United Nations addressed to the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly (A/64/493)  \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The Assembly \r\nwill first proceed to a by-election to elect four \r\nmembers of the Economic and Social Council, in \r\naccordance with rule 140 of the rules of procedure. \r\n In this connection, I would first like to draw the \r\nattention of members to document A/64/493, \r\ncontaining the text of a letter dated 15 October 2009 \r\nfrom the Permanent Representative of the United \r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the \r\nUnited Nations, as Chairman of the Group of Western \r\nEuropean and other States for the month of October \r\n2009. In his letter, the Chairman announces that New \r\nZealand, Sweden, Greece and Portugal would like to \r\nrelinquish their seats on the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil at the end of the year 2009 for the remainder \r\nof their terms in favour of Australia, Finland, Malta \r\nand Turkey, respectively. As a result, four vacancies \r\nwill occur and four new members must therefore be \r\nelected to fill the unexpired terms of office of New \r\nZealand and Sweden, commencing on 1 January 2010 \r\nand expiring on 31 December 2010, as well as of \r\nGreece and Portugal, commencing on 1 January 2010 \r\nand expiring on 31 December 2011. \r\n In accordance with paragraph 4 of General \r\nAssembly resolution 2847 (XXVI) of 20 December \r\n1971, and taking into account that the vacancies will \r\noccur from among the Western European and other \r\nStates, the new members should therefore be elected \r\nfrom that region. \r\n I should like to inform the Assembly that the \r\ncandidates who receive a two-thirds majority, and the \r\ngreatest number, of votes by members present and \r\nvoting will be declared elected. May I take it that the \r\nGeneral Assembly agrees to that procedure? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): In accordance \r\nwith rule 92 of the rules of procedure, the election shall \r\nbe held by secret ballot and there shall be no \r\nnominations. We shall now proceed accordingly. \r\n I should like to inform members that, as of \r\n1 January 2010, the following States from the Group of \r\nWestern European and other States will be represented \r\non the Economic and Social Council: France, Germany, \r\nLiechtenstein, Norway and the United Kingdom of \r\nGreat Britain and Northern Ireland. The names of those \r\nfive States should therefore not appear on the ballot. \r\n Before we begin the voting process, I should like \r\nto remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the \r\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly, no \r\nA/64/PV.25  \r\n \r\n09-57629 2 \r\n \r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a \r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting. \r\n We shall now begin the voting process. Members \r\nare requested to remain seated until all ballots have \r\nbeen collected. \r\n Allow me to remind members that, at this stage, \r\nthey are voting in the by-election for four seats for \r\nWestern European and other States. The election of the \r\n18 members of the Council will take place immediately \r\nfollowing this by-election. \r\n Ballot papers will now be distributed. I request \r\nrepresentatives to use only those ballot papers and to \r\nwrite on them the names of the four States for which \r\nthey wish to vote. A ballot will be declared invalid if it \r\ncontains the names of more than four Member States \r\nfrom the relevant region for the four vacant seats \r\nassigned to it. A ballot will also be declared invalid if \r\nnone of the names of the Member States on that ballot \r\nbelongs to the relevant region. \r\n At the invitation of the President, Ms. Bensmail \r\n(Algeria), Mr. Babić (Croatia), Mr. Jatmiko \r\n(Indonesia), Mr. Løvold (Norway), Ms. Ovcharenko \r\n(Russian Federation), Mrs. Aparici (Spain), \r\nMrs. Mchárek Hadiji (Tunisia) and Ms. Anzola \r\nPadrón (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) acted as \r\ntellers. \r\n A vote was taken by secret ballot.  \r\n  The meeting was suspended at 10.30 a.m. and \r\nresumed at 11.10 a.m. \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The result of \r\nthe voting is as follows: \r\n Group B – Western European and other States \r\n(4 seats) \r\nNumber of ballot papers:    186 \r\nNumber of invalid ballots:        0 \r\nNumber of valid ballots:    186 \r\nAbstentions:          4 \r\nNumber of members voting:   182 \r\nRequired two-thirds majority:   122 \r\nNumber of votes obtained: \r\n Finland      148 \r\n Malta      147 \r\n Turkey      147 \r\n Australia      146 \r\n Italy         29 \r\n United States of America     29 \r\n Canada        29\r\n Belgium        28 \r\n Austria          1 \r\n Monaco          1 \r\n Luxembourg         1 \r\n Having obtained the required two-thirds majority, \r\nAustralia, Finland, Malta and Turkey have thus been \r\nelected members of the Economic and Social Council \r\nfor a term of office beginning on 1 January 2010. The \r\nterms of Australia and Finland will end on \r\n31 December 2010, and the terms of Malta and Turkey \r\nwill end on 31 December 2011.  \r\n I congratulate Australia, Finland, Malta and \r\nTurkey on having been elected members of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council. \r\n The General Assembly will next turn to the \r\nelection of 18 members of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil to replace those members whose term of office \r\nexpires on 31 December 2009. The 18 outgoing \r\nmembers are: Algeria, Barbados, Belarus, the \r\nPlurinational State of Bolivia, Canada, Cape Verde, \r\nEl Salvador, Indonesia, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Luxembourg, \r\nMalawi, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Romania, \r\nSomalia, the Sudan and the United States of America. \r\nPursuant to rule 146 of the rules of procedure, those \r\ncountries are eligible for immediate re-election. \r\n Members will recall that New Zealand, Sweden, \r\nGreece and Portugal relinquished their seats on the \r\nEconomic and Social Council, effective 1 January \r\n2010, and that Australia, Finland, Malta and Turkey \r\nhave just been elected to fill those vacancies.  \r\n Consequently, as of 1 January 2010, the \r\nfollowing States will be represented on the Economic \r\nand Social Council: Australia, Brazil, Cameroon, \r\nChina, the Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Estonia, Finland, \r\nFrance, Germany, Guatemala, Guinea-Bissau, India, \r\nJapan, Liechtenstein, Malaysia, Malta, Mauritius, \r\nMorocco, Mozambique, Namibia, the Niger, Norway, \r\nPakistan, Peru, Poland, the Republic of Korea, the \r\nRepublic of Moldova, the Russian Federation, Saint \r\nKitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the \r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, \r\nUruguay and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. \r\nThe names of those 36 States should therefore not \r\nappear on the ballots. \r\n In accordance with paragraph 4 of General \r\nAssembly resolution 2847 (XXVI) of 20 December \r\n A/64/PV.25\r\n \r\n3 09-57629 \r\n \r\n1971, and taking into account the number of States that \r\nwill remain members of the Council after 1 January \r\n2010, the 18 members should be elected as follows: \r\nfive from African States, four from Asian States, two \r\nfrom Eastern European States, three from Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean States and four from Western \r\nEuropean and other States. The ballot papers reflect \r\nthat pattern. \r\n I should like to inform the Assembly that those \r\ncandidates, their number not exceeding the number of \r\nseats to be filled, who receive a two-thirds majority, \r\nand the greatest number, of votes by members present \r\nand voting will be declared elected. In the case of a tie \r\nvote for a remaining seat, there will be a special \r\nrestricted ballot limited to those candidates that have \r\nobtained an equal number of votes. \r\n May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to \r\nthat procedure? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): In accordance \r\nwith rule 92 of the rules of procedure, the election shall \r\nbe held by secret ballot, and there shall be no \r\nnominations. \r\n Regarding candidatures of the respective regional \r\nGroups, the Secretariat has been informed that for the \r\nfive vacant seats from among the African States, the \r\nGroup has endorsed five candidates: the Comoros, \r\nGhana, Egypt, Rwanda and Zambia. For the four \r\nvacant seats from among the Asian States, the Group \r\nhas endorsed four candidates: Bangladesh, Iraq, \r\nMongolia and the Philippines. For the two vacant seats \r\nfrom among the Eastern European States, the Group \r\nhas endorsed two candidates: Slovakia and Ukraine. \r\nFor the three vacant seats from among the Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean States, the Group has \r\nendorsed three candidates: Argentina, the Bahamas and \r\nChile. For the four vacant seats from among the \r\nWestern European and other States, the Group has \r\nendorsed four candidates: Belgium, Canada, Italy and \r\nthe United States of America.  \r\n In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of \r\nprocedure, we shall now proceed to the election by \r\nsecret ballot. \r\n Before we begin the voting process, I should like \r\nto remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the \r\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly, no \r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a \r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting. \r\n We shall now begin the voting process. \r\n Ballot papers marked A, B, C, D and E will now \r\nbe distributed. I request representatives to use only \r\nthose ballot papers and to write on them the names of \r\nthe States for which they wish to vote. \r\n A ballot will be declared invalid if it contains \r\nmore names of Member States from the relevant region \r\nthan the number of seats assigned to it. A ballot will \r\nalso be declared invalid if none of the names of the \r\nMember States on that ballot belongs to the relevant \r\nregion. If a ballot paper of a region contains some of \r\nthe names of the Member States that do not belong to \r\nthat region, the ballot remains valid, but only the \r\nnames of the Member States that belong to the relevant \r\nregion will be counted. The names of Member States \r\nthat do not belong to that region will not be counted at \r\nall. \r\n At the invitation of the President, Ms. Bensmail \r\n(Algeria), Mr. Babić (Croatia), Mr. Jatmiko \r\n(Indonesia), Mr. Løvold (Norway), Ms. Ovcharenko \r\n(Russian Federation), Mrs. Aparici (Spain), \r\nMrs. Mcháreck Hadiji (Tunisia) and Ms. Anzola \r\nPadrón (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) acted as \r\ntellers. \r\n A vote was taken by secret ballot. \r\n  The meeting was suspended at 11.35 a.m. and \r\nresumed at 12.35 p.m. \r\n \r\n The President: The result of the voting is as \r\nfollows: \r\n Group A – African States (5 seats) \r\n Number of ballot papers:    188 \r\n Number of invalid ballots:        0 \r\n Number of valid ballots:    188 \r\n Abstentions:          0 \r\n Number of members voting:   188 \r\n Required two-thirds majority:   126 \r\n Number of votes obtained: \r\n  Ghana      183 \r\n   Comoros       182 \r\n  Zambia      180 \r\n  Rwanda      178 \r\n  Egypt      177 \r\n Group B – Asian States (4 seats) \r\n Number of ballot papers:    188 \r\nA/64/PV.25  \r\n \r\n09-57629 4 \r\n \r\n Number of invalid ballots:        0 \r\n Number of valid ballots:    188 \r\n Abstentions:          0 \r\n Number of members voting:   188 \r\n Required two-thirds majority:   126 \r\n Number of votes obtained: \r\n  Bangladesh     185 \r\n  Mongolia       185 \r\n  Philippines     185 \r\n  Iraq       182 \r\n Group C – Eastern European States (2 seats) \r\n Number of ballot papers:    188 \r\n Number of invalid ballots:        0 \r\n Number of valid ballots:    188 \r\n Abstentions:           6 \r\n Number of members voting:   182 \r\n Required two-thirds majority:   122 \r\n Number of votes obtained: \r\n  Ukraine      182 \r\n  Slovakia      181 \r\n Group D – Latin American and Caribbean States \r\n(3 seats) \r\nNumber of ballot papers:    188 \r\nNumber of invalid ballots:         0 \r\nNumber of valid ballots:    188 \r\nAbstentions:          3 \r\nNumber of members voting:   185 \r\nRequired two-thirds majority:   124 \r\nNumber of votes obtained: \r\n Chile      183 \r\n Bahamas      182 \r\n Argentina      181 \r\n Dominican Republic        1 \r\n Group E – Western European and other States \r\n (4 seats) \r\n Number of ballot papers:    188 \r\n Number of invalid ballots:         0 \r\n Number of valid ballots:    188 \r\n Abstentions:           5 \r\n Number of members voting:   183 \r\n Required two-thirds majority:   122 \r\n Number of votes obtained: \r\n  Italy       179 \r\n  Belgium      177 \r\n  Canada      174 \r\n  United States of America   174 \r\n Having obtained the required two-thirds majority \r\nof members present and voting, the following 18 States \r\nhave thus been elected members of the Economic and \r\nSocial Council for a three-year term beginning on \r\n1 January 2010: Argentina, the Bahamas, Bangladesh, \r\nBelgium, Canada, Chile, the Comoros, Egypt, Ghana, \r\nIraq, Italy, Mongolia, the Philippines, Rwanda, \r\nSlovakia, Ukraine, the United States of America and \r\nZambia.  \r\n I congratulate the States which have been elected \r\nmembers of the Economic and Social Council, and I \r\nthank the tellers for their assistance in this election. \r\n This concludes our consideration of sub-item (b) \r\nof agenda item 110. \r\nThe meeting rose at 12.40 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
