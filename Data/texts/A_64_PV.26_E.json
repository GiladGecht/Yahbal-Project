(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda items 7 and 135 (continued) \r\n \r\nOrganization of work, adoption of the agenda and \r\nallocation of items \r\n \r\nPattern of conferences \r\n \r\n  Letter from the Chairman of the Committee  \r\non Conferences (A/64/348/Add.1) \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): Members are \r\naware that, pursuant to section 1, paragraph 7, of \r\nresolution 40/243, of 18 December 1985, no subsidiary \r\norgan of the General Assembly should be permitted to \r\nmeet at United Nations Headquarters during the main \r\npart of a regular session of the Assembly, unless \r\nexplicitly authorized by the Assembly. \r\n Members will recall that at its 1st plenary \r\nmeeting, on 15 September 2009, the General Assembly \r\nauthorized a number of subsidiary organs to meet \r\nduring the main part of the regular session of the \r\nAssembly. Authorization is now sought for the United \r\nNations Forum on Forests and the Executive Board of \r\nthe United Nations Development Programme and the \r\nUnited Nations Population Fund to meet during the \r\nmain part of the sixty-fourth session of the General \r\nAssembly, on the strict understanding that meetings \r\nwould have to be accommodated within available \r\nfacilities and services.  \r\n May I take it that it is the wish of the General \r\nAssembly to authorize the United Nations Forum on \r\nForests and the Executive Board of the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme and the United Nations \r\nPopulation Fund to meet during the main part of the sixty-\r\nfourth session of the General Assembly in New York? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n \r\nAgenda items 42 and 48 (continued) \r\n \r\nReport of the Economic and Social Council \r\n \r\n  Report of the Economic and Social  \r\nCouncil (A/64/3) \r\n \r\n  Notes by the Secretary-General (A/64/207  \r\nand A/64/335) \r\n \r\nIntegrated and coordinated implementation of and \r\nfollow-up to the outcomes of the major United \r\nNations conferences and summits in the economic, \r\nsocial and related fields \r\n \r\n  Reports of the Secretary-General (A/64/87  \r\nand A/64/263) \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): In connection \r\nwith agenda item 48, I would like to remind the \r\nmembers of the General Assembly that, pursuant to \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 57/270 B, of 3 July 2003, \r\nthe Assembly, on the recommendation of the General \r\nCommittee, decided at its 2nd plenary meeting, on \r\n18 September 2009, to consider the chapters of the \r\nannual report of the Economic and Social Council \r\nrelevant to the integrated and coordinated \r\nimplementation of and follow-up to the outcomes of \r\nthe major United Nations conferences and summits, \r\nincluding the participation of the President of the \r\nCouncil in its discussion. \r\nA/64/PV.26  \r\n \r\n09-57817 2 \r\n \r\n At the same meeting, with regard to agenda item \r\n42, the Assembly took note of the clarification that, in \r\nimplementing resolution 58/316, the relevant parts of \r\nchapter I of the report of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil that are under agenda items already allocated \r\nto the Main Committees will be considered by the \r\nCommittee concerned for final action by the General \r\nAssembly.  \r\n I now give the floor to Her Excellency Ms. Sylvie \r\nLucas, President of the Economic and Social Council, \r\nto introduce the Council’s report. \r\n Ms. Lucas (Luxembourg), President of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council (spoke in French): I have \r\nthe honour to introduce the 2009 report of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council, which is contained in \r\ndocument A/64/3. \r\n The most severe global financial crisis since the \r\nGreat Depression has had devastating effects on the \r\nworld economy. We have noted that progress towards \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) has \r\nslowed, and even reversed. The adverse impacts could \r\nbe long-lasting and damaging for human development. \r\nThe Council’s work this year is generally centred on \r\nthe overall effort to help countries overcome the crisis. \r\nMy comments will focus first on some of the main \r\noutcomes of the Council’s work to date, and then on \r\nareas for future action. \r\n The 2009 annual ministerial review focused on \r\nglobal public health. The review provided major \r\npolitical impetus for the implementation of global \r\npublic health goals. It also helped to place the issue of \r\nhealth at the centre of the development agenda. By \r\npromoting consensus on issues ranging from \r\nnon-communicable and communicable diseases, \r\nneglected tropical diseases, health systems and health \r\nliteracy, to intellectual property rights, climate change \r\nand health, the ministerial declaration opened up vistas \r\nfor new collaborative efforts and new partnerships and \r\nengagement by new and diverse stakeholders. \r\n The national voluntary presentations made by \r\nBolivia, China, Jamaica, Japan, Mali, Sri Lanka and \r\nthe Sudan demonstrated the added value of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council as a platform to engage \r\nthe global community in exchanging critical lessons \r\nlearned in the implementation of the MDGs. \r\n The annual ministerial review attracted a diverse \r\nrange of actors from Governments, civil society and \r\nthe private sector. The review generated political \r\nmomentum for collective action to advance the global \r\nhealth agenda. That is a strong rallying point; we need \r\nto utilize that potential. Many other outcomes of the \r\nwork of the Economic and Social Council this year are \r\nof key relevance to the work of the General Assembly. \r\n By bringing together all concerned parties, the \r\nspecial high-level meeting of the Council with the \r\nBretton Woods institutions, the World Trade \r\nOrganization and the United Nations Conference on \r\nTrade and Development provided a first opportunity to \r\nhave an inclusive exchange of views on the global \r\nfinancial and economic crisis. It highlighted the need \r\nto address the crisis in a coherent and coordinated \r\nmanner, as well as the urgency of dealing with its \r\nhuman impact in order to prevent it from becoming a \r\nlarge-scale human tragedy. The summary record of the \r\ndiscussions was transmitted to the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly for the preparation of the draft final \r\ndocument of the International Conference on the World \r\nEconomic and Financial Crisis and Its Impact on \r\nDevelopment. \r\n Another issue that the Council considered, both \r\nduring the special high-level meeting with the \r\ninternational financial and trade institutions and \r\nthroughout a large part of the year, is closely linked to \r\nthe question of an effective response to the crisis, that \r\nis, the need to ensure follow-up to the Monterrey \r\nConsensus and the Doha Declaration on Financing for \r\nDevelopment and the commitments made therein. \r\n In line with the mandate given to the Council by \r\nheads of State and Government at the Doha \r\nConference, which was reaffirmed at the International \r\nConference on the World Economic and Financial \r\nCrisis and Its Impact on Development, the Council \r\nmade recommendations to the General Assembly for \r\nstrengthening and ensuring a more effective and \r\ninclusive intergovernmental process to carry out the \r\nfinancing for development follow-up. Some of the key \r\nrecommendations pertained to the holding of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council’s special high-level \r\nspring meeting with international financial and trade \r\ninstitutions, including the suggestions of holding the \r\nmeeting at least five weeks earlier and extending it to \r\ntake place over two days, allowing up to two full days \r\nof the Council’s annual substantive session to the issue \r\nof financing for development and giving more \r\npre-eminence to the Assembly’s consideration of this \r\nissue. \r\n A/64/PV.26\r\n \r\n3 09-57817 \r\n \r\n Several other mandates were entrusted to the \r\nCouncil by the Conference on the World Financial and \r\nEconomic Crisis and Its Impact on Development, \r\nwhich was held in New York last June. The Council \r\nintends fully to implement those mandates. The \r\nCouncil has requested me to conduct open-ended \r\ninformal consultations on the matter, which are \r\ncurrently under way. I hope that we will be able to \r\nmake recommendations to the Assembly in the not-too-\r\ndistant future. \r\n Finally in that context, I would like to emphasize \r\nthe Council’s welcome of the initiative of the \r\nInternational Labour Organization on the theme \r\n“Recovering from the crisis: a global jobs pact”. The \r\nCouncil also welcomed the request made of the \r\nSecretary-General to report on the follow-up and \r\nimplementation of the Global Jobs Pact by all relevant \r\nactors at the Council’s session in 2010. \r\n During the Council’s substantive session, \r\nMember States recognized and encouraged the ongoing \r\nstrengthening of humanitarian coordination, with \r\nreferences to the role of the Emergency Relief \r\nCoordinator, the strengthening of the Resident \r\nCoordinator/Humanitarian Coordinator function, the \r\nissue of gender mainstreaming and the need for \r\nimproved needs assessments. Members also \r\nemphasized the need for humanitarian actors and \r\ndonors to strengthen coordination with Governments. \r\n The Council also took up the issue of the \r\nimplementation of the Assembly’s guidance on \r\noperational activities. The concrete outcomes attested \r\nto the continued strong commitment of Member States \r\nto the 2007 General Assembly triennial comprehensive \r\npolicy review of operational activities for development.  \r\n Some of the Council’s recommendations also \r\nreflected the broad consensus that exists with regard to \r\nthe General Assembly’s system-wide coherence \r\nprocess. They also served to contribute to the Council’s \r\ninformal consultations, in particular in connection with \r\nthe governance and funding of United Nations \r\noperational activities. \r\n In addressing United Nations operational \r\nactivities, the Council will not lose sight of the global \r\ndynamics of development cooperation. The \r\nDevelopment Cooperation Forum is now widely \r\nrecognized as the focal point within the United Nations \r\nsystem for holistic consideration of development \r\ncooperation issues. In that context, I would like to \r\nmention the first high-level symposium on the theme \r\n“Accountable and transparent development \r\ncooperation: towards a more inclusive framework”, \r\nwhich will be hosted by the Government of Austria on \r\n12 and 13 November. In order for the Development \r\nCooperation Forum to be able to advance the global \r\ndialogue on this important issue in 2010, it is important \r\nthat Member States and other stakeholders actively \r\nparticipate in the upcoming preparatory process. \r\n I am pleased that our efforts to strengthen \r\ninteraction and institutional links between the Council \r\nand the Peacebuilding Commission are also beginning \r\nto bear fruit. Therefore, during its substantive session, \r\nthe Council called for enhanced engagement with the \r\nCommission, including with the various country-\r\nspecific formations. On 29 October, the Council and \r\nthe Commission will hold their first joint event, in \r\npartnership with the World Food Programme, to \r\nconsider the impact of the food and economic crises in \r\npost-conflict countries. The Secretary-General will also \r\nparticipate at that meeting. I very much hope that this \r\nrelationship will be further strengthened in the years to \r\ncome, as the Council undoubtedly has a role to play in \r\npeacebuilding and post-conflict development. The \r\nCouncil’s recent renewal of the mandate of the Ad Hoc \r\nAdvisory Group on Haiti, which was intended to \r\nsupport that country when it comes to its medium- and \r\nlong-term development, is a vivid reflection of that. \r\n The high number of countries that have \r\nvolunteered to make national presentations next year is \r\na clear reflection of the Council’s role as a forum for \r\ndiscussion and the exercise of mutual accountability. \r\nNext year could therefore be a unique opportunity to \r\nfurther strengthen voluntary national presentations as \r\nan accountability mechanism to help the international \r\ncommunity to review and fine tune development \r\npolicies and their implementation towards the \r\nachievement of the MDGs. \r\n Through those activities, the Council has been \r\nable to expand the range of stakeholders with whom \r\nthe United Nations can establish partnerships to \r\nadvance the achievement of the MDGs. The special \r\nphilanthropy event that was held last February — \r\nwhich was well attended by Member States, members \r\nof the corporate world and representatives from the \r\nphilanthropic, non-governmental and academic \r\ncommunities — discussed in particular how \r\nphilanthropy can contribute to advancing the global \r\npublic health agenda. The Council intends to further \r\nA/64/PV.26  \r\n \r\n09-57817 4 \r\n \r\nexpand its outreach to the philanthropic community. \r\nAnother special event, focusing on gender equality and \r\nthe empowerment of women, is already being prepared. \r\n My experience as President of the Economic and \r\nSocial Council has shown me the potential of the \r\nCouncil to generate momentum towards the timely \r\nrealization of the MDGs by bringing together many \r\ndiverse constituencies on issues of global importance, \r\nwhile maintaining focus on results. I urge the General \r\nAssembly fully to utilize that potential to mobilize \r\nefforts that can contribute to the realization of the great \r\nvision embodied in the MDGs. \r\n Mrs. Osman (Sudan): I have the honour, under \r\nagenda item 42 and on behalf of the Group of 77 and \r\nChina, to deliver this statement on the 2009 report of \r\nthe Economic and Social Council. \r\n The Group of 77 and China welcomes the report \r\non the work of the Economic and Social Council \r\nduring 2009 (A/64/3). On behalf of the Group of 77 \r\nand China, let me first express our gratitude to Her \r\nExcellency Ambassador Sylvie Lucas of Luxembourg, \r\nPresident of the Economic and Social Council, for the \r\nleadership provided by her and the members of the \r\nCouncil’s Bureau during the entire year, but most \r\nparticularly during the Council’s substantive session. \r\nWe would also like to take this opportunity to extend \r\nour gratitude to all the facilitators of draft resolutions \r\nfor their great efforts in reaching consensus on very \r\ndifficult issues. \r\n The year 2009 has been a critically relevant one \r\nfor the work of the Council. A string of crises has \r\nplaced the United Nations at the centre of global \r\ndiscourse and policy responses. The current economic \r\nand financial crisis and the issues of food security, \r\nclimate change and energy have again served to \r\nunderscore the centrality of inclusive multilateralism \r\nand the unparalleled convening role and legitimacy of \r\nthe United Nations with regard to those matters. The \r\nworld body must step up to the challenge. \r\n The Economic and Social Council has indeed \r\nmade important contributions to the work of the United \r\nNations in addressing those challenges. The spring \r\nmeeting with the Bretton Woods institutions, the World \r\nTrade Organization and the United Nations Conference \r\non Trade and Development was an important \r\nopportunity for a discussion on the international \r\nfinancial crisis and its impact on development.  \r\n The Group believes that the current crisis has \r\nfurther highlighted the urgent need for substantive and \r\ncomprehensive reform of the international economic \r\nand financial system and architecture. It has also \r\nstressed that international financial institutions should \r\nhave a clear development orientation. The G-77 and \r\nChina will continue to work to make the Council’s \r\nspring meeting more relevant and productive. \r\n We are concerned that the implementation of \r\nagreed commitments continues to be the Achilles heel \r\nof the United Nations development agenda. The \r\ndecisions of the 2005 United Nations Summit \r\nencapsulated the agreed commitments of all Members \r\non development. Those commitments include both the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) and other \r\ndevelopment goals internationally agreed upon during \r\nthe series of major international conferences and \r\nsummits held over the past decade, such as the \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment, which produced the Monterrey \r\nConsensus, the Doha trade conference, the \r\nJohannesburg World Summit on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and, more recently, the high-level \r\nConference on the World Economic and Financial \r\nCrisis and Its Impact on Development. \r\n During this year’s substantive session the \r\nEconomic and Social Council adopted by consensus \r\nthe ministerial declaration on the theme of global \r\npublic health (see A/64/3, para. 56), which was a major \r\nlandmark. It called for concerted action on critical \r\nissues related to global public health and referred to the \r\nneed to strengthen international cooperation. The \r\nministerial declaration augurs well for a stronger \r\nCouncil and is considered to be ground-breaking in \r\nmany ways. It paves the way ahead for concerted \r\naction on many critical issues related to global public \r\nhealth, calling for strengthening international \r\ncooperation to confront unforeseen threats and \r\nepidemics, such as the current H1N1 pandemic, and for \r\nstrengthening political will to achieve MDGs 4 and 5. \r\n Most important, the declaration acknowledges the \r\nimpact of the global financial and economic crisis on \r\ndeveloping countries and calls for strengthening the \r\nglobal partnership for development. It further stresses \r\nthat international cooperation and assistance, in \r\nparticular external funding, need to be more \r\npredictable and better aligned with national priorities. \r\nThe G-77 and China believes that ensuring a conducive \r\ninternational environment is imperative for the \r\n A/64/PV.26\r\n \r\n5 09-57817 \r\n \r\nachievement of the MDGs and critical for assisting our \r\nglobal efforts to advance global public health. The \r\nG-77 and China looks forward to the full and effective \r\nimplementation of the ministerial declaration on global \r\npublic health. \r\n The Economic and Social Council has indeed \r\nmade further strides towards its own strengthening by \r\nconvening annual ministerial reviews, which are \r\nevolving into an effective forum for an exchange of \r\nexperiences and best practices. They are also helping to \r\nshed light on obstacles facing countries in achieving \r\nthe MDGs and exploring ways and means to overcome \r\nthem. The number of presentations by developing \r\ncountries, and the depth and diversity of the issues \r\ndiscussed in those presentations, is a clear signal of the \r\nseriousness with which developing countries are \r\napproaching the annual ministerial review. We look \r\nforward to a greater level of participation by the \r\ndeveloped countries to further enhance the review \r\nprocess and its outcomes. \r\n The G-77 and China equally believes that the \r\nannual ministerial review can further be enriched by \r\nthe contribution and active engagement of United \r\nNations funds, programmes and agencies, in addition \r\nto the international financial and economic institutions. \r\nThe Group has always maintained that the Council \r\nshould seek to make the annual ministerial review and \r\nthe Development Cooperation Forum action- and \r\nresults-oriented. We believe that the review would be \r\nmore fruitful if its themes could emerge from the \r\ninformation and data provided by functional and \r\nregional commissions, with a view to monitoring the \r\nimplementation of development goals and \r\ncommitments. \r\n The G-77 and China welcomes the Council’s \r\nadoption of decision 2009/240, which set in motion a \r\nprocess to conclude discussion in the United Nations \r\nForum on Forests on the means of implementing \r\nsustainable forest management. The G-77 and China \r\nwelcomes the consensus agreement reached recently \r\npertaining to means of implementation of sustainable \r\nforest management. We believe that, without the \r\nnecessary financing, the global objectives on forests \r\nand the non-legally binding instrument on all forests \r\nwill be but empty words. Furthermore, inadequate \r\nfunding diminishes the effectiveness of the United \r\nNations Forum on Forests as an international forum for \r\nthe implementation of sustainable forest management. \r\n We equally welcome the agreements reached \r\nduring this session on key mandates on the economic \r\nand financial crisis outcome document \r\n(resolution 63/303). We have made progress and have \r\nset in motion the process for fulfilling our \r\nresponsibilities on the Global Jobs Pact, the \r\nimplementation of agreements with Bretton Woods \r\ninstitutions, the promotion and enhancement of the \r\nUnited Nations development system and the ad hoc \r\npanel of experts. We look forward to further progress \r\non that matter. \r\n We hope that the Council will be able to redouble \r\nits work on crafting global policy responses to the \r\ndevelopment challenges we now face. The Group of 77 \r\nand China will remain constructively engaged in that \r\neffort. \r\n Mr. Fries (Sweden): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of the European Union (EU). The following \r\ncountries align themselves with this statement: Turkey, \r\nCroatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, \r\nAlbania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Serbia, \r\nUkraine, the Republic of Moldova, Armenia and \r\nGeorgia. \r\n The European Union thanks the Secretariat for \r\nthe comprehensive report of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil (A/64/3). It is indeed useful to have in one \r\nplace such a compilation of all of the Council’s \r\nactivities, resolutions and decisions. We also thank \r\nAmbassador Lucas, President of the Council, for \r\nintroducing the report. We congratulate her for her \r\nskilful and productive leadership of the Council. \r\n The European Union would like to take this \r\nopportunity to reiterate its full support for the \r\nEconomic and Social Council as the principal organ for \r\nthe coordination of the economic, social and related \r\nwork of the United Nations, as well as the central \r\nforum for discussing international economic and social \r\nissues. The report before us shows the broad scope of \r\nthe activities of the Council. In my statement, I will \r\ncomment on some of the activities and achievements of \r\nthe Council during its substantive session last July. I \r\nwill also make a few comments on the working \r\nmethods of the Council. \r\n First, on an overall note, I would like to express \r\nthe appreciation of the European Union for the \r\nconstructive spirit that prevailed during the \r\nnegotiations in the Council. Good results were \r\nachieved and, with just a few exceptions, consensus \r\nA/64/PV.26  \r\n \r\n09-57817 6 \r\n \r\nagreements could be reached on the many draft \r\nresolutions that were introduced during the session. \r\n The Council’s high-level segment this past July \r\nwas a milestone in the recognition of the importance of \r\nglobal public health for economic and social \r\ndevelopment. Never before has global public health \r\nbeen discussed at that level in the United Nations \r\nsystem. The ministerial declaration on global public \r\nhealth (see A/64/3, para. 56), which the Council \r\nadopted by consensus, creates new opportunities to \r\ntake forward health issues in both the Council and \r\nother parts of the United Nations system. The European \r\nUnion will continue to be a key actor in joint efforts to \r\ntackle global health problems, including those \r\naggravated by gender inequality and the current \r\nfinancial and economic crisis. We will maintain our \r\ncommitment to global health for all. \r\n The discussions in the high-level segment stayed \r\nfocused on the theme of the segment and benefited \r\ngreatly from the active participation of Member States, \r\nUnited Nations organizations, other international \r\norganizations and members of civil society. During that \r\nsegment, the Council showed its usefulness as a high-\r\nlevel forum for debating key issues in the economic, \r\nsocial and related fields. \r\n The European Union recognizes the central role \r\nof the Economic and Social Council in promoting the \r\nintegrated and coordinated implementation of and \r\nfollow-up to the outcomes of the major United Nations \r\nconferences. We appreciate the discussion in the \r\ncoordination segment on the periodicity of the \r\nSecretary-General’s report on that subject. We look \r\nforward to the further review of that issue in the \r\nCouncil. \r\n The European Union welcomes the Council \r\nresolution on the implementation of system-wide \r\nreforms in United Nations operational activities for \r\ndevelopment within the context of the triennial \r\ncomprehensive policy review (resolution 2009/1). It \r\ngives key guidance for further reforms in this area. The \r\nEuropean Union underscores the importance of \r\nstrengthened support by the United Nations system to \r\nnational development priorities. In that regard, the EU \r\nreiterates its support for delivering as one and is \r\npleased to see that that approach is being replicated in \r\nan increasing number of countries, on their request. \r\n The European Union also welcomes the Council’s \r\nadoption by consensus of the resolution on United \r\nNations emergency humanitarian assistance (resolution \r\n2009/3). It sends a clear message of global unity \r\naround the humanitarian agenda. The interactive \r\ndialogue during the humanitarian affairs segment, \r\nwhich included high-level participation from the \r\nUnited Nations system and representatives of Member \r\nStates participating from capitals, proved to be very \r\nuseful and could serve as a model for further \r\ndeliberations in the Council. \r\n Today’s increasingly complex humanitarian \r\nchallenges call for a deeper and more engaged global \r\npartnership on international emergency humanitarian \r\nassistance, involving the United Nations, its Member \r\nStates and all relevant regional organizations and \r\nhumanitarian actors. The European Union remains \r\nfirmly committed to that global partnership. \r\n The European Union appreciates the adoption of \r\nthe resolution on the Global Jobs Pact (resolution \r\n2009/5), in line with paragraph 58 of the outcome \r\ndocument of the June Conference on the World \r\nFinancial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on \r\nDevelopment (Assembly resolution 63/303). The \r\nresolution highlights the crucial importance of \r\nemployment and a well-functioning labour market in \r\nthe efforts to limit the negative impact of the economic \r\nand financial crisis. We call on the United Nations \r\nsystem to follow up on that resolution. \r\n The European Union also welcomes the \r\nresolution on a strengthened and more effective \r\nprocess for the follow-up to the Monterrey Consensus \r\nand the Doha Declaration (resolution 2009/30), which \r\nwill contribute to improved quality of discussion, \r\nincreased interaction and enhanced cooperation \r\nbetween all stakeholders. We reaffirm our commitment \r\nto stay fully engaged in that process, including through \r\nour active participation in the Council’s special high-\r\nlevel meeting with the Bretton Woods institutions, the \r\nWorld Trade Organization and the United Nations \r\nConference on Trade and Development. That is a \r\ncritical vehicle for strengthening the dialogue between \r\nthe United Nations and the key stakeholders.  \r\n The EU also looks forward to participating in the \r\ndeliberations on financing for development in the \r\nSecond Committee and in the high-level dialogue of \r\nthe General Assembly that is to take place on 23 and 24 \r\nNovember. The high-level dialogue should focus on \r\nsubstantive issues, in particular new challenges and \r\n A/64/PV.26\r\n \r\n7 09-57817 \r\n \r\nemerging issues, while reaffirming the holistic \r\napproach of Monterrey and Doha. \r\n The European Union is pleased with the action \r\nthat the Council took as follow-up to the outcome of \r\nthe Conference on the World Financial and Economic \r\nCrisis and Its Impact on Development. The EU is now \r\nactively engaging in the consultations on the three \r\nreports of the Secretary-General that were mandated by \r\nthe Council in its decision of 31 July (decision 2009/258). \r\nWe stand ready to review progress on those discussions \r\nat the Council’s resumed substantive session to be held \r\nbefore the end of this year in accordance with the \r\ndecision. \r\n The training institutes of the United Nations play \r\nan important role in advancing the know-how and \r\ncoherence of individual agencies and their staff. The \r\nEU welcomes the Council’s reaffirmation of reforms in \r\nthe United Nations System Staff College and the \r\nUnited Nations Institute for Training and Research, as \r\nwell as its support for results-based management in \r\nthose institutions. \r\n Unfortunately, as the European Union stated in \r\nthe Council, we see a negative trend in the working of \r\nthe Committee on Non-Governmental Organizations. \r\nWe are concerned that the guiding principles for \r\ngranting consultative status in the Council are \r\ngradually being undermined. Civil society actors \r\nshould be allowed to support and enrich the work of \r\nthe United Nations by providing perspectives that \r\ncomplement, and sometimes differ from, those of the \r\nMember States. The EU urges the members of the \r\nCommittee to work together to defend and uphold the \r\nguiding principles agreed by the Member States in \r\nCouncil resolution 1996/31. \r\n Important steps have been taken to improve the \r\neffectiveness and relevance of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil. We saw good results in that regard during the \r\nJuly session in Geneva, but more needs to be done. \r\nFurther clarity is needed with regard to the division of \r\nlabour between the Council and the General Assembly \r\nin order to focus the agenda of the Council on issues \r\nwhere it can add value. It would also be useful to look \r\ninto the allocation of items to the different segments of \r\nthe substantive session — to avoid overlaps, for \r\ninstance. \r\n There is a worrying trend of introducing draft \r\nresolutions at a very late stage. That creates difficulties \r\nfor delegations, particularly smaller ones, in preparing \r\nfor the consultations on the drafts. It also has the risk \r\nof leading to decisions of poor quality. Before any \r\nconsideration of changing the rules of procedure, the \r\nEU would urge better discipline in that regard. \r\n Furthermore, we all need to make greater efforts \r\nto adhere to the assigned deadlines for each segment of \r\nthe Council. For example, the negotiations on the two \r\ndraft resolutions for the coordination segment were not \r\nconcluded until two weeks after the segment was over. \r\nThat creates difficulties for delegations in participating \r\neffectively in the negotiations and, again, risks leading \r\nto poor-quality decisions. \r\n An inherent problem with the organization of \r\nwork of the substantive session of the Council is that \r\nnegotiations on draft resolutions take place in parallel \r\nwith the plenary meetings, panel discussions, round \r\ntables, et cetera. Many representatives who could \r\ncontribute to an interactive and fruitful debate in the \r\nplenary sessions are tied up in negotiations. It is \r\ndifficult to see how this problem can be fully solved, \r\nbut better discipline in introducing resolutions in time \r\nand in keeping deadlines for the segments would help \r\nto minimize the problem. \r\n The European Union stands ready to discuss \r\nthose and other ways of improving the working \r\nmethods of the Council. \r\n Mrs. Kolontai (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): The \r\nall-encompassing nature of the current global crises, \r\nincluding the food, financial and energy crises, has led \r\nto a sharp decrease of capital flows to the developing \r\ncountries and has jeopardized the international \r\ncommunity’s achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). \r\n Belarus highly commends the work of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council in the current \r\nenvironment. We consider it necessary to continue to \r\nstrengthen the Council’s role as the body mandated to \r\nenhance the effectiveness of the work of United \r\nNations institutions, funds, programmes and related \r\norganizations. That work should place special emphasis \r\non ensuring system-wide conditions to encourage \r\nequitable international trade and provide consultative \r\nand technical assistance to developing and middle-\r\nincome countries. \r\n In the current context, the main objective for the \r\nEconomic and Social Council in the area of financing \r\nfor development should be the implementation of the \r\nA/64/PV.26  \r\n \r\n09-57817 8 \r\n \r\noutcome documents of the United Nations Conference \r\non the World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its \r\nImpact on Development, which was held in June 2009, \r\nand of the Doha Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment, held in December 2008. Belarus \r\nwelcomes the establishment of an ad hoc open-ended \r\nworking group of the General Assembly to follow up \r\non issues pertaining to the financial crisis and is ready \r\nto contribute to its activities. \r\n We also welcome the decisions to considerably \r\nincrease International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World \r\nBank financial resources for expanded lending to \r\nneedy countries. We support the proposals aimed at \r\ndeveloping new lending mechanisms to provide \r\neffective assistance to countries facing financial \r\nproblems, including middle-income countries. \r\n The adoption by the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil of new forms of partnership between the \r\nUnited Nations and other organizations opens up \r\nadditional possibilities for enhancing the efficiency of \r\ninternational efforts. We hope that the practice of \r\nholding high-level meetings with the participation of \r\nthe IMF, the World Bank, the World Trade \r\nOrganization and the United Nations Conference on \r\nTrade and Development will continue. \r\n A summit will take place here in New York in \r\n2010 that will be a unique forum to bring together \r\nheads of State and Government of the Group of Eight, \r\nthe Group of Twenty, the European Union, the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement, the Commonwealth of \r\nIndependent States and others. Belarus believes that \r\nthe 2010 summit should be viewed as one of \r\npartnership that serves as a platform for exploring and \r\nputting into practice the idea of global partnership.  \r\n We suggest that the 2010 United Nations summit \r\nadopt a mechanism, system or plan for close \r\ncooperation among Member States in order to \r\novercome global challenges. Over the coming months, \r\ndelegations could submit their proposals and \r\ncontributions for such a document. Negotiations could \r\nbegin as early as January 2010. We call on the \r\nEconomic and Social Council to take an active role in \r\nthe preparation of that document.  \r\n Mr. Pankin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): Given the global financial and economic \r\ncrisis, the role of the United Nations as a universal \r\nplatform for finding collective ways to approach the \r\ncurrent problems facing the international community \r\nonly continues to grow. Now more than ever, we need a \r\ncoordinated international policy aimed at implementing \r\nthe main agreements on international development. \r\nThat will provide a real and solid basis for a safer, \r\nmore stable and more equitable future. The Economic \r\nand Social Council can become one of the effective \r\ninstruments for developing such a policy, as well as the \r\nnecessary forum for discussing at the political level the \r\noverall principles for sustainable economic \r\ndevelopment, thereby providing a basis for a new \r\nglobal economic order.  \r\n The main task facing the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil in the context of international efforts to deal \r\nwith the crisis continues to be that of ensuring a \r\ncoordinated response by the United Nations system to \r\nchallenges in the area of development, while taking \r\ninto account the work being done by the leading \r\ninternational financial and trade bodies, as well as by \r\nregional, subregional and other multilateral forums. \r\n Achieving the potential of the United Nations as \r\na useful mechanism to advance global anti-crisis \r\nefforts first and foremost requires more effective \r\ncooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions in the \r\ncontext of following up the Monterrey and Doha \r\nConferences on Financing for Development. It also \r\nrequires a qualitative improvement in the coordinating \r\nfunction of the Economic and Social Council in the \r\ncontext of integrated and coordinated implementation \r\nof the decisions taken at the major social and economic \r\nUnited Nations conferences.  \r\n We believe that the Economic and Social Council \r\ncan make an important contribution to preparing for \r\nthe September 2010 high-level plenary meetings of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, which will include the participation \r\nof heads of State and Government. At that forum, \r\nparticular importance should be attached to promoting \r\ndevelopment cooperation during the Council’s 2010 \r\nsubstantive session. We hope that that forum will result \r\nin an interesting and results-oriented dialogue that \r\nincludes the participation of the broadest possible \r\nspectrum of partners. \r\n Russia commends the outcome of the work of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council over the past year, in \r\nparticular during the substantive session. That session \r\nproduced political guidelines for further work on the \r\nkey issues of global health and sustainable \r\ndevelopment, with emphasis on helping countries to \r\n A/64/PV.26\r\n \r\n9 09-57817 \r\n \r\novercome the negative consequences of the crisis in the \r\nsocial sphere.  \r\n The high-level segment, in particular the annual \r\nministerial review on the implementation of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, was of practical \r\nimportance for the entire United Nations system. For \r\nthe first time at the United Nations — outside of the \r\ncontext of the World Health Organization (WHO) — a \r\ncomprehensive discussion took place on the issue of \r\nhealth in all its aspects. Without impinging on the \r\nleading role and mandate of WHO, the Economic and \r\nSocial Council was able to make an effort to \r\nmainstream the health-care agenda at the United \r\nNations and clarify the policy strategy to address \r\nexisting health challenges. The ministerial declaration \r\nadopted during that segment (see A/64/3, para. 56) \r\nprovides a good normative basis for stepping up efforts \r\nin the area of health and for increasing coordination \r\nbetween the various bodies of the United Nations \r\nsystem.  \r\n A good foundation was also established for at \r\nlong last putting into practice the principle of \r\ndelivering as one at the United Nations to respond to \r\nglobal challenges while respecting the very nature and \r\nmandate of independent agencies of the United Nations \r\nsystem and the division of labour within the existing \r\ninstitutional global health system.  \r\n Another important outcome of the session was \r\nthe reaffirmation of the role of the Economic and \r\nSocial Council as the central mechanism for ensuring \r\nsystem-wide coherence with regard to follow-up efforts \r\non the outcome of the major conferences in the \r\neconomic and social fields.  \r\n We welcome the adoption of Economic and \r\nSocial Council resolution 2009/29, which points out \r\nthe need to step up the work of the substantive session \r\nin order to avoid any duplication between the \r\ncoordinating and general segments. The coordinating \r\nsegment should be an effective mechanism for \r\nmonitoring the effectiveness of the work of the many \r\ninter-agency thematic groupings, including, of course, \r\nSecretariat coordinating bodies.  \r\n The outcome document of the United Nations \r\nConference on the World Financial and Economic \r\nCrisis and Its Impact on Development (resolution \r\n63/303) assigns important tasks to the Economic and \r\nSocial Council, including supporting the coordinated \r\nefforts of the Organization to respond to the crisis and \r\nensuring the effectiveness of cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and international financial institutions.  \r\n For our part, we are ready for constructive \r\ndialogue with all partners to reach consensus decisions. \r\nWe believe that an ad hoc open-ended working group \r\nof the General Assembly should be the main \r\nintergovernmental platform for follow-up to the June \r\nConference. We believe that it would be appropriate to \r\ncombine discussion of the key issues on the anti-crisis \r\nagenda within the work of that working group. In \r\nparticular, that entails establishing, under the aegis of \r\nthe United Nations, a panel of experts on the world \r\nfinancial and economic crisis and its impact on \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n Mrs. Dunlop (Brazil): Brazil associates itself \r\nwith the statement delivered by the representative of \r\nthe Sudan on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. \r\nBrazil also commends Ms. Sylvie Lucas’s leadership of \r\nthe Economic and Social Council, in particular during \r\nthe Council’s substantive session.  \r\n Both the report of the Council (A/64/3) and the \r\nvery existence of an agenda item on integrated follow-\r\nup to the major United Nations conferences and \r\nsummits in the economic, social and related fields \r\nunderscore the importance of the Council in promoting \r\ncoordination, coherence and cooperation in the United \r\nNations system.  \r\n As President Lula has indicated on a number of \r\noccasions, most recently at the Assembly’s general \r\ndebate, Brazil believes that the Council needs to be \r\nstrengthened with a view to ensuring that it plays a \r\nmore prominent role in policy discussions and \r\ndeliberations on substantive development issues. The \r\nfinancial and economic crisis has further demonstrated \r\nthe urgent need to improve coordination and coherence \r\nin the United Nations system — including the General \r\nAssembly, the Economic and Social Council, the funds, \r\nprogrammes, specialized agencies and the multilateral \r\nfinancial institutions — both at the policy and \r\noperational levels.  \r\n Brazil recognizes that there have been initiatives \r\nover the past few years to improve inter-institutional \r\nand intergovernmental coordination, as exemplified by \r\nthe ministerial declaration on implementing the \r\ninternationally agreed goals and commitments with \r\nregard to global public health, which was adopted by \r\nthe Economic and Social Council this year. The annual \r\nministerial review can be an important occasion for \r\nA/64/PV.26  \r\n \r\n09-57817 10 \r\n \r\nreviewing progress on specific policy questions and for \r\nthe making of concrete recommendations.  \r\n The Development Cooperation Forum also \r\nprovides a valuable opportunity for promoting \r\ncoordination and exchanging information on relevant \r\ndevelopment cooperation issues. Furthermore, the \r\nChief Executives Board for Coordination (CEB) is \r\nplaying an increasing role in promoting coordination at \r\nthe administrative level between the 28 agencies that \r\nform the United Nations system. \r\n However, it is clear to my delegation that \r\nadditional measures are warranted. The actions and \r\ninitiatives taken by the United Nations funds, \r\nprogrammes and specialized agencies, including the \r\nBretton Woods institutions, often seem to be \r\ndisconnected from the guidelines adopted by Member \r\nStates at the Economic and Social Council and the \r\nGeneral Assembly. Given the responsibilities of \r\nspecialized agencies in the follow-up to, \r\nimplementation and monitoring of the outcomes of \r\nUnited Nations conferences and summits, it is \r\nparticularly important to foster closer cooperation \r\namong the governing bodies at the United Nations, \r\nmost notably the Economic and Social Council. \r\n The CEB has taken important steps to implement \r\ncommon strategies and methodologies, but it seems to \r\nsuffer from a deficit of accountability to Member \r\nStates. The nine joint actions adopted to address the \r\nfinancial and economic crisis were timely. Looking \r\nahead, the response of the United Nations system to the \r\ncrisis needs fully to take into account the outcome of \r\nthe Conference on the World Financial and Economic \r\nCrisis (resolution 63/303), which was adopted in June.  \r\n The Secretary-General’s report on the response of \r\nthe United Nations development system to the crisis \r\nclearly indicates that that has not yet taken place. In \r\nthat regard, the establishment of an enhanced \r\nintergovernmental follow-up mechanism for the \r\nfinancing of the development process is an important \r\nstep in the right direction, aimed at engaging the \r\nBretton Woods institutions in substantive discussions \r\nwith the members of the Economic and Social Council \r\nand other relevant United Nations bodies, including the \r\nGeneral Assembly.  \r\n It should be recalled that the Monterrey \r\nConference is the only major United Nations \r\nconference in the economic and social fields that does \r\nnot have a permanent intergovernmental body to \r\noversee the implementation of its outcome. That \r\ncertainly is an issue that merits further study and \r\ndiscussion by the membership.  \r\n Mrs. Wahab (Indonesia): Allow me first of all to \r\nthank the Secretary-General for the reports under \r\nconsideration today (A/64/3, A/64/87 and A/64/263) \r\nand for his continued commitment to ensuring \r\ncoordinated and integrated follow-up of the major \r\nUnited Nations economic and social conferences and \r\nsummits. \r\n Indonesia associates itself with the statement \r\ndelivered by the representative of the Sudan on behalf \r\nof the Group of 77 and China. \r\n The broad vision of shared development priorities \r\nreflected in the historic United Nations conferences \r\nand summits remains a vital benchmark for achieving \r\nequitable development. In the same vein, the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), whose \r\npurpose is to sharpen our focus on some of the most \r\nurgent issues addressed by the conferences and \r\nsummits, has been a tremendous catalyst in \r\naccelerating progress towards the wider goal of \r\nequitable growth. \r\n Significant advances have been made over the \r\npast 20 years, in large part because of the MDGs. Yet, \r\nin addition to the ever-increasing number of new \r\nchallenges awaiting solution, perceivable challenges \r\nstill stand out in every region. The financial, fuel and \r\nfood crises, climate change and new viruses and \r\ndiseases are some of the emerging problems that, if not \r\naddressed fully and effectively, could contribute to \r\nundermining our efforts. \r\n Against that backdrop, we need to build global \r\npartnerships within a new spirit of multilateralism. To \r\nimpart new impetus to global partnerships, the first key \r\nstep is to implement reforms in all key areas of the \r\ninternational economy. Greater efforts should be \r\ndevoted to the workings of the international financial \r\narchitecture so that it becomes a force for equitable \r\ngrowth. \r\n Along the same lines, key structural reforms in \r\ntrade and development are particularly crucial to \r\nrealizing a more open, free and equitable trading \r\nsystem. The need to reach a successful conclusion to \r\nthe Doha Development Round and to fulfil the \r\nMonterey Consensus cannot be overemphasized, as it \r\nwill ensure the attainment of the MDGs. \r\n A/64/PV.26\r\n \r\n11 09-57817 \r\n \r\n However, reforms should take into account future \r\nchallenges as well, including the interrelated issues of \r\nclimate change and food and energy security. The \r\nestablishment of the annual ministerial review and the \r\nDevelopment Cooperation Forum three years ago was a \r\nvital initial step in the reform process to strengthen the \r\nrole of the Economic and Social Council with regard to \r\nthe timely implementation of the outcomes of the \r\nmajor United Nations conferences and summits. \r\n We therefore welcome the holding of the third \r\nannual ministerial review this year. With a focus on \r\nglobal health, the review took a further step towards \r\naddressing new challenges facing the world. We fully \r\nsupport and look forward to contributing to the \r\nassessment of the ministerial declaration on global \r\nhealth, as well as to integrating the question of health \r\ninto the development agenda. Given the many health \r\nissues we face, there is an urgent need for a fair, \r\ntransparent, equitable and efficient framework for the \r\nsharing of information about viruses as well as \r\nbenefits, including access to and the distribution of \r\naffordable treatments. \r\n Next year’s ministerial review will focus on the \r\nissue of gender equality and the empowerment of \r\nwomen. We therefore welcome the adoption of \r\nresolution 63/311 on system-wide coherence, and in \r\nparticular the steps that have been taken to strengthen \r\nthe role of the United Nations in the areas of gender \r\nequality and women’s empowerment. \r\n We also look forward to the second session of the \r\nDevelopment Cooperation Forum, which will demand \r\neffectiveness in development cooperation at the \r\nnational and international levels. Likewise, we look \r\nforward to a more democratic and transparent United \r\nNations that is accountable and operates in a coherent \r\nmanner. Overall, the Economic and Social Council \r\nshould play a crucial role in addressing all new \r\ndevelopment challenges and in promoting all \r\ndevelopment aspects in a concerted manner. \r\n Given the uneven progress on all fronts with \r\nrespect to the outcomes of United Nations conferences \r\nand summits, including the MDGs, there needs to be a \r\ngreater effort to ensure their timely and full realization. \r\nThat entails a concerted effort on the part not only of \r\nMember States, but also of the related international \r\nframework. \r\n Indonesia welcomes the recent outcome of the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on the World Financial and \r\nEconomic Crisis and Its Impact on Development \r\n(resolution 63/303). However, the follow-up action \r\nprescribed in the outcome needs to be implemented in \r\na full and timely manner. In that regard, it is our hope \r\nthat the open-ended working group established as a \r\nresult of the Conference should undertake to translate \r\nthe outcome into meaningful measures that promote \r\nhuman development. It should also expedite discussion \r\non the reform and strengthening of the international \r\nfinancial system by providing concrete recommendations. \r\n The outcome of the Conference also \r\nrecommended that the Economic and Social Council \r\nstudy the possibility of establishing a panel of experts. \r\nWhile Indonesia recognizes the potential contribution \r\nof a panel of experts, clear terms of reference on its \r\nwork, composition and responsibility need to be further \r\nexplored, as that is crucial to ensuring the \r\nintergovernmental nature of such a panel. \r\n With only a short time left to achieve the MDGs, \r\nwe need to ensure a conducive global economic \r\nenvironment. It is crucial for the international \r\ncommunity to realize the entire package of \r\ndevelopment commitments that serve as the world’s \r\nengines for growth. The decision of the General \r\nAssembly to convene a high-level MDG review \r\nsummit with all stakeholders in 2010 must lead to \r\nsolutions and answers. The summit should provide \r\nsolutions on all development aspects that can \r\ncontribute to translating the MDGs into a reality in all \r\nregions. \r\n It is worthwhile to seriously consider the \r\nproposal to prepare a report on the major United \r\nNations conferences and summits prior to the \r\nquadrennial comprehensive policy review of \r\noperational activities that will start in 2012. The report \r\nshould better identify gaps in the implementation of the \r\nmajor outcomes of United Nations conferences and \r\nsummits. \r\n Finally, the integrated and coordinated follow-up \r\nof United Nations conferences and summits must reach \r\nand have an impact on the unfortunate poor who \r\ndepend on us to speak on their behalf. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): We have heard \r\nthe last speaker in today’s debate. The Assembly has \r\ntherefore concluded this stage of its consideration of \r\nagenda items 42 and 48. \r\n \r\nA/64/PV.26  \r\n \r\n09-57817 12 \r\n \r\nProgramme of work \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I would like to \r\nmake an announcement concerning agenda item 70, \r\n“Strengthening of the coordination of humanitarian and \r\ndisaster relief assistance of the United Nations, \r\nincluding special economic assistance”. \r\n I have requested Ms. Sylvie Lucas, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Luxembourg to the United Nations, \r\nto be the coordinator of the informal consultations on \r\nthe draft resolutions under agenda item 70, and she has \r\ngraciously accepted. May I request those delegations \r\nintending to submit draft resolutions under this agenda \r\nitem to do so as early as possible in order to allow \r\ntime, if need be, for negotiations, with a view to \r\nreaching consensus on the draft resolutions. The first \r\nmeeting of the informal consultations on this agenda \r\nitem will be Thursday, 29 October 2009, at 3 p.m. in \r\nConference Room 3. \r\n I also wish to inform members that, on Thursday, \r\n29 October 2009, as indicated in the schedule of \r\nplenary meetings contained in document \r\nA/INF/64/3/Rev.1, the General Assembly will consider, \r\nin the morning, agenda item 75, entitled “Report of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court”. In the afternoon of the \r\nsame day, the Assembly will consider agenda item 72, \r\nentitled “Report of the International Court of Justice”, \r\nwhich was initially scheduled for the morning. \r\n Members are also informed that elections and \r\nappointments relating to the Committee for Programme \r\nand Coordination, the United Nations Commission on \r\nInternational Trade Law, the Governing Council of the \r\nUnited Nations Environment Programme, the \r\nCommittee on Conferences and the Joint Inspection \r\nUnit scheduled for Monday, 2 November 2009, have \r\nbeen postponed to Tuesday, 3 November 2009, in the \r\nmorning. \r\nThe meeting rose at 11.25 a.m. \r\n \r\n"
