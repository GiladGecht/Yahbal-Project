(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 19 \r\n \r\nNecessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/64/97) \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/64/L.4) \r\n \r\n Mr. Mohamad (Sudan): On behalf of the Group \r\nof 77 and China, I am honoured to speak in this \r\nplenary meeting on agenda item 19, “Necessity of \r\nending the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo imposed by the United States of America \r\nagainst Cuba”.  \r\n The Group of 77 and China have always been \r\nfirmly against this embargo. The heads of State and \r\nGovernment of the Group of 77 and China at the \r\nSecond South Summit, held in Doha, Qatar, from 12 to \r\n16 June 2005, firmly rejected the imposition of laws \r\nand regulations with extraterritorial impact and all \r\nother forms of coercive economic measures, including \r\nunilateral sanctions against developing countries, and \r\ncalled upon the Government of the United States to put \r\nan end to the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo against Cuba, which, in addition to being \r\nunilateral and contrary to the Charter of the United \r\nNations, international law and to the principle of good-\r\nneighbourliness, causes huge material losses and \r\neconomic damage to the people of Cuba. \r\n In this regard, the Group of 77 and China would \r\nlike to reiterate once again their long-standing position \r\non this important matter. At their recent thirty-third \r\nannual meeting held here in New York on \r\n25 September 2009, the ministers for foreign affairs of \r\nthe States members of the Group of 77 and China  \r\n “firmly rejected the imposition of laws and \r\nregulations with extraterritorial impact and all \r\nother forms of coercive economic measures, \r\nincluding unilateral sanctions against developing \r\ncountries, and reiterated the urgent need to \r\neliminate them immediately. They emphasized \r\nthat such actions not only undermine the \r\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter of the United \r\nNations and international law but also severely \r\nthreaten the freedom of trade and investment. \r\nThey, therefore, called on the international \r\ncommunity neither to recognize these measures \r\nnor apply them”. (A/64/489, annex, para. 39) \r\n The Group of 77 and China take note of the \r\nreplies of Governments and bodies within the United \r\nNations system to the Secretary-General’s request for \r\ninformation on the matter, contained in his report on \r\nthe implementation of resolution 63/7 (A/64/97). Sadly, \r\nthey unequivocally show that the embargo remains \r\nlargely unchanged and continues to impose severe \r\neconomic and financial restrictions on Cuba. \r\nFurthermore, the debilitating impact of the global \r\neconomic crisis on Cuba and the continued embargo by \r\nthe Government of the United States will contribute to \r\nfurther aggravating the hardships of and imposed on \r\nthe people of Cuba.  \r\nA/64/PV.27  \r\n \r\n09-57988 2 \r\n \r\n The Group of 77 and China calls on the United \r\nStates to heed the increasing appeals of the \r\ninternational community to put an end to the five-\r\ndecade embargo and to fully adhere to the principles of \r\nmutual respect and non-interference in the internal \r\naffairs of a sisterly nation. The embargo frustrates \r\nefforts towards the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and negatively affects regional \r\ncooperation in that area. \r\n The Group of 77 and China is committed to \r\nworking towards a better world for all, in which \r\nnations large and small can coexist peacefully. The \r\nachievement of such peaceful coexistence among \r\nnations requires adherence by all nations to the \r\ncardinal principles of the United Nations Charter and \r\nthe peaceful conduct of relations among nations.  \r\n The Group of 77 and China will again fully \r\nsupport the draft resolution against the embargo \r\n(A/64/L.4) and urges all States Members of the \r\nOrganization to do so as well.  \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): Before giving \r\nthe floor to the next speaker, I would like to propose \r\nthat the list of speakers for the debate on this item be \r\nclosed. \r\n It was so decided. \r\n Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement on this \r\nimportant item, and would like to start by welcoming \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Cuba, to the General Assembly. \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement once again renews \r\nits commitment to defending, preserving and \r\npromoting the United Nations Charter and international \r\nlaw, and stresses its commitment to promoting, \r\npreserving and strengthening multilateralism and the \r\nmultilateral decision-making process.  \r\n On the basis of that principled position, the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement firmly reiterates its rejection \r\nof the adoption and implementation of extraterritorial \r\nor unilateral coercive measures or laws, including \r\nunilateral economic sanctions or other illegal measures \r\ncontrary to international law, that seek to exert pressure \r\non non-aligned countries to prevent them from \r\nexercising their right to decide, by their own free will, \r\ntheir own political, economic and social systems. We \r\ntherefore call on all States to refrain from recognizing \r\nsuch measures or laws, which undermine the principles \r\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter and \r\ninternational law and severely threaten the freedom of \r\ntrade, navigation and investment.  \r\n Furthermore, the Non-Aligned Movement \r\nopposes and condemns such measures or laws and their \r\ncontinued application, and urges other States to do \r\nlikewise, as called for by the General Assembly and \r\nother United Nations organs. The Non-Aligned \r\nMovement once again requests States applying such \r\nmeasures or laws to revoke them fully and \r\nimmediately. Moreover, in accordance with \r\ninternational law, the Non-Aligned Movement supports \r\nthe claim of affected States, including targeted ones, to \r\ncompensation for the damage incurred as a \r\nconsequence of the implementation of extraterritorial \r\nor unilateral coercive measures or laws. \r\n The economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nimposed by the United States of America against the \r\nRepublic of Cuba has been in place for 50 years, and \r\n70 per cent of Cubans have been born under it. The \r\nNon-Aligned Movement expresses its concern over the \r\ncontinuation of that long-standing unilateral policy, \r\nespecially since the overwhelming majority of States \r\nhas consistently rejected it, as evidenced by last year’s \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution on this item (resolution \r\n63/7), which received the support of 185 Member \r\nStates. \r\n The heads of State and Government of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement, at its fifteenth summit \r\nconference held in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, in July \r\n2009, reiterated once again in the final document \r\nadopted by the summit their long-standing position on \r\nthe necessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States against \r\nCuba. We therefore call upon the Government of the \r\nUnited States of America to put an immediate end to \r\nthe embargo. \r\n Furthermore, during the summit in Sharm \r\nel-Sheikh, the heads of State and Government of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement adopted an exceptional \r\ndeclaration, entitled the “Special Declaration of the \r\nHeads of State and Government of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement on the necessity of ending the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States of America against Cuba”. That \r\ndeclaration reflects the importance that the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement attaches to that issue, and \r\n A/64/PV.27\r\n \r\n3 09-57988 \r\n \r\nmarked the end of Cuba’s outstanding presidency of \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement for the past three years. \r\n From another perspective, I would like to \r\nunderscore that the embargo, in addition to being \r\nunilateral and contrary to the United Nations Charter, \r\ninternational law and the principle of good-\r\nneighbourliness, continues to cause huge material loss \r\nand economic and financial damage, which have had a \r\nnegative impact on the welfare and well-being of the \r\npeople of Cuba. \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement also reiterates its \r\ndeep concern over the widening of the extraterritorial \r\nnature of the embargo against Cuba and rejects the \r\nreinforcement of measures adopted by the United \r\nStates Government, aimed at tightening the embargo, \r\nas well as all other recent measures carried out by the \r\nGovernment of the United States of America against \r\nthe people of Cuba. \r\n Therefore, the Non-Aligned Movement once \r\nagain urges the Government of the United States of \r\nAmerica to immediately and fully comply with all \r\nresolutions of the General Assembly related to the \r\nnecessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba. Similarly, the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement urges all States to strictly comply with \r\nresolutions 47/19, 48/16, 49/9, 50/10, 51/17, 52/10, \r\n53/4, 54/21, 55/20, 56/9, 57/11, 58/7, 59/11, 60/12, \r\n61/11, 62/3 and 63/7. All those resolutions relate to the \r\nnecessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba. \r\n To conclude, I would like to highlight that, \r\ndespite the continuation of the embargo and all its \r\nnegative effects, the Cuban Government conducted its \r\npresidency of the Non-Aligned Movement over the \r\npast three years in a highly capable and commendable \r\nmanner that preserved and advanced the interests of the \r\nStates members of the Non-Aligned Movement and \r\ncontributed to enhancing the interaction between the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement and the larger membership of \r\nthe United Nations.  \r\n In addition, these past few years have also \r\nwitnessed an increased dynamism in Cuba’s \r\ninternational relations with all regions of the world. In \r\nthat context, I would like to state that the new United \r\nStates Administration has embarked on a path of \r\nopenness and engagement with the outside world. \r\nThus, the Non-Aligned Movement looks forward to \r\nthat new policy being extended to Cuba as well and \r\nleading to the immediate end of the long-standing \r\nembargo. \r\n Mr. Bart (Saint Kitts and Nevis): I, too, \r\nrecognize the presence of the Foreign Minister of \r\nCuba.  \r\n I have the honour to address the General \r\nAssembly on behalf of the 14 States members of the \r\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM), which also aligns \r\nitself with the statements made by the representative of \r\nthe Sudan on behalf of the Group of 77 and China and \r\nthe representative of Egypt on behalf of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement. \r\n CARICOM member States continue to reiterate \r\ntheir unequivocal opposition to the United States \r\nimposition of the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo against Cuba, which has been opposed by the \r\noverwhelming majority of the international community \r\nfor the past 17 years. The unilateral imposition of \r\nextraterritorial laws on third States is contrary to both \r\nthe letter and the spirit of the United Nations Charter, \r\nand the embargo itself continues to run counter to the \r\nprinciples of multilateralism, international law, \r\nsovereignty and free trade that this body traditionally \r\nchampions. \r\n The stubborn persistence of the embargo is \r\napparently impervious to the sustained chorus of \r\ninternational criticism and to the logic of a world that \r\nhas changed immeasurably over the four and a half \r\ndecades since the blockade was first imposed. The \r\nembargo has now outlived the cold war by 18 years. It \r\nhas outlasted the terms of eight United States \r\npresidents and that of Cuban President Fidel Castro. \r\nOver 70 per cent of Cubans alive today were born \r\nunder the embargo.  \r\n CARICOM considers the embargo to be an \r\nanachronism that has succeeded only in contributing to \r\nthe suffering of generations of ordinary Cubans and \r\nunnecessarily increased tensions between the United \r\nStates and Cuba. It serves no justifiable legal, political \r\nor moral purpose in the twenty-first century. \r\n The punitive embargo is of a particular concern to \r\nCARICOM, which shares a history, culture and \r\nbrotherhood with the people of Cuba. Cuba is the most \r\npopulous State of the Caribbean region and an integral \r\npart of the pan-Caribbean process. Caribbean ties with \r\nA/64/PV.27  \r\n \r\n09-57988 4 \r\n \r\nCuba have historical significance, cemented by years \r\nof active cooperation at various levels. The States \r\nmembers of CARICOM continue to maintain their \r\nclose relations with Cuba through a wide range of \r\nprogrammes of cooperation in areas including trade, \r\nhealth care, infrastructure and human resource \r\ndevelopment. Our future regional development is in \r\nmany ways reliant upon our collective advancement \r\nand progress. In that context, we view the embargo not \r\njust as a punitive act against Cuba, but as an \r\nimpediment to our shared regional development. \r\n This year’s report of the Secretary-General \r\n(A/64/97) on the implementation of resolution 63/7, \r\nlike previous reports on this matter, outlines responses \r\nfrom an overwhelming majority of Member States that \r\nshare a common perspective on the continued \r\nunilateral embargo against Cuba. Indeed, the report \r\ndemonstrates that the embargo even affects the manner \r\nin which organs and agencies of the United Nations \r\nsystem carry out their work in Cuba. \r\n CARICOM States therefore reaffirm the position \r\nof the Group of 77 and China and the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement in opposing such unilateral actions, and we \r\nmaintain the position that constructive engagement and \r\npeaceful negotiations remain the only acceptable \r\nmeans of advancing long-term peace and stability. \r\n The significance of the embargo on the Cuban \r\neconomy continues to be of great concern to \r\nCARICOM, and its humanitarian impact on the people \r\nof Cuba, especially in the area of health care and food, \r\nis especially saddening. The inability of Cuba to \r\nacquire necessary medical equipment, spare parts and \r\nthe latest-generation medications because of the \r\nembargo continues to affect the health-care system, \r\nwhereby treatment remains free of charge to the Cuban \r\npeople. \r\n With the strengthened and more frequent storms \r\nand hurricanes brought by climate change and Cuba’s \r\ngeographical susceptibility to these natural disasters, \r\nthe unacceptable humanitarian impact of the embargo \r\nis becoming even more acute. Additionally, Cuba’s \r\naccess to construction materials and heavy equipment \r\nis becoming increasingly impossible because of the \r\nstringent rules on origins and restrictions against \r\ncorporations based outside of the United States. \r\n The negative effects on the Cuban economy and \r\nits growth are obvious and tangible. The embargo has \r\nnow cost Cuba almost $100 billion since its 1962 \r\nimposition. It is remarkable that even as Cuba struggles \r\nwith the recent unfortunate string of natural disasters \r\nand the impact of the global economic crisis, it \r\ncontinues to assist other nations in the developing \r\nworld, starting with its immediate Caribbean \r\nneighbours. Thousands of CARICOM students have \r\nattended Cuban universities without charge, thousands \r\nhave received free surgeries and medical assistance in \r\nCuba, and thousands more have been treated in their \r\nhome countries by Cuban doctors and nurses. \r\n We have benefited from technical expertise, \r\ncapacity-building programmes, infrastructure assistance \r\nand the selfless generosity of the Cuban people. The \r\npeople of Cuba have threatened no one, and neither the \r\nembargo nor its deleterious side effects have prevented \r\nthem from continuing to extend a hand of friendship \r\nand solidarity, even across ideological divides. \r\n Given Cuba’s peaceful, generous and cooperative \r\ninternational stance, it should not be isolated or \r\nexcluded from participation in regional and \r\nhemispheric processes. CARICOM reiterates its \r\nunwavering support for the right of the Cuban people \r\nto self-determination in a manner beneficial to their \r\nsocial and economic development. We call once again \r\nfor the end to an embargo that has preserved a state of \r\ntension between two neighbouring countries and \r\ngenerated concern, disquiet and discomfort throughout \r\nthe Caribbean. \r\n States continue to enjoy friendly relations with \r\nboth Cuba and the United States. These two \r\nneighbours — a mere 90 miles apart — have produced \r\ngreat scholars, scientists and global leaders. The two \r\ncountries possess proud and noble histories and are \r\npopulated by friendly, open and loving peoples. As \r\nsuch and in spite of a long history of dashed hopes, \r\nCARICOM continues to believe that a new beginning \r\nis possible in the relationship between the \r\nGovernments of Cuba and the United States. However, \r\nwe consider the lifting of the embargo to be a \r\nprerequisite of any meaningful rapprochement between \r\nthe two countries, not a negotiated end result.  \r\n While there have been some recent positive \r\nindications of flexibility, there have also been \r\nreminders of unilateral rigidity. For example, \r\nCARICOM notes with regret that the United States \r\nTrading with the Enemy Act — an Act that lists only \r\nCuba as its target — was renewed as recently as last \r\nmonth. Indeed, recent diplomatic activity only serves \r\n A/64/PV.27\r\n \r\n5 09-57988 \r\n \r\nto highlight the undeniable fact that the embargo \r\nremains firmly in place and that its imposition is a \r\ncontinued violation of international law and norms. \r\n We are optimistic that the recent recommitment \r\nby the United States to multilateralism will result in an \r\nincreased willingness to consider the opinions and \r\nconcerns of its global friends and partners. On this \r\nissue, global opinion can hardly be conveyed in a more \r\nconvincing or consistent manner. As such, our faith in \r\nthe recent pronouncements of the United States \r\nGovernment carries with it an expectation that these \r\nfew remaining historical and unilateral wrongs will be \r\nrighted expeditiously. It is within this context that \r\nCARICOM States unstintingly support the draft \r\nresolution on the necessity of ending the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo by the United States \r\nof America against Cuba.  \r\n Mr. Heller (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): At the \r\noutset, I should like to welcome the presence among us \r\nof the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba, Mr. Bruno \r\nRodríguez Parrilla.  \r\n For the eighteenth consecutive year, the Mexican \r\nGovernment is taking the floor to reiterate once again \r\nits rejection of the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo against Cuba and to restate its opposition to \r\nthe use of coercive actions that have no legal basis in \r\nthe United Nations Charter. Mexico underlines that \r\nsuch national measures, when applied extraterritorially \r\nto third countries, have severe humanitarian \r\nconsequences that are contrary to international law and \r\nreflect a repudiation of dialogue and diplomacy as the \r\nproper means to solve disputes among States.  \r\n As we have done since 1992, when the Cuban \r\nGovernment first introduced a draft resolution to the \r\nGeneral Assembly calling for an end to the embargo \r\nimposed by the Government of the United States of \r\nAmerica, Mexico takes the floor to reiterate its \r\nhistorical principled position that any political, \r\neconomic or military sanction imposed upon any State \r\nmust derive only from decisions or recommendations \r\nissued by the Security Council or the General \r\nAssembly. Multilateralism, respect for international \r\nlaw and the rules and principles that govern \r\ncoexistence among nations, and respectful dialogue \r\nremain the best way to resolve disputes and to ensure \r\npeaceful coexistence among States and an international \r\nclimate of peace.  \r\n Various United Nations organs and entities \r\nrecognize the negative impact the embargo has on the \r\neconomic and social development of Cuba, with \r\nsignificant damage to its economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial dealings. The embargo has also had a \r\nnegative impact on sensitive sectors that touch directly \r\non the everyday lives of the Cuban people, as well as \r\nindirect consequences on third countries prevented \r\nfrom interacting with Cuba in many economic and \r\nsocial activities. The vociferous outcry of the \r\ninternational community against such action reminds \r\nus that political, economic or military sanctions \r\nimposed on States must not be the result of unilateral \r\ndecisions. Rather, they must always result from \r\nmeasures adopted by the appropriate bodies of this \r\nOrganization, in accordance with the United Nations \r\nCharter and international law.  \r\n In that respect, on 23 October 1996 the Mexican \r\nGovernment enacted a law to protect trade and \r\ninvestments from foreign regulations that contravene \r\ninternational law. The law prohibits activities that \r\naffect trade or investment when such activities are a \r\nconsequence of the extraterritorial effects of foreign \r\nlegislation. Mexico has supported all initiatives against \r\nthe embargo and unilateral actions here at the United \r\nNations, in the United Nations Conference on Trade \r\nand Development and in other forums, such as the \r\nOrganization of American States (OAS), the Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean Economic System, the \r\nIbero-American Summit and the Rio Group. We have \r\nalso promoted opportunities for cooperation and \r\nrespectful dialogue based on the fact that the United \r\nStates embargo against Cuba reflects a policy that has \r\nweighed upon the Cuban population in a silent, \r\nsystematic and cumulative way for almost half a \r\ncentury. \r\n In this context, in addition to opposing the \r\neconomic, political and diplomatic isolation of Cuba, \r\nMexico has supported, at the Cuban Government’s \r\nrequest, Cuba’s membership in all regional \r\nmechanisms of integration in order to promote \r\neconomic and trade exchanges, as well as cooperation \r\nand development. In this regard, I wish to underscore \r\nthe support our Government offered for Cuba’s full \r\nmembership of the Rio Group in November 2008 in \r\nZacatecas, Mexico, with the full support of States \r\nmembers of that organization.  \r\n That historic moment contributed to cooperation \r\nand exchanges to promote development and strengthen \r\nA/64/PV.27  \r\n \r\n09-57988 6 \r\n \r\nmultilateralism and Latin American unity. It also \r\nprefigured the historic decision of the General \r\nAssembly of the Organization of American States, \r\nadopted by acclamation on 3 June 2009, revoking \r\nresolution VI of 31 January 1962, which excluded the \r\nGovernment of Cuba from participating in the \r\ninter-American system. The new decision establishes \r\nthat Cuba’s participation in the OAS will be the result \r\nof a process of dialogue and in accordance with the \r\npractices, purposes and principles of the OAS. \r\n Mexico considers that the facts we have outlined \r\ndemonstrate that exclusion, far from resolving \r\ndisputes, amplifies them to negative effect. We \r\ntherefore reiterate our support for the inclusion of Cuba \r\nin mechanisms of dialogue and global economic, \r\ncommercial and financial activity, pursuant to its own \r\nsovereign will and decisions. In this regard, Mexico \r\nwelcomes the measure taken by the United States \r\nGovernment to allow the flow of remittances and \r\nCuban-Americans between Cuba and the United States. \r\nWhile those measures may modestly contribute to \r\nimproving the prevailing environment, Mexico feels \r\nthat much remains to be done to truly and substantially \r\nmitigate the negative effects of the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo against Cuba. \r\n The Mexican Government bases its bilateral and \r\nmultilateral relations on the principles of international \r\nlaw that regulate peaceful and civilized coexistence \r\namong sovereign States in the modern world. Those \r\nprinciples have preserved solidarity and continuity in \r\nrelations between Mexico and Cuba. We have \r\nmaintained unbreakable historical ties supported by a \r\nclimate of renewed confidence, and consistently \r\nobserved the purposes and principles enshrined in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, in particular peaceful \r\ncoexistence, respect for sovereignty and sovereign \r\nequality among States, and non-interference in internal \r\naffairs. \r\n Based on our own experience, we are aware that \r\nsocieties evolve and change according to their own \r\ncircumstances, and not as a result of arbitrary and \r\ncoercive measures imposed from the outside. In light \r\nof that, the Government of Mexico reiterates its firm \r\ncommitment to actively and decisively contribute to \r\neffective international law in regard to this item on the \r\nagenda of the General Assembly, and will support the \r\ndraft resolution on this issue that has been introduced \r\nat the present session. \r\n Mr. Zhang Yesui (China) (spoke in Chinese): \r\nThe Chinese delegation welcomes the report submitted \r\nby the Secretary-General on this agenda item (A/64/97) \r\nand supports the statement made by the representative \r\nof the Sudan on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. \r\n China pursues an independent foreign policy of \r\npeace and is committed to developing friendly relations \r\nwith all countries on the basis of the five principles of \r\npeaceful coexistence. We are of the view that every \r\nsovereign State is entitled to independently choose its \r\nown suitable social system and path of development. \r\nNo country has the right to unilaterally impose \r\nmilitary, political, economic or other forms of \r\nsanctions on other countries. Experience shows that \r\nsanctions usually fail to achieve their expected results; \r\non the contrary, they may end up victimizing civilians, \r\nnot least of all the most vulnerable groups, such as \r\nwomen and children. \r\n For 17 consecutive years, the General Assembly \r\nhas adopted resolutions by an overwhelming majority, \r\nurging all countries, in compliance with the United \r\nNations Charter and the principles of international law, \r\nto repeal or invalidate all laws and measures with \r\nextraterritorial effect that compromise the sovereignty \r\nof other States, undermine the legitimate rights and \r\ninterests of entities and individuals under the \r\njurisdiction of those States, and affect freedom of trade \r\nand navigation. \r\n Regrettably, however, those resolutions have not \r\nbeen effectively implemented over the years, and the \r\nlong-term economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo against Cuba imposed by the country \r\nconcerned is still in place. This not only constitutes a \r\nserious violation of the purposes and principles of the \r\nCharter, but also seriously undermines the Cuban \r\npeople’s rights to survival and development. \r\n As the Secretary-General describes in his report, \r\nby December 2008, the embargo had inflicted direct \r\neconomic damage on Cuba totalling over $96 billion, \r\nimmeasurably constraining the efforts of the Cuban \r\npeople to eradicate poverty, promote economic and \r\nsocial development, and achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. \r\n The international community is now faced with \r\nthe serious challenges of the global financial, food, and \r\nenergy crises, as well as climate change, which makes \r\nthe embargo and sanctions against Cuba all the more \r\nunreasonable. We have noted that, in April this year, \r\n A/64/PV.27\r\n \r\n7 09-57988 \r\n \r\nthe United States Government lifted travel and \r\nremittance restrictions on Cuban-Americans. We \r\nwelcome this move and hope that the United States will \r\ncontinue to improve its relations with Cuba and \r\npromote normal exchanges between the peoples of the \r\ntwo countries. \r\n In today’s world, multilateralism and \r\ndemocratization of international relations strike a chord \r\nin people’s hearts, while openness, cooperation, mutual \r\nrespect and win-win progress have become the \r\nconsensus of the international community. When \r\ndisputes arise, dialogue on equal footing and in the \r\nspirit of friendly consultation is the best way to achieve \r\nprogress. \r\n The Chinese Government has always maintained \r\nthat countries should develop their relations in \r\ncompliance with the purposes and principles of the \r\nCharter. It is always our hope that there will be \r\ndialogue rather than confrontation, and engagement \r\nand exchanges rather than embargo and sanctions in \r\nState-to-State relations. The Chinese Government \r\ntherefore demands that the country concerned \r\nterminate as soon as possible its economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo against Cuba.  \r\n In this connection, China supports the draft \r\nresolution submitted by Cuba under the current agenda \r\nitem. \r\n Mr. Vyas (India): At the outset I would like to \r\nthank the Secretary-General for his report (A/64/97) on \r\nthe agenda item entitled “Necessity of ending the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed \r\nby the United States of America against Cuba”. My \r\ndelegation associates itself with the statement made by \r\nthe Chair of the Group of 77. \r\n For the past 17 consecutive years, the General \r\nAssembly, while deliberating this agenda item, has \r\ncategorically and overwhelmingly rejected the \r\nimposition of laws and regulations with extraterritorial \r\nimpact. \r\n The General Assembly has also called upon all \r\nStates, in compliance with their obligations under the \r\nCharter and the principles of international law, to \r\nrefrain from promulgating and applying, as well as \r\nrepealing and invalidating laws and measures that have \r\nextraterritorial effects on the sovereignty of other \r\nStates, the legitimate interests of entities or persons \r\nunder their jurisdiction and on the freedom of trade and \r\nnavigation. \r\n Unfortunately, those repeated resolutions remain \r\nunimplemented. The nearly five-decade-old United \r\nStates embargo on Cuba, including its extraterritorial \r\naspects, continues to remain in force. We share the \r\nviews expressed by the international community in its \r\nopposition to the extraterritorial aspect of the embargo. \r\n In the report of the Secretary-General, various \r\nUnited Nations entities have detailed the impact of the \r\nembargo, particularly its extraterritorial effects. For \r\nexample, the United Nations Resident Coordinator in \r\nHavana has noted that humanitarian and development \r\ncooperation implemented by the United Nations system \r\nin Cuba is significantly affected by the embargo. The \r\nembargo also adversely impacts the functioning of \r\nUnited Nations offices, including travel for United \r\nNations staff. \r\n The United Nations Development Programme \r\n(UNDP) has stated that the effects of the embargo can \r\nbe observed in all spheres of Cuba’s social and \r\neconomic activities, as well as in its effect on the most \r\nvulnerable groups and on human development in \r\ngeneral. It highlights the negative consequences of the \r\nembargo on UNDP’s development coordination \r\nactivities, including an average increase of 15 per cent \r\nin project cost. \r\n The United Nations Conference on Trade and \r\nDevelopment refers to the attendant costs of the \r\nembargo, both for Cuba and for citizens in third \r\ncountries, due to its extraterritorial application. The \r\nUnited Nations Population Fund states that the impact \r\nof the embargo on some of its programmes was felt \r\nespecially hard. The Economic Commission for Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean has stated that the embargo \r\nadversely affects the standard of living of Cuban \r\ncitizens. The health sector has been among those \r\naffected, on account of enhanced costs and restrictions \r\non equipment and technologies. Thus, the embargo has \r\nalso had an indirect extraterritorial impact on Cuba’s \r\nefforts at South-South cooperation in this field. \r\nMoreover, the natural disasters suffered by Cuba last \r\nyear and the ongoing financial and economic crisis \r\nhave made the impact of the embargo more acute. \r\n Given their geography, Cuba and the United \r\nStates of America could be expected to be natural \r\npartners in trade and investment. While the embargo \r\nhas not permitted this, the potential for economic and \r\nA/64/PV.27  \r\n \r\n09-57988 8 \r\n \r\ncommercial ties between the two countries clearly \r\nexists. For example, by taking advantage of limited \r\nopenings under the United States Trade Sanctions \r\nReform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000, the \r\nUnited States has become the largest exporter of \r\nagricultural products to Cuba. The United States \r\nInternational Trade Commission itself estimates that \r\nthis would rise sharply if restrictions were lifted, which \r\nunderscores the negative impact of the embargo on \r\nUnited States trade and business opportunities. Various \r\nefforts in the United States to relax or lift the embargo \r\nindicate that there is substantial interest, in particular \r\nin the business sector, in unhindered access to the \r\nCuban market or in having contact with Cuba. \r\n We are encouraged by the steps announced by the \r\ncurrent United States Administration earlier this year to \r\nreduce restrictions on travel and on the sending of \r\nremittances to Cuba by Cuban-Americans and on \r\nUnited States telecommunications services. We look \r\nforward to the full lifting of sanctions and embargo \r\nagainst Cuba. \r\n In conclusion, I reiterate India’s opposition to \r\ncountries taking unilateral measures that impinge on \r\nthe sovereignty of another country, including attempts \r\nto extend the application of one country’s laws \r\nextraterritorially to other sovereign nations. \r\n Mr. Le Luong Minh (Viet Nam): The delegation \r\nof Viet Nam fully aligns itself with the statements \r\nmade on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement and of \r\nthe Group of 77 and China. I welcome the participation \r\nof His Excellency, Mr. Bruno Eduardo Rodríguez \r\nParrilla, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba, in this \r\nimportant meeting of the General Assembly. \r\n For 17 consecutive years, at each and every \r\nsession, the General Assembly has demanded an end to \r\nthe unilateral economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo imposed by the United States of America \r\nagainst Cuba. Annual resolutions on the necessity of \r\nending the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo imposed by the United States of America \r\nagainst Cuba have won increasingly broad support and \r\nhave been adopted with virtual unanimity. \r\n The embargo unilaterally imposed by the United \r\nStates of America against Cuba constitutes a serious \r\nviolation of international law, including of \r\ninternational laws relating to the freedom of trade and \r\nnavigation, sovereign equality and non-interference in \r\nthe internal affairs of States. This runs counter to the \r\nuniversally recognized norms governing relations \r\nbetween sovereign countries regardless of their \r\npolitical systems and their chosen paths of \r\ndevelopment, as well as to the fundamental principles, \r\npurposes and spirit of the Charter of the United \r\nNations. \r\n Apart from causing losses worth billions of \r\ndollars to the Cuban economy, the embargo has, for the \r\npast year, continued to inflict considerable hardships \r\non the Cuban people, in particular on women and \r\nchildren, making it extremely difficult for them to fully \r\nrecover from a series of destructive natural disasters, \r\nlet alone attain success in their efforts towards \r\nsocio-economic development, national reconstruction \r\nand implementation of the internationally agreed \r\ndevelopment goals, including the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. The embargo has also hurt those \r\nwishing to develop legitimate, normal and mutually \r\nbeneficial economic, financial and trade relations with \r\nCuba, including a large number of American \r\nbusinesses and individuals. \r\n We concur with President Obama of the United \r\nStates when he eloquently declared at the opening of \r\nthe general debate of the current General Assembly that  \r\n “Democracy cannot be imposed on any nation \r\nfrom the outside. Each society must search for its \r\nown path, and no path is perfect. Each country \r\nwill pursue a path rooted in the culture of its \r\npeople and in its past traditions”. (A/64/PV.3) \r\n Disputes among States should and can only be \r\nresolved through peaceful dialogue and negotiations on \r\nthe basis of equality, mutual respect for each other’s \r\nindependence and sovereignty and the principle of the \r\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of States. \r\n We join the majority of Member States in \r\ndemanding that the Government of the United States of \r\nAmerica put an end to the unilateral economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo against Cuba in \r\norder to ease the hardships and difficulties unduly \r\ninflicted upon the people of Cuba, reduce tension and \r\ncreate an atmosphere conducive to constructive efforts \r\ntowards a normalization of the relations between the \r\ntwo countries in the interests of the peace, stability and \r\ndevelopment of the whole region. \r\n Viet Nam reaffirms its support for and solidarity \r\nwith the Government and people of Cuba and stands \r\nready, together with the international community, to \r\n A/64/PV.27\r\n \r\n9 09-57988 \r\n \r\ncontinue assisting them to overcome the consequences \r\nof this embargo. In that spirit, Viet Nam will vote in \r\nfavour of draft resolution A/64/L.4, submitted by Cuba. \r\n Mr. Kleib (Indonesia): For yet another year, we \r\nare assembled here to address the issue of ending the \r\neconomic embargo imposed on Cuba since 1962. In \r\naddressing this matter, Indonesia aligns its views with \r\nthose expressed by the distinguished representative of \r\nthe Sudan, on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, and \r\nby the distinguished representative of Egypt, on behalf \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement. \r\n Conventional wisdom dictates that geographic \r\nproximity between the two countries should be a strong \r\nreason for close bilateral relations. Relations among \r\nStates — any States — will be constantly tested by \r\nwaves of change. States will always face the challenge \r\nof maintaining a delicate balance between cooperation \r\nand competition. Actions by States are naturally guided \r\nby their own national interests, restrained by \r\ninternational norms and standards. \r\n Thus, differences will always remain between and \r\namong countries, and tensions could always arise \r\nbetween nations. But that should not prevent any \r\nmovement towards creating a space for cooperation, a \r\nspace that allows the two States, the two peoples and \r\nthe business communities to seek and establish a \r\ncommon ground where both sides can benefit, grow \r\nand nurture the tree of friendship, mutual respect and \r\ncooperation. \r\n For this reason, it is pertinent to highlight the \r\nspirit of global partnership required for development, \r\nas set out in the Millennium Declaration, the \r\nMonterrey Consensus and the Johannesburg Plan of \r\nImplementation. Such commitments, made at the \r\nhighest level, urged countries to cooperate, to set aside \r\ndifferences and to work for the common good of \r\nbillions of people. \r\n The current global economic crisis, ongoing \r\nclimate change and the energy and food crises have \r\nseverely curtailed efforts by Cuba to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. The United States can \r\nbring much-needed assistance by lifting its policy of \r\nembargo. In that regard we would like to reiterate the \r\ncall made by heads of State and Government at the \r\nfifteenth summit of the Non-Aligned Movement, in \r\nSharm el-Sheik, Egypt, for an immediate end to that \r\nembargo in the name of humanity. That would help \r\nCuba, a developing country, to continue efforts to \r\neradicate poverty and hunger from its midst and bring \r\nhope of prosperity to millions of Cubans.  \r\n Clearly, there is much to gain by cooperation and \r\nless to gain by confrontation. From that perspective, \r\nIndonesia believes that dialogue and negotiation offer \r\nthe most viable solution for resolving existing \r\ndisagreements. The United Nations Charter clearly \r\nstipulates its preference for that avenue towards peace. \r\n This issue has been on the agenda of the General \r\nAssembly for many years, but tangible results are yet \r\nto be seen. Forty-seven years have passed, yet there \r\nhave been only tortoise-like movements without major \r\npositive results. Year after year, through its resolutions \r\nthe General Assembly has urged the two countries to \r\ndismantle the barriers that sustain unhealthy relations \r\nbetween them. \r\n This year we have reason to be optimistic. Steps \r\nare being taken towards normalizing relations, and \r\nthere are encouraging signs to confirm that. That is \r\ntruly one essential step, and it merits our support. We \r\nstress our hope that the once-icy relations between \r\nthese two neighbours will end and a new era of \r\ncooperation and engagement will blossom in the years \r\nto come. The ending of the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial blockade cannot come too soon. We support \r\nthe draft resolution on this agenda item. \r\n Mr. Benmehidi (Algeria) (spoke in French): \r\nPermit me first to welcome among us the Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Cuba. We endorse the statements \r\nmade by the Sudan and Egypt on behalf of the Group \r\nof 77 and the Non-Aligned Movement respectively.  \r\n More than half a century after its unilateral \r\nimposition, the economic, commercial and financial \r\nblockade of the United States of America against Cuba \r\nis still in place. We are meeting today for the \r\nseventeenth consecutive year to restate the appeal of \r\nthe General Assembly and the unceasing call of the \r\ninternational community for an end to that blockade, \r\nwhich is unjust and contrary to international law and \r\ninternational legitimacy. At a time when the values of \r\ncooperation, dialogue, solidarity and mutual assistance \r\nare more established than ever as the general trend in \r\ninternational relations, that blockade is an anomaly and \r\nruns counter to global developments.  \r\n Algeria reiterates its appeal for the lifting of the \r\ntrade, economic and financial blockade that Cuba is \r\nfacing. It violates the principles of the sovereign \r\nA/64/PV.27  \r\n \r\n09-57988 10 \r\n \r\nequality of States and non-interference in the internal \r\naffairs of another State and is an obstacle to the Cuban \r\npeople’s right to development.  \r\n Extraterritorial legislation by a State that is aimed \r\nat imposing unilateral sanctions is a flagrant violation \r\nof the principles of the Charter and the rules of \r\ninternational relations. Apart from the fact that it \r\nviolates the relevant provisions of the Charter, that \r\nattitude calls into question freedom of trade, navigation \r\nand movement of capital, which substantially hampers \r\nthe economic development of Cuba and its people. \r\nAlgeria states its profound concern as to the grave \r\nconsequences of the blockade, which are as unjust as \r\nthey are illegal.  \r\n Algeria reiterates its firm support for the position \r\nadopted by the Fifteenth Summit of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement, the decisions adopted at the Second South \r\nSummit, held in June 2005, and all declarations that \r\nhave rejected the coercive economic measures and \r\nextraterritorial laws imposed on developing countries \r\nand demanded that the United States of America lift the \r\nblockade imposed on Cuba. \r\n Algeria reiterates its appeal to the United States \r\nto lift the blockade, which has constantly been rejected \r\nby an increasing number of countries year after year, to \r\nthe point where today it is nearly unanimously \r\ndenounced. \r\n Mr. Sangqu (South Africa): South Africa \r\ncontinues to support the resolution before us, entitled \r\n“Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba”. We do so because that \r\nrelentless and unilateral action against Cuba has caused \r\nuntold suffering to her people. \r\n The unity with which the international \r\ncommunity has reacted in condemnation of the \r\nembargo, with a record vote of 185 to 3 in 2008, is \r\ntestimony that the time has come for it to be lifted and \r\nthereby end the suffering of the Cuban civilian \r\npopulation, who are carrying the brunt of that injustice.  \r\n The time to end the embargo is long overdue. \r\nSouth Africa is guided by the basic norms of \r\ninternational law and conduct in its principled support \r\nfor the need to eliminate coercive economic measures \r\nas a means of political and economic coercion. \r\n We similarly recognize the sovereignty of States \r\nto develop national legislation. However, when such \r\nlegislation takes on an extraterritorial reach, as is the \r\ncase with the legislation that has been directed towards \r\nCuba, the outcome of such action impacts on the very \r\nraison d’être for the existence of this Organization — \r\nthe United Nations. \r\n South Africa views the continued imposition of \r\nan economic, commercial and financial embargo as a \r\nviolation of the principles of the sovereign equality of \r\nStates. South Africa has thus repeatedly joined the \r\nmajority of countries in expressing its disagreement \r\nwith and opposition to the embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States of America against Cuba. \r\n Throughout the period of this embargo, the \r\nCuban people have extended a hand of friendship and \r\nsolidarity to other peoples around the world. Cuba’s \r\noutstanding work in the areas of health, education and \r\nbiotechnology in many developing countries and the \r\nworld in general is recognized by the international \r\ncommunity. Cuba’s contributions to supporting \r\nstruggles for self-determination, freedom and justice \r\naround the world are also noted. South Africa \r\ncontinues to recognize Cuba’s contribution to our own \r\nfreedom and democracy. The role that Cuba played in \r\nSouth Africa’s liberation history in solidarity with our \r\npeople was celebrated last year during the twentieth \r\nanniversary of the battle of Cuito Cuanavale, which \r\nwas a decisive turning point in the struggle against \r\napartheid and opened the doors for the liberation of \r\nSouth Africa. \r\n In November this year, Cuba will host the sixth \r\nsession of the Joint Bilateral Commission with South \r\nAfrica. Through this cooperative mechanism, the \r\nGovernments of South Africa and Cuba strive to \r\nexpand the already sound relations in various areas of \r\ncooperation. Through the bilateral cooperation projects \r\nin the context of the Joint Bilateral Commission, Cuba \r\nis greatly assisting South Africa to address its skills-\r\nshortage problems through the provision of \r\nprofessional workers and trainers in myriad areas. \r\n The economic, commercial and financial \r\nblockade imposed against Cuba is an obstacle to the \r\neconomic and social development of the country. It is \r\ntherefore incumbent on all of us, as equal Members of \r\nthe United Nations, to urge adherence to the principles \r\nof our Charter. While international best practice nudges \r\nStates towards engaging in robust trade and investment \r\nwithin a globalized economy, it is unacceptable that \r\n A/64/PV.27\r\n \r\n11 09-57988 \r\n \r\nCuba is prevented from reintegrating into the world \r\ntrading system. \r\n The United Nations prides itself in rendering \r\nmuch-needed humanitarian assistance to those Member \r\nStates that are afflicted by natural disasters or conflicts. \r\nWe must continue to ensure that that track record of \r\nbeing responsive to humanitarian need is not tainted in \r\nany way, especially by denying the Cuban people \r\naccess to affordable medical goods and services \r\nbecause of an embargo that, it is claimed, is enforced \r\nfor their own good. \r\n The extremely harsh global economic and \r\nfinancial climate only worsens the fate of the Cuban \r\npeople. The international community should therefore \r\ntake steps to free the Cuban people from the embargo. \r\n While we welcome the positive rapprochement \r\ninitiated by the current United States Administration \r\nand encourage it to continue on that path, we call on \r\nthe United States to end its unilateral isolation of Cuba. \r\nWe encourage the United States to engage in a \r\nmeaningful dialogue with Cuba in order to accelerate \r\nthe dismantling of those unjust sanctions against Cuba \r\nand its people. \r\n South Africa will join the majority in this \r\nAssembly in supporting the draft resolution before us \r\ntoday. South Africa wishes to associate itself with the \r\nstatement delivered by the representative of the Sudan \r\non behalf of the Group of 77 and China. \r\n Mr. Kapambwe (Zambia): My delegation is \r\ngrateful to you, Mr. President, for providing the \r\nopportunity to participate in this important debate. I \r\nwish to begin by associating myself with the \r\nstatements by the representative of the Sudan on behalf \r\nof the Group of 77 and China and by the representative \r\nof Egypt on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement. \r\n Zambia commends the Secretary-General for the \r\nreport contained in document A/64/97, entitled \r\n“Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba”, which provides useful \r\ninformation. \r\n My Government believes that the continuation of \r\nthe embargo is a violation of international law as \r\ncontained in international covenants. It is for that \r\nreason that this body has in the past called on the \r\nUnited States of America to reconsider its position. The \r\nactions of Member States on this resolution have \r\nconsistently demonstrated the clear conflict of the \r\nembargo with the tenets of the conduct of international \r\nrelationships. Accordingly, I wish to reaffirm my \r\nGovernment’s position that lifting the embargo will be \r\nthe best way forward. Against this background, my \r\ndelegation continues to regard the extraterritorial \r\neffects of the embargo on third countries as further \r\nworsening the already desperate socio-economic \r\nconditions in Cuba. \r\n It is our conviction that discussions on the agenda \r\nitem before us should not end up as mere formalities \r\nbut should result in measures that can be implemented. \r\nIt is the expectation of the Cuban people on this, the \r\nfiftieth anniversary of the embargo, that through this \r\nAssembly the international community should send \r\nthem a strong message that it is concerned by their \r\nplight; that together, the United Nations stands on high \r\nground to induce the lifting of the embargo. \r\n In conclusion, I wish to reaffirm the continued \r\nsupport of the Zambian Government for the call to \r\nbring to an end the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba. In the light of the foregoing, my \r\ndelegation will vote in favour of draft resolution \r\nA/64/L.4, calling for the lifting of the embargo. \r\n Mr. Valero Briceño (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): The Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela supports the statements made in \r\nthe General Assembly on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement and of the Group of 77 and China on the \r\nnecessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba. \r\n The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, committed \r\nto the values of humanism and solidarity among \r\npeoples, condemns the application of any unilateral \r\nmeasure of an extraterritorial nature that violates the \r\nnorms and principles of international law. The \r\nblockade against Cuba breaches the principles of self-\r\ndetermination and sovereignty of peoples and States. It \r\nis a repeated refusal by a country signatory of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations of another Member \r\nState’s right to development — in this case, the heroic \r\nRepublic of Cuba. That policy represents a systematic \r\nviolation of the human rights of the Cuban people. It \r\nalso violates the constitutional rights of the people of \r\nthe United States, including the freedom to travel to \r\nCuba. \r\nA/64/PV.27  \r\n \r\n09-57988 12 \r\n \r\n The embargo against the heroic Cuban people is \r\nthe longest, cruelest and most unfair in the history of \r\nhumanity. It is the main obstacle for the economic and \r\nsocial development of Cuba. The impact on the \r\neconomy is astronomical. It is equivalent to double the \r\nexpenditures of the United States in implementing the \r\nMarshall Plan in the years after the Second World War. \r\nThe embargo against Cuba can be classified as \r\ngenocide, given what is set out in paragraph (c) of \r\nArticle II of the Convention on the Prevention and \r\nPunishment of the Crime of Genocide. It is also an act \r\nof economic warfare, according to the Declaration \r\nconcerning the Laws of Naval War approved by the \r\nLondon Naval Conference. \r\n There is no historical precedent for the Cuba \r\nembargo. No country, not even those considered sworn \r\nenemies of the United States, has been the object of \r\nsuch criminal measures. The embargo violates the rules \r\nof the international systems of commerce and \r\nnavigation; it has an impact on the legitimate interests \r\nof any sovereign State that wishes to become a partner \r\nof Cuba. The extraterritorial application of United \r\nStates laws, together with the hostility to the legitimate \r\ninterests of companies and citizens of third-party \r\ncountries, is an issue of concern to the entire \r\ninternational community. It represents a threat to world \r\npeace and an outright attack on the self-determination \r\nand sovereignty of peoples and States. \r\n The embargo against Cuba has also affected the \r\nVenezuelan people and other peoples of the world, \r\nespecially those of the Caribbean, as was expressed \r\nhere by the delegation of the Caribbean Community. In \r\nthe case of Venezuela, we should point out that the \r\nUnited States Government recently refused to grant \r\npermission to a transnational company to carry out a \r\nbusiness transaction with Cuba involving the sale of \r\ndefibrillators to Venezuela to address heart disease, one \r\nof the leading causes of death in our countries. \r\n There are great expectations of President Barack \r\nObama’s Government, but there is no evidence to \r\nsuggest that the Cuba embargo will be lifted, since all \r\nthe laws and administrative provisions that underpin it \r\nare still in place. Vice-President Joseph Biden has said, \r\nand no one has denied, that the United States \r\nGovernment will maintain the blockade against Cuba \r\nas a “pressure tool”. The half-hearted measures \r\nadopted so far do not alter the legal framework on \r\nwhich the embargo and its continued application rest. \r\nThe political, administrative and repressive \r\nmechanisms that guarantee thorough implementation of \r\nthe embargo remain intact. \r\n President Barack Obama received this year’s \r\nNobel Peace Prize. To meet the expectations raised \r\naround the world his Government should pay close \r\nattention, among the most important issues, to the call \r\nof this Assembly, repeated every year, to lift the \r\nblockade against the heroic people of Cuba, the heroic \r\nrepublic under the leadership of Comandante Fidel \r\nCastro. This is an emblematic issue, and that is why the \r\nPresident of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, \r\nHugo Chávez Frías, has called on the President of the \r\nUnited States to end the blockade and prove that, in the \r\nwords of President Chávez, he “is worthy of the Nobel \r\nPeace Prize”.  \r\n The United States has systematically refused to \r\ncomply with the resolutions adopted by the General \r\nAssembly of the United Nations demanding that the \r\nembargo against the Cuban people be lifted. How long \r\nwill this inhuman policy, rejected all over the world, \r\ncontinue? What can the General Assembly — the most \r\nrepresentative body of the United Nations — do in \r\nlight of such stubborn non-compliance? \r\n For all of these reasons, the Bolivarian Republic \r\nof Venezuela again votes in support of the resolution \r\ndemanding the lifting of the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba. \r\n Mr. Sin Son Ho (Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea): The economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo imposed by the United States of America \r\nagainst the Republic of Cuba has been in place for \r\n50 years, in spite of strong demands by an absolute \r\nmajority of Member States of the United Nations. The \r\nembargo, which has been enforced unilaterally by the \r\nUnited States under the pretext of accelerating a \r\ndemocratic transition in Cuba, is aimed at \r\noverthrowing the social system selected by the \r\nGovernment and people of Cuba. That constitutes a \r\ngrave violation of principles, such as respect for \r\nsovereignty, territorial integrity and non-interference in \r\ninternal affairs that are enshrined in the United Nations \r\nCharter and international law. \r\n Cuba has already suffered losses of hundreds of \r\nbillions of dollars in various areas of its economy \r\nbecause of the cruel embargo imposed by the United \r\nStates, which has also had a severe impact on the social \r\nlife and well-being of the Cuban people. The embargo, \r\n A/64/PV.27\r\n \r\n13 09-57988 \r\n \r\na silent economic war against the people of Cuba, is an \r\nillegal and inhumane act that has no justification at all, \r\npolitically, legally or morally. No coercive measure of \r\na unilateral and extraterritorial nature, devised in order \r\nto pursue sinister political purposes and to impose a \r\npolitical, economic and social system based on one \r\ncountry’s own perspective, can ever be justified or \r\ntolerated in any way. \r\n For the last 17 years, therefore, the General \r\nAssembly has adopted resolutions rejecting and calling \r\nfor an immediate end to the United States unilateral \r\nembargo against Cuba, with the overwhelming support \r\nof Member States, barring a very few countries, \r\nincluding the United States. We also remind the \r\nAssembly that the heads of State and Government of \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement reaffirmed their rejection \r\nof, and urged an immediate end to, the United States \r\nembargo against Cuba at the Movement’s fifteenth \r\nSummit Conference, held in July 2009 in Sharm \r\nel-Sheikh, Egypt. \r\n There have been some media reports on probable \r\nchange in United States policy towards Cuba since the \r\nObama Administration took office, but in fact there has \r\nbeen no change in their policy of maintaining the \r\nembargo as a tool to put pressure on Cuba. If it is \r\ngenuinely willing to improve relations and to coexist \r\nwith Cuba and every other nation, the United States \r\nshould take substantial measures to move away from \r\nthe outdated mentality of the cold-war era and conform \r\nwith the expectations of people throughout the world. \r\n It is the consistent position of the Government of \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to oppose \r\nall forms of interference, threat of the use of force and \r\nsanctions against sovereign States. \r\n The delegation of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic strongly urges the United States Government \r\nto immediately and unconditionally end the unilateral \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo against \r\nCuba, comply with all relevant General Assembly \r\nresolutions and compensate Cuba for the economic \r\nlosses that have resulted from the embargo. \r\n The delegation of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea fully supports the adoption of the \r\ndraft resolution on ending the embargo against Cuba \r\nand extends its firm support to and solidarity with the \r\njust cause of the Government and people of Cuba for \r\ndefending their national sovereignty and achieving \r\neconomic development, social progress and prosperity \r\nof their nation. \r\n Mrs. Waffa-Ogoo (Gambia): Mr. President, I \r\nwish to thank you for convening this debate on agenda \r\nitem 19, entitled “Necessity of ending the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States of America against Cuba”. The report of \r\nthe Secretary-General (A/64/97) amply documents the \r\ndevastation caused by the continued imposition of the \r\nembargo against Cuba.  \r\n In his remarks to this body at the 2009 general \r\ndebate, His Excellency Al Hadji Yahya Jammeh said,  \r\n  “My delegation … calls on the United \r\nNations to urge the United States of America to \r\nimmediately and unconditionally lift its embargo \r\non Cuba, in accordance with the wishes of more \r\nthan 98 per cent of the membership of this body. \r\nThat trade embargo continues to hurt Cuban \r\nwomen and children. The Cuban children born \r\ninto those extreme hardships have committed no \r\ncrime. The punishment of women and children \r\nbecause of political differences is a very serious \r\nviolation of their rights.” (A/64/PV.6, pp. 29-30)  \r\nUNICEF’s contribution to the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport makes it clear that even children with special \r\nneeds are not spared the impact of the embargo. \r\n My delegation therefore joins the overwhelming \r\nmajority of the Member States in the Assembly in \r\ncalling for an immediate end to the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States of America on Cuba. For 18 consecutive \r\nyears, the General Assembly, reflecting the voice and \r\nmoral authority of the people of this world, has \r\nrejected the embargo as contrary to international law.  \r\n The harm that the embargo has inflicted on the \r\nCuban people is incalculable in terms of human \r\nsuffering and deprivation of essential commodities. \r\nAlmost every sector of Cuban society is affected by the \r\npunitive reach of extraterritorial application of the \r\nembargo. The loss and damage to the Cuban economy, \r\nhealth, education, tourism, culture and many other \r\nareas is well documented in the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport.  \r\n The Gambia has consistently opposed the \r\nembargo and is of the firm belief that its continued \r\napplication serves no other purpose than to punish the \r\nCuban people and Government for their political \r\nA/64/PV.27  \r\n \r\n09-57988 14 \r\n \r\nstance. Let us remind ourselves once again that we are \r\nin the twenty-first century and that the best way to \r\nsolve our problems is through dialogue and \r\nmultilateralism.  \r\n To paraphrase President Barack Obama, we call \r\non the United States to embrace a new era of \r\nengagement with Cuba based on mutual interest and \r\nmutual respect, in order to build a new coalition that \r\nbridges all divides. We call on the United States \r\nGovernment to take a serious look at this year’s draft \r\nresolution (A/64/L.4) and honour its demands. My \r\ndelegation believes that the time has come for the \r\nUnited States to open a new chapter in its bilateral \r\nrelations with Cuba, beginning with the immediate \r\ndismantling of the sanctions regime.  \r\n It is in the interest of the United States, Cuba and \r\nthe international community to see an end to this \r\nextraterritorial regime. It is our hope that this year’s \r\ndraft resolution will usher in a new era of cooperation, \r\ndialogue and mutual respect and ultimately lead to the \r\nimmediate and unconditional lifting of the embargo. \r\n Mr. Savostianov (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): The Russian delegation would first and \r\nforemost like to express appreciation to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his comprehensive report contained in \r\ndocument A/64/97. The report presents the opinions of \r\nthe Member States that have unanimously expressed \r\ntheir disagreement with and objections to the \r\nintroduction of the unilateral and extraterritorial \r\neconomic, commercial and financial blockade against \r\nCuba.  \r\n Russia’s position of principle in respect of the \r\nresolution on this issue is well known. Our country \r\nwholeheartedly shares the opinion of the overwhelming \r\nmajority of members of the international community in \r\nresolutely condemning the American blockade of Cuba \r\nand calling for its swift lifting. We are convinced that \r\nending the anti-Cuban embargo and normalizing \r\nAmerican-Cuban relations as a whole will contribute to \r\nredressing the situation with respect to Cuba and to its \r\nfurther reintegration into continent-wide structures.  \r\n We consider that the maintenance of the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial blockade of Cuba \r\nis counterproductive and anachronistic, inconsistent \r\nwith today’s realities. We welcome the April decision \r\nof Barack Obama’s Administration to lift a number of \r\nrestrictions on visits to Cuba by United States citizens \r\nwho have relatives there and on monetary and postal \r\ntransfers to Cubans from the United States. We trust \r\nthat other actions to improve relations between the two \r\ncountries will follow, ultimately leading to the full end \r\nof the long-obsolete economic and commercial \r\nembargo against Cuba.  \r\n For the time being, we feel that it is necessary to \r\ncontinue our policy of supporting the draft resolution \r\ndemanding the lifting of the blockade, guided by the \r\nfundamental principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations on the inadmissibility of any discriminatory \r\nmeasures or interference in the internal affairs of \r\nStates. \r\n Mr. Khazaee (Islamic Republic of Iran): At the \r\noutset, I would like to thank the Secretary-General for \r\nhis report submitted under agenda item 19, entitled \r\n“Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba” (A/64/97). \r\n My delegation also associates itself with the \r\nstatement made by the Permanent Representative of the \r\nSudan on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.  \r\n The adoption of resolution 63/7 — the most \r\nrecent in a long chain of resolutions that the Assembly \r\nhas adopted on this subject with such strong support — \r\nclearly indicates the strong objection of the \r\ninternational community to unilateral economic \r\ncoercive measures in general and to the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed against \r\nCuba in particular.  \r\n Resorting to an embargo as a tool to attain \r\npolitical objectives seriously undermines the collective \r\nefforts of Member States to achieve economic growth \r\nand sustainable development at the national, regional \r\nand international levels. Therefore, these consecutive \r\nresolutions, which call on all States to refrain from \r\napplying such laws and measures and to take necessary \r\nsteps to repeal or invalidate them, are wise and \r\nlaudable reactions by the international community to \r\nsuch unacceptable measures. \r\n Nevertheless, we are deeply concerned that, \r\ndespite so many appeals contained in resolutions of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and recommendations adopted by \r\nthe Human Rights Council and at several major United \r\nNations conferences, unilateral coercive measures, \r\nwith all their negative implications, continue to be \r\nimposed and implemented. \r\n A/64/PV.27\r\n \r\n15 09-57988 \r\n \r\n It is worth recalling paragraph 102 of the \r\nJohannesburg Plan of Implementation of the World \r\nSummit on Sustainable Development, which clearly \r\nurges Member States to take steps with a view to avoid \r\nand refrain from any unilateral measure that impedes \r\nthe full achievement of economic and social \r\ndevelopment by the people of the affected countries.  \r\n My delegation reiterates its long-standing \r\nposition that the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo against Cuba runs counter to the principles of \r\ninternational law governing relations among States and \r\ncontradicts the letter and spirit of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. Therefore, we strongly reject the \r\nimplementation of unilateral economic and trade \r\nmeasures by one State against another that affect the \r\nfree flow of international trade and financial resources. \r\nWe further denounce the extraterritorial application of \r\nnational legislation to other States. \r\n Indeed, such measures continue to adversely \r\nimpact the living conditions and human rights of the \r\nCuban people and to hamper the efforts of the Cuban \r\nGovernment in eradicating poverty and hunger, \r\npromoting health and education — indispensable \r\nelements of economic and social development — and \r\nachieving internationally agreed development goals, \r\nincluding the Millennium Development Goals.  \r\n The Islamic Republic of Iran, along with many \r\nother States Members of the United Nations, \r\nemphasizes the urgent need for an immediate end to \r\nsuch measures and for the full implementation of all \r\nrelevant General Assembly resolutions. \r\n Mrs. Viotti (Brazil) (spoke in Spanish): I should \r\nlike at the outset to welcome the presence among us of \r\nMr. Bruno Eduardo Rodríguez Parrilla, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Cuba.  \r\n The commercial and financial embargo against \r\nCuba is an issue that has occupied us for nearly \r\n50 years. Last year saw the most impressive display of \r\nsupport for the traditional resolution on this subject. \r\nLet us hope that we can celebrate the long-awaited \r\ninternational consensus that would enable us to settle \r\nthis unresolved item on the agenda of our \r\nOrganization. Let us hope that we can keep pace with \r\nhistory, which has already consigned to the grave so \r\nmany other anachronisms of the cold war era. Let us \r\nhope that we can overcome one of the last obstacles \r\npreventing us from finally entering the twenty-first \r\ncentury, free of the constraints of an international order \r\nwhose elements of conflict we do not wish to pass on \r\nto future generations.  \r\n We have grounds for optimism. Last year, the \r\nwinds of change finally began to blow. The first \r\ntangible movement was Cuba’s full integration into the \r\nRio Group as a result of a presidential decision late in \r\n2008. The presence of that brotherly nation in a \r\nmechanism for building political consensus will be \r\nvaluable in continuing to build a common destiny. The \r\nnext step occurred at the Summit of the Americas held \r\nin Puerto España in April this year, when the \r\npossibility arose of achieving the full reintegration of \r\nthe inter-American family of nations in our \r\nhemisphere. In June, the General Assembly of the \r\nOrganization of American States (OAS), meeting in the \r\ncity of San Pedro Sula, took the historic decision to \r\ndeclare resolution VI, adopted in 1962, by which the \r\nGovernment of Cuba had been excluded from the \r\ninter-American system, without effect.  \r\n The progress of the past year brought us a little \r\ncloser to the ideals of the OAS charter, based on the \r\nprinciples of solidarity and good-neighbourliness. In \r\naddition, it expressed the aspiration of our peoples to a \r\ntolerant regionalism based on progress and prosperity \r\nfor all, independence, the sovereign equality of States \r\nand respect for the law. Those principles assume \r\nuniversal scope at the United Nations and require firm \r\ncommitment to multilateralism. \r\n Some early progress has been made over the past \r\nyear in the relaxing of the embargo. We are following \r\nwith the greatest interest and welcome the decisions \r\ntaken to reduce the restrictions imposed on the travel \r\nof individuals with relatives in Cuba, to raise the caps \r\non financial remittances and to facilitate the mailing of \r\nparcels. The resumption of bilateral dialogue between \r\nthe United States and the Government of Cuba on \r\nmigration issues and the more open parameters for the \r\nparticipation of telecommunications companies in \r\nCuba are also positive.  \r\n Notwithstanding the recent progress, or perhaps \r\nprecisely because of it, the commercial and financial \r\nembargo against Cuba seems increasingly irrational \r\nand anachronistic, in addition to being harmful to the \r\ninterests of the international community. The truth is \r\nthat nothing less than an unequivocal, swift and \r\ndecisive end to the embargo will bring us back into line \r\nwith the realities of the new century in which we live. \r\nA/64/PV.27  \r\n \r\n09-57988 16 \r\n \r\n From this very rostrum, President Lula has \r\naffirmed that we must exert our political will to \r\novercome situations that militate against peace, \r\ndevelopment and democracy. An end to the embargo \r\nwould contribute decisively to that end. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency Bruno Eduardo Rodríguez \r\nParrilla, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba, to \r\nintroduce draft resolution A/64/L.4. \r\n Mr. Rodríguez Parrilla (Cuba) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): Alexis García Iribar was born in Cuba, in the \r\nprovince of Guantánamo, with congenital cardiopathy. \r\nAt the age of six, after successive deferrals and with \r\ncomplications, he had to undergo open-heart surgery \r\non 9 March 2009 because the Government of the \r\nUnited States prohibits the North American companies \r\nNuMED, AGA Medical Corporation and Boston \r\nScientific from selling Cuba the Amplatzer and \r\nembolization coil devices for paediatric catheterization \r\nthat can replace surgery. I could mention another \r\n12 cases of children between the ages of five months \r\nand 13 years, all of whom have undergone a similar \r\nprocedure in the past year and a half, two since \r\n20 January. \r\n Cuban children suffering from acute \r\nlymphoblastic leukaemia who reject the usual \r\nmedicines cannot be treated with the North American \r\nproduct Elspar, made specifically for cases of \r\nintolerance. Consequently, their life expectancy is \r\nreduced and their suffering increases. The North \r\nAmerican Government prohibits the company Merck \r\nfrom supplying it to Cuba. Cuba has been unable to \r\nobtain the genetic analyser equipment needed to study \r\nthe cause of breast, colon and prostate cancer, which is \r\nmanufactured by the North American company Applied \r\nBiosystems. Lactalis USA, a supplier of dairy \r\nproducts, was fined $20,000 by the North American \r\nGovernment. \r\n Since President Obama’s election, there has been \r\nno change in the application of the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial blockade against Cuba. It \r\nremains intact. It continues to be an absurd policy that \r\ncauses scarcities and suffering. It is a mass, flagrant \r\nand systematic violation of human rights. Under the \r\n1948 Geneva Convention, it could be classified as an \r\nact of genocide. It is ethically unacceptable. \r\n The blockade is an arrogant and ignorant act. \r\nRecently, the North American Government prevented \r\nthe New York Philharmonic Orchestra from performing \r\nin Cuba. Cuban artists cannot be paid for their \r\nperformances before the North American public. How \r\ncan artistic creation be considered a crime? Microsoft \r\nblocked Cuba’s access to Windows Live because, as \r\ncan be read after opening that tool, that is what \r\nhappens to users from countries under United States \r\nembargo. The same happens with the web pages of \r\nCisco Systems, SolidWorks and Symantec. The \r\nblockade limits Cuba’s bandwidth and connectivity. It \r\nprevents our connection to the submarine fibre-optic \r\ncables that pass near our coasts. Why does the United \r\nStates Government hinder the free flow of information \r\nand access to new technologies? \r\n However, such inhumane prohibitions, \r\ninappropriate in this age, are applied not only against \r\nCuba, but also against other countries represented here. \r\nPhilips Medical Systems failed to fulfil the contracted \r\nsupply of spare parts for medical equipment, bought at \r\na cost of $72 million and installed in Cuba and in \r\nVenezuela. Moreover, it was fined $200,000. It is a \r\nNetherlands company, against which the United States \r\nGovernment applied the blockade extraterritorially. \r\n Hitachi stated that it cannot sell Cuba an \r\nelectronic transmission microscope, essential for \r\npathological anatomy studies, while Toshiba said the \r\nsame about a gamma chamber and magnetic resonance \r\nand high-precision ultrasound equipment. They are \r\nJapanese companies against which the United States \r\nalso applies the blockade. The North American \r\nGovernment forbade the food company Sensient \r\nFlavors from exporting to Cuba, although it is a \r\nsubsidiary registered and based in Canada. \r\n Siemens, a German company, refused to sell us a \r\n125-megawatt transformer owing, it said, to its \r\nobligation to follow certain United States rules. One of \r\nits subsidiaries based in Denmark could not supply \r\nequipment for a cement factory in Cuba under the \r\nNorth American ban. The Australia \u0026 New Zealand \r\nBank Group, headquartered in Australia, was fined \r\nmillions for doing business with Cuba. Some 1,941 \r\nvessels that moored in Cuban ports between July 2008 \r\nand July 2009 were banned from entering North \r\nAmerican ports for 180 days. There are many other \r\nexamples cited in the Secretary-General’s report \r\n(A/64/97), which includes Cuba’s reply.  \r\n The United States representatives lie when they \r\nassert that the blockade is a bilateral issue. The \r\n A/64/PV.27\r\n \r\n17 09-57988 \r\n \r\nextraterritorial application of blockade laws, such as \r\nthe Helms-Burton and Torricelli Acts, against States \r\nrepresented here is a serious violation of international \r\nlaw, the United Nations Charter and freedom of trade \r\nand navigation. Recently, blockade measures have been \r\napplied against at least 56 countries. It is up to the \r\nGeneral Assembly to deal with this matter. \r\n According to recent polls of institutions of that \r\ncountry, 76 per cent of North Americans oppose the \r\nblockade. It is antidemocratic to disregard the wish for \r\nchange and to maintain the blockade. In a time of \r\nunemployment and economic crisis, United States \r\nbusinesses are banned from the Cuban market and \r\nprohibited from investing in Cuba. International \r\ncompanies face no North American competition in \r\nCuba because the United States Government forbids it. \r\n What harm could there be in North Americans \r\naccessing Cuban products? Who would be hurt by the \r\ncreation of new jobs in United States ports as a result \r\nof the development of normal trade relations between \r\nour countries? Why can North Americans not have \r\naccess to the latest Cuban medicines for cancer or \r\ndiabetes and the technologies to manufacture them, \r\nwhich are available in only Cuba? Why does the \r\ncompany Bacardi, which paid for the lobbying that led \r\nto the Helms-Burton Act, avoid competition and force \r\nNorth Americans to buy a poor imitation of Cuban rum \r\nat a higher price? Why should a Cuban cigar be \r\ninaccessible and exotic in that country? \r\n The United States President seemed stuck in the \r\npast when, on 11 September, he extended the embargo \r\nfor another year, citing the national interest of the \r\nUnited States, based on the Trade with the Enemy Act \r\nof 1917, which is applicable only to situations of war \r\nand enforced solely against Cuba. No serious person \r\ncould maintain that Cuba is a threat to the national \r\nsecurity of the only super-Power.  \r\n Our strength is that of law, truth and reason. The \r\ninclusion of Cuba on the spurious list of alleged State \r\nsponsors of terrorism — the reason given for some of \r\nthe blockade measures — should cease. Our five \r\nanti-terrorist heroes, who have been unjustly \r\nimprisoned in that country, should be freed now. \r\n On 11 September 2001, Cuba opened its skies \r\nand airports so that any American plane could have \r\nsomewhere to land. It offered plasma and health-care \r\nworkers. Later on, it offered antibiotics and equipment \r\nto combat the anthrax threat and generously offered to \r\nsend doctors when Hurricane Katrina battered New \r\nOrleans. \r\n Cuba is a hospitable nation that invites American \r\ncitizens to visit, American intellectuals, scholars and \r\nscientists to engage in cooperation and fruitful debate, \r\nAmerican artists to build bridges, and American \r\ncompanies to trade and invest.  \r\n A few days ago, we all applauded President \r\nObama when he said from this rostrum, “international \r\nlaw is not an empty promise” and “no nation … should \r\ntry to dominate another nation” (A/64/PV.3). \r\n The international community cannot and will not \r\naccept that those who govern in Washington, D.C., \r\nbelieve they have the authority to implement coercive \r\neconomic measures and extraterritorial laws against \r\nsovereign States. President Obama has a historical \r\nopportunity to lead a change of policy towards Cuba \r\nand lift the blockade. He is even vested with executive \r\npowers that would allow him, right now and all by \r\nhimself, to substantially modify the implementation of \r\nthe blockade measures by granting general licences, \r\ndispensations or waivers, humanitarian exceptions or \r\nmeasures taken for reasons of national interest, without \r\neven modifying the laws that enforce such \r\nprohibitions. \r\n President Obama righteously defied the egoism \r\nand callous nature of the conservative right when he \r\ntold Congress, \r\n “One man from Illinois lost his coverage in the \r\nmiddle of chemotherapy … and he died because \r\nof it. Another woman from Texas was about to get \r\na double mastectomy when her insurance \r\ncompany cancelled her policy”.  \r\n Anyone who could be troubled by this could not, \r\nwithout disregarding the most basic ethical standards, \r\nprevent Cuban children suffering from cancer or a \r\nheart condition from receiving medicine and medical \r\nequipment. To paraphrase Senator Kennedy when he \r\nreferred to health reform, the blockade against Cuba is \r\nalso a moral issue that puts to the test the character of \r\nthe United States of America. \r\n It is true that Cuba purchases significant \r\nquantities of agricultural products from the United \r\nStates. However, the United States representatives lie \r\nwhen they say that the United States is Cuba’s trading \r\npartner but fail to mention that this trade does not \r\nconform to the standards established by the \r\nA/64/PV.27  \r\n \r\n09-57988 18 \r\n \r\ninternational trade system. Cuba’s payments are to be \r\nmade in cash and in advance, without access to private \r\ncredit. Cuban vessels are not allowed to transport \r\ncargo. Cuba is submitted to onerous and discriminatory \r\nprocedures and endures endless manoeuvres aimed at \r\nconfiscating shipments. We cannot call “trade” those \r\noperations that lack even the minimum reciprocity that \r\nwould allow Cuba to export its products to the United \r\nStates. A country imposing a blockade on another \r\ncannot be its trading partner. \r\n The representatives of the United States \r\nGovernment lie shamelessly when they assert that the \r\nUnited States is the main donor of humanitarian \r\nassistance to Cuba. The data they use are false. They \r\nconflate, through fictitious and intentionally \r\nmisleading figures, the value of alleged licences for \r\ntransactions that never took place and the assistance \r\nthat Cuban immigrants residing in the United States \r\nsend, through no effort but their own, to their relatives. \r\nSuccessive United States administrations have persecuted \r\nand harassed non-governmental organizations that send \r\nhumanitarian assistance to Cuba, and as a result, half \r\nof those organizations have stopped doing so. \r\n A year ago, when Cuba was devastated by three \r\nhurricanes, which caused losses equivalent to 20 per \r\ncent of our gross domestic product, the Bush \r\nadministration did not even respond to our request that \r\nAmerican companies be allowed to sell to us, on an \r\nexceptional basis, construction material and tarpaulins \r\nto replace damaged roofs, and to grant us private \r\ncredit. \r\n At several meetings, United States representatives \r\nhave referred to the steps that their Government has \r\ntaken to dismantle the most brutal restrictions imposed \r\nby George W. Bush on travel by Cuban émigrés and on \r\nremittances to their relatives, as well as to resume \r\nbilateral talks on migration issues and re-establish \r\ndirect postal services. \r\n These actions are positive, but they are extremely \r\nlimited and insufficient. The truth is that we have not \r\neven returned to a situation comparable to that which \r\nprevailed until the early days of 2004, when the United \r\nStates allowed a certain level of academic, cultural, \r\nscientific and sporting exchange with Cuban \r\ncounterparts. Such exchanges continue to be banned \r\ntoday. \r\n Some vague proposals relating to \r\ntelecommunications will simply be impracticable so \r\nlong as other restrictions that remain in force are not \r\neliminated, and so long as the practice of stealing \r\nCuban funds resulting from such transactions, which \r\nremain frozen in American banks on the basis of \r\ndecisions adopted by venal judges in violation of their \r\nown laws, is not discontinued. \r\n Since the right of United States residents of \r\nCuban origin to travel to the island has been \r\nre-established, the absurdity of preventing American \r\ncitizens from travelling to Cuba — the only place in \r\nthe world forbidden to them — has been thrown into \r\nstarker relief. American citizens, who pay taxes, are \r\nnot free to travel to Cuba, despite the fact that the \r\nConstitution of that country allegedly guarantees that \r\nright. American citizens are not allowed to receive \r\nfirst-hand information about Cuba. \r\n United States representatives have also referred \r\nin several meetings to a supposedly new spirit in their \r\nrelations with our country. Cuba’s response has been \r\nfully consistent with its historical readiness to talk \r\ndirectly with the United States. Just as Commander-in-\r\nChief Fidel Castro Ruz did in the past, President Raúl \r\nCastro Ruz has reiterated his willingness to establish \r\ndialogue on all issues and to negotiate all bilateral \r\nproblems on the basis of respect and sovereign \r\nequality, without prejudice to our national \r\nindependence and self-determination. We have clearly \r\nstated that we will not negotiate our internal affairs or \r\nour constitutional order. We await a response from the \r\nUnited States Government about the proposed agenda \r\nsubmitted by Cuba this past July to launch a bilateral \r\ndialogue, which I publicly announced in this Hall on \r\n28 September 2006. \r\n The economic blockade has not succeeded and \r\nwill not succeed in its purpose of crushing the patriotic \r\nresolve of the Cuban people. However, it generates \r\nshortages, restricts our development potential and \r\nseriously hurts our economy. It is, without doubt, the \r\nfundamental obstacle that hinders the economic \r\ndevelopment of our country. Its cost is very difficult to \r\nestimate. A rigorous and conservative record of the \r\neconomic damage amounts to hundreds of billions of \r\ndollars, based on the current and decreasing value of \r\nthat currency. \r\n Representatives of the United States have said \r\nthat our shortages result from the failure of our system. \r\nBut they lie, perhaps rather from ignorance than bad \r\nfaith. Thanks to our system, we have been able to resist \r\n A/64/PV.27\r\n \r\n19 09-57988 \r\n \r\nfor 50 years and we have developed despite the \r\nblockade. If the United States representatives are \r\nconvinced that our system does not work, why do they \r\nneed the blockade? \r\n In conditions of true economic warfare and \r\nvicious manipulation of the media, and subject to the \r\neffects of climate change and the global economic \r\ncrisis, Cuba is engaged in deeply human and fraternal, \r\nsocial and cultural work. Our people are determined to \r\nmove ahead, in sovereignty, in order to solve our \r\nproblems and perfect our political, economic and social \r\nsystem within socialism. We Cubans have every right \r\nto do so, without blockades or foreign pressure, \r\nwithout the millions in funds with which the United \r\nStates Government finances subversion and without \r\nforeign interference in the decisions that only we \r\nCubans are entitled to make. \r\n That is the purpose of the draft resolution that we \r\nintend to adopt and that I am honoured to present. \r\nSupporting this draft resolution would be an act against \r\naggression and the use of force. It would be an act in \r\nfavour of peace, justice and hope. It would be an act of \r\njustice towards the heroic people of Cuba who are \r\ntoday paying tribute to the memory of Camilo \r\nCienfuegos, a young and cheerful Commander from the \r\nSierra Maestra Mountains, from whom we learned that \r\nloyalty to our sacred achievements and our profound \r\nconvictions is the only way to victory. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): We have heard \r\nthe last speaker in the debate on this agenda item. \r\n We shall now proceed to consider draft resolution \r\nA/64/L.4. \r\n Before giving the floor to speakers in explanation \r\nof vote before the vote, may I remind delegations that \r\nexplanations of vote before the vote are limited to 10 \r\nminutes and should be made by delegations from their \r\nseats. However, in view of the large number of \r\nspeakers, I would ask delegations to limit their \r\nexplanations of vote to no more than a few minutes so \r\nthat we can finish our work on this item in a timely \r\nmanner.  \r\n I now give the floor to those representatives who \r\nwish to speak in explanation of vote before the voting. \r\n Ms. Rice (United States of America): Here we go \r\nagain. I suppose old habits die hard. The hostile \r\nlanguage we have just heard from the Foreign Minister \r\nof Cuba seems straight out of the Cold War era and is \r\nnot conducive to constructive progress. We will not \r\nrespond in kind to the painfully familiar rhetoric that \r\nwe have heard in years past. Rather, I am here to \r\nacknowledge that there is a new chapter to this old \r\nstory.  \r\n In recent months, since the start of the Obama \r\nadministration, the United States has undertaken \r\nseveral steps to reach out to the Cuban people in \r\nsupport of their desire to freely determine their \r\ncountry’s future. We have promoted family visits and \r\nthe free flow of information to and from the Cuban \r\npeople. The United States has lifted restrictions on \r\nfamily visits and remittances and expanded the amount \r\nof humanitarian items that the American people can \r\ndonate to individuals in Cuba. The United States has \r\nenhanced the ability of United States telecommunications \r\ncompanies to pursue agreements to provide service to \r\nCuba and has made it easier for United States \r\nagricultural producers to pursue contracts with Cuban \r\nbuyers. These are important steps and we hope they \r\ncan be the starting point for further changes in the \r\nrelationship. \r\n It is equally important to note that the United \r\nStates has demonstrated that we are prepared to engage \r\nthe Government of Cuba on issues that affect the \r\nsecurity and well-being of both our peoples. \r\nSpecifically, we have resumed bilateral discussions on \r\nmigration, we have initiated talks to re-establish direct \r\nmail service between the United States and Cuba and \r\nwe stand by to provide assistance should Cuba be \r\nravaged again by hurricanes as it was in 2008. \r\n We believe that any resolution commenting on \r\nthe relationship between Cuba and the United States of \r\nAmerica should reflect those constructive \r\ndevelopments. Sadly, the draft resolution under \r\ndiscussion fails in that regard and, regrettably, the \r\nGovernment of Cuba has not yet reciprocated those \r\nimportant steps taken by my Government.  \r\n At the same time, we must point out that the \r\nUnited States of America, like all Member States, has \r\nthe sovereign right to conduct its economic relationship \r\nwith another country as it sees fit. The United States \r\neconomic relationship with Cuba is a bilateral issue \r\nand part of a broader set of relations. The steps the \r\nUnited States has taken to improve communications \r\nand exchanges with the Cuban people are undertaken \r\nwith a continuing firm commitment to encouraging the \r\nCuban Government to respect basic norms embodied in \r\nA/64/PV.27  \r\n \r\n09-57988 20 \r\n \r\nthe Inter-American Democratic Charter and the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. \r\n As we discuss our differences on that subject, we \r\nmust remember one important commonality. The \r\nUnited States, like most Member States, is firmly \r\ncommitted to supporting the desire of the Cuban people \r\nto determine freely their country’s future. Respect for \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms are part of this \r\nOrganization’s core values. We should not lose sight of \r\nthat in a stale debate bogged down in rhetorical \r\narguments of the past. That kind of debate does nothing \r\nto help the people of Cuba. \r\n I must address two significant distortions in the \r\nCuban position. First, my delegation regrets that the \r\ndelegation of Cuba continues inappropriately and \r\nincorrectly to label United States trade restrictions on \r\nCuba as an act of genocide. Such an egregious misuse \r\nof the term genocide diminishes the real suffering of \r\nvictims of genocide elsewhere in the world. \r\n Secondly, it is erroneous to charge that United \r\nStates sanctions are the cause of deprivation among the \r\nCuban people. The United States maintains no \r\nrestriction on humanitarian aid to Cuba. In fact, the \r\nUnited States is a major source of humanitarian \r\nassistance to the Cuban people and the largest provider \r\nof food to Cuba. In 2008, the United States exported \r\nagricultural products, medical devices, medicine, wood \r\nand humanitarian items to Cuba. In agricultural \r\nproducts alone, the United States sold $700.1 million \r\nof goods to Cuba. Once again, in 2008, the United \r\nStates was Cuba’s fifth largest trading partner.  \r\n As we have sought to reach out to the Cuban \r\npeople, we have called upon the Cuban Government to \r\ntake steps to respond to the desire of its citizens to \r\nenjoy political, social, and economic freedoms. There \r\nare many things the Government of Cuba could do to \r\nsignal its willingness to engage constructively with its \r\nown people and with the United States. Positive \r\nmeasures could include liberating the hundreds of \r\nprisoners of conscience in Cuban jails, ratifying the \r\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, \r\nreducing the excessive charges on remittances flowing \r\ninto the country, demonstrating greater respect for \r\nfreedom of speech, ending the practice of arresting \r\npolitical opponents on vague and arbitrary charges \r\nsuch as “social dangerousness” and permitting the visit \r\nof United Nations rapporteurs on human rights and \r\ntorture. As other delegations consider this draft \r\nresolution, we do hope they will not lose sight of the \r\nundeniable fact that the Cuban Government’s airtight \r\nrestrictions on internationally recognized social, \r\npolitical and economic freedoms are the main source of \r\ndeprivation and the primary obstacle to development in \r\nCuba.  \r\n Because it does not reflect current realities, my \r\ndelegation will vote against this draft resolution. At the \r\nsame time, the United States will continue to work to \r\nexpand opportunities for the people of Cuba to \r\nempower themselves through access to information and \r\nresources. We will continue to engage the Government \r\nof Cuba on issues of mutual concern and national \r\nsecurity. We await a constructive Cuban response to \r\nour initiatives. In the meantime it is high time for this \r\nbody to move beyond the rhetorical posturing of the \r\npast, to recognize the situation in Cuba for what it is \r\ntoday and to encourage progress towards genuine \r\nchange. \r\n Mr. Balé (Congo) (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof my delegation I would like to thank you, Sir, for \r\norganizing this debate on the need to end the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States of America against Cuba. \r\n My delegation, which has consistently voted in \r\nfavour of the resolution on the Cuban embargo, wishes \r\nto make the following observations on this issue, on \r\nwhich we could have spared ourselves a vote. First, the \r\nembargo imposed on Cuba, which causes suffering to \r\nthe Cuban population, as well as considerable \r\neconomic damages to the nation, does not constitute, in \r\nthe opinion of my delegation, an acceptable means of \r\nresolving political differences among States. Secondly, \r\nthis embargo, which is a unilateral measure, not only is \r\na flagrant violation of the provisions of the United \r\nNations Charter, the principles of international law and \r\nresolutions adopted year after year by this Assembly, \r\nbut also flouts the principles of freedom of commerce \r\nand international navigation. \r\n Congo, which keenly wishes to see the lifting of \r\nthis measure, has no intention of associating itself with \r\nit in any way whatsoever. That is why it has refrained \r\nfrom passing or putting into practice any law of the \r\nkind referred to in the draft resolution. In that sprit, the \r\nCongolese delegation will cast a vote in favour of the \r\ndraft before us.  \r\n I could not conclude my statement without taking \r\nnote of the encouraging signs seen recently that give us \r\n A/64/PV.27\r\n \r\n21 09-57988 \r\n \r\nreasons to hope that a settlement of this question is \r\npossible through constructive dialogue. Congo \r\nencourages any development to that end and expresses \r\na hope that the parties to this conflict may draw on a \r\nspirit of dialogue in order to put an end to this unjust, \r\nanachronistic measure that is manifestly damaging to \r\npeace and security in the region. \r\n Ms. Rubiales de Chamorro (Nicaragua) (spoke \r\nin Spanish): Nicaragua would like to explain the \r\nelements it believes need to be taken into account for \r\nthis vote and, specifically, explain why we will vote in \r\nfavour of draft resolution A/64/L.4.  \r\n Who is Cuba? Cuba is a sister, the inspirational \r\nsource of our own struggles, the daughter both of the \r\nAmerican continent and the African continent, an \r\nexample of solidarity and generosity. Cuba, all of your \r\nbrothers and sisters on this continent are with you. All \r\nour peoples and Governments recognize you and \r\nadmire you — all except one. And the Government that \r\ndoes not recognize you is acting against the will of its \r\nown people. Moreover, that Government not only does \r\nnot recognize you but also abuses you, and abuses you \r\nagainst the will of the international community. \r\n The economic, commercial and financial \r\nblockade imposed by the United States against Cuba \r\nfor more than 50 years is the highest expression of a \r\ncruel and inhumane policy that is lacking in legality \r\nand legitimacy and is deliberately designed to provoke \r\nhunger, disease and desperation in the Cuban \r\npopulation. This blockade has to stop now. It is a \r\nflagrant violation of human rights.  \r\n The United States Government cannot continue to \r\nignore the resolutions of this Assembly. It must \r\nimmediately obey them and join in what has been the \r\nwill of the international community, which since 1992 \r\nhas expressed itself in a growing condemnation of the \r\nMember States of this Organization, a condemnation \r\nand rejection that last year reached a total of 185 \r\nStates, a figure that we have no doubt will continue to \r\ngrow. \r\n With every passing day the policies of the United \r\nStates will isolate it more and more, until it finds itself \r\nutterly alone, because the call for the elimination of its \r\nblockade against Cuba and for an end to its policy of \r\naggression against a small and worthy country is \r\nstronger and more determined than ever. Once more, \r\nNicaragua expresses its fundamental rejection of all \r\ncoercive, unilateral, extraterritorial measures that are \r\ncontrary to international law and the accepted norms of \r\nfree trade, because such measures represent a serious \r\nthreat to multilateralism. We also condemn the use of \r\nunilateral coercive measures, such as illegal sanctions \r\nagainst developing countries, for the purpose of \r\nthwarting those countries’ exercise of their right to \r\ndetermine their own political, economic and social \r\nsystem. \r\n The cold war has been left behind. Dialogue and \r\nnegotiation should replace blockades, aggression and \r\nhostility. It is now time that the United States set aside \r\nits imperialist policy and resolve its differences with \r\nCuba and other States in a civilized manner, through \r\ndialogue and negotiation. In the specific case of Cuba, \r\nsuch dialogue should take place without preconditions \r\nand under terms of full equality, as our sister country \r\nhas requested. \r\n Why does the United States continue this \r\ncriminal policy when it knows very well that the \r\npeople and Government of Cuba will never give in? \r\nCuba is a giant in dignity and resistance in the face of a \r\npowerful empire and an example for all our peoples. \r\nCuba, despite the blockade, shares its political, \r\neconomic and social accomplishments with all of us. \r\nCuba is life and it gives life to our peoples. While \r\nothers prescribe destabilization, hostility, aggression \r\nand death to us, since they only know to respond to \r\nchallenges with military force and ever more bases in \r\nour region, Cuba shares with us education, health, \r\nhousing, scientific and technological knowledge, \r\nsports, friendship and its values. In sum, it shares all \r\nthe necessary components of complementary solidarity \r\nto assist in the development of our peoples and to build \r\na better world.  \r\n The people and Government of Cuba do not \r\nmerely hand out their leftovers; they share what they \r\nhave. It is because of this example that the United \r\nStates has persisted with its aggressive policy against \r\nCuba for 50 years. We urge the United States instead to \r\nfollow Cuba’s example and to focus its energies and \r\nresources on cooperation based on solidarity and \r\nimpartiality in favour of the development of our region \r\nand of the peoples of the world. \r\n Nicaragua is living proof of the benefits of the \r\ninitiatives and solidarity of this generous people and \r\nGovernment. As our President and Commander Daniel \r\nOrtega Saavedra says, in this new history, which \r\nincludes new forms of thinking and living better, you, \r\nA/64/PV.27  \r\n \r\n09-57988 22 \r\n \r\nbrothers and sisters in Cuba, are a permanent source of \r\ninspiration for the new victories of our nations. \r\n We would like to take this opportunity to restate \r\nour profound gratitude to the thousands of Cuban \r\ndoctors, teachers, construction workers, technicians \r\nand specialists who have devoted all their efforts and \r\nknowledge in favour of the development of my \r\ncountry. Nicaragua, in unfailing solidarity, reiterates its \r\nunconditional support for the heroic people and \r\nGovernment of Cuba in their enormous struggle in the \r\nface of the constant aggressions of the empire, as well \r\nas its support for the ending of the blockade, the return \r\nof Cuba’s legitimate territory in Guantánamo and the \r\nliberation of the five Cuban heroes. We reiterate our \r\ndefence of Cuba’s achievements, sovereignty, self-\r\ndetermination and socialist homeland. We will always \r\ndefend the right of the Cuban Revolution to exist and \r\nto continue to illuminate us with its light and its \r\nwisdom. \r\n For the justice of the Cuban cause, we will vote \r\nin favour of the draft resolution. And we hope there \r\nwill be a genuine change in the policy of the United \r\nStates towards Cuba — that is to say, that it will bring \r\nthe blockade to an end. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): We have heard \r\nthe last speaker in explanation of vote before the vote. \r\nThe General Assembly shall now proceed to take a \r\ndecision on draft resolution A/64/L.4. A recorded vote \r\nhas been requested. \r\n A recorded vote was taken. \r\nIn favour: \r\n Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Andorra, Angola, \r\nAntigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Armenia, \r\nAustralia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Bahrain, \r\nBangladesh, Barbados, Belarus, Belgium, Belize, \r\nBenin, Bhutan, Bolivia (Plurinational State of), \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Brazil, \r\nBrunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, \r\nBurundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Canada, Cape \r\nVerde, Central African Republic, Chad, Chile, \r\nChina, Colombia, Comoros, Congo, Costa Rica, \r\nCôte d’Ivoire, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus, Czech \r\nRepublic, Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea, Democratic Republic of the Congo, \r\nDenmark, Djibouti, Dominica, Dominican \r\nRepublic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, \r\nEquatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Estonia, Ethiopia, \r\nFiji, Finland, France, Gabon, Gambia, Georgia, \r\nGermany, Ghana, Greece, Grenada, Guatemala, \r\nGuinea, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, \r\nHungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic \r\nRepublic of), Iraq, Ireland, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, \r\nJordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kiribati, Kuwait, \r\nKyrgyzstan, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, \r\nLatvia, Lebanon, Lesotho, Liberia, Libyan Arab \r\nJamahiriya, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, \r\nMadagascar, Malawi, Malaysia, Maldives, Mali, \r\nMalta, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mexico, Monaco, \r\nMongolia, Montenegro, Morocco, Mozambique, \r\nMyanmar, Namibia, Nauru, Nepal, Netherlands, \r\nNew Zealand, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, \r\nNorway, Oman, Pakistan, Panama, Papua New \r\nGuinea, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland, \r\nPortugal, Qatar, Republic of Korea, Republic of \r\nMoldova, Romania, Russian Federation, Rwanda, \r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent \r\nand the Grenadines, Samoa, San Marino, Sao \r\nTome and Principe, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, \r\nSerbia, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Singapore, \r\nSlovakia, Slovenia, Solomon Islands, Somalia, \r\nSouth Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Suriname, \r\nSwaziland, Sweden, Switzerland, Syrian Arab \r\nRepublic, Tajikistan, Thailand, the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Timor-Leste, \r\nTogo, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, \r\nTurkey, Turkmenistan, Tuvalu, Uganda, Ukraine, \r\nUnited Arab Emirates, United Kingdom of Great \r\nBritain and Northern Ireland, United Republic of \r\nTanzania, Uruguay, Uzbekistan, Vanuatu, \r\nVenezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), Viet Nam, \r\nYemen, Zambia, Zimbabwe \r\nAgainst: \r\n Israel, Palau, United States of America \r\nAbstaining: \r\n Marshall Islands, Micronesia (Federated \r\nStates of) \r\n Draft resolution A/64/L.4 was adopted by 187 \r\nvotes to 3, with 2 abstentions (resolution 64/6). \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): We shall now \r\nhear speakers in explanation of vote after the vote. I \r\nhope that speakers will be very brief so that we may \r\nfinish our work on this item on time. \r\n Mr. Lidén (Sweden): I have the honour to deliver \r\nthis explanation of vote on behalf of the European \r\nUnion. Turkey, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic \r\nof Macedonia, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, \r\n A/64/PV.27\r\n \r\n23 09-57988 \r\n \r\nMontenegro, Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova \r\nalign themselves with this statement. \r\n The European Union believes that the United \r\nStates trade policy towards Cuba is fundamentally a \r\nbilateral issue. However, American legislation such as \r\nthe Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 and the Helms-\r\nBurton Act of 1996 has extended the effects of the \r\nUnited States embargo to third-party countries. As a \r\nmatter of principle, the European Union has firmly and \r\ncontinuously opposed such extraterritorial measures. \r\n We welcome the recent decision by the United \r\nStates Government to lift restrictions on remittances \r\nand family travel to Cuba, but we cannot accept that \r\nunilaterally imposed measures impede our economic \r\nand commercial relations with Cuba. To address this \r\nproblem, the European Union’s Council of Ministers \r\nadopted, in November 1996, a regulation and a joint \r\naction to protect the interests of natural or legal \r\npersons residing in Europe against the consequences of \r\nthese Acts. Furthermore, at the May 1998 European \r\nUnion-United States Summit in London, a package was \r\nagreed that also sought to alleviate the problems with \r\nextraterritorial legislation. It covered waivers to titles \r\nIII and IV of the Helms-Burton Act, a commitment by \r\nthe United States Government to resist future \r\nextraterritorial legislation of that kind, and an \r\nunderstanding regarding disciplines for the \r\nstrengthening of investment protection. The European \r\nUnion reiterates its call on the United States to \r\nimplement this agreement. \r\n The European Union’s policy towards Cuba is \r\nclear and was set out in a Common Position in 1996. \r\nThe objective of the European Union in its relations \r\nwith Cuba is to encourage a peaceful process of \r\ntransition, led by the Cuban people, to a pluralist \r\ndemocracy and respect for human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms, as well as a sustainable \r\neconomic recovery and an improvement in the living \r\nstandards of the Cuban people. \r\n Reaffirming the validity of this Common \r\nPosition, the European Union in June 2008 lifted the \r\npolitical measures imposed on Cuba in 2003. The \r\ndialogue with the authorities in Havana was resumed \r\nwithout preconditions and on the basis of reciprocity \r\nand non-discrimination. \r\n Ministerial sessions were held with the Cuban \r\nGovernment in Paris in October 2008 and in Brussels \r\nin May 2009. The dialogue addressed issues of \r\ncommon interest, including human rights, an area in \r\nwhich the European Union expects concrete actions \r\nfrom Havana. Additionally, the European Union \r\nintends to continue its dialogue with the democratic \r\nopposition and civil society on Cuba. \r\n While it has signed the United Nations \r\nInternational Covenants on Civil and Political Rights \r\nand Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Cuba has \r\nnot yet ratified them. Havana has undertaken to invite \r\nthe United Nations Special Rapporteur on the right to \r\nfood and has mentioned the possibility of visits from \r\nother rapporteurs. \r\n The Cuban Government continues to deny its \r\ncitizens internationally recognized civil, political and \r\neconomic rights and freedoms. The European Union \r\nremains seriously concerned at the continuation of \r\nhuman rights violations in Cuba despite a decrease in \r\nthe number of political prisoners. The European Union \r\nonce again urges the Cuban Government to \r\nunconditionally release all political prisoners and, in \r\nparticular, expresses utmost concern at the \r\ndeteriorating health of several of them and of members \r\nof the group of 75 who were detained in March 2003. \r\nThe European Union also reiterates its call on the \r\nCuban Government to grant freedom of expression and \r\nfree access to information. \r\n These restrictions on rights and freedoms \r\nundermine the Cuban achievements in health care and \r\neducation. Similarly, domestic Cuban economic policy \r\nseriously hampers the country’s own economic \r\ndevelopment. The economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo imposed by the United States contributes to \r\nthese problems, negatively affecting the living \r\nstandards of the Cuban people. \r\n The European Union clearly believes, therefore, \r\nthat the lifting of the United States embargo would \r\nopen up the Cuban economy, to the benefit of the \r\nCuban people. We again express our rejection of all \r\nunilateral measures directed against Cuba that are \r\ncontrary to commonly accepted rules of international \r\ntrade. With regard to Cuba, the European Union urges \r\nthe Cuban authorities to bring about real improvements \r\nin all areas mentioned. \r\n For all those reasons, and in spite of serious \r\ncriticism of Cuba’s human rights record, the European \r\nUnion voted unanimously in favour of resolution 64/6. \r\nA/64/PV.27  \r\n \r\n09-57988 24 \r\n \r\n Mr. Cancela (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nhave the honour to speak on behalf of the States \r\nmembers of the Common Market of the South \r\n(MERCOSUR) and its associated States: Argentina, the \r\nPlurinational State of Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, \r\nEcuador, Paraguay, Peru, the Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela and my country, Uruguay. \r\n As in previous years, the States members of \r\nMERCOSUR and its associated States voted in favour \r\nof the resolution submitted by the delegation of Cuba, \r\nbecause we understand that the embargo against that \r\ncountry contradicts the principles of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and contravenes rules of international \r\nlaw, in particular the norms regulating international \r\ntrade that are binding on members of the World Trade \r\nOrganization. \r\n The position of MERCOSUR and its associated \r\nStates falls within the broader framework of the \r\ndefence of multilateralism, non-intervention and the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes, which are fundamental \r\nprinciples of the diplomacy of our continent.  \r\n This embargo has been condemned before here at \r\nthe United Nations and in other international forums \r\nand bodies, including the Organization of American \r\nStates, the Latin American and Caribbean Economic \r\nSystem, and the Ibero-American and Rio Group \r\nsummits. \r\n The States members of MERCOSUR and its \r\nassociated States reject unilateral and extraterritorial \r\nmeasures out of principle. In that connection, we \r\ncondemn the implementation of coercive unilateral \r\nmeasures contrary to free trade, which cause \r\nirreparable harm to the well-being of peoples and \r\nobstruct regional integration processes. \r\n By voting in favour of resolution 64/6, \r\nMERCOSUR and its associated States have reaffirmed \r\ntheir commitment to multilateralism as a legitimate \r\ninstrument for the peaceful settlement of disputes \r\nbetween States and an effective tool in promoting \r\ninternational cooperation, human rights, security and \r\nunderstanding among peoples. \r\n Mrs. Phommachanh (Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic) (spoke in French): My delegation subscribes \r\nto the statements made by the representative of the \r\nSudan on behalf of the Group of 77 and China and by \r\nthe representative of Egypt on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement.  \r\n The Lao People’s Democratic Republic wishes to \r\nexpress once again its opposition to the continuation of \r\nthe economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nunilaterally imposed by the United States of America \r\nagainst Cuba for half a century. We believe that the \r\nongoing imposition of that economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo is a violation of the principles of the \r\nsovereign equality of States, non-intervention and \r\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of another State, \r\nand that it constitutes an attack on the sovereignty of \r\nthe Cuban people and their right to development. The \r\nextraterritorial application of legislation by one State \r\naimed at imposing unilateral sanctions against another \r\nruns counter to the fundamental principles of \r\ninternational law and the Charter of the United \r\nNations.  \r\n Because of its harmful effects on the livelihoods \r\nof the Cuban people, as well as its exterritorial nature, \r\nthe embargo imposed on Cuba by the United States of \r\nAmerica has, since 1992, been systematically \r\ncondemned by the international community in \r\n17 identical resolutions, adopted by an overwhelming \r\nmajority every year by the General Assembly. \r\nHowever, despite the requests of the General Assembly \r\nand many other intergovernmental organs and forums, \r\nthe embargo remains in place. Its perpetuation will \r\nonly create further tension in the bilateral relations \r\nbetween the United States and Cuba and lead to new \r\nsuffering and difficulties for the people of Cuba, in \r\nparticular its most vulnerable citizens, such as women \r\nand children. \r\n I should like to conclude by reaffirming our \r\ntireless support for and solidarity with the Cuban \r\npeople. We join other Member States in insistently \r\nrequesting the United States of America to put an end \r\nto the economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nimposed on Cuba. It is in that spirit that the Lao \r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic voted in favour of \r\nresolution 64/6. \r\n Mr. Loayza Barea (Plurinational State of \r\nBolivia) (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of Bolivia, I \r\nshould like to endorse the statements made by the \r\nrepresentative of Egypt on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement, by the representative of the Sudan on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China, and by the \r\nrepresentative of Uruguay on behalf of the Common \r\nMarket of the South. I also wish to welcome Minister \r\nRodríguez Parilla. \r\n A/64/PV.27\r\n \r\n25 09-57988 \r\n \r\n Resolution 64/6, just adopted by the General \r\nAssembly — the eighteenth such resolution to have \r\nbeen consecutively adopted — unequivocally reflects \r\nthe international community’s explicit rejection of the \r\nembargo imposed by the United States of America and, \r\nabove all, fully reaffirms the purposes and principles of \r\nthe Charter, such as sovereign equality, \r\nnon-intervention and, especially, non-interference in \r\nStates’ internal affairs.  \r\n Once again, it is clear that there is a need to put \r\nan end to the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo, which results from a persistent unilateral \r\nattitude that has no place in the twenty-first century. It \r\nlacks all legitimacy, and its adverse consequences \r\ncontinue to affect the Cuban people, who, with great \r\ndignity, are growing much stronger in opposing an \r\nobsolete measure that has proved to be a resounding \r\nfailure year after year.  \r\n The report of the Secretary-General (A/64/97) \r\nsets out the actual and irrefutable facts of this reality. It \r\ncites examples of the economic and social effects of \r\nthis aggressive embargo, whose extraterritoriality — \r\nwhich blatantly subverts international norms — is \r\nsupported in laws such as the Helms-Burton Act, which \r\nimposes sanctions on companies maintaining relations \r\nwith Cuba. That concept, which is absolutely null and \r\nvoid, also entails a flagrant violation of human rights, \r\nas well as a breach of the fundamental principles of \r\nrelations among sovereign States because it seeks to \r\ncontrol their political life. \r\n That is why one cannot defend the assumption by \r\none State of the extraterritorial right to implement a \r\nlegal norm against another without its consent. The 18 \r\nresolutions adopted by the General Assembly rejecting \r\nthe blockade eliminate any possible doubt about that \r\nfact, which has once again been resoundingly \r\nreaffirmed by the international community today. \r\n The Plurinational State of Bolivia believes that \r\nthe time has come to reverse this situation and that, in \r\nthe twenty-first century, we need a change in attitude \r\nand behaviour that are contrary to and incompatible \r\nwith the principles of the United Nations Charter. In \r\nthat regard, we need to give sway to reason and \r\ndialogue based on full respect for the economic and \r\npolitical model that works best for the interests of the \r\nCuban people, in accordance with their identity and \r\nunique characteristics. They should not have to bend to \r\nthe external pressure or irregular policies that are \r\nimplemented against Cuba. \r\n Why persist with such mistaken policies? If we \r\nconsider the regional context, the argument against \r\nsuch conduct is powerful. The beginning of a new era \r\nof commitment, interest and mutual respect invoked by \r\nPresident Barack Obama is in line with the Nobel \r\nPeace Prize that he was awarded. Why not, in the name \r\nof peace, unconditionally revoke the blockade so that \r\nwe can overcome once and for all a vast humanitarian \r\ncrisis that contravenes international law? Why continue \r\nto buck a trend recognized in numerous regional, \r\nsubregional and global forums, which seek cooperation \r\ntowards the optimal mutual benefit among peoples \r\nthrough coordination, not subordination? For the \r\nPlurinational State of Bolivia, that herald of change has \r\nbeen ratified today. Cuba is forging onward. That is \r\nwhy we voted in favour of resolution 64/6. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I would like to \r\nremind speakers of time constraints and ask them to be \r\nbrief in their statements.  \r\n Mr. Christian (Ghana): Ghana aligns itself with \r\nthe statements delivered by the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of the Sudan on behalf of the Group of \r\n77 and China and by the Permanent Representative of \r\nEgypt on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement.  \r\n The economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nimposed by the United States on Cuba nearly 50 years \r\nago remains in place and has had negative \r\nrepercussions on the people of Cuba. That situation is \r\nnow exacerbated by the global financial, energy and \r\nfood crises. Despite the fact that the General Assembly \r\ndemanded an end to that embargo and extraterritorial \r\ndomination, the unilateral measures imposed 17 years \r\nago are still being implemented.  \r\n Ghana, in fulfilment of its commitment to the \r\npurposes and principles enshrined in the United \r\nNations Charter and international law, has steadfastly \r\nrefrained from promulgating and applying those laws \r\nwhose extraterritorial effects adversely affect the \r\nsovereignty of States, the legitimate interests of entities \r\nor persons under their jurisdiction, and the freedom of \r\ntrade and navigation. \r\n We welcome the decision of the current United \r\nStates Administration to reduce restrictions on travel to \r\nCuba and remittances by Cuban-Americans. It is our \r\nconsidered view that such measures, constructive \r\nA/64/PV.27  \r\n \r\n09-57988 26 \r\n \r\nengagement and peaceful negotiations will eventually \r\npromote cooperation and good-neighbourliness \r\nbetween the United States and Cuba. We commend the \r\nCuban people for their resilience and sense of unity \r\nand purpose under difficult economic and social \r\nconditions.  \r\n Mrs. Beck (Solomon Islands): At the outset, my \r\ndelegation acknowledges the presence of the Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Cuba. We take the floor to speak \r\nin explanation of vote on resolution 64/6, just adopted \r\nto end the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo against Cuba. \r\n The reason is simple: We all live in an \r\ninterrelated and interdependent global system. We need \r\neach other — big countries and small, rich and poor — \r\nto tackle our global problems. Against this backdrop, \r\nmy delegation is saddened to see the remnants of the \r\ncold war continuing to this day. The decades-old \r\nblockade is one of the longest-running campaigns, \r\nspilling over into a new century and a new generation. \r\n Today, there are now more than 100 Pacific \r\nislands students studying medicine in Cuba. Despite \r\nthe economic, commercial and financial embargo, the \r\nCuban people in their hardship have sheltered, fed and \r\nclothed our young people. Solomon Islands remains \r\nthankful for that and commends the resilience of the \r\nCuban people. We also know that, without the \r\nembargo, Cuba could do more for the developing \r\nworld. \r\n The reference to those young people is to \r\nunderscore the argument that the United Nations \r\nCharter is centred on its peoples and begins with “We \r\nthe peoples”. We, States Members of the United \r\nNations, must continue to give humanity a chance and \r\nto work together to build bridges over the embargo. We \r\nmust do so in the name of peace, security and the \r\nCuban people’s right to development. \r\n Solomon Islands calls for the unconditional \r\nlifting of the blockade against the Cuban people and its \r\nreplacement with genuine dialogue and cooperation. \r\nWe make this call in conformity with the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter and \r\ninternational law, and as an opportunity for a new \r\nbeginning between Cuba and the United States. \r\n Mr. Ja’afari (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): May I begin by expressing Syria’s support for \r\nthe statements delivered by the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of the Sudan on behalf of the Group of \r\n77 and China and by the Permanent Representative of \r\nEgypt on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement. \r\n The right of States to exercise sovereignty over \r\ntheir territory and to non-interference in their own \r\ninternal affairs is enshrined in the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter. Those \r\nprinciples and their inviolability have been part of the \r\nUnited Nations since its founding in 1945.  \r\n As the host country, the United States contributed \r\nto the drafting of the United Nations Charter following \r\nthe Second World War, in which many States had had \r\nthe bitter experience of outside interference in their \r\ninternal affairs and of their sovereignty being \r\nthreatened both before and during the hostilities. The \r\nUnited States, more than any other State, is therefore \r\nsupposed to respect the United Nations Charter. \r\n The unilateral embargo imposed by the United \r\nStates against Cuba and new measures to tighten the \r\ngrip of the embargo run counter to the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter and of \r\ninternational and international humanitarian law, and to \r\nthe rules and principles governing relations between \r\nStates, in particular the equal sovereignty of States, \r\nnon-interference in their internal affairs, and the \r\nfreedom of international trade and navigation.  \r\n The embargo is thus illegal and does not conform \r\nto international standards of intergovernmental \r\nrelations. It poses an unprecedented challenge to \r\ninternational law, as well as to the credibility of the \r\nlegality of United States policy. The 49-year-old \r\nembargo is unprecedented in bilateral relations and \r\nextraneous to international law. It has subjected Cuba \r\nto numerous economic, social and political hardships \r\nand increased the suffering of the Cuban people. It has \r\nalso placed the United States in direct confrontation \r\nwith the international community.  \r\n My delegation commends Cuba’s stated \r\ncommitment to constructive dialogue with the United \r\nStates with a view to resolving all the issues between \r\nthe two parties on the basis of the equal sovereignty of \r\nStates, mutual respect, non-interference in their \r\ninternal affairs, and respect for the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter and for the \r\nprinciples of good-neighbourliness. \r\n We believe that relations between countries, \r\nespecially between the United States and Cuba, should \r\n A/64/PV.27\r\n \r\n27 09-57988 \r\n \r\nbe normalized to take the interests of the peoples of \r\nboth countries into account. We assert the right of \r\npeoples to freely choose their own economic, political, \r\nsocial and cultural systems.  \r\n The 187 votes in favour of resolution 64/6 at this \r\nmeeting reaffirm the fact that the overwhelming \r\nmajority of countries believe that the time has come to \r\nlift the illegal embargo imposed on Cuba and underline \r\nthe need to respect national, political, economic and \r\nsocial systems freely chosen by States in the light of \r\ntheir own interests.  \r\n Coercive, unwarranted economic measures \r\nimposed against other countries because of their \r\npolitical orientation are unacceptable to the \r\ninternational community. The international community \r\nhas repeatedly denounced the pursuit of unilateral \r\nmeasures against Cuba, as well as efforts to broaden \r\nthe sanctions through the so-called Helms-Burton Act. \r\n Pursuant to its mandate, the General Assembly \r\nmust take the necessary steps to put an end to the \r\nembargo policies and sanctions imposed by the United \r\nStates on its neighbours and countries further afield. \r\nWe hope that the embargoes imposed on Cuba and \r\nseveral other countries, including my own, Syria, will \r\ncome to an end. We hope that the voice of the \r\ninternational community and international \r\norganizations and institutions will be heeded and \r\nrespected by the United States and its legislative \r\nbodies.  \r\n In the light of the foregoing, Syria voted in \r\nfavour of resolution 64/6. Israel’s aberrant vote against \r\nthe resolution, which was adopted by the \r\noverwhelming majority, was most revealing. It was \r\nalso an acknowledgment of the fact that Israel flouts \r\ninternational law and the voice of the international \r\ncommunity, and that it represents an isolated minority. \r\nIts position exacerbates the situation and makes it even \r\nmore difficult for the United States to revert to the \r\nlogic of dialogue in seeking to resolve disputes \r\nbetween countries and to apply international law while \r\nrespecting the differing opinions. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I beseech \r\ndelegations to be brief. \r\n Mr. Sinoussi (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in \r\nArabic): The people of Cuba continue to suffer under \r\nan unfair blockade that has lasted for more than four \r\ndecades and had serious impacts on all levels of \r\nsociety, including the most vulnerable, such as \r\nchildren, women and the elderly. The blockade has also \r\nsharply reduced Cuba’s capacity to import food and \r\ngoods that meet its medical and agricultural needs, and \r\nhas certainly hampered the country’s development \r\nefforts.  \r\n The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya expresses great \r\nconcern and asserts that the imposition of such \r\nunilateral and abusive economic measures by some \r\ncountries is extraterritorial in nature and explicitly \r\nviolates international law. We reiterate our rejection of \r\nsuch measures and stress that embargoes are not the \r\nway to resolve disputes between countries, but that, on \r\nthe contrary, they further complicate them.  \r\n As civilized nations, we repudiate violence in all \r\nits forms and manifestations, including the imposition \r\nof sanctions and blockades. Therefore, we must choose \r\nthe path of wisdom, rationality and constructive \r\ndialogue to resolve our disputes. That is not difficult if \r\nthere is enough political will. \r\n We believe that the United States Government’s \r\ndecision to ease its unilateral measures is cause for \r\noptimism. We hope that it will introduce further \r\nmeasures that take into account the humanitarian needs \r\nof the Cuban people and international law and that it \r\nwill eventually lift the blockade once and for all. \r\n Mr. Wetland (Norway): Norway considers the \r\nUnited States embargo against Cuba to be a bilateral \r\nissue. We support sanctions when they are adopted by \r\nthe international community through the United \r\nNations, but cannot support the exterritorial extension \r\nof unilateral measures against another country. \r\nTherefore, we cannot accept that unilateral measures \r\nimposed by the United States should determine \r\nNorway’s relations with Cuba.  \r\n Norway welcomes the recent decision of the \r\nUnited States Government to lift restrictions on \r\nremittances and family travel to Cuba and encourages \r\nboth the United States and Cuba to make further efforts \r\nto improve their bilateral relationship. \r\n While Norway is encouraged by some positive \r\ndevelopments in the area of human rights in Cuba, we \r\nnevertheless remain concerned about their protection \r\nand promotion. We reiterate our call on the \r\nGovernment of Cuba to release all political prisoners \r\nunconditionally. We also reiterate our call on the Cuban \r\nA/64/PV.27  \r\n \r\n09-57988 28 \r\n \r\nGovernment to grant freedom of expression and free \r\naccess to information.  \r\n Norway does not consider isolation to be an \r\nappropriate response to the developments in Cuba. \r\nMore can be achieved through a constructive dialogue \r\nwith the Government of Cuba. Moving forward, \r\nNorway intends to contribute to such a dialogue. For \r\nthese reasons, Norway voted in favour of today’s \r\nresolution, as it has in previous years. \r\n Mr. Rugunda (Uganda): Uganda aligns itself \r\nwith the statements made by the representative of the \r\nSudan on behalf of the Group of 77 and China and by \r\nthe representative of Egypt on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement.  \r\n Uganda voted in favour of today’s resolution, as \r\nit has consistently done in the past, as it opposes the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo against \r\nCuba. The embargo is unjustified. It has had an adverse \r\nimpact on the people of Cuba for too long. \r\nFurthermore, we do not support unilateral measures \r\nwith extraterritorial applications, which we believe are \r\ninconsistent with the principles of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, international law and humanitarian \r\nlaw. \r\n Mr. Zinsou (Benin) (spoke in French): Benin \r\nvoted in favour of the resolution that has just been \r\nadopted, because we believe in friendly relations \r\nbetween States.  \r\n By their extraterritorial nature, the measures \r\nimposed on Cuba 50 years ago in the context of the \r\ncold war continue to hamper the country’s exercise of \r\nits rights as a sovereign State on the international \r\nstage. This Assembly is the right place to recall that \r\nrelations between States Members of the United \r\nNations are ruled by the Charter. The Cuban people ask \r\nonly that they be allowed to live in an atmosphere of \r\nrespect for their rights as a sovereign State and a \r\ncountry of peace and justice, and that they be accorded \r\nreciprocal advantages.  \r\n The current situation is a historic opportunity that \r\nmust be exploited to ensure that the blockade is lifted \r\nin an amicable manner. The profound changes that \r\nhave taken place in the lives of the two nations should \r\nlead to improved relations in line with the provisions \r\nof the United Nations Charter. Benin appeals urgently \r\nto the Governments of the United States and Cuba to \r\nlaunch without delay a frank dialogue towards \r\nnormalizing relations between the two countries. We \r\nwelcome the measures taken by the Administration of \r\nPresident Obama to ease restrictions on travel and \r\nremittances from Cuban-Americans to their country of \r\norigin. This is an important step towards the full \r\nrapprochement desired by all. \r\n The more there are among us demanding a \r\nclosure to this painful chapter of international \r\nrelations, the more our voices will be heard and the \r\nmore powerful our call for reconciliation between two \r\nnations that are both friends of Benin. The people of \r\nBenin truly hope to see the two countries shake hands, \r\nrepudiate the illogic of coercion and restart their \r\nrelationship on a healthier basis. \r\n Mr. Yaroshevich (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): \r\nToday, the General Assembly has adopted its \r\neighteenth resolution on the necessity of ending the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed \r\nby the United States of America against Cuba. Once \r\nagain, some 99 per cent of Member States, including \r\nthe closest political partners of the United States, have \r\nappealed to that country to lift the blockade, which has \r\nbeen in place for half a century. We hope that this time \r\nthe voice of the international community will be \r\nheeded in Washington, D.C. \r\n The Belarusian delegation would like to quote \r\nfrom the Special Declaration of the Heads of State and \r\nGovernment of the Non-Aligned Countries, adopted at \r\ntheir fifteenth summit conference in Sharm el-Sheik, \r\nEgypt, in July 2009, on the issue of the United States \r\nblockade against Cuba, which stresses that “under no \r\ncircumstances people should be deprived of their own \r\nmeans of subsistence and development”.  \r\n The practice of imposing measures to apply \r\neconomic pressure on a country creates serious \r\nobstacles to its achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and contributes to international \r\ninstability. Speaking at the general debate of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fourth session (see \r\nA/64/PV.10), the Foreign Minister of the Republic of \r\nBelarus noted that it appears that, after a long hiatus, \r\nthe international community is starting to think in \r\nterms of a single system of references, while political \r\nleaders are beginning to speak in the same language of \r\ncommon sense. In particular, this year the United \r\nStates declared its readiness to build partnerships and \r\nresolve problems that no country can resolve in \r\nisolation. \r\n A/64/PV.27\r\n \r\n29 09-57988 \r\n \r\n We call on the United States to act in keeping \r\nwith the constructive foreign policy course it itself has \r\noutlined, to end the embargo and to lift restrictions that \r\nimpair the vital interests of the people of Cuba. We are \r\ncertain that, in the light of the global financial and \r\neconomic crisis, the arsenal of unilateral sanctions and \r\ncoercive measures is especially inappropriate. \r\n Mr. Hamza (United Republic of Tanzania): I \r\nthank you, Sir, for granting me this opportunity to \r\nspeak after the voting. My delegation aligns itself with \r\nthe statements made by the representatives of the \r\nSudan on behalf of the Group of 77 and China and of \r\nEgypt on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement. \r\n The United Republic of Tanzania voted in favour \r\nof the resolution to end the economic and financial \r\nembargo on Cuba because we believe that current \r\npolitical and economic realities in the world, and in \r\nparticular between Cuba and the United States, warrant \r\nan end to the embargo. Both sides wish to enhance \r\ndemocracy and good governance in order to promote \r\nthe economic and financial prosperity of their \r\ncountries. The embargo does not promote such goals. \r\n Furthermore, Tanzania is convinced that if the \r\npeoples of the two countries are to continue working \r\ntowards economic growth and prosperity, there must be \r\nincreased and varied contacts between them. This is \r\ncrucial, particularly in the areas of trade and people-to-\r\npeople communication. \r\n We also welcome the lifting of the restriction on \r\nfamily travel imposed by the United States. This indeed \r\nreflects a positive trend and an improved beginning of \r\nthe end of the embargo. We urge both sides to develop \r\nconfidence-building measures to set the ground for \r\nfuture cooperation between Cuba and the United States \r\nafter the lifting of the embargo. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I call on the \r\nrepresentative of Cuba in exercise of the right of reply. \r\n Mr. Rodríguez Parrilla (Cuba) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): I feel obliged to respond to the statements of \r\nthe United States, the European Union and Norway.  \r\n I must tell the European Union that Cuba in no \r\nway recognizes its moral authority to dictate models or \r\ngive advice on democracy. I would like to remind the \r\nUnion of its complicity with the acts of torture that \r\ntook place in Guantánamo and Abu Ghraib, and I \r\nreiterate that so long as it resorts to double standards \r\nand hypocrisy, it will have no credibility whatsoever. \r\n Ms. Susan Rice, who unfortunately is not present \r\nin the Hall right now, began by saying: “Here we go \r\nagain”. With those words, she acknowledged that she \r\nwas here to do what 17 United States representatives \r\nhave done in the past. I respect her opinions and I \r\nacknowledge that her career is different from that of a \r\nneo-conservative such as John Bolton, but she had the \r\nsad task here of defending a blockade policy that \r\nbegan, according to a classified memorandum of \r\n6 April 1960, with the declared aim of causing the \r\nhunger, despair and hopelessness of the Cuban people. \r\nThe only remains of the cold war, as has been \r\nmentioned here, is the blockade itself. If the blockade \r\nis lifted, that relic will disappear.  \r\n Cuba is a democracy that is closer to Lincoln’s \r\nprinciples of a Government of the people, by the \r\npeople and for the people than the plutocracy or \r\nGovernment of the rich currently running that country. \r\nThe United States Ambassador identified as dissidents \r\nor political prisoners people who are in fact agents of a \r\nforeign Power — mercenaries paid by the Government \r\nof the United States. If she wants to talk about political \r\nprisoners, the United States should release the five \r\nanti-terrorist Cuban heroes subject to cruel, inhumane \r\nand degrading treatment in American prisons. \r\n Ambassador Rice said that we are abusing the \r\nword “genocide” when we talk of the blockade. I quote \r\nparagraphs (b) and (c) of article 2 of the 1948 \r\nConvention on the Prevention and Punishment of the \r\nCrime of Genocide. Paragraph (b) notes that genocide \r\nis an act “[c]ausing serious bodily or mental harm to \r\nmembers of the group”, referring to a group of human \r\nbeings, and paragraph (c) notes that genocide is an act \r\nof “deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of \r\nlife calculated to bring about its physical destruction in \r\nwhole or in part”. I invite the United States Department \r\nof State to study that Convention more closely. \r\n The embargo against Cuba is a unilateral and \r\ncriminal policy and as such must be lifted unilaterally. \r\nIt is neither reasonable nor fair nor possible to expect \r\nCuba to move to make this criminal action against its \r\npeople, including its children and elderly, stop, with \r\nthe examples mentioned previously. \r\n The United States should lift the embargo and lift \r\nit now; first of all, because Cuba has no embargo \r\nagainst the United States, nor does it occupy any part \r\nof its territory with a military base, nor do we \r\ndiscriminate against its citizens or companies. \r\nA/64/PV.27  \r\n \r\n09-57988 30 \r\n \r\nSecondly, it should lift the blockade because it is in the \r\nbest interests of the United States itself and it is the \r\nwill of the people of the United States.  \r\n There has been mention of the free movement of \r\ninformation. Lift the prohibition of United States \r\ncitizens to travel freely to Cuba. Respect their right to \r\nfreedom of movement. Lift the embargo against Cuba \r\nin the area of technology and information. Permit \r\nbetter connectivity for our country. Export software \r\nand technology to Cuba and there will be progress in \r\nthat field. \r\n Ms. Rice mentioned constructive progress. It is \r\ntrue that there have been some steps in the right \r\ndirection, but they have been strictly limited to \r\nrelations between Cubans living in the United States \r\nwith their country of origin, and they have nothing to \r\ndo with nor do they signify any flexibility with regard \r\nto the embargo. They are steps in the right direction but \r\nare very limited and insufficient. \r\n The embargo is not a bilateral issue. That has \r\nbeen clearly demonstrated by the many examples of its \r\nextraterritorial application. Ms. Rice has reiterated the \r\nproposal to continue with exchanges or dialogue \r\nbetween the two countries. That idea was presented \r\nmany years ago by Commander-in-Chief Fidel Castro \r\nand reiterated several times in public by President Raúl \r\nCastro. If the United States wants to enter into a \r\ndialogue, it should respond to the proposal of a \r\nbilateral agenda presented by Cuba to that Government \r\non 17 July 2009. \r\n At New York University in August, Ms. Susan \r\nRice said that the United States leads by example, \r\nacknowledges mistakes, corrects course when \r\nnecessary, treats others with respect, and forges \r\nstrategies in partnership. In the same speech, she also \r\nsaid that we are proving that the United States is \r\nwilling to listen, respect differences and consider new \r\nideas. I am very surprised that Ambassador Rice had to \r\nsay the complete opposite this morning. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): As in previous \r\nyears, the General Assembly has just expressed its \r\nopinion on the agenda item by adopting a resolution — \r\nresolution 64/6 — that enjoys the support of the \r\noverwhelming majority of Member States. In \r\nproceeding in this fashion, the international community \r\nhas expressed its insistence on strict compliance with \r\nthe principles and purposes expressed in the Charter. I \r\ntherefore cherish the hope that the appeals addressed \r\nhere for implementation of this resolution will be heard \r\nby all of us.  \r\n At a time when we see a will to spurn \r\nconfrontation and unilateralism, we see great support \r\nfor dialogue and multilateralism. We need to see the \r\npositive aspects of that approach and put an end to \r\nsanctions and embargoes and open up the way to peace, \r\ndevelopment and cooperation. We hope that all parties \r\nwill find a solution to conflicts through cooperation \r\nand dialogue.  \r\n May I take it that it is the wish of the General \r\nAssembly to conclude its consideration of agenda \r\nitem 19? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 7 (continued) \r\n \r\nOrganization of work, adoption of the agenda and \r\nallocation of items \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): Before \r\nadjourning, I invite the Assembly to take a decision on \r\nan issue as follows. In a letter dated 27 October 2009 \r\nto all Permanent Representatives and Permanent \r\nObservers to the United Nations, I forwarded a letter \r\ndated 16 October 2009 from the President of the \r\nHuman Rights Council transmitting Council resolution \r\nS-12/1 for the consideration of the Assembly at its \r\nsixty-fourth session. I also attached two letters dated \r\n26 and 27 October 2009 from the chargé d’affaires ad \r\ninterim of the Sudan, in his capacity as the Chairman \r\nof the Group of Arab States, and the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Egypt, in his capacity as the \r\nChairman of the Coordinating Bureau of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement, with a request that the report \r\nof the Human Rights Council on its twelfth special \r\nsession be considered directly in plenary meeting under \r\nagenda item 64, entitled “Report of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil”, during the first week of November.  \r\n Members will recall that at its 2nd plenary \r\nmeeting, on 18 September 2009, the Assembly decided, \r\ninter alia, to allocate agenda item 64 to the plenary and \r\nthe Third Committee. If there is no objection, may I \r\ntake it that the Assembly decides to consider the report \r\nof the Human Rights Council on its twelfth special \r\nsession, as contained in document A/64/53/Add.1, at a \r\nplenary meeting, without setting a precedent? \r\n It was so decided. \r\nThe meeting rose at 1.35 p.m. \r\n"
