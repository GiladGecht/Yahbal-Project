(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 3.20 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 72 \r\n \r\nReport of the International Court of Justice \r\n \r\n  Report of the International Court of Justice \r\n(A/64/4) \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/64/308) \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): May I take it \r\nthat the General Assembly takes note of the report of \r\nthe International Court of Justice for the period \r\n1 August 2008 to 31 July 2009? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): In connection \r\nwith this item, the Assembly also has before it a report \r\nof the Secretary-General on the Secretary-General’s \r\nTrust Fund to Assist States in the Settlement of \r\nDisputes through the International Court of Justice, \r\nwhich has been circulated in document A/64/308. \r\n It is now my pleasure to give the floor to \r\nMr. Hisashi Owada, President of the International \r\nCourt of Justice. \r\n Mr. Owada: Before I turn to the report of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice (ICJ), I wish on behalf of \r\nthe Court that I represent to convey our deepest \r\nsympathy and condolences to the families of the five \r\nUnited Nations staff members who were killed in the \r\nrecent shocking and shameless raid by terrorists in \r\nAfghanistan. I join the Secretary-General and the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly in condemning all \r\nthreats and acts of violence against humanitarian \r\npersonnel and United Nations personnel. The \r\nInternational Court of Justice is engaged in the \r\npromotion of the rule of law in the international \r\ncommunity and it is important to reaffirm the need to \r\nhold accountable those who are responsible for such \r\nacts of atrocity.  \r\n It is an honour and a privilege for me to address \r\nthe General Assembly for the first time as President of \r\nthe International Court of Justice on the report of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice for the period from \r\n1 August 2008 to 31 July 2009 (A/64/4). \r\n I take this opportunity to congratulate you, \r\nMr. Treki, on your election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-fourth session and to wish you \r\nevery success in that distinguished office.  \r\n Over the course of the last decades, the trust and \r\nrespect of the international community for the \r\nactivities of the Court as the principal judicial organ of \r\nthe United Nations has been growing. This growth is \r\nreflected in the increased number and broadened \r\nsubject matter of the cases brought before the Court by \r\nMembers of the United Nations. The past year was no \r\nexception.  \r\n To give the Assembly a schematic view of the \r\njudicial activities of the Court over the period under \r\nreview: the Court had more than 16 cases on its docket \r\nand rendered two judgments on the merits — one \r\njudgment in a request for interpretation and one \r\njudgment on preliminary objections — and two orders \r\non requests for the indication of provisional measures.  \r\nA/64/PV.30  \r\n \r\n09-58351 2 \r\n \r\n What is more remarkable is that the cases before \r\nthe Court have involved States from nearly all \r\ncontinents, that is Asia, Europe, North America, \r\nCentral America and Africa. The docket of the Court \r\nindeed represents the universal character of the \r\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations. The \r\nsubject matter has been truly wide-ranging, extending \r\nfrom such classic issues as territorial and maritime \r\ndelimitation and diplomatic protection to issues of \r\nincreasing relevance to the contemporary international \r\ncommunity, such as human rights, the status of \r\nindividuals, international humanitarian law and \r\nenvironmental issues. \r\n These cases present complicated sets of factual \r\nissues that have to be evaluated against diverse social \r\nand historical backgrounds and in the light of a new \r\nlegal environment composed of emerging normative \r\nchallenges faced by the international community. \r\nWithin such an environment the Court has to carefully \r\nexamine these elements of fact and law collectively; its \r\nmembers represent diverse historical, social and \r\ncultural backgrounds and the major legal systems of \r\nthe world. \r\n I would now like to turn, as it has become a \r\ntradition of the Court, to an overview of the judicial \r\nactivities of the Court during the past year. \r\nChronologically, the first is the order indicating \r\nprovisional measures issued by the Court on \r\n15 October 2008 in the case between Georgia and the \r\nRussian Federation concerning the Application of the \r\nInternational Convention on the Elimination of All \r\nForms of Racial Discrimination. The case itself was \r\nfiled by Georgia on 12 August 2008, alleging \r\nviolations of the International Convention on the \r\nElimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination \r\n(CERD) and founding the Court’s jurisdiction on \r\narticle 22 of that Convention.  \r\n Two days later, on 14 August 2008, Georgia \r\nfollowed up that application with a request for the \r\nindication of provisional measures, requesting that the \r\nCourt order the Russian Federation to refrain from any \r\nacts of racial discrimination, to prevent groups or \r\nindividuals from subjecting ethnic Georgians to such \r\nacts, to refrain from taking any actions or supporting \r\nany measures that obstruct ethnic Georgians’ right of \r\nreturn to South Ossetia, Abkhazia and adjacent regions \r\nand to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance \r\nto all individuals in the territory under its control. \r\n In compliance with article 74 of the Rules of \r\nCourt, before proceeding to the merits of the \r\napplication, the Court first took up the request for the \r\nindication of provisional measures of protection. The \r\nCourt found that “the Parties disagree with regard to \r\nthe applicability of articles 2 and 5 of CERD in the \r\ncontext of the events in South Ossetia and Abkhazia” \r\nand that “there appears to exist a dispute between the \r\nParties as to the interpretation and application of \r\nCERD”. It further took the view that the procedural \r\nconditions in article 22 of CERD had been met, \r\nconcluding in particular that while article 22 requires \r\nthat some attempt be made to initiate discussions \r\nbetween the parties on issues that would fall under \r\nCERD, it does not require the carrying out of formal \r\nnegotiations.  \r\n On those grounds, the Court determined that it \r\nhad prima facie jurisdiction to deal with the case. As to \r\nthe merits of the request, the Court concluded that “the \r\nethnic Georgian population in the areas affected by the \r\nrecent conflict remains vulnerable” and that there \r\nexisted an imminent risk that they could suffer \r\nirreparable prejudice. The Court therefore indicated \r\nprovisional measures, ordering both parties to refrain \r\nfrom any act of racial discrimination or sponsoring, \r\ndefending or supporting racial discrimination; to \r\nrefrain from placing any impediment to humanitarian \r\nassistance to the local population; and to refrain from \r\nany action which might prejudice the rights of the other \r\nParty or aggravate the dispute. \r\n The next case resulted in a judgment on \r\n18 November 2008 on the preliminary objections in the \r\ncase concerning the Application of the Convention on \r\nthe Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of \r\nGenocide (Croatia v. Serbia), which had been brought \r\nbefore the Court in 1999 by the Republic of Croatia. \r\nCroatia alleged that the Republic of Serbia was \r\nresponsible for violations of the Genocide Convention \r\non the basis of article IX of the Convention. Serbia \r\nraised a preliminary objection by arguing that the \r\nCourt lacked jurisdiction, first, because Serbia had \r\nlacked locus standi before the Court as it was not a \r\nMember of the United Nations when Croatia filed its \r\napplication and, secondly, because Serbia had not \r\nconsented to the jurisdiction of the Court as it was not \r\na party to the Genocide Convention. \r\n The Court accepted that Serbia had not been a \r\nmember of the United Nations as of 2 July 1999, the \r\ndate of the filing of the application by Croatia. Serbia \r\n A/64/PV.30\r\n \r\n3 09-58351 \r\n \r\nwas a Member of the United Nations and therefore a \r\nparty to the Statute of the Court as from 1 November \r\n2000, when it was admitted to the United Nations. The \r\nCourt accepted that the jurisdiction of the Court is \r\nnormally assessed on the date of the filing of the act \r\ninstituting proceedings. In this case, the Court took an \r\nexception to that principle on the grounds of realism \r\nand flexibility in certain situations in which the \r\nconditions governing the Court’s jurisdiction were not \r\nfully satisfied when proceedings were initiated, but \r\nwere subsequently satisfied before the Court ruled on \r\nits jurisdiction.  \r\n In that respect, the Court followed the line \r\nenunciated by the 1924 judgment of the Permanent \r\nCourt of International Justice in the case concerning \r\nthe Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions, in which the \r\nPermanent Court held that “[t]he Court, whose \r\njurisdiction is international, is not bound to attach to \r\nmatters of form the same degree of importance which \r\nthey might possess in municipal law”. \r\n In the Croatia v. Serbia case, the Court applied \r\nthat principle by extending it to the question of access \r\nto the Court, concluding that any initial lack of access \r\ncan be remedied without violating the fundamental \r\nprinciples of the proper administration of justice by \r\nway of a new, subsequent application to submit \r\nCroatia’s claim.  \r\n On the second leg of the preliminary objections \r\nof Serbia on whether the Court had jurisdiction under \r\narticle IX of the Genocide Convention, the Court held \r\nthat the declaration and note of 27 April 1992, in which \r\nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia agreed to strictly \r\nabide by all the commitments that the Socialist Federal \r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia had assumed internationally \r\nand to continue to fulfil all obligations assumed by the \r\nSocialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in \r\ninternational relations, including its participation in \r\ninternational treaties ratified or acceded to by \r\nYugoslavia, had the effect of a notification of \r\nsuccession by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to \r\nthe Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in relation \r\nto the Genocide Convention, and therefore the Court \r\nhad, on the date on which the present proceedings were \r\ninstituted, jurisdiction to entertain the case on the basis \r\nof article IX of the Genocide Convention. The case will \r\nnow move to the merits phase. The Court fixed \r\n22 March 2010 as the deadline for the filing of a \r\ncounter-memorial by the Republic of Serbia. \r\n The next case turned to the American continent. \r\nOn 19 January of this year, the Court delivered its \r\njudgment on the Request for interpretation of the \r\nJudgment of 31 March 2004 in the Case concerning \r\nAvena and Other Mexican Nationals (Mexico v. United \r\nStates of America). In that case, Mexico had asked the \r\nCourt to interpret its earlier judgment on the same \r\nissue of 2004, in particular to adjudge and declare that \r\nthe obligation incumbent upon the United States under \r\nparagraph 153 (9) of the Avena judgment constitutes an \r\nobligation of result and that, pursuant to that obligation \r\nof result, the United States must take any and all steps \r\nnecessary to ensure that no Mexican national entitled \r\nto review and reconsideration under the Avena \r\njudgment is executed unless and until that review and \r\nreconsideration is completed and it is determined that \r\nno prejudice resulted from the violations. \r\n The Assembly might recall that last year the \r\nCourt, in its order of 16 July 2008 on the request for \r\nthe indication of provisional measures of protection \r\naccompanying the application for interpretation of the \r\njudgment of 31 March 2004, decided that “the United \r\nStates of America shall take all measures necessary to \r\nensure that ... Messrs. César Roberto Fierro Reyna, \r\nMr. Roberto Moreno Ramos” and Mr. Osvaldo Tones \r\nAguilera “are not executed” pending final judgment in \r\nthese proceedings.  \r\n In the present phase of the case, the Court took \r\nthe position that paragraph 153 (9) of the judgment did \r\nnot decide on the question in dispute in the application \r\non interpretation, that is, whether that obligation of \r\nresult contained in paragraph 153 (9) was directly \r\nenforceable in the United States. The Court held that \r\nbecause that latter question was not decided in the \r\noriginal judgment, it could not be submitted in the \r\napplication for interpretation under Article 60 of the \r\nStatute. In effect, what the Court found was that \r\nMexico’s request for interpretation dealt not with the \r\nmeaning and scope of the Avena judgment, as \r\nArticle 60 of the Statute requires, but rather with the \r\ngeneral question of the effect of a judgment of the \r\nCourt in the domestic legal order of the States parties \r\nto the case in which the judgment was delivered. \r\n Fourthly, on 3 February this year, the Court \r\ndelivered its judgment in the case Maritime \r\nDelimitation in the Black Sea (Romania v. Ukraine). \r\nThat was the first case in which those two States came \r\nto settle their dispute before the International Court of \r\nJustice. In that case, the Court was requested to draw a \r\nA/64/PV.30  \r\n \r\n09-58351 4 \r\n \r\nsingle maritime boundary delimiting the continental \r\nshelf and exclusive economic zones between Romania \r\nand Ukraine in the Black Sea. The issue of the \r\nmaritime delimitation, especially relating to the \r\ndelimitation of the continental shelf and exclusive \r\neconomic zone, has been the subject of many disputes \r\nthat have come before the Court since the 1969 North \r\nSea Continental Shelf cases.  \r\n Since that 1969 judgment, the jurisprudence of \r\nthe Court on this issue has gone through a considerable \r\nevolution against the background of the entry into \r\nforce of the United Nations Convention on the Law of \r\nthe Sea in 1982. One significant element in the Black \r\nSea judgment is that it sets out in a structured way the \r\npresent state of the law on the issue of maritime \r\ndelimitation. On the basis of established State practice \r\nand, in particular, its jurisprudence, the Court stated \r\nthat the law in the area of maritime delimitation has \r\ndeveloped into a three-step approach that the Court has \r\nto follow: first, establishing a provisional equidistance \r\nline; secondly, considering factors that may call for an \r\nadjustment of that line and adjusting it accordingly; \r\nand thirdly, confirming that the line thus adjusted will \r\nnot lead to an inequitable result, by comparing such \r\nfactors as the ratio of coastal lengths to the ratio of \r\nmaritime areas which result from the delimitation line.  \r\n Another interesting new development came with \r\nthe case entitled Questions relating to the Obligation to \r\nProsecute or Extradite (Belgium v. Senegal). Belgium \r\nfiled an application on 19 February 2009 in relation to \r\nMr. Hissène Habré, the former President of Chad, who \r\nhad been present on Senegalese territory since 1990. \r\nBelgium submitted that by failing to prosecute or \r\nextradite Mr. Habré for certain acts that he is alleged to \r\nhave committed during his presidency, including \r\ncrimes of torture and crimes against humanity, Senegal \r\nhad violated the obligation aut dedere aut judicare \r\ncontained in article 7 of the Convention against Torture \r\nand in customary international law. \r\n On the same day, Belgium filed a request for the \r\nindication of provisional measures, asking the Court to \r\nrequire Senegal to take all steps within its power to \r\nkeep Mr. Hissène Habré under the control and \r\nsurveillance of the judicial authorities of Senegal so \r\nthat the rule of international law with which Belgium \r\nrequested compliance might be correctly applied.  \r\n In the course of the oral hearings, Senegal \r\nconfirmed its position, in the form of a formal \r\ndeclaration, that it would not allow Mr. Habré to leave \r\nits territory while the case was pending before the \r\nCourt. Under those circumstances, the Court held that \r\nthere was no risk of irreparable prejudice to the rights \r\nclaimed by Belgium and that no urgency justifying the \r\nindication of provisional measures existed. On those \r\ngrounds, the Court declined to exercise its power under \r\nArticle 41 to indicate provisional measures. \r\n Finally, on 13 July 2009, the Court rendered its \r\njudgment in a case between Costa Rica and Nicaragua. \r\nThis dispute concerned the navigational and related \r\nrights of Costa Rica on a section of the San Juan River, \r\nthe southern bank of which forms the boundary \r\nbetween the two States pursuant to an 1858 bilateral \r\ntreaty. While it was not contested that according to that \r\ntreaty the relevant section of the river belongs to \r\nNicaragua, the parties differed as to the nature of the \r\nlegal regime under the treaty and the precise scope of \r\nCosta Rica’s navigational rights on the river and the \r\nprerogatives of Nicaragua in respect of navigation. The \r\nCourt had to assess in particular the meaning and scope \r\nof the expression used in the 1858 treaty, “libre \r\nnavegación ... con objetos de comercio”, a question \r\nwhich deeply divided the parties. The Court found that \r\nthis right of free navigation included navigation for the \r\npurposes of commerce and not just navigation with \r\narticles of trade and held that the expression applied to \r\nthe transport of persons, including tourists, as well as \r\nto the transport of goods.  \r\n After stating the basic principles governing the \r\nregime established by the 1858 treaty, the Court went \r\non to examine the specific scope of the Nicaraguan \r\nregulatory measures which were accepted as a matter \r\nof principle as pertaining to Nicaragua as part of this \r\nregime. The Court held that some of the measures \r\ntaken by Nicaragua were in conformity with the \r\n1858 treaty, while other measures were not in \r\nconformity with the treaty.  \r\n Several new contentious cases were filed with the \r\nCourt in the past year. First, in August 2008, Georgia \r\ninstituted proceedings against the Russian Federation, \r\nas I mentioned earlier. The Court has so far dealt with \r\nits request for the indication of provisional measures.  \r\n Secondly, in November 2008, the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia instituted \r\nproceedings against Greece, contending that the latter \r\nviolated its rights established under an interim accord \r\n A/64/PV.30\r\n \r\n5 09-58351 \r\n \r\nagreed by the two States, by objecting to its application \r\nto join NATO.  \r\n Thirdly, in December 2008, Germany instituted \r\nproceedings against Italy, contending that Italy had \r\nviolated German sovereign immunity by allowing \r\nseveral civil claims in Italian courts concerning \r\nviolations of international humanitarian law by the \r\nGerman Reich during the Second World War.  \r\n Fourthly, in February 2009, Belgium instituted \r\nproceedings against Senegal relating to the obligation \r\nto extradite or prosecute the former President of Chad. \r\nOn that case also, as I mentioned earlier, the Court has \r\ndisposed of Belgium’s request for the indication of \r\nprovisional measures.  \r\n In addition, the Registry of the Court only \r\nyesterday received an application instituting \r\nproceedings by the Republic of Honduras against the \r\nFederative Republic of Brazil.  \r\n Finally, from 14 September to 2 October 2009, \r\nthe Court heard arguments on the merits in a case \r\nbetween Argentina and Uruguay, Pulp Mills on the \r\nRiver Uruguay. A final judgment is expected in due \r\ncourse. \r\n In addition to these new contentious cases, there \r\nwas a new development in the advisory proceedings \r\nbefore the Court. In October 2008, the Court received a \r\nrequest from the General Assembly for an advisory \r\nopinion on the accordance with international law of the \r\nunilateral declaration of independence by the \r\nProvisional Institutions of Self-Government of Kosovo. \r\nThirty-six United Nations Member States filed written \r\nstatements on that question. In addition, the authors of \r\nthe unilateral declaration of independence by the \r\nProvisional Institutions of Self-Government of Kosovo \r\nfiled a written contribution. We have received written \r\ncomments from 14 States and a further written \r\ncontribution from the authors of the declaration of \r\nindependence, commenting on the written statements \r\nof other States. Thirty States and the authors of the \r\nunilateral declaration have indicated their intention to \r\ntake part in the oral proceedings that will take place \r\nfrom 1 to 11 December this year. \r\n As I stated at the beginning of this presentation, \r\nthe increased recourse to the International Court of \r\nJustice by States for the judicial settlement of their \r\ndisputes points to the consciousness among political \r\nleaders of the importance of the rule of law in the \r\ninternational community. The importance of the rule of \r\nlaw is crucial against the backdrop of the deepening \r\nprocess of globalization. Law does not replace politics \r\nor economics, but without it we cannot construct \r\nanything that will last in the international community.  \r\n In this sense, the issue of the jurisdiction of the \r\nCourt is a crucial element. Only 66 States have so far \r\nmade declarations recognizing as compulsory the \r\njurisdiction of the Court, as contemplated by \r\nArticle 36, paragraphs 2 and 5, of the Statute. In order \r\nto strengthen the role of the Court, it is highly \r\nimportant to broaden this particular basis of \r\njurisdiction through wider acceptance by States of the \r\noptional clause.  \r\n The Court greatly appreciates the trust that \r\nMember States have continued to place in what the \r\nInternational Court of Justice is doing as the principal \r\njudicial organ of the United Nations. I pledge that the \r\nCourt will do its utmost to achieve its mandate as set \r\nout under the Charter and to assist the parties in the \r\npacific settlement of their disputes. Furthermore, I \r\nwish also to request Member States to strengthen their \r\nsupport and assistance by enhancing the capacity of the \r\nCourt in carrying out its task of the peaceful resolution \r\nof disputes. \r\n I assure the Assembly that the Court will continue \r\nto dedicate its fullest efforts to the peaceful settlement \r\nof disputes as well as to the promotion of the rule of \r\ninternational law with integrity and impartiality in \r\norder to meet the expectations of the United Nations \r\nand of the international community as a whole. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly I thank the President of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice for his report. I note that \r\nsince Judge Owada was elected President of the Court \r\non 6 February 2009 he has continued the Court’s \r\nefforts in expediting the proceedings before it, in order \r\nto enable the Court to discharge its mandate. As the \r\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations — whose \r\ncreation resulted from a long process to develop \r\nmethods for the peaceful settlement of international \r\ndisputes — the role of the Court in the promotion of \r\nthe rule of law and the consolidation of international \r\npeace and security cannot be overemphasized.  \r\n It is therefore our hope that Member States will \r\ncontinue to support the Court by affording it all \r\nrequired assistance, by providing the conducive \r\nenvironment necessary to strengthen its performance \r\nA/64/PV.30  \r\n \r\n09-58351 6 \r\n \r\nand by renewing their undertaking to comply with its \r\ndecisions. \r\n Mr. Kessel (Canada) (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of Canada, Australia and New Zealand (CANZ), \r\nI would like to thank the President of the International \r\nCourt of Justice, Judge Hisashi Owada, for the helpful \r\nreport on the work of the Court over the past year \r\n(A/64/4). Our delegations would also like to take this \r\nopportunity to congratulate Judge Owada and Judge \r\nTomka on their election by the Court as President and \r\nVice-President, respectively. We also thank their \r\npredecessors, Judge Higgins and Judge Al-Khasawneh, \r\nfor their esteemed leadership of the Court over the last \r\nthree years. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n CANZ continues its strong support of the Court \r\nin its role as the principal judicial organ of the United \r\nNations. As the report of the Court notes, the Court is \r\nthe only international court of a universal character \r\nwith general jurisdiction. As such, it has a unique role \r\nin furthering the peaceful settlement of international \r\ndisputes. \r\n Mr. Viinanen (Finland), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.  \r\n The diverse range of cases brought before the \r\nCourt for determination in the last year, as just referred \r\nto in the comprehensive report of Judge Owada — \r\nranging from environmental concerns and \r\njurisdictional immunities of the State to human rights \r\nissues — reflects the ongoing importance of the \r\nCourt’s work. \r\n We continue to urge Member States that have not \r\ndone so to deposit with the Secretary-General a \r\ndeclaration of acceptance of the Court’s compulsory \r\njurisdiction. As noted by Judge Higgins in her address \r\nto the General Assembly’s Sixth Committee last year, \r\nwithout such a declaration by States, the Court must \r\ntoo often spend time examining objections to its own \r\njurisdiction, rather than addressing the substantive \r\nproblems at issue. \r\n We value the Court’s efforts to continually review \r\nits procedures and working methods to ensure the \r\nefficient administration of its cases. In this regard, we \r\nnote that the Court has revised Practice Directions III \r\nand VI for use by States appearing before it. We join \r\nthe Court in urging States parties to keep written and \r\noral pleadings as concise as possible, in a manner \r\ncompatible with and relevant to the presentation of \r\ntheir positions. \r\n We welcome the Court’s adoption of new Practice \r\nDirection XIII, which will also assist States in \r\nstreamlining the Court’s processes by allowing \r\nagreement between the parties on future procedures. \r\n Mr. Winkler (Denmark): On behalf of the \r\ndelegations of the Nordic States — Sweden, Norway, \r\nIceland, Finland and my own country, Denmark — I \r\nwould like to thank the President of the International \r\nCourt of Justice, Judge Hisashi Owada, for the \r\nexcellent report on the work of the Court over the past \r\nyear (A/64/4). Before turning to the report, allow me to \r\nconvey our warmest congratulations to Judge Owada \r\nand to express our full support and our belief in his \r\ncompetent leadership. \r\n At the same time, I would like to take this \r\nopportunity to express our deep appreciation and \r\nthanks to Judge Rosalyn Higgins for her tremendous \r\ncontribution to the development of international law \r\nthrough her work as Judge and President of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice. \r\n The Nordic States continue to be strong \r\nsupporters of the International Court of Justice in its \r\nrole as the principal judicial organ of the United \r\nNations. The Court plays a vital role in the peaceful \r\nsettlement of international disputes and in \r\nstrengthening the international legal order, as mandated \r\nby the Charter. \r\n The Nordic States recognize the International \r\nCourt of Justice as the international court of a universal \r\ncharacter with general jurisdiction. The vast majority \r\nof Nordic States are among the countries that have \r\naccepted the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction under \r\nArticle 36 of the Statute. That speaks volumes for the \r\nNordic States’ respect for the rule of law and the \r\nimportance we place on the link between justice and \r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes and stability. \r\n The diversity, complexity and growing number of \r\ncases submitted to the Court also demonstrate \r\nincreased confidence in its impartiality and \r\nindependence. The many legal disputes from all over \r\nthe world that are submitted for consideration by the \r\nCourt are the best proof of the Court’s universality and \r\nof the growing willingness of States to resolve their \r\ndisputes by peaceful means. This confirms and \r\nstrengthens trust in the Court and its ability to play its \r\n A/64/PV.30\r\n \r\n7 09-58351 \r\n \r\nrole and to discharge the most urgent and important \r\ntask of the United Nations. \r\n The Nordic States themselves have been parties \r\nto a number of contentious cases before the Court, \r\nthereby also in practice attesting to our belief in a rule-\r\nbased international legal order and our support for the \r\nprinciple of peaceful settlement of disputes by \r\ninternational judicial bodies. \r\n Some of the Nordic States have also contributed \r\nto the Secretary-General’s Trust Fund to Assist States \r\nin the Settlement of Disputes through the International \r\nCourt of Justice in an effort to facilitate a decision by \r\nparties to seek judicial settlement of any dispute \r\nthrough the Court. \r\n Despite the fact that the work of the Court in \r\nrelation to advisory opinions sometimes takes place in \r\ndifficult and somewhat politicized circumstances, the \r\nNordic States have strong confidence in the Court’s \r\ncontinued ability to provide clarification of legal issues \r\nwithout being or being seen to engage in political \r\ncontentions. \r\n The Nordic States appreciate the ongoing efforts \r\nby the Court to increase its efficiency and to manage \r\nits increased workload. We note with great appreciation \r\nthe outreach work that has been done by the Court, \r\nparticularly with regard to the Court’s website, which \r\nserves as a valuable tool for many practitioners of \r\ninternational law. The Court’s ability to modernize and \r\nutilize new platforms of communication is crucial, and \r\nbears witness to its willingness to assist not only the \r\nparties that appear before it, but the broader \r\ninternational legal community. \r\n These efforts by the Court should be reflected by \r\nStates’ readiness to ensure that the Court has sufficient \r\nresources to continue to carry out the tasks entrusted to \r\nit. In this context, we support the wish of the Court to \r\nhave adequate legal support staff and the means \r\nenabling the Court to manage its daily work. \r\n In conclusion, the Nordic States wish to reiterate \r\nour firm belief in the role of the Court as the principal \r\njudicial organ. We express our appreciation to its \r\njudges, who perform their tasks with great \r\nprofessionalism and dedication, and we pledge the \r\nNordic States’ continuing support for the Court’s \r\nendeavour towards justice and the rule of law. \r\n Mr. Davide (Philippines): I am honoured to \r\naddress the General Assembly during its consideration \r\nof the report of the International Court of Justice, the \r\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations (A/64/4).  \r\n My delegation also welcomes this opportunity to \r\ncommend Judge Hisashi Owada, President of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, for his able and \r\ndedicated stewardship of the Court and for the very \r\nlucid and comprehensive report he has just presented. \r\nWe also commend the members of the Court for their \r\ntotal commitment to the Court and its mission. The \r\ncandidate of the Philippines for the Court’s 2009-2018 \r\nterm could have been one of them had she won in the \r\nsecond meeting devoted to the elections for that term \r\n(see A/63/PV.40). \r\n My delegation commends the efforts of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice to increase its efficiency, \r\nincluding the regular re-examination and review of its \r\nproceedings and working methods. We note in \r\nparticular the revisions and additions the Court has \r\nmade to its Practice Directions for States appearing \r\nbefore it, as well as its willingness to periodically \r\nrevisit the first Practice Directions adopted in 2001 and \r\nto conduct meetings devoted to the strategic planning \r\nof its work.  \r\n These efforts have led, inter alia, to four \r\njudgments being handed down during the period under \r\nconsideration and two orders on requests for \r\nprovisional measures, as well as the successful conduct \r\nof hearings on four pending cases. This improved \r\nworking method has enabled the Court to clear its \r\nbacklog of cases, as well as increase the trust and \r\nconfidence of States with cases or disputes before it \r\nand the Court’s capacity to resolve them in a fair, \r\nimpartial and expeditious manner. \r\n My delegation also takes due note of how the \r\nGeneral Assembly has contributed to the Court’s \r\nefforts to streamline and make its working methods \r\nmore efficient by providing much-needed additional \r\nposts in the Court’s Registry. The Philippines reiterates \r\nits call for Member States to continue to provide the \r\nCourt with the means necessary to ensure its proper, \r\neffective and efficient functioning. \r\n My delegation notes with approval the work the \r\nCourt aimed at making its decisions more widely \r\naccessible to the public through the effective use of the \r\nInternet. The value of making the Court’s decisions \r\nmore widely known cannot be stressed enough. It is \r\nessential for promoting transparency and accountability \r\nand, above all, for strengthening respect for the rule of \r\nA/64/PV.30  \r\n \r\n09-58351 8 \r\n \r\nlaw and its effective implementation. Needless to say, \r\nthe effects of these improvements will further enhance \r\nthe independence of the Court, which is indispensable \r\nto maintaining its integrity. \r\n The growing number of treaties negotiated \r\nbetween and among States underlines the growing need \r\nto regulate the complexities of international relations in \r\nan increasingly globalized milieu. It was with this in \r\nmind that Member States resolved in the Millennium \r\nDeclaration to strengthen respect for the rule of law in \r\ninternational and national affairs and to ensure \r\ncompliance with the decisions of the International \r\nCourt of Justice. The complexities of all phases of life \r\nand relationships in an increasingly interdependent \r\nworld, brought closer by the miracles of information \r\nand communications technology, have created a greater \r\nneed for the rule of law. \r\n The cases brought before the International Court \r\nof Justice illustrate that, though territorial disputes still \r\nconstitute a large percentage of its cases, other \r\ncomplex or cutting-edge issues, such as allegations of \r\nmassive human rights violations, the obligation to \r\nprosecute or extradite, and the management of shared \r\nnatural resources — the consequences of global \r\ninterdependence — are also being handled by the \r\nCourt. We are pleased to note in chapter III of the \r\nCourt’s report that, as of 31 July 2009, all 192 Member \r\nStates of the United Nations were parties to the Statute \r\nof the Court and that 66 of them have now made \r\ndeclarations, many with reservations, recognizing the \r\nCourt’s jurisdiction as compulsory. The Philippines is \r\none of them. \r\n The new and emerging subjects of specialization \r\nin international law demand thorough consideration in \r\norder to ensure that rights are not encumbered or \r\nviolated and obligations are carried out and complied \r\nwith. My delegation notes with great interest the report \r\nof Court President Owada on the diversity of issues \r\nbrought before the Court. This shows that the \r\nintricacies of modern international relations have an \r\nimpact on a wide variety of rights, privileges and \r\nobligations heretofore unnoticed in the legal field. \r\n Recent years have witnessed a steady rise in the \r\nnumber of States, entities and even individuals \r\nresorting to specialized tribunals and forums in an \r\nattempt to cope with the increasing demands of \r\ninterdependence. My delegation views this \r\ndevelopment not as a sign of declining confidence in \r\nthe Court’s authority to adjudicate contentious legal \r\nissues, but as evidence of increased confidence in the \r\nrule of law that the Court has helped propagate and \r\ncontinues to advance. In this regard, we count on the \r\nCourt’s function in elucidating norms to provide a \r\nbasic framework of case law and norms, and in \r\nharmonizing jurisprudence in general international law \r\nfor the guidance of these specialized tribunals. \r\n The Philippines reaffirms its support for the work \r\nof the International Court of Justice and the invaluable \r\nrole it plays in promoting an international legal order \r\nfounded on the primacy of the rule of law, peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes and justice. As the principal \r\njudicial organ of the United Nations, the Court is the \r\nprimary institution tasked with ensuring respect for the \r\nrule of law in international relations. \r\n My delegation views the increased workload of \r\nthe Court as a manifestation of the increasing trust and \r\nconfidence of Member States in the Court’s judicial \r\nsupremacy in ensuring the rule of law and its \r\nuniversality and general jurisdiction, and not as an \r\nindication of the inability of States to settle disputes \r\npeacefully. For as long as we have an International \r\nCourt of Justice that is independent, effective, efficient \r\nand worthy of the world’s trust and confidence, for as \r\nlong as it jealously preserves and at all times holds \r\nsupreme the core values of the rule of law, judicial \r\nindependence and the pursuit of excellence, for as long \r\nas it courageously delivers fair, equal, impartial and \r\nswift justice, then we shall have a Court that will truly \r\nbe an instrument of global justice, peace and stability. \r\n Towards this end, and by way of conclusion, my \r\ndelegation, guided by the lessons of the last elections \r\nfor the Court’s 2009-2018 term, wishes to pray and \r\nhope that, first, elections to the Court should be based \r\nstrictly on the criteria established in Article 2 of the \r\nCourt’s Statute, concerning qualifications, and in \r\nArticle 9, on representation on the basis of main forms \r\nof civilizations and principal legal systems. These \r\narticles do not permit election on the basis of regional \r\nrepresentation or a Member State’s category of \r\nmembership in the Security Council. \r\n Secondly, the application or interpretation of \r\nArticle 4 of the Statute must be revisited or \r\nre-examined. The Philippines submits that this article \r\non the election of members of the Court by the General \r\nAssembly and the Security Council does not allow \r\nmembers of the Security Council two votes each — \r\n A/64/PV.30\r\n \r\n9 09-58351 \r\n \r\none to be cast as a member of the General Assembly \r\nand the other as a member of the Security Council. \r\nThat special privilege perpetuates patent and palpable \r\ndiscrimination against Member States that are not \r\nmembers of the Security Council at the time of the \r\nelection. It is a gross and grave violation of the \r\nprinciple of sovereign equality of all Member States \r\nsolemnly enshrined in the Charter of the United \r\nNations. There exists no valid or logical reason for this \r\ndiscrimination; it is undemocratic. This situation might \r\neven produce a greater evil, whereby a mere majority \r\nof the 15 members of the Security Council could \r\ninfluence the final results of the elections in the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n This is an anomaly that should be corrected. It \r\nshould be noted that in the elections for members of \r\nthe Security Council itself, the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil, the Human Rights Council and other bodies in \r\nthe United Nations system, each Member State has \r\nonly one vote, in strict fidelity to and observance of the \r\nprinciple of sovereign equality of Member States. \r\nThirdly, since there are many women jurists who \r\nqualify under Articles 2 and 9 of the Statute, there \r\nshould be gender balance in the Court. \r\n May the foregoing submissions be seriously \r\nconsidered in the next elections of members of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice. The Philippines now \r\nrests its case. \r\n Mr. Badji (Senegal) (spoke in French): I would \r\nlike at the outset to pay tribute to the outgoing \r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice, \r\nDame Rosalyn Higgins, for her exceptional work at the \r\nhead of that body. I would like also to extend my \r\nhearty and warm congratulations to Mr. Hisashi Owada \r\non his election to the presidency of the International \r\nCourt of Justice and to wish him every success in \r\ncarrying out his noble and exalted mission.  \r\n I would also like to extend congratulations to the \r\nentire staff of the Court, and to express my pleasure at \r\ntaking part once again in this annual meeting, which \r\nprovides us with an opportunity to review the report of \r\nthe International Court of Justice (A/64/4). For my \r\ndelegation and many others, this is a timely occasion to \r\nhighlight the constructive work of the Court in \r\npromoting the ideals of peace and justice that are at the \r\nvery basis of the founding of the United Nations. \r\nIndeed, the emergence of a more equitable and \r\npeaceful world depends in particular on promoting \r\nrespect for the rule of law and the pacific settlement of \r\ndisputes. \r\n It goes without saying that the International Court \r\nof Justice, the only judicial body with global \r\njurisdiction and general scope, unquestionably \r\nrepresents the keystone of the international legal order, \r\nand that its daily work promotes justice, the \r\ndevelopment of international law and the maintenance \r\nof peace and security. For those reasons, Senegal \r\nbelieves and trusts in the Court, as clearly manifest in \r\nour recognition of the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction, \r\npursuant to Article 36 of its Statute.  \r\n My delegation welcomes the large number of \r\nrequests brought before the Court, reflecting growing \r\nrecognition of the primacy of the rule of law \r\nthroughout the world and the importance that States \r\naccord to the peaceful settlement of disputes. The \r\nimportance of the Court’s role in settling disputes can \r\nbe seen in the growing confidence that States \r\nincreasingly place in it by submitting their cases to the \r\nwisdom of its judges. By promoting the legal \r\nsettlement of disputes, the Court participates in \r\nestablishing peaceful relations among States and \r\ncontributes significantly to the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security.  \r\n Similarly, by basing its work on the promotion of \r\nthe rule of law, the Court also contributes to ensuring \r\nrespect for the rule of law at the international level. \r\nMoreover, the rulings and decisions handed down by \r\nthe Court, by creating jurisprudence and legal \r\nreasoning in many circumstances, contribute to \r\nenriching, codifying and unifying international law. \r\n For all those reasons, my delegation reiterates its \r\nunfailing support for the Court and welcomes the \r\nlaudable efforts it is making to increase its \r\neffectiveness. Those efforts, which have allowed it to \r\nclear its backlog of cases, merit our support. My \r\ndelegation therefore calls for the Court to be given the \r\nresources necessary to properly fulfilling its noble \r\nmission. \r\n Today’s consideration of the report of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice provides an apt moment \r\nto recall, if need there still be, that the benefits of the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes require no further \r\ndemonstration. The reference in Article 1 of the United \r\nNations Charter to the settlement of disputes “by \r\npeaceful means, and in conformity with the principles \r\nof justice and international law” as an essential goal of \r\nA/64/PV.30  \r\n \r\n09-58351 10 \r\n \r\nthe United Nations and a primary instrument for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security in \r\nitself embodies the importance of that principle. The \r\nUnited Nations therefore has a special responsibility in \r\npromoting the settlement of disputes, including those \r\nof a legal nature and specifically through the medium \r\nof the Court. \r\n My delegation therefore attaches great \r\nimportance to the Secretary-General’s Trust Fund to \r\nAssist States in the Settlement of Disputes through the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, and calls on those States \r\nthat can do so to contribute in a significant and regular \r\nway. \r\n Mr. Tladi (South Africa): I would like to thank \r\nthe President of the International Court of Justice, \r\nJudge Hisashi Owada, for his presentation of the \r\nCourt’s report (A/64/4). I also extend our warmest \r\ncongratulations to him on his assumption of the \r\npresidency of the Court. At the same time, we \r\ncongratulate Judge Rosalyn Higgins for her \r\nstewardship of the Court for the period 2006 to 2009. \r\nWe wish her all the best as she pursues a life beyond \r\nthe bench. \r\n My delegation welcomes the report of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice. In particular, we are \r\npleased to see that States continue to refer disputes to \r\nthe Court. The number of cases currently pending on \r\nthe Court’s docket is a reflection of the confidence that \r\nthey have in the Court. As my delegation has stated in \r\nthe context of the debate on the rule of law in the Sixth \r\nCommittee, given the lack of a compulsory system of \r\nadjudication in international law and the problem of \r\nauto-interpretation, whereby States interpret their \r\nrights and obligations in different and often conflicting \r\nways, regular recourse to international mechanisms for \r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes will go a long way \r\ntowards improving the rule of law at the international \r\nlevel. While many such mechanisms have been \r\nestablished, either on a specialized or regional basis, \r\nmy delegation continues to consider the International \r\nCourt of Justice to be the pre-eminent mechanism for \r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes at the international \r\nlevel. \r\n In this regard, we are particularly pleased that, \r\ndespite the proliferation of international judicial \r\nmechanisms for the settlement of disputes on a \r\nspecialized or regional basis, the International Court of \r\nJustice continues to attract a wide range of cases, \r\ncovering many areas. The list of cases pending before \r\nthe Court includes those pertaining to the protection of \r\nthe environment, such as the case concerning Pulp \r\nMills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v. Uruguay) and \r\nthe case concerning Aerial Herbicide Spraying \r\n(Ecuador v. Colombia). We eagerly anticipate the \r\njudgments of the Court in those two cases with \r\nenvironmental implications, and we hope that they will \r\nbuild on the foundations of the now-famous \r\nGabčíkovo-Nagymaros case between Hungary and \r\nSlovakia.  \r\n There are also a number of cases involving the \r\ndelimitation of boundaries, such as those between \r\nNicaragua and Colombia and between Romania and \r\nUkraine, among many others. The list of current cases \r\nbefore the Court stretches across regions and includes \r\nintraregional disputes, such as that between Georgia \r\nand Russia, and also interregional disputes, such as that \r\nbetween Belgium and Senegal in a matter concerning \r\nthe obligation to extradite or prosecute. \r\n We have also noted with great pleasure that States \r\nno longer limit to issues of little political significance \r\nthe matters with regard to which they consensually \r\nrefer disputes to the Court. Certain Criminal \r\nProceedings in France (Republic of the Congo v. \r\nFrance), in which the jurisdiction of the Court in \r\nrespect of a politically sensitive matter was based on \r\nthe consent of both States without a pre-existing \r\nagreement, is a case in point. The number and quality \r\nof cases being submitted to the Court also reflect the \r\nfact that we have moved on from the days when the \r\nCourt was viewed with suspicion by many States. We \r\nhope that this confidence in the Court will continue to \r\ngrow as we attempt to establish the rule of law as the \r\nbasis for international law. \r\n The importance of the advisory opinions offered \r\nby the International Court of Justice cannot be \r\noverstated in the pursuit of the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes in accordance with the Charter of the United \r\nNations. For that reason, we applaud the fact that the \r\nGeneral Assembly, when faced with particularly \r\ncomplex legal problems, has not been shy about \r\nreferring matters to the Court for an advisory opinion, \r\nmost recently in the matter relating to the accordance \r\nwith international law of the unilateral declaration of \r\nindependence by the Provisional Institutions of Self-\r\nGovernment of Kosovo. In that regard, we recall that, \r\nunder Article 96 of the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nthe Security Council may also request an advisory \r\n A/64/PV.30\r\n \r\n11 09-58351 \r\n \r\nopinion from the Court. In particular, we recall the \r\nimportant effects flowing from the decision of the \r\nCouncil to request an advisory opinion in the matter \r\nrelating to the 1971 Namibia opinion.  \r\n As we encourage recourse to advisory opinions, it \r\nis appropriate to remind delegations that, while \r\nadvisory opinions of the International Court of Justice \r\nare not binding in and of themselves in the sense of \r\nArticle 94 of the Charter of the United Nations, they \r\nare not without legal consequence, and that failure to \r\ncomply with such a decision would be considered a \r\nviolation of whatever rule the Court may have been \r\ndeemed to be at issue in that case. We are thus \r\nparticularly concerned that the recent advisory opinion \r\non the legal consequences of the construction of a wall \r\nin the occupied Palestinian territory continues to be \r\ndisregarded. \r\n A number of disputes on the docket of the Court \r\nare of specific importance not only to the States \r\nconcerned, but to a wider range of States. Those cases \r\ninvolving the use of force, such as the Georgia \r\nv. Russian Federation dispute, to the extent that they \r\nhave an impact on jus cogens norms, are of particular \r\nsignificance. We note with particular appreciation the \r\ninformation provided by the Court that the parties in the \r\ncase concerning Armed Activities on the Territory of the \r\nCongo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Uganda) \r\nare making progress in the implementation of the \r\nCourt’s decision, which was reached in 2005. \r\n Another case on the Court’s list that has \r\nsignificance beyond the parties to the dispute in \r\nquestion is the Certain Criminal Proceedings case \r\nbetween the Congo and France. As with a previous \r\ncase before the Court, concerning the Arrest Warrant of \r\n11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo v. Belgium), this case relates to the question of \r\nuniversal jurisdiction and its application, particularly \r\nwith regard to certain high-ranking Government \r\nofficials. Given that the General Assembly is currently \r\nseized with the question of the scope and application of \r\nuniversal jurisdiction, my delegation keenly awaits the \r\ndecision in that case. We note in particular that, while \r\ndissenting and separate opinions in the Arrest Warrant \r\ncase provided some observations on universal \r\njurisdiction, the judgment of the Court was eerily silent \r\non that issue. We hope that that silence will be broken \r\nin the Certain Criminal Proceedings case.  \r\n My delegation is particularly pleased to hear of \r\nthe frequent visits being made to the Court by national \r\njudges, senior legal officials, researchers and other \r\nmembers of the legal profession. We believe that that \r\ncan only strengthen the understanding of and \r\nappreciation for international law, which is an \r\nimportant tool towards the creation of a rules-based \r\ninternational system. \r\n Mr. Gutiérrez (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): I wish \r\nto thank Judge Hisashi Owada, President of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, for his presence this \r\nafternoon and for his interesting briefing on the work \r\ncarried out by the Court over the past year. \r\n Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations \r\nstipulates that States should settle their disputes by \r\npeaceful means and in conformity with the principles \r\nof justice and international law. That provision \r\nrecognizes the peaceful settlement of disputes as a \r\ngeneral principle of international law whereby States \r\nshould refrain from resorting to the use or threat of \r\nforce.  \r\n The International Court of Justice was established \r\nto give effect to that principle. Its Statute is an integral \r\npart of the Charter of the United Nations. The Court is \r\nthe only international court of a universal character \r\nwith general jurisdiction. Its decisions put an end to the \r\nlegal disputes referred to it by States and contribute to \r\nthe strengthening of international peace. In addition, \r\nthrough its advisory opinions, it assists in the \r\ndevelopment of international law and in ensuring the \r\nrule of law.  \r\n The legal quality of its decisions and its \r\nindependence and impartiality have given the Court \r\nenormous legitimacy. This is demonstrated by the fact \r\nthat, despite the sensitivity of the issues involved in \r\ndisputes, including territorial boundaries, the exercise \r\nof jurisdiction and the immunities regime, States have \r\npreferred to resort to the Court for a final settlement. It \r\nshould also be stressed that the work of the Court \r\ncontributes substantially to the promotion of the rule of \r\nlaw at the international and national levels, as shown \r\nby the exhaustive list included by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his report (A/64/308).  \r\n Peru’s commitment to the work of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice is reflected in the 1948 \r\nAmerican Treaty on Pacific Settlement, or Pact of \r\nBogotá, whereby States parties agree to have recourse \r\nA/64/PV.30  \r\n \r\n09-58351 12 \r\n \r\nat all times to pacific procedures to settle disputes, \r\nincluding recourse to the Court.  \r\n My country, Peru, has also recognized the Court’s \r\njurisdiction as compulsory ipso facto and without \r\nspecial agreement, in accordance with Article 36, \r\nparagraph 2, of the Statute of the Court. Moreover, \r\nthrough the Manila Declaration on the Peaceful \r\nSettlement of International Disputes, adopted by \r\nconsensus through resolution 37/10, it was established \r\nthat legal disputes should as a general rule be referred \r\nby the parties to the International Court of Justice and \r\nthat such recourse should not be considered an \r\nunfriendly act between States. In keeping with that \r\nrecognition, Peru believes that it is of the utmost \r\nimportance that the Court’s jurisdiction be universally \r\naccepted. We call on those States that have not yet \r\ndone so to accept its compulsory jurisdiction with \r\nregard to disputes. \r\n States are obliged to comply with the Court’s \r\ndecisions. That is why Peru, as a State that respects \r\ninternational legality, reaffirms its commitment to \r\nmeeting the obligations arising from the Statute of the \r\nCourt and calls on all other States to comply with the \r\nCourt’s decisions.  \r\n With regard to disputes, the Court has had quite a \r\nheavy agenda over the past year, with the referral of \r\nfour new cases. In addition, in October 2008, the \r\nGeneral Assembly submitted a request for an advisory \r\nopinion. In addition to these new tasks, there are other \r\npending cases, which means that 16 cases and one \r\nadvisory proceeding have been dealt with in the period \r\nunder review. \r\n In reiterating our full support for the work of the \r\nCourt, we must also acknowledge the outstanding work \r\nof its judges. We draw attention to their outstanding \r\nlegal abilities as well as their administrative abilities. \r\nIn this regard, the review of their working methods, in \r\nparticular the revisions to their Practice Directions, \r\nwill enhance their effectiveness.  \r\n Mrs. Gallardo Hernández (El Salvador), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair. \r\n We should also draw attention to the outreach \r\nwork that is taking place, particularly through the \r\nCourt’s website, which is an invaluable tool for gaining \r\naccess to information on the work of the Court. Peru \r\nhopes that, as stated in chapter VII of the report, the \r\nwebsite will soon include audio and video material \r\nfrom hearings.  \r\n States must ensure that the Court has sufficient \r\nresources to carry out the task entrusted to it. In \r\naddition, it should be provided with the administrative \r\nand legal support staff that it requires, as well as the \r\nresources that will allow it to manage the \r\ndocumentation it uses on a daily basis. This will allow \r\nthe Court to promptly settle disputes and issue advisory \r\nopinions, thus benefiting the entire international \r\ncommunity. In this regard, we are of the view that the \r\nrequirements mentioned in the Court’s report and \r\nincluded in the draft budget for the 2010-2011 \r\nbiennium are reasonable, as they are aimed at \r\nmaintaining the promptness and effectiveness of the \r\nwork being carried out by the Court. \r\n Finally, Peru would like to express its recognition \r\nof those who have contributed to the Trust Fund to \r\nAssist States in the Settlement of Disputes through the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, and joins the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s appeal to all States and relevant bodies to \r\ncollaborate with the Fund. \r\n Ms. Negm (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to express Egypt’s appreciation to \r\nMr. Hisashi Owada, President of the International \r\nCourt of Justice, for his useful presentation of the \r\nreport of the Court (A/64/4) on its work over the past \r\nyear, and to reaffirm Egypt’s faith in the key role of the \r\nCourt in ensuring the implementation of the provisions \r\nof international law, adjudicating disputes between \r\nStates and providing advisory opinions to States and \r\ninternational organizations in order to assist them to \r\nbest assume their respective roles. \r\n Since its establishment, the Court has \r\nstrengthened important international legal principles \r\nand rules through its advisory opinions on the legality \r\nof the threat or use of nuclear weapons, the legal \r\nconsequences of the construction of the separation wall \r\nin the occupied Palestinian territory, and other \r\ndecisions and rulings on territorial and maritime border \r\ndisputes. Those advisory opinions have contributed to \r\nthe settlement of several disputes around the world and \r\nto the prevention of their escalation into armed \r\nconflicts. \r\n The delegation of Egypt therefore emphasizes the \r\nneed to strengthen the capacity of States and United \r\nNations organs and specialized agencies to request \r\nadvisory opinions from the Court on important issues, \r\n A/64/PV.30\r\n \r\n13 09-58351 \r\n \r\nas such opinions — given their moral and legal \r\nweight — help to develop and codify the rules of \r\ninternational law and to consolidate the principles of \r\njustice and equality at the international level, to \r\npositive effect on the promotion of international peace \r\nand security.  \r\n Egypt believes that it is important to provide the \r\nCourt with the chance to adjudicate cases concerning \r\nthe encroachment by certain principal organs of the \r\nOrganization on the areas of competence proper to \r\nother, more representative and more democratic \r\nprincipal organs. \r\n In this regard, the implementation of the Court’s \r\ndecisions must be pursued and the international \r\ninteraction with the moral and legal aspects of its \r\nadvisory opinions evaluated. This could be done by \r\nestablishing a mechanism within the United Nations \r\ncharged with evaluating the extent of States’ \r\nimplementation, in good faith and as required under the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, of the advisory opinions \r\nissued by the Court at the request of one of the \r\nprincipal organs. The mechanism would also monitor \r\nthe damage caused by failures in implementation and \r\nadopt measures to compensate affected States, \r\nanalogous to the work of the committee created to \r\nassess the damage caused by the construction of the \r\nseparation wall and to determine the necessary \r\ncompensation, which still faces certain obstacles. \r\n In that context, the delegation of Egypt expresses \r\nits appreciation for the pioneering role played by the \r\nCourt in strengthening the principle of the rule of law, \r\nand stresses the need to draw from the experience of \r\nthe Court in consolidating established legal rules on the \r\nresponsibility of States to protect their citizens, respect \r\nfor international law, diplomatic protection and \r\nconsular relations, and the distinction between \r\nterrorism and legitimate armed struggle in the context \r\nof the right to self-determination. \r\n From this perspective, the Court must study any \r\nabuse of the principle of universal jurisdiction in \r\nviolation of the principle of territoriality of national \r\nlaws. In particular, it should address the fact that some \r\nignore the immunity of heads of State and Government \r\nand Government officials — in particular African \r\nheads of State and senior Government and military \r\nofficials — from criminal prosecution by national \r\ncourts other than those of their home countries. In fact, \r\nan item on that subject has been added to the agenda of \r\nthe Sixth Committee. \r\n On the other hand, the delegation of Egypt \r\naffirms the Court’s vital role in issuing opinions on \r\ncontroversial issues raised by new ideas bruited in the \r\ncorridors of the United Nations, be they concerning \r\nhuman rights, control over natural resources or other \r\nmatters. We must ensure that these ideas will not be \r\nused to interfere in the internal affairs of States in \r\nviolation of the principles of international law and the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. \r\n Consequently, the delegation of Egypt has called \r\nin previous sessions for the Court to present its vision \r\nfor the development of its own legal and judicial role \r\nwithin the framework of the reform of the United \r\nNations so that the Court can perform its tasks in \r\nkeeping with its international standing. In this regard, \r\nwe welcome the reference in the Court’s report to the \r\nobstacles to the technological renovation of the Peace \r\nPalace facilities, the lack of posts for support staff for \r\nthe judges, and the establishment of an efficient \r\ndocumentation division, with the allocation of the \r\nnecessary financial resources for them. \r\n The delegation of Egypt also welcomes the steps \r\ntaken by the Court to increase the effectiveness of its \r\nwork so that it is able to keep pace with the steady \r\nincrease in the number of cases before it. We support \r\nits request for six additional law clerks posts from the \r\nregular budget and the provision of the necessary \r\nresources to effectively create an efficient \r\ndocumentation division by merging the Library and the \r\nArchives Division.  \r\n We also support the Office of the Registrar, the \r\ndevelopment of the Court’s technology to achieve \r\ngreater productivity, and the more effective \r\nmanagement of judges’ pensions in order to keep up \r\nwith changes in the cost of living. Egypt will work \r\nwith other States in the Fifth Committee to respond to \r\nthese requests, especially since they come at a time of \r\nincreasing international efforts to strengthen the United \r\nNations so that it can assume its role in the framework \r\nof international legitimacy and preserve international \r\npublic order on the basis of the principles agreed upon \r\nat its establishment. \r\n In conclusion, the delegation of Egypt commends \r\nall the judges of the Court, as well as its Registrar and \r\nits staff, for their efforts during the year covered by the \r\nA/64/PV.30  \r\n \r\n09-58351 14 \r\n \r\nreport, and wishes them every success as they carry out \r\ntheir roles and the tasks of the Court. \r\n Ms. Hong (Singapore): My delegation thanks the \r\nInternational Court of Justice for its detailed report on \r\nthe work of the Court from 1 August 2008 until 31 July \r\n2009 (A/64/4). We salute the Court for having \r\nsuccessfully completed a busy and productive year. We \r\nshould also like to extend our warm congratulations to \r\nJudge Hisashi Owada on his election as President of \r\nthat body. We have confidence that, under his able \r\nstewardship, the Court will continue to fulfil its \r\nmandate with competence and distinction. \r\n Singapore attaches great importance to the rule of \r\nlaw, both domestic and international. We have \r\nconsistently joined in international efforts to promote \r\nand strengthen the rule of law at the multilateral and \r\nregional levels to the best of our abilities. In the same \r\nvein, Singapore subscribes to pacific means of settling \r\ninternational disputes. We firmly believe that where \r\ninter-State disputes, in particular long-standing \r\ndisputes, cannot be resolved through a consensual \r\nprocess such as negotiation or mediation, States, and \r\nindeed the international community, will stand to gain \r\nby having recourse to a neutral third-party process to \r\nsettle their differences. \r\n The Court plays a crucial role in this regard by \r\nproviding an effective and objective mechanism for \r\nStates to adjudicate their disputes on the basis of \r\ninternational law. The importance of its role in \r\nresolving disputes and thereby preserving world peace \r\ncannot be overemphasized. \r\n My delegation notes that there are numerous \r\nspecialized courts and tribunals on the international \r\nscene. While there is no formal hierarchy of courts or \r\ntribunals in international law, as the report of the Court \r\nnotes, the International Court of Justice is the only \r\ninternational court of a universal character with general \r\njurisdiction and is the principal judicial organ of the \r\nUnited Nations. The Court thus occupies a special \r\nposition in upholding and promoting the rule of law. \r\nSingapore has been and will continue to be supportive \r\nof the Court. \r\n The Court delivered its judgment in the case \r\nconcerning Sovereignty over Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu \r\nPuteh, Middle Rocks and South Ledge (Malaysia/ \r\nSingapore) last year. In the course of this year, the \r\nCourt has already delivered two important decisions \r\nrelating to shared bodies of water between States, \r\nnamely, that in the cases concerning Maritime \r\nDelimitation in the Black Sea (Romania v. Ukraine) \r\nand Dispute regarding Navigational and Related \r\nRights (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua). Given the fact that \r\nmany States have, to a greater or lesser extent, seas or \r\nrivers which they share with neighbouring States, the \r\nCourt’s judgments represent a very relevant and \r\nvaluable articulation of legal principles that will guide \r\nthese States in the conduct of their relations with their \r\nneighbours. \r\n In October 2008, Singapore voted in favour of \r\nresolution 63/3 requesting an advisory opinion of the \r\nCourt on whether the unilateral declaration of \r\nindependence of Kosovo was in accordance with \r\ninternational law. We stated at that time that, in such a \r\nhighly complex situation, there was value in clarifying \r\nthe interpretation and application of international law, \r\nand that the Court was an appropriate international \r\nbody to do so. \r\n Moving on to the operation of the Court, my \r\ndelegation notes that the Court has taken steps to \r\nenhance its efficiency by reviewing and revising its \r\nPractice Directions, as well as by instituting regular \r\nmeetings on strategic planning. The report also states \r\nthat the Court has managed to clear its backlog of cases \r\nby setting itself a particularly demanding schedule of \r\nhearings and deliberations. Consequently, parties can \r\nnow be confident that as soon as the documentary \r\nfilings and exchanges are completed, the Court will be \r\nable to move to oral proceedings in a timely manner. \r\nThis is indicative of the level of commitment and \r\nprofessionalism with which the Court and the judges \r\nare discharging their functions. My delegation wishes \r\nto express our appreciation for their dedicated service \r\nto the international community. \r\n My delegation also notes with some concern that, \r\nonce again, the Court has pointed out in its report that \r\nits request for more manpower has not been fully met \r\nby the General Assembly. We also note that the Court \r\nhas reiterated its request for funds to install up-to-date \r\ninformation technology on the judges’ bench and on \r\nthe tables occupied by the parties to cases, facilities \r\nwhich have been adopted by other international \r\ntribunals in recent years and which the Court is still \r\nwithout. The Court is the principal judicial organ of the \r\nUnited Nations system and has discharged its functions \r\nresponsibly. It should enjoy the full support of Member \r\nStates. It is thus vital that Member States demonstrate \r\ntheir support by ensuring that the Court be given \r\n A/64/PV.30\r\n \r\n15 09-58351 \r\n \r\nadequate resources to discharge its role effectively and \r\nefficiently. \r\n In conclusion, Singapore has and will continue to \r\nplace great emphasis on the rule of law. My delegation \r\nwill continue to support the work of the Court and to \r\nmonitor with great interest every decision of the Court. \r\nWe wish the Court every success in the coming year. \r\n Mr. Repetto (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): At the \r\noutset, I should like to express my thanks to the \r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice, Judge \r\nHisashi Owada, for his detailed presentation of the \r\nCourt’s report on the period from 1 August 2008 to \r\n31 July 2009 (A/64/4).  \r\n My country recognizes the important work \r\nundertaken by the International Court of Justice as the \r\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations and its \r\nrole under the Charter in the peaceful resolution of \r\ndisputes and advisory matters. My country believes \r\nthat its work makes an ongoing contribution to the \r\nconstruction and strengthening of a multilateral system \r\nthat promotes an international legal order based on \r\nrespect for the rule of law, which contributes to the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. \r\n As an expression of my Government’s \r\nrecognition of the important functions of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, Chile has accepted the \r\njurisdiction of the Court to resolve all disputes relating \r\nto the interpretation and application of the many \r\nmultilateral treaties to which it is party. We also \r\nbelieve that the advisory role of the International Court \r\nof Justice is of particular relevance, as demonstrated by \r\nits many opinions on various spheres of international \r\nlaw. Our country shares the view that the Court should \r\nbe granted the necessary means and material and \r\nhuman resources to effectively undertake its growing \r\nworkload. \r\n We should also like to commend the efforts of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice to publicize its work \r\nthrough modern methods that are broad and accessible \r\nto the international public. International law is \r\nstrengthened by such efforts, and we express our firm \r\nsupport for continued funding to the Court to ensure \r\nthat it has sufficient resources for administration and so \r\nthat it can continue publicizing its work effectively \r\nboth through its yearbook and by electronic means. My \r\ncountry also appeals to the International Court of \r\nJustice to issue Spanish-language versions of its \r\njudgments. \r\n In relation to the case before the International \r\nCourt of Justice to which Chile has been summoned, \r\nmy Government affirms that it will set out its position \r\non that topic before the Court at the appropriate time. \r\n Let me conclude by reiterating our appreciation \r\nfor the work of the Court and its invaluable \r\ncontribution to the development of and compliance \r\nwith international law. \r\n Mr. Muita (Kenya): I would like at the outset to \r\njoin previous speakers in commending you, Madam \r\nVice-President, for the excellent manner in which you \r\nare guiding our deliberations. \r\n I would also like to take this opportunity to thank \r\nJudge Rosalyn Higgins for her successful tenure and to \r\ncongratulate Judge Hisashi Owada on his election as \r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice and for \r\nhis very comprehensive report. I wish to reiterate \r\nKenya’s support. \r\n Kenya has consistently supported the \r\nInternational Court of Justice and its international \r\nadjudication mechanisms. We highly value the Court’s \r\ncontribution to the development of international law \r\nand its important work in the judicial settlement of \r\ninternational disputes. The high number and scope of \r\ncases submitted to the Court for judicial settlement, \r\nhighlighted in the report, and the number of parties that \r\nhave submitted cases are testimony of the Court’s \r\nuniversality as the main judicial organ of the United \r\nNations. We therefore urge Member States to actively \r\nutilize the Court for settling any emerging international \r\ndisputes. \r\n The steps the Court has taken to expedite the \r\nglobal administration of justice are encouraging. The \r\ndetermination of cases by summary procedure at the \r\nrequest of parties and the ongoing review of the \r\nCourt’s procedures and working methods are all \r\npositive developments. \r\n My delegation welcomes the presentations of the \r\nCourt’s Registrar and the Information Department on \r\nthe activities of the Court to a broad-based audience. \r\nEqually significant is the work of the Publication \r\nDivision in disseminating the Court’s decisions and \r\nother documents. We believe all those efforts will \r\ncontribute immensely to creating greater awareness of \r\nthe work of the Court. \r\n As we are all aware, in this century the \r\nInternational Court of Justice is facing new and \r\nA/64/PV.30  \r\n \r\n09-58351 16 \r\n \r\nchallenging developments that are emerging from areas \r\nwhich have previously not been of concern to \r\ninternational jurisdiction. That change has been \r\nbrought on by increasing global interdependence. \r\nHowever, considering the number of years it has taken \r\nus to reach our current position, and taking into \r\naccount the fact that the development of international \r\nlaw is by nature a process, Kenya is confident that the \r\nCourt and parties will be able to address the issue of \r\nthe role of national jurisdiction in the context of the \r\nimplementation of international norms. \r\n Finally, my delegation urges all parties to engage \r\npositively in the law-making process in international \r\nlaw. It is only by doing so that all our voices can be \r\nheard, thereby ensuring the legitimacy and universality \r\nof international law and institutions. It is important that \r\nwe support and utilize the adjudication mechanisms of \r\nthe International Court of Justice. \r\n Mr. Sher Bahadur Khan (Pakistan): I wish to \r\nthank Judge Owada, President of the International \r\nCourt of Justice, for his excellent report on the work of \r\nthe Court over the past year. \r\n The ever increasing globalization and \r\ninterdependence of our societies constantly remind us \r\nthat justice and the rule of law are keys to an orderly \r\ninternational society. They are critical to the realization \r\nof all human rights and the noble aspirations of peace, \r\nsovereign equality of States and justice. The \r\nInternational Court of Justice, being the principal \r\njudicial organ of the United Nations, provides the best \r\nplatform to Member States and the United Nations \r\norgans for this endeavour. \r\n According to the latest report of the Court \r\n(A/64/4), 192 States are party to its Statute, but only \r\n66 States have accepted compulsory jurisdiction of the \r\nCourt. Pakistan is one of those 66 countries. \r\n The United Nations Charter recognizes that \r\nsettlement of international disputes by peaceful means \r\nand in conformity with the principle of justice and \r\ninternational law is one of the basic purposes of the \r\nUnited Nations. Under Chapter VI, the Charter offers \r\nvast possibilities for the United Nations and its organs \r\nto play an important role in the pacific settlement of \r\ndisputes and in conflict prevention. \r\n Article 36 of the Charter gives the role of the \r\nCourt in the settlement of disputes. The Court’s \r\nadvisory opinions and jurisdiction, in accordance with \r\nChapter IV of its Statute, covers consultations by the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council on legal \r\nquestions arising within the scope of their activities. In \r\naddition, some 300 bilateral or multilateral treaties \r\nprovide for the Court to have jurisdiction in the \r\nresolution of disputes arising from their application \r\nand interpretation. States may also submit a specific \r\ndispute to the Court by way of special agreement. The \r\nCourt also enjoys jurisdiction in forum prorogatum \r\nsituations.  \r\n Yet these possibilities remain grossly under-\r\nutilized. We strongly believe that better utilization of \r\nthe Court for the peaceful settlement of disputes and \r\nconflict prevention can serve as the basis for long-term \r\npeaceful coexistence in the international community.  \r\n The Court plays a valuable role in its handling of \r\ncases related to its primary jurisdiction. We are happy \r\nto note that the number of cases decided by the Court \r\nin the last few years has substantially increased, due to \r\nthe efficient handling of the cases brought before it. \r\nHowever, problems come from States that are reluctant \r\nto accept the Court’s jurisdiction in dispute settlement \r\ndue to political considerations. We hope that with time \r\neven those reluctant today will accept the Court’s \r\njurisdiction for the peaceful settlement for disputes and \r\nconflict prevention.  \r\n In cases of non-compliance with the judgment of \r\nthe Court, Article 94, paragraph 2, of the Charter sets \r\nout a procedure to address such situations. The \r\nSecretary-General, through his good offices and upon \r\nrequest of the party or parties concerned, should play \r\nan ever more active role in facilitating and securing the \r\ndue implementation of the judgments.  \r\n We have noted with appreciation that the Court \r\nhas been regularly and systematically re-examining its \r\nongoing proceedings and working methods. The \r\nCourt’s efforts to enhance its productivity, especially \r\nthrough regular meetings devoted to strategic planning \r\nof its work, deserve our appreciation. We also note that \r\nthe Court has set for itself a particularly demanding \r\nschedule of hearings and deliberations and has cleared \r\nits case backlog. We appreciate the Court’s assurance \r\nto Member States that oral proceedings on cases can \r\nnow be started in a timely manner, immediately after \r\nthe completion of the written exchanges. \r\n We believe that the Court should have at its \r\ndisposal all the resources necessary to perform the \r\ntasks assigned to it. The General Assembly should \r\n A/64/PV.30\r\n \r\n17 09-58351 \r\n \r\nprovide the Court with the resources needed to perform \r\nits work effectively and efficiently. We hope that the \r\nAssembly will give positive consideration to the \r\nCourt’s request, in its budget submission for the 2010-\r\n2011 biennium, for a new post of Special Assistant to \r\nthe Registrar. \r\n The International Court of Justice has an \r\nimportant role in defining and implementing justice \r\nand the rule of law at the international level. The \r\nprinciples of peaceful coexistence and respect for basic \r\nhuman rights can be ensured only through respect for \r\njustice and the rule of law. However, those noble \r\naspirations could be achieved only by mutually \r\nsupportive and consistent efforts of Member States, the \r\nGeneral Assembly, the Security Council and the Court \r\nitself. \r\n Mr. Soares (Portugal): Let me begin by \r\nexpressing Portugal’s gratitude to the President of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, Judge Owada, for the \r\nthorough report on the Court’s work over the period \r\nunder review. I would also like to take this opportunity \r\nto congratulate him on his election as President of the \r\nCourt. \r\n The International Court of Justice is the only \r\ninternational court of a universal character with general \r\njurisdiction. The Court holds important responsibilities \r\nin the international community. Also, it plays a \r\nfundamental role in the judicial settlement of disputes \r\nbetween States as well as in the strengthening of the \r\ninternational rule of law. Furthermore, that enables it to \r\nplay another very particular role, which is to help to \r\navoid that disputes between States erupt into violence. \r\n The Court has a crucial function in the \r\ninternational legal system that is being more and more \r\nrecognized and accepted. By 31 July 2009, all of the \r\nStates Members of the United Nations were parties to \r\nthe Statute of the Court and 66 out of these States had \r\nrecognized its jurisdiction as compulsory. Moreover, \r\napproximately 300 bilateral and multilateral treaties \r\nprovide for the Court to have jurisdiction over the \r\nresolution of disputes arising out of their application or \r\ninterpretation. The heavy workload of the Court \r\nconfirms its success. \r\n It is worth highlighting that the Court’s cases \r\ncome from all over the world, relate to a great variety \r\nof matters and have a high degree of factual and legal \r\ncomplexity. That confirms not only the universality of \r\nthe Court but also the expansion of the scope of its \r\nwork and its growing specialization. \r\n The Court’s efforts to cope with the very \r\ndemanding level of activity have been impressive. \r\nHowever, it is also important for the Member States to \r\nacknowledge the Court’s need for adequate resources. \r\n The Court recalls in its report (A/64/4) that \r\neverything it does is aimed at promoting the rule of \r\nlaw. That is indeed so. It is worth mentioning the \r\nCourt’s outstanding contribution to the development of \r\ninternational law. \r\n In that context, it is also worth stressing that \r\nalthough the International Court of Justice is a main \r\nplayer in the international jurisdictional field, there are \r\nother international courts and tribunals whose \r\nsignificance should be emphasized. Portugal strongly \r\nbelieves that, in order to enhance the international legal \r\norder, all of those courts and tribunals must cooperate \r\nand consequently face together the challenges posed by \r\nthe fragmentation of international law and the \r\nproliferation of international courts and tribunals. \r\n Although we recognize that there is a certain \r\ntension between law and power, between the obligation \r\nof States to settle their disputes in a peaceful manner \r\nand the need of sovereign consent to resort to such \r\nmechanisms, it is our firm belief that the Court is an \r\ninstitutional pillar of the international community. In \r\nthat sense, Portugal would like to encourage all States \r\nthat have not yet done so to consider accepting the \r\nCourt’s compulsory jurisdiction. \r\n Portugal is confident that the Court will continue \r\nto overcome the challenges that will increasingly press \r\nupon it. Those challenges are a good sign. They mean \r\nthat States have confidence that the Court will \r\ncontribute to the settlement of their disputes and to the \r\nstrengthening of the international rule of law for the \r\nbenefit of justice and peace. \r\n Mr. Hussain (India): Thank you, Madam \r\nPresident, for giving me the opportunity to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly on the report of the International \r\nCourt of Justice (A/64/4), one of the principal organs \r\nof the United Nations. At the outset, I would like to \r\nthank the President of the International Court of Justice \r\nfor his detailed presentation of the report. \r\n The International Court of Justice is the principal \r\njudicial organ of the United Nations. Along with the \r\nother organs of the United Nations, it was established \r\nA/64/PV.30  \r\n \r\n09-58351 18 \r\n \r\nto save future generations from the devastating effects \r\nof war and to find means of settling inter-State disputes \r\nthrough application of international law. \r\n The Court remains the only judicial body \r\nderiving its legitimacy from the Charter and enjoys \r\ngeneral jurisdiction. All other international judicial \r\ninstitutions have specific competences and lack general \r\njurisdiction of a universal nature. Through Article 92 of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations, the Statute of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice was made an integral part \r\nof the Charter. That is a status unique to the Court, not \r\nenjoyed by any other international court or tribunal \r\nestablished to date. \r\n All States are free to approach the Court for the \r\nresolution of their disputes with other States. Under \r\nArticle 36 of the Charter, the Security Council may \r\nalso recommend to parties that they refer their legal \r\ndisputes to the International Court of Justice, while the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council may seek \r\nadvisory opinions from the Court. Those provisions \r\nclearly indicate the central role given to the Court \r\nwithin the United Nations system. \r\n The judgments of the Court have played an \r\nimportant role in the progressive development and \r\ncodification of international law. Though cautious, out \r\nof respect for political realities, sentiments of States \r\nand its own Statute, the Court has asserted its judicial \r\nfunctions. The Court has clearly emphasized the role of \r\ninternational law in regulating inter-State relations \r\neven though such relations are necessarily political in \r\nnature. \r\n India continues to believe that no other judicial \r\norgan in the world can have the same capacity for \r\ndealing with international problems as the International \r\nCourt of Justice. The Court has contributed \r\nsignificantly towards settling legal disputes between \r\nsovereign States, thus promoting the rule of law in \r\ninternational relations. \r\n Since its inception, the Court has dealt with a \r\nvariety of legal issues. It has pronounced judgments in \r\nareas including sovereignty over islands, navigational \r\nrights of States, nationality, asylum, expropriation, law \r\nof the sea, land and maritime boundaries, the principle \r\nof good faith and equity and legitimacy of the use of \r\nforce. Those judgments have played an important role \r\nin the progressive development and codification of \r\ninternational law. \r\n At present, there are five cases between European \r\nStates before the Court, four between Latin American \r\nStates and two between African States. The subject \r\nmatter of those cases includes territorial and maritime \r\ndelimitation, environmental concerns, jurisdictional \r\nimmunities of the State, violation of territorial \r\nintegrity, racial discrimination and human rights \r\nviolations. This list reflects the increased relevance of \r\nand respect for due process of law that States are \r\nshowing and is an affirmation of faith in the Court. \r\n The growing acceptance by States of the Court’s \r\njurisdiction further highlights the Court’s importance \r\nand States’ confidence in the Court’s ability to resolve \r\ntheir disputes. This has caused the workload of the \r\nCourt to increase many times over. As of 31 July 2009, \r\nthere were 13 contentious cases and 1 advisory \r\nprocedure pending before the Court. \r\n In order for the Court to respond effectively to \r\nthe increasing demands on its resources and carry out \r\nits mandate efficiently, it is necessary that the Court be \r\nprovided with adequate resources. The ability of the \r\nCourt to effectively discharge its functions is also \r\ncritical for the credibility of the United Nations system \r\nas a whole. \r\n Mr. Mohamad (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): It is \r\nour pleasure to congratulate the International Court of \r\nJustice (ICJ), which is and has been a solid citadel of \r\njustice. It is entrusted with protecting international law \r\nand embodies the application of the principles of the \r\nrule of law in lieu of violence and the use of force in \r\ninternational relations. We are delighted to express our \r\ndeep appreciation to Judge Hisashi Owada, President \r\nof the Court, for his comprehensive report (A/64/4) on \r\nthe activities of the ICJ and the Court’s achievements \r\nin fulfilment of its mandate. We also wish to commend \r\nthe tremendous efforts and contributions made by \r\nDame Rosalyn Higgins during her term of office as \r\nPresident of the Court. \r\n The report before us testifies anew to the growing \r\nrole of the ICJ in shouldering its responsibilities as the \r\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations and the \r\nonly court of universal character with general \r\njurisdiction. It represents the most vital and capable \r\norgan for implementing the Charter tenet of the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes based on principles of \r\njustice and international law. The Court is thus an \r\nessential tool for maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity. \r\n A/64/PV.30\r\n \r\n19 09-58351 \r\n \r\n The increasing acceptance by Member States of \r\nthe Court’s compulsory jurisdiction proves the degree \r\nof confidence that the international community has in \r\nthe ability of the Court to carry out its mandate in \r\nsettling disputes within the context of the rules of \r\ninternational law. One positive indicator is the growing \r\nnumber of cases before it, which strengthens \r\nconfidence in the Court and its ability to fulfil the most \r\ncompelling and important function of the United \r\nNations: the peaceful settlement of disputes.  \r\n The 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution \r\n60/1) acknowledged the growing challenges that are \r\nfacing the international community today and the \r\nurgent need to enhance the capacity of the United \r\nNations to face those challenges effectively and \r\nefficiently. Since the Court is a principal organ of the \r\nOrganization and is thus facing challenges similar to \r\nthose faced by the United Nations as a whole, it is \r\nnecessary to support and enhance the capacities of the \r\nCourt. The first step in that direction is to accept the \r\njurisdiction of the Court. In order for the Court to \r\noptimally fulfil its mandate, it is only logical to accept \r\nits jurisdiction, because justice is indivisible and \r\ncannot be compromised. \r\n In this respect, we recall the legal opinions issued \r\nby the Court, in particular the opinion on the illegal \r\nconstruction of the separation wall in the Palestinian \r\nterritory, whose non-implementation constitutes a \r\nchallenge to the will of the international community \r\nand to international justice. The ICJ should protect the \r\nestablished rules of international law and agreements.  \r\n As regards the immunity of heads of State or \r\nGovernment and government officials, which is a \r\nprinciple that has been repeatedly affirmed by opinions \r\nof the Court, it is our hope that the ICJ will play the \r\nrole it is called upon to play with respect to so-called \r\nuniversal jurisdiction and to the targeting of African \r\npersonalities. That is an issue that Africa has rejected \r\nat the level of its summit of heads of State and \r\nGovernment. If we do not face this kind of piracy, the \r\ndoor will be wide open to the law of the jungle, with \r\nall its attendant threats to international peace and \r\nsecurity. It is also incumbent on the ICJ to provide an \r\nantidote to attempts by States to hold other States to \r\nthe terms of treaties of which they are not signatories \r\nor members.  \r\n The support of States for the work of the Court \r\nwill not be complete unless we acknowledge the \r\nobstacles it is facing and offer recommendations by \r\nwhich Member States can remove them. My delegation \r\nstresses the importance of continuing to provide \r\nvoluntary support for the Secretary-General’s Trust \r\nFund to Assist States in the Settlement of Disputes \r\nthrough the International Court of Justice to enable the \r\nFund to meet the cost of settling disputes peacefully, \r\nespecially in poor countries.  \r\n My delegation commends the efforts of the Court \r\nin disseminating its documents to Member States as \r\nwidely as possible, especially through its website, \r\nwhich enables us to follow the rulings of the Court in a \r\nmanner that helps harmonize international law. We \r\nencourage the Court to work to strengthen its relations \r\nwith other legal entities at the international, regional \r\nand national levels in order to raise awareness of its \r\nrole and publicize its activities. \r\n In conclusion, my delegation reiterates its faith in \r\nthe great role played by the ICJ and its commitment to \r\nsupport the Court in a manner that will enable it to \r\nperform its functions at the highest possible level. \r\n Mr. Okuda (Japan): My delegation would like to \r\nexpress its gratitude to Court President Hisashi Owada \r\nfor his in-depth report summarizing the current \r\nsituation of the International Court of Justice and \r\nexpress its appreciation and support for the \r\nachievements in the work of the Court during the past \r\nyear. The devoted work and profound legal wisdom of \r\nthe Court in seeking peaceful settlements of disputes \r\nhave earned the respect and support of Member States \r\nof the United Nations. We welcome the fact that \r\nMember States, in principle, are attempting to resolve \r\ndisputes through international law by referring cases to \r\nthe Court. Japan sincerely hopes that, through the work \r\nof the Court, the rule of law will take firm root in the \r\ninternational community. \r\n The cases on which the Court recently rendered \r\nits final judgments include a dispute concerning \r\nmaritime delimitation. Cases which have been referred \r\nto the Court recently cover a range of important \r\nquestions on international law, such as the \r\njurisdictional immunity of a State from a foreign court \r\nand the obligation to prosecute or extradite. In \r\naddition, the General Assembly requested the Court in \r\nOctober 2008 to deliver an advisory opinion on the \r\nquestion of the accordance with international law of \r\nthe unilateral declaration of independence by the \r\nProvisional Institutions of Self-Government of Kosovo, \r\nA/64/PV.30  \r\n \r\n09-58351 20 \r\n \r\non which Japan submitted its written statement to the \r\nCourt in April this year. Thus, the Court is playing an \r\neven more significant role in resolving international \r\ndisputes between States and providing its opinion on \r\nimportant questions of international law. \r\n In the present international environment, where \r\nwe continue to witness armed conflicts and acts of \r\nterrorism, the firm establishment of law and order is \r\ntruly indispensable. Indeed, there has been increasing \r\nrecognition in the international community of the need \r\nto establish and maintain the primacy of international \r\nlaw as well as the importance of settling disputes \r\nthrough peaceful means. In this regard, the role of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, as the principal judicial \r\norgan of the United Nations, is paramount and cannot \r\nbe overstated. \r\n As a nation resolutely devoted to peace and \r\nfirmly dedicated to promotion of the rule of law and \r\nrespect for the principle of the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes, Japan appreciates the strenuous efforts and \r\nintensive work of the Court over the past year in \r\ndelivering decisions based on exhaustive deliberation. \r\nWe believe that the Court must bring to bear not only a \r\nprofound knowledge of international law but also a far-\r\nsighted view of the international community, given that \r\nthe world is now experiencing such rapid change and \r\nthat a variety of international disputes continue to \r\narise. Japan respects the Court’s ability to meet these \r\nrequirements and continues to fully support its work.  \r\n Japan accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the \r\nCourt in 1958, immediately following its accession as a \r\nMember State of the United Nations. We urge those \r\nStates that have not yet done so to accept the \r\ncompulsory jurisdiction of the Court in order to \r\nfacilitate the establishment of the rule of law \r\nthroughout the international community. \r\n In conclusion, I reaffirm the great importance the \r\ninternational community attaches to the lofty cause and \r\nwork of the International Court of Justice. Japan, for its \r\npart, will continue to contribute to the invaluable work \r\nof the Court. \r\n Mr. Aguiar Patriota (Brazil): Let me begin by \r\nthanking the President of the International Court of \r\nJustice, Judge Hisashi Owada, for his comprehensive \r\nreport on the work of the Court. I also take this \r\nopportunity to commend the judges of the Court for \r\ntheir outstanding contributions to an effective and \r\nimpartial application of international law. \r\n In the Preamble to the United Nations Charter, all \r\nMember States made a clear commitment “to establish \r\nconditions under which justice and respect for the \r\nobligations arising from treaties and other sources of \r\ninternational law can be maintained”. Furthermore, \r\nnumerous other provisions of the Charter make specific \r\nreferences to the importance of upholding the \r\nprinciples and norms of international law and ensuring \r\na peaceful settlement of disputes. In fact, one of the \r\nmain purposes of the United Nations, under the \r\nCharter, is  \r\n “to bring about by peaceful means, and in \r\nconformity with the principles of justice and \r\ninternational law, adjustment or settlement of \r\ninternational disputes or situations which might \r\nlead to a breach of the peace”.  \r\n The International Court of Justice is a key \r\nelement in the efforts to achieve those goals. By \r\nresolving international disputes and issuing advisory \r\nopinions, the Court not only strengthens the rule of law \r\non a global scale, enhancing predictability and stability \r\nin international relations, but also contributes to the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. \r\n As the only international court of a universal \r\ncharacter with general jurisdiction, the International \r\nCourt of Justice has been addressing cases whose \r\nsubject matter touches upon a wide range of sensitive \r\nissues, such as territorial and maritime delimitation, \r\nenvironmental concerns, jurisdictional immunities of \r\nthe State, violation of territorial integrity, racial \r\ndiscrimination and human rights violations. \r\n According to the report of the Court (A/64/4), \r\nfour new cases and one request for an advisory opinion \r\nwere referred to the Court over the past year. The \r\nnumber of contentious cases on the docket remains \r\nhigh, standing at 13 at the moment. It is worth noting \r\nthat the contentious cases came from various parts of \r\nthe world, signalling the universal character of the \r\nCourt and its wide acceptance. \r\n The varied list of matters and the large number of \r\ncases submitted by Member States to the Court are \r\nliving proof of the trust placed by the international \r\ncommunity upon the principal judicial organ of the \r\nUnited Nations. In order to maintain confidence in the \r\nCourt, States that are parties to any case need to \r\ncomply with the respective decision reached by that \r\norgan, in accordance with the Charter. \r\n A/64/PV.30\r\n \r\n21 09-58351 \r\n \r\n My delegation welcomes the efforts made by the \r\nCourt to increase its efficiency and thereby cope with \r\nthe steady increase in workload. We note that the cases \r\nreferred to the Court reflect increasing factual and \r\nlegal complexity. The Court’s processes comprise \r\nseveral phases which may include preliminary \r\nobjections or requests for the indication of provisional \r\nmeasures. However, justice needs to be served speedily \r\nin order to provide the best outcome. \r\n In its budget submission for 2010-2011, the Court \r\nhas reiterated its request for the creation of the six law \r\nclerk posts with a view to enabling each member of the \r\nCourt to benefit from personalized legal support and \r\nthus to devote more time to reflection and deliberation. \r\nThe Brazilian delegation is of the view that this request \r\nshould be granted so that every judge may have the \r\nnecessary assistance for his or her research. \r\n To conclude, allow me to reiterate the firm \r\nsupport of my delegation to the work undertaken by the \r\nCourt and its significant contribution to the \r\nstrengthening of the rule of law in international affairs. \r\nWe believe the Court continues to play a key role in the \r\nfulfilment of the purposes enshrined in the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations and will continue to be needed \r\nwhile the world becomes more integrated and \r\ninterconnected. \r\n Mr. Mukongo Ngay (Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo) (spoke in French): My delegation has taken \r\nnote of the report submitted to the General Assembly \r\nby the International Court of Justice in document \r\nA/64/4. We note that during the period concerned, the \r\nCourt had 16 contentious cases and one advisory \r\nproceeding, which represents an increase over the \r\nprevious period. \r\n My delegation attaches great importance to the \r\nwork of the International Court of Justice, recognizing \r\nthe role the Court has to play as a principal organ of \r\nthe United Nations to, in the words on the Charter, \r\n“bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity \r\nwith the principles of justice and international law, \r\nadjustment or settlement of international disputes or \r\nsituations which might lead to a breach of the peace”. \r\n My country appreciates the remarkable role that \r\nthe Court is currently playing in promoting the rule of \r\nlaw and we encourage it to continue its efforts in that \r\ndirection. Here we must commend the skill with which \r\nthe Court has conducted its deliberations on the \r\nquestions brought before it in recent years. It has not \r\nonly managed an increasingly heavy load of \r\ncontentious cases, but has asserted itself as the \r\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations \r\nresponsible for settling, in accordance with \r\ninternational law, disputes of a legal nature brought \r\nbefore it by Member States. Holding to the letter of the \r\nlaw, the Court has also affirmed its independence with \r\nrespect to the Security Council, the political organ of \r\nthe United Nations, as was seen in its judgment of \r\n24  May 1980 in the case concerning United States \r\nDiplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran, following the \r\nevents of 4 November 1979. \r\n Turning to the question of resorting to the use of \r\nforce against the territorial integrity or political \r\nindependence of any State, or in any other manner \r\ninconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations, \r\nto which Article 2, paragraph 4, of the Charter refers, I \r\nshould like to refer to the case of Armed Activities on \r\nthe Territory of the Congo, settled by the Judgment of \r\n19 December 2005 and referred to in paragraphs 110 to \r\n113 of the report of the International Court of Justice. \r\nAs stressed by the eminent Congolese legal expert \r\nProfessor Sayeman Bula-Bula, this case is even more \r\nsignificant than the Corfu Channel case of 1949, the \r\nNicaragua case of 1986 and the oil platforms case of \r\n2003. Of course, the findings of the Court could have \r\nbeen expressed more clearly in the Court’s judgment, \r\nas some have observed; nevertheless, the contents \r\nremain no less safely enshrined, regardless of the \r\nparticular wording. In this regard, it is important that \r\nwe read the judgment in its entirety with great care, \r\nespecially its paragraphs 153, 304 and 345. \r\n With respect to this topic, the President of the \r\nCourt notes in his report the progress in the \r\nnegotiations being held by the parties to settle the issue \r\nof reparations. It has to be said that my delegation \r\nhopes that, based on the friendly relations and \r\ncooperation being established between the two \r\nformerly belligerent parties, a fair, prompt and \r\nequitable solution to this issue of reparations will be \r\nfound through the means set out in the Judgment of \r\n19 December 2005. \r\n The Democratic Republic of the Congo has made \r\na valuable contribution to the development of \r\ninternational law and to what is now being called the \r\nreturn to international law. Ours has been a significant \r\ncontribution that has allowed us to administer the rule \r\nof law, respecting international law, both as an \r\napplicant State and as a respondent State. Indeed — \r\nA/64/PV.30  \r\n \r\n09-58351 22 \r\n \r\nand here I am not praising any imaginary \r\nachievements — the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo has, for over a decade, been one of the main \r\napplicants before the International Court of Justice, \r\nenriching its docket with five cases, which, with the \r\nexception of one, have been resolved. \r\n In the light of our experience with the Court, my \r\ndelegation would like to reaffirm its support for the \r\nactivities of the Court and to encourage States to \r\nsubmit their disputes to it and thus to promote the \r\nconcept of peace based on law and to facilitate \r\npeaceful coexistence. We also encourage States to \r\nsubscribe to the declaration recognizing the \r\ncompulsory jurisdiction of the Court in keeping with \r\nArticle 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute of the Court. \r\nThis, in the view of my delegation, is one of the most \r\nefficient means for submitting cases to the Court, \r\nallowing as it does States parties to the Statute of the \r\nCourt to recognize as compulsory ipso facto and \r\nwithout special agreement, in relation to any other \r\nState accepting the same obligation, the jurisdiction of \r\nthe Court in all legal disputes. The report of the \r\nPresident states that only 66 Member States of the \r\nUnited Nations — and this includes the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo — out of the 192 making up \r\nthis universal organization have made declarations \r\nrecognizing the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court \r\npursuant to Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute of \r\nthe Court. Finally, many of these States’ declarations \r\nwere accompanied by reservations and limitations \r\nwhich set certain categories of disputes apart or \r\nestablished certain conditions to be fulfilled for a case \r\nto come under the jurisdiction of the Court. This is a \r\npractice that my delegation can in no way encourage. \r\n Mr. Shin Boonam (Republic of Korea): At the \r\noutset, I would like to thank Judge Hisashi Owada, \r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice, for \r\npresenting the comprehensive report on the activities of \r\nthe International Court of Justice over the past year. We \r\nwould also like to offer our praise and support to the \r\nCourt for its achievements during the period under \r\nreview. \r\n Over the years, the International Court of Justice \r\nhas been engaged in the search for equitable and just \r\nJudgments to resolve legal disputes between States. \r\nThe devoted work and profound legal wisdom of the \r\nCourt have gained increasing respect and support from \r\nthe international community. Undoubtedly, its \r\nremarkable role in the promotion of peace and security \r\nhas to be underscored. \r\n Notably, the Court rendered three judgments on \r\nthe merits of the cases and one judgment on \r\npreliminary objections. In these cases, the Court met \r\nour high expectations for authoritative language on \r\nmatters of international law. In addition, two orders \r\nwere issued on requests for the indication of \r\nprovisional measures. It is important to note that these \r\ncases before the International Court of Justice come \r\nfrom all over the world and relate to diverse subjects in \r\ninternational law, demonstrating not only the \r\nuniversality of the Court but also its growing \r\nspecialization. \r\n Last year, the Court issued an order on the \r\nrequest for the indication of provisional measures in \r\nthe case concerning Application of the International \r\nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial \r\nDiscrimination (Georgia v. Russian Federation). In its \r\nruling, the Court reconfirmed the binding nature of its \r\norders for the indication of provisional measures under \r\nArticle 41 of the Statute. The process took just over \r\ntwo months after the institution of proceedings — not a \r\nlong time, in particular considering the gravity of the \r\nsituation. Without prejudice to a final decision, my \r\ndelegation recognizes that this case will serve to \r\nstrengthen the role and authority of the Court by \r\nenhancing the effectiveness of the judicial proceedings. \r\n While provisional measures were urgently taken \r\nin the case I have just described, this year the Court \r\nrejected the request by Belgium for the indication of \r\nprovisional measures in the case concerning Questions \r\nrelating to the Obligation to Prosecute or Extradite \r\n(Belgium v. Senegal). Here, the Court clearly illustrated \r\nthe standard of urgency required for it to indicate \r\nprovisional measures: where there is a real and \r\nimminent risk that irreparable prejudice might be \r\ncaused to the rights in dispute before the Court had \r\ngiven its final decision. My delegation believes that \r\nthese orders on provisional measures, based as they are \r\non insightful reasoning and analysis, will be recorded \r\nand referred to as distinctive judicial decisions. \r\n The number of cases coming before the Court has \r\nrisen substantially during the past decade, significantly \r\nincreasing its workload. We recognize that the judicial \r\nyear 2008-2009 was also a busy one, as mentioned in \r\nthe report, with six cases under deliberation at the same \r\ntime. In that regard, it is important to note that the \r\n A/64/PV.30\r\n \r\n23 09-58351 \r\n \r\nCourt has taken a significant number of steps to \r\nincrease its efficiency and thereby enable it to cope \r\nwith the expansion of the scope of its work.  \r\n We welcome that sustained level of activity on \r\nthe part of the Court, and also emphasize that \r\nunreserved cooperation among Member States and the \r\nsupport of the international community as a whole are \r\nimportant for the Court’s success. In that regard, my \r\ndelegation is of the view that the President’s proposed \r\nbudget for the next biennium — including the request \r\nfor the creation of the six law clerk posts to assist the \r\njudges in the increasing number of fact-intensive \r\ncases — should receive favourable consideration. A \r\nrevitalized and more efficient Court with sufficient \r\nfunding would be a great benefit to all members of the \r\ninternational community. \r\n As I conclude my remarks, let me reaffirm the \r\nRepublic of Korea’s steadfast contribution to the \r\ninvaluable work of the International Court of Justice to \r\nachieve the ideal of peace under the rule of law. \r\n Mr. Hernández-Milian (Costa Rica) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): At the outset, I would like to thank Judge \r\nHisashi Owada for his detailed report. The submission \r\nof many contentious cases to the Court’s expertise \r\nconfirms its credibility and legitimacy. Furthermore, it \r\nirrefutably proves that, thanks to the rigour of the \r\nCourt and the ethical and professional standing of its \r\nmembers, international law and the peaceful settlement \r\nof disputes are continually strengthened. \r\n For Costa Rica, the creation of the United \r\nNations system and the establishment of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice enabled us to entrust our \r\npeace and security to the rule of law and to multilateral \r\nmechanisms of coexistence. We have made the rule of \r\nlaw the guiding principle that nurtures our internal \r\ncoexistence and our relations with the international \r\ncommunity. That gained even greater significance after \r\nthe army was abolished, only three years after the \r\nsignature of the San Francisco Charter. The existence \r\nof legitimate procedures to decide legal disputes was \r\nfor us a major difference in the manner of handling our \r\ninternational relations. The Court played a primary role \r\nin a political context that at that time was exposed to \r\nsuccessive breaches of peace and threats to \r\ninternational security. \r\n Costa Rica’s confidence in the international legal \r\norder and in the work of the International Court of \r\nJustice has not been a rhetorical exercise. It has been \r\nborne out by real events. Costa Rica turned to the \r\nCourt to resolve, in an amicable and peaceful way, the \r\nlegal disputes regarding our navigational rights on the \r\nSan Juan River, which delineates our border with the \r\nsister Republic of Nicaragua. We turned to that body in \r\nthe belief that entrusting the settlement of a dispute to \r\ninternational jurisdiction was the most civilized way to \r\nsettle a dispute between nations. \r\n The case was resolved satisfactorily by the Court \r\na few months ago. The Court’s main task was to \r\nestablish a balance between the sovereignty and full \r\nauthority of Nicaragua over the river and Costa Rican \r\nrights to its use for peaceful purposes. The decision is a \r\nmodern interpretation of the provisions established in \r\nthe Treaty of Limits of 1858. With that decision, from \r\nnow on both countries know the legal position of their \r\nrights over the San Juan River and how such rights can \r\nbest be exercised. From the very moment the decision \r\nwas issued in The Hague, Costa Rica and Nicaragua \r\ndeclared their complete commitment to fully respecting \r\nit. My country welcomes the decision of the \r\ninternational judges and recognizes that that decision \r\ncontributes to the coexistence and harmony of our \r\npeoples.  \r\n When my country recognized the independence \r\nof Kosovo, it did so in the belief that that recognition \r\nwas founded on the Rambouillet Accords and other \r\nlegal instruments, but we stand respectfully ready to \r\nsubmit our legal reasoning for consideration by the \r\nInternational Court of Justice. Costa Rica supported the \r\nrequest of the Republic of Serbia that the International \r\nCourt of Justice be asked for an advisory opinion on \r\nthe legal implications of Kosovo’s unilateral \r\ndeclaration of independence. The General Assembly \r\nsubmitted that request to the Court for its study and \r\nexpertise in 2008 (resolution 63/3). Although the \r\nrecognition of a new State falls within the sovereign \r\nsphere of action of a country, the opinion that the Court \r\nis to provide in that regard has, in our view, an intrinsic \r\nvalue and will be studied in depth by Costa Rica.  \r\n Costa Rica welcomes the fact that many treaties \r\nrecognize the Court’s competence to settle disputes \r\narising from their application or interpretation, \r\nalthough there remains some way to go before most \r\nStates of the international community fully adhere to \r\nobligatory contentious jurisdiction. It is necessary that \r\nmore States deposit with the Secretary-General their \r\nacceptance of that jurisdiction. \r\nA/64/PV.30  \r\n \r\n09-58351 24 \r\n \r\n At this time, the universalization of international \r\njustice is needed. Costa Rica values the universal \r\ncharacter of the Court, its contributions to the ongoing \r\nbuilding of international law and the invaluable service \r\nit provides in the concord of nations. Costa Rica urges \r\nacceptance of the Court’s obligatory jurisdiction, the \r\nabandonment of calculated national interests so as to \r\nensure an increasingly credible international legal \r\norder in an age characterized by the intersection of \r\ncivilizations and by extensive and interdependent links \r\namong societies. Accepting the Court’s competence to \r\nconsider contentious cases, without restrictions or \r\nlimits of any kind, is an indisputable condition for the \r\nfull functioning of the international legal order.  \r\n Only with transparent standards and rules \r\nregulating relations among States can we attain the \r\nnecessary legal certainty for contemporary \r\ninternational law to prevail and, under it, mechanisms \r\nsuch as the International Court of Justice for the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes. \r\n Mr. Dinescu (Romania): Romania would like to \r\nthank President Owada for the report on the work of \r\nthe International Court of Justice (A/64/4), which, as is \r\nthe case every year, is both wide-ranging and highly \r\ninformative, and to extend our warmest congratulations \r\nto him on his election as President of the Court. \r\n The report reflects the importance and the central \r\nrole of the world Court in strengthening respect for \r\ninternational law by solving the disputes submitted to it \r\non various and complex matters. The workload of the \r\nICJ has increased considerably in recent years, and the \r\nreport bears witness to the laborious work done by the \r\nCourt, always to the most rigorous legal standards. \r\nRomania considers that the ever more frequent \r\nrecourse to the Court, by States from every region of \r\nthe world, in order to settle disputes in a wide range of \r\nfields of international law, shows not only the \r\nincreasing confidence of the international community \r\nin the professionalism and impartiality of the Court, \r\nbut also the acknowledgement of the unique \r\ncontribution that the Court’s case law brings to the \r\nadvancement and development of international law. \r\n As mentioned in the report, my country has \r\nrecently been involved in proceedings before the \r\nCourt, in relation to the delimitation of the exclusive \r\neconomic zones and continental shelf of Romania and \r\nUkraine in the Black Sea. The judgment was rendered \r\non 3 February 2009; it is highly significant that it was \r\nadopted unanimously and with no separate opinions or \r\ndeclarations appended to it. For us, the proceedings \r\nbefore the Court truly represented a milestone, as \r\nRomania had never before been party to a contentious \r\ncase before the International Court of Justice. The \r\ndecision to seize the Court of this matter was a clear \r\nexpression of my country’s recognition of the Court’s \r\nhigh professionalism and, in particular, of its extensive \r\nexpertise in the field of maritime delimitation. \r\n Our expectations have been wholly fulfilled. We \r\nare very satisfied with the outcome of the case, which \r\nreflects the most accurate application of the relevant \r\nnorms of international law and is fully equitable. The \r\nunprecedented unanimity with which the judgment was \r\nhanded down is convincing proof that the Court’s \r\nsolution was well grounded and judicious. The \r\njudgment is also a significant development in the law \r\nof maritime delimitation, as it reinforces and refines an \r\nalready sizable body of jurisprudence in this field. It \r\noffers extremely useful clarifications of various points \r\nof law and will certainly be of great assistance in \r\nlawsuits concerning maritime boundaries in other \r\ngeographical areas. \r\n I had the privilege of being co-agent, counsel and \r\nadvocate for Romania in this case. I thus had the \r\nchance to acquire first-hand knowledge of how the \r\nCourt works and to assure myself of its efficiency and \r\nprofessionalism. I note in this context the remarkable \r\nefforts of the Court to deal with the case in the shortest \r\npossible time. I would also like to commend the \r\nRegistry of the Court for its highly effective activity \r\nand to congratulate the staff on the quality of their \r\nwork. \r\n My country strongly believes in respect for the \r\nrule of law in international relations. In this context, I \r\nnote that the Court will quite soon hold hearings on the \r\nissue of the accordance with international law of the \r\nunilateral declaration of independence by the \r\nProvisional Institutions of Self-Government in Kosovo. \r\nRomania voted in favour of the General Assembly’s \r\nresolution 63/3, requesting an advisory opinion of the \r\nCourt on this matter, participated in the written stage of \r\nthe process and expressed its intention to participate in \r\nthe oral hearings due to commence on 1 December. We \r\nare convinced that in rendering an advisory opinion on \r\nthe merits of the question, the Court will uphold its \r\nusual standards of impartiality and professionalism. \r\n A/64/PV.30\r\n \r\n25 09-58351 \r\n \r\n Let me conclude by reaffirming Romania’s full \r\nconfidence in, and strong support for, the invaluable \r\nactivity of the Court in ensuring respect for law and \r\njustice at the international level. \r\n Mr. Ben Lagha (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): It is \r\nmy honour to address the General Assembly on behalf \r\nof the delegation of Tunisia as it considers the report of \r\nthe International Court of Justice (A/64/4). Let me \r\nbegin by expressing our thanks and appreciation to \r\nJudge Hisashi Owada, President of the Court, for his \r\ncomprehensive and valuable presentation on the \r\nCourt’s work during the past year. Let me take this \r\nopportunity to congratulate him warmly on his election \r\nto the presidency of the Court and pay tribute to the \r\nvaluable efforts of his predecessor, Judge Higgins. \r\n Tunisia attaches great importance to the rule of \r\nlaw in international relations as a pillar of peaceful \r\ncoexistence among States. We greatly appreciate the \r\npivotal role played by the International Court of \r\nJustice, as the principal judicial organ of the United \r\nNations system, for the peaceful settlement of \r\ninternational disputes and for consolidating and \r\nimplementing the norms and principles of international \r\nlaw. \r\n The past judicial year was quite busy: the Court \r\nhanded down four judgments and two orders on \r\nrequests for the indication of provisional measures. In \r\nthis regard, we would like to express our satisfaction \r\nwith the judgment rendered by the Court in the case of \r\nMaritime Delimitation in the Black Sea, as well as that \r\nin the Dispute regarding Navigational and Related \r\nRights. We also pay tribute to the parties to the disputes \r\nfor their acceptance of the Court’s judgments and their \r\nwillingness to unite their efforts to implement them. \r\nThis is a good example to be followed in the area of \r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes between States, and \r\nis testimony to the importance of the Court’s mandate \r\nand role. \r\n The report outlines the increasing number of \r\ncases before the Court. In addition to previous cases \r\nunder examination, the Court is considering four new \r\ncontentious cases and another request for an advisory \r\nopinion. The report shows that cases are coming from \r\nmany parts of the world and that they are diverse in \r\nnature. The subject matter and diversity of the cases \r\nreflect the universal character of the Court and the \r\nconfidence placed in it, but they also pose new \r\nchallenges. Owing to the limited human and \r\ntechnological resources available to the Court, we \r\nshould give more consideration to ways to strengthen \r\nthe Court and develop its working methods in order to \r\nimprove its efficiency and keep abreast of the demands \r\nand imperatives of modern times, as recommended in \r\nthe 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1). \r\n We would like to commend the high \r\nprofessionalism and efficiency shown by the Court, \r\nand its ability to clear its backlog of cases and cope \r\nwith its increasing workload. In this regard, we \r\nreiterate our belief that the Court’s efforts should be \r\nsupported by creating new posts for clerks and legal \r\nassistants, in addition to providing adequate resources \r\nfor establishing a documents division for the Registry \r\nand equipping the Court with state-of-the-art \r\ntechnology. \r\n While priority should be given to international \r\nlaw, given the increasing complexity of international \r\nrelations, my delegation attaches great importance to \r\nthe role of the Court in providing advisory opinions \r\nthat illuminate the law and eliminate ambiguities. This \r\nhelps the United Nations system and its organs \r\nimplement the goals of the Organization and the \r\ndevelopment and strengthening of the authority of \r\ninternational law. The Court’s role in that sphere is \r\ncommendable, for it is a source of interpretation of the \r\nnorms of international law. Hence, we urge the \r\nSecurity Council, under Article 96 of the Charter, to \r\nseek its help in addressing issues, thus ensuring \r\nharmony between United Nations resolutions and \r\ninternational law. We also encourage the General \r\nAssembly and other United Nations organs and \r\nspecialized agencies to seek the Court’s opinions. This \r\nwould undoubtedly enrich the Court’s jurisprudence \r\nand ensure the primacy of the rule of law and the \r\nvalues envisioned by the authors of the Charter, given \r\nthe high moral and legal value of the Court’s decisions. \r\n My delegation thinks that the Court’s advisory \r\nopinions are not just a point of view but a reaffirmation \r\nof the principles of international law and therefore \r\nshould not remain dead letters: they must be taken into \r\nconsideration by all Member States as well as by the \r\nprincipal organs of the United Nations, in particular the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council. In this \r\ncontext, we would like to recall the recent advisory \r\nopinion relating to the construction of the separation \r\nwall in the occupied Palestinian territory. That advisory \r\nopinion upheld and strengthened the principle of the \r\ninadmissibility of the acquisition of land by force, and \r\nA/64/PV.30  \r\n \r\n09-58351 26 \r\n \r\nwe reiterate our call for it to be taken into account by \r\nthe principal organ of the United Nations responsible \r\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security.  \r\n In closing, I reaffirm our belief in the important \r\nrole played by the ICJ and express our thanks to all its \r\njudges, who perform their duties with high \r\nprofessionalism and transparency. We reiterate our \r\nsupport for the Court as it carries out the noble mission \r\nfor which it was created in the sphere of the \r\nadministration of justice and upholding the rule of law. \r\n Mr. Appreku (Ghana): Ghana welcomes the \r\nreport of the International Court of Justice (A/64/4), \r\npresented by the President of the Court, Judge Hisashi \r\nOwada. Ghana further welcomes the report of the \r\nSecretary-General on the Secretary-General’s Trust \r\nFund to Assist States in the Settlement of Disputes \r\nthrough the International Court of Justice (A/64/308). \r\n I would like to use this opportunity to \r\ncongratulate Judge Owada on his election as President \r\nof the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and to pay \r\ntribute to his predecessor, Dame Rosalyn Higgins, for \r\nher outstanding work on the Court. \r\n Ghana appreciates the measures taken by the \r\nCourt to clear its backlog of cases and to improve its \r\npractice directions, proceedings and working methods. \r\nIt is gratifying to note from the report that States \r\nconsidering coming to the Court can now be confident \r\nthat as soon as they have finished their written \r\nexchanges, the Court will be able to move to the oral \r\nproceedings in a timely manner. However, the \r\nremaining administrative bottlenecks and logistical \r\nchallenges impeding the administration of justice by \r\nthe Court, which have been highlighted in the report, \r\nrequire urgent attention. Ghana therefore appeals to the \r\nAssembly to address urgently the various requests \r\nsubmitted by the Court, including the request for six \r\nadditional law clerks, additional registry staff, new \r\nequipment and adjustments in the pension scheme, in \r\norder to strengthen the staff of its Registry, that is, the \r\nsecretariat of the Court, as well as upgrade its \r\ntechnology, information management and record \r\nkeeping. That, we believe, will enhance efficiency, \r\neffectiveness and incentives for the learned judges, \r\nwith a view to making it possible for States to obtain \r\njustice without undue delay and at less cost. \r\n The Secretary-General has reported that in the \r\nperiod under review the Trust Fund did not receive any \r\napplications from any State for assistance in the \r\nsettlement of disputes through the ICJ. Although the \r\nreason was not stated, it would be desirable to create \r\ngreater awareness about the existence of the Fund, \r\nwhich assists financially challenged parties that submit \r\ndisputes to the Court to enable them to honour their \r\nfinancial obligations associated with the Court’s \r\ndispute-settlement mechanism. \r\n It is significant that many of the disputes that \r\nhave come before the Court during the reporting period \r\ninvolve contentious issues of international law over \r\nwhich States have expressed divergent or sometimes \r\ndiametrically opposed views. These include questions \r\nrelating to the obligation to extradite or prosecute, the \r\nimmunity of foreign officials in foreign criminal \r\njurisdiction, jurisdictional immunities of States and the \r\ndelimitation of the continental shelf, areas in which \r\nthere may be gaps in the relevant rules of international \r\nlaw or where established norms or principles may need \r\nfurther clarification or elaboration. For example, in the \r\nabsence of an agreement among States parties to the \r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea \r\n(UNCLOS), the Court may be called upon in the \r\nforeseeable future to resolve overlapping claims and \r\nissues arising from submissions made by States \r\npursuant to paragraph 8 of article 76 of UNCLOS, \r\nwhereby coastal States may claim an extended outer \r\nlimit of their continental shelf beyond 200 nautical \r\nmiles. It is hoped that the decisions or opinions \r\nrendered by the Court in the cases settled or yet to be \r\nresolved by the Court in the reporting period will \r\nbecome instrumental in lessening prevailing \r\ndifferences and tensions as well as forging consensus \r\nand thus facilitating the codification and progressive \r\ndevelopment of international law. \r\n My delegation would like to encourage the Court \r\nto intensify its outreach programmes including its \r\nongoing dialogue with other international judicial \r\nbodies, such as the International Criminal Court, with \r\nthe aim of addressing the question of the fragmentation \r\nof international law and harmonizing the norms of \r\ninternational law. To that end, it is particularly \r\nimportant for it to deepen its dialogue with the various \r\ninternational ad hoc criminal tribunals, many of which \r\nare currently implementing their completion strategies. \r\nGhana will also reiterate the need for the Court to \r\nimprove its cooperation and dialogue with regional and \r\nsubregional courts, including the African Court of \r\nJustice, the African Court of Human and Peoples’ \r\nRights and the Court of Justice of the Economic \r\n A/64/PV.30\r\n \r\n27 09-58351 \r\n \r\nCommunity of West African States. The capacity of \r\nthese regional and subregional courts in Africa and \r\nother regions will no doubt be enhanced through the \r\nsharing of the Court’s experience and expertise in \r\nterms of working methods and caseload management, \r\namong other areas. \r\n The diversity of disputes that have been settled \r\nby or are pending before the Court, in terms of subject \r\nmatter, geographical region and the level of \r\ndevelopment of the States involved, attests to the \r\ngrowing confidence in the Court. It is by now a truism \r\nthat the Court plays an indispensable role in the \r\npromotion of peace and security. However, what my \r\ndelegation would like to stress is the invaluable \r\ncontribution of the decisions of the Court to the \r\npromotion of good-neighbourliness, as many cases \r\nbefore it involve disputes between States that share \r\ncommon boundaries and belong to the same region or \r\ninternational organization, and that at times bring \r\ndisputes requiring the Court to interpret bilateral \r\nagreements that they themselves have concluded to \r\npromote good-neighbourliness. The fact that the \r\noverwhelming majority of parties to disputes before the \r\nCourt accepts the judgments and decisions of the Court  \r\n \r\nin good faith has helped to keep friendships and \r\nalliances — as well as otherwise hostile or unfriendly \r\nrelations — in constant good repair. That is evidence of \r\nthe moral authority of the Court.  \r\n Indeed, at times the mere filing of claims or \r\nlodging of grievances at the Court has been \r\ninstrumental in preventing the escalation of many \r\nconflicts. Ghana believes that it is imperative for the \r\nCourt to strive to sustain the confidence of the \r\ninternational community in it, on the basis of its \r\nimpartiality, independence, integrity, competence and \r\nefficiency, about which there is no doubt. \r\n In conclusion, we wish to recall that the Charter \r\nof the United Nations imposes an obligation on \r\nMember States to ensure respect for the principles of \r\njustice and international law. The national Constitution \r\nof Ghana reaffirms this obligation. Therefore Ghana \r\nwould like to take this occasion to renew its \r\ncommitment to support the work of the International \r\nCourt of Justice as the principal judicial organ of the \r\nUnited Nations in its quest to promote the rule of law \r\nas the foundation for the conduct of international \r\nrelations.  \r\n  The meeting rose at 6.10 p.m. \r\n"
