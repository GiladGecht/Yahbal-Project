(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.  \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda items 64 and 75 (continued) \r\n \r\nReport of the Human Rights Council (A/64/53) \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): In connection \r\nwith this item, I would like to recall that the General \r\nAssembly, at its 2nd plenary meeting, on 18 September, \r\ndecided, inter alia, to consider agenda item 64 in a \r\nplenary meeting and in the Third Committee.  \r\n Also, at its 27th plenary meeting, on 28 October, \r\nthe Assembly decided to consider directly in plenary \r\nmeetings, without setting a precedent, the report of the \r\nHuman Rights Council on its twelfth special session \r\n(A/64/53/Add.1). \r\n Taking into account these two decisions, the \r\nAssembly will consider in its plenary meeting today \r\nthe annual report of the Human Rights Council on its \r\nactivities for the year, as contained in document \r\nA/64/53. On Wednesday, 4 November, the Assembly \r\nwill consider the report contained in document \r\nA/64/53/Add.1. The Assembly will now begin its \r\nconsideration of the annual report of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil (A/64/53). \r\n Allow me now to make a statement as President \r\nof the Assembly.  \r\n In my statement at the opening of the general \r\ndebate, I recalled the affirmation by the 2005 World \r\nSummit that the promotion and protection of human \r\nrights was one of the three principal purposes of this \r\nOrganization. I declared that human rights stood, \r\nalongside development, and peace and security, as a \r\npillar of the Organization.  \r\n I then called on Member States to commit to \r\nensuring that this third pillar was one made of stone, \r\nbuttressed by the resources, respect and credibility \r\nbenefiting an institution dedicated to the cause of \r\nhuman dignity and justice. I asked for the Assembly’s \r\nsupport for the further development of the Human \r\nRights Council and for effective follow-up to the \r\nDurban Review Conference in combating the global \r\nscourge of racism. I appealed for an approach on \r\nhuman rights marked by universality and non-selectivity.  \r\n The agenda before us today is a reminder of the \r\nsignificance of the principles of human rights and of \r\nthe vital need to assess the progress made and the \r\nremaining challenges in the attainment of those \r\nobjectives. \r\n The report of the Human Rights Council covers \r\nthe remarkable scope and depth of the Council’s work \r\nover the past year. This technical body has already \r\nregistered an impressive list of achievements, addressing \r\nthe full range of human rights in countries all around \r\nthe globe. New instruments have been developed, \r\nspecial sessions convened to address emergencies, and \r\nvital resolutions adopted. The independent special \r\nmechanisms have undertaken countless missions, and \r\nthe universal periodic review is now in full operation, \r\nreminding us all of the universality of the human rights \r\nof all our citizens, the universality of the obligations of \r\nall our Governments and the universality of the \r\nchallenges faced in realizing human rights. The broad \r\nA/64/PV.31  \r\n \r\n09-58708 2 \r\n \r\nparticipation that has characterized the Council’s work, \r\nfrom members and observers alike as well as from civil \r\nsociety, is a hallmark of its consultative approach. \r\n Ensuring that the Council has the necessary \r\nsupport and resources is imperative for the successful \r\ncontinuation of its work, and this Assembly has to \r\nassume the primary responsibility in that regard. As the \r\nCouncil approaches its mandated five-year review in \r\n2011, we should develop a transparent and inclusive \r\nprocess. The Assembly must begin preparations for this \r\nreview in close cooperation with the Council. To this \r\nend, I met yesterday with the President of the Human \r\nRights Council and will continue consulting with \r\ndelegations in the coming weeks. \r\n I now give the floor to the representative of \r\nBelgium, who is also the President of the Human \r\nRights Council. \r\n Mr. van Meeuwen (Belgium): It is an honour and \r\nprivilege to present the report of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil (A/64/53) to the General Assembly, and to come \r\nbefore the Assembly this morning to apprise Members \r\nof its activities, in accordance with resolution 60/251. \r\n Allow me at the outset to state how delighted I \r\nam, Mr. President, to see you presiding over the \r\nAssembly. I am pleased to reaffirm the support of the \r\nHuman Rights Council to your leadership of the \r\nAssembly and to express our best wishes for a \r\nsuccessful tenure. \r\n My predecessors, His Excellency Luis Alfonso \r\nDe Alba, His Excellency Ambassador Doru Romulus \r\nCostea and His Excellency Martin Ihoeghian \r\nUhomoibhi, had presented the Human Rights Council’s \r\nreports (A/61/53, A/62/53 and A/63/53 and Add.1) to \r\nthe Assembly at its sixty-first, sixty-second and sixty-\r\nthird sessions respectively, covering the activities of \r\nthe Council from June 2006 to September 2008. \r\nTherefore, my present report will cover the period of \r\nthe third cycle of the Council following the session \r\nfrom September 2008 to June 2009. \r\n At the outset, I would like to recall that the \r\ndecision of the General Assembly four years ago to \r\nestablish the Human Rights Council marked a \r\nsignificant moment in United Nations history. It \r\nreflected the commitment and resolve of Member \r\nStates to revitalize and strengthen the Organization’s \r\nrole in guaranteeing the effective enjoyment of all \r\nhuman rights for all. Member States reaffirmed their \r\nfaith in fundamental human rights and in the dignity \r\nand worth of the human person, which forms the core \r\nof the United Nations Charter, as laid down over half a \r\ncentury ago. The important mandate the Council was \r\nentrusted with raises high, yet legitimate, expectations \r\non the part of people around the world. This is a \r\nsignificant responsibility, which we all share, and to \r\nlive up to these expectations, which guide our daily \r\nwork, is a common endeavour. \r\n With this, allow me now to briefly highlight some \r\nof the achievements and activities of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n The universal periodic review is generally \r\nconsidered to be one of the most meaningful \r\ninnovations of the Human Rights Council, but in fact \r\nthis mechanism expresses the spirit of the United \r\nNations Charter in every aspect. It is based on equality \r\namong States, large and small, and provides equal \r\ntreatment in the implementation of agreed standards. It \r\nreflects the solidarity that prevails among States that \r\nhave decided to carry out peer review endeavours and \r\njoin their efforts in order to promote and protect human \r\nrights. The establishment of this mechanism and its \r\nmodalities required important and intensive work by \r\nthe Council. Almost half the Member States have now \r\nbeen examined, and the global evaluation of the \r\nmechanism has been unequivocally positive.  \r\n Attention will now be progressively shifted \r\ntowards follow-up to and implementation of \r\nrecommendations. Although this has been said a \r\nnumber of times, the fact remains that carrying out a \r\nserious and sensible universal periodic review is an \r\nimportant test of the credibility of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil as a whole.  \r\n Whether at regular sessions, in working groups or \r\nother forums linked to the Council, continuous efforts \r\nhave been made to develop and secure a better \r\nunderstanding of the international norms and standards \r\non human rights. Several new fields related to human \r\nrights have been considered, and older issues have \r\nbeen discussed in greater depth. The adoption of \r\nstandards is also an area in which visible and tangible \r\nprogress has been achieved over the past few years. \r\n In accordance with its mandate, the Council has \r\nbeen seized of events that have occurred in certain \r\nparts of the world and which constitute serious \r\n A/64/PV.31\r\n \r\n3 09-58708 \r\n \r\nviolations of human rights, thus requiring an urgent \r\nresponse. The Council devoted its eighth special \r\nsession to the situation of human rights in the east of \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo; its ninth \r\nspecial session to the grave violations of human rights \r\nin the occupied Palestinian territory, including the \r\nrecent Israeli military aggression in the occupied Gaza \r\nStrip; its tenth to the impact of the world economic and \r\nfinancial crisis on the universal realization and \r\neffective enjoyment of human rights; and its eleventh \r\nspecial session to the human rights situation in Sri \r\nLanka. The reports of the Council for these special \r\nsessions (A/HRC/S-8/2, A/HRC/S-9/2, A/HRC/S-10/2 \r\nand A/HRC/S-11/2) are also before us. \r\n Although the Council has been operating for four \r\nyears now and although its institutional architecture is \r\nin place and its mechanisms operational, it is still \r\nevolving, covering new topics concerning human rights \r\nin its discussions and thereby broadening its agenda. \r\nThe Council has sought to find novel approaches to \r\nquestions concerning human rights in order to transcend \r\nthe inherent rigidity of its procedures and to avoid \r\nfalling back into the old patterns that were widely \r\ncriticized when it was known as the Commission on \r\nHuman Rights.  \r\n I am pleased to have witnessed the emergence of \r\nthese new debate formats and more flexible work \r\nmodalities. These innovations have allowed the Council \r\nto focus more on debate. They have also enabled the \r\nexperts and representatives of national human rights \r\ninstitutions and members of civil society from around \r\nthe world to make a meaningful contribution to the \r\ndeliberations of the Council.  \r\n Panel discussions have been organized on many \r\nhuman rights topics, such as the rights of the disabled, \r\nthe right to food, children’s rights, women’s rights and \r\nhuman rights and climate change, in order to bring \r\nabout greater awareness and take concrete action on \r\nessential topics. \r\n As I mentioned previously, the Council has \r\nreached another important achievement by holding a \r\nsecond special session on the world economic crisis. In \r\ndoing so, the Council continued the trend of \r\nsubstantially linking economic, social and cultural rights \r\nwith what is actually happening on the ground and \r\nhaving an impact on the lives of millions of people.  \r\n During the period under consideration, the \r\nCouncil continued to engage with a broad spectrum of \r\nstakeholders and participants — individuals, of course, \r\nbut also institutions, including special procedure \r\nentities, human rights treaty bodies, organs and entities \r\nof the United Nations, other international organizations, \r\nnon-governmental organizations and national human \r\nrights bodies. The question of whether the Council’s \r\nability to effectively integrate into its debate the views \r\nand contributions of other stakeholders, such as \r\nnational human rights institutions and civil society, will \r\nbe a key element in assessing its performance and its \r\nimpact. The Council has clearly recognized that taking \r\ninto consideration the views and contributions of the \r\nentire range of stakeholders is a prerequisite for the \r\nenrichment of its work.  \r\n Allow me briefly to emphasize that the work of \r\nthe Council at its previous sessions — and the reports \r\non those sessions are before the Assembly — was \r\ncontinued during the Council’s twelfth session, which \r\nwas held from 14 September to 2 October, and during \r\nthe twelfth special session of the Council, held on \r\n15 and 16 October, which focused on the human rights \r\nsituation in the occupied Palestinian territories, \r\nincluding East Jerusalem. I will not mention anything \r\nfurther about these two sessions, since they are to be \r\ndiscussed later on by the Assembly. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n Many things have been achieved since the \r\nCouncil’s inception only three years ago. Yet, the past \r\nyears have also revealed the challenges ahead of us. \r\nThe Human Rights Council is not a perfect institution, \r\nand the upcoming review process will indeed provide \r\nus with the opportunity to fine-tune some of the \r\nmechanisms and adjust working methods in those areas \r\nwhere changes will allow for genuine progress to be \r\nmade. It is our duty and shared responsibility to \r\ncontinue to strengthen the United Nations human rights \r\nmachinery for an enhanced promotion and protection \r\nof all human rights for all. This can only be done \r\nthrough cooperation and with the collaborative efforts \r\nof the entire spectrum of the membership of the \r\nCouncil, civil society and, indeed, all stakeholders. \r\n The Human Rights Council has decided to create \r\nan open-ended intergovernmental working group on the \r\nreview of the work and functioning of the Council and \r\nhas requested its current President to undertake \r\ntransparent and all-inclusive consultations on the \r\nmodalities of the review, thereby aiming to implement \r\nparagraph 16 of resolution 60/251, which states that the \r\nA/64/PV.31  \r\n \r\n09-58708 4 \r\n \r\nCouncil shall review its work and functioning five \r\nyears after its establishment and report to the General \r\nAssembly. The Working Group will meet in the second \r\nhalf of 2010 and is requested to report to the Council at \r\nits seventeenth session, in June 2011. \r\n During my mandate as President, I will spare no \r\neffort to facilitate the debate on issues of process and \r\ntry to reach a consensus on the way forward, to be \r\nimplemented by my successor next year. The ongoing \r\ndialogue among stakeholders in New York and Geneva \r\nshould of course also be ensured, respecting the \r\ndivision of labour, as set out by the Assembly in \r\nresolution 60/251. While we continue to improve our \r\nagenda and working methods, the review process should \r\nnot slow down the Council’s substantive work or the \r\nimplementation of the commonly agreed mandate. I \r\nwill pay particular attention to this and will call on the \r\nsense of responsibility of all stakeholders in this regard. \r\n While recognizing that we have to continue to \r\nimprove the functioning of the new Human Rights \r\nCouncil, there is wide acknowledgement in Geneva \r\nthat there is a perennial lack of appropriate resources to \r\nservice the Council’s work. I have called for the \r\nestablishment of a tripartite task force, composed of \r\nrepresentatives from the Office of the President, the \r\nOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights \r\nand the Division of Conference Management, to \r\naddress this issue. Member States will be aware as well \r\nof the initiative to request an audit from the Office of \r\nInternal Oversight Services in this respect. The \r\nDivision of Conference Management has continued to \r\ngrapple with the challenges raised by the voluminous \r\nworkload generated by the Human Rights Council and \r\nits subsidiary machinery, including the new universal \r\nperiodic review process mandated by the General \r\nAssembly. The practice employed thus far, of servicing \r\nthese new mandates from within existing resources, has \r\nproved to be impractical. The time has come to address \r\nthe entire spectrum of meetings-servicing requirements \r\nand to ensure that the universal periodic review process \r\nis fully supported by the necessary budgetary and \r\ncapacity resources for the next biennium. \r\n I am confident that, in the years ahead, we will be \r\nable to consolidate the gains of the first years towards \r\nimproving people’s realities. The tasks before us may \r\nbe daunting; in spite of this, we remain committed to \r\nthe plight of the victims of human rights abuses and \r\nmust ensure that this message translates into results to \r\ntheir benefit. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to reiterate my personal \r\ncommitment to follow the path of my predecessors and \r\nto work closely with the Council’s members to achieve \r\nthose noble objectives enshrined in the Charter and the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. \r\n Mr. Lidén (Sweden): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of the European Union (EU). Albania, \r\nArmenia, Croatia, Georgia, Iceland, Montenegro, the \r\nRepublic of Moldova, the former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia, Turkey and Ukraine align themselves with \r\nthis statement.  \r\n First of all, we would like to thank Ambassador \r\nAlex van Meeuwen for submitting the Human Rights \r\nCouncil’s fourth annual report (A/64/53). We would \r\nalso like to thank Ambassador Martin Ihoeghian \r\nUhomoibhi, the former President of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, who was in office during the period covered \r\nin the report. \r\n When the Assembly decided in 2006 to establish \r\nthe Human Rights Council, it aimed at strengthening \r\nthe ability of the United Nations to ensure that all \r\npersons would be able to enjoy all human rights. It was \r\ndecided that the Council should address situations of \r\nviolations of human rights, including gross and \r\nsystematic violations, and respond promptly to human \r\nrights emergencies.  \r\n Peace, security, development and human rights \r\ncomplement each other and are mutually reinforcing. It \r\nis through their joint promotion that our collective \r\nwell-being is strengthened. The principles of \r\nuniversality, impartiality and objectivity must guide the \r\nwork of the Council and direct us in the Assembly as \r\nwe consider its report. \r\n The European Union considers this plenary \r\nmeeting of the General Assembly to be the appropriate \r\nplace to consider the report of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, which was established as a subsidiary organ \r\nof this Assembly. \r\n The members of the Human Rights Council have \r\nthe responsibility to fulfil the promise of the Council as \r\nthe main United Nations body for the protection and \r\npromotion of human rights. It is important that States \r\nthat pursue membership in the Human Rights Council \r\nformulate concrete, credible and measurable pledges to \r\npromote and protect human rights at the national and \r\ninternational levels.  \r\n A/64/PV.31\r\n \r\n5 09-58708 \r\n \r\n Some important progress has been made since the \r\nestablishment of the Council. We express our \r\nappreciation to the majority of States that have \r\nengaged constructively in the process of the universal \r\nperiodic review. We hope that those States that have \r\ninstead tried to hamper the process in order to avoid \r\ncriticism will engage more openly next time. \r\n The EU encourages all Governments to take \r\nadvantage of the opportunity that the universal periodic \r\nreview provides for States in all regions to do better by \r\nmeans of dialogue and cooperation. It hopes that the \r\nexperience gained at previous sessions will help to \r\nimprove future ones and that all States under review \r\nwill cooperate with the Council in good faith and with \r\nall the necessary rigour. \r\n The EU attaches great importance to the role of \r\nthe Council as a forum for dialogue in which every \r\nhuman rights issue can be raised. We encourage Member \r\nStates to continue to consider the human rights situation \r\non the ground and the needs of victims as the guiding \r\ncriteria when determining the agenda of the Council. \r\n The European Union finds the ongoing \r\nmonitoring and reporting role of the Council to be \r\nequally important. It has allowed the Council to learn \r\nabout new developments and possible best practices. It \r\nis only through objective monitoring and reporting to \r\nthe Council that it can identify the needs of victims and \r\npossible areas for assistance to States.  \r\n We wish to underline the importance of the \r\ncooperation of States in allowing the Council to fulfil \r\nthe mandate agreed upon and to live up to the \r\nexpectations of people around the globe.  \r\n The EU would like to thank civil society \r\norganizations for their important contributions to the \r\nwork of the Council. We hope that their cooperation \r\nwith the Council will continue and develop further. \r\n Regrettably, while some situations of violations \r\nhave been addressed in resolutions and special sessions, \r\nthe Council has been prevented from addressing a \r\nnumber of other human rights emergencies. It is crucial \r\nfor its credibility that the Council be able to live up to \r\nits promise of ensuring universality, objectivity and \r\nnon-selectivity, in accordance with its mandate. \r\n The eighth special session dealt with the situation \r\nof human rights in the east of the Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo. The EU still hopes that the mandate of \r\nthe independent expert on the situation of human rights \r\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo will be \r\nre-established. A number of issues need to be \r\naddressed, not least the widespread use of sexual \r\nviolence against women and children and the impunity \r\nenjoyed by those responsible for violations of human \r\nrights and international humanitarian law in the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo.  \r\n Many of the issues dealt with at special sessions \r\nremain of very serious concern, such as the promotion \r\nand protection of human rights in Sri Lanka. In \r\nparticular, the situation in the former conflict zone \r\nremains critical. We are convinced that country \r\nmandates are needed to keep the Council and other \r\nparts of the United Nations system informed of serious \r\nsituations and to assist in making tangible improvements \r\non the ground.  \r\n The primary objective of the special procedures \r\nof the Council is to promote expertise and best \r\npractices and to make recommendations in order to \r\nensure greater respect for human rights. All States \r\nmembers of the European Union have extended a \r\nstanding invitation to the special procedures, and we \r\ncall upon all United Nations Member States to do \r\nlikewise. The EU finds it imperative to safeguard the \r\nrole played by all special procedures mandate-holders \r\nin monitoring, advising on and publicly reporting on \r\nserious human rights situations and thematic issues. It \r\nis also crucial to safeguard the independence of Special \r\nRapporteurs and the other procedures so that they can \r\ncarry out their respective mandates without undue \r\ninterference and pressure from Member States. \r\n We call upon the Council never to let down its \r\nguard concerning situations that deserve the full \r\nattention of the international community. The mandate \r\nof the Council is not to protect Governments from \r\nscrutiny, but to protect individuals from human rights \r\nviolations. We do not accept an artificial divide between \r\nraising human rights violations in individual countries \r\nand providing technical assistance to improve respect \r\nfor human rights. The important role of the special \r\nprocedures of the Human Rights Council and the \r\nOffice of the High Commissioner in providing advice, \r\ncapacity-building and monitoring is a case in point. \r\n We are now closer to the 2011 deadline for the \r\nGeneral Assembly to review the status of the Council. \r\nMeanwhile, it is important to remember that only two \r\nyears have elapsed since the institution-building \r\npackage for the Council was adopted. The ongoing \r\nA/64/PV.31  \r\n \r\n09-58708 6 \r\n \r\nwork of the Council must not be interrupted. Moreover, \r\nwe may seek the best ways to address many of the \r\nshortcomings of the Council during its continued work. \r\nThe European Union calls on all States to work \r\ntogether to fulfil the full promise and potential of the \r\nHuman Rights Council in order to make a difference \r\nwhen it comes to protecting and promoting human \r\nrights. \r\n Mrs. Dunlop (Brazil): At the outset, let me thank \r\nAmbassador Alex van Meeuwen, President of the \r\nHuman Rights Council, for presenting the report of the \r\nCouncil (A/64/53) today at this meeting. I would also \r\nlike to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the former \r\nPresident of the Council, Ambassador Martin \r\nUhomoibhi, for the important contribution he made to \r\nthe strengthening of the Council during his tenure. \r\n As we start to engage in initial informal talks \r\nregarding the review of the Council, scheduled for \r\n2011, it is time to take stock of its performance and its \r\ncontributions to the promotion and protection of human \r\nrights worldwide. I would also like to take this \r\nopportunity to reflect on what we expect from the \r\nCouncil in the future. \r\n It is fitting to recall that the Human Rights Council \r\nwas created as the embodiment of the commitment \r\nmade at the 2005 World Summit to elevate human \r\nrights, an issue that constitutes one of the main pillars \r\nof this Organization, to the forefront of the United \r\nNations agenda. In our view, the Council fulfilled that \r\nexpectation. \r\n After the hard work that led to the adoption of the \r\ninstitutional package in 2007, much ground was \r\ncovered to ensure that the Council would not suffer the \r\nshortcomings of the old Commission on Human Rights. \r\nFirst, we regard the universal periodic review as one of \r\nthe main achievements in the field of human rights \r\nsince the creation of the Council. We are on the way to \r\nseeing, for the first time, every Member State \r\nsubmitting its human rights situation to a peer review \r\nprocess in which contributions by relevant stakeholders, \r\nincluding civil society, are taken into account. It cannot \r\nbe denied that this mechanism per se represents a huge \r\nstep towards a more egalitarian, non-selective and \r\ntransparent approach to human rights. Improvement \r\nwas also observed in the special procedures mechanism \r\ninherited from the Commission, which was strengthened \r\nin the Council through the increased institutional \r\nsupport provided to Special Rapporteurs and other \r\nmandate-holders. \r\n The Council is consolidating its role as a relevant \r\nforum for the discussion of pressing issues on the \r\ninternational agenda as they relate to human rights. In \r\nthat regard, it is worthwhile to praise the decision taken \r\nby the Council to hold two thematic special sessions to \r\ndiscuss the world food crisis and the financial and \r\neconomic crisis from a human rights perspective. \r\n The Council sent a message to the international \r\ncommunity that those crises, which many had believed \r\nto be of a purely economic nature, had an undeniable \r\nand serious human rights dimension. We expect the \r\nCouncil not to shy away from addressing similar \r\nchallenges in the future, as needed. All in all, the \r\nHuman Rights Council has represented a significant \r\nimprovement over the Commission by promoting \r\ndialogue and cooperation among Member States and \r\nwith other relevant stakeholders. \r\n Despite the positive aspects I just mentioned, the \r\nCouncil, as we know, is not perfect. There is still room \r\nfor improvement, as one could expect from an entity \r\nthat is only three years old and tasked with the difficult \r\nmission of overseeing human rights around the world. \r\nAmong possible improvements, I will briefly mention \r\ntwo areas that merit our attention. First, we need to \r\nimprove participation in the interactive dialogue by \r\ncountries undergoing universal periodic review. \r\nSecondly, there is a need to expand the mandate of the \r\nCouncil in the field of cooperation. After proving its \r\nusefulness in identifying human rights challenges, the \r\nCouncil should be able to help interested countries \r\novercome the problems identified. This would help \r\naddress current deficiencies in the implementation of \r\nrecommendations issued at the universal periodic \r\nreview. \r\n We will have a better opportunity to address our \r\nexpectations regarding the future of the Council during \r\nthe review process which, it is worth recalling, will be \r\ncarried out by the Council itself in relation to its work \r\nand functioning and by the Assembly regarding its \r\nstatus. \r\n As a steadfast supporter of the creation of the \r\nHuman Rights Council in 2006, Brazil will participate \r\nactively in our common efforts towards the review of \r\nthe Council in 2011. We are convinced that through \r\nconstructive dialogue and openness aimed at \r\nunderstanding each other’s positions and limits, it will \r\n A/64/PV.31\r\n \r\n7 09-58708 \r\n \r\nbe possible to achieve a consensual decision in the \r\nreview process. That decision must reflect solutions \r\nthat are acceptable to all and result in a Council that \r\nfully corresponds to the high aspirations it embodies. \r\n Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to express my delegation’s \r\nappreciation for the comprehensive statement made \r\nhere by the President of the Human Rights Council \r\nfollowing his participation in the debate on the \r\nCouncil’s report (A/64/53) in the Third Committee — \r\nthe expert negotiating body of the General Assembly \r\non all issues related to human rights and international \r\nhuman rights law. \r\n In that context I reiterate that our acceptance of \r\nthe ad hoc agreement reached in the General Committee \r\nto consider the report both in plenary meeting and in \r\nthe Third Committee this year was based on the clear \r\nunderstanding that the Third Committee would consider \r\nand act upon all recommendations of the Human \r\nRights Council to the General Assembly, including \r\nthose on the development of international law in the \r\nfield of human rights, without prejudice to the right of \r\nMember States to submit draft resolutions and decisions \r\nin the General Assembly or the Third Committee on \r\nany issue contained in the report. \r\n Indeed, the establishment of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil as a subsidiary organ of the General Assembly \r\nhas ushered in the dawn of a new era of cooperative \r\nand collective action that avoids the politicization, \r\nselectivity and double standards that characterized the \r\nwork of the Commission on Human Rights. The \r\nCouncil has been successful in laying favourable \r\nfoundations to overcome the obstacles that in the past \r\nblocked international efforts aimed at strengthening the \r\nuniversal respect of human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms. This became possible through diligent \r\nefforts to unify standards and thanks to a constructive, \r\ncooperative approach in dealing with human rights \r\nquestions based on advice and on the provision of \r\nnecessary technical and financial support upon the \r\nrequest of national Governments pursuant to their \r\nresponsibility to promote and protect the human rights \r\nof all of their citizens. The 2005 World Summit \r\nOutcome (resolution 60/1) laid out these foundations, \r\nwhich were more recently reinforced by the launch of \r\nthe universal periodic review mechanism. We look \r\nforward to its review of Egypt’s report early next year. \r\n Egypt welcomes the progress made in the \r\npractical implementation of the institutional framework \r\nfor the work of the Council. It includes clear \r\nregulations defined by the Code of Conduct for Special \r\nProcedures Mandate-holders of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, in addition to the positive developments in \r\nreviewing the mandates of the special procedures, the \r\ndesign of mechanisms to deal with communications \r\nand the establishment of the Forum on Minority Issues.  \r\n Meanwhile, as a current member of the Council, \r\nEgypt is eager to support the continued development of \r\nthe Council’s activities to meet the great expectations \r\nwe share for it, based on the complementary roles of \r\nnational institutions and the international community \r\non the one hand and all of the human rights \r\nmechanisms on the other hand.  \r\n Our mutual quest for the promotion of human \r\nrights in the world at large, to make them a common \r\ndenominator shared by all societies, requires a \r\ncommitment to implementing the fledgling universal \r\nperiodic review process for all States, on an equal \r\nfooting and without exception, within a constructive \r\ninteractive framework and with the participation of \r\nnon-governmental organizations and all segments of \r\ncivil society. We must also respect the institutional \r\nbalance between the principal organs of the United \r\nNations when dealing with human rights questions. We \r\nmust confront with solid determination the tendency of \r\na few to impose themselves as worldwide custodians of \r\nhuman rights — based on a flawed and groundless \r\nassumption that their values, cultures, concepts of \r\nsocial justice, legal systems and human rights \r\nstandards are superior to those of others. \r\n Additionally, it is imperative to make available \r\nthe financial resources necessary to support the activities \r\nof the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner \r\nfor Human Rights so that it can implement its mandates \r\nefficiently. It must have the capacity to provide the \r\nnecessary technical assistance and consultation to \r\nMember States, follow up on the implementation of all \r\nHuman Rights Council decisions and assist States in \r\ncapacity-building in order to achieve complementarity \r\nbetween the roles of the Commission and of the \r\nCouncil, and between the roles of the international \r\ncommunity and of national Governments. \r\n We must respect the prerogatives of the Human \r\nRights Council and refrain from submitting country-\r\nspecific draft resolutions in the Third Committee, \r\nA/64/PV.31  \r\n \r\n09-58708 8 \r\n \r\nespecially those targeting developing countries, which \r\nserve only to undermine the potential to reach consensus \r\ndecisions that promote respect for human rights. \r\nEqually, it is necessary to put an end to attempts to \r\ncreate structures parallel to the Council, for example \r\nby appointing officials responsible for monitoring \r\nhuman rights situations in developing countries in the \r\noffices of United Nations development programmes, in \r\ncontravention of the principles of equality in monitoring \r\nhuman rights situations in all countries, whether they \r\nare developing or developed countries. \r\n We should work in parallel within the United \r\nNations system to strengthen early warning capabilities \r\nthrough reliance on authenticated and non-politicized \r\ninformation, and strengthen cooperation by States with \r\nfact-finding missions dispatched by the Council to \r\ninvestigate gross violations of human rights, particularly \r\nin the case of peoples under foreign occupation and in \r\nconflict situations. The international community’s quest \r\nfor universal respect for human and peoples’ rights will \r\nremain unattainable unless we completely leave behind \r\nselectivity, politicization and double standards when \r\ndealing with human and peoples’ rights, starting with \r\nthe inalienable right to self-determination. \r\n In this context, the Council must remain engaged \r\nin order to ensure respect for human rights in the \r\noccupied Palestinian territories and Israel’s full \r\nadherence to its international obligations, including its \r\ncommitment to full cooperation with the Special \r\nRapporteur on the situation of human rights in the \r\nPalestinian territories occupied since 1967 and the fact-\r\nfinding missions established by the Council to \r\ninvestigate gross violations of human rights. That \r\nincludes permitting the requested field visits — the \r\nmost recent of which was the fact-finding mission led \r\nby Justice Goldstone to investigate the tragic events \r\nthat took place in Gaza. In that regard, Egypt, on \r\nbehalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, supported the \r\nCouncil’s recommendation that the General Assembly \r\nconsider the report of the fact-finding mission. \r\n Restoring the balance in international attention \r\nbetween economic, social and cultural rights, on the \r\none hand, and civil and political rights, on the other, is \r\nsorely needed if we wish to fulfil the common \r\naspiration of peoples throughout the world to the \r\neffective realization of the right to development as a \r\nfundamental right inherently linked to all other rights. \r\nThat in turn is not possible unless we work together to \r\nbridge the gap between North and South, thus making \r\nit possible to achieve better standards of living, which \r\ncontribute to the promotion of human rights for both \r\nindividuals and societies. Furthermore, we look \r\nforward to strengthening efforts to eliminate all forms \r\nof discrimination throughout the world, whether based \r\non race, sex, language or religion, and to honouring our \r\nmutual commitments under the Durban Declaration and \r\nProgramme of Action and the outcome document of the \r\nReview Conference, particularly with regard to \r\ndiscrimination against women, minorities, migrants \r\nand others who face varying degrees of social \r\nmarginalization and discrimination. In our efforts to \r\nthat end, we should avoid conditionalities and \r\ncontroversial notions that do not take into account the \r\ndiverse social, cultural and value systems of various \r\nsocieties or linking such notions to development \r\nassistance and programmes. \r\n Egypt hopes that joint efforts will continue to \r\nstrengthen the cooperative approach of the \r\ninternational community in addressing all human rights \r\nissues, based on mutual respect, commitment to \r\nequality in terms of rights and duties, compliance with \r\nthe principles of international law and complementarity \r\nbetween international human rights law and \r\ninternational humanitarian law. Thus, the Council will \r\nbe able to fully play its desired role and carry out its \r\nlofty mission, thereby strengthening our collective \r\nefforts to consolidate universal respect for the human \r\nrights of all, without exception. \r\n Ms. Shalev (Israel): Last year, the world \r\ncelebrated the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights. That noble document \r\nreaffirmed faith in fundamental human rights, in the \r\ndignity and worth of the human person and in the equal \r\nrights of men and women. Its principles and standards \r\nwere meant to guide the work of the United Nations \r\nand lead us to a better future.  \r\n Eleanor Roosevelt, René Cassin, John Humphrey, \r\nP. C. Chang and Charles Malik, among other authors of \r\nthe Universal Declaration, believed that a better world \r\nwas both necessary and possible. In the words of \r\nEleanor Roosevelt, “We stand today at the threshold of \r\na great event both in the life of the United Nations and \r\nin the life of mankind”. Yet, as we consider today the \r\nreport of the Human Rights Council (A/64/53), it is \r\nregrettable that the work of the Council has strayed far \r\nfrom the principles it was mandated to uphold.  \r\n A/64/PV.31\r\n \r\n9 09-58708 \r\n \r\n The Human Rights Council, according to its own \r\nfounding documents, must base its work on the \r\nprinciples of universality, impartiality, objectivity and \r\nnon-selectivity, without distinction of any kind and in a \r\nfair and equal manner. Instead of upholding those \r\nvalues, however, the Council has demonstrated an \r\nobsessive preoccupation with Israel during the three \r\nand a half years of its work.  \r\n Israel is the only country in the world that is \r\nsingled out in a discriminatory manner by the Council’s \r\nagenda. Half of the Council’s special sessions have \r\nbeen held to condemn Israel. The Council has adopted \r\nmore resolutions and decisions against Israel than on \r\nall other United Nations Member States put together. \r\nWhile the Council has reviewed and revised the \r\nmandate of nearly every special procedure, it refuses to \r\nreview its grossly one-sided mandate concerning our \r\nregion. And the Council continues to dispatch so-called \r\nfact-finding missions that are mandated to denounce \r\nevery Israeli action, irrespective of the facts on the \r\nground and the ongoing terrorism facing Israel on a \r\ndaily basis.  \r\n Is this the work of a Human Rights Council that \r\nis impartial? Is this the work of a Council that is \r\nobjective? Unlike some members of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, Israel is a democracy that respects fundamental \r\nfreedoms, protects a vibrant press and possesses an \r\nindependent judiciary. Nevertheless, it is repeatedly \r\ncondemned by the Council. These repeated unjustified \r\ncondemnations do not help to protect human rights. \r\n Around the world, true victims of the most severe \r\nviolations of their most basic rights cry out for their \r\nplight to be heard and for their suffering to be redressed \r\nby the international community. But the Council is \r\nsilent. As innocent Israeli men, women and children \r\nsuffer relentless suicide terrorism and terrorist attacks, \r\nthe Council chooses to say nothing. Is this the work of \r\na Human Rights Council that reflects universality? The \r\nwork of the Council is neither constructive nor fair nor \r\nimpartial. \r\n The report before us today reminds us all that the \r\nHuman Rights Council is increasingly manipulated and \r\nexploited by some of its members and their obsession \r\nwith demonizing Israel and demeaning its democratic \r\nnature. \r\n In 2005, Kofi Annan acknowledged that a \r\ncredibility deficit existed within United Nations human \r\nrights institutions. Yet today, that deficit is not a relic \r\nof the past; it is a fixture of the present. The longer it \r\ntakes to rectify this injustice, the greater the damage \r\nwill be to the integrity and legitimacy of the Council \r\nand the wider United Nations system. \r\n Mr. Vigny (Switzerland) (spoke in French): My \r\ndelegation wishes to thank the President of the Human \r\nRights Council for the report on the Council’s activities \r\n(A/64/53). It lists the outcomes of two regular \r\nsessions — including more than 40 resolutions and 32 \r\ndecisions on universal periodic reviews — and four \r\nspecial sessions, one of which was a special thematic \r\nsession. \r\n My statement will address five key issues. \r\n First, the Council is now working at full speed. A \r\nsignificant number of resolutions have been adopted on \r\nsubjects ranging from child protection and climate \r\nchange to human rights education and training. The \r\nregular sessions are followed by meetings of the \r\nWorking Group on the Universal Periodic Review and \r\nof the Social Forum. In addition, this year saw \r\npreparatory meetings for the Durban Review \r\nConference, held in Geneva in April. Given this \r\nincreasing number of meetings, the Council should \r\nboth endeavour to streamline the activities of certain \r\nworking groups and better distribute its workload \r\namong its three annual sessions. Switzerland is willing \r\nto study in depth the issue of the Council’s programme \r\nof work in Geneva. \r\n The Council is developing best practices for its \r\nworking methods, and there are examples of fruitful \r\ntransregional cooperation. We are thinking in particular \r\nof cooperation on human rights education and training \r\nwithin the Platform for Human Rights Education and \r\nTraining, which now includes representatives from all \r\nregional groups: Morocco, Switzerland, Costa Rica, \r\nItaly, the Philippines, Slovenia and Senegal. I should \r\nalso like to mention the cooperation between Germany \r\nand the Philippines on the issue of human trafficking. \r\nThose two nations — one a country of destination and \r\nthe other a country of origin — have joined efforts to \r\nprotect the human rights of the same persons, the same \r\nvictims. Even in notoriously difficult areas, such as \r\nfreedom of expression, considerable progress has been \r\nmade through the adoption by consensus of a \r\nresolution on the subject, jointly sponsored by the \r\nUnited States and Egypt. \r\n Thirdly, the Human Rights Council must be able \r\nto deal appropriately with specific situations, and \r\nA/64/PV.31  \r\n \r\n09-58708 10 \r\n \r\nconcerted efforts are needed to fulfil and build on its \r\nmandate under General Assembly resolution 60/251, be \r\nit in addressing situations of gross and systematic \r\nviolations of human rights, responding promptly to \r\nemergencies, or preventing such violations from \r\noccurring. Switzerland considers the development of \r\nthis potential to be a priority and consequently pledges \r\nits commitment to this end. \r\n Moreover, Switzerland is convinced that \r\nstrengthening the presidency of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil is necessary in order to better tackle the \r\npolitical and operational questions the president faces. \r\nFor that reason, Switzerland has decided to present a \r\ndraft decision in the Third Committee of the General \r\nAssembly as a follow-up to a decision adopted by the \r\nCouncil in September of last year. \r\n Finally, I would like to return to relations \r\nbetween the Council and the General Assembly, \r\nparticularly in light of the forthcoming discussion on \r\nCouncil review. There is still no clear-cut vision with \r\nregard to the allocation of responsibilities between the \r\nCouncil and the General Assembly and its Third \r\nCommittee. Switzerland would like to enhance the \r\ncomplementarities between these two bodies by \r\nimproving cooperation and thus reducing existing \r\nduplication. Given its universal membership, the \r\nGeneral Assembly should be used first and foremost as \r\na general frame of reference and, as such, should play a \r\nprogramme-based, standard-setting role. The Human \r\nRights Council, for its part, should strengthen the \r\noperational role it plays in implementing the political \r\ncommitments pledged by Member States pursuant to \r\ntheir international legal obligations. \r\n Mr. Balé (Congo) (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof my delegation I would like to thank you, \r\nMr. President, for organizing this important debate on \r\nthe report of the Human Rights Council (A/64/53), the \r\nreport of a body whose deliberations and decisions \r\nhave an undoubted impact on the life of our \r\nOrganization. I would also like to thank the President \r\nof the Council for his presentation of the report. \r\n To begin with, we feel we must appropriately \r\nacknowledge the fact that, notwithstanding the \r\nmisgivings that existed at the time of the birth of the \r\nHuman Rights Council in 2006, the Council nonetheless, \r\nday by day, session by session, provides a useful \r\ndoctrine for effective action promoting and protecting \r\nhuman rights, irrespective of its controversial aspects. \r\nMy delegation can only welcome such a development, \r\nwhich should encourage proper support for the Council. \r\nWe also extend our congratulations to the Office of the \r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights, as well as the \r\nmandate-holders, the rapporteurs, special representatives \r\nand independent experts, whose relationship allows us \r\nto improve and pursue our endeavours in support of all \r\nhuman rights. \r\n Going beyond a general assessment of the work \r\nof the Human Rights Council and the mechanisms it \r\nhas generated, my delegation would like to make a \r\nnumber of comments. The Human Rights Council \r\nshoulders important responsibilities in promoting and \r\nprotecting human rights around the world. The diverse \r\ncontributions of the members and non-member States \r\nof the Council, as well as of the institutions of the \r\nUnited Nations system and civil society, mean that we \r\ncan glimpse a world in which the universalism of \r\nhuman rights and their interdependence are daily \r\nbecoming a fact of life. This dynamic should be a \r\ncomponent of progress, in understanding and analysing \r\nhuman rights situations in a world marked by multiple \r\ncrises that jeopardize international peace and security \r\nand hamper development efforts, particularly in \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals. \r\n In this context, my delegation commends the \r\nHuman Rights Council’s efforts to strengthen, through \r\na multilateral approach, cooperation in the area of \r\nhuman rights. Food security, which is the corollary to \r\nthe right to food, as well as the various resolutions \r\nregarding the effects of foreign debt and States’ related \r\ninternational financial obligations on people’s full \r\nexercise of human rights, are undoubtedly essential to \r\nupholding economic, social and cultural rights. My \r\ndelegation remains concerned, in this regard, about the \r\nrepercussions of the economic and financial crisis on \r\nthe universal attainment and effective exercise of \r\nhuman rights. \r\n Violence and discrimination against the most \r\nvulnerable, especially women, children, the disabled \r\nand migrants, should also continue to be part of the \r\nHuman Rights Council’s work. We welcome the annual \r\nDay on Women’s Rights, held in Geneva on 4 June, a \r\nkey moment in raising awareness of the difficult plight \r\nof women in some parts of the world, particularly in \r\ndeveloping countries. The celebration of the fifteenth \r\nanniversary of the Beijing Conference on Women \r\nshould, we hope, be a new landmark in the fight to \r\n A/64/PV.31\r\n \r\n11 09-58708 \r\n \r\nabolish laws that institutionalize discrimination against \r\nwomen. \r\n In this regard, the Republic of the Congo, through \r\nits relevant national bodies, is reviewing a bill aimed at \r\ncombating violence against women. With respect to the \r\nprotection of children, my country has just deposited \r\nthe instruments of accession to the Optional Protocol to \r\nthe Convention on the Rights of the Child on the \r\ninvolvement of children in armed conflict and the sale \r\nof children, child prostitution and pornography. As to \r\nmigrants, we note with horror the conditions to which \r\nthey are subjected in their countries of destination or \r\ntransit after they have risked their lives to leave their \r\ncountries of origin. \r\n Another intolerable form of discrimination is that \r\nrelated to racism and racial intolerance. In this regard, \r\nmy delegation welcomes the success of the deliberations \r\nof the Durban Review Conference on racism, racial \r\ndiscrimination, xenophobia and intolerance. The \r\nConference, held in Geneva from 20 to 24 April, \r\nadopted a platform for a new departure in the fight \r\nagainst racism and its modern manifestations. It was an \r\nedifying example of collective, concerted action by \r\nStates, as well as testimony to what their common \r\ncommitment can achieve in tackling the urgent \r\nchallenges facing human rights. While we welcome the \r\nextension for three more years of the mandate of the \r\nIntergovernmental Working Group on the implementation \r\nof the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action — \r\nand, indeed, we commend the arduous work it has \r\nalready done — we call for the formulation of additional \r\nstandards for the International Convention on the \r\nElimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. \r\n One of the major innovations related to the \r\ncreation of the Human Rights Council was the \r\nestablishment of the universal periodic review \r\nmechanism, which to this day functions effectively and \r\nis achieving results. The universal periodic review was \r\nestablished, we should remember, in order, among \r\nother things, to avoid the kind of disputes that arise \r\nwhen countries, whose situations are reviewed, often \r\nare factors in confrontation. This mechanism allows the \r\nCouncil to review, without distinction, human rights \r\nsituations in all countries, and to make recommendations \r\nwith a view to their eventual improvement. \r\n For its part, the Republic of the Congo is resolved \r\nto intensify its efforts to promote and protect human \r\nrights, and submitted to this review exercise, held from \r\n6 to 8 May. Out of 59 recommendations made \r\nfollowing the review, we consented to 50, while the \r\nremaining nine were irrelevant, having already been \r\ndealt with in Congolese law. The Congolese Government \r\nis endeavouring to implement these recommendations \r\nand to refocus its work in some sectors which have not \r\nreceived major attention until now.  \r\n In this context, the accreditation procedure for our \r\nnational human rights commission has been organized \r\nunder the aegis of the International Coordinating \r\nCommittee of National Human Rights Institutions, and \r\ncontact with its accreditation subcommittee has proved \r\nfruitful. Moreover, the Congolese Government, despite \r\nits difficult financial situation, has pledged to allot \r\nadequate appropriations for the National Human Rights \r\nCommission, an independent constitutional body, so \r\nthat it may discharge its mandate efficiently. Efforts to \r\npromote and protect human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms are carried out in the schools through \r\nprogrammes of education in civics, ethics and peace, \r\nwhich represent a new demand on Congolese society.  \r\n The midterm evaluation in the universal periodic \r\nreview last month of commitments undertaken proved \r\nto be fruitful and, in a closed meeting during its \r\neleventh session, the Council adopted the decision to \r\nend the review of the human rights situation in the \r\nRepublic of the Congo. Certainly that is cause for \r\ngenuine satisfaction. Still, the Congo, anxious to build \r\na modern State predicated on respect for law and \r\ndemocratic rules, will continue to endeavour, insofar as \r\npossible, along with national and international partners, \r\nto effectively promote and protect human rights and \r\nhuman beings. \r\n Mr. Ali (Malaysia): At the outset, my delegation \r\nwishes to extend our appreciation to the Human Rights \r\nCouncil for its report, as contained in document \r\nA/64/53. \r\n We reaffirm that human rights are universal, \r\nindivisible, interdependent and interrelated. The \r\ninternational community must treat human rights \r\nglobally in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing \r\nand with the same emphasis. Those basic principles \r\nunderpin international human rights. Countries should \r\nnot continue to pick and choose which rights they wish \r\nto emphasize or how those rights may be enjoyed, nor \r\nshould they seek to impose on others a differing \r\nemphasis or urgency to human rights based on their \r\nown domestic political expediency or external pressures. \r\nA/64/PV.31  \r\n \r\n09-58708 12 \r\n \r\n Malaysia is pleased that the Council, within the \r\nscope of General Assembly resolution 60/251, and \r\nwithin the institution-building mechanism in Human \r\nRights Council resolution 5/1, has continued to \r\ndevelop. It is our hope that the work undertaken by the \r\nCouncil on a range of issues will lead to tangible \r\nresults in the promotion and protection of all human \r\nrights. The discussions within the Council are, in our \r\nview, a healthy process towards realizing the highest \r\nstandards of human rights as enshrined in the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights. \r\n We are pleased to note that the vast majority of \r\nthe United Nations membership is supportive of the \r\nwork of the Human Rights Council, especially in \r\nensuring that the Council avoids the mistakes of the \r\nprevious Commission on Human Rights that became at \r\ntimes highly politicized, and which practiced selectivity \r\nand double standards.  \r\n We welcome the decision by the United States to \r\nengage in the Council. Supporting the Council \r\nconstructively is a much more positive approach to \r\nensure the promotion and protection of all human \r\nrights. While we may disagree on issues and even the \r\nprocesses within the Council, that is the better \r\nproposition. It would be disheartening if criticisms that \r\nwere once applied to the Commission were now \r\nlevelled against the Council without allowing it to \r\nfurther develop. Moreover, to function effectively, the \r\nCouncil needs to be given the necessary support and \r\nresources. \r\n With the review of the Council due by 2011, \r\nMalaysia is encouraged by the proactive steps taken by \r\nmembers of the Council to establish a framework for \r\nthe review process, as decided at its twelfth regular \r\nsession. In our view, the resolution adopted by the \r\nCouncil will allow sufficient time for all delegations to \r\nundertake early preparations aimed at achieving a \r\nfruitful and mutually acceptable review of the Council \r\nso as to ensure its role as the premier multilateral \r\ninstitution charged with advancing the promotion and \r\nprotection of all human rights across the world. \r\n We wish to touch upon a number of issues related \r\nto the work of the Council. With regard to the universal \r\nperiodic review, Malaysia is of the view that the review \r\nprocess provides an important non-confrontational, \r\nobjective, transparent and universal platform for \r\ndialogue on the promotion and protection of all human \r\nrights, which complements and adds value to the work \r\nof the Council in fulfilling its mandate as envisaged by \r\nresolution 60/251.  \r\n On the whole, the international community has \r\nresponded positively and demonstrated commendable \r\nconstructive engagement with the review process. With \r\na view to enhancing and widening the gains achieved \r\nthus far, it is crucial that the General Assembly \r\ncontinue to ensure that adequate material, financial and \r\nother resources are allocated for the smooth functioning \r\nof the review process. While there remain areas that \r\ncan be further developed and strengthened, this \r\ninnovation represents a good alternative to country-\r\nspecific resolutions here in the General Assembly. The \r\nreview serves as a constructive approach through \r\ngenuine dialogue and cooperation among countries that \r\nmay have differing views and systems, and it is our \r\nhope that through the review process, all countries will \r\nseize the opportunity to improve the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights in a cooperative and \r\nconstructive manner. \r\n Ms. Štiglic (Slovenia), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n Malaysia takes this opportunity to reaffirm its \r\nbelief in the importance of the work and independence \r\nof the Special Procedures mandate-holders. That said, \r\nwe also believe that, given the sensitive nature of the \r\nvarious mandates, the mandate-holders must themselves \r\nexercise responsibility and sensitivity in discharging \r\ntheir respective mandates. The ability of mandate-\r\nholders to effectively exercise their functions rests on \r\ntheir ability to adhere to the Code of Conduct for \r\nSpecial Procedures Mandate-holders of the Human \r\nRights Council. In our view, recent examples whereby \r\nseveral mandate-holders had attempted to reinterpret or \r\ndepart from their mandates as decided by the \r\ninternational community could undermine confidence \r\nin the mandate-holders themselves, thereby impacting \r\nnegatively on their ability to contribute effectively to \r\nthe promotion and protection of human rights. In this \r\nregard, we welcome the Council’s resolution 11/11, on \r\nthe system of special procedures. \r\n Malaysia supports the views expressed during the \r\neleventh regular session last June by the Special \r\nRapporteur on the situation of human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms of indigenous people, which \r\nincluded the need for enhanced coordination and \r\ncooperation among all the human rights mechanisms \r\ndealing with indigenous issues within the United \r\n A/64/PV.31\r\n \r\n13 09-58708 \r\n \r\nNations system. Such coordination would help to avoid \r\nduplication within the United Nations indigenous issues \r\nstructure, provide coherence to the roles and \r\nresponsibilities of the Special Rapporteur, the Permanent \r\nForum on Indigenous Issues and the Expert Mechanism \r\non the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and ensure \r\neffectiveness and efficiency. \r\n We also look forward to the successful conclusion \r\nof the work of the High Commissioner for Human \r\nRights, and the work being undertaken by the ad hoc \r\ncommittee on the elaboration of complementary \r\ninternational standards to study the interface between \r\nreligion and other forms of discrimination. \r\n On a final note, I wish to remind members that \r\nMalaysia is seeking election to the Human Rights \r\nCouncil for the period 2010 to 2013 at the elections to \r\nbe held in May 2010. Malaysia was a founding member \r\nof the Human Rights Council from 2006 to 2009; if \r\nagain elected as a member, Malaysia will strive to \r\nensure that the Council remains a credible, effective \r\nand just body entrusted with the responsibility of \r\npromoting and protecting the human rights of all people. \r\n Mr. Badji (Senegal) (spoke in French): I would \r\nlike to thank and congratulate Ambassador Alex van \r\nMeeuwen of Belgium, President of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, for the outstanding presentation he has given \r\nof the report of the Council, and to state that the \r\nconsideration of the report (A/64/53) is for my \r\ndelegation a welcome opportunity to express its great \r\nappreciation of the positive results achieved by that \r\nbody and to restate its commitment to dialogue and \r\ncooperation as guiding principles of our work in its \r\nranks. \r\n At this time of crisis when the most optimistic \r\nminds are filled with doubt and uncertainty, the \r\ninvaluable contribution of the Human Rights Council \r\nto protecting basic values such as tolerance, intercultural \r\ndialogue and responsible freedom of expression is a \r\nsource of hope and reassurance. \r\n In only four years of existence, the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, thanks to the joint effort of its members and \r\nthe support of the entire international community, has \r\nbeen able to dispel doubts about its ability to respond \r\nto questioning of its mandates by constantly enhancing \r\nthe way it functions so as to make it more effective and \r\nmore efficient. In the context of that positive dynamic, \r\nit is fitting to note the recent thematic panels on \r\nintercultural dialogue, human rights, women’s rights, \r\nclimate change and also the human rights of migrants \r\nin detention centres, which have been highlights of in-\r\ndepth and enlightening debates. Such steps, which gave \r\nrise to very welcome joint initiatives, such as that of \r\nEgypt and the United States of America at the twelfth \r\nregular session on the freedom of expression, are to be \r\nencouraged in future work. \r\n In co-sponsoring the important resolution on \r\nfreedom of expression, Senegal wished to reiterate its \r\nbelief that the promotion of tolerance and responsible \r\nfreedom of expression is essential in the fight against \r\nracism and discrimination. Thanks to that cooperation \r\nand to the mobilization and flexibility of all \r\nstakeholders, the Council was able to meet the challenge \r\nby successfully holding, in April 2009, the Durban \r\nReview Conference on racism, racial discrimination, \r\nxenophobia and related intolerance. The outcome \r\ndocument, adopted by consensus, provides promising \r\nprospects for fighting such scourges, and its full \r\nimplementation should continue to galvanize us. \r\n The broadening of the spectrum of the Human \r\nRights Council’s composition, moreover, perfectly \r\nreflects recognition of the significant progress made by \r\nthat body in such a short time, since, as the famous \r\nFrench writer Corneille said, “In souls nobly born, \r\nvalour does not depend upon age.” \r\n However, far from engendering in us a paralysing \r\nattitude of blind self-satisfaction, those more than \r\nheartening results of the Human Rights Council should \r\nprompt us to step up our efforts to strengthen that body, \r\nwhich, thanks to its contribution, gives rise to the hope \r\nof a promising outlook in protecting and promoting \r\nhuman rights. In that context, the Council should \r\nbolster its action to promote intercultural dialogue and \r\nhuman rights education, which could greatly contribute \r\nto attaining the goal of a world free of prejudice and \r\nmutual fear. Likewise, the fight against poverty, which \r\nis a major hurdle for a large part of humankind, \r\ndeserves special attention in the Council’s work. \r\n The more-than-encouraging way in which the \r\nuniversal periodic review operates is another source of \r\ngenuine satisfaction for all those who, by pooling their \r\nefforts, have made it possible for that mechanism to \r\nestablish an objective, constructive and transparent \r\ndialogue among the various actors and thus to \r\ncontribute to strengthening the credibility of the \r\nHuman Rights Council. In fact, the positive impact of \r\nthat mechanism in protecting and promoting human \r\nA/64/PV.31  \r\n \r\n09-58708 14 \r\n \r\nrights can be gauged only by how effectively its \r\nrecommendations are implemented. In that regard, I am \r\npleased to recall that my country, in a spirit of dialogue \r\nand openness, underwent the universal periodic review \r\non 6 February 2009 and is already striving to \r\nimplement the undertakings into which it voluntarily \r\nentered.  \r\n Thus, to strengthen its cooperation with the \r\nCouncil’s special procedures system, Senegal hosted \r\nthe Special Rapporteur on the Human Rights of \r\nMigrant Workers in August 2009 and the Working \r\nGroup on Arbitrary Detention in September. Similarly, \r\na third mandate-holder, addressing the sale of children, \r\nhas been visiting my country since 21 October for a \r\nperiod of 10 days. In that field, as in others, Senegal, \r\nfaithful to the commitments that earned it the \r\nconfidence of United Nations Member States, which \r\nelected it to the Human Rights Council for a second \r\nterm, will continue its efforts at the national, regional \r\nand international levels. \r\n To conclude, I would like to welcome the \r\nadoption by the Human Rights Council of its resolution \r\n11/12, extending the mandate of the Intergovernmental \r\nWorking Group to review the work and functioning of \r\nthe Council five years after its establishment, as, \r\nmoreover, is stipulated in General Assembly resolution \r\n60/251. Thus the review of the functioning of the \r\nHuman Rights Council in 2011 should, in our view, be \r\nan opportunity for an objective assessment of that \r\norgan, with a view to making, where needed, the \r\nnecessary adjustments to better address the challenges \r\nthat continue to arise in protecting and promoting \r\nhuman rights. \r\n Mr. Heller (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): My \r\ndelegation would like to thank the President of the \r\nHuman Rights Council for presenting its report \r\n(A/64/53) to the General Assembly, given the \r\nimportance that it gives to the protection and \r\npromotion of human rights as one of the pillars of our \r\nOrganization. We welcome the report on the activities \r\nof the Human Rights Council, which covers the work \r\nof that organ between September 2008 and June 2009. \r\nMexico is fully committed to the strengthening of the \r\nHuman Rights Council as the organ par excellence in \r\nthe Organization responsible for promoting and \r\nprotecting human rights. \r\n In the period covered by the report, the human \r\nrights situation in Mexico was reviewed under the \r\nuniversal periodic review mechanism. My country \r\nparticipated very seriously and responsibly in that \r\nreview. It committed itself to following up on the \r\nrecommendations received and accepted under that \r\nmechanism in three spheres: the national human rights \r\nprogramme, in the context of the cooperation \r\nagreement that Mexico has with the Office of the High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights, and in our ongoing \r\ndialogue with civil society within the framework of the \r\nCommission on Government Policy on Human Rights. \r\n We are convinced of the usefulness of this \r\ninnovative mechanism as a tool for comprehensively \r\nevaluating goals that constructively seeks to improve \r\nhuman rights in all the countries of the world. In that \r\neffort to protect human rights, the Council, through the \r\nuniversal periodic review, has already considered the \r\nsituation in nearly 80 countries in every region of the \r\nworld.  \r\n This year, the Council has continued to carry out \r\nits normative work. In that regard, I should like to \r\npoint out the adoption of Guidelines for the Alternative \r\nCare of Children and the establishment of an open-\r\nended working group to draft an optional protocol to \r\nthe Convention on the Rights of the Child to provide a \r\ncommunications procedure. With regard to strengthening \r\nthe system of special procedures, I would underscore \r\nthe establishment of the post of the independent expert \r\nin the area of human rights. We therefore have at our \r\ndisposal today a host of 39 procedures to promote an \r\nagenda for the protection of human rights in the \r\ncontext of their respective mandates. \r\n Moreover, as part of the Council’s innovative \r\nworking methods, thematic panels have been held on the \r\nissues of the rights of children, of women, of disabled \r\npersons and of migrants being held in detention \r\ncentres. The thematic discussions and the exchange of \r\nviews with experts have benefited the Council’s work. \r\n Two fundamental changes in the work of the \r\nHuman Rights Council should be made in 2011. The \r\nfirst pertains to issues associated with the Council’s \r\nwork and functioning. The second, which necessarily \r\nwill involve the General Assembly, has to do with the \r\nstatus of the Council itself within the Organization. We \r\nconsider it crucially important that both of those \r\nelements, which are part of the same process, should \r\nlead to genuine strengthening of the Council so that it \r\nwill be in a position to fully carry out the important \r\nmandate for which it was established. The Government \r\n A/64/PV.31\r\n \r\n15 09-58708 \r\n \r\nof Mexico believes that the revisions to be made in \r\n2011 will be a unique opportunity to strengthen the \r\nCouncil’s working methods and move towards a \r\ngenuine culture of dialogue and good practices that \r\nwill bolster the enjoyment of all human rights \r\nthroughout the entire world. We would like to express \r\nour full commitment to contribute constructively to the \r\nworking group that the Council has established to \r\nbegin that process. \r\n Lastly, Mexico is pleased to have been re-elected \r\nas a member of this important body last May. We are \r\ntherefore even more committed to continue to work \r\nactively and collectively in the Human Rights Council. \r\n Mr. Al Habib (Islamic Republic of Iran): I would \r\nlike to express my appreciation to the Human Rights \r\nCouncil for its report contained in document A/64/53. I \r\nwould also like to welcome the statement made in the \r\nGeneral Assembly by the President of the Human \r\nRights Council. \r\n The Council has done a commendable job over \r\nthe past four years in building and establishing the \r\nappropriate mechanisms and subsidiary bodies to fulfil \r\nthe mandates given to it by resolution 60/251. One of \r\nthe priorities in the new phase of United Nations \r\nhuman rights machinery has been to approach human \r\nrights issues in a comprehensive, cooperative and \r\nconstructive manner. To meet such expectations, the \r\nHuman Rights Council must act as a focal point of \r\nreliance, hope and participation for all peoples and \r\nGovernments so as to address global human rights \r\nchallenges. It also ought to be a forum for dialogue, \r\nunderstanding and cooperation. \r\n The universality of human rights and their \r\ninterdependence and indivisibility require that all \r\nrights be given equal status. As such, economic, social \r\nand cultural rights should be given the same importance \r\nas civil and political rights. The creation of new \r\nmandates focused on economic, social and cultural \r\nrights and the holding of panel discussions on a \r\nnumber of important subjects are worthy achievements \r\nof the Council. However, there is a need for more \r\neffective mechanisms to reinforce and support cultural \r\nrights. Operational steps are needed to further strengthen \r\nthe right to development and other collective rights. \r\n While the process of setting standards in the \r\nHuman Rights Council is ongoing, it should be \r\nunderlined that cultural diversity must be at the centre \r\nof any attempt to create human rights instruments, as \r\nsuch an approach would help to prevent hegemony and \r\nwill enrich the universality of human rights. \r\n The pervasiveness of poverty and the increase in \r\ninequality between countries, which have mainly been \r\ncaused by unfavourable international economic \r\nconditions, remain daunting challenges facing \r\ndeveloping countries and undermine their efforts to \r\npromote human rights. Moreover, the spread of \r\nintolerance, certain misconceptions on the right to the \r\nfreedom of expression and the lack of an ethics code of \r\nconduct for media still stand in the way of the effective \r\nimplementation of all human rights for all. They also \r\ninfringe upon the rights of some sectors of society. \r\n On the other hand, the world is still witnessing \r\nattempts on the part of a few who wish to impose their \r\nown views and interpretations on the application of \r\ncertain internationally agreed concepts and standards. \r\nThe Human Rights Council should confront such \r\nattempts by designing innovative approaches. \r\n We are of the opinion that it would be extremely \r\nnecessary for the Third Committee, as is its \r\nprerogative, to pay greater attention to its designated \r\nwork and mandate and that of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. In principle, the General Assembly’s Third \r\nCommittee should primarily focus on policy-oriented \r\ndeliberations and discussions to provide strategic \r\npolicy recommendations to the Assembly, which in turn \r\ncan guide the international community, in particular the \r\nHuman Rights Council, in further enhancing the \r\npromotion and protection of all human rights. \r\n One of the real challenges before the Council is \r\nto ensure that its monitoring system works truly as a \r\nuniversal mechanism to address human rights situations \r\nworldwide. That will require the Council to adopt a \r\nbalanced and integrated approach and enforce a unified \r\nset of criteria and terms of reference in all situations \r\nalike. \r\n In that respect, the universal periodic review \r\nmechanism constitutes a breakthrough in the work of \r\nUnited Nations intergovernmental human rights \r\nactivities. The purpose of the mechanism is to ensure \r\nuniversality, objectivity, non-selectivity and impartiality \r\nin the work of the United Nations human rights \r\nmachinery. Logically speaking, if it works as intended, \r\nthat instrument should allow the human rights \r\nmachinery to act beyond political interests and \r\nambitions. We appreciate the degree of transparency \r\nand the constructive examination of situations that took \r\nA/64/PV.31  \r\n \r\n09-58708 16 \r\n \r\nplace during the universal periodic review in the \r\ncontext of discussing challenges ahead, acknowledging \r\nthat there is always room for improvement in any State. \r\n According to the timetable of the Working Group \r\non the Universal Periodic Review, the national report \r\nof the Islamic Republic of Iran will be considered \r\nduring the Group’s fourteenth session, in February 2010. \r\nMy Government has made comprehensive arrangements \r\nwith all national stakeholders, including governmental \r\nand non-governmental institutions, to draw up and \r\nsubmit the national report for the consideration of the \r\nWorking Group. My country is fully committed and \r\nready to engage constructively and cooperatively with \r\nother States when our national report is considered by \r\nthe Human Rights Council’s Working Group. \r\n Mr. Nirupam (India): Thank you very much, \r\nMadam, for giving me this opportunity to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly on the important issue of the report \r\nof the Human Rights Council (A/64/53). At the outset, \r\non behalf of my delegation, I would like to thank the \r\nPresident of the Human Rights Council for his report. \r\n My delegation notes positively the promise shown \r\nby the Human Rights Council since its inception, in \r\n2006, as the premier organ of the United Nations \r\ndealing with human rights. Considerable progress has \r\nbeen made in the past three years in strengthening its \r\ninstitutional mechanisms and reviewing, improving and \r\nrationalizing all mandates, mechanisms, functions and \r\nresponsibilities of the former Commission on Human \r\nRights. \r\n The strength of the Human Rights Council lies in \r\nits emphasis on dialogue, cooperation, transparency \r\nand non-selectivity in the promotion and protection of \r\nall human rights and fundamental freedoms for all. The \r\nenthusiastic participation of Member States in the \r\nuniversal periodic review process to date points in that \r\ndirection. It also underscores the success of that \r\ninnovative mechanism, which has provided a platform \r\nfor sharing national experiences and best practices in \r\nconsultation with, and with the consent of, the country \r\nconcerned. The importance of the universal periodic \r\nreview mechanism was rightly summed up by the \r\nSecretary-General when he said that “This mechanism \r\nhas great potential to promote and protect human rights \r\nin the darkest corners of the world”.  \r\n The holding of special sessions on thematic issues \r\nover the past year and a half attests to the wide-ranging \r\ndebate being conducted in the Council. We reiterate our \r\nfirm commitment to continue to engage constructively \r\nwith all Member States and to strive to make the \r\nCouncil more effective, responsive and efficient. We \r\nstrongly believe that the international community can \r\nadvance our common cause through dialogue and \r\ninteraction. \r\n The Human Rights Council is still evolving. It is \r\nimportant that we continue to provide collective \r\nguidance to the Council and help it mature. We should \r\nalso ensure that those efforts are inclusive and respect \r\nthe diversity in the historical national experiences, \r\ncultures and development of different countries. In that \r\nregard, we would like to state that we look forward to \r\nthe forthcoming review process of the functioning of \r\nthe Human Rights Council in 2011. \r\n Let me take this opportunity to also reaffirm our \r\ntrust in the work and independence of the special \r\nprocedures mandate-holders. While they have done \r\ncommendable work, it is important that they exercise \r\nresponsibility and be sensitive in discharging their \r\nrespective mandates. The Human Rights Council has \r\nprovided mandate-holders with a code of conduct, and \r\nit is important that it is adhered to. Any attempt to \r\nreinterpret the code of conduct or depart from their \r\nmandates would weaken the mandate-holders and the \r\nimportant functions entrusted to them by the Council. \r\nIn that regard, we welcome the adoption of Council \r\nresolution 11/11, on the system of special procedures. \r\n We are encouraged by the efforts of the Human \r\nRights Council to translate the right to development \r\ninto a reality. Discussions on the right to development \r\nare gradually moving away from the realm of theory \r\nand principles into that of the design, implementation \r\nand realization of policies. In that connection, we note \r\nthe significant contribution of the Working Group on \r\nthe Right to Development. \r\n The Council must play a central role in \r\ndenouncing terrorism, which poses the biggest threat to \r\nour common efforts towards peace, security and \r\ndevelopment. It also undermines the very foundations \r\nof freedom and democracy and the enjoyment of human \r\nrights, including the most important fundamental right \r\nof all, namely, the right to life. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to say that the work of \r\nthe Human Rights Council should proceed in a spirit of \r\ncooperation and mutual understanding. It should strive \r\nto promote human rights through international \r\ncooperation and genuine dialogue among Member \r\n A/64/PV.31\r\n \r\n17 09-58708 \r\n \r\nStates, including capacity-building and mutual assistance. \r\nIndia remains committed to making the Human Rights \r\nCouncil a strong, effective and efficient body that is \r\ncapable of promoting and protecting human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms for all. \r\n Mr. McLay (New Zealand): New Zealand is \r\npleased to welcome Ambassador van Meeuwen to New \r\nYork for the presentation of the report on the Human \r\nRights Council’s third year of operation (A/64/53). We \r\nacknowledge his contribution and that of his \r\npredecessor, Ambassador Martin Uhomoibhi. \r\n New Zealand firmly believes in the universality \r\nand indivisibility of human rights for all people and \r\nregards the Human Rights Council as the primary \r\nUnited Nations mechanism with responsibility for \r\nhuman rights. New Zealand wishes to see the Council \r\nfulfil the mandate with which it was entrusted by \r\nMember States, namely, to respond effectively and in a \r\ntimely manner to human rights situations while \r\npromoting open and inclusive dialogue and cooperation \r\nwith concerned countries. \r\n The third year of the Council’s operation has \r\nbeen an important one. In its first year, the Council laid \r\nsolid foundations through the adoption of the \r\ninstitution-building package. Last year, that was \r\nfollowed by the consolidation of those institutions and \r\nmechanisms. After that establishment phase, the third \r\nyear has been the Council’s first full year of work. In \r\nthat period, we have been encouraged to see some \r\npositive work in the Council that has contributed \r\ntowards the fulfilment of its mandate. In that regard, \r\nNew Zealand has welcomed the contribution of new \r\nmembers and has been pleased to see evidence of \r\nincreased cross-regional cooperation. \r\n Transparency is also important. We commend the \r\nCouncil for its use of webcasting and for other \r\nimprovements, such as the use of new technology to \r\ndistribute meeting alerts. \r\n Strong operational practices in the Council are \r\ncritical for the effective implementation of human \r\nrights. For that reason, New Zealand considers the \r\nsystem of independent special procedures, including \r\nthose on specific human rights situations, and the \r\nuniversal periodic review to be among the more \r\nvaluable components of the Council’s work. \r\n This year, New Zealand was pleased to undergo \r\nits own first universal periodic review. We look \r\nforward to the continuing evolution of the process, \r\nwhich we see as positively complementing other \r\nmechanisms, including country statements and treaty \r\nbody reporting. \r\n We particularly recognize the challenges faced by \r\nsmaller States in participating in the universal periodic \r\nreview process, especially those without representation \r\nin Geneva. In support of the review process, therefore, \r\nNew Zealand hosted a seminar earlier this year for \r\nPacific countries to exchange views and build the \r\nregion’s capacity to engage in the process. We are \r\npleased that those of our Pacific neighbours who have \r\nso far been reviewed have found the experience \r\npositive and rewarding. We look forward to others \r\nparticipating in the next review process round, in \r\nDecember. \r\n Despite some encouraging positive steps, New \r\nZealand remains convinced that much more needs to be \r\ndone. As the President said, the Council is not a perfect \r\ninstitution. The Council must intensify efforts to assist \r\nStates in their responsibility to address the gap between \r\nthe norms embodied in the core human rights \r\ninstruments and the reality faced by individuals. \r\nSpecifically, we urge member States of the Council, \r\npast and present, to reinvigorate their efforts to deliver \r\non the pledges they made upon their election to the \r\nCouncil. \r\n This year, the Council also addressed some \r\nimportant thematic issues. In that regard, New Zealand \r\nwas pleased to have co-led initiatives on the issues of \r\ndisabilities and maternal mortality. However, other \r\nimportant thematic issues have not received the \r\nattention they deserve, and others that have been taken \r\nup by the Council did not always add value to its work \r\nor promote human rights. \r\n New Zealand considers that being able to address \r\ncritical country situations in a timely and effective \r\nmanner is fundamental for the fulfilment of the \r\nCouncil’s mandate, and vital for its credibility. We \r\nwere pleased to observe a number of instances where \r\nthat has taken place this year. However, we regret that \r\nthere have been other situations where that has not \r\nhappened. \r\n We are also concerned that the Council can \r\nsometimes be selectively willing to condemn what it \r\nregards as human rights abuses in some places, while \r\nconveniently ignoring others that might be uncomfortably \r\nA/64/PV.31  \r\n \r\n09-58708 18 \r\n \r\ncloser to home. Greater consistency in that regard \r\nwould do much for the Council’s wider credibility. \r\n While it is still early in its existence, the \r\nforthcoming 2011 review of the Council could also \r\nprovide an opportunity for assessment and improvement \r\nof its working methods, taking into account the need \r\nfor the proper implementation of existing structures. In \r\nthat regard, we again urge the Council to move towards \r\na clearer and predictable annual programme of work. \r\nWe also believe that more can be done to increase the \r\neffectiveness of meeting time, especially for working \r\ngroups. \r\n The United Nations was established in 1945, in \r\npart in response to the human rights abuses of \r\npreceding years. New Zealand put its hand to that \r\noriginal establishment, has maintained its support for \r\nglobal respect of human rights and remains firmly \r\ncommitted to those ideals, both domestically and \r\ninternationally. But, for all that, we are under no \r\nillusions as to the nature and extent of the task that is \r\nstill at hand — a task that, in United Nations terms, \r\nbelongs with the Human Rights Council. We wish the \r\nCouncil well for the challenges ahead. They are many \r\nand they are real, but they must be taken up and \r\naddressed. That is why we worked for and supported \r\nthe Council’s establishment and why, despite any \r\nshortcomings, we continue to support it today. \r\n Ms. Blum (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nColombia has taken note of the report of the Human \r\nRights Council, contained in document A/64/53, which \r\nincludes the resolutions, decisions and presidential \r\nstatements adopted during its two regular sessions and \r\nfour special sessions. As we stressed yesterday in the \r\ndebate in the Third Committee, in those sessions the \r\nCouncil adopted important thematic resolutions that \r\ninclude new provisions to be taken into account in the \r\nrealization of political, civil, economic, social and \r\ncultural rights.  \r\n My delegation welcomes the work of the Council \r\non matters concerning the rights of children, the \r\nelimination of violence and discrimination against \r\nwomen, the response to various crimes that seriously \r\nimpair the enjoyment of human rights — such as \r\ntrafficking in persons and arbitrary arrests and \r\ndisappearances — and issues related to the right to \r\neducation and human rights training. Colombia, in its \r\ncapacity as an observer State in the Council, \r\nco-sponsored several of those initiatives and actively \r\nparticipated in the relevant consultations. \r\n Colombia has supported the reforms that have \r\nbeen implemented in the United Nations since 2006 \r\nwith regard to the system of bodies with mandates in \r\nthe area of human rights. My country believes that the \r\ncreation of the Human Rights Council, the establishment \r\nof the universal periodic review and the adoption of the \r\ncode of conduct governing the work of the special \r\nprocedures are fundamental achievements that make it \r\npossible to take concrete steps with regard to \r\ncooperation in the realization of human rights in \r\nvarious countries and regions. \r\n It is important that, in complying with its \r\nmandate, the Human Rights Council continue to \r\nstrengthen its working methods and decisions in \r\naccordance with the objectives and spirit that inspired \r\nthe Assembly to establish the Council. The Council \r\nshould continue to be strengthened as a body for \r\nconstructive international dialogue that promotes \r\ninternational cooperation in the protection of human \r\nrights. The principles of universality, impartiality, \r\nobjectivity and non-selectivity must at all times guide \r\nits work, as provided for by the Assembly in 2006. \r\nAdherence to those principles is a guarantee for \r\nenhancing the legitimacy and effectiveness of the \r\nCouncil in fulfilling its mandate. \r\n The universal periodic review has continued to \r\ndevelop, as reflected in the decisions referred to in the \r\nreport. Having voluntarily accepted the procedure, \r\nColombia’s review took place at the end of 2008. It is \r\nimportant that each State set up internal systems for the \r\nfollow-up to the implementation of the commitments \r\nmade under the review, so as to strengthen the \r\nlegitimacy of this tool in the future. My Government \r\nhas defined a national methodology for that purpose. \r\n It is important that future reports of the Council \r\ninclude more references with regard to the Council’s \r\ncontributions in areas that we believe are relevant in \r\nassessing the new institutional system on human rights. \r\nThat should include, for example, information related \r\nto contributions in the mainstreaming of human rights \r\nwithin the United Nations system; the strengthening of \r\nthe work of the Office of the High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights; the continuous review and formulation \r\nof increasingly coherent and organized objectives and \r\nmandates in the system of special procedures; \r\ncomplementary actions with the various existing \r\n A/64/PV.31\r\n \r\n19 09-58708 \r\n \r\nhuman rights institutional systems at the regional or \r\ncontinental levels and strengthening coherence among \r\nthe different human rights treaty bodies while taking \r\ninto account their respective mandates. \r\n The Council’s effectiveness could be increased if \r\nits efforts included particular priority on the goal of \r\nhelping to instil the culture of human rights at all \r\nlevels. Those activities must be promoted objectively, \r\navoiding the politicization in the approaches taken. \r\n Through dialogue and cooperation, the Council \r\nwill be able to strengthen its work for the promotion of \r\nhuman rights and to raise human rights awareness in \r\nthe policies of other multilateral bodies and in the work \r\nof relevant national institutions. It could also \r\nencourage the involvement of economic and corporate \r\nsectors, prompting their commitment to the principles \r\nof corporate social responsibility which contribute to \r\nthe enjoyment of human, environmental and social \r\nrights in various countries and regions. It may also, in \r\na more general way, foster constructive interaction \r\nwith civil society. My delegation hopes that in the \r\nwork of the Council, we will see progressively more \r\ntangible results on these fronts. \r\n It is equally important for the Council to move \r\nforward in analysing standards for monitoring the \r\nimplementation of the recommendations adopted in the \r\nfield of human rights by the various bodies of the \r\nUnited Nations system, including this General \r\nAssembly. That should always be carried out with the \r\nconviction that multilateralism and the broadest \r\npossible participation of all member States in decision-\r\nmaking processes are essential prerequisites for ensuring \r\ngreater effectiveness and legitimacy of decisions while, \r\nat the same time, fully reflecting the democratic values \r\nunderpinning the United Nations system. \r\n Ms. Plaisted (United States of America): Let me \r\njoin with others in welcoming the President of the \r\nHuman Rights Council to the Assembly and thanking \r\nhim for his report (A/64/53). \r\n The United States was honoured to take up its \r\nseat on the Human Rights Council for the first time this \r\nyear and, in the spirit of mutual respect, we look \r\nforward to continuing this work with our colleagues on \r\nthe Council, and the entire United Nations membership, \r\nto protect and promote human rights around the world. \r\n The United States decision to join the Human \r\nRights Council was not made lightly. It was based on a \r\nclear and hopeful vision of what we can accomplish \r\ntogether. This vision is not an American one, but one \r\nthat respects the aspirations embodied in the Universal \r\nDeclaration on Human Rights and the mandate of the \r\nCouncil itself. \r\n In his address to the General Assembly, President \r\nObama emphasized that respect for human rights and \r\ndemocracy is essential to sustained prosperity and \r\nlasting security. In his remarks last month, and in Cairo \r\nand Accra earlier in the year, President Obama \r\nprovided a direction for our approach to the Council’s \r\nwork which is guided by four tenets, as was outlined \r\nby Assistant Secretaries Grimmer and Posner during \r\nthe September session: the universality of human \r\nrights, dialogue among nations and people, principled \r\nengagement, and a fidelity to the truth. \r\n As others have noted, we approach the Council \r\nwilling to support what it does well, but also pledging \r\nto challenge actions that we believe undermine the \r\nCouncil’s effectiveness and its mandate. The United \r\nStates seeks to build partnerships in our efforts to listen \r\nand learn from one another and work to identify \r\ncommon ground. We will remain steadfast in our \r\nassertion that all Governments, including our own, are \r\nresponsible for ensuring the rights and freedoms \r\nspelled out in international human rights law. We \r\nbelieve the Human Rights Council must focus its work \r\non making a practical impact on respect for human \r\nrights, the betterment of the lives of victims and the \r\nprevention of abuses. \r\n It is with those views in mind that we approach \r\nthe Council’s report. Indeed, the breadth of work \r\ncovered by the Human Rights Council is tremendous — \r\nclose to 100 or more resolutions a year on any number \r\nof thematic areas, with multiple special sessions. The \r\nuniversal periodic review, multiple committee meetings, \r\nincluding the Ad Hoc Committee on the Elaboration of \r\nComplementary Standards — currently meeting in \r\nGeneva — only add to the enormous workload. \r\n As is true with any political body, as the United \r\nStates looks back at the activities undertaken by the \r\nHuman Rights Council over the past year, there is \r\nmuch we can agree with and much with which we \r\nwould take strong exception.  \r\n For example, in reviewing the Council’s report on \r\nits activities last year, the United States strongly \r\nsupported the Council’s considerable work on women’s \r\nissues, including resolutions on maternal mortality and \r\nA/64/PV.31  \r\n \r\n09-58708 20 \r\n \r\nviolence against women, as well as its emphasis on \r\ntrafficking in persons. We supported resolutions on \r\nSomalia and we worked diligently with others on the \r\nCouncil to try to forge agreement on sensitive and \r\ndifficult issues in the Sudan and in the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, to name just a few. \r\n We would be remiss not to point out that the \r\nreport, while including the Council’s successes, is also \r\na transparent reminder of its failings. We were \r\ndisappointed that the Council failed to seriously \r\naddress some of the most difficult and sensitive \r\nsituations, including the situation in Iran, to mention \r\njust one example. The Council’s failings also include \r\nthe continued one-sided treatment of Israel. There are \r\nmultiple resolutions within the report that target Israel, \r\nresolutions the United States could not support for \r\nmany reasons, but in large part because they attempt to \r\nisolate and criticize the Government of Israel with no \r\nmention of Hamas. \r\n As a member of the Council, the United States \r\nhopes to work in partnership with all Member States, \r\nand particularly with Council members, to strengthen \r\nthe Council’s work and impact in fulfilment of its \r\nmission. We look forward to working with the Human \r\nRights Council and the General Assembly to empower \r\nand strengthen the United Nations human rights \r\nmechanisms and to improve its — and our — ability to \r\nmake an impact around the world in order to better the \r\nlives of the world’s most vulnerable peoples. We \r\nbelieve the United Nations and Member States — and \r\nparticularly the victims of human rights violations \r\naround the world — deserve no less. \r\n Mr. Mohamed (Maldives): The Maldives \r\nwelcomes the report of the Human Rights Council \r\n(A/64/53), the pre-eminent body of the international \r\nhuman rights framework. I would also like to take this \r\nopportunity to express our sincere appreciation to \r\nAmbassador Alex van Meeuwen, President of the \r\nCouncil, and his predecessors, for the invaluable \r\ncontributions they have made to the work of the \r\nCouncil as it continues to strive for the better \r\nprotection and promotion of human rights worldwide. \r\n My delegation would like to congratulate the \r\nexcellent work the Council has carried out so far. We \r\nbelieve that, despite its young age, the Council has \r\nworked diligently in trying to meet our expectations in \r\nelevating human rights protection for all citizens of the \r\nworld. We also recognize the importance of the review \r\nof the Council in shaping its future work. It is \r\nimperative that, in reviewing the Council’s performance, \r\nwe pay due heed to maintaining our engagement and \r\ncommitment to upholding the very fundamentals on \r\nwhich the Council was established. \r\n The Maldives would like to take this opportunity \r\nto comment on Human Rights Council resolution 10/4, \r\non human rights and climate change, adopted during \r\nthe Council’s tenth regular session, and on the \r\nsubsequent panel on the subject held during the \r\neleventh session. The Maldives, the lead sponsor, was \r\npleased that Council resolution 10/4, which breaks \r\nimportant new ground in clarifying the complex and \r\nimportant relationship between climate change and \r\nhuman rights, was adopted by consensus and with \r\nalmost 90 sponsors.  \r\n The resolution makes clear that climate change \r\nimpacts have important negative implications, in both a \r\ndirect and indirect sense, for a range of internationally \r\nprotected human rights. Those implications fall most \r\nheavily on the most vulnerable countries and segments \r\nof society. The resolution also states that the current \r\nnegotiations on the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change, due to conclude in \r\nCopenhagen in December, must succeed in order for \r\nhuman rights to be protected, and that climate change \r\npolicy agreed at the negotiations must be implemented \r\nin a way that supports and does not undermine the full \r\nenjoyment of the human rights of all peoples. \r\n The operative part of resolution 10/4 called on \r\nthe Council to hold a dedicated interactive panel debate \r\non the relationship between climate change and human \r\nrights. That debate was convened during the eleventh \r\nsession in June. The Maldives found the debate an \r\nextremely worthwhile and productive exercise. We \r\nwere particularly delighted by the range of detailed \r\nviews and comments presented by States, experts and \r\nnon-governmental organizations. After listening \r\ncarefully to those views and comments, the Maldives is \r\nnow considering what next steps to take. In this regard, \r\nwe will also be informed by the merits of the outcome \r\nof December’s crucial climate change conference in \r\nCopenhagen. \r\n The Maldives also welcomes the Council’s \r\nadoption, during its tenth and eleventh sessions, of the \r\noutcomes of the universal periodic reviews of a number \r\nof small island developing States, including Bahamas, \r\nBarbados, Cape Verde, Tuvalu and Mauritius. We \r\n A/64/PV.31\r\n \r\n21 09-58708 \r\n \r\nwould like to congratulate those States on their \r\nsuccessful and productive reviews. The Maldives is a \r\nfirm supporter of the review process, which we believe \r\noffers an invaluable opportunity for small island States \r\nto engage in an open dialogue on ways to improve the \r\nenjoyment of human rights and also to access much \r\nneeded international capacity-building support.  \r\n At the same time, we are fully aware of the \r\npressures that the review process places on the \r\nadministrations of small island States, especially those \r\nStates that do not have permanent missions in Geneva. \r\nFor that reason the Maldives and a group of like-\r\nminded States have established a group of friends in \r\nGeneva to offer practical advice and support to States \r\nthat do not have a presence in Geneva, if those States \r\nso wish. The group of friends will contact all States in \r\nthat position ahead of their reviews. \r\n Mr. Saeed (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): I would \r\nlike to express the appreciation of my delegation for \r\nthe statement made by the President of the Human \r\nRights Council before the General Assembly, having \r\nspoken in the Third Committee last Thursday at the \r\nbeginning of deliberations on the report of the Human \r\nRights Council (A/64/53). My delegation would like to \r\nstress the importance of continuing the deliberations on \r\nthe Human Rights Council’s report in the General \r\nAssembly and the subsidiary bodies that deal with \r\nhuman rights. Indeed, the Human Rights Council is a \r\nsubsidiary organ of the General Assembly, as stipulated \r\nby its resolution 60/251, which established the Council.  \r\n The Third Committee, which is the technical \r\nbody authorized to discuss human rights issues, with a \r\nview to their promotion and protection, remains the \r\nmost appropriate forum to deal with the \r\nrecommendations and findings of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. The Council resolution, adopted by consensus \r\nthis past year, stipulates that the Council’s report \r\nshould be considered by the General Assembly and the \r\nThird Committee, with the latter dealing with the \r\nrecommendations contained in Council’s report. The \r\nresolution reflects all approaches and opinions relevant \r\nto the subject. We wholeheartedly support this \r\nconsensual resolution.  \r\n The Human Rights Council, as the report makes \r\nclear, is an important step in the process of considering \r\nhuman rights activities and reform in the United \r\nNations system, in light of the need to breathe new life \r\ninto this aspect of the work of the Organization. This \r\nwill bring it into line with the realities of our modern-\r\nday world after the passage of more than half a century \r\nsince the founding of the United Nations. The Human \r\nRights Council thus represents a new phase in the \r\ndevelopment and enhancement of human rights.  \r\n The Council was set up in a way that took \r\naccount of the shortcomings and malformations that \r\nexisted previously in the Human Rights Commission \r\nand that were reflected in its politicization, double \r\nstandards and selectivity. The former body was a \r\nmalleable instrument in the hands of certain Powers \r\nthat used it to serve their own purposes and agendas \r\nwhich ran counter to the noble objectives for which the \r\nbody had been established. The important work and the \r\nmeasures already taken by the Human Rights Council \r\nsince its creation three years ago, in the areas of \r\ninstitutionalization and study of the working methods \r\nof the previous Commission on Human Rights, paves \r\nthe way for a new era in the field of human rights, \r\nbased on constructive dialogue, international \r\ncooperation, the provision of technical assistance, and \r\nthe process of inclusiveness in dealing with human \r\nrights throughout the world. That is a new approach for \r\ntackling human rights issues, replacing the heavy \r\nlegacy of politicization, selectivity and double \r\nstandards that marked the Human Rights Commission.  \r\n My delegation is eager to see the Human Rights \r\nCouncil undertake more action, efforts and arrangements \r\nto strike the correct balance between cultural, economic \r\nand social rights, including the right to development, \r\non the one hand and political and civil rights on the \r\nother. Political and civil rights had been in the ascendant \r\nin the Human Rights Commission; the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, by contrast, must endeavour to promote, \r\nenhance and protect cultural, economic and social rights.  \r\n The universal periodic review process needs to \r\nconsider the human rights situation in all States on the \r\nbasis of dialogue and constructive cooperation. That is \r\na new hallmark of the Human Rights Council and a \r\nproject worthy of support and serious assessment to \r\ndevelop it and to provide it with technical assistance so \r\nit may continue and progress. We hope that this \r\npositive development will mark the end of the previous \r\nera of politicization and double standards, and we hope \r\nthat its results will put an end to the country-specific \r\nresolutions singling out one State, which would then go \r\nto the Third Committee — a process that does not \r\ncontribute to the promotion and protection of human \r\nrights but rather deepens confrontation, widens the \r\nA/64/PV.31  \r\n \r\n09-58708 22 \r\n \r\ncircle of politicization and selectivity and targets only \r\ndeveloping countries, and is not consistent with the \r\nnew spirit and approach of the Human Rights Council, \r\nfounded on a spirit of mutual understanding, dialogue \r\nand international cooperation.  \r\n In conclusion, my delegation reaffirms its \r\nwholehearted commitment to working with the \r\ninternational community and the Human Rights \r\nCouncil’s machinery in order to achieve the noble \r\nobjectives of protecting and promoting human rights \r\nthrough an approach predicated on dialogue, \r\ninternational and common understanding and \r\ncooperation. We hope that such an approach will \r\nremain the one adopted by the Council and that it will \r\nprevail in all the Council’s activities and endeavours. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on this item.  \r\n One representative has requested to speak in \r\nexercise of the right of reply. May I remind members \r\nthat statements in exercise of the right of reply are \r\nlimited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and to \r\nfive minutes for the second intervention, and should be \r\nmade by delegations from their seats. \r\n I call on the representative of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran. \r\n Mr. Mamdouhi (Islamic Republic of Iran): In \r\nexercising the right of reply to the statement made by \r\nthe representative of the United States, my delegation \r\nwould like to state the following.  \r\n It is unfortunate that abuse of the United Nations \r\nhuman rights machinery, including the General \r\nAssembly and the Human Rights Council, has become \r\na prevalent tradition among certain States in advancing \r\ntheir political purposes. We, along with the \r\noverwhelming majority of the international community \r\nwho have opposed or have not consciously supported \r\nsimilar moves in the past, are firmly convinced that \r\nsuch ill-intended practice has nothing to do with the \r\ncause of human rights and harms the credibility of the \r\nHuman Rights Council and its human rights \r\nmechanisms. \r\n Mr. Mohamed (Maldives), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n Adopting an unconstructive policy, the United \r\nStates makes references to others in the context of the \r\nviolation of human rights while certain parts of its own \r\npopulation, especially immigrants, foreigners and \r\nindigenous peoples, suffer from human rights \r\nviolations under its watch and its exercise of \r\ndiscriminatory policies. \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly has thus \r\nconcluded this stage of its consideration of agenda \r\nitem 64. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 75 (continued) \r\n \r\nReport of the International Criminal Court \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/64/356) \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/64/363) \r\n \r\n Ms. Blum (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nwould like first to thank the President of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) for preparing the \r\nfifth report of the Court (A/64/356), submitted for \r\nconsideration by the Members of the United Nations. \r\n My delegation wishes to highlight the work of the \r\nCourt in consolidating international criminal law and in \r\nits efforts to ensure the prevalence of international \r\njustice over impunity for crimes within the Court’s \r\njurisdiction. The report gives account of those efforts \r\nand of the Court’s support for national jurisdictions \r\nthrough its primary and fundamental role of \r\ninvestigating and prosecuting those responsible for \r\nsuch crimes, while upholding the basic premise of the \r\nCourt’s complementary jurisdiction. \r\n Let me stress that, having finished its substantive \r\npreliminary proceedings, the Court initiated its first \r\ntrials this year. This is unquestionably an important \r\nstep forward in the due administration of justice. My \r\ncountry welcomes the progress made on the path \r\ntowards the universalization of the Rome Statute, \r\nwhich now has 110 States parties following the recent \r\naccession of Chile and the Czech Republic. My \r\ndelegation also urges the full and effective cooperation \r\nof States, the United Nations and civil society towards \r\nthe proper functioning of the Court. \r\n In August 2008, the Prosecutor of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court, Mr. Luis Moreno-\r\nOcampo, paid a visit to Colombia at the invitation of \r\nthe Colombian State and the Office of the Attorney \r\nGeneral. During his visit, Mr. Moreno met with senior \r\nGovernment officials, the Attorney General, the \r\nSupreme Court and representatives of civil society, and \r\nhad the opportunity to analyse information concerning \r\n A/64/PV.31\r\n \r\n23 09-58708 \r\n \r\ninvestigations and ongoing lawsuits against leaders of \r\nillegal armed groups, politicians and military personnel \r\nsuspected of crimes that could fall within the Court’s \r\njurisdiction. The Prosecutor also discussed allegations \r\nregarding the existence of international support \r\nnetworks assisting criminal armed groups in Colombia. \r\nThe Government hopes that the work of the Court in \r\ngeneral, and of Prosecutor Moreno-Ocampo in \r\nparticular, will benefit the Colombian judicial system, \r\nmainly in fulfilling its primary obligation to \r\ninvestigate, prosecute and punish those responsible for \r\nsuch crimes, and to prevent impunity. \r\n States parties are committed to renewing our \r\nefforts to strengthen the International Criminal Court \r\nand bring national legislation into line with the Rome \r\nStatute, particularly regarding the definition of the \r\ncrimes that fall within the Court’s jurisdiction. \r\nInternational cooperation and judicial assistance are an \r\nintegral part of that commitment.  \r\n Colombia has made progress in adjusting its \r\nlegislation in accordance with the principles and rules \r\ngoverning the Court. In April, Colombia acceded to the \r\nAgreement on the Privileges and Immunities of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. In November, Colombia’s \r\ndeclaration concerning war crimes, in force for a \r\nperiod of seven years pursuant to article 124 of the \r\nRome Statute, will expire. At that time, the ICC’s \r\njurisdiction over all such crimes will go into full effect \r\nin my country. Colombia hopes that full implementation \r\nof the Rome Statute will help deter such war crimes as \r\nthe forcible recruitment of children and terrorist attacks \r\non civilians, and that it will also contribute to the \r\nefficiency of the justice system and strengthening the \r\nrule of law. \r\n Thanks to the implementation of recent legislative \r\nchanges, Colombia has a more efficient justice system. \r\nThe introduction and implementation of an accusatory \r\njustice system is one of the most notable developments. \r\nThe office of the Attorney General has been \r\nmodernized and its investigative capacity enhanced. \r\nWhere there have been allegations of violations of \r\nhuman rights by members of the security forces, the \r\nnational Government has moved quickly to refer all \r\nsuch cases for investigation by the regular courts \r\nthrough the office of the Attorney General. \r\n As a part of its fight against impunity, Colombia \r\nhas enacted a law of justice and peace that provides a \r\nlegal framework independent of the executive and \r\nrewards truthful confessions and reparation for victims. \r\nIt has facilitated the demobilization of some 52,000 \r\nmembers of illegal armed groups. As a further result of \r\nits implementation, approximately 30,000 criminal acts \r\nhave been confessed and around 2,500 bodies exhumed, \r\nand 35,000 victims have taken part in legal proceedings.  \r\n Thanks to the commitment of the Colombian \r\nState to truth and justice, Colombia today has achieved \r\nunprecedented results in this field. The guerrilla \r\nleaders of some illegal armed groups have been \r\nsentenced. All former paramilitary leaders are in prison \r\nand some have been extradited. Some 694 members of \r\nparamilitary groups are being prosecuted under the \r\njustice and peace law, 150 members of the security \r\nforces have been prosecuted by the justice system, \r\nalmost 400 have been subject to precautionary measures \r\nand approximately 1,300 are under investigation. \r\nEleven leaders have been convicted of colluding with \r\nformer paramilitary groups, 7 have been brought to \r\ntrial, 32 are being investigated and 8 are giving \r\nvoluntary depositions.  \r\n Additionally, the State has launched an ambitious \r\nprogramme to compensate victims through official \r\nchannels, to which significant budgetary resources \r\nhave been allocated. It has sought to establish a system \r\nthat allows for comprehensive symbolic, material, \r\nadministrative and legal reparations. The goal set by \r\nthe Government is to help the victims through \r\nrestitution, compensation, rehabilitation and guarantees \r\nof non-recurrence.  \r\n Coordinated efforts by all States, international \r\norganizations and civil society are vital to enabling the \r\nInternational Criminal Court to establish itself as an \r\ninternational body engaged in the fight against \r\nimpunity and to ensure the due application of justice \r\nwith regard to the heinous crimes under its jurisdiction.  \r\n The Review Conference of the Rome Statute will \r\nbe an exceptional opportunity to work together to \r\nstrengthen this important Court. As a country with a \r\nlegal tradition of strict adherence to international law, \r\nColombia reaffirms its commitment to the Court and to \r\nthe objectives that led to its creation. \r\n Mr. Appreku (Ghana): First of all, Ghana aligns \r\nitself with the statement made by the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Kenya on behalf of the African group \r\nof States parties to the Rome Statute. We wish to \r\nhighlight the following points in our national capacity. \r\nA/64/PV.31  \r\n \r\n09-58708 24 \r\n \r\n Ghana welcomes the note (A/64/356) by which \r\nthe Secretary-General has transmitted the report of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) in accordance with \r\narticle 6 of the Relationship Agreement between the \r\nUnited Nations and the ICC, as stated in paragraph 17 \r\nof resolution 63/21. Ghana further welcomes the report \r\nitself and the statement made by the President of the \r\nICC, Judge Sang-Hyun Song, in presenting the report. \r\nMy delegation congratulates Judge Song on his \r\nelection as President, as well as the newly elected First \r\nVice-President, Judge Fatoumata Dembele Diarra, and \r\nSecond Vice-President, Judge Hans-Peter Kaul, on \r\ntheir elections. \r\n We also welcome the five judges who were \r\nelected to the Court for the first time on 11 March 2009, \r\nand extend our deepest condolences to the Government \r\nof Japan on the demise of Judge Fumiko Saiga.  \r\n Ghana, as a State party to the Rome Statute, \r\nremains committed to the principle that agreements \r\nmust not only be honoured — pacta sunt servanda — \r\nbut must be honoured in good faith. Therefore, Ghana \r\nwill continue to support and cooperate with the Court \r\nas an independent judicial institution responsible for \r\ninvestigating and prosecuting individuals alleged to be \r\nresponsible for the most serious crimes of international \r\nconcern, namely, genocide, crimes against humanity \r\nand war crimes. We appreciate the fairness and \r\nimpartiality with which the Court has carried out its \r\nwork since its inception. \r\n We wish to emphasize that due process dictates \r\nthat every accused person or alleged perpetrator of any \r\nof these crimes shall be presumed innocent until \r\nproven guilty. By this standard, justice and the rule of \r\nlaw must be seen to have been equally served whether \r\nan accused person is proven guilty and thus deserves to \r\nbe convicted and jailed, or proven to be innocent and \r\nthus acquitted and discharged. Public discourse on \r\nquestions relating to alleged crimes carried out by any \r\nindividual, regardless of race, nationality or region, \r\nmust therefore reflect this balance, bearing in mind that \r\nit is only in a court of competent jurisdiction, such as \r\nthe ICC or national courts, where such findings of fact \r\nand law regarding guilt or innocence may be determined.  \r\n It is gratifying to note that the cases that have \r\ncome before the Court so far have given the Court the \r\nopportunity to test and clarify some of the provisions \r\nof the Rome Statute. Ghana looks forward to \r\nparticipating actively in the Review Conference \r\nconvened by the Secretary-General, scheduled to take \r\nplace in Kampala next year. \r\n Among other things, the Review Conference will \r\nprovide a platform to try to reach some consensus on \r\nthe definition of the crime of aggression and fill other \r\ngaps in the existing regime of the Rome Statute. We \r\nbelieve that the Conference will also provide a unique \r\nopportunity to take stock of the work of the Court and \r\nmake the necessary amendments to the Statute on the \r\nbasis of consensus, with a view to enhancing the \r\nefficiency and effectiveness of the Court as a veritable \r\nmechanism in the fight against impunity.  \r\n Some may disagree with certain decisions of the \r\nCourt, but the Review Conference in general, and the \r\nstock-taking segment in particular, should not be used \r\nas an occasion to impugn or question the integrity of \r\nthe judges of the Court. As the various ad hoc criminal \r\ntribunals reach the end of their completion strategies, it \r\nis expected that the workload of the ICC will increase \r\nin the foreseeable future. This fact makes the need to \r\npromote universal participation in the Rome Statute all \r\nthe more imperative and underscores the need to \r\nadequately resource the Court in order for it to \r\ndischarge its mandate.  \r\n In conclusion, efforts must be made to address \r\nlegal and legitimate concerns raised by interested \r\nparties and state stakeholders. My delegation \r\nacknowledges that peace and justice are two sides of \r\nthe same coin, one reinforcing the other. The Charter \r\nrecognized as much when it provided for respect for \r\nthe principles of justice and international law as the \r\ncornerstones of the attainment of peace and security.  \r\n It is well known that justice delayed is justice \r\ndenied, but sometimes peace delayed is justice denied, \r\ntoo. So we must pay equal attention to addressing the \r\ntwin challenges of peace and justice in our collective \r\nendeavour to promote international criminal justice and \r\nto ensure accountability and the rule of law without \r\nfear or favour. \r\n Mr. Argüello (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nArgentina expresses its appreciation and gratitude to \r\nMr. Sang-Hyun Song, President of the International \r\nCriminal Court, for introducing the Court’s report to \r\nthe United Nations, contained in document A/64/356. \r\nMy country once again highlights the contributions of \r\nthe International Criminal Court to the international \r\norder through the fight against impunity for crimes \r\nagainst humanity, genocide and war crimes.  \r\n A/64/PV.31\r\n \r\n25 09-58708 \r\n \r\n This session of the General Assembly finds the \r\nInternational Criminal Court in full judicial activity. \r\nThis year, just a decade after the adoption of the Rome \r\nStatute, it began its first trial, while the second is \r\nscheduled to begin next month. This year also finds the \r\nRome Statute with 110 States parties. Thus, I wish to \r\nwelcome the Republic of Chile and the Czech Republic \r\nto the Statute. \r\n The Court is firmly establishing itself in its trial \r\nstage, in which it is essential that it demonstrate its \r\nability to administer justice effectively, expeditiously \r\nand impartially. For that reason, it is important, inter \r\nalia, to swiftly fill vacancies to ensure that all \r\nChambers of the Court are fully operational. It is also \r\nessential that the organs of the International Criminal \r\nCourt, without prejudice to their independence or \r\nrespective mandates, constitute a single Court united \r\nby shared values and objectives. \r\n The International Criminal Court has a global \r\nmandate but has not yet achieved universal participation. \r\nAchieving such universality is the great challenge for \r\nthe Court and for the international community in the \r\nmedium and long terms. Universal participation and \r\nthe Court’s credibility will enable it to investigate and \r\nissue rulings in all appropriate situations.  \r\n Here, I wish to stress that achieving universality \r\ndepends not only on the number of ratifications, but \r\nalso on States’ adoption of domestic legislation that \r\nensures operational complementarity and a functioning \r\ncooperation regime, as provided for in the Rome \r\nStatute. In particular, this includes arrest and surrender \r\nwarrants, without which the Court will not be able to \r\neffectively carry out its mandate of investigating and \r\nissuing rulings.  \r\n In the quest for universality, outreach campaigns \r\nconcerning the International Criminal Court and the \r\nRome Statute are also essential. I should like to \r\nrecognize the role played by the Coalition for the \r\nInternational Criminal Court and other civil society \r\norganizations in that regard. \r\n Next year, another important event will take place \r\nin the life of the Court — the Review Conference of \r\nthe Rome Statute to be held in Kampala, Uganda. The \r\nReview Conference will be the forum for considering \r\narticle 124 of the Statute and for adopting a definition \r\nof the crime of aggression. My country also believes \r\nthat it will be an opportunity to study other proposals \r\nenjoying broad consensus and to carry out the important \r\nexercise of review or stocktaking.  \r\n Argentina is convinced that a segment should be \r\nincluded in the Review Conference for considering \r\nsuch issues as complementarity, the cooperation of \r\nStates with the Court, and the impact of international \r\njustice on national trials and peace processes. I should \r\nlike to urge the widest possible participation in the \r\nKampala Conference and, given the commitment of \r\nStates parties to the Court, representation at the highest \r\npossible governmental level in the review exercise.  \r\n Cooperation on the part of States, the United \r\nNations, regional organizations and other actors is \r\nessential if the Court is to effectively carry out the \r\nfunctions entrusted to it by the international community. \r\nHere, I wish to recognize the United Nations \r\noperational, logistic and diplomatic assistance to the \r\nCourt, which is highlighted in the report. With regard \r\nto cooperation, I should like to recall that in 2006, \r\nArgentina adopted the measures necessary to the \r\ndomestic implementation of the Rome Statute as part \r\nof my country’s cooperation with the Court. In addition, \r\nwe ratified the Agreement on the Privileges and \r\nImmunities of the International Criminal Court, enabling \r\nthe Court to carry out its functions unimpeded on \r\nArgentine territory.  \r\n The International Criminal Court is a unique \r\ntribunal. Only two decades ago, a permanent tribunal \r\nto judge individuals for the most atrocious crimes was \r\nunthinkable. Now, the Court is gaining strength. The \r\ncredibility of judicial tribunals depends on their \r\njudgements and on the quality of their proceedings. In \r\nthe case of the International Criminal Court, it will also \r\ndepend on its universality and on the cooperation of \r\nStates. Therefore, I should like once again to urge all \r\nStates to cooperate with the International Criminal \r\nCourt and to urge those States that have not yet done so \r\nto ratify or accede to the Rome Statute and thus ensure \r\nthe universality of the fight against impunity. \r\n Mr. Valero Briceño (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): We wish to pay tribute \r\nto Mr. Sang-Hyun Song, President of the International \r\nCriminal Court. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela \r\ncongratulates Chile and the Czech Republic on having \r\njoined the countries, including Venezuela, that are \r\nparties to the Rome Statute. Their membership \r\ncontributes to the achievement of the long-sought \r\nuniversality of the Court and to its strengthening as an \r\nA/64/PV.31  \r\n \r\n09-58708 26 \r\n \r\ninternational criminal tribunal that can effectively and \r\ntransparently contribute to the development of \r\ninternational criminal law. \r\n The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela played an \r\nactive role in the deliberative process on the Rome \r\nStatute, aimed at establishing the International \r\nCriminal Court. Later, it was among the first States to \r\nratify that constitutive instrument. Thus, Venezuela, \r\ntogether with many other countries, contributed \r\ndecisively to fulfilling the long-held aspiration of the \r\npeoples of the world to international peace and justice.  \r\n The aim here is to end the impunity that has been \r\nenjoyed by the perpetrators of unspeakable crimes \r\ncommitted against humanity. The Court is without a \r\ndoubt a necessary institution in light of its noble task \r\nas a subsidiary entity of the penal institutions of the \r\nStates parties. \r\n For the reasons I have set out, it is of vital \r\nimportance that the International Criminal Court \r\nmaintain its independence and autonomy as a \r\npermanent legal body, as strictly defined under the \r\nprovisions of the Rome Statute, and in exercising its \r\njurisdiction with respect to States parties to the Statute \r\nand those non-States parties that have accepted its \r\njurisdiction in contentious cases through special \r\nagreements. Due attention and care must be paid to the \r\nissues of compensation for victims and procedural \r\nguarantees for defendants. \r\n For countries devoted to peace and justice, such \r\nas Venezuela, it is of crucial importance that the \r\nInternational Criminal Court not be hampered in any  \r\n \r\nway in carrying out its functions fully as it endeavours \r\nto establish procedural norms for litigation.  \r\n Our country believes that greater willingness to \r\nparticipate actively in the Rome Statute Review \r\nConference would be an important step in the \r\nconsolidation of international law. We emphasize the \r\nimportance of the Conference which, as we all know, \r\nwill be held in Uganda in May 2010. We recall the \r\nresponsibility of States parties to the Rome Statute for \r\ndecisions to be adopted at the Review Conference to \r\ndefine the crime of aggression. \r\n We believe that this would be a substantive \r\ndevelopment that could change the history of injustice \r\nthat has afflicted the sad fate of peoples that have been \r\nvictims of aggression and invasion and seen their \r\npolitical and economic independence flagrantly \r\nviolated, their territory dismembered, their Government \r\ninstitutions usurped and their natural treasures, \r\nincluding their cultural assets, plundered. This effort, \r\nwhich will contribute to the consolidation of peace, \r\nsecurity and justice, will be possible only if the \r\nsacrosanct independence of the International Criminal \r\nCourt is maintained. \r\n I should like to conclude by saying that the \r\nStatute of Rome must never contain any provision that \r\ncould be interpreted as suggesting that the Court is \r\nsubject to any relationship in which it is subordinate. \r\nFor that reason, we recall the great importance of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. \r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
