(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) \r\n \r\n \r\n The meeting was called to order at 4.20 p.m. \r\n \r\n In the absence of the President, Mr. Grauls \r\n(Belgium), Vice-President, took the Chair.  \r\n \r\nAgenda item 75 (continued) \r\n \r\nReport of the International Criminal Court \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/64/356) \r\n \r\n  Report by the Secretary-General (A/64/363) \r\n \r\n Mr. Muhumuza (Uganda): This being the first \r\ntime my delegation has addressed this Assembly in this \r\ncontext, allow me to join others before me in \r\ncongratulating the President and the bureau upon their \r\nelection to lead the work of the sixty-fourth session of \r\nthe General Assembly. With his vast experience and \r\ndiplomatic skills, we have the confidence that he will \r\nguide this Assembly to success. \r\n Allow me first to align my delegation with the \r\nstatement made by the representative of Kenya on \r\nbehalf of the Group of African States. We congratulate \r\nJudge Sang-Hyun Song on his election to preside over \r\nthe International Criminal Court (ICC), as well as for \r\nhis presentation of the fifth annual report of the Court \r\n(A/64/356). \r\n Uganda supports the ICC as the world’s principal \r\npartner in the fight against impunity for the most \r\nheinous crimes of concern to the international \r\ncommunity. Uganda is thus committed to the mandate \r\nof the Court and appreciates its role in this endeavour. \r\nThat is why Uganda was the first country to make a \r\nreferral to the Court, which resulted in the case of The \r\nProsecutor v. Joseph Kony, Vincent Otti, Okot \r\nOdhiambo and Dominic Ongwen. The defendants in \r\nthat case are leaders of the terrorist rebel outfit known \r\nas the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA). As we speak, \r\nthese fugitives no longer operate in Uganda nor on any \r\nterritory controlled by Uganda, but that is no \r\nconsolation to us, since they have continued to \r\nterrorize other areas in the region where they operate.  \r\n We are aware that without a police force of its \r\nown, the Court has to rely on the cooperation of States \r\nto execute warrants of arrest and surrender fugitives or \r\nthe indicted persons whenever such warrants have been \r\nissued. Being a treaty-based body implies that State \r\ncooperation with the ICC is voluntary. We therefore \r\ncall upon increased cooperation by Member States.  \r\n The ICC is steadily marching on the road towards \r\nuniversality. Accordingly, we welcome the most recent \r\nratifying States — Chile and the Czech Republic — \r\nwhose ratification of the Rome Statute has brought the \r\ntotal membership to 110 States. We call on other States \r\nwhich have not done so to consider ratifying the Rome \r\nStatute so that the fight against impunity for the most \r\nheinous crimes can be jointly waged by all States \r\nworldwide. Universal ratification would send a clear \r\nmessage that the civilized world has no room for \r\nimpunity for anyone, anywhere. \r\n It is gratifying to note that, unlike various \r\ntraditional jurisdictions, the Rome Statute recognizes \r\nthe victims of heinous crimes and allows them to \r\nA/64/PV.32  \r\n \r\n09-58799 2 \r\n \r\nparticipate actively in the proceedings, with a \r\npossibility of compensation for the harm inflicted. \r\n Justice must not only be done; it must also be \r\nperceived to be done. It is mainly with that in mind that \r\nthe Government of Uganda offered to host the first \r\nreview conference of the Rome Statute, which will \r\noffer the great majority of the victims of the situations \r\ncurrently being considered from our region the \r\nopportunity to interface with the other stakeholders in \r\nthe fight against impunity. We applaud the efforts of \r\nthe civil organizations that have already made \r\narrangements for delegates to meet with LRA victims \r\nin northern Uganda. Visits are currently being \r\narranged, and we would encourage many more to take \r\npart in this effort so that victims do not remain on the \r\nsidelines, but rather take centre stage as they are at the \r\ncore of the fight against impunity. \r\n Uganda looks forward to hosting all delegations \r\nin Kampala from 31 May to 11 June 2010 for the \r\nreview conference of the Rome Statute. We hope that \r\nwithin this period, the crime of aggression will be \r\ndefined and the conditions under which the Court may \r\nexercise jurisdiction will also be agreed upon. The \r\nworld can no longer afford to wait to deal appropriately \r\nwith the perpetrators of aggressive wars which cause \r\nuntold suffering to innocent people all over the world. \r\n Finally, let me avail myself of the opportunity to \r\nextend from this rostrum a hand of welcome to \r\nKampala for all delegations, States parties and \r\nnon-State parties alike, civil society organizations and \r\nall stakeholders in the fight against impunity. We \r\nassure them of an atmosphere conducive to \r\naccomplishing the remaining tasks at hand.  \r\n In order to facilitate participation, my \r\nGovernment has waived visa fees for all delegates to \r\nthe review conference, and further arrangements are \r\nbeing made with airline companies, transporters and \r\nthe general hospitality industry to ensure that their stay \r\nin the Pearl of Africa will not only be fruitful but \r\nmemorable as well. \r\n Mr. Ntwaagae (Botswana): My delegation \r\nassociates itself with the statement delivered by the \r\nrepresentative of Kenya, who spoke on behalf of the \r\nGroup of African States which are parties to the Rome \r\nStatute. \r\n We wish to congratulate Judge Sang-Hyun Song \r\non his election to the presidency of the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC) and for his presentation of the \r\nreport on its activities (A/64/356). \r\n The preservation of the integrity of the Rome \r\nStatute of the ICC and the assurance that the Court \r\nremains impartial, fully independent and free from \r\ninterference as it fulfils its primary function and \r\ndelivers on its mandate are of utmost importance. \r\n The Rome Statute provides the opportunity to \r\nadvance the universal ideals enshrined in the United \r\nNations Charter — international peace and security, \r\njustice and respect for human rights and the enjoyment \r\nof fundamental freedoms for all. \r\n The fulfilment of the purposes and principles of \r\nthe Charter remains the full responsibility of the \r\nMember States of the United Nations. Similarly, by \r\nextension of these purposes and principles to the ICC, \r\nits mandate of pursuing perpetrators of the grave \r\ncrimes that are of serious concern to the international \r\ncommunity has never been so compelling. \r\n Mankind has never in its history faced a time of \r\ngreater truth than the one we face today, where, more \r\nthan ever before, the possibility of recourse to \r\ninternational legal institutions exists for victims whose \r\nStates might be unwilling to prosecute. Therefore, the \r\ncooperation extended to the Court in fighting \r\ninternational crimes, impunity and grave violations of \r\nhuman rights is not without cause for the victims of \r\ngenocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. \r\n Botswana, as a friend of the ICC, is committed to \r\nplaying its obligatory role in supporting the judicial \r\nactivity of the Court and has confidence in \r\nenforcement measures that are compelling as a \r\ndeterrent against acts of serious crime and in the \r\npromotion of accountability. \r\n Mr. Onemola (Nigeria): The Nigerian delegation \r\nwishes to congratulate Judge Sang-Hyun Song on his \r\nelection as President of the International Criminal \r\nCourt (ICC). We thank him for his comprehensive \r\nbriefing to the General Assembly. We also extend our \r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for the report on \r\nthe ICC contained in document A/64/356, submitted to \r\nthe General Assembly in accordance with article 6 of \r\nthe Relationship Agreement between the United \r\nNations and the International Criminal Court.  \r\n We are appreciative of the relentless efforts of the \r\nCourt in carrying out its mandate as an independent \r\njudicial institution charged with investigating and \r\n A/64/PV.32\r\n \r\n3 09-58799 \r\n \r\nbringing to trial individuals accused of the most serious \r\ncrimes of international concern, namely, genocide, \r\ncrimes against humanity and war crimes. Nigeria aligns \r\nitself with the statement delivered by the African group \r\nof States parties to the Rome Statute. \r\n Nigeria is deeply committed to the ICC, the \r\nestablishment of which we recognize as one of the \r\ngreat advances of international law. The Court’s \r\nfunction of ensuring accountability for grave crimes is \r\nvital to the maintenance of lasting international peace \r\nand security. To strengthen the ability of the Court to \r\neffectively discharge that most important \r\nresponsibility, the Court relies on the cooperation of \r\nStates, international organizations and civil society, in \r\naccordance with the Rome Statute and international \r\nagreements concluded by the Court. That cooperation \r\nis critical to ensuring proper investigations, the \r\nexecution of outstanding warrants of arrest, the \r\nsurrender of persons, the protection of witnesses, the \r\nenforcement of sentences and the enhancement of the \r\nCourt’s credibility as an effective tool to end impunity \r\nand contribute to the prevention of future crimes. \r\n We welcome the increasing number of States that \r\nhave become parties to the ICC Statute. With 110 \r\ncountries — more than two thirds of the United \r\nNations membership — having signed or ratified the \r\ntreaty, there is clear movement towards the Court’s \r\nuniversality. That welcome development is worthy of \r\nfurther support from those States that are yet to sign or \r\nratify the Rome Statute. \r\n We have taken note of efforts by the ICC to \r\nimprove geographical representation, gender balance \r\nand representation of the different legal systems of the \r\nworld in its recruitment activities, in accordance with \r\nthe decision in ICC resolution ICC-ASP/1/Res.10. As \r\nwe commend those efforts, we wish to underscore the \r\nneed for the ICC to achieve the target of wide \r\ngeographical representation and gender balance, \r\nespecially with regard to the African region, which, in \r\nspite of the fact that it accounts for most if not all of \r\nthe situations before the Court, is still \r\nunderrepresented. We believe that the necessary \r\nbalance can be attained without compromising the \r\nquality of the staff selected. \r\n The ICC currently has four situations — Uganda, \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, the \r\nSudan/Darfur and the Central African Republic — and \r\neight cases before it. With the expected increase in the \r\nnumber of cases, additional funding will be needed. We \r\ntherefore call on all States to defray their outstanding \r\ncontributions to the Court.  \r\n We are pleased to note that the Court has already \r\nentered into many relocation of witness and \r\nenforcement of sentence agreements with States. In \r\norder to encourage more States to enter into such \r\nagreements with the Court, we believe that the Court \r\nneeds to become more proactive by exploring ways to \r\nfacilitate the participation of more developing States in \r\nthat regard. \r\n The Review Conference of the International \r\nCriminal Court Statute, scheduled for Kampala in \r\n2010, will provide us with ample opportunity to review \r\nachievements made and the challenges before us. As \r\nwe look forward to the Review Conference, we \r\nencourage all States to participate actively in finding \r\nconcrete ways of further emboldening the Court to \r\nfulfil its crucial mandate.  \r\n In conclusion, the Nigerian delegation reiterates \r\nits commitment to and continued support for the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. \r\n Mr. Baghaei Hamaneh (Islamic Republic of \r\nIran): My delegation would like to join previous \r\nspeakers in thanking Judge Sang-Hyun Song, President \r\nof the International Criminal Court (ICC), for \r\nsubmitting the fifth report of the International Criminal \r\nCourt (A/64/356). \r\n It is generally recognized that if it is to be \r\nsuccessful, the International Criminal Court should \r\nremain neutral, independent and apolitical and avoid \r\ndouble standards. \r\n As many speakers have noted, next year the first \r\nReview Conference of the Rome Statute will be held in \r\nKampala, Uganda, and the main item on its agenda will \r\nbe the incorporation of the definition of the crime of \r\naggression into the ICC Statute. The crime of \r\naggression is the mother of all serious international \r\ncrimes and, as such, both its definition and the way that \r\nthe Court is mandated to tackle it will broadly \r\ninfluence the cause of ending impunity for such crimes \r\nand affect the whole architecture of international law \r\nand international relations. \r\n On the question of the relationship between the \r\nICC and the Security Council, my delegation believes \r\nthat any decision of the Conference of the States parties \r\nwould have lasting implications for the independence, \r\nA/64/PV.32  \r\n \r\n09-58799 4 \r\n \r\nlegitimacy, efficiency and even relevance of the Court. \r\nCertainly, the drafters of the Rome Statute intended the \r\nCourt to be an independent judicial body, free of the \r\ninfluence and interference of political organs. Therefore, \r\nin principle, the responsibility of the Security Council \r\nunder the Charter to determine the existence of an act \r\nof aggression should not in any way undermine the role \r\nof the Court in its judicial investigation and proceedings \r\nconcerning the crime of aggression. Initiating the \r\nCourt’s proceedings, therefore, should not be subject to \r\nthe Security Council’s permission or approval. Hence, \r\nthe determination of the crime of aggression should rest \r\nwith the International Criminal Court itself, and States \r\nshould have the right to refer the crime to the Court. \r\n My delegation believes that the Court, as a \r\njudicial body, and its organs shall respect the laws and \r\nregulations prevailing in the system to which it \r\nbelongs. In other words, in order to achieve its goals, \r\nin particular in collecting evidence or arresting \r\nsuspects, it must refrain from taking any measure that \r\ncould be considered an infringement of international \r\nlaw. In this respect, I recall the established principle of \r\ninternational law that only the States parties to an \r\ninternational treaty are bound to its provisions. \r\n Likewise, the ICC cannot ignore international \r\nrules relating to the immunity of State officials, as \r\nrecognized under article 98 of the Rome Statute. \r\nMoreover, the Court should take into account the \r\nconsequences of its decisions on the advancement of \r\npeace and stability in each case. In this respect, I draw \r\nattention to the concerns raised by the African Union, \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement, the Organization of the \r\nIslamic Conference and many countries concerning the \r\nrecent decisions of the ICC on the Darfur situation. \r\n Let me touch upon another recent development — \r\nthe declaration filed on 22 January 2009 by Palestine \r\nwith the Registrar of the Court pursuant to article 12, \r\nparagraph 3, of the Statute. This declaration provides \r\njurisdiction to the Court with respect to the crimes \r\ncommitted on the territory of Palestine since 1 July \r\n2002. The Prosecutor of the Court is currently \r\nconsidering the capacity of Palestine to issue that \r\ndeclaration. It is expected that the Prosecutor shall \r\ninterpret article 12 of the Statute in a manner ensuring \r\nthat the main purpose of the Court — ending impunity \r\nfor the perpetrators of international crimes of a grave \r\nnature — will be fulfilled. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): We \r\nhave heard the last speaker in the debate on agenda \r\nitem 75. The General Assembly has thus concluded this \r\nstage of its consideration of agenda item 75. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 72 (continued) \r\n \r\nReport of the International Court of Justice  \r\n \r\n  Report of the International Court of Justice \r\n(A/64/4) \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/64/308) \r\n  \r\n Mr. Heller (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nMexican delegation wishes to express its deep \r\nappreciation to the International Court of Justice for its \r\nhard work over the past year. \r\n At the same time, Mexico welcomes the \r\nrestructuring of the Court in November. The new \r\ncomposition of the Court reaffirms its universal \r\ncharacter and ensures that its decisions will be adopted \r\nin the framework of the world’s main legal systems and \r\nthe multitude of regional perspectives and realities. All \r\nof this will, without a doubt, help the world’s highest \r\ncourt pursue its excellent work. \r\n Although the Court has experienced a steady \r\nincrease in the number of cases under its consideration, \r\nwe note with satisfaction that a backlog has been \r\navoided, which clearly demonstrates that changes in its \r\nrules of procedure and working methods are having a \r\npositive impact. Significant proof of this is the fact that \r\nduring the 2008-2009 judicial year, six cases were \r\nunder consideration by the Court simultaneously. \r\n Mexico notes that the Court’s sustained level of \r\nactivity has been made possible thanks to the \r\nguidelines adopted to improve its efficiency and, in \r\nparticular, to the ongoing review of the practical \r\nguidelines of States appearing before it. However, my \r\ndelegation also notes with concern the continuing need \r\nfor increased support personnel so that the judges can \r\ncontinue to carry out their work. \r\n Member States are obligated to reflect on how to \r\nsupport the work of the Court, particularly if its \r\ncaseload continues to grow. That growth should be \r\nwelcomed. It shows the willingness of States to settle \r\ntheir disputes by peaceful means. It also reflects the \r\ngreat trust of States in the world’s highest court. \r\n The United Nations and its Member States are at \r\na moment of severe financial constraint. However, we \r\n A/64/PV.32\r\n \r\n5 09-58799 \r\n \r\nbelieve that more can and must be done for the Court. \r\nThe Organization must make more efficient use of \r\navailable resources and allocate them where they are \r\nneeded the most. The Court most definitely deserves \r\nthe support it requests and the General Assembly \r\nshould heed to its call to increase the number of clerks, \r\nif only to alleviate to some extent their heavy \r\nworkload. \r\n As we have on previous occasions, we stress the \r\nimportance of the dissemination of the Court’s \r\ndecisions through its publications and website. \r\nNonetheless, my delegation notes that there is an \r\nimportant difference between the Court’s website in \r\nEnglish and French, on the one hand, and its Spanish \r\nversion, on the other. The latter is considerably less \r\nrich in information, thus hampering the analytic work \r\nof Spanish-speaking scholars and practitioners of \r\ninternational law. \r\n Mexico welcomes the Court’s decision on the \r\nRequest for Interpretation of the Judgment of 31 March \r\n2004 in the Case concerning Avena and Other Mexican \r\nNationals (Mexico v. United States of America). We \r\nfurther welcome the Court’s ruling in regard to the \r\nprovisional measures requested by Mexico. We are also \r\npleased that the Court issued a binding reaffirmation of \r\nthe obligations incumbent upon the United States under \r\nparagraph 153 (9) of the Avena ruling of 2004.  \r\n In this vein, we stress the importance of the \r\nCourt’s ruling in January in connection to the \r\nobligation of each Member State to comply with \r\ndecisions in any case to which it is party. Full \r\ncompliance with the rulings of the Court is prerequisite \r\nto the effectiveness of international law. At the same \r\ntime, such compliance promotes trust among States and \r\nthus enacts, in the words of the recently deceased \r\neminent professor Thomas M. Franck, the power of \r\nlegitimacy among nations. \r\n The International Court of Justice is one of the \r\nkeystones in the construction of the international rule \r\nof law. Its proper functioning is indispensable to that \r\nend. That is why Mexico reiterates its full respect and \r\nsupport to the International Court of Justice as the \r\nprincipal judicial organ for the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes and its central work as guarantor of \r\ninternational law. \r\n Mr. Lomaia (Georgia): Georgia welcomes the \r\npublication of the annual report of the International \r\nCourt of Justice (A/64/4) and would like to thank the \r\nPresident of the Court, Judge Hisashi Owada, for his \r\npresentation yesterday, which was both detailed and \r\ninformative. I would like to take this opportunity to \r\nexpress our appreciation to Judge Rosalyn Higgins for \r\nher invaluable contribution to the strengthening of \r\ninternational law through her work as Judge and \r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice. \r\n President Owada started his presentation by \r\nupdating the Assembly on the Court’s ruling last \r\nOctober in favour of the request submitted by my \r\ncountry. The request for the indication of provisional \r\nmeasures was submitted in order “to protect its citizens \r\nagainst violent discriminatory acts by Russian armed \r\nforces, acting in concert with separatist militia and \r\nforeign mercenaries”. That decision was taken in spite \r\nof the other side’s fierce opposition. The Court recalled \r\nthat the provisional measures that it indicated had a \r\nbinding effect and thus created legal obligations. \r\n It is solely up to the Court to determine whether \r\nor not our northern neighbours complied with the \r\nruling. We, on our part, have provided the Court with \r\nclear factual evidence indicating that none of the \r\nprovisional measures have been fulfilled. Not only \r\nhave the forcefully displaced persons not been allowed \r\nto return to their houses, they are being arrested and \r\ndetained merely for trying to approach their villages. \r\nAmong the recently revealed facts and conclusions \r\nvalidating those arguments, available for the Court’s \r\nconsideration, we would single out just two. \r\n The Secretary-General’s report dated 24 August, \r\nentitled “Status of internally displaced persons and \r\nrefugees from Abkhazia, Georgia” (A/63/950), \r\nconfirmed the displacement of ethnic Georgians from \r\nthe Abkhazia region. The Independent International \r\nFact-Finding Mission on the Conflict in Georgia stated \r\nin its recent report that  \r\n “several elements suggest the conclusion that \r\nethnic cleansing was indeed practised against \r\nethnic Georgians in South Ossetia both during \r\nand after the August 2008 conflict”. \r\nWe express our deep confidence that the International \r\nCourt of Justice will continue its careful and competent \r\nconsideration of all pending cases, this particular case \r\nincluded.  \r\n In conclusion I would like to reiterate our strong \r\nsupport for the International Court of Justice in its role \r\nas the principal judicial organ of the United Nations. \r\nA/64/PV.32  \r\n \r\n09-58799 6 \r\n \r\nThe Court plays, as has been said here, a vital role in \r\nthe peaceful settlement of international disputes and in \r\nstrengthening the international legal order. \r\n Mr. Kuzmin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): We welcome the election of Judge Hisashi \r\nOwada as President of the International Court of \r\nJustice and thank him for presenting to the General \r\nAssembly the Court’s annual report (A/64/4). At \r\nyesterday’s meeting of the Security Council \r\n(S/PV.6208), the Russian Federation voiced its general \r\nassessment and essential approach to the activities of \r\nthe International Court of Justice, affirming its respect \r\nfor the Court’s standing and recognition of its special \r\nrole in intergovernmental relations.  \r\n Russia plays an active role in promoting the \r\nconcept of international law, including within the main \r\njudicial organ of our Organization, the International \r\nCourt of Justice. We do so out of our great respect for \r\nand trust in the Court, and on the basis of our \r\nconviction that the idea of the rule of law is a deterrent \r\nagainst attempts to resolve international issues through \r\nreckless military and political action.  \r\n I should like now to focus my reflections on one \r\nof the cases on the Court’s docket, in which the \r\nRussian Federation is the respondent and upon which \r\nthe representative of Georgia commented in much \r\ndetail only a minute ago. I refer to the case on the \r\napplication of the International Convention on the \r\nElimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. It is \r\nin that claim, which Georgia brought before the \r\nInternational Court of Justice against the Russian \r\nFederation, that the wholesale cynicism of Georgia’s \r\naction in South Ossetia in August 2008 is most \r\napparent.  \r\n Having failed in its reckless military gamble and \r\ndiscredited itself before the international community, \r\nGeorgia’s leadership is now attempting to repair its \r\nterminally damaged image through the authority of \r\ninternational judicial bodies. It is saddening to note \r\nthat the claimant in this case is the party that deemed it \r\nacceptable to fire at night on the peaceful civilian \r\npopulation of Tskhinvali and on Russian peacekeepers, \r\nwhile the respondent is the party that exercised its \r\ninalienable right to self-defence, pursuant to Article 51 \r\nof the United Nations Charter, commensurate with the \r\nscale of the attack and in the sole aim of protecting \r\nRussian peacekeepers and citizens in Southern Ossetia \r\nfrom the illegal actions of the Georgian side and of \r\npreventing future armed assaults.  \r\n The Russian Federation believes that the dispute \r\nthat Georgia is attempting to bring before the Court \r\nclearly does not fall within the framework of the \r\nInternational Convention on the Elimination of All \r\nForms of Racial Discrimination. The very name of the \r\nConvention reveals the artificial nature of Georgia’s \r\nso-called claim against the Russian Federation. It is no \r\ncoincidence that Georgia repeatedly had to re-draft its \r\nstatement of claim, reducing time and again the \r\nnumber of the Convention’s provisions allegedly \r\nbreached by the Russian Federation. It is quite clear \r\nthat, in such an ineptly manufactured case and even \r\nwith the help of the experienced judicial practitioners \r\nretained by Georgia, it has been difficult to establish \r\nthe relevance of the Convention, in which very \r\ndifferent issues are addressed.  \r\n In the 18 years during which Georgia claims to \r\nhave had an ongoing dispute with the Russian \r\nFederation falling under the Convention, it never once \r\nproposed holding talks on racial discrimination against \r\nGeorgians, nor did it turn to the body specially \r\nestablished by the Convention, the Committee on the \r\nElimination of Racial Discrimination, pursuant to the \r\nprocedures under articles 11 and 14 of the Convention. \r\nThe Russian Federation is convinced that the Court \r\ndoes not have the competence to consider this case. \r\n The natural question is: Why is the Russian \r\nFederation participating in this process initiated by the \r\nGeorgian side? As members of the Assembly know, the \r\nhistory of the Court includes a great many cases in \r\nwhich respondent States simply did not appear before \r\nthe Court. These cases touched, inter alia, on fisheries \r\njurisdiction, nuclear tests, Pakistani prisoners of war, \r\nthe Aegean Sea and the United States diplomatic and \r\nconsular staff in Tehran. Our participation in the \r\njudicial proceedings is yet further confirmation of \r\nRussia’s adherence to the United Nations Charter and \r\nthe Statute of the International Court of Justice, as well \r\nas to the fundamental principles of international law. \r\n We are convinced that blurring the Court’s \r\njurisdiction by stepping outside the clearly defined \r\nframework of the international legal instruments on \r\nwhich it is based in order to extract from a narrowly \r\nspecialized international treaty — in this instance, the \r\nInternational Convention on the Elimination of All \r\nForms of Racial Discrimination — norms that apply to \r\n A/64/PV.32\r\n \r\n7 09-58799 \r\n \r\ncompletely different fields of international law will \r\ninevitably lead to a loss of confidence in the Court.  \r\n Over the past few years, an increasing number of \r\nStates have recognized the Court’s jurisdiction and an \r\nexpanding range of issues have been referred to the \r\nCourt. In 2007, the Russian Federation withdrew its \r\nreservations concerning the Court’s jurisdiction with \r\nregard to six counter-terrorism conventions. However, \r\nthis positive trend can continue only if it is based on a \r\nclear understanding of the limits of the Court’s \r\njurisdiction and of the substance of the cases referred \r\nto it. \r\n The quest to ensure the Court’s political \r\nneutrality and impartiality is reflected in the unique \r\nvote split over the provisional measures applied in the \r\nGeorgian-Russian case. The Court took a constructive \r\napproach to the issue of determining the provisional \r\nmeasures, having ordered both sides — not just the \r\nRussian Federation, as Georgia had requested — to \r\nrefrain from violating the International Convention on \r\nthe Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. \r\nRussia is meeting that requirement and intends to \r\ncontinue to do so in the future.  \r\n The Court found that it had prima facie \r\njurisdiction, with only eight judges voting in favour \r\nand seven against. A virtual 50-50 vote split has been \r\nquite a rare occurrence in the history of the Court. \r\nFurthermore, for the very first time in its judicial \r\nproceedings on provisional measures, seven judges \r\nformed a united front, signing an opinion dissenting \r\nfrom the position of the other eight. The conclusion of \r\nhalf of the judges that the Court’s provisional \r\nmeasures, as part of the recognition of prima facie \r\njurisdiction, were based on shaky legal ground speaks \r\nfor itself.  \r\n Repeating the conclusion of the Russian side, the \r\njudges clearly stated that, at the very least, it was odd \r\nthat Georgia, having referred to cases of racial \r\ndiscrimination allegedly committed by the Russian \r\nFederation since the early 1990s, had waited until \r\narmed conflict had broken out with Russian and South \r\nOssetian forces to refer this dispute to the Court. Thus, \r\nfor nearly two decades, no one, including Georgia, had \r\neven considered the possibility that racial discrimination \r\nwas taking place against Georgians.  \r\n With regard to the role and the impact of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, we stress the emergence \r\nof such phenomena as the fragmentation of \r\ninternational law and the proliferation of international \r\nlegal bodies. This recent trend shows that, where \r\ninternational legal disputes arise, States are utilizing \r\nevery available judicial resource — engaging in so-\r\ncalled court shopping — and, as a result, obtaining \r\nvarious legal decisions.  \r\n In addition, tribunals can issue different rulings \r\non the same issue, as occurred, for example, with \r\nregard to effective monitoring in the case concerning \r\nMilitary and Paramilitary Activities in and against \r\nNicaragua, the Tadic case heard by the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, and the \r\nLoizidou case before the European Court of Human \r\nRights. We believe that that is a negative trend. \r\nUnfortunately, international judicial proceedings will \r\nlose their purely legal nature and become forums for \r\npolitical manipulation under the pretext of international \r\nlaw. In the case of the International Court of Justice, it \r\nis particularly important that it clearly define its \r\njurisdiction and adhere to proven practice in its judicial \r\nproceedings. \r\n We are convinced that, as a result of this process, \r\nthe International Court of Justice — a unique body \r\nwith the last word on legal issues of great importance \r\nto various States — will not lose its iconic status as a \r\nstandard-bearer of international law and will promote \r\nthe unity and development of international law. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): We \r\nhave heard the last speaker in the debate on agenda \r\nitem 72. \r\n I now call on the representative of Georgia, who \r\nwishes to speak in exercise of the right of reply. May I \r\nremind him that statements in exercise of the right of \r\nreply are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by \r\ndelegations from their seats. \r\n Mr. Lomaia (Georgia): I wish to make two very \r\nbrief remarks. What our opponents have just given \r\nthemselves the freedom to call a decision based on \r\nshaky legal grounds is something that we read about in \r\nparagraph 14 of the report by the International Court of \r\nJustice (A/64/4): \r\n  “After a thorough analysis of the arguments \r\nof the parties, the Court found that it had prima \r\nfacie jurisdiction under article 22 of the \r\nInternational Convention on the Elimination of \r\nAll Forms of Racial Discrimination to deal with \r\nthe case and could accordingly address the \r\nA/64/PV.32  \r\n \r\n09-58799 8 \r\n \r\nrequest for the indication of provisional measures \r\nsubmitted by Georgia.” \r\nTherefore, we expect that all members of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice will uphold the standard \r\nof respect for the Court and its decisions.  \r\n I should now like to cite two brief quotations \r\nfrom the report of the Independent International Fact-\r\nFinding Mission on the Conflict in Georgia, to which I \r\njust referred. We have just heard that the aggression of \r\nthe Russian Federation was motivated by its will to \r\nrespond to what it ostensibly calls an attack by the \r\nGeorgian forces against civilians, which the Russian \r\nauthorities said at that time amounted to genocide. Let \r\nme read out a very brief quotation from paragraph 27 \r\nof volume I of the report of the International Mission:  \r\n  “After having carefully reviewed the facts \r\nin the light of the relevant law, the Mission \r\nconcludes that to the best of its knowledge \r\nallegations of genocide committed by the \r\nGeorgian side in the context of the August 2008 \r\nconflict and its aftermath are neither founded in \r\nlaw nor substantiated by factual evidence.”  \r\n To the contrary, the Mission found that the \r\nfollowing had been carried out by or with the \r\nparticipation of Russian forces:  \r\n “[T]he Mission found patterns of forced \r\ndisplacements of ethnic Georgians who had \r\nremained in their homes after the onset of \r\nhostilities. In addition, there was evidence of \r\nsystematic looting and destruction of ethnic \r\nGeorgian villages in South Ossetia. Consequently, \r\nseveral elements suggest the conclusion that \r\nethnic cleansing was indeed practiced against \r\nethnic Georgians in South Ossetia both during \r\nand after the August 2008 conflict.” \r\nI should like to read out one last quotation, from \r\npage 365 of volume II of the report: \r\n  “During and, in particular, after the conflict \r\na systematic and widespread campaign of looting \r\ntook place in South Ossetia and in the buffer zone \r\nagainst mostly ethnic Georgian houses and \r\nproperties. Ossetian forces, unidentified armed \r\nOssetians, and even Ossetian civilians \r\nparticipated in this campaign, with reports of \r\nRussian forces also being involved. The Russian \r\nforces failed to prevent these acts and, most \r\nimportantly, did not stop the looting and pillage \r\nafter the ceasefire, even in cases where they \r\nwitnessed it directly.” \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): May I \r\ntake it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to \r\nconclude its consideration of agenda item 72? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The meeting rose at 5.10 p.m. \r\n"
