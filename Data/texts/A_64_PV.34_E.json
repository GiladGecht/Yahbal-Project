(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) \r\n \r\n \r\n The meeting was called to order at 3.20 p.m. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 85 (continued) \r\n \r\nReport of the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General transmitting the \r\nreport of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (A/64/257) \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/64/L.7) \r\n \r\n Mr. Camp (United States of America): The \r\nUnited States would like to make a brief explanation of \r\nits position on draft resolution A/64/L.7 on the report \r\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). \r\nThe United States has co-sponsored this draft \r\nresolution as an expression of its strong support for the \r\nAgency in all facets of its work and its determination \r\nto cooperate with other Member States to strengthen \r\nthe Agency’s capabilities. \r\n However, we would like to note our reservations \r\nas to a particular resolution, on Israeli nuclear \r\ncapabilities, GC(53)/RES/17, adopted at the IAEA \r\nGeneral Conference in September. The United States \r\nbelieves that any effort to address the complexities at \r\nplay regarding nuclear-related issues in the Middle \r\nEast must be done in a comprehensive and \r\nnon-politicized atmosphere. \r\n The United States is committed to seeking \r\nmultilateral solutions to global challenges, and it is a \r\nsponsor of this resolution as a symbol of its support for \r\nthe Agency as an institution. The United States remains \r\ncommitted to working with other Member States to \r\nsupport the IAEA in its dual mission of expanding \r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy while preventing the \r\nproliferation of nuclear weapons. \r\n Mr. Valero Briceño (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): We thank Mr. Mohamed \r\nElBaradei, Director General of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for presenting the \r\nannual report on the work of the Agency. On behalf of \r\nthe Government of the Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela, we wish to give him our cordial, fraternal \r\ngreetings. We also wish to acknowledge the presence \r\nof the Permanent Representative of Malaysia, \r\nAmbassador Hamidon Ali, who this morning \r\nintroduced the draft resolution entitled “Report of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency” (A/64/L.7), as \r\nChairman of the Board of Governors of the IAEA. \r\nVenezuela supports the report and the draft resolution.  \r\n The IAEA has consolidated itself as a competent \r\nbody for scientific and technical cooperation in the \r\narea of nuclear energy and for verifying compliance \r\nwith the obligations contracted to in accordance with \r\nthe respective safeguards agreements with member \r\nStates.  \r\n My delegation expresses its concern at actions \r\nwhich seek to undermine the Agency’s legitimacy. No \r\nother international body can assume the responsibilities \r\nwhich States parties to the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) have \r\ngiven as sovereign States to the IAEA when it comes to \r\nnuclear matters. \r\nA/64/PV.34  \r\n \r\n09-59092 2 \r\n \r\n At times, when undue interference has occurred, \r\nthere were serious violations of the principles of \r\ninternational law and international humanitarian law. \r\nPeoples have experienced acts of aggression and \r\ncrimes against humanity and suffered from the \r\ndestruction of their economies, their cultural \r\ndevelopment and their political and religious systems.  \r\n Last 24 September, the Security Council adopted \r\nresolution 1887 (2009) on non-proliferation. By \r\nattempting to take jurisdiction solely over questions of \r\nnon-proliferation, the transparency required by the \r\nentire disarmament and non-proliferation mechanism is \r\nendangered, especially the technical process of \r\nverification. \r\n My delegation rejects any initiative that attempts \r\nto ignore and delegitmize the multilateral disarmament \r\nregime previously negotiated in the relevant \r\nmultilateral forums or that seeks to undermine the \r\ntechnical, non-political character of institutions created \r\nto deal with this matter. \r\n The IAEA works on the basis of the inalienable \r\nright of States to develop peaceful uses of nuclear \r\nenergy in compliance with the international \r\ncommitments made in accordance with article IV of the \r\nNPT. For this reason, we stress that any attempt to \r\nredefine the delicate balance of the rights and \r\nobligations contained in the NPT can result in \r\nundermining the system that the Treaty has established — \r\na system which relies on general acceptance. \r\n My delegation recognizes the laudable efforts of \r\nthe IAEA to strengthen international cooperation in \r\nnuclear safety, radiation safety, safe transportation and \r\nthe management of nuclear waste.  \r\n We wish to highlight the progress made in the \r\nvarious activities intended to maintain and increase \r\nsecurity, including those having to do with the \r\nnetworks of information and communication for \r\nnuclear and radiation security and those oriented \r\ntowards the strengthening of national regulatory \r\ninfrastructures with jurisdiction over the control of \r\nradioactive sources. \r\n As a signatory to the NPT, Venezuela has \r\nmaintained active participation in established \r\ncooperation machinery. In 2007-2008, it chaired the \r\ntechnical cooperation body for Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean, known as the Regional Cooperation \r\nAgreement for the Advancement of Nuclear Science \r\nand Technology in Latin America and the Caribbean \r\n(ARCAL), and it held the chair of the ARCAL \r\nrepresentatives body, known as ORA, and the so-called \r\ntripartite forum. \r\n Our country has benefited from technical and \r\nfinancial cooperation provided by the IAEA through \r\nARCAL. Several projects moved forward within the \r\nframework of that cooperation in the biennium 2007-\r\n2008. We viewed as highly significant Mr. ElBaradei’s \r\nvisit to Venezuela last March, where he had extremely \r\nproductive meetings with senior authorities in the \r\nenergy, oil and science and technologies sectors. He \r\nwas welcomed by Ms. Cilia Flores, Speaker of the \r\nVenezuelan National Assembly.  \r\n Our country was elected by acclamation as a \r\nmember of the Board of Governors of the IAEA for \r\n2009-2010 in elections held from 14 to 18 September. \r\nVenezuela will contribute to maintain the Agency as \r\nthe single forum with jurisdiction over nuclear energy, \r\nand the promotion and defence of all of its objectives, \r\nincluding disarmament, nuclear non-proliferation and \r\nverification, and the sovereign right to assist all States \r\nto develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. \r\n Allow me to express again our appreciation of the \r\nefforts made by outgoing Director General \r\nMr. Mohamed ElBaradei during the 12 years that he \r\nled this organization. We also wish to express the \r\nsupport of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela for the \r\nnew Director General, Mr. Yukiya Amano. \r\n Mr. Dabbashi (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): This is the last time that Mr. Mohamed \r\nElBaradei will submit the annual report of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to the \r\nGeneral Assembly. Allow us, at the outset, to express \r\nto him our deepest appreciation and gratitude for the \r\nexemplary efforts he has made to enhance the role of \r\nthe IAEA and expand its activities, especially in \r\nstrengthening its role in verifying information with the \r\nutmost credibility and honesty. \r\n I would also like to commend the efforts of the \r\nAgency itself in assisting developing countries in the \r\narea of the peaceful use and development of nuclear \r\ntechnology. Libya reaffirms the right of all States to \r\nobtain nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, \r\nwithout discrimination, and to receive the assistance \r\nboth of the IAEA and other countries able to extend \r\nsuch assistance. \r\n A/64/PV.34\r\n \r\n3 09-59092 \r\n \r\n We believe in the important role that the IAEA \r\nplays in preventing the proliferation of nuclear \r\nweapons. At the same time, however, we regret that the \r\nrole of the Agency is not universal, since it does not \r\ninclude oversight of the nuclear activities of nuclear-\r\nweapon States, a shortcoming for an Agency that \r\nshould be universal and not exclude any States. We \r\nhope the international community can succeed in \r\nreviewing the IAEA’s mandate so that it can oversee \r\nnuclear activities without discrimination, especially \r\nregarding the reductions in nuclear arsenals announced \r\nby nuclear-weapon States and aimed at achieving total \r\nand comprehensive nuclear disarmament. \r\n Libya affirms the need to bolster the credibility of \r\nthe IAEA in its vital role as the only specialized \r\nauthority responsible for verification and \r\nimplementation of the safeguards arrangements by \r\nmember States within the framework of the Treaty on \r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), in \r\norder to prevent channelling nuclear power away from \r\npeaceful uses towards use in nuclear weapons or other \r\nforms of nuclear explosives. \r\n The IAEA is considered the international \r\ncoordinator for technical cooperation in the nuclear \r\nfield and must continue to play this role alone, with no \r\ncompetition. My country would like to take the path of \r\ndialogue and negotiation in dealing with certain \r\npending issues with some States so that adequate \r\nsolutions can be found through peaceful means. Libya \r\naffirms the need to designate regions free of nuclear \r\nweapons and to strengthen such regions. We also stress \r\nthe importance of strengthening the NPT.  \r\n We are deeply concerned that there has been no \r\nprogress in making the Middle East a region free of \r\nnuclear weapons, only because the Israelis, as the only \r\nentity in the region possessing nuclear weapons, \r\ncontinue to be obstinate in this regard. Unfortunately \r\nthis country still refuses to place all its nuclear \r\nfacilities under the IAEA’s comprehensive safeguards \r\nregime. The international community must, therefore, \r\ndeter this country and force it to place its nuclear \r\nfacilities under international oversight. Such an \r\nintransigent position will keep the region in a constant \r\nstate of tension and hamper the achievement of \r\nsecurity and stability both in the region and around the \r\nworld. In this regard, we welcome the resolution \r\nadopted by the IAEA in September on Israeli nuclear \r\ncapabilities, and we call for its implementation. \r\n Libya has excellent cooperative ties with the \r\nIAEA, and we look forward to continued cooperation \r\nso that Libya may gain maximum benefit from peaceful \r\nuses of nuclear energy after its voluntary disposal of its \r\nweapons of mass destruction, including nuclear \r\nweapons. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): We have now \r\nheard the last speaker in the debate on this item. \r\n We shall now proceed to consider draft resolution \r\nA/64/L.7. Before giving the floor to the representative \r\nof the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, who \r\nwishes to speak in explanation of position before we \r\ntake action on the draft resolution, may I remind \r\ndelegations that explanations of vote or position are \r\nlimited to 10 minutes and should be made by \r\ndelegations from their seats. \r\n Mr. Sin Song Chol (Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea): The delegation of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea wishes to highlight the \r\nfollowing position with regard to draft resolution \r\nA/64/L.7, entitled “Report of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency” (IAEA). The current draft takes note \r\nof the IAEA report and its resolution GC(53)/RES/15, \r\nadopted at the General Conference of the Agency, \r\nwhich refers to the nuclear issue on the Korean \r\npeninsula. \r\n Regrettably, the IAEA has once again shown its \r\nprejudice and has taken an unfair position by urging \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to \r\nimplement the relevant resolutions of the Security \r\nCouncil and return to talks without preconditions. My \r\ndelegation categorically rejects this. Such behaviour by \r\nthe IAEA is nothing but intentional disregard of the \r\nnature of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. \r\nActing in concert with one side, it places artificial \r\nobstacles in the way of resolving the issue. \r\n My delegation would like to point out the \r\nfollowing for the better understanding by United \r\nNations Member States on the nuclear issue. First, the \r\nnuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is a direct \r\nproduct of United States nuclear threats and its hostile \r\npolicy towards the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea. The United States nuclear threat against the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea is no fiction at \r\nall. The threat began as early as the Korean War of \r\n1950 to 1953, and consequently inflicted on millions of \r\nKoreans the new sufferings of separated families. The \r\nUnited States has gone even further today to target the \r\nA/64/PV.34  \r\n \r\n09-59092 4 \r\n \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea within its \r\npre-emptive nuclear strike zone, making its threat all \r\nthe more realistic. \r\n Secondly, the hostile policy of the United States \r\ntowards the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nhas now become so reckless that the United States \r\nwants to deprive our country, by means of force, of its \r\nright to explore and use outer space for peaceful \r\npurposes. Although the satellite launch of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea was conducted \r\npursuant to the relevant international legal procedures, \r\nthe United States committed unprecedented hostilities \r\nsuch as singling out the launch only at the Security \r\nCouncil to condemn it and translate sanctions into \r\nconcrete actions. \r\n Thus far, the process aimed at denuclearizing the \r\nKorean peninsula had been undertaken on the basis of \r\nthe principle of sovereign equality. Nevertheless, the \r\nhostile acts of the United States resulted in the \r\nbreakdown of the whole process of dialogue and \r\nunavoidably pushed the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea to take strong countermeasures, such as \r\nconducting the second nuclear test. \r\n The United States pushed the situation on the \r\nKorean peninsula to the brink of war by ignoring the \r\nrepeated demands of the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea for the conclusion of a peace treaty to replace \r\nthe current armistice agreement and by deliberately \r\nstaging nuclear war exercises with our country as the \r\ntarget.  \r\n Moreover, the United States, which had \r\naggravated the tension on the Korean peninsula and \r\nsystematically obstructed the process of improving \r\ninter-Korean relations and reunification, came recently \r\nto pledge to provide a so-called expanded deterrence to \r\nSouth Korea. That surely increases the tension on the \r\nKorean peninsula and darkens the perspective of \r\ndenuclearization. It is not at all in harmony with the \r\ncurrent climate of dialogue resumption and is making \r\nthe security environment on the peninsula escalate into \r\nan unpredictable phase. \r\n That being the case, the IAEA remains indifferent \r\nto the hostile acts carried out against the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea by the United States, which \r\nhave pushed our country into possessing nuclear \r\nweapons, reversed the situation on the Korean \r\npeninsula by worsening the confrontation and called \r\ninto question the exercise by the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea of its sovereign right. This stance of \r\nthe Agency can in no way be justified. \r\n Thirdly, the Government of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea remains unchanged in its \r\nposition aimed at denuclearizing the Korean peninsula \r\nand the rest of the world. The denuclearization of the \r\nKorean peninsula was the lifelong wish of our \r\nPresident Kim Il Sung. As we know from looking back \r\nto the origin of the nuclear issue, and as we have \r\nlearned from the past process of dialogue, the \r\nprerequisite for the denuclearization of the Korean \r\npeninsula is, first and foremost, the termination of the \r\nhostile policy of the United States towards the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea.  \r\n The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has \r\nalready made it clear that it is ready to participate in \r\nthe multilateral talks, depending on the outcome of \r\nbilateral talks with the United States, and that such \r\nmultilateral talks must also include the Six-Party Talks. \r\n As we have reiterated time and again, the mission \r\nof the nuclear deterrence of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea is aimed purely at deterring war by \r\nsafeguarding the peace and security not only of the \r\nKorean peninsula, but also of the region, from the \r\nnuclear threat and military attacks of the United States. \r\nThe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea does not \r\npursue a nuclear arms race and will fulfil its \r\nresponsibilities vis-à-vis the management and use of its \r\nnuclear weapons and with regard to non-proliferation \r\nand nuclear disarmament while possessing those \r\nnuclear weapons. \r\n The delegation of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea stands in full support of and \r\nsolidarity with the majority of United Nations Member \r\nStates that aspire to a nuclear-free world and calls for \r\nthe complete dismantlement of nuclear weapons. At the \r\nsame time, we reiterate once again that the IAEA \r\nshould observe the principle of impartiality in all its \r\nactivities. \r\n The delegation of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea would like to request the Secretariat \r\nto duly and correctly reflect the aforementioned \r\nposition of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nin the official records of this meeting. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): We have heard \r\nthe only speaker in explanation of position.  \r\n A/64/PV.34\r\n \r\n5 09-59092 \r\n \r\n The Assembly will now take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/64/L.7. I should like to announce that, \r\nsince the introduction of the draft resolution, the \r\nfollowing countries have become sponsors: Benin, \r\nChad, the Dominican Republic, Madagascar and the \r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania.  \r\n May I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt \r\ndraft resolution A/64/L.7? \r\n  Draft resolution A/64/L.7 was adopted (resolution \r\n64/8). \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I now call on \r\nthe representative of Israel, who wishes to speak in \r\nexplanation of position on the resolution just adopted. \r\nMay I remind delegations that explanations of vote are \r\nlimited to 10 minutes and should be made by \r\ndelegations from their seats. \r\n Mr. Itzchaki (Israel): Israel asked for the floor to \r\nexpress its disappointment at the results of this year’s \r\nGeneral Conference of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (IAEA). Israel believes that this year’s General \r\nConference has impaired the ability of the Conference \r\nto constructively address issues pertaining to the \r\nMiddle East. \r\n Unfortunately, at the IAEA General Conference \r\nthis year, States in the region failed to demonstrate the \r\nnecessary will to promote regional talks on the \r\nestablishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone, as \r\ndemonstrated by the resolutions on the Middle East, \r\nincluding the one-sided, discriminative resolution on \r\nthe so-called Israeli nuclear capabilities, which was \r\nadopted by a narrow majority. That resolution sought \r\nto divert attention away from the blatant cases of \r\nnon-compliance by several Middle Eastern States with \r\nobligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons. \r\n It should be noted that, prior to and during the \r\nGeneral Conference, Israel made every effort to regain \r\na consensus on the Middle East package. Israel trusts \r\nand hopes that the unfortunate circumstances that have \r\ncast a dark shadow over the handling by the IAEA \r\nGeneral Conference of the resolutions pertaining to the \r\nMiddle East will not recur next year. Israel will \r\ncontinue to dedicate all its efforts to achieving a stable \r\nenvironment of peace and reconciliation in the Middle \r\nEast. We call upon our neighbours to do the same. \r\n Finally, Israel wishes to disassociate itself from \r\nthe reference in the report with regard to the so-called \r\nIsraeli attack on the Dair Alzour site in Syria. That \r\npolitically motivated reference contradicts the long-\r\nstanding practice of the Agency’s professionalism. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): We have heard \r\nthe only speaker in explanation of position.  \r\n May I take it that it is the wish of the General \r\nAssembly to conclude its consideration of agenda \r\nitem 85? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 116 \r\n \r\nFollow-up to the commemoration of the two-\r\nhundredth anniversary of the abolition of the \r\ntransatlantic slave trade  \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/64/299) \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/64/L.10) \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): Slavery and the \r\n400-year-long transatlantic slave trade were abhorrent \r\nand inhumane and marked the lowest point in the \r\nhistory of humanity. The horrific and dehumanizing \r\nnature of the slave trade, whereby the captives were \r\nshackled and forced into detention and transported as \r\nhuman cargo and mere chattels across the Atlantic to \r\nthe so-called New World, constituted the worst form of \r\nmoral depravity on the part of the captors and is a \r\nsource of shame for all of humanity. \r\n That loathsome human disaster engendered the \r\ndestruction of human possibility and necessitated the \r\nredefining of African humanity to the world. It \r\npoisoned the relations of Africans with others, who \r\nonly saw African people through the stereotyping lens \r\nof slavery, thus hobbling any truly human relations \r\namong peoples. \r\n Although that horrendous practice has been \r\nbrought to an end, its effects and consequences \r\ncontinue to be with us. That remains true in spite of the \r\nadoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \r\nin 1948, the Slavery Convention Protocol in 1955, the \r\nDurban Declaration in 2001 and more. Racism, racial \r\ndiscrimination, xenophobia and other related forms of \r\nintolerance are still rife today, 200 years after the \r\nabolition in 1808 of the slave trade. \r\n At today’s commemoration, therefore, we must \r\nresolve to take concrete steps not only to ensure that \r\nthis dark aspect of human history never resurfaces \r\nA/64/PV.34  \r\n \r\n09-59092 6 \r\n \r\nagain, but that its consequences are fully addressed. \r\nTangible efforts must be made to redress the imbalance \r\ncaused by the slave trade. Lest we forget, the United \r\nNations and the entire international community must \r\ncontinue to inform the world of this conscience-jolting \r\nchapter in our history.  \r\n In this regard, Member States may wish to \r\nsupport the voluntary fund established pursuant to \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 62/122 towards the \r\nerection of a permanent memorial in honour of the \r\nvictims of slavery and the slave trade. \r\n Let us also applaud the unbelievable magnanimity \r\nand generosity of the victims, who managed to retain \r\ntheir humanity and the ability to forgive in the face of \r\nindescribable suffering and dehumanization. \r\n I now give the floor to the representative of Saint \r\nKitts and Nevis to introduce draft resolution A/64/L.10. \r\n Mr. Bart (Saint Kitts and Nevis): I would like to \r\nannounce that since the submission of draft resolution \r\nA/64/L.10 the following countries have become \r\nsponsors: Albania, Armenia, Austria, Belarus, Bulgaria, \r\nCanada, China, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cuba, Ecuador, \r\nEstonia, France, Georgia, Greece, Hungary, India, \r\nIsrael, Japan, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Malta, Monaco, \r\nPakistan, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Peru, the \r\nPhilippines, the Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovenia, \r\nthe Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Turkey, \r\nUkraine, the United States of America and the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela. \r\n I have the honour, on behalf of the 14 States \r\nmembers of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), \r\nalong with the 54 members of the African Group and \r\nthe other Members of the United Nations sponsoring \r\nthis text, including those that I have just identified, to \r\nintroduce draft resolution A/64/L.10, entitled “Permanent \r\nmemorial to and remembrance of the victims of slavery \r\nand the transatlantic slave trade”. \r\n The draft resolution before us today contains \r\nsome procedural updates and also provides information \r\non developments that have taken place during the \r\ncourse of the past year. We have maintained a focused \r\ntext that serves a dual purpose. It speaks to the annual \r\nremembrance as well to as the initiative to erect a \r\npermanent memorial to honour the victims of slavery \r\nand the transatlantic slave trade, both endorsed by the \r\nGeneral Assembly.  \r\n The States members of CARICOM are justifiably \r\nproud that as a result of our initiative the United \r\nNations acknowledged in 2006 that the system of \r\nslavery and the transatlantic slave trade, which spanned \r\nthe 1500s to the 1800s, represent one of the lowest \r\npoints in the history of humankind. As we gather once \r\nagain to contemplate the issue, we pause and recall the \r\nforced removal of more than 18 million people from \r\nAfrica to the Americas, the Caribbean, the United \r\nStates, Brazil and other parts of Latin America, as well \r\nas to Europe.  \r\n With this in mind, we deeply appreciate the \r\ndesignation of 25 March as the annual International \r\nDay of Remembrance of the Victims of Slavery and the \r\nTransatlantic Slave Trade. In this context and on behalf \r\nof the States members of CARICOM, I wish to thank \r\nthe Secretary-General for the update provided in his \r\nreport in document A/64/299, on activities held earlier \r\nthis year to commemorate the anniversary of the \r\nabolition of slavery and the transatlantic slave trade.  \r\n We look forward, Mr. President, to deepening our \r\ncollaboration with you, the Secretary-General, the \r\nSecretariat and, in particular, the Department of Public \r\nInformation, for similar commemorative activities on \r\n25 March 2010, reflecting the solemnity that should be \r\naccorded to such events, with due regard for the \r\ndignity of a race and people that were mercilessly \r\nrobbed of their human dignity and worth and plundered \r\nand pillaged under the pernicious system of slavery. \r\n As we reflect on our shared history, CARICOM \r\nmember States are mindful of the resulting legacy of \r\nsocial and economic inequality, hatred, bigotry, racism \r\nand prejudice — a legacy that is linked to current \r\neconomic and social inequalities worldwide and that \r\ncontinues to pervade the international community. We \r\nhighlight with pride the fact that our initiative is a \r\ntangible outcome of the process of the Durban World \r\nConference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, \r\nXenophobia and Related Intolerance, as indicated in \r\nthe fourth and fifth preambular paragraphs. The \r\nGeneral Assembly will note that for structural reasons \r\nwe have sought to keep the Durban-related paragraphs \r\ntogether. As a result, we have moved the former sixth \r\npreambular paragraph of resolution 63/5 to its current \r\nplace as the fifth preambular paragraph of the text \r\nbefore the Assembly today. \r\n We have included a new paragraph, the eighth \r\npreambular paragraph, to highlight the fact that our \r\n A/64/PV.34\r\n \r\n7 09-59092 \r\n \r\ninitiative, in terms of both the commemorative \r\nactivities and the permanent memorial, complements \r\nthe work being done at UNESCO. Here, I make special \r\nreference to the existing UNESCO International Day \r\nfor the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its \r\nAbolition, and the UNESCO Slave Route Project. \r\n We are pleased with the progress made by the \r\ncommittee drawn from all geographical regions of the \r\nUnited Nations that oversees the permanent memorial \r\nproject. Importantly, the States members of the \r\nCaribbean Community and the African Union are \r\nplaying a primary role in advancing the work of the \r\nCommittee under the chairmanship of Jamaica. \r\n In the interest of transparency and accountability, \r\nthe voluntary fund, the Permanent Memorial Fund, \r\nestablished in keeping with resolution 62/122, under \r\nthe custody of the Permanent Mission of Jamaica, has \r\nnow been closed, and the United Nations Trust Fund \r\nfor Partnerships — Permanent Memorial has been \r\nestablished under the auspices of the United Nations \r\nOffice for Partnerships. We are convinced that the \r\nTrust Fund ensures enhanced transparency and \r\naccountability of the Fund’s management in a manner \r\nthat will be acceptable to all Member States. That new \r\ninformation is indicated in operative paragraph 3, and \r\nwe are pleased to report that voluntary contributions \r\nreceived from Member States currently amount to \r\n$346,118. Additionally, this week we were advised that \r\nthe first private contribution of $10,000 was made to \r\nthe Trust Fund. \r\n In response to enquiries about the budgetary \r\nimplications arising from the adoption of this draft \r\nresolution, let me clarify that there are no such \r\nimplications for the permanent memorial initiative. It is \r\nour hope that the permanent memorial will become a \r\nreality through the generous contributions received \r\nvoluntarily from Member States, as well as the \r\nresource mobilization activities that will be organized \r\nby the Permanent Memorial Committee. On behalf of \r\nthe group of CARICOM States, I wish therefore to \r\nacknowledge with appreciation the contributions and \r\npledges already received towards the Trust Fund from \r\nMember States, while also encouraging Member States \r\nand other interested parties to join in this important \r\neffort. \r\n One of several initiatives to mobilize resources \r\nfor the permanent memorial was the appointment in \r\nMay of this year of a Goodwill Ambassador to assist in \r\nthat effort, as indicated in paragraph 4. The Goodwill \r\nAmbassador is the businessman, entertainment mogul \r\nand philanthropist Mr. Russell Simmons. We anticipate \r\nthat next year we will be in a position to provide a \r\ncomprehensive report on his efforts and on the other \r\nfund-raising initiatives and their outcomes. At the same \r\ntime, the importance of sustained voluntary \r\ncontributions in order to achieve the goal of erecting a \r\npermanent memorial in honour of the victims of \r\nslavery and the transatlantic slave trade cannot be \r\noverstated; hence the inclusion of a new paragraph, \r\nparagraph 5, to highlight that. \r\n CARICOM continues to be appreciative of the \r\ninvaluable support, technical advice and assistance \r\nreceived from the Secretary-General, the Secretariat \r\nand the members of the Committee for the \r\nimplementation of the permanent memorial project. An \r\nimportant element to move the project forward is the \r\nlaunch of an international design competition to make \r\nthis a truly global effort. We feel that UNESCO could \r\nundertake that on our behalf. It is to be noted that we \r\nare in a position to mobilize resources, et cetera, for \r\nUNESCO headquarters to run the initial phase of the \r\ncompetition, which, we envisage, could take place over \r\na two- or three-month period. The intention is for \r\nUNESCO to collect a pool of applications, using its \r\nglobal network of field offices and National \r\nCommissions, and to provide the Committee with a \r\nshort list of designs, from which an international jury \r\ncan select the winning entry. That international jury \r\nwould, of course, comprise individuals with some \r\nexpertise in contemporary art, sculpture, design and/or \r\nrelated disciplines. The second phase of the \r\ncompetition would be convened by the Committee in \r\nNew York. Initial discussions have begun with the \r\norganization, hence the references made in paragraphs \r\n9 and 10. \r\n Mr. Christian (Ghana), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n In view of UNESCO’s unique experience with the \r\nSlave Route Project, its extensive history, its tradition \r\nof conducting international competitions, its \r\ninternational standing and its status as part of the \r\nUnited Nations family, we are convinced that such a \r\npartnership is imperative for this global project. \r\nMoreover, as part of the United Nations system, it \r\nmakes it infinitely easier to deal with the organization \r\nin a seamless manner, rather than negotiating with an \r\nA/64/PV.34  \r\n \r\n09-59092 8 \r\n \r\noutside entity, since the Committee is obliged to follow \r\nUnited Nations rules and procurement guidelines. \r\n It is clear that racism, racial discrimination and \r\nprejudice continue to cast a destructive stain on many \r\nsocieties across the globe, and the genesis, as well as \r\nthe linkages with slavery and the transatlantic slave \r\ntrade are undoubtedly established. In that context, in \r\nparagraph 11, we seek to continue our collaboration \r\nwith the Department of Public Information to take \r\nappropriate steps to enhance world public awareness of \r\nthe commemorative activities and the permanent \r\nmemorial initiative, as well as to continue to facilitate \r\nefforts to erect the permanent memorial at United \r\nNations Headquarters. \r\n The horrific and dehumanizing nature of slavery \r\nand the slave trade, whereby the captives were forced \r\ninto detention and transported as human cargo, \r\ncontinues to jolt the conscience. The horrific images of \r\nhuman beings emasculated, sold and robbed of their \r\nculture, their skins branded by hot irons, recall and \r\nreinforce the depths of man’s inhumanity to man. \r\nConsequently, we have reiterated the request made in \r\nresolutions 61/19 and 63/5 for Member States that have \r\nnot already done so to develop educational programmes, \r\nincluding through their school curricula, designed to \r\neducate and inculcate in future generations an \r\nunderstanding of the lessons, history and consequences \r\nof slavery and the slave trade. \r\n Through the present draft resolution, the General \r\nAssembly will request the Secretary-General, in \r\ncollaboration with and building upon the work \r\nundertaken by UNESCO through the Slave Route \r\nProject, to continue the outreach programme in order to \r\ninculcate future generations with an understanding of \r\nthe causes, consequences and lessons of the \r\ntransatlantic slave trade and to inform of the dangers of \r\nracism and prejudice. The General Assembly, by its \r\nadoption of this important draft resolution by \r\nconsensus, will acknowledge the continued impact of \r\nslavery and the horrific transatlantic slave trade on the \r\nAfrican diaspora and its descendants, many of whom \r\nare in this Assembly today. \r\n In conclusion, the group of CARICOM member \r\nStates sincerely thanks the many sponsors and \r\nsupporters of the current draft resolution and now calls \r\nupon the General Assembly to give its unequivocal \r\nsupport to its adoption within the forthcoming week. In \r\nclosing, I take this opportunity to remind the General \r\nAssembly of the theme of the permanent memorial \r\ninitiative: “Acknowledging the tragedy, considering the \r\nlegacy, lest we forget”. \r\n Mr. Kapambwe (Zambia): The African Group is \r\npleased to take part in this important debate on agenda \r\nitem 116, entitled “Follow-up to the commemoration of \r\nthe two-hundredth anniversary of the abolition of the \r\ntransatlantic slave trade”. We also lend our support to \r\nthe draft resolution contained in document A/64/L.10, \r\nrelating to the permanent memorial to and \r\nremembrance of the victims of slavery and the \r\ntransatlantic slave trade, at the time of its introduction \r\nand adoption by the Assembly. \r\n Allow me at the outset, to convey our \r\nappreciation and commend the States members of the \r\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) for their \r\ncommitment and efforts in ensuring that we continue to \r\nreflect and examine the past injustices that had an \r\nadverse impact on our history. But, more importantly, \r\nwe celebrate the resilience of the human spirit to \r\nsurvive such adversity and the efforts that ensued to \r\nbring this unfortunate period of history to an end. \r\n Resolution 62/122 designated 25 March as the \r\nInternational Day of Remembrance of the Victims of \r\nSlavery and the Transatlantic Slave Trade. This year \r\nthe United Nations observed the second International \r\nDay to commemorate the victims of the slave trade, \r\nwhich was celebrated under the theme “Breaking the \r\nSilence: Beating the Drum”. The occasion was marked \r\nby a cultural evening of dance and concert and other \r\nevents, including documentaries and discussions with \r\nproducers. A briefing by NGOs was designed to raise \r\nawareness about the slave trade and its aftermath. \r\nOther activities were also organized throughout the \r\nyear, targeting various communities. Through education, \r\ntherefore, present and future generations will learn \r\nabout the causes and consequences of the slave trade \r\nand will be cautioned about the dangers of racism and \r\nprejudice, which unfortunately confront us to this day. \r\n We commend the Department of Public Information \r\nfor implementing resolution 63/5, which called for a \r\nprogramme of educational outreach on the transatlantic \r\nslave trade. \r\n The slave trade had a tragic impact on the African \r\npeople and continent. Its scars still remain. It is indeed \r\nour collective responsibility — and more particularly \r\nthat of Africans and those of African descent — to \r\ncommemorate the abolition of slavery and to recall its \r\n A/64/PV.34\r\n \r\n9 09-59092 \r\n \r\nhistorical legacy in order to ensure that this unfortunate \r\nepisode in our history is not forgotten and will never \r\nrecur. The African Group therefore welcomes the \r\nimportant initiatives that have taken place since the \r\nadoption of the previous year’s resolution, including: \r\nthe establishment of a committee of interested States to \r\noversee the permanent memorial project, with member \r\nStates of the Caribbean Community and the African \r\nUnion playing a primary role in collaboration with \r\nUNESCO, representatives of the Secretariat and other \r\ninstitutions; the establishment of a Trust Fund for the \r\nPermanent Memorial; the appointment of a Goodwill \r\nAmbassador to, among other things, garner \r\ninternational attention to the dangers of slavery and its \r\nlegacy of discrimination, raise awareness through \r\nmedia outreach and mobilize the necessary resources. \r\n Several countries have contributed to the Trust \r\nFund for the Permanent Memorial. I am glad to report \r\nthat several African countries are among the \r\ncontributors. In this regard, the African Group would \r\nlike to congratulate all those who have contributed and \r\nwe invite other countries to contribute to this worthy \r\nproject. \r\n The African Group remains firmly committed to \r\nthis project. As we indicated last year in this Assembly, \r\nthe Permanent Memorial will serve to remind us of the \r\nheroic actions of the slaves and other abolitionists, who \r\nin the face of grave danger and adversity stood up to be \r\ncounted. It will also serve as an educational resource \r\nand a statue of lifelong learning, a reconstruction of the \r\npast moulding the future and a constant reminder of \r\nhow vulnerable humanity is. \r\n Regrettably, in spite of international efforts in \r\ndeveloping the normative framework to guard against \r\nhuman rights abuses, we continue to face challenges in \r\nthe implementation of various human rights \r\ninstruments, in particular the International Convention \r\non the Elimination of All Forms of Racial \r\nDiscrimination, the Durban Declaration and \r\nProgramme of Action of the World Conference against \r\nRacism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and \r\nRelated Intolerance. New forms of slavery, such as \r\nhuman trafficking and sexual exploitation, are also \r\nemerging. There are also several incidences of bias and \r\nhate crimes in our societies. It is therefore incumbent \r\nupon us to firmly stand up to and reject any and all \r\nnotions of supremacy or supremacist ideology. We \r\nhave to guard against such vices and the danger of \r\nslipping back into the past. We must strive to be our \r\nbrother’s keeper and work relentlessly towards unity \r\nand development, by which all persons may be \r\nguaranteed a life of dignity. \r\n By adopting this draft resolution, we shall further \r\nbe pointing out the importance of gaining a better \r\nunderstanding of slave trade and slavery in general. We \r\nshall be committing ourselves to ensuring that \r\ninformation relating to the slave trade and slavery is \r\navailable and disseminated as appropriate to all \r\nsections of society, in particular in institutions of \r\nlearning, so that they too can join efforts in the \r\npromotion of a cohesive society based on knowledge \r\nand understanding of our history and so as to ensure \r\nthat society does not slip back into the brutality of the \r\npast. By encouraging learning about slavery, we will \r\nreduce the danger of making in the future the same \r\nmistakes we made in the past. \r\n In conclusion, I wish to reiterate the African \r\nGroup’s support for draft resolution A/64/L.10 and to \r\nexpress support for the efforts by the United Nations \r\nsystem and countries to create awareness of issues \r\nrelating to slavery and the transatlantic slave trade over \r\nthe past year. It is our sincere hope that more will be \r\ndone in the coming year to honour all those gallant \r\nvictims of slave trade, the brave abolitionists and the \r\ncollective international efforts that led to the abolition \r\nof the slave trade and slavery. \r\n Mrs. Kolontai (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): \r\nSlavery and the transatlantic slave trade have been \r\namong the most flagrant violations of human rights. \r\nThe transatlantic slave trade was an exceptional \r\nphenomenon in the history of slavery — exceptional \r\nbecause of its duration, scope and legal basis, including \r\nits legitimacy embodied in law. There can be no doubt \r\nthat the result of the transatlantic slave trade was the \r\ndestruction of a wide range of languages, cultures and \r\nreligions of millions of enslaved Africans. It has left a \r\nlegacy of racism and stereotypes. \r\n The Republic of Belarus endorses the report of \r\nthe Secretary-General entitled “Programme of \r\neducational outreach on the transatlantic slave trade \r\nand slavery” (A/64/299). We agree with the view that, \r\ndespite the fact that the transatlantic slave trade enjoys \r\nconsiderable attention in world history, we still do not \r\nknow enough about its long-term results as they are felt \r\nin today’s world or about the important contribution \r\nthat slaves made to the building of the socio-economic \r\nprosperity of the countries that enslaved them. We \r\nA/64/PV.34  \r\n \r\n09-59092 10 \r\n \r\nbelieve that the problems of history must be solved by \r\nfilling gaps and enhancing the awareness of the \r\ndescendants of those who were enslaved and other \r\npeople as to the historic aspects of that tragedy, as well \r\nas to the threat inherent in racism and racial \r\ndiscrimination. We are certain that these goals can be \r\neffectively served in the outreach programme proposed \r\nby the Secretary-General in cooperation with UNESCO. \r\n We welcome the holding this year of a number of \r\nactivities together with the United Nations on the theme, \r\n“Breaking the Silence: Beating the Drum”. Those \r\nactivities have enabled us to shed light on the history of \r\nslavery and the transatlantic slave trade and stimulate a \r\ndiscussion of the reasons, consequences and legacy of \r\nthe slave trade.  \r\n We support the efforts of the member States of the \r\nCaribbean Community and the African Union to erect at \r\nthe United Nations a permanent memorial to those who \r\nhave suffered from slavery and the transatlantic slave \r\ntrade and to name a goodwill ambassador to coordinate \r\nthese activities. We welcome also the adoption by the \r\nGeneral Assembly of a resolution that, inter alia, \r\nproclaimed 25 March the International Day of \r\nRemembrance of the Victims of Slavery and the \r\nTransatlantic Slave Trade (resolution 62/122).  \r\n Today, we commemorate the abolition of the slave \r\ntrade but we must recognize the fact that the struggle \r\nagainst slavery continues. Two hundred years later, \r\nmillions of people are still being taken from their homes \r\nand families to be transported hundreds or thousands of \r\nmiles and sold into slavery. According to International \r\nLabour Organization data, at least 12.3 million people, \r\nadults and children, are subjected to forced labour, or are \r\nforced to work to pay off debts or to offer sexual \r\nservices. It must be acknowledged that illicit human \r\ntrafficking is nothing other than a contemporary form of \r\nthe slave trade that cannot be ignored. \r\n Bearing in mind the experience and potential of the \r\nUnited Nations, Belarus has in fact advocated for the \r\ncreation of a thematic global partnership against human \r\ntrafficking and slavery in the twenty-first century. This \r\npartnership is still an informal mechanism that took \r\nshape at the Vienna Forum to Fight Human Trafficking \r\nheld in February 2008. For such a mechanism to be \r\neffective, it would have to take some sort of institutional \r\nform as part of, for instance, a global plan of action \r\nadopted by the General Assembly to combat human \r\ntrafficking. In the Third Committee at the sixty-fourth \r\nsession Belarus has proposed a draft resolution to \r\nimprove coordination of efforts to combat human \r\ntrafficking. We believe that the implementation of the \r\nprovisions of the draft resolution, one of which contains \r\na call for active participation in drafting a global plan of \r\naction to combat human trafficking, would be a \r\nsignificant contribution to the international efforts aimed \r\nat eliminating this shameful contemporary phenomenon. \r\nWe call upon States to join the sponsors in supporting \r\nthis draft resolution. \r\n As we support the noble goal of ending \r\ncontemporary forms of slavery and recognize the need to \r\ncoordinate a United Nations approach to dealing with \r\nthat problem, the Republic of Belarus has also joined the \r\nsponsors of the draft resolution to erect a permanent \r\nmemorial to the victims of slavery and the transatlantic \r\nslave trade (A/64/L.10). \r\n The Universal Declaration of Human Rights \r\nproclaims that no one should be held in slavery or kept \r\nin servitude and that slavery and the slave trade should \r\nbe banned in all its forms. Our duty is to see to it that \r\nsuch a situation never arises again in the future. \r\n Mr. Wolfe (Jamaica): My delegation wishes to \r\nassociate itself with the statements made by the \r\nrepresentatives of Saint Kitts and Nevis, who spoke on \r\nbehalf of the 14 member States of the Caribbean \r\nCommunity (CARICOM), and of Zambia, who spoke on \r\nbehalf of the 54 members of the Group of African States. \r\n It is an honour to participate in the discussion on \r\nslavery and the transatlantic slave trade, particularly as I \r\nrepresent the country, and indeed the region, from \r\nwhence the idea to include this issue on the United \r\nNations agenda originated. It is with a distinct sense of \r\nhonour and pride that, given our historical realities and \r\nancestral links, I draw attention to the strong partnership \r\nthat has developed between the member States of \r\nCARICOM, on the one hand, and the Group of African \r\nStates, on the other, as we jointly seek to make the \r\nerection of a permanent memorial at the United Nations \r\na reality. It is on this basis that our 68 member States \r\njointly co-sponsor the annual resolution under this \r\nagenda item (A/64/L.10). \r\n Although much had been said about the tragedy of \r\nslavery and its horrific nature, neither the grave \r\nhumanitarian injustice of the pernicious system nor the \r\nattendant human rights abuses have ever been properly \r\naddressed at the global level. Additionally, the legacy of \r\nhatred, bigotry, racism and prejudice, have, among other \r\n A/64/PV.34\r\n \r\n11 09-59092 \r\n \r\nthings, given rise to social and economic inequalities \r\nthat exist in many countries today. \r\n For these reasons, the intention is to secure \r\ncontinued international recognition and acknowledgement \r\nof the tragedy of slavery, which represents a dark period \r\nin the history of humankind; to educate and inform \r\ncurrent future generations about the causes, \r\nconsequences and lessons of slavery and the transatlantic \r\nslave trade; and to inculcate new values in successive \r\ngenerations so that this mammoth historical tragedy is \r\nnever repeated. \r\n Let me solemnly state that, as chairman of the \r\ncommittee established to oversee the initiative, I will \r\nnow take a few moments to provide an overview of some \r\nof the work we have been undertaking behind the scenes \r\nwith a view to implementation. During the course of \r\n2009, our focus has been on establishing the \r\nadministrative framework and on mobilizing resources. \r\nAgainst this background, the committee concluded a \r\nmemorandum of understanding with the United Nations \r\nOffice for Partnerships (UNOP) and outlined a broad \r\nframework for collaboration, with a view to \r\nimplementing the decision to erect a permanent \r\nmemorial. Just recently — about a week ago — and \r\nfollowing very lengthy and detailed consultations, the \r\ncommittee came to an agreement on a budget. \r\n As stated in the draft resolution (A/64/L.10) to be \r\nadopted by the General Assembly, voluntary \r\ncontributions are encouraged from Member States and \r\nother interested parties. However, in order to achieve the \r\ntarget of approximately $4 million, the project will also \r\ntarget corporations, philanthropists and other private \r\nindividuals. \r\n It is with that in mind that the committee appointed \r\na goodwill ambassador to assist with the dual objective \r\nof raising international awareness and mobilizing \r\nresources. In the next couple of weeks, with the \r\nassistance of UNOP, we will also establish an advisory \r\nboard to follow through on the previously stated \r\nobjectives. In the not-too-distant future, we also intend \r\nto find a mechanism through which we can obtain \r\ncontributions from ordinary citizens around the world, \r\nsince we believe this project to be a truly global effort. \r\n During the course of this month, our first fund-\r\nraising event will be held at the Ana Tzarev Gallery, here \r\nin New York. Members of the public will be invited to \r\nparticipate in a silent auction of paintings exhibited \r\nunder the theme “Grace of Africa” to raise funds for the \r\ninitiative. A high-level grand gala event is scheduled for \r\nFebruary 2010, in keeping with the celebration of Black \r\nhistory month, and a number of other creative events for \r\nraising funds will also be held during 2010. Information \r\non these activities will be shared with Member States, as \r\nappropriate. \r\n Since we last discussed voluntary contributions by \r\nMember States in this Hall, the Citibank account under \r\nJamaica’s control has been closed. We worked in tandem \r\nwith the United Nations Office for Partnerships to \r\nestablish the Trust Fund for Partnerships — Permanent \r\nMemorial, to which the funds from Citibank and interest \r\naccruing thereto were transferred. As mentioned by the \r\nPermanent Representative of Saint Kitts and Nevis and \r\nreflected in the draft resolution before us today, the \r\nnumber of countries that have made voluntary \r\ncontributions now stands at 34 and that the amount \r\ncontributed has reached $346,118. We are equally \r\npleased that the first private contribution of $10,000 was \r\nrecently made to the Trust Fund. \r\n May I thank the Governments of Antigua and \r\nBarbuda, Argentina, Australia, the Bahamas, Barbados, \r\nBelize, Botswana, Brazil, Ecuador, Egypt, India, \r\nIndonesia, Haiti, Luxembourg, Libya, Malaysia, Malta, \r\nMozambique — which contributed on behalf of the \r\nSouthern African Development Community — Namibia, \r\nPortugal, Qatar, South Africa, Spain, Saint Lucia, Saint \r\nKitts and Nevis, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, the \r\nSudan, Suriname, Syria, Turkey, the United Kingdom \r\nand my own country, Jamaica, for their contributions. \r\nWe envisage that other countries will follow in their \r\nfootsteps in making contributions to the Trust Fund for \r\nthe Permanent Memorial. I would also like to make \r\nspecial mention here of Denmark and the Netherlands, \r\nwhich have made pledges to the Fund. \r\n Let me take this opportunity to encourage Member \r\nStates to lend support to the permanent memorial \r\ninitiative within the context of UNESCO. As we seek to \r\ntake steps towards implementation of the decision to \r\nerect the permanent memorial at United Nations \r\nHeadquarters, we feel that collaboration with UNESCO \r\nheadquarters is of critical importance to the conduct of \r\nthe international design competition. This view was \r\nalready specifically mentioned in the statement made by \r\nthe Chairman of CARICOM, the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Saint Kitts and Nevis. \r\n Jamaica and other CARICOM member States have \r\nbeen given a mandate by the Council of CARICOM \r\nA/64/PV.34  \r\n \r\n09-59092 12 \r\n \r\nForeign Ministers to engage the Caribbean diaspora in \r\nthis initiative. Accordingly, the Permanent Memorial \r\nCommittee will undertake steps to do so in the first \r\nquarter of 2010. We anticipate that this engagement will \r\nextend to other sections of the African diaspora, and \r\nindeed to non-governmental and other civil society \r\ngroups within the African continent. In so doing, we \r\nhope to connect with and secure the support of Africans \r\nand persons of African descent under the theme we have \r\nselected: “Acknowledging the tragedy, considering the \r\nlegacy, lest we forget”. \r\n In closing, I note that the lingering consequences \r\nof the transatlantic slave trade continue to impact the \r\ndescendants of the victims even today. It has far-\r\nreaching implications at the international level and \r\ntherefore deserves global recognition and \r\nacknowledgment. Consequently, the placement of the \r\npermanent memorial at United Nations Headquarters \r\nwill be an appropriate symbol of what the United \r\nNations represents — the promotion and preservation of \r\nthe dignity and worth of all human beings — principles \r\nthat are central to the Charter of the United Nations. \r\n Mrs. Viotti (Brazil): During his first visit to Africa \r\nin 2003, President Lula acknowledged our historic debt \r\nto Africa and referred to the millions who were victims \r\nof the transatlantic slave trade. Many of them had Brazil \r\nas their destination. \r\n This tragedy has marked our history, but it has also \r\nleft a positive legacy through the extraordinary \r\ncontribution of the Afro-descendant population to \r\nBrazilian society. We are proud of our African heritage, \r\nwhich has permeated our culture in all its aspects. We \r\nare furthermore particularly committed to promoting \r\nsocial equality for the Afro-descendant population and \r\ncombating racial discrimination in our country and \r\nelsewhere. At the regional level, we have sponsored \r\nmany initiatives, including an enhanced convention on \r\nthe fight against racism in the Organization of American \r\nStates. \r\n The remembrance of the two-hundredth \r\nanniversary of the abolition of the transatlantic slave \r\ntrade should also remind us that a worldwide consensus \r\non the relevance of that date is not enough. We should \r\nspare no effort to achieve genuine equality of rights for \r\nall. Prejudices of all sorts still defy us. Individuals, \r\nenterprises, non-governmental organizations and States \r\nmust work together to eradicate intolerance and, in \r\nparticular, to fulfil the provisions of the Durban \r\nDeclaration. \r\n The Brazilian Government has put in practice \r\nmany of the measures contained in the Declaration and \r\nits Programme of Action. The promotion of racial \r\nequality is consistent with basic features of Brazilian \r\nculture and an integral part of our own social and \r\neconomic development process. Issues such as the \r\ninteraction among different ethnic groups and the history \r\nof Afro-Brazilian and African cultures are increasingly \r\nbeing incorporated into school curricula. They are now \r\npart of policies intended to promote social integration. \r\nSpecial attention has been devoted to traditional Afro-\r\nBrazilian communities known as the Quilombola \r\ncommunities, with positive results having been achieved \r\nin the promotion of their rights during the past few \r\nyears. These policies are aimed at redressing the \r\ninjustices suffered by the victims of racial \r\ndiscrimination. \r\n I wish to thank the Secretary-General for his report \r\non the programme of educational outreach on the \r\ntransatlantic slave trade and slavery (A/64/299). We \r\nappreciate his continued efforts and the Secretariat’s \r\ncontribution to promoting the initiative of creating a \r\npermanent memorial at United Nations Headquarters to \r\nacknowledge the tragedy of slavery and the slave trade. \r\nThe report calls for the implementation of an outreach \r\nprogramme aimed at educating present and future \r\ngenerations about the causes, consequences, lessons and \r\nlegacy of a transatlantic slave trade that endured for 500 \r\nyears and to communicate the dangers of racism and \r\nprejudice. Brazil fully supports those goals. We would \r\nalso like to recognize and commend the leadership of \r\nJamaica in this matter.  \r\n Brazil is honoured to be a sponsor of draft \r\nresolution A/64/L.10, just introduced by the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Saint Kitts and Nevis. We welcome the \r\ncommemoration since 2008 of 25 March as the annual \r\nInternational Day of Remembrance of the Victims of \r\nSlavery and the Transatlantic Slave Trade. We also \r\nwelcome the appointment of a Goodwill Ambassador to \r\nhelp raise awareness of the legacy of slavery and help in \r\nother activities supported by the Permanent Memorial \r\nCommittee. As a member of the Committee and initial \r\ncontributor to the Trust Fund for Partnerships — \r\nPermanent Memorial, Brazil is fully committed to efforts \r\nto raise awareness and re-engage international attention \r\non the horrific nature of slavery, the transatlantic slave \r\n A/64/PV.34\r\n \r\n13 09-59092 \r\n \r\ntrade and its legacy of discrimination, while honouring \r\nthe victims.  \r\n In 1910, Brazil lost Joaquim Nabuco, a statesman \r\nand a leading voice of the abolitionist movement in \r\nBrazil. The centennial of Nabuco’s death will remind us \r\nof the struggle for the abolition of slavery in Brazil. \r\nNabuco campaigned against slavery in the House of \r\nRepresentatives and established the Brazilian \r\nAnti-Slavery Society in 1880. As a columnist for the \r\nJournal of Commerce of Rio de Janeiro, Ambassador \r\nNabuco once wrote:  \r\n“Slavery is a word which may have lost all its \r\nmeaning for certain people, but which marks, like a \r\nred-hot iron, a sign of degradation on the foreheads \r\nof others.” \r\n Almost 100 years after his death, his example still \r\ninspires us to redouble our efforts to eliminate racial \r\ndiscrimination. One step in that direction would be the \r\nfull implementation of the Durban Declaration. More \r\nimportantly, we hope that the General Assembly will \r\ncontinue to play a prominent role in advising future \r\ngenerations of the consequences, lessons and legacy of \r\nslavery and the transatlantic slave trade and the dangers \r\nof racism and prejudice. \r\n Mr. Núñez Mosquera (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThe bloody historical chapters written by the \r\ntransatlantic slave trade, which are undeniably part of \r\nour contemporary history, can be neither justified nor \r\nignored. In Cuba, as in almost the entire Latin American \r\ncontinent and the West Indies, we can clearly see the \r\ntraces of the slave trade, the fruit of the colonizing drive \r\nand greed of European traffickers who used slave labour \r\nto build their colonial empires. Five centuries ago, as \r\npart of that cruel trade, approximately 1.3 million \r\nAfrican slaves arrived on our island, most of them from \r\nsub-Saharan Africa.  \r\n We Cubans are proud of our African roots. The \r\nidentity of the Cuban people is the fruit of the \r\ntranscultural forces set in motion by the arrival of the \r\nLucumi, Carabali, Congo, Ganga, Mina, Bibi, Yoruba \r\nand other African ethnic groups in the colonial society of \r\nthat time. We are a mixture of Hispanic and African \r\nroots. The cultural wealth of my country and the \r\nidiosyncrasy of my people are also expressions of the \r\ncultural heritage of African peoples. They enriched us \r\nwith their wisdom, their traditions, their languages, their \r\nreligious beliefs, their music, their temperament and \r\ntheir rebellious spirit. Those slaves who rose up against \r\nexploitation and fled the lash of the overseer to become \r\nfugitives laid the foundation for the freedom-loving \r\nspirit of my people. The courage and daring of those \r\nrunaway slaves nourished Cubans’ deep-rooted sense of \r\nindependence. Africa is an indissociable part of our \r\nexistence. For Cubans, Africa is an extension of our \r\nhomeland. \r\n We are therefore proud to proclaim today that the \r\npeople of Cuba are direct natural heirs of the gallantry, \r\nvalour and culture of resistance of Africa, which fought \r\nheroically for centuries to confront challenges that \r\npersist to this day.  \r\n The slave route was an intrinsic part of the ruthless \r\nexploitation and impoverishment of Africa and the cruel \r\ndiscrimination that its descendants endured too long in \r\nthe Western hemisphere. The former colonial capitals \r\nmust honour their historical debt to those who suffered \r\nunder slavery and the transatlantic slave trade for \r\ncenturies.  \r\n This is all the more true in the midst of the \r\nworldwide crisis we are facing today as a result of an \r\ninternational institutional order built on the \r\nimpoverishment and exclusion of many countries, \r\nincluding those that were victims of slavery. We affirm \r\nthat the former colonial capitals cannot disassociate \r\nthemselves from their past through some sort of self-\r\nimposed historical amnesia now that those who were \r\nrich in years past are even more powerful today and the \r\noverwhelming majority of nations are relegated to \r\nsqualid underdevelopment.  \r\n We recognize the importance of the activities being \r\ncarried out by the Department for Public Information in \r\nconjunction with Member States, particularly members \r\nof the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the \r\nAfrican Union, to plan future commemorative events on \r\nthis subject. We also support the initiative to build a \r\npermanent memorial to the victims of slavery and the \r\ntransatlantic slave trade at United Nations Headquarters. \r\nWe commend the role of UNESCO in distributing \r\neducational material on this topic and the efforts of the \r\nUnited Nations information centres.  \r\n Many are the efforts being carried out by Member \r\nStates to promote the 200th anniversary of the abolition \r\nof the transatlantic slave trade. Unfortunately, a small \r\nnumber of countries decided to unilaterally withdraw \r\nfrom the collective action of the international \r\ncommunity in the fight against racism during the Durban \r\nReview Conference held in Geneva in April 2009. Such \r\nA/64/PV.34  \r\n \r\n09-59092 14 \r\n \r\nbehaviour undermines the efforts of the international \r\ncommunity to develop communities of understanding \r\nand to fight intolerance, objectives that were reiterated \r\nin the Declaration and Programme of Action adopted in \r\nDurban in 2001 and the outcome document adopted at \r\nthe Review Conference.  \r\n Shortly after the triumph of the Cuban revolution \r\nin 1959, Cuba began to pay off — in a modest way — its \r\nenormous debt to those hundreds of thousands of African \r\nslaves who made Cuba their homeland and dedicated \r\ntheir lives to its independence. Over 381,000 Cuban \r\nsoldiers and officers have fought selflessly to defend the \r\nsovereignty and integrity of brotherly African countries \r\nover almost three decades. We returned from Africa with \r\nonly the remains of our fallen comrades and the honour \r\nof having fulfilled our duty. Almost 2,400 Cubans are \r\ncurrently serving in 35 African countries to foster \r\ndevelopment there in areas as diverse as public health, \r\neducation, agriculture, sports, construction and others.  \r\n Cuba will continue to contribute, as it has to date, \r\nits human capital and its experience in cooperation with \r\nmany African countries. Through its comprehensive \r\nhealth programme alone, almost 1,120 Cuban doctors \r\nand medical personnel are working in 23 African \r\ncountries. Their services reach a total of over 48 million \r\nindividuals. There are currently over 2,200 youth from \r\n45 African countries attending our universities and \r\npolytechnic institutes, and to date almost 32,000 young \r\nAfricans have graduated from our universities in various \r\nspecializations.  \r\n We call not for paternalism towards Africa, but for \r\nequality of opportunity. Above all, Africa needs and \r\ndeserves solidarity and respect. For all these reasons, \r\nand as in previous years, Cuba firmly supports and \r\nsponsors the draft resolution (A/64/L.10) on this subject \r\npresented to the Assembly by the CARICOM member \r\nStates. \r\n Mr. Webb (United States of America): The United \r\nStates is proud to be a sponsor of the draft resolution \r\nregarding a permanent memorial to the victims of \r\nslavery and the transatlantic slave trade (A/64/L.10).  \r\n On 19 June 1865, over 140 years ago, Union \r\nsoldiers rode into Galveston, Texas, to carry the news of \r\nthe end of the United States civil war. With their arrival, \r\nword finally reached the frontiers of the United States \r\nthat the war had ended and that the slaves of the \r\nConfederacy were free. The ratification of the thirteenth \r\namendment to the United States Constitution later that \r\nyear guaranteed the end of slavery in the United States. \r\nWe continue to struggle with overcoming the legacy of \r\nslavery as we pursue our efforts to eliminate racial \r\ndiscrimination. \r\n Speaking at the conclusion of his trip to Ghana this \r\nsummer, President Obama reflected on seeing his \r\ndaughters walk through the doors at Cape Coast Castle, a \r\nplace where men, women and children were sold into \r\nslavery, saying: \r\n“It was a remarkable reminder that while the future \r\nis unknowable, the winds always blow in the \r\ndirection of human progress.” \r\n The United States remains committed to this \r\nprogress, to educating our youth about the slave trade \r\nand to honouring both the victims and the efforts of \r\nthose who sought to end this despicable practice. We are \r\nhappy to sponsor this draft resolution. \r\n Mr. Sardinha (India): As the representative of \r\nIndia, I am indeed honoured to address the Assembly on \r\nthe subject of the follow-up to the commemoration of \r\nthe two-hundredth anniversary of the abolition of the \r\ntransatlantic slave trade. \r\n Two years ago, when resolution 62/122 on the \r\ncommemoration of the two-hundredth anniversary of the \r\nabolition of the transatlantic slave trade was adopted by \r\nconsensus by the General Assembly, India was proud to \r\nsponsor it. We are again happy to co-sponsor the follow-\r\nup draft resolution (A/64/L.10) that has been presented \r\nby the Caribbean Community today. In this connection, I \r\nwould also like to welcome the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport on the programme of educational outreach on the \r\ntransatlantic slave trade and slavery (A/64/299). \r\n Slavery is one of the greatest scars on the history \r\nof nations and humanity. For one man to enslave another \r\nis truly a crime of the highest degree. It is therefore \r\nimperative that we commemorate the great struggles and \r\nbattles that have been fought to get rid of this scourge. A \r\nGreek historian noted of ancient India that “it is \r\nremarkable in India that all Indians are free, and no \r\nIndian is a slave”. However, this changed after we were \r\ncolonized and India was forced to endure a form of \r\nindentured servitude for nearly 200 years. The agony of \r\nslavery and the degradation that it leads to are therefore \r\nwell understood by us. \r\n The transatlantic slave trade ravaged African and \r\nCaribbean nations to satisfy the rapacious economic \r\ngreed and exploitation of the colonizers. The effects of \r\n A/64/PV.34\r\n \r\n15 09-59092 \r\n \r\nits violence and of the human suffering it inflicted are \r\nstill visible today. \r\n Lest we forget, it is important that the international \r\ncommunity take at least a first step in the right direction \r\nby paying homage to the victims of slavery and the slave \r\ntrade and by acknowledging the tragedy. We are \r\nhumbled and honoured to be part of the initiative to erect \r\na memorial in honour and memory of the various victims \r\nof slavery and the transatlantic slave trade. The \r\npermanent memorial will be a small commemoration of \r\nthe millions of victims who suffered silently, with no \r\nhope of freedom, before they disappeared into the night. \r\n The memorial will not only serve as a hallmark to \r\nwhich we may pay our respects, but will also be a \r\nreminder for the international community to raise \r\nawareness about the issues surrounding the great evil of \r\nslavery, of which the transatlantic slave trade was one of \r\nthe most abhorrent manifestations. \r\n We welcome the establishment of the Committee \r\nled by the Caribbean and African countries to oversee \r\nthe permanent memorial project. In this context, we feel \r\nthat it would be befitting for UNESCO to undertake the \r\ntask of launching the international design project for the \r\npermanent memorial. \r\n We also recognize the importance of education to \r\ncurrent and future generations about the history, causes \r\nand impact of slavery and the transatlantic slave trade. \r\nWe support the initiatives undertaken by the United \r\nNations and recognize that the appointment of the \r\nGoodwill Ambassador is a step forward in spreading \r\nawareness about this important issue. \r\n We welcome the initiatives undertaken by States in \r\nreaffirming their commitment to implementing \r\nparagraphs 101 and 102 of the Durban Declaration of the \r\nWorld Conference against Racism, Racial \r\nDiscrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, \r\naimed at countering the legacy of slavery and \r\ncontributing to the restoration of the dignity of the \r\nvictims of slavery and the slave trade. \r\n Slavery and the slave trade are symptomatic of the \r\nevils that are still manifested in the form of racism and \r\nxenophobia. Our work at the United Nations will not be \r\ncomplete unless we can abolish all forms of slavery, \r\nincluding its present manifestations. This requires that \r\nwe work together in a spirit of international cooperation \r\nto rid our world of these modern forms of slavery. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on this item.  \r\n At the request of the sponsors, action on draft \r\nresolution A/64/L.10 will be taken at a later stage, to be \r\nannounced. \r\n The Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 116. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 75 (continued) \r\n \r\nReport of the International Criminal Court \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/64/L.9) \r\n \r\n The Acting President: Members will recall that \r\nthe Assembly held the debate on agenda item 75 at its \r\n29th and 31st plenary meetings, held on 29 and \r\n30 October 2009, respectively. \r\n I give the floor to the representative of the \r\nNetherlands to introduce draft resolution A/64/L.9. \r\n Mr. Schaper (Netherlands): I have the honour to \r\nintroduce, under agenda item 75, draft resolution \r\nA/64/L.9, entitled “Report of the International Criminal \r\nCourt”. In addition to the 93 countries listed in \r\ndocument A/64/L.9, which contains the text of the draft \r\nresolution, the following countries have indicated their \r\nwish to be included as sponsors of the resolution: Chad, \r\nthe Dominican Republic, Georgia, Mongolia, San \r\nMarino and Timor-Leste. This brings the total number of \r\nsponsors to 99. \r\n On 29 October, the President of the International \r\nCriminal Court, Judge Sang-Hyun Song, presented the \r\nfifth annual report of the International Criminal Court \r\n(A/64/356) to this body. We had a very constructive and \r\nin-depth debate then, and I would like to highlight a few \r\nelements.  \r\n First of all, the debate once again made clear that \r\nthe establishment of the Court was the most significant \r\ndevelopment of the past decade in our long and ongoing \r\nstruggle to eradicate impunity — a struggle that \r\ncontinues. For success in this struggle, universal \r\nadherence to the Rome Statute of the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC) will be crucial.  \r\n We are therefore very pleased to welcome the \r\ncountries that have recently become parties to the Rome \r\nStatute: Chile and the Czech Republic. It is our sincere \r\nhope that others will join soon. We look forward to \r\nwelcoming many more States as parties to the ICC by \r\nA/64/PV.34  \r\n \r\n09-59092 16 \r\n \r\nthe 2010 Review Conference, which will be held in \r\nKampala.  \r\n Secondly, the International Criminal Court’s \r\nannual report and the debate in the Assembly last week \r\nalso underlined the role of the Court in our common \r\nefforts to build an international community characterized \r\nnot only by the rule of law and respect for human rights, \r\nbut also by peace and security. Sustainable peace cannot \r\nbe achieved if perpetrators of the most serious crimes are \r\nnot brought to justice. Peace and justice are \r\ncomplementary requirements.  \r\n Thirdly, as the President of the International \r\nCriminal Court pointed out, the biggest obstacle to the \r\nconduct of judicial proceeding remains the lack of \r\narrests and surrender of suspects. The cooperation of \r\nStates, international organizations and civil society is \r\nessential to the Court’s functioning, in relation not only \r\nto arrests and surrender, but also to the provision of \r\nevidence, the protection and relocation of victims and \r\nwitnesses, and the enforcement of sentences.  \r\n We are therefore pleased that the United Nations \r\ncontinued to assist the Court over the past year in its \r\nendeavours through implementation of the Relationship \r\nAgreement. We also welcome the assistance provided \r\nthus far by the States parties and the non-States parties, \r\nand call on all States to continue to support the Court’s \r\nefforts in this regard.  \r\n Last but not least, the President of the Court, in his \r\naddress to the General Assembly, stressed the fact that \r\nthe hallmark of the Court is its independent judicial \r\nnature. At the same time, that judicial institution \r\noperates within the political world and it needs States to \r\nnot just cooperate with it, but also to respect, to protect \r\nand to enhance its judicial independence.  \r\n Allow me now to turn to the draft resolution itself, \r\nwhich serves three main objectives. First, it provides \r\npolitical support for the International Criminal Court as \r\nan organization and for its mandate, its aims and the \r\nwork it carries out. Secondly, it underlines the \r\nimportance of the relationship between the Court and the \r\nUnited Nations on the basis of the Relationship \r\nAgreement. As the President of the ICC rightly pointed \r\nout last week, both the United Nations and the ICC have \r\nan equally central role in enhancing the system of \r\ninternational criminal justice. Lastly, the draft resolution \r\nserves to remind States and international and regional \r\norganizations of the need to cooperate with the \r\nInternational Criminal Court in carrying out its tasks.  \r\n The Netherlands hopes that the draft resolution \r\nwill be adopted by consensus and that it will lead to even \r\ngreater support for the Court in the fight against \r\nimpunity and its attempts to hold the perpetrators of \r\nserious crimes accountable for their actions.  \r\n The Acting President: We shall now proceed to \r\nconsider draft resolution A/64/L.9.  \r\n Before giving the floor to speakers in explanation \r\nof position before action is taken on the draft resolution, \r\nmay I remind delegations that explanations of vote or \r\nposition are limited to 10 minutes and should be made \r\nby delegations from their seats? \r\n Ms. McLeod (United States of America): The \r\nUnited States is not in a position at this time to join in \r\nthe adoption of draft resolution A/64/L.10. If a vote had \r\nbeen called on the draft resolution, we would have \r\nabstained. We emphasize, however, that the United \r\nStates remains steadfastly committed to promoting the \r\nrule of law and helping to bring violators of international \r\nhumanitarian law to justice, wherever the violations may \r\noccur, and will continue to play a leadership role in \r\nrighting these wrongs. As we have emphasized, we \r\ncannot ignore the terrible crimes that have occurred in \r\nplaces like Darfur and the massive human suffering that \r\nthe world has witnessed. \r\n Mr. Sanusi (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in \r\nArabic): My country will join the consensus on draft \r\nresolution A/64/L.10, keeping in mind the general \r\ninclination of the majority of the Member States. \r\nHowever, Libya reaffirms its position on the Rome \r\nStatute and its reservations with regard to its content. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in explanation of position before the Assembly \r\ntakes action on the draft resolution.  \r\n The Assembly will now take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/64/L.9. May I take it that the Assembly \r\ndecides to adopt draft resolution A/64/L.9? \r\n  Draft resolution A/64/L.9 was adopted (resolution \r\n64/9). \r\n The Acting President: May I take it that it is the \r\nwish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 75? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The meeting rose at 5.05 p.m. \r\n"
