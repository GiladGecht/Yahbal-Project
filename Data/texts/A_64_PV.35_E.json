(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.25 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 111  \r\n \r\nElections to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs and \r\nother elections \r\n \r\n (a) Election of seven members of the Committee for \r\nProgramme and Coordination \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/64/307) \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): Pursuant to \r\nGeneral Assembly decision 42/450 of 17 December \r\n1987 and upon the nomination by the Economic and \r\nSocial Council, the Assembly elects the members of \r\nthe Committee for Programme and Coordination. \r\n The Assembly has before it document A/64/307, \r\nwhich contains the nominations by the Economic and \r\nSocial Council to fill the vacancies in the Committee \r\nthat will occur as a result of the expiration, on \r\n31 December 2009, of the terms of office of the \r\nComoros, France, Haiti, Israel, the Russian Federation, \r\nthe Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and Zimbabwe.  \r\n Those States are eligible for immediate re-election. \r\n I should like to remind members that, after \r\n1 January 2010, the following States will still be \r\nmembers of the Committee: Argentina, Armenia, \r\nBangladesh, Belarus, Brazil, the Central African \r\nRepublic, China, Cuba, Guinea, India, the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran, Italy, Jamaica, Kazakhstan, Kenya, \r\nthe Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, the Niger, Nigeria, \r\nPakistan, the Republic of Korea, South Africa, Spain, \r\nUkraine and Uruguay. Therefore, those 24 States are \r\nnot eligible in this election. \r\n I should now like to inform members that the \r\nfollowing States have been nominated by the Economic \r\nand Social Council: the Comoros and Namibia for the \r\ntwo vacancies for African States, the Russian \r\nFederation for the one vacancy for Eastern European \r\nStates, Haiti and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela \r\nfor the two vacancies for Latin American and \r\nCaribbean States, and Israel for one of the two \r\nvacancies for Western European and other States. \r\n In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of \r\nprocedure, all elections should be held by secret ballot \r\nand there shall be no nominations. However, I should \r\nlike to recall paragraph 16 of General Assembly \r\ndecision 34/401, whereby the practice of dispensing \r\nwith the secret ballot for elections to subsidiary organs \r\nwhen the number of candidates corresponds to the \r\nnumber of seats to be filled should become standard, \r\nunless a delegation specifically requests a vote on a \r\ngiven election. \r\n In the absence of such a request, may I take it that \r\nthe Assembly decides to proceed to the election on the \r\nbasis of dispensing with the secret ballot? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The number of \r\nStates nominated from among the African States, the \r\nEastern European States, the Latin American and \r\nCaribbean States and the Western European and other \r\nA/64/PV.35  \r\n \r\n09-59137 2 \r\n \r\nStates is equal to or less than the number of seats to be \r\nfilled in each of those groups.  \r\n May I therefore take it that the Assembly wishes \r\nto declare those States nominated by the Economic and \r\nSocial Council from among the African States, the \r\nEastern European States, the Latin American and \r\nCaribbean States and the Western European and other \r\nStates, namely the Comoros, Haiti, Israel, Namibia, the \r\nRussian Federation and the Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela, elected members of the Committee for \r\nProgramme and Coordination for a three-year term of \r\noffice beginning on 1 January 2010? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I congratulate \r\nthe States that have just been elected members of the \r\nCommittee for Programme and Coordination. \r\n Members will recall, as indicated in document \r\nA/64/307, that there remain four vacancies in the Group \r\nof Western European and other States for members \r\nwhose terms of office would begin on the date of \r\nelection. Three terms will expire on 31 December 2011 \r\nand one term on 31 December 2012. The General \r\nAssembly will be in a position to act on those vacancies \r\nupon the nomination by the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil of four Member States from that region. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n I call on the representative of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran on a point of order. \r\n Mr. Seifi Pargou (Islamic Republic of Iran): I \r\nwant to inform the Assembly that the Islamic Republic \r\nof Iran opposes the election of Israel as a member of \r\nthe Committee for Programme and Coordination. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): We have thus \r\nconcluded this stage of our consideration of sub-item \r\n(a) of agenda item 111. \r\n \r\n (c) Election of thirty members of the  \r\nUnited Nations Commission on International \r\nTrade Law \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The General \r\nAssembly will now turn to the election of 30 members \r\nof the United Nations Commission on International \r\nTrade Law. The 30 outgoing members are as follows: \r\nAlgeria, Australia, Austria, Belarus, Colombia, the \r\nCzech Republic, Ecuador, Fiji, Gabon, Guatemala, \r\nIndia, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Israel, Italy, Kenya, \r\nLebanon, Madagascar, Mongolia, Nigeria, Pakistan, \r\nParaguay, Poland, Serbia, Spain, Switzerland, \r\nThailand, Uganda, the United States of America, the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela and Zimbabwe.  \r\n Those Member States are eligible for immediate \r\nre-election. \r\n I should like to remind members that, as of \r\n21 June 2010, the following States will continue to be \r\nrepresented on the Commission: Armenia, Bahrain, \r\nBenin, the Plurinational State of Bolivia, Bulgaria, \r\nCameroon, Canada, Chile, China, Egypt, El Salvador, \r\nFrance, Germany, Greece, Honduras, Japan, Latvia, \r\nMalaysia, Malta, Mexico, Morocco, Namibia, Norway, \r\nthe Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, \r\nSenegal, Singapore, South Africa, Sri Lanka and the \r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. \r\nTherefore, those 30 States are not eligible for election. \r\n The General Assembly will now proceed to the \r\nelection of 30 members to replace those members \r\nwhose term of office will expire on 20 June 2010. In \r\naccordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, the \r\nelection shall be held by secret ballot and there shall be \r\nno nominations. \r\n I should like to recall, however, paragraph 16 of \r\nGeneral Assembly decision 34/401, whereby the \r\npractice of dispensing with the secret ballot for \r\nelections to subsidiary organs when the number of \r\ncandidates corresponds to the number of seats to be \r\nfilled should become standard, unless a delegation \r\nspecifically requests a vote on a given election. \r\n In the absence of such a request, may I take it that \r\nthe Assembly decides to proceed to the election on the \r\nbasis of dispensing with the secret ballot? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): With regard to \r\ncandidatures, I should like to inform members of the \r\nfollowing: for the seven seats from among the African \r\nStates, there are six candidates: Algeria, Gabon, Kenya, \r\nMauritius, Nigeria and Uganda. For the seven seats from \r\namong the Asian States, the Group of Asian States has \r\nendorsed Fiji, India, the Islamic Republic of Iran, \r\nJordan, Pakistan, the Philippines and Thailand. For the \r\nfour seats from among the Eastern European States, the \r\nGroup of Eastern European States has endorsed Belarus, \r\nthe Czech Republic, Poland and Ukraine. For the five \r\nseats from among the Latin American and Caribbean \r\nStates, there are four endorsed candidates, namely, \r\n A/64/PV.35\r\n \r\n3 09-59137 \r\n \r\nArgentina, Brazil, Colombia and the Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela. For the seven seats from among \r\nthe Western European and other States, that Group has \r\nendorsed Australia, Austria, Israel, Italy, Spain, Turkey \r\nand the United States of America. \r\n Since the number of candidates of the five \r\nregional groups is equal to or less than the number of \r\nseats to be filled in each group, may I take it that the \r\nGeneral Assembly wishes to declare those candidates \r\nelected for a six-year term beginning on 21 June 2010? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I congratulate \r\nthe following States, which have been elected members \r\nof the United Nations Commission on International \r\nTrade Law for a six-year term beginning on 21 June \r\n2010: Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belarus, \r\nBrazil, Colombia, the Czech Republic, Fiji, Gabon, \r\nIndia, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Israel, Italy, Jordan, \r\nKenya, Mauritius, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, \r\nPoland, Spain, Thailand, Turkey, Uganda, Ukraine, the \r\nUnited States of America and the Bolivarian Republic \r\nof Venezuela. \r\n With regard to the two remaining vacancies, from \r\nthe Group of African States and the Group of Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean States, the General Assembly \r\nwill hold elections upon notification by interested \r\nMember States from those two regions. \r\n I now give the floor to the representative of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran on a point of order. \r\n Mr. Seifi Pargou (Islamic Republic of Iran): I \r\nwould like to state that the Islamic Republic of Iran is \r\nopposed to the election of Israel as a member of the \r\nUnited Nations Commission on International Trade Law. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The Assembly \r\nhas thus concluded this stage of its consideration of \r\nsub-item (c) of agenda item 111. \r\n \r\n (e) Election of twenty-nine members of the \r\nGoverning Council of the United Nations \r\nEnvironment Programme \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The Assembly \r\nwill first proceed to a by-election to elect one member \r\nof the Governing Council of the United Nations \r\nEnvironment Programme. \r\n In that connection, I would like to draw the \r\nattention of members to document A/64/297, which \r\ncontains a letter dated 12 August 2009 from the \r\nPermanent Representative of Belarus to the United \r\nNations announcing that Belarus would like to \r\nrelinquish its seat on the Governing Council of the \r\nUnited Nations Environment Programme, as of \r\n31 December 2009, for the remaining term, in favour \r\nof Hungary. As a result, a vacancy will occur and a \r\nnew member must be elected to fill the unexpired term \r\nof office of Belarus, commencing on 1 January \r\n2010 and expiring on 31 December 2011. \r\n In accordance with paragraph 1 of resolution 2997 \r\n(XXVII), of 15 December 1972, and taking into account \r\nthat the vacancy will occur from among the Eastern \r\nEuropean States, the new member should be elected \r\nfrom that region. The President has been informed that \r\nthe Group of Eastern European States has endorsed \r\nHungary as the candidate for the one vacancy. \r\n As members are aware, in accordance with rule \r\n92 of the rules of procedure, all elections shall be held \r\nby secret ballot, and there shall be no nominations. \r\nHowever, I should like to recall paragraph 16 of \r\ndecision 34/401, whereby the practice of dispensing \r\nwith the secret ballot for elections to subsidiary organs \r\nwhen the number of candidates corresponds to the \r\nnumber of seats to be filled should become standard, \r\nunless a delegation specifically requests a vote on a \r\ngiven election. In the absence of such a request, may I \r\ntake it that the Assembly decides to proceed to the \r\nelection on that basis? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): May I therefore \r\ntake it that the Assembly wishes to declare Hungary \r\nelected as a member of the Governing Council of the \r\nUnited Nations Environment Programme for a term of \r\noffice beginning on 1 January 2010 and expiring on \r\n31 December 2011? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I congratulate \r\nHungary on its election as a member of the Governing \r\nCouncil of the United Nations Environment \r\nProgramme. \r\n The General Assembly will now turn to the \r\nelection of 29 members of the Governing Council of \r\nthe United Nations Environment Programme. Pursuant \r\nto resolution 2997 (XXVII), of 15 December 1972, and \r\ndecision 43/406, of 24 October 1988, the Assembly \r\nwill proceed to the election of 29 members of the \r\nA/64/PV.35  \r\n \r\n09-59137 4 \r\n \r\nGoverning Council of the United Nations Environment \r\nProgramme, to replace those members whose term of \r\noffice expires on 31 December 2009. \r\n The 29 outgoing members are Algeria, Angola, \r\nAntigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Australia, Austria, \r\nBelgium, Botswana, Burundi, Canada, Chile, China, \r\nthe Czech Republic, the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo, France, Germany, Haiti, Indonesia, Japan, \r\nKenya, Pakistan, the Republic of Korea, Romania, the \r\nRussian Federation, South Africa, Thailand, Uganda, \r\nthe United States of America and Uruguay. Those \r\nStates are eligible for immediate re-election. \r\n I should like to remind members that, after \r\n1 January 2010, the following States will still be \r\nmembers of the Governing Council: the Bahamas, \r\nBangladesh, Benin, Colombia, the Republic of the \r\nCongo, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cuba, Fiji, Finland, \r\nGuinea, Hungary, India, the Islamic Republic of Iran, \r\nIsrael, Italy, Kazakhstan, Mali, Mauritius, Mexico, \r\nMonaco, the Netherlands, Niger, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, \r\nSomalia, Spain, Tunisia and Tuvalu. Those 29 States \r\nare therefore not eligible in this election. \r\n As members are aware, in accordance with rule \r\n92 of the rules of procedure, all elections shall be held \r\nby secret ballot, and there shall be no nominations. \r\nHowever, I should like to recall paragraph 16 of \r\ndecision 34/401, whereby the practice of dispensing \r\nwith the secret ballot for elections to subsidiary organs \r\nwhen the number of candidates corresponds to the \r\nnumber of seats to be filled should become standard, \r\nunless a delegation specifically requests a vote on a \r\ngiven election. In the absence of such a request, may I \r\ntake it that the Assembly decides to proceed to the \r\nelection on that basis? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): Regarding \r\ncandidatures, I have been informed by the Chairmen of \r\nthe regional groups that, for the eight seats from the \r\nAfrican States, the eight endorsed candidates are the \r\nCentral African Republic, Gabon, Kenya, Lesotho, \r\nMauritania, Mozambique, the United Republic of \r\nTanzania and Zambia. For the six seats from the Asian \r\nStates, the six endorsed candidates are China, Indonesia, \r\nJapan, Malaysia, Pakistan and the Republic of Korea. For \r\nthe three seats from the Eastern European States, the three \r\nendorsed candidates are the Czech Republic, Romania \r\nand the Russian Federation. For the five seats from the \r\nLatin American and Caribbean States, the five endorsed \r\ncandidates are Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Brazil, \r\nTrinidad and Tobago and Uruguay. For the seven seats \r\nfrom the Western European and other States, the seven \r\nendorsed candidates are Australia, Belgium, Canada, \r\nFrance, Germany, Switzerland and the United States of \r\nAmerica. \r\n Since the number of candidates endorsed by each \r\nof the five regional groups corresponds to the number \r\nof seats to be filled in each region, may I take it that \r\nthe General Assembly decides to elect these candidates \r\nas members of the Governing Council of the United \r\nNations Environment Programme for a four-year term \r\nof office beginning on 1 January 2010? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The following \r\n29 States have thus been elected members of the \r\nGoverning Council of the United Nations Environment \r\nProgramme for a four-year term of office beginning on 1 \r\nJanuary 2010: Australia, Antigua and Barbuda, \r\nArgentina, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, the Central African \r\nRepublic, China, the Czech Republic, France, Gabon, \r\nGermany, Indonesia, Japan, Kenya, Lesotho, Malaysia, \r\nMauritania, Mozambique, Pakistan, the Republic of \r\nKorea, Romania, the Russian Federation, Switzerland, \r\nTrinidad and Tobago, the United Republic of Tanzania, \r\nthe United States of America, Uruguay and Zambia. \r\n I congratulate the States that have been elected \r\nmembers of the Governing Council of the United \r\nNations Environment Programme.  \r\n May I take it that it is the wish of the General \r\nAssembly to conclude its consideration of sub-item (e) \r\nof agenda item 111? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 112  \r\n \r\nAppointments to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs \r\nand other appointments  \r\n \r\n (f) Appointment of members of the Committee  \r\non Conferences  \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/64/107)  \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): As indicated in \r\ndocument A/64/107, since the terms of office of \r\nBelarus, Germany, Grenada, Honduras, Nigeria, \r\nSenegal and the Syrian Arab Republic will expire on \r\n31 December 2009, it will be necessary for the \r\n A/64/PV.35\r\n \r\n5 09-59137 \r\n \r\nPresident of the General Assembly to appoint, during \r\nthe current session, seven members to fill the resulting \r\nvacancies. Those members will serve for a period of \r\nthree years, beginning on 1 January 2010. \r\n After consultations with the Chairmen of the five \r\nregional groups, I have appointed Côte d’Ivoire, \r\nGermany and the Syrian Arab Republic as members of \r\nthe Committee on Conferences for a period of three \r\nyears, beginning on 1 January 2010. \r\n May I take it that the Assembly takes note of \r\nthese appointments? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): Regarding the \r\nremaining vacant seats from among the African States, \r\nthe Eastern European States and the Latin American \r\nand Caribbean States, I urge those regional groups to \r\nsubmit candidatures as soon as possible. \r\n The Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of sub-item (f) of agenda item 112. \r\n \r\n (g) Appointment of members of the Joint \r\nInspection Unit  \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/64/106)  \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): As indicated in \r\ndocument A/64/106, the General Assembly is required, \r\nduring the sixty-fourth session, to appoint four \r\nmembers to fill the four vacancies on the Joint \r\nInspection Unit that will arise from the expiration of \r\nthe term of office on 31 December 2010 of Mr. Gérard \r\nBiraud of France, Mr. Papa Louis Fall of Senegal, \r\nMr. István Posta of Hungary and Mr. Cihan Terzi of \r\nTurkey. \r\n As also indicated in document A/64/106, in \r\naccordance with article 3, paragraph 1, of the statute of \r\nthe Joint Inspection Unit, the President of the General \r\nAssembly shall consult with Member States to draw up \r\na list of countries, in this case, four countries, which \r\nwould be requested to propose candidates for \r\nappointment to the Joint Inspection Unit. \r\n Also, as indicated in document A/64/106, \r\nparagraph 4, the General Assembly, by its resolution \r\n61/238, decided that, beginning on 1 January 2008, the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly, when drawing up \r\nthe list of countries, in accordance with article 3, \r\nparagraph 1, of the statute of the Unit, will invite \r\nMember States to submit the names of the countries \r\nand their respective candidates simultaneously, on the \r\nunderstanding that the candidates submitted would be \r\nthe candidates that the respective Member States \r\nintended to propose, to the extent possible, for \r\nappointment by the Assembly, in accordance with \r\narticle 3, paragraph 2, of the statute. \r\n After holding the necessary consultations with \r\nthe regional groups, I should like to communicate to \r\nthe Assembly the following information received from \r\nthe Chairmen of the regional groups. For the one \r\nvacancy from the African States, there is one endorsed \r\ncandidate: Senegal. For the one vacancy from among \r\nthe Eastern European States, the Group has endorsed \r\nHungary. For the two vacancies from among the \r\nWestern European and other States, there are three \r\ncandidates: France, Spain and Turkey.  \r\n As the Group of African States and the Group of \r\nEastern European States have each endorsed one \r\ncandidate for one vacancy, namely, Senegal and \r\nHungary, respectively, those two countries will \r\ntherefore be requested to propose a candidate each for \r\nappointment to the Joint Inspection Unit. \r\n Since, from among the Western European and \r\nother States, there are three candidates for two \r\nvacancies, I should like, in accordance with past \r\npractice, to consult with Member States through the \r\nprocedure of holding an advisory vote by secret ballots, \r\nto select two countries from among the Western \r\nEuropean and other States to be requested to propose \r\ncandidates for appointment to the Joint Inspection \r\nUnit. \r\n Although this advisory vote would not be an \r\nelection, we would follow the rules of procedure of the \r\nAssembly governing elections. \r\n If there is no objection, may I take it that the \r\nGeneral Assembly agrees to that procedure? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): In accordance \r\nwith existing practice, the two countries receiving the \r\ngreatest number of votes and not less than a majority of \r\nthe votes of those present and voting shall be the \r\ncountries selected to propose a candidate each for \r\nappointment to the Joint Inspection Unit. \r\n May I also take it that the General Assembly \r\nagrees to that procedure? \r\n It was so decided. \r\nA/64/PV.35  \r\n \r\n09-59137 6 \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): In the case of a \r\ntie vote, there will be a restricted ballot limited to those \r\ncandidates who have obtained an equal number of votes. \r\n May I take it that the Assembly also agrees to that \r\nprocedure? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): May I remind \r\nmembers that the Assembly is not appointing members \r\nto the Joint Inspection Unit at this time. It is only \r\nselecting two countries, which will be requested to \r\npropose a candidate each. Therefore, only the names of \r\ntwo countries, and not the names of individuals, should \r\nappear on the ballot paper.  \r\n I should now like to repeat the names of the three \r\ncountries from among the Western European and other \r\nStates that wished to propose a candidate: France, \r\nSpain and Turkey. I should further like to point out that \r\nfrom the Western European and other States, the \r\nUnited States of America already has a national serving \r\non the Joint Inspection Unit. The name of that State \r\ntherefore should not appear on the ballot paper. \r\n Before we begin the voting process, I should like \r\nto remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the \r\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly, no \r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a \r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting. \r\n We shall now begin the voting process. Members \r\nare requested to remain seated until all ballots have \r\nbeen collected.  \r\n Ballot papers will now be distributed. May I \r\nrequest representatives to write on the ballot papers the \r\nname of the two States for which they wish to vote. \r\nBallot papers containing more than two names will be \r\ndeclared invalid. If a ballot paper contains the name of \r\na Member State that does not belong to the relevant \r\nregion, that ballot paper will be declared invalid. Ballot \r\npapers bearing the name of an individual will not be \r\ncounted at all. \r\n At the invitation of the President, Mr. Toba (Brazil), \r\nMs. Lalama (Ecuador), Mr. Perestrelo Pinto \r\n(Portugal), Ms. Latif (Romania), Mr. Guidiglo \r\n(Togo) and Mr. Al-Shahari (Yemen) acted as tellers. \r\n A vote was taken by secret ballot. \r\n  The meeting was suspended at 11.10 a.m. and \r\nresumed at 11.50 a.m. \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The result of \r\nthe voting is as follows: \r\n Number of ballot papers:   186 \r\nNumber of invalid ballots:   0 \r\nNumber of valid ballots:   186 \r\nAbstentions:     0 \r\nNumber of members present and voting: 186 \r\nRequired majority:    94 \r\nNumber of votes obtained: \r\n Turkey     146 \r\n France     117 \r\n Spain     101 \r\n The following two countries have obtained the \r\nrequired majority and the largest number of votes: \r\nFrance and Turkey. I declare that they are therefore \r\nselected to propose one candidate each for appointment \r\nto the Joint Inspection Unit. \r\n I thank members for their advice, and the tellers \r\nfor their assistance. I should also like to congratulate \r\nTurkey and France on their selection by majority vote. \r\n In accordance with article 3, paragraph 1, of the \r\nstatute of the Joint Inspection Unit, France, Hungary, \r\nSenegal and Turkey will be requested to submit the names \r\nof candidates and the curricula vitae highlighting the \r\ncandidates’ relevant qualifications for the tasks ahead. \r\n I would like to remind members that, in accordance \r\nwith resolution 59/267, of 23 December 2004, candidates \r\nshould have experience in at least one of the following \r\nfields: oversight, audit, inspection, investigation, \r\nvaluation, finance, project evaluation, programme \r\nevaluation, human resources management, management, \r\npublic administration, monitoring and/or programme \r\nperformance, as well as knowledge of the United Nations \r\nsystem and its role in international relations. \r\n After holding the appropriate consultations described \r\nin article 3, paragraph 2, of the statute of the Joint \r\nInspection Unit, including consultations with the President \r\nof the Economic and Social Council and with the \r\nSecretary-General in his capacity as Chairman of the \r\nUnited Nations System Chief Executives Board for \r\nCoordination, I will submit the names of the candidates to \r\nthe Assembly for appointment to the Joint Inspection Unit.  \r\n We have thus concluded this stage of our \r\nconsideration of sub-item (g) of agenda item 112. \r\nThe meeting rose at 11.55 a.m.  \r\n \r\n"
