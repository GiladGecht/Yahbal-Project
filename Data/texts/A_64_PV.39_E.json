(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.  \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 64 (continued) \r\nReport of the Human Rights Council  \r\n \r\n  Report of the Human Rights Council \r\n(A/64/53/Add.1) \r\n \r\n  Note by the President of the General Assembly \r\n(A/64/490) \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/64/L.11) \r\n \r\n Mr. Momen (Bangladesh): For more than six \r\ndecades we have been debating about the peace process \r\nin the Middle East. Despite our continuous efforts, we \r\nare still far from a lasting peace in the region. \r\n The Bangladesh delegation aligns itself with the \r\nstatements made by the representative of Egypt on \r\nbehalf of the Non-Aligned Movement and by the \r\nrepresentative of the Syrian Arab Republic on behalf of \r\nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference. We would, \r\nhowever, like to highlight some points of interest to us. \r\n In that connection, my delegation thanks the \r\nUnited Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza \r\nConflict for its investigation into documented \r\nallegations of criminal activities and for presenting a \r\ncomprehensive and objective report (A/HRC/12/48) \r\naddressing all alleged violations. Our conscience is \r\nshaken by the serious violations of international human \r\nrights and humanitarian law committed by Israel, as \r\nreported in the context of its military operations in \r\nGaza from 27 December 2008 to 18 January 2009. \r\n We believe that the findings and conclusions set \r\nout in Judge Goldstone’s report will help create an \r\nopportunity to put an end to impunity for violations of \r\ninternational law in Israel and in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territory and thus to eventually address the \r\ndispossession experienced by the people of Gaza. My \r\ndelegation endorses the findings and recommendations \r\nof the Goldstone report and expresses its appreciation \r\nfor their objectivity and fairness. \r\n The Goldstone report clearly confirms that Israel, \r\nwhose people themselves had suffered oppression in \r\nEurope, committed serious human rights violations and \r\nviolations of humanitarian law amounting to war \r\ncrimes and crimes against humanity, while using \r\ndisproportionate force and deliberately targeting \r\ncivilian buildings and installations, causing \r\nunspeakable losses in terms of property and the lives of \r\ncivilians, many of them women and children. \r\nAccording to the Goldstone report, all inhabitants of \r\nGaza were targeted, without distinction between \r\nmilitary personnel and civilians. The scale of the \r\ncrimes described in the report should be a wake-up call \r\nfor the international community. If its findings were to \r\nbe disregarded, the promotion of human rights would \r\ntake a step backwards and criticism of others for \r\nhuman rights violations would be a mockery. \r\n The report of the United Nations Fact-Finding \r\nMission on the Gaza Conflict, headed by Judge Richard \r\nGoldstone, made a number of recommendations aimed \r\nat ensuring accountability for perpetrators and redress \r\nfor victims. It called on the Government of Israel to \r\nresolve to conduct independent and credible \r\nA/64/PV.39  \r\n \r\n09-59485 2 \r\n \r\ninvestigations into the many allegations of serious \r\nviolations of international humanitarian and human \r\nrights law that had taken place during the Gaza conflict \r\nat the beginning of the year. The report also called on \r\nHamas to initiate genuine and effective inquiries into \r\nand proceedings to deal with the many allegations of \r\nviolations. In addition, the report called for the cases to \r\nbe referred to the International Criminal Court in The \r\nHague if Israel and Hamas do not investigate the war \r\ncrimes allegations against them within six months.  \r\n We urge Israel and Hamas to conduct full, neutral \r\nand credible investigations into the allegations \r\ncontained in the report. We call upon the General \r\nAssembly to discharge its Charter-mandated \r\nresponsibilities with respect to the issue. We also look \r\nforward to the results of the consideration of the report \r\nby the Human Rights Council. \r\n Serious follow-up to the report at all levels is \r\nimperative in order to bring an end to this immoral and \r\nrepugnant impunity and to prevent the recurrence of \r\nsuch crimes against the Palestinians. Israel should \r\nallow access to humanitarian goods and freeze \r\nsettlements. We express our deep concern over the \r\nprecarious humanitarian situation, and we urge Israel \r\nto lift its embargo against the Palestinians and \r\nimmediately open all border crossings to allow for the \r\nfree movement of goods, persons and humanitarian aid. \r\nHumanitarian access to Gaza must be allowed in order \r\nto avoid a humanitarian disaster. An international \r\nmonitoring mechanism must be established to ensure a \r\nceasefire. \r\n We urge Israel to immediately end settlement \r\nactivities, including so-called natural growth. If we are \r\nto achieve a lasting settlement, it is very important to \r\naddress the root cause, which is the Israeli occupation \r\nof the Arab territories. The solution, therefore, requires \r\nIsrael’s complete withdrawal from the occupied \r\nPalestinian territories, including East Jerusalem, and \r\nall other occupied Arab lands. We reiterate that the \r\ncreation of a Palestinian State, coexisting peacefully \r\nalongside Israel on the basis of the 1967 borders, with \r\nEast Jerusalem as its capital, is the only sustainable \r\nsolution to the conflict. The Road Map, the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative and relevant resolutions are the best \r\nparameters for achieving a two-State solution. Thus, \r\nIsraelis and Palestinians could live in peace and \r\nharmony. I am hopeful that that dream will come true. \r\n We would like to restate that it is only through \r\nnegotiations that a fair and lasting peace can be \r\nestablished in the Middle East. Intensive and sincere \r\nwork is needed to ensure a resumption of negotiations.  \r\n Let me conclude by echoing the words of Judge \r\nGoldstone:  \r\n  “Now is the time for action. A culture of \r\nimpunity in the region has existed for too long. \r\nThe lack of accountability for war crimes and \r\npossible crimes against humanity has reached a \r\ncrisis point; the ongoing lack of justice is \r\nundermining any hope for a successful peace \r\nprocess and reinforcing an environment that \r\nfosters violence. Time and again, experience has \r\ntaught us that overlooking justice only leads to \r\nincreased conflict and violence.” \r\n Mr. Al Nafisee (Saudi Arabia) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nOn behalf of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, \r\nMr. President, I have the honour to thank you for your \r\nefforts in convening this urgent meeting to discuss the \r\nGoldstone report (A/HRC/12/48), prepared for the \r\nHuman Rights Council by the United Nations Fact-\r\nFinding Mission on the Gaza Conflict, which \r\ninvestigated violations perpetrated during the Israeli \r\nwar against Gaza last December and the human rights \r\nsituation in Palestine and the occupied Arab territories. \r\n My country associates itself with the statements \r\nmade, respectively, by the representative of the Arab \r\nRepublic of Egypt on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement, the representative of the Syrian Arab \r\nRepublic on behalf of the Arab Group, and the \r\nrepresentative of the Republic of Sudan on behalf of \r\nthe Group of 77 and China. \r\n In the view of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the \r\nGoldstone report is clear and transparent and demands \r\nappropriate action by the General Assembly, in view of \r\nits condemnation of Israel for war crimes committed \r\nduring its recent aggression in Gaza. The Assembly is \r\nnow in the process of discussing the report and will \r\nsoon be voting on endorsing it. \r\n The investigation conducted in Gaza by Judge \r\nGoldstone and his international team shows that Israel \r\ncommitted war crimes and crimes against humanity in \r\na war that caused the death of more than 1,400 \r\nPalestinians, most of them civilian women and \r\nchildren, and the wounding of thousands more. \r\nFurthermore, Israel committed deliberate acts of \r\n A/64/PV.39\r\n \r\n3 09-59485 \r\n \r\naggression against United Nations facilities in Gaza \r\nand used bombs and rockets that increased the toll of \r\ndeath or injury of unarmed Palestinians who had \r\nsought shelter there. \r\n On 12 January the Human Rights Council \r\nadopted its resolution S-9/1, condemning Israel for its \r\nattacks on Gaza and its serious violations of human \r\nrights, and requesting that a fact-finding mission be \r\nestablished to investigate violations against unarmed \r\ncivilians in the area. We support the Mission’s findings \r\nin Gaza and the occupied territories, and its \r\ncondemnation of the violations of human rights and \r\ninternational humanitarian law. \r\n Judge Goldstone described fairly and objectively \r\nthe scale of destruction committed by Israel in a war in \r\nwhich it used weapons of every kind. He met with \r\ninjured and displaced Palestinians, was shown pictures \r\nof the burned bodies of dead women, children and old \r\npeople and saw for himself how Israel had deliberately \r\ntargeted them. At a press conference Judge Goldstone \r\nsaid,  \r\n  “The aim of holding these public hearings \r\n… was to show the human side of the suffering; \r\nto give a voice to the victims so they are not lost \r\namong statistics. No written words can by \r\nthemselves convey human stories the way people \r\ncan do it in their own voice and words”.  \r\nHe has also said that the Mission wanted to show the \r\neffect of violence on communities, especially the \r\npsychological effects on children.  \r\n We endorse Judge Goldstone’s words when he \r\npresented the report to the Human Rights Council:  \r\n  “A culture of impunity in the region has \r\nexisted for too long … the ongoing lack of justice \r\nis undermining any hope for a successful peace \r\nprocess and reinforcing an environment that \r\nfosters violence.”  \r\n We reiterate that the Goldstone report aims to \r\nstrengthen a culture of accountability and to draw \r\nattention to disturbing violations of international \r\nprinciples of human rights and international \r\nhumanitarian law. With the publication of the report, a \r\ngrowing culture of accountability is becoming more \r\napparent. \r\n The international community must shoulder its \r\nresponsibility and take action to achieve justice, for no \r\ncountry or military organization should be above the \r\nlaw. A failure to achieve justice in the face of the \r\nserious violations committed in the war on Gaza would \r\nhave disastrous consequences for international justice. \r\n The Arab world, including the State of Palestine, \r\nhas made every possible effort to achieve a genuine \r\nand lasting peace. The Arab Peace Initiative is still on \r\nthe table; it offers a comprehensive route to ending the \r\nArab-Israeli conflict and reaching an agreement on \r\nreciprocal recognition, normal relations and peaceful \r\ncoexistence for all States in the region. It is completely \r\nin line with the peace process and embodies the \r\ncommitment of the Arab side to peace as a strategic \r\noption, in accordance with the Charter of the United \r\nNations. \r\n If everyone recognizes such a solution, they \r\nshould also recognize why peace has still not been \r\nachieved. That is because of Israel’s perpetration of \r\nmassacres, arbitrary bombardments and attacks against \r\nthe Palestinians in the occupied territories. Israel has \r\ndeliberately prevaricated and procrastinated in order to \r\navoid any commitment to peace. Peace cannot be \r\nachieved by imposing punishment and preconditions \r\non a people whose country has been occupied and \r\nwhose rights have been violated in contravention of all \r\nthe principles and norms of international law. No \r\nconditions should be imposed before a peace \r\nsettlement is reached. The aggressor cannot be \r\nrewarded before negotiations even begin. All the \r\ninternational initiatives and efforts in this context have \r\nconsistently faced a blank refusal from the Israeli side, \r\nembodied in its unilateral measures. This is contrary to \r\ninternational law and Security Council resolutions. \r\n Instead of seeking genuine peace, Israel continues \r\nits daily humiliation of the Palestinian people and its \r\nbuilding of settlements, the separation wall and bypass \r\nroads. These are all actions that violate international \r\nlaw and attempt to change reality on the ground, to \r\nchange the geographic and demographic makeup of \r\nPalestinian land, especially in Jerusalem and its \r\nenvirons, in grave violation of international law and \r\nthe relevant Security Council resolutions. Settlements \r\nencircle most Palestinian cities in the West Bank, and \r\nalso use more than half of its water resources. \r\n Saudi Arabia is deeply concerned about the \r\nongoing Israeli blockade of Gaza, resulting in the \r\ncontinued deterioration of Palestinian living conditions \r\nin the face of restricted access to services, goods, food, \r\nA/64/PV.39  \r\n \r\n09-59485 4 \r\n \r\nfuel and building materials. In addition, Israel has \r\nblockaded East Jerusalem and prevented people from \r\ngetting to their homes and houses of worship. Israeli \r\nacts against Islamic sites represent daily aggression \r\nagainst unarmed Palestinians, provoking distress \r\namong Muslims all over the world. Israel’s grave \r\nassaults on the Al-Aqsa mosque can only have a direct \r\nand serious impact on international peace and security.  \r\n In this regard, my Government calls upon the \r\ninternational community, through the General \r\nAssembly, to take a stand against this wanton \r\naggression, act together and vote to adopt the draft \r\nresolution (A/64/L.11) concerning the Goldstone report \r\nin order to prevent any future repetition of these \r\ncrimes. \r\n Mr. Pálsson (Iceland): The comprehensive report \r\nof the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the \r\nGaza Conflict (A/HRC/12/48) has concluded that there \r\nis evidence indicating serious violations of \r\ninternational human rights and humanitarian law, \r\ncommitted both by Israel during Operation Cast Lead \r\nand in the West Bank, as well as by Palestinian armed \r\ngroups and their repeated launching of rockets into \r\nsouthern Israel. The report deserves serious \r\nconsideration and follow-up. The conclusions drawn \r\nrequire concrete action, including the establishment of \r\na credible system of investigation into the alleged \r\nviolations. We reiterate our shared principle that every \r\nMember State must commit itself to full cooperation \r\nwith the United Nations.  \r\n My delegation fully recognizes Israel’s legitimate \r\nsecurity concerns, including concerns over weapons \r\nsmuggling and the unacceptable firing of rockets from \r\nGaza, which destroy and endanger the lives of innocent \r\ncivilians. At the same time, we take the view that such \r\nviolations do not justify the disproportionate use of \r\nforce or the breaching of international humanitarian \r\nand human rights law. The conflict continues to \r\nthreaten stability far beyond the region and the \r\nsituation in the occupied Palestinian territory remains \r\nof grave concern. The people of Gaza continue to be \r\nbesieged through limited freedom of movement, import \r\nand export restrictions and the worsening economic \r\nsituation. The situation remains unacceptable by \r\ninternational standards. \r\n Meanwhile, the closure regime is still operating \r\nin the West Bank. Here also the situation, including \r\nviolence and evictions in East Jerusalem, gives cause \r\nfor deep concern. Settlement activities must be ended. \r\nThe prolonged climate of impunity has created a crisis \r\nof justice in the occupied Palestinian territory that \r\nneeds to be addressed. In that regard, the system of \r\ninvestigation recommended by the report of the Fact-\r\nFinding Mission would be a welcome step in the right \r\ndirection. \r\n In line with the report, my delegation urges both \r\nthe Israeli and the Palestinian parties to launch \r\nindependent investigations, in conformity with \r\ninternational standards, into the allegations of serious \r\nviolations of international human rights and \r\nhumanitarian law. We also support the requests to the \r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights to report to the \r\nnext session of the Human Rights Council on the \r\nsituation in the occupied Territory and to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to report to the Assembly on further \r\ndevelopments. \r\n Mr. Heller (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): We \r\nwelcome the convening of this meeting on the report of \r\nthe Human Rights Council pertaining to the United \r\nNations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict \r\n(A/64/53/Add.1). The information contained in that \r\nreport deserves the General Assembly’s full attention \r\ngiven not only the seriousness and the implications of \r\nthe conflict in Gaza, but also on the grounds that \r\nrespect for international law and international \r\nhumanitarian law should be upheld at all times and \r\nunder any circumstance. \r\n The report of the Fact-Finding Mission \r\n(A/HRC/12/48), headed by Judge Richard Goldstone, \r\nis a document that cannot be disregarded and whose \r\nrecommendations should be responsibly and seriously \r\nconsidered by all parties, since impartial and credible \r\ninvestigations in conformity with international \r\nstandards were carried out with regard to the \r\naccusations of serious violations of international \r\nhumanitarian law and human rights committed during \r\nthe conflict in Gaza. Its greatest merit is that it seeks a \r\nbalanced approach, taking into account the actions of \r\nall parties involved. \r\n The civilian populations affected by that conflict, \r\nboth Palestinians and Israelis, deserve to know that \r\nthose kinds of acts will not go unpunished and that \r\ntheir rights will be respected under any circumstance, \r\nin accordance with international humanitarian law. \r\nThat guarantees them a better future. \r\n A/64/PV.39\r\n \r\n5 09-59485 \r\n \r\n Justice should always go hand in hand with the \r\npursuit of peace. Furthermore, justice, accountability \r\nand the fight against impunity are essential elements in \r\nany settlement of conflict, since they facilitate the end \r\nof hostilities and, at the same time, lay the foundations \r\nfor stability and reconciliation.  \r\n The main conclusion of the report of the Fact-\r\nFinding Mission is that both the Government of Israel \r\nand the Palestinian factions should establish \r\ninvestigation mechanisms that will make it possible to \r\nobtain a better understanding of the alleged serious \r\nviolations of international law and international \r\nhumanitarian law committed during that conflict. We \r\nare not going to debate the composition of the Fact-\r\nFinding Mission. Rather, we wish to focus on the fact \r\nthat those acts should be investigated and, if need be, \r\nduly punished.  \r\n The Government of Israel, like any democratic \r\nState, has the resources and the institutional and legal \r\nmeans to act in conformity with its international \r\nobligations. Mexico recognizes the right of legitimate \r\nself-defence of Member States of the United Nations, \r\nin accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations \r\nCharter. However, that right does not in any \r\ncircumstance exempt the parties to a conflict from \r\nfulfilling their obligations under international \r\nhumanitarian law. Israel has the right and the \r\nobligation to protect its population. However, it also \r\nhas the obligation to comply with international \r\nhumanitarian law. \r\n With respect to the Palestinian side, taking into \r\naccount the responsibility of the factions involved in \r\nthat conflict as non-State entities, we believe that \r\ninnovative mechanisms should be put in place that \r\nprovide an institutional approach ensuring credibility \r\nand trust in accountability and in establishing \r\nresponsibilities, with the active contribution of the \r\ninternational community. \r\n In any case, the investigations of both sides \r\nshould begin as soon as possible and should have a set \r\ndeadline for submitting their results in order to bring \r\nabout the necessary trust to overcome that tragic \r\nchapter of the conflict in the Middle East. Mexico \r\nbelieves that the international community should \r\nensure that that process takes place in the best possible \r\nconditions and, for that, considerable effort and \r\ncommitment on the part of the sides involved is \r\nneeded. \r\n Consideration of the Mission’s report reminds us \r\nthat Middle East peace talks must not be postponed yet \r\nagain, nor should they be subject to preconditions. The \r\ngoal, as everyone knows, is clear: to achieve a \r\ncomprehensive and definitive solution to the Middle \r\nEast conflict that reasserts the recognition of Israel’s \r\nright to exist and allows the establishment of an \r\neconomically and politically viable Palestinian State, \r\nliving side by side in peace with Israel, within secure, \r\ninternationally recognized borders, in compliance with \r\nthe relevant Security Council resolutions, the Road \r\nMap, the Madrid Principles and the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative.  \r\n Today we have an opportunity to serve both \r\npeace and international justice. Let us not let this \r\nunique opportunity pass.  \r\n Mr. Ould Hadrami (Mauritania) (spoke in \r\nArabic): Mr. President, I would like at the outset to \r\nthank you for organizing this important meeting so \r\nquickly at the request of the Group of Arab States to \r\nstudy the war of 27 December 2008 to 18 January 2009 \r\nand the report on that war. The report of the United \r\nNations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict \r\n(A/HRC/12/48) that was prepared pursuant to Human \r\nRights Council resolution S-12/1 is our topic today. \r\nThat report consists of more than 450 pages and it \r\nlooks at the impact of the catastrophic Israeli war on \r\nthe Gaza Strip that took place over a three-week \r\nperiod.  \r\n The international community must organize a \r\ncomprehensive inquiry into the suffering of the \r\nPalestinian people over the past 60 years. The report \r\nhas shown some conclusive facts and findings that \r\nhave demonstrated the terrible nature of the Israeli \r\ncrimes. More than 1,400 people died in a three-week \r\nperiod. The initial act of aggression took place at 11.30 \r\nin the morning. That shows that it was a deliberate \r\nattack, as it targeted children who were going to \r\nschool — because children have to go to school — and \r\ncame at a time when the streets are crowded with \r\npeople. The Israeli army killed Palestinians, not \r\ndistinguishing between civilians and combatants. There \r\nis proof that shows that United Nations facilities were \r\nalso the victims of that aggression. The report shows \r\nthe terrible impact of the unfair blockade of the Gaza \r\nStrip that is still in place today and that has a direct \r\nimpact on the vulnerable segments of society, be they \r\nelderly people, women or children. The report also \r\nshows that at the end of this past June — that is, six \r\nA/64/PV.39  \r\n \r\n09-59485 6 \r\n \r\nmonths after the end of the war — the catastrophic \r\nconsequences were still clearly in evidence. We could \r\nsee the destruction of buildings, industries, wells, \r\nschools, hospitals, police stations and the only flour \r\nmill in Gaza. International assistance and construction \r\nmaterials are not reaching civilians, because of the \r\nclosure of crossing points. That is extremely important \r\nbecause winter is coming and the suffering will only \r\ncontinue.  \r\n Since the United Nations was founded, \r\nresolutions and legislation have been adopted to \r\npromote international law and international \r\nhumanitarian law. Unfortunately we are facing various \r\nsorts of difficulties in implementing those resolutions, \r\nwhich requires more political resolve. The last Israeli \r\nwar against Gaza, which also caused a great deal of \r\nkilling and destruction, proved the existence of a \r\nclimate of legal impunity and the lack of legal \r\nresponsibility. The suffering of the Palestinian people \r\nis as old as the United Nations itself — 60 years. The \r\nPalestinian people are still suffering from injustice, \r\nunfair treatment and displacement. We call on the \r\ninternational community to put an end to their \r\nsuffering and tragedy. \r\n The State of Israel, which is the occupying \r\nPower, must accept the Arab Peace Initiative, which is \r\nbased on the principles of land for peace and an \r\nindependent, sovereign and secure Palestinian State, \r\nwith East Jerusalem as its capital, peacefully coexisting \r\nwith the Israeli State. The State of Israel must \r\nwithdraw from all occupied Arab land, including the \r\nGolan Heights and the Lebanese Shab’a farms. The \r\nGoldstone report is extremely comprehensive and \r\nobjective and gives new hope for implementing its \r\nrecommendations. We call on all relevant United \r\nNations bodies, in particular the Security Council, to \r\ntake the measures necessary to implement those \r\nrecommendations and enforce justice in order to \r\npromote accountability and to punish the perpetrators \r\nof the crimes.  \r\n Finally, my delegation supports draft resolution \r\nA/64/L.11 and calls on the General Assembly to adopt \r\nit. It will promote peace, strengthen the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the United Nations and promote \r\ninternational justice. Such crimes and their origins \r\nmust not be repeated in the future. Furthermore, those \r\ncrimes are not subject to any statute of limitations. \r\n Mr. Ali (Malaysia): My delegation wishes to \r\nalign itself with the statements delivered by the \r\nrepresentatives of Egypt and Syria on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement and the Organization of the \r\nIslamic Conference, respectively. We would like to \r\nthank the Human Rights Council and the United \r\nNations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict for \r\ntheir reports (A/64/53/Add.1 and A/HRC/12/48). \r\n The report of the United Nations Fact-Finding \r\nMission on the Gaza Conflict, also known as the \r\nGoldstone report, has clearly shown the brutality of \r\nIsraeli actions in the execution of Operation Cast Lead, \r\nunleashed in Gaza for more than three weeks, from \r\n27 December 2008 until 18 January 2009. Therefore, \r\nwhile the purpose of our meeting is ostensibly to \r\ndiscuss and take action on the two reports before us, its \r\nreal purpose is much greater. It is to ensure that Israel \r\ncan no longer shed Palestinian blood with impunity. \r\n I say this because the Goldstone report makes for \r\ngrim reading. The report, which speaks for itself, \r\nhighlights Israel’s record of unbridled barbarity \r\ntowards the people in Gaza. Due to the paucity of time, \r\nI would like to point out just some of its most salient \r\npoints. First, the military operation in question is not \r\nan aberration. Rather, it fits into a continuum of \r\npolicies, based on or resulting in violations of \r\ninternational human rights and humanitarian law. \r\n Secondly, Operation Cast Lead was qualitatively \r\ndifferent from any previous military action by Israel in \r\nthe occupied Palestinian territory by dint of its \r\nunprecedented severity and its long-lasting \r\nconsequences. The visible destruction of houses, \r\nfactories, wells, schools, hospitals, police stations and \r\nother public buildings proves that it was the deliberate \r\naim of Israel to inflict as much damage and suffering \r\nas possible.  \r\n Thirdly, Israeli military actions, premised on a \r\ndeliberate policy of disproportionate force, were aimed \r\nnot at a specific enemy, but at the supporting \r\ninfrastructure. In practice, that meant the civilian \r\npopulation in Gaza.  \r\n Fourthly, this operation, which led to killings and \r\ndestruction, was carefully planned and executed. That \r\nalso indicated that all aspects of the operation were \r\ndeliberate. Therefore, all killings must have been \r\nconducted in cold blood. \r\n A/64/PV.39\r\n \r\n7 09-59485 \r\n \r\n However, despite the gruesome situation, we \r\nwere struck by the courage of the Palestinian people. \r\nThe assiduous work of Palestinian non-governmental \r\nand civil society organizations in providing support to \r\nthe population in such extreme circumstances, and in \r\ngiving voice to the suffering and expectations of \r\nvictims of violations, deserves to be fully \r\nacknowledged. \r\n We note with interest that there were also \r\ndissenting voices in Israel against the operation, \r\nexpressed through demonstrations and protests, as well \r\nas public reporting on Israel’s conduct. Those voices \r\nunderstood that Israel could not purchase peace and \r\nsecurity for itself with the blood and suffering of the \r\nPalestinian people. \r\n We, the international community, have thus far \r\nfailed to act to ensure the protection of the civilian \r\npopulation in the Gaza Strip and the occupied \r\nPalestinian territory. Hence, we must break this inertia \r\nby undertaking concrete actions in order to ensure that \r\njustice for the people of Palestine is neither delayed \r\nnor denied. \r\n The Goldstone report provides us with two \r\noptions: either take action to achieve justice for the \r\nPalestinians or allow the abhorrent, illegal actions of \r\nIsrael to remain unpunished. In that regard, as a \r\nresponsible member of the international community, \r\nwe choose the former. Accordingly, we urge all \r\nMember States to work together in implementing all \r\nthe recommendations stipulated in the report of the \r\nUnited Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza \r\nConflict. \r\n Mr. Sial (Pakistan): My delegation would like to \r\nthank you, Mr. President, for convening today’s \r\nmeeting to consider the report of the United Nations \r\nFact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict, also known \r\nas the Goldstone report (A/HRC/12/48). \r\n Early this year, the international community was \r\nhorrified by the events surrounding three weeks of \r\nIsraeli aggression in the occupied Gaza Strip. The \r\nreport of the Human Rights Council on its twelfth \r\nspecial session (A/64/53/Add.1) and periodic reports of \r\nthe High Commissioner for Human Rights \r\ncorroborated other independent reports on those events. \r\nThe Goldstone report only authenticated those reports \r\nwith evidence. \r\n The Human Rights Council, after detailed \r\ndiscussions at its twelfth special session, referred the \r\nGoldstone report to the General Assembly. The Council \r\nalso requested the Secretary-General to submit at its \r\nthirteenth session a report on the status of the \r\nimplementation of the Goldstone recommendations. I \r\nbelieve that, against that backdrop, the present session \r\nof the General Assembly has three-faceted \r\nsignificance.  \r\n First, the General Assembly must actively and \r\nconstructively consider the Goldstone report, in terms \r\nof implications and future follow-up action. It is our \r\nhope that the Assembly will discharge that \r\nresponsibility in an efficient and just manner. \r\n Secondly, pursuant to the request of the Human \r\nRights Council, the Secretary-General has been asked \r\nto submit a report on the status of the implementation \r\nof the Goldstone recommendations to the Council. We \r\nmay rightfully expect him to keep the General \r\nAssembly informed on the subject. Therefore, the \r\nAssembly’s present session can give him requisite \r\ninputs and guidelines for the preparation of his report. \r\n Thirdly, the General Assembly, through this \r\nsession, has an opportunity to position itself behind the \r\ngrowing concern of the international community at the \r\nstalled peace process in the Middle East. In the absence \r\nof a meaningful and durable peace process, violence \r\nwill continue and respect for human rights will remain \r\na distant dream. We sincerely believe that our \r\nmeaningful deliberations on the issue will help to \r\nrevive the peace process. \r\n From the discussions in the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, it is evident that many Member States have \r\ngreatly appreciated the Goldstone report for being \r\nobjective, impartial and comprehensive. We see the \r\ndeliberations on the report as an opportunity for the \r\ninternational community to address the suffering of the \r\nPalestinian people and for Israel to rectify its past \r\nactions and policies. \r\n Achieving lasting peace in the Middle East is a \r\nlong-held common objective of the international \r\ncommunity. This meeting should bring us closer to that \r\nobjective. Thus, the overarching message of the need \r\nfor a revival of the peace process with firm \r\ncommitment to a two-State solution must resonate from \r\nour deliberations. \r\nA/64/PV.39  \r\n \r\n09-59485 8 \r\n \r\n During last month’s debate in the Security \r\nCouncil, Pakistan outlined four parameters for \r\ninternational engagement with a view to achieving a \r\nsustained peace process in the Middle East. We called \r\nupon the Security Council and the Middle East Quartet \r\nto utilize their full potential in support of the peace \r\nprocess through transparent and objective engagement. \r\nThey must prevail upon Israel to cease all settlement \r\nactivity and illegal excavation in East Jerusalem, as the \r\ntwo actions have so far proved the largest stumbling \r\nblocks on the road to peace. We will reiterate that \r\nmessage. There is also a pressing need to address the \r\nplight and suffering of the Palestinian population and \r\nto rebuild Palestinian institutions battered by conflict \r\nand violence.  \r\n The foregoing measures must be supplemented by \r\naddressing the root cause of all trouble — that is, by \r\nending the Israeli occupation of Arab territories. Such a \r\nframework for peace is not new. It has already been \r\ndetermined in the relevant resolutions of the Security \r\nCouncil, as well as in the Madrid terms of reference, \r\nthe Road Map, the Arab Peace Initiative and the \r\nunderstanding reached in Annapolis in 2007. \r\n I wish to conclude by expressing Pakistan’s \r\nsincere hope that the Goldstone report will ultimately \r\nstrengthen the initiative for peace in the region and that \r\nthe General Assembly will be able to utilize that \r\nimportant document to find a meaningful basis for \r\nlasting peace and security in the Middle East. \r\n Mr. Mohamed (Maldives): The Maldives would \r\nlike to welcome the report of the United Nations Fact-\r\nFinding Mission on the Gaza Conflict (A/HRC/12/48), \r\nheaded by Judge Richard Goldstone, that was \r\npresented to the Assembly today. It is regrettable that \r\nthe Government of Israel, as the occupying Power, \r\ndecided not to cooperate with the Fact-Finding Mission \r\nin its compilation of the report. \r\n As a firm believer in the principles enshrined in \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations, the Maldives is \r\ndisheartened by the continued suffering of the people \r\nof Palestine, who have been denied their very basic \r\nright to self-determination and the right to live in peace \r\nand freedom in their own State, their own homeland. \r\nThe Maldives also supports the inalienable right of the \r\npeople of Israel to live in peace and security alongside \r\na sovereign and independent State of Palestine. \r\n The protection of civilians, especially women and \r\nchildren, is one of the most sacred obligations resting \r\nupon the parties to a conflict under international law. \r\nThus, the onus rests with us, as responsible members of \r\nthe international community, to ensure that we uphold \r\nthe legal standards and norms that we have prescribed \r\nfor ourselves. For any hope of peace and stability in \r\nthe Middle East, it is crucial that accountability be \r\nestablished for the clear and manifest violations of \r\nhuman rights and humanitarian law that have been \r\nhighlighted in the report. Justice must be pursued \r\nindependently for the violations by both sides to the \r\nconflict. It is also essential that such investigations and \r\nsubsequent prosecutions be monitored by the Security \r\nCouncil. \r\n The Maldives strongly believes that a negotiated \r\noutcome based on the relevant Security Council \r\nresolutions is the only way to ensure long-term peace, \r\nsecurity and stability in the region. To this end, we \r\nsupport the current efforts by the United States to \r\nrevive the peace talks between the two parties. The \r\nMaldives therefore calls for a final, just and \r\ncomprehensive settlement with the realization of two \r\nStates, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace \r\nand within secure and recognized borders. \r\n Mr. Valero Briceño (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): The Government of \r\nIsrael must be brought to justice for crimes committed \r\nagainst the Palestinian people. Those responsible for \r\nthat operation of terror and death, known as Cast Lead, \r\nand for the criminal blockade against the people of \r\nGaza, must not go unpunished. How many more \r\ngenocides will be necessary before the United Nations \r\ndecides to act? How long will the occupying Power \r\ncontinue to flout the resolutions adopted by this forum? \r\n We have heard the answers from the \r\nrepresentative of Israel. In her speech, she lashed out \r\nagainst the findings and recommendations of the \r\nGoldstone report, claiming that it was “conceived in \r\nhate and executed in sin” (A/64/PV.36), and that its \r\nconsideration by the General Assembly was in response \r\nto cynical political manoeuvres and not principles.  \r\n The Human Rights Council is clear and \r\nunambiguous in its resolution when it strongly \r\ncondemns all policies adopted by Israel, the occupying \r\nPower. It also condemns the recent violations of human \r\nrights committed by Israel in East Jerusalem. For \r\nVenezuela, the report of the United Nations Fact-\r\nFinding Mission on the Gaza Conflict and the Human \r\nRights Council resolution are worthy of recognition.  \r\n A/64/PV.39\r\n \r\n9 09-59485 \r\n \r\n The recommendation of the Goldstone report is \r\ncommendable in that it seeks to create a fund to \r\nguarantee compensation to the Palestinian victims of \r\nIsrael’s criminal acts, with the understanding that the \r\nfunding should come entirely from the Government of \r\nthat country.  \r\n The aforementioned report conclusively \r\ndemonstrates the organization, planning and \r\nimplementation of the policy of extermination carried \r\nout by the Israeli State against the Palestinian nation. \r\nAccording to the report, these acts of violence generate \r\nindividual criminal responsibility. Those on the Israeli \r\nside responsible for the thousands of dead and \r\nwounded should be brought to justice.  \r\n In its conclusion, the report emphasizes the \r\nmultiple and massive violations of the Fourth Geneva \r\nConvention, which are considered to be war crimes \r\ncommitted by the Israeli occupying forces. The report \r\nconcludes that the prolonged blockade of Gaza by the \r\nIsraeli Government, which includes the deprivation of \r\nthe basic means of sustenance, could be considered \r\ncrimes against humanity.  \r\n Israel’s military operations in Gaza are a \r\nlamentable example of the disastrous Dahiya doctrine, \r\nput into practice by Israel during its invasion of \r\nLebanon in 2006 and which is characterized by the use \r\nof disproportionate force, the mass destruction of \r\ncivilian property and infrastructure and the suffering \r\ninflicted on civilians. Indeed, the Israel Government \r\nitself has declared that the Gaza invasion was planned \r\nin a comprehensive manner and on a large scale. \r\n The international community must acknowledge \r\nthe willingness of the Palestinian authorities to \r\ncooperate with the work of the Fact-Finding Mission, \r\nwhich is in stark contrast to the position of the Israeli \r\nleaders, who repeatedly have ignored all resolutions of \r\nthe main organs of the United Nations on the \r\nPalestinian issue. They have also refused to cooperate \r\nwith the 23 United Nations-appointed fact-finding \r\nmissions since 1947. That clearly demonstrates the \r\ngross violation of international law by the Israeli \r\nregime.  \r\n The report we are discussing today reinforces the \r\nneed for the General Assembly to continue to review \r\nregularly all those topics in the area of international \r\npeace and security that the Security Council cannot or \r\nwill not resolve.  \r\n The complicit tolerance shown by some members \r\nof the Security Council with respect to the systematic \r\naggression and crimes under international law \r\ncommitted by Israel against the Palestinian people, \r\nnation and State is alarming.  \r\n Venezuela is concerned that some members of the \r\nSecurity Council, in exercising their right of veto, \r\ncould block an initiative that could be conducive to \r\nprosecuting Israeli genocide. Our concern further \r\nincreases when a super-Power and permanent member \r\nof the Security Council is the main ally of the country \r\nresponsible for genocide and is the chief architect of \r\nthe irrational and disproportionate arms build-up \r\ndeveloped by Israel and which has turned this nation \r\ninto a nuclear Power. \r\n The financial and military resources provided by \r\nthe United States to the Government of Israel, as well \r\nas the protection that is afforded it in international \r\nforums, further support the genocide against the \r\nPalestinian people. The ineffectiveness of the United \r\nNations in the face of a history of Israeli \r\naggressiveness must cease. Those responsible for the \r\ngenocide of the Palestinian people should be promptly \r\npunished for their crimes and brought before the \r\nInternational Criminal Court.  \r\n The policies and practices of the Israeli \r\nGovernment violate the inalienable right of the \r\nPalestinians to self-determination. It is unjust and \r\nabsurd to place on the same level the genocidal \r\nGovernment of Israel and the Palestinian forces which, \r\nunder the protection of their inalienable historical \r\nrights and in the exercise of legitimate self-defence, \r\nresist the criminal aggression against their nation and \r\ntheir people.  \r\n We wish to recall that the revolutionary \r\nGovernment of President Hugo Chávez Frías \r\nsuspended diplomatic relations with the Government of \r\nIsrael as a result of the brutal invasion of Gaza by its \r\narmed forces, and is not willing to resume its relations \r\nuntil the inhuman treatment of the Palestinian people \r\nceases. \r\n The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela reaffirms \r\nits unequivocal support for the Palestinian people’s \r\nright to self-determination. We support their struggle \r\nagainst the occupying Power, as well as their historical \r\nclaims. The Palestinian people have a right to resist the \r\noccupying Power. Their heroism is worthy of \r\nadmiration and respect. This is why we wish to recall \r\nA/64/PV.39  \r\n \r\n09-59485 10 \r\n \r\nthe words of the great poet of the Palestinian \r\nresistance, Ali Ahmad Said, better known as Adonis, \r\nwho wrote that darkness is born kneeling whereas, \r\nlight is born standing up. \r\n Venezuela hopes that the resolution that we adopt \r\nwill reflects the expectations of the Palestinian people \r\nwho demand justice, without delay, for the perpetrators \r\nof war crimes and crimes against humanity who \r\nrepeatedly violate international law, in particular, \r\ninternational humanitarian law. \r\n Israel does not deserve another opportunity to \r\ncontinue flouting United Nations resolutions. It should \r\nbe brought without delay before the International \r\nCriminal Court. Israel has committed enough crimes. It \r\nis time for it to be held accountable under international \r\nlaw. The resolution to be adopted by the General \r\nAssembly, therefore, must accept the spirit of the \r\nresolution of the Human Rights Council. It is time for \r\nthis Assembly to be the official voice of the Palestinian \r\nState. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): In accordance \r\nwith General Assembly resolution 477 (V) of 1 November \r\n1950, I now give the floor to the observer of the \r\nLeague of Arab States. \r\n Mr. Mahmassani (League of Arab States) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): I would like to thank you, Mr. President, for \r\naffording us the opportunity to participate in the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s debate on the report of the United \r\nNations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict \r\n(A/HRC/12/48). \r\n The seriousness of the military campaign against \r\nGaza, the blockade imposed by Israel against its \r\ninhabitants and the deprivation of their most basic \r\nneeds has prompted the international community to \r\ndispatch a Fact-Finding Mission, under the leadership \r\nof Justice Richard Goldstone, to look into alleged war \r\ncrimes and crimes against humanity perpetuated by \r\nIsrael during its military campaign in the Gaza Strip \r\nfrom 27 December, 2008 to 18 January 2009. The \r\nconclusions reached by the Mission were identical with \r\nthose reached by the independent fact-finding mission \r\nof the League of Arab States. \r\n In the preparation of its report, the Mission took \r\ninto account the provisions of international \r\nhumanitarian law and human rights law, as well as the \r\nresponsibility and obligations of States, particularly of \r\noccupying Powers, towards civilian inhabitants. It \r\nreached certain factual and legal conclusions to the \r\neffect that Israel, in its aggression against Gaza, \r\ndeliberately killed civilians and used them as human \r\nshields. \r\n Israel’s use of disproportionate force and its \r\nattacks against civilian inhabitants, as well as its \r\ndestruction of civilian property and infrastructure, are \r\nall illegitimate means to realize military and political \r\nobjectives. Such actions undermine international law \r\nand run counter to the United Nations Charter. Israel \r\ncontinues to act as if it were above the law; not holding \r\nit accountable or responsible encourages impunity and \r\ncasts a shadow over the credibility of the United \r\nNations and that of international law. \r\n The time has come for the international \r\ncommunity to put an end to the culture of impunity and \r\nto Israel’s immunity to the consequences of its \r\naggression against the region. The time has also come \r\nto hold the perpetuators of violations of international \r\nlaw and human rights law accountable and to \r\nimplement the machinery of international justice.  \r\n The objective of the Goldstone report is to \r\nsalvage justice and to hold those accused of \r\nperpetuating war crimes accountable for those crimes. \r\nRespect for international humanitarian law and its \r\napplication does not impede the peace process; peace \r\ndoes not run counter to respect of the rights of the \r\nPalestinian people in the occupied territories.  \r\n The draft resolution before us (A/64/L.11) was \r\nprepared in a balanced and objective manner and \r\nrepresents the absolute acceptable minimum for the \r\nimplementation of the recommendations of the \r\nGoldstone report. We would like to urge all Member \r\nStates to vote in favour of the draft resolution for the \r\nsake of accountability and justice. \r\n We express our deep concern over the serious \r\nhumanitarian crisis faced by the Palestinian people in \r\nthe Gaza Strip and the other occupied Palestinian \r\nterritories due to the Israeli blockade and aggression, \r\nas well as over the continued closing of crossing points \r\nand the prevention of access to humanitarian \r\nassistance. We therefore call upon the international \r\ncommunity to compel Israel to lift its blockade and to \r\nensure access of humanitarian assistance to the Gaza \r\nStrip. \r\n Israel continues its actions in East Jerusalem in \r\nan attempt to judaize the city and confiscate its land \r\n A/64/PV.39\r\n \r\n11 09-59485 \r\n \r\nand to isolate it from the remaining Palestinian \r\nterritories through intensified settlement activities \r\nwithin and outside the city. Its blockade, the policy of \r\nhouse demolitions and its attempts to bring down \r\nAl-Aqsa mosque through continued excavations and \r\ntunnel-digging, all seek to change the features of the \r\nArab and Islamic Old City.  \r\n We would like to call attention to the fact that \r\nJerusalem and the Al-Aqsa mosque are in imminent \r\ndanger. We call upon the international community to \r\nput an end to Israel’s flouting of the heritage of the city \r\nand its desecration of the city’s sanctity. We call upon \r\nthe international community to oblige Israel to respect \r\ninternational law, international resolutions and the \r\nFourth Geneva Convention. \r\n The Israeli occupation of Palestinian and Arab \r\nterritories is the root cause of the suffering in our \r\nregion and of so many wars and tragedies. All attempts \r\nand negotiations to put an end to that occupation have \r\nfailed due to Israel’s intransigence and its continued \r\nbuilding of settlements in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritories. \r\n At present, the Middle East question is going \r\nthrough an extremely delicate stage and current efforts \r\nto establish peace through negotiations seem to have \r\nregressed in an alarming way. The continued faltering \r\nof those efforts will only lead to further deterioration \r\nand instability in the region. The international \r\ncommunity considers Israeli settlements in the \r\noccupied Palestinian territories illegitimate and an \r\nobstacle to negotiations, as stated by the United \r\nKingdom’s Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Miliband, \r\na few days ago. \r\n Working to put an end to the building of \r\nsettlements — all settlements — and ensuring the \r\nre-launching of negotiations on a clear and sound basis \r\nin a serious and credible manner is the only way to find \r\na permanent and just solution to the Palestinian \r\nquestion and to establishing peace in the region. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): We shall now \r\nproceed to consider draft resolution A/64/L.11. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n I call on the representative of Israel who wishes \r\nto speak on a point of order. \r\n Mr. Carmon (Israel): I would like to take this \r\nopportunity before the Assembly proceeds to the vote \r\nto seek clarification on an element contained in \r\noperative paragraph 4 of draft resolution A/64/L.11, \r\nwhich is a matter of concern to us and I suspect to \r\nother delegations as well.  \r\n More specifically, we would like to ask, who \r\nexactly would be the accountable “Palestinian side”, \r\nthat would be responsible for undertaking investigations \r\nthat are independent, credible and in conformity with \r\ninternational standards? Would it be the Palestinian \r\nAuthority that was ousted from Gaza in a violent coup \r\nand is not effectively present there? Or would it be the \r\nHamas terrorist organization, terrorist entity, which \r\nviolates every international standard, promotes \r\nterrorism, rejects the recognition of Israel and tries to \r\nderail the region from the track of the peace process?  \r\n Israel, through you, Sir, would like to ask the \r\nsponsors of the draft resolution to clarify this critical \r\naspect so that Member States of the General Assembly \r\nwill know better what they will be voting for. \r\n The President: I give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Egypt, who presented the draft \r\nresolution on behalf of the Arab Group and the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement. \r\n Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt): With regard to operative \r\nparagraph 4 of the draft resolution, the Palestinian \r\nAuthority itself declared that it is going to conduct its \r\nown investigation which is independent, credible and \r\nin conformity with international standards. And Hamas, \r\nwhich may be considered in Israel as a terrorist \r\norganization but is considered the legitimately elected \r\nrepresentative of the Palestinian people, has already \r\nexpressed its willingness to cooperate and to \r\ninvestigate and to prosecute those that are responsible \r\nfor such crimes. \r\n We would like to hear the same from the \r\nrepresentative of Israel. If he can confirm today that \r\nIsrael is willing to undertake investigations that are \r\nindependent, credible and in conformity with \r\ninternational standards, international law and \r\ninternational humanitarian law, I think this would be \r\nvery happy news to the General Assembly before \r\nvoting on this draft resolution. \r\n The President: I give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Israel. \r\n Mr. Carmon (Israel): I thank the representative \r\nof Egypt and will refer to his question later in my \r\nexplanation of vote before the vote. \r\nA/64/PV.39  \r\n \r\n09-59485 12 \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The Assembly \r\nwill now proceed to take action on draft resolution \r\nA/64/L.11. Before giving the floor to those \r\nrepresentatives who wish to speak in explanation of \r\nvote before the voting, may I remind delegations that \r\nexplanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and \r\nshould be made by delegations from their seats. \r\n Mr. Wolff (United States of America): The \r\nUnited States remains deeply concerned about the \r\nhuman suffering of the Palestinian and Israeli peoples \r\nthat results from the ongoing Arab-Israeli conflict. The \r\nbest way to end that suffering is to bring about a \r\ncomprehensive peace in the region, including two \r\nStates, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace \r\nand security. The United States is firmly committed to \r\npursuing that goal. \r\n As we urge the parties to restart permanent status \r\nnegotiations leading to the creation of a Palestinian \r\nState, we should all be seeking to advance the cause of \r\npeace, and doing nothing to hinder it. The United \r\nStates strongly supports accountability for human \r\nrights and humanitarian law violations in relation to the \r\nGaza conflict. Our goal is to achieve genuine \r\naccountability in a way that respects internal processes \r\nand the ongoing efforts to restart permanent status \r\nnegotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.  \r\n As the United States made clear in Geneva, we \r\nbelieve that the Goldstone report is deeply flawed, \r\nincluding its unbalanced focus on Israel, its sweeping \r\nconclusions of law, the excessively negative inferences \r\nit draws about Israel’s intentions and actions, its failure \r\nto deal adequately with the asymmetrical nature of the \r\nGaza conflict, its failure to assign appropriate \r\nresponsibility to Hamas for its decision to base itself \r\nand its operations in heavily civilian-populated urban \r\nareas and its many overreaching recommendations. \r\n First, let me point out that we appreciate that the \r\ndraft resolution under consideration calls on both Israel \r\nand the Palestinians, although it does not name Hamas, \r\nto pursue investigations of the allegations that pertain \r\nto each of them in the report. This is an advance over \r\nthe original one-sided mandate provided by the Human \r\nRights Council to the Goldstone Commission. \r\n We will continue to call for all parties to meet \r\ntheir responsibilities and pursue credible, domestic \r\ninvestigations. Nevertheless, we also have real \r\nconcerns about this draft resolution. Given the \r\nfar-reaching legal conclusions and recommendations of \r\nthe 575-page Goldstone report, including findings that \r\nhave serious implications for conflicts in other parts of \r\nthe world, we do not think it appropriate to endorse the \r\nreport in its entirety. \r\n Attempting as this draft resolution does to press \r\nthe Security Council to take this matter up is equally \r\nunconstructive. The Security Council is already seized \r\nof the situation in the Middle East and holds monthly \r\nmeetings on the topic — the only subject on the \r\nCouncil’s entire agenda that is discussed with such \r\nfrequency. As many Member States have made clear, \r\nthe appropriate forum for discussion of this report is \r\nthe Human Rights Council.  \r\n The draft resolution also unhelpfully introduces \r\ninternational supervision of the investigations to be \r\nundertaken by the parties that would interfere with the \r\nparties’ ability to conduct their own processes. The \r\nproposed convocation of the High Contracting Parties \r\nto the Fourth Geneva Convention is also unnecessary \r\nand unproductive. Convening a conference of the \r\nContracting Parties to the Geneva Convention for the \r\npurpose of spotlighting one country would only \r\nheighten divisions and could set back the process of \r\nrestarting permanent status negotiations. That and other \r\nimbalanced references to the parties throughout the \r\ntext, including the failure to mention Hamas by name, \r\nconvey the impression that the Assembly is once again \r\nhandling Arab-Israeli issues in an unbalanced manner. \r\n For those reasons, we will vote against the draft \r\nresolution, but we believe that life-saving progress can \r\nbe made if we can lift our sights and look towards a \r\nmore hopeful future. The United States will continue to \r\nwork resolutely in pursuit of a just and lasting peace. \r\n Mr. Carmon (Israel): Two days after the \r\nrevelation of Hamas’s newly improved Iranian-made \r\nrockets and one day after the interception of a ship, the \r\nFrancop, loaded with hundreds of tons of rockets and \r\nammunition destined to be launched at Israeli \r\npopulation centres, which is a grave event — we have \r\njust submitted our complaint an hour ago to the \r\nSecurity Council — this draft resolution (A/64/L.11) \r\nmocks the reality faced by democratic States, such as \r\nIsrael, that face relentless terrorist threats.  \r\n The draft resolution before us endorses and \r\nlegitimizes a deeply flawed, one-sided and prejudiced \r\nreport of the discredited Human Rights Council and its \r\npoliticized work that bends both facts and the law. It \r\ndisregards Israel’s inherent right to defend its citizens \r\n A/64/PV.39\r\n \r\n13 09-59485 \r\n \r\nin the face of ongoing terrorist attacks. It represents yet \r\nanother pretext to bash Israel at the United Nations and \r\nis detrimental to any positive diplomatic engagement in \r\nthe region. It attempts to export from Geneva to New \r\nYork a campaign of de-legitimization. \r\n While Israel has been conducting professional, \r\ncredible and thorough investigations, as part of its \r\nstandard operating procedures and irrespective of any \r\nUnited Nations report, the report before the Assembly \r\n(A/64/53/Add.1) attempts to draw an implausible \r\nequivalence between Israel, a democracy exercising its \r\ninherent right to defend itself from terrorist attacks, \r\nand those who target Israeli civilians and operate from \r\nbehind Palestinian mosques, hospitals, schools and \r\nhuman shields or, alternatively, those who effectively \r\nare absent from Gaza at this point.  \r\n The draft resolution, in paragraph 4, refers to the \r\n“Palestinian side”. Yet, although we have received \r\nsome clarification that does not resolve the issue, I will \r\nstill put the question before the Assembly as to who \r\nprecisely that accountable Palestinian side is. Is that \r\nthe Palestinian Authority that was ousted from power \r\nin the Gaza Strip in a bloody coup? Is it the Hamas \r\nterrorist organization that violently seized control of \r\nGaza, an organization that rejects the recognition of \r\nIsrael and any peaceful solution of the conflict? \r\n For those and other reasons, Israel has called for \r\na recorded vote on this draft resolution and will vote \r\nagainst the draft resolution. And we urge all other \r\nMember States to do the same. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): We have thus \r\nheard the last speaker in explanation of vote before the \r\nvote. \r\n The Assembly will now take action on draft \r\nresolution A/64/L.11, entitled “Follow-up to the report \r\nof the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the \r\nGaza Conflict”. A recorded vote has been requested. \r\n Before proceeding to take action on the draft \r\nresolution, I should like to announce that, since the \r\nintroduction of draft resolution A/64/L.11, the \r\nfollowing countries have become sponsors: Algeria, \r\nSenegal, Somalia, South Africa and the Sudan. \r\n  A recorded vote was taken. \r\n \r\nIn favour: \r\nAfghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Angola, Antigua \r\nand Barbuda, Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, \r\nBahamas, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Barbados, \r\nBelarus, Belize, Benin, Bolivia (Plurinational \r\nState of), Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, \r\nBrazil, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Central \r\nAfrican Republic, Chad, Chile, China, Comoros, \r\nCongo, Cuba, Cyprus, Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea, Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo, Djibouti, Dominica, Dominican Republic, \r\nEcuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Eritrea, Gabon, \r\nGambia, Ghana, Grenada, Guatemala, Guinea, \r\nGuinea-Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, India, Indonesia, \r\nIran (Islamic Republic of), Iraq, Ireland, Jamaica, \r\nJordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Lao People’s \r\nDemocratic Republic, Lebanon, Lesotho, Libyan \r\nArab Jamahiriya, Malawi, Malaysia, Maldives, \r\nMali, Malta, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mexico, \r\nMongolia, Morocco, Mozambique, Myanmar, \r\nNamibia, Nepal, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, \r\nOman, Pakistan, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, \r\nPortugal, Qatar, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and \r\nthe Grenadines, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Serbia, \r\nSierra Leone, Singapore, Slovenia, Solomon \r\nIslands, Somalia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Sudan, \r\nSuriname, Switzerland, Syrian Arab Republic, \r\nTajikistan, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Trinidad and \r\nTobago, Tunisia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, \r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania, Uzbekistan, \r\nVenezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), Viet Nam, \r\nYemen, Zambia, Zimbabwe. \r\nAgainst: \r\nAustralia, Canada, Czech Republic, Germany, \r\nHungary, Israel, Italy, Marshall Islands, \r\nMicronesia (Federated States of), Nauru, \r\nNetherlands, Palau, Panama, Poland, Slovakia, \r\nthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, \r\nUkraine, United States of America. \r\nAbstaining: \r\nAndorra, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Burkina \r\nFaso, Burundi, Cameroon, Colombia, Costa Rica, \r\nCroatia, Denmark, Estonia, Ethiopia, Fiji, \r\nFinland, France, Georgia, Greece, Iceland, Japan, \r\nKenya, Latvia, Liberia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, \r\nLuxembourg, Monaco, Montenegro, New \r\nZealand, Norway, Papua New Guinea, Republic \r\nof Korea, Republic of Moldova, Romania, \r\nRussian Federation, Samoa, San Marino, Spain, \r\nSwaziland, Sweden, Tonga, Uganda, United \r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, \r\nUruguay. \r\nA/64/PV.39  \r\n \r\n09-59485 14 \r\n \r\n Argentina wishes to point out that in general it \r\nagrees with the report produced by Judge Goldstone \r\nand the Fact-Finding Mission (A/HRC/12/48), as well \r\nas with the first periodic report of the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights (A/HRC/S-12/1), \r\nespecially the emphasis on the need to combat \r\nimpunity through the investigation of the facts and the \r\ntrial of the perpetrators. \r\n That said, Argentina wishes to highlight that it \r\ncontinues to believe that the recommendations \r\ncontained in the report of the United Nations Fact-\r\nFinding Mission require a level-headed analysis in the \r\nlight of their implications and the complexity and \r\ndifficulty of implementing some of them. \r\n Mr. Gatan (Philippines): The Philippines has \r\nalways been unwavering in its strong support for the \r\nMiddle East peace process based on a two-State \r\nsolution, with Israel and Palestine living side by side in \r\npeace, harmony and prosperity. It firmly believes that \r\nthe promotion and protection of the human rights of \r\nboth Israeli and Palestinian civilians represent a critical \r\nand crucial element for establishing a just and lasting \r\npeace in the region.  \r\n In that regard, the Philippines welcomes the \r\nsubmission of the report of the United Nations Fact-\r\nFinding Mission on the Gaza Conflict (A/HRC/12/48) \r\nand its information on the human rights situation in \r\nGaza. However, in the higher interest of truth, justice \r\nand due process, the report should be considered and \r\nstudied seriously and carefully by the appropriate \r\nUnited Nations bodies acting within their respective \r\nmandates, as well as by all parties concerned.  \r\n The Philippines supports resolution 64/10 on the \r\nMission’s report. In no case, however, should it be \r\nconsidered as a precedent. It should only apply to the \r\nGaza situation as part of the Middle East conflict, \r\nwhich has long been on the agenda of the Security \r\nCouncil under Chapter VI of the United Nations \r\nCharter.  \r\n Mr. Hoxha (Albania): Albania voted in favour of \r\nresolution 64/10 believing firmly that its call would \r\nbring the international community one step closer to \r\nensuring full respect for human life and dignity and to \r\nthe fulfilment of justice for those who lost their lives in \r\nthe tragic events of Gaza and for those who are \r\ngenuinely striving to build a peaceful future.  \r\n This resolution is not and should not be seen as a \r\ncondemnation of anyone. To the contrary, we indeed \r\nsee in this resolution an opportunity to strengthen \r\npeace by justice, in the hope that the events of 2008 \r\nwill not be repeated and will serve as a reminder of the \r\nvital need to respect each other’s fundamental rights to \r\npeaceful existence and prosperity.  \r\n We cannot remain silent observers when a United \r\nNations fact-finding mission has reported grave \r\nviolations of international humanitarian law, \r\nindependent of the question of which party committed \r\nthem. Both parties involved need to pursue a thorough, \r\nindependent investigation, which will serve first and \r\nforemost themselves, will serve all of us and, most \r\nimportantly, will serve reconciliation and peace, a goal \r\nthe world has been pursuing for decades, unfortunately \r\nwithout concrete results. Albania voted based on the \r\nprinciple that the pursuit of justice and truth, respect \r\nfor international humanitarian law and the need to end \r\nimpunity are fundamental to the development of \r\nhealthy democracy and the process of peace-building \r\nwithin and among societies, countries and regions of \r\nthe world. \r\n Mr. Wetland (Norway): The significance of the \r\ndecision we have just debated goes far beyond the \r\nGaza conflict. It is about our responsibility to protect \r\nvulnerable groups in armed conflict. It is about \r\nrestoring the role of international humanitarian law and \r\nthe importance of full respect for fundamental \r\nprinciples that are at the foundation of the United \r\nNations — nothing less. \r\n We believe the main focus of draft resolution \r\nA/64/L.11 was relevant and constructive. The \r\ninvestigations by the parties should be independent and \r\ncredible and comply with international standards. The \r\nUnited Nations Secretary-General and the Human \r\nRights Council should be mandated to secure the \r\ninternational monitoring of the national investigations.  \r\n In order for that message to come through, we \r\npresented a very limited proposal that would have \r\nallowed for much broader support. Now we strongly \r\nregret that the main sponsors did not incorporate our \r\nsuggestion into the draft resolution. We believe that the \r\nfailure to do so demonstrates that the decision was not \r\nonly about protecting victims of armed conflict in \r\nGaza, in southern Israel or indeed elsewhere. We \r\ncannot interpret it as anything but a wish to preserve \r\nthe politicization of the Middle East issues, which we \r\n A/64/PV.39\r\n \r\n15 09-59485 \r\n \r\nsee far too often. Yet again we at the United Nations \r\nare turning what is an existential question into a highly \r\npoliticized debate. That is not in the interest of the \r\nvictims we all claim to speak for. For that reason, \r\nNorway abstained. \r\n Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): The Russian Federation was forced to abstain \r\nin the General Assembly vote on draft resolution \r\nA/64/L.11 on the discussion of the report of the Human \r\nRights Council (A/64/53/Add.1). The main topic of \r\nthat document is the report of the United Nations Fact-\r\nFinding Mission on the Gaza Conflict (A/HRC/12/48), \r\nheaded by Judge Richard Goldstone, detailing human \r\nrights violations committed during that winter conflict.  \r\n When the Goldstone report first came out, we \r\nimmediately deemed it to contain some conclusions we \r\ncould agree with. At the same time, the document \r\ncontained assessments that we could not agree with and \r\nthat required further work. However, the Goldstone \r\nreport was published and submitted to the Human \r\nRights Council, where work began on a resolution on \r\nthe report.  \r\n Our delegation, along with a number of other \r\nMissions in Geneva, played an important role in \r\nensuring that the resolution was political in nature and \r\nthat it would support the idea of national investigations \r\nbut would not seek to continue a discussion on the \r\nmatter in the Security Council. We remain convinced \r\nthat that would only complicate establishing conditions \r\nto achieve a comprehensive settlement in the Middle \r\nEast.  \r\n That draft resolution was agreed to but, as we all \r\nknow, it was then withdrawn and replaced with a new \r\ntext that did not take into consideration the \r\namendments made by the Russian delegation that \r\nwould have kept the discussion of the matter within the \r\npolitical sphere in the Human Rights Council.  \r\n In an emotionally charged atmosphere in Geneva, \r\napart from the topics addressed in the Goldstone report, \r\nthe draft included other important issues for the peace \r\nprocess, including the need to cease archaeological \r\nexcavations in Jerusalem, which risk damaging the \r\nholy sites, and the importance of taking specific steps \r\nto alleviate the blockade of Gaza and to satisfy the \r\nbasic needs of the Palestinian people, who are in an \r\nextremely difficult situation. In that regard, guided by \r\nits fundamental stance on those issues, Russia \r\nsupported the Human Rights Council draft resolution, \r\nbut at the same time it made a statement that it did not \r\nagree with a part of the draft resolution that called for \r\nsending the Goldstone report to the Security Council \r\nfor consideration and possible future action. \r\nUnfortunately, despite the arguments of many \r\ndelegations, mentions of the Security Council were \r\nkept in the General Assembly draft resolution. That is \r\nnot conducive to a level-headed, professional analysis \r\nof the Goldstone report’s recommendations, which \r\nshould continue primarily in the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, including the importance of both Israel and \r\nthe Palestinians conducting their own investigations. \r\n Russia, as a permanent member of the Security \r\nCouncil and a participant in the Quartet, continues to \r\nbe unswervingly guided by the international legal basis \r\nfor a Middle East settlement that has been reaffirmed \r\nin all recent Security Council resolutions as well as by \r\nthe four leading mediators and the League of Arab \r\nStates. The basis of this is the relevant Security \r\nCouncil resolutions, the Road Map and the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative.  \r\n An important element that is now necessary in \r\norder to re-launch negotiations is the first part of the \r\nRoad Map, which requires the parties to refrain from \r\nany steps that could prejudice the outcome of final \r\nstatus issue discussions, namely, the future of \r\nJerusalem, borders, refugees and settlements. There is \r\na need to continue our collective work, in particular \r\nwithin the United Nations, to achieve those goals in the \r\ncontext of a comprehensive Middle East settlement. \r\n Mr. Ja’afari (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): The delegation of the Syrian Arab Republic \r\nvoted in favour of resolution A/64/10, which the \r\nAssembly adopted a short while ago regarding holding \r\nIsrael, as the occupying Power, accountable for the \r\ncrimes it committed during the aggression against \r\nGaza. We did this based on our belief in the justice of \r\nthe cause of the Palestinian people and their struggle \r\nfor liberation, although the resolution does not meet \r\nour minimum expectations. \r\n My delegation thanks you, Mr. President, for \r\nresponding quickly to the Human Rights Council’s \r\nresolution and for affording the international \r\ncommunity the opportunity to condemn the war crimes \r\nand crimes of genocide perpetrated by Israel in full \r\nview of the States and peoples of the world. \r\n Syria emphasizes that it views the votes of the \r\nMember States on today’s General Assembly resolution \r\nA/64/PV.39  \r\n \r\n09-59485 16 \r\n \r\nas an indicator of the credibility of those States \r\nvis-à-vis one of the important aspects of the work of \r\nour international Organization. We do not believe that \r\nthere is any justification whatsoever for not voting in \r\nfavour of this modest resolution. The humanitarian \r\nduty and responsibility required of our Organization in \r\nstanding up to Israel’s crimes make it plain that States \r\nthat allow Israel to continue its violations of \r\ninternational humanitarian law and human rights law \r\nhave simply shirked their responsibilities. Indeed, they \r\nhave gone so far in adhering to double standards that \r\nwe may be disinclined henceforth to sit together with \r\nthem to discuss issues of human rights or international \r\nhumanitarian law. \r\n We must all realize that the picture before us has \r\nbecome more clear than ever before, as issues of \r\nhuman rights and, frequently, of international \r\nhumanitarian law have become mere tools in the hands \r\nof some, who used them to put pressure on and to \r\nblackmail States with whose political positions, \r\neconomic interests and types of rule and authority they \r\ndisagree. \r\n For all these reasons, my delegation would like to \r\nregister its rejection of any suggestion in the just-\r\nadopted resolution implying that aggressor and victim \r\nmay be equated. Israel is the Power occupying \r\nPalestinian land. It was Israel that used internationally \r\nprohibited weapons to murder women, children, the \r\nelderly and other innocents in Palestine. The distortion \r\nof the facts is a denial of the right of an occupied \r\npeople to resist their occupiers. Syria, along with \r\nnumerous others who share our conviction, will not \r\nallow the truth to be transformed into falsehood or to \r\nlet injustice and murder triumph over justice and the \r\nrule of law. \r\n Finally, my delegation urges all Member States, \r\nas well as the Security Council, to take the content of \r\nthis resolution to its logical conclusion and to mete out \r\npunishment to the Israelis, who perpetrated war crimes \r\nand crimes against humanity in Gaza. \r\n Mr. Heller (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): Mexico \r\nvoted in favour of resolution 64/10 because we \r\nacknowledge the need to conduct credible and \r\nindependent investigations by all the parties involved \r\nin the Gaza conflict. We would like to stress how \r\nimportant it is to prevent impunity, guarantee justice, \r\npromote peace and prevent new violations. We would, \r\nhowever, have preferred language different from the \r\nword “endorses” that is used in the report of the \r\nHuman Rights Council (A/HRC/12/48), and which is \r\nrepeated in operative paragraph 1 of the Assembly’s \r\nresolution, in order to obtain the support of a larger \r\nnumber of Member States. \r\n Mexico reiterates its conviction that we need to \r\nsupport United Nations efforts to guarantee \r\naccountability with respect to violations of human \r\nrights and international humanitarian law. Our vote was \r\nin favour of accountability and not of all the \r\nrecommendations contained in this report. \r\n Mr. Muñoz (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): Chile \r\nwould like to thank you, Mr. President, for organizing \r\nthis meeting to discuss the report on the Fact-Finding \r\nMission on the Gaza Conflict (A/HRC/12/48), \r\nestablished by the Human Rights Council and chaired \r\nby Justice Richard Goldstone. The report describes and \r\nanalyses, in an international framework, the allegations \r\nof the violations of human rights that took place during \r\nOperation Cast Lead. This period saw the undermining \r\nof fundamental principles of international humanitarian \r\nlaw, such as proportionality in the use of force, \r\ndistinguishing between civilians and armed forces, and \r\nprecautions against harming civilians. \r\n Chile supports the establishment of a Palestinian \r\nState, as well as the right of Israel to live within secure \r\nborders, as recognized by the relevant resolutions of \r\nthe United Nations. We also recognize the right to \r\nlegitimate self-defence, in form and principle, as \r\narticulated in Article 51 of the Charter, especially the \r\nprinciple of proportionality as established in \r\ninternational law. In this context, Chile supports the \r\nresolution of the Human Rights Council and endorses \r\nthe recommendations of the Fact-Finding Mission.  \r\n We understand that the purpose of the \r\nrecommendations contained in the report should be to \r\ninvestigate the allegations of serious violations \r\ncommitted by the Israeli forces and Palestinian \r\nfactions. We reiterate that in our opinion, what is most \r\nimportant is upholding international humanitarian law \r\nand respect for human rights. It is essential that, first, \r\nindependent and credible investigations be conducted \r\ninto the alleged violations; secondly, that those \r\nresponsible be sent to trial; and thirdly, that reparations \r\nbe made to the victims. Chile calls on all parties \r\nconcerned to comply with their obligations. \r\n Chile would like to take this opportunity to state \r\nthat we supported the Assembly’s newly adopted \r\n A/64/PV.39\r\n \r\n17 09-59485 \r\n \r\nresolution. We would like to emphasize the role that \r\nthe Human Rights Council should play in ensuring the \r\nmonitoring of compliance with the recommendations \r\nof the Fact-Finding Mission. The Human Rights \r\nCouncil should be the body that continues to examine \r\nthe results of investigations before referring them to \r\nother organs of the United Nations system. \r\n Finally, Chile would like to appeal for an end to \r\nall the obstacles of provocation and incitement to \r\nviolence, wherever they stem from, in order to \r\nestablish conditions of trust and to renew the \r\nnegotiations that all of us desire and have desired for \r\nso long. \r\n Mr. Rosenthal (Guatemala) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nGuatemala voted in favour of resolution 64/10. It was a \r\ndecision we had to consider very carefully, because, \r\nlike other delegations in this chamber, we noted certain \r\nflaws in the report of the Fact-Finding Mission on the \r\nGaza Conflict (A/HRC/12/48) that the authors of the \r\nreport acknowledge themselves. \r\n That having been said, we value the fact that the \r\nMission acknowledged the complexity of the situation \r\nand condemned both sides for serious violations of \r\nhuman rights of civilians in both Gaza and Israel. \r\nThrough our vote, we would like to reiterate our total \r\nrejection of impunity, as well as our unswerving \r\ncommitment to reaching a lasting peace in the Middle \r\nEast which culminates in the creation of a sovereign, \r\nindependent and viable Palestinian State within secure \r\nand recognized borders, like its neighbour, the State of \r\nIsrael. \r\n Mr. Ali (Malaysia): Malaysia voted in favour of \r\nresolution 64/10 because we strongly feel that Israel, \r\nthe main perpetrator in the Gaza conflict, should be \r\nheld accountable for the war crimes and grave \r\nviolations of human rights and international \r\nhumanitarian law which it had committed during the \r\nconflict. In fact, we would have wanted stronger \r\nlanguage in the resolution to reflect this view so as not \r\nto equate the victims with the perpetrator. \r\n Mr. Quinlan (Australia): Australia was deeply \r\nsaddened by the conflict in the Gaza Strip and southern \r\nIsrael last December and January, and we are very \r\ndisturbed at the loss of momentum in recent efforts to \r\nrestart the peace process. We ask the parties to do \r\nmore.  \r\n We voted against resolution 64/10 because of a \r\nnumber of genuine concerns arising from the language \r\nof the text and from the flawed nature of the report it is \r\nbased on, which we simply cannot endorse. However, \r\nthis vote in no way reduces our fundamental concern \r\nabout the humanitarian situation of the people of Gaza.  \r\n Consistently before, during and after the Gaza \r\nconflict, we called on all the parties to take all \r\nnecessary steps to minimize harm to civilians, and we \r\ncall on the parties now to act to prevent the continuing \r\nhumanitarian crisis in Gaza, a situation that is \r\nunacceptable.  \r\n During the conflict itself, Australia said clearly \r\nthat it supported a proper investigation of any \r\nallegations of breaches of human rights and \r\ninternational humanitarian law. That is a position we \r\nmaintain and one which we convey firmly in our recent \r\nstatements to the Human Rights Council and to the \r\nSecurity Council.  \r\n It is crucial that these serious matters be dealt \r\nwith properly, and today we join the call on the parties \r\nto credibly investigate all allegations that have been \r\nmade of violations of human rights and international \r\nhumanitarian law and to inform the international \r\ncommunity of the results of those investigations. \r\n Mr. Normandin (Canada): Canada was \r\nconcerned about the unbalanced nature of the mandate \r\nof the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the \r\nGaza Conflict when it was first considered in that it did \r\nnot clearly call for investigation of both sides and did \r\nnot recognize that rocket fire on Israel led to the crisis. \r\nIn commissioning this study, the Human Rights \r\nCouncil pre-emptively assumed Israel’s culpability. \r\nWhile recognizing that the report that was released \r\ndoes address issues relating to both parties, we are \r\nnevertheless concerned about its overall unbalanced \r\nnature.  \r\n We were further concerned about the decision to \r\nproceed with the twelfth special session of the Human \r\nRights Council, as we believe that the situation in the \r\nMiddle East must be addressed in a balanced and \r\nnon-politicized manner — one that promotes a \r\nnegotiated solution rather than one that further \r\nantagonizes the parties. \r\n For these reasons, Canada voted no on resolution \r\n64/10. That said, Canada continues to call on all parties \r\nto respect their obligations under human rights and \r\nA/64/PV.39  \r\n \r\n09-59485 18 \r\n \r\ninternational humanitarian law. We expect all credible \r\nreports of wrongdoing by armed forces — regular or \r\nirregular — to be investigated by the relevant \r\nauthorities, and we note that Israel is carrying out \r\ninvestigations and we look forward to their full \r\ndisclosure when concluded. \r\n Mr. Schaper (Netherlands): The Netherlands has \r\njust voted no on resolution 64/10, adopted just now. As \r\nwe stated in our explanation of vote in Geneva three \r\nweeks ago, we welcomed the work of the Goldstone \r\nmission, but we have difficulty in welcoming the report \r\nand endorsing all of its recommendations without \r\nfurther restrictions. The Netherlands therefore voted \r\nagainst the resolution at the Human Rights Council in \r\nGeneva. We cannot now support a resolution — the \r\none before us — which endorses a resolution we voted \r\nagainst only a few weeks ago. \r\n The Netherlands supports the elements in the \r\nresolution that call for independent investigations by \r\nthe parties. We are convinced that concerned parties \r\nshould pursue their own in-depth investigations into \r\naccusations of violations of human rights and \r\ninternational humanitarian law, and some of these \r\ninvestigations have already been initiated by Israel, \r\nincluding into the strategic considerations of parties \r\nduring the conflict and into the humanitarian aspects of \r\naccess to Gaza as addressed by the Goldstone report. \r\nWhere relevant, the concerned parties must bring to \r\njustice those suspected of violations of human rights \r\nand international humanitarian law.  \r\n While we are supportive of these elements, other \r\nparts of the resolution before us are a source of concern \r\nfor the Netherlands. The Human Rights Council \r\ncommissioned the Goldstone report, and, in our view, \r\nthe Human Rights Council should remain the primary \r\norgan to deal with the report, not the General \r\nAssembly, and certainly not the Security Council, as \r\nthe resolution before us implies.  \r\n Also, the resolution gives the parties three \r\nmonths’ time to investigate possible violations of \r\nhuman rights and humanitarian law. We are puzzled as \r\nto why the Secretary-General has to report on the \r\nimplementation of this resolution in the same three \r\nmonths. In any case, we do not think the Secretary-\r\nGeneral should be given a central role in the \r\nimplementation of this resolution. \r\n Lastly, and in a general sense, it is our overall \r\nfeeling that the resolution will not be conducive to the \r\naim of relaunching the Middle East peace process. \r\n Mrs. Viotti (Brazil): Brazil voted in favour of \r\nresolution 64/10. We reiterate our sincere concern for \r\nthe violations of international humanitarian and human \r\nrights law reported to have occurred in Gaza and \r\nsouthern Israel last December and January. The \r\nGoldstone report represents a serious and important \r\naccount of those violations as it addresses crimes \r\nallegedly committed by both sides. These violations \r\nshould be fully investigated so as to ensure \r\naccountability and justice, prevent impunity from \r\nleading to more violence and encourage the parties to \r\nfind a solution to their differences through peaceful \r\nmeans.  \r\n At this stage, we believe that the report should be \r\nprimarily implemented by the concerned parties with \r\nthe full support of the international community. Israel \r\nand the Palestinians must fully commit to the \r\nestablishment of transparent and serious investigations \r\naccording to international standards. The parties should \r\nbe given adequate time to conduct appropriate \r\nindependent investigations. The seriousness and \r\ncredibility of such investigations and their conclusions, \r\nor absence thereof, should guide the consideration of \r\npossible involvement of other United Nations bodies \r\naccording to their respective functions and powers. \r\n Brazil is a friend of peace and a firm supporter of \r\nthe establishment of an independent, geographically \r\nunited, democratic and economically viable Palestinian \r\nState living side by side with Israel in peace and \r\nsecurity within internationally recognized borders. We \r\nare confident that today’s decision will help us to \r\nachieve this goal. \r\n Ms. Blum (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nColombia abstained in the vote on resolution 64/10. At \r\nthis meeting, my country would like to reiterate its \r\nsupport for achieving a negotiated and peaceful \r\nsolution to the question of Palestine and thus values all \r\nefforts aimed at achieving an agreement between the \r\nparties and reaching peace between Israel and \r\nPalestine. We reiterate the importance of direct \r\ndialogue as the best choice for continuing to move \r\ncloser to peace and for ensuring positive results for the \r\npeoples of Israel and Palestine. My country will \r\ncontinue to provide its support to all initiatives aimed \r\nattaining a result that is satisfactory to the parties — \r\n A/64/PV.39\r\n \r\n19 09-59485 \r\n \r\nguided by Colombia’s commitment to multilateralism \r\nand the peaceful resolution of disputes. At the same \r\ntime, Colombia regrets the acts of violence produced \r\nby attacks that could affect the civilian population, \r\nregardless of their origin. My delegation reiterates its \r\ncommitment to achieving full defence of human rights, \r\nand we invite all countries to move forward \r\nconstructively in strengthening their institutional \r\ncapacities to ensure implementation of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights. \r\n Mr. McLay (New Zealand): New Zealand takes \r\nthis opportunity to explain its abstention in the vote on \r\nresolution 64/10. That position must be seen in the \r\nwider context of the Middle East peace process and our \r\nlong-standing support for international justice. Our \r\nposition is based on a number of principles. \r\n New Zealand seeks a just, enduring, \r\ncomprehensive peace settlement based on the two-State \r\nsolution, with Israel and Palestine living side by side in \r\npeace and security, and we call on all parties to resume \r\nnegotiations to that end. New Zealand has consistently \r\ncalled for investigations into alleged violations of \r\nhuman rights and humanitarian law arising from the \r\nconflict. There should be no impunity. Perpetrators of \r\nany such violations must be brought to justice. \r\n We would have preferred that this issue be \r\nconsidered by the Human Rights Council in Geneva in \r\nMarch next year, as originally agreed, as this could \r\nhave created a better climate for the required \r\ninvestigations. We object to the continued bias against \r\nIsrael in the handling of this important question in the \r\nHuman Rights Council.  \r\n While we appreciate its position, we regret that \r\nIsrael did not present its version of events to the Fact-\r\nFinding Mission, in particular after the Mission’s \r\noriginal biased mandate was changed by agreement \r\nbetween the President of the Human Rights Council \r\nand Justice Goldstone. All that having been said, the \r\nreport is here, and we must deal with it. \r\n We strongly support Israel’s right to defend itself \r\nand its people from attack of any kind and from \r\nwhatever quarter, in a way that avoids harm to civilians \r\nand is consistent with international law. Equally, we \r\nstrongly support the right of the Palestinian people to \r\nself-determination, consistent with international law. \r\nWe call for an end to Israel’s settlement building, \r\nwhich we regard as a serious impediment to the peace \r\nprocess. We are deeply concerned at the severe \r\nhumanitarian crisis in Gaza, including the impact of \r\nborder movement restrictions, and repeat our calls for \r\nthese restrictions to be eased. We welcome the fact that \r\nnearly 80 truckloads of goods entered Gaza from Israel \r\nthrough the Kerem Shalom crossing, and we call for \r\nsuch openings to continue. We condemn Hamas’s \r\nindiscriminate rocket attacks against Israeli citizens \r\nand the use of civilian-populated urban sites as rocket-\r\nlaunch sites. \r\n Any jurist who accepted the Fact-Finding \r\nMission’s brief would have fully understood the legal \r\nand political path ahead. It is to the credit of Justice \r\nGoldstone and his colleagues that they did not flinch \r\nfrom that task. We consider that serious allegations are \r\nraised by the Goldstone report, and we call for all \r\nparties to begin credible independent domestic \r\ninvestigations into those allegations, conducted in line \r\nwith internationally accepted standards. We will not \r\nprejudge the integrity or the outcome of those \r\ninvestigations. We agree that this was a fact-finding \r\nmission and not a judicial inquiry. The allegations in \r\nthe Goldstone report have not yet been subjected to the \r\nindependent investigation recommended in that report, \r\nand we should not pass judgment as though they had: \r\nthey must be properly and independently investigated. \r\n Although we call on Israel and the Palestinians to \r\ninvestigate the alleged violations, we cannot support a \r\nresolution that, in its first operative paragraph, \r\nendorses a Human Rights Council report on a special \r\nsession that includes a biased, one-sided resolution. \r\nAgainst that background, an abstention was, for us, the \r\nappropriate course. \r\n Mr. Al Habib (Islamic Republic of Iran): My \r\ndelegation voted in favour of resolution 64/10, adopted \r\nunder the agenda item on the report of the Human \r\nRights Council, on the follow-up to the report of the \r\nUnited Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza \r\nConflict. However, I should like to state the following. \r\nWith regard to this resolution, my delegation believes \r\nthat there is imbalance to putting the occupying Power \r\nthat has committed so many abhorrent crimes against \r\nthe people in Gaza with that of the Palestinian side on \r\nthe same and equal footing. Moreover, the report itself \r\nreflected only partial and minimal dimensions of the \r\nwar crimes committed by the Israeli regime in Gaza.  \r\n In response to the baseless allegation made by the \r\nrepresentative of the regime in the occupied territory, \r\nmy delegation should like to point out that the \r\nA/64/PV.39  \r\n \r\n09-59485 20 \r\n \r\nillegitimate regime of the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritories tries to distort the facts and intends, through \r\nthe dissemination of disinformation and issues that are \r\nirrelevant to the subject under consideration in this \r\nbody, to evade the very important dilemma facing that \r\nregime — that is a lack of legitimacy emanating from \r\nmore than 60 years of occupation and brutality in the \r\noccupied Palestinian territories. \r\n Mr. Manjeev Singh Puri (India): India has a \r\ndeep association with and continuing commitment to \r\nPalestine. We voted in favour of resolution 64/10. We \r\nbelieve that the recommendation of the report of the \r\nFact-Finding Mission on the Gaza conflict that both \r\nsides should undertake investigations that are \r\nindependent, credible and in conformity with \r\ninternational standards must be implemented forthwith. \r\nOur vote should, however, not be construed as \r\nendorsing referrals to the International Criminal Court \r\nand the Security Council. \r\n Mr. Hernández-Milian (Costa Rica) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): Costa Rica’s actions in the international \r\narena are guided by the conviction that peace between \r\nnations can only be achieved through respect for \r\ninternational law, international humanitarian law and \r\nhuman rights law. We believe that the international \r\ncommunity must respond to all instances in which \r\nthose norms are broken. Accountability and the fight \r\nagainst impunity are fundamental pillars needed to \r\nstrengthen international humanitarian law and human \r\nrights. In forums and thematic discussions on \r\naccountability and the fight against impunity, Costa \r\nRica has made its position clear, namely, that there are \r\ncrimes whose nature evokes the international \r\ncommunity’s duty to intervene and impose sanctions \r\nunder the standards of internationally recognized \r\njustice. We have stated this more than once, as \r\nmembers of the International Criminal Court and also \r\nin debates on the responsibility to protect and on \r\nuniversal jurisdiction.  \r\n It is the responsibility of all of us to strengthen \r\nthose institutions that promote accountability and make \r\nthe fight against impunity possible, and to refrain from \r\nusing or manipulating those institutions to political \r\nends. Reactionary and unjustified recourse to those \r\ninstruments and institutions can only weaken them. \r\n We believe that the parties must initiate internal \r\ninvestigative proceedings in order to establish who was \r\nresponsible for the violations of human rights and of \r\ninternational humanitarian law. Those investigations \r\nshould be conducted within a reasonable time frame \r\nand should lead to concrete results. Judge Richard \r\nGoldstone has a background that is worthy of respect \r\nand that Costa Rica holds in high regard. The report of \r\nthe United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza \r\nConflict that he headed (A/HRC/12/48) is an admirable \r\nattempt to establish the facts in an objective way. \r\nHowever, that effort was made under particularly \r\ndifficult circumstances, given the lack of cooperation \r\non the part of one of the sides involved. That could \r\nexplain some of the limitations that have been noted in \r\nthe report. Our delegation considers that there is no \r\ncontinuity between the recommendations in the report \r\nand the operative paragraphs of resolution 64/10. \r\n Costa Rica would have liked to have seen in the \r\nresolution a follow-up mechanism whereby the High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights and the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, with the cooperation of the parties, could \r\nsubmit reports to the Human Rights Council and the \r\nGeneral Assembly. The outcome of what has been \r\ninitiated by the resolution’s sponsors will most likely \r\nbe yet another of the never-ending proceedings \r\nwhereby the General Assembly votes year after year on \r\na proposal about the Middle East that has no effect on \r\nthe ground. For that reason we ask: Will that strengthen \r\naccountability as a tool to implement the rule of law \r\ninternationally? Is that the way to fight the impunity \r\nwith which all the many acts violating international \r\nstandards were committed in Gaza during the hostile \r\nactions last December and January? \r\n Finally, will what the sponsors of the resolution \r\nhave initiated work to enforce international standards, \r\npromote accountability and fight impunity? We \r\nhonestly do not think that it will. What all this amounts \r\nto is an attempt to put to frivolous use instruments and \r\ninstitutions that deserve a weightier respect. The loss \r\nof consistency, undermining the principle of \r\naccountability and weakening the fight against \r\nimpunity are not causes that Costa Rica can endorse. \r\nRecognizing the merits of the Fact-Finding Mission’s \r\nreport, even with the limitations that we are all aware \r\nof, Costa Rica is opposed to its banalization and could \r\nnot add its vote to a decision that reflects the many \r\nerrors committed along the way that has led us to \r\nwhere we are. That is the reason for our abstention.  \r\n Mr. Maurer (Switzerland) (spoke in French): \r\nSwitzerland voted in favour of resolution 64/10 for \r\nthree main reasons. First, we consider the nature of the \r\n A/64/PV.39\r\n \r\n21 09-59485 \r\n \r\nconclusions contained in the report of the Fact-Finding \r\nMission on the Gaza Conflict (A/HRC/12/48) require \r\nmonitoring by the international community. The \r\nresolution is an important step in that direction.  \r\n Secondly, combating impunity is crucial because \r\nwhat is at stake is a precondition for sustainable peace \r\nand preventing future violations of international law. \r\nThirdly, the resolution calls in a balanced way for both \r\nparties to carry out independent inquiries in line with \r\ninternational standards. Thus it gives a clear signal that \r\nthis responsibility rests first and foremost with them. \r\nFinally, Switzerland has taken due note of the request \r\nthat necessary measures should be taken to convene a \r\nconference of High Contracting Parties of the Fourth \r\nGeneva Convention of 1949 and Switzerland is \r\navailable to the High Contracting Parties. \r\n Mr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): My delegation \r\nsupports the main thrust of the resolution just adopted. \r\nIn particular, we endorse the call for independent and \r\ncredible investigations carried out in accordance with \r\ninternational standards by both parties. \r\n As we expressed in our statement during the \r\ndebate, we were disappointed by the manner in which \r\nthe Human Rights Council had dealt with the report of \r\nthe United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza \r\nConflict (A/HRC/12/48). Our abstention, which we \r\nhave cast with much regret, is therefore due solely to \r\nthe manner in which the text refers to the report of the \r\nHuman Rights Council (A/64/53/Add.1). \r\n We hope that this resolution will make a genuine \r\ncontribution to ensuring accountability and to \r\naddressing violations of international humanitarian law \r\ndocumented in the Goldstone report. We look forward \r\nto the future consideration of this important topic by \r\nthis Assembly. \r\n Mr. Thalassinós (Panama) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThe resolution we have just adopted urges the \r\nGovernment of Israel and the Palestinian Authority to \r\nconduct credible, independent investigations, in line \r\nwith international standards, on the alleged violations \r\nwithin a time frame of three months. The Republic of \r\nPanama has always respected the principles of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter and we support all multilateral \r\nefforts aimed at achieving a lasting solution to the \r\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict.  \r\n Panama joins the international call for renewing a \r\npeace process that builds on previous accords and \r\ninternational law and that respects the right of both \r\npeoples to live in peace, justice and security as \r\nsovereign, independent States. However, Panama has \r\nsome serious concerns about the objectivity of the \r\nlanguage used in the text of the resolution, because in \r\nfact it prejudges the outcome of the investigations that \r\nhave to be carried out both by the Government of Israel \r\nand the Palestinian authority, and refers the outcome of \r\nthose investigations to the Security Council.  \r\n The international community knows Panama’s \r\nlong history of respect for human rights. However, \r\nwhile it is important for perpetrators of violations to be \r\nheld accountable and face justice, that cannot be done \r\non the basis of a resolution that prejudges the results of \r\ninvestigations. The investigative process should be \r\njust, objective and credible. That is why the Republic \r\nof Panama voted against the resolution. \r\n Mr. Álvarez (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nUruguay rejects and condemns all violations of \r\ninternational humanitarian law and human rights \r\nwithout exception and we hope that in all situations \r\nwhere the international community considers such \r\nviolations they are given equal treatment and that the \r\nfight continues against impunity and the perpetrators of \r\nsuch violations.  \r\n Uruguay has an unshakeable commitment to \r\ninternational humanitarian law and accords a high \r\npriority to the protection of civilians in armed conflict. \r\nProtection of civilians is a legal obligation under \r\ninternational humanitarian law, but it is also an ethical \r\nimperative that reflects the long evolution of \r\nhumankind towards civilizing standards that place \r\nrespect for life, integrity and human dignity at the \r\ncentre of their values.  \r\n Uruguay values the work of the United Nations \r\nFact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict, headed by \r\nJudge Richard Goldstone, and we endorse its report \r\n(A/HRC/12/48). It is a serious document that sought to \r\ninvestigate the grave events that occurred during \r\nOperation Cast Lead, regardless of who the \r\nperpetrators might be. In that spirit, we deem the report \r\nto require a careful study and follow-up of all the \r\nelements that it contains. In particular, we think that its \r\nrecommendations should be the subject of a level-\r\nheaded and thorough examination bearing in mind the \r\ncomplexity of its proposals as well as their possible \r\nramifications, which may include profound consequences \r\nthat are difficult to predict. \r\nA/64/PV.39  \r\n \r\n09-59485 22 \r\n \r\n Uruguay considers it essential that the sides \r\ninvolved conduct their respective investigations on the \r\nfacts that are described and avoid impunity, especially \r\nwith respect to the most serious violations of human \r\nrights and international humanitarian law. We appeal to \r\nthe General Assembly not to politicize a topic as \r\nserious as this one, and especially not to affect \r\nnegotiations currently under way, to remain focused on \r\nachieving a lasting solution to the Middle East conflict \r\nand to have a balanced, equitable approach that calls \r\non all parties involved to live up to their commitments \r\nand obligations. \r\n Mr. Zinsou (Benin) (spoke in French): Benin \r\nvoted in favour of the resolution to demonstrate its \r\nsystematic rejection of human rights violations, \r\nregardless of their origin. Benin’s vote proceeds from \r\nits consistent foreign policy and is directed against no \r\nparticular country.  \r\n No one, under any circumstances, must exempt \r\nthemselves from the obligation to meticulously respect \r\nhuman rights and ensure the protection of civilians. \r\nThe principles of humanity are inviolable and must \r\nremain so under all circumstances.  \r\n Benin believes that the authority of the Geneva \r\nConventions, trampled underfoot in Gaza, must prevail \r\nin all conflict situations. The military operations \r\ncarried out in December 2008 and January 2009 led to \r\nintolerable abuses that gravely undermined \r\ninternational norms and the principles of humanity. \r\nSuch actions are attributable to radicalism, which we \r\ncannot support.  \r\n It is important that in-depth investigations be \r\nconducted outside the framework of any political party \r\nin order to identify and punish those responsible for \r\nproven human rights violations. That would make it \r\npossible to avoid laying the groundwork for impunity \r\nand to prevent a renewed and indefinite spiral of \r\nviolence. Both parties must conduct such investigations \r\nwith full transparency. That said, Benin does not \r\napprove of any use of force to settle international \r\ndisputes, without prejudice to people’s right to use all \r\nmeans recognized in international law to exercise their \r\nright to self-determination.  \r\n Benin advocates dialogue and negotiation to seek \r\nthe path of peace and calls upon States that are able to \r\ninfluence the situation in the Middle East to do their \r\nutmost to achieve a swift settlement of the Israeli-\r\nPalestinian conflict, which has lasted too long. We urge \r\na relaunching of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process \r\nin order to achieve, as soon as possible, the solution of \r\ntwo sovereign States living in peace with each other \r\nand their neighbours within secure and internationally \r\nrecognized borders. We appeal urgently to the parties \r\nto the conflict to resume negotiations in good faith \r\nwith a view to achieving peace as soon as possible. \r\n Mr. Kelly (Ireland): My delegation wishes to \r\nmake clear our position on the resolution that we have \r\nadopted here today. Ireland supported the resolution \r\nbecause of our support for the Fact-Finding Mission \r\nled by Judge Goldstone and for its report \r\n(A/HRC/12/48).  \r\n That document is a serious and very important \r\ncontribution to our understanding of what took place in \r\nGaza and southern Israel. It forms part of the pursuit of \r\nappropriate accountability for actions which occurred \r\nand is supportive of the efforts to ensure that such \r\ntragedies are not repeated. \r\n In voting for the resolution, Ireland wishes to \r\nmake clear that this does not mean that we necessarily \r\nsupport each and every recommendation contained in \r\nthe Goldstone report. Ireland shares the concern of a \r\nnumber of delegations that it was not helpful or \r\nappropriate for the General Assembly to be requested \r\nat this time to endorse the report and its \r\nrecommendations in their entirety. The report is a \r\ncomplex and detailed document, and its \r\nrecommendations cover extremely wide-ranging \r\nactions in many national and international forums, with \r\nwide and far-reaching political and legal implications. \r\nLike many other delegations, we will need time to \r\nconsider those implications carefully before agreeing \r\non the best way forward on these crucial issues. \r\n We do fully support the recommendations which \r\ncall, in the first instance, on the parties to the conflict \r\nin Gaza to respond seriously and comprehensively to \r\nthe findings of the report by launching appropriate \r\ninvestigations into all the allegations of possible \r\nbreaches of international law that are independent and \r\nin conformity with international standards.  \r\n For that reason, we decided to vote in favour of \r\nthe resolution just adopted. \r\n The President: We have heard the last speaker in \r\nexplanation of vote. \r\n I now call on the observer of Palestine. \r\n A/64/PV.39\r\n \r\n23 09-59485 \r\n \r\n Mr. Mansour (Palestine): I wish to express the \r\ngratitude of Palestine, Mr. President, for your \r\noutstanding efforts in facilitating this meeting to \r\nconsider the report of the Human Rights Council \r\n(A/64/53/Add.1) and to discuss and consider the \r\nGoldstone report (A/HRC/12/48). Palestine would also \r\nlike to express its gratitude to all our Arab brothers \r\nwho submitted the draft resolution, along with those \r\nwho sponsored it. We are grateful to all of them for \r\ntheir united stand in submitting the resolution that has \r\nbeen adopted.  \r\n We would also like to express our thanks to all \r\nthose countries that voted in favour of the resolution. I \r\nmust add that we interpret all the abstentions in the \r\nvoting as supportive of the essence of the resolution, \r\nand we take note of some of the problems that those \r\nwho abstained had on the procedural side. \r\n In addition, I do not wish to demean myself by \r\nresponding to the comments and questions by the \r\nrepresentative of Israel, because the Palestinian side \r\ncooperated fully with the members of the Goldstone \r\nteam in their investigation. The Israeli side did not; it \r\nobstructed the efforts of the Goldstone Mission. \r\nTherefore, our actions speak louder than our words, in \r\nterms of not being afraid of international law, but \r\nrather of honouring, respecting and cooperating with it. \r\nThose who claim that theirs is a democratic country are \r\nafraid to subject themselves to investigation by such a \r\nmission. \r\n Be that as it may, let me just say that tonight is a \r\nvery important night in the history of the General \r\nAssembly. It is also a very important night in the \r\nhistory of the fight against impunity and in seeking \r\naccountability. We are not done with this exercise. \r\nTonight, congratulations go to all Members of the \r\nAssembly, because they have allowed the process set \r\nout in the Goldstone report to begin. We are preparing \r\nourselves for the High Contracting Parties to the \r\nGeneva Convention to be convened in Switzerland. In \r\nthat connection, we express particular gratitude to the \r\ndelegation of Switzerland for that country’s courage \r\nand its defence of international law, international \r\nhumanitarian law and the issue of accountability. \r\n Therefore, we will be ready for the unfolding of \r\nthat segment of the recommendations contained in the \r\nGoldstone report. We will also be ready to come back  \r\n \r\nto the General Assembly in three months’ time to \r\nconsider the report of the Secretary-General. We will \r\ndo so with a view to further action in all the relevant \r\norgans of the United Nations, including the Security \r\nCouncil. This journey of fighting impunity and seeking \r\naccountability is a long one. We are proud that the \r\nGeneral Assembly has been so responsible as to \r\ninstruct the Secretary-General to forward the Goldstone \r\nreport (A/HCR/12/48) to the Security Council, so that \r\nit will be an official document before the Council. We \r\nwill continue to knock on the door of the Security \r\nCouncil to ask it to shoulder its responsibilities. \r\n While we are investigating all the allegations \r\ncontained in the Goldstone report, we will work very \r\nclosely with the High Commissioner for Human Rights \r\nto find modalities and ways of dealing with the issue of \r\nreparations and the establishment of a compensation \r\nfund. We will come back to that issue once we have \r\nobtained all the expertise and suggestions available \r\nfrom the Office of the High Commissioner.  \r\n We will continue to work with the Red Cross, and \r\nwith appropriate bodies of the United Nations, to see \r\nhow we can address the issue of dealing with the \r\nweapons and ammunition that were used during the \r\nGaza conflict, another recommendation contained in \r\nthe Goldstone report. Once we have that expert \r\ninformation, we will come back to the issue. We have \r\ntherefore started the journey today. It is a process, and \r\nwe will continue that process until we can ensure that \r\nthe Israeli criminals who committed war crimes against \r\nPalestinian civilians are brought to justice and receive \r\nthe punishment they deserve. \r\n As for us, on the Palestinian side, we will \r\ncontinue to uphold international law. We are not afraid \r\nof international law, which is on our side. We will \r\nnever accept that there is any kind of symmetry \r\nbetween the occupiers and the victims — the \r\nPalestinian people under occupation. International law \r\nis on our side and represents the solution we have to \r\nimpose on Israel sooner or later. \r\n I would like to thank everyone in this Hall and to \r\nsay goodnight and that tomorrow will be another day. \r\n The President: The Assembly has thus concluded \r\nthis stage of its consideration of agenda item 64. \r\nThe meeting rose at 5.45 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
