(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 17 \r\n \r\nThe situation in Afghanistan \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/64/364) \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/64/L.8) \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I now give the \r\nfloor to the representative of Germany to introduce \r\ndraft resolution A/64/L.8. \r\n Mr. Ney (Germany): The international community \r\nis willing and committed to continue to support the \r\nAfghan people in their efforts to shape their own \r\ndestiny, establish sustainable peace and security, and \r\nrebuild their country despite ongoing terrorist threats. \r\nThis is the key message of General Assembly draft \r\nresolution A/64/L.8 on the situation in Afghanistan, \r\nwhich I have the honour to introduce to the Assembly \r\ntoday. \r\n The debate and adoption of the draft resolution \r\ngive us, the members of the General Assembly, the \r\ntimely opportunity to renew our clear message of \r\ninternational solidarity to the Afghan people. \r\n As Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stressed last \r\nweek, we will not be deterred by the recent despicable \r\nattacks by the Taliban targeting the international \r\ncommunity in Kabul. We pay homage to the innocent \r\npeople who lost their lives and extend our deepest \r\ncondolences to the families and friends of the victims. \r\nOur thoughts are also with all those Afghans and other \r\nnationals who have lost their lives as a result of the \r\nTaliban insurgency. \r\n Afghanistan experienced the first presidential \r\nelections run entirely under the responsibility of the \r\nAfghan authorities. The international community \r\nwitnessed with admiration the courage of the Afghan \r\npeople who cast their votes despite serious security \r\nthreats. We welcome the conclusion of the presidential \r\nelectoral process and congratulate President Karzai on \r\nhis second term in office. \r\n It is at this point that I should like to extend the \r\nsincerest thanks and profound gratitude of my \r\nGovernment to the Special Representative of the \r\nSecretary-General, Kai Eide, and his team within the \r\nUnited Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, for \r\nsupporting the Afghan institutions during the elections. \r\nI should also like to extend my thanks to the security \r\nforces in Afghanistan for their efforts to provide \r\nsecurity during the electoral process to the extent \r\npossible. The good performance of the Afghan media \r\nand the Afghan election observers also deserves praise.  \r\n As Afghanistan continues to face significant \r\nchallenges, we emphasize that President Karzai should \r\nmove swiftly to form a Government that is able to meet \r\nthe challenges. We should continue to encourage all \r\npolitical actors in Afghanistan to respect the rule of law \r\nand to continue to take responsibility for the stability \r\nand unity of Afghanistan. In this regard, Germany \r\nwelcomes President Karzai’s most recent commitment \r\nto instituting reforms and to actively fighting \r\ncorruption. We hope that effective measures, such as \r\nA/64/PV.40  \r\n \r\n09-59876 2 \r\n \r\nthe strengthening of the anti-corruption commission, \r\nwill be taken to ensure good governance and to create \r\nan enabling legal and political environment for \r\nstability, as well as economic and social development \r\nand growth through private investment in Afghanistan. \r\n The draft resolution before us is a well-balanced \r\ncall on Member States for continued cooperation with \r\nthe Afghan Government and on the new Afghan \r\nGovernment “to build a renewed relationship of trust \r\nwith its citizens by achieving concrete and visible \r\nresults” (A/64/L.8, fourth preambular paragraph). The \r\ndraft reflects the views expressed in informal \r\nconsultations. I wish to seize this opportunity to thank \r\nthe numerous delegations that participated actively in \r\nthe informal consultations for all their valuable \r\ncontributions. \r\n I should like briefly to point out four elements of \r\nthe draft resolution that have been discussed most \r\nintensively during the informal consultations. First, all \r\ndelegations underlined the importance of the protection \r\nof the civilian population. On the one hand, the draft \r\nresolution clearly stresses the fact that the Taliban, \r\nAl-Qaida and other extremist and criminal groups are \r\nresponsible for the wide majority of civilian casualties \r\nin Afghanistan and continue their despicable tactics of \r\nusing civilians as human shields. On the other hand, it \r\nalso calls on the security forces to continue their \r\nintensified efforts aimed at ensuring the protection of \r\ncivilians. This will require the continued review of \r\ntactics and procedures and the conduct of after-action \r\nreviews and investigations. \r\n Secondly, delegations felt a need to recall the \r\nimportance of upholding international obligations for \r\nthe advancement of women’s rights, as enshrined in the \r\nAfghan Constitution. \r\n Thirdly, delegations exchanged their views on the \r\nprospects of an internal political dialogue aimed at \r\nestablishing sustainable peace in Afghanistan. They \r\nagreed that the draft resolution should encourage the \r\nimplementation of reintegration, reconciliation and \r\ntransitional justice processes led by the Afghan \r\nGovernment aiming at reintegrating those who are \r\nready to renounce violence, denounce terrorism, accept \r\nthe Afghan Constitution, and commit themselves to \r\nworking constructively for peace, stability and \r\ndevelopment in the framework of the Afghan \r\nConstitution. \r\n Fourthly and finally, delegations welcomed \r\nongoing efforts by the Governments of Afghanistan \r\nand its partners in the region to foster trust and \r\ncooperation with each other. Delegations encouraged \r\nfurther initiatives to increase regional cooperation in \r\norder to promote security, stability, peace and \r\neconomic development in Afghanistan and in the \r\nregion. \r\n The second presidential election in Afghanistan \r\nmarked an important step in the democratic history of \r\nthe country. This is the time for the Afghan people and \r\nthe international community alike to take stock, look \r\nahead and assess the challenges we are facing. France, \r\nGermany and the United Kingdom have jointly \r\nproposed that the Secretary-General take the initiative \r\nto co-chair an international conference on Afghanistan \r\nin cooperation with the new Afghan Government. We \r\nappreciate the support expressed by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for this initiative, and welcome the first steps \r\ntaken by Special Representative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kai Eide in this regard. \r\n If we want to succeed, it is of crucial importance \r\nthat we jointly revisit our goals. These goals must \r\ninclude security, good governance, the rule of law and \r\nhuman rights, as well as the economic and social \r\ndevelopment of Afghanistan. We should agree on new, \r\nspecific and measurable benchmarks and timelines in \r\norder to establish a joint framework for the transition \r\nphase ahead towards increased Afghan ownership. In \r\nview of such a framework, Germany is committed to \r\ncontinuing its support to the Afghan people and to \r\ncooperating fully and constructively with the new \r\nAfghan Government. Germany is planning to further \r\nenhance its contribution to the international \r\nreconstruction efforts in Afghanistan. \r\n Germany aligns itself fully with the statement \r\nthat will be delivered by the Swedish presidency of the \r\nEuropean Union later in the debate. \r\n Finally, I would like to conclude by extending my \r\nheartfelt thanks to my colleague Ambassador Zahir \r\nTanin and his Deputy Permanent Representative, Erfani \r\nAyoob, for their trust, cooperation and friendship, \r\nwhich we have been privileged to enjoy. \r\n Mr. Tanin (Afghanistan): Thirty years ago, in \r\nDecember 1979, Soviet forces entered Afghanistan. \r\nSince then, Afghanistan has been the victim of \r\nperpetual war, violence and conflict. Constant upheaval \r\nhas torn the country from a peaceful, progressive path \r\n A/64/PV.40\r\n \r\n3 09-59876 \r\n \r\nand thrust it into the global spotlight. The General \r\nAssembly has repeatedly gathered to reiterate its \r\nsolidarity with the Afghan people. \r\n However, while we debated here, the floodgates \r\nof hell opened in Afghanistan. What was once a stable, \r\nmodernizing country and a role model for other States \r\nin the region became a name without a State, a vast \r\nwasteland of shattered lives. One hundred years of \r\nsocial, political and economic progress were destroyed. \r\nWhat is worse, 2 million people were killed and \r\n10 million more fled for their own safety. That is the \r\ntrue tragedy of my country and my people. Now, eight \r\nyears after the fall of the Taliban, eight years after we \r\nall believed that the long national nightmare of the \r\nAfghan people had at last come to an end, violence still \r\nthreatens the lives of Afghans in many parts of the \r\ncountry. \r\n The draft resolution (A/64/L.8) before us today \r\nreflects an awareness of our common responsibility to \r\naddress the situation in Afghanistan and reaffirms the \r\nstrong determination of the membership towards this \r\nend. For this support, the Government and people of \r\nAfghanistan are deeply grateful. \r\n In this regard, I would like to thank you, \r\nMr. President, for convening this meeting, and all the \r\nmembers for their presence here today and for so \r\nwidely and strongly supporting the draft resolution \r\nnow before us. Allow me to also express my sincerest \r\nthanks to the German Mission, in particular \r\nAmbassador Martin Ney, Counsellor Daniel Krull and \r\nhis able team, for their substantial efforts and able \r\nfacilitation of the draft resolution. \r\n The past eight years have been difficult, but the \r\nsituation in Afghanistan has fundamentally improved. \r\nEight years ago, we were debating how to build what \r\ndid not exist: a Government, an army and police force, \r\nand a functioning economic and social life. Today, we \r\nare debating how to improve what we have built and \r\nhow to have a good, effective Government, a well-\r\ntrained army and police and a productive economy. \r\nToday, Afghanistan’s flag flies proudly across the \r\ncountry. This is a substantial accomplishment. \r\n Unfortunately, our progress has not been \r\nsufficient. We have allowed three crucial opportunities \r\nto slip through our fingers. \r\n First, we missed the chance to wipe out the \r\nTaliban, Al-Qaida and other terrorists. After their initial \r\ndefeat, we permitted them to rearm and regroup in \r\nsanctuaries outside Afghanistan. As a result, they \r\nreturned to threaten us in 2006, and the security \r\nsituation has deteriorated markedly. \r\n Secondly, we missed the chance to properly \r\nresource and reinforce our efforts. Afghanistan has \r\nbeen starved for resources, starved for attention and \r\nstarved for troops. Our responses have been reactive, \r\nex post facto and fragmented. \r\n Thirdly, we missed the chance to rapidly \r\nempower and enable Afghans to shoulder the \r\nresponsibility for their own destiny. The Government \r\nand civil society lack capacity, experience and \r\nresources. \r\n Thankfully, within the past two years, the \r\nGovernment of Afghanistan and the international \r\ncommunity have together begun to craft a common \r\napproach. We are beginning to offer the necessary \r\nresources to combat a resurgent Taliban. We have \r\nstrengthened the important United Nations mandate for \r\ncoordination. We have begun to build capacity to \r\naddress weak governance and fragile institutions. We \r\nhave built a strengthened partnership with the elected \r\nGovernment in Islamabad, and we are working together \r\ntowards real cooperation in the fight against our \r\ncommon enemy. Finally, with the holding of the second \r\npresidential elections in our history, Afghans are again \r\nable to have a say in their future. \r\n The elections marked the beginning of a new \r\nchapter in Afghanistan. Unfortunately, the elections \r\nwere held in difficult circumstances. In many regions, \r\nvoters risked their lives to participate. Despite this, \r\nhowever, millions voted, and millions more \r\nparticipated in the debates surrounding the campaigns. \r\n Elections are not perfect anywhere. They are even \r\nless perfect in an emerging democracy threatened by \r\nconflict. The Afghan people worked tirelessly, not on \r\nthe sidelines but as leaders of our institutions. \r\nComplaints and irregularities were uncovered and \r\naddressed in a meticulously fair and systematic way. \r\nThe elections were as free as possible, as fair as \r\npossible and as transparent as possible. Most \r\nimportantly, the people of Afghanistan showed respect \r\nfor the rule of law. All of Afghanistan patiently and \r\npeacefully awaited a legal, constitutional outcome and \r\nare now prepared to accept that outcome. This has been \r\na peaceful transition. \r\nA/64/PV.40  \r\n \r\n09-59876 4 \r\n \r\n The re-election of President Karzai has ended a \r\nperiod of uncertainty and an extended pause in our \r\nreconstruction and stabilization efforts. The President-\r\nelect, in his first address, emphasized that we need to \r\nseize this unique moment. Over the next five years, the \r\nnew Government of Afghanistan will create and \r\nmaintain two compacts, one with the Afghan people \r\nand one with the international community. Together, \r\nthese pacts will help forge strong, constructive \r\npartnerships and will lead Afghanistan to sustainable \r\nprogress. \r\n The principal compact is with the people of \r\nAfghanistan and will be based on a continuing \r\ncommitment to ensuring the physical and economic \r\nsecurity of Afghans, providing good governance and \r\nensuring the rule of law, and encouraging economic \r\ndevelopment. To achieve these three aims, President-\r\nelect Karzai has identified four areas of focus: national \r\nparticipation, reconciliation, Afghanization and tackling \r\ncorruption. \r\n The need for Afghans to take control of their \r\ndestinies is central to this compact. In an ongoing \r\neffort to build capacity and wash out the stain of \r\ncorruption, Afghans should assume increasing \r\nresponsibility for governance, the rule of law and the \r\nprotection of human rights. In training the army and \r\npolice, Afghans can take on a greater role in ensuring \r\nsecurity, enforcing the law and leading counter-\r\nnarcotics efforts. \r\n The Government represents all Afghans. The \r\nGovernment serves all Afghans. We are committed to \r\ngreater national participation in the political and \r\nreconstruction processes. In addition, we will continue \r\nto welcome any Afghan who is willing to join the \r\npeace process and respect the Afghan Constitution. In \r\nundertaking these commitments, the new Government \r\nof Afghanistan will work actively and constructively \r\nwith the region and the broader international \r\ncommunity alike. \r\n In building a prosperous and democratic \r\nAfghanistan, security is at the core of all our efforts. \r\nSecurity is not only an end in itself; it is also an \r\nimportant prerequisite for progress in other areas. \r\nInsecurity is a barrier to good governance and \r\nsustainable development, and is the single biggest \r\nthreat to human rights. Insecurity prevents Afghans \r\nfrom putting aside their guns to concentrate on \r\nrebuilding their lives, and it breeds corruption, fear, \r\nhopelessness and despair. We will never earn the trust \r\nof Afghans while they are constantly subjected to \r\nterror. We must first help them feel secure. \r\n However, our aim is not to kill every Taliban \r\nfighter. We have to use political and military strategies \r\ntogether in order to expand the reach of the \r\nGovernment, train the Afghan army and police, isolate \r\nthe Taliban from the people, earn the trust of the people \r\nand encourage the engagement of Afghan civilians in \r\nthe peace and reconciliation process. \r\n The sole strength of the Taliban, Al-Qaida and \r\ntheir terrorist allies lies in their brutality. Afghanistan \r\nneeds a military and civilian strategy that centres on \r\nthe security of the Afghan people and offers them real \r\nprotection from the threats of the Taliban and the \r\nunintended consequences of counter-terrorist operations. \r\nNATO’s new strategy is a promising and responsible \r\nstep in this direction. \r\n However, the Government’s tremendous objectives \r\nwill not be achieved in one day. We will achieve \r\nnothing by setting premature deadlines. We will \r\nachieve nothing without the consistent political, \r\nmilitary and financial support of the international \r\ncommunity. Most important, we will achieve nothing \r\nwithout mutual understanding built on trust and \r\ncooperation. \r\n Recent public debate about Afghanistan has \r\nstrained this understanding. Afghanistan both respects \r\nand understands the legitimate concerns of the \r\ninternational community. We ask the world to respect \r\nand understand the views and concerns of Afghans. All \r\nstakeholders deserve sincere, credible partners. We \r\nneed a partnership built on real solidarity.  \r\n For this reason, the Government of Afghanistan \r\nwill focus on building and renewing a second \r\ncompact — a compact with the international community. \r\nThis compact should rest on the strong foundation of \r\nour shared commitment to pursuing security, \r\ndevelopment and good governance in Afghanistan and \r\nthe region. Together, we should seek rational and well-\r\nresourced common strategies with realistic timelines. \r\nIn this regard, we welcome the call for an international \r\nconference to refresh and renew our partnership and \r\nbuild a solid foundation for our future work together. \r\nThe recent attack on the dedicated United Nations \r\nworkers in Kabul shows that our partnership is under \r\nattack from the outside. We must strengthen it from the \r\ninside. \r\n A/64/PV.40\r\n \r\n5 09-59876 \r\n \r\n The key to the future of Afghanistan is in the \r\nhands of the Afghan people. They are the masters of \r\ntheir destiny. The Taliban do not represent Afghans. \r\nTheir power is the power of destruction. Their strength \r\nlies only in brutality. Let us make a strong relationship \r\nbetween the Afghan people and the international \r\ncommunity the bedrock of our strategies. Let us use \r\ntoday’s draft resolution on Afghanistan to demand \r\nmore from ourselves and our partners alike. Alone, we \r\nwill fail, but together we can and will succeed. \r\n Mr. Lidén (Sweden): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of the European Union (EU). Croatia, the \r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Albania, \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Serbia, Iceland, \r\nUkraine, the Republic of Moldova and Armenia align \r\nthemselves with this statement. \r\n The European Union welcomes the conclusion of \r\nthe presidential electoral process and congratulates \r\nPresident Hamid Karzai on winning a second term in \r\noffice. This autumn, we have seen important \r\ndevelopments in Afghanistan. The first elections to be \r\norganized by the Afghan authorities in several decades \r\ntook place. The European Union has supported these \r\nelections and the Afghan institutions responsible for \r\nconducting them throughout the process and will \r\ncontinue to do so. \r\n Lessons should be learned from this round of \r\nelections. The European Union stands ready to assist \r\nAfghanistan in reviewing and improving the electoral \r\nsystem, especially in view of the elections to be held \r\nnext year, while we also note that addressing some of \r\nthe issues related to the electoral system will require \r\nattention in the longer term as well. \r\n On 27 October, the European Union took an \r\nimportant decision in adopting a plan for strengthened \r\nEU action in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The plan \r\nreflects the strategic importance that the European \r\nUnion attaches to the region. The EU will increase its \r\nefforts strategically, politically and financially, as well \r\nas through the contribution of technical assistance, in \r\norder to help move developments in a positive \r\ndirection. \r\n The European Union expects that a credible and \r\ncompetent Government that addresses the major \r\nchallenges facing the country will be formed without \r\ndelay and that it will promote national unity in order to \r\nregain legitimacy in the eyes of the Afghan people. The \r\nEuropean Union is ready to engage early and \r\nsubstantially with such a Government, on the basis of \r\nthe European Union’s plan of action. \r\n The debate on the annual resolution on the \r\nsituation in Afghanistan is an opportunity for the \r\ninternational community to reaffirm its support for the \r\nAfghan people and its path towards peace, security and \r\ndemocracy. We thank Germany for its initiative again \r\nthis year and for having managed this draft resolution \r\nso well. The end result reflects both the progress that \r\nhas been achieved and the challenges remaining in \r\nAfghanistan, as well as the international community’s \r\nunanimous support for the Afghan Government’s \r\nefforts to consolidate a stable and democratic country. \r\n The European Union expresses its continued \r\nstrong support for the Secretary-General, his Special \r\nRepresentative and all United Nations personnel for \r\ntheir important work in assisting Afghanistan despite \r\nthe tragic loss of life during the suicide attack on \r\nUnited Nations personnel in Kabul on 28 October. \r\n The European Union salutes half a century of \r\nUnited Nations commitment to Afghanistan and hopes \r\nthat it will be possible, following its security review, \r\nfor the United Nations presence there to return to full \r\nstrength. The European Union understands the difficult \r\nsecurity situation under which the United Nations \r\noperates in Afghanistan, supports the need to ensure \r\nthe safety of United Nations staff accordingly, and \r\nlooks forward to further discussions on proposals from \r\nthe Secretary-General in that regard. \r\n Following the completion of the elections and \r\nwith a new Government in place, the EU looks forward \r\nto the Government of Afghanistan’s rapidly addressing \r\nthe challenges facing the nation by developing a \r\nreform agenda with concrete commitments to the \r\nAfghan people. Such an agenda should include \r\nimproving governance and fighting corruption, as well \r\nas addressing security and improving the rule of law. \r\n The European Union also looks forward to the \r\ninternational conference, which will offer an \r\nopportunity for the new Afghan Government to lay out \r\nits priorities, plans and commitments. The United \r\nNations should have a prominent role in that \r\nconference. For the international community, it will be \r\nan occasion to review and reaffirm its engagement in \r\nAfghanistan. Jointly, we should agree on new goals, \r\nbenchmarks and timelines in order to formulate a joint \r\nframework for our work towards the common goal of \r\nan Afghanistan living in peace and security. \r\nA/64/PV.40  \r\n \r\n09-59876 6 \r\n \r\n The European Union member States are deeply \r\ninvolved in Afghanistan, and the EU is a key \r\ncontributor to its reconstruction. The EU and its \r\nmember States are spending nearly €1 billion a year on \r\ncivilian efforts in Afghanistan. The troop contribution \r\nof EU member States to the United Nations-mandated \r\nInternational Security Assistance Force amounts to \r\napproximately 30,000, which is the heaviest EU \r\nmilitary engagement in a long time. \r\n The focus of the international presence in \r\nAfghanistan is on safeguarding a stable security \r\nenvironment to make development possible. Maintaining \r\nsecurity is currently a responsibility shared between the \r\nAfghan national security forces and the international \r\ncommunity. Ultimately, our highest priority should be \r\nto enable the Afghan national security forces to carry \r\nout that responsibility on their own. The European \r\nUnion concurs, needless to say, with the view that \r\neverything possible should be done to avoid civilian \r\ncasualties. \r\n Building Afghan capacity and strengthening \r\nnational ownership in the civilian sectors remain at the \r\ncore of the European Union’s engagement in \r\nAfghanistan. The EU will increase its support, for \r\nexample, in the areas of good governance, the rule of \r\nlaw, including justice, and the fight against corruption. \r\nWe urge the next Government of Afghanistan to give \r\npriority to the achievement of progress in those areas, \r\nnot least at the subnational level. Further, we \r\nunderscore the need for concrete improvements in the \r\nprotection of human rights, including the rights of \r\nwomen, and stand ready to support a new Government \r\nin that regard. \r\n The framework for political, social and economic \r\ndevelopment in Afghanistan is the Afghanistan \r\nCompact, the Afghan National Development Strategy \r\nand the principles agreed at the Paris and Hague \r\nConferences on Afghanistan. The European Union will \r\nfurther enhance and improve its contributions to \r\nAfghanistan’s reconstruction and development through \r\na common approach, as well as bilaterally through \r\nindividual member States. \r\n Without doubt, stability, security and development \r\nin Afghanistan are closely linked to the overall \r\nsituation in that region. The EU strongly supports the \r\ndevelopment of a coordinated approach at the regional \r\nlevel and enhanced cooperation between Afghanistan \r\nand its neighbours, especially Pakistan. The EU \r\nparticularly acknowledges Pakistan’s key role for \r\nstability in the region. We welcome the progress that \r\nhas been achieved in the bilateral dialogue between \r\nAfghanistan and Pakistan.  \r\n The European Union will concentrate its efforts \r\non strengthening State capacity and institutions to \r\npromote good governance, human rights and efficient \r\npublic administration, especially at the subnational \r\nlevel. The EU will focus on strengthening the rule of \r\nlaw by assisting in the building of a civilian police \r\nforce through the European Union Police Mission in \r\nAfghanistan. We will also support economic growth, \r\nespecially through rural development and improved \r\nregional cooperation. The EU strongly supports the \r\nUnited Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan \r\n(UNAMA) in its important role as coordinator of \r\ninternational efforts. We recognize the responsibility of \r\nmember States to assist UNAMA in performing that \r\ntask. Additional UNAMA provincial offices are a \r\nwelcome contribution. \r\n The EU reiterates that the primary responsibility \r\nfor the development of the country lies with the Afghan \r\nGovernment and the people themselves. I would like to \r\nassure the Assembly that the European Union will \r\ncontinue to play an active role in assisting Afghanistan \r\non its road to security, stability and prosperity in close \r\ncooperation and coordination with UNAMA and other \r\ninternational actors. \r\n Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): I have the honour to speak on behalf of the \r\nStates members of the Collective Security Treaty \r\nOrganization (CSTO) — the Republic of Armenia, the \r\nRepublic of Belarus, the Republic of Kazakhstan, the \r\nKyrgyz Republic, the Russian Federation and the \r\nRepublic of Tajikistan. \r\n In recent years, the authorities of Afghanistan \r\nhave managed to achieve definite progress in State-\r\nbuilding and the strengthening of democratic \r\ninstitutions. The presidential and local elections held in \r\nAfghanistan serve as a vivid example of that. We \r\nexpect a new effective Government to be formed soon. \r\n Referring to the recent attack on the United \r\nNations mission in Kabul, we decisively condemn the \r\nactions of terrorists and call on the Government of \r\nAfghanistan to guarantee an appropriate level of \r\nsecurity both to the United Nations mission in \r\nAfghanistan and to all foreign missions accredited in \r\nthat country. \r\n A/64/PV.40\r\n \r\n7 09-59876 \r\n \r\n The new Afghan authorities will encounter \r\nunprecedented challenges. The Taliban’s position is \r\nstronger than ever since they were toppled. Al-Qaida \r\nremains very active. Much remains to be done in the \r\nfield of socio-economic rehabilitation. The security \r\nsituation is still of key importance to the further \r\nreconstruction and development of Afghanistan. \r\n In that respect, neither the Afghan authorities nor \r\nthe international community can abandon their efforts \r\nto isolate extremist leaders, especially those on the \r\nsanctions list of the Security Council Committee \r\nestablished pursuant to resolution 1267 (1999). An \r\nopportunity to return to normal political life should be \r\noffered only to those who renounce violence, armed \r\ncombat and their ties with Al-Qaida and the Taliban \r\nmovement and recognize the Constitution and the \r\nlegitimate Government of Afghanistan. All talks should \r\nbe held only by the legitimate authorities of Afghanistan. \r\n Our countries pay the utmost attention to fighting \r\ndrug trafficking, which is a source of financing \r\nterrorist activity. Unfortunately, we must acknowledge \r\nthat international endeavours to fight the illicit \r\nproduction and distribution of narcotics from the \r\nterritory of Afghanistan have yet to prove effective. \r\nThe international military presence in Afghanistan \r\npossesses all the tools necessary for a more efficient \r\nstruggle against that evil. We support more \r\ncomprehensive international cooperation to ensure the \r\nfull implementation of Security Council resolution \r\n1735 (2006), including with regard to those who use \r\nresources gained from the production of illicit drugs \r\nand precursors to finance terrorist groups. Security \r\nCouncil resolution 1817 (2008), intended to impose \r\ninternational control over the circulation of precursors, \r\nremains relevant. \r\n We encourage the Government of Afghanistan to \r\nstrengthen cooperation with the CSTO on countering \r\nthe illicit production and trafficking of drugs. We are \r\nconvinced that only through the Afghan Government’s \r\nfull involvement in the fight against that evil can \r\nsubstantial improvements be made in reducing the \r\nglobal level of opiate production. We believe it \r\nnecessary to significantly strengthen anti-narcotic \r\nefforts both in the territory of Afghanistan and around it \r\nby creating belts of anti-narcotic and financial security \r\nwith the participation of neighbouring countries. \r\n The CSTO possesses vast experience in \r\ncountering the illicit circulation of drugs on the Afghan \r\ntrack. One of the most successful and effective formats \r\nof the CSTO countries’ practical cooperation to curb \r\nthe interregional and international supply of drugs is \r\nOperation Channel, which has had the status of a \r\npermanent regional CSTO anti-narcotics operation \r\nsince September 2008. \r\n Every year the number of countries participating \r\nin Operation Channel expands. In accordance with the \r\ndecision of CSTO heads of State, the first stage of \r\nChannel 2009, a complex operational and prevention \r\noperation, was completed between 22 and 28 September. \r\nParticipants included drug enforcement agencies of the \r\nCSTO member States; authorized representatives of \r\nlaw-enforcement bodies from Azerbaijan, Afghanistan, \r\nBulgaria, Venezuela, Germany, Iran, China, Latvia, \r\nLithuania, Poland, the United States, Turkey, Ukraine \r\nand Estonia; and financial investigation operatives \r\nfrom States members of the Eurasian Group on \r\nCombating Money Laundering and Financing of \r\nTerrorism. Representatives of law-enforcement bodies \r\nfrom Bulgaria, Germany, Venezuela and Turkey \r\nparticipated in the endeavour for the first time. \r\n The participants were tasked with several \r\nobjectives, chief of which were blocking illicit \r\ntrafficking channels into Eurasian countries for opiates \r\nfrom Afghanistan, synthetic drugs from Europe and \r\ncocaine from Latin America, and preventing illicit \r\nsupplies of precursors to the Central Asian republics \r\nand Afghanistan, as well as confiscating illegal arms, \r\nammunition and explosive materials, and preventing \r\nthe laundering of drug money. The operation involved \r\n139,000 officers of drug enforcement agencies, \r\nsecurity forces, law enforcement agencies, police \r\nforces and border services. More than 9,000 joint rapid \r\nresponse groups and 7,000 fixed stations were created \r\nin border regions at rail, air and road transportation \r\nfacilities. More than 2,000 rail junctions and stations, \r\n725 airports and almost 4,500 roads were closed off. \r\n Operations were conducted in regions directly \r\nadjacent to Afghanistan. This permitted the interception \r\nof large, wholesale shipments of drugs. Based on a \r\npreviously tested scheme of interaction and information \r\nexchange between the operational department of the \r\ninternational coordination headquarters and the Russian \r\nFinancial Monitoring Service, an examination of \r\nfinancial operations suspected of being connected to \r\nillicit drug trafficking activity was organized. In the \r\ncourse of the operation more than 30 tons of \r\npsychotropic, narcotic and other hard drugs were seized. \r\nA/64/PV.40  \r\n \r\n09-59876 8 \r\n \r\nMore than 6,000 charges for crimes pertaining to illicit \r\ndrug trafficking were made, more than 26,000 criminal \r\ncases initiated and 5,400 people were tried for crimes \r\ninvolving illicit drug deals; 531 of those individuals \r\nwere members of criminal organizations. Approximately \r\n849 firearms and more than 34,000 items of ammunition \r\nwere confiscated. \r\n The strengthening of the anti-drug zones should \r\nbe supplemented by creating financial security cordons \r\naround Afghanistan. This means not only intercepting \r\ndrug shipments but also imposing stronger controls on \r\nthe transnational movement of income from drug \r\ntrafficking, money-laundering and other criminal \r\nactivities, including financing terrorism. \r\n This year the CSTO member States took an active \r\npart in a number of significant international forums on \r\nthe question of Afghanistan, including the Special \r\nConference on Afghanistan held in Moscow under the \r\nauspices of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. \r\nThe CSTO strongly believes that effectively resolving \r\nthe situation in Afghanistan and addressing the serious \r\nissues on the Afghan Government’s agenda are \r\nunattainable without an integrated approach on the part \r\nof the international community, under the auspices of \r\nthe United Nations. Such efforts, though, will not yield \r\nthe benefits hoped for without delegating more \r\nindependence to Kabul in solving Afghanistan’s \r\ninternal problems, above all by creating the conditions \r\nthat will enable the Afghan Government to be self-\r\nsufficient in providing national security. \r\n Mrs. Juul (Norway): Eight years have passed \r\nsince the Taliban were defeated and the reconstruction \r\nof Afghanistan began. There have been positive \r\ndevelopments, particularly in the socio-economic field. \r\nBut many Afghans are becoming impatient and say that \r\ntoo little is happening, too late. The deteriorating \r\nsecurity situation is a cause of suffering for the \r\npopulation and grave concern in the international \r\ncommunity. It is therefore necessary to ask how we and \r\nthe Afghan Government should prioritize, and where \r\nwe can improve our performance. The United Nations \r\nAssistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) plays a \r\nkey role in finding constructive answers to these \r\nquestions. \r\n Against this backdrop, Norway looks forward to \r\nthe unanimous adoption by the General Assembly of \r\ndraft resolution A/64/L.8, on the situation in \r\nAfghanistan. The broad support for this draft resolution \r\namong all States Members of the United Nations sends \r\nan important message: the international community has \r\na common wish for improved security, political \r\nstability and development for the people of Afghanistan. \r\n Following the fatal attack on United Nations staff \r\nin Kabul on 28 October, it is imperative that we \r\nexpress our strongest support for the Organization in \r\nAfghanistan. We welcome the recent efforts of the \r\nSecretary-General to ensure protection of his own \r\nUnited Nations staff. Norway is committed to assisting \r\nthe United Nations so that it can continue its \r\nindispensable work in a safe manner. The attack was a \r\nbrutal reminder that our common goal — security and \r\nstability in Afghanistan — is still a long way off. It also \r\nshows how crucial it is that the efforts of the United \r\nNations, NATO and a united international community \r\nin Afghanistan be predictable and have a long-term \r\nperspective. It is deeply tragic that the United Nations, \r\nwhose mandate includes working for peace, stability \r\nand improved coordination, has been hit so hard. \r\n We are very pleased that the key role played by \r\nUNAMA in Afghanistan is reflected in the significant \r\nincrease in the Mission’s budget for 2010. Only with a \r\nsufficient level of predictable funding will UNAMA be \r\nable to implement its mandate effectively. We should \r\nnot expect more from the United Nations than we are \r\nwilling to invest in it. \r\n The Afghan presidential election and its \r\naftermath this year illustrated clearly how challenging \r\nconducting elections in conflict-affected areas can be. \r\nFollowing a lengthy and difficult election process, \r\nPresident Karzai will be inaugurated as Afghanistan’s \r\nnext President on 19 November, and soon thereafter a \r\nnew Afghan Government will be formed. With the \r\nelection concluded, the new Afghan Government has to \r\ndemonstrate a genuine interest in fulfilling basic and \r\ncrucial commitments to the Afghan people and the \r\ninternational community. If not, the new Administration \r\nrisks losing support. The legitimacy of the next Karzai \r\nGovernment will be decided by the actions they take in \r\nthe near future and judged by the Afghan people. \r\n It is not only the people of Afghanistan but also \r\nthe international community that is formulating \r\nexpectations and demands. President Karzai and the \r\nnew Afghan Government will have to commit \r\nthemselves on a larger scale and take all necessary \r\nmeasures to combat corruption and the culture of \r\nimpunity; improve governance, particularly at local \r\n A/64/PV.40\r\n \r\n9 09-59876 \r\n \r\nlevels and including strengthening the rule of law; \r\nprotect human rights and women’s rights; improve the \r\nsecurity situation; and increase their capacity to deliver \r\nbasic services to the Afghan people. As members of the \r\ninternational community, we must stand ready to assist \r\nthe next Afghan Government in meeting these \r\ndemanding commitments to the people of Afghanistan. \r\n Mr. Sial (Pakistan): Pakistan’s delegation wishes \r\nto thank you, Mr. President, for convening this \r\nmeeting, as it provides a timely opportunity for \r\nMember States to review progress towards the \r\nrealization of our shared objectives of peace, stability \r\nand development in Afghanistan. We have a vital stake \r\nin achieving this objective. \r\n Pakistan has inseparable bonds of geography, \r\nhistory, faith and culture with Afghanistan, bonds that \r\nlink the destinies of our two nations. No other country \r\nhas suffered more than Pakistan from the consequences \r\nof the conflict and the human tragedy in Afghanistan. It \r\nhas impacted our social and economic fabric, disturbed \r\nthe peace and tranquillity of our border regions and \r\ngiven rise to the common threat of extremism and \r\nterrorism. The people of Pakistan have shared the \r\nsorrows of their Afghan brethrens. Therefore, we see \r\nour own prosperity reflected in the prosperity of \r\nAfghanistan. \r\n Our vision of common strategic and economic \r\ninterests positions Pakistan and Afghanistan to play \r\ntheir rightful role as partners forming the hub for the \r\nshortest and the most economical corridors for trade in \r\nraw materials, goods and energy among Central Asia, \r\nSouth and West Asia and beyond. We feel that our \r\neconomic and trade potential will remain untapped \r\nunless Afghanistan is peaceful and stable and that \r\nvision reinforces our efforts and commitment to peace \r\nand stability in Afghanistan. \r\n Pakistan is of the view that peace and economic \r\ndevelopment in Afghanistan can only be brought about \r\nby a stable Government enjoying majority support of \r\nthe Afghan people. In this context, Pakistan greatly \r\nvalues the recent presidential and provincial council \r\nelections held in Afghanistan. These elections show the \r\ncommitment of the Afghan people to democracy and \r\nthe rule of law. We have welcomed the outcomes of \r\nthese elections. The Government and people of \r\nPakistan remain committed to further cementing our \r\nclose, fraternal and cooperative ties with the new \r\nAfghan Administration under President Hamid Karzai. \r\n The cooperation between Pakistan and Afghanistan \r\nspans the entire spectrum of political, economic and \r\ncultural relations. There is continuous dialogue and \r\nregular exchange of visits at the highest levels. Early \r\nthis year, our two countries signed the landmark Joint \r\nDeclaration on Directions of Bilateral Cooperation, \r\nwhich has turned a new page in our bilateral relations. \r\nThis Declaration is a road map for our bilateral \r\nrelations leading to a bright and promising future. It is \r\nalso a manifestation of the aspirations of our two \r\npeoples for a peaceful, prosperous and better tomorrow. \r\n In May this year, Pakistan hosted the third \r\nRegional Economic Cooperation Conference on \r\nAfghanistan. The event was attended by 24 countries \r\nand 18 regional and international organizations, \r\ninstitutions and bodies. The Conference crystallized a \r\nregional consensus on key transregional cooperation \r\nprojects in the fields of mining, health, energy, \r\ninfrastructure development, transit, trade, labour and \r\nhuman resource development. We are closely following \r\nup on these projects and hope that our efforts will \r\nprove to be a milestone in assisting Afghanistan in its \r\ndevelopmental efforts. Despite our own financial \r\nconstraints, we are participating significantly in \r\nAfghanistan’s economic development and reconstruction. \r\nOur assistance package for Afghanistan is the biggest \r\ncooperation programme Pakistan has with any other \r\ncountry. \r\n We are also looking forward to closely working \r\nwith the new Afghan Government on key bilateral \r\nprojects that have been identified earlier, including the \r\nrail link from Chaman to Kandahar, the Central Asia-\r\nSouth Asia Regional Energy Cooperation project or \r\nCASA 1000, the Hairatan-Mazar-e-Sharif rail link and \r\nestablishment of a customs academy in Kabul. \r\n We are also engaged in security and intelligence \r\ncooperation, including through the Tripartite \r\nCommission, which includes the United States and the \r\nInternational Security Assistance Force (ISAF). This \r\ncooperation is essential in order to cement our gains in \r\nthe campaign against terrorism and extremism. We \r\nhave made enormous sacrifices, more than any other \r\ncountry, in this campaign. \r\n In order to interdict illegal cross-border \r\nmovement, which is a joint responsibility, Pakistan has \r\nestablished 1,000 border posts. More than 100,000 \r\ntroops are deployed on our side of the border with \r\nAfghanistan, at considerable cost. We rightfully expect \r\nA/64/PV.40  \r\n \r\n09-59876 10 \r\n \r\nAfghanistan and NATO/ISAF to reciprocate with \r\nrobust deployment and patrolling on their side, with a \r\nview to checking all illegal activities including \r\nterrorism, drug trafficking and commercial smuggling. \r\n Afghan infants born in refugee camps in Pakistan \r\nduring the time of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan \r\nhave now grown and become fathers. For the past three \r\ndecades, Pakistan has housed over 3 million Afghan \r\nrefugees and, despite isolated short spells of voluntary \r\nreturn, Pakistan still hosts nearly 2 million. Nobody \r\nshould underestimate the resulting enormous social, \r\neconomic and security costs already paid by the people \r\nof Pakistan and the outstanding challenges we still face.  \r\n The Tripartite Agreement of August 2007 \r\nbetween Pakistan, Afghanistan and the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees contains a framework \r\non reintegration, and Pakistan remains committed to \r\nthe voluntary, gradual, safe and dignified return of all \r\nAfghan refugees. However, we stress the need to \r\nstrengthen reintegration programmes for refugees \r\nwithin Afghanistan’s development strategy. Greater \r\nsustained and diligent efforts to create the necessary \r\npull-factors in Afghanistan are needed so that refugees \r\nfeel that they can return to their country with dignity \r\nand honour. We expect the United Nations and the \r\ninternational community to assist in this endeavour \r\nwith all necessary resources. \r\n The latest report of the Secretary-General on \r\nAfghanistan (A/64/364) underscores that insecurity, \r\ndriven by politically motivated insurgency and \r\nexploited by criminals and drug traffickers, is the \r\ngreatest factor impeding progress in Afghanistan. The \r\nreport notes the spread of this menace to the north-east \r\nand north-west of the country. The insurgency needs to \r\nbe eliminated as a priority matter and without seeking \r\nto externalize the problem. This is a complex and \r\ninterconnected challenge that requires a corresponding \r\nintegrated, coherent and coordinated response. Its \r\nobjective analysis and proper understanding is required \r\nto formulate an effective response. \r\n The core of violence and conflict in Afghanistan \r\nemanates from terrorist groups, foreign militants such \r\nas Al-Qaida, and militant Taliban who are not prepared \r\nto reconcile and give up the path of violence. Their \r\nnexus with drug traders is increasingly discernable. \r\nThese elements must be confronted head on. However, \r\ncoercion needs to be supplemented by a comprehensive \r\napproach that addresses the political and economic \r\naspects in parallel. Although reliance on international \r\nsupport is vital, especially for development needs, such \r\nefforts must have strong ownership from the Afghan \r\nGovernment.  \r\n We agree with the conclusion drawn by the \r\nSecretary-General that the key to long-term stability in \r\nAfghanistan is capacity-building of the country’s \r\nsecurity institutions: the Afghan National Army, the \r\nAfghan National Police and the relevant ministries. \r\nEqually important is building the civilian institutions at \r\nboth the central and subnational levels. Good \r\ngovernance and the rule of law are required to counter \r\nthe problems of neglect, exclusion and interference, \r\nwhich are common causes of grievances. \r\n We are happy to note the improvement in several \r\neconomic and social indicators in Afghanistan. The \r\nreport of the Secretary-General notes the increasing \r\neffectiveness of the Afghan Government in implementing \r\nits developmental agenda and seeking donor alignment \r\nin its agricultural initiatives. Most of these gains will \r\nbe short-lived if they are not backed by a surge in \r\ninvestment in development programmes. \r\n The world needs to recognize that most of the \r\ngrowth and innovation of the past few decades in the \r\nglobal corporate sector has eluded Afghanistan. As \r\nsuch, Afghanistan remains isolated from the global \r\neconomy. It is therefore time to re-establish these \r\nlinkages. To that end, the key would be the engagement \r\nof multinational corporations and large enterprises in \r\nproject development in Afghanistan, particularly in \r\nmining, agriculture and infrastructure. The \r\ninternational community, particularly the developed \r\ncountries, should leverage their potential behind such \r\nefforts. The economic and political dividends of such \r\ninitiatives could be enormous not only for the people of \r\nAfghanistan, but for rest of the world as well. \r\n Pakistan greatly values the role of the United \r\nNations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan. The United \r\nNations has an important role to play in coordinating \r\nthe comprehensive international effort in Afghanistan. \r\nPakistan would welcome the enhancement of this role \r\nin the political and security fields. We strongly \r\ncondemn terrorist attacks on United Nations and \r\nAfghan security personnel and reiterate our support for \r\nthe Secretary-General in his endeavours to enhance \r\nsecurity for United Nations personnel. \r\n We take this opportunity to thank the delegation \r\nof Germany for leading the process of consultations on \r\n A/64/PV.40\r\n \r\n11 09-59876 \r\n \r\nthe draft resolution (A/64/L.8). We believe that the text \r\naddresses all the relevant issues in a comprehensive \r\nand balanced manner. We are happy to co-sponsor the \r\ndraft resolution and urge all Member States to adopt it \r\nby consensus. \r\n Mr. Askarov (Uzbekistan): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the Republic of Uzbekistan in its \r\ncapacity as the Chair of the Shanghai Cooperation \r\nOrganization (SCO). \r\n Unfortunately, the situation in Afghanistan \r\ncontinues to be defined by the aggravation and \r\nescalation of confrontation and the intensification of \r\nterrorist actions by militants. Confrontation in \r\nAfghanistan remains today one of the main sources of \r\nconcern for the international community and a serious \r\nsecurity threat to Central Asia. \r\n Uzbekistan, as a close neighbour of Afghanistan, \r\nclearly recognizes that the achievement of peace and \r\nstability in that country is a key security factor and \r\nwould open great possibilities for solving the critical \r\nproblems of sustainable social and economic \r\ndevelopment of the whole Central Asian region. \r\n There is deep concern about drug production and \r\ntrafficking because, despite the decrease in narco-crops \r\nand some reduction in the volume of drug production, \r\nit is still too early to draw conclusions about possible \r\nsuccess in this field. We need to take into consideration \r\nthe fact that drug trafficking has become one of the \r\nmajor sources of financing for militants and the \r\ndestabilization of the situation not only in Afghanistan, \r\nbut also in neighbouring States. \r\n The dynamics of the development of the situation \r\nin Afghanistan highlights the increasing evidence that \r\nthe Afghan problem cannot be solved only by armed \r\nforces, using only military means, or by further \r\nmilitarization. \r\n We acknowledge the measures undertaken by the \r\nInternational Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in \r\nAfghanistan. In this context, it is important that \r\nresolution 1890 (2009), recently adopted by the \r\nSecurity Council, directs ISAF to comply with \r\ninternational humanitarian law and human rights law \r\nand for all appropriate measures to be taken to ensure \r\nthe protection of civilians. \r\n It is extremely important to fully respect the deep \r\nhistorical and ethno-demographic roots of the \r\nmulti-ethnic people of Afghanistan and their traditional \r\nand religious values. Special attention should be given \r\nto solving such acute problems such as the \r\nrehabilitation of the economy and social infrastructure \r\nin Afghanistan, destroyed by more than 30 years of war.  \r\n Uzbekistan is undertaking significant efforts to \r\nassist Afghanistan. Our country has built 11 bridges \r\nalong the Mazari-Sharif-Kabul highway, which is \r\ncrucial to ensuring unhampered communication \r\nbetween the North and South of the country. At the \r\nstart of 2002, we restored Afghanistan’s electrical \r\nsupply and, in 2008, Uzbekistan completed the \r\nconstruction of the high-powered Khairaton-Puli-\r\nKhumri-Kabul electrical line, thanks to which the \r\nAfghan capital receives 100 per cent of the electricity \r\nit requires. \r\n The problem of the development of transport \r\ninfrastructure and its inclusion in international \r\ntransport and communication projects requires very \r\nurgent attention. As members know, the only railway in \r\nAfghanistan goes through the Uzbek city of Termiz and \r\nends in the city of Khairaton. The Asian Development \r\nBank has prepared a project that stipulates the \r\nextension of the railway to the city of Mazari Sharif, \r\nand Uzbek companies are currently active on this \r\nproject. This project seeks to integrate Afghanistan’s \r\ntransport infrastructure not only into the Central Asian \r\nand trans-Caucasian transport-communication systems, \r\nbut also into the Navoi-Turkmenbashi-Baku-Kars route, \r\nallowing it to reach the markets of Europe and the \r\nTurkish seaport of Mersin, which would provide access \r\nto North Africa and the Middle East. The project’s \r\nimplementation would assist rapid development of \r\nmutual trade and increased investment activity in the \r\nregion. \r\n Uzbekistan believes that a peaceful settlement of \r\nthe situation in Afghanistan is unachievable without \r\nbringing Afghans into the process. We are confident \r\nthat, without promoting national reconciliation and \r\nconsent and strengthening the State hierarchy, it would \r\nbe impossible to significantly improve and radically \r\nchange the situation in the country. \r\n In this connection, forming effective international \r\nmechanisms of multilateral cooperation capable of \r\nconsolidating stabilization efforts and involving \r\nneighbouring countries, all interested States and \r\ninternational organizations will be crucial in many \r\nways to finding a solution to the acute problems of \r\nAfghanistan. \r\nA/64/PV.40  \r\n \r\n09-59876 12 \r\n \r\n The settlement of the Afghan problem could be \r\nfacilitated by the creation, under United Nations \r\nauspices, of a “6+3” contact group, with the participation \r\nof plenipotentiary representatives of Afghanistan’s \r\nneighbouring States plus Russia, the United States and \r\nNATO. The President of the Republic of Uzbekistan, \r\nIslam Karimov, has repeatedly emphasized that the \r\nimplementation of such an initiative involving \r\nneighbouring countries would allow for the achievement \r\nof an accord both in and around Afghanistan. \r\n Important steps in this direction have already \r\nbeen undertaken by the Shanghai Cooperation \r\nOrganization. It is particularly necessary to highlight \r\nthe outcome of the special conference held under the \r\nauspices of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in \r\nMoscow on 27 March, as well as the cooperation \r\nbetween the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and \r\nAfghanistan, which is being carried out under the \r\nprotocol signed by the organization and the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Afghanistan on the establishment of the \r\nSCO-Afghanistan Contact Group in 2005 in Beijing.  \r\n In this context, Uzbekistan supports the General \r\nAssembly’s draft resolution on Afghanistan (A/64/L.8), \r\nprepared by a large group of sponsors. We expect that \r\nthe adoption of this document by consensus will \r\ncontribute to the consolidation of international efforts \r\nin Afghanistan. \r\n Mr. Towpik (Poland): Poland aligns itself with \r\nthe statement on the situation in Afghanistan made \r\nduring our debate by the representative of Sweden on \r\nbehalf of the European Union. I would like to make a \r\nfew additional comments on this vital issue in my \r\nnational capacity. \r\n The annual debate on the situation in Afghanistan \r\nis the best opportunity to underline the role that the \r\nUnited Nations plays in the process of the stabilization \r\nand reconstruction of that country. Poland welcomes \r\nthe draft resolution introduced by the representative of \r\nGermany (A/64/L.8). The coordinating role of the \r\nUnited Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan and \r\nthe activities undertaken by Special Representative Kai \r\nEide enjoy our full support and respect.  \r\n In that context, I would like to pay tribute to the \r\nmembers of the United Nations Mission in Afghanistan \r\nwho were killed and injured during the recent terrorist \r\nattack against United Nations personnel in Kabul in \r\nOctober. I convey my sincere condolences to the \r\nfamilies of the victims, the Secretary-General, United \r\nNations staff and the people and the Government of \r\nAfghanistan. My Government reiterates its determination \r\nto combat all forms of terrorism and strongly \r\ncondemns all acts of terror, especially those directed \r\nagainst those who work for the country’s stability and \r\nsecurity. I would like to underline my Government’s \r\nfull support for the Secretary-General’s recent initiative \r\nto enhance the security of United Nations staff. \r\n The year that has passed since our last debate on \r\nAfghanistan in this Hall has been one of significant \r\nefforts and important positive and negative developments \r\nin that country. Poland shares the assessment of the \r\nSecretary-General and endorses the recommendations \r\ncontained in his most recent report on the situation in \r\nAfghanistan (A/64/364). We welcome the benchmarks \r\nand indicators of progress annexed to it, which can be a \r\nuseful tool for measuring the progress achieved. We \r\nhope that this new instrument will contribute to better \r\ncoordination and increase the effectiveness of our joint \r\nefforts. \r\n We are closely following the process of \r\npresidential and provincial council elections, which are \r\nwithout a doubt important milestones in the processes \r\nof stabilization and State-building. Despite all the \r\nproblems, the holding of elections in very difficult, \r\ncomplex and dangerous circumstances, the participation \r\nof young people, and public engagement in the election \r\ncampaign provide us with grounds for cautious \r\noptimism. We deplore the numerous electoral \r\nirregularities and fraud, but at the same time we \r\ncommend the Electoral Complaints Commission and \r\nthe Independent Election Commission for their work in \r\nidentifying, investigating and ruling on those frauds \r\nand irregularities. The time factor is critical. Poland \r\nlooks forward to the rapid formation of a new Afghan \r\nGovernment based on a broad political platform, as \r\nwell as the establishment of a new contract between the \r\nGovernment and the people of Afghanistan. \r\n Poland regrets the current increase in the number \r\nof violent incidents, compared to previous years. We \r\nnote that the security situation in the southern and \r\neastern parts of the country is still more complex and \r\nmore difficult than in other regions. However, the \r\ndecrease in security is visible throughout the country. \r\nIn that regard, we deeply regret any civilian casualty. \r\nAt the same time, it must be stressed, as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report states, that the Taliban and other anti-\r\nGovernment elements are responsible for almost three \r\nquarters of civilian deaths. We fully agree with the \r\n A/64/PV.40\r\n \r\n13 09-59876 \r\n \r\ndeclaration made by General McChrystal that the \r\nprotection of the Afghan population is the central and \r\nessential element of the international presence in \r\nAfghanistan. \r\n Poland has been engaged in Afghanistan since \r\nMarch 2002. My country’s involvement follows from \r\nour sense of responsibility for the situation in that \r\ncountry, which still poses a threat to international peace \r\nand security. We are fully aware that assuming the \r\nresponsibility for the stabilization and reconstruction \r\nprocesses is not a short-term commitment. The 2008 \r\ndecision to significantly strengthen the Polish \r\ninvolvement increased the number of our troops \r\nallocated to the International Security Assistance Force \r\noperation in Afghanistan to 1,600. The recent decision \r\nof the Government of Poland in April 2009 resulted in \r\nthe current number of 2,000 military personnel, with an \r\nadditional troop reserve of 200 deployable in an \r\nemergency. Moreover, since the autumn of 2008, \r\nPoland has taken over the responsibility for the \r\nsecurity situation in Ghazni province. \r\n Poland is gradually increasing its engagement in \r\nwhat we view as the crucial task of training the Afghan \r\nnational security forces. My country has provided three \r\noperational military liaison teams to train the Afghan \r\nNational Army and two international police mentoring \r\nteams to the Afghan National Police. Additionally, \r\nPoland has been present in the European Union Police \r\nMission in Afghanistan since its launch in 2007. \r\n Apart from its military engagement, Poland has \r\nbeen reshaping its involvement in accordance with the \r\nconcept of a comprehensive approach aimed at \r\neffective civil-military cooperation. That has resulted \r\nin complementing our military presence with civil \r\nelements. Since the summer of 2008, a Polish team of \r\n30 civilian personnel has been working in the United \r\nStates-led provincial reconstruction team in Ghazni. \r\n Additionally, Poland has provided development \r\naid to Afghanistan since 2002. In 2009, Polish \r\ncontributed around $12.5 million to the reconstruction \r\ngoal in that country, which is five times higher than the \r\namount assigned in 2008. The inclusion of Poland in \r\nthe work of the Joint Coordination and Monitoring \r\nBoard since July 2009 is perceived by my Government \r\nnot only as recognition of our efforts in the field of \r\ndevelopment cooperation with Afghanistan, but also \r\nand primarily as reinforcing our commitment to further \r\nsupporting the process of the stabilization and \r\nreconstruction of Afghanistan. \r\n The problems that we are faced with in \r\nAfghanistan are of major concern to all United Nations \r\nMember States. That common interest gives us grounds \r\nfor optimism that the coordinated efforts of the whole \r\ninternational community will lead us to further progress \r\nin the reconstruction and stabilization of Afghanistan. \r\n Mr. Apakan (Turkey): Let me begin by \r\nexpressing our satisfaction with the draft resolution \r\n(A/64/L.8) that the General Assembly intends to adopt \r\nthis morning. We would like to thank Germany for \r\nfacilitating a consensus on it. We are happy to be \r\nco-sponsoring it. It is a balanced document that reflects \r\nthe achievements and challenges in Afghanistan. \r\n I would like to share Turkey’s position on the \r\nsituation in Afghanistan. That country is passing \r\nthrough a critical period. Turkey is hopeful for its \r\nfuture. The situation may be difficult, but we have to \r\ncontinue working to assist our Afghan brothers and \r\nsisters. The deliberate terrorist attacks on the United \r\nNations mission during the recent electoral process \r\nshould not deter us. It should only strengthen our \r\ndetermination to assist the Afghan people in establishing \r\nlasting peace and stability. Turkey condemns the \r\n28 October terrorist attack against the United Nations \r\nin the strongest terms. We extend our condolences to \r\nthe United Nations family and the families of the \r\nvictims. We wish the wounded a quick recovery. We \r\nsalute the courage of the United Nations and Afghan \r\nstaff. We also share the grief of the Afghan people. \r\n The continued strong presence of the United \r\nNations is of utmost importance to success in \r\nAfghanistan. At this juncture, we must continue to \r\nsupport the Secretary-General by every means; first \r\nand foremost, we must address staff security. \r\n Turkey trusts that the Afghan people will sooner \r\nor later achieve a peaceful and prosperous future. In \r\nthat vein, the elections were an important milestone in \r\nthe efforts to fight terrorism and secure stability in \r\nAfghanistan. The elections were crucial. Everybody \r\nknew that they would not be easy. The most important \r\nthing is that for the second time elections were held in \r\nthat big country. Each election experience undoubtedly \r\nconstitutes a further step towards strengthening \r\ndemocracy. Thanks to the courage and determination of \r\nthe Afghan people, who faced difficult conditions, \r\nelections were held. Turkey congratulates President \r\nA/64/PV.40  \r\n \r\n09-59876 14 \r\n \r\nKarzai on his re-election and hopes that the coming \r\nperiod will be better for the Afghan people. \r\n Now that the elections are over, the new \r\nAdministration should embrace the entire nation. \r\nTurkey hopes that the Administration will reach out to \r\nall ethnic groups in the country through inclusive \r\npolicies and that all who competed against President \r\nKarzai in the election will offer their support to the \r\nnew Administration. Following the election process, it \r\nis of great importance that Afghanistan refocus on \r\nnational unity and reconstruction efforts as soon as \r\npossible. \r\n Let me also briefly touch upon Turkish-Afghan \r\nrelations. Our relations with Afghanistan are unique; \r\nthey are based on deep historical and cultural bonds. \r\nTurkey is continuing its most comprehensive \r\nhumanitarian operation. We are participating in the \r\nInternational Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and \r\ntook over the ISAF Kabul Command as of 1 November \r\nfor a period of one year. On that occasion we nearly \r\ndoubled our troop contribution. We also have a \r\ncivilian-led provincial reconstruction team in Wardak. \r\n Turkey continues to implement an intensive \r\nassistance programme for the peace and prosperity of \r\nthe Afghan people and intends to further expand its \r\nhumanitarian operations. Building the capacity of \r\nAfghanistan and strengthening national ownership in \r\nthe civilian sector is a priority. Turkey will also \r\ncontinue its utmost efforts to provide support to the \r\nUnited Nations in Afghanistan. We will be the lead \r\ncountry in the Security Council on Afghanistan in \r\n2010. We intend to build on the positive momentum \r\ncreated by Japan with the assistance of the United \r\nNations and to contribute to stability in Afghanistan \r\nthrough the Security Council as well. \r\n Turkey believes there is a long-term need for a \r\ncomprehensive approach that includes security, \r\ngovernance, the rule of law, human rights and social \r\nand economic development. All of those issues are \r\ninterlinked, and the following four areas therefore \r\ndeserve special attention: comprehensive economic \r\ndevelopment with a visible impact on the people’s \r\nliving conditions; strong Afghan military and police \r\nforces to take the lead in and ownership of national \r\nsecurity; inclusive national reconciliation in order to \r\nstrengthen peace and stability in the country; and \r\nmodern education and justice systems to effectively \r\ncombat extremism of all sorts. \r\n Regional cooperation is also a must for \r\naccomplishing our goals in Afghanistan. The \r\ninternational community should encourage and help \r\nregional cooperation. For our part, in April we hosted \r\nthe third Turkey-Afghanistan-Pakistan Trilateral Summit \r\nin Turkey. For the first time, security and intelligence \r\nofficials met, along with the Presidents of the three \r\ncountries. We hosted the Friends of Democratic \r\nPakistan Senior Officials meeting and the Foreign \r\nMinisterial Meeting on 24 and 25 August in Istanbul, \r\nfollowed by the Afghanistan-Pakistan Special Envoys \r\nmeeting. We support a coordinated approach at the \r\nregional level and enhanced cooperation between \r\nAfghanistan and its neighbours. To that end, we will \r\ncontinue our regional efforts in order to contribute to \r\nstability in the region. \r\n  Mrs. Ataeva (Turkmenistan), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n Turkey is confident that the country’s stability as \r\nwell as its social and political harmony will grow \r\nstronger in the coming period. Turkey will always \r\nstand by the friendly and brotherly Afghan people and \r\nfully trusts that they will surmount the difficulties \r\nconfronting them in unity and solidarity. We must also \r\nstrengthen the hopes and expectations of the Afghan \r\npeople. Unless the international community wins the \r\nhearts and minds of the Afghan people, peace and \r\nstability will remain a distant objective. \r\n Failure is not an option in Afghanistan. We must \r\nsucceed; we are confident that we will. \r\n Ms. AlRashoud (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): At \r\nthe outset, my delegation wishes to thank Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his sincere and continued \r\nefforts to bring about success in Afghanistan. My \r\ndelegation highly appreciates the pivotal role of the \r\nUnited Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan \r\n(UNAMA), as well as that of the Special Representative \r\nof the Secretary-General for Afghanistan in leading and \r\ncoordinating civilian efforts there. \r\n The State of Kuwait denounces all acts of \r\nviolence and suicide attacks in Afghanistan, and it \r\nfirmly condemns the armed terrorist attack that took \r\nplace at the end of last month against a United Nations \r\nguest, taking the lives of five United Nations \r\nemployees, whose duties included assisting election \r\nteams and other field work that contributed to the \r\nmaintenance of peace and security. It also denounces \r\nthe increased targeting of United Nations missions, \r\n A/64/PV.40\r\n \r\n15 09-59876 \r\n \r\nsince this has led to a growing number of victims \r\namong Afghan civilians, members of international \r\nassistance agencies and all those who work to deliver \r\nhumanitarian assistance in the field. \r\n The State of Kuwait welcomes the commitment \r\nof the Secretary-General to continue United Nations \r\nefforts in support of Afghanistan, based on the moral \r\nduty to carry out desperately needed humanitarian work, \r\nwhile also reaffirming the sovereignty, independence, \r\nterritorial integrity and national unity of Afghanistan. \r\n The State of Kuwait welcomes the adoption of \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1868 (2009) on 23 March, \r\nthe 15 July statement of the President of the Security \r\nCouncil on the situation in Afghanistan (S/PRST/2009/ \r\n21), and all relevant international resolutions. \r\n The State of Kuwait also conveys its \r\ncongratulations to President Hâmid Karzai on his \r\nelection for another term, and wishes him success in \r\nleading the country and in achieving stability, security \r\nand progress for Afghanistan, while affirming its \r\nsovereignty. \r\n We also thank the representative of Germany for \r\nintroducing draft resolution A/64/L.8 on the situation \r\nin Afghanistan, of which my country is sponsor. We \r\nstress the importance of the fundamental and impartial \r\nrole performed by the United Nations in promoting \r\npeace and stability in Afghanistan and in leading the \r\nefforts of the international community.  \r\n According to the report of the Secretary-General \r\non the situation in Afghanistan and its implications for \r\npeace and security (A/64/364), there have been \r\naccomplishments and progress in some areas, such as \r\ndemining, limiting opium cultivation and building and \r\nfostering the capacity of the national Afghan army and \r\npolice forces. But, despite all of that, the rate of change \r\nin the living conditions of the Afghan people is still \r\nvery slow and is a source of increasing despair for \r\nthem. Furthermore, the strong ties between the drug \r\ntrade and the terrorist activities of extremist groups \r\npose a serious threat to security, the rule of law and the \r\ndevelopment of the country. \r\n Therefore, the State of Kuwait appeals to all \r\nMember States, the United Nations and non-governmental \r\norganizations to continue providing all possible \r\nassistance for Afghanistan in all humanitarian fields, in \r\nclose cooperation and coordination with the \r\nGovernment of Afghanistan and consistent with its \r\nnational development strategies. \r\n In this context, we refer to the contributions of \r\nthe State of Kuwait to the reconstruction of \r\ninfrastructure in Afghanistan. The Kuwait Fund for \r\nArab Economic Development provided a loan in the \r\namount of $30 million, in fulfilment of its pledge \r\nduring the donors’ conference held in the Japanese \r\ncapital, Tokyo. This included $15 million for the \r\nrebuilding and rehabilitation of the Kandahar-Spin \r\nBoldak road; the remaining $15 million went to the \r\nAfghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund. Moreover, the \r\nKuwait Red Crescent Society has over the past few \r\nyears provided assistances in the amount of more than \r\n$6.5 million. Also various Kuwaiti civil society and \r\ncharitable organizations continue to provide assistance \r\nto Afghanistan. \r\n In conclusion, it is our hope that the United \r\nNations will continue in its endeavours to provide \r\nassistance to the Afghan Government, in order to \r\nconsolidate peace and stability in Afghanistan, which \r\nwill have a positive effect in the region and will enable \r\nthe country to resume its natural role in the \r\ninternational community. \r\n Mr. Normandin (Canada) (spoke in French): \r\nCanada is pleased to be among the sponsors of draft \r\nresolution A/64/L.8, on the situation in Afghanistan. \r\nOnce again this year, we warmly welcome the fact that \r\nthe draft resolution will be adopted by consensus, thus \r\nreaffirming the collective commitment of all United \r\nNations Member States to Afghanistan. The draft \r\nresolution expresses our hope and resolve that \r\nAfghanistan, with the support of the international \r\ncommunity, will continue to make progress in \r\nachieving a better life for its people. \r\n We are conscious of the challenges that \r\nAfghanistan and the international community face in \r\nachieving that progress. In this context, Canada offers \r\nits sincere condolences to the families and friends of \r\nthe victims of the latest attack on the United Nations in \r\nKabul. We also offer our condolences to the families \r\nand friends of all Afghans as well as to those of the \r\ncivilians and soldiers from many of the countries \r\nrepresented here today who have lost their lives in the \r\nfighting in Afghanistan. We condemn the insurgents’ \r\ndisregard for human life and for all the toil and \r\nsacrifice invested by so many to build a better future \r\nfor Afghanistan. Canadians are saddened by the losses \r\nA/64/PV.40  \r\n \r\n09-59876 16 \r\n \r\nof all those who mourn. Canada too has made \r\nsacrifices. Yet we will not falter in our commitment to \r\nhelp Afghans achieve peace and stability. \r\n Despite the problems in Afghanistan, it is \r\nimportant to remember that progress has been made in \r\ncertain respects. That can be seen in the advances in \r\neducation and health care since the fall of the Taliban \r\nin 2001. Furthermore, as noted in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s September report (A/64/364), Afghanistan \r\nhas seen some real progress this year in the following \r\nareas. With the support of the International Security \r\nAssistance Force and the international community, the \r\nAfghan security forces are increasingly taking charge \r\nof their own security and protecting the Afghan people. \r\nStrong ministers in key positions have made important \r\nprogress on issues such as policing, agriculture and \r\nrural development. Afghanistan has also seen a \r\nsignificant increase this year in its own revenue \r\ncollection. At the same time, opium production has \r\ndecreased in Afghanistan, and the economy is being \r\nboosted by increased efforts to buy locally. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n Continued progress will require a renewed \r\nrelationship of trust among President Karzai, the Afghan \r\nGovernment and Afghan citizens. While the elections \r\nin Afghanistan were not without challenges, Canada \r\nacknowledges the decision of the Independent Election \r\nCommission not to hold a second round and commends \r\nthe Afghan people who made their voices heard. \r\n Now, Canada, along with its international \r\npartners, looks to President Karzai and the new \r\nGovernment to turn their immediate attention to \r\nbuilding the legitimacy of the Government at all levels. \r\nTo do that, the needs of the Afghan people must be \r\ncentral to the setting of realistic objectives by the \r\nAfghan Government. Delivery on those objectives will \r\nrequire the appointment of effective and credible \r\nministers and governors. We look to the Government of \r\nAfghanistan to undertake serious, credible and visible \r\nefforts to improve good governance, combat corruption \r\nand promote and protect human rights. \r\n Our expectations of the Afghan Government are \r\nhigh, but we set these expectations while continuing \r\nour work to rebuild Afghanistan in a concerted effort \r\nwith the Government of Afghanistan, the Afghan \r\npeople and the international community. \r\n Canada has successfully transformed its efforts in \r\nAfghanistan into a fully integrated civilian and military \r\nmission. We are supporting the delivery of measurable \r\nresults in Kandahar, where our efforts are concentrated, \r\nbut also throughout the country, as we contribute \r\n50 per cent of our assistance to national programmes. \r\nCanada continues to make progress on our three \r\nsignature projects: schools are being built, rehabilitation \r\nof the Dahla Dam is advancing and children are being \r\nvaccinated against polio in Kandahar and across the \r\ncountry. \r\n In addition, our stabilization operation, which \r\naims to increase security in Kandahar city and its \r\npopulated approaches, has brought increased stability \r\nin the pilot project village of Deh-e-Bagh by clearing \r\ninsurgent elements, initiating basic infrastructure projects \r\nand working with Afghan security forces to build long-\r\nterm security in the village and its surrounding areas. \r\n The tangible results of our efforts are \r\nencouraging. However, many important challenges still \r\nlie ahead. There is increased violence by an insurgency \r\nattempting to derail reconstruction efforts, progress is \r\nslow in many areas such as governance and rule of law \r\nand access by humanitarian workers to vulnerable \r\npopulations has become increasingly constrained. \r\n In the face of these challenges, we stand behind \r\nthe United Nations as the voice of the international \r\ncommunity in Afghanistan. We are heartened to see \r\nthat the violence has not deterred the United Nations \r\nfrom its vital role in Afghanistan and we would like to \r\npay special tribute to Special Representative Kai Eide \r\nand his team for their tireless efforts. \r\n We call upon the international community to \r\nunite behind the United Nations Assistance Mission in \r\nAfghanistan (UNAMA) and give it the necessary tools \r\nto continue its work in Afghanistan, including UNAMA’s \r\nimportant coordination and outreach role in the more \r\ndifficult areas of the country. \r\n In conclusion, while we need to continue to be \r\nrealistic about the challenges we face in Afghanistan, \r\nwe must maintain our collective resolve and continue \r\nto work with the Government of Afghanistan, the \r\nUnited Nations and the rest of the international \r\ncommunity to ensure a brighter and safer future for the \r\npeople of Afghanistan. \r\n Mr. McLay (New Zealand): New Zealand \r\nwelcomes the progress made in Afghanistan since this \r\n A/64/PV.40\r\n \r\n17 09-59876 \r\n \r\ntime last year, and in particular congratulates the \r\npeople and the Government of Afghanistan on holding \r\nand participating in the first elections run wholly by \r\nAfghan authorities. While New Zealand was very \r\nconcerned by the level of fraud of those elections, we \r\nwelcome the respect shown by the parties for the \r\nelectoral complaints process. \r\n New Zealand believes that attention must now be \r\nfocused on securing a safe and secure future for \r\nAfghanistan. To this end, we call on President Karzai \r\nto move swiftly to form a new, inclusive, credible and \r\neffective Government. We encourage him, with the \r\nsupport of the international community, including New \r\nZealand, to build a renewed relationship with the people \r\nof Afghanistan by addressing deep-seated problems \r\nfacing the country in security, governance, corruption, \r\nhuman rights, development, justice and narcotics. New \r\nZealand also urges the new Government to ensure that \r\nthe legislation that was enacted immediately before the \r\nelection complies with its international human rights \r\nobligations, particularly those protecting women and \r\nchildren.  \r\n New Zealand strongly condemns the recent attack \r\non United Nations staff in Kabul, and we express our \r\nsympathy to the victims and their families. New \r\nZealand agrees with the Secretary-General on the \r\nimportance of protecting United Nations personnel, \r\nwho often work in trying and dangerous environments \r\nin their efforts to build a secure future for Afghanistan. \r\nAnd while we accept the need to relocate many \r\npersonnel, we welcome the Secretary-General’s \r\ncommitment that the United Nations will not be \r\ndeterred from its important role in Afghanistan. \r\n The security situation, particularly in the South \r\nand East, continues seriously to hamper development \r\nby limiting the reach of the Afghan Government and \r\nhumanitarian agencies and hindering their ability to \r\nimprove the lives of the Afghan people. Afghan \r\nmilitary and police capability must be strengthened to \r\ndeal with the deteriorating security situation, and in \r\nthis regard we welcome International Security \r\nAssistance Force commander General McChrystal’s \r\nrenewed focus on training and mentoring. Indeed, \r\nempowering Afghan forces to lead security efforts in \r\nAfghanistan is a key commitment for the international \r\ncommunity, and New Zealand is doing its part to meet \r\nthat commitment. \r\n Although New Zealand faces other security \r\nchallenges closer to home, the New Zealand Defence \r\nForce has led the provincial reconstruction team in \r\nBamyan province for more than six years. The team is \r\nbuilding the capacity of the Afghan National Police to \r\ntake responsibility for security in the province. In \r\naddition, we recently deployed our special forces to \r\nKabul to work alongside the Afghan Crisis Response \r\nUnit. That redeployment and our work on the Bamyan \r\nprovincial reconstruction team demonstrate New \r\nZealand’s long-standing desire to promote the safety \r\nand security of the Afghan people. \r\n In parallel, New Zealand is expanding its civilian \r\nassistance to Afghanistan, with a particular focus on \r\nagriculture in Bamyan. We are also continuing our \r\nsupport for rural livelihood programmes, education and \r\nhealth services and the capacity-building of provincial \r\ngovernmental, non-governmental and civil society \r\norganizations. \r\n While we welcome the progress made in recent \r\nyears, we believe that a continued, sustained \r\ncommitment by the international community will remain \r\nnecessary to help Afghanistan build a positive future. \r\nAnd New Zealand is committed to playing its part in \r\nsecuring that outcome for the people of Afghanistan.  \r\n Mr. Khazaee (Islamic Republic of Iran): Allow \r\nme to extend our gratitude to the Secretary-General, his \r\nSpecial Representative, Mr. Kai Eide, and all their \r\ncolleagues in the United Nations Assistance Mission in \r\nAfghanistan for their firm commitment and valuable \r\ndedication to strengthening peace and stability in \r\nAfghanistan.  \r\n The central role of the United Nations in \r\ncoordinating international efforts in Afghanistan is of \r\nparamount importance and enjoys our full support. I \r\nwould like here to salute the heroism and sacrifices of \r\nUnited Nations personnel in Afghanistan and extend \r\nmy condolences to the United Nations family over the \r\nloss of the lives of United Nations personnel in the \r\nrecent terrorist attack on the guest house on 28 October.  \r\n The Islamic Republic of Iran welcomes the recent \r\npresidential election held in Afghanistan and \r\ncongratulates the people of Afghanistan on their active \r\nparticipation in that historic election and His \r\nExcellency Mr. Karzai upon his re-election.  \r\n We are pleased to see the progress achieved by \r\nour brotherly neighbour Afghanistan in all areas, in \r\nA/64/PV.40  \r\n \r\n09-59876 18 \r\n \r\nparticular in institution-building. As reiterated in the \r\nrecent report of the Secretary-General (A/64/364), the \r\nAfghan State must be founded on solid institutions \r\nstaffed with competent officials selected and promoted \r\non the basis of merit. Much effort has gone into \r\ncreating these institutions over the past eight years, yet \r\nsome of that effort has been insufficient, despite the \r\nachievements made to date. But the deteriorating \r\nsecurity situation has also significantly hampered \r\nattempts to build the governmental institutions and \r\ninfrastructure necessary to the smooth running of the \r\nGovernment.  \r\n As in the past, we extend our full support and \r\nassistance to the people and Government of Afghanistan \r\nin their efforts to achieve security, stability and \r\ncomprehensive and sustainable development. We call \r\nfor the expeditious withdrawal of foreign forces from \r\nAfghanistan and the handing over of the control and \r\nmanagement of Afghani affairs to the people and \r\nGovernment of Afghanistan.  \r\n The security situation in Afghanistan remains the \r\nbiggest challenge. The latest report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the situation in Afghanistan and realities on \r\nthe ground clearly indicates that there have been some \r\naccomplishments in strengthening security and stability \r\nin the country, but that increased terrorist attacks and \r\nviolence in some parts of Afghanistan, coupled with \r\nthe pervasive drug trade and the military operations by \r\nforeign forces, are yet other concerns preoccupying the \r\npeople of Afghanistan and international public opinion. \r\n Along with security concerns, the continuing \r\npoppy cultivation, production of narcotics, drug \r\ntrafficking and the humanitarian crisis, among other \r\nissues, remain to be effectively tackled and continue to \r\nendanger Afghanistan’s stability and development, as \r\nwell as that of the region and beyond. \r\n The recent rise of insecurity in Afghanistan \r\nindicates clearly that the attempts made in the name of \r\nnational reconciliation by some of the Powers present \r\nin Afghanistan to appease some extremist and terrorist \r\ngroups have been shown to be counterproductive and \r\nhave only emboldened such groups. We are of the view \r\nthat peace and stability are achievable only by making \r\nthe people of Afghanistan see the results of the help and \r\nsupport of the international community in their daily life \r\nthrough the reconstruction of infrastructure, capacity-\r\nbuilding, training, education and the development of \r\nimportant sectors such as agriculture, among others. \r\n Furthermore, we believe that the hearts and minds \r\nof the Afghan people, who have undergone many \r\nhardships and much suffering in recent decades, cannot \r\nbe won by relying on military operations. Instead of \r\ndispatching more troops to the country, we should \r\nstrengthen the Afghan National Army and National \r\nPolice expeditiously to enable them to take charge of \r\nsecurity in Afghanistan. \r\n Despite a small drop in narcotic drug cultivation \r\nand production in some provinces, Afghanistan \r\nremains, according to the recent assessment report of \r\nthe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the \r\nworld’s biggest producer of narcotic drugs. The \r\ncontinuing cultivation, production and trafficking of \r\nnarcotics is adversely affecting security there. \r\nCombating this menace unquestionably demands a \r\nlong-term, multifaceted strategy. The magnitude of the \r\nthreat requires more resolute and coordinated efforts by \r\nAfghanistan and the international community. For its \r\npart, the Islamic Republic of Iran has spared no effort \r\nin combating this threat, and we have made many \r\nsacrifices in this regard. While our determination to \r\ncontinue this fight is unwavering, we expect the \r\ninternational community to get more seriously involved \r\nin the quest to save people across the globe from the \r\ndestructive effects of this menace. \r\n Despite all these concerns and uncertainties, \r\nhowever, one thing is clear — the Government and \r\npeople of Afghanistan continue to demonstrate their \r\nsteadfast resolve not to bow to the difficulties they are \r\nfacing, but to surmount them and work for a stable, \r\nprosperous and democratic Afghanistan. In this regard, \r\nthey need the support of every one of us in the \r\ninternational community. The forthcoming conference \r\non Afghanistan will provide us with another \r\nopportunity to reassure the Afghans that as they \r\ncontinue on their journey towards stability, security \r\nand development, the international community stands \r\nwith them, offering its help and support. \r\n Iran, along with other neighbouring countries and \r\nthe world at large, has a vital interest in a secure, stable \r\nand prosperous Afghanistan at peace with itself and \r\nwith its neighbours. In recent years, we have \r\nparticipated in projects aimed at rebuilding and \r\nreconstructing the country, focusing mainly on \r\ninfrastructure and capacity-building. So far, the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran’s official assistance to Afghanistan \r\namounts to about $500 million for those projects. In \r\nthe area of regional cooperation, we have also held \r\n A/64/PV.40\r\n \r\n19 09-59876 \r\n \r\ntrilateral meetings at various levels with Afghanistan \r\nand Pakistan to foster cooperation in the economic and \r\ndevelopment sectors. Within that context, after several \r\nrounds of expert consultations, the heads of State of \r\nAfghanistan, Pakistan and the Islamic Republic of Iran \r\nmet in Tehran in May. \r\n We have also extended our hospitality to more \r\nthan 3 million Afghan nationals over the past three \r\ndecades. At present, close to 1 million Afghan refugees \r\nare registered in Iran, while a similar number of \r\nunregistered Afghans are also living in our country. For \r\nall these years, Afghan nationals have continued to \r\nenjoy Iran’s educational and welfare facilities and to \r\nbenefit from the same subsidies that our own people \r\nreceive. \r\n Let me conclude by expressing our hope for a \r\nbetter and more prosperous future for Afghanistan and \r\na commitment to help its people build a better world \r\nand a better future. \r\n Mr. Cornado (Italy): Italy welcomes and \r\nsupports today’s draft resolution (A/64/L.8) on the \r\nsituation in Afghanistan and looks forward to its \r\nadoption by consensus. That will confirm the strong \r\nongoing commitment of all United Nations Member \r\nStates to assisting Afghanistan on its path to peace, \r\nstability, democracy and reconstruction. And we thank \r\nGermany for its leadership in the negotiations that \r\nenabled the achievement of this important result. \r\n Italy aligns itself with the statement made by the \r\nPermanent Representative of Sweden on behalf of the \r\nEuropean Union and joins previous speakers in \r\nwelcoming the conclusion of the first elections run \r\nentirely by the Afghan authorities, with the support of \r\nthe international community. We congratulate the \r\npeople of Afghanistan and President Hamid Karzai on \r\nhis election, and applaud the other presidential \r\ncandidates for a campaign that addressed key issues \r\nand challenges for Afghanistan and its people. We also \r\nwelcome the efforts of the Afghan electoral institutions \r\nto address irregularities in accordance with Afghan \r\nelection laws and the Afghan Constitution. In this \r\nprocess, important lessons have been learned and need \r\nto be remembered, in view of the forthcoming elections \r\nin 2010. \r\n As the Group of Eight foreign ministers stated on \r\n3 November, the conclusion of this process gives \r\nAfghanistan a new opportunity for peaceful, effective \r\nand productive cooperation among all the political and \r\nsocial components of its society. It also paves the way \r\nfor a new season of collaboration between the Afghan \r\nauthorities and the international community, under \r\nUnited Nations leadership. Strengthening regional \r\ncooperation, particularly among countries crucial to the \r\nstability of the region, will also play a key role in \r\npromoting security and development in Afghanistan. \r\n For the sake of national unity, we encourage \r\nPresident Karzai to rapidly form an effective, qualified \r\nand credible Government. The biggest challenges \r\nfacing the new executive are improving State and local \r\ngovernance, fighting corruption, promoting the rule of \r\nlaw, justice and human rights, as well as increasing \r\naccountability and achieving progress on reintegration, \r\nsecurity and stability. \r\n As one of the largest troop-contributing countries, \r\nItaly confirms its resolute support for the people and \r\nleadership of Afghanistan in their fight against \r\nterrorism and the cultivation and production of narcotic \r\ndrugs, in promoting good governance, and in tackling \r\nacute socio-economic problems. We remain unwaveringly \r\ncommitted to strengthening the ownership and \r\nresponsibility of the Government of Afghanistan, to the \r\nultimate benefit of the Afghan people. Italy looks \r\nforward to participating in the inauguration of \r\nPresident Karzai and, upon the installation of his \r\nGovernment, to stepping up its dialogue with the \r\nAfghan authorities. \r\n Mr. Das (India): I would like to begin by \r\nexpressing India’s appreciation for the convening of \r\nthis discussion on a subject of great importance for us, \r\nour region and the world. I commend the effort by the \r\ndelegation of Germany in coordinating intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations that have led us to this annual General \r\nAssembly resolution on the situation in Afghanistan. \r\nAs we have been doing for the last several years, we \r\nare happy to be a sponsor of this resolution, which is \r\ntraditionally adopted by consensus. \r\n The successful conclusion of the first Afghan-led \r\npresidential and provincial council elections is a major \r\nmilestone in Afghanistan’s evolution as a democracy. \r\nWe congratulate President Hamid Karzai on his \r\nre-election and express our appreciation to all \r\ndemocratic forces in Afghanistan. I would be remiss if \r\nI did not place on record our appreciation for the \r\ncritical supportive role played by the United Nations \r\nand the international community towards organizing \r\nthose elections. India appreciates the resolve and \r\nA/64/PV.40  \r\n \r\n09-59876 20 \r\n \r\ndetermination of the Afghan people who participated in \r\nthis historic election process, notwithstanding threats \r\nand intimidation by the Taliban. \r\n Once a new Government assumes office, a fresh \r\nopportunity will be provided for a renewed \r\ncommitment by the international community to rebuild \r\nAfghanistan. While determining the contours of a new \r\nAfghanistan compact, we need to assimilate and \r\nintegrate the experiences drawn from the past \r\ncompacts, such as the ones agreed to in London in \r\nJanuary 2006 and in Paris in June 2008. Those \r\nagreements placed the responsibility for institution-\r\nbuilding and governance mainly on the shoulders of the \r\nAfghan people and Government, without adequately \r\nfunding that effort and eliminating the growing threat \r\nfrom terrorist groups destabilizing the country. This \r\ntime we need to be mindful of those aspects. \r\n In the arduous journey towards lasting peace and \r\nsecurity in Afghanistan, significant challenges lie \r\nahead. First and foremost is the imperative need for \r\nsecurity. The challenge from a resurgent Taliban and \r\nAl-Qaida is real, and it is one that threatens us all. \r\nAsymmetric warfare and complex terrorist attacks are \r\nbeing mounted in Afghanistan and the wellsprings that \r\nsustain such terror show no signs of being drained. \r\nCivilians, humanitarian personnel, international workers, \r\nincluding United Nations staff and diplomatic \r\npersonnel, as well as our own mission in Kabul, have \r\nbeen targeted in terrorist attacks.  \r\n There is increasing recognition that the surge in \r\nterrorist actions in Afghanistan is linked to the support \r\nand sanctuaries available in the contiguous areas. That \r\nexplains the particularly high level of violence in the \r\nborder areas of Afghanistan. Security and stabilization \r\nof Afghanistan will remain a distant goal unless we are \r\nable to root out the elements of Al-Qaida, the Taliban \r\nand other terrorist and extremist groups operating \r\nwithin and outside Afghanistan’s borders.  \r\n Therefore, in addition to the strengthening of the \r\nInternational Security Assistance Force, it is crucial \r\nthat the Afghan national security forces be enlarged \r\nand developed in a professional manner and at a much \r\nfaster pace, while being provided appropriate resources, \r\ncombat equipment and training. We welcome the \r\nexpansion of their capacities, as this is the only viable \r\nguarantee for a successful conclusion to the military \r\nengagement in Afghanistan. We note with appreciation \r\nthe efforts being made by third countries to strengthen \r\nthe capacities of the Afghan national security forces. \r\n Indeed, there are no quick-fix solutions. In the \r\nbattle for winning the hearts and minds of ordinary \r\nAfghans, we need to guard against the risk of \r\npessimism and defeatism pervading our thought \r\nprocesses. Perseverance and tenacity are critical to \r\nhandle the challenge posed by Al-Qaida, the Taliban \r\nand other terrorist and extremist groups squarely and \r\neffectively. \r\n This brings us to reconciliation. It requires \r\nstrategic clarity, unity of purpose and due recognition \r\nof the nature of those with whom we seek to reconcile. \r\nWithout consensus among relevant parties over key \r\nissues, such as with whom to reconcile and how, we \r\nmay well be dividing ourselves, not those we seek to \r\npeel away from terrorist groups. It is for this reason \r\nthat we must go beyond unworkable divisions between \r\nso-called good and bad Taliban. Terrorism cannot be \r\ncompartmentalized. History suggests that facile \r\nattempts to strike Faustian bargains with terrorists \r\noften result in such forces turning on the very Powers \r\nthat sustained them in the past. Any effort which \r\nweakens the authority of the central Government and \r\nits institutions would be counterproductive. We need to \r\nbe extremely cautious while moving forward on this \r\nsensitive issue. \r\n We support the Afghan Government’s determination \r\nto integrate those willing to abjure violence and live \r\nand work within the parameters of the Afghan \r\nConstitution, which provides the framework for a \r\npluralistic and democratic society. This should, of \r\ncourse, go hand-in-hand with actions to shut down the \r\nsupport and sanctuaries provided to terrorist groups \r\nacross the border. \r\n A sustainable strategy for stabilization of \r\nAfghanistan must be predicated upon short-, medium- \r\nand long-term strategies to address the development \r\nchallenge. While the Afghan Government should spell \r\nout its priorities, the international community should \r\ncome forward to provide the resources for fulfilling \r\nthem. The efforts of the international community in \r\nAfghanistan can only be sustained in the long term if \r\nwe invest in developing Afghan human resources. For \r\nthis, a multipronged approach is required. At one level, \r\nwe must invest in rebuilding the economic and social \r\ninfrastructure of the nation, while generating jobs. At \r\nanother, we must progressively transfer skills and \r\n A/64/PV.40\r\n \r\n21 09-59876 \r\n \r\nauthority to our Afghan friends, to enable them to take \r\nfull ownership of the reconstruction of their country. \r\n In India’s efforts towards stabilization of \r\nAfghanistan, the focus has been on development. \r\nStabilizing Afghanistan is not only integrally connected \r\nwith our own security, it is also connected to the \r\ncivilizational legacy of our friendship. Our commitment \r\nto Afghanistan has now cost $1.2 billion. It includes \r\nthe widest range of activities, from a cold storage plant \r\nin Kandahar to the 218-kilometre-long Zaranj-Delaram \r\nhighway to a power transmission line to Kabul, which \r\nhas provided a round-the-clock electricity supply for \r\nthe first time since 1992. We are constructing the \r\nAfghanistan Parliament building — the edifice of \r\ndemocracy — while simultaneously targeting community-\r\nbased local projects that provide immediate peace \r\ndividends, such as schools and hospitals. In all of this, \r\ncapacity-building is a core element. It is in support of \r\nthis core task that India has expanded, by 35 per cent, \r\nthe current allocation of 1,000 seats in our institutions \r\nfor capacity-building and scholarship programmes. \r\n Turning to the regional aspect, the stabilization of \r\nAfghanistan must be a central part of regional \r\nprocesses, if the country is to regain its role as the \r\ncrossroads of South, West and Central Asia. This \r\nincludes regional economic processes, such as the \r\nSouth Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and \r\nthe Regional Economic Cooperation Conference on \r\nAfghanistan. Those processes benefit the entire region, \r\nwhile hindering them affects Afghanistan and the \r\nregion as well. We must expand, rather than hinder \r\ntrade, transit and transport ties, including overland \r\ntransit and trade. That is the best way of bringing the \r\nregional dimension into play in a positive manner. \r\n Given the turbulence of the past eight years and \r\nthe recent dramatic decline in security, there is need for \r\nan intensified focus on security, governance and \r\ndevelopment on the part of the Afghan Government, \r\nand here the international community should do what it \r\ncan to assist. Failure to stabilize Afghanistan will entail \r\na heavy cost for both the Afghan people and the world \r\nat large. \r\n When we speak of recommitting ourselves to \r\nhelping Afghanistan defeat the forces that seek to \r\ndestroy all that has been achieved since 2001, it is \r\nimportant to recognize that all of us have an abiding \r\ninterest in the success of this endeavour. We believe \r\nAfghanistan needs a long-term commitment from us, \r\neven while we remain mindful of the challenges. The \r\nAfghan people have displayed resilience and a survival \r\ninstinct, even against the greatest odds. We must do our \r\nutmost to support them. \r\n Mr. Erdman (United States of America): The \r\nUnited States is pleased to join other Member States in \r\nsponsoring the draft resolution on the situation in \r\nAfghanistan contained in document A/64/L.8.  \r\n The draft resolution recognizes the progress that \r\nthe Afghan people have made in rebuilding their \r\ncountry, but it acknowledges that far more work has yet \r\nto be done. We recognize the Afghan Government and \r\nsecurity forces for their continuing efforts to address \r\nchallenges in security, governance, human rights and \r\nthe rule of law. \r\n We also thank the Secretary-General, his Special \r\nRepresentative for Afghanistan, Kai Eide, the staff of \r\nthe United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan \r\nand other United Nations personnel and the forces \r\nparticipating in the International Security Assistance \r\nForce and Operation Enduring Freedom for their \r\nshared commitment to the people of Afghanistan. \r\n The draft resolution highlights the challenges \r\nposed by those who seek to disrupt Afghan efforts to \r\nbuild a prosperous and stable country. Violent attacks \r\nby the Taliban, Al-Qaida and other extremists and \r\ncriminal groups undermine efforts to bring stability, \r\nsecurity and a representative Government to Afghanistan \r\nand the draft resolution rightly denounces them. \r\n The brutal attack on 28 October on the guest \r\nhouse in Kabul demonstrated tragically once more the \r\nneed to stand firm against violent efforts to undermine \r\nthe peace and stability that the Afghan people are \r\nworking so hard to establish. Afghanistan has now \r\nreached the conclusion to its presidential election \r\nprocess. We congratulate President Karzai on his \r\nvictory and we congratulate all the candidates who \r\nstood in Afghanistan’s second presidential election, in \r\nparticular, Mr. Abdullah. \r\n This first-ever Afghan-led election was held \r\nunder challenging circumstances, but the result was in \r\nline with Afghanistan’s laws and its Constitution. As \r\nwe move beyond the election, the credibility and \r\nsuccess of the new President and his Government will \r\nrest on its ability to deliver better security, governance, \r\njustice and economic progress to the Afghan people. \r\nWe stand ready to support the new Government in that \r\nA/64/PV.40  \r\n \r\n09-59876 22 \r\n \r\nregard and we call on all Member States to redouble \r\ntheir efforts to work with the new Afghan Government \r\nto promote stability and prosperity for the Afghan \r\npeople, along with peace and security for the region. \r\n Mr. Korček (Slovakia): First of all, I would like \r\nto express my full support and associate Slovakia with \r\nthe statement delivered by the representative of \r\nSweden on behalf of the European Union. Allow me to \r\nunderline several important issues in my national \r\ncapacity. \r\n We welcome the draft resolution on Afghanistan \r\ncontained in document A/64/L.8, and we appreciate the \r\nefforts of Germany to facilitate a message of support \r\nfrom the international community to the Afghan \r\npeople, who hope for a safe, stable, prosperous and \r\ndemocratic country. We are proud to be sponsors of the \r\ndraft resolution. \r\n Slovakia advocates massive engagement on the \r\npart of the international community in Afghanistan. \r\nThe main objective of our common endeavour should \r\nbe to help the new Afghan Government to become \r\nready for taking full responsibility for the country, as \r\nfar as security, stability, rule of law and development \r\nare concerned. \r\n International forces are playing a crucial role in \r\nhelping to bring about a stable and secure Afghanistan. \r\nI would like to pay tribute to all of the women and men \r\nof all nationalities, members of United Nations staff \r\nand many Afghans, who have lost their lives fighting \r\nfor a better, fear-free and prosperous future for \r\nAfghanistan. \r\n I would like to take this opportunity to again \r\nconvey the condolences of my Government to the \r\nfamilies of the most recent victims of violent \r\nextremism. We strongly condemn all subversive acts by \r\nthe Taliban and Al-Qaida, especially those aimed at \r\ncivilians and international civil personnel. \r\n Slovakia is fully aware of its share of the \r\nresponsibility for the situation in Afghanistan. That is \r\nwhy we have significantly increased our engagement in \r\nthe military and civilian fields. Despite the economic \r\ncrisis, we are fulfilling our commitments and we \r\nremain fully involved in the International Security \r\nAssistance Force operation. \r\n Only five months ago, the Government of the \r\nSlovak Republic and the National Council of the \r\nSlovak Republic extended a mandate to 262 Slovak \r\nmilitary personnel in the country and recently we \r\nannounced at the defence ministers meeting in \r\nBratislava that my country is considering increasing \r\nthe number of our troops, as well as doing more in the \r\nconstruction field. \r\n Slovakia is also involved in the training of the \r\nAfghan National Army and in preparing the full \r\nengagement of the Afghan National Police force by \r\nproviding our own police personnel to the European \r\nPolice Office mission. \r\n Security is the main precondition for further \r\ndevelopment of the country. However, we cannot wait \r\nuntil the country is secure to address the humanitarian \r\nsituation. \r\n Durable peace and stability in Afghanistan can be \r\nachieved only when adequate measures to promote the \r\nsocio-economic construction of the country have been \r\nadopted. It is crucial to improve the effectiveness of \r\nour joint efforts so that the greatest number of Afghans \r\ncan enjoy a positive impact on their lives as soon as \r\npossible.  \r\n Since 2003, Afghanistan has been a high priority \r\ncountry for Slovak development assistance. In 2009, \r\nAfghanistan was upgraded to a programme country \r\nunder the new Slovak 2009-2013 medium-term \r\nstrategy for development cooperation. Our goal is to \r\nallocate nearly €1 million to Afghanistan assistance in \r\nthe upcoming period. \r\n Slovakia directs its development assistance in \r\nAfghanistan in line with its sectoral priorities — \r\ndeveloping democratic institutions, civil society and \r\npeace; social development; support for health care and \r\neducation; and developing the economic and market \r\nenvironment and infrastructure. In 2009, six bilateral \r\ndevelopment projects prepared by Slovak organizations \r\ntotalled €850,000. \r\n Afghanistan is one of the four countries in the \r\nworld with the lowest success rates in the fight against \r\npolio. This year, the Government of Slovakia has \r\nfunded the distribution of polio vaccine to 250,000 \r\nchildren in Afghanistan, in cooperation with UNICEF. \r\nIn September, we delivered humanitarian assistance in \r\nthe form of tents and blankets for people in the \r\nprovince of Uruzgan who had been affected by natural \r\ndisasters. \r\n Afghanistan must remain at the top of our agenda \r\nover the long term. We are committed to our common \r\n A/64/PV.40\r\n \r\n23 09-59876 \r\n \r\nobjective to help to improve the everyday lives of \r\npeople in the country. Let me express my sincere hope \r\nthat the international community, led by the United \r\nNations, will step up its multilateral efforts to provide \r\nassistance to the Afghan Government with a view to \r\nconsolidating peace and stability in Afghanistan. \r\n Mr. Kim Bonghyun (Republic of Korea): My \r\ndelegation looks forward to the adoption by the \r\nGeneral Assembly of draft resolution A/64/L.8, on the \r\nsituation in Afghanistan. This draft resolution is the \r\nresult of a constructive and active negotiation among \r\nMember States, which, I believe, represents the \r\npolitical will of all Member States and which supports \r\nthe Afghan people in their political and national \r\nreconstruction process. In this vein, the Republic of \r\nKorea joined in sponsoring this draft resolution in \r\norder to add its own political will to the international \r\ncollaboration in support of the Afghan people. My \r\ndelegation also expresses its appreciation to the \r\nGerman delegation for drafting and facilitating this \r\ndraft resolution. \r\n For the last couple of months, we have witnessed \r\nan intense political evolution in Afghanistan. We were \r\nat times encouraged by progress and at times \r\ndisappointed by setbacks. Most of all, we were deeply \r\nsaddened and disheartened by the terrorist attack on \r\n28 October. However, at the same time, as Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon said, we were more than \r\nresolved not to be deterred, and we remain determined \r\nto continue the work of the United Nations in \r\nAfghanistan.  \r\n My delegation admires the courage and \r\ndetermination of the Afghan people in participating in \r\nthe electoral process and exercising their constitutional \r\nrights in one of the most difficult and threatening of \r\nenvironments. The Electoral Complaints Commission \r\nand the Afghan Independent Election Commission (IEC) \r\ndeserve our respect in upholding the constitutional \r\nprocess. The experience and the lessons learned during \r\nthe elections will lay a valuable and solid foundation \r\nfor the future process of democratization and national \r\nrestoration of Afghanistan. In this regard, my \r\nGovernment welcomes the decision of the IEC to \r\ndeclare Mr. Hâmid Karzai the newly elected President \r\nof Afghanistan and congratulates President Karzai on \r\nhis election. \r\n We believe that the United Nations and the \r\ninternational community are ready to support and \r\ncooperate with the new Afghan Government. We also \r\nbelieve that international engagement is crucial to \r\nrebuilding Afghanistan’s stability and national capacity. \r\nTo earn trust and confidence and establish a credible \r\npartnership with the international community, President \r\nKarzai should reach out to Afghan political leaders and \r\nethnic groups to expedite the national reconciliation \r\nprocess and ensure good governance, including bold and \r\ndetermined measures to eradicate corruptive practices. \r\n The Korean Government has been contributing to \r\ninternational efforts to support the national reconstruction \r\nprocess of the Afghan people, and we are ready to \r\ncontinue to work with President Karzai and his new \r\nGovernment. As was announced last month, the Korean \r\nGovernment will launch a provincial reconstruction \r\nteam in Afghanistan in addition to the existing Korean \r\nmedical support and vocational training team in \r\nBagram, Afghanistan. This decision was made at the \r\nrequest of the Afghan Government and in accordance \r\nwith the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly \r\nand the Security Council. Through this reconstruction \r\nteam and other channels, the Korean Government will \r\ncontinue its support and cooperation with the people \r\nand the Government of Afghanistan. \r\n Lastly, my delegation would like once again to \r\nexpress our deepest condolences to the victims and \r\ntheir families for their tragic losses in the vicious \r\nterrorist attacks on 28 October. This cowardly attack \r\ntargeting unarmed civilians and workers of international \r\norganizations should not be condoned under any \r\ncircumstances. My delegation strongly urges the Afghan \r\nGovernment to take all necessary measures to secure \r\nthe safety and security of civilian workers in the \r\ncountry. We also stand determined to support the \r\ninitiatives of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, including \r\nthe taking of necessary budgetary measures, to \r\nstrengthen security for all United Nations staff in \r\nAfghanistan. \r\n Mr. Gebreel (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in \r\nArabic): I would first like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his detailed and comprehensive report \r\n(A/64/364). We commend the United Nations Assistance \r\nMission in Afghanistan for its remarkable work in that \r\ncountry. We wish to express our regret with regard to \r\nthe incident that led to the death of United Nations \r\nstaff on 28 October and present our condolences to our \r\ncolleagues and to family members. \r\nA/64/PV.40  \r\n \r\n09-59876 24 \r\n \r\n Since 2005, we have continued to receive reports \r\nof the deterioration of the security situation in \r\nAfghanistan. Today’s report again shows a rise in loss \r\nof life and a deterioration in the security situation. That \r\nis a source of concern for us, particularly when we see \r\ndeaths among civilians caused by attacks by armed \r\ngroups as well as by air attacks by the international \r\nforces in Afghanistan. We are extremely concerned \r\nabout the number of civilian victims — especially \r\nbecause of the actions of the international forces — \r\ndespite calls by international and local forces for \r\ncaution in the exercise of their missions. We urge all \r\nmeasures to be taken to ensure the safety of civilians, \r\nas well as full respect for international law and human \r\nrights law. \r\n Another source of concern is mentioned in \r\nparagraph 5 of the Secretary-General’s report: “Efforts \r\nundertaken over the past several years to increase the \r\nnumber of national and international security forces \r\nhave failed to stem the insurgency”. This leads us to \r\nrecognize the reality that a solution does not depend on \r\nthe number of troops or their equipment, but on a \r\ncomprehensive policy based on national reconciliation \r\nand development. In this context, we agree with the \r\nSecretary-General’s statement in paragraph 8 of the \r\nreport concerning the need, noted by some political \r\nleaders of the country, to establish a ceasefire with the \r\nTaliban as a first step towards ensuring the stability of \r\nAfghanistan. \r\n The ultimate goal of the international community \r\nis to assist the Afghan people in building a democratic, \r\nprosperous and stable State. The objective of the \r\ninternational community is not the defeat of the Taliban \r\nor others per se. The use of force alone will not restore \r\nsecurity and stability if it is not accompanied by a \r\ndialogue leading to national reconciliation incorporating \r\nall components of the Afghan people, and if we do not \r\nfight corruption and drug trafficking. The international \r\ncommunity must therefore undertake programmes to \r\nensure that Afghanistan can assume its full \r\nresponsibilities as a sovereign country capable of \r\nproviding security and a dignified life for all Afghans \r\nand conditions conducive to the withdrawal of \r\ninternational troops, which is essential for national \r\nreconciliation. \r\n According to the report of the Secretary-General, \r\nhis Special Representative has visited a number of \r\ndetention centres, including that at Bagram, which is \r\nrun by international forces. But the report does not \r\nevaluate these installations or say whether or not they \r\nare run in accordance with international law and \r\ninternational humanitarian law. We therefore call upon \r\nthe parties running these centres, be they the Afghan \r\nauthorities or international forces, to respect the rules \r\nand norms of international law, international \r\nhumanitarian law and human rights law, and to ensure \r\nthat detainees receive fair trials and are allowed \r\ncontact with the outside world and specialized \r\ninternational organizations, such as the International \r\nCommittee for Human Rights. \r\n Mr. Parham (United Kingdom): When the \r\nGeneral Assembly met last year to discuss the situation \r\nin Afghanistan, many if not all of us underlined the \r\nsignificance of the August presidential elections for \r\nAfghanistan and the need for the United Nations to \r\nwork with the Afghan authorities to ensure that they \r\nwere credible, inclusive and secure. The fact that those \r\nelections went ahead in what were very challenging \r\ncircumstances is an achievement in itself. We welcome \r\nthe United Nations support for the elections. There \r\nwere problems but they were addressed, and it was \r\nright that we saw the process through. \r\n We must remember that these were the first \r\nAfghan-led elections in over 30 years. There was a \r\ngenuine dialogue and debate about the future of the \r\ncountry on a wide-ranging set of issues during the \r\nelections. Candidates campaigned vigorously and \r\nmillions of Afghans turned out to vote, which would \r\nnever have happened under Taliban rule. \r\n Though the elections were Afghan-led, the United \r\nNations played a crucial role in facilitating and \r\nmonitoring the process. From the early planning stages \r\nright up to the process’s conclusion in recent days, the \r\nUnited Nations has provided admirable political \r\nleadership, resource coordination and technical expertise. \r\n I wish to reiterate the United Kingdom’s \r\ncontinued support to the United Nations Assistance \r\nMission in Afghanistan (UNAMA). UNAMA does vital \r\nwork in incredibly difficult circumstances, particularly \r\nfollowing the terrible attack in Kabul on 28 October. \r\nOver the past 10 days, the Secretary-General and his \r\nSpecial Representative have shown impressive resolve \r\nand determination to stay the course in Afghanistan. \r\n In the light of the attack on 28 October, we agree \r\nthat the United Nations must look to improve security. \r\nWe stand ready to engage on how best this can be \r\nachieved. We all want to look carefully at existing \r\n A/64/PV.40\r\n \r\n25 09-59876 \r\n \r\nproposals that form part of the wider uplift package to \r\nsee whether they can meet UNAMA’s security needs or \r\nwhether they need to be adapted.  \r\n Despite the many challenges Afghanistan faces, it \r\nis heartening to be able to note the continuing positive \r\ntrend in counter-narcotics. Following a 19 per cent \r\ndecrease in 2008, opium cultivation looks set to fall by \r\na further 22 per cent this year. In Helmand, close work \r\nwith the Afghan authorities has resulted in a decrease \r\nin cultivation of one third, and the operations \r\nconducted this year under trilateral initiative of the \r\nUnited Nations Office on Drugs and Crime provide \r\ngrounds for cautious optimism at the regional level as \r\nwell. \r\n I should like to touch briefly on the issue of \r\ncivilian casualties. The United Kingdom position \r\nremains as set out in previous discussions. We deeply \r\nregret — deeply regret — any civilian casualty. Each \r\nand every innocent life lost is a tragedy. As General \r\nMcChrystal has made clear, protecting the Afghan \r\npopulation is at the core of our international mission, \r\nin stark contrast to the Taliban and their fellow \r\ninsurgents who, as the Secretary-General’s recent \r\nreport (A/64/364) makes clear, continue to be \r\nresponsible for the vast majority of civilian deaths. \r\n Afghanistan now needs to work to tackle the \r\nsignificant challenges it faces. Following the clear and \r\nauthoritative announcement by the Independent \r\nElection Commission on 2 November, my Prime \r\nMinister spoke to President Karzai on 2 November to \r\ncongratulate him. My Prime Minister told Mr. Karzai \r\nthat we now look to him to take forward a programme \r\nthat represents the interests of all Afghans. President \r\nKarzai, at his press conference on 3 November, made \r\nclear that he is ready to make progress and take firm \r\naction to tackle, among other things, corruption. \r\n The top priority for the international community \r\nshall now be to drive forward the process of \r\nAfghanization by working with the new Afghan \r\nGovernment to build up its security forces, make \r\nprogress on reconciliation, improve local governance, \r\ndeliver services for all Afghans, continue to expand the \r\neconomy, tackle corruption and build constructive \r\nrelations with its neighbours. We urge the international \r\ncommunity to seize this debate in the General \r\nAssembly as an important opportunity to reaffirm our \r\nshared commitment to Afghanistan’s young democracy \r\nand to its stability and security.  \r\n I emphasize our shared commitment. What we are \r\nall doing together in Afghanistan is vital not only to the \r\npeople of Afghanistan, but also to the international \r\ncommunity as a whole. As my Prime Minister said in a \r\nspeech on Friday, we will succeed or fail together, and \r\nwe must succeed. \r\n Mr. Kleib (Indonesia): Indonesia is pleased to \r\nco-sponsor draft resolution A/64/L.8 on the situation in \r\nAfghanistan introduced by the representative of \r\nGermany. The draft reflects the crucial aspect of the \r\nsupport and cooperation of the international community. \r\nOnly through an effective and well-coordinated \r\ndischarging of commitments under the various \r\ninternational, regional and bilateral agreements can we \r\nensure that the Government of Afghanistan is supported \r\nfully in executing its national strategies. \r\n In only a few years, Afghanistan has achieved \r\nnotable progress in various sectors. Both the national \r\nauthorities and civilians are to be commended for their \r\nwork in the extremely arduous circumstances. Yet now, \r\nwhat Afghanistan has accomplished is being \r\ncontinuously eroded by serious challenges to its \r\nsecurity and stability. Fear of sliding back into a \r\nconflict situation is increasing as the activities of \r\nmilitants escalate. The series of recent bomb attacks \r\nreflects the urgent need to address those security \r\nchallenges. In that regard, we condemn the recent \r\nwanton killings of United Nations staff members in \r\nKabul. The courageous United Nations staff and other \r\nassistance partners provide help at great personal risk \r\nand deserve the full support of the international \r\ncommunity.  \r\n We attach primary importance to increasing the \r\ncapacity of the Afghan security forces to address the \r\nsecurity challenges. We are mindful of the strong \r\nwishes of the Afghan people and Government to \r\nempower and strengthen their capacity in various \r\nsectors, including ensuring the security and stability of \r\nthe country. National ownership is indeed critical. \r\nSustained consultation and coordination with the Afghan \r\nauthorities on the implementation of international \r\nassistance is therefore of paramount importance. \r\n Military measures indeed remain crucial in \r\nresponding to security challenges and the increasing \r\nattacks of militants. The role of the International \r\nSecurity Assistance Force (ISAF) has been central in \r\nassisting the Afghan Government to tackle such \r\nchallenges. We also acknowledge the complex \r\nA/64/PV.40  \r\n \r\n09-59876 26 \r\n \r\nsituations faced by ISAF in the execution of its tasks. \r\nHowever, the military is not the only instrument \r\nnecessary to achieve peace and stability. As the \r\nmilitants continue to rely on asymmetric attacks, it is \r\nbecoming obvious that other steps will be needed in \r\naddition to full-scale military responses. The situation \r\nin Afghanistan must be dealt with through a strategy \r\nthat incorporates not only security sectors, but also the \r\npromotion of governance and the rule of law, as well as \r\nsocio-economic development. \r\n An Afghan-led reconciliation process will \r\ncontinue to be needed in order to achieve sustained \r\npeace. The elements among insurgents that renounce \r\nviolence, respect justice, equality, freedom and tolerance \r\nand declare loyalty to Afghanistan’s constitution \r\nshould continue to be engaged politically in the \r\nreconciliation process. Addressing the narco-economy \r\nis also an urgent matter as it is closely linked to \r\nsustaining the insurgency. The continuing effort should \r\nbe sustained and intensified. The progress achieved in \r\nreducing opium cultivation needs to be consolidated. \r\n Indeed, there will be high expectations of the new \r\nGovernment of Afghanistan. The new Government will \r\nhave an opportunity not only to shape a new agenda for \r\ncooperation, but also to improve governance and \r\nservices in the socio-economic field for its people. In \r\nspite of the fact that the capacities of the authorities are \r\nstill limited and there is the danger of insurgent \r\nviolence, it is crucial that the new Government deliver \r\npositive changes to the daily life of its people. A key \r\ningredient to a successful outcome, needless to say, is \r\nnational ownership. Each and every Afghan has to \r\nembrace a new Afghanistan. The participation of all \r\nAfghan people in the political, social and economic \r\nprocesses is imperative. \r\n Partnerships between Afghanistan and neighbouring \r\nStates in addressing security challenges and in finding \r\nmutually acceptable solutions to humanitarian problems \r\nwill remain key to sustainable peace and development \r\nin Afghanistan. In that regard, we welcome the \r\ncommitment of Afghanistan and its immediate \r\nneighbours to contribute to regional security and \r\nprosperity. \r\n Finally, with regard to the United Nations \r\nAssistance Mission in Afghanistan, my delegation \r\nbelieves that the Mission will remain pertinent in \r\nassisting the country in tackling the various challenges \r\nto its security and development. We welcome the \r\nexpansion of its presence to additional regions of the \r\ncountry and the increase of its capabilities and \r\nresources. Such an expansion will hopefully contribute \r\nto bringing about a political surge towards an early \r\nestablishment of peace and stability in the country. \r\n In closing, allow me to reiterate Indonesia’s wish \r\nfor Afghanistan to be a peaceful, democratic and \r\nprosperous country. We also reaffirm our full support \r\nfor the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity \r\nand national unity of Afghanistan. \r\n Mr. Goledzinowski (Australia): Australia \r\nwelcomes this opportunity to endorse and to be a \r\nsponsor of the General Assembly’s draft resolution on \r\nAfghanistan (A/64/L.8) and to reaffirm our \r\ncommitment to international efforts to build a more \r\nstable and more secure Afghan State. \r\n We would like first to take this opportunity to \r\nrecord Australia’s deep sorrow over the deaths of the \r\nUnited Nations workers so callously murdered by the \r\nTaliban on 28 October in Kabul. I suspect that there are \r\nvery few of us here who do not personally know \r\nsomeone who either has served or is serving in \r\nAfghanistan. We support all efforts to meet the security \r\nneeds of United Nations staff in Afghanistan, while at \r\nthe same time enabling the United Nations to continue \r\nto play its indispensable role throughout the country. \r\n Our collective task remains both difficult and \r\nurgent, as developments in Afghanistan over the last \r\nyear, including a worsening of the security situation in \r\nmany parts of the country, have shown. The coming \r\nyear or two will be critical to the success of efforts by \r\nAfghans, and the international community supporting \r\nthem, to meet the pressing challenges facing \r\nAfghanistan. Achieving that will require commitment \r\nto a focused agenda for action that is capable of \r\ndelivering real improvements in the priority areas of \r\nsecurity, governance and economic development. \r\n Today, Afghanistan stands at an important \r\njuncture. The difficulties that accompanied the \r\npresidential election are well known, although it is \r\nimportant to note, as many speakers today have done, \r\nthat the outcome respected the constitution and the \r\nAfghan-led electoral process. Looking forward, the \r\ntask before President Karzai is to form a Government \r\nthat can win the trust of the Afghan people by \r\nstrengthening Afghanistan’s security, fighting corruption \r\nand delivering effective Government services. Through \r\nour ongoing commitment in Afghanistan, Australia \r\n A/64/PV.40\r\n \r\n27 09-59876 \r\n \r\nstands ready to work with the new Afghan Government \r\nand other international partners in support of those \r\nobjectives. \r\n There has been a growing recognition that the \r\nchallenges facing the coalition in Afghanistan demand \r\na comprehensive approach that builds strong \r\nconnections between the military and civilian spheres \r\nand views them as complementary parts of a single \r\nendeavour. Winning support for our mission among the \r\nAfghan people will depend as much on our success in \r\nhelping the Afghan authorities deliver better services \r\nand clean government as on our achievements on the \r\nbattlefield. That is reflected in Australia’s approach to \r\nAfghanistan, which stresses the importance of a \r\ncomprehensive capacity-building and development \r\nassistance effort, in addition to a substantial military \r\nand combat commitment. \r\n On the military front, Australia announced in \r\nApril a substantial increase in the number of our troops \r\nfrom 1,100 to around 1,550. The principal aim of that \r\nincreased contribution was to bolster our efforts in \r\ntraining Afghan forces in the southern province of \r\nOruzgan in order to get them to the point where they \r\nthemselves can take responsibility for providing \r\nsecurity in the province. Thus, we committed \r\nadditional troops to form two further operational \r\nmentor and liaison teams in Oruzgan, in addition to the \r\nteam that we already had in place. Australia also \r\nundertook to provide additional logistic support forces \r\nand force protection elements in Oruzgan, extra \r\nembedded planning and staff officers and some 120 \r\ntroops to assist with security for the elections and \r\ngeneral security in the province. \r\n Australia is also providing $200 million over the \r\nnext five years to the Afghan National Army Trust \r\nFund. Contributing to the Trust Fund supports the \r\nAustralian Government’s objective of creating a self-\r\nsufficient Afghan national army, capable of providing \r\nsecurity for the Afghan nation. Further, we are \r\ndeploying extra Australian Federal Police officers to \r\ntrain and advise members of the Afghan National \r\nPolice force. The Australian Federal Police are \r\nproviding training to the Afghan National Police at \r\nOruzgan’s Provincial Training Centre and also \r\ncontributes through its role in counter-narcotics, \r\ncombating serious organized crime, providing strategic \r\nadvice to the Interior Ministry and working with \r\ninternational partners. It has also helped to develop \r\nnational Afghan police investigation teams and \r\ncontributed to the establishment of strategic police \r\nprogrammes. \r\n In addition to its work on the security front, \r\nAustralia has also made a substantial contribution to \r\nthe equally important civilian assistance effort. Since \r\n2001, Australia has committed $600 million to aid, \r\ncapacity-building and reconstruction, including a \r\npledge of $250 million in June 2008 for development \r\nand reconstruction assistance over three years. \r\n Through the efforts of the Australian Defence \r\nForce’s Reconstruction Task Force and of advisers \r\nfrom the Australian Agency for International \r\nDevelopment, Australia has already completed a range \r\nof important development projects, including in \r\nOruzgan province, such as upgrades to hospitals and \r\nhealth clinics and the construction of bridges. \r\nAustralian aid has contributed to Afghan Government \r\nefforts to build over 800 schools and provide basic \r\nhealth services to approximately 80 per cent of the \r\npopulation. \r\n We are increasing Australia’s aid efforts to \r\nsupport capacity-building and service delivery. We will \r\nprovide up to six technical specialists, who will provide \r\nadvice to key service delivery agencies including the \r\nMinistries of Health, Education, Agriculture and Rural \r\nReconstruction and Development. \r\n One of our principal objectives on the civilian \r\nfront is to help pave the way for a more effective, \r\ncredible and durable system of Government, extending \r\nfrom the capital of Kabul all the way down to the \r\ndistrict level. What Afghanistan desperately needs is a \r\nsystem of national Government that is both trusted by \r\nits people and capable of delivering much-needed \r\nservices throughout the country. Without it, the risk is \r\nthat disillusioned Afghans will increasingly look to the \r\nTaliban and other destructive forces, rather than to the \r\nlegitimate Government, to meet their needs. \r\n With this in mind, Australia is helping to build \r\nthe capacity of the Afghan Government at both the \r\ncentral and the provincial levels so it can deliver better \r\nservices to its people. By contributing $87 million to \r\nthe Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund, Australia \r\nhas supported significant improvements in the Afghan \r\nGovernment’s public financial management practices. \r\nThis support is helping the Government to produce \r\ntransparent budgets and to ensure public funds are \r\nbeing used for their intended purpose. It is also being \r\nused to establish an external monitoring agency to \r\nA/64/PV.40  \r\n \r\n09-59876 28 \r\n \r\noversee donor contributions to the Afghan Government’s \r\nbudget and to strengthen the procurement and audit \r\nfunctions of the Afghan Ministry of Finance. \r\n As part of our contribution to the Trust Fund, we \r\nare also supporting the National Solidarity Programme. \r\nRun by the Afghan Ministry of Rural Reconstruction \r\nand Development, the programme is aimed at providing \r\nsmall-scale, community-implemented infrastructure \r\nprojects and at expanding the economic opportunities \r\nof the Afghan people. That has already reached 22,000 \r\nvillages, or 68 per cent of the rural population, through \r\ndelivery of more than 44,000 infrastructure projects, \r\nsuch as irrigation systems, safe drinking water and \r\nhealth clinics, to those rural communities. \r\n Australia’s efforts in Afghanistan are, of course, \r\nonly part of a broader campaign by the international \r\ncommunity to build a better future for the Afghan \r\npeople. As the international community scales up its \r\nefforts in Afghanistan, effective donor coordination \r\nmechanisms will become even more important, if we \r\nare to ensure transparency and the effective distribution \r\nof resources. \r\n In such a complex environment, the \r\norganizational role played by the United Nations in \r\nAfghanistan is becoming ever more important and \r\nchallenging and we would like to note our appreciation \r\nfor the efforts of the Secretary-General’s Special \r\nRepresentative, Kai Eide, and also the United Nations \r\nMission in Afghanistan personnel he leads. \r\n Australia supports the draft resolution and we \r\nthank the delegation of Germany and its efforts in \r\nmaking it happen. We welcome, in particular, the draft \r\nresolution’s call for reform of the country’s public \r\nadministration in order to ensure good governance and \r\naccountability at both the national and the subnational \r\nlevels. Likewise, we welcome its interest in seeing \r\nfurther progress on the part of the Government in \r\nestablishing a more effective, accountable and \r\ntransparent administration to lead the fight against \r\ncorruption, and its call for improved service delivery in \r\nkey sectors such as energy and water supply. \r\n Mr. Thiebaud (France) (spoke in French): \r\nFrance associates itself with the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of Sweden on behalf of the European \r\nUnion, and we would like to say how much we \r\nappreciate the German delegation’s draft resolution \r\ncontained in document A/64/L.8, of which we are a \r\nsponsor. \r\n May I associate France with those delegations \r\nthat have expressed their sincerest condolences to the \r\nfamilies and the loved ones of the victims of the recent \r\nattack on the United Nations facility in Kabul on \r\n28 October. \r\n We also would like to express our sympathy to \r\nthe families of all the civilian and military personnel \r\nwho were killed in the line of duty in Afghanistan, as \r\nwell as to the Afghan people, who have been sorely \r\ntested. \r\n The electoral process has just concluded. We now \r\nneed to turn towards the future. A new Government \r\nwill soon take office. It will need to meet the specific \r\nexpectations of the Afghan people in terms of progress \r\nin their daily lives as well as in terms of good \r\ngovernance. To do this, President Karzai will need to \r\nwork non-stop to bring together all Afghans of goodwill.  \r\n France will be at the Afghan people’s side in this \r\ncritical phase in the democratic life of the country, a \r\nlife that will also allow them to redefine relations \r\nbetween Afghanistan and the international community \r\nfor the years to come. \r\n With its allies and partners, France will remain \r\ncommitted as long as necessary so that Afghanistan \r\nwill be able to regain full control of their destiny. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Russian): We \r\nhave heard the last speaker in the debate on this item.  \r\n The Assembly will now take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/64/L.8. \r\n I would like to inform the Assembly that, since \r\nthe issuance of draft resolution A/64/L.8, the following \r\ncountries have become sponsors of the draft resolution: \r\nChile, El Salvador, Fiji, Mauritius, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, \r\nSeychelles, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, Timor-Leste, Togo, \r\nthe United Arab Emirates, Viet Nam and Yemen. \r\n May I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt \r\ndraft resolution A/64/L.8? \r\n Draft resolution A/64/L.8 was adopted (resolution \r\n64/11). \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Russian): May I \r\ntake it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to \r\nconclude its consideration of agenda item 17? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The meeting rose at 1.10 p.m. \r\n"
