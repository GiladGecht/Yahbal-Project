(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) \r\n \r\n \r\n In the absence of the President, Mrs. Aitimova \r\n(Kazakhstan), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 3.15 p.m.  \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 11 \r\n \r\nSupport by the United Nations system of the efforts \r\nof Governments to promote and consolidate new or \r\nrestored democracies \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/64/372) \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/64/L.12) \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Qatar to introduce draft resolution \r\nA/64/L.12. \r\n Ms. Al-Thani (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): I am \r\nhonoured to speak under agenda item 11 to introduce \r\nthe draft resolution contained in document A/64/L.12, \r\nentitled “Support by the United Nations system of the \r\nefforts of Governments to promote and consolidate \r\nnew or restored democracies”.  \r\n Since the draft resolution was introduced, the \r\nfollowing countries have joined as sponsors: Estonia, \r\nFinland, France, Gabon, Germany, Greece, Honduras, \r\nHungary, Iceland, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, \r\nKazakhstan, Kuwait, Latvia, Lithuania, Madagascar, \r\nMali, Malta, Morocco, the Netherlands, Norway, \r\nOman, Pakistan, Poland, Portugal, the Republic of \r\nKorea, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, \r\nSweden, Thailand, the former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia, Togo, Turkey, Ukraine, the United Arab \r\nEmirates, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and \r\nNorthern Ireland and the Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela. \r\n The International Conference of New or Restored \r\nDemocracies (ICNRD) has taken on an important role \r\nin strengthening democracy. Governments, parliaments \r\nand civil society organizations participating in the New \r\nor Restored Democracies Movement are determined to \r\nuse the Conferences as a source of inspiration and a \r\nforum to exchange experiences and best practices.  \r\n Based on its commitment to implement \r\nsystematically the recommendations and follow-up to \r\nthe Conferences, the State of Qatar hosted the Sixth \r\nInternational Conference of New or Restored \r\nDemocracies in November 2006. Qatar has begun work \r\nto establish an international advisory board with \r\nmembers from various regional groups.  \r\n Since 2007, the Advisory Board of the Sixth \r\nInternational Conference has held four important \r\nmeetings in Doha and in New York under the \r\nchairmanship of Mr. Mohammed Bin Abdullah Bin \r\nMutib Al-Rumaihi, Deputy Foreign Minister of Qatar, \r\nand has helped to ensure implementation and follow-up \r\nto the meetings of the Movement for the years 2007-\r\n2009 and to assess the progress made in achieving the \r\ngoals set at the Conference. \r\n The New or Restored Democracies Movement is \r\nan important factor in promoting international dialogue \r\non the concepts, principles and basic values of \r\ndemocracy and in strengthening a culture of \r\npartnership with Governments, parliaments, the \r\nA/64/PV.41  \r\n \r\n09-59928 2 \r\n \r\nInternational Civil Society Forum for Democracy and \r\nthe United Nations. We have also set up a national \r\nsecretariat and chairmanship with a database of \r\ninformation on democracy to provide electronic and \r\nother information on progress being made on the \r\nMovement’s programme of work.  \r\n Within that framework, Qatar has also set up a \r\nstructure to ensure implementation of the Movement’s \r\nprogramme of work that can be used by future \r\nConference chairs. It has also led meetings at the \r\nexpert level to address methods of coordination and \r\ninformation exchange, and another meeting that has \r\nsucceeded in developing national committees of the \r\ndemocracy Movement and supplying all of its members \r\nwith reference documents.  \r\n In the context of General Assembly resolution \r\n62/7, adopted in November 2007, the first International \r\nDay of Democracy was celebrated on 15 September \r\n2008. Qatar, as Chair of the Sixth International \r\nConference, is working to ensure systematic \r\nimplementation of the recommendations made at the \r\nConference and to ensure conditions favourable to the \r\nfuture of the New or Restored Democracies Movement \r\nthrough various mechanisms set up for that purpose. \r\n Qatar has encouraged meetings among member \r\nStates to exchange points of view on that topic because \r\nwe consider it important to take action outside the \r\nframework of the Conferences. Thus, Qatar has also \r\norganized meetings of States members of the New or \r\nRestored Democracies Movement on the margins of \r\nUnited Nations sessions.  \r\n Qatar held a ministerial meeting of the New or \r\nRestored Democracies Movement on the sidelines of \r\nthe sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly under \r\nthe chairmanship of Mr. Khaled bin Mohamed \r\nAl-Attiyah, Minister of State for International \r\nCooperation, to consider ways to strengthen the \r\nMovement as an institutional movement akin to other \r\npolitical and regional groups at the United Nations. \r\nParticipants at the meeting addressed initiatives to \r\nensure the Movement’s future sustainability as an \r\ninstitution, agreed to ensure a more effective and \r\nefficient follow-up to the recommendations of the \r\nInternational Conferences of New or Restored \r\nDemocracies, and engaged in discussions on the \r\ninstitutionalization of the Movement.  \r\n The draft resolution before the Assembly today \r\n(A/64/L.12) welcomes the work carried out by the \r\nfollow-up mechanisms of the Sixth International \r\nConference of New or Restored Democracies and the \r\nefforts of the Chair to make the Conference and the \r\nfollow-up thereto more effective and efficient, and in \r\nthis regard takes note of the outcomes of the four \r\nmeetings of the Advisory Board of the Sixth \r\nInternational Conference, particularly the \r\nimplementation of the programme of work of the \r\nConference for 2007-2009 and the convening of the \r\nministerial meeting of the New or Restored \r\nDemocracies Movement on the sidelines of the sixty-\r\nfourth session of the General Assembly.  \r\n In addition, the draft resolution renews its call to \r\nfollow up on the work of the Sixth International \r\nConference of New or Restored Democracies by \r\ninviting interested parties to inform the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of measures taken to that end.  \r\n Qatar attaches great importance to the Conference \r\nand urges effective and efficient follow-up of its \r\nrecommendations. The draft resolution notes the \r\nachievement of the International Conference of New or \r\nRestored Democracies, under the chairmanship of \r\nQatar, of the establishment of the International Day of \r\nDemocracy on 15 September. In addition, it reaffirms \r\nthe central role of parliaments and the active \r\ninvolvement of civil society organizations and media \r\nand their interaction with Governments at all levels in \r\npromoting democracy.  \r\n The draft resolution requests the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to take necessary measures for the observance \r\nof the International Day of Democracy and urges him \r\nto examine options for strengthening the support \r\nprovided by the United Nations system for the efforts \r\nof Member States to consolidate democracy and good \r\ngovernance, including the provision of support to the \r\nPresident of the Sixth International Conference. \r\n Qatar has achieved many successes during its \r\nchairmanship of the Conference, which is to expire \r\nshortly, and the sponsors of the draft resolution \r\nwelcome the decision of the Government of the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela to host the Seventh \r\nInternational Conference of New or Restored \r\nDemocracies in 2010. \r\n The draft resolution invites the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Member States, the relevant specialized \r\nagencies and bodies of the United Nations system and \r\nother intergovernmental organizations to collaborate in \r\nthe holding of the Seventh International Conference. \r\n A/64/PV.41\r\n \r\n3 09-59928 \r\n \r\nWe take this opportunity to congratulate the \r\nGovernment of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela \r\non its decision to host the Seventh International \r\nConference of New or Restored Democracies and \r\naffirm the need for follow-up efforts to systematically \r\nimplement the recommendations of previous \r\nConferences. \r\n The Government of Qatar has held two informal \r\nconsultation meetings with Member States on the draft \r\nresolution before us today. I take this opportunity to \r\nthank Member States that participated in the \r\ndiscussions. Qatar, as Chairman of the Sixth \r\nInternational Conference, thanks all Member States \r\nthat sponsored the draft resolution and hopes to gather \r\nthe greatest number of sponsors. We urge adoption of \r\nthe draft resolution by consensus. \r\n Mrs. Dunlop (Brazil): Before Brazil became \r\nindependent in 1822, many political movements fought \r\nfor our independence. In 1789, one of these movements \r\nadopted a Latin motto taken from Virgil’s first \r\nEclogue: “Libertas quae sera tamen”, which means \r\n“freedom albeit late”. When Brazil became a Republic \r\nin 1889, the motto was engraved on the flag of one of \r\nthe states of our federation. Two hundred years later, \r\nBrazil is very proud to be a consolidated democracy. \r\nNot only in our country, but all over the world, these \r\nideals of freedom and democracy have inspired many \r\nvisionaries.  \r\n As Brazilians, we fully understand the \r\nimportance of democracy and fundamental freedoms \r\nand are fully committed to their implementation. \r\nHence, we strongly support all the efforts made by the \r\nUnited Nations, regional organizations and Member \r\nStates to strengthen programmes devoted to the \r\npromotion and consolidation of democracy, taking into \r\naccount innovative approaches and best practices. \r\n I wish to thank the Secretary-General for his \r\nreport on support by the United Nations system of the \r\nefforts of Governments to promote and consolidate \r\nnew or restored democracies (A/64/372). We appreciate \r\nhis continued efforts and the assistance provided by all \r\nUnited Nations bodies to new or restored democracies \r\nin their commitment to the rule of law and to the \r\nuniversal core values and principles of the United \r\nNations. \r\n We have welcomed the designation of \r\n15 September as the International Day of Democracy, \r\nas we firmly believe that the marking of this day will \r\nserve as a reminder of the importance of democracy. \r\nMoreover, we value the report of the Secretary-General \r\nand his recommendations aimed at improving the role \r\nof the United Nations in democracy assistance. \r\n We would also like to recognize and commend \r\nthe leadership of the State of Qatar as Chair of the \r\nSixth International Conference of New or Restored \r\nDemocracies. We appreciate all the progress achieved \r\nin the past few years, particularly the process of the \r\ninstitutionalization of the Movement. The commitment \r\nof the Qatari Government was pivotal to promoting the \r\ngoals of the International Conference. \r\n Brazil is honoured to be a sponsor of resolution \r\n62/7 and of draft resolution A/64/L.12, which has been \r\nintroduced today. \r\n Last but not least, I would also like to \r\ncongratulate our South American neighbour, the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela, for taking the lead \r\nof the Seventh Conference. We sincerely wish great \r\nsuccess for its chairmanship. \r\n As President Lula once reminded us, Brazil is a \r\ndemocracy that is proud of its multi-ethnic population, \r\nwhich draws on rich and varied cultural heritages but \r\nshares a strong sense of national identity. We live in \r\npeace at home and with neighbouring countries, and \r\nthis is something we will not surrender. Indeed, with \r\nover 100 million voters, all our representatives are \r\nelected by secret ballot at all levels of Government. \r\nThe press and media work freely. Moreover, in the \r\nmost recent presidential election, the undisputed results \r\nwere announced just a few hours after the polls closed, \r\nas Brazil has developed an electronic secret voting \r\nsystem that allows their prompt release. \r\n Our Parliamentarians therefore follow elected \r\nmandates. Our judges undergo public examinations to \r\nbe appointed. The Brazilian Constitution of \r\n1988 recognizes all fundamental freedoms, such as the \r\nfreedom of speech and the freedom of assembly. \r\n We fully support the General Assembly in its role \r\nto encourage Governments to strengthen national \r\nprogrammes to promote and consolidate democracy, \r\nincluding through increased bilateral, regional and \r\ninternational cooperation. More importantly, in view of \r\nthe special meaning of democracy and freedom to \r\nBrazilians, we will continue to uphold all efforts of the \r\nUnited Nations system towards the development of \r\ndemocratic governance and the building and promotion \r\nA/64/PV.41  \r\n \r\n09-59928 4 \r\n \r\nof inclusive national dialogue and reconciliation in \r\ncountries where they may be necessary. \r\n Ms. Ochir (Mongolia): My delegation welcomes \r\nthe report of the Secretary-General on support by the \r\nUnited Nations system of the efforts of Governments to \r\npromote and consolidate new or restored democracies \r\n(A/64/372). As seen in the report, Member States have \r\nmade good progress in promoting and consolidating \r\ndemocracy, in collaboration with regional and \r\nintergovernmental organizations. As democracy \r\nrepresents a key principle and core value of the United \r\nNations, underpinning much of its work, the support by \r\nthe United Nations system is vital to new or restored \r\ndemocracies. \r\n Since 1994, when the General Assembly adopted \r\nits first resolution in support of new or restored \r\ndemocracies (resolution 49/30), United Nations support \r\nand assistance in the area of democracy promotion \r\nhave increased in both scope and content. They range \r\nfrom electoral assistance, supporting constitution-\r\nmaking processes, strengthening democratic \r\ngovernance institutions and the rule of law, promoting \r\nhuman rights and anti-corruption initiatives, improving \r\ngender responsiveness and women’s empowerment, \r\nenhancing civic engagement in democratic processes, \r\nand providing good offices in overcoming political \r\ncrises and preventing their escalation. \r\n My delegation commends here the establishment \r\nlast year of a standby team of mediation experts within \r\nthe Mediation Support Unit of the Department of \r\nPolitical Affairs on a wide variety of issues, including \r\npower- and wealth-sharing, constitution-making and \r\nnatural resource management. That team could serve \r\nthe needs of Member States as a powerhouse of high-\r\ncalibre expertise in relevant areas, to be deployed \r\npromptly at the request of Member States. \r\n Mongolia has been enjoying solid and fruitful \r\ncooperation in consolidating its democratic gains with \r\nthe entities of the United Nations system, in particular \r\nthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) \r\nand its Oslo Governance Centre, the Department of \r\nPolitical Affairs and the United Nations Democracy \r\nFund, as well as with the Inter-Parliamentary Union \r\nand the International Institute for Democracy and \r\nElectoral Assistance (International IDEA). \r\n This year marks the twentieth anniversary of the \r\nonset of Mongolia’s democratic revolution. For us, \r\nthese have been demanding yet rewarding years of \r\nlearning and doing marked by the building of solid \r\ninstitutions of democracy and by a relentless effort to \r\nsimultaneously reform the nation’s political and \r\neconomic systems. We believe that the democratic \r\nsystem of Government is the best model to ensure a \r\nframework of liberties in which to seek lasting \r\nsolutions to the political, economic and social \r\nproblems that our society faces. It is therefore our \r\nbelief that democratic consolidation must come \r\nthrough pursuing sustained economic reform aimed at \r\nensuring better living standards for the people. The \r\ngoal of human development is high on the agenda of \r\nthe Government of Mongolia and was reaffirmed yet \r\nagain by our Prime Minister in his inaugural address on \r\n29 October. \r\n Our steadfast drive towards the consolidation of \r\ndemocracy at home has been duly recognized by the \r\ninternational community. Mongolia successfully hosted \r\nthe Fifth International Conference of New or Restored \r\nDemocracies (ICNRD) in 2003 and chaired that \r\ninternational movement until November 2006. We are \r\nproud to serve currently as an Advisory Board member \r\nof ICNRD. Mongolia is also a member of the \r\nConvening Group of another international movement \r\nfor democracy, the Community of Democracies, and \r\nwas humbled by the Community’s decision to have \r\nMongolia serve as Chair from 2011. \r\n We are also grateful to Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon for selecting us to serve on the Advisory \r\nBoard of the United Nations Democracy Fund. As one \r\nof the main sponsors of resolution 62/7, Mongolia \r\ncelebrated the International Day of Democracy on \r\n15 September this year with days on which Parliament \r\nopened its doors to the public and with a special \r\nthematic debate with youth organizations on \r\ndemocracy and political tolerance issues and future \r\ndirections of democracy in Mongolia. We also kicked \r\noff a three-month nation-wide campaign on democracy \r\neducation. \r\n Since Manila, ICNRD has grown into a truly \r\nglobal movement. We welcome the emphasis placed by \r\nQatar, as Chair, on ensuring a systematic follow-up on \r\nand implementation of the decisions of the Sixth \r\nConference, reflected in the relevant programme of \r\nwork. The productive outcomes of the four meetings of \r\nthe ICNRD Advisory Board have proven the usefulness \r\nof that mechanism. We also commend the efforts of the \r\nChair in setting up a national secretariat, a website and \r\nthe ICNRD democracy databank to facilitate the \r\n A/64/PV.41\r\n \r\n5 09-59928 \r\n \r\nexchange of experience and expertise among States on \r\ntheir democratization efforts. \r\n As we discuss the multifaceted support provided \r\nby the United Nations family organizations and other \r\nrelevant stakeholders to the efforts exerted by the new \r\nand restored democracies, let me share some ideas in \r\nrelation to the recommendations and observations \r\noutlined in the Secretary-General’s report.  \r\n First, on ensuring continued momentum and \r\nsupport for the International Day of Democracy, based \r\non the widespread support expressed globally over the \r\npast two years for celebrating this important occasion, \r\nit might be advisable to designate a specific theme each \r\nyear so that the United Nations system organizations \r\nand Member States can harness their efforts in a more \r\nsystematic manner. In 2010, when we will focus on the \r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs), the international community may choose to \r\ncelebrate the International Day of Democracy by \r\nhighlighting the deliverables of democracy, specifically \r\nin poverty reduction and the attainment of other MDGs. \r\n Secondly, my delegation welcomes the \r\nrecommendation of the Secretary-General to encourage \r\ncomplementarity between the ICNRD and the \r\nCommunity of Democracies. During its chairmanship \r\nof the ICNRD from 2003 to November 2006, Mongolia \r\nattempted to bring the two global democracy \r\nmovements closer together, inter alia, by introducing \r\nthe relevant recommendations in both ICNRD and \r\nCommunity ministerial outcome documents, \r\nconducting consultations and developing a non-paper \r\nto that effect.  \r\n Today, in our view, momentum is gathering in \r\nfavour of exploring avenues of possible cooperation \r\nbetween the two global movements for democracy, \r\nICNRD and the Community of Democracies. As we \r\nknow, the Community’s new Chair, Lithuania, has \r\nmade synergy with ICNRD one of its priorities. The \r\nSecretary-General in his report has also suggested \r\nproviding assistance in this regard. Therefore, we \r\nbelieve that circumstances are conducive to further \r\ndiscussions on possible cooperation between ICNRD \r\nand the Community of Democracies. \r\n We also believe that international efforts to \r\npromote democracy will further benefit if the ICNRD \r\nenjoys robust collaboration and coordination at the \r\nmultilateral level with other actors, for example the \r\nEuropean Union, the Organization for Security and \r\nCooperation in Europe, the Council of Europe, the \r\nInter-Parliamentary Union, the African Union, the \r\nOrganization of American States, International IDEA, \r\nthe Asia-Pacific Democracy Partnership and others. \r\n Thirdly, as to ensuring effective follow-up \r\nbetween ICNRD Conferences, the practices and \r\nexperiences amassed in the past, especially since the \r\nFifth Conference, should be sustained further. As the \r\nSecretary-General’s report mentions, the Fifth \r\nConference follow-up was effective in implementing \r\nthe Ulaanbaatar Conference decisions through a \r\nnumber of pioneering initiatives as a substantive \r\nfollow-up to the Fifth Conference, which included the \r\ndevelopment of nationally owned democratic \r\ngovernance indicators, the country information note \r\nand a national plan of action to consolidate democracy \r\nin Mongolia. Those follow-up experiences were shared \r\nwith other countries and democracy experts at the \r\nInternational Follow-Up Conference on New or \r\nRestored Democracies held in Ulaanbaatar in June \r\n2006, as well as at the Sixth Conference in Doha. \r\n Fourthly, my delegation believes that the \r\ninstitutionalization of ICNRD is essential to ensuring \r\neffective and systematic follow-up to the \r\nrecommendations adopted at each Conference and to \r\nrevitalizing the movement in the twenty-first century. \r\nIn order to build sustainable institutional mechanisms \r\nto advance the political standing of ICNRD in the \r\nworld and provide better services to its members, we \r\nneed a lean and effective secretariat in New York, \r\ncoupled with a trust fund to support ICNRD activities. \r\nWe applaud the Secretary-General’s readiness to \r\nsupport the Movement’s institutionalization in this \r\nregard. \r\n Fifthly, with the increased role of the United \r\nNations in fostering democracy and good governance, \r\nstrengthening United Nations democracy assistance \r\nand addressing its coherence and coordination have \r\nbecome important issues in our discussion. In this \r\nregard, we welcome the Secretary-General’s recent \r\nissuance of a guidance note on democracy. \r\n In his address to the General Assembly in \r\nSeptember (see A/64/PV.8), the President of Mongolia \r\nunderlined democracy as inherently woven into the \r\nMDGs, noting that Mongolia was the first country to \r\nadopt MDG 9 on strengthening human rights, fostering \r\ndemocratic governance and zero tolerance for \r\ncorruption. That pioneering initiative, supported by the \r\nA/64/PV.41  \r\n \r\n09-59928 6 \r\n \r\nUnited Nations Democracy Fund and UNDP, could be \r\na useful tool in ensuring that democracy assistance is \r\nmore effectively integrated into the work of the United \r\nNations, thus bringing more coherence and \r\ncoordination to the Organization’s efforts.  \r\n Here, I would like to reiterate once again the \r\nsuggestion made by my delegation at the sixty-third \r\nsession to the effect that it would be advisable to have \r\na study on the inter-agency coordination and coherence \r\nof democracy promotion efforts undertaken by the \r\nUnited Nations system. Such a study should, in our \r\nview, present concrete proposals and recommendations \r\non streamlining and bringing more coherence into the \r\nactions of different United Nations stakeholders in \r\ndemocracy promotion.  \r\n My delegation also believes that the General \r\nAssembly could take up the issues and \r\nrecommendations raised in the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport, especially those related to the coherence and \r\ncoordination of United Nations democracy assistance \r\nthrough a thematic debate. That would not only engage \r\nus in a thorough discussion on the United Nations role \r\nin democracy promotion, but also effectively \r\ncontribute towards the implementation of draft \r\nresolution A/64/L.12, to be adopted shortly, on support \r\nof the United Nations system to the efforts of new and \r\nrestored democracies. \r\n In conclusion, on behalf of my Government I \r\nwould like to congratulate Qatar on having \r\nsuccessfully chaired the Movement for the past three \r\nyears, and to welcome Venezuela as a host of the \r\nSeventh ICNRD. \r\n Mr. Valero Briceño (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): We are grateful that the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela has been proposed \r\nby numerous countries, by way of draft resolution \r\nA/64/L.12, to be adopted today, for the chairmanship \r\nof the International Conference of New or Restored \r\nDemocracies for the period 2009-2011. We \r\ncongratulate the State of Qatar and its Permanent \r\nRepresentative, Ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz \r\nAl-Nasser, on the advances accomplished during \r\nQatar’s chairmanship of the Movement. Among them, \r\nwe highlight the designation by the United Nations of \r\n15 September as the International Day of Democracy, \r\nthe successful organization of the Sixth International \r\nConference of New or Restored Democracies in 2006 \r\nin Qatar, and the ministerial meeting held during the \r\ngeneral debate of the sixty-fourth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n We also welcome the Secretary-General’s report \r\nentitled “Support by the United Nations system of the \r\nefforts of Governments to promote and consolidate \r\nnew or restored democracies” (A/64/372). \r\n The innovative public policy programmes being \r\nimplemented in Venezuela have laid the foundation for \r\nour efforts to build democracy with social justice. \r\nThese programmes, which are aimed mostly at the \r\ndisadvantaged, the poor and those who have always \r\nbeen excluded, have revitalized and rekindled \r\nVenezuelan democracy. \r\n The Venezuelan Government promotes social \r\nprogrammes that are intended to address the root \r\ncauses of the economic, political, social and cultural \r\nproblems facing society. Significant achievements have \r\nbeen made to that end in Venezuela. According to \r\nUNESCO, illiteracy has been eliminated in my country \r\nthanks to the concerted efforts of our Government and \r\nthe unparalleled cooperation extended by the sister \r\nRepublic of Cuba. According to the Economic \r\nCommission for Latin America and the Caribbean, our \r\ncountry has achieved resounding success in \r\novercoming inequality on our continent. \r\n Venezuela has already achieved the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goal on reducing extreme poverty. \r\nLatinobarómetro, an organization that conducts public \r\nopinion surveys in Latin America, has identified our \r\ncountry as one of the most democratic countries of the \r\nregion. That organization also ranks Venezuela first in \r\nterms of economic and social indicators, such as \r\nequality of opportunities, social security, income \r\ndistribution and employment opportunities. \r\n The 2008 reports of the Economic Commission \r\nfor Latin America and the Caribbean and the United \r\nNations Development Programme confirm the \r\nunderstanding of the men and women of Venezuela that \r\nour country’s strengthened democracy enjoys broad \r\npopular support. Today, all political and social sectors \r\nenjoy democratic freedoms and civil and political \r\nrights that would have been unimaginable in the past. \r\nOver the past 11 years, for example, under the \r\nGovernment of President Hugo Chávez Frias, \r\n12 national electoral processes have taken place, \r\nincluding three presidential elections and five popular \r\nreferendums, among which was one presidential recall \r\n A/64/PV.41\r\n \r\n7 09-59928 \r\n \r\nreferendum. We can therefore say that Venezuela holds \r\na world record for elections. \r\n The President took the Chair. \r\n In the spirit of the Doha Declaration of the Sixth \r\nInternational Conference of New or Restored \r\nDemocracies, held in Doha in 2006, the Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela reaffirms the richness and \r\ndiversity of political systems around the world and \r\nemphasizes the importance of democratic reforms \r\nbeing carried out in accordance with the national, \r\nregional, religious and cultural particularities of each \r\ncountry. \r\n Recalling the Doha Declaration, Venezuela \r\nreiterates its belief that it is the will of the sovereign \r\npeople that is responsible for establishing the \r\ndemocratic institutions of a nation and that, as a result, \r\nthere is no single model of democracy or single set of \r\ndemocratic institutions. There is a rich diversity of \r\ndemocracies around the world.  \r\n Venezuela reaffirms the importance of having the \r\nInternational Conference of New or Restored \r\nDemocracies creatively coordinate the activities of the \r\nGovernments, parliaments, civil society and social and \r\npopular movements of the world to strengthen and \r\nbolster democracies around the world. Venezuela again \r\nthanks Member States for their support for our \r\nassumption of the chairmanship of the International \r\nConference of New or Restored Democracies, and is \r\nfirmly committed to promoting this movement with the \r\nhelp of all Member States. \r\n Mr. Waghmare (India): At the outset, I would \r\nlike to congratulate the delegation of Qatar on having \r\nintroduced the draft resolution (A/64/L.12) on the \r\nimportance of support by the United Nations system of \r\nthe efforts of Governments to promote and consolidate \r\nnew or restored democracies. We are happy to \r\nco-sponsor the draft. \r\n We would also like to take this opportunity to \r\nthank Qatar for its successful stewardship of the Chair \r\nof the International Conference of New or Restored \r\nDemocracies (ICNRD) over the past three years, and \r\nwould like to assure Venezuela of our support during \r\nits forthcoming chairmanship of this process. \r\n The ICNRD process has come a long way since \r\nits inception, with only 13 countries, in Manila more \r\nthan 21 years ago. Today, the process enjoys the \r\nparticipation of more than 100 countries in its \r\nactivities, and its membership is open to all United \r\nNations Member States. This underscores the \r\nimportance of the principles and purposes of the \r\nConference and the success of this initiative. We are \r\nalso happy to note that this process has helped \r\ncountries to share their experiences of democracy and \r\nto identify means to promote pluralistic and \r\nparticipatory democracy. We look forward to the \r\ninstitutionalization of ICNRD activities. \r\n India is the world’s largest democracy, and we \r\nhave been proud to uphold the highest traditions of \r\ndemocracy since our independence more than 60 years \r\nago. We draw particular satisfaction from the manner \r\nin which we conduct our elections. In the past few \r\nyears, we have begun using electronic voting \r\nmachines. This has allowed our election commission to \r\ndeclare results within hours of the start of the counting \r\nprocess, even though, on average, our constituencies \r\nare comprised of over a million voters. A few months \r\nback, we elected the fifteenth Lok Sabha, the lower \r\nhouse of Parliament, in a mammoth process that \r\ninvolved more than 700 million voters exercising their \r\nfranchise to elect 543 members of Parliament. \r\n We are also proud of yet another democratic \r\nprocess at the grass-roots level in India. We have had \r\nan institutionalized system of local self-governance in \r\nrural India since 1993 through the system of \r\npanchayati raj. A unique feature of this grass-roots \r\nempowerment is the component of gender \r\nempowerment, which involves one third of the elected \r\nseats being reserved for women. As a result, we have \r\nover a million elected women representatives in the \r\ncountry. \r\n Our experience has also shown that democracy is \r\na powerful tool for successfully involving people in \r\nmeeting the challenges of development. It allows the \r\npeople to participate actively in and to influence \r\nGovernment actions in the direction of their \r\naspirations. It also ensures a voice for the most \r\nvulnerable and weakest sections of society. Our \r\nexperience also corroborates that implementation of \r\nproactive development policies and economic reforms, \r\nwhen coupled with a liberal democratic polity, leads to \r\nthe overall stability and growth of the country. \r\n As a developing country itself, India is in a \r\nunique position to understand the problems that other \r\ndeveloping countries face while embracing democracy. \r\nWe have been sharing our experience, institutional \r\nA/64/PV.41  \r\n \r\n09-59928 8 \r\n \r\ncapabilities and training infrastructure with nations that \r\nshare our democratic values and beliefs and would like \r\nto benefit from the experience of other democracies. \r\n In this context, we are happy to be one of the \r\nmajor contributors to the United Nations Democracy \r\nFund and to serve on its Advisory Board. We have also \r\nbeen offering our expertise bilaterally and through \r\nother multilateral forums, promoting democratic ideals \r\nand the rule of law. We have also been active \r\nsupporters of activities of the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme in the field of good \r\ngovernance. \r\n India is strongly committed to the underlying \r\nvalues and principles inspiring the International \r\nConference of New or Restored Democracies. We \r\nwould continue to support the Conference and to \r\nprovide necessary assistance to further consolidate, \r\nstrengthen and support it. \r\n Mr. Menan (Togo) (spoke in French): \r\nMr. President, it is always a great pleasure for the \r\nTogolese delegation to see you presiding over the work \r\nof the current session of the General Assembly with \r\nsuch skill, pragmatism and wisdom.  \r\n The Togolese delegation is pleased to participate \r\nin the debate on the agenda item before us.  \r\n The report of the Secretary-General on support by \r\nthe United Nations system of the efforts of \r\nGovernments to promote and consolidate new or \r\nrestored democracies (A/64/372) notes the numerous \r\nactivities undertaken bilaterally and multilaterally \r\nwithin the framework of the implementation of \r\nresolution 62/7. My delegation welcomes these \r\ndevelopments, which demonstrate the vitality of the \r\nmovement and the commitment of the international \r\ncommunity, in particular the United Nations, to seeing \r\nit through. My delegation particularly welcomes the \r\ncelebration of the International Day of Democracy on \r\n15 September 2008, a felicitous initiative adopted at \r\nthe Sixth Conference of New or Restored Democracies, \r\nheld in Doha, Qatar, in November 2006. \r\n The United Nations is built on principles that \r\noffer special guarantees and protection to the dignity \r\nand value of each human being, and establish \r\nconditions conducive to the promotion of sustainable \r\npeace and development. The remarks we have heard so \r\nfar confirm, on the one hand, the existence of a \r\ngrowing consensus on the fundamental values that \r\nsustain democracy, and on the other, the need for each \r\nnation to proceed with prudence and circumspection as \r\nit adapts to the nature and rhythm of the consolidation \r\nof its own democratic process. There is no one model, \r\nand different democratic practices must respect the \r\nspecific characteristics of each people and each culture. \r\n Thus, the United Nations cannot but encourage, \r\nsustain and reinforce democracy wherever it is worthy \r\nof promotion through various forms of assistance. All \r\ncountries need such assistance, because it is not always \r\nclear that democratic principles are observed in their \r\nentirety throughout the world. It is also true that the \r\ndemocratic process is a long-term process and \r\neminently perfectable. \r\n For its part, Togo has always enjoyed such \r\nassistance from the United Nations. Even before we \r\nachieved national sovereignty, this assistance \r\ncontributed to the organization of consultations that \r\nhelped to determine our future, and after independence \r\nwe continued to benefit from assistance whenever we \r\nsought it. As a democracy under construction, Togo is \r\nfirmly committed on the path towards a system of \r\nGovernment based on democratic principles that will, \r\nno doubt, lead to the further consolidation of a country \r\nthat is free, united and prosperous. \r\n In my statement in the general debate on \r\n29 September (see A/64/PV.13), I dwelled at length on \r\nthe Togolese Government policy of undertaking bold \r\nand universally hailed institutional and constitutional \r\nreforms aimed at the promotion of democracy, the \r\nstrengthening of the rule of law and the protection of \r\nhuman rights. Indeed, the strengthening of the \r\ninstitutional framework of democracy cannot be \r\nreduced to its basic functioning or continuity through \r\nsuch mechanisms as periodic elections or the \r\nmultiparty system. It requires Governments to invest \r\nmore heavily in the freedom of speech, which is \r\nessential for democracy and guarantees the rule of law \r\nand successful, sustainable development. Thus, the \r\ninterdependence of these two necessities — democracy \r\nand development — has brought Governments and the \r\nentire political class of Togo to agree on essential rules \r\nthat will govern elections and the economic \r\ngovernance of the country.  \r\n On this matter, in a speech given on 28 July 2007 \r\nin Atakpamé, a city situated in the centre of our \r\ncountry, the Togolese Head of State, His Excellency \r\nMr. Faure Gnassingbé, solemnly proclaimed to the \r\n A/64/PV.41\r\n \r\n9 09-59928 \r\n \r\npeople of Togo and the international community that he \r\nwas firmly committed to doing all in his power to \r\nensure that elections in Togo never again lead to \r\nsanguinary violence. The successful legislative \r\nelections of October 2007, which were certified by \r\ninternational observers as honest, credible, transparent \r\nand non-violent, were the most tangible result of the \r\nresolve of the Togolese Government.  \r\n In the first quarter of the coming year, my \r\ncountry will hold presidential elections in which all \r\ncitizens who meet the conditions set by the \r\nConstitution and the electoral code will be free to vote. \r\nTo that end, in order to promote dialogue among the \r\npolitical actors of our country and at the instigation of \r\nPresident Blaise Compaore of Burkina Faso, the \r\nfacilitator of the inter-Togolese dialogue, the electoral \r\ncode was modified by consensus to relax conditions for \r\nvoter eligibility. \r\n Further, members have been named to our \r\nindependent national electoral commission tasked with \r\nholding and supervising the elections. This mechanism, \r\nso critical to the organization in 2010 of credible \r\npresidential elections that meet international standards, \r\nhas elected its bureau and already started its work. As \r\nour Head of State emphasized in his speech before the \r\ndiplomatic corps at the beginning of the year, the \r\nTogolese Government plans to spare no effort in \r\nensuring the success of the upcoming presidential \r\nelection, which will consolidate the gains already \r\nobtained by the Togolese democracy.  \r\n We all know that the road to democracy is fraught \r\nwith pitfalls and that the most difficult task is to \r\npersuade the citizenry that democracy imposes \r\nresponsibilities on everyone and that, above all, it is \r\nalways a work in progress. Democracy is an evolving \r\nprocess that is vulnerable to social imbalances and that \r\nwe must tirelessly sustain with our efforts, innovation \r\nand imagination. That is undoubtedly what makes it \r\nsuperior to other forms of Government. It is the only \r\npolitical system capable of correcting its own \r\ndysfunctions. That is why my delegation would like \r\nonce again to thank Togo’s partners, the United Nations \r\nand the European Union, for participating actively with \r\nour national electoral commission in the preparation of \r\nour elections and for assisting the Government \r\nfinancially and materially to that end. It is encouraging \r\nthat, today, young democracies are growing stronger \r\nacross Africa, Asia and Latin America. For its part, \r\nTogo will collaborate fully with a view to meeting the \r\ntargets set by the International Conference of New or \r\nRestored Democracies (ICNRD). We invite all member \r\nStates of the ICNRD Movement to take into account \r\nthe proposals put forward during the ministerial \r\nmeeting held in New York on 29 September 2009 in \r\norder to breathe new life into the Movement.  \r\n It is the profound belief of Togo that the \r\ntransformation of the International Conference of New \r\nor Restored Democracies into an organized \r\ninstitutional group, akin to other political groups and \r\nregional entities, will contribute to the revitalization of \r\nits actions and to enabling the promotion of democracy \r\nwithin its member States. \r\n I cannot conclude my remarks without paying \r\ntribute to all the countries and people of good will that \r\nare at the forefront of this initiative, in particular the \r\nState of Qatar and its leaders, which have held the \r\npresidency of the Movement for several years and have \r\nspared no effort to further strengthen it. \r\n Our greatest wish is that these various initiatives \r\nwill enable the International Conference of New or \r\nRestored Democracies, in the context of bilateral and \r\nmultilateral cooperation, to fully realize its objectives \r\nand thus to preserve peace and security for the benefit \r\nof our populations. \r\n Mr. Mohamed (Maldives): These solemn words \r\nof Mahatma Gandhi resonate in the island communities \r\nof the Maldivian archipelago: “The spirit of democracy \r\ncannot be imposed from without. It has to come from \r\nwithin.” \r\n Just a year ago, Maldivians stood in long queues \r\nto cast their ballots in the first ever multiparty \r\ndemocratic election in the history of the country. The \r\nelection saw a record voter turnout and was won by \r\nPresident Mohamed Nasheed, now the leader of the \r\nfirst legitimate and democratic Government of our \r\nisland nation. In September this year, President \r\nNasheed stood at this very podium and repeated his \r\npledge for a Government by the people for the people. \r\nThe election was the culmination of a four-year period \r\nof intensive democratic and human rights reform in the \r\nMaldives that saw the introduction of a new \r\nconstitution that separated the three powers of \r\nGovernment, strengthened human rights safeguards, \r\nushered in multiparty politics, promoted free media \r\nand created a range of independent oversight bodies \r\nand institutions. \r\nA/64/PV.41  \r\n \r\n09-59928 10 \r\n \r\n The Maldivian election was watched by nations \r\nacross the globe and by observers from the \r\nCommonwealth and the European Union, as well as an \r\nExpert Assessment Team from the United Nations. The \r\nemerging electoral and democratic processes have also \r\nreceived the continued support and assistance of our \r\npartners. In short, the Maldives has worked laboriously \r\nto ensure that the winds of freedom and liberty prevail \r\nfor its people. \r\n The Maldives understands that the election of \r\n2008 is not the final destination of this journey. One \r\ndemocratic election is not enough to declare that a \r\ncountry is democratic. With a modern new constitution \r\nin place, the Maldives is mindful of the urgent need to \r\nconsolidate the infant democratic institutions, as \r\nmodern history is evidence that there is a trend for new \r\ndemocracies to revert to authoritarian rule. Indeed, the \r\n2002 Human Development Report found that one \r\nelected government is overturned by military force \r\nalmost every year. Our people need the reassurance \r\nthat the spirit of democracy is here to stay. \r\n Democracy is intertwined with political stability \r\nand economic prosperity. Thus, in financial terms, \r\nsustaining democracy is expensive. The Maldives, for \r\ninstance, is experiencing the crunch of the ongoing \r\nglobal financial crisis and severe austerity measures \r\nhave, therefore, already been introduced to save the \r\ncountry from economic collapse. Legal lacunae exist in \r\nimportant areas, which would strengthen the rule of \r\nlaw and guarantee human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms. Enhanced mechanisms are required to \r\ncombat corruption and ensure accountability and good \r\ngovernance. \r\n Unfortunately, new democracies are inherently \r\nunstable in their infant stages. We are concerned lest \r\nthe new democracy succumb to the extremist seeds that \r\nare being cultivated in deep pockets of our society. If \r\nunchecked, those elements pose a grave threat to the \r\nsmooth functioning of our fledgling democratic \r\nsystem. \r\n In the midst of the economic hardship and \r\nemerging social issues, the Government is anxious for \r\nassistance and support from the international \r\ncommunity to guarantee that we can provide the better \r\nlife that our people have worked for. The Maldives has \r\nalways had faith in the goodwill of our international \r\npartners. Since the inception of the United Nations \r\nDemocracy Fund, the Maldives has been an ardent \r\nsupporter of it. Reinvigorated funds are necessary to \r\ndevelop the capacity of civil society groups, especially \r\nin emerging democracies such as the Maldives. \r\nAdvanced civil society activities provide the requisite \r\ncheck against the reversal of democracy. \r\n The United Nations Human Rights Council \r\nshould also be given due support for its ability to \r\naddress emerging issues. The Maldives believes that \r\nthe Council strives to perform well and contributes \r\nextensively to strengthening human rights worldwide. \r\nThe special procedures mechanisms have also proven \r\nsuccessful for new democracies, such as the Maldives, \r\nas they provide an external audit of specific aspects of \r\ndemocracy consolidation. Therefore, the Maldives \r\nissued a standing invitation to the United Nations \r\nspecial procedures mechanisms in 2006 and as of today \r\nwe have hosted four mandate holders. \r\n I wish to express appreciation for the invaluable \r\nwork carried out by the Office of the High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights in assisting the \r\nGovernment to tackle democracy spoilers. In the case \r\nof the Maldives, the Office continues to stand shoulder \r\nto shoulder with the Government in facilitating the \r\nnurturing of the democratic culture in the Maldives. \r\n Though the United Nations has not established a \r\nspecific treaty on democracy, international law \r\nenshrines democratic principles through existing \r\nconventions, especially the International Bill of Rights. \r\nNorms such as equality, non-discrimination and \r\nfundamental rights and liberties, including the right to \r\nvote and political participation, are entrenched norms \r\nthat prescribe democratic standards for all people \r\nacross the globe. Hence, as responsible members of the \r\ninternational community, we need to work together \r\ncoherently to ensure that the rights and freedoms we \r\nhave agreed upon at the global level are fully translated \r\ninto reality for our people. \r\n Before I conclude, I should like to state that the \r\nMaldives has been an ardent supporter of the \r\nInternational Conference for New or Restored \r\nDemocracies. The Conference provides a crucial forum \r\nfor countries to share experiences and participate in \r\nactive dialogue on ways to strengthen fragile \r\ndemocracies. It is for this reason that the Maldives is \r\nproud to sponsor the draft resolution before us today. \r\n An active legislature, a free judiciary, free and \r\nfair elections and a vibrant civil society are the \r\nbulwarks of democracy. All around the world we are \r\n A/64/PV.41\r\n \r\n11 09-59928 \r\n \r\nexperiencing a renewed embracement of democratic \r\nchange. And thus, at the end of the day, it is a vital test \r\nfor the international community to ensure that the \r\nwinds of democracy continue to blow across our lands. \r\n Mr. Gatan (Philippines): At the outset, I should \r\nlike to convey my delegation’s congratulations and \r\ngratitude for the very able leadership demonstrated by \r\nthe delegation of the State of Qatar, in its capacity as \r\nChair of the sixth International Conference of New or \r\nRestored Democracies (ICNRD), in steering the \r\nmembers of the Conference in their efforts to promote \r\nand consolidate their new or restored democracies. \r\n The Philippines has sponsored draft resolution \r\nA/64/L.12, introduced by the delegation of the State of \r\nQatar, as it has sponsored past resolutions on the \r\nInternational Conference of New or Restored \r\nDemocracies, in keeping with its commitment to the \r\nprinciples and goals of the Conference, which was born \r\nin Manila in 1988. \r\n The Philippines convened the first International \r\nConference of New or Restored Democracies after its \r\nbloodless revolution of 1986, which ended years of \r\nmartial rule in our country. \r\n My delegation has continued to actively \r\nparticipate in the work of the Conference and will \r\ncontinue to do so, in view of the necessity of continued \r\ncooperation, not only among countries in similar \r\nsituations but also with the United Nations system. \r\nThat is required in order for those countries to share \r\ntheir experiences and assist each other in ensuring the \r\ndurability of their democracies so that they can be \r\ncounted upon as constructive members of the \r\ninternational community and more ably provide the \r\nneeded assistance and services to their respective \r\nconstituencies. \r\n The Philippines commends the delegation of the \r\nState of Qatar for organizing the first ICNRD \r\nMinisterial Meeting in September on the margins of the \r\ngeneral debate of the sixty-fourth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. That high-level meeting was \r\nhistoric, as it produced positive outcomes, including \r\nthe decision to hold the first ICNRD summit and the \r\ncreation of an ICNRD secretariat in New York so as to \r\nbe able to more effectively assist the ICNRD Chair and \r\nthe member countries. We also commend the \r\ndelegation of the State of Qatar for organizing several \r\ninitiatives that help to institutionalize the ICNRD and \r\nto ensure its sustainability in the future. \r\n Before I conclude, the Philippines wishes to \r\ncongratulate the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, \r\nwhich will assume the chairmanship of the ICNRD \r\nnext year. In that regard, the Philippines wishes to \r\nreaffirm its full support to the delegation of the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela as the Seventh \r\nConference Chair. \r\n Mr. Zinsou (Benin) (spoke in French): My \r\ndelegation is very grateful to you, Mr. President, for \r\nconvening this plenary meeting of the General \r\nAssembly, devoted, inter alia, to the consideration of \r\nthe report of the Secretary-General on the efforts of \r\nGovernments to promote and consolidate new or \r\nrestored democracies (A/64/372). \r\n It is almost a decade since Benin had the honour \r\nto host on its soil the Fourth International Conference \r\nof New or Restored Democracies (ICNRD). The \r\nCotonou event, coming at the dawn of the twenty-first \r\ncentury, was a decisive turning point in confirming the \r\nrole of the Conference as a forum for thought and \r\ndialogue among the Member States of the United \r\nNations on the promotion of democracy. \r\n The strategic approach adopted was firmly based \r\non the embrace of the principles and values of pluralist \r\ndemocracy by developing countries, but also on the \r\npathways to follow and the means of implementation to \r\nadopt in order to ensure that that political system took \r\nroot in the new or restored democracies and to promote \r\na democratic culture in the world, as a way to \r\nstrengthen international peace and security and boost \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Since then, other countries have taken up the \r\ntorch and the successive International Conferences of \r\nNew or Restored Democracies have rapidly evolved \r\ninto a movement of effective solidarity among the \r\ncountries concerned and the development partners, \r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations. The very \r\ninformative report of the Secretary-General describes \r\nthe progress made in that context, in particular since \r\nthe Sixth Conference, held in Doha at the end of \r\nOctober and the beginning of November 2006. \r\n The emphasis there was placed firmly on \r\ninstitutionalizing the movement with the establishment \r\nof an Advisory Board, a high-level annual meeting and \r\na core secretariat to support the Chairman in executing \r\nhis duties. Here, we welcome the commitment of the \r\nGovernment of Qatar, which has worked tirelessly to \r\ngive substance to those decisions. One notable \r\nA/64/PV.41  \r\n \r\n09-59928 12 \r\n \r\nachievement in that area was the General Assembly’s \r\ndeclaration of an International Day of Democracy \r\n(resolution 62/7), which has already been celebrated \r\ntwice. In addition to regularly convening intersessional \r\nbodies, Qatar has striven to clarify the modalities for \r\ninstitutionalization, so that the next Conference will be \r\nin a position to take decisions on specific proposals.  \r\n In that context, my delegation would like here to \r\nreiterate its support for actions in that direction and its \r\nagreement with the establishment of a permanent \r\nstructure to coordinate implementation of the \r\nrecommendations of the Conferences, so as to provide \r\nrobust strengthening of action to strengthen democracy \r\nin our countries. Benin has no difficulty in supporting \r\nthe principle of establishing a secretariat to assist the \r\nChairman here in New York; creating a special Trust \r\nFund to finance the work of that secretariat, using the \r\nmodel of the Group of 77 and China; and of \r\nestablishing a clearly identified tripartite structure \r\nresponsible for coordinating implementation of the \r\nICNRD’s recommendations nationally, acting as an \r\ninterface with the secretariat on the basis of guidelines \r\ndrawn up under the leadership of the Chairman of the \r\nSixth Conference. \r\n Implementing those specific steps would ensure \r\nthe ICNRD’s greater visibility and the mobilization of \r\ngreater resources, so as to strengthen the follow-up of \r\nthe recommendations and, above all, to encourage \r\nexchange of experiences and the spread of good \r\npractices at the level of member States.  \r\n The Secretary-General’s report underscores the \r\nmultifaceted action of the United Nations in support of \r\nthe new or restored democracies. The United Nations \r\nhas been very flexible in supporting the developments \r\nin the new democracies, providing a framework for \r\nefforts to restore democracy in countries where it has \r\ntemporarily overturned or fundamentally challenged, \r\npaying particular attention to the crucial issue of \r\nunconstitutional changes of Government.  \r\n The international community under the United \r\nNations has to a great extent been mobilized through \r\nagreed activities and offering good offices, in order to \r\nensure the resumption of dialogue among the parties \r\ninvolved in national political processes, thus \r\nfacilitating the emergence of a national consensus for a \r\nreturn to order. Some recent slippage has shown the \r\nneed to strengthen the rapid reaction capability of the \r\nUnited Nations in situations of danger, so as to deal \r\nwith developments before countries become involved \r\nin violence. \r\n The Secretary-General rightly posed the question \r\nin his report of how to tackle political crises and avoid \r\nthem deteriorating, as one of the main problems facing \r\nthe United Nations. We should give greater attention to \r\nthat aspect of United Nations action, which brings us \r\nback to the issue of conflict prevention. We should note \r\nthat United Nations activities in political crises have \r\nbeen more effective in subregions where the \r\nOrganization’s offices are set up to respond quickly, for \r\nexample, through regional offices that can ensure a \r\nregular presence and can liaise closely with regional \r\nand subregional organizations. \r\n Overall, cooperation with international and \r\nregional organizations has quite often proved to be \r\nvery useful, not only in dealing with crisis situations, \r\nbut, above and beyond those situations, as an excellent \r\nmeans of providing specific assistance by using input \r\nfrom all parties and, thus, enhancing effectiveness. As I \r\nsaid, this has been demonstrated not only in crisis \r\nmanagement, but also in ongoing support to efforts at \r\npromoting human rights, strengthening democratic \r\ninstitutions, empowering women and promoting \r\nparticipation by young people. \r\n So all of this does indeed justify the \r\nrecommendations made by the Secretary-General in his \r\nreport. Benin fully agrees with them, particularly on \r\nthe issue of ensuring the complementarity between the \r\nICNRD and the community of democracies in order to \r\nstrengthen cooperation for democracy. We agree this \r\nwould require some kind of coordinating mechanism \r\nand strategic partnerships, so that we can break free \r\nfrom restrictive labels and ensure broader ownership of \r\ndemocratic processes.  \r\n First of all, we have to mobilize effective support \r\nfor local processes leading to democratization and the \r\nconsolidation of democracy. We must ensure the strict \r\ncoherence and coordination of assistance for new or \r\nrestored democracies from the United Nations and its \r\npartners.  \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): In accordance \r\nwith General Assembly resolution 57/32 of \r\n19 November 2002, I give the floor to the observer of \r\nthe Inter-Parliamentary Union. \r\n Mrs. Filip (Inter-Parliamentary Union): It gives \r\nme great pleasure to address the General Assembly on \r\n A/64/PV.41\r\n \r\n13 09-59928 \r\n \r\nthe occasion of the debate on the report “Support by \r\nthe United Nations system of the efforts of \r\nGovernments to promote and consolidate new or \r\nrestored democracies”, as contained in document \r\nA/64/372. \r\n Please allow me to begin by commending the \r\nefforts of the State of Qatar. Over the past three years, \r\nthe State of Qatar has ensured a substantive follow-up \r\nto the recommendations of the successful International \r\nConference on New or Restored Democracies (ICNRD) \r\nin Doha in 2006. Let me also express our appreciation \r\nfor the Secretary-General’s report. \r\n The Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) is proud to \r\nbe part of the ICNRD process. As convener of the \r\nparliamentary component of the ICNRD, the IPU looks \r\nforward to working with the host of the next \r\nConference, Venezuela, to ensure a strong parliamentary \r\ninput. \r\n We are supportive of the initiatives considered for \r\nthe future sustainability and institutionalization of the \r\nICNRD movement. Indeed, there is a clear need to plan \r\nfor and carry out work in between the conferences. \r\nFrom this perspective, a small secretariat based in New \r\nYork and with a mission to engage with and bring \r\ntogether all the ICNRD partners on a regular basis \r\ncould be very effective. \r\n On the occasion of the Sixth International \r\nConference of New or Restored Democracies in Doha, \r\neach of the stakeholders meetings issued a plan of \r\naction by Governments, parliaments and civil society \r\nto further promote democracy nationally and \r\ninternationally. All those who have signed onto those \r\ncommitments should also be held to account, and there \r\nis value, we believe, in an annual review of progress in \r\nmeeting commitments, not just by the ICNRD Chair, \r\nbut by all members. A small ICNRD secretariat could \r\nprovide valuable assistance in this regard.  \r\n The tripartite configuration, that is, Governments, \r\nparliaments and civil society of the ICNRD movement, \r\nhas undeniably allowed for an integrated and all-\r\nencompassing approach to the promotion of democracy \r\nworldwide. We would like to see further progress \r\ntowards a more systematic articulation among the three \r\ncomponents during the seventh ICNRD. \r\n Indeed, the movement draws strength from the \r\nconstructive engagement of its partners and its \r\ninclusive approach. As we move ahead, we would \r\nwelcome the development of enhanced modalities for \r\nmore regular dialogue, exchange and joint action to \r\nenable those partners to come together and interact as \r\nequals. We have formulated a series of \r\nrecommendations in that regard. \r\n As we know, we are still witness to public \r\ndisillusionment with democracy and, as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report recognizes, the perception among \r\nsome that democracy has failed to improve people’s \r\nlives. Concerned by that reality and in an effort to \r\nfurther explore and measure public attitudes towards \r\ndemocracy, the IPU commissioned a global survey this \r\nyear on the critical theme of political tolerance. The \r\noverall finding was that, while there is overwhelming \r\nsupport for political tolerance in all regions of the \r\nworld, in actual practice, there is a widespread \r\nperception of a serious lack of political tolerance. \r\n The results of that survey uncovered some \r\nproblematic areas that will need to be addressed with \r\ngreater focus. The freedom of political expression, the \r\nrole of the opposition, protecting the parliamentary \r\nmandate and promoting greater representation of \r\nminority and indigenous groups in political life will all \r\nbe mainstreamed into the IPU agenda of work for the \r\nmonths and years to come. We trust that this will have \r\nan impact at the level of national parliaments, but also \r\non the other partners active on the democracy front. \r\n IPU is also convinced of the huge \r\ntransformational role that new information and \r\ncommunications technology (ICT) has for the further \r\ndevelopment and promotion of democracy worldwide. \r\nWe are therefore forging a robust partnership with the \r\nUnited Nations in that area through the Global Centre \r\nfor ICT in Parliament. Just last week, the United \r\nNations and the IPU joined in convening the third \r\nWorld e-Parliament Conference, hosted by the United \r\nStates House of Representatives on Capitol Hill in \r\nWashington, D.C. \r\n Certainly, modern information and \r\ncommunications technology can help not only to \r\nconnect parliaments and citizens, but also to strengthen \r\ndemocracy by rendering public institutions more open, \r\ntransparent, accountable and effective, while \r\nimproving the delivery of key public services. Last \r\nweek’s Conference led to a series of recommendations \r\nthat will guide our work ahead. \r\n IPU remains committed to its efforts to build \r\ncapacity within parliaments through advisory services, \r\nA/64/PV.41  \r\n \r\n09-59928 14 \r\n \r\ntechnical assistance and capacity-building seminars, \r\nworkshops and training programmes. It is also \r\ndetermined to continue efforts towards promoting the \r\npolitical participation of women, defending and \r\npromoting human rights and contributing to the setting \r\nof internationally accepted standards in the field of \r\ndemocracy. \r\n IPU also remains committed to ensuring \r\ncontinued momentum and support for the International \r\nDay of Democracy. As the Secretary-General’s report \r\npoints out, the response of Member States and, \r\nparticularly, of parliaments, to the invitation to \r\ncelebrate the first International Day of Democracy was \r\ntruly impressive.  \r\n Parliaments around the world are using the \r\nInternational Day of Democracy, 15 September, to \r\nengage citizens, and particularly young people, in \r\ndialogue on the achievements of and challenges to \r\ndemocracy in their respective countries. IPU will \r\ncontinue to work with and encourage action by \r\nparliaments aimed at ensuring democratic practices, \r\nprinciples and precepts. \r\n Moreover, IPU is committed to its partnership \r\nwith the United Nations, notably, through the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, to build strong parliaments \r\nin post-conflict societies. Parliaments in countries such \r\nas Sierra Leone, Burundi and the Central African \r\nRepublic need to show strong leadership in their efforts \r\nto achieve national healing and post-conflict \r\nreconstruction. We have a common responsibility to \r\nsupport them in those endeavours, as that will help \r\npeople reap the dividends of peace and will mitigate \r\nthe public mistrust of governing institutions. Indeed, \r\ndemocracy should be seen to deliver to the people. \r\n In light of the above, we look forward to our \r\ncontinuing partnership with the United Nations system \r\nand with Member States in our joint efforts to further \r\npromote and consolidate new and restored democracies. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): In accordance \r\nwith General Assembly resolution 58/83 of 9 December \r\n2003, I now give the floor to the observer for the \r\nInternational Institute for Democracy and Electoral \r\nAssistance. \r\n Mr. Tommasoli (International Institute for \r\nDemocracy and Electoral Assistance): I should like to \r\ncommend the State of Qatar for its leadership of the \r\nSixth International Conference of New or Restored \r\nDemocracies (ICNRD) and for fostering progress on its \r\nagenda in the period from 2007 to 2009. As indicated \r\nin the report of the Secretary-General (A/64/372), the \r\nInternational Institute for Democracy and Electoral \r\nAssistance (IDEA) has a strong tradition of \r\ncollaborating with and supporting the International \r\nConference of New or Restored Democracies. We \r\ncontributed to policy debates in Doha, Ulaanbaatar and \r\nCotonou, based on the Institute’s democracy-building \r\nexperience and knowledge, and we stand committed to \r\ncontinuing to do so at the next Conference, to be \r\nhosted by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. \r\n This year, we recall multiple anniversaries of \r\ndemocracy’s achievements: 30 years since the \r\nbeginning of the third wave of democratizations in \r\nLatin America, 20 years since the fall of the Berlin \r\nWall, 15 years since the end of apartheid in South \r\nAfrica, and 10 years since the first elections of the \r\nreform era in Indonesia. \r\n At the same time, we should also remain wary of \r\nthe shortcomings, insufficient depth and persistent \r\nfragility of democracy in many countries. Transition \r\nprocesses have often stalled at the stage of electoral \r\ndemocracy, stopping short of guaranteeing citizens a \r\nbroader enjoyment of civic and political rights, equal \r\naccess to justice and full freedom of expression and \r\nassociation. Democratic checks and balances remain \r\nweak in many countries, while electoral processes \r\nthemselves are often riddled with fraud. Attempts by \r\nincumbent presidents to change their country’s \r\nconstitution in order to remain in power have \r\nproliferated. Formal mechanisms of democracy remain \r\npopulated by political elites, which do not always act \r\nin the interest of their citizens. Finally, both domestic \r\nshortcomings and external constraints have often \r\nprevented young democracies from delivering a better \r\nquality of life to their citizens, thus failing to build the \r\ncritical amount of trust that is necessary for \r\nentrenching democracy and guaranteeing its long-term \r\nsustainability. \r\n While the ideal of democracy remains a driving \r\nforce of political change across the globe, a \r\ndiscrepancy persists between the high value attributed \r\nto the idea of democracy and the mistrust of \r\ndemocratic institutions, such as political parties and \r\nlegislatures, which are often seen as elitist, gender-\r\nimbalanced, ineffective, unresponsive and lacking in \r\ninclusiveness and representation. \r\n A/64/PV.41\r\n \r\n15 09-59928 \r\n \r\n The global financial crisis and the ensuing \r\neconomic recession are severe and potentially \r\ndangerous blows to a number of young democracies, \r\nparticularly in Africa, as they further reduce their \r\ndelivery capacity in terms of development and social \r\nprotection, and consequently increase their \r\nvulnerability to authoritarian alternatives.  \r\n The financial and economic crisis and the \r\nchanging political environment should both be seen as \r\nopportunities and incitements to address, through broad \r\ninternational, inter-institutional and interregional \r\npartnerships, the issue of democracy assistance, with a \r\nview to consolidating its legitimacy and credibility and \r\nto enhancing its effectiveness. \r\n Efforts to strengthen international democracy \r\nassistance should benefit from the rich fund of lessons \r\nlearned and the new, more effective approaches that \r\nthese lessons allow us to distill. These lessons point \r\nessentially to the need for context-sensitive, long-term \r\nand process-based democracy-support policies that \r\nhelp the building of democracy from within and \r\nthrough real partnerships and sharing of knowledge \r\nand experiences, not least from the global South, thus \r\novercoming the obsolete and often paternalistic donor-\r\nbeneficiary relationship. \r\n In this perspective, the ICNRD process has a \r\ngreat potential to foster collaboration and the sharing \r\nof experiences in the field of democracy-building. \r\nIDEA underlines two issues: the need to ensure \r\neffective follow-up between conferences and the \r\nimportance of sharing experience on democratization \r\nefforts. \r\n In terms of follow-up, there is a need to move \r\nbeyond conferences and link them to actual \r\ndemocracy-building efforts on the ground. The \r\ninitiative of Qatar to establish the Advisory Board of \r\nthe Sixth Conference and to implement the three-year \r\n2007-2009 programme of work are steps in the right \r\ndirection. Another example of follow-up action is the \r\nimplementation of self-assessments of the state of \r\ndemocracy by member States, which are aimed at \r\nidentifying areas for action and entry points for policy \r\nreforms. The experience of Mongolia, host of the Fifth \r\nConference, is relevant in this respect. At the request of \r\nMongolia, International IDEA provided technical \r\nadvice to that process, based on the state-of-democracy \r\nassessment methodology that IDEA had developed. \r\n The second issue is the sharing of \r\ndemocratization experiences. There is a need for the \r\nICNRD process to make better use of concrete \r\nexperience-sharing, including in a South-South \r\nperspective, on the challenges and successes of \r\ndemocratic reform processes. This could build on a \r\nmore systematic articulation among the governmental, \r\nparliamentary and civil society segments of ICNRD, \r\nbased on a multi-year strategy with a clear definition of \r\nthe roles and responsibilities of all the actors involved \r\nin the new or restored democracies process. \r\n The celebration of the International Day of \r\nDemocracy has proved an excellent opportunity for \r\nfurther fostering dialogue among national actors, thus \r\ncontributing to democracy-building on the ground. \r\nSuch an approach could facilitate strategic and \r\noperational links between periodic high-level forums, \r\nsuch as the Conference and the Community of \r\nDemocracies, and the mainstream work of agencies \r\nengaged in democracy-building, including those within \r\nthe United Nations system. This would enhance the \r\npolicy and strategic relevance of the new or restored \r\ndemocracies process by taking fully into account the \r\nbroader issues of how to pursue a revitalized \r\ndemocracy-building agenda at the United Nations and \r\nhow to increase the effectiveness of the United Nations \r\nsystem in this respect, as indicated in the guidance note \r\nrecently issued by the Secretary-General. \r\n Effective experience-sharing could be based on \r\nthe following criteria: how to make best use of and \r\ncapitalize on existing knowledge bases, practitioner \r\nnetworks and institutional capacity-building tools, in \r\nparticular those that are already the result of effective \r\npartnerships among institutions engaged in the \r\ndemocracy-building arena; and to define focused \r\nagendas for the high-level segment of the process, and \r\nmake sure that action plans originated by them are \r\nshaped in clear and measurable frameworks, with \r\nresponsibilities assigned to relevant actors, both within \r\nand outside the United Nations, for funding, \r\nimplementation and follow-up. \r\n In conclusion, I reiterate International IDEA’s \r\ncommitment to continuing to provide support to the \r\nICNRD process. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): We have heard \r\nthe last speaker in the debate on this item.  \r\n We shall now proceed to consider draft resolution \r\nA/64/L.12. \r\nA/64/PV.41  \r\n \r\n09-59928 16 \r\n \r\n The following countries have become sponsors of \r\nthe draft resolution: Afghanistan, Argentina, Armenia, \r\nAustria, Bahrain, Belarus, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, \r\nCape Verde, Congo, Costa Rica, Cyprus, the Czech \r\nRepublic, Denmark, Guatemala, Luxembourg and the \r\nRepublic of Moldova. \r\n May I take it that the General Assembly decides \r\nto adopt draft resolution A/64/L.12? \r\n Draft resolution A/64/L.12 was adopted \r\n(resolution 64/12). \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): May I take it \r\nthat it is the wish of the Assembly to end its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 11? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 49 \r\n \r\nCulture of peace \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/64/325) \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/64/312) \r\n \r\n  Draft resolutions (A/64/L.5, A/64/L.13, \r\nA/64/L.14 and A/64/L.15) \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): Today, the \r\nGeneral Assembly will consider an agenda item of \r\nimportance to the United Nations, namely, the culture \r\nof peace. Fostering a culture of peace is the core \r\nmessage of the United Nations, which calls for \r\nrejecting violence and preventing conflicts through \r\ndialogue and negotiations. The Preamble to the United \r\nNations Charter states the determination of Member \r\nStates “to practice tolerance and live together in peace \r\nwith one another as good neighbours”.  \r\n The culture of peace is based on respect for \r\nhuman rights, democracy and tolerance, the promotion \r\nof development, education for peace, the free flow of \r\ninformation and the wider participation of women as an \r\nintegral element in preventing violence and conflicts. \r\nSadly, the many quiet ways in which the United \r\nNations advances the culture of peace are often \r\ndrummed out by violent conflicts that demand our \r\nimmediate attention. \r\n At the outset of the general debate, I suggested \r\nthat we reflect on dialogue among civilizations and \r\nmultilateralism as ways of strengthening international \r\npeace and security and of achieving development. After \r\nyears of deepening distrust among civilizations, I am \r\nencouraged by renewed calls for dialogue and mutual \r\nrespect. It is my deeply held belief that civilizations are \r\nenriched and evolve through dialogue with other \r\ncivilizations. Respect for the diversity of cultures and \r\nreligions is necessary in order to prevent conflicts and \r\nto foster peace. In this context, I commend the many \r\ninitiatives here at the United Nations and among \r\nMember States on interreligious dialogue and dialogue \r\namong civilizations. \r\n The observance of the International Decade for a \r\nCulture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of \r\nthe World is nearing its completion. Before the \r\nAssembly is the report of the Director-General of \r\nUNESCO (see A/64/312) on the progress achieved so \r\nfar and containing further recommendations in this \r\nregard. The global financial and economic crisis is \r\ntaking its toll on investments in education, culture and \r\ndevelopment everywhere. We cannot let those \r\ndevelopments weaken our efforts to strengthen a \r\nculture of peace. We owe it especially to the children \r\nof the world to educate them about other cultures and \r\nreligions so they can see the common humanity that \r\nunderlie all differences. \r\n Fostering a culture of peace and promoting \r\ntolerance should not be limited to today’s debate, but \r\nshould guide all our debates here at the General \r\nAssembly. I therefore propose to organize an informal \r\nthematic debate on dialogue among civilizations, \r\nreligions and cultures at the beginning of next year. I \r\nlook forward to working with Member States to \r\nstimulate a lively discussion and bring fresh \r\nperspectives to this important issue. \r\n I now give the floor to the representative of \r\nBangladesh to introduce draft resolution A/64/L.5. \r\n Mr. Momen (Bangladesh): I would like to thank \r\nyou, Mr. President, for your lovely introductory \r\nremarks on agenda item 49, “Culture of peace”. \r\n It is my privilege to introduce, on behalf of its \r\nsponsors, the draft resolution entitled “International \r\nDecade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for \r\nthe Children of the World, 2001-2010”, contained in \r\ndocument A/64/L.5, dated 3 November 2009. Since the \r\ndraft resolution was submitted, the following \r\n46 countries have joined the list of co-sponsors: \r\nAngola, Azerbaijan, the Bahamas, Bhutan, Bolivia, \r\nBrunei Darussalam, Burundi, Brazil, Cambodia, \r\nCameroon, Cape Verde, Chile, Comoros, Costa Rica, \r\nEl Salvador, Eritrea, Gabon, Guatemala, Guyana, \r\n A/64/PV.41\r\n \r\n17 09-59928 \r\n \r\nHonduras, Jamaica, Lebanon, Malawi, Mali, \r\nMauritania, Mexico, Montenegro, Myanmar, Papua \r\nNew Guinea, Paraguay, Qatar, Saint Lucia, Samoa, \r\nSeychelles, Singapore, Solomon Islands, the Sudan, \r\nSwaziland, Tajikistan, the United Republic of \r\nTanzania, Togo, Turkey, Turkmenistan, the United Arab \r\nEmirates, Uruguay and Viet Nam. \r\n Since 2001, this draft resolution has been tabled \r\nand adopted every year by consensus. This shows the \r\ncommitment of the entire world community to making \r\nthe world safe for our future generation. \r\n The culture of peace is a set of values, attitudes, \r\nmodes of behaviour and ways of life that reject \r\nviolence and prevent conflicts through dialogue among \r\nindividuals, groups and nations. We firmly believe that \r\na world order that is informed by a culture of peace is \r\nconducive to the attainment of our development goals, \r\nincluding the Millennium Development Goals.  We \r\nsee great value in the principles of tolerance, respect \r\nfor diversity, democracy and understanding. Those \r\nideals were endorsed by the Member States in the \r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of \r\nPeace (resolution 53/243) in 1999. Bangladesh was \r\nprivileged to steer the process. \r\n As we near the end of the International Decade \r\nfor a Culture of Peace, we need to start taking stock of \r\nwhat we have achieved since the beginning of the \r\nDecade. I believe that this 10-year exercise has had \r\nsome impact on our psyche as we strive to make a \r\npeaceful world for our future, the children. \r\n We wish to express our profound gratitude to all \r\nthe stakeholders who have contributed and are \r\ncontributing to the promotion of a culture of peace. We \r\nspecially thank UNESCO, the lead agency which has \r\ncarried out programmes to promote the idea worldwide. \r\nOur sincere thanks go to the non-governmental and \r\ncivil society organizations who take the idea of a \r\nculture of peace around the world. In this pursuit, \r\nacademics and the media also have an important role to \r\nplay. We need to involve youth in the process and the \r\nchildren as well. We should first listen to them and then \r\ntake measures accordingly for the betterment of their \r\nlives. \r\n There has been no major change in this year’s \r\ndraft resolution on the International Decade for a \r\nCulture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of \r\nthe World, 2001-2010. We added one new preambular \r\nparagraph and two new operative paragraphs. In the \r\nnew preambular paragraph, we welcome the \r\nappointment of the Special Representative of the \r\nSecretary-General on Violence against Children. In that \r\nconnection, I would like to take this opportunity, as a \r\nmember of the Bureau of the Executive Board of \r\nUNICEF and as next Chair of the Bureau, to assure her \r\nof our fullest support in carrying out her activities. \r\n Of the two new operative paragraphs, paragraph \r\n11 refers to an initiative of the Special Unit for South-\r\nSouth Cooperation of the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme during the 2010 World Exposition to be \r\nheld in Shanghai. We believe that we should take \r\nadvantage of such mega-events to promote the idea of \r\na culture of peace. The other new operative paragraph \r\nis paragraph 17, in which we request from the \r\nSecretary-General a summary report on the activities \r\ncarried out in the past 10 years by UNESCO and other \r\nUnited Nations entities, Member States and civil \r\nsociety, including non-governmental organizations, to \r\npromote and implement the Programme of Action on a \r\nCulture of Peace. I believe that the report will suffice if \r\nsomeone asks what we have achieved in the past \r\n10 years. \r\n Immediately after the independence of Bangladesh \r\nin 1971, the father of the nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh \r\nMujibur Rahman, pursued the policy of friendship to all, \r\nmalice to none in the conduct of the country’s \r\ninternational relations. That principle has always guided \r\nus in shaping our relations with countries all around the \r\nglobe, especially our neighbours. Our peacekeepers \r\nhave been risking their lives in various parts of the \r\nworld in difficult terrain in the pursuit of peace. They \r\nalso carry in their hearts the idea of a culture of peace \r\nand put that idea into action. As a member of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, we are discharging our \r\nresponsibilities. We believe that a culture of peace holds \r\nthe key to sustainable peace in post-conflict societies. \r\nEven in societies that are in a state of peace or apparent \r\npeace, we have to nurture that idea so that no one can \r\nthink about violating the peace. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to express our \r\nprofound gratitude to all Member States that have \r\nshown their solidarity by serving as sponsors of this \r\nannual resolution over the past nine years. Last year, \r\nwe had as many as 124 sponsors, and I hope that the \r\nnumber will be even higher this year. The increase in \r\nthe number of sponsors in each successive year has \r\nbeen a source of great encouragement to the delegation \r\nof Bangladesh to the United Nations.  \r\nA/64/PV.41  \r\n \r\n09-59928 18 \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I now call on \r\nthe representative of Turkey to introduce draft \r\nresolution A/64/L.14. \r\n Mr. Apakan (Turkey): At the outset, I would like \r\nto welcome the report of the Secretary-General on \r\ninterreligious and intercultural dialogue, understanding \r\nand cooperation for peace (A/64/325), which highlights \r\nactivities carried out by the United Nations system and \r\nprovides an overview of regional and global initiatives \r\ntaken in this field. \r\n The Prime Ministers of Turkey and Spain \r\nlaunched the Alliance of Civilizations initiative in \r\n2005 in an effort to galvanize international action \r\nagainst intolerance and extremism through intercultural \r\nand interreligious dialogue and cooperation. The \r\ninitiative is intended to respond to the need for a \r\nconcerted effort by the international community to \r\nbridge divides and overcome prejudices, \r\nmisconceptions and polarization between different \r\ncultures. Since then, the Alliance has made substantial \r\nprogress in moving into the implementation stage and \r\nin strengthening its institutional basis. Today, we are \r\npleased to see that the Alliance has a structure that \r\nproduces concrete projects and solutions. \r\n We are grateful to the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon, who has placed this initiative under his \r\nauspices since the very beginning. Indeed, his \r\ncontributions and his leadership have played an \r\nimportant role in the progress that the Alliance has \r\nmade in such a short time. I would also like to express \r\nour great appreciation to High Representative Jorge \r\nSampaio, whose dedicated efforts greatly contributed \r\nto the development of the initiative. Today, the number \r\nof countries and institutions represented in the Group \r\nof Friends has grown to more than 100, and we believe \r\nthat each country in the Group is now a sponsor of this \r\ninitiative. That is a reflection of the international \r\ncommunity’s will for global peace and harmony.  \r\n We believe that no one has a monopoly on efforts \r\nfor dialogue on cultural and religious issues. We are all \r\nmembers of a family working for the same noble cause. \r\nIn that context, we welcome similar initiatives that \r\ncomplement the work of the Alliance. We are pleased \r\nthat specialized agencies of the United Nations and \r\nother multilateral organizations are showing an active \r\ninterest in the Alliance. In that regard, we appreciate \r\nthe role played by UNESCO. We believe that UNESCO \r\nand its new Director-General, Ms. Irina Bokova, will \r\ncontinue to be important partners of the Alliance. \r\n The first Forum of the Alliance of Civilizations, \r\nwhich was held in Madrid in January 2008, was a \r\nmilestone for the initiative. The Forum initiated several \r\nprojects and mechanisms and provided an opportunity \r\nfor the Alliance to conclude partnership agreements \r\nwith several international organizations. The second \r\nForum, held in Istanbul in April 2009, was indeed \r\nanother milestone for the Alliance. The Forum made it \r\npossible to establish a powerful network of global \r\nleaders, heads of international organizations, \r\ncorporations, media, civil society and youth groups. \r\nThe action-driven event provided participants with a \r\nunique international platform on which to develop joint \r\ninitiatives and forge partnerships. The success of the \r\nIstanbul Forum confirmed that the Alliance had \r\ncompleted its institutionalization phase and was now \r\nready for the implementation of its objectives. \r\n The third Forum will be held in Rio de Janeiro on \r\n28 and 29 May 2010. We would like to take this \r\nopportunity to thank the Government of Brazil for \r\nhosting the next Forum. It will enrich the global scope \r\nof the Alliance with the Latin American experience of \r\ncultural diversity. We would also like to thank Qatar \r\nand Austria for their offers to host subsequent Forums \r\nin 2011 and 2012. \r\n We consider national plans and regional strategies \r\nto be important instruments for the implementation of \r\nthe Alliance’s objectives. That is why we attach \r\nparticular importance to the inclusion of those goals in \r\nnational agendas through the implementation of \r\nnational plans. The third meeting of focal points, to be \r\nheld in Rabat on 10 and 11 November 2009 by the \r\nIslamic Educational, Scientific and Cultural \r\nOrganization, will be yet another opportunity to \r\npromote broader ownership of the Alliance’s goals. \r\n I would also like to highlight the importance of \r\nregional strategies in creating synergies among various \r\nstakeholders. In that respect, we look forward to the \r\napproval of the regional strategy for South-East Europe \r\nin Sarajevo this coming December. \r\n As sponsors, Turkey and Spain believe that, \r\nhaving made sound progress on the ground, it is now \r\ntime for the Alliance to have the backing and the \r\nrecognition of the General Assembly. That is why we \r\nhave prepared a focused and balanced draft resolution \r\n A/64/PV.41\r\n \r\n19 09-59928 \r\n \r\nfor the consideration of Member States, and we very \r\nmuch hope that it will be adopted by consensus. \r\n It is therefore my pleasure to introduce to the \r\nAssembly the draft resolution on the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations contained in document A/64/L.14. The \r\npreambular part of the draft resolution before the \r\nAssembly reflects agreed language from one of the \r\nmost relevant documents that the United Nations has \r\nproduced in the past few years, namely, the 2005 World \r\nSummit Outcome (resolution 60/1).  \r\n I would like to take this opportunity to introduce \r\nan oral revision to the fourth preambular paragraph, so \r\nthat the role of UNESCO, as one of the main partners \r\nof the Alliance of Civilizations, is accurately reflected \r\nin the text. To that end, we would like to replace the \r\nwords “including the programmes led by the United \r\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural \r\nOrganization in this regard” with the words “and \r\nemphasizing the important role of the United Nations \r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in \r\nthis regard”. \r\n The fourth preambular paragraph would thus read \r\nas follows:  \r\n  “Recognizing the importance of \r\nintercultural and interreligious and intra-religious \r\ndialogue in promoting tolerance in matters related \r\nto religion or belief, and emphasizing the \r\nimportant role of the United Nations Educational, \r\nScientific and Cultural Organization in this \r\nregard.”  \r\n The draft resolution already has the sponsorship \r\nof 73 Member States from all regional groups. I am \r\nglad to announce that, in addition to those listed in \r\ndocument A/64/L.14, the following Member States \r\nhave expressed their willingness to sponsor the draft \r\nresolution: Benin, Bolivia, Bulgaria, the Central \r\nAfrican Republic, the Congo, Cyprus, the Dominican \r\nRepublic, Eritrea, Gabon, Haiti, Honduras, \r\nLiechtenstein, Mali, Norway, the Republic of Moldova, \r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines, Seychelles, \r\nThailand, Togo, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, the United \r\nArab Emirates and Viet Nam. This brings the total to \r\n96 sponsors.  \r\n We are encouraged by this broad support. We \r\nbelieve that it shows that the Alliance of Civilizations \r\nis a noble cause. We would like to express our thanks \r\nto our fellow sponsors, and we very much hope that the \r\ndraft resolution will be embraced by the wider \r\nmembership of the General Assembly. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I now give the \r\nfloor to the representative of Spain, also to introduce \r\ndraft resolution A/64/L.14. \r\n Mr. Yáñez-Barnuevo (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThe promotion of a culture of peace is one of the \r\nfundamental purposes of the United Nations. In the \r\n2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1), heads \r\nof State or Government and United Nations Member \r\nStates committed themselves to taking action to \r\npromote a culture of peace and dialogue at the local, \r\nnational, regional and international levels. \r\nFurthermore, on that occasion, they welcomed the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations and recognized the value of \r\nthe various initiatives on dialogue among cultures and \r\ncivilizations, including interreligious dialogue and \r\ncooperation for peace. \r\n In that context, it is a great pleasure for me to \r\naddress the General Assembly to introduce for the first \r\ntime, together with Turkey, a draft resolution devoted \r\nto the Alliance of Civilizations, under agenda item 49, \r\n“Culture of Peace”. Allow me to highlight the fact that \r\nthe draft resolution, contained in document A/64/L.14, \r\nwith the slight oral revision just made by the \r\nrepresentative of Turkey, enjoys the support of almost \r\n100 sponsors. Let me convey to them our sincerest \r\ngratitude for their support in the promotion of this draft \r\nresolution. \r\n Five years ago, on 21 September 2004, during the \r\ngeneral debate of the fifty-ninth session of the General \r\nAssembly (see A/59/PV.4), the President of the \r\nGovernment of Spain, Mr. José Luis Rodríguez \r\nZapatero, proposed an alliance of civilizations in order \r\nto promote greater understanding and cooperation \r\namong nations and peoples of differing cultures and \r\nreligions, as a way to counteract the forces that feed \r\nextremism and endanger peace. \r\n In order to achieve that objective, the President of \r\nthe Government of Spain soon joined his efforts to \r\nthose of the Prime Minister of Turkey, Mr. Recep \r\nTayyip Erdoğan. Since then, Spain and Turkey have \r\nworked hand in hand to strengthen the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations as a useful tool in the context of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n Mr. Tommo Monthe (Cameroon), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair. \r\nA/64/PV.41  \r\n \r\n09-59928 20 \r\n \r\n Since the beginning, and despite criticism from \r\nsome quarters and scepticism from others, the Alliance \r\nof Civilizations has grown and further developed its \r\ngoals. It has become a United Nations initiative, thanks \r\nto the commitment of successive Secretaries-General, \r\nMr. Kofi Annan and Mr. Ban Ki-moon, who have made \r\nthis initiative their own. \r\n Furthermore, the Alliance of Civilizations has, in \r\na short time, gained the support and credibility, not \r\nonly of the entire international community, but also of \r\nnumerous actors within our societies. That is, to a large \r\nextent, due to the fact that the Alliance has been able to \r\nidentify problems that affect our coexistence and has \r\nfilled a gap for which there was no instrument before \r\nits creation. In just a few years, it has become a \r\nplatform for action in reaching common goals such as \r\nrespect, tolerance, dialogue, understanding and peace \r\namong individuals and peoples from diverse cultures \r\nand religions. It is based on universal values that \r\ngovern its action and spirit, inspired by the United \r\nNations Charter and the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights, among other basic instruments of \r\ninternational law.  \r\n As the President of the Government of Spain \r\nnoted at the opening meeting of the first Forum of the \r\nAlliance, in Madrid in 2008, the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations seeks to mobilize those great majorities in \r\nour societies who want to live in peace and to help \r\nprevent the use of diversity for political purposes. The \r\nAlliance of Civilizations wants to help fight against \r\nextremist and intolerant discourse by those who preach \r\nan ideology of hatred and confrontation by invoking \r\nsupposedly insoluble cultural and religious conflicts. \r\n In our view, the Alliance of Civilizations should \r\nwork through dialogue and intercultural cooperation to \r\ncreate a propitious atmosphere for reaching political \r\nobjectives. We believe that that political and cultural \r\norientation, together with the capacity to produce \r\npractical results, represents the added value offered by \r\nthis initiative. \r\n I would like to highlight the extraordinary work \r\ndone by the Secretary-General’s High Representative \r\nfor the Alliance of Civilizations, Mr. Jorge Sampaio. \r\nHe is working very hard to make the Alliance a \r\ncredible, solid and dynamic initiative, able to produce \r\nreal results. Thanks to his leadership, commitment and \r\ndedication, he has been able to mobilize States, \r\ninternational organizations, representatives of civil \r\nsociety, the media, the private sector, religious leaders \r\nand others, to work together to achieve the goals of the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations. The two reports of the High \r\nRepresentative that the Secretary-General has \r\nconveyed to the General Assembly (see A/63/336 and \r\nA/63/914) describe in detail the many activities carried \r\nout by the Alliance of Civilizations in recent years.  \r\n Furthermore, the credibility of, respect for and \r\npolitical soundness of the Alliance of Civilizations are \r\ndue in large part to its sizable and active Group of \r\nFriends. The Group now has more than 100 members, \r\nincluding States and international organizations, which \r\nis a good indicator of the initiative’s political \r\nrelevance. \r\n The designation of focal points for the Alliance \r\nby the States members of the Group of Friends has \r\nmade it possible to establish a broad and active \r\nnetwork of contacts. Tomorrow, more than 70 \r\ndesignated focal points will meet in Rabat to share \r\nideas and proposals. In addition, the adoption of \r\nnational plans by States is making it possible to \r\npromote the incorporation of Alliance objectives into \r\npublic policies at the domestic level.  \r\n With regard to cooperation with international \r\norganizations, the Alliance has a full work slate and \r\nhas entered into a diverse range of cooperation \r\nagreements. In particular, I wish to emphasize the \r\nimportant role played by such organizations as \r\nUNESCO, whose programmes and activities in the area \r\nof cultural cooperation are undoubtedly of value to the \r\nAlliance. \r\n I should also highlight the holding of Alliance of \r\nCivilizations forums in Madrid in 2008 and in Istanbul \r\nthis year. At the Forums, States and international \r\norganizations met with, inter alia, representatives of \r\ncivil society, the private sector and the media in an \r\ninnovative and dynamic format. The Alliance Forums \r\nhave also made it possible to launch specific \r\ninitiatives, projects and activities that are now fully \r\noperational. Our next meeting will be held in Rio de \r\nJaneiro, Brazil, in May 2010, in a clear demonstration \r\nof the spirit of universality pervading and prevailing at \r\nthe Alliance of Civilizations. We warmly welcome the \r\noffers of Qatar and Austria to host successive Forums \r\nin 2011 and 2012, respectively, because they ensure \r\nthat the initiative will continue in the coming years.  \r\n Another aspect that I wish to highlight is the \r\nregional dimension of the Alliance of Civilizations. \r\n A/64/PV.41\r\n \r\n21 09-59928 \r\n \r\nThe forthcoming Sarajevo conference, to be held in \r\nDecember, will enable us to lay the groundwork for the \r\ndevelopment of a regional strategy for South-Eastern \r\nEurope within the framework of the Alliance. The \r\nobjectives of the conference will be to share \r\nexperiences and promote the adoption of initiatives and \r\nprojects to enhance intercultural and interreligious \r\nunderstanding, tolerance, dialogue and cooperation in \r\norder to help prevent or overcome conflicts in an area \r\nof the European continent greatly in need of just such \r\ninitiatives. Moreover, in the effort to enhance the \r\nAlliance’s regional aspect, much commendable work is \r\nbeing done by Governments, international \r\norganizations and civil society in the Mediterranean \r\nregion and Latin America. \r\n Given the growth and the potential of the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations, we believe, together with \r\nTurkey, that the General Assembly must now provide \r\nrenewed support and momentum to the initiative by \r\nadopting this draft resolution. As the Secretary-General \r\nrecalled in his letter dated 23 June 2009 conveying to \r\nthe President of the General Assembly the report of the \r\nHigh Representative (A/63/914), the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations was established under the auspices of the \r\nUnited Nations, at the initiative of the Governments of \r\nSpain and Turkey, to counteract divisions and \r\npolarization within and between societies. The Alliance \r\nof Civilizations seeks to be an instrument of preventive \r\ndiplomacy that works to reduce tensions and bridge \r\ncultural divides. \r\n I wish to conclude by thanking all sponsors of the \r\ndraft resolution and by expressing our hope that it will \r\nbe adopted by consensus by the General Assembly.  \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of the Philippines to introduce draft \r\nresolution A/64/L.15. \r\n Mr. Davide (Philippines): At the outset, let me \r\nplace on record how pleased we were to note the \r\nannouncement in the opening statement made by the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly, under agenda \r\nitem 49, of his decision to convene an informal \r\nthematic debate on the dialogue among civilizations, \r\nreligions and cultures next year. We thank him for that \r\nvery wise decision. It will enhance all initiatives on the \r\nculture of peace. \r\n I have the honour and the special privilege to \r\nintroduce, on behalf of Pakistan and the Philippines, as \r\nthe main sponsors, and of the other sponsors, draft \r\nresolution A/64/L.15, entitled “Promotion of \r\ninterreligious and intercultural dialogue, understanding \r\nand cooperation for peace”, under agenda item 49, \r\n“Culture of peace”. It is our modest contribution to the \r\nglobal and collective effort to put an end to the culture \r\nof hate, violence, distrust, intolerance and religious and \r\ncultural misunderstanding that still plagues many parts \r\nof the world, and instead to build a world and \r\ncivilization of love, understanding, respect, tolerance, \r\nharmony and peace. It is a vision inspired by one of the \r\ngoals enshrined in the United Nations Charter: to \r\npractice tolerance and live together as good \r\nneighbours. It is a recognition of God’s plan for the \r\nworld as one human family. It is an expression of our \r\nfidelity to the opening paragraph of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, which affirms that \r\nrecognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and \r\ninalienable rights of all members of the human family \r\nis the foundation of freedom, justice and peace. \r\n The draft resolution updates resolution 63/22, \r\nbearing the same title, which the General Assembly \r\nadopted last year by consensus. Allow me to briefly \r\nhighlight the new elements in draft resolution \r\nA/64/L.15. \r\n First, let me recall that, in resolution 63/22, the \r\nGeneral Assembly invited UNESCO, in consultation \r\nwith Member States, to play a leading role in the \r\npreparations for the celebration of the International \r\nYear for the Rapprochement among Cultures in 2010. \r\nIn that connection, we welcome the decision taken by \r\nthe General Conference of UNESCO on 23 October \r\n2009 approving the action plan for the celebration of \r\nthe International Year of Rapprochement among \r\nCultures in 2010. In our draft resolution, we encourage \r\nUNESCO, as well as United Nations Member States, \r\nother organizations and institutions and civil society, to \r\njoin the celebration of the Year to demonstrate our firm \r\ncommitment to interreligious, intercultural and \r\nintercivilizational dialogue for peace. We also request \r\nthe Secretary-General to organize a special event to \r\nlaunch the celebration of the Year.  \r\n Secondly, we commend the focal point in \r\ninterreligious, intercultural and intercivilizational \r\nmatters in the Secretariat for ably discharging its \r\nmandate. At the same time, we recognize the \r\nimportance for it to interact and coordinate further with \r\nthe relevant entities of the United Nations system and \r\nto coordinate their contributions to the expanding \r\nintergovernmental processes on interfaith and \r\nA/64/PV.41  \r\n \r\n09-59928 22 \r\n \r\nintercultural dialogue, understanding and cooperation \r\nfor peace. With the proliferation of interfaith dialogue \r\nprocesses around the world, including at the national, \r\nregional and interregional levels, and the increasing \r\ninteraction of United Nations agencies with faith \r\ncommunities as their vital partners in the pursuit of \r\ntheir respective mandates, the focal point in the \r\nSecretariat could more effectively deliver on its tasks if \r\nit were adequately empowered. \r\n Thirdly, we call for further work on the proposal \r\nfor a United Nations decade of interreligious and \r\nintercultural dialogue, understanding and cooperation \r\nfor peace, for which civil society has clamoured, \r\nspearheaded by a coalition of more than 60 religious \r\nbodies and multi-faith and values-based organizations \r\nrepresenting all the world’s faith traditions uniting \r\nmillions of their faithful across the globe.  \r\n The increasing plurality of spiritual and religious \r\ninitiatives seeking to achieve peace and harmony in the \r\nworld represents a positive development in expanding \r\nthe frontiers of our partnerships with all relevant \r\nstakeholders. The proposed United Nations decade \r\nwould thus bring together diverse initiatives and \r\nactivities around a defined set of shared objectives \r\nespoused principally by the United Nations: peace, \r\ndevelopment and the promotion of human dignity. \r\n Fourthly, we request that the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, in keeping with one of the priorities \r\nof his presidency, to hold an interactive thematic \r\ndebate on interreligious, intercultural and \r\nintercivilizational understanding, inviting leaders of \r\nthe world’s major religions and representatives of \r\nfaith-based organizations to participate in this event. \r\n Fifthly and finally, we celebrate this year the \r\nInternational Year of Reconciliation, in accordance \r\nwith resolution 61/17, which was a response by the \r\nGeneral Assembly to the urgent need for reconciliation \r\nprocesses in countries and regions of the world that \r\nhave suffered or are suffering conflicts that have \r\ndivided societies. This process would rely on such \r\nmechanisms as dialogue among opponents as an \r\nessential element of peace and reconciliation. \r\n Reconciliation is the pervasive theme of our \r\nupdated draft resolution. We should not let this \r\nInternational Year of Reconciliation pass by as a mere \r\nfootnote for the future. We should ensure that there be \r\nfollow-up on this work, given the sheer importance of \r\nreconciliation not only to our national life but also in \r\nour individual and personal lives. \r\n Our draft resolution therefore calls on States \r\nMembers of the United Nations, following the \r\ncommemoration of the International Year of \r\nReconciliation in 2009, to further promote \r\nreconciliation to help to ensure durable peace and \r\nsustained development through such reconciliatory \r\nsteps as forgiveness and compassion. \r\n Many of us pray daily for forgiveness as we \r\nforgive others. There can be no reconciliation without \r\nforgiveness and compassion. Let me stress, however, \r\nthat forgiveness and compassion should never condone \r\ninjustice. There can be no forgiveness without \r\ndialogue. There can be no dialogue without respect and \r\nmutual understanding. \r\n Let me conclude by stressing that the United \r\nNations must pursue peace along two separate but \r\nparallel routes or means: the political, through the tools \r\nof politics, and the faith-driven, through interfaith or \r\ninterreligious dialogue. This dialogue provides the \r\ninternal force that can work out a faster and surer \r\nformula for building a world of freedom, justice and \r\npeace, and a civilization of love, thereby giving life to \r\nwhat the Psalmist envisioned — a world where love \r\nand truth will meet and justice and peace will kiss.  \r\n Since religions are united in one abiding faith —\r\nfaith in One God, holy, immortal and sovereign — this \r\ninterfaith dialogue has internal force no Government \r\ncan provide. That power can fortify our faith, unite \r\npeoples of different religions and cultures and make \r\nthem understand each other better, deepen humility and \r\nerase pride, hate anger and intolerance. It uplifts our \r\nhopes in times of crisis. I would thus like to request \r\nonce more, on behalf of the main and other sponsors of \r\nour draft resolution, that we adopt it, after adequate \r\nconsultations, by consensus, as we have done annually \r\nsince 2004. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Pakistan to also introduce draft \r\nresolution A/64/L.15. \r\n Mr. Sial (Pakistan): The agenda item entitled \r\n“Culture of peace” recalls the commitment made by \r\nour fellow brothers and sisters 64 years ago under the \r\nCharter of the United Nations to practise tolerance and \r\nlive together in peace with one another as good \r\nneighbours, to unite their strengths to maintain \r\n A/64/PV.41\r\n \r\n23 09-59928 \r\n \r\ninternational peace and security, and to promote social \r\nprogress and better standards of life in larger freedom.  \r\n The General Assembly adopted the Declaration \r\non a Culture of Peace on 13 September 1999 \r\n(resolution 53/243) to reaffirm these objectives and to \r\ncause a new era of hope and peaceful coexistence to \r\nunfold. The Declaration is a set of values, attitudes and \r\nbehaviours. It is based on the principles of multilateral \r\ncooperation in accordance with the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, respect for life, the ending of violence \r\nand the promotion and practice of non-violence \r\nthrough education, dialogue and cooperation, and \r\ncommitment to the peaceful settlement of disputes. \r\n Religions and cultures share a common set of \r\nuniversal values. Concepts of peace, tolerance, \r\nequality, sharing and respect for humanity are the core \r\nmessage of all world religions. Therefore, religion and \r\nculture must not be allowed to become a source of \r\ndivision, as they are sometimes portrayed in the \r\ncontext of contemporary life. We must cherish the \r\nunity and indivisibility of the human race and all \r\nhumankind, regardless of what religion or particular \r\nculture we belong to. \r\n Throughout history, greed and self-interest have \r\nresulted in inequities and tension among societies. This \r\nultimately leads to situations of conflict. Conflict can \r\nbe avoided only through understanding, sharing, \r\nsacrifice and dialogue among the parties concerned. We \r\nare aware that peace cannot be achieved without \r\ndialogue. The challenge we face every day is to replace \r\nfear with acceptance, harassment with tolerance, and \r\nhatred with respect. Cooperation — and not the clash \r\nof civilizations — must be the paradigm for our \r\ncollective endeavours. The promotion of \r\nunderstanding, harmony and cooperation among \r\nreligions and cultures is the indispensable avenue \r\nthrough which we can lift the veil of ignorance, \r\nmisconception and prejudice that has become so \r\ntragically pervasive in recent times. \r\n In today’s world, the need for interfaith dialogue, \r\ncooperation and harmony cannot be overemphasized in \r\nthe context of ongoing political and security disputes.  \r\n The multiple crises of finance, fuel and food have \r\nfurther aggravated the divide. In order to make our \r\nworld a better place, we must all share the \r\nresponsibility to highlight and propagate our common \r\nvalues of peace, tolerance, equality, sharing and respect \r\nfor humanity. \r\n Pakistan fully recognizes the growing need to \r\npromote religious and cultural harmony and the \r\nnecessity of interfaith dialogue. We have taken several \r\nimportant initiatives to promote dialogue and \r\nunderstanding among various faiths and religions at the \r\nnational level and in all major international forums, \r\nincluding the draft resolution we have jointly \r\nsponsored with the Philippines entitled “Promotion of \r\ninterreligious and intercultural dialogue, understanding \r\nand cooperation for peace” (A/64/L.15). \r\n I am confident that the draft resolution, as at \r\nprevious sessions, will be adopted unanimously by the \r\nGeneral Assembly. This in a way will be an affirmation \r\nby the members of the international community of their \r\nshared commitment to advancing the goals of universal \r\nunderstanding, harmony and peace, as well as security \r\nand prosperity among all nations and peoples of all \r\nfaiths and cultures. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of South Africa to introduce draft \r\nresolution A/64/L.13. \r\n Mr. Sangqu (South Africa): On behalf of the \r\nGovernment and people of South Africa, I have the \r\nhonour and privilege to introduce draft resolution \r\nA/64/L.13 designating 18 July, the birthday of Nelson \r\nMandela, as Nelson Mandela International Day. I do so \r\non behalf of all the sponsors listed in document \r\nA/64/L.13, and I thank these countries for their \r\nsponsorship and unwavering support. In particular, we \r\nwould like to thank the heads of State and Government \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement for their support for and \r\nendorsement of this initiative. \r\n Since the publication of this document, the \r\nfollowing countries have joined in sponsoring the draft \r\nresolution: Albania, Armenia, Austria, Barbados, \r\nBelarus, Belgium, Belize, Bhutan, Bulgaria, Cambodia, \r\nChad, Colombia, Côte d’Ivoire, Croatia, Cyprus, the \r\nCzech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, \r\nGreece, Guyana, Honduras, Hungary, Kazakhstan, \r\nLatvia, Lithuania, Malta, Monaco, Montenegro, the \r\nNetherlands, New Zealand, Paraguay, Poland, the \r\nRepublic of Moldova, Romania, Saint Lucia, Samoa, \r\nSan Marino, Seychelles, Slovakia, Slovenia, Solomon \r\nIslands, Spain, Sweden, Turkmenistan and the United \r\nArab Emirates. The total is thus over 160 sponsors. We \r\nthank them all equally.  \r\n On 18 July 2009, millions of people from across \r\nthe globe came together to give 67 minutes or more of \r\nA/64/PV.41  \r\n \r\n09-59928 24 \r\n \r\ntheir time in community service, their actions inspired \r\nby the life’s work of Nelson Mandela. In turn, the \r\nactions of these million of people, men, women and \r\nyouth across the globe and from all sectors of society, \r\nhave inspired us to introduce this draft resolution to the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n During the dark days of apartheid, Nelson \r\nRolihlahla Mandela said, “To be free is not merely to \r\ncast off one’s chains but to live in a way that respects \r\nand enhances the freedom of others”. When the chains \r\nof apartheid were severed in our country, he embodied \r\nthese words, showing that both the victors and the \r\nvanquished could live in peace. Mandela’s leadership \r\nthrough South Africa’s most terrible and triumphant \r\ntimes is enough to make him an enduring hero in our \r\nhistory books.  \r\n His legacy however, is even larger than this. \r\nThrough his extraordinary actions and personality, he \r\nhas become a moral compass that we can all look up to. \r\nIndeed, Nelson Mandela is an international icon and a \r\nsymbol of hope for oppressed and marginalized people \r\nacross the globe. He has dedicated his life to the \r\nservice of humanity and has contributed greatly to the \r\npromotion of the culture of peace throughout the \r\nworld. Nelson Mandela worked tirelessly in the \r\nstruggle for democracy and for the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights internationally. Nelson \r\nMandela’s contribution to conflict resolution, \r\nreconciliation, the rights of children and uplifting the \r\npoor is acknowledged across the world. He has been \r\nbestowed with numerous awards and honours, \r\nincluding the Nobel Peace Prize. But even at such \r\ntimes of great recognition, he has been selfless. A \r\nmemorable example of that was when he dedicated his \r\nNobel Peace Award to “all the courageous people of \r\nmy country, black and white, who have suffered and \r\nendured so much”.  \r\n Nelson Mandela has become one of the greatest \r\nleaders who have supported and steadfastly promoted \r\nthe ideals of the United Nations. The ideals of the \r\nUnited Nations, represented by the victory of unity \r\nover division and of negotiation over confrontation, are \r\nthe ideals mirrored by Nelson Mandela throughout his \r\nlife. \r\n Perhaps the only fitting way to pay tribute to this \r\ngreat man is to look back at his public and political \r\nlife. Therefore, permit me to provide some glimpses of \r\nNelson Mandela through his own words.  \r\n On 20 April 1964, standing trial in Rivonia for \r\ntreason for leading the African National Congress’s \r\nstruggle against the apartheid State, Nelson Mandela \r\nspoke for hours in his own defence, knowing that a \r\nsentence of death was a possibility. He said, \r\n  “I have fought against white domination and \r\nI have fought against black domination. I have \r\ncherished the ideals of a democratic and free \r\nsociety in which all persons live together in \r\nharmony and with equal opportunities; it is an \r\nideal, which I hope to live for and to achieve. But \r\nif needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared \r\nto die.”  \r\n Upon his release from brutal and inhumane \r\nincarceration for 27 years, Nelson Mandela addressed \r\nthe South African people and said, \r\n  “I stand here before you not as a prophet but \r\nas a humble servant of you, the people. Your \r\ntireless and heroic sacrifices have made it \r\npossible for me to be here today. I therefore place \r\nthe remaining years of my life in your hands.”  \r\n He had one regret that day, however. There were \r\nso many reporters and cameras and supporters around \r\nhim the moment he set foot from prison that he did not \r\nhave a chance to say goodbye to the prison staff, whom \r\nhe cherished because they had been his only link to \r\nhumanity for so long. \r\n On 10 May 1994, Nelson Mandela stood tall \r\nbefore a crowd of people in Pretoria after taking the \r\noath of office as the first democratically elected \r\nPresident of a free South Africa, and said, “The time \r\nfor the healing of the wounds has come. The moment \r\nto bridge the chasms that divide us has come. The time \r\nto build is upon us”.  \r\n Having decided to retire from public office, \r\nMandela addressed the General Assembly of the United \r\nNations on 21 September 1998 for the final time. He \r\nstated that the social ills of the world do not stem from \r\nthe forces of nature or a curse of the deities, but from \r\nthe decisions that people make or refuse to make, and \r\nhe urged that all those in this great Hall \r\n “not allow that any should be denied their \r\nfreedom, as we were; that any should be turned \r\ninto refugees, as we were; that any should be \r\ncondemned to go hungry, as we were; that any \r\nshould be stripped of their human dignity, as we \r\nwere” (A/53/PV.7, p. 16). \r\n A/64/PV.41\r\n \r\n25 09-59928 \r\n \r\nHe went on to say: \r\n “Then would history and the billions throughout \r\nthe world proclaim that it was right that we \r\ndreamt and that we toiled to give life to a \r\nworkable dream” (ibid.). \r\n Nelson Mandela is not a god or a saint. He is \r\nsimply a man who has acted in a manner that is a little \r\nwiser, a little stronger and a little better than the rest of \r\nus. This is evident from his words in his seminal \r\nbiography, Long Walk to Freedom: \r\n  “I have walked that long road to freedom. I \r\nhave tried not to falter; I have made missteps \r\nalong the way. But I have discovered the secret \r\nthat after climbing a great hill, one only finds that \r\nthere are many more hills to climb. I have taken a \r\nmoment here to rest, to steal a view of the \r\nglorious vista that surrounds me, to look back on \r\nthe distance I have come. But I can rest only for a \r\nmoment, for with freedom comes responsibilities, \r\nand I dare not linger, for my long walk is not yet \r\nended.”  \r\n It is in this spirit that we, the people of South \r\nAfrica, pledge to work together in reviving ubuntu, to \r\ncreate a better society for all and to make a positive \r\ncontribution to humanity, built on compassion, \r\nhumility, respect, forgiveness and unity. \r\n The adoption of this draft resolution by the \r\nGeneral Assembly should serve as a constant reminder \r\nof the need to answer the question Nelson Mandela \r\nposed to this Assembly when he said, \r\n  “The great challenge of our age to the \r\nUnited Nations is to answer the question ‘Given \r\nthe interdependence of the nations of the world, \r\nwhat is it that we can and must do to ensure that \r\ndemocracy, peace and prosperity prevail \r\neverywhere?’” (A/49/PV.14, p. 8) \r\n It is our hope that the entire membership of the \r\nUnited Nations will support and sponsor the draft \r\nresolution before us, and that every year, beginning in \r\n2010, the United Nations and the billions of people \r\nrepresented here will celebrate 18 July as Nelson \r\nMandela International Day. In doing so, we make the \r\nmoral compass of Nelson Mandela a little brighter and \r\nbigger so that we can see it all the more clearly as we \r\nstrive in this great Hall to realize the workable dream \r\nof Nelson Mandela. Halala, Madiba, Halala.  \r\n Mr. Lidén (Sweden): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of the European Union. \r\n Not every generation is fortunate enough to \r\nwitness the emergence of a figure of unique \r\ninternational standing who has a profound impact on the \r\nlives of people across the world. The European Union \r\nwould like to pay tribute to the extensive personal \r\nachievements of Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela — a man \r\nwho has come to symbolize the triumph of hope over \r\ndespair, of justice over oppression and of peace over \r\nconflict. \r\n Nelson Mandela’s incredible story of personal \r\nsacrifice and his achievements for South Africa are \r\nwell known to everyone in this Hall and will forever be \r\nremembered with the greatest respect by all democratic \r\nnations. As the representative of South Africa just \r\nquoted, Nelson Mandela was ready to die for his ideals \r\nof a democratic and free society in which all persons \r\nlive together in harmony and with equal opportunities. \r\nFortunately, he has had a long life, and throughout his \r\nlife he has lived to realize those ideals.  \r\n Mandela’s steadfast perseverance and his \r\ncommitment to these ideals and to living in a \r\ndemocratic and free society continue to stand out for \r\nall those around the world who are still denied their \r\nhuman rights and their fundamental freedoms. We hope \r\nthat all prisoners of conscience, wherever they are, will \r\none day be able to enjoy the freedom that is denied to \r\nthem and that was denied to Mandela for too many \r\nyears. \r\n Mr. Mandela’s work to build peace and to \r\npromote reconciliation at the national level has rightly \r\nbeen recognized by awards of the most prestigious \r\nnature, including the Nobel Peace Prize. The legacy of \r\nhis struggle for social justice and his efforts to combat \r\nHIV and AIDS continue to this day. We salute these \r\nachievements. \r\n What sets him apart is also his ability to touch the \r\nhearts of ordinary people. Many of us remember the \r\nlong years of Mr. Mandela’s incarceration, and we \r\nwere shaped by the example he set for us. His dignity \r\nand compassion in the face of seemingly overwhelming \r\nchallenges have made people realize what an \r\nindividual and what humankind as a whole can \r\nachieve. \r\n Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt): I have the pleasure of \r\nspeaking today on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement \r\nA/64/PV.41  \r\n \r\n09-59928 26 \r\n \r\nin the general debate under agenda item 49, entitled \r\n“Culture of peace”, to convey the Movement’s full \r\nendorsement of the initiative to designate 18 July every \r\nyear as Nelson Mandela International Day, as \r\nstipulated in draft resolution A/64/L.13. \r\n Many leaders have changed the future of their \r\ncountries with their vision, commitment and \r\ndetermination, but few leaders have affected the course \r\nof history. From a small village on the outskirts of the \r\ncity of Umtata, Transkei, in the Kaffraria region of \r\nSouth Africa, the young Mandela learned the meaning \r\nof life and freedom. Named Nelson on his first day of \r\nschool by his teacher, Mandela still proved to be \r\nworthy of the name given him at birth, Rolihlahla, \r\nwhich can be translated as Troublemaker.  \r\n With the enactment of apartheid laws in 1948, \r\none of the worst forms of racial discrimination in \r\nhistory was institutionalized. It was thus not a \r\ncoincidence that Mandela joined the freedom fighters \r\nof his homeland in pursuit of justice and equality. The \r\nprice was high, but his sense of purpose was much \r\nhigher. Despite his initial commitment to non-violent \r\nresistance, like many generations in South Africa that \r\nwere influenced by Mahatma Ghandi’s teachings and \r\nmethods, Mandela was detained for five years on \r\ncharges of treason. After his acquittal, he found no \r\nalternative but to resort to armed struggle against the \r\nracist regime. He became the leader of the Spear of the \r\nNation, the armed wing of the African National \r\nCongress, only to be convicted of treason a year later.  \r\n Mandela’s philosophy in life was forged on \r\nRobben Island, from which he emerged a mediator, a \r\nNobel Peace Prize laureate and the first black President \r\nof South Africa. Twenty-seven years behind bars made \r\nhim a worldwide symbol of resistance to racism who \r\nlives on to inspire ongoing efforts all around the world \r\nto eliminate all forms of racism, racial discrimination, \r\nxenophobia and related intolerance.  \r\n Mandela has been one of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement leaders who have played an instrumental \r\nand active role over the years on issues of concern and \r\nvital importance to its members, such as decolonization, \r\napartheid, the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity, disarmament and the situation in the Middle \r\nEast, including the question of Palestine.  \r\n The heads of State and Government of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement, at their fifteenth summit, held \r\nin Sharm el-Sheikh, recognized Mandela’s leading role \r\nin and support for Africa’s struggle for liberation, self-\r\ndetermination and unity and his outstanding \r\ncontribution to the creation of a non-racial, non-sexist \r\nand democratic South Africa. They further recognized \r\nhis values and dedication to the service of humanity as \r\na humanitarian in the fields of conflict resolution, race \r\nrelations, the promotion and protection of human \r\nrights, reconciliation, gender equality, and the rights of \r\nchildren and other groups in vulnerable situations, and \r\nin uplifting the poor and underdeveloped communities.  \r\n In an unprecedented move, the heads of State and \r\nGovernment of the Non-Aligned Movement unanimously \r\nadopted a special declaration at the Sharm el-Sheikh \r\nsummit, expressing their support for and solidarity \r\nwith the Nelson Mandela International Day campaign. \r\nThey called on Non-Aligned Movement member States \r\nand peoples to join in the campaign, including by \r\ncontributing 67 minutes of their time in service to their \r\ncommunities, in recognition of Madiba’s 67 years of \r\ncontribution in service of humanity. The leaders \r\nendorsed the call to designate 18 July, Madiba’s \r\nbirthday, as Nelson Mandela International Day and \r\nrequested that a draft resolution to this effect be \r\nadopted by the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth \r\nsession. \r\n Humankind has suffered various social maladies \r\nthat have, regrettably, been related more often that not \r\nto race, colour, sex and religion, and which have \r\nresulted in numerous historic atrocities. Despite the \r\nserious steps taken by many countries to implement the \r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Abolition of Slavery \r\nand the International Convention on the Elimination of \r\nAll Forms of Racial Discrimination, and despite the \r\nprogress made so far in realizing the universality of the \r\ninternational covenants on human rights, we continue \r\nto witness the growth of new forms of bigotry and \r\nracism in our world today. Guided by Mandela’s vision \r\nand struggle, the ongoing deliberations within the \r\nHuman Rights Council on the development of standards \r\ncomplementary to the International Convention on the \r\nElimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination are \r\nthus of paramount importance, as they would \r\ncontribute to rebuilding confidence and combating all \r\nforms of discrimination across the globe. \r\n It is indeed necessary to complement our efforts \r\nin implementing our common commitments under the \r\n2001 Durban Declaration and Programme of Action \r\nand the outcome document of the Review Conference \r\nin April 2009. Our endeavours in this regard should \r\n A/64/PV.41\r\n \r\n27 09-59928 \r\n \r\navoid any attached conditionalities that seek to impose \r\ncontroversial notions which lack legal grounds, fail to \r\ntake into account the divergent social, cultural and \r\nvalue systems of different societies, or link such \r\nnotions to development assistance programmes. The \r\nNon-Aligned Movement believes that it will be \r\npossible to eliminate these negative phenomena only \r\nthrough the consolidation of the international \r\ncommunity’s resolve and action in the context of a \r\nmultifaceted approach, in tandem with our efforts to \r\nreinforce the principles of democracy and respect for \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms.  \r\n Enhancing cooperation at the international level \r\nto promote dialogue, mutual understanding and \r\nenlightened education is of equally great importance \r\nand should be based on a framework of partnership and \r\ncooperation among non-governmental organizations, \r\nthe private sector and national institutions and \r\nassociations. It is crucial in this regard to continue our \r\nefforts to promote the freedom of expression according \r\nto our commitments under existing international human \r\nrights instruments in a manner that prevents the \r\nexacerbation of the sentiments of hatred and racism \r\nand that encourages intellectuals and the media to \r\nshoulder their responsibilities in building awareness, \r\neducating communities and confronting the trends that \r\npromote intolerance and conflict. \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement looks forward to the \r\ndesignation by the United Nations of 18 July as the \r\nannual Nelson Mandela International Day. The \r\nMovement hopes that the observance of this day will \r\nnot only acknowledge the history of his great leadership, \r\nbut also become a reminder of the international \r\ncommunity’s commitment to exerting its utmost efforts \r\nto fulfil its pledge to combat all forms of racism, racial \r\ndiscrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and \r\nto spread the culture of peace. \r\n The meeting rose at 6.05 p.m. \r\n"
