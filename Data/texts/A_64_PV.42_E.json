(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) \r\n \r\n \r\n In the absence of the President, Mr. Sangqu \r\n(South Africa), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 49 (continued) \r\n \r\nCulture of peace \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/64/325) \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/64/312) \r\n \r\n  Draft resolutions (A/64/L.5, A/64/L.13, \r\nA/64/L.14 and A/64/L.15)  \r\n \r\n Mr. Kleib (Indonesia): My delegation would like \r\nto thank the Secretary-General for his report \r\n(A/64/325) on interreligious and intercultural dialogue, \r\nunderstanding and cooperation for peace. We are also \r\ngrateful for the annual progress report of the Director-\r\nGeneral of UNESCO on the International Decade for a \r\nCulture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of \r\nthe World, 2001-2010 (see A/64/312).  \r\n My delegation would like to associate itself with \r\nthe statement delivered earlier by the representative of \r\nEgypt on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement. \r\n Dialogue among peoples, cultures, faiths and \r\ncivilizations is essential for the growth of a global \r\nculture of peace. Dialogue is a very important human \r\nprocess, and we must invest considerable resources and \r\nour best efforts in promoting it. A true dialogue must \r\naddress age-old grievances and confront false \r\nstereotypes, without presumption or preconditions. \r\nIndeed, through a substantive dialogue, conflict can be \r\nresolved, peace can be attained and sustained, \r\npartnership can work, and community can be built. \r\n But we have to do better than just bringing people \r\nof different faiths and cultures together. We must \r\nactively promote dialogue and take concrete steps to \r\nenhance mutual understanding and cooperation among \r\ndiverse civilizations, translating the shared values of \r\npeace, compassion and tolerance through the fields of \r\neducation, culture, media and religion and in our \r\nsociety. \r\n We in Indonesia make use of dialogue among the \r\nvarious communal groups, not only to ensure harmony \r\nand national stability, but also to promote national \r\ndevelopment. In fact, development, for us, is not purely \r\nan economic process. It is not enough to attempt to \r\nsimply lift people from their poverty. We must also \r\nredeem them from narrow-mindedness and from \r\nprejudice and intolerance. This means that there can be \r\nno true development without a broad educational \r\nprocess that enables everyone to see themselves not \r\nonly in terms of their own religion, but in terms of the \r\nfaiths of others. \r\n Beyond our national boundaries, we also have \r\nlaunched various dialogues among faiths, cultures and \r\ncivilizations in subregional and regional frameworks, \r\nsuch as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the \r\nAsia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and the Asia-\r\nEurope Meeting. We have also launched bilateral \r\ninterfaith initiatives with many countries of different \r\ncultures. \r\nA/64/PV.42  \r\n \r\n09-60000 2 \r\n \r\n Indonesia also attaches great significance to the \r\ninitiatives by Member States to promote respect for \r\ndiversity, freedom, justice and tolerance, as these are \r\nall important parts of the global web of cooperation \r\naimed at promoting faith-based peace and harmony. \r\n While there is no denying that freedom of \r\nexpression is a basic universal right that must continue \r\nto be protected and promoted, it is enjoyed best if used \r\nresponsibly and with the highest interests of all in \r\nmind. That right should not in any way cause \r\ndisaffection or offend others. Freedom of expression is \r\na political, social and economic imperative, but it is not \r\nan absolute freedom. No freedom is absolute. \r\n Freedom of expression is limited by, among other \r\nthings, the right of communities to preserve the dignity \r\nof their beliefs and their cultural ways. Hence, no \r\ngroup or individual should be allowed to make an \r\nobject of ridicule of anything that is sacred to a \r\ncommunity’s religion. \r\n We must therefore strive for a judicious balance \r\nbetween the right to free expression and the demands \r\nof cultural sensitivity. For that matter, we must balance \r\nevery right that we enjoy with a matching right to \r\nwhich others are entitled. \r\n In this regard, we attach great importance to the \r\nrole of the media in nurturing social harmony, as mass \r\nmedia can be the messenger either of peace and \r\ntolerance or of misunderstanding and discord. In \r\nrecognizing the role of mass media in combating \r\nignorance and prejudice between faiths, cultures and \r\ncivilizations, we initiated a series of global inter-media \r\ndialogues, with Norway as our co-sponsor, to sensitize \r\nthe mass media and enable it to become an effective \r\ninstrument for the promotion of mutual understanding \r\nand appreciation among the world’s different faiths and \r\ncultures. \r\n Believing that interfaith and intercultural dialogue \r\nand cooperation are too important to be left only in the \r\ngood hands of Governments, we also encourage \r\nnon-governmental actors and various civil society \r\ngroups, including faith-based organizations, to play an \r\nactive role in the quest for harmony. \r\n The delegation of Indonesia firmly believes in the \r\ncontinued potential of the global campaign, be it of an \r\ninterreligious, intercultural or intercivilizational nature, \r\nand in using the campaign as a tool to achieve harmony \r\nand tolerance in interpersonal as well as inter-State \r\nrelationships. Bridges among peoples and groups must \r\nbe encouraged and constructed. \r\n The more intensive and extensive the dialogue \r\nand cooperation, the brighter the outlook for humankind. \r\nMuch of the future of humankind depends on peaceful \r\ncoexistence and cooperation among civilizations, \r\ncultures and faiths. It is therefore only fitting that we \r\nremain seized of this issue. \r\n It is within this context that our delegation fully \r\nsupports the four draft resolutions under the agenda \r\nitem entitled “Culture of peace”, which have been \r\nintroduced by the delegation of Bangladesh (A/64/L.5), \r\nthe delegation of South Africa (A/64/L.13), the \r\ndelegations of Spain and Turkey (A/64/L.14) and the \r\ndelegations of the Philippines and Pakistan (A/64/L.15), \r\nrespectively. We look forward to the adoption of those \r\ndraft resolutions by consensus. \r\n Mr. Kim Bonghyun (Republic of Korea): \r\nToday, as increasing technological and cultural \r\ninterconnectedness brings us all closer, it is imperative \r\nto reflect on both the shared differences we have and \r\nthe deeper, more lasting universal similarities that we \r\nall share. These similarities are grounded in peace and \r\ncoexistence and form a stronger historical backbone \r\nthan strife between diverse groups and religions. \r\n In this regard, we must firmly resist the hard-\r\ndying thesis of an inevitable clash of civilizations, a \r\nthesis that still lingers around us. It needs to be \r\nrejected, as the world should be defined not by our \r\ndifferences and conflicts, but by our mutual humanity \r\nand similarities. Tolerance among various religions, \r\ncivilizations and cultures, as well as among those \r\nwithin certain societies, must be a cornerstone of that \r\nnecessary vision and a reality of the world moving \r\nforward. Against that backdrop, my delegation is happy \r\nto see the United Nations, through various forums, \r\nleading the way through a sustained and multifaceted \r\nvision under a culture of peace. \r\n The Republic of Korea supports the multilateral \r\nendeavours furthering the culture of peace among \r\nMember States and other various actors, including \r\ninternational organizations and civil society. They \r\ninclude a broad range of efforts that promote \r\ninterreligious and intercultural dialogue, such as the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations and notable UNESCO \r\ninitiatives geared towards fostering a culture of peace \r\nthrough education, via the implementation of the \r\nProgramme of Action on a Culture of Peace. \r\n A/64/PV.42\r\n \r\n3 09-60000 \r\n \r\n In that regard, my delegation wholeheartedly \r\nsupports the mandate and continuing activities of the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations. The Alliance of Civilizations \r\nhas, in a short amount of time, become a successful \r\ninitiative to foster cooperation and understanding of \r\nreligious and cultural differences through interfaith \r\ndialogue and the Group of Friends of the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations. As a member of the Group of Friends, \r\nthe Republic of Korea notes the success of the Istanbul \r\nforum last April and looks forward to the further gains \r\nthat will be made at the third forum, to be held in \r\nBrazil in 2010. With that in mind, it is my delegation’s \r\nhope that the Alliance of Civilizations can continue to \r\nbecome even more action-oriented, expand its scope of \r\nactivities in Asia and continue to bolster its work in the \r\nkey area of migration. \r\n Other recent activities, as highlighted in the \r\nreport of the Secretary-General (A/64/325), are also \r\nimportant to mention. The Republic of Korea supports \r\nthe continual educational, academic and research-based \r\nactivities undertaken in the spirit of a culture of peace \r\nby the United Nations University. Further extending its \r\nvisibility and forging additional joint initiatives with \r\nother institutions of higher learning will only facilitate \r\na more robust dissemination of the ideals of a culture \r\nof peace. \r\n Furthermore, my delegation commends the \r\ndynamic activities of the United Nations Population \r\nFund (UNFPA), as elucidated in the report of the \r\nSecretary-General. These activities brought together \r\ndiverse faith-based partners to address the multifaceted \r\nuniversal challenges that population presents for larger \r\ndevelopment and human rights issues. UNFPA work at \r\nthe international, regional and national levels should \r\ncontinue to be supported under the culture of peace \r\nbanner. \r\n With regard to the report of the UNESCO \r\nDirector-General on the International Decade for a \r\nCulture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of \r\nthe World, 2001-2010, transmitted by the note by the \r\nSecretary-General (A/64/312), the Republic of Korea \r\nnotes with satisfaction the gains made by UNESCO on \r\nthat important issue. We support the promotion by \r\nUNESCO of education as the driving force to provide a \r\nbase of understanding for children around the world to \r\ndefuse and recognize potential conflicts and to actively \r\npromote a culture of peace and non-violence, in line \r\nwith the human rights perspective. It should continue \r\nto be supported in every way possible. The UNESCO \r\ninterfaith and anti-violence programmes, technical \r\ncapacity-building in the field of information and \r\ncommunication technologies and promotion of gender \r\nequality and human rights are equally critical to \r\nachieving a culture of peace through cultural \r\neducation. \r\n My delegation notes with deep satisfaction that \r\nthe Asia-Pacific Centre for Education for International \r\nUnderstanding, located in Korea, since its establishment \r\nas a UNESCO category-2 institute, has been very much \r\nactive and successful in this field throughout the \r\nUNESCO International Decade for a Culture of Peace \r\nand Non-Violence for the Children of the World, \r\n2001-2010. The Centre has made significant \r\ncontributions to promoting the culture of peace by \r\nimplementing various education, training and exchange \r\nprogrammes for international understanding and \r\ncultural diversity in the Asia-Pacific region. \r\n Religion is a significant aspect of many societies \r\nand consequentially is a source of values for \r\nindividuals. For that very reason, we should view \r\nreligion as a source of peace and an underlying \r\nconnector as we seek common ground. All societies \r\nmust reject the dangerous exploitation or misuse of \r\nreligion by extremists who seek to use various \r\ninterpretations of religious doctrine as justifications for \r\nviolence, war, terror and separation. Interfaith and \r\nintercultural dialogue should replace divisiveness and \r\nmistrust as we move forward and strive for common \r\nground. In that connection, my delegation recommends \r\nutilizing regional approaches in fostering meaningful \r\ndialogue and cooperation. \r\n Korea has a long tradition of upholding the \r\npeaceful and harmonious coexistence of Western and \r\noriental religions. We have been participating in \r\nregional interfaith dialogues in such regional forums as \r\nthe Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) and the Conference \r\non Interaction and Confidence-building Measures in \r\nAsia. As part of our contribution to regional efforts for \r\ninterfaith dialogue, we successfully co-hosted, together \r\nwith Finland, the fifth ASEM Interfaith Dialogue, held \r\nin Seoul from 23 to 25 September 2009. In the Seoul \r\nstatement, adopted at the meeting, participants \r\nreaffirmed that the promotion of intercultural and \r\ninterfaith dialogues and the peaceful and harmonious \r\ncoexistence of different religions contribute significantly \r\nto the maintenance of international peace and security. \r\nA/64/PV.42  \r\n \r\n09-60000 4 \r\n \r\n The Republic of Korea will continue to support \r\nthe activities of the United Nations with a view to \r\nachieving a comprehensive culture of peace built on \r\ninterreligious and intercultural tolerance and \r\nunderstanding. Now is the time to consolidate cross-\r\ncultural bonds as a sustainable building block for \r\nachieving better social development, increased human \r\nrights and more robust international security for the \r\ngenerations of tomorrow. \r\n Mr. Sinhaseni (Thailand): Thailand associates \r\nitself with the statement by the representative of Egypt \r\non behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement (see \r\nA/64/PV.41), endorsing the initiative to declare 18 July \r\nof every year as Nelson Mandela International Day. It \r\nis indeed fitting and appropriate that the United \r\nNations recognize this great man’s values and his \r\ndedication to the service of humanity. He is truly an \r\ninternational icon of a culture of peace, equality and \r\ndemocracy. \r\n At the outset, my delegation wishes to thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his comprehensive report \r\n(A/64/325) on the activities carried out by the United \r\nNations system and on other major regional and global \r\ninitiatives to promote a culture of peace, which is a \r\ncritically important issue of our time. We welcome and \r\ncommend the role of the various United Nations \r\nentities — UNESCO, the United Nations Population \r\nFund, the Joint United Nations Programme on \r\nHIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the Office of the High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights and the United \r\nNations University, among others — in supporting \r\nintercultural and interreligious cooperation worldwide. \r\n Our thanks also go to the Director-General of \r\nUNESCO for his annual report (see A/64/312). My \r\ndelegation congratulates UNESCO and other agencies \r\nconcerned for the activities undertaken during the past \r\nyear to commemorate the International Decade for a \r\nCulture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of \r\nthe World, 2001-2010. \r\n My delegation highly appreciates the ongoing \r\nefforts to raise awareness on issues relating to \r\ninterreligious and intercultural dialogue, particularly \r\nthe proclamation of the year 2010 as the International \r\nYear for the Rapprochement of Cultures. We note that \r\nUNESCO has prepared a draft action plan. We agree \r\nwholeheartedly with the UNESCO Director-General on \r\nthe need for a holistic approach that would incorporate \r\nvarious United Nations agencies, Member States, civil \r\nsocieties and non-governmental organizations. We look \r\nforward to cooperating closely with UNESCO to \r\ntranslate the plan into concrete results. \r\n Thailand appreciates consultations under way on \r\nthe possibility of proclaiming a United Nations decade \r\nfor interreligious and intercultural dialogue. As one of \r\n23 Member States that responded to the Secretariat’s \r\ninvitation to submit views on the matter, Thailand \r\nwishes to reaffirm its full support for such an initiative. \r\nWe see it as another important initiative to promote \r\nsubstantial action on interreligious and intercultural \r\ndialogue. \r\n In our view a culture of peace, like peace itself, \r\nmust be built, continuously supported and sustained. \r\nHere, Thailand welcomes the active role of the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations, especially the increased \r\ncontribution of its Group of Friends and the \r\ndevelopment of its global civil society network. As an \r\noriginal member of the Alliance of Civilizations Group \r\nof Friends, we are pleased that, as noted by the \r\nSecretary-General, its membership has increased from \r\n85 to 103. This 21 per cent increase clearly \r\ndemonstrates the wide support of the international \r\ncommunity for the Alliance of Civilizations and its \r\nactivities. \r\n Of equal importance are efforts at the regional \r\nand multinational levels aimed at interfaith and \r\nintercultural cooperation. Thailand has always and will \r\ncontinue to actively participate in such efforts. In \r\nFebruary 2009, we hosted an Interfaith Cultural Youth \r\nCamp under the auspices of the Asia-Europe Meeting. \r\nNext year, 2010, Thailand will host the Third Asia-\r\nMiddle East Dialogue aimed at fostering mutual \r\nunderstanding between the two regions. \r\n It is our firm belief that efforts to promote a \r\nculture of peace must start at home before it can be \r\nexpanded and extended elsewhere. A solid foundation \r\nof institutional and legislative regulations and \r\nframeworks needs to be firmly laid to ensure the rights \r\nof people to enjoy cultural diversity and \r\nnon-discrimination. Thailand’s Constitution ensures the \r\nrights of all of our citizens to preserve their local \r\ncustoms, local wisdom, arts and cultures. The \r\nGovernment’s economic, social and judicial policy \r\nframeworks also place great importance on promoting \r\nsolidarity and understanding between peoples of \r\ndifferent religious and cultural backgrounds. \r\n A/64/PV.42\r\n \r\n5 09-60000 \r\n \r\n Thailand is firmly committed to promoting a \r\nculture of peace, both at home and abroad. Here in the \r\nUnited Nations, we have consistently supported and \r\nsponsored all resolutions on the agenda item “Culture \r\nof peace”. We will continue to work closely with the \r\nGeneral Assembly, the various United Nations bodies \r\nand all concerned in building a culture of peace based \r\non cultural and religious tolerance and cooperation. \r\n Ms. Dunlop (Brazil): A culture of peace cannot \r\nbe promoted without efforts aimed at bringing different \r\ncultures, traditions and ideas together in an alliance \r\nwith the common goal of peace, justice and \r\ndevelopment. Recognition and acceptance of diversity \r\ncan contribute to an enriched, peaceful and harmonious \r\nsociety. In this sense, the choice by the President of \r\n“Dialogue among civilizations for international peace, \r\nsecurity and development” as one of the main themes \r\nof his presidency is timely and pertinent. \r\n This is important, because we often see the \r\nmisuse of diversity in order to fuel discontent and \r\nconflict for spurious reasons. We have witnessed \r\ninstances when people of different ethnic, racial or \r\ncultural backgrounds clashed and did not reach mutual \r\nunderstanding. Those situations should not, however, \r\ndetract from the fact that diversity, when well \r\nmanaged, is not a liability; on the contrary, it is an \r\nasset. In order to realize the positive impact of \r\ndiversity, respect for human rights, fundamental \r\nfreedoms and democratic values must be at the core of \r\nGovernment policies. This is especially true in the area \r\nof education. By promoting knowledge about others, \r\neducation has a fundamental role in allaying \r\nmisperceptions, mistrust and conflict. \r\n For Brazil, a culture of peace is a culture of \r\ntolerance and respect for human rights, including \r\neconomic, social and cultural rights. We have to \r\nrecognize that on many occasions, lack of progress in \r\nrealizing those rights is at the root of discord among \r\ndifferent ethnic or cultural groups. The quest for better \r\nmutual understanding will have fewer chances at \r\nsuccess if poverty and hunger continue unresolved. \r\n Brazil is proud of the different races, traditions \r\nand cultures that have contributed to what we are today \r\nand shaped the Brazilian identity. We dare say, \r\ntherefore, that diversity can work for the well-being of \r\nthe society as a whole. It thus seemed natural that the \r\nThird Forum of the Alliance of Civilizations will take \r\nplace in Brazil. We are happy to announce that it will \r\nbe held in Rio de Janeiro on 28-29 May 2010, when the \r\ngeneral theme, “The Alliance of Civilizations: cultural \r\ndiversity as the path to peace”, will be discussed. \r\n As the Alliance moves from the Mediterranean to \r\nthe Atlantic for its Third Forum, we will have an \r\nopportunity to discuss ways to promote intercultural \r\ndialogue from the perspectives offered by a plurality of \r\ncultures. We are sure that the Third Forum of the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations will make a significant \r\ncontribution in our efforts towards a culture of peace. \r\n Mr. Midekssa (Ethiopia): I am pleased to make a \r\nstatement on the agenda item under consideration. My \r\ndelegation would like to express its appreciation and \r\nthanks the Secretary-General for his comprehensive \r\nreport (A/64/325), which provides a broad overview of \r\nthe various major activities carried out in pursuance of \r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions 63/22 and 63/113 over \r\nthe course of the past year. \r\n My delegation associates itself with the \r\nstatements made by the distinguished representatives \r\nof the Sudan and Egypt on behalf of the Group of 77 \r\nand China and the Non-Aligned Movement. \r\n As has been well described in the report of the \r\nSecretary-General, durable peace and prosperity can \r\nonly be secured through a continuous process of \r\ndialogue among peoples of different views and \r\ninterests. We all agree that, in our time as well as in the \r\npast, numerous conflicts have taken place among \r\npeoples in various parts of the world, partly owing to a \r\nlack of tolerance of differences in outlook, and it is \r\nonly through dialogue that such intolerance of \r\ndifferences can be overcome. The promotion of \r\ninteractive dialogue and understanding between and \r\namong the world’s major religions and cultures is a \r\nnoble idea to which we must all pay due respect and \r\ntowards which we must exert our concerted action and \r\nsustained commitment, so that we can attain our hope \r\nfor a peaceful world, where tolerance, respect and \r\naccommodation, rather than rejection and confrontation, \r\nprevail, and where misunderstandings based on \r\nignorance and fear between and among peoples are \r\nremoved. \r\n For us in Ethiopia, a spirit of tolerance and \r\nrespect among different cultures, ethnicities and faiths \r\nis fundamental to our way of life. As a matter of fact, \r\ngiven our multitude of languages, colours, religious \r\nbeliefs and customs, we even consider it a matter of \r\nsurvival, required in order to make sure that the nation \r\nA/64/PV.42  \r\n \r\n09-60000 6 \r\n \r\ncan continually hold itself together, as it has always \r\ndone throughout its long history. Nurturing mutual \r\naccommodation, understanding and respect between \r\nand among peoples of different cultures and faiths has \r\nindeed remained an engrained tradition. \r\n The Ethiopian Federal Constitution is firmly \r\nanchored on, among others, the principle of according \r\ngenuine recognition to and safeguarding individual \r\nidentities and rights, as well as ensuring the full \r\nrepresentation and participation of all groups and \r\npeoples in the country, along with an enshrined \r\ncommitment to the objective of promoting unity in \r\ndiversity. Thus, accommodating diverse identities, \r\nensuring the right to self-determination and the \r\nestablishment of a federal structure that effectively \r\ngives power to the grass-roots on the basis of those \r\nprinciples are but some of the major remarkable \r\nfeatures of the political system in place in Ethiopia \r\ntoday. \r\n With the adoption of the Ethiopian Federal \r\nConstitution, the peoples of Ethiopia have succeeded in \r\nfurther entrenching their age-long tradition and culture \r\nof peace and peaceful coexistence as a tolerant society, \r\nembracing and accommodating all sorts of differences \r\nin terms of cultural identity and religious beliefs. The \r\nprinciple of peaceful coexistence is one of the major \r\npillars upholding the Federal Constitution and the \r\nforeign policy of Ethiopia, which is currently, and will \r\nremain, the hub of peace and cooperation for mutual \r\nbenefit and development in its own region and beyond. \r\n It is indeed gratifying to know that, since its \r\nestablishment in 2005, the Alliance of Civilizations has \r\nmade considerable progress. My country had the \r\nopportunity to attend the Second Forum of the Alliance \r\nof Civilizations, which took place in the great historic \r\ncity of Istanbul, in which many dignitaries, high-\r\nranking officials and scholars participated. I have the \r\ngreat pleasure and honour to extend our profound \r\ngratitude to the Government of Turkey, as well as to \r\nthe United Nations, for having organized the meeting. \r\n I am pleased and honoured to state before this \r\ngathering that my country’s request to join the Group \r\nof Friends of the Alliance of Civilizations has been \r\nwarmly welcomed by the United Nations High \r\nRepresentative for the Alliance of Civilizations. The \r\nGovernment of Ethiopia deems it a high honour for our \r\ncountry to have joined the Group. Indeed, there is no \r\ngreater task for humanity than to work for a common \r\npurpose and enhance the noble aspirations of humanity \r\nfor an all-inclusive peace and mutual progress. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to reassure this body \r\nthat Ethiopia will always remain firmly committed to \r\nand will continue to be active in the pursuit of the \r\nparamount global objective of forging a true and \r\nmeaningful alliance among all the world’s great \r\ncivilizations. \r\n Mr. M’Beou (Togo) (spoke in French): “Since \r\nwars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of \r\nmen that the defences of peace must be constructed.” \r\nThat solemn statement, which is engraved in stone on \r\nthe walls of the UNESCO headquarters, places man \r\nface to face with his responsibilities in the maintenance \r\nand promotion of peace. For a long time, fortunately, \r\nUNESCO has invested much in seeking that peace by \r\ninitiating or facilitating meetings on the central theme \r\nof the culture of peace and interreligious dialogue.  \r\n My delegation would like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report on interreligious and \r\nintercultural dialogue, understanding and cooperation \r\nfor peace (A/64/325) and for his note on the \r\nInternational Decade for a Culture of Peace and \r\nNon-Violence for the Children of the World, 2001-\r\n2010 (A/64/312). Those two detailed reports allow us \r\nto better appreciate the diverse actions taken in various \r\nplaces to instruct people in the culture of peace.  \r\n My delegation would like to thank the United \r\nNations and its specialized agencies, in particular \r\nUNESCO, the United Nations Population Fund and the \r\nUnited Nations Development Programme, as well as \r\nthe Alliance of Civilizations, for the efforts that they \r\nare making on a daily basis to bring the followers of \r\nvarious religions to the same table.  \r\n If those initiatives have been directed primarily at \r\nadults, it is encouraging that for a number of years \r\nprogrammes have also been designed for children. In \r\nthis regard, the measures being taken by UNESCO to \r\nenhance the culture of peace through education deserve \r\nour support.  \r\n My delegation welcomes especially the Learning \r\nto Live Together initiative, an intercultural and \r\ninterreligious programme for teaching ethics, recently \r\npublished by UNESCO, UNICEF and the Arigatou \r\nFoundation for use by educators in teaching children \r\nrespect and understanding of different beliefs, religions \r\nand ethical systems. In that way, the child, who is \r\n A/64/PV.42\r\n \r\n7 09-60000 \r\n \r\nfather of the man, learns to accept the religious beliefs \r\nof others and to contribute to building a multireligious, \r\nmultiracial and multicultural society. \r\n As part of the attempt to seek peace through an \r\nunderstanding and respect for religions and beliefs, the \r\nleaders of the three main monotheistic religions have a \r\ncrucial role to play. If they all believe in the same God, \r\nthere is no reason why their individual practices to \r\nreach that God, however different they may be, should \r\nbe a source of division, hatred and even war. \r\n In this regard, my delegation applauds the high-\r\nlevel debate on cultural diversity and the link between \r\nreligion and terrorism that was held here in this very \r\nchamber last year on the initiative of the King of Saudi \r\nArabia, and in which leaders and dignitaries of the \r\nworld’s main religions took part (A/63/PV.46 and \r\nPV.47). On that occasion, stating that the religions \r\ncreated by God to bring happiness to humans should \r\nnot be a cause of unhappiness, the King of Saudi \r\nArabia said everything that needed to be said about the \r\nrole to be played by all to put an end to religion-based \r\nviolence and to establish peace and harmony among \r\nthe faithful of different religions (A/63/PV.46). \r\n Even before His Majesty King Abdullah Bin \r\nAbdulaziz Al Saud, His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI, \r\nin his statement to the General Assembly in this same \r\nHall on 18 April 2008, had addressed the subject of \r\ninterreligious dialogue, which he described as a \r\ndialogue of thought and of life (A/62/PV.95). That \r\ndialogue, he pointed out, must be acknowledged as the \r\nmeans by which the various components of society can \r\ncompare their points of view and reach a consensus on \r\nthe truth with regard to values and specific goals.  \r\n In my delegation’s view, it seems clear that the \r\nsimple fact that people belong to different religions \r\nmust not serve as a source of hatred or confrontation. \r\nThere need be no conflict at that level. Rather, what \r\nneed to be fought are the fundamentalism and the \r\nextremism that have appeared in some religions and \r\nthat, unfortunately, are increasingly gaining support. \r\nLaxness in that regard is suicidal for all societies and \r\ncultures. And the significance of dialogue is its \r\npotential to reverse the dangerous trend, since, as \r\nPresident Shimon Peres said, following up on King \r\nAbdullah, we cannot change the past, but we can \r\nchange the future, and that is possible by means of \r\npeace initiatives (see A/63/PV.46, p. 11).  \r\n Belonging to a religion is a fundamental right of \r\nevery human individual. It is an inherent right, and to \r\nprevent the manifestation of that right is a violation of \r\nhuman rights. The Charter of the United Nations and \r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights reaffirm \r\nthat right, which no country or religion, even less a \r\npeople, should violate. Article 2 of the Togolese \r\nConstitution says: “The Togolese Republic guarantees \r\nequality of all citizens before the law, regardless of \r\norigin, race, gender, social condition or religion. It \r\nrespects all political and philosophical opinions and all \r\nreligious beliefs.”  \r\n That is not a mere statement, because, in Togo, \r\nreligions live together in mutual understanding and in \r\npeace. Alongside our traditional religion, animism, are \r\nChristianity and Islam. On many occasions, in \r\nparticular during joyous or unhappy events, the faithful \r\nof those religions find themselves sitting side by side \r\nto express their joy or to show their compassion. It \r\ncannot be otherwise, since they live together in the \r\nsame neighbourhoods, and sometimes in the same \r\nhouses, without the slightest demonstration of hostility \r\ntowards each another on the basis of religion. That \r\nreligious solidarity at the national level is the fruit of \r\nthe work of political and religious leaders, and above \r\nall the Government, who have regularly set up \r\noccasions for brotherly meetings without consideration \r\nof religious belief.  \r\n Because my country understands the virtues of \r\ndialogue and knows that misunderstanding and \r\nintolerance bring about violence, it has always strived \r\nto peacefully settle everything that divides peoples and \r\nnations. Again today, my country, through me, states \r\nloud and clear that all nations must sow the seeds of \r\npeace in houses, temples, churches, mosques, pagodas \r\nand convents, in short in all places of worship, in order \r\nto free our world of religious wars and so that people \r\nare no longer victims of acts of terrorism based on \r\nreligion. \r\n For that reason, Togo has co-sponsored all draft \r\nresolutions that promote dialogue among religions and \r\na culture of peace (resolutions A/64/L.5, A/64/L.13, \r\nA/64/L.14 and A/64/L.15). Finally, my delegation \r\nsupports the recommendations contained in the note by \r\nthe Secretary-General on the International Decade for a \r\nCulture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of \r\nthe World, 2001-2010, issued under symbol A/64/312. \r\nIt believes that by teaching our children to show good \r\nunderstanding and tolerance of the lives of others, we \r\nA/64/PV.42  \r\n \r\n09-60000 8 \r\n \r\ncan hope to bequeath them a world of peace because, \r\nas the late President Houphouët-Boigny of Côte \r\nd’Ivoire said, peace is not a word, but must be and \r\nremain a way of behaving. \r\n Ms. Ross (United States of America): The United \r\nStates is proud to be among the sponsors of the draft \r\nresolution creating Nelson Mandela International Day \r\n(A/64/L.13). It is particularly fitting that we consider a \r\nday to honour that great man as part of our discussion \r\nabout the culture of peace. \r\n Nelson Mandela faced a regime of deep cruelty. \r\nIn the days of apartheid, the Government of South \r\nAfrica was not content to reign as autocrats. They \r\ncreated institutions with the semblance of democracy \r\nto cloak the most iron-fisted control. They warped \r\nscience and faith to justify the most basic bigotry. They \r\nenshrined discrimination and called it law. And from \r\nthe sprawling townships to the city where the oceans \r\nmeet and the clouds nestle on a mountain top, to the \r\nmines dug deep to plunder the nation’s gold and to the \r\nhaunting veldt of the beloved country, the dream of \r\ndemocracy was denied. \r\n Mandela saw a great evil and dedicated himself to \r\nbringing it down. In the long years spent jailed off the \r\ncoast of Cape Town, he continued to cherish the ideal \r\nof a democratic and free society, in which all persons \r\nlive together in harmony and with equal opportunities. \r\nThat was the ideal that he lived for and for which he \r\nwas prepared to die. \r\n A few months after Mandela’s arrival at the \r\nprison on Robben Island, his lawyer visited him there, \r\nonly to have his client march forth to meet him \r\nsurrounded by a phalanx of uniformed guards. With \r\nexquisite politeness, Mandela introduced his lawyer to \r\nhis so-called guard of honour. Mandela had already \r\nchosen to live in prison as if he were a free man. He \r\ndemanded to be treated with dignity, and he thereby \r\nreminded his foes of the common humanity shared \r\neven between victim and oppressor. What Mandela did \r\nfor his immediate captors, he would also do for those \r\nwho made his country a prison. Over time, Mandela \r\npersuaded his jailors to surrender the key. \r\n The years of confinement would surely have \r\ndriven most of us to despair and bitterness, but those \r\nyears on Robben Island were the time that he used to \r\nprepare, to sharpen his powers of persuasion and to \r\nplan his course. Apartheid was conceived in deceit and \r\nviolence, but it ended in truth and reconciliation. \r\nMandela used his moral power for moral purpose. He \r\nturned enemies into partners, fear into trust, hatred into \r\nforgiveness, and discrimination into democracy. And \r\nwhen Mandela walked out of prison free, he strode \r\nforth with smile flashing, back straight and shoulders \r\nunbowed.  \r\n There was no easy road to freedom for South \r\nAfrica, nor was the road easy for its great emancipator. \r\nMandela paid a high price over his long life: decades \r\nlost, personal happiness sacrificed, and a son lost to a \r\ndisease whose stigma Mandela was determined to end. \r\nSouth Africa became the rainbow nation of which \r\nMandela had dreamed — its flag today a tapestry of \r\ninterwoven colours. It still faces great challenges, some \r\nnew and some old, from the fight against HIV/AIDS \r\nthat Mandela championed to the struggle for deep, \r\nbroad and lasting prosperity. But South Africa faces \r\nthem with the great power of democratic rule and the \r\ngreat resources of its liberated citizens. The Republic \r\nof South Africa is finally a republic. \r\n My own nation was founded on the belief that all \r\npeople are created equal, and it still works to make real \r\nthe full promise of its founding. We see a hero and a \r\nkindred spirit in Mandela — a breaker of shackles, a \r\nbringer of forgiveness, a creator of hope. He knew that \r\njust and decent government requires the power of the \r\nmind but that reconciliation is a matter of the heart. \r\n So let me conclude by saying, in the words of the \r\ngreat anthem, Nkosi Sikelel’ iAfrika — God bless \r\nAfrica. God bless our work together to build a world of \r\njustice, peace and human dignity, to make real the \r\nideals to which Nelson Mandela dedicated his \r\nextraordinary life. Madiba, we thank you. \r\n Mr. Núñez Mosquera (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThe Cuban delegation associates itself with the \r\nstatement made by the Permanent Representative of \r\nEgypt on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) \r\n(see A/64/PV.41) and supports the adoption of the \r\nimportant draft resolution that declares 18 July as \r\nNelson Mandela International Day (A/64/L.13). Cuba \r\nfought against apartheid and all forms of racism, racial \r\ndiscrimination and other forms of intolerance in the \r\nworld. Cuba also participated, together with our \r\nAfrican brothers, in the historic fight for liberation and \r\nself-determination of the people of that continent. \r\nMandela’s ideas and his example were present in that \r\nfight. \r\n A/64/PV.42\r\n \r\n9 09-60000 \r\n \r\n The purpose reflected in the United Nations \r\nCharter is the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity. Further, the Charter makes clear that in order \r\nto achieve that and other purposes, the Organization \r\nand its Members shall act in accordance with the \r\nprinciples of sovereign equality, the peaceful resolution \r\nof international disputes, the non-use or threat of use of \r\nforce and non-intervention in the domestic affairs of \r\nStates. Cuba believes that strict respect for the Charter \r\nand its principles by all States is the essential basis for \r\nachieving a culture of peace.  \r\n This Assembly declared 2001-2010 as the \r\nInternational Decade for a Culture of Peace and \r\nNon-Violence for the Children of the World. We are \r\nnow at the end of that decade and must recognize today \r\nwith all frankness that we have not achieved the \r\nobjectives we set out to achieve. \r\n It is ever more clear that dialogue and \r\nmultilateralism are the only options for confronting the \r\nneoliberal globalization and unilateralism that \r\nendeavour to keep the countries of the South in \r\nunderdevelopment and impose homogeneity and \r\ndomination upon our cultures. Cuba reiterates its \r\nadherence to multilateralism and multilaterally agreed \r\nsolutions, in conformity with the United Nations \r\nCharter and international law, as the only way to \r\naddress international problems. Only in that manner \r\nwill there be peace and development for all. \r\n We support the Declaration and Programme of \r\nAction on a Culture of Peace, as well as the Global \r\nAgenda for Dialogue among Civilizations and its \r\nProgramme of Action. We also back the programmes \r\nand practical initiatives of UNESCO in this matter.  \r\n As can be seen in the final document of the \r\nfifteenth Summit of Non-Aligned Countries, held last \r\nJuly in Sharm el-Sheik, Egypt, it is necessary to \r\nmaintain dialogue among cultures, civilizations and \r\nreligions as an essential tool for the promotion of \r\neconomic and social development, peace and security, \r\nhuman rights and the rule of law in order to ensure a \r\nbetter life for all. We hope that the importance of \r\ndialogue will be consolidated during the 2010 NAM \r\nministerial meeting on interreligious dialogue. Further, \r\nCuba recognizes the first and second Forums of the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations held in Madrid and in Istanbul \r\nin 2008 and 2009, respectively, where a call was made \r\nfor cooperation among the various stakeholders and \r\ninterested parties in the promotion of dialogue among \r\ncivilizations. \r\n Peace is not merely the absence of conflict. \r\nPromoting a culture of peace requires the promotion of \r\neducation at all levels, the promotion of sustainable \r\neconomic and social development and respect for all \r\nhuman rights for all. There can be no culture of peace \r\nwithout the promotion of understanding, tolerance and \r\nsolidarity, or without the promotion of respect for \r\ncultures, history, the various religions and the unique \r\ncharacteristics of each nation. Fostering respect for \r\ncultural diversity is our duty and our right. We must \r\nreject any action that involves prejudice, discrimination, \r\nstereotypes, racial profiling and the defamation of \r\nreligions, against human dignity, equality and justice. \r\nAny doctrine based on racial or cultural superiority \r\nmust be vehemently rejected. \r\n The trend seen in some countries in recent years \r\nto identify certain cultures and religions with terrorism \r\nand violence is unacceptable. Cuba reiterates that there \r\nmust also be respect for the diversity of political, \r\nsocial, cultural and religious systems in order to help \r\nestablish a just and equitable world order. \r\n In order to bring about a culture of peace in the \r\nworld, there must be clear commitments and concrete \r\nactions to promote sustainability of the environment. \r\nObstacles that hamper the achievement by peoples of \r\ntheir right to self-determination must be eliminated.  \r\n There can be no culture of peace if there is no \r\nrecognition of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of \r\nterritory by war, if States act unilaterally and in a \r\nmanner contrary to the Charter and international law. A \r\nculture of peace cannot be promoted when there are \r\nthreats to the sovereignty and independence of other \r\nnations, when military bases are maintained in other \r\ncountries or when new military bases are being \r\nestablished, as the only super-Power is doing today in \r\ncountries of our America with clear goals of \r\nthreatening and intimidating. That can only serve to \r\nstrengthen the military presence of the only super-\r\nPower in our region, threatening our peoples and \r\nplacing them closer to American military power. \r\n How it is possible to achieve a culture of peace \r\nwhen, on the one hand, military expenditures increase \r\nat a dizzying rate, having reached a staggering figure \r\nof over $1.46 trillion, almost 60 per cent of which is \r\nconcentrated in one country, while, on the other hand, \r\nthis year the number of hungry people has reached a \r\nA/64/PV.42  \r\n \r\n09-60000 10 \r\n \r\nrecord of 1.2 billion — one sixth of our global \r\npopulation? How can there be peace when some \r\n90 million additional people will be plunged into \r\npoverty this year, and another 50 million into \r\nunemployment? How can we talk about a culture of \r\npeace when 10 million children will die this year of \r\npreventable diseases?  \r\n Mr. Mohamed (Maldives), Vice President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n If the rich countries of the West are genuinely \r\ncommitted to achieving a culture of peace — as we \r\nheard them proclaim in their speeches — they should \r\nstop betting on the preservation of an international \r\norder that is based on the use of force, technology and \r\neconomic power against the weakest; that distributes \r\nwealth unequally and relies on irrational patterns of \r\nconsumption; that is destroying the environment and \r\nthreatening life on the planet; an international order \r\nthat enables a few to concentrate political and \r\neconomic power and then make decisions for all of us.  \r\n Together, we can share the hope that a better \r\nworld is possible. As wisely set out in the Constitution \r\nof the United Nations Educational, Scientific and \r\nCultural Organization, since wars begin in the minds of \r\nmen, it is in the minds of men that the defences of \r\npeace must be constructed. The solution is in our \r\nhands. There is not a minute to lose. We must act \r\nwithout delay to ensure that the culture of peace at last \r\nreplaces the culture of violence and war. \r\n Mr. Ashiru (Nigeria): The delegation of Nigeria \r\nwishes to express its appreciation to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report contained in document A/64/325, \r\nwhich highlights the various activities carried out by \r\nthe United Nations system to promote the agenda item \r\nunder consideration. We would also like to thank the \r\nUNESCO secretariat for the informative documents \r\nmade available on that item. We urge Member States to \r\ncooperate with the Secretariat by including Alliance of \r\nCivilization goals in their national agendas, as well as \r\nby implementing those goals in their national plans and \r\nthrough intercultural dialogue. \r\n In its pure form, the divine world was expected to \r\naccommodate the nuances of all civilizations. \r\nUnfortunately, that has not been the case. However, \r\nwith the forces of globalization shrinking the world \r\ninto a global village, contacts between peoples of \r\ndifferent cultures, races and religions have increased. \r\nThe way we manage those differences requires greater \r\nattention than ever before; improving the interaction \r\namong the peoples of the world must receive greater \r\nglobal attention if we are to bring about dialogue and \r\nmutual understanding — without which we will \r\ncontinue to experience the consequences of ignorance. \r\n Notwithstanding the contradictions of the present, \r\nwe have ample opportunity for a fresh beginning to \r\ncollectively reconstruct a better world for future \r\ngenerations. That reconstruction should start in our \r\nminds and thoughts and our faiths and religions, which \r\ncan turn hatred into love, despair into hope, intolerance \r\ninto tolerance, chaos into order and strife into peace. \r\nLet us talk and work for the change we deserve.  \r\n Instead of a clash of civilizations, let us work \r\ntowards the convergence of pluralism. Despite the \r\ndifferences between and among us, let us appreciate \r\neach another and respect and recognize the basic \r\ndignity of man, including the right to the necessities of \r\nlife and the protection of the family. That \r\nunderstanding can best be achieved through dialogue to \r\npromote non-violence — including the prevention of \r\narmed conflict — religious and cultural understanding, \r\nharmony, cooperation and the promotion of \r\ninterreligious dialogue. \r\n As a multi-ethnic and multireligious society, it is \r\nperhaps only natural for us to continue to encourage \r\nthe promotion of a culture of peace — not only for that \r\nreason alone but also because, over the years, we in \r\nNigeria have been able to live together despite our \r\ncultural, linguistic and religious diversity. Of course, \r\nthat has not been a smooth journey for us as a people; \r\nhowever, it has brought about a better understanding \r\nand appreciation of who we are, thereby strengthening \r\nnation-building. \r\n We believe that the strategy for building a culture \r\nof peace should focus on broad parameters. That \r\nincludes devising means to resolve ongoing conflicts \r\nso that they do not degenerate further, developing \r\ninstitutional frameworks and relevant capacities for \r\npeace initiatives, and mobilizing resources at national \r\nand regional levels for peace initiatives. \r\n The media also have a significant role to play in \r\npromoting a culture of peace by targeting programmes \r\nthat promote peace and religious tolerance and \r\ndialogue among all faiths. We also believe that the \r\nmedia could serve as a catalyst in preventing the \r\ndefamation of religious and cultural values. \r\n A/64/PV.42\r\n \r\n11 09-60000 \r\n \r\n Nigeria holds dear the right of every citizen to \r\nfree speech, freedom of religious practice and healthy \r\nrespect for each other’s convictions. In that regard, we \r\nwish to reiterate our call for continued meetings \r\nbetween inter- and intra-faith organizations and for \r\nperiodic seminars on topical issues that facilitate the \r\nelimination of intolerance, disunity, conflict and \r\nviolence. \r\n The issue of promoting peace and understanding \r\nthrough mutual dialogue, tolerance and respect for each \r\nother requires a collective effort. It is therefore pertinent \r\nfor us to join hands in that endeavour in order to propel \r\nour world towards being a more peaceful and \r\nprosperous planet. We should also unite to de-emphasize \r\nthe agents of strife and conflict among us while paying \r\ngreater attention to those issues that create a harmonious \r\natmosphere, in order to guarantee for all the peoples of \r\nthe world full and fundamental human rights. \r\n We are convinced that our diversity has been \r\ncreated by the divine Creator for our benefit and not \r\nfor our destruction, for our strength and not for our \r\nweakness, and for our peaceful coexistence and not for \r\nwar. But until we see it that way, that diversity will \r\ncontinue to be a negative force rather than the positive \r\none that we all talk about and desire but never attain. \r\nWe need to put in more effort in promoting interfaith \r\ndialogue, as we believe that it will bring about an \r\nunderstanding of our differences and enable us to tap \r\ninto our rich cultural and common diversity.  \r\n We must overcome intolerance, hatred and all \r\nfalse notions about our different ethnic, cultural and \r\nreligious affiliations so that we can truly live together \r\nin an atmosphere of peace and love that can strengthen \r\ngrowth and development for all. Let us make this \r\nmillennium conflict-free, thereby promoting the \r\nprinciples and purposes of the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights. \r\n In conclusion, I urge members of the General \r\nAssembly to take to heart the significance of the simple \r\nbut captivating story told by one of my compatriots — a \r\nyoung lady by the name of Chimamanda Ngozi  \r\nAdichie — in referring to what she calls “the danger of \r\na single story”. Adichie pleads for patience and \r\ntolerance from each and every one of us. She cautions \r\nthat we must not focus on a single story because it \r\ncould lead to stereotyping — not because the single \r\nstory is untrue, but because a non-collective tale is \r\nincomplete. The consequence of the single story is that \r\nit robs a people of their dignity, robs them of their \r\ndifferences and ridicules their similarities. What is \r\nmore, it is unbalanced. When we reject the single story, \r\nwe realize that there is never a single story about any \r\nplace, people or ideology. Then we regain a kind of \r\nparadise that empowers and humanizes us. \r\n Mr. Rupani (India): I am deeply honoured and \r\nprivileged to participate in today’s discussion under the \r\nagenda item entitled “Culture of peace”. Please allow \r\nme to express our sincere thanks and appreciation to \r\nthe Secretary-General for his comprehensive report on \r\ninterreligious and intercultural dialogue, understanding \r\nand cooperation for peace (A/64/325), which outlines \r\nthe ongoing processes and future initiatives envisaged \r\nin that field. In that context, we are happy to \r\nco-sponsor the draft resolution on the International \r\nDecade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for \r\nthe Children of the World, 2001-2010 (A/64/L.5). We \r\nwere also happy to co-sponsor another major initiative \r\nin that area of the Alliance of Civilizations. India is a \r\nmember of the Group of Friends of the Alliance, an \r\ninitiative that, we are pleased to note, has gained \r\nmomentum. \r\n We are also extremely satisfied to co-sponsor the \r\ndraft resolution on the Nelson Mandela International \r\nDay (A/64/L.13), which was endorsed by the special \r\ndeclaration adopted at the fifteenth Summit of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement, at Sharm el-Sheikh. We \r\nexpress our rich tribute to Nelson Mandela, a visionary \r\nand great leader of our time whose life has been deeply \r\ninfluenced by Mahatma Gandhi — the greatest apostle \r\nof peace and non-violence. The adoption of that draft \r\nresolution will be a fitting complement to the incessant \r\nstruggle of that living legend in his dedication to the \r\nservice of humankind, the struggle against racial \r\ndiscrimination and the promotion of reconciliation and \r\ndemocracy internationally, as well as in the promotion \r\nof a culture of peace throughout the world. \r\n The Charter of the United Nations says that the \r\npeoples of the United Nations are determined to \r\npractise tolerance and live together in peace. Peace and \r\ntolerance therefore form the core set of values that the \r\nUnited Nations has painstakingly promoted ever since \r\nits inception. Those values, attitudes and ways of life \r\nunderscore freedom, justice, solidarity and respect for \r\ndiversity, dialogue and understanding. \r\n Much of the conflict in today’s world is driven by \r\nthe absence of tolerance. Forces that would like for the \r\nA/64/PV.42  \r\n \r\n09-60000 12 \r\n \r\nlanguage of violence to replace the language of \r\ndialogue and peace fuel that conflict. Violence is \r\nspreading its tentacles and threatening to destroy the \r\nmoral values and the fabric of tolerance and composite \r\nculture that has propelled progress for humankind. \r\nMore than ever before, the magnitude of those \r\nproblems requires that all human beings work together \r\nto find new solutions. \r\n We need to create an environment conducive to \r\nfostering dialogue among diverse cultures, faiths and \r\nreligions that inculcates the values that promote the \r\ntransition from force to reason and from conflict and \r\nviolence to dialogue and peace. Global efforts towards \r\npeace and reconciliation can succeed only with a \r\ncollective approach that is built on trust, dialogue and \r\ncollaboration. Albert Einstein rightly noted that peace \r\ncannot be kept by force, it can only be achieved by \r\nunderstanding. \r\n Dialogue among different cultures and religions \r\nis also important because it is precisely in the absence \r\nof such dialogue and understanding that intolerance, \r\nbigotry and violence flourish. That is the reason that \r\nextremist ideologies, violence and terrorism have \r\ngrown in a world in which we seem to be moving away \r\nfrom dialogue and understanding. \r\n There can be no disputing that terrorism — which \r\nis a manifestation of extremism, intolerance and \r\nviolence — is the antithesis of all religions. All acts of \r\nextremism and intolerance run counter to the central \r\nteachings of every religion, as all faiths are based on \r\nthe universal values of peace, goodness and humanity. \r\nNo religion condones violence or the killing of human \r\nbeings. \r\n The history of India is a story of conversations \r\nbetween different civilizations. We have a tradition of \r\nrespect and give-and-take between faiths and cultures. \r\nIndia is today home to the most diverse mix of people \r\nprofessing different faiths. In our midst are some of the \r\nlargest populations of the great religions of the world. \r\n The interaction between India and the West goes \r\nback to the time of ancient Greece. Millenniums ago, \r\nthe interaction between our two civilizations produced \r\nthe Milindapanha, a record of the conversations \r\nbetween the Greek King Menander and the Buddhist \r\nsage Nagasena. It also produced the exquisite \r\nGandhara art form. India’s contact with Islam produced \r\nthe great edifice of the Indo-Islamic culture, including \r\nthe beautiful traditions of Sufism. We in India \r\nunderstand the importance of building alliances among \r\nreligions, cultures and ethnic groups. As a nation of \r\nunparalleled diversity, Indians would not have \r\nsucceeded in holding together and strengthening a \r\ncomposite Indian identity unless they practised \r\ntolerance and were determined to live together in \r\npeace. \r\n India supports all efforts to build bridges of \r\nunderstanding among nations, peoples, religions and \r\ncultures across the many fault lines that exist. India \r\nfeels that initiatives that further and expand on those \r\nobjectives are both timely and valuable. Mahatma \r\nGandhi rightly said that intolerance is itself a form of \r\nviolence and an obstacle to the growth of a true \r\ndemocratic spirit. \r\n In India, we are disturbed by the rise of \r\nintolerance worldwide. We are troubled by the increase \r\nin resources, financial and other, being made available \r\nto violent and intolerant groups that misuse religion to \r\njustify and propagate their extremist agendas. The \r\neffort to counter such tendencies diverts attention and \r\nmuch-needed resources from development efforts in \r\nthe developing world, including India. Moreover, the \r\ndestructive activities of such groups have potentially \r\nserious consequences for social stability, peace and \r\ntranquillity. It is therefore imperative that the nations \r\nof the world come together to tackle the menace of \r\nterrorism and extremism, which are anathema to \r\nmodern societies. \r\n We need to be clear that abetting, knowingly or \r\neven unknowingly, the spread of pandemic \r\nfundamentalism and terrorism is like feeding a monster \r\nthat will turn around and consume us. \r\n The dialogue also needs to send out a strong \r\nmessage about the responsibility of nation States to do \r\nall that they can do to promote tolerance and respect. \r\nThey must do so at all levels, within nations, within \r\nregions and within the broader international \r\ncommunity. \r\n Mr. Moraes Cabral (Portugal): We have before \r\nus today several very important and meaningful draft \r\nresolutions concerning democracy, human rights and \r\ncooperation for peace. They are all linked by the \r\ncommon desire to reinforce the conditions leading to a \r\nmore peaceful world and a more stable, prosperous and \r\nequitable international society. \r\n A/64/PV.42\r\n \r\n13 09-60000 \r\n \r\n In that context, allow me to specifically address \r\ntwo of them. The first is the draft resolution \r\ndesignating 18 July as Nelson Mandela International \r\nDay, as contained in document A/64/L.13, thus paying \r\nrightful tribute to one of the most outstanding \r\npersonalities and statesman of our times, and the \r\nsecond is draft resolution A/64/L.14, acknowledging \r\nthe role of the Alliance of Civilizations as an important \r\ntool to reinforce peace, stability and mutual respect and \r\nunderstanding among peoples and countries. \r\n These two subjects are closely related, and \r\nPortugal is proud and honoured for having actively \r\nsupported both initiatives from their inception. \r\nPortugal aligns itself with the statement made by \r\nAmbassador Lidén of Sweden on behalf of the \r\nEuropean Union. Allow me now some further \r\ncomments in my national capacity. \r\n Nelson Mandela has fought all his life for justice, \r\npeace, democracy and human rights and against all \r\ndiscrimination, whether it be based on colour, religion \r\nor sex. He has also given a new meaning to the \r\nconcepts of fairness, reconciliation, forgiveness and \r\nunderstanding. \r\n His fight and towering example are imbedded in \r\ncontemporary history and constitute an inspiration for \r\nall those who strive for a better world, a more equal \r\nand just world, a world respectful of human rights, of \r\ndifference, of equality and equal opportunities for all; a \r\nworld where mutual understanding and active \r\nsolidarity among peoples and countries should be the \r\nrule; a world where everyone should have an equal \r\nright to economic and social development, without \r\nwhich stability, peace and democracy cannot thrive; a \r\nworld free of discrimination. \r\n He has, indeed, been the champion of Africa’s \r\nstruggle for liberation and for its unity. But this fight, \r\nto which he has committed himself without any \r\nconcession since his youth, through nearly 30 years of \r\nincarceration by a ruthless regime and as the leader of \r\na free nation, has projected itself far beyond his \r\ncountry and continent, to encompass the world and set \r\nthe standard for a new international culture of peace. \r\n Nelson Mandela has been the recipient of many \r\nhighly symbolic and important prizes. For its part, \r\nPortugal has acknowledged the international role and \r\nexample of Nelson Mandela by recently awarding him \r\nthe first Geremek Prize for Outstanding Achievement \r\nin the Promotion of Democracy. Yet, the tribute of the \r\ninternational community as a whole was missing. We \r\nare happy that this day has finally arrived and that his \r\nname, his fight and example will get the recognition \r\nthey deserve as elements of a necessary and constant \r\nreflection on the path to peace, democracy and the \r\nfulfilment of human rights for all. \r\n The second draft resolution, has, as I said, a close \r\nlinkage to Nelson Mandela and to the promotion and \r\npursuance of the ideals for which he has fought. \r\n I wish to thank Spain and Turkey for their efforts \r\nin preparing and coordinating this draft resolution. I \r\nalso wish to thank the Secretary-General for having \r\nnurtured this ideal, helping to make it a reality. Allow \r\nme a special word for Portugal’s President Sampaio, \r\nwhose leadership, vision and relentless personal \r\ncommitment have been decisive in launching and \r\nconsolidating this very important initiative. The \r\nAlliance of Civilizations, in the few years since its \r\ninception, has rallied the support and the enthusiasm of \r\nmany friends, Governments, civil society and \r\ninternational and regional organizations around its \r\nideals and objectives. \r\n It has become much more clear in recent years \r\nthe importance of mutual understanding among \r\ncultures and civilizations in bringing about a more \r\npeaceful and stable world — the importance of \r\ndialogue, respect for difference, dialogue and of \r\nbridge-building in this context. \r\n These are the objectives that the Alliance is \r\npursuing by devising and implementing concrete \r\nnational and regional strategies around four decisive \r\nthematic pillars — youth, education, media and \r\nmigration — as well as promoting country and regional \r\ninclusive synergies among all actors involved. \r\n Albeit still in its youth as an international \r\ninitiative, the Alliance has already demonstrated its \r\nmaturity and strength, launching an important number \r\nof activities and projects, actively supported by a \r\nsignificant and growing number of countries and other \r\ninternational actors. Let me underline the adoption of \r\nmany national plans, of the two biennial \r\nimplementation plans, the network of focal points and \r\nthe increasing number of national and regional \r\ninitiatives as reflected in the outcome of the two annual \r\nforums held in Madrid and in Istanbul. \r\n I do not doubt that this trend will be reinforced in \r\nfuture meetings to be held in the coming years in \r\nA/64/PV.42  \r\n \r\n09-60000 14 \r\n \r\nBrazil, Qatar and Austria, widening the scope and \r\nstrengthening the effectiveness of the Alliance’s role in \r\nthe promotion of peace and dialogue worldwide. \r\n Portugal believes that the recognition by the \r\nGeneral Assembly of the importance of the role of the \r\nAlliance, and of the work it has been doing, are \r\nappropriate and timely. I do not doubt that it will be \r\nviewed as an important element of the commitment to \r\nthe Alliance’s purposes and endeavours on the part of \r\nthe international community, and I trust that all \r\ndelegations in the General Assembly will rally in \r\nsupport of the draft resolution. \r\n I believe today is indeed a happy day for this \r\nAssembly. By approving both draft resolutions, as well \r\nas those pertaining to promoting interreligious and \r\nintercultural dialogue, the protection of children and \r\nthe consolidation of new and restored democracies, we \r\npay tribute to an outstanding man, Nelson Mandela, \r\nand his work. At the same time, we support and \r\nencourage an initiative which reflects and pursues so \r\nmany of his ideals and aims. \r\n Mr. Mahiga (United Republic of Tanzania): \r\nToday, we are seeking to promote a culture of peace in \r\nsocieties and nations and across nations, which is \r\nmeant to make peace a way of life through positive \r\neducation, social cooperation and enlightened political \r\nleadership. Starting this year and every year hereafter \r\nat the United Nations, let us also celebrate President \r\nNelson Mandela, the man, the visionary leader and \r\nabove all, the incarnation of peace as enshrined in the \r\nUnited Nations Charter. \r\n Nelson Mandela is the icon of the struggle for \r\nfreedom, racial equality and democracy against \r\napartheid, one of the most iniquitous oppressive \r\npolitical systems of the twentieth century. At 92, \r\nNelson Mandela is at the twilight of his life, which has \r\nbeen the ultimate definition of peace in South Africa, \r\nthe African continent and the world as a whole. \r\n He is a symbol of courage in the face of violence, \r\nheroism in the face of death, dignity in the face of \r\nhumiliation and magnanimity in the face of injustice. \r\nNelson Mandela is synonymous with peace and \r\nreconciliation which the United Nations seeks as the \r\ndesired end result of every conflict. \r\n From his youth and as a young leader of the \r\nAfrican National Congress, Nelson Mandela chose the \r\npath of non-violent mass action to fight the juggernaut \r\nof apartheid. That was the chosen path of the ANC \r\nsince its inception in 1911. It was after the Sharpeville \r\nmassacre of innocent demonstrators in 1959 that \r\nNelson Mandela and the people of South Africa \r\nrealized that the path of a non-violent approach to \r\nfreedom was blocked by a concrete barrier, that the \r\ndoor to peaceful negotiations was bolted by a steel bar \r\nand that apartheid oppression was being intensified. \r\nThe Soweto atrocities against peaceful demonstrations \r\nin 1976 were yet another affront to peaceful means to \r\nend apartheid. As a means of self-defence, armed \r\nstruggle was therefore the only option on the ground if \r\nthe political struggle was to continue.  \r\n Mandela was thrown into jail in 1964 for \r\n27 years, most of which was in solitary confinement. \r\nDuring his trial, Mandela said, \r\n “I have fought against white domination, and I \r\nhave fought against black domination. I have \r\ncherished the ideal of a democratic and free \r\nsociety in which all persons live together in \r\nharmony and with equal opportunities. It is an \r\nideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But \r\nif needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared \r\nto die.” \r\n Mandela continued to count on the pressure from \r\nthe international community, including the United \r\nNations, against apartheid. On his release from prison \r\non 11 February 1990, Mandela said,  \r\n “We thank the world community for their great \r\ncontribution to the anti-apartheid struggle. \r\nWithout your support, our struggle could not have \r\nreached this advanced stage.” \r\nThe support of the front-line States will be remembered \r\nby South Africans forever. \r\n Indeed, from 1948 to 1994, countless speeches \r\nwere delivered from this rostrum and countless \r\nresolutions were passed denouncing apartheid and \r\nseeking to rally international action against apartheid \r\nuntil it was dismantled. While incarcerated — doing \r\nhard labour and kept in solitary confinement on \r\nRobben Island — Nelson Mandela continued to be an \r\ninspiration and hope to the world in the fight against \r\napartheid until he was released and led the last mile in \r\nthe march to freedom and democracy in South Africa. \r\n It must be put on the record that among the \r\ngreatest achievements of the United Nations since 1945 \r\nis its contribution to freedom and independence from \r\n A/64/PV.42\r\n \r\n15 09-60000 \r\n \r\ncolonialism and apartheid in Africa. Nelson Mandela \r\nspoke from this rostrum after his release to thank the \r\nUnited Nations for this great achievement. It is \r\ntherefore fitting that we should also honour him from \r\nthis rostrum. As the last living legend of the liberation \r\nstruggle in Africa, he has joined the ranks of his \r\npredecessors: Nkrumah, Kenyatta, Nyerere, Azikiwe, \r\nSenghor and others. \r\n Mandela’s call for reconciliation, for peace with \r\nthe former oppressors, and for democracy and \r\nmulti-racial coexistence in South Africa is probably the \r\nmost outstanding and indelible contribution to world \r\npeace we can imagine. It is the living example that \r\nshould be emulated by the international community, \r\nand the United Nations should pass it on to future \r\ngenerations by observing and celebrating Nelson \r\nMandela International Day, which we inaugurate today \r\nas part of the culture of peace. \r\n Mr. Barbalić (Bosnia and Herzegovina): \r\nFollowing important forums on the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations, including regional events such as the one \r\nscheduled to be held in Sarajevo, our capital, on \r\n14 December, the stage has been set for concrete \r\ndialogue and actions designed to deepen mutual \r\nunderstanding and trust in the region and beyond. \r\n We salute the 2005 World Summit Outcome \r\n(resolution 60/1), in which heads of State and \r\nGovernment welcomed the Alliance of Civilizations \r\ninitiative announced by the Secretary-General in 2005. \r\nAs a result, a considerable number of valuable projects \r\nhave contributed to the expansion of goals set by the \r\nAlliance. Taking into consideration the importance and \r\nresults of the last two forums held in Madrid and \r\nIstanbul, we are looking forward to the next forum, \r\nexpected to take place in Brazil in 2010, with high \r\nhopes and dedication. We commend the reports of the \r\nUnited Nations High Representative for the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations and intend to participate actively in that \r\ninitiative as a member of its Group of Friends. \r\n Despite the brave advances made in many global \r\nareas since the end of the cold war, we are facing an \r\nincrease in social, cultural, religious and other kinds of \r\ntension and confrontation. Some of them — too many \r\nof them — have quickly turned into full-scale armed \r\nconflicts. Too many fundamental human rights have \r\ncome under assault. Too many lives have been lost. \r\nUnfortunately, that has been the case in my country, \r\ntoo. \r\n Thus, the need to bring about advanced \r\nintercultural and interreligious dialogue to promote \r\ntolerance and peace is of the highest importance for my \r\nhomeland. We recognize that the protection and \r\nsafeguarding of cultural heritage and the free exercise \r\nof religion while respecting tradition are among the \r\nbasic fundamental rights for achieving a comprehensive \r\npeace. \r\n Bosnia and Herzegovina is also a State that is \r\ncommitted to freeing itself from the disputes of the \r\npast and to practising a culture of peace and dialogue. \r\n Peace is indivisible from dialogue. As has been \r\nsaid so many times before, the challenge we face every \r\nsingle day is to replace fear and harassment with \r\nacceptance and tolerance. We should all learn that \r\ntolerance is the ability to exercise a fair and objective \r\nattitude towards those whose opinions, practices, \r\nreligions, nationalities and so on differ from our own. \r\n We in Bosnia and Herzegovina have also come to \r\nthe realization that dialogue must be conducted on a \r\nplatform comprised of democracy, the rule of law and \r\nrespect for human rights and dignity of the individual. \r\nWe are fully aware that without an open dialogue there \r\ncan be no true reconciliation either. \r\n We are committed to dialogue among cultures \r\nand civilizations because we are also determined to \r\ncope with new vulnerabilities that have come to light in \r\nthis era of globalization. With other countries in its \r\nregion, Bosnia and Herzegovina shares a goal: to \r\nsecure our integration into a unified Europe, which we \r\nbelieve holds the promise of stability and prosperity \r\nand freedom from interreligious and inter-ethnic \r\nconflict. \r\n We would like to reaffirm here our belief that \r\nmutual respect, rooted in dialogue and nourished by \r\nmulti-ethnicity, multiculturality and a multiplicity of \r\nreligions, is indispensable for our strategy to preserve \r\npeace, regional stability and, very importantly, the \r\nresolution of conflicts. \r\n We are now addressing the commitment of all \r\nStates, united in favour of a peaceful future, to \r\nfulfilling our potential for promoting universal respect \r\nfor and the observance of human rights, fundamental \r\nfreedoms and global tolerance, based on our shared \r\nvalues and mutual experiences. \r\n Mr. Normandin (Canada) (spoke in French): \r\nCanada is pleased to participate in this morning’s \r\nA/64/PV.42  \r\n \r\n09-60000 16 \r\n \r\ndebate on the culture of peace. This agenda item covers \r\na large number of initiatives that advance the cause of \r\npeace by encouraging dialogue between cultures and \r\nreligions. We would like to thank Bangladesh, the \r\nPhilippines and Pakistan for submitting draft \r\nresolutions that will contribute to progress in this \r\ndirection. \r\n Canada would also like to thank Turkey and \r\nSpain for the efforts they have devoted to the Alliance \r\nof Civilizations. Canada supports the Alliance and the \r\ndraft resolution (A/64/L.14) before the Assembly this \r\nmorning. We have recently demonstrated our own \r\ncommitment to the Alliance by organizing here, at the \r\nUnited Nations, in September, a round table on the \r\nmanagement of multi-ethnic cities, with the support of \r\nthe Italian Mission, the Secretariat of the Alliance and \r\nthe International Organization for Migration. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n Canada is pleased to co-sponsor the draft \r\nresolution before us today entitled “Nelson Mandela \r\nInternational Day” (A/64/L.13). Nelson Mandela is \r\nrightly considered one of the greatest statesmen of our \r\ntimes. During his almost three decades in prison he \r\nbecame a unifying symbol of resistance to the racism, \r\nintolerance and injustice that characterized South \r\nAfrica’s apartheid regime. A man of courage, he was \r\nwilling to sacrifice his own life for the freedom of all \r\nSouth Africans. When he emerged from prison, it was \r\nas a tower of strength and forgiveness, a leader \r\ncommitted to peace and reconciliation. With wisdom \r\nand determination, he united his divided nation through \r\nthe creation of a new and democratic South Africa. \r\n As we all know, he and Frederik de Klerk \r\nreceived the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 in recognition \r\nof that remarkable accomplishment and its contribution \r\nto world peace. When Nelson Mandela left office, he \r\ndid so with grace and dignity, under the terms of a new \r\nSouth African Constitution. But he was not finished. \r\nHe went on to demonstrate that truly great men do not \r\nneed to hold public office to be leaders. Through his \r\nefforts at conflict mediation and his work with \r\nchildren, he led by example, guided by his sense of \r\njustice and his deep compassion and caring for his \r\nfellow human beings. \r\n Canada has honoured Nelson Mandela with its \r\nhighest awards. In 1998, he was made an honorary \r\nCompanion of the Order of Canada. Three years later, \r\nin 2001, in recognition of his great moral leadership of \r\nSouth Africa and indeed all humanity, he was granted \r\nhonorary Canadian citizenship by unanimous consent \r\nof the House of Commons. This is a mark of respect \r\nreserved for the few we hold in highest esteem. Nelson \r\nMandela is a role model for our times, and we welcome \r\nthis draft resolution, as it seeks to ensure that his \r\nvalues, including his commitment to democracy and \r\nthe protection of human rights, as well as his \r\ndedication to the service of humanity, will continue to \r\nguide us and our children for years to come. \r\n Mr. Kapambwe (Zambia): A lot of things have \r\nbeen said about Mr. Mandela — before his arrest, \r\nduring the 27 1/2 years of his incarceration and since \r\nhis release in 1990. Many of those things were said \r\nwithin these same hallowed walls of the United \r\nNations. Friends, allies, adversaries and total strangers \r\nhave felt entitled to say something about Mr. Mandela. \r\nSome of what has been said is complimentary and \r\nflattering to him — and he deserves all of these and \r\nmore. Many of the other things said about him have \r\nbeen uncomplimentary, unfair and untrue. As a human \r\nbeing he probably deserves some of these too. \r\n Today, through draft resolution A/64/L.13, we \r\nwant to honour the man but, more importantly, we want \r\nto honour the principles and the ideals he has always \r\nstood for: courage, perseverance, peace, justice, \r\nreconciliation, freedom, endurance, human dignity. \r\nMandela is special. He is one of the few people we all \r\nfeel entitled to claim as ours. He is a world treasure. \r\nMy delegation is proud to be one of the sponsors of \r\nthis draft resolution proclaiming 18 July, his birthday, \r\nas Nelson Mandela International Day. \r\n Mr. Kaludjerović (Montenegro): In these trying \r\ntimes of various crises, where our future is uncertain, \r\nspillover negative effects have the potential to create \r\nvolatile environments and increase social, religious and \r\ncultural tensions. We, like all nations, need to work \r\ntogether to strengthen our common human heritage, \r\nreject violence and prevent conflict through solidarity, \r\ndialogue, tolerance and understanding, breaking away \r\nfrom the stereotypes and intolerances of the past. We \r\nwelcome the report of the Secretary-General on \r\n“Interreligious and intercultural dialogue, understanding \r\nand cooperation for peace” (A/64/325), which highlights \r\nthe activities carried out by the key United Nations \r\nbodies and other major regional and global initiatives in \r\nthis field, as well as the recommendations contained \r\ntherein. \r\n A/64/PV.42\r\n \r\n17 09-60000 \r\n \r\n The Alliance of Civilizations has been \r\ninstrumental in engaging Governments, civil society \r\nand international organizations in advancing \r\nintercultural and interreligious dialogue and in \r\ncountering division, polarization and extremism within \r\nand between societies. I would, therefore, like to \r\nexpress our sincere gratitude to Ambassador Apakan of \r\nTurkey and Ambassador Yáñez-Barnuevo of Spain and \r\ntheir respective countries for their continuing efforts to \r\npromote the goals of the Alliance. \r\n In the space of four years, the Alliance has \r\nsignificantly increased its reach and scope and has \r\nachieved rapid progress in implementing its objectives. \r\nThis clearly shows the strong and growing support and \r\ngoodwill of many countries and partners in the \r\npromotion of peace, tolerance, mutual understanding \r\nand coexistence, leading to a better world. As an \r\ninnovative and dynamic initiative, the Alliance has \r\nbeen very effective in fostering cross-cultural \r\ncooperation between religious, national and cultural \r\ncommunities. It has advanced its goals and shaped its \r\nagenda for the good governance of cultural diversity at \r\nthe global level, as well as in introducing concrete \r\nprojects, results-oriented policies and practical actions \r\nthat deliver, as was demonstrated by the successful \r\noutcome of the Madrid and Istanbul Forums. It still \r\nremains a strong forum for an open, inclusive and \r\nglobal dialogue. We are sure that the third Forum, to be \r\nheld in Brazil in 2010, will give the Alliance additional \r\nimpetus. \r\n Many members of the Group of Friends, \r\nincluding my own country, have taken it upon \r\nthemselves to advance the goals of the Alliance \r\nthrough national strategies, focusing on tangible \r\noutcomes in the fields of education, youth, migration \r\nand the media. I would also like to highlight the \r\nimportance of incorporating the Alliance into regional \r\nprocesses through the creation of regional strategies, \r\nwhere priority is given to cross-cultural polarization in \r\nrelations between Muslim and Western societies. \r\nRegional strategies are an important tool designed to \r\nhelp countries facing similar challenges to create \r\ncommon opportunities to address them, to compare \r\ntheir approaches and share information about \r\nshortcomings, successes and lessons learned, as well as \r\nto boost regional initiatives and regional coordination. \r\nBearing this in mind, we look forward to the approval \r\nof the regional strategy for South-East Europe during \r\nthe conference to be held in Sarajevo in December. \r\n Montenegro remains a very enthusiastic member \r\nof the Group of Friends and a proud co-sponsor of \r\ndraft resolution A/64/L.14, introduced here yesterday. \r\nWe strongly believe that the draft resolution will \r\nreinforce interaction and coordination of the Alliance \r\nwith the United Nations system for a results-oriented \r\napproach, strengthening the initiative and furthering its \r\nobjectives. We thus reiterate the hopes expressed by its \r\nmain sponsors, Spain and Turkey, as well as other \r\nco-sponsors, that the draft resolution will be adopted \r\nby consensus and its purposes embraced by the entire \r\nmembership. \r\n In closing, I would like to once again confirm our \r\nreadiness and commitment to continuing to work with \r\nthe Alliance and other forums established to forward \r\ninnovative ideas, initiatives and actions designed to \r\ndevelop peace through intercultural and interreligious \r\ncooperation and understanding. \r\n Mr. Faqeeh (Saudi Arabia) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nMy delegation would like to thank the President of the \r\nAssembly for his efforts in convening this important \r\nmeeting on agenda item 49, “Culture of peace”. \r\n Fostering a culture of peace, protecting human \r\nrights and the rule of law, and dialogue among cultures \r\nand peoples are essential to all effective strategies. It is \r\nclear that respect for international law and its \r\nprinciples is the only means to solve international \r\nconflicts and eliminate hotbeds of tension. While \r\npositive developments in information and \r\ncommunication technologies have improved the quality \r\nof life around that world, some extremist minorities \r\nwithin every cultural or religious group seek to take \r\nadvantage of that progress to propagate hatred, racism \r\nand exclusion by way of such technology. \r\n Under the aegis of the United Nations, we wish to \r\nstrive to create a healthy atmosphere that promotes the \r\nvalues of dialogue, tolerance, moderation and a \r\nrelationship of cooperation and peace among cultures, \r\nStates and peoples. The increasing responsibility of the \r\nmedia to avoid stereotyped images and preconceived \r\nnotions of others and to portray positive images of \r\nthem instead will enhance dialogue among cultures and \r\nlead to positive results. \r\n With those noble goals in mind, the King of \r\nSaudi Arabia has sincerely called for the promotion of \r\ndialogue among the religions and cultures that make up \r\nthe international human family. Those initiatives have \r\nhad two separate trajectories: political and cultural. At \r\nA/64/PV.42  \r\n \r\n09-60000 18 \r\n \r\nthe political level, a special Muslim summit was held \r\nin Mecca at which all participants were urged to reject \r\nviolence, extremism and terrorism and instead \r\npropagate mutual respect, dialogue and tolerance. A \r\nhigh-level meeting was held at the United Nations in \r\nNovember 2008 aimed at offering the greatest possible \r\npolitical support to all initiatives to foster dialogue, \r\nunderstanding and a culture of peace. \r\n The second trajectory is more cultural and social \r\nin nature. Muslim clerics and scholars of all religious \r\nstripes have met in Mecca to underscore the tolerant \r\nnature of Islam and its message of dialogue and peace. \r\nAn international meeting on dialogue among \r\ncivilizations was held in Madrid in July 2007, bringing \r\ntogether representatives of all major religions. Other \r\nefforts are under way to establish a world centre for \r\ndialogue among representatives of all major religions, \r\nfree from all political influence and intervention. \r\n The President took the Chair. \r\n The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia wishes to express \r\nits deep concern regarding hatred, discrimination, \r\nintolerance and the persecution of any religious group \r\nor community. We have stressed the importance of \r\ndialogue, understanding and tolerance of others, \r\nwhatever their religion, culture or beliefs. The history \r\nof our part of the world offers a shining example of \r\npeaceful coexistence, intermixing and communication \r\namong the three monotheistic religions, Islam, Judaism \r\nand Christianity. We seek today to perpetuate this \r\nhistory of peaceful coexistence through the United \r\nNations, which brings together representatives of all of \r\nthose religions, beliefs and cultures. \r\n Our goal is to promote dialogue that underscores \r\nall the positive aspects of those religious cultures while \r\nrejecting their negative aspects, and to overcome all \r\nobstacles in the path of dialogue so we can reach our \r\ndesired goals. We underscore the importance of not \r\nexploiting extremism and of avoiding clashes among \r\ncultures and civilizations. The King of Saudi Arabia \r\nhas stressed on numerous occasions the importance of \r\npeaceful and positive coexistence in order to avoid a \r\nclash of cultures and to create avenues for \r\nunderstanding among peoples. \r\n In closing, the propagation of a culture of peace \r\nand tolerance is a global effort to which we must all \r\ncontribute. That would allow us to ensure peace for \r\nfuture generations, allowing them also to enjoy \r\ndevelopment, progress and cooperation. \r\n Mr. Ashiki (Japan): My delegation would like to \r\nmake a general statement on draft resolution \r\nA/64/L.14, entitled “The Alliance of Civilizations”. \r\nJapan appreciates the efforts and commitment of Spain \r\nand Turkey in presenting this concise draft resolution \r\non the Alliance of Civilizations, which promotes \r\ngreater understanding and respect among civilizations. \r\n Japan attaches great importance to dialogue \r\namong civilizations, and for this reason supports the \r\nwork of the Alliance of Civilizations. We hope that, in \r\ncooperation with other organizations working in the \r\nsame field, the Alliance of Civilizations will produce \r\nconcrete results. UNESCO has long been active in the \r\nfield of intercultural dialogue. At the 181st session of \r\nUNESCO’s Executive Board in April, the High \r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General for the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations, Mr. Sampaio, confirmed the \r\nimportance of strengthening cooperation with the \r\nAlliance, and we welcome his statement. \r\n We are also pleased that the new Director-\r\nGeneral of UNESCO, Ms. Irina Bokova, will continue \r\nand strengthen her organization’s partnership with the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations, which was established by \r\nformer Director-General Koichiro Matsuura. Indeed, \r\nJapan hopes that cooperation between UNESCO and \r\nthe Alliance will yield even more in the way of \r\ntangible results. \r\n From this perspective, Japan happily supports and \r\njoins the co-sponsorship of this draft resolution and \r\nhopes that it will be adopted by consensus. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I now call on \r\nthe observer of the Holy See. \r\n Archbishop Migliore (Holy See): At the outset, \r\nmy delegation would like to congratulate the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on his report (A/64/325) highlighting the \r\nactivities carried out by key United Nations entities \r\ninvolved in the field of interreligious and intercultural \r\ndialogue. \r\n The question of religion and the contribution of \r\nreligions to peace and development has resurfaced in \r\nthe United Nations in recent years because it has \r\nbecome urgent and inevitable in the opinion of the \r\nworld. A century and a half ago, at the beginning of the \r\nindustrial revolution, religion was described as the \r\nopium of the people. Today, in the context of \r\nglobalization, it is increasingly regarded as the vitamin \r\nof the poor. \r\n A/64/PV.42\r\n \r\n19 09-60000 \r\n \r\n The unique contribution of religions and the \r\ndialogue and cooperation among them lies in their \r\nraison d’être, which is to serve the spiritual and \r\ntranscendental dimension of human nature. They also \r\ntend to raise the human spirit, protect life, empower the \r\nweak, translate ideals into action, purify institutions, \r\ncontribute to resolving economic and non-economic \r\ninequalities, inspire their leaders to go beyond the \r\nnormal call of duty, and permit people to attain a fuller \r\nrealization of their natural potential and traverse \r\nsituations of conflict through reconciliation, \r\npeacebuilding processes and the healing of memories \r\nscarred by injustice. \r\n It is well known that, throughout history, \r\nindividuals and leaders have manipulated religions. \r\nLikewise, ideological and nationalistic movements \r\nhave taken religious differences as an opportunity to \r\ngarner support for their own causes. Recently, the \r\nmanipulation and misuse of religion for political \r\npurposes have given rise to debates and deliberations at \r\nthe United Nations on this theme, placing it in the \r\ncontext of human rights. \r\n Indeed, the debate within the United Nations on \r\nthe role of religions has continued for quite some time \r\nnow and the need for a coherent vision of and \r\nappropriate approach to that phenomenon is deeply \r\nfelt. My delegation would like to offer some \r\nconsiderations on the matter with a view to \r\ncontributing to a suitable and effective interaction of \r\nreligion and religions with the United Nations goals \r\nand activities. \r\n Interreligious or interfaith dialogue aimed at \r\ninvestigating the theological and spiritual foundations \r\nof different religions in view of mutual understanding \r\nand cooperation is increasingly becoming an \r\nimperative, a conviction and an effective endeavour \r\namong many religions. I am pleased to call to mind the \r\nleadership taken by the Catholic Church some 40 years \r\nago in reaching out to other religious traditions with \r\nthe promulgation of the conciliar document “In Our \r\nAge”. Today, many Christian denominations and other \r\nreligions are engaged in dialogue with programmes of \r\ntheir own, and in this way have continued to make \r\nprogress towards greater understanding among each \r\nother. \r\n In that regard, the Holy See has implemented a \r\nnumber of initiatives to promote dialogue among \r\nChristian denominations and with Jewish believers, \r\nBuddhists and Hindus. The Pontifical Council for \r\nInterreligious Dialogue was set up more than 40 years \r\nago and, more recently, an initiative that is the first of \r\nits kind was launched with the signing by 138 Muslim \r\nrepresentatives of the document “A Common Word \r\nBetween Us and You”. That engagement seeks to foster \r\ngreater respect, understanding and cooperation among \r\nbelievers of various denominations, to encourage the \r\nstudy of religions, and to promote the creation of \r\npersons dedicated to dialogue. That type of theological \r\nand spiritual dialogue requires that it be conducted by \r\nand among believers and adopt a proper methodology. \r\nAt the same time, it offers the indispensable premise \r\nand basis for the much broader culture of dialogue and \r\ncooperation that different academic, political, \r\neconomic and international institutions have launched \r\nin past decades. \r\n Recent social and political events have renewed \r\nthe engagement of the United Nations in integrating its \r\nreflection and action on affirming a culture of respect, \r\nwith a specific concern for interreligious \r\nunderstanding. The protagonists of that dialogue are \r\nMember States in their interaction with civil society. \r\nTheir approach and methodology stem from the very \r\nmission and purpose of the United Nations. \r\n However, keeping in mind the spirit and the \r\nwords of the United Nations Charter, as well as core \r\njuridical instruments, it is safe to say that the specific \r\nand primary responsibility of the United Nations vis-à-\r\nvis religion is to debate, elucidate and help States to \r\nfully ensure, at all levels, the implementation of the \r\nright to religious freedom, as affirmed in the relevant \r\nUnited Nations documents, which includes full respect \r\nfor and the promotion not only of the fundamental \r\nfreedom of conscience, but also of the expression and \r\npractice of everybody’s religion, without restriction. \r\n Indeed, the ultimate goal and achievement of the \r\nUnited Nations in pursuing interreligious understanding \r\nand cooperation is to be able to engage States, as well \r\nas all segments of human society, in recognizing, \r\nrespecting and promoting the dignity and rights of \r\nevery person and each community in the world. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): We have heard \r\nthe last speaker in the debate on this item. \r\n Before proceeding further, I should like to inform \r\nmembers that, at the request of the sponsors, action on \r\ndraft resolutions A/64/L.5 and A/64/L.15 will be taken \r\nat a later date, to be announced. \r\nA/64/PV.42  \r\n \r\n09-60000 20 \r\n \r\n We shall now proceed to consider draft resolution \r\nA/64/L.13, entitled “Nelson Mandela International \r\nDay”. Finland, the Republic of Korea and Andorra \r\nhave joined the list of sponsors. \r\n May I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt \r\ndraft resolution A/64/L.13? \r\n Draft resolution A/64/L.13 was adopted \r\n(resolution 64/13). \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): We would like \r\nto pay tribute to what the great fighter Nelson Mandela \r\nhas done for the freedom and dignity of humankind. \r\nWe all know Mandela’s story; we know his struggle \r\nand that he was imprisoned for dozens of years. Today, \r\nby adopting the draft resolution honouring Nelson \r\nMandela, we express our attachment to freedom and \r\ndignity and our appreciation for that great man, who \r\nhas dedicated his life and suffered for the sake of all \r\nhumankind. We would like to express our utmost \r\nappreciation and gratitude for that great man. \r\n The General Assembly will now take action on \r\ndraft resolution A/64/L.14, entitled “The Alliance of \r\nCivilizations”, as orally revised. \r\n The following countries wish to add their names \r\nto the list of sponsors: Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, \r\nHungary, Japan, Mozambique and the Sudan. \r\n May I take it that it is the wish of the General \r\nAssembly to adopt draft resolution A/64/L.14, as orally \r\nrevised? \r\n Draft resolution A/64/L.14, as orally revised, was \r\nadopted (resolution 64/14). \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): We have thus \r\nconcluded this stage of our consideration of agenda \r\nitem 49. \r\n The meeting rose at 12.20 p.m. \r\n"
