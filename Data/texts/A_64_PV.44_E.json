(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) \r\n \r\n \r\n  In the absence of the President, Mr. Hackett \r\n(Bahamas), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda items 9 and 119 (continued) \r\n \r\nReport of the Security Council (A/64/2) \r\n \r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and increase \r\nin the membership of the Security Council and \r\nrelated matters \r\n \r\n Sir Mark Lyall Grant (United Kingdom): I \r\nshould like to begin by thanking the President for \r\nhaving convened this important debate, the first debate \r\nin which I am participating as the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of the United Kingdom. I should also \r\nlike to thank the Permanent Representative of \r\nAustria — in his capacity as President of the Security \r\nCouncil during the month of November — for his \r\ncomments on the report of the Security Council \r\n(A/64/2), on behalf of all members of the Council. And \r\nmy thanks go also to the Permanent Representative and \r\nmission of Uganda for leading the work, with the \r\nSecretariat, to produce this report. \r\n While the Security Council report remains the \r\nresponsibility of the Council, we support efforts to \r\nensure a transparent process. We welcome the initiative \r\ntaken by Viet Nam last year and continued by Uganda \r\nthis year to convene an informal, interactive meeting \r\nwith Member States to discuss the report. We hope that \r\nmore Member States will take advantage of such \r\nopportunities in the future. \r\n More broadly, we note that positive trends \r\ntowards greater transparency in the Security Council \r\ncontinue. The last year saw a further increase in the \r\nnumber of open meetings. We will continue to work to \r\nensure that the Security Council, like all United \r\nNations organs, works both effectively and \r\ntransparently. \r\n Turning now to Security Council reform, I am \r\npleased to have the opportunity to reiterate our \r\ncommitment to making progress. We continue to \r\nsupport permanent membership for Brazil, Germany, \r\nIndia and Japan, as well as permanent representation \r\nfrom Africa.  \r\n It has been an eventful year. The start of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations in February was a clear \r\nindication of our collective desire to achieve concrete \r\nprogress. Our focus this session should be on \r\nmaintaining the momentum. We fully support \r\nAmbassador Tanin’s efforts to move the process \r\nforward. The session on the intermediate model in the \r\nlast round of intergovernmental negotiations was \r\nespecially welcome. A range of views were expressed, \r\nincluding on what this might mean for the future. The \r\nUnited Kingdom position, as set out in the British and \r\nFrench declaration of 6 July, notes that such a model \r\ncould provide for a new category of seats with a longer \r\nmandate. On completion of an intermediate period, a \r\nreview could be undertaken to convert the new seats \r\ninto permanent ones. For our part, we believe the \r\nintermediate model might be considered as a means of \r\nending the deadlock, and might provide a stepping \r\nstone towards permanent reform. \r\nA/64/PV.44  \r\n \r\n09-60619 2 \r\n \r\n We continue to believe that creative ideas need to \r\nbe considered, if we are to achieve permanent reform \r\nof the Security Council. We should look, in detail, at \r\npossible alternative models that might break the \r\ndeadlock. \r\n We all share a genuine will for reform, but a \r\nconcerted effort from the membership will be required \r\nif we are to make progress. We will also need to show \r\nflexibility and a spirit of compromise. We are \r\ncommitted to working with others in this session to \r\nmake Security Council reform a reality. \r\n Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): Every year, all the Member States of the \r\nUnited Nations have an opportunity to discuss together \r\nthe results of the work of the Security Council as \r\nreflected in its report, which, today, was introduced \r\ntoday by the current President of the Council, \r\nAmbassador Mayr-Harting. It is very important to have \r\nthis very transparent discussion. We should like to \r\nthank the delegation of Uganda for its work in \r\npreparing this report (A/64/2). We believe that, overall, \r\nit does objectively reflect the dynamics of the Council \r\nover the past year. \r\n The fact that the Council, as in earlier years, was \r\nactively involved in resolving some of the most \r\nimportant issues of our time shows that the \r\ninternational community and the members of the \r\nCouncil recognize and accept the very basic principle \r\nthat the decisions of the Council, as a cornerstone for \r\nsettling problems relating to international peace and \r\nsecurity, have a unique legitimacy. \r\n We are well aware of the criticism that \r\ntraditionally accompanies the discussion of this \r\ndocument in the General Assembly, which is \r\nessentially that the report is not analytical enough but \r\nis only a factual depiction of the work of the Council \r\nover the past year. However, we do not agree that that \r\nis a matter for concern. We believe that the purpose of \r\nthe document is to give a complete and factually \r\naccurate account of the work of the Council over the \r\npast year, and the report does this. With regard to the \r\napproaches taken by members of the Council to the \r\nvarious issues on its agenda, Members States have \r\nother opportunities to learn about those approaches. \r\n In that connection, I should like to say, and not \r\nfor the first time, that there has been a positive \r\nevolution in the working methods of the Security \r\nCouncil. The Council is broadening its practice of \r\nholding open debates and briefings — there is an \r\nincreasing number of these each year, and the past year \r\nwas no exception. This can be seen clearly from the \r\nstatistics cited in the report. \r\n The Security Council must continue to strike a \r\nreasonable balance between transparency and \r\neffectiveness in the understanding that the main \r\nobjective must be to enhance the potential of the \r\nCouncil to exercise the powers ascribed to it under the \r\nCharter in the area of the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security. \r\n We call for greater interaction between the \r\nCouncil and the General Assembly. Here, we should \r\nconcentrate on those areas where genuine cooperation \r\nbetween these two principal organs is not only possible \r\nbut necessary. There are quite a number of such areas. \r\nFor example, we can look at the very relevant issue of \r\nhow to enhance the effectiveness of United Nations \r\npeacekeeping and peacebuilding. There is also scope \r\nfor joint efforts in dealing with mediation. The Security \r\nCouncil and the General Assembly can make a real \r\ncontribution here. The main focus should be to ensure \r\nthat cooperation between the two bodies takes into \r\naccount their respective powers, and success will \r\ndepend on our doing that. \r\n Russia, as a permanent member of the Security \r\nCouncil, is in favour of enhancing the effectiveness of \r\nthe work of the Council by, among other means, \r\nmaking it more representative. However, in pursuing \r\nthis goal, we should be careful not to adversely affect \r\nthe operational capacity of the Council. That premise is \r\nfundamental to our approach to the question of \r\nSecurity Council reform. \r\n Russia’s position is well known. We are in favour \r\nof maintaining a relatively small Security Council and \r\nwe regard the idea that there could be any infringement \r\non the powers, including the veto, of the current \r\npermanent members as counterproductive. Any change \r\nin the status quo here could become an insurmountable \r\nobstacle to having amendments to the Charter approved \r\nby national ratification procedures, primarily in the \r\ncase of the five permanent members of the Council. \r\n We also fully believe that reform of the Council \r\nmust enjoy the broadest possible support among the \r\nmembership. If we are unable to reach a consensus, it \r\nwill be politically necessary to garner the support of a \r\nmajority of Member States over and above the legally \r\nrequired two thirds majority of the General Assembly. \r\n A/64/PV.44\r\n \r\n3 09-60619 \r\n \r\nProposed models for reform have not yet gained \r\noverwhelming support. An attempt to push these \r\nmodels through by putting them to a vote would \r\ninevitably polarize the Assembly. And, even if one of \r\nthe drafts were to get the required two thirds of votes, \r\nthe Council would hardly gain in stature in the eyes of \r\nthe dissenting minority, which, of course, would count \r\nmany influential States among its number. \r\n We stand ready to consider any sensible option \r\nfor broadening Security Council membership, \r\nincluding through an interim model, provided that it \r\nenjoys the broadest possible support within the United \r\nNations. \r\n Unfortunately, three rounds of intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations have not done much to narrow the \r\ndifferences between Member States on the ultimate \r\nformula for reforming the Security Council, so we see \r\nno option other than to continue at this session of the \r\nAssembly the painstaking effort of intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations that we began last February. The work \r\nmust be done in a calm, transparent and inclusive \r\nmanner, without imposing any artificial deadlines. It \r\nwould be counterproductive to narrow the focus \r\nprematurely to just one or two options. We have to \r\ndiscuss all of the existing negotiating options.  \r\n The President took the Chair. \r\n In conclusion, I would stress that our ability to \r\nmake progress at the negotiations will depend on the \r\npolitical will of Member States and their readiness to \r\nreach a reasonable compromise. \r\n Mr. Takasu (Japan): Mr. President, I would like \r\nto thank you for convening this plenary meeting to \r\ndiscuss matters of great importance to the United \r\nNations: the reform of the Security Council and the \r\nannual report on the work of the Security Council \r\n(A/64/2). I also wish to extend my appreciation to \r\nAmbassador Thomas Mayr-Harting of Austria for \r\nintroducing the report in his capacity as President of \r\nthe Council. \r\n Reform of the Security Council is long overdue. \r\nThe current composition of the Security Council does \r\nnot reflect the realities of the international community \r\nin the twenty-first century. It is thus essential to ensure \r\nthat today’s new realities are fully reflected in a \r\nsubstantial change in the status quo of the Council. \r\n At the World Summit in September 2005, the \r\nleaders of all Member States affirmed unanimously that \r\nearly reform of the Security Council is an essential \r\nelement in the overall effort to reform the United \r\nNations. And they agreed that it is necessary to make \r\nthe Security Council more broadly representative and \r\nto further enhance its effectiveness and the legitimacy \r\nand implementation of its decisions. All Member States \r\nare bound by their leaders’ commitment and their \r\npromise to realize early reform of the Security Council. \r\n Moving on from the 15-year-long consultations \r\nof the Open-ended Working Group, we entered into the \r\nnegotiation stage, and the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations commenced in the informal plenary of the \r\nGeneral Assembly last February. After three rounds of \r\nnegotiations, on 14 September 2009, the General \r\nAssembly adopted decision 63/565 to commence the \r\nnegotiations immediately, building on the progress \r\nachieved during the sixty-third session as well as on \r\nthe positions of and proposals made by Member States. \r\n Thus, the task before us now is not to question \r\nthe need and purpose of reform, but to act and deliver \r\non the unanimous commitment in the form of concrete \r\nsolutions at the earliest possible date. \r\n We are therefore grateful to you, Mr. President, \r\nfor the high priority you have assigned to the early \r\nrealization of Security Council reform, in accordance \r\nwith the General Assembly decision. At the opening \r\nsession, Sir, you stressed that realizing reform of the \r\nSecurity Council is of the utmost importance in the \r\nsixty-fourth session. \r\n Following the general debate, Mr. President, you \r\ninformed us in your letters that it is imperative that we \r\ncontinue during the current session to build on \r\nprevious positive developments, as we work to achieve \r\nreform at the earliest opportunity. And you have \r\nreappointed Ambassador Zahir Tanin to chair the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on your behalf. We \r\nthank Ambassador Tanin for his important \r\ncontributions to moving the negotiation process \r\nforward during the previous session. Mr. President, we \r\nhope that you and Ambassador Tanin will together \r\nexercise strong leadership in guiding us towards \r\nachieving a concrete outcome during this session. \r\n It is Japan’s firm belief that reform should entail \r\nexpansion of both the permanent and the \r\nnon-permanent membership categories in order to \r\nreflect today’s global political reality. An enlarged \r\nSecurity Council should include on a permanent basis \r\nthose Member States that have well demonstrated the \r\nA/64/PV.44  \r\n \r\n09-60619 4 \r\n \r\nreadiness, capacity and resources to carry through \r\nimplementation of Security Council decisions.  \r\n In the general debate at the end of September (see \r\nA/64/PV.5), in this Hall, Prime Minister Yukio \r\nHatoyama confirmed this goal by stating that Japan \r\nwould continue to engage actively in the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, pursuing the expansion \r\nof both permanent and non-permanent membership \r\ncategories as well as Japan’s permanent membership in \r\nthe Council. \r\n In our view, only through expansion of both \r\ncategories can the Council sufficiently enhance its \r\neffectiveness and legitimacy in the implementation of \r\nits decisions. I believe that that is why the \r\noverwhelming majority of Member States, including \r\nthe African, Caribbean and Pacific Island States, \r\ncontinue to support the option of expanding both \r\ncategories in the negotiations during the last session as \r\nwell as in this morning’s meeting. \r\n The momentum for reform has sustained itself. \r\nIntergovernmental negotiations have begun and the \r\npositions of Member States are well defined. It is now \r\nhigh time to seek a solution that will garner the \r\nbroadest possible support and achieve a tangible result. \r\nThat is going to be our urgent task in the current \r\nsession. Further delay in achieving a concrete outcome \r\nwill only exacerbate the disappointment with the \r\nUnited Nations on the part of many Governments and \r\nresult in questioning the ability of the membership to \r\nrejuvenate and reform from within. \r\n We should not permit ourselves at this session to \r\nengage in procedural debates or repeat what transpired \r\nin the sixty-third session. We should build upon the \r\nprogress made so far and advance to the next stage of \r\nthe negotiations from the point reached at the end of \r\nthe sixty-third session. The positions of all Member \r\nStates have become much more clearly defined now. \r\nTherefore, in order to realize early reform, we should \r\nbegin substantive negotiations based on the positions \r\nof Member States. \r\n How do we start this next phase of substantive \r\nnegotiations and try to narrow our differences as much \r\nas possible? It is essential to have a brief option paper \r\nthat can serve as a basis for negotiations. Such a paper \r\ncould summarize options and positions presented by \r\nMember States that are likely to garner the broadest \r\npossible support among Member States.  \r\n In our view, as in the case of past negotiations in \r\nthe United Nations, the Chair of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations is in the best position to prepare such a \r\npaper, in consultation with the President of the General \r\nAssembly. We urge that the Chairman be entrusted with \r\nthat task at the earliest possible time. However, if, for \r\nwhatever reason, he is not in a position to formulate \r\nsuch a paper for the negotiations, we should find other, \r\nMember State-driven ways to produce it. \r\n My delegation, together with other Member \r\nStates, is determined to engage constructively and with \r\na sense of urgency in the substantive negotiations, with \r\na view to attaining a concrete outcome during the \r\ncurrent session. \r\n Whatever the extent to which the Council is \r\nexpanded, its membership will comprise no more than \r\na fraction of the total number of Member States. \r\nTherefore, it is essential that the Council continue to \r\nmake its decision-making process more transparent and \r\naccountable to all Member States. It is also essential to \r\nprovide assurances to all Member States that the \r\nSecurity Council is acting on behalf of all of them, so \r\nthat the entire membership continues to accept its \r\ndecisions, in accordance with Article 25 of the Charter.  \r\n For the Council to maintain its legitimacy, all \r\nMember States must be convinced that decisions of the \r\nCouncil are outcomes that fully reflect the diverse \r\npositions, perspectives and concerns of the entire \r\nmembership. Therefore, communication between the \r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly needs to be \r\ncontinually improved. The annual report of the \r\nSecurity Council is one of the important tools needed \r\nto ensure this accountability. \r\n Japan therefore welcomes that the annual reports \r\nof the Security Council have developed in line with the \r\nrecommendations contained in presidential note \r\nS/2006/507, which was adopted under Japan’s \r\npresidency. I commend the efforts made by Uganda in \r\ndrafting and coordinating this year’s report aimed at \r\nmaking it a comprehensive account of the main work \r\nby the Security Council for the past 12 months. Japan \r\nwill join in effort to further improve its quality, taking \r\ninto consideration the comments made by the general \r\nmembership in today’s debate as well as in the \r\ninformal consultation organized jointly by Uganda, \r\nAustria and Viet Nam. The Informal Working Group on \r\nDocumentation and Other Procedural Questions, which \r\n A/64/PV.44\r\n \r\n5 09-60619 \r\n \r\nI am chairing, will also reflect those comments in its \r\nfuture work. \r\n Improving the working methods of the Security \r\nCouncil is important to increase the Council’s \r\nefficiency and transparency and to revitalize its \r\neffectiveness. Japan has been making contributions to \r\nimprove interaction between the Council and the \r\ngeneral membership. I would like to reiterate Japan’s \r\nreadiness to continue its efforts to improve the working \r\nmethods of the Security Council. \r\n Mr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): There is a \r\nstrong substantive connection between the two agenda \r\nitems under consideration today. We thus welcome the \r\njoint debate and hope that it will offer guidance to you, \r\nSir, and your team in shaping the future course of \r\naction in the Assembly.  \r\n The report of the Security Council (A/64/2) is a \r\ncentral channel of communication between the Council \r\nand the rest of the membership, on whose behalf the \r\nCouncil carries out its work. Like many others, we \r\ntherefore take a particular interest in this report, \r\ncompounded by our ongoing engagement in the area of \r\nworking methods as a member of the group of five \r\nsmall nations (S-5). Together with others, we have long \r\nheld the view that the report in its traditional format \r\ndoes not serve the purpose of accountability, but we \r\nalso believe that the ritualistic complaints in the annual \r\ndebate on the report about its lack of analysis are little \r\nproductive.  \r\n We are happy to acknowledge, first of all, the \r\nefforts made in producing this year’s report, in \r\nparticular by the delegation of Uganda during its \r\npresidency in the month of July. We also appreciated \r\nthe opportunity given to us at the end of October to \r\nengage in an informal exchange on the report. But most \r\nimportantly, we are grateful that the members of the \r\nSecurity Council were willing to discuss with the S-5 \r\nthe format of the report and the difficulties encountered \r\nin its drafting, and to exchange ideas on how the \r\nprocess could be improved. We were also most \r\nappreciative for your presence in this discussion, Sir, \r\ngiven the particular role of your Office in the \r\nconsideration of the report. \r\n We look forward to continuing our work as the \r\nS-5 and together with Council members and other \r\nStates on concrete measures to improve this report and \r\nto better use the opportunity to exchange views on it. \r\nWe are under no illusion as to the feasibility of a report \r\ncontaining a fully fledged political analysis of the work \r\nof the Security Council. That is indeed not a realistic \r\ndemand, but certainly there is ample room for \r\nimprovement. Linkages between topics — in particular \r\nbetween country situations and thematic issues — can \r\nbe illustrated, and the report could also deal with cross-\r\ncutting issues, for example the discussions on the \r\nrelationship between peace and justice that took place \r\nin the Council over the past year. And we can certainly \r\nfind better ways to engage each other on the contents \r\nof the report.  \r\n One aspect of the report that is of particular \r\ninterest to us naturally is the way it deals with the issue \r\nof working methods. The view is often advanced, and \r\nhas been expressed here today, that the Council is the \r\nmaster of its own procedures and therefore of all \r\nmatters related to its working methods. If that is so, \r\nwhat better place than the annual report of the Council \r\nto inform on developments in the area of working \r\nmethods and what better opportunity to update on \r\nprogress made in the implementation of presidential \r\nnote S/2006/507?  \r\n Meanwhile, the report provides no information on \r\nactual developments in the area of working methods, \r\neven though some have occurred. There is a largely \r\ntechnical reference to the open debate of the Council \r\non the matter in August 2008 and an equally meagre \r\nsummary of the Informal Working Group on \r\nDocumentation and Other Procedural Questions, \r\nwhich, incidentally, seems to be the only working \r\ngroup of the Security Council that does not produce its \r\nown annual report.  \r\n The interest of the larger membership in the issue \r\nof working methods is well known and has been \r\ndocumented extensively during the discussions on \r\nSecurity Council reform. We hope that this interest will \r\nbe met by the Council in future reports and that the \r\nconsideration of the annual report can also offer an \r\nopportunity for an exchange on working methods. \r\n The S-5 continues to work on two tracks to \r\nimprove the working methods of the Council, first in \r\nthe General Assembly in the overall framework of the \r\nwork on Security Council reform, and secondly, \r\nthrough direct engagement with Council members on a \r\nnumber of issues in which we take particular interest, \r\nsome of which will be mentioned by other S-5 \r\nmembers in this debate. We encourage the participation \r\nof other States that share the same interests, such as in \r\nA/64/PV.44  \r\n \r\n09-60619 6 \r\n \r\nthe case of the efforts to promote fair and clear \r\nsanctions procedures. Last year a formal proposal was \r\nsubmitted on that issue by some from within the S-5 \r\nand other Member States.  \r\n The progress on working methods is not \r\nconditioned on or linked to a decision in the area of \r\nenlargement, given the different nature of the two \r\nprocesses. At the same time, a comprehensive solution \r\nthat encompasses decisive steps in both areas remains \r\nour ideal goal. \r\n With respect to the enlargement discussion, we \r\nwant to first thank Ambassador Tanin and his team for \r\ntheir tireless efforts and the skilful manner in which \r\nthey guided the process at the sixty-third session. They \r\nare the last ones to blame for the lack of progress. At \r\nthe same time, this lack of progress has only \r\nstrengthened our conviction that the way to an early \r\nsolution — if that is what we want, and to which we all \r\ncommitted in 2005 — is the intermediate approach. It \r\noffers a solution that is ratifiable, sustainable and yet \r\nflexible. We also see, of course, that flexibility and \r\nwillingness to compromise are still minimal at best. It \r\nappears that the political momentum necessary for \r\nenlargement can be created only through challenges to \r\nthe role and legitimacy of the Council that are not yet \r\nfully felt. \r\n For our part, we will continue to give our support \r\nto Ambassador Tanin and his team in their future \r\nefforts. \r\n Mr. Davide (Philippines): Forthwith, the \r\nPhilippines commends you, Sir, for convening this \r\nplenary meeting for a joint debate on agenda item 9, on \r\nthe report of the Security Council, and agenda item \r\n119, on Security Council reform. As to the latter, the \r\nPhilippines praises you, Sir, for the great importance \r\nyou place on Security Council reform. The Philippines \r\nremains encouraged and inspired by the views \r\nexpressed in your acceptance speech on 10 June 2009 \r\n(see A/63/PV.86) and the assurance you made in your \r\nfirst address at the opening of the sixty-fourth session \r\nof the General Assembly on 15 September 2009 (see \r\nA/64/PV.1) that reform of the Security Council must \r\ncontinue to be one of our priorities and that we should \r\nmake every effort to achieve it as soon as possible. \r\n The Philippines thanks Ambassador Thomas \r\nMayr-Harting of Austria for introducing the annual \r\nreport of the Security Council (A/64/2) and \r\ncongratulates the Austrian presidency on its able and \r\ndynamic stewardship of the Council for the month of \r\nNovember 2009. The Philippines also thanks Uganda \r\nfor preparing the report under its presidency in July \r\n2009, and places on record its gratitude to Viet Nam \r\nfor initiating efforts during its presidency of the \r\nCouncil in July 2008 to improve the manner of \r\npreparing the report by seeking the views of Member \r\nStates during its drafting stage. \r\n The Philippines also takes this opportunity to pay \r\nspecial tribute to the efforts of Mr. Miguel d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann, President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-third session, for finally starting during his watch \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform mandated in General Assembly decision \r\n62/557. Of course, commendations are also in order for \r\nAmbassador Zahir Tanin, Permanent Representative of \r\nAfghanistan, for his work as chair of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations and for his \r\nreappointment as chair of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations during the sixty-fourth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. His reappointment is not only a \r\nrecognition of his integrity, skills and capabilities; it \r\nwill also ensure that work will continue from where we \r\nleft off in September 2009. His reappointment is a \r\nblessing because he cannot afford to fail. \r\n We are again at a time of the year when the \r\nGeneral Assembly engages in the ritual of a joint \r\ndebate on the report of the Security Council and on \r\nSecurity Council reform. In past years, we have seen \r\nthe same thing over and over again — almost identical \r\nformats or presentations of Security Council reports \r\nand a continuing standstill in Security Council reform \r\nefforts. The Philippines wishes to state nonetheless that \r\nthis year is a little different, although the report of the \r\nSecurity Council seems to appear as a rerun despite the \r\nsincere attempts of the Security Council, since Viet \r\nNam’s presidency in July 2008, to make the report \r\nmore relevant, insightful, comprehensive, informative \r\nand analytical. Despite these efforts, the report has \r\nremained more or less the same.  \r\n The Philippines maintains its view that the \r\nSecurity Council should consider changes to the report, \r\nincluding its format, to make it more of a genuine \r\nreport rather than a mere compendium as it is now. It is \r\nalways pointed out that the format of the report \r\ncorresponds to relevant provisions of the notes by the \r\nPresident contained in documents S/2006/507 and \r\nS/2007/749, which are the outcomes of the work of the \r\nSecurity Council Informal Working Group on \r\n A/64/PV.44\r\n \r\n7 09-60619 \r\n \r\nDocumentation and Other Procedural Questions. The \r\nPhilippines recommends that the Working Group \r\nconsider this matter once again and, accordingly, make \r\nthe appropriate recommendations, proposals and \r\nsuggestions to the members of the Council. Once \r\nagain, the Philippines reiterates its view that the \r\nCouncil should take note of how the repertoire of the \r\npractice of the Security Council presents information \r\nand consider combining or merging the annual report \r\nand the repertoire. \r\n In the long, discouraging, frustrating, exasperating \r\nand even painful history of Security Council reform, \r\nthe sixty-third session of the General Assembly may \r\nyet be remembered as a session of encouraging \r\ntransition and great promise. In that session, the general \r\nmembership finally resolved by specific action — and \r\neven expressed that resolve in body language — to be \r\nmore dynamic and bold and to exercise some political \r\nwill to pursue the mandate of General Assembly \r\ndecision 62/557 to commence intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. After two decades of embarrassing sojourn \r\nwithin the confines of the Open-Ended Working Group \r\nand of repeating the same old arguments day in and \r\nday out, the gates are now open for negotiations that \r\nwill, we hope, bring forth a harvest of agreements on \r\nSecurity Council reform.  \r\n Of course, the Philippines notes the difficulty of \r\ncutting the umbilical cord of the Open-ended Working \r\nGroup, as seen in paragraph 17 (c) of its report \r\ncontained in document A/63/47, which states that the \r\nGeneral Assembly can convene the Open-ended \r\nWorking Group “if Member States so decide”. The \r\nPhilippines hopes the General Assembly will not so \r\ndecide, for if it does it will, sadly, be brought back to \r\nwhere it started. With vim, vigour, vitality and political \r\nwill, it must concentrate on intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations.  \r\n We have already crossed the Rubicon, so to \r\nspeak. When Member States began intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, they put an end, for all intents and \r\npurposes, to the Open-ended Working Group. We are \r\nnow on the other side of the Rubicon and, like Julius \r\nCaesar, we can now declare “alea iacta est” — the die \r\nis cast. The general membership now has no choice but \r\nto go forward with abiding good faith and work on \r\nSecurity Council reform. The Philippines commends \r\nAmbassador Tanin for his work in chairing the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations during the sixty-third \r\nsession.  \r\n The several rounds of negotiations convened by \r\nhim, broken down into a series of exchanges, have \r\nallowed the many stakeholders to put forward, explain \r\nand debate their proposals. The Philippines submitted \r\nits own specific Security Council reform proposals in \r\nits note verbale dated 14 February 2009, sent to the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-third \r\nsession and the Chairman of the Open-ended Working \r\nGroup, and in its note verbale dated 16 February 2009, \r\nsent to the Permanent Representatives to the United \r\nNations. The Philippines reiterated, amplified and \r\nsupplemented all these proposals during the long \r\ndiscussions in the rounds and exchanges. \r\n In its statement at the 24th informal meeting of \r\nthe plenary on intergovernmental negotiations held on \r\n22 June 2009, the Philippines even submitted draft \r\nresolutions to implement various reform proposals. \r\nThere is no need to further elaborate on them, since \r\nthey are already well known to all delegations. What is \r\nneeded now is action, action, action. There should be \r\nno turning back. \r\n The Philippines respectfully submits that \r\ndelegations should now work on draft documents or \r\npapers so that discussions can be more focused. The \r\ndraft can come from the Chairman or be the product of \r\nthe general membership itself. It is of paramount \r\nimportance that all of the proposals on the key issues \r\nbe reflected in the draft. \r\n At this juncture, the Philippines maintains its \r\nposition that what can be adopted now must be \r\napproved now. It cannot subscribe to the concept that \r\n“nothing is agreed unless everything is agreed”. Such a \r\nconcept is undemocratic, divisive, irrational, unjust and \r\noppressive. Yielding to it would spell disaster for all \r\nefforts towards reform of the United Nations. In this \r\nregard, the Philippines calls on the Security Council \r\nitself to act now on reforming its working methods to \r\nmake them truly democratic, transparent, accountable \r\nand genuinely observant of the requirements of the rule \r\nof law and due process. It should not place itself in the \r\nembarrassing situation where it could be prodded \r\nagain, for instance, to simply delete the word \r\n“provisional” in the title of its provisional rules of \r\nprocedure. \r\n My delegation hopes and prays that the General \r\nAssembly, through our determined, sustained and \r\nunceasing efforts, will be able to muster the necessary \r\npolitical will and come up with a positive outcome on \r\nA/64/PV.44  \r\n \r\n09-60619 8 \r\n \r\nSecurity Council reform by the end of the sixty-fourth \r\nsession. The Philippines will do its part towards \r\nachieving this outcome. The outcome could be \r\nmomentous, if we desire and will it. It is all up to \r\nMember States. As the Latin maxim goes, velle est \r\nposse — where there is a will, there is a way.  \r\n Mr. Sial (Pakistan): I would like to thank the \r\nPermanent Representative of Austria, President of the \r\nSecurity Council for this month, for presenting the \r\nCouncil’s annual report (A/64/2) to the General \r\nAssembly. The report of the Security Council under \r\nreview is a comprehensive compendium of its meetings \r\nand decisions. It can be appreciated for its procedural \r\naccuracies and reference value. However, a certain \r\nlevel of analytical depth would certainly add to its \r\nvalue. \r\n The Security Council is the principal organ \r\nresponsible for the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security. It acts on behalf of the entire membership \r\nof the United Nations. Today’s meeting provides an \r\nopportunity for the entire membership to review the \r\nwork of the Security Council and to assess our \r\ncollective efforts to achieve a comprehensive reform of \r\nthat body. \r\n Our brief review of the work of the Security \r\nCouncil will focus on two dimensions: first, its \r\neffectiveness in maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity, and secondly, its ability to reflect the views \r\nand interests of the widest possible membership. In \r\nterms of the Council’s effectiveness, the annual report \r\ndetails significant achievements in addressing the areas \r\nof violent conflict and peacekeeping. Peacekeeping has \r\nbeen utilized to good effect in several complex crises \r\nin Africa. Elsewhere, in Asia, Latin America and \r\nEastern Europe, peacekeeping activities have \r\naccomplished the significant task of disengaging \r\nparties to violent conflict. In the areas of civilian \r\nsupport programmes and peacebuilding, important \r\naccomplishments can also be noted. The Council \r\ndeserves our appreciation for its invaluable work in \r\nthose areas. \r\n The Council, however, needs to recalibrate its \r\nefforts in conflict prevention and relapse, particularly \r\nin the context of the resolution of outstanding disputes \r\nbetween Member States. Major unresolved issues, \r\nincluding in our own region, remain asleep on the \r\nagenda of the Security Council. Even in the case of \r\nsome important issues on the active agenda, \r\nparticularly the Middle East, the Council seems to have \r\nabdicated its role. The Council needs to address that \r\nperception. \r\n The second dimension of the Security Council’s \r\nassessment is the matter of its openness and \r\ntransparency. Unfortunately, in this area, the annual \r\nreport fails to offer sufficient information or analysis, \r\nparticularly with regard to the Council’s decision-\r\nmaking process. It is widely noted here that decisions \r\nare developed mostly in closed-door meetings, if not \r\nbehind the scenes, by a few key States. The decisions, \r\naccordingly, lack transparency and inclusiveness. \r\n Rectifying this trend is part of our general debate \r\non the Council’s reform and restructuring. In the short \r\nterm, this concern can be addressed by improving the \r\nCouncil’s institutional interaction with the General \r\nAssembly and the Economic and Social Council \r\nthrough regular briefings by the Security Council \r\npresidency to the President of the General Assembly. \r\n That brings me to the other aspect of our debate \r\ntoday, that is, the reform of the Security Council. \r\nPakistan is committed to achieving the comprehensive \r\nreform of the Security Council that will make it more \r\nrepresentative, transparent, accountable and effective, \r\nthus enhancing its legitimacy and credibility. The \r\nquestion before the Member States is how to achieve \r\nthis objective. Our delegation firmly believes that the \r\nanswer lies not in enlarging the coterie of the powerful \r\nfew but in strengthening the democratic representation, \r\nrole and influence of the general membership of the \r\nUnited Nations in the Security Council. We believe that \r\nimportant work was done in the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations during the previous session. It is, \r\nhowever, clear that we are far from achieving a \r\nsolution that can garner the widest possible support of \r\nthe Member States. \r\n We can outline three areas of convergence among \r\nthe Member States on the general principles of the \r\nreform process. First, the reform has to be \r\ncomprehensive and based on the principle of \r\naddressing all five key issues of reform: size, working \r\nmethods, categories, the power of veto and \r\ngeographical representation. The tendency to identify \r\nreform only with the expansion of membership must be \r\nchecked. Secondly, the reform must make the Security \r\nCouncil diverse and plural in the context of \r\ngeographical representation. Therefore, the reform \r\nmust entail rectifying the underrepresentation of Africa \r\n A/64/PV.44\r\n \r\n9 09-60619 \r\n \r\nand small States. Thirdly, the reform must not be \r\nimposed by a few but enjoy the widest possible support \r\nof the membership. The sense of ownership by the \r\nMember States of the United Nations system demands \r\nthat the reform process should aim at a win-win \r\nsolution for all. Only an inclusive process can address \r\nthis challenge. \r\n Pakistan believes that, in order to achieve real \r\nprogress on Security Council reform, a modicum of \r\nflexibility and compromise is needed. We can say with \r\nconfidence that the position of the Uniting for \r\nConsensus group is flexible and realistic. It allows \r\nvariable arrangements and different possibilities and \r\noptions, including rotation and longer-term presence \r\nthrough re-election, and provides a greater relevance to \r\ngeographical representation. In this regard, the \r\nproposal submitted by Italy and Colombia in April \r\n2009 can provide a solid platform from which to \r\nachieve a workable formula. Accordingly, we can work \r\non the creation of long-term seats based on \r\ngeographical representation, with the principles of \r\nrotation, realistic approaches to reform of the veto and \r\nworkable measures to improve not only working \r\nmethods but also relations between the Council and the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n We believe that such a formula reflects complex \r\ncurrent realities. These current realities consist of a few \r\nlarge Powers, a number of medium-sized States, a \r\nmajority of smaller States and the emergence of \r\nregional organizations, which are playing important \r\nroles in international and regional peace and security. It \r\nalso takes into account the concept of equitable \r\ngeographical distribution, as envisaged in Article 23 of \r\nthe Charter.  \r\n The concept of equitable geographical distribution \r\nwould make little sense if a seat allocated to a region \r\nwere to be occupied permanently by one country. That \r\nis why we respect and understand Africa’s position. \r\nAfrica’s demand for permanent seats is for the entire \r\nregion and is therefore different from other proposals \r\nthat seek permanent membership for individual States. \r\nAs we understand it, of the two empowered Council \r\nseats which are sought by Africa, two or, through \r\nrotation, a larger number of African States could be \r\nrepresented, under arrangements to be made by Africa \r\nitself. Africa would thus retain the power to ensure \r\naccountability on the part of those States that would \r\nrepresent it and act on its behalf on the Council. \r\n In conclusion, Mr. President, my delegation \r\nbelieves that your role as President of the General \r\nAssembly is very important in steering the reform \r\nprocess forward. In this regard, we will encourage your \r\nclose supervision and leadership during the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. We will also take this \r\nopportunity to urge all Member States to approach the \r\nissue with flexibility and compromise, in the spirit of \r\nmutual good will, to achieve effective and enduring \r\nreform of the Security Council. \r\n Mr. Heller (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): May I \r\nbegin by thanking you, Mr. President, for organizing \r\nthis joint debate, in which Member States have the \r\nopportunity to discuss not only the content of the \r\nannual report of the Security Council (A/64/2), of \r\nwhich Mexico has been an elected member since \r\nJanuary, but also Security Council reform, a subject my \r\ncountry considers to be particularly important. I would \r\nalso like to thank the President of the Security Council, \r\nour colleague the Permanent Representative of Austria, \r\nfor his introduction of the annual report of the Council \r\nto the General Assembly. \r\n Allow me to begin with the issue of Security \r\nCouncil reform. I will not restate here Mexico’s \r\nposition on every aspect of reform, since it is well \r\nknown to all and we have expressed it fully during the \r\nnegotiations. More usefully, I will discuss the \r\nnegotiation process and its prospects over the \r\nforthcoming rounds of talks. \r\n Since the Assembly’s adoption of decision 62/557 \r\nand the start of intergovernmental negotiations, Security \r\nCouncil reform has acquired particular relevance. We \r\nhave embarked on an open and enriching process that, \r\ngiven the necessary flexibility, will lead us to \r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council. In \r\nkeeping with decision 62/557, Security Council reform \r\nconsists of five main aspects, which we have addressed \r\nboth separately and jointly during the three rounds of \r\nnegotiations. This exercise served to confirm that the \r\nfive aspects are so closely interlinked that it is \r\nimpossible to deal with one without taking the rest into \r\naccount, as you rightly pointed out this morning, \r\nMr. President. \r\n Besides familiarizing ourselves with the \r\ntraditional positions of the Member States, during the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations we made significant \r\nprogress and were able to discuss and analyse \r\ninnovative proposals that confirmed the commitment of \r\nA/64/PV.44  \r\n \r\n09-60619 10 \r\n \r\nall Member States to comprehensive Security Council \r\nreform. We were also able to establish that some \r\ndelegations are willing to show the flexibility \r\nnecessary to achieving reform acceptable to every \r\nMember State. \r\n Mexico was particularly pleased with the debate \r\nthat took place for the very first time at the initiative of \r\nthe Uniting for Consensus movement, on what is \r\nknown as the intermediate position. We believe we \r\nshould intensify these discussions in order to gauge the \r\nfull scope of this position, which, seen as it is as a \r\ncompromise solution between the most extreme \r\npositions, would allow us to reconcile everyone’s \r\nwishes and achieve genuine, comprehensive reform of \r\nthe Security Council. We must, however, be aware that \r\nthis cannot be achieved if we continue to insist on \r\ntraditional positions or to attempt unilateral initiatives \r\nthat seek partial reform out of self-interest. Such \r\nproposals will only divide Members and lead us ever \r\nfurther from our common goal. \r\n My delegation is ready and willing to pursue the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations process at this session, \r\nin the context of the General Assembly’s informal \r\nmeetings. We do so in the constructive spirit of \r\ncooperation and flexibility we have consistently \r\nmaintained, in order to achieve a comprehensive \r\nreform of the Council enjoying the broadest possible \r\nsupport of Member States. Security Council reform is \r\nurgent and essential. We feel certain that through your \r\nleadership and active participation, Mr. President — as \r\nwe heard this morning — and with the support of the \r\nfacilitator, Ambassador Tanin of Afghanistan, whom \r\nwe congratulate on his re-election, that we will achieve \r\nconcrete progress in the intergovernmental negotiation \r\nprocess on comprehensive reform of the Security \r\nCouncil. \r\n As an elected member of the Security Council, \r\nMexico was an active and constructive participant in \r\ndrafting the report submitted this year to the General \r\nAssembly, seeking to ensure that the information \r\ncontained in the document is as objective and \r\nsubstantive as possible, and that it faithfully records \r\nthe activities of the Council during the reporting \r\nperiod, particularly the month of April, when Mexico \r\nheld the presidency of the Council. This exercise in \r\ntransparency and analysis is especially apparent in the \r\nintroduction to the annual report. In this regard, we \r\nacknowledge the initiative of the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Uganda, who held informal \r\nconsultations with the General Assembly in order to \r\nkeep members informed about the process of preparing \r\nthe report and get feedback from them before it was \r\nfinalized, following the example of the delegation of \r\nViet Nam in 2008. These initiatives enhance the \r\nCouncil’s transparency and give the report a more \r\nanalytical and substantive quality. We also feel that it \r\nstrengthens relations and dialogue between the Council \r\nand the General Assembly. \r\n In short, the Security Council’s annual report is \r\nan important reference document that covers every \r\nmeeting, statement and communication of the Council \r\nduring the past year, while its introduction presents an \r\nanalysis of the Council’s activities concerning the \r\nvarious items on its agenda. While this analysis has \r\nimproved considerably in recent years, we are aware \r\nthat the annual report should continue to be refined and \r\nthat the General Assembly’s involvement in its \r\npreparation should be increased. \r\n We acknowledge that we have not achieved the \r\nlevels of transparency that the United Nations \r\ncommunity is calling for, but we have made significant \r\nprogress in the sense that a large part of the Council’s \r\nmeetings are now public. That was what we sought to \r\nachieve during our presidency in April, when we \r\nconvened a series of thematic debates of interest to the \r\ngeneral membership and held a considerable number of \r\nopen meetings. During this period, Mexico promoted, \r\nwithin the Council, open debates on the situation in \r\nHaiti, the strengthening of the mediation process, and \r\nchildren in armed conflict. Mexico will continue to \r\nactively pursue this course during its membership of \r\nthe Security Council. \r\n In 2009, as an elected member of the Council, \r\nMexico has sought to promote and adopt decisions that \r\nfoster respect for international humanitarian law, the \r\nrule of law, disarmament and non-proliferation, \r\nmediation and the peaceful settlement of disputes, the \r\nprotection of children in armed conflict, and actions to \r\npromote stability and post-conflict reconstruction. \r\n This year, the Security Council’s agenda has been \r\nquite substantive, as we can see in the annual report. \r\nNonetheless, it is clear that we must continue to make \r\nprogress to ensure that the Council deals with conflicts \r\nin a holistic manner, from the point of view of peace \r\nand security, to include matters relating to promoting \r\ncooperation, to supporting development and strategies \r\nto prevent conflict and undertake post-conflict \r\n A/64/PV.44\r\n \r\n11 09-60619 \r\n \r\nreconstruction, to promoting good management in \r\npublic affairs and to strengthening the rule of law. \r\nMexico will continue to emphasize those concepts as a \r\ncomplement to the traditional perception of collective \r\nsecurity.  \r\n Mr. Viinanen (Finland), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to talk about some \r\nactivities that Mexico will seek to pursue during the \r\nremainder of our mandate that will enhance the \r\nCouncil’s effectiveness and transparency.  \r\n First, we will continue to encourage transparency \r\nin the Security Council’s working methods and to \r\npromote public meetings, open debates and \r\nparticipation of other, regional bodies in meetings in \r\nwhich their contribution is of relevance. We believe \r\nthat it would be productive to reintroduce the practice \r\nof wrap-up meetings at the end of each monthly \r\npresidency of the Council, which could be undertaken \r\nin public, to benefit Council members, to strengthen \r\nour Organization and to benefit States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations. That practice already exists in some of \r\nthe regional groups — for example, the Group of Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean States — and could be \r\nextended to the entire membership. \r\n Secondly, we will pursue our efforts to enhance \r\ninternational crisis prevention relating to mass \r\nviolations of human rights and international \r\nhumanitarian law and to ensure accountability when \r\nsuch violations occur. \r\n Thirdly, we will seek to increase the attention that \r\nthe Council devotes to prevention conflicts and not just \r\nto managing them, incorporating in its resolutions \r\nmandates to link security to the strengthening of \r\nofficial development and humanitarian assistance. \r\n Fourthly, we will continue to strengthen the rule \r\nof law in the Council’s decisions.  \r\n Through our participation in the Security \r\nCouncil, we restate our commitment to maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security and to preserving the \r\nprinciples and purposes of the Charter of the United \r\nNations. As a permanent member of the General \r\nAssembly, we will also continue to actively participate \r\nin the negotiation process for the comprehensive \r\nSecurity Council reform in order to bring it into line \r\nwith the realities of our time. \r\n Mr. Sangqu (South Africa): My delegation is \r\ngrateful for the opportunity to make some remarks on \r\nthese important topics related to the Security Council.  \r\n The central role that the Security Council plays in \r\nthe ordering of international society makes it \r\nimperative that this principal deliberative organ — the \r\nGeneral Assembly — given its universal membership, \r\ncarefully consider the report of the Security Council \r\n(A/64/2). In considering the report, my delegation \r\nremains ever mindful of the urgent need to reform that \r\nvery important body. \r\n The Charter of the United Nations confers on the \r\nSecurity Council the primary responsibility for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. In \r\nexecuting its authority, the Council is endowed with \r\nfar-reaching powers to adopt legally binding decisions \r\nthat take precedence over any other obligations of \r\nMember States. In the light of the immense power \r\nexercised by the Council, both in terms of the impact \r\nof its decisions and its wide discretion, it is therefore \r\nimportant that the Council be fundamentally reformed \r\nin order to render it more democratic, legitimate, \r\nrepresentative, responsive and transparent in its \r\nworking methods and its decision-making processes. \r\n An important element for ensuring transparency \r\nis open debates, open meetings and open briefings in \r\nthe Council. We believe that such meetings allow for \r\ngreater participation by the general membership of the \r\nUnited Nations, especially the affected parties, to put \r\ntheir views across. We therefore consider it a step in \r\nthe right direction to see the increased number of open \r\nmeetings and open debates during the reporting period. \r\nContinuing and improving upon that path will enhance \r\nthe Council’s transparency. \r\n My delegation is also convinced that the Security \r\nCouncil cannot effectively carry out its mandate while \r\ndetached from those communities affected by \r\nsituations on its agenda. We have noted and we \r\nwelcome the Council’s engagement with those affected \r\ndirectly on the ground through, for example, mission \r\nvisits, including to Rwanda, the Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo and Afghanistan. \r\n We continue to argue that another way that the \r\nCouncil can facilitate the involvement of those most \r\nclosely affected by its work is through improving \r\ncooperation and coordination with regional \r\norganizations, as contemplated in Chapter VIII of the \r\nCharter. Given the fact that by far the largest \r\nA/64/PV.44  \r\n \r\n09-60619 12 \r\n \r\npercentage of situations on the agenda of the Council is \r\nin Africa, we believe that there needs to be a concerted \r\neffort towards closer cooperation and coordination with \r\nthe African Union (AU) on peace and security matters.  \r\n As an important step in that direction, we \r\nwelcome the Council’s 16 May 2009 visit to the \r\nAfrican Union Peace and Security Council in Addis \r\nAbaba. While we heard of disturbing attempts to \r\nundermine that important initiative, we hope that \r\nconfidence in its importance will be restored. We look \r\nforward to further improvement of the strategic \r\npartnership between the AU and the United Nations in \r\nthis regard.  \r\n In line with our desire to strengthen the African \r\nUnion-United Nations partnership on peace and \r\nsecurity, and consistent with the spirit of resolution \r\n1809 (2008), we continue to believe that United \r\nNations-assessed contributions will greatly assist the \r\nAfrican Union peacekeeping operations in securing \r\npredictable, sustainable and flexible financing. \r\n Much has been said and done by the Council in \r\nresponse to the concerns of Member States in relation \r\nto transparency, but much more still needs to be done. \r\nFor one thing, my delegation remains concerned that \r\nthe Council still functions on the basis of provisional \r\nrules, which does not allow for predictability. \r\n We unfortunately continue to lament the fact that \r\nthe Security Council has not been successful in \r\nresolving some conflict situations and has failed \r\ndismally to intervene in others. The most serious threat \r\nto the Council’s credibility remains its inability to \r\nresolve protracted conflicts such as those in the Middle \r\nEast and in Western Sahara. It is our hope that the \r\nCouncil will stem the erosion of its credibility by \r\ntranscending its divisions and the national interests of \r\nits members and by uniformly discharging its Charter-\r\nbased mandate to maintain international peace and \r\nsecurity. \r\n I turn my attention now to the question of the \r\nreform of the Security Council. I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly for his expressed \r\ncommitment to advance the process of negotiation to \r\nan early conclusion. That commitment was exemplified \r\nby the prompt reappointment of His Excellency \r\nAmbassador Tanin, the Permanent Representative of \r\nAfghanistan, to continue to facilitate the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations mandated by the \r\nGeneral Assembly decision 62/557. We shall place on \r\nrecord our appreciation for the sterling work done by \r\nAmbassador Tanin during the sixty-third session under \r\ndifficult circumstances and reiterate our support for \r\nhim. We were particularly encouraged by the \r\nconclusion in his letter of 16 July 2009 that the model \r\nwith an expansion in both categories commanded the \r\nmost support, which is a conclusion which we share. \r\n We now want to answer the question as to what is \r\nto be done to advance those negotiations and bring \r\nthem to an early and successful conclusion. In doing \r\nso, there are a number of issues we would like to \r\noutline. \r\n First, perhaps the most important issue that we \r\nwould like to stress is that we need to progress to real \r\nnegotiations. The time for restating our positions ad \r\nnauseum has come and long gone. The positions of \r\ndifferent Members States and groups of States are well \r\nknown and have been canvassed in the course of the \r\nnegotiations. We must therefore avoid regurgitating the \r\nsame positions over and over again, lest we slip into \r\nthe never-ending mode of the Open-ended Working \r\nGroup. \r\n Secondly, my delegation believes that in order to \r\nbuild on the progress made during the sixty-third \r\nsession, we should all provide the facilitator with a \r\nclear mandate to produce a text for negotiations, based \r\non positions communicated over time by Member \r\nStates. We are convinced that without such a \r\nnegotiating text, delegations are likely to restate their \r\npositions. Such a text is imperative to move the process \r\ntowards real negotiations. \r\n Thirdly, and as we have already said, such a \r\npaper — the negotiating text — should attempt to \r\nnarrow down the options, focusing on those that are \r\nlikely to garner the widest required and necessary \r\nsupport. Narrowing the options should be based on \r\nwhat was achieved in the last session, as clearly \r\ncaptured in the facilitator’s letter, which I have just \r\nquoted, that is, that the model with an expansion in \r\nboth categories commanded the most support. \r\n However, we encourage the facilitator to continue \r\nto consult widely with the general membership of the \r\nUnited Nations and be bold enough to allow the \r\nprocess of reform not to be held hostage by a few. \r\nMember States that seek genuine and fundamental \r\nreform of the United Nations in general and the \r\nSecurity Council in particular should openly and \r\nwidely mobilize for that cause and see that the moral \r\n A/64/PV.44\r\n \r\n13 09-60619 \r\n \r\nobligation for reform rests heavily on those who are \r\ncontent with the status quo. We should engage in that \r\ncourse of action for the sake of the very ideals the \r\nOrganization holds dear. \r\n Fourthly, in order not to lose the momentum we \r\nhave already gained, we request that Ambassador Tanin \r\nannounce within the next few days the resumption of \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform. That announcement should also provide \r\ndelegations with a clear schedule of meetings, \r\ndemonstrating a sense of urgency. \r\n Allow us to turn to the substance of negotiations. \r\nMany delegations have emphasized the need for a give-\r\nand-take, compromise-based approach. My delegation \r\nfully shares that view. We believe, however, that such \r\nan approach can take place only in the course of real \r\nnegotiations and not in the course of merely repeating \r\nthe same statements. \r\n The contours of the desired outcome have already \r\nbeen laid out for us in the 2005 World Summit \r\nOutcome, in which our leaders agreed that the Council \r\nhas to be reformed in order to make it more broadly \r\nrepresentative, efficient and transparent in a way that \r\nwould further enhance its effectiveness and the \r\nlegitimacy and implementation of its decisions. \r\n Using the above as our guide for the reform \r\nnegotiations, my delegation believes that the complete \r\nnon-representation of Africa in the permanent category \r\nand the underrepresentation of developing countries in \r\nthe Council in general must be addressed. We will \r\ncontinue to approach those negotiations on the basis of \r\nthe Common African Position as elaborated in the \r\nEzulwini Consensus. Whatever compromises are \r\nreached must ensure effective representation of Africa \r\nin the permanent category of the Council and greater \r\nrepresentation of developing countries. \r\n For us, that means the expansion of the Security \r\nCouncil in both categories. It is self-evident that an \r\nexpansion in only the non-permanent category cannot \r\nmeet the requirements laid out for us by our leaders. \r\nThe question can be asked, however, whether the \r\nintermediary approach — whatever it may mean — \r\nmeets those requirements and accommodates the \r\nlegitimate aspirations of Africa for permanent \r\nrepresentation. We are yet to be convinced of that, for \r\nif it does not address those concerns, then it would be \r\nno more than an attempt to avoid addressing the \r\ninjustices of the current configuration of the Council. \r\n The road before us is going to be hard, but rest \r\nassured that my delegation intends to walk it to its \r\nconclusion, offering our assistance to the President and \r\nto Ambassador Tanin in whatever way we can. \r\n Mr. Benítez Versón (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nCuba recognizes that some efforts have been made to \r\nimprove the quality of the Security Council’s annual \r\nreport (A/64/2). Nonetheless, there is still much to be \r\ndone. The report remains basically a descriptive \r\ndocument, very useful as a reference for libraries but \r\nlacking the analytical approach the Member States \r\nneed to assess the Council’s work. \r\n We insist that the Council should submit annual \r\nreports to the General Assembly that are truly \r\nanalytical and substantive, as well as special reports \r\nthat the Charter stipulates in Articles 15 and 24, which \r\nso far are regrettably conspicuous by their absence. \r\nCuba underlines the Council’s responsibility to render \r\ndue account to the General Assembly since, in \r\nconformity with the Charter, we have entrusted that \r\nbody, of limited membership, with the prime \r\nresponsibility to act on our behalf in maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security. \r\n The Security Council needs urgent and deep \r\nreform. There cannot be true reform of the United \r\nNations until the Council is reformed. Such reform \r\ncannot remain continuously postponed and relegated. \r\nThe complaint of the majority cannot continue to be \r\nignored. \r\n Cuba has engaged actively in the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform. Regrettably, no clear progress in the process \r\nhas been seen. Our greater challenge is to prevent, at \r\nall costs, the negotiation process from becoming a \r\nrepetition of the deliberations that for more than \r\n15 years took place in the General Assembly’s Open-\r\nended Working Group and led nowhere. We must move \r\nto a stage of real negotiation as soon as possible. \r\n Cuba favours an immediate increase in the \r\nmembership of the Security Council, of both \r\npermanent and non-permanent members. The main \r\npurpose cannot be to increase for the sake of increase, \r\nbut to rectify the unjustifiable underrepresentation of \r\ndeveloping countries in the Council. Cuba will not \r\nsupport any partial or selective broadening of the \r\nmembership or of the composition of the members of \r\nthe Council that works to the detriment of developing \r\ncountries. \r\nA/64/PV.44  \r\n \r\n09-60619 14 \r\n \r\n Increasing only the number of non-permanent \r\nseats would further widen the existing huge gap \r\nbetween permanent and non-permanent members. \r\nIncreasing only the number of permanent seats would \r\nmake the Council a body even less representative and, \r\nhence, less legitimate and effective. \r\n There cannot be equitable representation in the \r\nCouncil if developing countries, including entire \r\nregions, remain totally underrepresented in the \r\ncategory of permanent members. How can one justify \r\nthe fact that, while over half of the items on the \r\nCouncil’s agenda refer to problems of Africa, that \r\nregion still does not have a permanent seat on the \r\nCouncil? That is why Cuba fully supports the just \r\ndemand of African countries for such a seat. Other \r\nentire regions do not have permanent representation \r\neither, like Latin America and the Caribbean. \r\n The new seats to be established, including in the \r\ncategory of permanent members, must have exactly the \r\nsame prerogatives and rights enjoyed by the current \r\nseats, without being subject to selective or \r\ndiscriminatory criteria.  \r\n The position of Cuba has been and continues to \r\nbe clear regarding the veto. The veto is an \r\nanachronistic and antidemocratic privilege that must be \r\neliminated as soon as possible. However, as long as the \r\nveto does exist, at the very least a suitable proportion \r\nof developing countries must also be able to exercise it. \r\nThat would be the only way for developing countries to \r\nbe able to make a real impact on the work of the \r\nSecurity Council. To admit new permanent members \r\nwithout the right to the veto would be to create a new \r\ncategory of Council members, which Cuba does not \r\nsupport. There is no justification for developing \r\ncountries entering as new permanent members with a \r\nlesser status than that of the current ones.  \r\n Most of the new permanent and non-permanent \r\nmembers must be developing countries. Permanent \r\nmembership must be granted to at least two countries \r\nin Africa, two developing countries in Asia and two \r\ncountries in Latin America and the Caribbean. \r\n As to the size of the Security Council, Cuba \r\nbelieves that an expanded Council should have no \r\nfewer than 26 members. Thus the ratio between the \r\nnumber of Council members and the membership of \r\nthe Organization would be at least a little closer to the \r\nratio that existed when the Organization was founded. \r\n Reform of the Council must also necessarily \r\ninclude a thorough overhaul of its working methods. \r\nAlthough some modest changes have been made in \r\nrecent years, most of them have been more formal than \r\nsubstantive. The fact is that at present the Security \r\nCouncil is not transparent, democratic or efficient. \r\n We advocate a Security Council in which closed-\r\ndoor consultations are the exception. We aspire to a \r\nCouncil that addresses the matters within its mandate \r\nand does not encroach on or meddle in those within the \r\nmandates of other organs. We want a Council that truly \r\ntakes into account the views of the Organization’s \r\nmembership before taking decisions and that ensures a \r\ndegree of genuine access for States that are not \r\nmembers of that body.  \r\n Finally, I wish to comment on a procedural matter \r\nthat we consider important. Cuba believes that in future \r\nwe must seriously consider whether we should \r\ncontinue to have joint debates on agenda items 9 and \r\n119 in the General Assembly. There is a close link \r\nbetween those two items that by no means should be \r\nignored. At the same time, when delegations have to \r\naddress two highly relevant and comprehensive items \r\nin a single statement, they must omit many important \r\nremarks, and the in-depth consideration that we so \r\nmuch need is not achieved. We believe that the annual \r\nreport of the Security Council and Council reform are \r\nitems that, because of their importance and their \r\nimplications, should be considered separately in the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n Mr. Gutiérrez (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): Clearly, \r\nthe process of Security Council reform is a matter of \r\npriority to be addressed at the sixty-fourth session of \r\nthe General Assembly. In that connection, I would like \r\nto welcome the fact that the President has confirmed \r\nour colleague Mr. Zahir Tanin, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Afghanistan, as chair of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations in the informal plenary \r\non the question of equitable representation on and \r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council and \r\nrelated matters. We are confident that with the \r\nPresident’s support and Ambassador Tanin’s assistance, \r\nsubstantive progress can be made on this important \r\nissue. I also wish to thank Ambassador Thomas Mayr-\r\nHarting, current President of the Security Council, for \r\nintroducing the annual report of that organ (A/64/2).  \r\n In addition to associating itself with the statement \r\nmade by the delegation of Egypt on behalf of the \r\n A/64/PV.44\r\n \r\n15 09-60619 \r\n \r\nNon-Aligned Movement (see A/64/PV.43), my \r\ndelegation would like to make a number of \r\nobservations that we regard as relevant to the issues \r\nbefore us today.  \r\n First, with regard to the annual report of the \r\nSecurity Council, my delegation draws particular \r\nattention to the introduction, which serves as a basis \r\nfor reflection on and analysis of the broad range of \r\ntopics considered by the Council. However, we believe \r\nthat the report’s descriptive content could be \r\ncomplemented by more substantive information about \r\nthe matters addressed, and especially about the \r\ndecisions taken. By knowing more about the Council’s \r\nwork, we could gain a more comprehensive perspective \r\non such matters, and the report would not be limited to \r\nlists of activities.  \r\n Peru firmly believes in multilateralism and \r\ncollective security as essential mechanisms for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, which \r\nis the primary responsibility of the Security Council. In \r\nthat connection, it is indispensable that the Council \r\ncontinue its efforts to enhance the transparency and \r\nopenness of its work. An urgent task is the self-\r\nevaluation that must be undertaken to determine what \r\ntypes of new actions should be carried out to increase \r\nthe efficiency and effectiveness of that work. \r\n My delegation also wishes to refer to an issue to \r\nwhich we attach particular importance: the process of \r\nSecurity Council reform. At the previous session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, we engaged in three rounds of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, which enabled us to \r\nclearly identify the positions expressed by a significant \r\nnumber of delegations of Member States.  \r\n We need a more efficient, transparent, democratic \r\nand representative Security Council that reflects \r\ncurrent international realities. That is why, following \r\nthe three rounds of negotiations, my delegation \r\nbelieves that we should begin to work on the outlines \r\nof a general proposal aimed at the great objective of \r\nCouncil reform. It is vital that the negotiation process \r\nbegin to focus on more substantive points and that we \r\ndesign a negotiation format that goes beyond the \r\nexpression of each Member State’s position on this \r\nissue.  \r\n Peru reiterates once again its conviction that, in \r\norder to adapt the Security Council to new realities, it \r\nis essential to admit new members, permanent and \r\nnon-permanent. That would promote just and equitable \r\nregional representation, which would project a stronger \r\nimage of Council legitimacy. In addition, as my \r\ndelegation has stated, it is time to develop a \r\nconstructive proposal for change to increase the \r\nnumber of new permanent members, which is \r\nimperative if we are to effectively develop a Council \r\nreform process that alters the status quo.  \r\n Furthermore, with regard to the veto, Peru has \r\nconsistently maintained a position of principle aimed at \r\nits ultimate elimination. However, in the same \r\nconstructive spirit, and so as not to deadlock the \r\nnegotiation process, my delegation has stated that a \r\ncommitment should be made to evaluate, at an initial \r\nstage, a restriction on the use of the veto, following a \r\nrule already established in Article 27, paragraph 3, of \r\nthe Charter. In addition, Peru believes it is important to \r\narrive at a consensus that would make it possible to \r\nestablish precise limits for the use of the veto, thus \r\npreventing it from being applied in cases of genocide, \r\ncrimes against humanity and repeated acts in flagrant \r\nviolation of human rights.  \r\n We face the urgent challenge of making \r\nsubstantive progress on this issue, which is of vital \r\nimportance both to the Organization and to all Member \r\nStates. That is why Peru reiterates that the next rounds \r\nof intergovernmental negotiations should take place \r\nwith the idea of beginning a phase in which we can \r\ndraft a text that compiles the concrete elements \r\npertaining to all aspects of this process, so as to \r\ndevelop more effective and concrete negotiations that \r\nwill allow us to achieve the expected tangible results. \r\nPeru is prepared to participate in that process. \r\n Mr. Hoang Chi Trung (Viet Nam): First of all, I \r\nwould like to thank Ambassador Thomas Mayr-\r\nHarting, Permanent Representative of Austria and \r\nPresident of the Security Council for the month of \r\nNovember, for presenting the annual report of the \r\nSecurity Council to the General Assembly (A/64/2). \r\n The Vietnamese delegation wishes to align itself \r\nwith the statement made by the representative of the \r\nArab Republic of Egypt on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement (see A/64/PV.43). \r\n During the period under review, the growing \r\ncomplexity and multidimensionality in international \r\nsituations have presented the Security Council with \r\nfurther challenging responsibilities in shouldering its \r\nnoble mission of maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity. My delegation acknowledges the efforts by \r\nA/64/PV.44  \r\n \r\n09-60619 16 \r\n \r\nthe members of the Council to fulfil those tasks, \r\nparticularly by smoothly managing its hectic \r\nprogramme of work, regularly reviewing and taking \r\nappropriate actions with regard to conflict situations in \r\nAfrica, Europe, the Americas and Asia and consulting \r\nwith concerned parties to react quickly to terrorist acts \r\nand security crises in various regions of the world. \r\n Our delegation also wishes to underscore how \r\nmuch effort and attention the Council devoted to the \r\nconsideration of thematic, general and other issues — \r\nincluding those of peacekeeping, peacebuilding, \r\nmediation, the protection of civilians in armed conflict \r\nand women and peace and security — as well as to the \r\nwork of its subsidiary organs. \r\n The annual report of the Security Council this \r\nyear reflects improvement in terms of both its format \r\nand content. It is a good basis for further substantive \r\ndiscussions in the General Assembly. It is essential that \r\nthe quality of the report be further consolidated in \r\norder to better portray the increased role and \r\ninvolvement of the Council under the current \r\nchallenging circumstances. To be more specific, it is \r\nnecessary to find appropriate ways to reflect in the \r\nreport the concerns of troop- and police- contributing \r\ncountries, the coordination between the Security \r\nCouncil and other United Nations principal organs, the \r\nlegitimate interests of the countries in question and the \r\nrole of regional and subregional organizations in \r\npeacekeeping operations. \r\n In cases where the Council was unable to take \r\naction, the mechanism for how the provisions of \r\nChapter VI of the Charter can be fully utilized for the \r\npacific settlement of disputes also needs to be taken \r\nduly into account. To that end, the Vietnamese \r\ndelegation believes that there is scope to further \r\ndevelop consultations, not only with Council members \r\nbut also with the United Nations membership at large, \r\nin the course of outlining and finalizing the annual \r\nreport to make it more analytical, balanced and \r\nsubstantive. Given the added value and potential \r\ncontributions that might result from those interactions \r\nand inputs, Viet Nam strongly supports continuing the \r\npractice of holding broad consultations with Member \r\nStates during the preparation of the Council’s annual \r\nreport. \r\n With regard to Security Council reform, we are \r\nencouraged by the positive steps during the period \r\nunder review, both inside and outside the Council, to \r\nfurther move that difficult process along. In the face of \r\nan increasing workload, Council members and the \r\nSecretariat have made commendable efforts to enhance \r\nthe Council’s transparency and effectiveness. For \r\ninstance, a number of measures envisaged in the note \r\nby the Council President contained in document \r\nS/2006/507 have been put into play, producing active \r\nresponses from members and parties concerned. As a \r\nresult, as compared to several years ago, the Council \r\nnow holds more public meetings and consults more \r\nfrequently with external actors, including troop-\r\ncontributing countries, regional organizations and \r\nnon-governmental organizations. More opportunity has \r\nalso been provided for associated United Nations \r\nMembers to speak before the Council takes action. \r\n In the General Assembly, under the wise \r\nleadership of Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann, \r\nPresident at the sixty-third session, decision 62/557 \r\nwent into effect in February with the commencement of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Council reform. It is \r\nencouraging that informal meetings on each reform \r\ntopic stimulated active participation by Member States \r\nat every meeting. A large number of Member States \r\nused those opportunities to present their positions and \r\nproposals, in an effort to speed up the reform process \r\nand find a common voice on issues. We hope that such \r\ninvaluable ideas and inputs will be taken into \r\nconsideration in preparing for the next phase of our \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. \r\n However, no breakthrough has been made in the \r\nreform of the Council. The current membership \r\nstructure continues to challenge the fundamental \r\nUnited Nations principles of equality and \r\nrepresentation and proper reflection of the geopolitical \r\nrealities of our time. \r\n In order for the upcoming negotiations to \r\nsucceed, Security Council reform should be addressed \r\nin a more comprehensive, transparent and balanced \r\nmanner. Reforming the Council and its working \r\nmethods must ensure that the Council’s agenda reflects \r\nthe needs and interests of both developing and \r\ndeveloped countries in an objective, rational, \r\nnon-selective and non-arbitrary manner.  \r\n Pending its final elimination, the use of the power \r\nof the veto by the permanent members must be \r\nrestricted. Preventive diplomacy should be further \r\npromoted, along with concerted efforts for the peaceful \r\n A/64/PV.44\r\n \r\n17 09-60619 \r\n \r\nsettlement of conflicts rather than reactive measures \r\nthat include abusive punitive sanctions.  \r\n We would like to avail ourselves of this \r\nopportunity to reiterate our firm position that the \r\nSecurity Council should be enlarged in both categories \r\nof membership, permanent and non-permanent, with \r\nmore representation for developing countries. \r\n It is our strong conviction that the sixty-fourth \r\nsession of the General Assembly is a crucial time. Now \r\nis the time for Member States to act together, in a spirit \r\nof partnership, compromise and flexibility, to bring our \r\nefforts to reform the Security Council to a fruitful \r\noutcome.  \r\n Against that backdrop, we welcome the \r\nPresident’s initiative to designate the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council as one of the main priorities of this \r\nsession. We very much appreciate his commitment to \r\nsparing no effort to make the reform process \r\nachievable as soon as possible. We would also like to \r\ncongratulate Ambassador Zahir Tanin for his continued \r\nefforts with regard to the task entrusted to him as chair \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations. We wish to \r\nassure him of our full support. \r\n Finally, I would like to express my deep gratitude \r\nfor the support and encouragement we have received \r\nfrom a number of Member States regarding our \r\ninitiative to consult them in the preparation of last \r\nyear’s annual report of the Security Council. \r\n Ms. Ochir (Mongolia): My delegation wishes to \r\nconfine its remarks to agenda item 119, on the question \r\nof equitable representation on and increase in the \r\nmembership of the Security Council and related \r\nmatters. \r\n Since the adoption of the historic decision \r\n62/557, three rounds of intergovernmental negotiations \r\nhave taken place in the Assembly’s informal plenary \r\nmeeting format under the skilful stewardship of \r\nAmbassador Zahir Tanin. We have had an opportunity \r\nto hear Member States reiterate their principled \r\npositions, as well as some new proposals, on the five \r\nkey issues of a comprehensive reform of the Security \r\nCouncil. As we are now approaching a new round of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations during the current \r\nAssembly session, my delegation wishes to strongly \r\necho the position expressed by many previous speakers \r\nthat, in order to move the process forward, the Chair \r\nneeds to produce a composite text on the positions of \r\nMember States so that we can engage in genuine \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Council reform. \r\n Mongolia’s stance on the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil is well known. We have consistently stood for \r\na just and equitable enlargement of the Council by \r\nincreasing the number of both permanent and \r\nnon-permanent members while ensuring due \r\nrepresentation for developing and developed countries. \r\nOur position on enlargement in both categories is \r\nguided by, and based on, a legislative and Charter-\r\ndefined composition, political considerations that \r\nreflect the change in the balance of power, and the \r\nprinciples of justice and equality to ensure greater and \r\nenhanced representation for developing world. \r\n My delegation shares the view of the majority of \r\nMember States that the veto right is anachronistic and \r\nneeds to be reviewed and limited, with the ultimate \r\nobjective being its abolition. However, as long as it \r\nexists, it must be extended to new permanent members \r\nso as not to create a new category of Council \r\nmembership. We also support the clearly expressed \r\nposition of aspirants regarding the establishment of a \r\nvoluntary moratorium on the use of the veto until the \r\nproposed review process takes place. \r\n On the issue of regional representation, the \r\nsolution ought to be fair and just. We attach great \r\nimportance to the criterion of equitable geographical \r\ndistribution, with an emphasis on non- and under-\r\nrepresented groups, in particular those of Africa, Asia \r\nand Latin American and Caribbean. My delegation also \r\nattaches particular importance to ensuring the \r\nrepresentation of small States in the Security Council. \r\n Based on its position with regard to categories \r\nand regional representation, my delegation would prefer \r\nan enlarged Council to comprise 24 or 25 members, \r\nwith 6 new permanent members and 4 or 5 additional \r\nnon-permanent members. \r\n We strongly believe that in order to make the \r\nnecessary breakthrough in our negotiations, we need \r\nprimarily to decide on the categories of Security \r\nCouncil enlargement. We share the view that the \r\noverwhelming majority of Member States have \r\nexpressed, in no uncertain terms, regarding their \r\npreference for increasing the membership in both the \r\ncurrent categories. We expect that the composite text of \r\nthe chair that has been proposed will reflect that \r\nreality. \r\nA/64/PV.44  \r\n \r\n09-60619 18 \r\n \r\n Finally, I would like to welcome the President’s \r\ndecision to make Security Council reform one of his \r\npriorities and to express my delegation’s sincere hope \r\nthat with his strong leadership, this session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly will make meaningful progress \r\ntowards early reform of the Council, as all of us were \r\nmandated to do by world leaders at 2005 World \r\nSummit. \r\n Mr. Laggner (Switzerland) (spoke in French): \r\nWe would like to thank the Security Council for its \r\nannual report (A/64/2), and we welcome its \r\npresentation to the General Assembly. The report is an \r\nimportant element in the relationship between the \r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly, and it \r\nprovides the basis for an institutionalized dialogue \r\nbetween those two organs. We also welcome the \r\ninformal exchange afforded to non-members of the \r\nSecurity Council by the delegations of Uganda, Viet \r\nNam and Austria and, as has already been mentioned, \r\nthe constructive and valuable discussion between \r\nCouncil members and the group of five small States \r\n(S-5). Having said all that, we regret that, as in \r\nprevious years, the report falls short of our \r\nexpectations in terms of both substance and procedural \r\naspects. \r\n With regard to substance, we are still waiting for \r\na report that is more analytical and therefore more \r\npertinent for the whole membership. We are aware of \r\nthe difficulties involved in producing a report that goes \r\nbeyond a simple listing of the Council’s activities and \r\nmeetings. Nevertheless, we believe that improvement \r\nis possible. For example, the report fails to emphasize \r\nthe linkages between thematic, regional and country-\r\nspecific issues. The summaries of debates included in \r\nthe report are often incomplete and do not accurately \r\nreflect the discussions in the Council. In particular, \r\nthere is no analysis of the challenges that the Council \r\nfaces, of its assessments and of the rationale for its \r\ndecisions during the reporting period. \r\n One way to improve the substantive content of \r\nthe report would be to include analytical summaries \r\nfrom the 12 presidencies. Another option could be to \r\nintroduce the optimal practical approach — the lessons \r\nlearned — with regard to specific issues on the \r\nCouncil’s agenda, as has been repeatedly called for by \r\nthe S-5. In that context, Switzerland has commissioned \r\na short paper analyzing the United Nations Mission in \r\nEthiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) as a case study of the \r\nCouncil’s interaction with a peacekeeping operation. \r\nWe shall be pleased to make that study available once \r\nit is completed. \r\n With regard to procedural matters, there is a need \r\nto involve the general membership in a more \r\ninteractive way, and at an earlier stage, during the \r\nprocess of drafting the Council’s annual report. \r\nInformal meetings have been held to provide \r\nnon-members of the Council an opportunity to express \r\ntheir views. That should be done in a more systematic \r\nmanner, and well before the finalization of the report. \r\nAnother option to be considered would be the holding \r\nof an open debate in the Council at an early stage in the \r\ndrafting process. \r\n Why do we need more analysis and transparency? \r\nMany Member States are major contributors of troops \r\nor financing. All Member States have the obligation to \r\nimplement coercive measures. Implementing such \r\nmeasures without participation in the decision-making \r\nprocess requires, at least, access to transparent \r\ninformation. We owe that to our citizens and to our \r\nnational legislatures, for we have to explain to them \r\nhow tax-payers’ money is being spent. \r\n With the beginning of intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform under an \r\ninformal General Assembly plenary meeting format, \r\nwe have now reached a new stage in the consideration \r\nof this issue. Our assessment, however, is rather sober. \r\nAlthough we have a new format for the discussions, we \r\nhave not yet made substantive progress. Positions on \r\nenlargement remain, to a large degree, entrenched. \r\nSwitzerland is convinced that the intermediate model \r\ncontinues to be the only realistic option for breaking \r\nthe deadlock. Such an approach does not prejudge the \r\nfinal outcome of the reform effort, but it does allow us \r\nto take one step forward. In our view, it is therefore \r\nhigh time to start a serious discussion of the concrete \r\nparameters of that model. If we are not capable of more \r\nflexibility, we will remain stuck in the current \r\ndeadlock. \r\n Together with its partners in the group of five \r\nsmall countries, Switzerland will continue to focus as a \r\nmatter of priority on the issue of reforming the working \r\nmethods of the Security Council. Improving working \r\nmethods will have to take place, whatever the scenario \r\nand whether or not we can agree on an expansion of \r\nthe Council. We have repeatedly highlighted that point \r\nhere, as well as in direct discussions with the members \r\nof the Security Council. \r\n A/64/PV.44\r\n \r\n19 09-60619 \r\n \r\n In that regard, we very much appreciated the \r\ninvitation by the Japanese Chair of the Council’s \r\nInformal Working Group on Documentation and Other \r\nProcedural Questions to a very substantive and frank \r\nexchange of views with Council members in July. We \r\nwould welcome an early follow-up in that regard. \r\n Our ideas for improving working methods are \r\ncontained in the group of five’s concept paper, which \r\nwas circulated in April. Those ideas focus on \r\ntransparency and access, efficiency and \r\nimplementation, the rule of law, the use of the veto, \r\npeacekeeping operations and accountability and \r\nrelations with the General Assembly. We hope that the \r\npaper will serve as an inspiration for changes in the \r\nCouncil’s practices and that it will contribute to a \r\ncomprehensive resolution on Security Council reform. \r\n The best way to develop working methods is to \r\nassess what has worked in the past and why decisions \r\nof the Council are often insufficiently implemented. I \r\nhave already mentioned the study we have \r\ncommissioned on the Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea. \r\nWe are also supporting a project that is monitoring how \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1325 (2005) is being \r\nincorporated into the Council’s overall work. \r\n I would like to conclude by underscoring that \r\nfurther improvements in the Council’s working \r\nmethods are in the interest of Council and non-Council \r\nmembers alike. Not only would they ensure more \r\ntransparency and better involvement by all Member \r\nStates in the Council’s work, they would also serve the \r\nCouncil’s interest by conferring greater authority upon \r\nits decisions, thereby contributing to strengthening the \r\nrelationship between the Security Council and the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n Mr. Balé (Congo) (spoke in French): At the \r\noutset, my delegation would like to associate itself \r\nwith the statements delivered this morning by the \r\nPermanent Representatives of Sierra Leone and Egypt, \r\nrespectively, on behalf of the African Group and the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement. I should also like to say that \r\ntoday’s debate on the Security Council, and \r\nspecifically the consideration of the report of that \r\nimportant organ (A/64/2) and of the issue of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of \r\nthe Council and related matters, is of the greatest \r\ninterest to my country. \r\n My delegation commends the Open-ended \r\nWorking Group on the Question of Equitable \r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of \r\nthe Security Council and Other Matters Related to the \r\nSecurity Council for submitting its report (A/63/47). \r\nAs a result of its considerable work, the Group has \r\nprovided a basis for the intergovernmental negotiating \r\nprocess. \r\n My delegation takes note of the report of the \r\nSecurity Council. We would like to express our \r\ngratitude for the efforts made by that organ to maintain \r\ninternational peace and security. The General \r\nAssembly’s consideration of the report is aimed at \r\nresponding to the crucial need for an accountable \r\nSecurity Council imbued with a sense of responsibility \r\nto the General Assembly, where the entire membership \r\nis represented. \r\n The report provides great detail about events, \r\nthus giving us a full accounting of the multiplicity and \r\ndiverse nature of issues under its consideration during \r\nthe 12-month period from 1 August 2008 to 31 July \r\n2009. Nevertheless, it must be pointed out that the \r\nreport’s solely factual approach limits the depth of our \r\nunderstanding of the challenges facing the Council as it \r\ncarries out the mandate conferred upon it by the \r\nCharter. In addition, it seems clear that the Council \r\nshould further improve its early-warning capacity and \r\nfocus on preventive diplomacy, rather than finding \r\nitself forced to react to events after the fact.  \r\n The President did well to focus his presidency on \r\nthe issues of justice, peace and security, which includes \r\nmaking the reform of the United Nations system one of \r\nhis priorities, especially that of the Security Council. It \r\nis also worth mentioning that Security Council reform \r\nis at the heart of the overall reform of the United \r\nNations. It is the keystone of that effort.  \r\n Three days ago, celebrations were held in \r\nGermany to commemorate the fall of the Berlin Wall \r\non 9 November 1989, the so-called wall of shame. That \r\nunforgettable day ushered in a new order in Europe. \r\nPeople sang songs of freedom, welcomed the advent of \r\ndemocracy and decreed the end of the cold war. New \r\nStates emerged from that new order, which would later \r\nadd to the universality of the United Nations when they \r\njoined the Organization. In doing so, they followed in \r\nthe footsteps of many African countries, three decades \r\nearlier, when they too brought down another wall of \r\nshame. From the ashes of the chaos of war emerged a \r\nnew world in which justice, peace and security for all \r\nwas to supposed to prevail. That brought us closer than \r\nA/64/PV.44  \r\n \r\n09-60619 20 \r\n \r\never to the aspirations of men and women who, having \r\nregained their humanity, broke down another wall of \r\nshame. A new order had emerged from the chaos, and \r\nthat is how our Organization was founded. From its \r\nvery beginning it announced a dream that has now \r\ncome true, a universal Organization. Today almost all \r\nStates of the world are Members of it. \r\n Those historic high points in the life of our \r\nOrganization should rightly remind us that we do not \r\nlive in a petrified world. The Security Council cannot \r\nshoulder its responsibilities without recognizing this \r\ndynamic, reinforced as it is by the emergence of new \r\nforces onto the international political scene and whose \r\nrightful place there cannot forever be denied. The \r\ndecision of our leaders at the 2005 World Summit — \r\nthat the Security Council must be reformed without \r\ndelay because it constituted the essential element in \r\nmodernizing the United Nations — reflected this \r\nwillingness to take our Organization in this direction. \r\n The United Nations, which we wish to see as a \r\nliving organism, has been asked to evolve, and in order \r\nto do that it must adopt a position of transparency, \r\njustice and genuine democracy, based on the equal \r\nsovereignty of States, because otherwise it will be \r\ndoomed to a tragic fate of sclerosis and paralysis. \r\n Thus the Security Council, whose reform is the \r\nfocus of our debate, must face up to the tragic flaw that \r\nnow characterizes it. We realize that hope for genuine \r\nreform collides with national interests and schism in \r\nsome positions, as we have seen throughout the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations that began on \r\n19 February. We believe that we should not seek a \r\nmere makeshift, transitional and interim solution; \r\ninstead, we must move towards genuine reform of this \r\norgan in every way and every area. Member States \r\nmust, in fact, be possessed of a genuine political will to \r\nbring about genuine reform of the Security Council, \r\nmaking it more democratic and representative, and \r\nbeyond that, increasing its transparency, effectiveness \r\nand accountability to the Member States. \r\n My delegation does not despair of the possibility \r\nof having a Security Council where all members are on \r\nan equal footing. But discussion of the issue of the veto \r\nhas shown that doing away with that discriminatory, \r\nanachronistic power, bestowed on the permanent \r\nmembers, is the keystone of the entire edifice of \r\nreform. It is on the basis of that reality that Africa, the \r\nonly region without any permanent seat in this body, is \r\nquite rightly asking for two permanent seats. In this \r\nway justice should be done, and Africa’s legitimate \r\naspirations met with this category of membership. \r\n The areas of the negotiations on the questions of \r\nenlarging the category of members, equitable regional \r\nrepresentation, relations between the General Assembly \r\nand the Council, the working methods of the \r\nCouncil — all of these give us grounds for believing \r\nthat consensus on them is possible. After that, all that \r\nwould remain would be for us to devote ourselves to \r\narriving at an agreement on those questions as quickly \r\nas possible. \r\n In conclusion, my delegation would like to recall \r\nthe fact that decision 62/557 remains the main \r\nreference document for conducting the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. We also hope that today’s debate will \r\nusher in a new day shedding new light on the next \r\nrounds of negotiations, giving them a new impetus, so \r\nthat real progress can be made towards genuine reform \r\nof this body, the pivot of the United Nations, which \r\nwill, eventually, become a Security Council that \r\nreflects our era. \r\n Mr. Jomaa (Tunisia) (spoke in French): May I \r\nfirst of all thank the President very much for including \r\nthe item on reform of the Security Council as one of \r\nhis top priorities. I assure him of my delegation’s firm \r\nsupport for any action you may take in order to bring \r\nthis process to completion at this session under his \r\npresidency. \r\n While we support the statement made on behalf \r\nof the African Group and the Non-Aligned Movement, \r\nI would also like to express our views on the two items \r\non today’s agenda, the report of the Security Council to \r\nthe General Assembly (A/64/2) and the “Question of \r\nequitable representation on and increase in the \r\nmembership of the Security Council and related \r\nmatters”, by making the following comments: \r\n First, concerning the annual report of the Security \r\nCouncil, I would like to thank the Ambassador of \r\nAustria, President of the Council for the current month, \r\nfor introducing the Council’s annual report to the \r\nGeneral Assembly in accordance with the provisions of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. For most Member \r\nStates, particularly those that are not members of the \r\nSecurity Council, the Assembly’s consideration of the \r\nCouncil’s annual report is the only opportunity they \r\nhave for evaluating the work of the Council in depth \r\n A/64/PV.44\r\n \r\n21 09-60619 \r\n \r\nand identifying what must be done to improve its \r\nworking methods. \r\n This year, once again, the report of the Security \r\nCouncil is a compendium of decisions and resolutions \r\nadopted and a somewhat factual account of that body’s \r\nwork. We are thus still far from the recommendations \r\nmade by the Member States, which have asked for an \r\nanalytical annual report. In the same spirit, I would \r\nalso recall that the General Assembly had suggested to \r\nthe Council that it periodically submit special thematic \r\nreports on issues of international interest. So far, no \r\nsuch reports have been submitted. \r\n As to how the Council operates, over the past \r\nyear it has held a significant number of thematic \r\ndebates in which a larger number of States have \r\nparticipated. In this regard, however, it would still be \r\nuseful to strengthen the regular consultation mechanisms \r\nbetween the presidencies of the various United Nations \r\nbodies, in order to avoid any overlapping or \r\nencroachment on the respective competences of those \r\norgans when such thematic debates are held. \r\n We acknowledge the considerable amount of \r\nwork accomplished by the Security Council during the \r\nperiod covered by the report and particularly regarding \r\nhotbeds of tension in Africa and other parts of the \r\nworld. We also take note of visits to the field by \r\nCouncil members in order to better grasp the situations \r\naffecting international peace and security and requiring \r\nurgent action by the Council. The report shows that the \r\nCouncil has made determined efforts to tackle a large \r\nnumber of conflicts around the world. This naturally \r\nenhances its authority and role in maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security. \r\n I would, however, point out that the Council’s \r\nefforts are far below what we hoped for in the Middle \r\nEast. Frustration over the Council’s inability to become \r\nmore involved in settling the Palestinian question and \r\nin shouldering its responsibilities in this area poses a \r\nserious threat to the region and to the authority of the \r\nCouncil itself. We believe strongly that there is still \r\nmuch to be done to get the Council to function in a \r\nmore transparent manner, ensure access to information \r\nfor all delegations, particularly those with items on the \r\nCouncil’s agenda. \r\n Secondly, may I turn to the question of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of \r\nthe Security Council. In dealing with this issue, allow \r\nme first to pay tribute to the President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-third session, for his contribution \r\nto the matter before us today. We also note the \r\nlaunching of intergovernmental negotiations based on \r\nproposals by Member States on the question of the \r\nequitable representation on and increase in the \r\nmembership of the Security Council. These were begun \r\nin an open, inclusive and transparent manner in order \r\nto arrive at a solution that would garner the widest \r\npossible support among Member States. \r\n I would like to warmly thank Ambassador Zahir \r\nTanin for the manner in which he has conducted the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, and I assure him of our \r\nfull cooperation in that process. Pending the \r\nresumption of the negotiations, I would like to offer the \r\nfollowing comments.  \r\n The Security Council should reflect the political \r\nand economic realities of the world of today. It should \r\nhave the legitimacy it needs to act on behalf of the \r\ninternational community in discharging the mandate \r\nassigned it by the Charter. My delegation believes that \r\nthe purpose of any reform of the Council should be to \r\nstrengthen equitable representation within that organ, \r\nits credibility and its effectiveness. Those goals are \r\nattainable only if the Council is enlarged, particularly \r\nto include developing countries. Likewise, the size of a \r\nrestructured Council should reflect all the sensibilities \r\nof the international community. \r\n In that context, Tunisia still strongly supports the \r\nposition of the African Union, as reflected in the \r\nAfrican consensus on the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil. We believe it is time to rectify the fact Africa \r\nhas never had any permanent presence in the Council. \r\nWe will support any formula that gives developing \r\ncountries in general and Africa in particular their \r\nrightful place in the Council. \r\n We think that the Security Council, if it is to \r\ncontinue enjoying the trust of States and world public \r\nopinion, must show that it is able to effectively tackle \r\nthe most difficult issues, and it must also become more \r\nrepresentative of the international community as a \r\nwhole and reflect the realities of the world today.  \r\n Mr. Dos Santos (Paraguay) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nAllow me to begin by extending the thanks of the \r\ndelegation of Paraguay to Ambassador Thomas Mayr-\r\nHarting, Permanent Representative of Austria, for his \r\nintroduction of the annual report of the Security \r\nCouncil (A/64/2) in his capacity as the President of the \r\nSecurity Council. We commend the Council’s goodwill \r\nA/64/PV.44  \r\n \r\n09-60619 22 \r\n \r\nin intending to present a report that responds to the \r\ndemands of the great majority of the Members of our \r\nOrganization, making it a useful and substantive \r\ndocument that benefits us all. \r\n On the subject of agenda item 119, I would like \r\nto take this opportunity to congratulate Father Miguel \r\nd’Escoto Brockmann, President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-third session, for his work in \r\nconnection with the question of equitable representation \r\non and increase in the membership of the Security \r\nCouncil and related matters. Our thanks also go to \r\nAmbassador Zahir Tanin, Permanent Representative of \r\nAfghanistan, for his excellent work in overseeing the \r\nmeetings.  \r\n The Government of Paraguay is of the view that \r\nthe reform the Security Council is an essential element \r\nin strengthening the Organization. For this reason, we \r\nsupport prompt reform and pledge our efforts and \r\ncooperation to fulfil the mandate of the 2005 World \r\nSummit.  \r\n In establishing, in resolution 48/26, an open-\r\nended working group to consider the aspects of the \r\nquestion of increasing the membership of the Security \r\nCouncil and other, related matters and then in adopting \r\ndecision 62/557, the Member States took an important \r\nstep that committed them to continuing their \r\nendeavours to achieve a Council that is more equitable, \r\nmore democratic and more fully consistent with current \r\ninternational realities.  \r\n The Republic of Paraguay reaffirms its \r\nunshakable commitment to multilateralism, which is \r\nbased on the purposes and principles enshrined in the \r\nCharter. We know that concentration saps the collective \r\neffort that all members of the Organization are \r\ncommitted to. That is why we continue to believe that \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security \r\nshould be founded on collective well-being and not on \r\nindividual and transitory interests. We also cannot \r\nbelieve that international security is divorced from the \r\nissues of development and respect for human rights. \r\nWe declare those issues to be interdependent, and it is \r\non their positive interaction that the harmonious \r\ncoexistence and material and cultural progress of our \r\npeoples will depend.  \r\n We are following with interest the negotiation \r\nprocess for the expansion of the Security Council. We \r\nbelieve expansion should be accompanied by reform of \r\nthe Council’s working methods and that the Council \r\nshould have permanent rules of procedure instead of \r\nthe provisional rules that it has had since its creation. \r\nThe legitimacy of the Council’s decisions will be a \r\nfunction of the degree of its democracy, \r\nrepresentativeness and participatory nature.  \r\n Paraguay reiterates, as is stated in the Charter, \r\nthat that the primary function of the Council is the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. We \r\nalso wish to express concern regarding the growing \r\nextension of the competencies of the Security Council \r\nto other topics that have their own natural forums and \r\nthat may in some way undermine the authority of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and of other bodies in the \r\nOrganization.  \r\n The increase in the number of members of the \r\nSecurity Council should be consistent with the \r\ngeographical and equitable distribution among its \r\nmembers, primarily the sovereign equality of States, as \r\nlaid out on Article 23 of the Charter. \r\n With regard to the veto, Paraguay supports its \r\ngradual elimination and the gradual restriction of its \r\napplication to Chapter VII.  \r\n We believe that there must be effective \r\ncommunication between the Security Council and the \r\nGeneral Assembly. The Assembly is the most \r\nrepresentative and democratic body of the United \r\nNations system. We therefore believe that is necessary \r\nto fully carry out meetings between the President of the \r\nAssembly and the President of the Council. We must \r\nachieve a democratic and transparent body. \r\n We would like to see the Council, of which we \r\nhave been a member only in 1967 and 1968, become \r\nmore representative, inclusive and democratic. We are \r\nconfident that the Council will adapt to the new needs \r\nof our century and to the current number of Member \r\nStates in order to ensure that it is more representative, \r\nefficient and legitimate and that its decisions are \r\nimplemented.  \r\n Mr. Nhleko (Swaziland): At the outset, my \r\ndelegation aligns itself with the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of Sierra Leone, as Chair of the \r\nCommittee of Ten, on behalf of the African Group and \r\nthe statement by the representative of Egypt on behalf \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement (see A/64/PV.43). \r\n I have the honour to address the plenary of the \r\nGeneral Assembly on agenda item 119, “Question of \r\nthe equitable representation on and increase in the \r\n A/64/PV.44\r\n \r\n23 09-60619 \r\n \r\nmembership of the Security Council and related \r\nmatters”, and to reflect on the report of the Chairperson \r\nof the Working Group as contained in document \r\nA/63/47.  \r\n I thank the Chairperson for his report. My \r\ndelegation appreciates the activism of Member States \r\nin the intergovernmental negotiations throughout the \r\nsixty-third session. The informal discussions under the \r\nstewardship of His Excellency Ambassador Tanin of \r\nAfghanistan have been thought-provoking and \r\nforthright. I also thank Ambassador Tanin for his \r\nrelentlessness and vision in guiding the proceedings \r\nwith the utmost dedication and impartiality. \r\n The negotiations on Security Council reform have \r\nalready taken 15 years, and the Open-ended Working \r\nGroup established at the very beginning has convened \r\nmeeting after meeting with few textual results. That \r\nindicates a laggard commitment to the progress that \r\nour people yearn to see. Whether or not that has been \r\nby design or default remains to be seen. It is \r\ndiscernible to many that the events and actions \r\nfollowing 1945 were compatible with and necessary for \r\nthat era. Today, as the world has evolved, the demands \r\nand realities of the modern-day United Nations, \r\nrepresenting a holistic citizenry, need to be taken into \r\naccount. The persistent calls for the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council are therefore not misplaced. My \r\ndelegation has a duty to add its voice to this call, with \r\nunfailing resolve. \r\n The plight of Africa does not need to be repeated. \r\nAs the only continent without a seat in the permanent \r\ncategory, the frustration felt from the Cape to Cairo is \r\nwell founded. What is more, a substantial part of the \r\nCouncil’s agenda is focused on Africa. The Kingdom \r\nof Swaziland is convinced that Africa has valuable \r\ninsight into the peace and security landscape of the \r\ncontinent. The ad hoc approach taken to engaging with \r\nAfrica on its own problems is like allowing the tail to \r\nwag the dog. It is not an issue of control, but of factual \r\ndiscourse, and employing cooperative efforts based on \r\nan informed point of view would considerably improve \r\nthe outputs that we seek to accomplish. \r\n The Ezulwini Consensus is succinct in its call for \r\nat least two permanent seats for Africa. Whether or not \r\nthey come with the veto power is a point for further \r\nreflection, depending on the willingness or \r\nunwillingness of negotiating partners to yield on the \r\nveto. The Kingdom of Swaziland therefore advocates \r\nthe curtailment of the veto, irrespective of whether it is \r\nextended to new members. \r\n My delegation laments the direction that the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations are taking. The chair of \r\nthe negotiations, Ambassador Tanin, stressed the need \r\nfor flexibility from all parties. Regrettably, as we \r\nconvene today there is no indication of a possible \r\ntrade-off. Even though there is a near convergence of \r\nviews among some parties in the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on issues that touch on working methods \r\nand the relationship between the General Assembly and \r\nthe Security Council, there is no initiative and \r\nmethodology to synchronize those views and work on a \r\nconcrete trade-off that will quickly move the process to \r\na more advanced level.  \r\n My delegation does not see those matters as \r\nproblem areas, considering the gravity of other \r\nnegotiating points such as the categories of \r\nmembership. As a matter of principle, my delegation is \r\nnot trying to give certain clusters preferred \r\nconsideration ahead of others, but rather to underscore \r\nthe importance of working expeditiously and moving \r\nswiftly. It does not serve the interests of Africa to \r\nprocrastinate. \r\n During the latter stage of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, the intermediary approach arose as a \r\npreferred option with respect to categories of \r\nmembership. My delegation rejected it, as we would \r\nagain even today. We also militated against its undue \r\nadvancement by the chair of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations for the simple reason that it does not a \r\nreflect what the entire membership wants the \r\nnegotiations to narrow down to. That is beside the \r\npoint that it prejudices the well-known position of \r\nAfrica, a 53-member collective. \r\n It is our hope that all positions will be given \r\ncomplete scrutiny on a case-by-case basis. My \r\ndelegation has always supported the piecemeal \r\napproach that was first advanced by the delegation of \r\nZambia. However, the intermediary approach has been \r\ngenerally rejected, not because it cannot be viable but \r\nonly because of its unknown content. It has developed \r\na negative complex whereby delegations, including \r\nmine, view it as a tool to bamboozle the membership \r\nand derail discussion of real reform. That is \r\ncompounded by the broad unwillingness to explain the \r\napproach further. It is well known that the fragmented \r\nnature of the intermediary approach is a sticky area \r\nA/64/PV.44  \r\n \r\n09-60619 24 \r\n \r\nthat makes us grow even more apprehensive. My \r\ndelegation does not want to dwell on an approach that \r\nseeks to perpetuate the very injustice we all desire to \r\nsubdue. \r\n The issue of regional representation has caused \r\nmany delegations to make assertions on unfounded \r\nformulations. Some feel it unjustly advances the notion \r\nof a collective or regional seat and consequently \r\nviolates the Charter of the United Nations. As regional \r\nrepresentation is pivotally essential to the African \r\nposition, we want to remind delegations about the \r\nessence of reform. Reform entails amendment and \r\ncreation. What is being amended and created is an \r\nissue of discussion among Members. We wish to make \r\nit clear that Africa does not want a regional seat. On \r\nthe contrary, a seat is purely national and sovereign, \r\nbut the only difference is that Africa would have the \r\nsay in the determination to elect the nation to occupy \r\nsuch a seat. How that seat is used to effectively solve \r\npertinent problems that affect Africa and the rest of the \r\nworld is an African affair. The understanding that \r\nAfrica wants to rule en masse in the Security Council \r\nis misguided and should be discouraged. \r\n We encourage other African delegations to make \r\nefforts to explain what regional representation means \r\nfor Africa in order to paint an accurate picture. \r\nNaysayers will have little or no option to disparage an \r\nhonestly motivated position that responds to the core of \r\nmany injustices created by the course of history. My \r\ndelegation is perturbed by the consistent misjudgement \r\nby the very partners who are instrumental in the \r\nprogress of the negotiation process. We want a process \r\nwhereby a pound of flesh must be given where and \r\nwhen it is due, without further impediment. I should \r\nlike to appeal to the membership to carry the process \r\nforward and negotiate robustly so that we can have \r\nclosure on this issue.  \r\n Institutions constantly undergo changes; they are \r\nconstructed and reconstructed, with adaptation \r\nstrategies modelled on the changing times, geopolitical \r\nrealities and changes in the mindsets that govern the \r\nworld. Those multifarious approaches to governance \r\ndemand a newly imagined international discourse that \r\ntakes into account the assortment of ideas that can offer \r\nalternatives to static ascendancy. It is high time that \r\nthat value be learned. We are no longer in the world of \r\nthe Middle Ages. The Kingdom of Swaziland wishes to \r\nencourage the Assembly President to follow in the \r\nfootsteps of his predecessor and pursue this matter with \r\nvigour. \r\n Mrs. Waffa-Ogoo (Gambia): The Gambia aligns \r\nitself with the statements made by His Excellency \r\nMr. Shekou M. Touray, Permanent Representative of \r\nSierra Leone and Coordinator of the Committee of Ten, \r\nand by His Excellency Mr. Maged A. Abdelaziz, \r\nPermanent Representative of Egypt, on behalf of the \r\nAfrican Group and the Non-Aligned Movement, \r\nrespectively. My delegation welcomes the opportunity \r\nto take part in this joint debate on agenda item 9, \r\n“Report of the Security Council”, and agenda item 119, \r\n“Question of equitable representation on and increase \r\nin the membership of the Security Council and related \r\nmatters”.  \r\n It is no secret that the Council has had many \r\nregional situations on its agenda, the bulk of which \r\nrelate to Africa. We have also witnessed greater \r\nengagement of the United Nations Security Council \r\nand the African Union (AU), especially in the \r\nexpeditious implementation of the United Nations-AU \r\nten-year capacity-building programme. We would like \r\nto see more meaningful cooperation between the \r\nSecurity Council and the African Union Peace and \r\nSecurity Council, as they both grapple with finding \r\nlasting solutions to conflicts in Africa. African efforts \r\nin the maintenance of international peace and security \r\nought to be supported, especially in those situations \r\nwhere individual African countries have already \r\ncontributed to such efforts or are willing to do so. \r\n My delegation is aware of the fact that the \r\nsituation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian \r\nquestion, is a perennial item on the agenda of the \r\nCouncil. We appreciate the attention that this item \r\nreceives from Council members every month. What is \r\nworrying, however, is that despite all the attention \r\ngiven to that item over many decades, the conflict in \r\nthe Middle East continues to defy solution. For the \r\nPalestinians, the unending settlement activity by Israel \r\nand the attendant land grabbing through fencing \r\nconstitutes the greatest threat to the viability of a two-\r\nState solution. What is equally worrying is the \r\nCouncil’s failure to insist on respect for its numerous \r\nresolutions on the situation. We urge the Council, \r\ntherefore, to see to the implementation of its \r\nlongstanding resolutions on the Palestinian question. \r\n In the protracted debate on the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council, among the issues that enjoy general \r\n A/64/PV.44\r\n \r\n25 09-60619 \r\n \r\nagreement among most Member States are the relations \r\nbetween the Security Council and the General \r\nAssembly and the improvement of the Council’s \r\nworking methods. There are, however, a few among us \r\nwho subscribe to the school of thought that reforming \r\nthe Council’s working methods is best left to the \r\nCouncil itself. \r\n The whole question of improvement of the \r\nworking methods of the Council is tied in with the \r\nbroader question of Security Council reform. In \r\naddition to the plethora of proposals advanced so far in \r\nthat regard, the Council itself should continue to \r\nengage in further introspection, with a view to finding \r\nmore innovative ways to engage the larger membership \r\nof the United Nations. Apart from making the \r\nCouncil’s decision-making process more transparent, it \r\nwould also enhance the legitimacy of its decisions. \r\n In the continuum of reforms to be undertaken by \r\nthe United Nations, that of the Security Council still \r\nremains elusive. In Africa, our position on agenda item \r\n119 on equitable representation on and increase in the \r\nmembership of the Security Council and related \r\nmatters, is well known. In fact, before the Ezulwini \r\nConsensus and Sirte Declaration, the 1997 Harare \r\nDeclaration on the reform of the Security Council \r\nflagged, among other issues, the need to periodically \r\nreview the structure and functioning of the Security \r\nCouncil in order to make it more responsive to the \r\nchallenges of a dynamic international community, \r\nparticularly in the domain of peace and security.  \r\n However, we continue to find the delay in \r\nreaching a final solution untenable. My delegation \r\nwould like to see a resumption of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations in the informal plenary \r\nof the General Assembly leading to intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations based on concrete proposals without \r\nundue delay. It is our hope that the issues discussed in \r\nthe last round of negotiations will be tackled in such a \r\nway as to lead to the adoption of a satisfactory decision \r\nduring this session. \r\n Let me conclude by extending my delegation’s \r\ngratitude to the President at the sixty-third session, His \r\nExcellency Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann, for the report \r\nof the Open-ended Working Group on the Question of \r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the \r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters \r\nrelated to the Security Council, in document A/63/47, \r\npursuant to resolution 62/557.  \r\n We also commend the President of the current \r\nsession, His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, for \r\nmaking reform of the Security Council one of the \r\npriorities of his presidency. As we look forward to the \r\nresumption of the intergovernmental negotiations, my \r\ndelegation wishes to pledge its continued cooperation \r\nand support to Ambassador Tanin of Afghanistan, who \r\nhas once again graciously agreed to chair the \r\nnegotiations on behalf of the President of the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Mr. AlSanad (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): On \r\nbehalf of my country’s delegation, I wish to convey our \r\nthanks and appreciation to the President of the Security \r\nCouncil for this month, His Excellency Mr. Thomas \r\nMayr-Harting, Permanent Representative of Austria, \r\nfor presenting the Council’s report to the General \r\nAssembly. We thank him for the report and take note of \r\nits assertion that the previous year has witnessed \r\nsignificant activity in terms of the volume of the \r\nCouncil’s work. \r\n We support the statement of the representative of \r\nEgypt on behalf of the countries of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement. We also congratulate the newly elected \r\nnon-permanent members of the Council for the period \r\n2010-2011: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Gabon, \r\nLebanon and Nigeria. \r\n The agenda item on the question of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of \r\nthe Security Council and related matters is considered \r\none of the most important items on the agenda of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. However, the question of the reform \r\nof the Security Council is stuck in its tracks, despite \r\nthe fact that more than 15 years have elapsed since the \r\nGeneral Assembly adopted a resolution establishing an \r\nopen-ended working group to consider the issue of \r\nequitable representation on and increase in the \r\nCouncil’s membership. Despite the agreement of \r\nMember States on the basis for effecting change and \r\nreform, the Working Group has not, however, been able \r\nto reach an agreement until now, on the substance of \r\nthe required change. \r\n However, we cannot ignore the fact that progress \r\nhas been made in the negotiations of the Working \r\nGroup, particularly concerning the working methods of \r\nthe Council. Now, there is almost a general consensus \r\non many of the measures and proposals to be \r\nintroduced. We cannot but commend this improvement. \r\nIn this regard, we welcome the overall agreement to \r\nA/64/PV.44  \r\n \r\n09-60619 26 \r\n \r\ncommence intergovernmental negotiations in an \r\ninformal plenary meeting of the General Assembly \r\nduring the sixty-third session and this current session, \r\nwith the aim of realizing many of the ideas that have \r\nbeen the subject of numerous discussions over the \r\nyears. We congratulate Ambassador Zahir Tanin, the \r\nPermanent Representative of Afghanistan, for presiding \r\nover the informal consultations during the sixty-third \r\nand sixty-fourth sessions of the General Assembly. We \r\nhope that consensus can be reached in order to \r\nstrengthen the role of the Security Council and its \r\neffectiveness. We also convey our thanks to the Italian \r\nGovernment for hosting the special ministerial meeting \r\nto consider the matter of the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil last February in Rome. The meeting laid out \r\nbroad outlines, which led to the convening of the third \r\nround of informal intergovernmental consultations, \r\nwhich lasted from 1 to 3 September 2009, at United \r\nNations Headquarters in New York. \r\n There is no doubt that an agreement on any of the \r\nissues related to the matter of expanding and reforming \r\nthe Security Council — whether that agreement comes \r\nduring the phase of consultations or negotiations \r\nbetween Governments — must be a general agreement \r\nthat ensures real reform of the Council and that wins \r\nwide approval, thus facilitating its implementation. \r\nReform measures should stress the need for \r\ntransparency and good will and the avoidance of \r\nindividual manoeuvres that seek to promote narrow \r\nself interests. The purpose of membership in the \r\nSecurity Council is to serve international peace and \r\nsecurity, and membership carries burdens and \r\nresponsibilities on an international scale. Members of \r\nthe Security Council must not seek to achieve political \r\ngains or give privileges to specific countries or \r\ngeographical groupings. The purpose of the Security \r\nCouncil is much higher and nobler than that; it is to \r\nspread peace, stability and security all over the world. \r\n The position of the State of Kuwait vis-à-vis the \r\nissue of reform of the Security Council emanates from \r\nthe following principled positions. The State of Kuwait \r\nstrongly supports the reform and reinvigoration of all \r\nof the United Nations bodies and organs, especially the \r\nSecurity Council, to enable it to carry out its function \r\nas mandated by the Charter, which is the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security. Any change in the \r\ncomposition of the Council must not reduce its \r\ncapability and effectiveness in taking decisions to \r\nconfront international threats and dangers but rather \r\nmust lend more legitimacy and credibility to the \r\nCouncil’s resolutions. \r\n Concerning the reform and improvement of the \r\nCouncil’s working methods and its relations with other \r\nUnited Nations bodies, such as the General Assembly \r\nand the Economic and Social Council, we support all \r\nthe proposals aiming to lend more transparency and \r\nclarity to the work of the Council, including the easy \r\nflow of information to and from the Member States of \r\nthe United Nations. We also support the need to totally \r\nrespect the functions and the competence of the other \r\nmain bodies, especially the General Assembly, and to \r\ndefine the role of the Council in considering the issues \r\nthat threaten international peace and security. \r\n We stress the importance of codifying the \r\nmeasures taken by the Security Council to improve its \r\nworking methods without waiting for agreement on \r\nother issues such as the size and composition of the \r\nCouncil and the decision-making process, especially \r\nsince the codification of those measures will not \r\nnecessarily lead to any amendments to the Charter. We \r\nalso believe that the time has come for the Council to \r\nadopt a permanent list of working methods, to improve \r\nand codify its measures and working methods.  \r\n We also support the maintenance of the \r\nmechanism of electing the non-permanent members of \r\nthe Council in accordance with Article 23, paragraph 2, \r\nof the United Nations Charter. This allows a better \r\nchance to small States like ours to become members of \r\nthe Council and participate in its work, especially in \r\nlight of the fact that six and a half decades after the \r\nestablishment of the United Nations almost one fourth \r\nof the membership has not attained membership in the \r\nCouncil. \r\n As concerns the question of the power of veto, \r\nthere must be checks and controls for the use of the \r\nveto. It should be restricted to matters that fall under \r\nChapter VII of the Charter. If we increase the number \r\nof non-permanent seats, they should be distributed to \r\nregional groups, taking into account the great increase \r\nin the number of Asian countries. \r\n Finally, we reaffirm our support for all efforts \r\nleading to consolidating the performance of the \r\nSecurity Council, and we hope that an agreement on a \r\nformulation, satisfactory to all sides, will be reached, \r\nensuring that the Council will carry out its functions as \r\nprovided by the Charter, without any obstacles. \r\n A/64/PV.44\r\n \r\n27 09-60619 \r\n \r\n Mr. Park In-kook (Republic of Korea): I would \r\nlike to begin by thanking the President of the Assembly \r\nfor organizing this joint debate. My special \r\nappreciation also extends to the current President of the \r\nSecurity Council, Ambassador Mayr-Harting of \r\nAustria, for introducing the report of the Security \r\nCouncil (A/64/2). My delegation is grateful for the \r\nhard work that went into compiling this report, \r\nespecially by Uganda, President of the Security \r\nCouncil for the month of July. The Council had a \r\nparticularly heavy workload during the period covered \r\nby the report, and we greatly appreciate the work \r\ncarried out by the Council to deal with a wide variety \r\nof multifaceted challenges in all corners of the globe. \r\n I would like to address agenda item 119, which \r\nwe believe to be of critical significance in \r\nstrengthening the overall legitimacy of the Council so \r\nthat it can continue to discharge its duties effectively. \r\nDuring the past year, some important milestones were \r\nerected in the ongoing discussion to reform the \r\nCouncil. Most notably, the historic launch of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations in February of this year \r\nkick-started three rounds of negotiations, which gave \r\nMember States ample opportunity to examine all \r\naspects of the reform process and to exchange views \r\nunder the committed leadership of Ambassador Tanin, \r\nthe Chair of the negotiations.  \r\n Through the three rounds of negotiations, \r\nMember States looked closely at the five key issues \r\nlaid out in General Assembly decision 62/557, namely, \r\ncategory, the veto power, regional representation, size \r\nand working methods, as well as the Council’s \r\nrelationship with the General Assembly. From those \r\nintense and sometimes heated discussions there \r\nemerged an understanding that all of those issues are \r\nclosely interconnected and that it would be virtually \r\nimpossible to take them apart arbitrarily, no matter how \r\nbadly all Member States wanted to conclude a reform \r\nagreement. Hence, the requirement of \r\ncomprehensiveness of any reform package became \r\nabundantly clear. \r\n With regard to the quality of exchanges that took \r\nplace within the three rounds, my delegation was \r\npleased with the insights shared by many delegations, \r\nand we feel that they have contributed to the \r\ndiscussions in a meaningful and positive manner. A \r\nfrank exchange of views occurred, and each delegation \r\nmade constructive use of the meetings over the course \r\nof the year to state their positions. We are, however, \r\ncompelled to express our disappointment that too little \r\nsubstantive progress was actually made in terms of the \r\npositions of major groups.  \r\n The increasing interest in and willingness to \r\nconsider the intermediary solution as a realistic \r\ncompromise to the deadlock was, however, certainly \r\nencouraging. That trend was especially notable toward \r\nthe end of the second and third rounds, when a separate \r\nsession was devoted to the exploration of intermediary \r\napproaches, in response to requests by Member States \r\nwho felt that that option deserved a more focused \r\nscrutiny. We certainly hope that that avenue will be \r\nfurther explored in the next stage of our negotiations. \r\n My delegation continues to believe that in \r\npursuing the reform of the Council we should above all \r\nstrive to strengthen the democratic underpinnings of \r\nthe Council and enhance its larger accountability to the \r\nmembership. In that connection, we support periodic \r\nelections, precisely because they offer the best way to \r\nensure accountability. Indeed, the entire United \r\nNations system is built upon a system of \r\naccountability, as we can witness in the myriad of \r\nelections that take place within the various organs of \r\nthe United Nations on a regular basis. The Security \r\nCouncil should not and cannot be an exception to that \r\noverarching principle. The prospect of having their \r\nperformance scrutinized and validated by the \r\nmembership through a periodic election is naturally the \r\nmost important incentive for the members of the \r\nCouncil to continually improve the quality of their \r\nwork. Furthermore, it is the entire membership that \r\nwill benefit from this approach.  \r\n Flexibility and adaptability are also crucial \r\nrequirements for a Security Council that we envisage \r\nto remain relevant and sustainable in the decades to \r\ncome. Just as it would be impossible to capture all \r\neternity in a mere snapshot, it would be a mistake to \r\nassume that a rapidly changing world will be served by \r\na rigidly structured Security Council where those lucky \r\nenough to make it through the entryway once will \r\nremain there perpetually. Again, a system like that \r\nwould go against the very values enshrined in the \r\nCharter. \r\n In this regard, my delegation contends that an \r\nincrease in the number of elected seats will help us to \r\nmeet the goal of granting equitable access to all \r\nqualified Member States, large or small, that wish to \r\nserve on the Council. The right to contribute to the \r\nA/64/PV.44  \r\n \r\n09-60619 28 \r\n \r\nmaintenance of peace and security should not be a \r\nprivilege of the chosen few. We believe that every \r\nMember State has something to offer to enrich the \r\nwork of the Council, and the opportunity to do so \r\nshould not be limited outright by a static structure that \r\nthe world continues to revolve around. \r\n Promoting balanced representation among the \r\nregional groups on the Council, especially those \r\nhistorically underrepresented, is another important \r\nobjective of the reform process. This balance would be \r\nbest achieved by freeing up as many elected seats as \r\npracticable for the regional groups to occupy in an \r\nequitable and democratic manner. \r\n We also need to be mindful that an integral part \r\nof reforming the Security Council is improving its \r\nworking methods. To that end, we welcome the \r\ninitiatives that have been put forward to enhance the \r\ntransparency, accountability, efficiency and inclusiveness \r\nof the Council’s work, and believe that the increase in \r\nthe number of open meetings conducted during the \r\nperiod covered in the report attests to the commitment \r\nof the Council in this respect. We continue to support \r\nthe idea that, wherever possible, we should try to \r\nimplement the improvements in working methods as an \r\nearly harvest, not to be held hostage by the lag in the \r\nentire reform process. \r\n As we look back on the progress achieved thus \r\nfar, we face the daunting task of charting a forward-\r\nlooking course for the future of reform. Therefore, we \r\nlook to the President of the General Assembly, as well \r\nas to the guidance of the chair of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, Ambassador Tanin, in this respect. We \r\nhave the utmost confidence that the President can steer \r\nus down a path that is both equitable and progress-\r\noriented. \r\n At the same time, we stress the importance of \r\nmodalities that will unite rather than divide the \r\nmembership and allow the political will of the Member \r\nStates to come together for timely reform. If any \r\nreform is to be successful, it simply must have the \r\nsupport of an overwhelming majority of the membership. \r\n I would like to conclude by reassuring the \r\nPresident and the Chair of my delegation’s full support \r\nand commitment to working with them for progress as \r\nwe embark on a new phase of work on this significant \r\nissue.  \r\n Mrs. Miculescu (Romania): At the outset, I \r\nwould like to express my delegation’s appreciation for \r\nthe convening of this meeting. I would also like to \r\nexpress our gratitude to Ambassador Mayr-Harting for \r\nenergetically introducing the report of the Security \r\nCouncil (A/64/2); to Ambassador Rugunda for his hard \r\nwork in putting together the report, with the \r\ninstrumental help of the Secretariat; and to all of the \r\nmembers of the Security Council, whose intense daily \r\nactivities are described in this valuable document. It is \r\ncommendable that last year’s initiative of Viet Nam to \r\nconvene an informal meeting with the Member States \r\nto exchange views on the report was also implemented \r\nthis year. We hope to see it turned into a tradition. \r\n As a general assessment of the yearly report, \r\nRomania wholeheartedly welcomes the trend in \r\nincreasing the openness and transparency of the \r\nSecurity Council and its work by multiplying the \r\nnumber of open debates and briefings held. Such \r\nevents give all the States Members of the United \r\nNations to come together more closely and even to \r\ncontribute political and intellectual inputs on issues of \r\nutmost importance with respect to what the Charter \r\nranks as the first among the Organization’s purposes — \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. \r\nWe commend and encourage this trend, for it is \r\nbeneficial to the entire membership. \r\n In discharging its mandate entrusted by the \r\nCharter, the Security Council coped with a very busy \r\nagenda in this reporting period, which included field \r\nmissions to Afghanistan, Africa and Haiti, as well as a \r\nstrong engagement in a plethora of demanding \r\nsituations around the world, including the Middle East, \r\nIraq, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and \r\nNepal, to mention just a few. At the same time, we \r\nmust not lose sight of the fact that there were instances, \r\nsuch as the situation in Georgia, when the Security \r\nCouncil had difficulties in reacting adequately to dispel \r\nthe tensions. Although the mandate of the United \r\nNations Observer Mission in Georgia was not \r\nextended, the Security Council’s attention to the \r\nsituation that arose after the conflict in August 2008 \r\nshould not dissipate. It is extremely important that the \r\nCouncil continue to monitor the file and support \r\nUnited Nations involvement in the international \r\ndiscussions on this matter, as the situation clearly still \r\nbears relevant consequences for regional and \r\ninternational peace and security. \r\n A/64/PV.44\r\n \r\n29 09-60619 \r\n \r\n We praise the close attention paid by the Security \r\nCouncil not only to specific crises, such as the those I \r\nmentioned earlier, but also to thematic debates of \r\ncomprehensive relevance, such as the protection of \r\ncivilians in armed conflicts, children and armed \r\nconflict, women and peace and security, peacebuilding \r\nand peacekeeping. With reference to the latter, let me \r\nstress our view that peacekeeping is one clear example \r\nwhere multilateralism can achieve success. The British \r\nand French non-paper presented earlier this year and \r\nthe Secretariat’s New Horizon document are two \r\nvaluable documents that stand out as means for \r\nstrengthening the engagement between troop-\r\ncontributing countries (TCCs), the Secretariat and the \r\nSecurity Council. We share the conviction that a final \r\ndocument would boost both the effectiveness and the \r\ntransparency of the triangular cooperation among the \r\nSecurity Council, TCCs and the Secretariat, as well as \r\nthe operational ability of United Nations peacekeeping \r\ntroops deployed on the ground. \r\n My delegation is of the view that combating \r\nterrorism ranks high on the Security Council’s agenda, \r\nbearing in mind that this scourge knows no boundaries \r\nand needs a global response. In this respect, we \r\ncommend the swift reaction of the Security Council \r\nwhenever terrorist attacks have occurred, including in \r\nAfghanistan, India, Iraq, Lebanon or Pakistan. Against \r\nthis background, it is noteworthy to recall the intense \r\nactivity carried out by the Security Council \r\nCommittees established pursuant to resolutions 1267 \r\n(1999), 1373 (2001) and 1540 (2004). My country \r\nwelcomes the trend towards a more coherent and \r\nintegrated approach shown by these Committees in \r\nfulfilling their mandates. \r\n As a country that, during its term on the Security \r\nCouncil in 2004 and 2005, had a profound interest and \r\ninvested a great deal of energy in deepening United \r\nNations cooperation with regional and subregional \r\norganizations, Romania is pleased to note that, over the \r\nreporting period, the Security Council was very active \r\non this matter. We encourage it to continue to be so. \r\nSeveral situations that arose in the past year showcased \r\nthat regional actors have a valuable, unique \r\ncontribution to make to security and stability matters \r\npertaining to their region, and the United Nations \r\nshould certainly capitalize on that. \r\n I would like to make a final point concerning this \r\nagenda item. No doubt, the report has provided pundits \r\nwith a snapshot about the heavy workload carried by \r\nthe Security Council. Nevertheless, as a public \r\ndocument to which any interested person could gain \r\naccess, the report falls short of being sufficiently \r\nexplanatory. If it had been more analytical, it could \r\nhave given everyone a high-definition picture of the \r\ntremendous efforts and energy invested by the Security \r\nCouncil in finding viable solutions to complicated \r\ncrises. Such a picture is essential if we are to ensure \r\nthe constant support of public opinion in our countries \r\nfor the values and goals promoted by the United \r\nNations. \r\n Let me now turn to the second agenda item under \r\nconsideration today — Security Council reform. I \r\nwould like to express my delegation’s great \r\nappreciation for the decision of Mr. Ali Abdussalam \r\nTreki to include this topic of paramount importance \r\namong the priorities of his mandate at the helm of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, as well as for his reappointment of \r\nAmbassador Zahir Tanin as facilitator of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. His elegant mastery \r\nand efficient stewardship cleared the atmosphere of the \r\nfatigue and immobility that had clouded the beginning \r\nof those negotiations. I hope that other members share \r\nthat point of view. We admire the resolve and \r\nperseverance that he has constantly displayed, and I \r\nwant to assure the Assembly that he can certainly count \r\non Romania’s support in pushing the Security Council \r\nreform process forward. \r\n As we have always stated, Romania is among the \r\nsupporters of meaningful reform of the Security \r\nCouncil, for that principal United Nations organ should \r\nbetter reflect the political realities of the current \r\ninternational arena. In that respect, we stress the need \r\nto improve the Council’s working methods, decision-\r\nmaking mechanisms and transparency, in accordance \r\nwith the strong desire of all Member States, as \r\nexpressed during today’s discussion. \r\n As I have mentioned many times before, in order \r\nto be qualitatively meaningful and to have a sound \r\npolitical foundation, reform should be aimed at \r\nexpanding both existing membership categories. At the \r\nsame time, we must not lose sight of the fact that only \r\nreform based on equitable geographic representation \r\ncould garner the full confidence of all Member States \r\nthat they would receive fair treatment from the \r\nOrganization. That is why we have always believed \r\nand continue to believe that the requests for better \r\nrepresentation in the Security Council put forward by \r\nthe Eastern European Group — which is asking for at \r\nA/64/PV.44  \r\n \r\n09-60619 30 \r\n \r\nleast one additional non-permanent seat — as well as \r\nby the Latin American and Caribbean, African and \r\nAsian groups, are fully legitimate. \r\n We are of the view that the size of the \r\nenlargement should not exceed 10 seats. We believe \r\nthat the future size of the Security Council should be \r\nestablished according to the following parameters: the \r\nequitable geographical distribution of seats, the desire \r\nto preserve and even strengthen the effectiveness of the \r\nCouncil, and the need of aspiring members to prove \r\nthat they have the capacity to assist the United Nations \r\nin fulfilling its goals and purposes. \r\n The discussion we had during the third round of \r\nnegotiations revealed the clear interest of many \r\ndelegations in determining the feasibility of an \r\nintermediate or interim formula. My delegation \r\nconsiders that we should continue to explore the merits \r\nof such a formula if it could help us to advance reform. \r\n In conclusion, I wish to recall that, at the summit \r\nto be held in September 2010, we will have to report \r\non the progress of Security Council reform, since we \r\nwere given a specific mandate in that regard in 2005 by \r\nour heads of State and Government. Therefore, my \r\ndelegation looks forward to receiving a timetable and, \r\neventually, a document for the next round of \r\nnegotiations, as we are eager to have them start sooner \r\nrather than later. We must capitalize on the undeniable \r\nsupport for Security Council reform that emerged \r\nduring the heated debates that we had during the first \r\nthree rounds of negotiations. \r\n Finally, let me express our confidence that, in all \r\nthese endeavours, no challenge is too great for our \r\nnations if we remain united. No danger is strong \r\nenough to defeat us if we marshal our wisdom and our \r\ncapacities. \r\n The meeting rose at 6.15 p.m.  \r\n \r\n"
