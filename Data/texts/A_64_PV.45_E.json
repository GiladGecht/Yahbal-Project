(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda items 9 and 119 (continued) \r\n \r\nReport of the Security Council (A/64/2) \r\n \r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and increase \r\nin the membership of the Security Council and \r\nrelated matters \r\n \r\n Ms. Blum (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): Allow \r\nme to begin by expressing my delegation’s \r\nappreciation for the manner in which you, \r\nMr. President, have conducted the work of the General \r\nAssembly thus far during this session and for the \r\nimportance you have assigned to the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council during your presidency. \r\n My delegation associates itself with the statement \r\nmade on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement by the \r\nPermanent Representative of Egypt (see A/64/PV.43).  \r\n I would also like to express our thanks to the \r\ndelegation of Uganda for the preparation of the report \r\nof the Security Council to the Assembly (A/64/2) for \r\nthe period from August 2008 to July 2009 and to the \r\nambassador of Austria for presenting it.  \r\n Colombia would like to highlight the need for \r\nthis document to go beyond compiling and \r\nenumerating in the future, and for it to include more \r\nqualitative information, such as the criteria used by the \r\nCouncil in its decision-making. \r\n With regard to the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil, Colombia would like to highlight the work of \r\nthe ambassador of Afghanistan in his capacity as chair \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations held in the \r\nAssembly’s informal plenary. I wish to express, on \r\nbehalf of my delegation, our support for Ambassador \r\nTanin in the continuation of his work during this \r\nsession. \r\n During the previous session of the General \r\nAssembly we began a negotiation process that can be \r\nconsidered historic, as it is a starting point for \r\nachieving concrete results in Council reform. The three \r\nrounds of intergovernmental negotiations, in which a \r\nlarge number of Member States participated, allowed \r\nus to have a valuable exchange of views and furthered \r\nour understanding of the vision of various Member \r\nStates with regard to the process. We must take \r\nadvantage of the clarity that we have gained and \r\ncontinue moving forward on the basis of the progress \r\nachieved. One of the primary objectives must be \r\ncorrecting the inequities and inefficiencies that affect \r\nthe functioning of the Council. \r\n The process that we are continuing today has \r\ngenerated a momentum that must result in a \r\ncomprehensive reform of the Council, achieving to a \r\nmore democratic, representative and transparent body \r\nin which there is greater effectiveness and better \r\naccountability. While the negotiations have \r\ndemonstrated that there are issues on which the \r\npositions remain some distance apart, there are areas of \r\nreform that have the support of a large majority of \r\nMember States. \r\nA/64/PV.45  \r\n \r\n09-60625 2 \r\n \r\n For example, I doubt that any delegation \r\ndisagrees with the fact that the ongoing improvement \r\nof the Security Council’s working methods is a priority. \r\nAll Member States of our Organization, especially \r\nthose on the Council, must make efforts to ensure that \r\nit becomes a more transparent and participatory body. \r\nTo achieve that, the Council must more often operate in \r\nan open manner. We need better access to information \r\nby way of a larger number of open meetings and \r\nspecial sessions and better interaction between the \r\nCouncil and the rest of the membership. The number of \r\nclosed meetings and informal negotiations must be \r\nreduced. The Council should also allow greater access \r\nfor States not members of the Council, in particular \r\nthose directly affected by the issues being discussed. \r\nLikewise, decision-making by the Council should be \r\nbased on clear procedures, in order to guarantee \r\ntransparency. \r\n With regard to the veto, Colombia has opposed \r\nthat privilege since the creation of the United Nations \r\nand has advocated its abolition. We realize that it is a \r\nsensitive matter and that discussion of it could delay \r\nour deliberations on reform. An in-depth review of the \r\npossible alternatives for limiting the arbitrary use of \r\nthat power, so as to make the decision-making process \r\nmore democratic, has wide support among Members \r\nand could be a starting point. As my delegation has \r\npreviously expressed, limiting the use of the veto to \r\nsituations falling under Chapter VII of the United \r\nNations Charter, creating mechanisms that could \r\nreverse or neutralize its application, or tightening the \r\nconditions under which it can be used are additional \r\noptions that deserve serious consideration. \r\n Colombia, like the majority of the membership, \r\nfirmly believe that all States, large, medium or small, \r\nshould have an equal opportunity to participate in the \r\nCouncil. The situation of historically underrepresented \r\ngroups and regions, especially Africa, must be \r\nremedied. \r\n The reality of the current process is that in the \r\nmajority of areas there is wide agreement on how to \r\nachieve comprehensive reform. Most differences of \r\nopinion correspond to the discussion of categories of \r\nmembership, and that is precisely where we must direct \r\nour best efforts.  \r\n Expanding the permanent-member category of \r\nthe Security Council would conflict with our ideals. \r\nExtending permanent membership and the privileges \r\nthat come with it to a few countries would be \r\ndetrimental to the participation of small and medium \r\nStates, which should have equal rights when it comes \r\nto influencing the decisions and actions of the Council. \r\n The implications for our Organization of \r\nincreasing the number of permanent members are clear. \r\nIt is impossible to talk about democratization or \r\nsovereign equality and at the same time to extend \r\narbitrary privileges to a few States. We cannot demand \r\ngreater transparency and at the same time exempt a few \r\nfrom accountability to the rest of the membership. \r\nLikewise, we need to recognize the risks in appointing \r\nnew members in perpetuity without knowing what the \r\nfuture holds. We must look for democratic alternatives \r\nthat guarantee transparency and strengthen the \r\naccountability and representativeness of all States. \r\n Colombia recognizes the aspirations of some \r\nStates that seek to become permanent members of the \r\nCouncil and have expressed the desire to contribute to \r\nthe work of the Council and to the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security beyond the \r\nnon-renewable two-year term. The intermediate option, \r\nwhich my delegation has discussed on previous \r\noccasions, could be a viable option to enable some \r\nStates to participate without compromising our guiding \r\nprinciples. An increase in the number of \r\nnon-permanent seats with the possibility of re-election, \r\nor the creation of new, extended-term seats, is a \r\nformula for convergence that could bring together \r\npositions that to date have opposed each other. \r\n Although great challenges still lie ahead in the \r\nsearch for an agreement, today we find ourselves closer \r\nto a solution than before. The process requires the full \r\ncommitment, flexibility and goodwill of all Member \r\nStates to negotiate in an open and sincere manner. The \r\nsuccess of our work will depend on genuine efforts to \r\nfind a common ground that allows for the broadest \r\npolitical agreement — of more than two thirds of the \r\nmembership — and thus give reform the necessary \r\nlegitimacy.  \r\n You may rest assured, Mr. President, that \r\nColombia will continue to support your efforts, as well \r\nas those of Ambassador Tanin, in order to further the \r\ngoal of making the Security Council a more \r\ndemocratic, transparent and participatory body that \r\nmeets contemporary realities. \r\n Mr. Álvarez (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): With \r\nregard to the report of the Security Council (A/64/2), \r\n A/64/PV.45\r\n \r\n3 09-60625 \r\n \r\nwe wish to note once again that late access to the \r\ndefinitive version of the report makes detailed analysis \r\nof the document very difficult, particularly in view of \r\nits length. As for the insight into the activities of the \r\nCouncil that the report offers to the rest of the \r\nMembers of the United Nations, we can say only that it \r\nretains the same features as previous reports, avoiding \r\nany substantive discussion, which makes for rather dull \r\nreading for us, the peoples of the United Nations who \r\nare not part of the Security Council except for perhaps \r\nonce every 30 or 40 years. \r\n With regard to reform of the Security Council, \r\nUruguay has always maintained a flexible position, \r\naccepting that increasing the categories of both \r\npermanent and non-permanent members can be \r\nconsidered. Uruguay has lent its support to the \r\nproposals submitted by Japan, Brazil, Germany and \r\nIndia. \r\n Uruguay is firmly opposed to granting the veto to \r\nnew permanent members created by the eventual \r\nreform. Therefore we oppose the direct or indirect \r\ngranting of the veto, whether through moratoriums on \r\nthe exercise of a hypothetical right or through any \r\nother kind of mechanism that would seek to prolong \r\nsuch an extension.  \r\n Uruguay’s principled position goes back to the \r\noriginal moment of creation of the United Nations. At \r\nthe San Francisco Conference, the Uruguayan \r\ndelegation underscored the need to ensure that \r\nmembers of the Security Council joined that body with \r\nno differences in prerogatives or rights, accepting that \r\nthose countries that had borne the heaviest burden \r\nduring the war should be assured seats on the Council, \r\nbut not indefinitely, proposing a timeline that could be \r\ndeemed prudent. “With no differences in prerogatives \r\nor rights” — that is the essential feature of the legal \r\nequality States, which is a central element of the \r\nCharter itself. The creation of new privileges would \r\nundermine the original basis of the Charter. \r\n We cannot ignore the fact that many of the issues \r\naddressed during the rounds of intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations have been discussed for over 12 years now \r\nand that there has been no agreement on them. \r\nTherefore we do not believe that it would be advisable \r\nfor now to insist on issues that we know will not enjoy \r\nconsensus or a broad majority. Those topics include the \r\nquestion of the veto. \r\n In this regard, we wish to announce that, at the \r\nright time and while awaiting the development of \r\ndiscussions and the nature of the proposals to be made, \r\nthe delegation of Uruguay will present texts of \r\namendments or will propose a vote on all those \r\nparagraphs that would allow for proposing alternatives \r\nthat establish the veto or applying the majorities \r\nrequired under Article 27 of the Charter to any of the \r\nnew elected members in order to take up their \r\nfunctions in a reformed Council. \r\n Finally, Uruguay supports the reform of the \r\nworking methods of the Security Council in keeping \r\nwith the proposals submitted within the various \r\nnegotiating forums, in particular those presented by the \r\nso-called Group of Five.  \r\n Mr. Korček (Slovakia): It is a great privilege and \r\nhonour for me to participate in today’s joint annual \r\ndebate on two crucially important and interrelated \r\nagenda items dealing with the report of the Security \r\nCouncil and with the issue of equitable representation \r\non and increase in the membership of the Security \r\nCouncil. We believe that our fruitful discussions \r\nyesterday and today will provide further impetus for \r\nthe upcoming continuation of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on the reform of the Security Council. \r\n My delegation welcomes the annual report of the \r\nSecurity Council contained in the document A/64/2. \r\nThe complexity, volume and continually increasing \r\nnumber of meetings are a worrying sign of the growing \r\nchallenges in the area of international peace and \r\nsecurity. We note with appreciation, however, that yet \r\nagain this year the Council opened more meetings to \r\nthe wider membership of the Organization.  \r\n From the statistical point of view, the annual \r\nreport offers truly interesting and informative reading. \r\nHowever, we do regret that in spite of repeated calls \r\nfor more in-depth reporting, this year’s report again \r\nfails to provide a more analytical portrayal of the \r\nproceedings over the past 12 months. More substantial \r\nand analytical reporting that highlights the areas where \r\nthe Council was able to respond effectively and where, \r\non the contrary, it failed to act, would be much more \r\nconducive to meaningful and effective consideration of \r\nthe work of the Security Council and to the success of \r\nour ongoing intergovernmental discussions on its \r\nreform as we strive to make the Council a truly \r\neffective and credible organ. \r\nA/64/PV.45  \r\n \r\n09-60625 4 \r\n \r\n This joint debate today provides us with an \r\nexcellent opportunity to consider effectively not just \r\nthe report of the Council but also the ways to improve \r\nits work and its relationship with the General \r\nAssembly, also in the context of the overall Council \r\nreform process. In that regard, we welcome your \r\ncommitment, Mr. President, to the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform and appreciate \r\nyour entrusting to Ambassador Zahir Tanin of \r\nAfghanistan his continuing role in presiding on your \r\nbehalf over our debate. We would like to take this \r\nopportunity to pay tribute to Ambassador Tanin for the \r\nable manner in which he has been guiding us through \r\nour complex deliberations and to assure him of our full \r\nsupport in this difficult task. \r\n At the 2005 World Summit, heads of State and \r\nGovernment declared:  \r\n  “We recommend that the Security Council \r\ncontinue to adapt its working methods so as to \r\nincrease the involvement of States not members \r\nof the Council in its work, as appropriate, \r\nenhance its accountability to the membership and \r\nincrease the transparency of its work”. (resolution \r\n60/1, para. 154)  \r\nWe cannot reaffirm strongly enough the importance of \r\nimplementing that recommendation. Even though we \r\nparticularly welcome the Council’s enhanced \r\ntransparency and improved working methods over \r\nrecent years, it is undisputable that adapting the \r\nCouncil to the realities of the twenty-first century calls \r\nfor further measures.  \r\n The questions of size and categories of \r\nmembership have proven to pose the greatest challenge \r\nto our reform efforts. Therefore, as we continue with \r\nour deliberations, my delegation believes the time is \r\nripe to start narrowing their scope and engage in a \r\nserious attempt to define concrete and precise \r\nparameters of the next steps. That approach means \r\neliminating those proposals that do not enjoy sufficient \r\nsupport and elaborating further on those ideas to which \r\na majority of Member States have expressed readiness \r\nto consider favourably.  \r\n As we move forward with the next round of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, it is essential that we \r\nbuild upon the positive momentum created so far and \r\navoid having a new round of restating well-known \r\npositions. To facilitate our move towards more \r\nsubstantial and concrete deliberations, we would very \r\nmuch be in favour of having a negotiating document \r\nfrom the Chairperson to serve as basis for our next \r\ndebates. \r\n My delegation believes that States capable of \r\nassuming global responsibility for the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security should become eligible \r\nfor filling the posts of potential new permanent \r\nmembers of the Security Council — provided that the \r\nright of the veto is not further extended. To the \r\ncontrary, the veto must also be subjected to serious \r\nreform as to its scope and the manner in which it is \r\napplied. Although we have heard a majority of Member \r\nStates stating their support for the expansion of the \r\nSecurity Council in both categories, the inability to \r\nagree on this point has resulted in a stalemate that we \r\nhave not been able to overcome for years.  \r\n Any prolonged hesitation to act and reach \r\ntangible results in Security Council reform will have \r\nfurther negative consequences on the overall reputation \r\nof the United Nations. To make this Organization truly \r\ntrustworthy and relevant, we have a duty to reform the \r\nSecurity Council without further unnecessary delay. \r\n Therefore, in the spirit of compromise in our \r\nquest for an effective outcome, we believe the \r\nintermediate solution merits our serious consideration. \r\nThe notion of holding a review conference makes any \r\nnew formats temporary. Furthermore, in order to allow \r\nfor new members to truly settle into their new roles and \r\nprove their capabilities without having to deal with the \r\nstress of a fast-approaching re-election or review, it is \r\nessential that they remain in their seats at least for \r\n10 to 15 years. That approach will inevitably prove to \r\nbe a challenge for prospective new permanent \r\nmembers, as they would be subject to review. If they \r\nmeet that challenge successfully and earn the trust of \r\nthe overall United Nations membership, they would \r\nhave to go through another democratic election process \r\nto obtain a permanent seat. \r\n As for regional representation, it is essential to \r\nensure that distribution of posts within the Council’s \r\nnon-permanent category be done on an equitable \r\ngeographic basis. We believe that the regional group of \r\nEastern European States needs to be allocated at least \r\none additional non-permanent seat. \r\n It is indisputable that the Council must become \r\nmore representative. However, the enlargement must \r\nnot compromise its ability to function as the executive \r\norgan that the Charter designed it to be. It is difficult to \r\n A/64/PV.45\r\n \r\n5 09-60625 \r\n \r\nimagine a more serious threat to the United Nations \r\nthan an inoperable Security Council. We believe that \r\nthe number of members of the enlarged Council should \r\nnot exceed 25. \r\n In Article 24 of the Charter, we Member States \r\nconferred on the Security Council primary \r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security and agreed that the Council acts on \r\nour behalf. It is essential that we all remember that fact \r\nwhen deciding on the size of the Council. Rather than \r\nmaking it ineffectively large for the sake of \r\nrepresentation, we need to choose its representatives in \r\nsuch a way that we can fully trust them to act on behalf \r\nof us all. \r\n As we have stated on numerous previous \r\noccasions, my country’s primary goal in this process is \r\nto ensure a more effective and efficient Security \r\nCouncil truly able to deal with and act upon the \r\nmounting challenges that we all face. Slovakia \r\ntherefore is open to all constructive proposals and will \r\nconsider them with the utmost open-mindedness and \r\nflexibility. \r\n Mr. Al Habib (Islamic Republic of Iran): I wish \r\nto pay tribute to you, Mr. President, for convening this \r\njoint debate and for giving due attention to Security \r\nCouncil reform in the agenda of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-fourth session. Let me express my gratitude \r\nto the delegations of Uganda and Austria for preparing \r\nand introducing the report of the Security Council to \r\nthe General Assembly (A/64/2). My thanks go also to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Zahir Tanin, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Afghanistan, for all his invaluable \r\nefforts in presiding over the Assembly’s informal \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Council reform and \r\nfor his humble acceptance of that responsibility for the \r\nsecond consecutive year.  \r\n My delegation associates itself with the statement \r\nmade earlier by the representative of Egypt on behalf \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement. I wish to communicate \r\na few additional points. \r\n Each year, the Security Council, pursuant to \r\nArticle 24, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United \r\nNations, submits its high-profile annual report to the \r\nGeneral Assembly for consideration by the Assembly; \r\nand each year in turn, the Assembly, pursuant to Article \r\n15, paragraph 1, of the same Charter, receives and \r\nconsiders the report. However, expectations have still \r\nnot been met, and the report is still not convincing. \r\nWhat is the point of making minor changes to the \r\nreport, and what is the added value of this debate, if we \r\ndo not want a mere repetition of the usual list of \r\nactivities? The answer may lie in an understanding of \r\nthe nature of today’s meeting as a joint debate. \r\n The point of making such changes and the added \r\nvalue of this debate are to be found in the combination \r\nof the two agenda items before us. We are here to \r\nconsider the report of the Security Council together \r\nwith the question of equitable representation on and \r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council and \r\nrelated matters. Joint consideration of the report with \r\nthe reform process essentially serves the basic \r\nobjective of dealing with comprehensive Council \r\nreform in all its aspects. That merger should bear fruit \r\nin the form of a more democratic, inclusive, equitably \r\nrepresentative, transparent, effective and accountable \r\nCouncil.  \r\n Since last year, five key issues related to the \r\nSecurity Council reform process — including new \r\nmembership categories, the question of the veto, \r\nregional representation, the size of an enlarged \r\nCouncil, working methods and the relationship \r\nbetween the Council and the General Assembly — \r\nhave been discussed in detail in the Assembly. The \r\nhope was that those deliberations would somehow be \r\nreflected in practical terms in the work of the Council \r\nand its report. \r\n Undoubtedly, much work went into the \r\npreparation of the 263-page report before us. We have \r\ntaken note of the hard work done by the delegation of \r\nUganda and the Secretariat in this compilation of the \r\nCouncil’s undertakings. However, we need to think \r\ncritically in order to make substantive changes to the \r\nreport, so that it can depart from the customary \r\nrepetitive pattern of annual reports. For that reason, I \r\nshould like to take a look at the report and make a few \r\npoints concerning the objectives and key issues of the \r\nreform process.  \r\n First, it goes without saying that the current \r\ncomposition of the Security Council is anachronistic \r\nand is neither regionally balanced nor geographically \r\nor geopolitically reflective of today’s realities. In \r\naddition, many insightful and innovative independent \r\nstudies, carried out within and outside this body, need \r\nto be taken into account. Thus, it is necessary to \r\nconduct an independent and comprehensive study of \r\npossible new elements that would better reflect today’s \r\nA/64/PV.45  \r\n \r\n09-60625 6 \r\n \r\nrealities, responding to all the key issues of Security \r\nCouncil reform.  \r\n Needless to say, the under-representation of \r\ndeveloping countries — including those in the Muslim \r\nworld — on the Council must be seriously and \r\nsatisfactorily addressed. \r\n Secondly, the veto — and the fear of the veto as a \r\ntacit weapon in the hands of a few Member States — is \r\na non-constructive instrument that reduces the \r\npossibility of Council action in many ways \r\nand in various cases in which action is needed, which \r\nhas resulted in Council inactivity. The question of \r\nPalestine — including, in particular, last year’s \r\ninvasion and brutal bombardment of Gaza by the \r\nIsraeli regime — is one of the clearest examples of \r\nCouncil inactivity and intentional delay. \r\n Thus, the gradual elimination of the veto power is \r\nsupported by almost all delegations. Reflections and \r\nfurther deliberations on this important subject could be \r\nexplored, formulated and agreed upon. The report, \r\ntogether with other elements, could serve as a factual \r\naccount of events in which the use or threat of use of \r\nthe veto prevented or delayed Security Council \r\ndecisions. \r\n Thirdly, the long-time and continued practice by \r\nthe Security Council of encroaching on the mandates of \r\nother principal organs of the United Nations, \r\nparticularly the General Assembly, the Economic and \r\nSocial Council and their subsidiary bodies, as well as \r\nthe mandates of technical bodies such as the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, under the pretext \r\nof security should be abandoned forever. If we are to \r\ntackle this dilemma, it is high time that we work out a \r\npattern of cooperation by clearly defining each body’s \r\nprerogatives in detail, as well as the areas along their \r\nshared boundaries, which could be addressed in \r\ncollaboration between the bodies concerned. As a \r\npreliminary step, the report could provide a detailed \r\naccount of the Security Council’s exercise of its \r\nCharter prerogatives.  \r\n Fourthly, in accordance with the Charter, the \r\nGeneral Assembly, as the chief deliberative, \r\npolicymaking and representative organ of the United \r\nNations, is entrusted primarily with the task of the \r\nprogressive development and codification of \r\ninternational law. Therefore, norm-setting and \r\nlawmaking by the Security Council runs counter to the \r\nletter and spirit of the Charter. This could be \r\nanalytically assessed in the report in order to facilitate \r\nthe division of labour and tasks between the General \r\nAssembly and the Council. \r\n Fifthly, in accordance with Article 24 of the \r\nCharter, the Council’s decisions should reflect the \r\nwishes and views of the general membership. For that \r\nreason, the general membership — including, in \r\nparticular, the countries concerned — should be \r\ninformed about negotiations on resolutions or \r\nstatements directly affecting them. However, this has \r\noften not been the case. The report could discuss the \r\nrealization of that right. \r\n Sixthly, to help ensure that the Council’s working \r\nmethods enable it to carry out its responsibility with \r\nregard to the rights of non-Council members, the \r\nfollowing activities could also be listed and described \r\nin the report: implementing Article 31 of the Charter in \r\norder to allow non-Council members to participate in \r\ndiscussions on matters affecting them and their \r\ninterests; allowing the countries concerned to exercise \r\ntheir right to inform the Council of their positions on \r\nissues having a direct impact on their national \r\ninterests; providing non-selective notifications of \r\nCouncil meetings and convening regular daily \r\nbriefings; and considering a right of reply for countries \r\nagainst which allegations are raised during Council \r\nmeetings in certain formats.  \r\n Finally, no Council reform will be successful and \r\nno report will be complete unless and until all major \r\nissues are appropriately, comprehensively and \r\ninclusively addressed. Every effort should be made to \r\nmake the Security Council more democratic, \r\nrepresentative and accountable. Let me assure the \r\nAssembly of the full cooperation of my delegation to \r\nachieve those objectives. \r\n Mr. Valero Briceño (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): The Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela aligns itself with the statement \r\nmade by the representative of Egypt on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement. \r\n The principal responsibility of the Security \r\nCouncil is the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity. In that sphere there are highly important \r\nmatters, such as the situation in the Middle East and \r\nthe question of Palestine, in which the Council has \r\nshown great failings. \r\n A/64/PV.45\r\n \r\n7 09-60625 \r\n \r\n The issues we are touching upon today are of \r\nparticular significance in the necessary process of \r\nchange that must take place within the United Nations. \r\nSecurity Council reform is the key element in the \r\nprocess of strengthening the United Nations and \r\nbringing it into alignment with the changes in the \r\ninternational system in recent years. The Organization \r\nof the United Nations does not meet the expectations of \r\ndemocratization cherished by the peoples of the world. \r\nWe must transform it. The democratization of the \r\nUnited Nations should address both the specific \r\nstructures of its various principal organs and the \r\nexercise of a real democratic culture. All Member \r\nStates must respect its rules and decisions on the basis \r\nof the principle of sovereign equality among its \r\nMembers. No country can claim dominance over it. No \r\ncountry should be belittled. \r\n The Bolivarian Government believes that the \r\nreform — and thus the strengthening — of the \r\nOrganization inevitably must include the Security \r\nCouncil, the General Assembly and the Economic and \r\nSocial Council. Therefore, the reform should lead to \r\nstrengthening the role of the General Assembly in \r\ncarrying out the powers assigned to it by the Charter in \r\nthe field of peace and security, in accordance with \r\nArticles 10, 11, 12 and 13 of that international \r\ninstrument. Those issues should not be the exclusive \r\ncompetence of the Security Council. Venezuela \r\nconsiders that the General Assembly must remain the \r\nOrganization’s primary forum for discussion and \r\nmaintain its independence from other organs. It is \r\nnecessary to reverse the tendency of the Security \r\nCouncil to become involved in matters outside its \r\njurisdiction, undermining the central role of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. The United Nations, and \r\nparticularly the Security Council, cannot continue \r\nnavigating with a map based on an obsolete political \r\nreality formed by agreements made at the end of the \r\nSecond World War. What is required is an Organization \r\nrenewed on the basis of understanding among all \r\nMember States and that therefore authentically \r\nrepresents the interests of the peoples and \r\nGovernments committed to peace, justice, security and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n My delegation welcomes the decision of this \r\nAssembly to continue the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform during the \r\nsixty-fourth session in the terms specified by General \r\nAssembly decision 62/557. We share the call of various \r\ndelegations for the facilitator of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiating rounds to be given the mandate to produce \r\na basic text for future negotiations. \r\n Venezuela sees Security Council reform in terms \r\nof comprehensive results. Those should include \r\nexpanding the categories of permanent and \r\nnon-permanent members, the revision of the decision-\r\nmaking mechanism by way of eliminating the veto and \r\nthe improvement of working methods to ensure broad \r\nparticipation of Member States, especially in matters \r\nrelating to the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity.  \r\n We agree with the statement by the Open-ended \r\nWorking Group on the Question of Equitable \r\nRepresentation in the Security Council in \r\n1999 (A/53/47) that reform of the Council is linked \r\ninextricably to the question of the veto. The veto is an \r\nanachronism that violates the sovereign equality of \r\nStates and calls into question, within the Security \r\nCouncil itself, the very principle of democracy that this \r\nbody labours to promote internationally.  \r\n Venezuela reiterates its support for increasing the \r\nnumber of permanent and non-permanent members in \r\nthe Security Council, and strongly supports the \r\ninclusion of countries from the developing regions of \r\nAfrica, Latin America and the Caribbean and Asia, as \r\npermanent members. This is an unavoidable historic \r\ndemand. The Bolivarian Government also favours an \r\nincrease in the number of non-permanent members and \r\nan agreement to increase the membership of the \r\nSecurity Council to 25 or 26 members. \r\n Venezuela recognizes that in recent years there \r\nhave been some improvements. It welcomes the public \r\ndebate, which encourage the participation of Member \r\nStates in the discussion of issues of interest related to \r\ninternational peace and security. Those efforts, \r\nhowever, have been very limited. It is necessary to \r\nreverse the pernicious tendency of making closed \r\nmeetings the rule and public gatherings the exception. \r\nIn this matter it is necessary to respect rule 48 of the \r\nProvisional Rules and Procedures of the Security \r\nCouncil. \r\n It has been suggested that genuine \r\ndemocratization of the Security Council and greater \r\ntransparency of its operation could be achieved through \r\nimproved working methods. That is a reductionist \r\napproach. Venezuela observes with concern that the old \r\npractices of the Security Council, about which there is \r\nA/64/PV.45  \r\n \r\n09-60625 8 \r\n \r\nnothing democratic, continue on unchanged, adversely \r\naffecting the democratization, transparency and \r\nlegitimacy of that body. The Security Council should \r\nhold consultations with countries affected by its \r\ndecisions more often, guided by criteria of \r\ntransparency, participation and democratization. It \r\nshould invite countries that are not members of the \r\nCouncil to participate in informal consultations, using \r\nprocedures similar to those stipulated in Articles \r\n31 and 32 of the Charter. \r\n Peace is a goal that concerns all Member States \r\nwithout exception. Peace based on privileges is \r\ndiscriminatory and is fragile and contrary to the \r\naspirations of the democracy that we promote within \r\nmultilateral institutions. Reform of the United Nations \r\nmust necessarily lead to the strengthening of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, because that is the main \r\ndeliberative and policymaking organ of the \r\nOrganization, as well as its most representative. \r\n To ensure the necessary level of responsibility of \r\nthe Security Council to Member States, the Council \r\nmust submit regular substantive and analytical reports \r\nto the General Assembly. The Council’s current \r\npractice of reporting annually, in a merely factual \r\nformat, has not produced the desired results. The \r\nCouncil must be accountable to the General Assembly \r\nfor its activities in a systematic manner, in accordance \r\nwith Articles 15 and 24 (3) of the Charter.  \r\n To conclude, the Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela believes that the reform process — and \r\ntherefore the strengthening of the Organization — will \r\nbe possible only to the extent that the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter and the resolutions of its \r\nprincipal organs, including the General Assembly, are \r\nfully accepted and respected by all Member States. \r\n Mr. Jawan (Malaysia): My delegation aligns \r\nitself with the statement made yesterday by the \r\nPermanent Representative of Egypt on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement under this agenda item. \r\n Malaysia takes note of the report of the Security \r\nCouncil, as contained in document A/64/2. We \r\nrecognize the important work being carried out by the \r\nSecurity Council, as evidenced by the 228 formal \r\nmeetings and 141 consultations of the whole held by \r\nthe Council during the period under review. This adds \r\nup to more than one meeting per day, as the Security \r\nCouncil remains seized with more than 43 different \r\nissues relating to the maintenance of peace and security \r\nin four different continents. \r\n However, what does not add up is how these \r\nmany meetings were so efficiently summarized in a \r\nreport to the general membership of the United Nations \r\nin a mere 51 pages, with an additional 20 pages thrown \r\nin to describe the work of the subsidiary bodies of the \r\nCouncil. The other 202 pages were facts and figures \r\nrelating to the reference numbers of resolutions and \r\ntheir dates of adoption. In terms of balance, this does \r\nnot seem, to my delegation, to be balanced reporting of \r\nthe actual discussions that we know the Security \r\nCouncil to have carried out with all its due diligence \r\nand meticulousness. \r\n The general membership of this esteemed \r\nOrganization should be kept informed of the \r\ndeliberations of the Council, in particular those held in \r\nclosed sessions. The Charter of the United Nations \r\nstipulates that the Council act on behalf of the general \r\nmembership, thus making it obligatory that the \r\nmembership be notified not only of decisions of the \r\nCouncil, but also of the deliberations of the Council. \r\nThis is what we were hoping the report of the Security \r\nCouncil would contain — a more comprehensive \r\nreporting of the goings-on within the Council, as well \r\nas an analytical look at the many issues on the agenda \r\nof the Council. \r\n Malaysia would also like to have the countries \r\nconcerned be included in the deliberations of the \r\nCouncil rather than informed after the fact. This is \r\nprovided for under Article 32 of the Charter, and \r\nshould be strictly adhered to, rather than selectively \r\napplied. We hope to see a more streamlined and \r\nstandardized procedure in that respect. \r\n Malaysia was one of the countries that rejoiced \r\nwhen, at the end of the sixty-second session of this \r\nAssembly, Member States were able to push through, \r\nby consensus, an agreement to establish the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform at the informal plenary of the General \r\nAssembly. We believed that that breakthrough, though \r\nsmall in the eyes of the rest of the world, would finally \r\nput us on our way towards the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil after 14 long years of discussing the matter. \r\n Having gone through three rounds of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations at the sixty-third \r\nsession of the General Assembly, we are now not so \r\nconvinced that we actually achieved as much as we \r\n A/64/PV.45\r\n \r\n9 09-60625 \r\n \r\nthought we had. After a brilliant start under the able \r\nChairmanship of Ambassador Zahir Tanin of \r\nAfghanistan, the intergovernmental negotiations seem \r\nto have sort of fizzled out in the second and third \r\nrounds. The first round was successful in that it \r\noutlined the five key issues to be discussed: categories \r\nof membership, the question of the veto, regional \r\nrepresentation, the size of an enlarged Council and the \r\nworking methods of the Council, and the relationship \r\nbetween the Council and the General Assembly. All \r\nwere as outlined and agreed to in decision 62/557. \r\n Let me take this opportunity to briefly outline \r\nMalaysia’s position regarding these five key issues. We \r\nwould like to see an expansion of the Security Council \r\nin both categories, both permanent and non-permanent, \r\nwithout expansion of the veto and with a view to the \r\neventual abolition of the right to veto. The Security \r\nCouncil should be more representative. Hence its \r\nenlargement should take into account the fact that the \r\nmembership of the United Nations itself has grown \r\nover the past decades. Malaysia believes that seats on \r\nthe Council should be held by countries but that due \r\nregard should be paid to equitable geographical \r\nrepresentation. We also believe that the Council should \r\nbe more inclusive and transparent than under its \r\ncurrent working methods. There should be greatest \r\ninteraction between the Council and the General \r\nAssembly and due regard should be given to Article \r\n24.1 of the Charter of the United Nations, which \r\nstipulates that it is the Member States of the United \r\nNations that confer on the Security Council primary \r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security, and that the Council acts on their \r\nbehalf. \r\n My delegation is convinced that the second and \r\nsubsequent rounds of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations lacked the momentum afforded by \r\ndecision 62/557 and the sterling qualities of the first \r\nround because States did not have a negotiating text \r\nbefore them. It is still not too late for us to have such a \r\ncomposite text to form the basis of our negotiations \r\nduring the sixty-fourth session. If delegations are \r\nserious about moving forward, then they should prove \r\nit by giving the Chairman of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations the necessary mandate to produce this \r\ncomposite text that we need. \r\n The text should include all the options proposed \r\nfor each key issue. Then it will be the task of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations to taper down the list \r\nby eliminating those proposals that do not garner the \r\nminimum amount of support. Key among the proposals \r\nto be put forth should also be the intermediate \r\napproach, which seems to have gained much interest in \r\nthe last weeks of the sixty-third session of the General \r\nAssembly. We need to move forward. We need to truly \r\nnegotiate a tangible document rather than restate our \r\nlong-held views. \r\n In the coming months, progress will be measured \r\nnot by the sheer determination of those who want to \r\nmove forward, but by the flexibility of the delegations \r\nthat see obstacles rather than opportunities on this path \r\nupon which we have embarked. Malaysia affirms its \r\nstrong support for the process of reform of the Security \r\nCouncil, and in particular the question of the equitable \r\nrepresentation in the membership of the Security \r\nCouncil itself. It is time that we discard notions of \r\nelitism and embrace the promise of inclusiveness. And \r\nthat promise is well within our collective grasp. \r\n Mr. Sin Son Ho (Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea): At the outset, I should like to express my \r\ndelegation’s gratitude to you, Mr. President, for having \r\nconvened this important meeting on the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council. \r\n The reform of the Security Council has been on \r\nthe agenda for 15 years as part of the reform of the \r\nUnited Nations. In spite of strenuous efforts on the part \r\nof Member States to reform the Security Council so as \r\nbetter to reflect our changed environment, discussions \r\nhave continued to spiral around with no apparent \r\nresults. We note, in particular, that no progress has \r\nbeen achieved at all with regard to adequate \r\nrepresentation of developing countries on the Council.  \r\n Recently, certain countries have abused the \r\nSecurity Council for their own political ends by having \r\nit deal unlawfully with issues beyond its mandate. This \r\nhas inevitably led to the discrediting of the Council in \r\nthe eyes of the international community. The typical \r\nexample of the abuse is the calling into question in the \r\nSecurity Council of the satellite launch by the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea’s last April. To \r\ndate, no such satellite launch has ever been debated at \r\nthe Security Council. The Council has singled out and \r\ndebated this peaceful satellite launch by the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, which was \r\nlawfully conducted pursuant to all international legal \r\nprocedures. This matter clearly demonstrates the \r\nA/64/PV.45  \r\n \r\n09-60625 10 \r\n \r\nselectivity, arbitrariness and application of double \r\nstandards in the Council’s activities. \r\n This also constitutes a wanton violation of \r\ninternational treaties on outer space, which stipulate \r\nthat outer space should be free for exploration and use \r\nby all States without discrimination of any kind, on the \r\nbasis of equality and in accordance with international \r\nlaw.  \r\n The current situation shows that the Security \r\nCouncil is now reduced to a tool of arbitrariness and \r\nhigh-handedness overriding international law. This \r\nclearly demonstrates why the international community \r\nurgently demands reform of the Security Council, \r\nwhich lacks democracy and does not reflect the general \r\nwill of United Nations Member States. \r\n The delegation of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea wishes to recall the Final Document \r\nof the fifteenth summit of the Non-Aligned Movement, \r\nwhich reaffirmed that reform of the Security Council \r\nshould ensure that the agenda of the Council reflects \r\nthe needs and interests of both developing and \r\ndeveloped countries, in an objective, rational, \r\nnon-selective and non-arbitrary manner.  \r\n The wrongdoings in the Security Council, such as \r\nthe abuse of the Council by specific countries for their \r\nown political purposes, the unlawful victimization of \r\ndeveloping countries and the arbitrary imposition of \r\ncoercive measures such as sanctions, must be \r\nterminated once and for all. \r\n In order to ensure non-selectivity and impartiality \r\nin the activities of the Security Council, we deem it \r\nnecessary to establish a regime whereby major Council \r\nresolutions would come into force only upon \r\nendorsement by the General Assembly. \r\n Practices in the Security Council favouring \r\ninformal consultations and meetings should be \r\ndiscouraged, and open-ended and full participation on \r\nthe part of stakeholders, including the parties directly \r\nconcerned, in all consultative processes should be \r\nallowed, so that all relevant issues can be fairly \r\nconsidered.  \r\n It is also important to ensure that non-aligned and \r\nother developing countries — including, in particular, \r\nAfrican countries — which constitute the \r\noverwhelming majority of the United Nations \r\nmembership, are adequately represented within the \r\nSecurity Council. In that regard, it would be more \r\nrealistic and feasible to first expand the category of \r\nnon-permanent Council members.  \r\n Those are the conclusions drawn from the rounds \r\nof intergovernmental consultations on reform held this \r\nyear. \r\n With regard to increasing the number of \r\npermanent seats on the Security Council, Japan should \r\nnever be allowed to have such a seat, since it has \r\nrevived its militaristic ambitions by persistently \r\ndenying the history of its aggression, instead of \r\nrecognizing and atoning for its crime-ridden past. Any \r\ndiscussion of whether Japan should be granted \r\npermanent Council membership on the basis of its \r\ncontributions to United Nations activities would itself \r\nconstitute a dangerous and shameful move on the part \r\nof the international community. It would only stoke \r\nJapan’s unfulfilled ambition to create a Greater East \r\nAsia Co-Prosperity Sphere.  \r\n Mr. President, the delegation of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea is confident that, under \r\nyour able leadership, the current session of the General \r\nAssembly will identify realistic and innovative \r\napproaches to Security Council reform. \r\n Mrs. Aitimova (Kazakhstan): First of all, the \r\ndelegation of Kazakhstan would like to thank you, \r\nMr. President, for organizing these joint debates to \r\ndiscuss important issues such as the report of the \r\nSecurity Council (A/64/2) and the question of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of \r\nthe Security Council and related matters. \r\n I would like to express gratitude to the Security \r\nCouncil for providing us with the comprehensive \r\nreport on its work over the past year. My delegation \r\nwelcomes all the Council’s efforts to find peaceful \r\nsolutions to various situations and conflicts in many \r\nregions of our world during the period covered by the \r\nreport. In that regard, 228 official meetings were held, \r\n53 resolutions were adopted and 43 presidential \r\nstatements were issued. We acknowledge that, despite \r\nintensive debates in certain cases, the members of the \r\nCouncil were able to reach agreements and took action \r\nrelated to important decisions. During the reporting \r\nperiod, the Security Council thoroughly addressed \r\nvarious issues related to Africa, the Middle East, \r\ncounter-terrorism and non-proliferation, and it held \r\nthematic discussions on peacekeeping, the protection \r\nof civilians in armed conflict, women and peace and \r\nsecurity, and children in armed conflict. \r\n A/64/PV.45\r\n \r\n11 09-60625 \r\n \r\n At the same time, the overall approach of the \r\nreport remains similar to that taken in previous years. \r\nWhile we appreciate the report’s informative content, \r\nwe share the view of many delegations that it should \r\ncontain more substantive and analytical elements, not \r\njust a listing of meetings and decisions. \r\n We also reiterate the appeals of Member States \r\nfor greater transparency and accountability and broader \r\nparticipation by the general membership of the United \r\nNations in the work of the Council in order to enhance \r\nthe implementation of our responsibility to maintain \r\ninternational peace and security. \r\n Not much time has passed since the General \r\nAssembly adopted decision 62/557, which provided for \r\nthe launching of intergovernmental negotiations on a \r\nwhole set of questions related to an increase in the \r\nmembership of and improving the geographical \r\nrepresentation in the Security Council. It was a historic \r\nstep on the path towards reform of one of the principal \r\nUnited Nations organs. We highlight the commendable \r\nand useful work done by the Open-ended Working \r\nGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation on \r\nand Increase in the Membership of the Security \r\nCouncil and Other Matters Related to the Security \r\nCouncil. We also commend the detailed nature of the \r\nrelevant report of the Working Group, prepared under \r\nthe chairmanship of Ambassador Zahir Tanin of \r\nAfghanistan. \r\n We believe that, on the whole, the outcome of the \r\nthird round of intergovernmental negotiations on \r\nSecurity Council reform shows the unanimity of United \r\nNations Member States in understanding the need for \r\nCouncil reform to strengthen its efficiency, ensure \r\nequitable representation and improve the relationship \r\nbetween the Council and the General Assembly. \r\nNevertheless, we should analyze the results of the \r\nSeptember negotiations, which did not lead to a \r\ncommon approach with regard to an expansion of the \r\nCouncil and an increase in both its membership \r\ncategories. \r\n Kazakhstan once again reaffirms its commitment \r\nto reform of the United Nations, including, first and \r\nforemost, the Security Council, and clearly expresses \r\nits position on increasing the Council’s membership in \r\nboth the permanent and non-permanent categories in \r\norder to improve regional representation. For us, it \r\nwould be preferable to increase the number of Council \r\nmembers from 15 to 25 by adding six permanent and \r\nfour non-permanent seats. \r\n We believe that six new permanent Council \r\nmembers should be elected in accordance with the \r\nfollowing scheme: two from among the African States, \r\ntwo from Asia, one from Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean, and one from among the Western European \r\nand other States. In addition, four new non-permanent \r\nmembers should be elected as follows: one from \r\nAfrica, one from Asia, one from Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean and one from among the Eastern European \r\nStates. \r\n The current stage of the negotiation process \r\nrequires that we seek a new formula that would close \r\nthe gap between the view of the majority of the \r\nMember States, which favours an expansion in both \r\ncategories of Council membership, and the view of the \r\ngroup Uniting for Consensus, which insists on an \r\nexpansion in only the non-permanent membership \r\ncategory. It would probably be useful to know the \r\npreferences of Member States with regard to expanding \r\nthe permanent and non-permanent Council membership \r\ncategories. It makes sense to consider an intermediate \r\napproach thoroughly. But such an option should not be \r\naccepted as a starting point for a new round of \r\nnegotiations. We think that proper attention should be \r\ngiven to the compromise proposals put forward at the \r\nlast round of intergovernmental negotiations, which \r\ncalled for an intermediate model that would establish \r\nterms for mandatory review at a conference, with the \r\naim of examining new members in the intermediate \r\ncategory for promotion to the permanent category. \r\nMoreover, new permanent members should not be \r\npermitted to exercise a veto until a decision on \r\nextending the right of veto to them is made by the \r\nreview conference, which would review the \r\ncontribution of potential permanent members to \r\nstrengthening peace and security. \r\n It is clear that the decision process has proved \r\ntough and controversial, and that the potential threat of \r\ndeadlock still remains. In order to advance the \r\nnegotiation process, we think it would be useful to \r\nbegin discussing a paper that incorporates all the \r\nMember States’ proposals, without exception, to be \r\nprepared and introduced by the Open-ended Working \r\nGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation on \r\nand Increase in the Membership of the Security \r\nCouncil and Related Matters, headed by its Chair. In \r\nthe framework of ongoing negotiations not one \r\nA/64/PV.45  \r\n \r\n09-60625 12 \r\n \r\npresented position should be excluded a priori. We \r\nhope that the reform process will generate innovative \r\nideas that can lead to a compromise decision supported \r\nby the largest possible majority of Member States. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to reiterate the \r\nreadiness of Kazakhstan to take part in the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations with the rest of the \r\nMember States in a spirit of compromise and \r\ncooperation, aimed at reaching agreement on an entire \r\npackage of United Nations reform, with Security \r\nCouncil reform at its core. We also believe that the \r\nimprovement of the working methods of the Security \r\nCouncil should be considered another important aspect \r\nof reform, based on enhancing transparency and \r\naccountability. \r\n Ms. Štiglic (Slovenia): We appreciate today’s \r\nopportunity to discuss the report of the Security \r\nCouncil (A/64/2) and the question of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of \r\nthe Security Council and related matters. I would like \r\nto thank the current President of the Security Council, \r\nthe Permanent Representative of Austria, Ambassador \r\nMayr-Harting, for presenting to the General Assembly \r\nthe report of the Council for the period from 1 August \r\n2008 to 31 July 2009. It is evident that the reporting \r\nperiod featured an increasing workload and a wide \r\nrange of complex regional, thematic and general issues \r\nbefore the Council. \r\n I also wish to commend the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Afghanistan, Ambassador Tanin, for \r\nhis tremendous efforts and impartial leadership over \r\nthe past year, which have given the Security Council \r\nreform negotiations the boost they so urgently needed. \r\nThe reform of the Security Council is long overdue and \r\nis an essential part of overall reform of the United \r\nNations. It must address both enlargement of the \r\nmembership and improvement of its working methods. \r\nWe have already seen some progress; however, there is \r\nstill much room for improvement so that the Council \r\ncan fulfil its responsibilities for maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security in the most efficient \r\nand effective manner. \r\n Enlarging the Security Council is not only a \r\nmatter of fairness but a necessary condition for its \r\neffectiveness. The time is ripe for changes in the \r\nCouncil’s structure. A reformed Security Council must \r\nbetter reflect geopolitical realities and be more \r\nrepresentative, with its authority and legitimacy \r\nstrengthened. And, regardless of the size of the \r\nCouncil, we need to improve its working methods and \r\nits interaction with the membership of the United \r\nNations as a whole. We welcomed the open debate of \r\nthe Council held in August 2008 and the informal \r\ninteractive discussion with Member States on the \r\nreport on the work of the Security Council that took \r\nplace in July this year. \r\n For many years now, Members of the United \r\nNations have been confronted with an ever-increasing \r\nnumber of Security Council decisions, with notable \r\nsecurity, legal and financial implications for every \r\nMember State. If the Council expects Member States to \r\nbe real partners in sharing this burden, it should be \r\nready to be more transparent and inclusive and to \r\nengage with non-members of the Council on a more \r\nfrequent regular basis. We appreciate and support the \r\ninitiatives of the group of five small countries (S5) in \r\nthis regard. \r\n We welcome the appointment of the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Afghanistan, Ambassador Tanin, to \r\nfurther facilitate the process of Security Council \r\nreform. As many speakers before me have stressed, we \r\nhave had an interesting and productive debate and \r\nexchange of views on all five key issues of reform \r\nduring the last round of intergovernmental negotiations \r\nunder the able chairmanship of Ambassador Tanin. \r\n It is apparent that expanding the Security \r\nCouncil, with various types of both permanent and \r\nnon-permanent members, has gained broad support \r\namong Member States. Slovenia remains convinced \r\nthat the Council should be expanded in both categories \r\nof members. Particular attention should be paid to the \r\nrepresentation of countries from Africa and Latin \r\nAmerica, which have so far not been represented in the \r\npermanent membership category. The enlargement of \r\nthe Council should also increase the possibility for \r\nsmall and medium-size states to serve on it. Slovenia’s \r\nPresident, Mr. Danilo Türk, suggested a specific model \r\nfor Security Council expansion during the general \r\ndebate at the sixty-third session of the General \r\nAssembly. This and other specific proposals made in \r\nthe past need to be seriously examined. \r\n We must maintain the momentum generated and \r\nmove forward. We look forward to the presentation of \r\nthe work plan for the negotiations. It is clear that, \r\nwhile support for Security Council reform remains \r\nstrong, Member States’ positions on the issue still \r\n A/64/PV.45\r\n \r\n13 09-60625 \r\n \r\ndiverge. We therefore need to narrow our options and \r\nsearch for solutions that will garner the widest possible \r\nsupport among Member States. A paper prepared by the \r\nfacilitator would be helpful in this respect, and could \r\nserve as a useful basis for negotiations during the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s sixty-fourth session. \r\n Mrs. Aitimova (Kazakhstan), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n In conclusion, we must not fail to take forward \r\nthe process of negotiations on the question of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of \r\nthe Security Council. We are convinced, Mr. President, \r\nthat your leadership, guidance and wisdom, coupled \r\nwith the necessary political will, good faith and \r\nflexibility among Member States, will bring us to a \r\nsuccessful conclusion of the prolonged debates on the \r\nissue of Security Council reform. \r\n Mr. Menon (Singapore): By joining the report of \r\nthe Security Council (A/64/2) with the issue of \r\nSecurity Council reform, today’s debate can be seen as \r\nan assessment of the Council’s work, as well as of the \r\nareas that require improvement. Singapore commends \r\nthe Council for the preparation of a report that gives a \r\nfactual account of its activities from August 2008 to \r\nJuly 2009. We appreciate the efforts and challenges \r\nthat have gone into the preparation of these annual \r\nreports, and we welcome a number of qualitative \r\nimprovements to the report’s expanded introductory \r\nsection. \r\n However, we believe that more can be done to \r\nimprove the report’s substance and clarity. Rather than \r\nsimply putting a positive spin on the work of the \r\nSecurity Council, the report would have been more \r\nuseful if it had given more specifics in the record of the \r\nyear’s achievements, as well as the lack thereof. We \r\nwould also suggest that care be taken not to confuse \r\nquality with quantity. Drafters of future reports should \r\nexercise vigilance to ensure that all information added \r\nto the document is substantive, and that the report is \r\nnot expanded for its own sake. \r\n While Singapore, along with numerous other \r\ndelegations, would have preferred a more analytical \r\nreport, we note the reasons shared by Security Council \r\nmembers, in formal and informal settings, for the \r\nproblems inherent in producing an analytical work. \r\nStill, we urge Council members to continue trying, \r\nsince it does not matter if progress is slow as long as \r\nyou do not stop. We would also suggest that, if the \r\nCouncil is unable to produce a collective analysis of its \r\nwork, its 15 members can perhaps reflect on the work \r\nof the past year and share their assessments with the \r\nGeneral Assembly. For example, why are some legacy \r\nresolutions adopted year after year without any \r\napparent progress? In addition, I am sure that the \r\nAssembly would be interested in what the Council \r\nmembers see as their priorities and strategies for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. Such \r\nindividual national assessments could be included in \r\nthe annual report of the Security Council. \r\n That brings me to my next point — the need for \r\nmuch more to be done to improve the level and quality \r\nof dialogue between the Security Council and the \r\nGeneral Assembly. The Security Council was created \r\nas a body of action, but it is not an autonomous organ, \r\nbeholden to no one. The Council and the Assembly \r\nexist in dynamic symbiosis, with the Assembly \r\nconferring on the Council its legitimacy and authority. \r\nThis relationship thrives when the two bodies have \r\nregular, frank and candid dialogue; it shrivels when \r\ninteraction is choked off or kept at arm’s length. \r\nWorse, either side’s refusal to engage with the other \r\nbreeds suspicion and distrust, which complicates the \r\ntask of keeping the peace. \r\n In this connection, we welcome the initiative \r\nundertaken by Viet Nam last year to engage in an \r\ninformal dialogue with United Nations Member States \r\nbefore it prepared the report of the Security Council. \r\nWe note that Uganda, which drafted this year’s report, \r\nalso took the wise step of holding an informal dialogue \r\nwith United Nations Member States, and we urge all \r\npresidents of the Security Council in the month in \r\nwhich the report is being prepared to continue this \r\npractice. \r\n My preceding comments and suggestions are \r\nlinked to the broader issue of Security Council reform. \r\nIt is a sorry truth that real progress on reform, in all \r\nareas, remains difficult given the divergence in views \r\nand aspirations of United Nations Member States. The \r\nexpansion of the Council, the question of \r\nrepresentation, the veto and working methods were all \r\nhotly debated in three rounds of intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations in the previous session, but deep divisions \r\nremain. Member States will be aware that Singapore \r\nhas consistently supported an expansion of the Security \r\nCouncil in both its permanent and non-permanent \r\ncategories. Nevertheless, much was said by other \r\ndelegations about the option of creating a new category \r\nA/64/PV.45  \r\n \r\n09-60625 14 \r\n \r\nof intermediate seats, but few concrete details were \r\noffered. We need to continue with the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations.  \r\n In addition, Singapore has, together with the rest \r\nof the group of five small nations (S-5), promoted a \r\nnumber of proposals since 2005 on improving the \r\nCouncil’s working methods. The S-5 submitted draft \r\nresolution A/60/L.49 in March 2006 and, more \r\nrecently, in April 2009 circulated a non-paper entitled \r\n“Elements for reflection”, both of which contained \r\nsuggestions to improve the Council’s working methods. \r\nThe S-5 members share the common belief that the \r\nworking methods of the Council should be an integral \r\nfocus of its overall reform. Better working methods \r\ncould improve the Council’s efficiency, make it more \r\ntransparent to the wider membership, enhance its \r\nlegitimacy and strengthen its role as the body entrusted \r\nwith the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity. \r\n Singapore is firm in its belief that the reform of \r\nthe Security Council is necessary and overdue and that \r\nthe change must come if the Council hopes to stay \r\nrelevant in our evolving global environment. We call \r\nupon the permanent members of the Security Council \r\nin particular to exercise leadership and work closely \r\nwith the General Assembly on this endeavour. \r\nMembership in the Security Council comes with \r\nspecial responsibilities and this is a price that its \r\nmembers, especially the permanent five, must be \r\nwilling to pay. If the Council wants to truthfully say, as \r\nit does in the first sentence of its report, that it has \r\ndischarged its duties, then reform is needed, and \r\nneeded urgently.  \r\n It is in all our interests to keep the Security \r\nCouncil — and by extension the United Nations — \r\nrelevant, because it is not written in stone that this \r\nhouse will remain the sole organization of recourse for \r\nthe poor and the persecuted. Alternative groupings, \r\nsupposedly reflecting today’s geopolitical realities, \r\nappear to be taking root and moving to address some of \r\nthe same issues that the Security Council deals with. \r\nAs responsible stakeholders in this body, let us prevent \r\nthe devolution of authority from the United Nations by \r\nworking to strengthen the effectiveness, transparency \r\nand legitimacy of this principal organ. \r\n Mr. Cuello Camilo (Dominican Republic) (spoke \r\nin Spanish): At the outset, I would like to convey our \r\ngratitude to the President of the Security Council for \r\nthe month of November, Mr. Thomas Mayr-Harting of \r\nAustria, for his comprehensive introduction of the \r\nannual report of the Security Council to the General \r\nAssembly (A/64/2). We also congratulate the \r\nPermanent Representative of Afghanistan, Mr. Zahir \r\nTanin, who led the intergovernmental negotiations for \r\nthe reform of the Security Council, for his leadership \r\nand spirit of compromise in the conduct of the entire \r\nprocess. We also take this opportunity to congratulate \r\nhim on having been appointed by the new President of \r\nthe General Assembly to continue leading the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations during the sixty-fourth \r\nsession. \r\n In the period under review, the Security Council \r\ncertainly continued its careful consideration of \r\nsituations in certain specific countries and regions. It \r\nalso took up the subject of nuclear disarmament and \r\nnon-proliferation with new vigour, a course of action \r\nthat we will support until the world is rid once and for \r\nall of nuclear weapons, the altogether unnecessary \r\nlegacy of the cold war.  \r\n Nevertheless, we are of the opinion that it is \r\nfundamental for the United Nations that the Security \r\nCouncil adapt to present realities. Our focus in this \r\nmatter is based on a very specific event: the coup d’état \r\nin Honduras. It is indeed sad that, in the face of the \r\ninadmissible overthrow of the democratic political \r\nsystem of a prominent State Member of the United \r\nNations, the Security Council has not taken rapid and \r\ndetermined steps to restore the democratic and \r\nconstitutional order of our brother country, Honduras. \r\nIn that regard, the President of the Dominican \r\nRepublic, Mr. Leonel Fernández Reyna, has raised the \r\nquestion of the inability of both the Organization of \r\nAmerican States and the United Nations, after five \r\nmonths time, to restore constitutional order in \r\nHonduras. The reason is clear. The Security Council \r\nhas not spoken on the issue.  \r\n The Security Council is very familiar with the \r\nexperience of Africa, which is quite illustrative in this \r\ncontext. Many of the root causes of conflicts generated \r\nin that brother region are linked to political frustration, \r\nhumiliation and disregard for constitutional norms and \r\nfor the Africans themselves. That has been a fertile \r\nbreeding ground for the violence, crises and conflicts \r\nthat continue to plague the African continent. \r\n The Security Council is the only organ of the \r\nUnited Nations whose decisions and resolutions are \r\n A/64/PV.45\r\n \r\n15 09-60625 \r\n \r\nbinding on all Member States. It is also the organ \r\nentrusted with the responsibility of maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security. The Dominican \r\nRepublic therefore believes that the members of the \r\nSecurity Council have the obligation to fulfil their \r\ncompelling and absolute responsibility to restore \r\ndemocratic order, respect for constitutional principles \r\nand political stability in Honduras. That is the only \r\nway to avoid the recurrence of anti-democratic efforts \r\nin Latin America and the Caribbean, which once again \r\npose an imminent threat to the lives and security of our \r\ncitizens. \r\n Regarding the reform of the Security Council, the \r\nDominican Republic regrets the slow progress of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations and the lack of \r\nsubstantial results. However, we still hold the hope that \r\none day we will see the reform of that organ so crucial \r\nto the United Nations system. In our view, any reform \r\nof the Security Council must aim to increase both its \r\nlegitimacy and its effectiveness. Consequently, the \r\nDominican Republic supports the increase in the \r\nnumber of members of the Council in both \r\ncategories — permanent and non-permanent members. \r\n However, if the reform process is not to be \r\novershadowed by the issue of the veto, the Dominican \r\nRepublic believes that this matter should be discussed \r\nat a review conference of the Charter to be held within \r\n10 years. We believe that Security Council reform \r\nshould also cover its methods of work, increase its \r\ntransparency and promote its accountability. \r\n We also believe that a satisfactory relationship \r\nbetween the General Assembly and the Security \r\nCouncil is fundamental, because relations between \r\nthese two important organs of the United Nations \r\nsystem should not be confined to the periodic issuance \r\nof update reports. The General Assembly must \r\nparticipate and engage in more meaningful and active \r\ndialogue with the Security Council in order to ensure \r\ngreater transparency, representativity, efficiency and \r\nlegitimacy.  \r\n We see no justification whatsoever for the \r\nperpetuation of the current outdated representation on \r\nthe Security Council whereby the countries of Africa, \r\nAsia, Latin America and the Caribbean have been \r\nmarginalized. We advocate the position that Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean should enjoy equal footing \r\nwith other regions when the number of seats of the \r\nSecurity Council is increased. We support the position \r\nthat the Security Council can truly become more \r\nrepresentative only by ensuring the inclusion of \r\nrepresentatives of developing countries. \r\n The aim of this debate is to ensure that the \r\nSecurity Council is better able to respond to the \r\nrealities of the world in which we live. It is essential \r\nthat we adapt the representation on and the functions of \r\nthe Security Council to the new realities of the twenty-\r\nfirst century. It is necessary to give the Security \r\nCouncil enhanced capacity to address prevailing \r\nchallenges effectively and to better carry out its role in \r\nresolving crisis situations. The Dominican Republic is \r\nconvinced that we still have time to develop the \r\nnecessary political will to achieve genuine commitment \r\nto making tangible progress on these important issues. \r\n Mr. Wolfe (Jamaica): At the outset, Jamaica \r\naligns itself with the statements delivered by the \r\nPermanent Representative of Egypt, in his capacity as \r\nChair of the Non-Aligned Movement, and, of course, \r\nby the representative of Barbados on behalf of the \r\nCaribbean Community. Permit me also to express my \r\nappreciation to Ambassador Thomas Mayr-Harting, \r\nPermanent Representative of Austria and President of \r\nthe Security Council for the month of November, for \r\nhaving introduced the report of the Security Council \r\n(A/64/2). \r\n Additionally, I take this opportunity to express \r\nsincere gratitude to Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann, \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-third \r\nsession, for his invaluable contribution to advancing \r\nthe work on what we agree to be a most protracted \r\nissue — reform of the Security Council. \r\n In that regard, I also commend Ambassador Zahir \r\nTanin, Permanent Representative of Afghanistan, who \r\nserved as chair, for his astute guidance of the \r\nintergovernmental process during the sixty-third \r\nsession, and we express every confidence that his \r\nreappointment as chair during this sixty-fourth session \r\nwill contribute to taking us much closer to a \r\nsatisfactory outcome. \r\n Charged with the responsibility of maintaining \r\nand countering threats to international peace and \r\nsecurity, the Security Council remains an essential \r\npillar of the entire United Nations system. Its work is \r\nof tremendous importance to all of us. Its decisions \r\nimpact on our daily lives across all corners of the \r\nglobe. Member States therefore expect that, consistent \r\nwith Article 24 of the Charter, the Security Council, in \r\nA/64/PV.45  \r\n \r\n09-60625 16 \r\n \r\nthe solemn discharge of its responsibilities, will \r\nendeavour to ensure that actions taken on behalf of the \r\nmembership of the United Nations conform strictly \r\nwith the purposes and principles of the Charter. Of \r\ncourse, we are all aware that Article 24 also stipulates \r\nthe need for an annual report. \r\n The report we have before us is, as in previous \r\nyears, essentially an extensive compilation of the work \r\nof the Security Council over the reporting period, in \r\nthis case from 1 August 2008 to 31 July 2009. Jamaica \r\nmaintains that the annual report of the Security Council \r\nshould contain a high level of qualitative and analytical \r\ncontent in assessing the work of the Council, including \r\nsuch cases in which the Council fails to act, as well as \r\ncontaining the views expressed by its members during \r\nthe consideration of agenda items. The continued \r\nabsence of a methodical and systematic diagnosis of \r\nthe work of the Council in its annual report to this \r\nAssembly remains symptomatic of its much outdated \r\nand discredited working methods, which the majority \r\nof Member States continue to deplore. \r\n My delegation also welcomes the debate on the \r\nquestion of equitable representation on and increase in \r\nthe membership of the Security Council and other \r\nmatters related to the Security Council. We recall that, \r\naround this time last year, we were compelled to use \r\nthe opportunity of this debate to call for a \r\nconsolidation of the gains made with the adoption of \r\nthe landmark decision 62/557 on 15 September 2008. \r\nThis was based on our strong view that the crucial task \r\nfor the General Assembly was to move forward in \r\nearnest to facilitate the commencement of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. \r\n Unquestionably, decision 62/557 guided us in the \r\nright direction, towards the commencement of the \r\nnegotiating process, which is currently under way and, \r\nwe hope, has steered us away from the cycle of endless \r\nconsultations and the repetition of established positions \r\nwhich had characterized the deliberations of the Open-\r\nended Working Group for the past 15 years. \r\n We have been very encouraged by the efforts of \r\nthe chair of the intergovernmental process, in particular \r\nin focusing attention on the level of progress achieved \r\nin the three rounds of negotiations that have been held \r\nto date. Jamaica also welcomes the oral decision \r\nadopted by the General Assembly at its meeting on \r\n14 September 2009, by which it agreed  \r\n “to immediately continue intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform in \r\ninformal plenary of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-fourth session as mandated by General \r\nAssembly decision 62/557, building on the \r\nprogress achieved during its sixty-third session, \r\nas well as the positions of and proposals made by \r\nMember States” (A/63/PV.105, p. 8).  \r\nWe therefore anticipate that the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations will resume at the earliest possible \r\nopportunity. \r\n As noted in the letter of the chair of the \r\nintergovernmental process dated 16 July 2009,  \r\n “it was argued on the one hand that the third \r\nround should revolve around what has \r\ncommanded the most support from delegations \r\nspeaking up during the meetings so far, namely \r\nthe model with an expansion in both current \r\ncategories including its different varieties, and on \r\nthe other hand around what needs to be further \r\nexplored, namely the intermediate model \r\nincluding its different varieties”.  \r\nIt was clear then and it is even more so now that a vast \r\nmajority of delegations supports expansion in both \r\ncategories and that, therefore, it is not necessary to \r\ndelay the process by seeking further clarification on the \r\nintermediate model. \r\n Jamaica continues to strongly support the \r\nposition that expansion in both the permanent and \r\nnon-permanent categories would be a far more \r\ndemocratic and inclusive means of addressing the \r\nquestion of equitable representation on and increase in \r\nthe membership of the Security Council, in keeping \r\nwith contemporary realities. \r\n It is also important to note, as we pointed out \r\nthen and note again now, that, in statements made by \r\npermanent members of the Security Council, which \r\nwould normally be considered most resistant to the \r\nidea of change, there has been a general acceptance of \r\nthe need for expansion in the permanent category as a \r\nmeans of making the Council more inclusive and \r\nrepresentative. The permanent members should \r\ntherefore be held to these commitments. \r\n Finally, Jamaica continues to reiterate its call for \r\na compilation document containing the proposals and \r\npositions of all Member States as the basis for \r\nconducting open, inclusive and transparent \r\n A/64/PV.45\r\n \r\n17 09-60625 \r\n \r\nnegotiations in a very focused, constructive and orderly \r\nmanner. We believe that this is the best way to advance \r\nthe intergovernmental process if we are to avoid the \r\nperpetual cycle of repeated positions and proposals of \r\nMember States, which are already well known among \r\nus and will only serve to dampen enthusiasm and put \r\nthe brakes on the momentum generated over the past \r\nfew sessions. \r\n Mr. Schaper (Netherlands): Sixty-four years ago, \r\nthe General Assembly elected my country, the \r\nNetherlands, one of the first non-permanent members \r\nof the newly established Security Council. In its first \r\nyear, the young Council adopted 15 resolutions. Over \r\nthe past year, as we can read in the report before us \r\ntoday (A/64/2), it produced 53 resolutions, along with \r\n43 presidential and 35 press statements. \r\n These figures are an expression of how the role of \r\nthe Security Council in the exercise of its primary \r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security has expanded over the years, \r\nparticularly since the end of the cold war two decades \r\nago. All the while, the Security Council has acted on \r\nbehalf of all the Members of the United Nations. It is \r\ntherefore a matter of legitimate concern to the entire \r\nmembership that the composition of the Council \r\nappropriately reflect present-day international realities. \r\n In the discussion of the enlargement of the \r\nCouncil, we should, in the view of the Netherlands, be \r\nguided by the criteria laid down in Article 23 of the \r\nCharter, particularly those concerning the contribution \r\nto the maintenance of international peace and security, \r\nand equitable geographical distribution. Speaking of \r\nthe composition of the Council, in our view the \r\ncontribution to international peace and security is a \r\ncriterion that could already be taken more into account \r\nwhen electing non-permanent members under the \r\npresent system. \r\n For more than 15 years now, the General \r\nAssembly has been discussing Security Council \r\nreform. Against that background, the progress made \r\nduring the sixty-third session was no mean feat. We \r\nmoved from endless deliberation to intensive \r\nnegotiation, leaving behind the Open-ended Working \r\nGroup — which was already nicknamed the never-\r\nending working group — and taking the matter to the \r\nGeneral Assembly itself. Hopefully we can maintain \r\nthis momentum in the coming year; the Netherlands \r\nwill actively contribute to this objective.  \r\n At the 2005 Summit, world leaders expressed \r\ntheir support for early reform of the Council. Staying \r\non course for this early reform requires first of all the \r\nimmediate resumption of the negotiation process, as \r\nAssembly decision 63/565 stipulates. We look forward \r\nto receiving the chair’s letter on the fourth round \r\nfollowing the conclusion of this debate. \r\n A month ago, we were happy to learn that \r\nAmbassador Tanin will once again be chairing our \r\nmeetings. Not only was he instrumental in the \r\nsuccessful launch of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, but also one simply does not change \r\nhorses in midstream. Always impartial to any of the \r\npositions, yet partial to progress, Ambassador Tanin \r\nhas established a legitimate and smooth process — a \r\nprocess we can build on. \r\n After we have looked at all the five key issues \r\nfrom all possible angles, the next logical step in the \r\nprocess would now seem to be a text that can provide a \r\nbasis for negotiation. We have no fixed position on \r\nhow such a text can best come about. Nevertheless, it \r\nis our view that at the current stage we cannot in all \r\nfairness ask Ambassador Tanin to take on this \r\nextremely sensitive task. It is now up to us, Member \r\nStates, to pick up this gauntlet. \r\n As far as substance is concerned, I would like to \r\nquote one of the main conclusions from the \r\n2007 facilitators’ report, to which the Netherlands \r\ncontributed: “The positions of the major interest \r\ngroups, well known to the membership for some time, \r\nare not likely to be fully realized at this stage” \r\n(A/61/47, annex I, part II). In our mind, this conclusion \r\nstill holds true. The main contender to break the \r\npresent logjam, we believe, is currently what is known \r\nas the intermediate approach.  \r\n Although it goes by different names, we all know \r\nwhat is basically being discussed here. This inventive \r\nsolution continues to raise questions in certain \r\nquarters; however, those will not be answered within \r\nthe context of more plenary meetings with general \r\nstatements. Only by putting pen to paper, while jointly \r\ndrafting the negotiating text that I mentioned earlier, \r\nwill we really be able to untie all the knots and to map \r\nout in a clear manner the different variants. \r\n I know that some delegations accept the \r\nintermediate model exclusively as a potential outcome \r\nand not as a point of departure. I say it does not need to \r\nbe a point of departure. Nevertheless, for it to be a \r\nA/64/PV.45  \r\n \r\n09-60625 18 \r\n \r\npotential outcome of the negotiations, it needs at least \r\nto be on the map as a point of interest. In our \r\nnegotiating text, we do not have to award it some \r\nspecial status, but it does deserve some status. The only \r\nalternative to really exploring new and inventive \r\nsolutions, such as for example the intermediate \r\napproach, is the status quo — and we all solemnly \r\ndeclare that we want to move beyond that. Such \r\ndeclarations create obligations, for subsequently doing \r\nnothing leads only to the conclusion that the United \r\nNations is broken but incapable of repairing itself — \r\nthe worst possible outcome for us all. \r\n Mr. Wolff (United States of America): I would \r\nlike to thank the President of the Security Council for \r\nthe month of November, Ambassador Mayr-Harting, \r\nfor his introduction yesterday of the Council’s annual \r\nreport to the General Assembly (A/64/2), as required \r\nunder United Nations Charter Articles 15 and 24; and \r\nAmbassador Rugunda and the Ugandan delegation for \r\ntheir preparation of the annual report during their \r\npresidency of the Security Council in July. \r\n The annual report provides non-Council members \r\nwith a transparent and comprehensive review of the \r\nintensive work of the Security Council. We hope the \r\nreport does indeed facilitate the exchange of \r\ninformation and enhance cooperation between these \r\ntwo principal organs of the United Nations. The United \r\nStates takes seriously the importance of making sure \r\nthat all Member States are informed of and \r\nappropriately involved in the Council’s work. \r\n There has been an ongoing effort to hold more \r\nformal meetings of the Council, open to the full \r\nmembership, as the report highlights. There were \r\n219 such meetings between August 2007 and July \r\n2008 and 228 meetings between August 2008 and July \r\n2009. Regrettably, however, these meetings are not \r\nalways attended by more than a small percentage of \r\nMember States, including this very morning. We hope \r\nthat more members will avail themselves of the \r\nopportunity to follow the Council’s work first-hand on \r\nsuch occasions rather than relying primarily on an \r\nannual report. To those non-Council members that \r\ncannot follow the Council’s work on a regular basis, I \r\ncommend the Council’s website, with its wealth of \r\ninformation and meeting summaries, for further in-\r\ndepth reference. \r\n Turning to our other topic today, we welcomed \r\nthe President’s letter of 13 October announcing his \r\nappointment of Ambassador Tanin to chair the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on his behalf. We \r\npledge our full support of Ambassador Tanin’s efforts \r\nto lead forward the informal plenary of the General \r\nAssembly in productive intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. As we stated during the first three rounds \r\nof these negotiations and will continue to elaborate in \r\nmore detail in those negotiations, the United States \r\nsupports expansion of the Security Council. Such \r\nexpansion, however, should diminish neither the \r\nCouncil’s effectiveness nor its efficiency. Let me \r\nbriefly summarize key elements of my Government’s \r\nposition. \r\n The United States is open in principle to a limited \r\nexpansion of both permanent and non-permanent \r\nmembers. In terms of categories of membership, the \r\nUnited States strongly believes that any consideration \r\nof an expansion of permanent members must be \r\ncountry-specific in nature. In determining which \r\ncountries merit permanent membership, we will take \r\ninto account the ability of countries to contribute to the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security and \r\nother purposes of the United Nations.  \r\n As we have previously stated, the United States is \r\nnot open to an enlargement of the Security Council by \r\na Charter amendment that changes the current veto \r\nstructure. To enhance the prospects for success, \r\nwhatever formula emerges for an expansion of Council \r\nmembership should have in mind Charter requirements \r\nfor ratification.  \r\n We remain committed to a serious, deliberate \r\neffort, working with other Member States, to find a \r\nway forward that both adapts the Security Council to \r\ncurrent global realities and enhances its ability to carry \r\nout its mandate and effectively meet the challenges of \r\nthe new century. \r\n Mr. Argüello (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): We \r\nshould like to express our views on the annual report of \r\nthe Security Council (A/64/2) and then address the \r\nstatus of the reform process of that body. We thank the \r\ndelegation of Uganda for the consultations it convened \r\non this subject and the briefings it organized for the \r\nreport’s submission during its chairmanship. I also \r\nthank the Permanent Representative of Austria for \r\npresenting the report yesterday.  \r\n Once again, we underscore our concern over the \r\ncontinuation and intensification of intra-State conflicts, \r\nintertribal violence and conflicts over natural resources \r\n A/64/PV.45\r\n \r\n19 09-60625 \r\n \r\nthat occur in areas where there is a lack of \r\nsocioeconomic development, resulting in institutional \r\nand political fragility. The truly tragic situations in the \r\nSudan and Somalia are examples of this. In turn, the \r\nnumber of terrorist attacks is once again on the \r\nincrease in a number of countries, and every day we \r\nwitness more bloody acts resulting in an ever-\r\nincreasing number of civilian casualties.  \r\n As former Secretary-General Kofi Annan stated, \r\nthese terrorist acts are by their very nature an assault \r\non the fundamental principles of law, order, human \r\nrights and the peaceful settlement of disputes — the \r\nprinciples upon which this Organization rests. In \r\naddition to the statements of condemnation issued by \r\nthe Security Council, which are already perceived as \r\nbanal, given their quasi-bureaucratic repetitiveness, the \r\nSecurity Council will need to decide which political \r\ncourse of action it should take, working jointly with the \r\nGeneral Assembly, to effectively combat, in a \r\nmultilateral and coordinated manner, the scourge of \r\nterrorism that affects all States equally.  \r\n We support the efforts of the Council to prevent \r\nthe recurrence of genocide, ethnic cleansing and crimes \r\nagainst humanity. The international community is \r\nresponsible for protecting civilian populations when \r\nthe State that is obliged to do so is unwilling or unable \r\nto meet its obligations. Furthermore, conflicts between \r\nStates call for new efforts to attain peace in the context \r\nof international and humanitarian law. In this regard, \r\nwe call on the parties to the Middle East conflict to \r\nmake substantial progress towards finding a just and \r\nlegitimate solution within the legal framework \r\nestablished by the relevant resolutions of the Security \r\nCouncil. \r\n I wish to express my Government’s satisfaction at \r\nthe Security Council’s adoption of resolution \r\n1892 (2009), extending the mandate of the United \r\nNations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). I \r\nalso underscore the many sponsors of that resolution \r\nand the active participation of the Group of Friends of \r\nHaiti. We trust that implementing the mandate of \r\nMINUSTAH to ensure a stable environment will help \r\nto create the conditions necessary for the full \r\nrealization of that country’s economic and social \r\ndevelopment goals. \r\n Before proceeding to comment on the subject of \r\nreform, I would like to express my country’s gratitude \r\nfor the historic resolution 1887 (2009) on disarmament \r\nand non-proliferation, which will promote further \r\nprogress towards achieving a safer world free from \r\nnuclear weapons. This is how the Council can and \r\nshould show leadership and prevent the loss of its \r\nrelevance and legitimacy, a growing trend in recent \r\nyears that we hope will be reversed in this new era of \r\ninternational relations through the adoption of that \r\nresolution.  \r\n In this regard, the reform of the Security Council \r\nis of particular relevance and high priority, as the \r\nchallenges to international peace and security are \r\nincreasingly grave. The crisis of relevance within the \r\nOrganization is due first and foremost to the extent to \r\nwhich the Security Council has lost its representative \r\nnature and been circumvented in its active management \r\nof threats and violations of international peace and \r\nsecurity.  \r\n Argentina is firmly committed to achieving a \r\ncomprehensive reform aimed at making the Security \r\nCouncil a more representative, transparent, inclusive, \r\ndemocratic and effective body that not only reflects the \r\ndynamics of today’s world but, through its structure \r\nand functioning, is also prepared to adapt to future \r\nchanges or transformations in the international scene. \r\nThis goal will be reached only through a reform that is \r\nguided by the principles of inclusiveness and \r\nresponsible accountability, which cannot be reconciled \r\nwith the expansion of the number of permanent \r\nmembers.  \r\n The priority is to achieve a more representative \r\nCouncil, rectifying the lack of representation of a \r\nnumber of regions, such as Africa, Latin America and \r\nthe Caribbean and Asia, and of developing countries. \r\nThis will also require ensuring that all Member States, \r\nincluding small and medium-sized States, have an \r\nopportunity to serve on the Security Council and thus \r\nmake a more direct contribution to international peace \r\nand security.  \r\n As we have said, there is a need for \r\ncomprehensive reform that is not limited to an increase \r\nthe number of Council members. While expansion is \r\nimportant, it is not the only component of democratic \r\nand lasting reform. The issue of the Council’s working \r\nmethods is also crucial to enhancing the effectiveness \r\nand transparency of its decision-making processes. \r\nAnother issue that the reform must address is the \r\nCouncil’s relationship with the General Assembly, the \r\nA/64/PV.45  \r\n \r\n09-60625 20 \r\n \r\nonly universal body in which all Member States are \r\nrepresented. \r\n The broadest support is essential to achieving \r\nprogress in working towards a successful reform. Only \r\nthrough an inclusive process that addresses the \r\ninterests of all and enjoys the support of all Member \r\nStates will we achieve a reform with the legitimacy \r\nnecessary to strengthen the Security Council and make \r\nit more credible and effective.  \r\n To enhance its legitimacy, the Security Council \r\nmust become more democratic. We believe that the \r\ndemocratization process will be viable only through an \r\nincrease in the number of non-permanent Council \r\nmembers. Pursuing the democratization of the Security \r\nCouncil by increasing the number of permanent seats, \r\nthereby swelling the ranks of the privileged, is \r\ncontradictory. Democracy is based on the idea of and \r\ncapacity for representation, and the category of \r\npermanent membership is not based on the concept of \r\ndemocratic representation but is the outcome of a \r\nparticular moment in history. Only a process of regular \r\nelections in the regional context, with adequate \r\naccountability and a system of rotation, will guarantee \r\ntrue representation for members. \r\n In the spirit of seeking a broad, negotiated \r\nsolution, Argentina welcomed the detailed exchange of \r\nviews during the third round of intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations in order to explore an intermediate \r\nsolution, which has the potential to offer a compromise \r\nbetween the positions held by the various groups. We \r\nare ready and keen to continue in a constructive \r\nprocess, exploring the various options that may \r\nconstitute a genuine compromise solution that is lasting \r\nand not subject to any revision process. \r\n Mr. McNee (Canada): I thank the President for \r\nconvening this important meeting. Canada welcomes \r\nthis opportunity to share our views on the annual report \r\nof the Security Council and also to return to the \r\nimportant issue of Security Council reform. \r\n The report of the Security Council (A/64/2) \r\nmakes it clear that the complexity, variety and volume \r\nof Security Council business continue to expand at a \r\ndramatic pace. During the past year, the Council has \r\ntaken important decisions on peace support operations \r\nin situations as varied as Haiti, Afghanistan and Sudan. \r\nIn addition to taking decisions on specific peace \r\noperations, the Council has also started a more general \r\nreview of peacekeeping issues — an undertaking which \r\nCanada strongly supports. Canada is particularly \r\nencouraged by the commitment to improve \r\nconsultations with troop- and police-contributing \r\ncountries, and hopes that concrete proposals to follow \r\nup on that commitment will be forthcoming shortly. \r\n One particular area where consultations need to \r\nbe improved is mandate generation. Although the \r\nSecurity Council is responsible for designing the \r\nmandates, they are of importance to all Member States. \r\nFor that reason Canada is hosting a series of policy \r\ndiscussions with all Member States on improving \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping. The focus of the third \r\nevent of our series, which will be held on 4 December, \r\nis on the issue of mandates and modalities. We are very \r\nfortunate that Ambassador Lakhdar Brahimi and \r\nLieutenant General Obiakor have both agreed to join us \r\nfor that event, and we look forward to an informative \r\nand productive exchange. \r\n Canada is also encouraged that the Council has \r\nbegun to work more closely with the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission in post-conflict settings. I have the honour \r\nto chair the Sierra Leone configuration and have seen \r\nfirst-hand the valuable and innovative work of the \r\nIntegrated Peacebuilding Office in Sierra Leone. That \r\nmodel offers great promise for better managing the \r\ntransition from crisis to peacebuilding in an integrated \r\nand efficient manner. I would therefore encourage the \r\nCouncil to engage even further with the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission in the year to come. \r\n While the report of the Security Council details \r\nthe scope of the actions taken by the Council, it still \r\nfails to provide an analysis of how and why those \r\ndecisions were made. Although producing such a report \r\nmay be difficult, it would be a tangible step towards \r\nimproving both the Council’s transparency and its \r\naccountability to the broader membership. \r\n Transforming the report in that manner could be \r\npart of the follow-up to the open debate on the working \r\nmethods of the Security Council held in August \r\n2008 (see S/PV.5968 and S/PV.5968 (Resumption 1)). \r\nThat was an important and long-overdue event. It is \r\ndisappointing that the Council has yet to follow up on \r\nthose deliberations. Canada would therefore like to \r\nreiterate the request made during that debate that the \r\nWorking Group on Council Documentation be \r\nmandated to undertake a comprehensive review of the \r\nnote by the president contained in S/2006/507 and to \r\npresent its findings to the Council as soon as possible. \r\n A/64/PV.45\r\n \r\n21 09-60625 \r\n \r\n Last year the membership took an important \r\ndecision to launch intergovernmental negotiations on a \r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council. After \r\nthree rounds of negotiation, today is an opportune \r\nmoment to reflect on what has been accomplished thus \r\nfar, and how we should focus the negotiations to ensure \r\nprogress during this session of the General Assembly. \r\n The negotiations to date have shown the many \r\nareas of convergence among Member States. There is \r\nbroad agreement on the need for an increase in the size \r\nof the Council, while keeping in mind the need to \r\nensure that the Council remains effective. There is also \r\noverwhelming support for improved working methods \r\nin the Council and some restraint on the use of the \r\nveto. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n However, there remains serious disagreement on \r\nthe issue of categories of membership. The position of \r\nCanada on that issue is well known. Security Council \r\nreform cannot be effective if it consists only of \r\nextending the privileges enjoyed by some and adding \r\npermanent seats for others. Canada therefore supports a \r\nmodest increase in the number of elected \r\nnon-permanent members, which would allow for better \r\nrepresentation of regions of the world, in particular \r\nunder-represented regions such as Africa. Such a \r\nstrategy would preserve the important oversight role of \r\nthe broader membership, better reflect the reality of the \r\ntwenty-first century and increase the proportion of \r\nelected members in the Council and the opportunities \r\nfor small- and medium-sized States to serve on the \r\nCouncil. \r\n However, the debate over the past year has shown \r\nthat the membership remains deeply divided on that \r\nimportant issue and that that proposal has nothing like \r\nthe support necessary for its adoption. That is why \r\nCanada supported the decision to hold a separate \r\ndebate on intermediate options. Reforming the Security \r\nCouncil by adding seats and extending mandates would \r\nsatisfy the need to recognize the special contributions \r\nmade by certain Member States while also maintaining \r\nthe Council’s necessary accountability to the broader \r\nmembership and ensuring that small- and medium-\r\nsized States may serve on the Council. \r\n There are still many details to be considered. \r\nHowever, for now, further exploration of the \r\nintermediate option offers the best chance to overcome \r\nthe current stalemate. In order to achieve real progress \r\non Security Council reform, all delegations must be \r\nwilling to put aside their own preferred options and \r\nengage in serious negotiations aimed at a compromise \r\nsolution. \r\n Mr. Vitrenko (Ukraine): At the outset let me \r\nexpress our gratitude to the President of the Security \r\nCouncil for the month of November, the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Austria, for his presentation of the \r\nannual report of the Security Council (A/64/2) to the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n The Ukraine welcomes the measures taken by the \r\nSecurity Council in recent years to increase its \r\nopenness to non-members. Efforts to take further steps \r\nin that positive direction should be encouraged. We \r\nalso support a greater role for the troop-contributing \r\ncountries in shaping and modifying of mandates of \r\npeacekeeping operations. \r\n We encourage the permanent and non-permanent \r\nCouncil members to find compromises on the difficult \r\nissues facing the United Nations today, such as \r\nterrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction, the stabilization of the situations in Iraq, \r\nAfghanistan, Darfur and other areas. However, on a \r\nfew critical occasions the Council failed to react \r\nadequately to serious challenges that directly \r\nthreatened international peace and security. \r\nUnfortunately, it has been unable to come up with a \r\ncommon position on topics like Georgia and Gaza.  \r\n Meanwhile, it is clear that demand is growing for \r\nUnited Nations participation in conflict prevention, \r\nmediation, peacekeeping and peacebuilding. To \r\nadequately address those and other challenges the \r\nworld needs a modernized Council. \r\n We are confident that the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil is an issue of exceptional international \r\nsignificance. Making that body more representative \r\nand balanced and its work more effective and \r\ntransparent, especially with regard to decision-making, \r\nis vital to adapting the United Nations to the realities \r\nof the twenty-first century. Ukraine therefore considers \r\nit a priority to carry out reform on both fronts, namely, \r\nenlarging the Security Council and improving its \r\nworking methods. Achieving progress in at least in one \r\nof those areas will serve our long-term interests. \r\n In that context, taking into account the lack of \r\nnoticeable progress in the negotiating process, Ukraine \r\nagrees that there is a need to further explore the \r\nA/64/PV.45  \r\n \r\n09-60625 22 \r\n \r\nintermediate model as a compromise and a first step \r\nforward. That arrangement should entail a mandatory \r\nreview of the reform process, which should be carried \r\nout in stages and should identify elements that can \r\npotentially be agreed on in the short term and those \r\nthat, given their controversial nature, should be \r\ndeferred and revisited by Member States during the \r\nreview. \r\n Ukraine is open to discussing all possible options \r\nand new, creative approaches to the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council. Nevertheless, our position remains \r\nthe same. Any increase in the category of \r\nnon-permanent members of the Council should ensure \r\nthat there is enhanced representation for the Group of \r\nEastern European States through the allocation of at \r\nleast one additional non-permanent seat. \r\n In conclusion, let me reaffirm Ukraine’s full \r\ncommitment to participating constructively in the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council, with the aim of securing a model that \r\ncan gain the widest possible support. \r\n Mr. Loulichki (Morocco) (spoke in French): The \r\nconsideration of the report of the Security Council to \r\nthe General Assembly (A/64/2) provides us an \r\nopportunity to evaluate the work done in the past year \r\nby that important organ in connection with the main \r\nissues on its agenda. We are very grateful to \r\nAmbassador Thomas Mayr-Harting for the clear and \r\nobjective presentation he has given us. \r\n With the intensification of the Council’s work, it \r\nis becoming increasingly clear that there is a need to \r\ncontinually improve its working methods in order to \r\npromote better interaction with the other organs and \r\nwith States that are not members of the Council. In that \r\nregard, some of the proposals made during the debate \r\non Council reform deserve the Council’s attention. \r\nHowever, although improvements in the Council’s \r\nworking methods are necessary, they are but a \r\ncomplement to, not a substitute for, overall reform of \r\nthe Council to make it more representative and to adapt \r\nit to the profound changes that have taken place at the \r\ninternational level. \r\n The situations and issues taken up by the Council, \r\nthe number of meetings and consultations held and the \r\nresolutions it has adopted reflect the fact that the \r\nCouncil continues to be attentive to situations in every \r\nregion of the world that pose a threat to international \r\npeace and security.  \r\n The situation in the Middle East, including the \r\nPalestinian question, has been the subject of the \r\nCouncil’s attention. That was especially the case in \r\nDecember 2008 and January 2009, following the tragic \r\nevents in Gaza and their devastating humanitarian \r\nconsequences for the Palestinian civilian population. \r\nDespite the Council’s unanimous adoption of \r\nresolution 1860 (2009), Palestinians continue to await \r\nthe full implementation of its provisions and the \r\nfulfilment of international reconstruction commitments \r\nso that they can once again lead normal and dignified \r\nlives.  \r\n As in previous years, the African continent \r\ncontinues to be at the centre of the Council’s concerns \r\nwith regard to both peacekeeping and peacebuilding. \r\nThe Council’s high-level debate last March on peace \r\nand security in Africa (see S/PV.6092 and \r\nS/PV.6092 (Resumption 1)) enabled the Council to \r\nevaluate progress on peace and reconciliation in \r\ncountries such as Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea-\r\nBissau — an undertaking to which the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission has made an invaluable contribution. \r\n That debate also illustrated once again the need \r\nfor the international community to redouble efforts to \r\nstrengthen peace processes in other parts of Africa and \r\nto mark the way for the emergence of political \r\nsolutions adapted to individual situations. In addition, \r\nthe debate showed the importance of the participation \r\nof regional actors in promoting such solutions and the \r\nresponsibilities they must assume in doing so.  \r\n The truth of that is self-evident in every situation, \r\nincluding the issue of Western Sahara, concerning \r\nwhich the Council has continually called on all the \r\nparties, including Algeria, to cooperate with United \r\nNations efforts and with each other in order to achieve, \r\nthrough the process of negotiation, a realistic political \r\nsolution that is acceptable to all. In response to appeals \r\nby the Security Council and to the desires of the \r\ninternational community, Morocco has put forward a \r\nnegotiable autonomy initiative that, once agreed and \r\nfinalized, will be put before the people concerned for \r\ntheir approval. That initiative illustrates my country’s \r\ndesire to pull the settlement process out of the current \r\ndeadlock, where, unfortunately, the other parties want \r\nto stay, clinging to outdated and non-viable approaches \r\nand turning to diversionary tactics and erroneous \r\npretexts aimed at eroding the negotiating dynamics. \r\n A/64/PV.45\r\n \r\n23 09-60625 \r\n \r\n Since 1976, when the decolonization of the \r\nSahara was completed, Morocco has pledged its will to \r\nresolve that artificial conflict. We shall continue to do \r\nso peaceably and with commitment, in the hope that \r\nthe other parties will in the end become part of the \r\nnegotiating dynamics, with the political will to make it \r\nsucceed, in the interests of all the peoples of the \r\nMaghreb. \r\n Mr. Ragaglini (Italy): Let me begin by thanking, \r\nyou, Madam, and the President of the General \r\nAssembly for holding today’s debate, which gives us \r\nan opportunity to review the work of the Security \r\nCouncil in the past year. It also invites us to examine \r\nthe current state of the process aimed at making the \r\nCouncil more transparent, efficient, effective and \r\nrepresentative of all Member States. That is all the \r\nmore appropriate in that 2009 has been the year in \r\nduring which the intergovernmental negotiations on \r\nSecurity Council reform began. Those negotiations will \r\ntherefore be main chief focus of my statement. \r\n First, however, let me thank Ambassador \r\nRugunda, Permanent Representatives of Uganda, and \r\nAmbassador Mayr-Harting, Permanent Representative \r\nof Austria, for the annual report of the Security Council \r\n(A/64/2). Concrete efforts were made by the \r\npresidencies involved to foster greater transparency in \r\nthe Security Council, in particular the holding of \r\nmeetings with all Member States over the past weeks to \r\ndiscuss the draft report. That process of consultations, \r\nwhich we fully endorse, was inaugurated last year by \r\nour colleague Ambassador Minh, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Viet Nam. \r\n Another concrete contribution to more \r\ntransparency and openness was the renewed \r\nmomentum on reforming working methods that was \r\ngenerated thanks to the Security Council’s open debate \r\non 27 August 2008 (see S/PV.5968 and \r\nS/PV.5968 (Resumption 1)). Such a debate had not \r\nbeen held since the 1990s. We believe it is crucial to \r\ncontinue to address that fundamental aspect of reform. \r\nThere have been improvements recently. The more \r\ntransparent approach in recent years to the process of \r\ndrafting the annual report has been a significant step, \r\nbut much remains to be done. \r\n There were also tangible signs in the past year of \r\nrenewed efforts towards comprehensive reform of the \r\nSecurity Council, efforts punctuated by the start of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations last February. The \r\nGeneral Assembly decided unanimously to launch \r\nthose intergovernmental negotiations by its decision \r\n62/557, of September 2008. The mechanism thus \r\ncreated proved to be effective in the end, as it was \r\nimplemented in its entirety. I must recall, for example, \r\nthe reservations that some delegations had with regard \r\nto the role of the Open-ended Working Group at the \r\nvery beginning of the last session of the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n The Working Group met from November \r\n2008 through January 2009 to help clarify procedural \r\naspects — a process that was essential to the launching \r\nof the negotiations. One particularly controversial \r\npoint in the discussions was the informal nature of the \r\nexercise. Without the Working Group, the negotiations \r\nwould have started within a completely unknown \r\nframework, and their failure would have been a \r\nforegone conclusion. \r\n Substantive negotiations began in February under \r\nthe valued guidance of Ambassador Tanin. I wish to \r\ntake this opportunity to congratulate him on his \r\nconfirmation as Chairperson and to reaffirm our \r\nreadiness to fully cooperate with him in this complex \r\nexercise. Since February, over the course of three \r\nrounds, we have examined all the issues related to \r\nreform, as well as their interlinkages. This is not the \r\nplace for a detailed re-examination of the outcome. I \r\nwould, however, like to offer some thumbnail \r\nreflections on what has taken place so that we might \r\nchart the direction in which we can realistically expect \r\nto move over the next few months. \r\n There is no doubt that sharp differences still exist \r\nbetween the parties. It is no secret that Member States \r\ncontinue to be deeply divided over the question of \r\ncategories of membership, and none of the various \r\nproposals has the required support. All attempts to \r\ncreate the impression of a majority in favour of this or \r\nthat model have inevitably ended in failure. No model \r\nhas the necessary support: not the African model, not \r\nthe Group of Four model, not the Uniting for \r\nConsensus model and not the models presented by \r\nother groups and delegations. That is another clear \r\noutcome of the negotiations. \r\n In this debate we have heard some delegations \r\nrequesting from the chair a negotiating paper to be \r\nnarrowed down through the exclusion of options that \r\nhave less support. I would like to recall that that \r\nA/64/PV.45  \r\n \r\n09-60625 24 \r\n \r\nproposal has already been rejected, at the Assembly’s \r\nsixty-third session.  \r\n Let me be clear on that point. First, our \r\nnegotiations are intergovernmental — that is, they are \r\nbased on the positions and proposals of Member States. \r\nSecondly, that proposal seeks to endorse a process \r\nbased on a logic of majority-minority, hard to identify, \r\nthat literally goes against the nature of a negotiation. \r\nCounting votes in the Assembly is one thing; \r\nnegotiating and looking for compromise is something \r\ncompletely different.  \r\n To the contrary, we all decided to start real \r\nnegotiations. Our goal has therefore become to identify \r\na path towards compromise solutions that have the \r\nnecessary support of the General Assembly. We believe \r\nthat there are at least three paths that could be helpful \r\nas we move ahead.  \r\n First, as we have said in recent months, despite \r\nthe confirmation of differences, the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations have so far outlined some areas of \r\nconvergence among the various groups: the issue of \r\nsize, which is gravitating towards 20-plus; reform of \r\nthe Council’s working methods, an area where there is \r\nconsensus on the need to push for improvements; and \r\nupdating the decision-making mechanisms. While the \r\nlatter broaches the sensitive issue of the veto, it is \r\nnevertheless an issue on which almost the entire \r\nmembership continues to express a will for debate. The \r\nsame holds true for the question of the relations \r\nbetween the Security Council and the General \r\nAssembly, as well as the other main bodies of the \r\nUnited Nations. For the purposes of moving the \r\nnegotiation forward, it would be helpful to build on \r\nthose areas of convergence. \r\n Secondly, another prerequisite for progress in the \r\ndiscussions is the abandonment of extreme positions. \r\nLast April, Colombia and Italy presented a new \r\nplatform that includes innovations on the positions that \r\nUniting for Consensus proposed in 2005. We could \r\nhave refused to budge from our original position, but \r\nwe sincerely believe that these negotiations can reach a \r\npositive conclusion only through an agreement based \r\non compromise. That is why we presented our \r\nproposal, clarifying that it remains an open basis for \r\ndiscussion. Today, we strongly believe that the time has \r\ncome for others to take a similar step towards common \r\nground. \r\n Thirdly, as in any other complex negotiating \r\nprocesses, it is essential to make efforts to find \r\ninnovative solutions that would bring the parties closer \r\ntogether. We see at least two areas on which it would \r\nbe worthwhile to focus.  \r\n The first would be the so-called intermediate \r\nsolutions. I wish to underline from the outset that Italy \r\ndoes not have a definitive position in favour of or \r\nopposed to intermediate approaches. At the same time, \r\nwe remain open to any prospect aimed at facilitating a \r\ncompromise solution. That is why we support \r\nproposals for the further exploration of intermediate \r\noptions. Our goal is to gain a clearer understanding of \r\nthe substance of these ideas. \r\n The second innovative solution that deserves in-\r\ndepth exploration is regional representation. I am well \r\naware that there are countries that are still wary of that \r\nnotion. Nevertheless, it represents a new approach that \r\nis the subject of growing interest on the part of various \r\ngroups, including groups outside Uniting for \r\nConsensus; of course, I am thinking of the European \r\nUnion. Just a few days ago, the process for ratifying \r\nthe Lisbon Treaty was completed with an additional \r\nleap in the common external projection of the \r\nEuropean Union. But I am also thinking of Africa, \r\nwhose underrepresentation in the Council is one of the \r\nmost urgent reasons for reform.  \r\n The twenty-first century is a world in which \r\nregional organizations have an absolute role in the \r\nmaintenance of peace and security, on an equal footing \r\nwith States. An increased regional dimension in the \r\nCouncil — which should also be pursued through \r\nreform of the Council’s provisional rules — as opposed \r\nto an increase in the number of seats for a tiny group of \r\ncountries, would automatically ensure greater \r\nrepresentation of all United Nations Member States. \r\n All one has to do is leaf through the table of \r\ncontents of the annual report of the Security Council, \r\nwhich lists the issues addressed by the Council, to gage \r\nthe weight that regional organizations have acquired. \r\nAny reform that does not take due account of that \r\naspect and instead hinges on the archaic logic of a \r\nconcert of Powers would be outdated on arrival. \r\nRather, it is our duty to create a Security Council that \r\nis more effective and more truly representative of the \r\nworld in which we live today. \r\n Mr. Solón-Romero (Plurinational State of \r\nBolivia) (spoke in Spanish): I wish to thank the \r\n A/64/PV.45\r\n \r\n25 09-60625 \r\n \r\npresidency for convening this meeting of the General \r\nAssembly on an issue central to reforming the \r\nOrganization to make it more democratic. I also wish \r\nto thank Ambassador Zahir Tanin, chair of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, and all members of his \r\nteam for their outstanding work. We are aware of how \r\ndifficult it was to launch this process, much sought by \r\nthe international community, and to lead it with the \r\nrequired objectivity, balance and neutrality. The \r\ndelegation of the Plurinational State of Bolivia believes \r\nthat the intergovernmental negotiations should resume \r\nimmediately, building on all the progress made during \r\nthe three previous rounds of discussions.  \r\n Reform of the Security Council goes beyond \r\nmerely increasing the number of its members and is \r\ndirectly linked to the abolition of the veto, as many \r\nMembers stated during the three rounds of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. Bolivia reaffirms the \r\nrelevance and centrality of the issue of the veto in \r\ngenuine Council reform, which is intrinsically linked \r\nboth to an expansion of the Council and to its working \r\nmethods, in particular its decision-making mechanism \r\nand its actions. Bolivia does not believe that an \r\nartificial distinction should be made between those \r\nissues, which would detract from the \r\ncomprehensiveness of the current process.  \r\n The veto is not democratic. It paralyzes the \r\ndecisions of the Security Council and undermines a \r\nfundamental principle on which the United Nations is \r\nbased: the sovereign equality of all its Members. \r\nTherefore, any attempt to supersede that concept \r\nthrough the adoption of norms that are not democratic \r\nand that are offensive to the membership and the \r\ninternational community as a whole, threatening the \r\nclimate of peace among nations, is unacceptable. \r\n As for increasing the number of permanent \r\nmembers, Bolivia believes that expansion is necessary, \r\nas we have stated in the three previous rounds of \r\nnegotiations. However, that expansion should apply to \r\none category alone. There should be 25 members \r\nwithout privileges, without permanent membership and \r\nwith the same rights and responsibilities. That would \r\nthus meet the need to restore the balance of power \r\nbetween the General Assembly and the Security \r\nCouncil, in accordance with the principles of the \r\nCharter. \r\n We believe that reform of the Security Council \r\nshould not be restricted to the question of the \r\nexpansion of its membership alone, but rather should \r\nalso incorporate a profound transformation of its \r\nworking methods. Democracy, transparency and \r\naccountability are all linked to the taking of decisions \r\nthat are sometimes binding on all members. Those \r\ncomponents should, therefore, be present in the \r\nworking methods of the Security Council and its \r\nsubsidiary bodies, such as the sanctions committee and \r\nothers. The Council should convene more open \r\nsessions, which would guarantee the transparency \r\nwithin that United Nations body. It should be open to \r\nglobal, public opinion and to States that are not \r\nmembers. \r\n It would be very useful to be able to draw on a \r\ndocument that compiles the various proposals that have \r\nbeen presented to date. It would also be useful if the \r\npresidency would issue an agenda of work, so we could \r\nmake progress on that important discussion during the \r\nsixty-fourth session of the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Beck (Solomon Islands): We thank the \r\npresidency for convening this meeting on Security \r\nCouncil reform. Let me begin by congratulating our \r\ndear colleague, Ambassador Zahir Tanin, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Afghanistan, on his reappointment as \r\nChair of our intergovernmental negotiations. Under the \r\nleadership of the President of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-third session, His Excellency Father Miguel \r\nd’Escoto Brockmann, Ambassador Tanin ably steered \r\nus in three rounds of negotiations on the five identified \r\nnegotiable elements. My delegation commends him for \r\ntaking us to a new level of discussion. \r\n My delegation is reassured by our President, \r\nMr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, and his substantive \r\nstatement yesterday, stating that there is broad \r\nagreement to build on progress attained since the last \r\nsession. In this connection, my delegation welcomes \r\nhis engagement in facilitating the process and looks \r\nforward to working with him to enhance the legitimacy \r\nand accountability of our Council, making it more \r\nrepresentative, efficient and transparent. \r\n My delegation continues to echo its support for \r\nincreased membership in both categories, permanent \r\nand non-permanent. We would like to see equitable \r\ngeographical representation, including in the \r\npermanent category, among regions currently not \r\nrepresented or under-represented, that is, Africa, Asia \r\nand Latin American and the Caribbean. \r\nA/64/PV.45  \r\n \r\n09-60625 26 \r\n \r\n We would like to see the veto abolished, as it has \r\ntoo often been used for political reasons and to block \r\naction. However, should the veto be retained, all its \r\nprerogatives and privileges must be extended to new \r\npermanent members. Having said this, we remain firm \r\nthat the veto power should not be applied in instances \r\nof genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. \r\n There is already overwhelming support among \r\nthe membership to reform the Council’s working \r\nmethods. The group of five small countries (S-5) has \r\nmade specific proposals that, in our view, provide a \r\ngood basis to begin real negotiations. I hope that, \r\nduring this session, substantive progress on that \r\nelement can be achieved. \r\n On the question of the relationship between the \r\nCouncil and the Assembly the General Assembly, as \r\nchief deliberator of the international community, is, as \r\nhas been stated in previous debates, the most \r\nrepresentative and democratic organ of the United \r\nNations. By right, the Assembly should have an \r\nenhanced role in its relationships with the Council, \r\nmaking the Council accountable to the Assembly for its \r\naction or lack of it. As stated by my colleagues from \r\nthe small island developing States who spoke before \r\nme, we would also like to see greater access for and \r\neffective participation of our States in a reformed \r\nCouncil. \r\n Let me close by commenting on the process we \r\nhave adopted. My delegation hopes we can uphold the \r\nintegrity of our process. We need to achieve a few \r\nmilestones during this session by entrusting our Chair \r\nto come up with a text based on inputs registered so far \r\nand within a specified timeframe, so that we can have \r\nmore focused and results-oriented negotiations. We \r\nmust have trust and faith in ourselves and in our \r\nprocess if we are truly to make any real and meaningful \r\nprogress. \r\n Mr. Borg (Malta): My delegation would like to \r\ncommend the work and activities of the Security \r\nCouncil during the past 12 months, as reflected in its \r\nreport A/64/2 introduced by the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Austria. \r\n In this regard, we note, in particular, the fact that \r\nthere was an increase in the number of open debates \r\nand open briefings. We welcome this trend, since in our \r\nview, it reflects an increase in transparency and \r\nopenness in the work of the Security Council, which, in \r\nturn, enhances access and participation by all United \r\nNations Members States in the consideration of \r\nimportant issues related to the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. \r\n Situations in Africa, Asia and the Middle East \r\ncontinue to create concern for the whole membership \r\nof the United Nations. Once again, we note, in \r\nparticular, the conflicts in Africa, which continue to \r\noccupy a considerable part of the work and activities of \r\nthe Security Council. Considering that half of the \r\ncurrent United Nations peacekeeping operations and a \r\nnumber of United Nations missions and offices are \r\nsituated in Africa, and that about 70 per cent of United \r\nNations peacekeepers work in Africa and 43 per cent of \r\nthe United Nations peacekeeping budget is devoted to \r\nactivities in Africa, related partnerships and \r\ncooperation have to be strengthened and enhanced. \r\n Therefore, the role of the Security Council is \r\nessential and primordial. The holding, therefore, by the \r\nSecurity Council of a high-level debate on peace and \r\nsecurity in Africa last March provided an important \r\ncontribution in defining strategies for cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the African Union \r\n(AU) — a key and critical player in the area of peace \r\nand security — and for the deployment of AU peace \r\nsupport operations and the African Peace and Security \r\nArchitecture.  \r\n My delegation also welcomes the missions \r\nundertaken by Security Council members to Africa, the \r\nAsian region and Haiti, which continue to bring the \r\nwork of the Council closer to Governments and \r\npeoples in conflict areas. We feel that such missions \r\nassist Council members in getting a first-hand \r\nassessment of the negative impact of the tensions and \r\nturmoil resulting from conflicts, which continue to \r\nobstruct the economic and social development of many \r\ncountries and which displace large populations and \r\nincrease poverty, the number of refugees and political \r\ninstability. \r\n The situation in the Middle East continues to \r\npresent a formidable challenge in the search for a way \r\nto relaunch the Middle East peace process, with the \r\nPalestinian question at its core. The grave events that \r\noccurred at the beginning of this year in and around the \r\nGaza Strip, resulting in considerable loss of life, have \r\naggravated the deteriorating humanitarian situation \r\nthere and require a more decisive contribution and \r\ninvolvement on the part of the Security Council in \r\norder to fully implement Security Council resolution \r\n A/64/PV.45\r\n \r\n27 09-60625 \r\n \r\n1860 (2009) of 8 January. The entire membership of \r\nthe United Nations looks to and expects the Security \r\nCouncil to embark on reinvigorated efforts and \r\nmeasures in implementing the Quartet’s Road Map. \r\n Malta joins the other delegations that continue to \r\ncall for a durable and political solution to the question \r\nof Palestine and the Middle East conflict, and for \r\nrestarting negotiations that can lead to an independent, \r\ndemocratic, contiguous and viable Palestinian State \r\nliving side by side in peace and security with Israel. \r\nMy delegation urges Council members to continue to \r\nengage all concerned parties to contribute in a more \r\nsubstantive manner in order to put the Middle East \r\npeace process back on track again. \r\n Malta welcomes the Security Council’s efforts to \r\naddress, at times at a high level, thematic, general and \r\nother issues relevant to the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. The fact that the \r\nSecurity Council is fully engaged with other United \r\nNations Member States in discussing such important \r\nand contemporary issues goes a long way to ensuring a \r\nbetter working relationship between the Council and \r\nthe Assembly, thus making the Council more \r\ntransparent, efficient and effective. At the same time, \r\nMalta feels that the annual report of the Security \r\nCouncil should include appropriate analysis of its \r\nwork, including of its internal discussions and its \r\ndrafting of resolutions and decisions, which eventually, \r\nwhen adopted, have to be implemented by the whole \r\nmembership of the United Nations. \r\n Malta feels that a considerable degree of progress \r\nhas been achieved in the past 12 months on the reform \r\nof the Security Council, as a result of the healthy and \r\nproactive exchanges that have taken place in the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on the five key issues. \r\nMy delegation would like to thank Ambassador Zahir \r\nTanin for his contribution to making the process \r\npossible. Still, more ground must be covered to ensure \r\nthat our deliberations result in an effective and \r\nproductive outcome. From the start of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations Malta has striven in a \r\nsustained effort to make an objective and transparent \r\ncontribution so as to advance the legitimate aspirations \r\nof a small State, desiring not to be marginalized or \r\noverlooked in these important negotiations. Malta has \r\nalso been consistent and persistent in expressing its \r\nresolute position that small States, which make up \r\nnearly one fourth of the Organization’s membership, \r\nmust be given due and important recognition during \r\nour discussion of a reformed Security Council. \r\n In each and every statement by Malta, we have \r\ncontinued to observe that the five key issues are \r\ninextricably linked and that consideration of any one of \r\nthese issues must, therefore, ensure a coherent and \r\ncohesive progression on the others. Attempts have been \r\nmade recently to de-link these issues; it is therefore of \r\ncritical importance that under the President’s wise \r\nleadership the intergovernmental negotiations continue \r\nto recognize that all key issues must be considered as a \r\nwhole and not in isolation, which would go totally \r\nagainst the consensus reached in the Assembly’s \r\ndecision 62/557 of 15 September 2008. The statement \r\nof the President of this Assembly yesterday morning \r\nassured us that the five key issues will continue to be \r\nconsidered as one package.  \r\n As a small Member State, my delegation attaches \r\nparticular importance to the issue of the size of an \r\nenlarged Security Council. I would like to emphasize \r\nthat the significant increase in the number of small \r\nStates that are United Nations Members must be taken \r\nfully into account when discussing the proposed \r\nexpansion of the Council. This, in the view of my \r\ndelegation, would yield justice to the more than \r\n40 small Member States that clamour for a better \r\nresponse and full recognition of the legitimacy of their \r\nclaims in the intergovernmental negotiations. It will be \r\nrecalled that Colombia and Italy introduced a realistic \r\nand feasible proposal for a model of reform that \r\nincluded reserving a seat for small States. My \r\ndelegation feels that small States involved in the \r\nnegotiations must rally around this proposal to show \r\ntheir determination to see their aspirations become \r\nreality. \r\n Improving the transparency, efficiency and \r\neffectiveness of the Security Council’s working \r\nmethods is one of the pillars among the key elements \r\nof reform. As a small State, Malta is strongly in favour \r\nof more open briefings, fewer closed meetings, and \r\nincreased transparency and openness in the work of the \r\nCouncil through enhanced access and participation for \r\nall United Nations Member States. In particular, the \r\nviews of the general membership should receive more \r\npositive attention from Security Council members. \r\n As I have already stated, the relationship between \r\nthe Security Council and the General Assembly has to \r\nbe enhanced in such a manner as to ensure the \r\nA/64/PV.45  \r\n \r\n09-60625 28 \r\n \r\ntransparency and accountability of a reformed Security \r\nCouncil. The important link between the Council and \r\nthe General Assembly — and the role that the \r\nAssembly should play in those instances where action \r\nneeded to maintain international peace and security is \r\nblocked because of the exercise of a veto by a \r\npermanent member — must form part of a more open \r\ndebate during the intergovernmental negotiations. \r\nMember States should therefore acknowledge the clear \r\ndemand to constructively engage on the issue of the \r\nveto, including the limitation of its use by all \r\npermanent members of the Security Council. \r\n The issue of regional representation is closely \r\nlinked to that concerning underrepresentation, as well \r\nas to the other four key issues. During the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations we have heard many \r\ndelegations explain how their respective geographical \r\nor political groupings are underrepresented in the \r\ncurrent composition and structure of the Council. In \r\nthis context, regional representation could make a \r\npositive and constructive contribution to a reformed \r\nSecurity Council. Malta feels that our deliberations \r\nshould take a more constructive approach to this \r\nimportant issue and that therefore we should embark on \r\na detailed discussion of how to debate it effectively. \r\n Malta would like to acknowledge the smooth \r\ntransition process for continuing negotiations in the \r\ncurrent session of the General Assembly. My \r\ndelegation would also like to stress the necessity of \r\ncarrying over the negotiations in a well-balanced way \r\nthat is representative of the discussions held to date, \r\nwith an all-inclusive and comprehensive presentation \r\nof all the options on the table, including those from the \r\nprevious rounds. That would ensure that any agreement \r\nreached in the intergovernmental negotiations will \r\nform part of the whole package, and that no piecemeal \r\ndecisions are taken, since these would be detrimental to \r\nthe purpose of our talks and to the wider United \r\nNations membership, especially medium-size and \r\nsmall States. \r\n Mr. Mohamed (Maldives): May I begin by \r\nexpressing my appreciation to Ambassador Thomas \r\nMayr-Harting, the Permanent Representative of Austria \r\nand current President of the Security Council, for his \r\npresentation of the report of the Security Council \r\n(A/64/2) under agenda item 9. \r\n Let me also take this opportunity to welcome the \r\nreappointment of Ambassador Zahir Tanin, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Afghanistan, as Chair of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. We look forward to a \r\nvery comprehensive and productive discussion on the \r\nissues at hand during the sixty-fourth session. \r\n Over the past 15 years, the Maldives and other \r\nMember States of the General Assembly have \r\nexpressed their desire to see wide-ranging reform of \r\nthe United Nations in order to improve the \r\neffectiveness of the Organization. Such reform has now \r\nbecome an integral part of our institution as we address \r\nthe challenges and difficult tasks we face today. \r\n In that regard, comprehensive reform of the \r\nSecurity Council lies at the heart of our larger efforts at \r\nrevamping an international structure that came into \r\nbeing more than 60 years ago. For the United Nations \r\nto continue on its path of progress towards becoming a \r\nmore effective institution, the Security Council must be \r\nexpanded and restructured to reflect today’s \r\ngeopolitical realities. The Maldives is of the view that \r\nthe inclusion of both India and Japan in any future \r\ncomposition of the Security Council remains an \r\nimportant and fundamental aspect of future reform, \r\nproviding a key mechanism for the effective \r\nfunctioning of the Security Council in the twenty-first \r\ncentury. \r\n We welcome the statement made by the President \r\nof the General Assembly yesterday on the question of \r\nSecurity Council reform and his commitment to finding \r\na just and agreeable solution to the five key issues. The \r\nrecent positive efforts made during the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on the question of \r\nequitable representation and increase in the \r\nmembership of the Security Council must be \r\nmaintained during the current session as well. \r\nHowever, there is a still work that needs to be done to \r\naddress the concerns of all Member States to make the \r\nmembership truly representative. \r\n While the composition of the Council remains a \r\nkey area of priority, we believe that the working \r\nmethods of the Council must also be improved, with a \r\nview to restoring its credibility, authority and \r\nlegitimacy within the United Nations system.  \r\n We also believe that the expanded membership of \r\nthe new Council should come from both developing \r\ncountries and developed countries and should include \r\nthe participation of small islands, landlocked and other \r\nvulnerable States, reflective of the United Nations and \r\nits diverse membership. \r\n A/64/PV.45\r\n \r\n29 09-60625 \r\n \r\n Lastly, we wish to emphasize the need to rethink \r\nthe veto power in order to strengthen the present \r\narchitecture for the adoption of responsive and \r\npreventive measures aimed at maintaining international \r\npeace and security. \r\n The Maldives firmly believes that this Assembly \r\nmust be committed to the implementation of decision \r\n62/557 in letter and spirit. We fully support the stand \r\ntaken by the President of the General Assembly and \r\nwelcome his commitment to advance the reform effort \r\nthrough a constructive and consultative process in the \r\ninformal plenary. Furthermore, we call for the widest \r\npossible political acceptance by Member States in \r\nproceeding with these negotiations. It is our view that  \r\nfailure to reach consensus should not prevent action on \r\nthese important reforms. \r\n Before I conclude, I would like to express my \r\nhope that consensus can be achieved in reaching a \r\nsolution to the general reform and composition of the \r\nSecurity Council. We must be united in our resolve and \r\npragmatic in our approach so as to break the impasse \r\nthat has caused United Nations reform to stagnate for \r\nthe past 15 years. Only by working together will we be \r\nable to bring forth a Security Council that would be \r\nrepresentative, efficient and able to deal effectively \r\nwith the shared challenges we face today. \r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n"
