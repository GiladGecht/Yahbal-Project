Members \r\nwill also recall that the reports of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral issued as documents A/64/87 and A/64/263 \r\nhave already been discussed at the 26th plenary \r\nmeeting of the Assembly on 27 October 2009. In \r\nconnection with agenda item 114, the Assembly \r\nadopted resolution 64/1 at its 15th plenary meeting on \r\n6 October 2009. \r\n Mr. Lidén (Sweden): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of the European Union (EU). \r\n There are many aspects to the implementation of \r\nthe Millennium Summit. I would like to focus today on \r\none important issue: climate change and its possible \r\nsecurity implications. The watershed report of the \r\nSecretary-General on this topic, contained in document \r\nA/64/350, could not be more timely. It marks the \r\nbeginning of a new field of work for the United \r\nNations. \r\n Three considerations underpin the European \r\nUnion perspective: first, the impacts of climate change \r\nare universal; secondly, left unchecked global warming \r\nwill sooner or later affect us all — rich or poor, North \r\nor South; and thirdly, it is not a challenge only to some, \r\nbut of concern to us all. That implies that our response \r\nmust be global. Since climate change brings shared \r\nchallenges, we need to respond with a comprehensive \r\napproach at all levels and with all policy tools at our \r\ndisposal. No country can tackle these issues in \r\nisolation. \r\n There is an urgent need for action. The security \r\nrisks posed by climate change are real. They are \r\nalready being felt. They are having an impact on \r\npeople’s lives. One key measure will be a common \r\npush in the lead-up to Copenhagen and a bold \r\nagreement there. \r\n By redrawing the maps of water availability, food \r\nsecurity, disease prevalence, population distribution \r\nand coastal zones, climate change will have serious \r\nimplications for the security and development of entire \r\nA/64/PV.47  \r\n \r\n09-60826 2 \r\n \r\nregions. We need to build emergency preparedness \r\ncapacity for both the immediate and the longer terms, \r\nas well as be prepared to address a number of \r\nunprecedented and unpredictable challenges. The \r\nHyogo Framework for Action gives us an important \r\nplatform in building resilience of nations and \r\ncommunities to disasters. \r\n The poor and vulnerable are most at risk. One \r\nthird of Africans live in areas prone to drought. By \r\n2020, an additional 75 to 250 million Africans are \r\nlikely to be at risk of water stress. Sea-level rise, \r\ncoastal flooding, changing rainfall patterns and drought \r\ncould displace as many as 200 million people in Africa \r\nby 2050. Scientists draw the conclusion that climate \r\nchange threatens to exacerbate those trends and \r\nundermine Governments’ ability to ensure security and \r\nsustainable development. \r\n For people of many small island developing \r\nStates, the link between climate change, development \r\nand security is a question not only of regional stability, \r\nbut also of national survival. In response to sea-level \r\nrise and salt water inundation, relocation strategies are \r\nbeing formulated by some nations and opportunities \r\nprovided for citizens to migrate. The international \r\ncommunity will have to tackle the legal and political \r\nimplications of migration caused by climate-related \r\nevents and Stateless citizens within a not so distant \r\nfuture. \r\n In the Arctic region, the effects of climate change \r\nare plainly visible with melting sea ice, the melting of \r\nthe Greenland icecap and thawing permafrost. Coastal \r\nerosion has already made it necessary to relocate entire \r\ncommunities. Fortunately, in that region international \r\ncooperation structures that bring together the States \r\nand the indigenous peoples involved are already in \r\nplace. Such cooperation fosters confidence and helps to \r\naddress transboundary issues, adapt to new conditions, \r\nmaintain stability and avoid conflict. \r\n So how can we continue our efforts to address the \r\nchallenges before us? The European Union would like \r\nto highlight five areas where action is needed. \r\n First, we need a transformation of our economies \r\nto mitigate climate change. We must take bold and \r\ndetermined action to reduce our collective emissions of \r\ngreenhouse gases. It is necessary to limit global \r\ntemperature rise below 2 degrees. Developed countries \r\nwill have to take the lead with binding commitments, \r\nand developing countries, especially the advanced \r\nemerging economies, will also have to contribute with \r\nintensified actions. \r\n Secondly, we need to focus our efforts. The \r\nSecretary-General’s landmark report proposes two \r\ncourses of action. One is to focus on problem areas \r\nwith high-impact and irreversible consequences; the \r\nother is to accelerate the identification of threat \r\nminimizers. It is a question of creating positive spirals \r\nof change and making systematic use of available \r\ntools. A focused research effort will help to \r\ncontinuously improve our understanding of the drivers \r\nof climate change and the options we have to reduce its \r\nimpact. \r\n Thirdly, we need to identify and strengthen the \r\ninterconnections between climate change and security, \r\nbetween climate change and development, and between \r\nadaptation and mitigation. Adaptation is about forms of \r\ndevelopment in which the capacity to manage risk \r\ndetermines progress. There are synergies between \r\nadaptation measures and emission reductions that \r\nshould be explored. Investment in mitigation and \r\nadaptation should go hand in hand with efforts to \r\naddress and respond to the international security threat \r\nposed by climate change. International cooperation \r\nshould be enhanced in the areas of early warning, \r\nconflict management and peacebuilding in the context \r\nof global warming. These actions should all be viewed \r\nas part of a preventive security policy. \r\n Fourthly, adaptation to climate change is a \r\nchallenge for every country. Special attention must be \r\npaid to the most vulnerable groups and the poor. It is \r\ncrucial to strengthen the ability of individuals, societies \r\nand ecosystems to deal with this challenge. Adaptation \r\nin the agricultural sector will be decisive for food \r\nsecurity and the livelihoods of poor people. A growing \r\nbody of scientific work also shows the importance of \r\napplying a gender perspective to adaptation. The \r\npromotion of good governance, human rights and \r\ngender equality are threat minimizers. They are \r\ndesirable in their own right but can also help lower the \r\nrisk of climate-related insecurity. Regional and \r\nmultinational adaptation activities can have trust-\r\ncreating and peacebuilding effects. \r\n Last but not least, because the agenda is so all-\r\nencompassing, a multilateral response is warranted. \r\nThe United Nations has the capacity like no other \r\norganization to address this issue in all its dimensions \r\nand must take the lead. The report of the Secretary-\r\n A/64/PV.47\r\n \r\n3 09-60826 \r\n \r\nGeneral is the first of its kind and has the potential to \r\nserve as a vital point of departure for the United \r\nNations. While the way forward outlined by the \r\nSecretary-General is a good basis for further work, the \r\nEU would have appreciated more specific \r\nrecommendations. The role of the United Nations in \r\nterms of responsibilities, capacities and resources \r\nshould be made even more explicit. The European \r\nUnion would hope that the Secretary-General can make \r\nuse of some of our proposals on how the United \r\nNations system could address emerging challenges. \r\n It is important that we continue to build \r\nknowledge and discuss solutions jointly at the global \r\nlevel. In March 2008, the highest decision-making \r\nbody of the EU, the European Council, considered the \r\nimpact of climate change on international security, how \r\nit affects Europe’s own security and how the European \r\nUnion should respond to it. This assessment was \r\nfollowed up with more specific recommendations for \r\naction. As a consequence, we have enhanced our \r\nconflict prevention and crisis management, but we \r\nneed to improve analysis and early warning \r\ncapabilities. The European Union cannot do this alone. \r\nWe must now step up our efforts, in particular with the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n Climate change and its security implications are \r\nan item that should be kept regularly on the agenda of \r\nthe General Assembly, underpinned by regular reports \r\nof the Secretary-General. The European Union also \r\nsupports consideration by the Security Council on this \r\nissue on a regular basis, if necessary. \r\n The first and most urgent step on the road to \r\nsecurity in the face of climate change is a global, \r\nambitious and comprehensive agreement in \r\nCopenhagen. It is the European Union’s profound \r\nbelief that there is no alternative to a successful \r\noutcome of the meeting in Copenhagen. An ambitious \r\nand binding deal is in the interests and is the \r\nresponsibility of all nations. \r\n Mr. Beck (Palau): I have the honour to speak on \r\nbehalf of the Pacific small island developing States \r\n(SIDS) represented at the United Nations, namely, Fiji, \r\nPapua New Guinea, the Republic of the Marshall \r\nIslands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, \r\nSamoa, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, Tonga, Vanuatu and \r\nmy own country, Palau. \r\n The Pacific small island developing States \r\nwelcome the report of the Secretary-General contained \r\nin document A/64/350, entitled “Climate change and its \r\npossible security implications”, and we would like to \r\nsincerely thank the Department of Economic and \r\nSocial Affairs (DESA) and the Division for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment for their lead role in preparing such a \r\ncomprehensive and substantive report in such a short \r\nperiod of time. We have a small and distinct window \r\nfor action and we appreciate the urgency with which \r\nthe Secretary-General has approached this matter. \r\n From the report, it is clear that the security \r\nimplications of climate change are not theoretical but \r\nreal. We note in particular the identification in the \r\nreport of emerging climate change-related threats \r\nwhich merit “the focused attention … of the \r\ninternational community” (A/64/350, p. 2). These \r\nthreats are ones which, in the words of the report, are \r\n“those that appear highly likely, are large in magnitude, \r\nmay unfold relatively swiftly, and are unprecedented in \r\nnature” (ibid.). These threats include loss of territory, \r\nstatelessness and increased numbers of displaced \r\npersons.  \r\n All of these threats have occurred or will \r\nimminently occur in the Pacific. It is the reality and \r\nimmediacy of these threats that initially motivated the \r\nPacific small island developing States to sponsor \r\nresolution 63/281 containing the request for the \r\nSecretary-General’s report. It is this reality that makes \r\nit increasingly critical that all relevant organs of the \r\nUnited Nations, including the Security Council, take up \r\nthis issue. \r\n The report first outlines the threat to human well-\r\nbeing in the fields of agriculture, water, health, coastal \r\nareas, human settlements and infrastructure. Indeed, \r\nthese threats are already being felt in the Pacific SIDS \r\nand have been comprehensively covered in our \r\nsubmission, as well as addressed in the national \r\nsubmissions of our members, which are available on \r\nthe DESA website. \r\n Next, the report goes on to describe the adverse \r\nimpacts of climate change on economic development. \r\nWe have covered these aspects in our submissions and \r\nwish to reiterate here that improvement and \r\ndegeneration in security and development are mutually \r\nreinforcing. The Pacific SIDS are pleased that the \r\ninternational community has started to look at climate \r\nchange in a holistic manner. We are no longer  \r\ndebating — nor should we continue to debate — \r\nwhether development or security is more important. I \r\nA/64/PV.47  \r\n \r\n09-60826 4 \r\n \r\nthink we all now agree that they exist side by side and \r\nthat development is not possible without security. \r\n In this respect, chapter V of the report, entitled \r\n“Threats from uncoordinated coping”, breaks new \r\nground. It pulls the various elements together and \r\ndemonstrates how the adverse effects of climate \r\nchange, both standing by themselves and in \r\nconjunction with other effects, present a clear threat to \r\nsecurity. It is of particular concern to us that  \r\n “in the case of small island developing States, the \r\nadverse impacts of climate change are already \r\nincreasing the rate of domestic migration and \r\nrelocation, with people from rural areas and \r\noutlying islands moving to urban centres as they \r\nlose their livelihoods and lands owing to natural \r\ndisasters and sea-level rise. This migration is \r\nplacing enormous strains on food, housing, \r\neducation, health, and water supplies, as recipient \r\ncommunities struggle to accommodate the number \r\nof people migrating” (A/64/350, para. 57). \r\nThe report further points to the estimates of the \r\nInternational Organization for Migration, which \r\nforecast as between 50 million and 350 million the \r\nnumber of persons who may have to migrate owing to \r\nclimate change and environmental degradation by \r\n2050. \r\n The report further points to the uncertainties of \r\nthe international legal framework for responding to \r\ndisplacement caused by the impacts of climate change. \r\nAt the same time, and this is not theoretical, the \r\nadverse impacts of climate change have already caused \r\ninternal displacement in the Federated States of \r\nMicronesia, Papua New Guinea, Tuvalu and Solomon \r\nIslands. In some Pacific SIDS, internal relocation is \r\nsimply not feasible because of geographical \r\nconstraints. Displacement to a neighbouring or third \r\ncountry might be the only option if climate change \r\ncontinues at the current or increased rate without \r\nsignificant and urgent mitigation by the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n Yet, while international law is not clear, \r\naccording to an analysis by the Office of the United \r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees, some \r\npeople forced to migrate by the effects of climate \r\nchange might be protected by the 1951 Convention \r\nrelating to the Status of Refugees, whereas others \r\nmight not be protected. There is little appetite for \r\nexpanding the refugee Convention to explicitly cover \r\nthose displaced by climate change, given the fear that \r\nthis risks lowering the protection currently afforded all \r\nrefugees. The discussion on what needs to be done to \r\nfill this legal vacuum has already begun and such \r\ndiscussions should be well timed. \r\n However, under no circumstances can efforts to \r\nprotect climate-displaced people be used as an excuse \r\nfor inaction on mitigation and adaptation. We must \r\nfocus our efforts first and foremost on preventing such \r\nforced migration and providing people of the Pacific \r\nwith the necessary resources to protect the integrity of \r\ntheir island homes, their unique cultural identity and \r\ntheir ability to provide for their means of subsistence. \r\nLeaving ancestral homelands and, in the most tragic \r\nscenario, leaving the entire country behind is a \r\ndevastating and unacceptable prospect for our people. \r\n I will now turn to chapter VI, which in many \r\nways is the most remarkable chapter in the report. It is \r\nentitled “Threat of loss of territory and statelessness”. \r\nThe report shows an alarming but correct example \r\nwhen it states: \r\n  “In the case of some small island developing \r\nStates, sea-level rise presents perhaps the ultimate \r\nsecurity threat, jeopardizing the very existence of \r\nsmall low-lying countries such as the Maldives, \r\nwhere 80 per cent of land is less than one metre \r\nabove sea level and could therefore disappear \r\nover the next 30 years.” (ibid., para. 71) \r\nWe are talking about the survival of nations, peoples \r\nand unique cultures, all of which are threatened by the \r\nadverse impacts of climate change. \r\n In addition, international law has never had to \r\ncontend with the disappearance of a country. There are \r\ncomplex political issues regarding the most appropriate \r\nmeans to address the rights of affected populations, \r\npartial and complete loss of sovereign territory and the \r\neffects on territorial waters and exclusive economic \r\nzones. The implications for affected people in terms of \r\nhuman rights, as well as the economic losses for the \r\ncountries concerned and the issue of sovereignty, are \r\nall matters of first impression as well as extraordinary \r\ninternational importance. \r\n The final chapter in the report tries to point a way \r\nforward on preventing and responding to the emerging \r\nthreats. Mitigation and adaptation are two important \r\nelements, both of which are dealt with under the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\n A/64/PV.47\r\n \r\n5 09-60826 \r\n \r\nChange process. We are now just days away from the \r\nCopenhagen Conference, and the Pacific SIDS, as \r\nmembers of the Alliance of Small Island States, expect \r\nthat all leaders will explicitly ensure our survival, \r\nsecurity and territorial integrity by making firm \r\ninternational commitments through legally binding \r\ninstruments to be adopted at Copenhagen. \r\n The political options on climate change have now \r\nbeen clearly outlined in negotiation texts. The choice \r\nbefore leaders at Copenhagen will be whether or not \r\nthe global community has sufficient political will to \r\nensure our security through legal instruments with \r\nserious, specific action on emissions by all nations. If \r\nwe fail, we will fail ourselves and future generations \r\nby delaying the decisions that need to be made now. \r\nFlimsy moral sentiments expressed at Copenhagen will \r\nbe no substitute for legally binding treaties and will do \r\nlittle to ensure the security of the most vulnerable \r\namong our membership. \r\n We look to Copenhagen for an agreement that \r\nwill, among other things, use the avoidance of adverse \r\nclimate change impacts on small island developing \r\nStates as one of the key benchmarks for assessing its \r\nappropriateness, consistent with the precautionary \r\nprinciple and the principle of prevention. Such an \r\nagreement must include a package of mitigation \r\nactivities now, up to and beyond 2012 that provides for \r\nthe long-term stabilization of atmospheric greenhouse \r\ngas concentrations at well below 350 parts per million \r\ncarbon dioxide-equivalent levels; limits global average \r\nsurface temperature increases to well below 1.5 \r\ndegrees centigrade above pre-industrial levels; and \r\nprovides for global greenhouse gas emissions to peak \r\nby 2015 and decline thereafter. \r\n As I have stated before, the report of the \r\nSecretary-General greatly enriches the debate on \r\nclimate change. It points out where the development \r\naspects and the security implications overlap, as well \r\nas where they stand apart. In fact, the General \r\nAssembly, by adopting the historic resolution 63/281, \r\nhas taken the same view. The report makes it clear that \r\ngaps remain in how the international system responds \r\nto the security implications of climate change. It is now \r\ntime to update the tools used to address those \r\nimplications.  \r\n The linkage between climate change and security \r\nneeds to be a permanent focus of deliberations in the \r\nUnited Nations. We reiterate our call for the inclusion \r\nof “security and climate change” as an annual agenda \r\nitem in the United Nations and for formal recognition \r\nof the link between security and climate change. We \r\nare already actively engaged in the General Assembly, \r\nin the Economic and Social Council and at the \r\nFramework Convention. It is time that the Security \r\nCouncil complement the discussion by looking at the \r\nappropriate aspects which fall under its own mandate. \r\n I now add the following remarks in my national \r\ncapacity for the Republic of Palau. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s excellent report, as we have said, envisions \r\nthat international peace and security will likely be \r\naffected by statelessness. This chilling conclusion \r\nmeans that, for the first time in the history of the \r\nworld, we are contemplating the loss of Member \r\nStates. Up to now, the membership of this body has \r\nonly grown with time. How will we feel when that \r\ntrend is reversed? The international community must \r\naddress itself to this reality with the mechanisms which \r\nare available to it. \r\n We submit that only the Security Council has the \r\nextraordinary powers to deal with threats like this. No, \r\nwe do not expect the Council to turn back the rising \r\nseas; but rather, we challenge the Council to creatively \r\nuse its powers under Chapter VII of the Charter to \r\ndevelop enforceable emissions targets and to give teeth \r\nto what is now, apparently, an ineffectual voluntary \r\nprocess. \r\n Mrs. Kolontai (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): The \r\nSecretary-General’s many reports on implementing the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) clearly attest \r\nto the fact that the impact of the complex multifaceted \r\ncrisis threatens the achievement by 2015 of the \r\ninternationally agreed development goals. \r\n The danger of a reduction in official development \r\nassistance, the absence of flexible global financial \r\nmechanisms, and the unpredictability of resources \r\nprovided to recipient countries during the crisis have \r\nled to a drastic decrease of the effectiveness of \r\ndevelopment measures taken by the Governments of \r\ndeveloping and middle-income countries. In that \r\ncontext, we believe it necessary to continue and expand \r\nassistance to developing and middle-income countries \r\nbecause it is precisely those countries that can become \r\na driving force for future economic and social progress. \r\n Belarus recognizes its responsibility to the \r\ninternational community in terms of development and \r\nmakes significant contributions towards the \r\nA/64/PV.47  \r\n \r\n09-60826 6 \r\n \r\nachievement of the MDGs. The Republic of Belarus \r\nhas made significant progress at home in a range of \r\nareas thanks to the targeted State support of health \r\ncare, education, agriculture, energy and other sectors of \r\nthe economy. Furthermore, we believe that an impetus \r\nto development efforts could be provided by the United \r\nNations system and other international structures in \r\ncreating mechanisms to improve access to new \r\ntechnologies and new and renewable sources of \r\nenergies for developing countries and those with \r\neconomies in transition. \r\n In the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document \r\n(resolution 60/1), Member States expressed serious \r\nconcern about the negative impact of transnational \r\norganized crime, one of the manifestations of which is \r\nthe traffic in persons. World leaders also recognized \r\nthat such traffic still poses a serious threat to \r\nhumankind and requires a concerted international \r\nresponse. A few days ago, the Third Committee \r\nadopted by consensus a draft resolution on improving \r\nthe coordination of efforts against the traffic in persons \r\nthat will enhance Member States’ efforts to bring a \r\nswift end to that contemporary form of slavery. \r\n As a consequence of decisions taken at the 2005 \r\nSummit, today we are closer than ever to drafting a \r\ncomprehensive United Nations plan of action to \r\ncombat the traffic in persons that will become an \r\neffective mechanism to pool the efforts of the \r\ninternational community to eradicate that social ill. The \r\ndraft resolution strengthens that idea, underlining the \r\nimportance of having transparent and open \r\nconsultations on the comprehensive plan of action and \r\nbearing in mind the needs of all interested parties and \r\nthe opinions of all Member States. \r\n For the first time in recent years, the work of the \r\nOpen-ended Ad Hoc Working Group on the \r\nRevitalization of the Work of the General Assembly led \r\nto the adoption of a substantive resolution at the sixty-\r\nthird session. The Belarus delegation commends the \r\nexcellent outcome of the negotiations and their \r\nco-chairs, Norway and Ecuador. We also note the \r\nflexibility and good will of the delegations of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement, the European Union and the \r\npermanent members of the Security Council, which had \r\na direct and positive influence on the outcome of the \r\nnegotiation process. \r\n Belarus believes that three key elements are \r\nfundamental to the future success of the process of \r\nGeneral Assembly revitalization. First, we need to \r\nstrengthen the practice of holding General Assembly \r\nthematic debates on topical issues on the international \r\nagenda, follow up on their development in open-ended \r\nworking groups, and adopt relevant resolutions. \r\nSecondly, we need to increase public awareness of the \r\nwork of the General Assembly, including through the \r\nmost up-to-date media outlets and new technology. \r\nThirdly, we need to implement the provisions of all \r\nprevious resolutions on revitalizing the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n In the kaleidoscope of United Nations reform, \r\nmost attention is paid to Security Council reform. In \r\nthat regard, we call on Member States to accelerate the \r\nsearch for a compromise solution to expanding the \r\nCouncil’s composition and improving the effectiveness \r\nof its work. \r\n Belarus pays particular attention to the United \r\nNations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic \r\nRadiation. We are convinced that expanding the \r\nmembership of the Committee will help both to \r\nstrengthen its scientific capacity and to increase its \r\nauthority. We are particularly concerned by the lack of \r\ndecisiveness on Committee membership and its \r\npotential negative impact on the quality of the \r\nCommittee’s work. In that regard, Belarus welcomes \r\nthe General Assembly’s intention to consider bringing \r\nnew members onto the Committee by the end of the \r\nsixty-fourth session. We note the timeliness of the \r\nSecretariat’s proposal on providing financial resources \r\nnecessary to the Committee’s work, and call upon \r\ndelegations to support those proposals in the \r\nframework of the draft budget discussions in the Fifth \r\nCommittee. \r\n Mr. Benítez Versón (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThe United Nations has a crucial role to play in the \r\nfollow-up of its major conferences and summits. That \r\nrole is of particular relevance given the current \r\ninternational context characterized by the \r\ninterconnection of multiple crises, among which we \r\nunderscore the serious financial and economic crisis, \r\none of the most serious obstacles to the development of \r\nthe nations of the South. \r\n In the current state of affairs, it is clear that the \r\nauthority of this world forum derives, among other \r\nthings, from the fact that its representative nature and \r\nlegitimacy cannot be replaced by exclusive clubs of \r\ncountries seeking to manipulate the international \r\n A/64/PV.47\r\n \r\n7 09-60826 \r\n \r\ndecision-making process in economic and financial \r\nmatters. Today more than ever, the voices of all \r\ncountries, especially the smallest and poorest, must be \r\nduly heeded and addressed. That is why Cuba supports \r\nthe holding of a high-level plenary meeting of the \r\nGeneral Assembly next year as a follow-up to the \r\ncommitments made 10 years ago in the Millennium \r\nDeclaration and, in particular, those that address \r\ndevelopment. \r\n The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that \r\nwe agreed at that time, together with other goals that \r\nare no less important in the area of development and \r\nthat have been established in the outcome documents \r\nof the major summits and conferences that preceded \r\nthat historic event, must be the centre of our analysis in \r\n2010. That occasion should not only reaffirm \r\ndocuments and reiterate agreed language; it should also \r\nallow for an in-depth analysis of the root causes of the \r\npersistence of poverty and underdevelopment. It should \r\nalso serve as an opportunity to propose concrete \r\nmeasures and viable alternative for eradicating poverty. \r\n 2010 should also see a review of the \r\ncommitments made regarding sustainable development \r\nof the small island developing States. Cuba is one such \r\nState and will participate actively in that process, \r\nwhich should focus on an objective analysis of the \r\ntargets agreed upon at the historic conferences of \r\nBarbados and Mauritius. \r\n Cuba reaffirms the importance of redoubling \r\nefforts to achieve gender equality and the \r\nempowerment of women. The 2010 assessment of \r\nprogress made towards achieving the MDGs will be a \r\nkey moment for consideration of those topics. \r\n Prior to that meeting, we will have several \r\nopportunities to carry out an in-depth analysis of the \r\nmeasures necessary to overcome the remaining \r\nobstacles and the new challenges to the achievement of \r\nthe MDGs. Those opportunities include the 15-year \r\nreview of the implementation of the Beijing \r\nDeclaration and Platform for Action and of the results \r\nof the twenty-third special session of the General \r\nAssembly, to be carried out during the fifty-fourth \r\nsession of the Commission on the Status of Women, in \r\nMarch of 2010. There will also be the annual \r\nministerial review of the Economic and Social Council, \r\ndedicated to implementing the internationally agreed \r\ngoals and commitments in regard to gender equality \r\nand the empowerment of women. \r\n Climate change has recently captured the \r\nattention of the entire world, as the Copenhagen \r\nsummit draws closer. What is worrisome, however, is \r\nalthough there is full awareness of the serious danger \r\nthat climate change represents for humanity, the \r\nnegotiations leading up to Copenhagen have not been \r\nable to make as much progress as we had hoped and as \r\nwas needed. \r\n We have been denouncing the cause of that \r\nstagnation for quite some time, and that is the lack of \r\nfirm political will on the part of the developed \r\ncountries when it comes to committing to reducing \r\ntheir emissions to a level that is proportional to their \r\nhistorical and current responsibilities and in keeping \r\nwith the parameters suggested by scientific \r\nevaluations. Those countries are also reluctant to \r\ncontribute the resources and technologies necessary to \r\nenable developing countries to tackle the phenomenon \r\nof climate change. \r\n Unfortunately, everything seems to point to the \r\nfact that the Copenhagen conference will not attain the \r\nresults that the majority hoped for. It seems that once \r\nagain the adoption of the concrete and binding \r\ncommitments that we are calling for will be postponed. \r\nHow long will we have to wait while the future of all \r\nof all humanity is in danger?  \r\n The manner in which we confront climate change \r\ntoday will have a direct effect on the development \r\nprospects for a great portion of humanity. The \r\nachievement of a fair and balanced agreement on \r\nclimate change is still possible if we approach the \r\nprocess of negotiations with a new political attitude. \r\nThe battle against climate change can and must be \r\nwon. Let us not wait until it is too late. \r\n Mr. Gutiérrez (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): On \r\n24 October we commemorated the sixty-fourth \r\nanniversary of the entry into force of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. During that 64 years Peru has actively \r\nparticipated in the work of the Organization with the \r\nsame conviction: that multilateralism is the most \r\npropitious road for building a better world. Thus we \r\nwelcome with great satisfaction the new momentum \r\nthat States are giving multilateralism as an area for \r\npolitical dialogue and cooperation with which the \r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century can be tackled. \r\n One of the most meaningful achievements of the \r\nUnited Nations in that context was the Millennium \r\nSummit, which in 2000 adopted the Millennium \r\nA/64/PV.47  \r\n \r\n09-60826 8 \r\n \r\nDeclaration (resolution 55/2). That document has a \r\nspecial historical value that recognizes the collective \r\nresponsibility of Governments to work for equality and \r\nequity and to ensure that the benefits of globalization \r\nwill be shared equally. The Summit established eight \r\ngoals to be met by 2015, which brought together the \r\ncommitments undertaken by the United Nations during \r\nthe last decade of the twentieth century. \r\n Since the start the State of Peru has taken those \r\neight goals — seven of which have established \r\ntimetables — on board as the guiding axis of its social \r\npolicy in fighting poverty and promoting inclusion. \r\nToday we are beginning to see the results of that, as \r\nwas confirmed on 15 October 2009 by the United \r\nNations Development Programme in its 2008 report on \r\nthe implementation of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. \r\n The report confirms the progress made by Peru in \r\nreducing poverty levels from 54.4 per cent in 1991 to \r\n36 per cent in 2008 and in reducing the level of \r\nextreme poverty from 23 per cent to 12.6 per cent over \r\nthe same period. Thus the goal of reducing by half the \r\nnumber of individuals whose incomes are below the \r\nextreme poverty line is about to be achieved in Peru. \r\n In the area of education, we have almost achieved \r\nuniversal primary education in Peru. The illiteracy rate \r\nhas been reduced from 18.1 per cent in 1991 to 6 per \r\ncent in the year 2008. \r\n In the area of basic services, the homes with \r\npotable water increased from 49 per cent in 1991 to an \r\nestimated 80 per cent in 2009. Meanwhile, the homes \r\nwith electricity increased from 46 per cent to 80 per \r\ncent during the same period. \r\n With regard to health, overall malnutrition has \r\ngone from 10 per cent in 2004 to 5 per cent in 2008. \r\nChronic child malnutrition has dropped from 25.4 per \r\ncent to 21.9 per cent during the same period. Mortality \r\nfor children less than five years of age has also been \r\nreduced by 68 per cent, which means that we will \r\ncomply with this goal eight years before the deadline. \r\n It is important to underscore, however, that there \r\nare many illnesses that were not explicitly included in \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals but that seriously \r\naffect countries such as Peru. They include \r\nnon-transmittable diseases such as heart disease, \r\nstroke, cancer, hypertension, chronic respiratory \r\nillnesses and diabetes. We must also highlight the \r\ndeaths and injuries that result from traffic accidents. \r\nAll of this confirms that there is an urgent need to \r\nevaluate the advisability of promoting the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals Plus, which have as their principal \r\naxis the fight against non-transmittable diseases and \r\ninjuries. \r\n My Government is committed to continue to \r\nallocate the greatest possible resources to fighting not \r\njust the consequences of underdevelopment but its \r\ncomplex causes. In the framework of the current \r\neconomic and financial crisis, it is urgent that we \r\nreaffirm the commitments taken on in the Millennium \r\nGoals, as the various areas they address are essential to \r\nimproving the well-being of developing countries. \r\n In that context, we wish to reiterate our concern \r\nabout the alarming sums that are allocated around the \r\nworld to acquiring weapons, amounts that increases \r\nsteadily every year in the midst of one of the most \r\nserious global economic recessions. The increase in \r\nmilitary expenditures has a direct impact on our \r\ncountries’ capacity to fight hunger and poverty and \r\nattain the Millennium Development Goals. Therefore \r\nwe believe that it is essential to strengthen the direct \r\nlink between disarmament and development. \r\n The crisis also causes problems in terms of \r\nmobilizing resources for global initiatives to fight \r\nclimate change. Peru is among the countries that are \r\nparticularly vulnerable to climate change without being \r\namong its principal producers. The great efforts that \r\nmy country must undertake in allocating resources to \r\nadaptation will reduce our capacity to address the other \r\nneeds of our population and, consequently, to continue \r\nworking effectively towards the attainment of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, especially the fight \r\nagainst poverty. \r\n With that in mind, the Copenhagen conference in \r\nDecember should face the challenge of financing \r\nmeasures to adapt to climate change and of mitigating \r\nits effects. Peru has presented specific proposals in that \r\narea that we hope can be considered at the conference. \r\nWe also wish to note that the illicit production of coca \r\nleaves is one of the greatest factors in the depredation \r\nof nature. The felling and burning of forests in order to \r\nincrease illegal farming causes soil erosion and has led \r\nto the deforestation of more than 2.5 million hectares \r\nof the Amazon forest, making this phenomenon one of \r\nthe principal contributors to global warming. \r\n A/64/PV.47\r\n \r\n9 09-60826 \r\n \r\n We have stated in the General Assembly that it is \r\nurgent that we make the fight against drug trafficking a \r\ncentrepiece of the international agenda and of the \r\ncooperation agenda of developed countries, under the \r\nprinciple of shared but differentiated responsibility. \r\n We have taken note of the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on climate change and its possible security \r\nimplications (A/64/350). It contains elements that we \r\nwill study with the necessary care. \r\n In this crisis scenario it is necessary to revitalize \r\nthe United Nations system for development. We must \r\ntake advantage of the unique role that the Organization \r\nplays as an inclusive forum for promoting a better \r\nunderstanding of the social and economic effects of the \r\ncrisis and formulating appropriate responses for \r\novercoming the challenges that we now face. \r\n Along these lines, we are looking to the high-\r\nlevel meeting that the General Assembly has decided to \r\nhold in 2010, at the beginning of its sixty-fifth session, \r\nwith heads of State and Government participating, at \r\nwhich there will be a review of the progress towards \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals and in \r\nwhich we will be participating with great interest at the \r\nhighest possible level. \r\n Mr. Maurer (Switzerland): I would like to touch \r\non two issues under agenda item 114, first on armed \r\nviolence and development, and then on the high-level \r\nevent of September 2010.  \r\n I shall first speak as chair of the Core Group \r\nleading the implementation of the Geneva Declaration \r\non Armed Violence and Development. The Core Group \r\nis comprised of Brazil, Colombia, Finland, Guatemala, \r\nIndonesia, Kenya, Morocco, the Netherlands, Norway, \r\nthe Philippines, Spain, Thailand, the United Kingdom \r\nand Switzerland. \r\n The Core Group welcomes the recommendations \r\nmade in the report of the Secretary-General under \r\nreview (A/64/228). The report was published pursuant \r\nto resolution 63/23, which was adopted by consensus \r\nduring the sixty-third session of the General Assembly. \r\nI take this opportunity to congratulate the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on this substantive work. \r\n The Core Group is very pleased with the report’s \r\ndetailed analysis of the relationship between armed \r\nviolence and development and its discussion on the \r\nhuman, social and economic costs related to armed \r\nviolence. The report acknowledges that armed violence \r\nconstitutes not only a humanitarian challenge but also \r\nan obstacle to development and, ultimately, to the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals. \r\n We believe that the report contains solid elements \r\nthat will help advance the agenda on armed violence \r\nand development. In particular, it highlights the main \r\nchallenges ahead while providing the international \r\ncommunity with a set of concrete and targeted \r\nmeasures. The report also highlights the importance of \r\nstrengthening national and local capacities with a view \r\nto preventing and reducing armed violence. In addition, \r\nit values the essential contribution made by multilateral \r\nand bilateral agencies in supporting the efforts of \r\nGovernments to combat armed violence. \r\n Following on recommendation (h) in the report, \r\nwhich invites Member States to build a greater \r\nawareness of the negative impact of armed violence on \r\ndevelopment, the Core Group would like to initiate an \r\nopen and transparent process with a view to \r\nformulating the core elements of a possible resolution \r\nduring the current session. This open-ended process \r\nintends to allow a broad and inclusive debate on the \r\nsubstance of the report and on the recommendations it \r\nmakes, as well as on the ways and means to foster \r\ngreater international action. This approach will be \r\nparticularly important in view of the high-level plenary \r\nmeeting of the sixty-fifth session of the General \r\nAssembly in September 2010.  \r\n Our open-ended process will come with a series \r\nof events on several aspects covered in the report in \r\norder to make Member States aware of the importance \r\nof reducing armed violence as a means of enabling \r\ndevelopment and ultimately the attainment of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. This series of events \r\nstarts at 1.15 p.m. today with a side event to be held in \r\nConference Room 4. Furthermore, the Core Group \r\nbelieves that enhancing development would be one of \r\nthe key contributing factors to the prevention and \r\nreduction of armed violence. It is our hope that \r\nMember States will make full use of this forum to \r\nexplore the ways and means to ensure people-centred \r\ndevelopment and hence to reduce the motive to resort \r\nto armed violence. \r\n To conclude, on behalf of the Core Group, I \r\nwould like to encourage all Member States to \r\nparticipate actively in the discussions to come. I hereby \r\nencourage those Member States that have not yet done \r\nA/64/PV.47  \r\n \r\n09-60826 10 \r\n \r\nso to subscribe to the Geneva Declaration and its \r\nprinciples. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n On behalf of Switzerland, I would now like to \r\nspeak about the high-level meeting of the General \r\nAssembly that will take place next year. \r\n Ten years after the Millennium Declaration and \r\nfive years after the 2005 Summit — two events that \r\nprovided important blueprints for addressing key \r\nchallenges and strengthening the ability of the United \r\nNations to deliver on its mandates — leaders will again \r\nconvene in September 2010 at the opening of the sixty-\r\nfifth session of the General Assembly. \r\n Since those two historic events, the international \r\ncontext has changed, presenting new challenges and \r\nopportunities. The recent food, economic and financial \r\ncrisis as well as global climate change have highlighted \r\nnew aspects of insecurity, vulnerability and poverty. \r\nThese global challenges have also strongly emphasized \r\nthe characteristic interdependence of our world, where \r\ntoday issues that concern us are more strongly \r\ninterlinked than ever and cannot be dealt with in \r\nisolation. \r\n Development is no exception. For our leaders to \r\nbe in a position to take stock next year of the current \r\nchallenges directly affecting development and to \r\ndiscuss specific action to address them, they will have \r\nto take into account the multiple correlations between, \r\nfor example, between climate change and development, \r\nbetween peace and security and development, or \r\nbetween the global economy and development. In our \r\nview, that holistic approach is critical to enabling the \r\n2010 summit to reflect the broad context in which \r\ndevelopment challenges are embedded. \r\n Since the year 2000, the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) have been shown to be a \r\npowerful vector for political action, and these time-\r\nbound targets, inter alia, will continue to inspire our \r\ncommon efforts for development. In 2008, in the \r\nframework of the High-level Event on the MDGs in \r\n2008, our leaders reviewed at length the progress \r\nmade, took stock of remaining gaps in the global effort \r\nto achieve the established goals and identified concrete \r\naction needed on a global scale to meet them. The 2010 \r\nsummit should therefore build on that meeting, as well \r\nas on others, and avoid reiterating debates and the \r\nconclusions already reached in 2008. \r\n Next fall, our leaders should also assess the status \r\nof the global partnership for development called for by \r\nthe Millennium Declaration. For a true and effective \r\npartnership, we need stronger international institutions. \r\nIn this regard, we cannot overemphasize the central \r\nrole of the United Nations or the need for reforms \r\nessential to make the United Nations a more efficient, \r\neffective and coherent platform for carrying out the \r\ninternational effort for peace, security and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n The growing interdependence of nations and the \r\nincreasing interconnection of global threats are a \r\nchallenge to all countries, all institutions and the global \r\ngovernance system as a whole. We are convinced that \r\nthe 2010 summit is an opportunity to demonstrate that \r\nthe United Nations is capable of taking on those \r\ncomplex issues. It is also a key moment to reaffirm that \r\nthe United Nations remains the only universal and \r\nlegitimate platform for dealing with and collecting in \r\none forum the challenges whose interconnections are \r\nevident on a planetary scale, affecting development and \r\nthe global context in which we all live. \r\n Ms. Ross (United States of America): The United \r\nStates welcomes the important report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the implementation of the United Nations \r\nComprehensive Strategy on Assistance and Support to \r\nVictims of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse by United \r\nNations Staff and Related Personnel (A/64/176). We \r\nare gratified to note that the United Nations system is \r\ntaking action to institutionalize implementation of this \r\nimportant pillar of the Organization’s response to \r\nsexual exploitation and abuse by United Nations staff \r\nand related personnel. The victims of such abuse are \r\nbeginning to receive the assistance they need to \r\naddress the very real needs arising out of these \r\nreprehensible acts. \r\n We appreciate the frankness on how the Strategy \r\nis being implemented in practice by humanitarian and \r\npeacekeeping missions that are operating in often \r\ndifficult circumstances. We welcome the recognition \r\nthat, while such misconduct is the exception, as it \r\nshould be, it is committed by all categories of \r\npersonnel and that therefore measures to prevent and \r\naddress sexual exploitation and abuse must be taken \r\nthroughout the United Nations system and should \r\ninclude clear standards of conduct for contractors and \r\nother partners. \r\n A/64/PV.47\r\n \r\n11 09-60826 \r\n \r\n We note that the report indicates varying levels of \r\ncoordination among United Nations agencies at the \r\ncountry level on implementing measures to assist \r\nvictims of sexual exploitation and abuse. The work \r\nalready being done to use existing legal, medical and \r\nother community programmes is very useful. \r\n We would also like to call attention to other \r\npractical steps being taken to strengthen \r\nimplementation of the Strategy. For example, the report \r\nnotes that the United Nations Development Group has \r\napproved revised job descriptions for managers that \r\ninclude responsibility for coordinating implementation \r\nof the Strategy. That is exactly the kind of measure that \r\nensures that busy leaders see this as a priority. Another \r\nsuch example is the inclusion of clauses in contracts \r\nthat would establish for such contractors appropriate \r\nstandards of conduct. The United States believes that \r\nthere is a clear need for continuing reporting on the \r\nimplementation of this Strategy. In this regard, we look \r\nforward to exploring what additional measures might \r\nbe needed to strengthen and institutionalize application \r\nof the Strategy. \r\n We wish to express both our appreciation of the \r\nwork that has already been done and our recognition of \r\nthe enormous challenges ahead. The United States \r\nreiterates its support for the Secretary-General’s zero-\r\ntolerance policy and calls on all Member States to \r\nstrengthen their resolve to change the culture of \r\nimpunity that allows such reprehensible acts to take \r\nplace. \r\n Turning to the issue of climate change and its \r\npossible security implications, the United States was \r\npleased to join the list of sponsors of General \r\nAssembly resolution 63/281, on climate change and its \r\npossible security implications, of June 2009 and to \r\nsupport its original proponents, namely the Pacific \r\nsmall island developing States. We also welcomed the \r\nopportunity to provide views on the security \r\nimplications of climate change, as requested in the \r\nresolution. \r\n We were encouraged by the Assembly’s ability to \r\nachieve broad consensus on a resolution concerning the \r\nurgent issue of climate change, particularly in the \r\ncrucial remaining weeks leading to the fifteenth \r\nConference of Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change in \r\nCopenhagen. The Secretary-General’s thoughtful report \r\non the security implications of climate change \r\n(A/64/350) provides a valuable resource for Parties. \r\n When President Obama addressed the General \r\nAssembly in September, he underscored the \r\nseriousness of the challenges we face. At that time he \r\nsaid, “we must recognize that in the twenty-first \r\ncentury there will be no peace unless we take \r\nresponsibility for the preservation of our planet” (see \r\nA/64/PV.3). \r\n The danger posed by climate change cannot be \r\ndenied. Our responsibility to meet it must not be \r\ndeferred. If we continue down our current course, \r\nevery member of this Assembly will see irreversible \r\nchanges within their borders. Our efforts to end \r\nconflicts will be eclipsed by wars over refugees and \r\nresources. Development will be devastated by drought \r\nand famine. Land that human beings have lived on for \r\nmillennia will disappear. Future generations will look \r\nback and wonder why we refused to act, why we failed \r\nto pass on an environment that was worthy of our \r\ninheritance. \r\n The United States has made advancing the \r\nclimate change agenda one of our top priorities at the \r\nUnited Nations. Today’s discussion reinforces our \r\ncollective recognition that global climate change \r\nrequires an urgent response and the widest possible \r\ncooperation by all countries. The United States \r\nreaffirms its commitment to leadership in this critical \r\nglobal endeavour. \r\n Mr. Normandin (Canada): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of Canada, Australia and New Zealand. \r\n Canada, Australia and New Zealand welcome the \r\nreport of the Secretary-General on the implementation \r\nof the United Nations Comprehensive Strategy on \r\nAssistance and Support to Victims of Sexual \r\nExploitation and Abuse by United Nations Staff and \r\nRelated Personnel (A/64/176). \r\n Since the Strategy’s adoption two years ago, \r\nprogress on its implementation has been slow. \r\nHowever, significant inroads have been made towards \r\nensuring that in the future, provision of assistance and \r\nsupport to victims will be possible. The report \r\nidentifies a number of key actions and initiatives that \r\nhave been undertaken since adoption, such as the best \r\npractice series of the Task Force on Protection from \r\nSexual Exploitation and Abuse. The report also \r\ndescribes the challenges facing the Strategy’s \r\nA/64/PV.47  \r\n \r\n09-60826 12 \r\n \r\nimplementation, which include the lack of community-\r\nbased reporting and complaints mechanisms to deal \r\nwith such cases. With an issue as sensitive and \r\npersonal as sexual exploitation and abuse, it is easy to \r\nunderstand that victims may find it difficult to come \r\nforward and report on what they have endured; the \r\nissue of under-reporting is all too familiar in these \r\ncircumstances. \r\n Canada, Australia and New Zealand believe it is \r\nessential that the United Nations system continue its \r\nwork to implement the Strategy, and that this work be \r\nundertaken in a comprehensive, system-wide manner. \r\n In-country mechanisms to facilitate access for \r\nvictims to needed services will not be established, and \r\noverall protection from sexual exploitation and abuse \r\nwill not be achieved, without the whole United Nations \r\nsystem — humanitarian, development and peacekeeping \r\npersonnel — being on board and working together. \r\n It is crucial that work on this Strategy continue so \r\nthat victims are offered the assistance they need and \r\ndeserve. Canada, Australia and New Zealand strongly \r\nendorse continued implementation of the Strategy and \r\nsupport the next steps outlined in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report. \r\n Speaking now in my national capacity, let me \r\nbriefly address the Secretary-General’s report on \r\nclimate change and its possible security implications \r\n(A/64/350), also under agenda item 114. \r\n Canada once again wishes to congratulate the \r\nPacific small island developing States for their \r\nleadership in bringing the issue of security and climate \r\nchange to the forefront of our work at the United \r\nNations. The existential threat facing the Pacific small \r\nislands, in particular, gives this important issue a very \r\nreal, urgent and human dimension. \r\n The global challenge of climate change requires a \r\nglobal response. Internationally, Canada is working \r\ntowards an ambitious post-2012 global climate change \r\nagreement at the fifteenth session of the Conference of \r\nthe Parties to the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change in Copenhagen in early \r\nDecember. \r\n Canada welcomed the adoption of resolution \r\n63/281, on climate change and its possible security \r\nimplications, in June 2009, and we welcome the calls \r\nfor relevant United Nations bodies to intensify their \r\nefforts in considering the possible security implications \r\nof climate change. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n The Secretary-General’s comprehensive report \r\nwill facilitate the exchange among Member States of \r\ndiverse views on this important issue and will help put \r\nour work in context. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to thank the Pacific \r\nsmall island developing States for their leadership on \r\nthis issue. \r\n Mr. Urbina (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish): In \r\n2007, the President of the General Assembly asked me \r\nto coordinate the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group \r\ntasked with drafting a strategy on assistance and \r\nsupport to victims of sexual exploitation and abuse by \r\nunited nations staff and related personnel. Accordingly, \r\ntoday, Costa Rica wishes to refer specifically to that \r\ntopic. \r\n We welcome the measures that have been adopted \r\nand the progress that has been reported in the \r\nSecretary-General’s report on implementation of the \r\nUnited Nations Comprehensive Strategy on Assistance \r\nand Support to Victims of Sexual Exploitation and \r\nAbuse by United Nations Staff and Related Personnel \r\n(A/64/176). When the Open-ended Working Group’s \r\nwork came to an end, I said that it marked a great step \r\nforward in meeting the needs of victims, which should \r\nbe a great source of satisfaction to the United Nations \r\nand to all of us who had participated in drafting the \r\nStrategy. \r\n While the nature and scope of the subject seemed \r\nto raise difficult obstacles to overcome, agreement was \r\npossible thanks to the commitment of all States \r\nMembers of the Organization to help the victims. It \r\nwas particularly important to separate the assistance \r\nstrategy from the policy of zero tolerance, focusing \r\nsolely on the human dimension of assistance and \r\nsupport for victims. \r\n Despite the progress that has already been made, \r\nmuch remains to be done to attain a truly broad focus \r\nfor assistance for victims based on the principles of \r\ncomprehensive protection, solidarity and responsibility. \r\nThe report tells us that the victims of those abuses are \r\nnow beginning to receive basic assistance and support \r\nin a timely manner, in keeping with their specific \r\nneeds. \r\n A/64/PV.47\r\n \r\n13 09-60826 \r\n \r\n Through structures of the United Nations system, \r\nmedical, legal, psychological and social support is \r\nalready being provided, along with urgent support in \r\nthe areas of housing, food and clothing. The Strategy is \r\nan integral part of the measures adopted by the United \r\nNations system to prevent and address sexual abuse \r\nand exploitation by United Nations staff and associated \r\npersonnel. \r\n Here, we view favourably the progress being \r\nmade in the implementation of the Strategy by \r\nhumanitarian, development and peacekeeping \r\npersonnel. We support that comprehensive approach \r\nand we look forward to its consolidation throughout \r\nthe system. We warmly welcome the measures and \r\ninstruments that are being implemented to enhance the \r\nStrategy’s implementation, through the Task Force co-\r\nchaired by the United Nations Office for the \r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the \r\nDepartment of Field Support, and we call for their \r\nstrengthening. \r\n In conclusion, Costa Rica recognizes the work \r\nthat has been done and draws attention to the \r\nremaining challenges. Once again, we call on all \r\nUnited Nations personnel to conduct themselves at the \r\nhighest level of ethical standards. \r\n Mr. Midekssa (Ethiopia): My delegation is \r\ngrateful for this opportunity to make some remarks on \r\nagenda item 114, “Follow-up to the outcome of the \r\nMillennium Summit”. My delegation would also like to \r\nexpress its appreciation to the Secretary-General for \r\nhis report under that agenda item, entitled “Climate \r\nchange and its possible security implications” \r\n(A/64/350). \r\n As is reflected in the Secretary-General’s report, \r\nmany Member States, in their submissions, recognize \r\nthat the possible security implications of climate \r\nchange need to be examined in the context of pre-\r\nexisting social, economic and environmental threats, \r\nwhich are key factors in the security of individuals, \r\ncommunities and States. Those assessments are all \r\ncaptured and adequately reflected in the Millennium \r\nDeclaration (resolution 55/2). \r\n The persistence of poverty, hunger and disease, \r\nthe rapid growth of informal urban settlements, \r\ninadequate infrastructure and the growing scarcity of \r\nland, water and other resources are challenges that \r\nmust be effectively addressed to ease the security \r\nimplications of climate change. \r\n In short, threats can be reduced through \r\nsustainable development, including legitimate and \r\neffective governance and institutions, as well as \r\npeaceful dispute resolution. In addition, it has now \r\nbecome apparent that a significant slowdown of growth \r\ncaused by climate change could pose a serious security \r\nthreat to developing countries, by worsening poverty \r\nand desperation. Economic growth should therefore be \r\nfostered so as to strengthen resilience, maintain \r\npolitical stability and promote international \r\ncooperation in addressing the various challenges of \r\nunderprivileged populations. This fact is clearly \r\nreflected in the discussion in the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport of the five channels through which climate \r\nchange could affect security, in which the channel \r\nshowing the relationship between development and \r\npeace is empirically substantiated. Maintaining global \r\npeace and stability requires keeping the momentum of \r\ndevelopment going. \r\n It is in light of this evidence that the emphasis on \r\npreventing the adverse effects of climate change should \r\nbe consistent with the efforts of the United Nations to \r\nmove from a tradition of reaction to one of prevention \r\nand with its emphasis on sustainable development as a \r\ncrucial contributor to conflict prevention. Advancing \r\nsustainable development, building resilience to \r\nphysical and economic shocks, and strengthening \r\ninstitutions are vital to confronting the impact of \r\nclimate change and promoting peace and security. \r\n The impact of climate change on human well-\r\nbeing can be illustrated in various ways. For instance, \r\naccording to the fourth assessment report of the \r\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, cereal \r\nproductivity is expected to decrease in Africa and \r\nsouthern Asia due to climate change. In some African \r\ncountries, yields from rain-fed agriculture could be \r\nreduced by up to 50 per cent by 2020; food security is \r\nlikely to suffer and the risk of hunger to increase. \r\nAfrica is also often seen as a continent where climate \r\nchange could potentially intensify or trigger conflict. \r\nAmong the reasons given are the continent’s reliance \r\non climate-dependent sectors, recent ethnic and \r\npolitical conflict, and fragile States. \r\n Speaking of Africa, we firmly believe that in \r\norder to mitigate the impact of climate change on \r\nhuman well-being, the international community should \r\ntake serious measures to control greenhouse-gas \r\nemissions. It is for this reason that we all expect a \r\nclimate change deal to be sealed in Copenhagen. \r\nA/64/PV.47  \r\n \r\n09-60826 14 \r\n \r\nAfrica, for its part, will for the first time in history \r\nfield a single negotiating team, chaired by Mr. Meles \r\nZenawi, Prime Minister of the Federal Democratic \r\nRepublic of Ethiopia, empowered to negotiate on \r\nbehalf of all the States members of the African Union. \r\nWe believe more important than the challenges will be \r\nthe opportunities opened up by this decision. More \r\nthan 50 countries, more than one fourth of the States \r\nMembers of the United Nations, will speak with one \r\nvoice. That should make the negotiations much more \r\nmanageable than would have been the case in the \r\nabsence of such a decision. Africa’s interests and \r\nposition will not be muffled, as has usually been the \r\ncase, and the problems we discuss here today will \r\ndefinitely surface at the highest level in Copenhagen. \r\n My delegation has also learned from the report \r\nthat climate change has the potential to affect \r\ninternational relations among countries through \r\npossible conflicts of interest over the use of \r\ntransboundary water or other resources that may \r\nbecome increasingly scarce as a result of climate \r\nchange. But we believe that, by fostering cooperation \r\namong States and with the concrete support of the \r\ninternational community, such concerns can be \r\neffectively remedied.  \r\n My delegation also believes that the strategy of \r\nadaptation requires empowering people, building their \r\nresilience, securing their livelihoods, and putting in \r\nplace or strengthening the physical infrastructure \r\nneeded to protect against extreme weather events, as \r\nwell as the institutions and systems needed to cope \r\nwith the consequences of such events. The \r\ninternational community must therefore provide \r\nstronger support for climate-change adaptation in \r\ndeveloping countries, including through investments in \r\ncapacity-building at all levels. \r\n Finally, any failure to effectively implement the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and other \r\ninternationally agreed development goals will \r\nundoubtedly have even worse effects than shattering \r\neconomies; it could rekindle dormant conflicts and \r\nprovoke new ones, thereby precipitating poor countries \r\ninto total disaster. It is therefore imperative for the \r\ninternational community to redouble its efforts to \r\nguarantee the sustainable and equitable development of \r\nall countries, notably by ensuring that developed \r\ncountries meet their international commitments in \r\ndevelopment assistance. This is all the more imperative \r\nin the midst of the current global economic difficulties, \r\nwhich have threatened to set back recent development \r\nprogress in many developing countries. \r\n Mr. McLay (New Zealand): New Zealand thanks \r\nthe Secretary-General for his comprehensive report on \r\nthe possible security implications of climate change \r\n(A/64/350), which results from a specific request in \r\nresolution 63/281 — a historic resolution that New \r\nZealand was proud to co-sponsor, along with 100 other \r\nMember States. \r\n This report comes at a time when the Asia-Pacific \r\nregion has been severely hit by natural disasters, with \r\ndevastating results for many communities, families and \r\nlivelihoods. These recent tragedies have illustrated the \r\nchallenges faced by small island developing States in \r\nparticular, given their small size and specific \r\nvulnerabilities, in responding to natural disasters, \r\nwhether climatic or otherwise. Along with other \r\ndevelopment partners, New Zealand continues to \r\nprovide support to Pacific island countries in \r\naddressing those challenges. \r\n New Zealand made detailed submissions in \r\nrespect to the Secretary-General’s report, which was \r\nbased on the views of Member States and relevant \r\nregional and international organizations. We therefore \r\ndo not intend to comment in detail on this occasion, but \r\nthere are some key points that should be highlighted.  \r\n We are pleased to see the reference to the \r\nCopenhagen summit and look forward to engaging in \r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange process. In particular, we support the report’s \r\ncall for a Copenhagen outcome that is “science-based, \r\ncomprehensive, balanced and equitable and fair” \r\n(A/64/350, para. 26). \r\n New Zealand’s immediate climate change \r\nobjective is to achieve effective and comprehensive \r\nglobal mitigation action to reduce emissions and to \r\nimplement effective adaptation measures. Our aim in \r\nthis context is to build confident, resilient and viable \r\ncommunities and to lessen the impact of climate \r\nchange as a risk multiplier, as identified both in New \r\nZealand’s submission and the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport.  \r\n For those reasons, we are particularly interested \r\nin chapter IX, “The way forward”. The report \r\nrecommends action by the international community, \r\nincluding taking bold steps on climate change and \r\nproviding stronger support for climate change \r\n A/64/PV.47\r\n \r\n15 09-60826 \r\n \r\nadaptation in developing countries. It will be important \r\nthat this adaptation be prioritized to the most \r\nvulnerable, including those in the Pacific. \r\n The report recognizes that such security threats \r\ncan be effectively managed through sustainable \r\ndevelopment measures, but that requires ongoing and \r\nrelevant research. New Zealand is committed to \r\nworking with its Pacific partners to achieve this \r\nthrough a number of bilateral, regional and multilateral \r\ninitiatives. Above all, the report makes clear that the \r\nnature and full extent of the security implications of \r\nclimate change are still largely untested, so it is \r\nimportant that the way forward be guided by robust \r\nempirical evidence, and we agree with that view. \r\n It has been said that the iconic image of climate \r\nchange has been the polar bear on a melting ice floe, \r\nbut in human terms the more compelling image should \r\nbe the citizen of an island State that could over time \r\nbecome devoid of agriculture, diminished in \r\ninfrastructure, reduced in population and, ultimately, \r\nuninhabitable. Whole populations would be on the \r\nmove and already vulnerable communities would be \r\nfurther threatened. Security and other issues would \r\nabound. These issues must be addressed before it is too \r\nlate. And that is the challenge for all of us — for the \r\nUnited Nations and all of its Member States. \r\n Mr. Beck (Solomon Islands): At the outset allow \r\nme, on behalf of my delegation, to thank the President \r\nfor convening this meeting. My delegation also would \r\nlike to thank the Secretary-General for his \r\ncomprehensive report on climate change and its \r\npossible security implications, contained in document \r\nA/64/350. My delegation welcomes the report and \r\nacknowledges the manner in which some of the new \r\nand emerging security threats associated with climate \r\nchange are being addressed. \r\n Solomon Islands associate this statement with the \r\nstatement delivered by Mr. Stuart Beck, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Palau, on behalf of the Pacific small \r\nisland developing States (SIDS). My delegation would \r\nlike to contribute to the debate in our national capacity. \r\n It is clear from the report that there are security \r\nimplications related to climate change that require the \r\ncollective cooperation of the international community \r\nin addressing identified new and emerging climate-\r\nrelated challenges. The report identifies five elements \r\nthat have climate change-related security implications \r\non vulnerable populations globally.  \r\n First is the vulnerability of populations to climate \r\nchange-related threats to their food, water, health and \r\nterritorial security and the entire livelihood of human \r\nsocieties, especially those that are ill equipped to \r\neffectively invest in the implementation of national \r\nadaptation and mitigation activities. Second are threats \r\nto reverse current development processes. Third are \r\nnational capacities to address climate change-related \r\nmigration and displacement of populations, and \r\nconflicts over shared resources such as water sources. \r\nFourthly, the report confirms the threat of statelessness \r\namong SIDS and implications for human rights, \r\nsecurity and sovereignty. Fifthly, there is concern that \r\ninternational conflict could emerge over shared or \r\nundemarcated international resources. \r\n The report also identifies possible threat \r\nminimizers to lower climate change-related insecurity. \r\nOn this issue, we reiterate our call for a mitigation and \r\nadaptation package that provides for the long-term \r\nstabilization of atmospheric greenhouse-gas \r\nconcentrations. \r\n In this connection, we wish to take a piece from \r\nthe Declaration of the Alliance of Small Island States \r\nagreed to by all SIDS at the September summit, and \r\nthat is to adopt a package of mitigation activities \r\nbeyond 2012 that, first, provides long-term \r\nstabilization of atmospheric greenhouse-gas \r\nconcentrations well below 350 parts per million carbon \r\ndioxide-equivalent levels; secondly, ensures that the \r\nglobal average surface temperature increases are \r\nlimited to well below 1.5 degrees Celsius above \r\npre-industrial levels; thirdly, provides for global \r\ngreenhouse-gas emissions to peak by 2015 and to \r\ndecline thereafter; fourthly, reduces global greenhouse-\r\ngas emissions by more than 85 per cent below 1990 \r\nlevels by 2050; and fifthly, calls on countries listed in \r\nAnnex I to the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change to reduce their collective \r\ngreenhouse-gas emissions by more than 45 per cent \r\nbelow 1990 levels by 2020 and by more than 95 per \r\ncent below 1990 levels by 2050, given their historical \r\nresponsibility. \r\n With respect to threat minimizers, democratic \r\ngood governance and strong local and national \r\ninstitutions are needed, as stated in the report. \r\nHowever, every effort must be made to improve the \r\neconomic and trade conditions of these countries to \r\nenable them to effectively invest in the sustainable \r\nfunctioning of such institutions in order to address and \r\nA/64/PV.47  \r\n \r\n09-60826 16 \r\n \r\ncontain climate change threats through mitigation and \r\nadaptation programmes at the national level. \r\n As to international cooperation, it is vitally \r\nimportant to ensure that international commitments \r\nunder the Barbados Programme of Action and the \r\nMauritius Strategy, including the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, are fulfilled to provide an \r\nenabling process for the vulnerable countries to address \r\nthe severe security implications of climate change. The \r\nlack of commitment has pushed SIDS to submit \r\nresolutions recognizing the human dimension of \r\nclimate change, which, as our Charter affirms, is \r\npeople-centred as far as sustainable development is \r\nconcerned. \r\n The same can be said of current climate change \r\nnegotiations. At this defining moment, when leadership \r\nis required, it is not available. My delegation registers \r\nits deep concerns over public statements from some \r\nquarters that we should lower our collective \r\nexpectation of achieving a legally binding agreement in \r\nCopenhagen. We remain positive that a legally binding \r\nagreement is possible in Copenhagen, but it requires \r\npolitical will to present ambitious targets and adequate \r\nresources. We know there is sufficient technology \r\navailable to stabilize our climate. As my delegation \r\nstated in Barcelona, the victims of the lack of action \r\nwill come from the countries of the southern \r\nhemisphere, the vulnerable countries, the SIDS and the \r\nleast developed countries, and not from the Annex I \r\ncountries.  \r\n We therefore call for action and we call for action \r\nnow. We keep saying this; we keep having summits on \r\nclimate change; and yet we have not lived up to what \r\nwe have said. We make this plea on behalf of those who \r\nare living on the edge of climate change and would like \r\nto say that those on the front line will continue to suffer \r\non a daily basis as we continue to postpone action that \r\nis required and is now demanded of us. \r\n Allow me to close by once again thanking the \r\nSecretary-General for his report. We also call on the \r\nSecurity Council to put this matter on its agenda. \r\nAgain, I thank all who are present and have \r\nparticipated in and supported this process for their \r\nsupport in discussing this important subject. \r\n Mr. Goledzinowski (Australia): Australia was \r\nproud to co-sponsor resolution 63/281 on the link \r\nbetween climate change and security, and we are \r\npleased that the Secretary-General\u0027s report (A/64/350) \r\nis being considered today. It is a small but important \r\nstep forward in addressing this serious global \r\nchallenge. \r\n We are now all deeply aware that climate change \r\nhas the potential to exacerbate situations that are \r\nalready fragile and to increase pressures on areas that \r\nare already vulnerable. This report, like the debate that \r\npreceded it, for which we have to remember to thank \r\nthe Pacific small island developing States, contributes \r\nsignificantly to improving our awareness of the \r\npotential implications. \r\n Australia sees effective global and national \r\nefforts to mitigate against and adapt to climate change \r\nas the best way to minimize the impacts of climate \r\nchange and, in turn, any security-related consequences. \r\nWe welcome the report\u0027s emphasis on prevention as the \r\nbest remedy. \r\n Australia is playing its full and fair part in \r\nhelping to shape a global climate change solution. \r\nSome States will be better placed than others to cope \r\nwith the impacts of climate change. Low-lying island \r\nStates, as we have been reminded today, are \r\nparticularly vulnerable. The threats posed by sea-level \r\nrise and increases in extreme weather events will have \r\na particular impact on Australia\u0027s Pacific and Indian \r\nOcean island neighbours. As I said when the resolution \r\nwas adopted, these States have done the least to cause \r\nclimate change, but will be the first to feel its effects. \r\n As the report details, these impacts will likely \r\nthreaten food and water security and vital \r\ninfrastructure and community facilities, and be felt in \r\ntheir economies through reduced income from \r\nagricultural, tourism and fisheries. \r\n Building resilience to climate impacts is therefore \r\nvital to securing livelihoods and helping people have \r\nthe choice to remain in their homes, where that is \r\npossible. That is why Australia is contributing to \r\nadaptation and mitigation activities. We have \r\ncommitted some $150 million under the International \r\nClimate Change Adaptation Initiative to meet high-\r\npriority adaptation needs. We are also contributing to \r\nthe Least Developed Countries Fund under the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change to \r\nsupport the identification and implementation of urgent \r\nadaptation activities. \r\n The international community must remain alert to \r\nthe possible direct and indirect security implications of \r\n A/64/PV.47\r\n \r\n17 09-60826 \r\n \r\nclimate change. As we here in the General Assembly \r\nshould remember, we are the authentic voice of the \r\ninternational community. In adopting resolution 63/281 \r\nand in receiving this report, we have begun to live up \r\nto that obligation.  \r\n The Acting President: In accordance with \r\nresolution 57/32 of 19 November 2002, I now call on \r\nthe Permanent Observer of the Inter-Parliamentary \r\nUnion. \r\n Mrs. Filip (Inter-Parliamentary Union): I am \r\npleased to address the General Assembly at this joint \r\ndebate on the strengthening of the United Nations \r\nsystem and the follow-up to the Millennium Summit. I \r\nam honoured to deliver this statement on behalf of the \r\nPresident of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), \r\nTheo-Ben Gurirab, Speaker of the National Assembly \r\nof Namibia and former President of the General \r\nAssembly.  \r\n Over the past several years, the IPU and the \r\nUnited Nations have been building a strategic \r\npartnership in the pursuit of world peace, development, \r\ndemocracy and human rights. Looking back, I think we \r\ncan agree that important progress has been made, as the \r\nAssembly itself has confirmed through successive \r\nresolutions. \r\n Two years ago, in the fall of 2007, the General \r\nAssembly received an IPU policy paper on the nature \r\nof the relationship between the United Nations and the \r\nworld’s parliaments. Essentially, we view this as a \r\npartnership that needs to be firmly rooted in the \r\nactivities that parliaments carry out at home. The \r\npartnership includes action by parliaments in the light \r\nof their legislative and budgetary functions, as well as \r\nwork by parliaments to contribute to and monitor \r\ninternational negotiations and debates at the United \r\nNations and to ensure national compliance with \r\ninternational norms and the rule of law. It also involves \r\nscrutinizing the activities of the United Nations and \r\ncontributing to its deliberations. \r\n The IPU is convinced that members of parliament \r\ncan play an important part in building national \r\nownership and political support for international \r\naction. In the view of the IPU, which is shared by \r\nmany United Nations Member States, the United \r\nNations stands to gain considerably by making sure \r\nthat parliaments and their members have a full and \r\nundistorted understanding of what is done here at the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n This is the purpose of the Annual Parliamentary \r\nHearing at the United Nations, which the Assembly has \r\nendorsed as a joint United Nations-IPU event and the \r\noutcome report of which is circulated to parliaments \r\nand United Nations Member States. This year\u0027s Hearing \r\ntakes place later this week. It will focus on the \r\ninternational response to the global economic crisis. It \r\nwill bring together legislators from around the world to \r\ninteract with the Assembly and the broader United \r\nNations community, and we encourage permanent \r\nmissions to actively participate. \r\n Like the President of the Assembly and Member \r\nStates, we are also working hard to implement the \r\nrecommendations of resolution 63/24, which was \r\nadopted by consensus exactly one year ago. I would \r\nlike to refer very briefly to just a few of its elements. \r\n First, the General Assembly invited the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission to work with the IPU in \r\nengaging national parliaments in the countries under \r\nconsideration by the Commission in efforts to promote \r\ndemocratic governance, national dialogue and \r\nreconciliation. To that end, we have expanded \r\nprogrammes in Burundi and Sierra Leone in support of \r\nan inclusive political process. More recently, we have \r\nbegun consultations with the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission on the type of capacity-building support \r\nthat could be provided to the Parliament of the Central \r\nAfrican Republic. \r\n Secondly, the IPU has been working closely with \r\nthe Development Cooperation Forum of the Economic \r\nand Social Council to provide a robust parliamentary \r\ncontribution to the Forum and the broader development \r\ncooperation agenda. We have begun a series of case \r\nstudies in Africa on how parliaments relate to the aid \r\neffectiveness agenda, and we are substantively \r\ninvolved in the preparations for the second Forum \r\nsession next year. \r\n Thirdly, that resolution encouraged the IPU to \r\nstrengthen its contribution to the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, particularly as it relates to the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review of the fulfilment of human rights \r\nobligations and commitments by Member States. A \r\nrecent IPU meeting on the Universal Periodic Review \r\nrevealed enormous interest among parliaments in this \r\nprocess, in particular in terms of debating the draft \r\nnational report in parliament before it becomes final \r\nand receiving the outcome of the Universal Periodic \r\nA/64/PV.47  \r\n \r\n09-60826 18 \r\n \r\nReview for further consideration. IPU will seek to \r\nfollow up on these recommendations. \r\n Through these and other efforts in support of \r\nUnited Nations activities, we are trying to help bridge \r\nthe gap between national commitments and national \r\nresponse, and we hope that the IPU and its member \r\nparliaments can hereby make a meaningful \r\ncontribution to the strengthening of the United Nations. \r\n Before I conclude, I would like to say a brief \r\nword on the work ahead. Today and tomorrow, the IPU \r\nPresident is chairing a meeting of the Preparatory \r\nCommittee for the 2010 World Conference of Speakers \r\nof Parliaments. We have a full agenda before us and, as \r\nwas the case during the previous parliamentary \r\nsummits in 2000 and 2005, a significant part of the \r\nspeakers\u0027 reflections will focus on the parliamentary \r\ndimension of the work of the United Nations. We will \r\nbe exploring options to further consolidate the \r\ninstitutional relationship between the United Nations \r\nsystem and the IPU. \r\n We cannot do this alone. It will require \r\nsubstantive consultations at various levels among the \r\nparliamentary leaders themselves, in capitals between \r\nthe legislative and executive branches of Government, \r\nand here at United Nations Headquarters with \r\npermanent representatives and United Nations officials. \r\nWe look forward to working closely with all members \r\nas we undertake this exciting journey. In this process \r\nwe should all keep in mind that we share the common \r\nobjective of strengthening the United Nations as the \r\ncornerstone of multilateral cooperation, consolidating \r\nthe rule of law in international relations and delivering \r\non the legitimate aspirations of our peoples to peace, \r\nfreedom and prosperity. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on these items. The General \r\nAssembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of agenda items 48, 114, 120 and 121. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 43 \r\n \r\nReturn or restitution of cultural property to the \r\ncountries of origin \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/64/303) \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/64/L.17) \r\n \r\n The Acting President: In connection with agenda \r\nitem 43, the Assembly has before it a note by the \r\nSecretary-General transmitting the report of the \r\nDirector-General of the United Nations Educational, \r\nScientific and Cultural Organization, circulated in \r\ndocument A/64/303. \r\n I give the floor to the Permanent Representative \r\nof Greece to introduce draft resolution A/64/L.17 \r\n Mr. Mitsialis (Greece): It is with great honour \r\nand pleasure that I present to the General Assembly, \r\nunder agenda item 43, a draft resolution on the return \r\nor restitution of cultural property to the countries of \r\norigin, contained in document A/64/L.17.  \r\n In recent years, the international community has \r\nbecome increasingly sensitive to this issue and has \r\ndemonstrated its willingness to facilitate the return or \r\nrestitution of cultural property illicitly removed from \r\nits countries of origin. Such removal, especially when \r\nit results from illicit trade, is against all the principles \r\nthat culture stands for. \r\n Culture is the soul of a nation. The illicit removal \r\nor destruction of cultural property deprives peoples of \r\ntheir history and tradition. Restitution is the only \r\nmeans to reverse the damage and reinstate a sense of \r\ndignity. It is therefore of paramount importance that \r\nStates Members of the United Nations continue to \r\ncooperate actively, both bilaterally and in international \r\nforums, in a spirit of mutual understanding and \r\ndialogue with a view to resolving any outstanding \r\nissues in this respect. Such cooperation also constitutes \r\nthe most appropriate way to address the adverse effects \r\nof major political and other upheavals, including armed \r\nconflict, that have provided fertile ground for the loss, \r\ndestruction, removal or illicit movement of cultural \r\nproperty. \r\n In the draft resolution I have the honour to \r\npresent today, we have tried to reflect the latest steps \r\nand activities that have been undertaken by the \r\ninternational community, especially in the framework \r\nof UNESCO, which has a unique responsibility as the \r\nsole agency with a mandate to safeguard and promote \r\nthe world’s cultural resources at all levels. Equally \r\nimportant in this respect is the effective work and the \r\nrelevant recommendations of the UNESCO \r\nIntergovernmental Committee for Promoting the \r\nReturn of Cultural Property to its Countries of Origin \r\nor its Restitution in Case of Illicit Appropriation. \r\n We are confident that the international \r\ncommunity will continue to cooperate towards \r\n A/64/PV.47\r\n \r\n19 09-60826 \r\n \r\nincreased mobilization and action in order to promote \r\nheritage values and to safeguard, return and restitute \r\ncultural property to the countries of origin. Public \r\nawareness is once more a crucial part of this \r\nendeavour, which also involves Governments, civil \r\nsociety, academic and artistic leadership, and, of \r\ncourse, all of us who share a common cultural \r\nheritage — the heritage of humankind. \r\n In this context, I should like to express our \r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General as well to the \r\nDirector-General of UNESCO for the tireless, constant \r\nand meaningful support they have provided on this \r\nissue. \r\n Action on the draft resolution will be taken at a \r\nlater stage. In the meantime, we will consult closely \r\nwith all interested delegations. We look forward to the \r\nadoption of the draft resolution by consensus, as in \r\nprevious years, and with the widest possible \r\nsponsorship. \r\n Mr. Liu Zhenmin (China) (spoke in Chinese): \r\nThe Chinese delegation welcomes the report submitted \r\nby the Secretary-General in document A/64/303 under \r\nagenda item 43, “Return or restitution of cultural \r\nproperty to the countries of origin”, and supports draft \r\nresolution A/64/L.17, submitted by the delegation of \r\nGreece under this agenda item. \r\n Symbolic of the identity of a nation or people, \r\ncultural property represents a valuable asset of human \r\ncivilization. The illicit appropriation of and traffic in \r\ncultural property are a sacrilege against history and \r\ncivilization. While enjoying broad consensus within \r\nthe international community, the protection of cultural \r\nheritage and the promotion of the restitution of cultural \r\nproperty to the countries of origin are also inalienable \r\nand fundamental cultural rights of the people of \r\ncountries of origin, as well as cultural responsibilities \r\nincumbent on all Governments. \r\n In recent years, the issue of returning cultural \r\nproperty has received increasing attention from a \r\ngrowing number of countries. China supports countries \r\nof origin in seeking the return of cultural property of \r\nspiritual and cultural value, and supports the General \r\nAssembly’s resolutions on the return or restitution of \r\ncultural property to the countries of origin, and \r\nresolution 2008/23 of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil, entitled “Protection against trafficking in \r\ncultural property”. We reiterate the need for the \r\ninternational community to prevent and combat all \r\naspects of trafficking in cultural property, including the \r\ntransfer, through auction or other means, of cultural \r\nproperty that was illegally removed from its countries \r\nof origin. \r\n Strengthening international cooperation is an \r\neffective way to prevent and combat trafficking in \r\ncultural property. States should comply in good faith \r\nwith international legal frameworks and principles \r\nrelating to this issue, cooperate actively with relevant \r\nUnited Nations bodies and international organizations \r\nin joint efforts to combat the smuggling of and \r\ntrafficking in cultural property, and enhance bilateral \r\nand multilateral cooperation in promoting the return of \r\ncultural property.  \r\n China commends the efforts made in this regard \r\nby UNESCO, an important global body engaged in the \r\nprotection of cultural resources. We support \r\nUNESCO’s expansion of its advocacy activities to \r\nraise public awareness; to bring to the attention of \r\nGovernments, civil society, academic institutions, \r\nmuseums and art market operators the harm resulting \r\nfrom such traffic in and transfer of cultural property \r\nillegally taken abroad; and to advance bilateral and \r\nmultilateral cooperation in the interest of the return of \r\ncultural property. \r\n The Chinese Government attaches great \r\nimportance to the protection of cultural heritage. We \r\nhave put in place a legal and regulatory system with \r\nthe Cultural Relics Protection Law at its core. Positive \r\nresults have been achieved in areas of inventory \r\narchiving, security and safeguard-building, market \r\nmanagement and publicity campaigning. China is now \r\nparty to the Convention Concerning the Protection of \r\nthe World Cultural and Natural Heritage; the \r\nConvention on the Means of Prohibiting and \r\nPreventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of \r\nOwnership of Cultural Property; the Convention on \r\nStolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects; and the \r\nConvention for the Protection of Cultural Property in \r\nthe Event of Armed Conflict. China took an active part \r\nin the drafting of UNESCO\u0027s Declaration of Principles \r\nRelating to cultural objects displaced in connection \r\nwith the Second World War. It has signed bilateral \r\nagreements with many countries on the prevention of \r\nthe illicit appropriation, excavation and entry and exit \r\nof cultural objects, and has, on multiple occasions via \r\ninternational cooperation, successfully sought and \r\nretrieved such objects that had been illegally \r\ntransported overseas. \r\nA/64/PV.47  \r\n \r\n09-60826 20 \r\n \r\n For an extended period beginning in the mid-\r\nnineteenth century, the western Powers, in a succession \r\nof wars of aggression against China, plundered and \r\nlooted countless Chinese cultural relics, including \r\nnumerous cultural treasures from Yuan Ming Yuan \r\nSummer Palace. Those relics should be returned to \r\nChina.  \r\n China insists on its right to seek the return of \r\ncultural relics that have been illegally taken abroad. It \r\nopposes auctions of cultural relics illegally taken from \r\nChina, including treasures from the Yuan Ming Yuan \r\nSummer Palace. We believe that such auctions run \r\ncounter to the underlying spirit of the relevant \r\ninternational treaties and United Nations resolutions. \r\nThey also represent serious infringements of China’s \r\ncultural rights and interests. \r\n China will continue to actively participate in \r\nUNESCO activities aimed at promoting the return of \r\ncultural property to its countries of origin. We shall \r\nalso seek appropriate solutions in that regard, thereby \r\nmaking our due contribution to the protection of \r\ninternational cultural heritage. \r\n Mr. Chávez (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): Cultural \r\nheritage is the inheritance of physical and non-physical \r\nproperty that our ancestors have bequeathed to us in \r\nthe course of history. That cultural property makes it \r\npossible for us to forge an identity in order to know \r\nwho we are and where we came from, as well as to \r\ndevelop as individuals in our societies. States therefore \r\nhave the right and obligation to protect their cultural \r\nheritage. \r\n Protection cannot be done in an isolated way, as \r\nonly a portion of cultural heritage is in State hands. \r\nThat is why we need the cooperation of other \r\nstakeholders, such as museums, artistic institutions, art \r\ndealers and society as a whole. All of them must work \r\ntogether to prevent the loss, destruction, removal, theft, \r\nransacking and illicit trafficking in, or improper \r\nacquisition of, cultural property, including any damage \r\nor act of vandalism. \r\n That task, arduous in and of itself, is made even \r\nmore difficult when it comes to cultural heritage that is \r\nnot under the jurisdiction of the State of origin. \r\nUnfortunately, that situation penalizes countries with \r\nfewer resources. It is therefore necessary to develop \r\ninternational mechanisms that promote cooperation and \r\nsupport the efforts made by States to protect their \r\ncultural heritage. The best way to do that is to return \r\nillegally gained cultural property to the country of \r\norigin. The international community has at its disposal \r\nsignificant norms in this area. It should ensure that \r\nthey are applied. \r\n For its part, Peru has ratified the main \r\ninternational legal instruments, including the \r\nConvention for the Protection of Cultural Property in \r\nthe Event of Armed Conflict and its two protocols, the \r\nConvention on the Means of Prohibiting and \r\nPreventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of \r\nOwnership of Cultural Property and the International \r\nInstitute for the Unification of Private Law’s \r\nConvention on Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural \r\nObjects. We have also enacted various bilateral \r\nagreements in this connection. We call on States that \r\nhave not yet done so to adhere to or ratify the various \r\ninternational instruments to which I have referred. \r\n The existence of an international legal framework \r\nis essential, but it is not enough. Effectively protecting \r\ncultural heritage requires that States fully comply with \r\ntheir international commitments in this field. It also \r\nrequires technical, financial and judicial cooperation to \r\nfacilitate return and restitution procedures for cultural \r\nproperty. It is equally necessary for there to be \r\ncooperation between the stakeholders involved. It must \r\nbe underscored that it is they who provide information \r\nto the relevant authorities about the property in their \r\npossession. In many cases, it is also they who \r\nvoluntarily return property that came into their \r\npossession after having been illegally acquired. That \r\npractice of voluntary return should be acknowledged \r\nand encouraged.  \r\n We are pleased that significant efforts are being \r\nmade with regard to returning cultural heritage, as \r\nindicated in the report of the United Nations \r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization \r\n(UNESCO) on the measures that have been taken to \r\nreturn such property to their countries of origin (see \r\nA/64/303). That document, for which we are grateful, \r\nis a comprehensive report on the efforts that are being \r\nmade in this area. I should like to make special \r\nmention of the UNESCO database of national cultural \r\nheritage laws, which is a very valuable tool for \r\nlearning about how States regulate and implement \r\ninternal procedures. It is therefore essential that States \r\nthat have not yet done so submit information about \r\ntheir cultural heritage laws as soon as possible. States \r\nthat have already done so should now implement those \r\nlaws. \r\n A/64/PV.47\r\n \r\n21 09-60826 \r\n \r\n However, the report also identifies areas where \r\nreinforcement is necessary. In that connection, it is \r\nurgent to implement the recommendations made by the \r\nUNESCO Intergovernmental Committee for Promoting \r\nthe Return of Cultural Property to its Countries of \r\nOrigin or its Restitution in Case of Illicit \r\nAppropriation. Those recommendations were adopted \r\nin November 2008, with the active participation of my \r\ncountry. The goals should be to substantially increase \r\nthe return or restitution of cultural property. \r\n Another area in which strengthening is required is \r\nthe fight against impunity for those who traffic in \r\ncultural property. We should put in place mechanisms \r\nfor the investigation, control, detention and prosecution \r\nof persons associated with the illicit trafficking in \r\ncultural property. Their links to other types of \r\norganized crime are increasingly close and troubling. \r\nIn order to put an end to such illegal activity, we must \r\nseverely punish all those who are guilty of it.  \r\n Regional cooperation mechanisms can, and \r\nshould, play a leading role in the return and restitution \r\nof cultural property to the country of origin. We are \r\ngrateful for the efforts made by the International \r\nCriminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) and the \r\nAndean Community, along with the Peruvian \r\nGovernment, to organize a capacity-building workshop \r\non the illicit trade in cultural property. We urge other \r\nStates and regional bodies to emulate that positive \r\nexperience. In that regard, I would like to express our \r\nreadiness to cooperate in sharing our experiences.  \r\n Peru is continuing its efforts to recover cultural \r\nproperty that was illicitly taken from our territory or \r\nwhich has not been returned in a timely manner. \r\nThanks to the assistance and cooperation of various \r\ncountries, we have been successful in recovering pieces \r\nthat have incalculable cultural value. Peru is \r\ncooperating with other States with equal determination. \r\nThis year, we were pleased to return to the Iraqi \r\nauthorities and people three cuneiform clay tablets \r\ndating to between the third and first centuries before \r\nChrist, which were seized in my country from \r\ninternational traffickers. \r\n By reclaiming its own cultural property and \r\nreturning seized cultural property to its legitimate \r\nowners Peru is not merely meeting its obligations, it is \r\nacting in that way because it believes that this is about \r\na moral obligation. The return and restitution of \r\ncultural property does not just entail legal, \r\narchaeological and political aspects. It is also, above \r\nall, a matter of ethics. The ethical and moral \r\ncomponent is especially relevant when it comes to \r\ncultural property exported for the purposes of display, \r\nrestoration or study that has not been returned to the \r\ncountry of origin in a timely manner. We must not \r\ncondone such situations. Property must be returned \r\nimmediately to its legitimate owners.  \r\n A concrete example in that regard is the efforts \r\nbeing made by Peru to recover the large number of \r\nitems extracted from Machu Picchu, one the seven \r\nwonders of the modern world, that are still housed in \r\nthe Peabody Museum at Yale University in the United \r\nStates. We regret that the dialogue to ensure the return \r\nof that property has not borne fruit and that it has been \r\nnecessary to have recourse to the legal route. We \r\nbelieve that justice will determine that we are right. \r\nNevertheless, that does not alter our belief that, before \r\nresorting to legal mechanisms, States should redouble \r\ntheir efforts to resolve disputes pertaining to the return \r\nand restitution of cultural property by friendly means \r\nusing negotiation or other complementary methods. \r\n We are certain that we have right on our side. We \r\nshall continue to work tirelessly to ensure that our \r\ncultural property returns to where it belongs. \r\n Mr. Kuma (Ethiopia): At the outset, my \r\ndelegation would like to express its profound \r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for his note \r\ntransmitting the comprehensive report on the agenda \r\nitem under consideration (A/64/303). My delegation \r\nalso commends the increased role played by the United \r\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural \r\nOrganization (UNESCO) in combating illegal \r\ntrafficking in cultural property. We also commend the \r\nIntergovernmental Committee for promoting the return \r\nof cultural property to its countries of origin. \r\n The issue of the return or restitution of cultural \r\nproperty to the countries of origin is an area in which \r\ninternational relations are put to the test. Because of \r\ntheir invaluable aesthetic significance and the pivotal \r\nrole they play in preserving and recording the talents \r\nand endurance of humanity, my delegation attaches \r\nparticular importance to this agenda item. The return of \r\ndisplaced cultural property is a fundamental means of \r\nrestoring and reconstructing a people’s heritage and \r\nidentity. It also creates dialogue among civilizations in \r\nan atmosphere of mutual respect. And it also has to do \r\nwith the inalienable attribute of sovereignty of every \r\nA/64/PV.47  \r\n \r\n09-60826 22 \r\n \r\npeople by which they should have access to and be able \r\nto enjoy the irreplaceable symbols of their heritage. \r\nThere is strong sentiment today that neither the \r\nexistence of universal museums nor their \r\nmultiplication in different sites in the future can \r\nsubstitute for the bond that exists between a cultural \r\nobject and the societies of yesterday, today and \r\ntomorrow. \r\n Although Ethiopia has enjoyed a long history of \r\nindependence, we have suffered from the repeated \r\nlooting and systematic smuggling of our cultural \r\nheritage, dating from early periods to the religious \r\nwars of the sixteenth century. The looting of an infinite \r\nvariety of artefacts and innumerable manuscripts has \r\nresulted in an immense depletion of Ethiopia’s cultural \r\nheritage. \r\n In recent years, a new wind of optimism has \r\nappeared on the horizon. After many years of \r\nnegotiation, Italy has returned the Axum Obelisk to \r\nEthiopia. Given the beginning of a new chapter in our \r\nrelations with Italy, we would like to take this \r\nopportunity once again to thank the Government and \r\npeople of Italy for that magnanimous act. We believe \r\nthat others will also now start the process of returning \r\nthe remaining objects, which include manuscripts, \r\nworks of art and religious and cultural artefacts. \r\n In this era of globalization, it is important for \r\nnations to be able to preserve their historical and \r\ncultural identity, while at the same time working \r\ntogether and cooperating to overcome global \r\nchallenges. Cultural property serves as a link between \r\npast, present and future. There is no disagreement that \r\ncultural property is a basic element of civilization and \r\nnational heritage. As various United Nations and \r\nAfrican Union resolutions have underlined, many \r\ncountries of origin attach great importance to the return \r\nof cultural property. In certain cases, cultural heritage \r\nconstitutes the repository of fundamental spiritual and \r\ncultural values. The cultural wealth of Ethiopia \r\nsymbolizes its national pride and its unity in diversity. \r\n In conclusion, Ethiopia strongly believes that \r\ncooperation with regard to returning cultural property \r\nshould be a matter of ethics. Fundamental moral \r\nprinciples and the return of property are directly linked \r\nto being human. Cooperation, partnership and good \r\nwill should be strengthened. The role of organizations \r\nengaged in that process should be enhanced by \r\nproviding the necessary means, resources and \r\ninfrastructure. We reiterate that requests for the full \r\nreturn or restitution of cultural property should be \r\nrespected and complied with as an act of justice and a \r\nmoral obligation. \r\n Mr. Saripudin (Indonesia): Indonesia attaches \r\ngreat importance to the issue of the return or restitution \r\nof cultural property to the countries of origin. As a \r\ncountry with many archaeological artefacts dating from \r\nprehistoric times, Indonesia has taken many measures \r\nto preserve its valuable national heritage. Among them \r\nis the enactment of Law No. 5 of 1992, regarding the \r\nconservation of cultural objects. The Government of \r\nIndonesia plans to revise that law so as to incorporate \r\nnot only the physical and material aspects of culture, \r\nsuch as objects and heritage sites, but also \r\nnon-physical aspects, such as customs and art. \r\n Indonesia acknowledges the 2005 launching of \r\nthe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural \r\nOrganization (UNESCO) database of national cultural \r\nheritage laws, which serves as a reference tool and \r\ncompendium of good practices. We also acknowledge \r\nthe UNESCO-World Customs Organization Model \r\nExport Certificate for Cultural Objects as a tool to \r\ncombat illicit trafficking in cultural property. We also \r\ncommend the efforts of UNESCO to promote the \r\nrelevant international standard-setting instruments and \r\nto take steps to raise public awareness of the relevant \r\nrestitution and illicit-trafficking issues. In addition, we \r\ncommend the work of its Intergovernmental Committee \r\nfor Promoting the Return of Cultural Property to its \r\nCountries of Origin or its Restitution in Case of Illicit \r\nAppropriation. We also believe that it is important for \r\nStates to continue to do their utmost to prevent the \r\nillicit appropriation of cultural objects. \r\n Indonesia underlines the fact that draft resolution \r\nA/64/L.17 basically concerns the recovery of cultural \r\nproperty that was stolen or obtained in an illicit \r\nmanner. However, my delegation notes that many legal \r\ndifficulties are often encountered at the international \r\nlevel when attempting to recover stolen or illicitly \r\nexported cultural property to which the 1972 UNESCO \r\nConvention on the Means of Prohibiting and \r\nPreventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of \r\nOwnership of Cultural Property and the 1995 \r\nInternational Institute for the Unification of Private \r\nLaw (UNIDROIT) Convention on Stolen or Illegally \r\nExported Cultural Objects do not apply. \r\n A/64/PV.47\r\n \r\n23 09-60826 \r\n \r\n Indonesia would like to underline the criminal \r\ndimension of this issue. As we know, it is the nature of \r\nstolen cultural objects to be sent across international \r\nborders illegally. Obviously, the international \r\ndimension is attractive to sophisticated operators, \r\nwhose destinations of choice are those nations where \r\nthey feel they can evade law enforcement or may be \r\nable to exploit perceived loopholes in the regulations. \r\nIndonesia therefore believes that, in order to prevent \r\nand further deter those sophisticated criminals from \r\ntrafficking cultural property in an illicit manner and to \r\navoid creating safe havens for them, States need to \r\ncooperate to address the legal difficulties that are not \r\ncovered by the UNESCO and UNIDROIT Conventions. \r\n Indonesia believes that cooperation among States is \r\npossible through mutual legal assistance in criminal \r\nmatters and extradition, as they are closely and mutually \r\nlinked. Moreover, mutual legal assistance and extradition \r\nare instrumental in ensuring effective criminal \r\nproceedings against the perpetrators of such crimes. \r\n Lastly, in addition to cooperation among States, it \r\nis important for all members of the international \r\ncommunity to continue to cooperate within the \r\nframework of the United Nations and UNESCO in \r\norder to achieve increased mobilization and action to \r\npromote heritage values and to ensure the return of \r\ncultural property to the countries of origin, or \r\nrestitution for it. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on this item. At the request of the \r\nsponsor, action on draft resolution A/64/L.17 will be \r\ntaken at a later date to be announced. \r\n The General Assembly has thus concluded this \r\nstage of its consideration of agenda item 43. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 116 (continued) \r\n \r\nFollow-up to the commemoration of the \r\ntwo-hundredth anniversary of the abolition of the \r\ntransatlantic slave trade \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/64/L.10) \r\n \r\n The Acting President: Members will recall that \r\nthe Assembly held the debate on this agenda item at its \r\n34th plenary meeting, on 2 November 2009. \r\n I now give the floor to the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Jamaica to introduce a revision to \r\ndraft resolution A/64/L.10.  \r\n Mr. Wolfe (Jamaica): I have the honour to inform \r\nthe General Assembly that, since the introduction, on  \r\n2 November 2009, of the draft resolution entitled \r\n“Permanent memorial to and remembrance of the \r\nvictims of slavery and the transatlantic slave trade”, \r\nwhich is contained in document A/64/L.10, the \r\nfollowing countries have become co-sponsors of the \r\ndraft resolution: Bangladesh, Belgium, Cyprus, the \r\nCzech Republic, Denmark, El Salvador, Iceland, \r\nLiechtenstein, Mexico, Micronesia, San Marino, Serbia \r\nand Syria. I should also like to remind the General \r\nAssembly that, when the draft resolution was \r\nintroduced, on 2 November, 37 countries joined as \r\nadditional sponsors, namely, Albania, Armenia, \r\nAustria, Belarus, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Costa Rica, \r\nCroatia, Cuba, Ecuador, Estonia, France, Georgia, \r\nGreece, Hungary, India, Israel, Japan, Kuwait, \r\nKyrgyzstan, Malta, Monaco, Pakistan, Papua New \r\nGuinea, Paraguay, Peru, the Philippines, the Russian \r\nFederation, Slovenia, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, \r\nThailand, Turkey, Ukraine, the United States of \r\nAmerica and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. \r\nThat brings the total to 147 sponsors. \r\n As a result of informal consultations with \r\nMember States, agreement has been reached to revise \r\nthe draft resolution to include an additional \r\nsubparagraph in paragraph 13, which would read as \r\nfollows: \r\n  “Also requests the United Nations Office \r\nfor Partnerships, through the Secretary-General, \r\nto submit a comprehensive report to the General \r\nAssembly at the sixty-fifth session on the status \r\nof the Permanent Memorial Trust Fund, and in \r\nparticular, on contributions received and its \r\nutilization.” \r\n As fate would have it, today is coincidentally \r\nrecognized by the United Nations system as the \r\nInternational Day for Tolerance. It is fitting that we are \r\nhere to adopt a draft resolution that addresses the \r\nlingering consequences of the transatlantic slave trade, \r\nwhich continue to impact the descendants of the \r\nvictims until today. \r\n The placement of a permanent memorial at the \r\nUnited Nations will be an appropriate symbol of what \r\nthe United Nations represents, namely, the promotion \r\nand preservation of the dignity and worth of all human \r\nbeings. Those principles are central to the United \r\nNations Charter. They are also principles that the \r\nA/64/PV.47  \r\n \r\n09-60826 24 \r\n \r\ninternational community will stay focused on today in \r\ncommemoration of tolerance, which brings to mind the \r\ntheme we have maintained for our initiative, namely \r\n“Acknowledging the tragedy and considering the \r\nlegacy, lest we forget”. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to express my \r\ndelegation’s sincere appreciation to all those who \r\nconstructively engaged in the informal consultations to \r\nfinalize this draft resolution. I am therefore confident \r\nthat this draft resolution, like similar ones in the past, \r\nwill be adopted by consensus, in particular in view of \r\nthe strong support by Member States. We are indeed \r\ngrateful for the sponsorship of 147 Member States. \r\n Finally, let me express particular appreciation to \r\nthe Member States from Africa and the Caribbean \r\nCommunity, which continue to play a primary role in \r\nadvancing the permanent memorial initiative. \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\ntake action on draft resolution A/64/L.10, entitled \r\n“Permanent memorial to and remembrance of the \r\nvictims of slavery and the transatlantic slave trade”, as \r\norally revised. \r\n May I take it that it is the wish of the General \r\nAssembly to adopt draft resolution A/64/L.10 as orally \r\nrevised? \r\n Draft resolution A/64/L.10, as orally revised, was \r\nadopted (resolution 64/15). \r\n The Acting President: May I take it that it is the \r\nwish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 116? \r\n It was so decided.  \r\n  The meeting rose at 12.40 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
