That is a \r\n A/64/PV.48\r\n \r\n3 09-61350 \r\n \r\nstrong incentive for all of us to redouble our \r\nefforts to achieve what we all want: a revitalized \r\nGeneral Assembly; a General Assembly \r\ndetermined and ready to address the greatest \r\nchallenges facing us today by harmonizing \r\nactions of nations to promote global solutions to \r\nglobal problems; a General Assembly that \r\nprojects the strength and effectiveness of the \r\nOrganization, thus enhancing its credibility; a \r\nGeneral Assembly that lives up to its status as the \r\nmain deliberative, policy-making and decision-\r\nmaking organ of the United Nations. This is a \r\npriority for a large majority of Member States, \r\nand I am deeply devoted to promoting it during \r\nthis session. \r\n “The General Assembly has wide-ranging \r\nfunctions and powers. It can discuss any question \r\nor any matter within the scope of the Charter. We \r\nshould make optimal use of these provisions to \r\nexploit the full potential of the General Assembly. \r\nFrom international peace and security to \r\ndevelopment to human rights, justice and \r\ninternational law, and a host of other domains, the \r\nGeneral Assembly has and must continue to play \r\nits rightful role. And it has to be more responsive \r\nand quick in tackling the issues of greatest and \r\nimmediate concern to the international \r\ncommunity. Since that is largely a function of \r\npolitical will, the Member States should be \r\nencouraged to engage in a constructive political \r\ndialogue that facilitates effective and timely \r\ndecisions, which then need to be implemented. \r\nThat is essential if the Assembly is to retain its \r\ncentral role and authority, which have been \r\neroded in recent years. \r\n “I also intend to increase the Assembly’s \r\nvisibility, including by holding thematic debates \r\nthat will offer member States an opportunity to \r\ndebate some of the most pressing challenges in an \r\nopen, interactive, inclusive and effective manner. \r\nThat will also enhance the General Assembly’s \r\nworking relationship with other United Nations \r\nbodies, non-governmental organizations and civil \r\nsociety, and thus boost its public outreach. \r\n “I take this opportunity to thank the work \r\ndone by the two co-facilitators of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group on the Revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly established last year, which, \r\namong other things, led to the adoption of an \r\nimportant report (A/63/959) and the substantive \r\nresolution 63/309. Their work provides us with a \r\nstarting point to discuss the most relevant issues \r\nthat need to be addressed during this session in \r\norder to enhance the transparency and efficiency \r\nof the work of the General Assembly.  \r\n “In that resolution, Member States have \r\nclearly underlined the need to achieve an \r\nadequate balance among the principal organs, \r\nparticularly between the General Assembly and \r\nthe Security Council. I believe that the \r\nnegotiation process on Security Council reform \r\ncould also be bolstered by our work on the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly. A \r\nreformed Security Council should be reflective of \r\nthe composition of the general membership and \r\nresponsive to its positions and priorities. \r\n “As President of the General Assembly, I \r\nhave held regular meetings with the rotating \r\nPresidents of the Security Council and the \r\nPresident of the Economic and Social Council in \r\norder to ensure increased cooperation and \r\ncoordination between our work programmes.  \r\n “Many States have also underscored the role \r\nof the General Assembly in the selection and \r\nappointment of the Secretary-General, in \r\naccordance with Article 97 of the Charter, as well \r\nas provisions contained in General Assembly \r\nresolutions regarding this matter. Many Member \r\nStates also stress the need for the Security \r\nCouncil and the General Assembly to work \r\nharmoniously to make this important decision in \r\na more transparent manner. \r\n “In order to continue the work of the past \r\nsession, as I have already informed delegations in \r\nmy letter of 2 November 2009, Her Excellency \r\nMs. Sanja Štiglic, Permanent Representative of \r\nSlovenia, and His Excellency Mr. Jorge Argüello, \r\nPermanent Representative of Argentina, have \r\nagreed to serve as co-facilitators of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group. I would like to thank both of \r\nthem for accepting this important task, and I am \r\nconvinced that all Member States will extend to \r\nthem their full cooperation and support. \r\n “I hope that this session will bring us closer \r\nto fulfilling our commitment to revitalizing the \r\nGeneral Assembly in all aspects of its work. \r\nA/64/PV.48  \r\n \r\n09-61350 4 \r\n \r\nDelegations’ views and suggestions and active \r\nparticipation will surely facilitate this objective.” \r\n Mr. Örnéus (Sweden): I have the honour of \r\nspeaking on behalf of the European Union (EU). \r\nCroatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, \r\nIceland, Turkey, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, \r\nMontenegro, Serbia, Ukraine, the Republic of \r\nMoldova, Armenia and Azerbaijan align themselves \r\nwith this statement. \r\n At the outset, the European Union would like to \r\nthank the President of the General Assembly, Mr. Ali \r\nTreki, for having convened this meeting on the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly and for the \r\nstatement that we have just heard. The EU would also \r\nlike to express gratitude to former President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann for his \r\nefforts during the sixty-third session. The EU \r\nencourages Mr. Treki to pursue his engagement in that \r\nvital process. \r\n The European Union would also like to express \r\ngratitude to the two co-Chairs, Ambassador Ms. María \r\nFernanda Espinosa, former Permanent Representative \r\nof Ecuador, and Ambassador Mr. Morten Wetland, \r\nPermanent Representative of Norway, for the work \r\naccomplished within the Ad Hoc Working Group on the \r\nRevitalization of the General Assembly during the \r\nsixty-third session. \r\n As it is well known, the EU supports effective \r\nmultilateralism and the central role of the United \r\nNations therein. Furthermore, the strengthening of the \r\nUnited Nations is a top priority for the European \r\nUnion. The revitalization of the General Assembly is \r\nan integral part of the reform efforts of the United \r\nNations. The EU continues to be committed to the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly and supports \r\nefforts aimed at strengthening its role and authority in \r\nline with the United Nations Charter and other relevant \r\ndocuments.  \r\n The European Union strongly believes that the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly can be ensured \r\nonly when it engages in issues of genuine concern to \r\nall Member States and to the international community \r\nas a whole. Doing so, it will live up to its role as one of \r\nthe principle organs of the United Nations. At the same \r\ntime, a number of practical steps could be undertaken \r\nthat would make the proceedings of the General \r\nAssembly more effective and efficient. At this stage, \r\nwe believe, concrete initiatives at the practical level are \r\nof critical importance to an overhaul of the General \r\nAssembly’s performance. In our efforts towards \r\nreform, we must be careful not to duplicate in the Ad \r\nHoc Working Group discussions and negotiations \r\nalready held or still ongoing in other forums.  \r\n The European Union has heard the appeal of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly as well as from all \r\nMember States for the need to reform the United \r\nNations, including the General Assembly. The EU \r\nremains resolved to participate actively in a genuine \r\ndialogue with all United Nations Members to push \r\nthose efforts forward.  \r\n The European Union welcomes the adoption of \r\nresolution 63/309 on the revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly. We note with great appreciation the \r\ndynamic political will among Member States to engage \r\nconstructively in the negotiation process in order to \r\ngive substance to further work. The European Union \r\nlooks forward to advancing our common efforts in the \r\nsame spirit of consensus.  \r\n We are counting on the Ad Hoc Working Group \r\non the Revitalization of the General Assembly to \r\ncontinue progress towards reform. In that regard, we \r\nwould like to highlight the inventory chart of all \r\nrelevant proposals on revitalization and the stages of \r\ntheir implementation, contained in the most recent \r\nreport of the Ad Hoc Working Group (A/63/959). The \r\nchart provides a useful tool which facilitates the \r\ncontinued monitoring of the further implementation of \r\nour joint commitment.  \r\n The EU is convinced that the best way forward is \r\nthrough the swift implementation of existing \r\nresolutions on the revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly, including the 2005 World Summit Outcome \r\nDocument (resolution 60/1). As previously stated, the \r\nSecretary-General could, in his annual report on the \r\nwork of the Organization, present precise information \r\nconcerning the mandates adopted by the General \r\nAssembly during the year, including information on the \r\nstatus of their implementation. \r\n With regard to the working methods of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, the EU looks forward to working \r\nwith the full membership and the Secretariat in order to \r\nfurther streamline and modernize the agenda of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. We also reiterate the importance of \r\nintroducing measures to improve the quality and \r\naccuracy of General Assembly documents in the six \r\nofficial United Nations languages, and to ensure that \r\n A/64/PV.48\r\n \r\n5 09-61350 \r\n \r\nthey are systematically produced and translated using \r\nthe texts and speeches as they were written or given in \r\ntheir original language. In that regard, we would like to \r\nrequest clarification from the Secretariat on the \r\npossible savings that could be made by eliminating \r\ndistribution of the paper versions of United Nations \r\ndocuments to all permanent missions. The savings, we \r\nbelieve, could be used to improve the quality of those \r\ndocuments and their distribution to Member States. \r\n As regards the process of selection of the \r\nSecretary-General, which has also been under \r\nexamination, the European Union attaches great \r\nimportance to the full application of the relevant \r\nprovisions of the Charter and respective resolutions of \r\nthe General Assembly. The EU looks forward to \r\nworking with the co-facilitators who have been \r\nappointed by the President of the General Assembly, \r\nMs. Sanja Štiglic, Permanent Representative of \r\nSlovenia, and Mr. Jorge Argüello, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Argentina. We assure them of our \r\nfull cooperation and support. \r\n The European Union will engage in an active and \r\npragmatic manner in the proceedings of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group with a view to contributing to the \r\nsuccessful outcome of our efforts aimed at the \r\ncollective objective of further revitalizing the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Mr. Benmehidi (Algeria): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement \r\n(NAM). \r\n At the outset, I would like to express the gratitude \r\nof NAM members to Ambassador María Fernanda \r\nEspinosa, former Permanent Representative of \r\nEcuador, and Ambassador Morten Wetland, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Norway, for their excellent work in \r\nco-chairing the Ad Hoc Working Group on the \r\nRevitalization of the General Assembly during the \r\nsixty-third session. \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement reiterates the \r\nimportance it accords to the revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the validity and relevance of its \r\nprincipled position with regard to this process. The \r\nMovement underlines that the revitalization process is \r\nof a political nature and is aimed mainly at \r\nstrengthening the role of the General Assembly as the \r\nchief deliberative, policymaking and representative \r\norgan of the United Nations and its position in the \r\nwider United Nations system. It should therefore be \r\nconducted in an inclusive, transparent and efficient \r\nmanner. \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement welcomed the \r\nholding of the United Nations Conference on the World \r\nFinancial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on \r\nDevelopment. Globalization has undoubtedly \r\nfacilitated the rapid diffusion of the crisis and its \r\nnumerous consequences in all regions of the world. A \r\nglobal and coordinated response is therefore required \r\nto address the effects and root causes of the crisis. The \r\nJune Conference and its Outcome Document \r\n(resolution 63/303) established that a reinvigorated \r\nGeneral Assembly is the most appropriate plenary \r\nforum to tackle such global issues. \r\n The Movement also notes with satisfaction the \r\ndecisive and timely adoption of resolution 63/301, on \r\nthe situation in Honduras, and of resolution 64/10, on \r\nthe Goldstone report (A/HRC/12/48), as a \r\nmanifestation of the extent to which the General \r\nAssembly is attuned to events of international \r\nrelevance and as an example of the Assembly’s role in \r\nmaintaining international peace and security. \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement emphasizes the need \r\nfor Member States to fully respect the functions and \r\npowers of each principal organ of the United Nations, \r\nin particular the General Assembly, and to maintain the \r\nbalance among those organs within their respective \r\nCharter-based functions and powers. In this regard, the \r\nSecurity Council must fully observe all Charter \r\nprovisions and General Assembly resolutions that \r\nclarify the Assembly’s relationship with the Council \r\nand other principal organs. \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement expresses again its \r\nconcern, which it has raised at previous sessions, with \r\nregard to the continual attempts of the Security Council \r\nto encroach on the powers and prerogatives of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. Article 24 of the Charter does not \r\nprovide the Security Council with the competence to \r\naddress issues which fall within the functions and \r\npowers of the General Assembly and Economic and \r\nSocial Council. The General Assembly, as the \r\npolicymaking organ of the Organization, has the \r\nauthority and essential role in designing the \r\nframework, setting the principles and identifying the \r\nobjectives for the wider United Nations system and its \r\nnumerous organs, agencies and programmes. \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement, while expressing its \r\nreadiness to continue to support all ongoing efforts to \r\nA/64/PV.48  \r\n \r\n09-61350 6 \r\n \r\nstrengthen the central role and authority of the \r\nAssembly, wishes to state that it will oppose any \r\napproach that seeks to undermine or minimize the \r\nachievements of the General Assembly, diminish its \r\ncurrent role and functioning, or raise questions about \r\nits relevance and credibility. \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement welcomes the \r\nadoption of resolution 63/309 in September, by which \r\nthe General Assembly, inter alia, re-established the \r\nAd Hoc Working Group to discuss during the sixty-\r\nfourth session issues related to the revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and to assess, in particular, the \r\nstatus of implementation of its previous resolutions on \r\nthis matter. In this regard, while it reiterates the \r\nvalidity and relevance of all its positions, the \r\nMovement reaffirms its willingness to contribute \r\neffectively and constructively to the activities of the \r\nWorking Group to identify ways and means to \r\nstrengthen the role and authority of the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n A thorough evaluation of the status of \r\nimplementation of General Assembly resolutions and a \r\nclear identification of the causes underlying any lack of \r\nimplementation are of the utmost importance in order \r\nto progressively eliminate the constraints that still \r\nprevent the process of revitalizing the General \r\nAssembly from achieving its full potential. \r\n The Movement emphasizes the importance of \r\nensuring the effectiveness of the Office of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly, including through \r\nthe strengthening of its institutional memory, in \r\nparticular the strengthening of permanent staff of that \r\nOffice. While we note with appreciation the progress \r\nalready achieved in this regard, we are of the view that \r\nparticular effort should be devoted to implementing the \r\nresolutions that already exist on this matter, as well as \r\nto identifying, during the upcoming discussions of the \r\nWorking Group, ways and means to pursue this \r\nobjective progressively and with determination. \r\n I should like to express the gratitude and \r\nappreciation of the Non-Aligned Movement to the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly, Mr. Ali \r\nAbdussalam Treki, for his determination to enhance the \r\nauthority of this body, and to reaffirm our conviction \r\nthat, during his tenure and under his presidency, the \r\nissue of the revitalization of the General Assembly will \r\nbe handled successfully and genuine progress will be \r\nachieved. \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement expresses its \r\nconcern over the lack of transparency and \r\ninclusiveness that characterized the nomination and \r\nelection of the Secretary-General. It has become clear \r\nthat the Security Council, and its permanent members \r\nin particular, have assumed over-broad powers over the \r\nyears on this matter. The lengthy discussions of this \r\nissue during the sixty-third session and the various \r\nviews expressed show the growing concern of the \r\nwhole membership towards this matter and with regard \r\nto its future improvement.  \r\n The Movement, recalling the role of the principal \r\norgans as enshrined in Article 97 of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, stresses the need for adaptation of the \r\nprocedure laid out by resolution 11 (I) of January 1946. \r\nThat 60 year-old resolution has been proven to fall \r\nshort in addressing the growing concern of the \r\nmembers of the General Assembly and their \r\nwillingness to create conditions necessary for this \r\norgan to fully undertake its responsibility in the \r\nprocess of the nomination and election of the \r\nSecretary-General. \r\n In this regard, the President of the General \r\nAssembly may consult with Member States to identify \r\npotential candidates endorsed by a Member State and, \r\nupon informing all Member States of the results, \r\nforward these results to the Security Council. A formal \r\npresentation before the General Assembly of \r\ncandidatures for the position of Secretary-General can \r\nbe envisaged, since it will allow effective interaction \r\namong Member States in the General Assembly and the \r\nSecurity Council. The President of the General \r\nAssembly could, during the process of selection, \r\nconvene a meeting of the General Assembly for an \r\nexchange of views and dialogue with all candidates, as \r\nis the procedure within many other important \r\ninternational organizations. \r\n With regard to the proposal for the establishment \r\nof a new balloting system, the Non-Aligned Movement \r\nreiterates the necessary cautiousness it has already \r\nexpressed before the Working Group regarding the \r\nconfidentiality and the integrity of the voting process. \r\nThe various proposals made on the use of optical \r\nscanners have not convinced members of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement that the confidentiality of the \r\nvote is enhanced or even preserved. Furthermore, the \r\nCapital Master Plan should not be used as a \r\njustification to engage in the actual installation of any \r\nkind of new balloting system until the membership has \r\n A/64/PV.48\r\n \r\n7 09-61350 \r\n \r\nhad the opportunity to exhaust the discussion on the \r\nmatter. \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement reaffirms that a \r\nreinvigorated General Assembly, in a more responsive \r\nenvironment and fully exercising its role and authority, \r\nwould significantly contribute to the strengthening of \r\nthe wider United Nations system and be capable of \r\nenhancing international good governance and \r\nmultilateralism. \r\n I should like to end by congratulating the \r\nPermanent Representatives of Slovenia and Argentina \r\non their appointments by the President of the General \r\nAssembly as co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc Working Group \r\non the Revitalization of the General Assembly. We look \r\nforward to working with them constructively. \r\n Ms. Rovirosa (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): It is \r\nan honour for my delegation to participate on behalf of \r\nthe Rio Group in this year’s debate on the revitalization \r\nof the work of the General Assembly.  \r\n The Rio Group reiterates its firm commitment to \r\nthe process of revitalizing the General Assembly and \r\nbelieves that resolution 63/309, adopted by consensus \r\non 14 September, incorporates the main concerns \r\nexpressed by the various groups and delegations in the \r\nframework of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the \r\nRevitalization of the General Assembly. The resolution \r\nand the report of the Working Group (A/63/959), \r\ndiligently coordinated by the Ambassadors of Ecuador \r\nand Norway, reflect the commitment of the \r\nmembership and the Secretariat to promoting the \r\nprocess of revitalizing the Organization’s most \r\nrepresentative organ. \r\n Nevertheless, despite the progress made — \r\nespecially with regard to procedural matters — the Rio \r\nGroup believes that efforts should be redoubled in the \r\nimplementation of mandates pertaining to the role of \r\nthe General Assembly, especially in the following five \r\nareas, which the Group believes are crucial to \r\nrevitalization efforts. \r\n First, with regard to the role and responsibility of \r\nthe General Assembly in the process of selecting the \r\nSecretary-General, it is a fact that the authority for this \r\nimportant decision lies mainly with the Security \r\nCouncil. The General Assembly only has a de facto \r\nrole in consenting to the decision. The Rio Group \r\ntherefore believes that a transparent and inclusive \r\nselection process should be put in place whereby the \r\nGeneral Assembly could play a more relevant role in \r\nline with the provisions of the Charter of the United \r\nNations and of the resolutions that have been adopted \r\nby the Assembly itself on this issue. \r\n Secondly, with regard to strengthening the \r\nauthority of the General Assembly, the Rio Group \r\nbelieves that it is critical that the General Assembly \r\nassume a more proactive role in addressing issues \r\npertaining to international peace and security and the \r\nnew peacebuilding architecture. Similarly, the \r\nAssembly should continue to advance discussion on \r\nissues of universal interest. That should serve to \r\nstrengthen its authority, especially in connection with \r\nmatters that require an adequate and timely response \r\nfrom the Organization. \r\n Thirdly, with regard to strengthening the Office \r\nof the President of the General Assembly, the Rio \r\nGroup supports the efforts under way to continue to \r\nstrengthen that Office in institutional terms. The Group \r\nalso acknowledges the progress that has been made in \r\nthat regard in recent years. However, the Group \r\nbelieves that it is important to continue to consider \r\nmeasures and procedures that will make it possible to \r\noptimize the use of the existing human and financial \r\nresources of the Office of the President. \r\n Fourthly, with regard to improving working \r\nmethods, when it comes to operational matters \r\nrevitalization is more likely to be approached in a more \r\nimmediate way, for it directly involves Member States. \r\nStreamlining the items on the agenda of the General \r\nAssembly is one way to better parcel out the \r\nAssembly’s workload — both in the plenary and in the \r\nMain Committees — while still taking its political \r\nimplications into consideration. That goal can be \r\nachieved if the membership as a whole decides to do \r\nso. It is up to us, the Member States, to demonstrate \r\nour readiness to adequately reduce the number of items \r\naddressed by the Assembly. Among the most feasible \r\nways to do so is to biennialize or triennialize the \r\nconsideration of items. That, too, is dependent upon a \r\ndecision of the membership as a whole. \r\n Fifthly, with regard to the voting system in the \r\nUnited Nations, the General Assembly’s manual voting \r\nsystem must function more efficiently so as to expedite \r\nthe counting process and ensure the credibility, \r\nreliability and confidentiality of the voting process.  \r\n The Rio Group wishes once again to reiterate its \r\nfull readiness to continue to work constructively at this \r\nA/64/PV.48  \r\n \r\n09-61350 8 \r\n \r\nsession to find practical and realistic approaches \r\nleading to a genuine strengthening of the supreme \r\nuniversal forum. \r\n Lastly, on behalf of the Rio Group, allow me to \r\nexpress our gratitude to Ambassador Ali Treki for his \r\nefforts to continue to advance work on this important \r\nissue. Similarly, I would like to express the Group’s \r\ngratitude to Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann, \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-third \r\nsession, for the commitment he demonstrated during \r\nhis presidency in connection with efforts aimed at \r\nrevitalizing the Assembly. I should also like to assure \r\nthe new co-facilitators, the Ambassadors of Slovenia \r\nand Argentina, of the Group’s cooperation. We shall \r\ncontinue to work with them to achieve results in our \r\nwork. \r\n Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt): At the outset, I would \r\nlike to express to Ambassador Treki Egypt’s gratitude \r\nfor making the issue of the revitalization of the work of \r\nthe General Assembly one of the main priorities of his \r\npresidency during the Assembly’s sixty-fourth session. \r\nI also thank him for his commitment and determination \r\nto enhance the Assembly’s role and authority, including \r\nthrough the Ad Hoc Working Group on the \r\nRevitalization of the General Assembly. \r\n I would also like to take this opportunity to thank \r\nthe co-facilitators of the Ad Hoc Working Group — \r\nMs. María Espinoza, former Permanent Representative \r\nof Ecuador, and Mr. Morten Wetland, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Norway — for their excellent work \r\nand dedication in co-chairing the Working Group \r\nduring the sixty-third session. I should also like to \r\npledge our full support to the new co-facilitators for \r\nthe sixty-fourth session — Ms. Sanja Štiglic, \r\nPermanent Representative of Slovenia, and Mr. Jorge \r\nArgüello, Permanent Representative of Argentina — in \r\npromoting the process of revitalizing the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n Egypt associates itself with the statement made \r\nby the Permanent Representative of Algeria on behalf \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement. \r\n Despite the importance of the process of \r\nrevitalizing the General Assembly as the chief \r\ndeliberative, policymaking and representative principal \r\norgan of the Organization, no concrete results have \r\nbeen achieved so far. That is due mainly to the lack of \r\npolitical will to ensure that the General Assembly plays \r\nits leading role in accordance with the delicate balance \r\namong all principal organs established by the Charter. \r\n As the relationship between the Security Council \r\nand the General Assembly is already defined in the \r\nCharter, Egypt is convinced that the problem \r\nconcerning the relation between those two principal \r\norgans lies in the application by both of them — the \r\nCouncil and the Assembly — of their respective \r\nmandates. On the one hand, the Security Council \r\ncontinues to encroach on the mandate of the General \r\nAssembly. It does not bring any matter to the attention \r\nof the General Assembly and, in most cases, it acts in a \r\nmanner that ignores the will and views of the countries \r\nconcerned and the general membership of the United \r\nNations. On the other hand, the General Assembly does \r\nnot exercise in a satisfactory manner its responsibilities \r\nenshrined in the Charter, particularly concerning its \r\nrelations with the Security Council and the other \r\nprincipal organs. \r\n Egypt therefore believes that we should focus on \r\ntaking concrete steps. We should continue to make the \r\nutmost effort while focusing on the honest \r\nimplementation of the proposals that were previously \r\nadopted in resolutions of the General Assembly, as well \r\nas on new proposals to be presented during this session \r\naimed at achieving the revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly and at preventing the Security Council from \r\nencroaching on its mandates.  \r\n In this regard, allow me to highlight some \r\nadditional important points, which were reflected in the \r\nfinal document adopted by the fifteenth Non-Aligned \r\nMovement Summit, held in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, in \r\nJuly 2009, and some other points we deem necessary \r\nfor the success of the process of revitalizing the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n First, the General Assembly should take \r\nappropriate and concrete measures, in accordance with \r\nthe United Nations Charter, in instances wherein the \r\nSecurity Council fails to address cases involving \r\ngenocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes or \r\nbreaches of ceasefire between belligerent parties, in \r\nfulfilment of its primary responsibility. Moreover, the \r\nAssembly should identify measures to simplify the \r\nUniting for Peace process to enable swifter and more \r\nurgent action by the Assembly, in recognition of its \r\nrole on issues relating to international peace and \r\nsecurity, as set out in the Charter. \r\n A/64/PV.48\r\n \r\n9 09-61350 \r\n \r\n Second, the General Assembly should maintain \r\nits role and mandate in setting the priorities of the \r\nUnited Nations in considering all budgetary and \r\nadministrative issues and reforms, including its \r\nabsolute authority to allocate and reallocate financial \r\nand human resources and in the appointment of senior \r\nofficials of the Secretariat in accordance with the \r\nCharter and the relevant Assembly resolutions. In this \r\nregard, prerogatives of the Assembly, as the chief \r\noversight organ of the Organization, including on \r\nmanagement and procurement for peacekeeping \r\noperations, must be respected. \r\n Third, the General Assembly should actively \r\nundertake its role in the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security, as stipulated in Articles 10 to 14 \r\nand Article 35 of the United Nations Charter, as well as \r\nusing, where appropriate, the procedures set forth in \r\nrules 7, 8, 9 and 10 of the rules of procedure of the \r\nAssembly, which enable swift and urgent action by the \r\nAssembly, bearing in mind that the Security Council \r\nhas the primary — but not the only — responsibility \r\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security. \r\nThe adoption of resolution 63/301 on the situation in \r\nHonduras and of resolution 64/10 on the follow-up to \r\nthe report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission \r\non the Gaza Conflict are clear illustrations of the \r\nability of the Assembly to take action on issues that fall \r\nwithin the purview of the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security. This trend by the Assembly should \r\nbe enhanced, further solidified and even developed in \r\nall similar cases relating to the maintenance of peace \r\nand security, particularly in cases where the Security \r\nCouncil has failed in achieving peace and security, \r\nsuch as in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and \r\nSomalia. We encourage the President of the Assembly \r\nto hold many thematic debates on these issues and on \r\nother issues of concern to the larger membership of the \r\nOrganization with a view to adopting the necessary \r\nresolutions. \r\n Fourth, to achieve that, we should ensure the \r\neffectiveness of the Office of the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, which is a matter of great \r\nimportance in the process of enhancing the role and \r\nauthority of the Assembly, in particular through \r\nstrengthening the institutional memory of the Office, \r\nwhich currently relies on voluntary contributions; this \r\naffects the ability of developing countries to take an \r\nactive part in the development of such capabilities. \r\n Fifth, we stress that the General Assembly \r\nremains the principal organ that reviews the work of its \r\nsubsidiary organs, including the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, which is and shall remain a subsidiary body \r\nof the Assembly. Moreover, we encourage the \r\nAssembly to engage actively with the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission as a subsidiary body of the Assembly and \r\ncall for more periodic briefings to the Assembly by the \r\nChairs of the Peacebuilding Commission and its \r\ncountry-specific configurations. \r\n Sixth, the role undertaken by the Security \r\nCouncil and its permanent members in the selection \r\nprocess of the Secretary-General encroaches on the \r\nrole of the General Assembly in this regard. Therefore, \r\nit is necessary to revitalize the role of the Assembly, in \r\naccordance with Article 97 of the Charter and \r\nresolutions 51/241 and 60/286 concerning this matter. \r\nIn this context, we propose establishing a mechanism \r\nthat allows the President of the Assembly to consult \r\nwith Member States to identify potential candidates \r\nendorsed by Member States, inform all Member States \r\nof the results and forward those results to the Security \r\nCouncil. Formal presentation of candidatures for the \r\nposition of Secretary-General should be held in a \r\nmanner that allows for interaction and exchange of \r\nviews with Member States. \r\n Seventh, Egypt supports developing the \r\ntechnology of voting and balloting systems applied in \r\nthe General Assembly, as long as this does not affect \r\nthe reliability and confidentiality of those systems. \r\nNevertheless, Egypt is not in favour of the proposals \r\npresented during the sixty-third session of the \r\nAssembly to establish a new balloting system as a \r\nmean of expediting the counting of votes cast by secret \r\nballot during elections. We believe that these proposals \r\naffect the credibility, reliability and confidentiality of \r\nthe current balloting system. Thus, we believe that the \r\ncurrent system concerning voting and balloting in the \r\nAssembly should be maintained until another credible \r\nsystem meets with acceptance by Member States. \r\n Eighth, there should be a follow-up to the \r\neffective implementation of the resolutions adopted by \r\nthe General Assembly on the revitalization process. \r\nThe Secretary-General should be requested to submit \r\nto the Assembly an analytical status report with a \r\nfactual chart on the implementation of all resolutions \r\nthat have been adopted under this agenda item in all \r\nprevious years — and we have adopted many \r\nresolutions on this by consensus. \r\nA/64/PV.48  \r\n \r\n09-61350 10 \r\n \r\n In conclusion, the best way to enhance \r\nmultilateralism is to have a revitalized General \r\nAssembly through identifying further ways to enhance \r\nits role, authority, effectiveness and efficiency, building \r\non previous resolutions and on the progress made \r\nduring previous sessions. As the credibility of the \r\nUnited Nations and its capacity to fulfil its \r\nresponsibilities are increasingly linked to the ability of \r\nthe Assembly to exercise its institutional prerogatives, \r\nwe call on all members to show the political will \r\nnecessary to support international good governance \r\nbased on equality, transparency and accountability. \r\n Mr. Yaroshevich (Belarus): The Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup on the Revitalization of the General Assembly \r\nhas lately achieved some tangible results. Last year, we \r\nwere able to work out the chart of General Assembly \r\nresolutions on revitalization (A/63/959, annex), which \r\nwas used as the basis for analysing the reasons for the \r\nlack of implementation of previously adopted \r\nresolutions on Assembly revitalization. \r\n Recently, we adopted the first substantive \r\nresolution on General Assembly revitalization in years. \r\nResolution 63/309 covers most of the themes we \r\ndiscussed and incorporates the conclusions at which we \r\narrived. We would like to commend the goodwill of \r\nMember States and political groups, in particular the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement (NAM) and the European \r\nUnion, which made these results possible. \r\n Belarus associates itself with the statement made \r\nby the Permanent Representative of Algeria on behalf \r\nof the NAM. \r\n The Belarusian delegation believes that the \r\natmosphere in which the Ad Hoc Working Group on \r\nGeneral Assembly revitalization worked has been \r\nsignificantly improved and, in general, will contribute \r\nto the restoration of trust between the Assembly and \r\nthe Security Council. We also believe that, \r\nstrategically, the steps we took together towards \r\nstrengthening the role of the Assembly as the main \r\ndeliberative, policymaking and representative organ of \r\nthe United Nations are visible evidence of the effective \r\ninteraction that has been intensified between the \r\nrecognized centres of world economic and political \r\npower in order to stabilize the international situation. \r\n Having achieved so much, we cannot be allowed \r\nto lose momentum. The Belarusian delegation will \r\nstrive for further good practical results on General \r\nAssembly revitalization during this session, and we \r\ncall upon our partners to do the same. \r\n We commend the interest and engagement shown \r\nby the delegations of the five permanent members of \r\nthe Security Council (P-5) in the most recent \r\ndeliberations in the framework of the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup. We hope that the P-5 members will further \r\nregard the revitalization process as an indispensable \r\nway of ensuring the viability and stable good health of \r\nthe whole United Nations system. \r\n The Belarusian delegation would like to share its \r\nvision on the possible ways to proceed. We believe that \r\nthe following key ideas should be developed in the \r\ncourse of the Assembly’s current session. \r\n First, one of the best ways to revitalize the \r\nAssembly would be for it to facilitate consideration of \r\nthe most pressing and topical concerns of relevance to \r\nall Member States, as well as to the international \r\ncommunity as a whole. Among the pressing issues to \r\nbe comprehensively considered in the Assembly the \r\nBelarusian delegation would include the Kyoto and \r\nCopenhagen arrangements; access for developing \r\ncountries and countries with economies in transition to \r\ntechnologies for new and renewable sources of energy; \r\nimproving the coordination of efforts against \r\ntrafficking in human beings; and the interests of \r\nmiddle-income countries. \r\n Secondly, the thematic debates, as an advanced \r\nformat of discussion in the Assembly on issues of \r\nrelevance to the international community and of \r\nconcern and interest to the United Nations, could be \r\nmore results-oriented. We reiterate our opinion that \r\nthose debates could lead to the adoption of a resolution \r\nor the establishment of an open-ended group on the \r\nissue discussed, and a list of proposals made by \r\nMember States during the debates could be drafted. \r\n Thirdly, public visibility of the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly should be improved by increasing \r\ncooperation with major media outlets and using \r\nmodern media techniques. In this regard once again we \r\nnote with great interest the proposals made by the \r\nrepresentative of the United Nations Correspondents \r\nAssociation and reflected in the latest report of the Ad \r\nHoc Working Group (A/63/959), such as quick delivery \r\nof statements to the press; easy access for the media to \r\nAssembly meetings; indication of the speakers’ names \r\nand titles during video and TV transmissions of \r\nmeetings; and enhancing the capacity and institutional \r\n A/64/PV.48\r\n \r\n11 09-61350 \r\n \r\nmemory of the Assembly’s Spokesperson section. \r\nVisibility of the General Assembly could also be \r\nincreased through more interaction with civil society or \r\nthrough travel activities by its President and Vice-\r\nPresidents. \r\n Fourthly, the commitment to continuing our \r\nconsideration at the current session of the Assembly’s \r\nrole in the selection and appointment of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral should not be a stumbling block to our work \r\nbut rather an opportunity to listen carefully to the \r\narguments of other sides, absorb them and thoroughly \r\nwork out the decisions we would support. \r\n Fifthly, the modernization of the voting system in \r\nthe Assembly, including the introduction of optical disc \r\nscanners, is an important subject that could lead to a \r\nspecific result, provided that issues of security and \r\nconfidentiality can be duly taken into account. The \r\nAssembly cannot ignore the advantages of global \r\ntechnological progress.  \r\n Last but not least, we think it would be useful to \r\ncontinue to analyse the reasons for the lack of \r\nimplementation of previous resolutions on the \r\nrevitalization of the Assembly. \r\n In conclusion, the Belarusian delegation would \r\nlike to note that in the charts of General Assembly \r\nresolutions on revitalization we frequently see the \r\nfollowing comment on the provisions of previously \r\nadopted resolutions: “Ongoing provision. Provision \r\ndoes not contain request for specific action“. Today, we \r\nbelieve that the time has come for specific, joint and \r\nefficient actions to revitalize the United Nations \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n Mr. Bui The Giang (Viet Nam): On behalf of the \r\nVietnamese delegation, I would like to thank the \r\nPresident for convening today’s meeting to discuss a \r\nsubject dear to the heart of the broad membership of \r\nthe General Assembly. I would also like to express my \r\ngratitude to Ambassador Maria Fernanda Espinosa of \r\nEcuador and Ambassador Morten Wetland of Norway \r\nfor their excellent co-chairmanship of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group on the Revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly during the sixty-third session.  \r\n My delegation aligns itself with the statement \r\nmade earlier by the representative of Algeria on behalf \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement. \r\n Eighteen years after its first appearance on the \r\nagenda of the General Assembly, the issue of the \r\nrevitalization of the Assembly has emerged as one of \r\nthe most important subjects in the process of reform of \r\nthe United Nations in general and the General \r\nAssembly in particular. \r\n My delegation shares the view that revitalization \r\nis not an objective per se but a means of enhancing the \r\nefficiency and effectiveness of the Assembly’s work \r\nwith a view to ultimately strengthening its role as the \r\nmain deliberative, policymaking and representative \r\norgan of the United Nations, in an effort to respond \r\nproperly to the rising challenges facing the \r\ninternational community. We therefore acknowledge \r\nthe Ad Hoc Working Group for its efforts in producing \r\nthe report (A/63/959) of 10 September 2009, which \r\ncontains specific and useful recommendations, \r\nincluding in particular the draft resolution that the \r\nAssembly adopted on 14 September 2009 (resolution \r\n63/309).  \r\n That resolution — the seventeenth on this issue \r\nsince the first was adopted in 1991 — is noteworthy \r\nfor its greater clarity, straightforwardness and \r\ncomprehensiveness, including the decision to establish, \r\nat the sixty-fourth session, an ad hoc working group on \r\nrevitalization and to define concrete measures to \r\nenhance the role and authority of the General Assembly \r\nwithin the entire United Nations system. In that \r\nconnection, my delegation wishes to highlight the \r\nfollowing four points. \r\n First, in today’s world, interdependence among \r\nnations has grown to a point where no single nation, \r\nhowever big and powerful, can solve all its problems \r\non its own. The global economic and financial crisis \r\nthat has been raging all over the globe is evidence of \r\nthat. It was therefore opportune and encouraging that \r\nthe Assembly convened the World Summit on the \r\nEconomic and Financial Crisis in June and the World \r\nSummit on Climate Change in September, and, also in \r\nJune, adopted resolution 63/301 on the coup d’état in \r\nHonduras. Those events help prove that the General \r\nAssembly is the most appropriate forum in which all \r\nglobal stakeholders can come together, discuss and \r\nmake decisions on effective and sustainable solutions \r\nto issues of the utmost importance to the international \r\ncommunity. This is the judicious direction. \r\n In the same vein, we support the Assembly’s \r\nongoing discussions of topical global issues of \r\ninternational relevance — particularly those in the \r\nfields of development, peace and security, \r\nA/64/PV.48  \r\n \r\n09-61350 12 \r\n \r\nhumanitarian affairs and human rights — on the basis \r\nof consultations with Member States and taking into \r\nfull account the interests and concerns of the broad \r\nmembership, especially developing countries. \r\n Secondly, full implementation of all General \r\nAssembly resolutions remains essential to the process \r\nof the Assembly’s revitalization. My delegation’s view \r\nis that it is useful and legitimate to study the factual \r\nchart developed by the Ad Hoc Working Group during \r\nthe sixty-second session on the implementation of \r\nrelevant resolutions and to use it as a productive basis \r\nfor thorough discussion and honest assessment of this \r\nvital aspect of the work required to enhance the \r\nAssembly’s role and authority. \r\n Thirdly, the strengthening of the Office of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly is yet another issue \r\nkey to the revitalization of the Assembly’s work. To \r\nthat end, we believe it is necessary to ensure both the \r\nsufficient provision and the efficient use of financial \r\nand human resources for that Office in order to \r\nimprove its substantive work. We consider it advisable \r\nto study seriously the suggestions of a number of \r\ndelegations concerning the strengthening of the \r\nOffice’s institutional memory, as well as a best-\r\npractices paper that an incumbent President could draft \r\nfor his or her successor so as to facilitate the transition \r\nprocess. \r\n Fourthly, the process of revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly would be gravely deficient without \r\nimprovement of the cooperation and coordination \r\nbetween the Assembly and other principal organs of the \r\nUnited Nations and other international institutions and \r\ncivil society, as well as among the Main Committees \r\nand the Assembly’s subsidiary bodies. We welcome the \r\nAssembly’s decision to continue its consideration of \r\nthe revitalization of its role in the selection and \r\nappointment of the Secretary-General, for we believe \r\nthat will contribute positively to improving \r\ncoordination among the Assembly, the Security \r\nCouncil and the Secretary-General. That is why in July \r\nlast year, when Viet Nam held the presidency of the \r\nCouncil, the Vietnamese delegation launched \r\nconsultations with Member States on the draft annual \r\nreport of the Security Council to the General Assembly. \r\nLikewise, we support regular briefings of the Assembly \r\nby the Secretary-General and periodic meetings \r\nbetween the Assembly President and the Presidents of \r\nthe Security Council and the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil. More initiatives and measures should also be \r\nexplored to further improve the interaction among \r\ndifferent organs of the United Nations. \r\n We welcome the appointment of Ambassador \r\nSanja Štiglic of Slovenia and Ambassador Jorge \r\nArgüello of Argentina as Co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group during the sixty-fourth session.  \r\n We fully concur with the comments of the \r\nAssembly President at the 13th meeting, on the \r\nconclusion of the general debate at the sixty-fourth \r\nsession, that the best way to enhance multilateralism is \r\nto have a revitalized General Assembly as the main \r\ndeliberative, policymaking and decision-making organ \r\nof the United Nations. Let me reiterate Viet Nam’s firm \r\ncommitment to participate actively and constructively \r\nin the work on the revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly in the way forward towards that goal. \r\n Mr. Kleib (Indonesia): Let me begin by \r\ncommending the excellent work done by the two \r\nCo-Chairs of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the \r\nRevitalization of the General Assembly and the \r\nGroup’s report (A/63/959). We also thank them for the \r\nupdated inventory/chart on revitalization annexed to \r\nthe report, which is a valuable tool for monitoring the \r\nprogress in the Assembly’s effectiveness.  \r\n Indonesia associates itself with the statement \r\nmade by the delegation of Algeria on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement. \r\n We must all work together to strengthen the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s role as the chief deliberative, \r\npolicymaking and representative United Nations organ. \r\nWith membership from all United Nations States and \r\nan encompassing mandate, the Assembly is uniquely \r\npoised to comprehensively review and take policy \r\nactions on vital issues of concern to the world. \r\n Indonesia always supports the efforts to revitalize \r\nthe Assembly and to enhance its global status in \r\nrepresenting peoples’ wishes. We will continue to work \r\nactively to that end. I would like to share some of our \r\nthoughts on today’s critical agenda item. \r\n First, it is not because of any shortage of United \r\nNations resolutions and decisions that we continue to \r\nwork towards revitalization of the Assembly after 16 \r\nyears of debate on United Nations reform. It is the slow \r\nimplementation of, or lack of implementation of, the \r\nresolutions already adopted on the issue that is \r\nfundamentally responsible for the Assembly not being \r\nable to discharge its Charter role fully. Indeed, greater \r\n A/64/PV.48\r\n \r\n13 09-61350 \r\n \r\npolitical will on the part of all remains central to \r\nadvancing our collective efforts to energize the \r\nAssembly. In that regard, we were encouraged by the \r\nforward-looking work by the Ad Hoc Working Group \r\nduring the sixty-third session, including at its three \r\nthematic meetings on the crucial issues. We hope that \r\nthe Group will build on the many points of \r\nconvergence in the sixty-fourth session and that where \r\nthere are differences there will be further efforts to \r\nbridge them. \r\n Secondly, the role of the Office of the President \r\nof the General Assembly is undoubtedly very \r\nimportant, and it should be supported fully by the \r\nUnited Nations system. We support the strengthening \r\nof the institutional memory and functioning of the \r\nOffice of the President from separate and dedicated \r\nresources. We also share the view that the President \r\nshould make a comprehensive and analytical report at \r\nthe end of his or her tenure, providing assessments, \r\nparticularly where the decisions and actions of the \r\nAssembly could not be carried out. That would be \r\nuseful as an exercise in best practices and lessons \r\nlearned, as well as for enhancing cohesion among \r\nMember States.  \r\n The annual report of the Secretary-General on the \r\nwork of the Organization could also include the status \r\nof resolutions directly affecting the work of the United \r\nNations. \r\n Thirdly, the General Assembly, to demonstrate \r\nthat is in sync with the aspirations of the international \r\ncommunity and able to take necessary measures, must \r\nshow leadership by taking timely policy initiatives on \r\nissues of common concern and developing the required \r\nnorms. In this regard Indonesia lauds the initiative \r\nshown in convening in June the Conference on the \r\nWorld Financial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on \r\nDevelopment, and its Outcome (resolution 63/303, \r\nannex).  \r\n The Assembly should continue to examine the \r\nmajor political, social and economic issues in an \r\neffective manner. It should also play its due role in the \r\narea of international peace and security in accordance \r\nwith the Charter. It must increase its involvement in the \r\nUnited Nations peace architecture and further support \r\nefforts for effective and partnership-based \r\npeacekeeping and peacebuilding both at Headquarters \r\nand in the field. \r\n Fourthly, to tackle the complex and \r\nmultidimensional global challenges of the twenty-first \r\ncentury, it is vital that the relations among the principal \r\nUnited Nations organs be balanced and that there be \r\ncooperation and collaboration on the pertinent issues. \r\nWhile they must work within their respective \r\nmandates, they must continue to explore ways to build \r\nsynergies for targeted purposes. \r\n Here we need to be mindful of the important and \r\nsensitive linkages between the issue of the \r\nimplementation of General Assembly resolutions and \r\nthe ongoing processes of mandate review and Security \r\nCouncil reform. While some relevant topics will \r\ninvariably be considered by the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup, care should be taken that its examination does \r\nnot inadvertently interfere with the specific work \r\ncarried out in the other concerned United Nations \r\nintergovernmental forums. \r\n Fifthly, with respect to the appointment of the \r\nSecretary-General, we recognize that the Assembly has \r\nan instrumental role in making the process of selection \r\ntransparent, inclusive and open for consultation by the \r\nwider membership. While the existing selection \r\nprocess has produced distinguished and commendable \r\nSecretaries-General, that does not mean that the \r\nprocess itself is perfect. There is always room for \r\nimprovement in order to fulfil democratic principles. \r\nWithout prejudice to Article 97 of the Charter, we share \r\nthe views on the need for substantive interaction \r\nbetween the candidates and the Assembly. \r\n Finally, the global visibility and outreach \r\ncapacity of the General Assembly are essential for \r\nenhancing its influence on international affairs. The \r\nrequired support from the Committee on Information \r\nand the Department of Public Information in this \r\nrespect is critical. Creating ownership of the work of \r\nthe United Nations among the various global \r\nstakeholders is very important for the success of the \r\nobjectives of the Organization. Therefore, along with \r\ngreater dissemination and focused communication \r\nstrategies, meaningful interaction with civil society \r\nabout the issues under consideration by the Assembly \r\ncould contribute to the robust execution of the \r\nAssembly’s role.  \r\n Mr. Le Roux (South Africa): Our delegation \r\naligns itself with the statement delivered by the \r\nPermanent Representative of Algeria in his capacity as \r\nA/64/PV.48  \r\n \r\n09-61350 14 \r\n \r\ncoordinator of the Non-Aligned Movement’s Working \r\nGroup on the Revitalization of the General Assembly. \r\n South Africa also joins other delegations in \r\nconveying our sincere gratitude to the Co-Chairs of the \r\nAd Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly in the sixty-third session, \r\nAmbassador María Fernanda Espinosa of Ecuador and \r\nAmbassador Morten Wetland of Norway. We \r\ncongratulate them on a job well done. \r\n The General Assembly is the only body of the \r\nUnited Nations in which all 192 Members enjoy \r\nmembership and in which all the 192 take decisions as \r\na collective and as equals. Unfortunately, reality does \r\nnot always reflect this body’s importance. Too often \r\nthe Assembly is marginalized through the \r\nencroachment of its mandate by other United Nations \r\nbodies, most notably the Security Council. We reiterate \r\nthat the General Assembly is the main deliberative and \r\npolicymaking body of the United Nations. \r\n South Africa therefore unequivocally supports the \r\nAfrican position, as reflected in the Ezulwini \r\nConsensus of 2005, that calls for the General Assembly \r\nto be “strengthened for it to play its proper role as the \r\nmost representative and democratic body within the \r\nUnited Nations System and as the parliament of the \r\nworld”.  \r\n My delegation will continue to actively \r\nparticipate in the deliberations of the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup, with the aim of making the General Assembly \r\nmore transparent and responsive. As parliament of the \r\nworld, the Assembly must be able to respond and \r\naddress issues of concern that affect the whole world. \r\n In this regard, my delegation acknowledges with \r\nsatisfaction the Assembly’s thematic discussions in its \r\nprevious session, most notably at the high-level \r\nmeeting on the world economic crisis held in June \r\n2009. We have also noted that the Assembly took \r\naction on matters relating to international peace and \r\nsecurity, as mandated by the Charter, at its sixty-third \r\nsession; when it resumed its tenth emergency special \r\nsession, pursuant to “Uniting for Peace” (resolution \r\n377 (V)), to discuss the grave developments in Gaza; \r\nand when it took swift action to address the \r\nunconstitutional change of government in Honduras.  \r\n In spite of those developments, we firmly hold \r\nthe opinion that measures should be discussed and \r\nadopted to enhance the effectiveness of the General \r\nAssembly, especially regarding its role in maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security. \r\n South Africa does not wish to see the General \r\nAssembly usurp the role of the Security Council, but \r\nwe do advocate the need to improve on the balance of \r\ncompetence between the Assembly and the Council, as \r\nthe Ezulwini Consensus states. \r\n That is especially true with regard to the election \r\nof the Secretary-General of the Organization. We agree \r\nwith the statement by the Non-Aligned Movement that \r\nthe procedure to elect the Secretary-General \r\nestablished by resolution 11 (I) of 1946 should be \r\nreviewed, especially its paragraph 4 (d), which \r\nprovides that the Security Council should present the \r\nGeneral Assembly with one candidate, that “debate on \r\nthe nomination … should be avoided”, and that the \r\nnomination and appointment of the Secretary-General \r\nshould be discussed at private meetings. These aspects \r\nare not characteristic of a democratically functioning \r\norganization. In fact, resolution 51/241 provides a \r\nslightly more transparent framework for the selection \r\nof the Secretary-General, and that practice should be \r\nenhanced and developed further. \r\n My delegation is therefore pleased that resolution \r\n63/309, which establishes the Ad Hoc Working Group \r\non the Revitalization for this session, mandates the \r\nWorking Group to consider the role of the Assembly in \r\nthe selection and appointment of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. We look forward to participating \r\nconstructively in those discussions. In that connection, \r\nSouth Africa congratulates the Ambassadors of \r\nSlovenia and Argentina on their appointment as \r\nco-facilitators. They can be assured of South Africa’s \r\nfull support and cooperation. \r\n Finally, the President may be assured of my \r\ndelegation’s support for the strengthening of his office. \r\nWe look forward to hearing his views in that regard in \r\nthe Working Group, especially with regard to the \r\ninstitutional memory of his office, as mandated by \r\nresolution 63/309. \r\n Mrs. Aitimova (Kazakhstan): First of all, the \r\ndelegation of Kazakhstan would like to thank the \r\nPresident for continuing the discussion of the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly within the \r\nframework of the Assembly’s sixty-fourth session. \r\n I would also like to express our sincere gratitude \r\nto the Co-Chairs of the Working Group on the \r\n A/64/PV.48\r\n \r\n15 09-61350 \r\n \r\nRevitalization of the General Assembly — the \r\nPermanent Representatives of Ecuador, Ms. Maria \r\nFernanda Espinosa, and of Norway, Mr. Morten \r\nWetland — for the intensive work, as reflected in the \r\nreport of the Working Group presented in the last \r\nsession (A/63/959). Let me also congratulate the \r\nAmbassadors of Argentina and Slovenia on their recent \r\nappointment by the Assembly President as the new \r\nco-facilitators of the Working Group. It is our belief \r\nthat under their chairmanship the Working Group will \r\ncontinue to successfully execute the very important \r\nmandate of identifying further ways to enhance the \r\nrole, authority, effectiveness and efficiency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n To date, there has been some progress in \r\nimproving the efficiency of the General Assembly and \r\nits working methods. In particular, we commend the \r\npractical approach of analysing in detail the status of \r\nimplementation of existing resolutions and decisions \r\non revitalization, on the basis of the updated \r\ninventory/chart. The chart is a useful instrument for \r\nassessing and consolidating the status of \r\nimplementation of the main provisions of relevant \r\nresolutions, which have been distributed across three \r\nmain clusters. In our view, the chart of the status of \r\nimplementation should form the basis for the \r\nAssembly’s deliberations.  \r\n Another example of a positive shift that we would \r\nlike to mention is the regular meetings held by the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly with the Presidents \r\nof the Security Council and the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil to ensure increased cooperation, coordination \r\nand complementarity in the work programmes of three \r\nprincipal bodies of the United Nations. Moreover, in \r\nrecent years, the Presidents of the General Assembly \r\nhave been proactive in addressing the most pressing \r\nglobal issues through thematic debates and informal \r\nplenary meetings. \r\n At this stage of the discussion, we should be able \r\nto decide what modalities of operation the Working \r\nGroup on Revitalization should adopt during this \r\nsession of the Assembly. We think that the Working \r\nGroup should organize its work programme around \r\nholding general discussions and exchanges of views, \r\norganized thematic meetings and briefings. \r\n As to which aspects of General Assembly \r\nrevitalization require our careful attention, I would \r\nsingle out three.  \r\n First, it is clear that the ultimate goal of the \r\nGeneral Assembly reform process is to make it the \r\nmain deliberative, policy-making and representative \r\norgan of the United Nations. No one can disagree with \r\nthat. General Assembly reform is closely linked to the \r\nreform of other principal bodies of the United Nations \r\nand their working methods. Although the division of \r\nlabour between three principal bodies is duly reflected \r\nin the Charter of the United Nations, we are still \r\ndebating the disparity of power. A strong political will \r\non the part of the Member States is needed if they are \r\nto evaluate a balance among the principal bodies of the \r\nUnited Nations with a view to making the Councils \r\nmore accountable to the General Assembly and to \r\naligning their work programmes. \r\n Secondly, it is very important to strengthen the \r\ninstitutional memory of the Office of the President of \r\nthe General Assembly by enhancing the role of core \r\nstaff members and improving the functions of the \r\nOffice and its relationship with the Secretariat. We \r\nvoice our support for strengthening both the financial \r\nand human resources for the Office of the President. \r\n Thirdly, proper consideration should be given to \r\nthe question of the role and responsibility of the \r\nGeneral Assembly in the process of selecting and \r\nappointing the Secretary-General. The Member States \r\nshould move forward in their consultations and reach \r\nan agreement that procedures for selecting the \r\nSecretary-General should be formalized and carried out \r\nin a timely, transparent and inclusive manner. \r\n There is no doubt that the issues of the \r\nAssembly’s visibility and public outreach capacity, its \r\nrelationship with the Secretariat, new technological and \r\nballoting options, media coverage and improvements in \r\ndocumentation are no less important. Nevertheless, in \r\nour view, the ultimate goal of General Assembly \r\nreform will not be reached unless we have come to \r\nterms with the three principal aspects I have just \r\ndiscussed. \r\n Another issue that relates to those of a \r\nrecommendatory nature is put forward by the General \r\nAssembly in the operative parts of its resolutions. We \r\nthink that it is now time to collectively resolve the \r\nissue of making it mandatory for Member States to \r\nimplement General Assembly recommendations, even \r\nif this would require the introduction of certain \r\namendments to the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nA/64/PV.48  \r\n \r\n09-61350 16 \r\n \r\n Kazakhstan believes that the major global \r\nissues — such as the financial crisis and progress on \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals — should be \r\ndiscussed not only at high-level meetings, as \r\ntraditionally done on the eve of the opening of the \r\ngeneral debate at the General Assembly’s annual \r\nsession, but directly within the plenary sessions of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, not outside them. \r\n In conclusion, I should like to reiterate \r\nKazakhstan’s firm position that a stronger General \r\nAssembly would help strengthen multilateralism in \r\nterms of transparency and inclusiveness. Kazakhstan is \r\ncommitted to the revitalization of the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly as an essential element of the United \r\nNations reform process as a whole. \r\n Mr. Núñez Mosquera (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nMy delegation associates itself with the statements \r\nmade by the representative of Algeria, on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement, and by the representative of \r\nMexico, on behalf of the Rio Group. I should like to \r\nadd some remarks on this item. \r\n First of all, I should like to thank the Co-Chairs \r\nof the Ad Hoc Working Group on the revitalization of \r\nthe General Assembly for having prepared the report \r\non this matter (A/63/959) and for their efforts to make \r\nprogress in revitalizing the General Assembly. \r\n The revitalization of the General Assembly \r\nconstitutes a determining element in any genuine \r\nreform of the United Nations. We cannot hope to have \r\nan Organization whose actions are fully democratic and \r\neffective as long as the General Assembly does not \r\nfully exercise the faculties accorded to it in the Charter. \r\nThis process of revitalization must have as its aim the \r\nreaffirmation of the central role of the General \r\nAssembly as the principal deliberative, policy-making \r\nand representative body of the United Nations, just as \r\nit is recognized to be in the Charter and the Millennium \r\nDeclaration. It is important that this process culminate \r\nin an Assembly strengthened in its independence and in \r\nits nature as a body for inclusive debate, in which \r\nMember States enjoy unrestricted and unlimited \r\nfreedom to consider any matter they deem to be of \r\ninterest. \r\n If we wish to restore the confidence of the \r\ninternational community in the United Nations, and, \r\nabove all, its credibility in global public opinion, then \r\nwe must ensure that our Organization truly responds to \r\nthe collective interests of its Member States. That can \r\nonly be achieved by revitalizing the leading role of the \r\nGeneral Assembly as the only United Nations body in \r\nwhich there is no place for hegemonies, where we all \r\nhave a voice and a vote and where the obsolete right of \r\nveto does not exist. \r\n The General Assembly can and must examine \r\ncrucial and urgent matters of international significance \r\nwith a view to adopting concrete and action-oriented \r\nresolutions. In our view, the main problem of the \r\nOrganization today is precisely the lack of \r\nimplementation of the numerous resolutions adopted \r\nby the General Assembly, which constitute an \r\nimportant set of regulations but remain inert, since \r\ntheir implementation depends on the political will of \r\nthose States that have the political, military or \r\neconomic power to do so. The same applies to the \r\nnumerous resolutions on the revitalization of the \r\nAssembly, whose implementation has been very \r\nlimited indeed. \r\n Cuba stresses the need to attain a proper balance \r\namong the main bodies of the United Nations, in \r\naccordance with the Charter, and for Member States to \r\nput an end to any attempt to transfer items from the \r\nagenda of the General Assembly to the Security \r\nCouncil. The Security Council should strictly observe \r\nthe provisions of the Charter, as well as all resolutions \r\nof the General Assembly, as the principal body of the \r\nUnited Nations, and must desist from interfering in \r\nmatters that clearly fall within the functions and \r\npowers of other bodies. \r\n The delegation of Cuba wishes to express its \r\nconcern at the establishment of norms and definitions \r\nby the Security Council that go beyond the competence \r\nof that body, actions that ignore the fact that, under \r\nArticle 13 of the Charter, the General Assembly has the \r\nprimary responsibility for the progressive development \r\nof international law and its codification. \r\n The revitalization of the General Assembly \r\ncannot be a bureaucratic process. As Father Miguel \r\nD’Escoto wisely said in his farewell address as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-third \r\nsession, “revitalization is a political rather than a \r\ntechnical issue” (A/63/PV.105). \r\n We hope that, as a result of the revitalization \r\nprocess, the interaction between the Secretariat and the \r\nGeneral Assembly will be strengthened, so that the \r\nformer can respond more effectively to the mandates \r\nset by the Member States. \r\n A/64/PV.48\r\n \r\n17 09-61350 \r\n \r\n Additionally, as part of the work by the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group on revitalization, strict attention should \r\nbe paid to the implementation of the resolutions on this \r\nmatter. Also, the chart that lists the resolutions on the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly should be \r\nappropriately updated. We already have a powerful \r\nlegislative arsenal relating to the necessary \r\nrevitalization of this principal body. The priority must \r\nbe precisely to implement the multiple resolutions that \r\nhave already been adopted. \r\n The Cuban delegation wishes to conclude by \r\nreiterating its willingness to continue collaborating on \r\nthe ongoing work aimed at achieving the important and \r\nnecessary objective of revitalizing the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Mr. Chávez (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): At the \r\noutset, I should like to welcome the decision of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly to appoint the \r\nPermanent Representatives of Argentina, Ambassador \r\nJorge Argüello, and Slovenia, Ambassador Sanja \r\nŠtiglic, as Co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc Working Group on \r\nthe revitalization of the work of the General Assembly \r\nat the present session of the Assembly. We express our \r\nwarm congratulations to them and pledge our full \r\nsupport for the important task they have assumed. We \r\nare sure that, under their wise guidance, we will make \r\nprogress towards our goal of revitalizing this \r\nmultilateral forum. \r\n I also reaffirm our particular gratitude for the \r\nexcellent work carried out by the former Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Ecuador, Ambassador María \r\nFernanda Espinosa, and the Permanent Representative \r\nof Norway, Ambassador Morten Wetland, in leading \r\nthe Ad Hoc Working Group during the last session of \r\nthe General Assembly. The significant contributions \r\nthey made have laid the groundwork for the work that \r\nwe will carry out starting today. \r\n In this world, where the various problems facing \r\nhumanity demand swift and timely responses, \r\norganizations must be able to adapt. However, taking a \r\nlook at the agenda of the General Assembly, we see a \r\nproliferation of topics that do not necessarily reflect \r\nthe priorities of the international agenda but, rather, \r\ndivert our efforts. Many of them, because of their \r\nlimited scope, could be tackled in other hemispheric \r\nforums. Other topics that are of a very specific nature \r\nwould be better dealt with in specialized forums. We \r\nmust also seek to limit the automatic and mechanical \r\nrepetition of the topics that we address. We therefore \r\nbelieve that this programme must be reviewed. \r\n Ms. Aitimova (Kazakhstan), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n We also believe that the General Assembly should \r\nbe proactive and not limit itself to drawn-out debates, \r\nwhich will only be remembered within this \r\nOrganization and have little practical effect on the \r\nground. Along these lines, we must be able to move \r\nahead in defining the essential subjects on which the \r\nGeneral Assembly should focus its work in order to \r\nproduce concrete and verifiable results that are noticed \r\nby public opinion. \r\n My delegation believes it is important to foster a \r\ncloser relationship between the President of the \r\nAssembly and the Chairpersons of the Main \r\nCommittees, as well as other United Nations organs in \r\nwhich relevant matters on the international agenda are \r\naddressed. Greater involvement on the part of the \r\nPresident would lead to greater visibility and ability to \r\nreach the general public. This is essential when it \r\ncomes to raising the profile and voice of the President \r\nof the Assembly in international public opinion. \r\n We all agree on the importance of the President’s \r\nprofile and the role the President must play during his \r\nor her tenure in lending weight and relevance to the \r\nGeneral Assembly. Unfortunately, the annual change of \r\nthe presidency makes it difficult to produce significant \r\nresults. Despite this, it is possible to ensure effective \r\nand efficient management of the presidency. For this \r\nreason it is essential that we strengthen the capacities \r\nof the Office of the presidency by creating an ad hoc \r\nteam that remains over time and does not rotate yearly. \r\nTo the degree that this is possible, we would be \r\npromoting more streamlined and efficient work, which \r\nwould permit us to maintain the presidency’s \r\ninstitutional memory. The ad hoc team should have \r\nsufficient capacity to support, with greater \r\neffectiveness and continuity over time, all the work of \r\ninformation management, as well as to cooperate \r\nsubstantively on the many tasks involved in \r\ncoordinating the work of the presidency with the \r\nSecretariat and the Chairs of the Main Committees. \r\n The function of the Office of the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly cannot be separated from the actual \r\nfigure of the President. For this reason, the \r\nstrengthening of the Office of the presidency will, in \r\nthe end, be a natural consequence of the ability of the \r\nA/64/PV.48  \r\n \r\n09-61350 18 \r\n \r\nPresident to guide the work of the Assembly, generate \r\nconsensus, bring rapprochement between differing \r\npositions, and place him or her above the various \r\ninterests in play in order to foster dialogue, which will \r\nallow all of us to identify with this unifying function. \r\nThe President must be able to maintain a profile \r\nconducive to the important work of the Office and that, \r\nas we are all aware, reflects the efficient management \r\nof the Office and of the Assembly itself. \r\n We have made progress in updating the synoptic \r\nchart of the General Assembly’s resolutions on \r\nrevitalization. This chart should, however, be dynamic, \r\nflexible, easy to understand and results-oriented. In this \r\nregard, for instance, resolutions that have already been \r\nimplemented could be compiled in an annex to the \r\nrules of the Assembly. Concerning the voting system, \r\nwe will continue to participate constructively in the \r\nreview of the secret ballot proposals that have been \r\nmade with a view to establishing a fast, efficient and \r\nsecure system that will ensure the credibility, reliability \r\nand confidentiality of the secret ballot process. \r\n Regarding the role and responsibility of the \r\nGeneral Assembly in the selection of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, we believe the Assembly should play a more \r\nproactive role, in keeping with that established in the \r\nCharter and in resolutions adopted by the Assembly \r\nitself. Organizing meetings with the candidates in the \r\nAssembly and/or with regional groups could be a first \r\nstep for greater involvement on the part of the \r\nAssembly in the election of the Secretary-General. We \r\nalso stress that in appointing the Secretary-General and \r\nin accordance with resolutions on this subject, due \r\nattention should be paid to regional rotation and to \r\ngender equality. \r\n In conclusion, allow me to reaffirm the \r\ncommitment of the Peruvian delegation to continue to \r\nsupport all efforts aimed at revitalizing the General \r\nAssembly. With this in mind, we will participate \r\nconstructively in the work that develops during the \r\ncurrent session. \r\n Mr. Okuda (Japan): First of all, I would like to \r\nextend my sincere gratitude to the President for \r\nconvening today’s meeting to discuss one of the most \r\nimportant items on the General Assembly’s agenda, the \r\nrevitalization of its work. I would like also to thank the \r\nCo-Chairs of the previous Ad Hoc Working Group on \r\nthe revitalization of the General Assembly, \r\nAmbassador Maria Fernanda Espinosa of Ecuador and \r\nAmbassador Morten Wetland of Norway, for their \r\nexcellent work, detailed in their report (A/63/959) and \r\nAssembly resolution 63/309. Let me also warmly \r\nwelcome the co-facilitators in this process, \r\nAmbassador Sanja Štiglić of Slovenia and Ambassador \r\nJorge Argüello of Argentina; I expect to cooperate \r\nclosely with them as we continue to work on these \r\nessential issues. \r\n The General Assembly is the most representative \r\norgan of the United Nations, one in which all Member \r\nStates participate. Despite an exception in Article 12, \r\nparagraph 1, of the Charter of the United Nations, the \r\nAssembly is mandated to address any issues and \r\nquestions determined by the Charter. Japan is \r\ncommitted to the process of revitalizing the Assembly \r\nand will continue to contribute to the activities to be \r\ncarried out in this regard. \r\n My delegation would like to single out the issue \r\nof thematic debates, which we consider very useful in \r\npromoting Member States’ understanding of the \r\nordering of priorities on the United Nations agenda. We \r\nwelcomed the thematic debates organized in the past \r\nyear on global issues such as the financial crisis, the \r\nfood crisis, and problems of energy and natural \r\nresources, as well as today’s important topic of human \r\nsecurity. Japan believes that we should create \r\nmechanisms to link such debates to various concrete \r\nactivities of the Assembly. The selection of the subjects \r\nof debates is also crucial. I would like to stress that, in \r\norder to keep thematic debates within the United \r\nNations limited resources, the theme and content of \r\ndiscussions must be carefully selected on a case-by-\r\ncase basis. I hope that Presidents of the General \r\nAssembly and Member States will consult closely in \r\nthis regard. \r\n Japan recognizes the importance of continuing to \r\nreview the status of implementation of General \r\nAssembly resolutions, and commends the Secretariat’s \r\nstrenuous work in issuing its related report in February \r\n(A/62/952/Add.1). We expect that monitoring of the \r\nimplementation of Assembly resolutions will be \r\nimproved in the wake of that document. \r\n Japan welcomes the submission of annual reports \r\nby the Security Council to the General Assembly, the \r\nregular consultations between the presidents of the \r\nCouncil and the Assembly, and the timely \r\ncommunications from the Secretary-General to the \r\nAssembly. We firmly hope that the Assembly’s \r\n A/64/PV.48\r\n \r\n19 09-61350 \r\n \r\nrelationship and coordination with the other principal \r\norgans will be further strengthened and improved as \r\nthis process continues. \r\n We should also note that the General Assembly, \r\njointly with the Security Council, is a supervisory body \r\nof the Peacebuilding Commission. Japan commends \r\nthe active discussion in both the Assembly and the \r\nSecurity Council on the Peacebuilding Commission’s \r\nannual report, as this contributes further to reinforcing \r\nthe links between the two main bodies of the United \r\nNations. \r\n We note that the introduction of a voting system \r\nfor the Assembly using new technology is being \r\nexamined in the framework of the Capital Master Plan. \r\nThis should be done on condition that it takes Member \r\nStates’ needs and their concerns about secrecy and \r\nsecurity into full consideration, as well as rationally \r\nutilization of existing financial resources without any \r\nadditional budgetary requirements. I expect the \r\nSecretariat to consult with the Member States for these \r\npurposes. \r\n As we look forward to the imminent constructive \r\ndiscussions on this agenda, my delegation reiterates its \r\ncommitment to contributing to revitalizing the work of \r\nthe General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Fazal (Singapore): In Bleak House, Dickens \r\nwrote:  \r\n“This scarecrow of a suit has … become so \r\ncomplicated that no man alive knows what it \r\nmeans. The parties to it understand it least, but it \r\nhas been observed that no two Chancery lawyers \r\ncan talk about it for five minutes without coming \r\nto a total disagreement as to all the premises.”  \r\nI am sure that this state of affairs will not seem \r\nunfamiliar to representatives in this Hall as we discuss \r\nthe revitalization of the General Assembly and \r\nnegotiate the remaining resolutions on the agenda of \r\nthe sixty-fourth session. \r\n Indeed, revitalization of the General Assembly is \r\na subject that we have been struggling with for some \r\ntime, along with other pressing issues of United \r\nNations reform. We must press on, and do so knowing \r\nthat we do not have the luxury of time. For too long, \r\nwe in this house believed that there were no serious \r\nchallengers to this model of international organization. \r\nThe rise of alternative global governance structures \r\nsuch as the Group of 20 and the expansion of its \r\nagenda beyond the financial crisis to trade and labour \r\nissues have renewed questions and doubts about the \r\nrelevance of the United Nations and the General \r\nAssembly.  \r\n For Lilliputian States like Singapore, \r\nmultilateralism has always been a vital defence against \r\nthe Gullivers of the international stage. It is in this vein \r\nthat we see the General Assembly’s vigour and \r\nrelevance as an issue of paramount importance, \r\nparticularly since a key characteristic of the General \r\nAssembly is its unique legitimacy arising from its \r\nuniversal membership. \r\n Singapore has always held the view that the task \r\nof revitalizing the General Assembly and of reforming \r\nthe United Nations in general must be done in a \r\npragmatic fashion. It is not practical or realistic to \r\nbelieve we can simply tear down the General Assembly \r\nand build a new one. Rather, we must clean up our \r\nhouse one room at a time. That can appear to be \r\ntedious work, but it must be done. More importantly, it \r\nshould be done by all of us, as all Member States have \r\nmuch to gain from a tidier house. In this regard, \r\nSingapore recognizes the important contributions of \r\npast Ad Hoc Working Groups on this agenda item, \r\nincluding efforts to streamline the work of the General \r\nAssembly through the biennialization, triennialization, \r\nthematic clustering and elimination of items on its \r\nagenda, as well as the introduction of a sunset clause \r\non resolutions. \r\n Aside from the important micro-reforms that we \r\nmust take to improve the efficiency and effectiveness \r\nof the Assembly, our revitalization efforts this year \r\nshould also focus on macro-reforms. Let me highlight \r\ntwo issues in this regard.  \r\n First, we should strengthen United Nations \r\nbudgetary processes. Member States should have a say \r\nover the budget of the Organization, but the prevailing \r\nclimate of excessive micromanagement and politicking \r\namongst Member States on administrative and \r\nbudgetary issues has led, ironically, to the proliferation \r\nof bureaucracy and the wastage of resources.  \r\n Let us do something about that. Let us refocus \r\ndiscussions on finance and budget issues at a broader \r\nand more strategic level. For instance, we could devote \r\nmore time to examine the drivers behind the growth of \r\nvarious components of the budget to see if these are \r\nreasonable and commensurate with the commitments of \r\nthe United Nations in an increasingly complex and \r\nA/64/PV.48  \r\n \r\n09-61350 20 \r\n \r\nvolatile world. I am thinking of the special political \r\nmissions, whose share of the regular budget has \r\nballooned tremendously in recent years and engendered \r\nthe inaccurate perception that the United Nations \r\nbudget is somehow spiralling out of control. Another \r\nexample is in the area of human resources reform. Are \r\nwe paying sufficient attention to the performance \r\nmanagement of United Nations staff to ensure that they \r\ndeliver their best? \r\n Secondly, we should review and reprioritize the \r\nGeneral Assembly agenda, especially high-level \r\nevents. We should take into account what developed \r\nand developing countries alike want to discuss, with an \r\neye to the timeliness and relevance of these events. \r\nThis approach would help to garner more buy-in from \r\nMember States and sustain the interest of our capitals \r\nin attending these events. The harsh reality is that the \r\nactivities of the General Assembly risk becoming a \r\nsideshow to the activities of other forums if we fall out \r\nof sync with the relevant and pressing issues of the \r\nday. \r\n Alternative forums emerge in the vacuum of \r\nleadership the United Nations cedes, whether \r\nconsciously or inadvertently. The General Assembly \r\nmay be the most legitimate forum for the deliberation \r\nof multilateral issues, but we must beware of relegating \r\nourselves to the sidelines as a result of our own \r\nineffectiveness. All too often, our discourse \r\ndegenerates into deadlocks animated by dogmatic \r\nsparring.  \r\n We can do better than that. Our emergence from \r\nthe trough of the world financial and economic crisis \r\nprovides us with a brief window of respite to reflect \r\nand take the necessary steps to revitalize the General \r\nAssembly. We should not squander that opportunity. \r\n Mr. Andrianarivelo-Razafy (Madagascar) \r\n(spoke in French): The Madagascar delegation \r\nassociates itself with the statement made by the \r\nPermanent Representative of Algeria on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement. Nevertheless, my delegation \r\nwould like to make some comments in its national \r\ncapacity. \r\n Today, we are addressing a topic that covers \r\nissues of great interest to States Members of the United \r\nNations. My delegation would like to commend the \r\nefforts made and the commitment shown to our \r\nOrganization during this session.  \r\n The General Assembly remains the core \r\nframework for reaching global consensus on major \r\ncontemporary problems and for taking decisions or \r\nmaking recommendations on concerted action to deal \r\nwith the interdependent threats that currently imperil \r\nthe world. The General Assembly is thus an instrument \r\nfor effective multilateralism and a unique forum for \r\ndialogue. Any reform should therefore improve the \r\neffectiveness and credibility of our Organization, \r\nwhich is a universal symbol for translating our people’s \r\naspirations to peace into action.  \r\n Madagascar greatly values the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and efforts to strengthen the role of \r\nthe Organization. It reaffirms its commitment to the \r\npurposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and to international law, which are the \r\nessential foundations of a more peaceful and fairer \r\nworld. \r\n Madagascar recognizes the significant \r\nachievements made in making this Organization more \r\ndemocratic and efficient, while respecting the role and \r\nauthority of the General Assembly. In this regard, my \r\ndelegation read with interest the report of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group on the Revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly (A/63/959), and should like, in its national \r\ncapacity, to highlight the injustice that we suffered \r\nduring the general debate of the sixty-fourth session on \r\n25 September 2009.  \r\n With respect to rule 71 of the General Assembly’s \r\nrules of procedure, the issue of Madagascar’s \r\nrepresentation was not on the agenda of the general \r\ndebate, to which all States, including Madagascar, are \r\ninvited, as they are each year, to put forward their \r\nopinions and to speak to this Assembly. Furthermore, \r\naccording to document A/INF/64/3/Rev.1 on the \r\nprogramme of work of the General Assembly and the \r\nschedule of plenary meetings, the Credentials \r\nCommittee will not present its report to the General \r\nAssembly until Monday, 14 December 2009. That \r\nmeans the Committee has not yet made a statement on \r\nthe case of Madagascar’s participation in the work of \r\nthe sixty-fourth session. \r\n Thus, pursuant to rule 29 of the rules of \r\nprocedures, the head of the delegation of Madagascar \r\nmaintains the same rights as other representatives. \r\nMoreover, I would note that at no time to date has a \r\ndelegation questioned the validity of Madagascar’s \r\ncredentials. Hence, Madagascar is neither excluded nor \r\n A/64/PV.48\r\n \r\n21 09-61350 \r\n \r\nsuspended from its rights and privileges as a member \r\nunder rule 83 of the rules of procedures, which requires \r\nthat decisions on important questions, such as the \r\ndetermination of a State Member’s sovereignty, shall \r\nbe made by a two-thirds majority of the members \r\npresent and voting. For the sake of good sense and \r\nrespect for democracy, that question should not be left \r\nin the hands of a small number of States.  \r\n Madagascar has been the subject of no sanction \r\neither by the Security Council or the General Assembly \r\nand therefore cannot be denied its right to take the \r\nfloor. That is an assault on the sovereignty of my \r\ncountry and a violation of the inalienable right of the \r\nMalagasy people. In the name of the rule of law in \r\ninternational relations, we denounce that denial with all \r\nour might. \r\n We reaffirm our full and unreserved commitment \r\nto the principles and aims of non-alignment, inter alia, \r\nthe respect of the sovereignty and territorial integrity \r\nof States and the principle of non-intervention and \r\nnon-interference in a country’s domestic affairs. Those \r\nprinciples are universally recognized by the \r\ninternational community. In that regard, any procedure \r\nshould be carried out in respect for the standards and \r\nprinciples of the Organization that we ourselves, the \r\npeoples of the United Nations, have adopted. We are in \r\na system that respects the rule of law and democratic \r\nprocesses.  \r\n We hope that such a deeply regrettable incident \r\nwill not recur. That extremely serious incident must in \r\nno way serve as a precedent within the Organization or \r\nin the annals of the United Nations. The Madagascar \r\ndelegation supports every initiative to improve and \r\nrevitalize the work of the General Assembly in order to \r\nmake it more effective and credible. \r\n Madagascar endorses the Declaration on \r\nPrinciples of International Law concerning Friendly \r\nRelations and Cooperation among States in accordance \r\nwith the Charter of the United Nations, contained in \r\nresolution 2625 (XXV) of 24 October 1970, which \r\nstipulates, in its section on the principle of sovereign \r\nequality of States that all States enjoy equal \r\nsovereignty, that they have equal rights and duties and \r\nare equal members of the international community, \r\nnotwithstanding economic, social, political or other \r\ndifferences. That further complements the provisions of \r\nArticle 14 of the Charter on the functions and powers \r\nof the General Assembly, which stipulates that  \r\n“the General Assembly may recommend \r\nmeasures for the peaceful adjustment of any \r\nsituation, regardless of origin, which it deems \r\nlikely to impair the general welfare or friendly \r\nrelations among nations”.  \r\n Ms. Blum (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the delegation of Colombia, I would like to \r\nrecognize the work of the Ad Hoc Working Group on \r\nthe Revitalization of the General Assembly and, in \r\nparticular, the work and dedication of its co-Chairs, the \r\nAmbassadors of Ecuador and Norway. Resolution \r\n63/309, adopted on 14 September, and the report of the \r\nWorking Group (A/63/959) reflect the work undertaken \r\nin this area. \r\n I would also like to congratulate Ambassadors \r\nArgüello of Argentina and Štiglic of Slovenia for their \r\nappointment as co-facilitators of the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup. We wish them every success in their important \r\nwork. They can count on the support of my delegation \r\nin carrying out their work. \r\n My delegation aligns itself with the statements \r\nmade by the representatives of Mexico on behalf of the \r\nRio Group and of Algeria on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement. \r\n For my Government, the efforts to strengthen the \r\nGeneral Assembly and its role as the principal organ \r\nfor participation, deliberation and policy development, \r\nare a priority. We reiterate our commitment to further \r\nenhancing the role, authority and effectiveness of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. I wish to underscore the innovation \r\ndistinction made in resolution 63/309 between \r\nsubstantive questions and procedural aspects related to \r\nworking methods. That modification allows a \r\nconceptual step forward in the analysis of topics \r\nrelated to revitalization and reflects methodological \r\nsuggestions made by several delegations, including that \r\nof Colombia, during the meetings of the Working \r\nGroup. \r\n The initiatives proposed by delegations and \r\ndescribed in the report of the Working Group with \r\nrespect to the more active participation of the General \r\nAssembly in selecting the Secretary-General deserve to \r\nbe highlighted. Greater interaction between prospective \r\ncandidates and the General Assembly, with \r\npresentations before the plenary and regional groups, \r\nwould undoubtedly promote a better selection process. \r\nA/64/PV.48  \r\n \r\n09-61350 22 \r\n \r\n Coordination among the three principal organs of \r\nthe United Nations — the General Assembly, the \r\nSecurity Council and the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil — should be broadened and improved. Such \r\ncoordination, based on the distribution of \r\nresponsibilities pursuant to the Charter, could be \r\nsupported by improved information exchange on the \r\nwork of those organs, the convening of monthly \r\nmeetings between them, and the submission of periodic \r\nreports. \r\n The challenges arising from the new global \r\nrealities need to be addressed in universal forums, such \r\nas the General Assembly. The development of \r\ninteractive thematic debates at the previous session is a \r\nstep in that direction. We encourage the President of \r\nthe General Assembly to continue such debates and to \r\nconvene special meetings to address situations of \r\ninternational importance. \r\n Support for the Office of the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly through the allocation of required \r\nresources will allow for the strengthening of its \r\ninstitutional memory and a better dissemination of its \r\nwork. It is important that the analysis of these issues be \r\naddressed by the Working Group established to review \r\nthe revitalization of this body. \r\n Other issues, such as balloting, the more efficient \r\nhandling of documentation and the introduction of new \r\ntechnologies to improve the balloting process and \r\nmake it more transparent, must be addressed as a \r\nmatter of priority. We also hope that the consideration \r\nof those issues, from a technological and budgetary \r\nstandpoint, will be part of the work of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group. \r\n In order to streamline and optimize the work of \r\nthis main organ, it is important that we move ahead in \r\nupdating and implementing resolutions on the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly at this session. \r\nMy delegation also wishes to highlight the request in \r\nresolution 63/309 to the President of the Assembly that \r\nhe, in consultation with Member States, make \r\nproposals for grouping agenda items so that some can \r\nbe addressed every two or three years. The introduction \r\nof a sunset clause would also contribute to making our \r\nwork more rational. \r\n Finally, we support the idea of developing \r\nspecific action plans for each thematic area as part of \r\nthe work of the Working Group. Such plans would \r\nenable the Group to envisage elements and critical \r\npathways leading to concrete results. Each action plan \r\nwould define the objectives to be achieved, the analysis \r\nof their budgetary and/or legal viability, the specific \r\nactivities to be carried out and their timelines, as well \r\nas the bodies responsible for their implementation. \r\n My delegation trusts that, with such initiatives, \r\nthe process of revitalizing the General Assembly can \r\ndeliver tangible results. We must focus our efforts on a \r\npractical approach to that end. My delegation reiterates \r\nits willingness to cooperate resolutely in this important \r\nwork. \r\n Mr. Kim Bonghyun (Republic of Korea): At the \r\noutset, I should like to thank President Treki for having \r\nconvened this debate and provided the membership \r\nwith a meaningful opportunity to consider the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly during this \r\nsession. We should also like to express our gratitude to \r\nthe former Permanent Representative of Ecuador and \r\nthe Permanent Representative of Norway for their \r\nexcellent work as co-Chairs of the Report of the Ad \r\nHoc Working Group on the Revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at the sixty-third session. I also \r\ncongratulate the new co-Chairs, the Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of Slovenia and Argentina. We are \r\nready to extend our full support to their efforts on this \r\nissue. \r\n As we are all aware, the issue of the revitalization \r\nof the General Assembly has been on our agenda for \r\nmany years. So far, a wide range of issues has been \r\ndiscussed and multiple resolutions have been adopted. \r\nIn particular, the report of the Ad Hoc Working Group \r\n(A/63/959) was adopted at the sixty-third session. We \r\nhave been able to build upon that report in our further \r\ndiscussions on this issue. \r\n My delegation believes that a more focused \r\napproach needs to be introduced to bring about \r\nsubstantial results in our future deliberations on this \r\nissue. First, more efforts should be geared towards \r\nmaking the General Assembly a more efficient and \r\neffective body and helping it make use of its resources \r\nin a cost-effective manner. In this regard, efforts to \r\nthoroughly review existing resolutions on revitalization \r\nneed to be scaled up. We need to examine which \r\nresolutions have been well implemented and which \r\nhave not, and the reasons why. The inventory chart \r\ndeveloped at the sixty-second session will be a good \r\nbase in this regard. Furthermore, the General Assembly \r\nneeds to restructure its agenda and focus its work on \r\n A/64/PV.48\r\n \r\n23 09-61350 \r\n \r\nmore priority issues. The possibility of eliminating, \r\nclustering or biennializing Assembly agenda items \r\nshould be explored in detail. \r\n Secondly, it is important for the General \r\nAssembly to enhance cooperation and coordination \r\nwith other main organs in exercising their \r\ncompetencies. We should approach this point from the \r\nperspective of coordination among the main organs, \r\nnot from the perspective of competition. In that regard, \r\nwe would like to encourage the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly to meet periodically with the \r\nSecretary-General, the Presidents of the Security \r\nCouncil and the Economic and Social Council, and the \r\nchairs of the Main Committees, and to share the \r\noutcome of these interactions with Member States. \r\nThis will facilitate the streamlining of agendas and \r\nhelp reduce duplication of work. In this regard, we \r\nfully support and value the practical initiative of the \r\nSecretary-General to provide timely briefings to the \r\nGeneral Assembly on his activities and the work of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n Thirdly, we agree that it is desirable to continue \r\nto hold thematic debates on issues of relevance to the \r\ninternational community and of concern to the \r\nOrganization. This will contribute to raising political \r\nwill and momentum on current issues that warrant \r\ncollective endeavours on the part of the international \r\ncommunity. Therefore, we believe that the thematic \r\ndebate should produce more action-oriented results. \r\nFurthermore, we would like to encourage the President \r\nof the General Assembly to work closely with Member \r\nStates in deciding specific themes and setting the \r\ntiming of thematic debates in a more transparent and \r\neffective manner. We would also like to suggest that \r\nthe General Assembly undertake review processes for \r\npast thematic debates to evaluate how much added \r\nvalue they have produced. This will provide us with a \r\nguide for preparing future thematic debates in a more \r\nproductive manner. \r\n The revitalization of the General Assembly is an \r\nongoing process. Indeed, we have a wide variety of \r\nissues on the table relating to the revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly that need further deliberation. My \r\ndelegation looks forward to the re-establishment of the \r\nAd Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly during this session, as called for in \r\nresolution 63/309. We need to agree on specific issues \r\nto address, including the working methods, and focus \r\non achieving tangible results on them without \r\noverextending ourselves with too broad a workload. \r\n My delegation will continue to actively \r\nparticipate in future debates with a view to contributing \r\nto a successful and productive outcome of our \r\ncollective endeavours aimed at further revitalizing the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n Mrs. Rubiales de Chamarro (Nicaragua) (spoke \r\nin Spanish): The delegation of Nicaragua thanks the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly for having \r\nconvened this important debate. I also wish to express \r\nour appreciation for the work of the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup coordinated by the former Ambassador of \r\nEcuador, Ms. María Fernanda Espinoza, and the \r\nAmbassador of Norway, Mr. Morten Wetland. The \r\nwork they undertook at the sixty-third session of \r\nAssembly drove forward the process of revitalization.  \r\n Nicaragua reiterates its strong commitment to the \r\nprocess of the revitalization and democratization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and underscores the importance of \r\nresolution 63/309. However, we still have a great deal \r\nof work ahead to ensure that this body, in all its \r\ndimensions, remains the most representative and \r\nlegitimate body of this Organization. My delegation \r\naligns itself with the statements made by the \r\nPermanent Representatives of Argentina, on behalf of \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement, and of Mexico on behalf \r\nof the Rio Group. \r\n The democratization of the United Nations is a \r\nmatter of priority. Measures must continue to be taken \r\nso that the General Assembly can regain its full \r\nauthority and exercise the functions incumbent on it as \r\nthe most democratic, deliberative and legitimate organ \r\nof the Organization. \r\n We should like to express our particular \r\nappreciation for the efforts made in this regard by the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-third \r\nsession. The first thing we wish to recognize is that \r\nMr. Miguel D’Escoto Brockmann gave such weight to \r\nthe fact that all countries have the same right to be \r\nheard and heeded that the term that he correctly \r\ncoined — the Group of 192, or G-192 — can now be \r\nheard in all quarters. \r\n The holding in June of the United Nations \r\nConference on the World Financial and Economic \r\nCrisis and Its Impact on Development, as well as the \r\nrichness of the debate, demonstrated that we are indeed \r\nA/64/PV.48  \r\n \r\n09-61350 24 \r\n \r\nprepared to discuss any issue that affects us. We have \r\nshattered the myth that some issues are solely the \r\npurview of a few, rather than of the entire G-192. The \r\nimportance of the General Assembly as the most \r\nappropriate forum for addressing any issue affecting \r\nthe international community has been well established. \r\n Similarly, we welcome the timely and decisive \r\nadoption of resolution 63/301, concerning the situation \r\nin Honduras, which illustrated the fact that the \r\nAssembly is attuned to issues of international \r\nrelevance. It also constituted an important example of \r\nthe role that the Assembly can and should play in the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.  \r\n An additional example in that regard was the \r\nspeedy action by the Assembly’s presidency during the \r\nsixty-third session in the face of the impasse in which \r\nthe Security Council found itself during the Israeli \r\ninvasion of Gaza. We would also like to commend the \r\nPresident’s swift response to the request of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement and the Palestinian people to \r\nhold a special debate during the sixty-fourth session to \r\ntake up the Goldstone report (A/HRC/12/48).  \r\n We believe that the revitalization of the work of \r\nthe General Assembly should be based on the \r\nprinciples of democracy, transparency and \r\naccountability and achieved through open and inclusive \r\nconsultations, a critical component of the \r\ncomprehensive reform of the Organization that is so \r\nbadly needed. The main necessary elements to be taken \r\ninto account in revitalizing the Assembly are clearly set \r\nout in the declaration recently issued by the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement. We trust that the Working \r\nGroup will consider them carefully during its \r\ndeliberations. We take this opportunity to welcome the \r\nappointment of the representatives of Slovenia and \r\nArgentina as co-Chairs of that important Group. \r\n We wish to stress the need for those principles to \r\nbe taken into consideration in addressing issues of vital \r\nimportance for the Organization, in particular the \r\nnomination and appointment of the Secretary-General, \r\nas is clearly detailed in the Movement’s declaration. \r\nThe General Assembly should exercise its \r\nresponsibility in the nomination and appointment of the \r\nSecretary-General, carry out consultations with all \r\nMember States and subsequently present its candidates. \r\nAn open debate should be held, with candidates \r\npresenting their points of view so that we, the G-192, \r\ncan make judgements on the correct selection and \r\nappointment. Following such an open and transparent \r\nprocess, the Assembly should make its \r\nrecommendations. \r\n If the Assembly’s role and authority are to be \r\nrestored and strengthened, its functions and \r\ncompetencies must be fully respected. We must also \r\nstrengthen its relations and coordination with the other \r\nprincipal organs, in particular the Security Council, \r\nwhere there is still much work to be done. It is \r\nnecessary to reiterate that the Security Council should \r\nnot encroach on matters that fall exclusively under the \r\npurview of the Assembly. We have noted with \r\nsatisfaction the efforts of the President to bring \r\ntogether the Security Council and the other principal \r\norgans of the Organization and to promote the \r\nexchange of information. \r\n With regard to strengthening the Office of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly, we reiterate the \r\nimportance of continuing to consider ways and means \r\nto make it possible to increase the human and financial \r\nresources currently at the disposal of the presidency. \r\nEvery country should have the right to preside over the \r\nAssembly, and economic considerations should be no \r\nimpediment to doing so. It is therefore important to \r\nincrease resources in that connection, so as to \r\ncontribute to the strengthening of the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Lastly, with regard to establishing a new voting \r\nsystem, we warn against any decisions being taken \r\nprior to wide-scale decisive consultations among the \r\nentire membership.  \r\n Nicaragua will continue to support every effort to \r\nstrengthen the central role and authority of the General \r\nAssembly as the main deliberative, standard-setting \r\nand representative organ of the United Nations. We \r\nhave confidence in the President, in whose hands we \r\nplace ourselves, for we know that, under his leadership \r\nand through his efforts, the role of the General \r\nAssembly will continue to be strengthened, thereby \r\nincreasing its relevance and credibility and amplifying \r\nthe voice of the G-192. \r\n Mr. Al Habib (Islamic Republic of Iran): This is \r\nthe second consecutive year that we are enjoying the \r\nopportunity to express our gratitude to the President of \r\nthe General Assembly for his particular attention to the \r\nlong-standing and important issue of the revitalization \r\nof the work of the General Assembly, as inscribed on \r\n A/64/PV.48\r\n \r\n25 09-61350 \r\n \r\nthe working agendas of the sixty-third and sixty-fourth \r\nsessions of the Assembly. \r\n I would like to associate my delegation with the \r\nstatement that has already been delivered by the \r\nPermanent Representative of Algeria to the United \r\nNations on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement on \r\nthat very agenda item. I wish, however, to delve into a \r\nfew observations. \r\n After 18 years of work, and much has been done \r\nto enhance the role, authority, effectiveness and \r\nefficiency of the General Assembly. However, we are \r\nstill far from accomplishing the main tasks, including, \r\ninter alia, enhancing the role and authority of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, streamlining the relationship \r\nbetween the Assembly and the other principal organs of \r\nthe United Nations, and promoting the role and \r\nresponsibility of the Assembly in the process of \r\nselecting and appointing the Secretary-General. Those \r\nare but a few of the expectations we have of this body \r\nas we engage in this profound endeavour this year. \r\n On the basis of a review of various United \r\nNations resolutions on the revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly, it is quite clear that a great number of them \r\nhave dealt with the role and authority of the General \r\nAssembly. That clearly demonstrates how important \r\nthe enhancement of the role and authority of this organ \r\nis to the general membership. We should not \r\nunderestimate the great importance of this issue, and \r\nshould therefore explore concrete ways and means of \r\nensuring full respect for the functions and powers of \r\nthe General Assembly, as stipulated in the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations. \r\n As for the relationship between the General \r\nAssembly and other principal organs of the United \r\nNations, the particular relationship between the \r\nAssembly and the Security Council has been a matter \r\nof extensive debate for many years, especially during \r\nvarious United Nations reform processes. A good \r\nnumber of General Assembly resolutions set certain \r\ncriteria to clarify the relationship between those two \r\nimportant principal organs of the United Nations. The \r\nCharter itself confers on both organs important \r\nfunctions and responsibilities.  \r\n Nonetheless, in recent years, we have witnessed a \r\ngradual but constant encroachment by the Security \r\nCouncil on the functions and the powers of the General \r\nAssembly, as well as of other organs, such as the \r\nEconomic and Social Council. There are numerous \r\ncases of the Security Council encroaching on the \r\npowers and prerogatives of the Assembly and of other \r\nbodies of the Organization. \r\n We are particularly concerned about the exercise \r\nof setting norms, making laws and establishing \r\ndefinitions by the Security Council in areas beyond its \r\ncompetency. Let me recall Article 13 of the Charter, \r\naccording to which the General Assembly, as the only \r\nuniversal and representative organ comprising all \r\nMember States of the United Nations, is primarily \r\ntasked with the progressive development of \r\ninternational law and its codification. \r\n With regard to the role and responsibility of the \r\nGeneral Assembly in the process of selecting and \r\nappointing the Secretary-General, I should emphasis \r\nthat, if we seek to make Article 97 of the Charter a \r\nreality, we cannot and should not relegate the \r\nAssembly merely to the role of a rubber stamp. In our \r\nview, there is a strong tendency among the vast \r\nmajority of Members of the Organization to articulate \r\nand improve the procedure for selecting the Secretary-\r\nGeneral by giving the General Assembly a more \r\nmeaningful and determining role to assume. \r\n Resolution 51/241 prescribed a set of provisions \r\nthat, if implemented, will strengthen the role of the \r\nGeneral Assembly in the selection of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. In fact, this is a matter of great importance for \r\nthe entire international community, which regards the \r\nSecretary-General as its highest representative, whose \r\nlegitimacy and credibility should be based on the wider \r\nsupport of its members, not that of just a few. \r\n As part of the comprehensive reform of the \r\nUnited Nations, the revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly is a dynamic and continuous process. We \r\nshould remain committed and constructive throughout \r\nthis ongoing exercise, with a view to strengthening the \r\nrole and authority of the Assembly as the chief \r\ndeliberative, policymaking and representative organ of \r\nthe United Nations. My delegation will be prepared to \r\nactively participate in a discussion that is transparent, \r\nopen and inclusive. \r\n Mr. Hardeep Singh Puri (India): I am happy to \r\nparticipate in today’s debate on the revitalization of the \r\nwork of the General Assembly. My delegation \r\nassociates itself broadly with the position of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement, as expressed by the \r\ndelegation of Algeria. \r\nA/64/PV.48  \r\n \r\n09-61350 26 \r\n \r\n We are guided by the desire to have a more \r\neffective United Nations. India wants the United \r\nNations to be an Organization that is truly responsive \r\nto the priorities and aspirations of Member States, in \r\nparticular of developing countries, which constitute the \r\nvast majority of the membership. Its working methods \r\nmust also embody efficiency and transparency. \r\n The role of the General Assembly as the chief \r\ndeliberative, legislative, policymaking and \r\nrepresentative body of the international community \r\nmust be strengthened and respected both in letter and \r\nin spirit. Indeed, the strengthening of procedures, \r\nworking methods and documentation and ensuring due \r\nfollow-up are important steps in that direction. \r\nEnhanced General Assembly visibility and outreach are \r\nequally important. However, more important is the \r\nneed to continue to focus on substantive measures to \r\nrestore and enhance the role and authority of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, including in exercising control over \r\nlegislation, material and manpower, and its role as the \r\nchief oversight organ of the United Nations. \r\n As the voice of the international community, the \r\nGeneral Assembly must have a greater say in the \r\nprocess of selecting the Secretary-General. The \r\nmandate for the appointment of the Secretary-General \r\nflows from Article 97 of the Charter of the United \r\nNations, which envisages a role for both the General \r\nAssembly and the Security Council. The modalities of \r\nthe appointment process have, however, come to be \r\ngoverned by subparagraph (d) of paragraph 4 of \r\nAssembly resolution 11 (I), of 24 January 1946. It \r\nwould appear strange today that, while we all promote \r\nthe principles of transparency and an inclusive \r\nselection process, the General Assembly willingly \r\nagreed to impose such restrictions on its own Charter \r\nmandate. However, it is important to recall that the \r\nreason for resolution 11 (I) was the context of the post-\r\n1945 world. \r\n More than 60 years since the adoption of \r\nresolution 11 (I), we live in a different world. While \r\nthe Security Council itself must change to reflect \r\ncontemporary realities and expand its membership in \r\nboth the permanent and the non-permanent categories, \r\nthe General Assembly cannot remain bound by self-\r\nimposed restrictions that reflect an era gone by. The \r\nGeneral Assembly’s role cannot be merely to rubber-\r\nstamp the recommendation of the Security Council. \r\nThe need for changes in the process of appointing the \r\nSecretary-General has been recognized by all Member \r\nStates. Resolutions 51/241, of 31 July 1997, and \r\n60/286, of 8 September 2006, outline in detail \r\nproposals for improving this process. \r\n Those proposals include making full use of the \r\nCharter provisions on the General Assembly’s power of \r\nappointment, due regard for regional rotation and \r\ngender equality, the possibility of the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly consulting with Member States to \r\nidentify potential candidates endorsed by a Member \r\nState, encouraging the formal presentation of \r\ncandidatures for the position of Secretary-General in a \r\nmanner that allows sufficient time for interaction with \r\nMember States and requesting candidates to present \r\ntheir views to all States members of the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Clearly, what is required is the necessary political \r\nwill to comprehensively consider and implement those \r\nchanges. A more inclusive and interactive selection \r\nprocess would also enhance the authority and \r\neffectiveness of the Secretary-General, as well as \r\nincrease the confidence of all Member States in the \r\nSecretary-General. \r\n The revitalization process also implies that the \r\nGeneral Assembly should take the lead in setting the \r\nglobal agenda and restoring the centrality of the United \r\nNations. The convening power of the United Nations \r\nmust be used more decisively in that regard. \r\n There has been an increasing tendency to \r\nundermine the prerogatives and authority of the \r\nGeneral Assembly through the Security Council’s \r\nencroachment on its agenda. It is important that the \r\nbalance among the principal organs of the United \r\nNations envisaged in the Charter be maintained and \r\nrespected. Of special concern is the encroachment by \r\nthe Security Council on issues that traditionally fall \r\nwithin the General Assembly’s competence, such as the \r\nprocess of standard-setting and the codification of \r\ninternational law. Of concern also is the holding of \r\nthematic debates in the Security Council on issues that \r\nfrequently fall within the purview of the General \r\nAssembly or the Economic and Social Council. \r\n Resolution 60/286 reiterated that, in addition to \r\nthe Security Council making its annual report more \r\nanalytical, it should submit special reports to the \r\nGeneral Assembly. It is important to fulfil that \r\nprovision to the satisfaction of Member States while \r\nthe Security Council considers ways to further improve \r\nthe quality of its reports to the General Assembly.  \r\n A/64/PV.48\r\n \r\n27 09-61350 \r\n \r\n It is also important that a truly representative \r\nbody such as the General Assembly have a much \r\ngreater say in international economic and financial \r\nmatters. The United Nations Conference on the World \r\nFinancial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on \r\nDevelopment successfully demonstrated the convening \r\npower that the General Assembly can exercise on such \r\nglobal issues. Our expectation is that Member States \r\nwill continue their constructive engagement in the Ad \r\nHoc Open-ended Working Group of the General \r\nAssembly that was set up pursuant to the outcome of \r\nthe Conference. \r\n Before I conclude, I would like to felicitate the \r\nPermanent Representatives of Norway and Ecuador for \r\ntheir significant efforts in this direction as Co-Chairs  \r\n \r\nof the Ad Hoc Working Group. My delegation also \r\nlooks forward to working with the Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of Slovenia and Argentina, the newly \r\nappointed Co-Chairs for the current session. We assure \r\nthem of our full cooperation and support. I would also \r\nlike to re-emphasize the need to undertake \r\ncomprehensive discussions on substantive issues that \r\nare critical for the revitalization of the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n The Acting President: We shall hear the \r\nremaining speakers in the debate on this item \r\ntomorrow, 20 November, immediately following the \r\njoint debate on agenda items 10 and 108. \r\n  The meeting rose at 1 p.m. \r\n"
