(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) \r\n \r\n \r\n The meeting was called to order at 10.20 a.m. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 52 \r\n \r\nFollow-up to and implementation of the outcome of \r\nthe 2002 International Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment and the 2008 Review Conference \r\n \r\n  Report of the Second Committee (A/64/419) \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): If there is no \r\nproposal under rule 66 of the rules of procedure, may I \r\ntake it that the General Assembly decides not to discuss \r\nthe report of the Second Committee that is before the \r\nAssembly today? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The Assembly \r\nwill now take action on the draft decision \r\nrecommended by the Second Committee in paragraph 9 \r\nof its report. The Second Committee adopted the draft \r\ndecision. May I take it that the Assembly wishes to do \r\nthe same?  \r\n The draft decision was adopted. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I now give the \r\nfloor to the representative of Sweden, who wishes to \r\nspeak in explanation of position on the decision just \r\nadopted. \r\n Mr. Lidén (Sweden): The European Union was \r\nable to go along with the decision just adopted, but not \r\nwithout some regrets. We think it is highly unfortunate \r\nthat we are put in a situation where we have to \r\npostpone a high-level event at such short notice, and \r\nwe think that this is not good for the credibility of the \r\nUnited Nations. We understand that we have been \r\npromised a written explanation from the Secretariat on \r\nwhat went wrong in preparing for the event. That will \r\ncertainly help our capitals to better understand why the \r\nhigh-level dialogue had to be postponed. \r\n We would also like to underline the importance of \r\nnot ending up in the same situation once more. The \r\nEuropean Union is ready to engage in consultations on \r\nnew dates for the dialogue, but we have to prepare this \r\ndecision on new dates carefully so as to ensure the high \r\nquality of the meeting and its preparations. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The Assembly \r\nhas thus concluded this stage of its consideration of \r\nagenda item 52. \r\n \r\nAgenda items 10 and 108 \r\n \r\nReport of the Peacebuilding Commission (A/64/341)  \r\n \r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund (A/64/217)  \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/63/881)  \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): Members will \r\nrecall that the General Assembly, by its decision \r\n63/517 of 14 September 2009, deferred to the sixty-\r\nfourth session its consideration of the report of the \r\nSecretary-General on peacebuilding in the immediate \r\naftermath of conflict (A/63/881) under the agenda \r\nitems entitled “Report of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission” and “Report of the Secretary-General on \r\nthe Peacebuilding Fund”.  \r\nA/64/PV.49  \r\n \r\n09-61513 2 \r\n \r\n In recent years, peacebuilding has come to be \r\nrecognized as an essential and integral component of a \r\ncomprehensive approach to peace and development. \r\nThe challenge of assisting countries emerging from \r\nconflict to move towards sustainable peace and the \r\nimperative of preventing a relapse into conflict was \r\nduly acknowledged by the 2005 World Summit. The \r\nestablishment of the Peacebuilding Commission and \r\nthe Peacebuilding Fund as the new United Nations \r\ninstitutional architecture was a logical outcome, \r\nresponding to the need for a more coherent system-\r\nwide approach and strengthened capacity for successful \r\npeacebuilding. \r\n This joint debate, now in its fourth year, provides \r\na useful opportunity to the general membership to \r\nassess the performance of the new peacebuilding \r\narchitecture and to suggest ways and means of \r\nimproving it further. We need to reflect deeply on how \r\nand to what extent the vision and objectives of \r\npeacebuilding have been put into practice. We should \r\nalways keep in mind that for the millions of people \r\nstruggling to win back their future from a past \r\nshattered by conflict and devastation, what matters \r\nmost is the tangible benefits on the ground and the \r\nimprovement in their daily lives brought about by \r\npeacebuilding. These people are the best judges of their \r\npriorities and interests. Their voices should be heard \r\nfirst and foremost. That is why the principle of national \r\nownership is the cornerstone of an effective \r\npeacebuilding partnership.  \r\n Such a partnership must also address the complex \r\nunderlying issues — the interlinked military, political, \r\ndevelopment, humanitarian and other dimensions of \r\nconflict situations. Sustained integrated strategies \r\nbacked by adequate resources are required to respond \r\nto these challenges. Such strategies also entail a more \r\neffective and operational interface between \r\npeacekeeping and peacebuilding activities. It is a \r\nserious undertaking, and its success depends on the \r\ncommitment and collective political will of Member \r\nStates.  \r\n It is this commitment and support that the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission must continue to enjoy, \r\ngiven its important mandate, which it has carried out \r\nquite admirably since 2006. The upcoming review of \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission, mandated by the \r\nfounding resolutions — Assembly resolution 60/180 \r\nand Security Council 1645 (2005) — will, I hope, \r\nprovide an opportunity not only to renew our \r\ncommitment to the cause of peacebuilding but also to \r\nensure that the peacebuilding architecture is adequately \r\nequipped and adapted to perform its core mandates.  \r\n I have been in consultation with the President of \r\nthe Security Council regarding the process for this \r\nreview. We have agreed that the review needs to be \r\nconducted in an open and inclusive manner. To that \r\nend, I intend to appoint two facilitators. \r\n I hope this review will prioritize the effective \r\ndelivery of political and economic support to countries \r\nemerging from conflict and that Member States will \r\ncombine their energies to reach an outcome that meets \r\nthe high expectations of people around the world for \r\nmore responsive, effective and efficient peacebuilding \r\nby the United Nations. \r\n I now give the floor to the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Chile to the United Nations, who is \r\nalso the Chairman of the Peacebuilding Commission. \r\n Mr. Muñoz (Chile): On behalf of the members of \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission (PBC), I am pleased to \r\npresent the report of the Commission on its third \r\nsession (A/64/341).  \r\n The annual debates on peacebuilding in the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council not only \r\nprovide a platform for reviewing and guiding the work \r\nof the Commission by its parent organs. Most \r\nimportant, they provide for broader engagement of the \r\nUnited Nations membership in addressing the critical \r\nchallenge of post-conflict peacebuilding.  \r\n This year, the General Assembly and the Security \r\nCouncil were also presented with an additional report \r\nby the Secretary-General on peacebuilding in the \r\nimmediate aftermath of a conflict (A/63/881). The \r\nreport, which received significant input from the PBC, \r\nhighlighted the increasing emphasis that the United \r\nNations is placing on securing a coherent and \r\nintegrated global response to the challenges in post-\r\nconflict situations.  \r\n As the Secretary-General mentioned in that \r\nreport, while it is not the only actor in post-conflict \r\nsituations, the United Nations is increasingly expected \r\nto play a leadership role in the field, facilitating \r\nengagement between national and international actors \r\nand among international actors. The PBC is the central \r\nintergovernmental body of the United Nations that is \r\nmandated to ensure that the Organization indeed leads \r\n A/64/PV.49\r\n \r\n3 09-61513 \r\n \r\nthe way towards alleviating the suffering of \r\npopulations in post-conflict situations.  \r\n Along with the Peacebuilding Fund (PBF) and the \r\nPeacebuilding Support Office (PBSO), the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission continues to promote the \r\nnexus between security and development and a \r\nstrategic vision for sustaining and consolidating peace, \r\navoiding a relapse into violence, strengthening the rule \r\nof law and ensuring respect and promotion of human \r\nrights.  \r\n With its unique membership and its flexible \r\napproach to engaging assisting and potential actors and \r\npartners, the Commission continues to be a viable \r\ninstrument to improve the United Nations response to \r\nthe needs and priorities of post-conflict countries.  \r\n The report of the PBC on its third session \r\nrepresents a collective effort by the members of the \r\nOrganizational Committee to highlight the most \r\nimportant facts and analysis pertinent to the activities \r\nundertaken by its various configurations. It also \r\nprovides observations on the possible way forward.  \r\n The report reflects the ongoing progress made by \r\nthe PBC in engaging the countries on its agenda. \r\nMoreover, the Commission addressed a number of \r\ncritical policy questions and lessons learned of \r\nparticular relevance to its overarching mandate as an \r\ninstitutional mechanism dedicated to addressing the \r\nspecial needs of post–conflict countries. \r\n As indicated in the conclusions of the report on \r\nits third session, the Commission has consolidated its \r\ncore advisory role and demonstrated increasing support \r\nfor the countries on its agenda. In doing so, the \r\nCommission has continued to broaden and deepen its \r\npartnership with critical actors. This is an essential step \r\nforward as the Commission strives to ensure the \r\noperational relevance of its advice and promote the \r\ncoherence of peacebuilding strategies. \r\n First and foremost, the PBC continued to \r\nstrengthen its linkage with the General Assembly, the \r\nSecurity Council and the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil. Indeed, the reporting period witnessed an \r\nimportant breakthrough in efforts to deepen the \r\nrelationship with the Economic and Social Council \r\nthrough the participation of the PBC Chairperson in the \r\nCouncil’s 2009 substantive session and an exchange of \r\nviews with Council members on the important nexus \r\nbetween security, recovery from conflict and \r\ndevelopment. In addition, the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil and the PBC jointly organized a special event, \r\nin collaboration with the World Food Programme, on \r\nthe food and economic crisis in post-conflict countries. \r\nThe event was testimony to the Commission’s \r\ncontinued concern with the challenge of providing for \r\nthe basic needs and economic needs of populations \r\nemerging from conflict. \r\n The Chair of the Commission also met with the \r\nPresidents of the General Assembly at its sixty-third \r\nand sixty-fourth sessions in order to apprise the \r\nAssembly of the most important developments in the \r\nactivities of the Commission. The engagement of the \r\nwider membership through the Assembly is crucial to \r\nensure broader ownership and contribution of Member \r\nStates with respect to the evolving United Nations \r\npeacebuilding agenda.  \r\n The PBC also continued to expand partnerships \r\nwith numerous national, regional and international \r\nactors, including United Nations agencies, funds and \r\nprogrammes, international financial institutions, \r\nregional organizations, the private sector and civil \r\nsociety. \r\n In mentioning essential partnerships for \r\npeacebuilding, I wish to highlight the recently \r\nconcluded visit to African Union headquarters in Addis \r\nAbaba, in which I was accompanied by my colleagues \r\nthe Vice-Chair, the Chairs of the country-specific \r\nconfigurations and the Chair of the Working Group on \r\nLessons Learned, and supported by the PBSO and the \r\nUnited Nations Liaison Office to the African Union. \r\n I paid similar outreach visits to the Organization \r\nof American States, the international financial \r\ninstitutions headquartered in Washington, D.C., and the \r\nEuropean Commission’s headquarters in Brussels. \r\nThese visits contributed to deepening and \r\nstrengthening dialogue with those key regional and \r\ninternational partners, whose contributions and support \r\nto peacebuilding in countries on the Commission’s \r\nagenda, and globally, are crucial. \r\n With regard to the activities of the various \r\nconfigurations of the PBC, it is important to underscore \r\nthat the Organizational Committee, representing the \r\ncore group of PBC members, continued to address \r\npossible approaches to enhancing its capacity to \r\nimplement its core mandates and adapt to prevailing \r\nglobal realities and evolving approaches to critical \r\npeacebuilding priorities. To this end, the Committee \r\nA/64/PV.49  \r\n \r\n09-61513 4 \r\n \r\nconvened a number of meetings and discussions, which \r\nare enumerated in the report. \r\n I wish to underscore the important discussions \r\nthat the Committee convened on the following \r\nsubjects: enhancing the capacity of the PBC to fulfil its \r\nresource mobilization mandate; employment and \r\nincome generation, as well as private sector \r\ndevelopment in post-conflict countries; the \r\nimplications of the financial crisis on countries \r\nemerging from conflict; the United Nations rule of law \r\ncoordination strategy in countries emerging from \r\nconflict; and, most recently, the prospects for the \r\nmandated 2010 review of the United Nations \r\npeacebuilding architecture and for improving \r\nengagement with countries seeking the Commission’s \r\nadvice. \r\n In addition, the Chair of the Commission \r\nundertook a number of activities to raise global \r\nawareness of the challenges facing countries emerging \r\nfrom conflict. To this end, our participation in \r\nnumerous seminars, workshops, public media \r\ninterviews and special events served as an important \r\nplatform for advocacy on behalf of the countries on the \r\nPBC agenda and on general peacebuilding challenges. \r\n Recently, these activities resulted, among other \r\nthings, in a unique contribution to the PBF from \r\nproceeds of a commemorative digital version of John \r\nLennon and Yoko Ono’s classic song “Give Peace a \r\nChance”. I invite members to download it from iTunes, \r\nbecause this will support peacebuilding activities. \r\n The linkage of United Nations peacebuilding \r\nactivities to the world of celebrities is deemed to be \r\nimportant in raising awareness and encouraging \r\ncontributions to noble United Nations causes at the \r\nlevel of the general public. To that end, the PBC is also \r\nworking on appointing an ambassador for \r\npeacebuilding from among a number of possible sports \r\nand arts celebrities. In addition, the country-specific \r\nconfigurations continued to lead the design and \r\nmonitoring of the progress in the implementation of the \r\nstrategic frameworks for peacebuilding in the four \r\ncountries on the PBC agenda.  \r\n On Burundi, the Central African Republic, \r\nGuinea-Bissau and Sierra Leone, the Chairs of the four \r\nconfigurations regularly visit the four countries and \r\ninteract with high-level national officials, civil society, \r\npartners and senior United Nations officials at the \r\ncountry level. In the four countries, the PBC \r\nmembership collectively continues to promote \r\ninclusiveness and national ownership of the \r\npeacebuilding processes. While facing a number of \r\ncountry-specific challenges in the areas of resources, \r\ncapacity, political commitment and coherence, the \r\nCommission provided a viable political platform to \r\naddress these challenges and seek the partnerships that \r\nare needed to help drive the coherence of activities and \r\ndeliver tangible dividends on the ground. \r\n Finally, the Working Group on Lessons Learned \r\ncontinued to provide an informal platform for the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission to draw on the expertise of \r\npractitioners from within and outside the United \r\nNations system, as well from countries with certain \r\nexperience in post-conflict peacebuilding. The Working \r\nGroup also continued to seek useful ties with the work \r\nof the Commission’s configurations, the United \r\nNations system and the larger peacebuilding \r\ncommunity. To this end, the discussions on rule of law \r\nassistance, sustainable reintegration, regional \r\napproaches to disarmament, demobilization and \r\nreintegration, and the role of national dialogue in \r\npeacebuilding address critical priorities for one or \r\nmore countries on the PBC agenda. \r\n Throughout its various configurations, the PBC \r\nreceived substantive support from the PBSO. The \r\nOffice continues to provide the PBC with essential \r\nlinkage with the operational entities within and outside \r\nthe United Nations system. The PBSO continued to \r\ngive regular quarterly briefings to the Organizational \r\nCommittee on the activities and operations of the PBF. \r\nThese briefings continued to deepen the strategic \r\nlinkage between the Commission and the PBF and \r\nprovided the Commission with regular opportunities to \r\nprovide overall policy guidance on the use of the Fund \r\nin support of the strategic objectives of peacebuilding \r\nin the countries under PBC consideration. The synergy \r\nbetween the PBC and the PBF is something to \r\nstrengthen even more. \r\n As the United Nations peacebuilding agenda and \r\nits ties with other peacebuilding actors expand, the \r\nOffice’s scope and areas of support will continue to \r\nexpand as well. The Office’s human and substantive \r\nresources will thus need to be further enhanced. \r\n The recent appointment by the Secretary-General \r\nof Judy Cheng-Hopkins as Assistant Secretary-General \r\nand head of the PBSO brings capable leadership with \r\nsignificant field experience to manage the support \r\n A/64/PV.49\r\n \r\n5 09-61513 \r\n \r\nprovided to the PBC on the one hand, and the \r\noperations of the PBF on the other. \r\n Three years since the operationalization of the \r\nmilestone decision of the 2005 World Summit to \r\nestablish the PBC, the PBF and the PBSO, the United \r\nNations peacebuilding agenda is expanding in scope \r\nand depth. Peacebuilding is an area that may contribute \r\nto further defining the image of the Organization in the \r\ncoming years. Peacebuilding is unique in that it serves \r\nas the nexus among security, rule of law and \r\ndevelopment while it supports the laying of the \r\nfoundation for sustainable peace and development. \r\nThat is, undoubtedly, its primary strength. \r\n At the same time, with multiple actors involved \r\nin a range of humanitarian, security and development \r\nactivities, the challenge of ensuring a coherent and \r\nintegrated response is daunting. Likewise, the \r\nprinciples of national ownership and inclusiveness \r\nhave been pivotal in the work of the Commission \r\nduring these past years.  \r\n While we can certainly identify initial progress in \r\nlinking up the advisory role of the Commission with \r\nthe United Nations and non-United Nations operational \r\nentities, the Commission remains, in my view, \r\nunderutilized. The Commission combines a unique link \r\nto the three principle organs of the United Nations, a \r\nunique composition of membership and a unique \r\ndegree of flexibility to engage non-United Nations and \r\nnon-governmental actors. Thus, the Commission could, \r\nin particular, promote a seamless transition from \r\nhumanitarian to early recovery assistance, synergy \r\nbetween peacekeeping and peacebuilding mandates and \r\nnational capacity development in critical peacebuilding \r\npriorities.  \r\n As indicated by the Secretary-General in his \r\nreport on peacebuilding in the immediate aftermath of \r\nconflict (A/63/881), the Commission has a critical role \r\nto play in championing and promoting the agenda \r\noutlined in the report. The Commission is certainly \r\npositioned to help realize a number of important \r\nactions recommended by the Secretary-General in that \r\nreport. \r\n In addition, the envisioned 2010 review of the \r\nCommission’s founding resolutions will provide a \r\nprime opportunity to further build on the experiences \r\ngained, define its potential role in support of an \r\nexpanded United Nations peacebuilding agenda and \r\nenhance its support to countries emerging from \r\nconflict. \r\n In taking the lead in the 2010 review, the General \r\nAssembly and the Security Council will be charting an \r\nimportant course for the future relevance of the United \r\nNations in tackling post-conflict situations. That will \r\nbe a challenging task for our collective capacity to \r\ndeliver on the promises and ideals of the United \r\nNations Charter and to respond to the needs of the \r\nmost vulnerable people of the world. \r\n Mr. Lidén (Sweden): I have the honour to speak \r\ntoday on behalf of the European Union (EU). \r\n Turkey, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, \r\nMontenegro, Serbia, Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova \r\nand Armenia align themselves with this statement. \r\n Supporting countries emerging from conflict is a \r\nmoral obligation and responsibility of the international \r\ncommunity. We must not fail to meet that challenge. \r\nThe United Nations, with its global legitimacy and \r\nbroad range of tools, has a central role and a clear \r\nadded value in supporting countries emerging from \r\nviolent conflict to build sustainable peace. \r\n That is why the European Union has actively \r\nengaged in the Peacebuilding Commission (PBC) since \r\nits establishment in 2005. We remain firmly committed \r\nto working with all stakeholders in making the \r\npeacebuilding architecture a success. The 2010 review \r\nis a timely opportunity to reinvigorate the vision \r\nbehind the Commission and generate a common \r\nunderstanding on the way forward. \r\n The Commission is mandated to bring together \r\nall relevant actors, marshal resources and to provide \r\nadvice based on integrated strategies. This makes the \r\nCommission a forum for policy coordination at the \r\nstrategic level among key international actors. The \r\nCommission can further play a central role in \r\naddressing critical gaps in peacebuilding efforts and \r\ncontribute to increased coherence between security, \r\ndevelopment and humanitarian actors. \r\n The Commission is also becoming an important \r\nframework for mutual accountability, under which host \r\nGovernments and the international community can be \r\nheld to account mutually against agreed commitments. \r\nThe membership of the Commission provides \r\ninternational legitimacy to deliver effectively on those \r\nroles. \r\nA/64/PV.49  \r\n \r\n09-61513 6 \r\n \r\n In order for the Commission to deliver on its \r\npotential, a higher level of commitment and ownership \r\nof the PBC agenda by its members is central. As \r\nmembers of the Commission, we must ensure that our \r\ncommitments translate into policies and actions in the \r\ncountries on the PBC agenda as well as in relevant \r\nmultilateral organizations. \r\n The European Union would welcome a more \r\nstructured relationship, including increased interaction, \r\nbetween the Commission and the Security Council. \r\nThat would facilitate the advisory role of the \r\nCommission and promote the early inclusion of \r\npeacebuilding perspectives in Security Council \r\nconsiderations and decisions. A central challenge is to \r\nmaking better use of synergies between peacebuilding \r\nand peacekeeping. \r\n Effective support to post-conflict countries builds \r\non national ownership. Therefore, the EU encourages \r\nthe Commission to be flexible in its engagement, \r\nfocusing on a limited set of priorities while building on \r\nexisting capacities and strategies at the country level. \r\n The success of the international community’s \r\nsupport for peacebuilding is determined by our ability \r\nto support national efforts on the ground. In that \r\nregard, we call for urgent implementation of the \r\nrecommendations in the Secretary-General’s report on \r\npeacebuilding in the immediate aftermath of conflict \r\n(A/63/881). \r\n Enhanced United Nations leadership in country is \r\nneeded to gather international support behind early and \r\nprioritized strategies. Furthermore, strengthened \r\noperational capacity in core peacebuilding sectors is \r\nrequired, including by improved and timely \r\ndeployment of civilian capacities. \r\n Financing for peacebuilding and early recovery \r\nefforts needs to be predictable, timely, flexible and \r\nwell-coordinated. That requires political courage as \r\ninvesting in post-conflict contexts involves risks. \r\nDonor practices and mechanisms need to be improved \r\nto better manage such risks. \r\n The Peacebuilding Fund, with the potential to \r\ndisburse quick and flexible funding, should play a key \r\nrole in complementing existing funding mechanisms. \r\nAs committed contributors to the Peacebuilding Fund, \r\nwe look forward to the Fund reaching its full potential. \r\n Let me take this opportunity to warmly welcome \r\nAssistant Secretary-General Ms. Judy Cheng-Hopkins \r\nas head of the Peacebuilding Support Office. A strong \r\nSupport Office will play a key role in bringing the \r\nUnited Nations system together on peacebuilding \r\nissues and in providing solid input to PBC \r\ndeliberations. \r\n We look to the Secretary-General for strong \r\nleadership in advancing the peacebuilding agenda in \r\nthe United Nations and beyond. The European Union \r\nwill continue to actively support efforts to better assist \r\ncountries in building sustainable peace. \r\n Mr. Wolfe (Jamaica): It is my honour as \r\ncoordinator of the caucus of countries of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement (NAM) that are members of \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission (PBC) to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly on behalf of NAM on the occasion \r\nof the Commission’s third annual report as contained in \r\ndocument A/64/341. \r\n The third annual report of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission reviews activities of the Commission for \r\nthe period 23 June 2008 to 30 June 2009 and, like the \r\ntwo previous annual reports on the work of the \r\nCommission, reflects the multiple arduous tasks \r\nundertaken by the Commission to confront and address \r\nthe many challenges faced over the period. \r\n The report is indeed a very comprehensive \r\ndocument and presents an accurate assessment and a \r\ngenuine record of the Commission’s work over the \r\nperiod in question. The report makes it clear that \r\nefforts aimed at consolidating peace and laying the \r\nfoundations for rehabilitation, sustained economic \r\nrecovery and development must be done in a holistic \r\nmanner. During the review period, the Commission \r\nwas able to build on the notable progress achieved \r\nduring its two previous sessions. It remained focused \r\non fulfilling its mandate in key areas; in others, \r\nhowever, serious consideration will have to be given to \r\nimplementing new strategies and approaches aimed at \r\nenhancing the Commission’s capacity to keep abreast \r\nof prevailing global realities crucial to peacebuilding \r\npriorities in post-conflict societies, particularly those \r\non its immediate agenda. \r\n While the tasks remain arduous and quite \r\nchallenging, the Commission, with the assistance of the \r\nPeacebuilding Support Office, has indeed produced \r\npromising and positive achievements in its operations, \r\nas confirmed in the overall assessments by Member \r\nStates. We are also encouraged by the concrete steps \r\ntaken to consolidate post-conflict recovery and towards \r\n A/64/PV.49\r\n \r\n7 09-61513 \r\n \r\nstrengthening the foundations for socio-economic \r\ndevelopment in the countries under consideration. \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) remains \r\nconvinced that the Organizational Committee must \r\nplay the central role in steering and providing guidance \r\nfor the overall work of the Commission, and in this \r\nregard we welcome the increased frequency of the \r\nCommittee’s meetings over the period. Those meetings \r\nyielded tremendous added value, including building \r\nand strengthening partnerships, which are so crucial for \r\nthe Commission’s work, as well as creating a very \r\nuseful platform for the ongoing appraisal and review of \r\nstrategies addressing approaches to confronting and \r\nimplementing its mandates, and for the development of \r\nthe Commission’s work programme. We also welcome \r\nthe convening of several discussions that resulted in \r\nimportant recommendations aimed at improving the \r\neffectiveness of the Commission and the activities \r\nundertaken by the Chair on its behalf. \r\n The increased interaction and collaboration \r\nbetween the Chair of the Commission and the \r\nPresidents of the General Assembly, the Security \r\nCouncil and the Economic and Social Council is \r\nindeed a very welcome step in the right direction. \r\nHowever, the NAM takes this opportunity to reiterate \r\nits previous request that this interaction be expanded to \r\ninclude the wider membership of the Commission, \r\nincluding the country-specific configurations. We have \r\nreason to believe that our call has not fallen on deaf \r\nears, as we have already seen progress in that direction. \r\nOur desire, therefore, is to emphasize the need for the \r\ntrend to continue, throughout and beyond the fourth \r\nsession, and become a feature of the Commission’s \r\nworking methods. \r\n At the same time, the NAM endorses and fully \r\nsupports the various activities undertaken by the Chair \r\non behalf of the Commission in an effort to strengthen \r\nthe relationship between the relevant actors. This is \r\nline with the Commission’s mandate to improve \r\ncoordination of all relevant actors on the ground in \r\npeacebuilding efforts within and outside the United \r\nNations system, regional and subregional organizations \r\nand international financial institutions. \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement is of the opinion \r\nthat, during the period under review, while ongoing \r\nefforts to increase public awareness and visibility of \r\nthe Commission were satisfactory, the target audience \r\nseemed to be more academics and less the average \r\nperson. The NAM is of the view that peacebuilding and \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission are everybody’s \r\nbusiness, and in that light, every possible effort should \r\nbe made to take its mandate and activities to the wider \r\npublic domain, including the mainstream media, \r\nglobally. \r\n We nevertheless commend the efforts of the \r\nChairman, who, with the assistance of a range of \r\nexisting and potential actors, stakeholders and partners, \r\ntook the message of the Commission, as part of the \r\noutreach and advocacy strategy, to raise awareness \r\nabout it during the review period. Additionally, the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement sees the decision to appoint \r\ngoodwill ambassadors as a positive, innovative step \r\nthat could well result in heightened awareness and \r\nappreciation of the important work and activities of the \r\nCommission. \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement takes this \r\nopportunity to call for the development of the \r\nCommission’s own rules of procedure and working \r\nmethods. We are confident that clearly defined rules in \r\nthese areas will contribute to the efficacy, consistency \r\nand transparency of the work of the Commission. \r\nEvery effort should therefore be made to address this \r\nanomaly in the fourth session. At the same time, the \r\nfindings of the Commission’s Working Group on \r\nLessons Learned, ably chaired by the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of El Salvador, must at this juncture be \r\nincorporated into the overall strategy and policy of the \r\nCommission’s work. It is not enough only to discuss \r\nlessons learned; the findings must also positively \r\nimpact the work of the Commission. \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement continues to lament \r\nthe seeming scant regard for, or lack of sufficient \r\nattention to, the development dimension of \r\npeacebuilding efforts in the country-specific \r\nconfigurations of the Commission. Greater emphasis \r\nneeds to be placed on areas such as education and \r\ntraining, rural agricultural and infrastructural \r\ndevelopment, private sector reform and \r\ndevelopment — with an emphasis on job creation and \r\nfunding to facilitate enhanced investment activities — \r\nif countries are not to relapse into conflict. \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement looks forward to the \r\n2010 review of the work of the Commission. This will \r\nbe an opportunity not only to take stock of the \r\nCommission’s work but, equally important, to make \r\nefforts to improve the pursuit and accomplishment of \r\nA/64/PV.49  \r\n \r\n09-61513 8 \r\n \r\nits core mandate. The NAM intends to participate \r\nactively in the consultation and review processes. \r\nThose processes should continue to be based on the \r\nprinciple of national ownership of the peacebuilding \r\nprocess by the countries on the Commission’s agenda, \r\nand should also include countries potentially on that \r\nagenda, as well as other stakeholders. Preparations for \r\nthe 2010 review process should begin as early as \r\npossible, so as to facilitate input from all concerned \r\nparties. \r\n Among the undoubted highlights of the period \r\nunder review was the General Assembly’s adoption in \r\nJune of resolution 63/282, approving the revision of the \r\nterms of reference of the Peacebuilding Fund (PBF), \r\nthe aim of which is to serve as a flexible, responsive \r\nand focused resource for peacebuilding support. The \r\nNon-Aligned Movement looks forward to the \r\nimmediate application of the revised terms of reference \r\nof the Fund, hoping that they will address the \r\nmanagement, operational and procedural challenges \r\nencountered during the initial phase of the Fund’s \r\noperation. This will help to provide a solid foundation \r\nto ensure that post-conflict countries benefit from \r\nfunds approved for disbursement by the Fund in a \r\ntimely manner. The quarterly briefings provided by the \r\nSupport Office on the operation, utilization and project \r\nearmarks of the Fund have undoubtedly been a helpful \r\naddition to the Commission’s activities during the \r\nperiod, keeping the Commission informed of activities \r\nrelating to the Fund. The NAM looks forward to the \r\ncontinuation of such useful briefings. \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement takes this \r\nopportunity to express its appreciation to Mr. Heraldo \r\nMuñoz, the Permanent Representative of Chile, for his \r\nvery active tenure as Chair of the Commission during \r\nits third session. Under his chairmanship the \r\nCommission consolidated its position and enhanced its \r\nprofile within the international community and \r\ndeveloped new avenues for future growth. We also \r\nthank him for his report this morning. Permit me also \r\non behalf of the Movement to express appreciation to \r\nthe various Chairs of the country-specific \r\nconfigurations, and the Chair of the Working Group on \r\nLessons Learned, for their commitment and leadership, \r\nand to the dedicated and hardworking staff of the \r\nPeacebuilding Support Office. \r\n Ms. Juul (Norway): It is my pleasure to speak on \r\nbehalf of the Nordic countries, Denmark, Finland, \r\nIceland, Norway and Sweden. \r\n Support for countries emerging from violent \r\nconflict and the prevention of relapse into conflict is a \r\nkey international responsibility. Upon establishing the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission (PBC), the international \r\ncommunity agreed on the need to strengthen the ability \r\nof the United Nations to support sustainable \r\ndemocratic development in the aftermath of conflict.  \r\n The Nordic countries remain strong supporters of \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission. Now well into its \r\nfourth session, the Commission is still very much in its \r\ninfancy. The Nordic countries are pleased to see how \r\nthe Commission has been able to adapt to and learn \r\nfrom new experiences. The upcoming 2010 review \r\nprocess presents an important opportunity to take stock \r\nof the progress made so far and plan the next steps \r\nneeded to strengthen our ability to deliver on the vision \r\nbehind the Commission’s creation. \r\n Let me take this occasion to focus on four topics: \r\nnational ownership, the importance of coordination and \r\ncoherence, the responsibility of Member States, and the \r\nrole of women in peacebuilding. \r\n First, our yardstick of success must be the degree \r\nto which the Commission helps prevent countries on its \r\nagenda from relapsing into violent conflict. That means \r\nthat it will be especially important for the PBC to build \r\nengagement for national priorities and be receptive to \r\nfeedback from national authorities and local and \r\ninternational organizations in the field. Supporting \r\ncivilian capacities in fragile States is equally vital to \r\nconsolidating peace and promoting genuine national \r\nownership. We would like to commend the \r\nCommission’s Sierra Leone configuration for the agile \r\nand speedy adoption of the Agenda for Change of the \r\nGovernment of Sierra Leone as the core strategy \r\nguiding all future national and international \r\ndevelopment efforts. The Nordic countries would like \r\nto take this opportunity to highlight the need for \r\nensuring that experiences and lessons from the field are \r\nincorporated into the upcoming review of the PBC. \r\n Our second point, which is intimately connected \r\nto the first, is that the PBC must take care not to \r\nduplicate work already done by other organizations, \r\nagencies and actors. The strength of the PBC lies in its \r\nability to bring together relevant actors, marshal \r\nresources and support the development of integrated \r\nstrategies. The Commission’s country-specific strategic \r\nframeworks must not produce new sets of priorities, \r\nbut should primarily help to ensure that existing \r\n A/64/PV.49\r\n \r\n9 09-61513 \r\n \r\nframeworks and agreed upon priorities receive \r\nadequate international attention and are adhered to by \r\ninternational and national actors.  \r\n The PBC should act as a focal point for all \r\ninterested parties engaged in peacebuilding in order to \r\nensure coordination among all relevant actors. It \r\nshould also seek to further improve its coordinated \r\nheadquarters approach to peacebuilding in order to \r\nensure greater coherence between the political mandate \r\ngiven by the Security Council and the many \r\ndevelopment and humanitarian mandates of United \r\nNations agencies. \r\n Thirdly, as Member States, we need to take a hard \r\nlook at ourselves, too. For the PBC to be able to \r\ncontribute to coherence, Member States themselves \r\nneed to have coherent peacebuilding policies. That \r\nmeans that we must maintain a consistent approach in \r\nour bilateral and multilateral actions. We cannot expect \r\nthe PBC to be able to promote coordination if we are \r\nnot able or willing to be coherent. In essence, we \r\ncannot expect the PBC to be an institutional quick fix \r\nto what is essentially a problem of inadequate political \r\nwill and attention. We, the Member States, must also \r\nensure that we mobilize and maintain the political will \r\nthat is needed to agree on and implement a truly \r\ncoordinated peacebuilding approach. \r\n Lastly, the Nordic countries would like to \r\nhighlight the importance of adequately reflecting the \r\nkey role of women in delivering sustainable peace as \r\nwe renew our efforts together. The condition of women \r\nand girls is often a clear indication of how far \r\npeacebuilding efforts have come. In the past few years, \r\nwe have seen a growing recognition by the \r\ninternational community of the importance of \r\nproviding women with the opportunity to take part in \r\ntheir countries’ peacebuilding efforts, thereby laying \r\nthe foundation for a more realistic and representative \r\nperspective of what the population in question requires \r\nin order to be able to return to a peaceful existence. \r\nThrough the integration of gender language in the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission’s formative resolutions and \r\ncontinuous deliberations, the Commission has \r\nreinforced the formal status of the “women and peace \r\nand security” norm. Moreover, the recently adopted \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1889 (2009) requires that \r\nsteps be taken to ensure sufficient funding to meet \r\nwomen’s needs in post-conflict situations and to \r\naddress the participation of women in post-conflict \r\nplanning. These are important steps that re-emphasize \r\nthe message of Council resolution 1325 (2000): the \r\nplace for women is not at the margins, but in the centre \r\nof decision-making forums. \r\n Mr. Christian (Ghana), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n In conclusion, we would like to take this \r\nopportunity to welcome Assistant Secretary-General \r\nJudy Cheng-Hopkins as the new head of the \r\nPeacebuilding Support Office (PBSO). She has \r\nimportant and difficult challenges ahead. The recent \r\nevaluation of the Peacebuilding Fund and the revision \r\nof the terms of reference for the Fund identified \r\nimportant challenges that required the attention of the \r\nPeacebuilding Support Office to ensure full \r\nimplementation of the Fund’s mandate. Let me assure \r\nthe Assembly that the PBSO will have our full support \r\nin addressing these issues. In this regard, we welcome \r\nas an early example of renewed efforts to play a \r\ncatalytic role the recent decision to make a large \r\ndisbursement by the Peacebuilding Fund to the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo for the purposes of \r\ncombating sexual violence. Ms. Cheng-Hopkins also \r\nproved her commitment to addressing the important \r\nrole of the PBSO in promoting and enhancing \r\ncommunication between field level and headquarters \r\nby visiting the field immediately after being appointed. \r\nThe Nordic countries commend her for that and assure \r\nher of our continued support in her work.  \r\n We also welcome the strong leadership of the \r\nSecretary-General in advancing the peacebuilding \r\nagenda as we enter a process aiming to further \r\nstrengthen the ability of the United Nations to deliver \r\nin this field. The Nordic countries reaffirm our \r\ncontinued commitment to a strong United Nations in \r\ndelivering on an ambitious peacebuilding vision. \r\n Mr. Srivali (Thailand): Thailand aligns itself \r\nwith the statement delivered by the representative of \r\nJamaica on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement. \r\n Thailand welcomes the report of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission (PBC) (A/64/341) and \r\ncommends the Permanent Representative of Chile for \r\nhis leadership in guiding the work of the Commission. \r\nWe thank the Chairs of the country-specific \r\nconfigurations and the Working Group on Lessons \r\nLearned and the head of the Peacebuilding Support \r\nOffice (PBSO) for their active and constructive \r\nengagement with all stakeholders to advance the cause \r\nof peacebuilding. \r\nA/64/PV.49  \r\n \r\n09-61513 10 \r\n \r\n Thailand also thanks the Secretary-General for \r\nhis report on the Peacebuilding Fund (PBF) (A/64/217) \r\nand welcomes the Fund’s contributions to the \r\nadvancement of peace, security and development \r\nworldwide. As one of the contributors, Thailand is \r\npleased that the Fund, currently active in 12 countries, \r\nhas been instrumental in laying a foundation for peace \r\nin countries that have recently emerged from conflict \r\nand in preventing many fragile situations from \r\nrelapsing. Since its establishment three years ago, the \r\nCommission, with the assistance of the Support Office, \r\nhas made commendable progress. It has been \r\nconsolidating its core advisory role and support for \r\ncountries on its agenda and providing lessons learned \r\nthat will benefit many more countries. \r\n As a member of the Commission, Thailand has \r\nconsistently supported the Commission in its efforts to \r\ngive priority to national ownership, strengthen national \r\ncapacity and promote inclusive dialogue among the \r\nstakeholders. We believe that that inclusive and \r\nnationally owned approach, with strong and consistent \r\nsupport from the international community, will help \r\nsustain peace, security and development in post-\r\nconflict societies in the long term. \r\n Thailand believes that security and development \r\nare closely intertwined and mutually dependent. In the \r\npursuit of durable peace, therefore, the Commission \r\nshould seek to advance both security and development \r\nin parallel. We agree that disarmament, demobilization \r\nand reintegration and security sector reform should be \r\nurgently carried out in any peacebuilding process. At \r\nthe same time, we strongly believe that issues such as \r\nemployment, income generation, basic needs, \r\neducation and developing livelihoods should be given \r\nno less attention as an integral part of post-conflict \r\nreintegration and rehabilitation. \r\n In that regard, youth and women have an \r\nimportant role to play in peacebuilding. Successfully \r\nmeeting their needs in the immediate aftermath of \r\nconflict presents both opportunity and challenge for \r\npeacebuilding programmes. Youth, if exploited or \r\nneglected, can be a destabilizing factor in society. \r\nWomen, meanwhile, are often highly vulnerable in \r\nconflict and post-conflict situations. Yet both groups \r\nhave the potential to re-energize their economy and to \r\nheal the social fabric. That potential should be brought \r\nout and developed to encourage greater ownership in \r\nthe peacebuilding process. \r\n Thailand believes that the transition from \r\npeacekeeping to peacebuilding should be seamless and \r\ntheir roles complementary. Peacekeepers should build \r\nupon their early presence on the ground and \r\nbackground knowledge about the relevant actors and \r\nthe conflict. In doing so, they can serve as early \r\npeacebuilders, provided they have a clear mandate and \r\nadequate resources. \r\n We agree with the recommendation that the \r\nSecurity Council should more actively utilize the \r\nadvice of the Commission in the Council’s \r\nconsideration of post-conflict situations. In that \r\nconnection, Thailand welcomes the presidential \r\nstatement of the Security Council adopted on 22 July \r\n2009 (S/PRST/2009/23), under the presidency of \r\nUganda, which recognizes the importance of launching \r\npeacebuilding assistance at the earliest possible stage. \r\nWe are pleased that the Council has affirmed, in its \r\nown deliberations, the importance of the early \r\nconsideration of peacebuilding and that it has pledged \r\nto ensure coherence between peacemaking, \r\npeacekeeping, peacebuilding and development in order \r\nto achieve an early and effective response to post-\r\nconflict situations. \r\n In any post-conflict situation it is natural to have \r\nhigh expectations and a great sense of optimism about \r\nthe future. Thus, it is vital to ensure that stakeholders \r\nin society benefit equitably from quick peace \r\ndividends. That is essential for continued stability, \r\nwhich is a necessary condition for the revitalization of \r\nthe political, economic and social life of a post-conflict \r\nsociety. \r\n In that context, Thailand fully supports enhancing \r\nthe Peacebuilding Fund to make it more effective and \r\nresponsive to urgent needs on the ground. We also \r\nwelcome its revised terms of reference, as endorsed by \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 63/282. We cannot \r\nemphasize enough the importance of a quick response \r\nand the need for timely and predictable funding to \r\nsupport peacebuilding work. We therefore encourage \r\nfurther efforts to build and strengthen the partnership \r\nbetween the Fund and other sources of funding, so as \r\nto bridge financial gaps and allow funding flexibility \r\nfor urgent situations. Funding peace is not easy, but \r\nallowing hard-won peace to relapse into conflict is \r\nmuch more costly on so many levels. \r\n In that connection, Thailand encourages Member \r\nStates, especially those that have not yet done so, to \r\n A/64/PV.49\r\n \r\n11 09-61513 \r\n \r\nextend their support to the Fund. In-kind contributions \r\nand technical assistance through both North-South and \r\nSouth-South cooperation would be of immense value in \r\nassisting ongoing peacebuilding efforts, especially in \r\nthe light of declining financial aid owing to the global \r\neconomic and financial crisis. We also support targeted \r\ndisbursement of the Fund, which would enhance its \r\neffectiveness and usefulness as a catalyst for key \r\npeacebuilding priorities identified by recipient \r\ncountries. Wherever possible, efforts should be made to \r\nmaximize the synergy between the Fund and the \r\nCommission. \r\n Synergy also needs to be cultivated among \r\nvarious peacebuilding efforts. Efforts within the \r\nframework of the United Nations, in particular the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, are critically important in \r\ncoordinating and mobilizing system-wide assistance \r\nfor post-conflict countries. At the same time, \r\ncomplementary efforts by other actors, individual and \r\nregional, should also be welcomed. Better coordination \r\namong those multiple efforts would allow for more \r\nefficient resource allocation. The ultimate beneficiaries \r\nwould be the people of the post-conflict societies that \r\nwe are trying to help. \r\n While the Commission has made significant \r\nprogress, there is always room for improvement in any \r\ncomplicated endeavour such as this. Areas that deserve \r\nspecial attention include strengthening coordination \r\nwith partners, developing integrated peacebuilding \r\nstrategies, addressing funding gaps for peacebuilding \r\npriorities in countries on its agenda and raising public \r\nawareness about the role of the Commission. \r\n In that regard, we look forward to constructive \r\nconsultations leading to a review of the Commission’s \r\narrangements in 2010. Our goal is to build on the \r\nexperience that the Commission has gained and to \r\nfurther enhance the effectiveness of its support for \r\ncountries emerging from conflict. As a member of the \r\nCommission’s Organizational Committee, Thailand \r\nwill continue to work closely with our partners in order \r\nto further improve and to strengthen the Commission. \r\n Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): I would \r\nlike to express Egypt’s appreciation to the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission (PBC) for its valuable \r\nreport on its work during the past year (A/64/341) and \r\nto the Secretary-General for his report on the work of \r\nthe Peacebuilding Fund (A/64/217). We would like to \r\nexpress our thanks to His Excellency the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Chile for the report that he presented \r\ntoday and for the important role that he is playing in \r\nleading the work of the Commission, in parallel with \r\nthe chairmanships of the regional groups. I would like \r\nto associate ourselves with the statement delivered by \r\nthe Permanent Representative of Jamaica on behalf of \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement. \r\n Egypt gave its full support to the establishment of \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission in 2005, based on its \r\nfirm belief in the important role that it plays in \r\npreventing countries emerging from conflict from \r\nrelapsing back into conflict. Furthermore, since 2005, \r\nas a member of the Organizational Committee, we have \r\nsupported the establishment and the consolidation of \r\nthe concrete foundations needed for the Commission’s \r\nwork. We also contributed to the review of the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund in 2009, in addition to the creation \r\nof the four country-specific configurations within the \r\nCommission, all of which resulted in the reactivation \r\nand reorganization of its mandate and working \r\nmethods. In that regard, we look forward to \r\nparticipating in the review process of the Commission \r\nin 2010 in implementation of the General Assembly \r\nresolution adopted for that purpose. \r\n The Commission has played an increasingly \r\nimportant role in recent years by initiating discussions, \r\nfor example on the effectiveness of the United Nations \r\nin conflict-resolution, peacekeeping and post-conflict \r\npeacebuilding, and the degree of coordination and \r\nsynchronization required among the three phases, as \r\nwell as the role of the principal organs of the United \r\nNations in comprehensively addressing post-conflict \r\nsituations, based on the full implementation of the \r\nprovisions contained in the resolutions establishing the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, namely, Assembly \r\nresolution 60/180 and Security Council resolution 1645 \r\n(2005). \r\n Despite the controversy that arose during the \r\nnegotiations on General Assembly resolution 60/180 \r\nregarding the possibility of synchronizing \r\npeacebuilding and peacekeeping operations, recent \r\nviews advocate the need to start both operations \r\nsimultaneously. Egypt believes that such views merit \r\ncareful consideration and recognizes the need to \r\ncomprehensively study that approach with a view to \r\nstrengthening the essential link between peacekeeping, \r\npeacebuilding and overall development. The success of \r\na peacekeeping operation depends primarily on \r\nestablishing a comprehensive peace agreement to \r\nA/64/PV.49  \r\n \r\n09-61513 12 \r\n \r\nwhich all the parties involved are committed in order to \r\ncreate the enabling environment needed to launch a \r\npeacebuilding process that aims to develop key \r\nbuilding blocks for overall development, in accordance \r\nwith the mandate of the Peacebuilding Commission, as \r\nstated in paragraph 2 (b) of General Assembly \r\nresolution 60/180:  \r\n “To focus attention on the reconstruction \r\nand institution-building efforts necessary for \r\nrecovery from conflict and to support the \r\ndevelopment of integrated strategies in order to \r\nlay the foundation for sustainable development” \r\naimed at reaching the goals that we all wish to achieve, \r\nand to provide the necessary funding, which is an area \r\nof utmost importance for us. Taking into consideration \r\nthe two reports by the Commission and the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Egypt would like to make a number of \r\nobservations with a view to enabling the Commission \r\nto further achieve its objectives in the future. \r\n First, we need to ensure that the Commission \r\ncontinues to effectively provide advice and proposals, \r\nbased on in-depth studies, and in coordination with all \r\ninfluential actors, with a view to formulating and \r\nimplementing comprehensive and integrated strategies \r\nfor peacebuilding that lay the foundations for \r\nsustainable development in States emerging from \r\nconflict. \r\n Second, we need to develop the means for the \r\nCommission to interact with countries on its agenda, \r\nthrough the increase of field visits by the Commission \r\nin order to create a direct channel of communication \r\nwith all relevant parties and the States concerned, as \r\nwell as to provide the needed financial resources to \r\nimplement such visits so as to be fully aware of the \r\nsituation on the ground. \r\n Third, the Commission should continue to \r\ndevelop its institutional relationships with the General \r\nAssembly, the Security Council and the Economic and \r\nSocial Council. Those relationships still require further \r\nclarification and specification, in full respect of the \r\ninstitutional balance and in accordance with the \r\nrespective competence of each of them as defined by \r\nthe Charter. \r\n Fourth, we need to re-evaluate the initial rules of \r\nprocedure developed for the Commission in light of the \r\ndevelopments and accumulated experiences during the \r\nfirst years of its operations, so as to ensure that those \r\ninstitutional rules are clear and that the cases under \r\nconsideration by the Commission are dealt with \r\naccording to specific and objective standards and \r\ncriteria, free from any political or financial \r\nconsiderations. \r\n In addition, we need to enhance coordination \r\namong the different structures of the Commission so as \r\nto ensure the integration and harmonization of those \r\nefforts when it develops comprehensive strategies for \r\npeacebuilding. Putting to use the recommendations of \r\nthe Working Group on Lessons Learned is also \r\nrequired. \r\n Fifth, we need to reemphasize the principles of \r\nnational ownership with regards to the planning and \r\nimplementation of country-specific strategies, as well \r\nas in terms of the planning, coordination and \r\ntermination of the work of the Commission through a \r\nnational and sovereign decision and in accordance with \r\nspecific political, economic, social and developmental \r\ncriteria that are clear and not subject to any external \r\npressure. \r\n Sixth, there is also a need to maximize the \r\nCommission’s benefits from the current capacities of \r\nthe United Nations, international financial institutions \r\nand the donor community in support of peacebuilding \r\nefforts. There is also the importance of establishing a \r\nmonitoring and follow-up mechanism to ensure \r\nimplementation of all relevant national and \r\ninternational obligations relating to peacebuilding \r\npriorities agreed between the Commission and the State \r\nconcerned. \r\n Seventh, we need to ensure that the role of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission is not diluted into a mere \r\ntrusteeship role over countries emerging from conflict \r\nor into a facilitator bringing donor and recipient \r\ncountries together under the supervision of the \r\nprincipal organs of the United Nations. We need to \r\nstrengthen the central role and responsibilities of \r\nnon-donor members of the Organizational Committee. \r\nThat requires an in-depth and comprehensive \r\nassessment of the functions of the country-specific \r\nconfigurations and the development of common \r\nstandards and criteria, in accordance with which the \r\ncountry-specific configurations would carry out the \r\nresponsibilities of reviewing and approving projects \r\nthat fall within the priority plan of the State concerned, \r\nwithout any conditionality and in full respect of the \r\n A/64/PV.49\r\n \r\n13 09-61513 \r\n \r\nsovereignty and independence of the political decisions \r\nof the Member State concerned. \r\n Eighth, the secretariat of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission requires our continued support and the \r\nnecessary financial and human resources enabling it to \r\nplay its expected role in supporting the Commission’s \r\nmeetings as well as the country-specific configurations \r\nmeetings. Those meetings require simultaneous \r\ninterpretation services, a staff increase and an increase \r\nin the coordination and cooperation between existing \r\nstaff of the Peacebuilding Support Office and the new \r\nhead of the Support Office, Assistant Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ms. Cheng-Hopkins, whom we congratulate \r\non her appointment. \r\n Egypt welcomes the results of the review process \r\nof the Peacebuilding Fund and the pledges made by the \r\ndonor community amounting to $312.9 million, which \r\nallows the Fund to expand its operations to 52 projects \r\nin 12 countries. That reflects the commitment of \r\nMember States to continue supporting the Fund to \r\nachieve its desired objectives. \r\n While we welcome those efforts, there is, \r\nhowever, an urgent need to clarify our vision with \r\nrespect to the relationship between the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission and the Peacebuilding Fund. Despite the \r\nindependence of the Fund, under the authority of the \r\nSecretary-General, further improvements are required \r\nregarding the coordination and coherence between its \r\nactivities and the funding programmes for the projects \r\nbeing implemented in the countries on the \r\nCommission’s agenda, as well as regarding the role of \r\nthe Commission in providing guidance for Fund \r\npolicies, which are to be implemented under the \r\nsupervision of the administrative agent. \r\n Egypt is looking forward to the start of the 2010 \r\nreview process of the Peacebuilding Commission, a \r\nprocess which we trust will be completed effectively \r\nand in full cooperation with all Member States, taking \r\ninto consideration lessons learned and the accumulated \r\nexperiences from the first years of the Commission’s \r\nwork, with a view to fully implement the provisions of \r\nits mandate and enhance its capacity to deal with \r\npeacebuilding issues, thus building on the success of \r\npeacekeeping efforts and laying the foundations for the \r\nlaunch of sustainable development processes with their \r\nvaried dimensions. \r\n Mr. Hoang Chi Trung (Viet Nam): On behalf of \r\nthe Vietnamese delegation, I would like to express our \r\nappreciation for the presentation of the report of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission (PBC) and the report of the \r\nSecretary-General on the Peacebuilding Fund \r\ncontained in documents A/64/341 and A/64/217, \r\nrespectively. \r\n My delegation associates itself with the statement \r\ndelivered by the representative of Jamaica on behalf of \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). \r\n Out of the desire to establish a coordinated, \r\ncoherent and integrated approach to post-conflict \r\npeacebuilding, the 2005 World Summit operationalized \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission, the Peacebuilding \r\nFund and the Peacebuilding Support Office. Those \r\norganizations were created to help address the special \r\nneeds of countries emerging from conflict towards \r\nrecovery and reconstruction. \r\n We commend the action taken by the Commission \r\nover the past three years and, through the \r\nOrganizational Committee and its country-specific \r\nconfigurations, the implementation of its mandate and \r\ncore functions, as stipulated by General Assembly \r\nresolution 60/180 and Security Council resolution 1645 \r\n(2005). \r\n The Commission has delivered tangible results in \r\nits activities in cooperation with the United Nations \r\nprincipal organs, agencies, funds and programmes, as \r\nwell as with regional and subregional organizations \r\nand international financial institutions. It has enhanced \r\npublic awareness and outreach, capacity-building and \r\npolicy guidance on peacebuilding, as well as improving \r\nprocedures and working methods. \r\n We are also heartened to note that, during the \r\nperiod from July 2008 to June 2009, given its revised \r\nterms of reference, the Peacebuilding Fund now has \r\none of the broadest donor bases of any multi-donor \r\ntrust fund administered by the United Nations, with a \r\nportfolio of more than $312 million from 45 donors, \r\nand is operating 87 peacebuilding projects in 12 \r\ncountries. Some of the results of the Commission’s \r\ncontinued commitment and contributions can be seen \r\nin the achievements in reconciliation, reconstruction \r\nand reintegration by Burundi, the Central African \r\nRepublic, Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone and other \r\ncountries on the Commission’s agenda, even though \r\ntheir levels of progress are not yet equal nor as \r\nsustained as we could wish. \r\nA/64/PV.49  \r\n \r\n09-61513 14 \r\n \r\n Now that the United Nations peacebuilding \r\narchitecture is in place and taking on an extensive \r\nworkload, the challenge is how to consolidate the \r\nachievements made thus far and generate added value \r\nin the period ahead. As the Commission enters its \r\nfourth year of operation, much remains to be done to \r\nenable the Commission to truly become one of the key \r\ninternational instruments coordinating peacebuilding \r\nactivities. In order to achieve this, the Commission \r\nshould redouble its efforts to improve its working \r\nmethods and provisional rules of procedure. It should \r\nrationalize its institutional relationships with other \r\nUnited Nations bodies and non-United Nations entities \r\nwith a view to achieving better coherence, \r\ncomplementarity and division of labour. It should \r\nensure that its work is closely linked to and driven by \r\nthe best interests of recipient countries, particularly \r\nthose most affected by protracted conflict, \r\nunderdevelopment or marginalization. \r\n In view of current constraints on global \r\nresources, the Peacebuilding Fund has the difficult task \r\nof bridging funding gaps, expanding the pool of donors \r\nand recipients and accommodating local Governments’ \r\nfinancial and institutional absorptive capabilities. \r\nEfforts should also be made to strengthen the catalytic \r\nfocus of the Fund in the four designated priority areas: \r\nsupport for peace agreements; the promotion of \r\ncoexistence and peaceful resolution of conflict; early \r\neconomic recovery and immediate peace dividends; \r\nand the establishment of essential administrative \r\nservices and capacity-building. The Commission may \r\nbecome involved in various activities within different \r\npost-conflict contexts, and thus a comprehensive, \r\ncross-cutting and country-specific approach is \r\nessential. It is our firm belief that further \r\nimprovements in the development agenda will help \r\naddress the root causes of conflicts, nurture \r\nautonomous capacity and create a foundation for \r\nlasting peace and development. In order for \r\npeacebuilding to yield concrete and sustained results, \r\nthe local people should be empowered and fully \r\ninvolved in all related phases and activities. \r\n We look forward to next year’s review of the \r\nCommission’s activities, as established in its founding \r\nresolutions, namely, Assembly resolution 60/180 and \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1645 (2005). The review \r\nwill provide a good opportunity for Member States to \r\ntake stock, encourage new momentum and fine-tune \r\nthe working methods and direction of the Commission. \r\nAlong these lines, we welcome the Commission’s \r\nefforts to assess its work and come up with \r\nrecommendations for how it can best participate and \r\nplay an advisory role in post-conflict situations. \r\n We hope that throughout this entire process, \r\nMember States will have opportunities to deepen their \r\ninteractions with the Commission, and that valuable \r\nlessons, practices and synergies will be developed, thus \r\nhelping not only to prevent the countries concerned \r\nfrom relapsing into conflict, but also to reinforce the \r\nearly-warning capacity for anticipating potential \r\nconflicts and to engage the international community in \r\naddressing them in a timely and more effective manner. \r\n Mrs. Wahab (Indonesia): Our appreciation goes \r\nto the Peacebuilding Commission (PBC) for its report \r\n(A/64/341), as well as to the Secretary-General for his \r\nreport on the Peacebuilding Fund (A/64/217). \r\nIndonesia associates itself with the statement delivered \r\nby Jamaica on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement. \r\n Indonesia is pleased to see the Commission \r\ncontinue to strive to achieve the goals of its founding \r\nmandate. The efforts of the Organizational Committee \r\nand the four country-specific configurations \r\ndemonstrate the Commission’s hard work and \r\ndedication not only to bring improvements to the \r\ncountries on its agenda but also to enhance global \r\nattention and support for peacebuilding as a key issue \r\nof our time. We are also pleased to note that the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund is now generating benefits in 12 \r\ncountries and has the broadest donor base of any \r\nUnited Nations multi-donor trust fund. This signals the \r\nFund’s international importance, as well as its ability to \r\nfulfil expectations to contribute effectively to \r\nproducing rapid peace dividends. \r\n There are some important points in the reports \r\nthat we deem necessary to highlight and that we \r\nbelieve need more support. Both reports point to the \r\nnecessity for a comprehensive approach from an early \r\nstage. Indeed, there should be an appropriate mix of \r\nsecurity and development, since focusing on only one \r\nsuch aspect cannot enable lasting peace. To encourage \r\nan even more comprehensive approach, my delegation \r\nsupports the emphasis on the four priority areas \r\nidentified by the Secretary-General. We hope that the \r\nFund’s disbursement in the area of early economic \r\nrecovery and immediate peace dividends, which at \r\npresent has the lowest priority of the four, will be \r\nincreased in future in line with Governments’ priority \r\n A/64/PV.49\r\n \r\n15 09-61513 \r\n \r\nplans. The majority of regions affected by conflict tend \r\nto fall into the lowest income category, with scarce \r\nresources. The reports correctly recognize national \r\nownership as a key guiding principle in the work of the \r\nCommission and the Fund. The voice of a \r\ndemocratically elected Government that can be held \r\naccountable through a vote should be the bedrock of a \r\nnationally owned process. No matter how well-\r\nintentioned international initiatives are, the needs \r\nidentified by national Governments should be \r\nconsidered the blueprint for all interventions. \r\n We welcome the Commission’s acknowledgement \r\nthat there should be a single national peacebuilding \r\nstrategy, developed through a consultative process \r\namong all relevant partners at the country level. Where \r\nsuch a strategy significantly facilitates coordination \r\nbetween the national and international actors \r\nconcerned, it will simplify monitoring and \r\ndocumentation requirements for post-conflict \r\nGovernments. This single strategy could help the \r\nCommission develop expeditious and more focused \r\nengagement frameworks, and could help launch \r\ncountry support early on. \r\n We also welcome the Commission’s commitment \r\nto mobilizing financial and technical resources, which \r\nremains a core feature of its work. It is very \r\nencouraging that during the period under review the \r\ntwo Chairpersons and the Commission members \r\nundertook outreach to a variety of traditional and \r\nnon-traditional stakeholders. Broadening the range of \r\nways to generate resources is also important, in view of \r\nthe Secretary-General’s observation that the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund has yet to demonstrate its catalytic \r\nvalue in terms of attracting additional resources. \r\n In this context, Indonesia, during its membership \r\nof the Commission last year, had the privilege of \r\nfacilitating the first ever PBC Task Force on the private \r\nsector’s role in post-conflict peacebuilding. We \r\nappreciate the various initiatives by the Commission to \r\naddress critical resource gaps in the agenda countries, \r\nincluding seeking greater engagement with the private \r\nsector, foundations and philanthropists. Those \r\ninitiatives are also encouraging and vital continuations \r\nof the Commission’s previous work, and we hope they \r\nwill be further concretized. \r\n Let me now turn to two other important issues \r\nthat should also be addressed by the Commission and \r\nUnited Nations Member States, namely, follow-through \r\non the recommendations of the Secretary-General in \r\nhis report on peacebuilding in the immediate aftermath \r\nof conflict (A/63/881) and next year’s obligatory \r\nreview of the Commission, as called for in its founding \r\nresolutions, namely, Security Council resolution 1645 \r\n(2005) and General Assembly resolution 60/180. \r\n The report emphasizes the need for the United \r\nNations to have rapidly deployable civilian capacities \r\nand to strengthen national and regional capacities. It \r\nrecommends that those capacities should come from \r\nthe South and neighbouring regions. We should chart a \r\ndetailed policy on the recruitment modalities for this \r\nUnited Nations civilian capacity and its operational and \r\nfinancial aspects through an intergovernmental process. \r\nThe role of the Commission in this respect would be \r\nvery important and needs to be clarified. \r\n We note that some areas of this civilian capacity, \r\nespecially relating to the rule of law and security \r\ninstitutions, have been developed in certain United \r\nNations departments. A pertinent question would be \r\nhow these existing mechanisms will accord with the \r\nreport’s recommendations. Moreover, given that in \r\nsome crucial areas, such as economic recovery, civilian \r\ncapacities are not directly covered by the Department \r\nof Peacekeeping Operations or the Department of \r\nPolitical Affairs, we should have clear information as \r\nto whether there will be recruitment for new specialist \r\ncadres or whether staff would be drawn from the \r\nUnited Nations Development Programme and other \r\nrelevant United Nations agencies. \r\n Engagement with pertinent regional \r\norganizations — inter alia by taking advantage of the \r\nbest civilian capacities in the South and regional \r\nlessons — will also be very useful. While the United \r\nNations should make use of regional expertise, it is \r\ncritical that the United Nations also support national \r\nand regional efforts to enhance capabilities in \r\ncomprehensive peacebuilding aspects, particularly \r\nwhere those capacities are lacking. For its part, \r\nIndonesia continues to raise awareness about those \r\nissues in its region and to explore how the countries of \r\nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations can \r\ncontribute further in the area of global post-conflict \r\npeacebuilding. Indonesia plans to convene a regional \r\nworkshop on multidimensional peacekeeping and \r\npeacebuilding to be co-hosted with Slovakia early next \r\nyear. \r\nA/64/PV.49  \r\n \r\n09-61513 16 \r\n \r\n Regarding the General Assembly’s upcoming \r\nreview of the Commission as mandated in its founding \r\nresolutions, this event will indeed be a vital juncture to \r\nmake use of the experience of the Commission, United \r\nNations Member States as a whole and the relevant \r\nUnited Nations system agencies to further streamline \r\nand institute ways to enhance the effectiveness of the \r\nCommission. The review should include exploration of \r\na wider range of tangible methods to support the aims \r\nof the Commission and its configurations. We see \r\nimportant links between the review and the \r\nimplementation of the Secretary-General’s report on \r\npeacebuilding in the immediate aftermath of conflict. \r\n Finally, the outcome of the review must enable \r\nthe Commission to increase its global relevance in \r\nmaking comprehensive recommendations in the area of \r\nits mandate. We hope that it would also be supported in \r\ndevising and promoting ways to ensure more seamless \r\ntransitions from the peacekeeping to peacebuilding \r\nstages of United Nations operations. \r\n Ms. Dunlop (Brazil): The report of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission on its third session \r\n(A/64/341) provides an accurate account of the \r\nactivities undertaken by the Peacebuilding Commission \r\n(PBC) under its various configurations. Brazil is \r\npleased to notice that much progress has been made \r\nsince the establishment of the Commission in 2006. \r\nThe same applies to the work of the Peacebuilding \r\nFund. \r\n I wish to express our appreciation to the Chair of \r\nthe PBC Organizational Committee, Ambassador \r\nHeraldo Muñoz, for his dedicated efforts to promote \r\nthe work and visibility of the Commission over the past \r\nmonths. \r\n Brazil welcomes the achievements highlighted in \r\nthe report, particularly on the improvement in the \r\nworking methods of the Commission and its interaction \r\nwith United Nations principal organs, international \r\nfinancial institutions and other United Nations \r\nagencies. We also praise the initiatives to involve \r\nactors such as philanthropists and foundations in \r\npeacebuilding efforts. It is our view that the role of the \r\nprivate sector in peacebuilding could be further \r\nenhanced, especially in light of the Commission’s \r\nmandate to mobilize resources. \r\n Today’s debate comes at a crucial time, as we \r\nconsider the implementation of the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport on peacebuilding in the immediate aftermath of \r\nconflict (A/63/881) and begin our reflection on the \r\n2010 review process. \r\n A number of useful recommendations have been \r\nmade, and it is our task now to envision how they can \r\nbest contribute to strengthening the United Nations \r\ncapacity to tackle peacebuilding challenges in an \r\nexpeditious, coherent and cost-effective manner. Brazil \r\nsupports the creation of high-level coordination \r\nmechanisms, the definition of clear mandates for the \r\nvarious actors and the consideration of innovative and \r\nflexible funding instruments.  \r\n That last aspect is essential. We all know how \r\ndifficult it is to ensure adequate funding, given the \r\nmany uncertainties associated with post-conflict \r\nscenarios. We therefore appreciate the support of the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund, which has been instrumental in its \r\ncatalytic and complementary role in critical priority \r\nareas. The Fund’s new terms of reference must be \r\napplied in a manner that allows for greater synergy and \r\ncoordination with the Commission. More needs to be \r\ndone to enhance the performance of the Fund in \r\nsupporting early recovery in post-conflict countries. \r\n Ideas related to the establishment of civilian \r\nrosters or the early deployment of civilian personnel \r\nare worth exploring, provided that they not only take \r\ninto consideration existing local capacities but also \r\nhelp to build them. Tapping into the capacity of \r\nneighbouring countries and others in the global South \r\nis also critical. \r\n Brazil welcomes the focus of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report on the immediate aftermath of \r\nconflict, as an attempt to fully explore the window of \r\nopportunity to consolidate peace and avoid the relapse \r\ninto conflict. Such a focus reveals the linkages between \r\npeacekeeping and peacebuilding. If peacebuilding \r\nefforts are to be successful, they must start as early as \r\npossible, in recognition of the fact that peace, security \r\nand development are different variables in the same \r\nequation. \r\n At the same time, attention should be given to \r\nthose countries where conflict ended many years ago \r\nbut which nevertheless suffer from donor fatigue or \r\nhave never been able to garner international support. \r\nThe Commission has been playing a relevant role in \r\nsome of these countries. \r\n In the case of the Guinea-Bissau configuration, \r\nchaired by Brazil, the Commission has been able to \r\n A/64/PV.49\r\n \r\n17 09-61513 \r\n \r\naddress the priorities set forth in the strategic \r\nframework adopted last year, despite the tragic political \r\ndevelopments and the many challenges ahead. We are \r\nnow engaged in a process of reviewing that strategy to \r\nassess the progress achieved and define the next steps \r\nfor our engagement in the short term. This exercise \r\nwill inform a second allocation of Peacebuilding Fund \r\nfunding, in a demonstration of the synergy between the \r\nFund and the Commission. \r\n The 2010 review process will be a valuable \r\nopportunity to gauge the Commission’s performance \r\nand see where there is room for improvement. It is fair \r\nto say that the PBC has yet to reach its full potential, as \r\noutlined in its founding resolutions. But instead of \r\nreducing the scope of its ambitious mandate, we should \r\nthink of ways of strengthening its capacity to \r\neffectively deliver on its tasks. \r\n The work on strategic frameworks, for instance, \r\ncould be enriched through more regular and systematic \r\ninteraction with the international financial institutions \r\nand a more thorough review of existing strategies, so \r\nthat the Commission can focus on areas where its \r\nadded value is most welcome. The engagement of \r\nregional actors in that process is also crucial, given the \r\ntransformational nature of many peacebuilding \r\nchallenges. \r\n Coordination between the Peacebuilding Support \r\nOffice and other departments of the Secretariat and \r\nother agencies is key. The Commission itself would \r\nbenefit from more regular interaction with other United \r\nNations agencies, funds and programmes involved in \r\npeacebuilding. The suggested tiered approach, or \r\nlighter touch, could also be considered, provided that \r\nwe do not lose sight of the interconnection between the \r\npolitical, security and development dimensions of \r\npeacebuilding. \r\n Strengthening United Nations capacity on the \r\nground is also indispensable for the PBC. We should \r\nconceive ways of automatically enhancing the local \r\ncapacity of the United Nations once a given country is \r\nincluded on the agenda of the Commission. In the case \r\nof Guinea-Bissau, we welcome the decision to upgrade \r\nthe United Nations Peacebuilding Support Office to an \r\nintegrated peacebuilding mission, and we look forward \r\nto its positive consideration in the Fifth Committee. \r\n A strengthened United Nations presence on the \r\nground would also be important to narrow the gap \r\nbetween New York and the country concerned. It is a \r\nfact that peacebuilding must be done locally, given the \r\noverriding principle of national ownership. But it is up \r\nto us here to support the Governments concerned and \r\nto mobilize resources for the full implementation of \r\npeacebuilding strategies. In combining efforts at all \r\nlevels, we will succeed in our ultimate objective, \r\nnamely, the delivery of concrete peace dividends to \r\npopulations in war-torn societies. \r\n Mr. Le Roux (South Africa): May I begin by \r\nassociating South Africa with the statement read out on \r\nbehalf of the Non-Aligned Movement by the \r\nPermanent Representative of Jamaica. \r\n As part of reforming the United Nations, and as \r\none of the follow-up actions to the 2005 World Summit \r\nOutcome, the General Assembly adopted resolution \r\n60/180, which established the new Peacebuilding \r\nCommission (PBC). According to the resolutions that \r\ncreated the PBC, its primary role is to “bring together \r\nall relevant actors to marshal resources and to advise \r\non and propose integrated strategies for post-conflict \r\npeacebuilding and recovery” (resolution 60/180 and \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1645 (2005), paragraph \r\n2 (a)). \r\n South Africa welcomes the third annual report of \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission (A/64/341), as well as \r\nthe report of the Secretary-General on the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund (A/64/217). South Africa has noted \r\nwith satisfaction that during the past three years, the \r\nPBC has played a significant role in consolidating its \r\ncore advisory role and in responding positively to \r\ncountries emerging from conflict, although much \r\nremains to be done. \r\n My delegation welcomes the expansion of the \r\nCommission’s activities over the past three years. The \r\nPBC focused its early years on Burundi and Sierra \r\nLeone, and today it includes Guinea-Bissau and the \r\nCentral African Republic. That is an indication that \r\nsignificant strides have been made in the resolution of \r\nconflicts in Africa. We have seen that those \r\nachievements have been enhanced through \r\npeacebuilding and post-conflict reconstruction efforts. \r\n South Africa believes that the priorities in the \r\npost-conflict environment should centre around the \r\nimportant pillars of post-conflict reconstruction, \r\nnamely, security, social and economic development, \r\njustice and reconciliation, good governance, and \r\nparticipation. In our view, the development of national \r\nintegrated peacebuilding strategies based on national \r\nA/64/PV.49  \r\n \r\n09-61513 18 \r\n \r\nownership, mutual accountability and sustained \r\npartnership has provided the platform for donors to \r\nengage and to coordinate their support around national \r\npriorities. Similarly, the integrated strategic framework \r\ncould increasingly direct the coordination and focus of \r\nUnited Nations agencies to particular priorities \r\nidentified by the national Governments concerned. \r\nSouth Africa therefore welcomes the significant role \r\nplayed by the international community in assisting \r\npost-conflict countries overcome their challenges. \r\n My delegation regards close cooperation between \r\nthe PBC and regional and subregional organizations as \r\ncritical to ensuring the coordination of post-conflict \r\npeacebuilding activities. South Africa therefore \r\nwelcomes the meeting between the Peace and Security \r\nCouncil of the African Union and the delegation from \r\nthe PBC dispatched to Addis Ababa in November 2009. \r\nThe Peace and Security Council reiterated its \r\nencouragement to the PBC to pursue and intensify its \r\nefforts in order to effectively contribute to the \r\nconsolidation of peace in Africa and the recovery of \r\ncountries emerging from conflict. \r\n South Africa recognizes the detrimental impact of \r\nthe current financial crisis on countries emerging from \r\nconflict. The role of the PBC in marshalling and \r\nmobilizing resources is therefore critical. South Africa \r\nis pleased that the Peacebuilding Fund has not only \r\nassisted countries on the Commission’s agenda but has \r\nalso provided support to eight countries in similar \r\ncircumstance, as designated by the Secretary-General. \r\nWe therefore encourage Member States to contribute \r\ngenerously to the Fund. That will allow for the timely \r\nand quick injection of resources in countries emerging \r\nfrom conflict. \r\n My delegation welcomes the revised terms of \r\nreference for transforming the Peacebuilding Fund’s \r\nthree-window architecture into two facilities. In our \r\nview, that will improve the Fund’s performance \r\nthrough greater operational responsiveness and \r\nincreased efficiency. The success of the PBC must be \r\ndetermined by the impact it has on the lives of ordinary \r\ncitizens in terms of their safety, security, and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n South Africa recognizes that the PBC still means \r\ndifferent things to different people. The lack of \r\nunderstanding of its role underscores the need for \r\ngreater visibility and more outreach. The upcoming \r\n2010 review process of the Peacebuilding Commission \r\nwill provide an opportunity for all of us to take stock \r\nand measure the impact of the implementation of the \r\nPBC’s mandate. We believe that that process will also \r\ndraw from lessons learned by the PBC in previous \r\nyears, while paying attention to critical peacebuilding \r\npriorities, gaps and achievements. South Africa stands \r\nready to assist in any way possible to ensure that the \r\nobjectives of the PBC emanating from the review \r\nprocess are implemented appropriately. \r\n In conclusion, I wish to express our deep \r\nappreciation to the Chair of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission and the Chairs of the country-specific \r\nconfigurations and to the working groups on lessons \r\nlearned for their sterling work and contributions to the \r\nPBC. I also wish to also take this opportunity to pay \r\ntribute to the staff of the Peacebuilding Support Office \r\nfor their supportive role in the work of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission. \r\n Mr. Gutiérrez (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nreport of the Peacebuilding Commission on its third \r\nsession (A/64/341) and the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the Peacebuilding Fund (A/64/217) enable \r\nus to evaluate the important work done to restore peace \r\nand build sustainable stability in countries that have \r\nemerged from conflict. \r\n With regard to the Peacebuilding Commission, it \r\nis essential to point out that its work transcends mere \r\ncoordination. The Commission’s true importance lies in \r\nits objective of adopting integrated peacebuilding \r\nstrategies that coordinate efforts of national, regional \r\nand international actors in countries recovering from \r\nconflict. \r\n With regard to the Peacebuilding Fund, my \r\ndelegation has been closely monitoring the \r\nachievements by several countries in implementing \r\nprojects. The timely assistance provided by the \r\nPeacebuilding Support Office in Burundi, where the \r\nproject implementation rate has reached 75 per cent, \r\nshould be highlighted. Another example is the case of \r\nthe Central African Republic, where the Fund has \r\ncontributed to demobilization and reintegration \r\nactivities and where the development of the United \r\nNations integrated strategic framework was completed \r\nlast May, opening a window of opportunity for \r\nevaluating a second tranche under the Fund for that \r\nAfrican country. \r\n There are several other examples in the Fund’s \r\nreport, but the important point my delegation would \r\n A/64/PV.49\r\n \r\n19 09-61513 \r\n \r\nlike to emphasize is that the report gives tangible \r\nexamples of how the Peacebuilding Fund — to which \r\nPeru contributes — has a genuine relevance that \r\nstrengthens peacebuilding processes, as indicated in the \r\nSecretary-General’s report. The implementation of the \r\nvarious projects listed and explained in the report has \r\nled to positive results in the areas of administrative and \r\npolicy management, justice and human rights, the fight \r\nagainst corruption, security sector reform and, \r\nespecially, the empowerment of women and civil \r\nsociety. \r\n The lack of a culture of peace, violence and \r\narbitrariness in the use of power, the marginalization of \r\nthe most vulnerable and of minorities and in general a \r\ntendency to act solely with a focus on survival are \r\ncharacteristics that become permanent and structural \r\nfeatures in the context of prolonged conflicts. To \r\ncounteract that situation, we need to reconstruct the \r\nsocial fabric and generate democratic values of \r\ntolerance and participation that confirm in the mind of \r\nthe people the idea that only in peace can security and \r\nquality of life truly take root. \r\n In the aforementioned reports, we see the \r\nimportance of supporting the implementation of the \r\npeace agreements, encouraging coexistence and \r\npeaceful resolution of conflicts, promoting early \r\neconomic recovery, reaping the benefits of peace, \r\nrebuilding infrastructures and recovering technical \r\ncapacity, which are the general features that have made \r\npossible the efforts to develop projects that contribute \r\nto peacebuilding. In that connection, my delegation \r\nwishes to emphasize in particular the critical \r\nimportance of the interdependence of the concepts of \r\ndevelopment and security. \r\n Another no less relevant aspect to bear in mind is \r\nthe ongoing coordination and interaction that the \r\nCommission and the Fund must maintain with the other \r\nUnited Nations organs. The synergy between the \r\nCommission and the Fund extends to the necessary \r\ninterrelation and interaction with international and \r\nregional bodies. That requires convergence of actions \r\nand an additional coordination of efforts that should be \r\neven further strengthened. \r\n A conclusion that can be drawn from the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission’s first three years of efforts \r\nis that, immediately after a conflict ends, there is \r\nalways greater pressure from the population to receive \r\nthe dividends of peace, and that situation arises in a \r\ncontext where capacities and resources are scarce. That \r\nreality, in the view of my delegation, leads to \r\nidentifying the fight against poverty as the primary \r\nobjective that every peacebuilding process must bear in \r\nmind, since poverty is the most severe problem \r\nafflicting any country that has recently suffered a \r\nconflict. \r\n Therefore we believe that the transition from \r\npeacebuilding to State building is of the highest \r\nimportance, and that is why an effective campaign \r\nagainst the strategic gap between weak institutional \r\ncapacity and the delay in project financing is \r\nindispensable. Moreover, improving the institutional \r\ncapacity of Governments is a priority, since the \r\nnational actors are the real protagonists in the \r\ndevelopment of jobs and the implementation of \r\npeacebuilding processes. \r\n In the same way, those processes need designs \r\nthat improve the division of labour in order to promote \r\neffective management of project implementation and \r\ngreater involvement by women as important actors in \r\nevery process. They must also promote the \r\ndecentralization of decision-making among staff of \r\ncooperating organizations in such a way that the \r\nproject implementation rate is more effective. \r\n Thus we believe that in the final analysis, there \r\nare three vital areas that must be worked on in a \r\nholistic manner in any peacebuilding process: \r\ndevelopment, security, and governance. We must \r\nrefrain from giving pre-eminence to any one area over \r\nanother, for they are all closely linked. \r\n In areas of international cooperation, my \r\ndelegation believes that priority should be given to \r\nstrengthening the political system, training civilian \r\nstaff and designing and implementing projects that \r\nhave rapid social impact, which is crucial to winning \r\nthe support of the local population. Financial \r\ninstitutions — including the World Bank, a natural ally \r\nin peacebuilding efforts — are essential to the success \r\nof projects. \r\n For a society to be involved in those \r\npeacebuilding projects, it must remain clear that \r\ninternational cooperation is oriented towards \r\nstrengthening the exercise of its sovereignty, with full \r\nrespect for international law and the principles of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter. However, such cooperation \r\nmust have a timeframe and follow a programme with \r\nA/64/PV.49  \r\n \r\n09-61513 20 \r\n \r\nclearly defined objectives and definite goals that make \r\nit viable. \r\n General Assembly resolution 63/282, which \r\napproved the revision of the terms of reference for the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund to make it more flexible, adaptable \r\nand more responsive to urgent needs, and the upcoming \r\nreview of the Peacebuilding Commission, which will \r\nseek to define the Commission’s rules of procedure and \r\nworking methods, both open an extraordinary window \r\nof opportunity to impart greater effectiveness and \r\nefficiency to the Commission’s work with the \r\nindispensable interrelation between the Fund and the \r\nPeacebuilding Support Office. \r\n There is no lasting peace if it is not accompanied \r\nfrom an early phase by policies of sustainable \r\ndevelopment, democracy, social inclusion and \r\ninstitutional soundness. As my country has stated on \r\nvarious occasions, development, security and \r\ngovernance are closely related. That is the spirit \r\ninspiring my country in its firm commitment to \r\nstrengthen the United Nations peacebuilding structure \r\nwith constructive initiatives. \r\n My country wishes to thank Ambassador Heraldo \r\nMuñoz for his work on the Peacebuilding Commission. \r\nI believe it is an example of how Latin America is \r\nseriously focusing on the work in this undertaking of \r\nthe United Nations.  \r\n With that conviction Peru, which is unwaveringly \r\ncommitted to strengthening multilateralism and \r\npeacekeeping, hopes in the near future to contribute as \r\nan active member of the Organizational Committee of \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission. \r\n Mr. Benmehidi (Algeria) (spoke in French): I \r\nwould like to thank the President for having organized \r\nthis debate so that together we can consider the various \r\naspects of work carried out by the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission during its third year of existence. \r\n We fully align ourselves with the statement made \r\nby the Permanent Representative of Jamaica on behalf \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement. My delegation would \r\nlike to offer a few additional comments. \r\n The Peacebuilding Commission, three years old \r\nnow, is increasingly becoming a major partner and a \r\ndynamic actor in guiding, in support of national \r\nmechanisms, strategies to support countries emerging \r\nfrom conflict.  \r\n As a member of the Peacebuilding Commission, \r\nAlgeria appreciates the work done to develop and \r\nimplement strategic frameworks for peacebuilding in \r\nthe four countries on the Commission’s agenda by \r\nusing targeted priorities and commitments adapted with \r\na view to peacebuilding in those countries. The credit \r\nfor drawing up those strategic documents goes first to \r\nthe resolve of the national authorities of those \r\ncountries, but also to the exemplary work of the \r\nChairmen of the four country configurations, each of \r\nwhom has managed to build a relationship of trust with \r\nall the national actors, to establish a process that brings \r\nthem together and to lay the foundations for a strategy \r\nthat unites their efforts. \r\n The Chairman of the Peacebuilding Commission, \r\nAmbassador Heraldo Muñoz, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Chile — whom I would like to \r\ncommend for his leadership and imaginative actions — \r\nhas just presented to us the main points of the report \r\nwe are considering (A/64/341). Of course, it is an \r\ninterim assessment of the work done by the young \r\nPeacebuilding Commission with the steadfast support \r\nof the Peacebuilding Support Office. In reading it, one \r\ngets a sense of the strong commitment of its member \r\nStates not to strengthening a new institutional \r\nbureaucracy, but rather to progressively set up a \r\nmultidimensional strategy designed to respond to the \r\npolitical, security, humanitarian and development \r\nchallenges that interlock and overlap in the various \r\ncontexts, forming a complex whole. Basically, the \r\nreport describes the positive developments in the \r\nCommission’s work, while acknowledging the \r\nexistence of certain difficulties.  \r\n The Commission has strengthened its main \r\nadvisory activities and enjoys the broad support of the \r\ncountries on its agenda. The international community is \r\nalso paying more attention to the countries on its \r\nagenda. One notes too that the United Nations system \r\nand the regional organizations and the international \r\nfinancial institutions have begun to align themselves by \r\nadapting their support tools to post-conflict \r\npeacebuilding. \r\n On the other hand, one gets a better sense of the \r\nchallenges to the potential work of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission. Indeed, after the tragic experiences in \r\nBurundi and Guinea-Bissau, the Commission is now in \r\na position to draw lessons to prevent those same events \r\nfrom happening again. That has highlighted the \r\n A/64/PV.49\r\n \r\n21 09-61513 \r\n \r\nimportance of the role played by the Working Group on \r\nLessons Learned, chaired by El Salvador.  \r\n I also believe it important to acknowledge the \r\nreport of the Secretary-General on peacebuilding in the \r\nimmediate aftermath of conflict (A/63/881), which is \r\nthe first comprehensive analysis of peacebuilding in \r\npost-conflict situations since the establishment of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission. It also has the merit of \r\ncalling for the early integration of post-conflict \r\nreconstruction in the entry strategies, realizing that that \r\nis a structural aspect that is crucial to strengthening the \r\nfactors of peace as a country emerges from conflict. \r\nMoreover, I am pleased that that report inspired the \r\nnegotiations that led to the review of the Peacebuilding \r\nFund’s terms of the reference, in order to improve the \r\nefficiency of its management and its ability to rapidly \r\nproduce results on the ground, in accordance with the \r\nintended goals. \r\n However, the direction of the Commission and its \r\nwork are not exempt from criticism. In that regard, I \r\nbelieve that the perception of the problems and the \r\nobstacles remains very mixed and calls for correction.  \r\n The security approach having precedence over \r\nthe development dimension, in particular in \r\nimplementing disarmament, demobilization and \r\nreintegration programmes, is a leading example of that. \r\nWhile they go hand in hand to make it possible to \r\nestablish lasting stability and to start a return to \r\nnormalcy, one sees differences in views within the \r\nCommission on how to implement those programmes, \r\nsometimes giving the impression that there are \r\ncontradictory or competing elements. Also, we \r\nconsider it necessary to have an in-depth debate with a \r\nview to developing an integrated approach on that \r\nissue, an approach that would combine the security \r\nrequirements with regard to the duty to disarm and \r\ndemobilize the ex-combatants with the socio-economic \r\naspect of their reintegration. \r\n Another inadequacy observed that merits our \r\nurgent attention is the Commission’s unwieldiness. In \r\nfact it needs fewer meetings, but better prepared ones. \r\nWith regard to that aspect of the Commission’s work, \r\nmy delegation noted with interest the informal paper \r\nproduced by the Peacebuilding Support Office to \r\ngenerate joint thinking on how to make the work of the \r\ncountry configurations even more effective.  \r\n The issue of adding new countries to the \r\nCommission’s agenda is inseparable from its ability to \r\nthoroughly and effectively deal with the situations on \r\nits agenda. In 2010, Algeria intends to actively \r\nparticipate in the consideration of that issue and all \r\nother aspects, including the Peacebuilding Fund, with \r\nan open mind by suggesting, however, that it is part of \r\na comprehensive approach aimed at improving the \r\nCommission’s working methods and its reporting \r\ncycle.  \r\n In that regard, in order to prepare well for the \r\ncomprehensive review of the Commission’s working \r\nmethods and work in 2010, my delegation would like \r\nto make the following suggestions.  \r\n First, it is necessary to strengthen the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission’s visibility and its ability to \r\nmotivate and influence. Communication efforts are \r\nneeded, in particular with regard to regional \r\norganizations. One could be envisage some of the \r\nCommission’s meetings being held somewhere other \r\nthan New York, as was the case when the Chairman of \r\nthe Commission and the Chairs of the four country \r\nconfigurations went to Africa. \r\n Secondly, we should encourage the efforts of the \r\nPeacebuilding Support Office, under the leadership of \r\nMs. Cheng-Hopkins, to strengthen its own capacity to \r\nact in support of the Commission.  \r\n Thirdly, the Commission’s work should be \r\nintegrated as early as possible in strategies, in \r\nparticular those of the Security Council and other \r\ninstitutional actors, to strengthen the coherence of the \r\nOrganization as a whole. \r\n Fourthly, together with the Peacebuilding Support \r\nOffice, the Peacebuilding Fund is an important tool to \r\nensure that the Commission’s work focuses on \r\nimmediate priorities, fills gaps and produces tangible \r\nresults. In that context, it is essential to broaden the \r\nFund’s operations so as to provide strategic assistance \r\nto other countries needing urgent peacebuilding \r\nsupport. \r\n Fifthly, there is a need to open up the approaches \r\nto peacekeeping, peacebuilding and development so \r\nthat effective action can be taken in the immediate \r\naftermath of a conflict. In that regard, there must be \r\ngreater support for countries emerging from conflict in \r\norder to address the food, economic, financial and any \r\nother crises that seriously jeopardize the general \r\nprocess of stabilizing conflicts by exploring the \r\npossibility of transferring to the Peacebuilding \r\nA/64/PV.49  \r\n \r\n09-61513 22 \r\n \r\nCommission the resources that the peacekeeping \r\noperations have at their disposal in the exit phase. \r\n Sixthly and lastly, it is essential to maintain the \r\nbasic infrastructures, to protect against the inability of \r\ncountries emerging from conflict to pay their armed \r\nforces and police, and to invest in job creation projects, \r\nthereby helping to ensure greater support for United \r\nNations activities from the local populations. \r\n Mr. Maurer (Switzerland) (spoke in French): \r\nFive years ago, we laid the foundation for a \r\npeacebuilding structure within the United Nations \r\nsystem. Today, it is clear that building peace is as \r\nimportant a task as that of keeping it. United Nations \r\npeacekeeping has reached its limits, while we \r\nincreasingly recognize the significance of \r\nstrengthening our efforts to prevent conflicts and to \r\nsupport communities that are struggling to build a \r\nsustainable peace.  \r\n The 2010 review of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission will be a good opportunity to ensure that \r\nthe instruments developed after the 2005 World \r\nSummit are being used to their full potential. It will \r\nalso be an opportunity to determine how those same \r\ninstruments could be better adapted to respond to the \r\nmore complex situations prevailing today. The \r\nSeptember 2010 high-level meeting would seem to be \r\nthe proper venue to decide on the next steps to be \r\ntaken. Peacebuilding requires a substantial \r\ncommitment as much in terms of political and \r\ninstitutional investment as financial. It must be given \r\nits rightful position among our highest priorities and \r\nwe must not allow it to be reduced to an easy and less \r\ncostly alternative to peacekeeping. \r\n The report of the Secretary-General on \r\npeacebuilding in the immediate aftermath of conflict \r\n(A/63/881) is leading us in the right direction. We \r\nwelcome the recommendations and support the steps \r\ntaken by the Secretary-General to ensure their \r\nimplementation. We look forward to a progress report \r\nnext year. We also welcome the intensive and inclusive \r\nconsultations prompted by the preparation of the \r\nreport. This process was exemplary and should guide \r\nus in the preparations for the 2010 review. \r\n One of the main challenges identified in the \r\nSecretary-General’s report and highlighted in the work \r\nof the Peacebuilding Commission in its country-\r\nspecific meetings, is the need for a joint approach to \r\nconflict situations. The report also highlights the need \r\nfor more effective, coherent and coordinated action by \r\nthe United Nations, the international financial \r\ninstitutions and Member States. To that end, we are \r\nconvinced that United Nations leadership must be \r\nstrengthened, in particular the authority of Resident \r\nCoordinators as the uncontested heads of United \r\nNations country teams. We therefore call on the heads \r\nof the funds, programmes and specialized agencies to \r\nfully support the expanded authority of Resident \r\nCoordinators vis-à-vis the country teams, and to \r\nswiftly formalize this authority through an appropriate \r\ndecision by the Chief Executives Board. \r\n We are also convinced that the potential of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission should be more fully \r\nexploited. In our view, its added value resides in its \r\nrepresentative membership, its convening power for all \r\nstakeholders and its capacity to serve as a political \r\ninterface between the actors on the ground and the \r\nvarious stakeholders at United Nations Headquarters. \r\nThese characteristics are essential to creating effective \r\npartnerships for peace. Mutual accountability is a key \r\nprinciple for ensuring success. Joint strategic \r\nframeworks are useful instruments in this regard \r\nbecause they help develop and reinforce national \r\nownership and also have the potential to build trust and \r\nmutual understanding among all actors involved and \r\ncommitted to common objectives. Ultimately, \r\nimprovements must be measured by their positive \r\nimpact in the field. \r\n We believe that the 2010 review of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission will provide it with an \r\nopportunity to fulfil its potential and to help the \r\npeacebuilding architecture to better respond to new \r\nchallenges and needs. It should also help us to \r\novercome the stumbling blocks of 2005 and to achieve \r\npeace and sustainable development with full respect for \r\nhuman rights. \r\n Numerous initiatives are currently under way in \r\nthat regard, and we welcome them. Nevertheless, we \r\nalso believe that there is merit in conducting a more \r\nstructured and inclusive dialogue among all \r\nstakeholders. We therefore call on the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to present, by the end of April 2010, a \r\nforward-looking report with specific recommendations \r\nto the General Assembly that would serve as the basis \r\nfor the review process. The report could, for example, \r\ntake stock of the challenges identified in the 2004 \r\nreport of the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges \r\nand Change (A/59/565) and identify new challenges. It \r\n A/64/PV.49\r\n \r\n23 09-61513 \r\n \r\ncould also highlight the complementarity of efforts \r\ntowards mediation, conflict prevention, peacebuilding \r\nand peacekeeping, and operational activities for \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n In addition, it could reflect on the relevant reform \r\nprocesses now under way with a view to linking these \r\nareas more strategically to ensure that the contributions \r\nof the entire United Nations system, including the \r\nBretton Woods institutions, will be more effective as \r\npart of the efforts to achieve sustainable peace. Finally, \r\nit could also make specific recommendations on the \r\nbasis of a comprehensive review of the work of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, including its country-\r\nspecific meetings. Such a report by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral would provide a sound foundation for adopting \r\na new consensus on the Peacebuilding Commission at \r\nthe highest political level on the occasion of the high-\r\nlevel meeting in September 2010. \r\n One or two high-level political figures could, \r\nfollowing the model established by the Prodi report \r\n(see A/63/666) on the relationship between the United \r\nNations and the African Union, give stature and \r\nauthority to this kind of response and thus help to \r\norient our debates. \r\n Mr. Ney (Germany): Let me start by thanking \r\nAmbassador Muñoz for his leadership as the Chair of \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission (PBC), and the Swedish \r\nEuropean Union presidency for its statement on behalf \r\nof the European Union. We concur with and support \r\neverything that was said by Ambassador Lidén. \r\n Germany supported the setting up of the PBC \r\nsince the very beginning. The PBC is an important part \r\nof United Nations peacebuilding architecture, which is \r\nand remains of high relevance. The PBC has so far \r\nachieved encouraging results in the countries on its \r\nagenda, in particular in Sierra Leone and Burundi, \r\nwhere its work is already advanced. \r\n At the end of the day, the PBC’s success in the \r\ncountries on its agenda will be measured alongside its \r\ncapability to achieve tangible and sustainable results \r\nfor the people on the ground. This is the essence of my \r\npersonal experience from the time when I served as the \r\nSenior Deputy High Representative in Bosnia. If the \r\npeople on the ground do not see and feel an \r\nimprovement in their everyday lives, we will lose them \r\nin the process of post-conflict peacebuilding.  \r\n The upcoming 2010 review process will provide \r\nan excellent opportunity to identify ways and means to \r\nenhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the PBC’s \r\nwork. For the 2010 review, we view the following \r\nseven points as the most important to improve our \r\ncommon peacebuilding efforts and the work of the \r\nPBC.  \r\n First, the PBC has to fulfil its role as the platform \r\nfor strategic policy coordination for international \r\nengagement in post-conflict countries among key \r\ninternational actors.  \r\n Secondly, the PBC should play the central role  \r\nin creating cohesion among political, security, \r\ndevelopment and humanitarian actors.  \r\n Thirdly, the PBC should become a framework for \r\nmutual accountability. Governments and the \r\ninternational community should be held accountable to \r\nagreed commitments. Donors should orient their \r\nactivities along the priorities identified by the PBC in \r\ncooperation with the host country and fulfil the \r\ncommitments undertaken by the PBC. \r\n Fourthly, we should achieve a more structured \r\nrelationship between the Security Council and the \r\nPBC, including increased interaction. We should try to \r\nmake better use of synergies between peacekeeping \r\nand peacebuilding.  \r\n Fifthly, the analysis of a specific situation by the \r\nPBC should result in the identification of a clear set of \r\na limited number of priorities and the direction of \r\nresources for their implementation. \r\n Sixthly, best practices, relevant knowledge and \r\nlessons learned within country-specific meetings, as \r\nwell as in the wider United Nations system and \r\nbeyond, need to be cross-fertilized. In this regard, the \r\nrole of the Peacebuilding Support Office in bringing \r\nthe United Nations system together, convening \r\nexpertise and providing solid input to PBC \r\ndeliberations should be strengthened. \r\n Finally, the coordinating role of the United \r\nNations on the ground still needs to be strengthened. \r\nStrengthening the One United Nations concept would \r\nbe a step towards better coherence of the \r\nOrganization’s activities and might also facilitate \r\ncoordination among donors. \r\n Ms. Rovirosa (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): My \r\ndelegation warmly welcomes the opportunity for this \r\nA/64/PV.49  \r\n \r\n09-61513 24 \r\n \r\nAssembly to jointly consider the report of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission on its third session \r\n(A/64/341), pursuant to resolution 60/180, and the \r\nreport of the Secretary-General on the Peacebuilding \r\nFund (A/64/217). Mexico acknowledges the efforts of \r\nthe Chairperson of the Commission, Ambassador \r\nHeraldo Muñoz of Chile, for his promotional efforts, \r\nundertaken in fulfilling his mandate, to raise awareness \r\nand bring visibility to the work of the Commission. We \r\nalso commend the work of Ambassador Yukio Takasu \r\nof Japan and the progress achieved by the Commission \r\nduring his chairmanship. \r\n My delegation also wishes to praise the work of \r\nthe Chairs of the country-specific configurations for \r\nBurundi, Guinea-Bissau, the Central African Republic \r\nand Sierra Leone. Their dedication and leadership have \r\nhelped the national authorities of the countries on the \r\nCommission’s agenda to make progress in setting up \r\nand implementing programmes and strategies for \r\nsecurity, disarmament, demobilization and \r\nreintegration.  \r\n One of the great merits of the country-specific \r\nconfigurations and their Chairs is their use of \r\ninnovative working methods, including field visits and \r\nvideo conferences with national authorities, making it \r\npossible to obtain first-hand information on the \r\ndevelopment of national societies in various areas. We \r\nalso welcome the coordinated meetings of the Working \r\nGroup on Lessons Learned on matters related to issues \r\ncritical to recovery. \r\n Mexico welcomes the Commission’s progress in \r\nimplementing and consolidating its mandate in its three \r\nyears of existence as an advisory body supporting the \r\ncountries on its agenda, as well as in contributing to \r\nformulating various peace strategies. Its work in \r\nmobilizing resources is also one of its most laudable \r\naspects. It has demonstrated the importance of \r\ninvolving the private sector and civil society in \r\ngathering and mobilizing resources, a contribution that \r\nis not limited to the financial area but also \r\nencompasses human capital — a powerful complement \r\nto the efforts of Governments at the local, regional and \r\ninternational levels, and of the United Nations system \r\nitself. \r\n My delegation appreciates the efforts of the Chair \r\nof the Commission to encourage and strengthen \r\nrelations with non-traditional donors and to forge \r\ncloser links with the international financial institutions \r\nand regional and subregional entities, particularly in \r\nlight of the challenges created by the world economic \r\ncrisis, in a broader framework linking security and \r\ndevelopment in the transition from conflict to peace. \r\n Next year will see the review of the mandates set \r\nforth in the Commission’s founding resolutions, with a \r\nfocus on its nature and the definition of its programme. \r\nMy delegation is firmly determined to participate \r\nactively in the consultation process, which we trust \r\nwill be flexible, inclusive, transparent and integrative. \r\nThis is an ideal time to begin considering how to \r\nimprove the Commission’s working methods. Such an \r\nexercise should be conducted in the framework of a \r\nconsultative and inclusive process. \r\n My delegation wishes to stress that it is vital, in \r\ndrawing up the various peace strategies in which the \r\nCommission participates, to take into account the \r\nexternal factors that may determine the success or \r\nfailure of the peacebuilding process in a given country, \r\nsince they may either originate in an area outside that \r\ncountry or have a purpose or benefit that extends \r\nbeyond it. A specific example of this situation is the \r\nexploitation by organized crime and drug traffickers of \r\ncountries where peacebuilding is taking place. \r\n Furthermore, we must recall that responsibility is \r\nto be shared by all national, regional or international \r\nactors, not only by those directly involved in the \r\nreconstruction process. Hence, there must be a \r\ncollective commitment to halting or controlling the \r\nillegal trade in arms and munitions that reach countries \r\nin the delicate stage of transition from a situation of \r\nwar to one of peacebuilding. \r\n With regard to the Peacebuilding Fund, Mexico \r\nwelcomes the Secretary-General’s intention, reflected \r\nin his report (A/64/217), to take measures to strengthen \r\nthe catalytic nature of the Fund and to ensure that it \r\nprovides financing at the right time. With the recent \r\nreview and evaluation of the terms of reference for the \r\nuse of the Fund’s resources, Mexico hopes that the \r\nFund will be more flexible, efficient and effective in \r\ntackling its two key objectives of identifying and \r\nfinancing in a timely manner the most immediate needs \r\nof post-conflict societies, and channelling that \r\nfinancing to the countries it supports in a more \r\nsustainable fashion. In this context, Mexico hopes that \r\nthe Commission will play a prominent role in the \r\nstrategic direction and application of the Fund’s \r\nresources. We also appreciate the exercise in \r\n A/64/PV.49\r\n \r\n25 09-61513 \r\n \r\ntransparency regularly demonstrated by the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission Support Office through its \r\nformal meetings held to present information to donors \r\non the Fund’s financial situation and performance. \r\n It is vitally important that the Fund count on the \r\nresources it needs to comply with its mandate. My \r\ncountry has supported the Fund for the past two years, \r\nand will make a third contribution for 2009-2010. My \r\ndelegation also hopes that, in the first quarter of 2010, \r\nthe cooperation programmes that Mexico has offered \r\nGuinea-Bissau and Burundi in the areas of electoral \r\nprocess, the fight against drug trafficking and \r\neconomic development will be implemented. \r\n The international community continues to have \r\nvery high expectations for the work of the \r\nCommission. The coming year will be crucial for \r\ncementing the scope and potential of this body. We will \r\nwork together to give the peacebuilding architecture \r\nthe necessary tools to make the difference between the \r\nchaos unleashed by war and the stability offered by \r\npeaceful societies. \r\n Mr. Çorman (Turkey): At the outset, I should \r\nlike to express our gratitude to the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly for his able leadership in guiding \r\nour discussions on issues related to international peace \r\nand security, one of which is the basis for our \r\ndeliberations today.  \r\n We have examined the report of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission (A/64/341) and the report \r\nof the Secretary-General on the Peacebuilding Fund \r\n(A/64/217), the two main instruments set up by the \r\nAssembly pursuant to the call by the Security Council \r\nto respond to the challenges and complexities of post-\r\nconflict situations. We have noted with interest the \r\nconclusions and recommendations contained in these \r\nreports. \r\n Since the Assembly established the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission (PBC) when it adopted resolution 60/180 \r\nin December 2005, we have noted with pleasure that \r\nthe Commission has consolidated its core advisory role \r\nand demonstrated increasing support for the post-\r\nconflict countries on its agenda by helping channel \r\nresources to critical peacebuilding priorities and \r\nsupporting the strengthening of national capacities. It \r\ncan be briefly stated that, though it is a relatively new \r\ninstrument, the Commission is playing an essential role \r\nin the promotion of the goals inherent in its mandate. \r\n On the other hand, the Peacebuilding Fund — the \r\nlargest multi-donor trust fund under the administration \r\nof the United Nations, with 47 donor countries \r\ncontributing to its work and pledges totalling more \r\nthan $310 million — continues to stand as an \r\nindispensable instrument for ensuring the immediate \r\nrelease of resources needed to launch peacebuilding \r\nactivities and for the provision of appropriate financing \r\nfor recovery, despite the financial constraints it faces.  \r\n In this respect, it would not be wrong to define \r\nthe progress achieved over the past four years of the \r\nCommission’s and Fund’s operations as positive and \r\npromising. Yet, the increased complexity of the post-\r\nconflict reconstruction process, the evolving \r\napproaches to critical peacebuilding priorities and the \r\nneed to adapt to prevailing global realities call for the \r\ncontinuous review of these two instruments and the re-\r\nevaluation of their means of operation on the basis of \r\nlessons learned. \r\n With this in mind, we are pleased to see that the \r\nCommission has already engaged in a process of \r\ndiscussions on how to improve its work, maximize its \r\nimpact and mobilize sustained international attention. \r\nWe are also pleased that the new terms of reference are \r\nin place for the Peacebuilding Fund. We believe that \r\nthese ongoing processes will be further advanced by \r\nthe 2010 review of the Commission’s founding \r\nresolutions, and we look forward to the \r\nrecommendations on how its role can be further \r\nenhanced. \r\n Peacebuilding, though embedded in the principle \r\nof national ownership, is mainly a collective effort \r\nundertaken by many actors and comprising many \r\naspects of peace efforts, including conflict prevention, \r\npeacemaking, peacekeeping, humanitarian aid and \r\ndevelopment assistance. Indeed, as is often mentioned, \r\nthe challenge is as much about winning the peace as \r\nstopping the war. \r\n There are many challenging areas in which the \r\nresponses should be as multifaceted as the problems \r\nthemselves, from supporting political processes and \r\nreconciliation to creating safety and security; from \r\nenshrining the rule of law to providing basic services, \r\nsuch as water, health and education, and revitalizing \r\neconomies destroyed by war. Nevertheless, the success \r\nof these responses depends on the manner in which \r\nthey are applied, since such a broad agenda inevitably \r\nA/64/PV.49  \r\n \r\n09-61513 26 \r\n \r\nrequires a coherent, coordinated and integrated effort \r\nfrom the international community.  \r\n There is no doubt that, if a peacebuilding project \r\nis to be successful, various stakeholders from the \r\ninternational community should act in unison with a \r\nview to empowering the post-conflict country and its \r\ncitizens to start rebuilding both the structures of their \r\nState and their lives. The United Nations and the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission — as the institutional \r\nlinchpin of the United Nations peacebuilding \r\narchitecture, together with the two other pillars, the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund and the Peacebuilding Support \r\nOffice — undoubtedly have a significant role to play in \r\nthis regard. \r\n The efficient functioning of the United Nations \r\npeacebuilding architecture rests on its ability to deliver \r\nas one the common vision based on an agreed strategy \r\nthat is well supported by financial resources and \r\ntechnical expertise and matches the needs of the \r\ncountry. In this belief, we agree with the five-point \r\nagenda set out by the Secretary-General to facilitate an \r\nearlier and more coherent response from the United \r\nNations and the wider international community, which \r\nreflects these core elements. \r\n I should like to underline a few points that we \r\ndeem important elements to be taken into consideration \r\nduring the 2010 review of the work of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission.  \r\n First, we believe that priority should be given to \r\nthe issue of building national institutions with a view \r\nto strengthening the national ownership of the \r\npeacebuilding process. In this framework, the focus \r\nshould be on the identification and reinforcement of \r\nexisting local capacities and on the transfer of \r\nexpertise rather than dependence upon it. To this end, \r\nin collaboration with the national authorities and \r\ninternational actors, a system ought to be built for \r\ndeploying “blue suits” and not only Blue Helmets. \r\n Secondly, the transition from peacekeeping to \r\npeacebuilding is an area that deserves greater attention. \r\nAs was also pointed out in the thematic debate held \r\nduring Turkey’s presidency of the Security Council in \r\nJune 2009, peacekeeping and peacebuilding are \r\nintegral parts of a whole and success can come only if \r\nwe treat them as such. The first two years after the end \r\nof a conflict are the most critical period, when we can \r\nsow the seeds of a lasting peace. \r\n Thirdly, the gender perspective should be an \r\ninseparable element of the work of the Commission. \r\nThe existing mandate of the PBC entrusts the \r\nCommission with integrating a gender perspective into \r\nall its work. The important role of women in the \r\nprevention and resolution of conflicts and the need for \r\ntheir full involvement in all efforts to maintain and \r\npromote peace and security, as well as in decision-\r\nmaking processes, should continue to be stressed \r\nwithin the work of the Commission. \r\n Fourthly, the harmonization of policies and \r\nprocedures to deliver as one should be reinforced. As \r\nMember States, we should encourage United Nations \r\nentities to implement system-wide coherence in post-\r\nconflict settings. In this regard, the capacity of the \r\nPeacebuilding Support Office should be strengthened \r\nin order to make it integral to United Nations efforts to \r\npromote a more integrated and strategic response in \r\npost-conflict countries. \r\n Last but not least, we believe that the financing \r\nmechanism in support of peacebuilding efforts should \r\nbe made more predictable, sustainable, transparent, \r\naccountable and flexible. We should explore creative \r\nways to provide budget support in post-conflict settings \r\non the basis of the needs of the country in question and \r\nlook for ways to maximize the Peacebuilding Fund’s \r\nimpact, including by setting up new partnerships or \r\nextending existing ones.  \r\n Turkey stands fully behind its commitments to \r\nthe Fund and makes its contributions to it without \r\ncaveat. The Fund has the potential to fill a unique \r\npeacebuilding niche in the post-conflict arena, and we \r\nhope that the revised terms of reference will allow the \r\nFund to improve its efficiency, responsiveness and \r\neffectiveness in order to ensure that post-conflict \r\ncountries benefit from the sustained attention and \r\nsupport of the international community. \r\n The momentum the Commission has gathered in \r\nterms of advancing the peacebuilding agenda within \r\nthe United Nations and its success in promoting a \r\nconvergence of views among the Member States \r\nconstitute its most important added value. We believe \r\nthat the upcoming mandate review, which will draw \r\nupon lessons learned in previous years, will be useful \r\nin charting the course for the future work of the \r\nCommission. \r\n Turkey is ready to share with the members of the \r\nCommission and the Secretariat the vast experiences it \r\n A/64/PV.49\r\n \r\n27 09-61513 \r\n \r\nhas gained through its active involvement in and \r\nsupport of the recovery efforts of various post-conflict \r\ncountries, from the Balkans to the Middle East and \r\nfrom Afghanistan to Africa, and is committed to \r\ncontinuing its support for the enhancement of United \r\nNations peacebuilding efforts in every possible way. \r\n Mr. Husain (Canada) (spoke in French): Today’s \r\ndebate on the Peacebuilding Commission (PBC) and \r\nthe Peacebuilding Fund is an important opportunity to \r\nreflect on the incremental successes of the United \r\nNations peacebuilding architecture and to consider \r\nwhat improvements can be made as we embark on the \r\n2010 PCB review process. For Canada, the \r\nfundamental rationale behind the creation of this \r\narchitecture remains clear. The United Nations needs a \r\nbody mandated to work in partnership with post-\r\nconflict countries to help them to bridge the security \r\nand development aspects of peacebuilding with a view \r\nto building durable peace. \r\n As the Peacebuilding Commission’s annual report \r\n(A/64/341) attests, important progress has been made. \r\nThe Commission has made significant improvements in \r\nsuch key areas as delivering strategic peacebuilding \r\nadvice, developing adaptable and efficient working \r\nmethods, and raising public awareness. The \r\nCommission played an important role in the \r\ndevelopment of the Secretary-General’s report on \r\npeacebuilding in the immediate aftermath of conflict \r\n(A/63/881), notably by underlining that peacebuilding \r\nis a fundamentally political activity that requires a \r\ncareful integration of efforts in the spheres of \r\nmediation, peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance, \r\nearly recovery and development.  \r\n Significantly, the PBC is interacting more and \r\nmore frequently with external actors, including the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the \r\nAfrican Union, the Economic Community of West \r\nAfrican States, the Organization of American States, \r\nthe private sector and civil society. Canada welcomes \r\nthese developments, which underscore the \r\nCommission’s growing impact. \r\n Recent strides towards streamlining the \r\nstrategies, procedures and working methods of the \r\nCommission are particularly promising. To cite one \r\nexample, the Sierra Leone configuration under \r\nCanadian chairmanship decided to align its \r\nengagement with the Government of Sierra Leone’s \r\nnew national strategy, the Agenda for Change. At the \r\nHigh-level Special Session in June, the configuration \r\nformally adopted a short outcome document \r\n(PBC/3/SLE/6) in which it committed itself to focusing \r\non three key threats to peacebuilding identified in the \r\nAgenda for Change and endorsed in the \r\ncomplementary United Nations joint vision for Sierra \r\nLeone. This step reflected the Commission’s \r\nwillingness to adapt its engagement to the context and \r\nrecognized that the needs of post-conflict countries are \r\nnot static. Canada strongly supports this approach. \r\nEmbracing locally produced strategic visions affirms \r\nnational ownership, holds Governments accountable \r\nfor their own commitments, and fulfils the principles of \r\nthe Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and the \r\nAccra Agenda for Action. \r\n Another success over the past year was the \r\nrevision to the terms of reference of the Peacebuilding \r\nFund. The Fund will now be able to better fulfil two \r\nfunctions: providing rapid financing for small, high-\r\nimpact projects in direct support of early recovery, and \r\nproviding funding to larger, more complex programmes \r\nthat support peacebuilding in areas not covered by \r\nother donors. The Fund must continue to do better to \r\nalign each project with a sound strategic vision and \r\nimprove the quality of project implementation and the \r\nspeed of disbursements. Canada is encouraged by the \r\ndevelopment of new operational guidelines for the \r\nFund in this regard and welcomes the revised strategic \r\ndirection recently articulated by the Assistant \r\nSecretary-General. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n The peacebuilding architecture has come far, yet \r\nmuch more work remains. The forthcoming review \r\nprocess must be inclusive, transparent and focused on \r\nthe practical needs of post-conflict countries. For this \r\nreason, it should begin with a careful stocktaking of the \r\nrecord to date. At this early stage, Canada would \r\npropose three key issues for potential consideration. \r\n First, the PBC must expand its engagement by \r\ngetting involved at an earlier stage of post-conflict \r\nrecovery, as called for in the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport. The Commission needs to consider how it can \r\nbetter support a wider range of post-conflict countries, \r\nwhile continuing meaningful engagement with \r\ncountries presently on its agenda. To do so, the PBC \r\nwill need to adapt its working methods and more \r\nclearly identify the value it adds to existing \r\npeacekeeping efforts. \r\nA/64/PV.49  \r\n \r\n09-61513 28 \r\n \r\n Secondly, the PBC should adopt a multitiered \r\nagenda. This would permit differing levels of \r\nengagement depending on the stage of peace \r\nconsolidation. Not all circumstances will warrant the \r\nintensive involvement that currently takes place with \r\nrespect to strategic frameworks. The Commission’s \r\nrole may be one of monitoring or helping a country \r\nmove from peacebuilding to a sound development \r\nfooting. \r\n Thirdly, the Peacebuilding Commission must \r\nimprove its treatment of thematic issues and integration \r\nof lessons learned. It should be the central United \r\nNations forum for discussing the strategic challenges \r\nand policy dilemmas that peacebuilding presents. This \r\nwill require closer cooperation with the Security \r\nCouncil, the General Assembly and the Economic and \r\nSocial Council, as well as the World Bank, the \r\nInternational Network on Conflict and Fragility of the \r\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and \r\nDevelopment, and others outside United Nations walls. \r\nIt demands a stronger Peacebuilding Support Office \r\n(PBSO), capable of serving as both a centre of \r\nexpertise and a clearinghouse for knowledge. There is \r\nan important role for the PBC and PBSO to play in \r\ncultivating meaningful partnerships between external \r\nand internal peacebuilding actors that is essential to \r\nlong-term sustainability. \r\n The 2010 review comes at a time when the \r\nUnited Nations system is reforming its approach to \r\npeacebuilding and the Peacebuilding Commission must \r\nfollow up on the recommendations outlined in the \r\nSecretary-General’s report on peacebuilding. Canada \r\nlooks forward to the further clarification of roles and \r\nresponsibilities, the development of mutual \r\naccountability measures for senior United Nations \r\nleadership teams, and greater integration of United \r\nNations efforts in the field. We also await with great \r\ninterest the forthcoming report on civilian capacity. \r\n The time is now. The recent report on the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission’s work has shown not only \r\nthe fledgling progress that we have made, but also the \r\npromise that needs to be realized. The 2010 review is \r\nan opportunity to realize the full ambition of the \r\nCommission’s original vision. It is time for the PBC to \r\ntake a hard look at its business methods, build on \r\nsuccesses, maintain its adaptability and prove its \r\nworth. Together, let us craft the mandate and develop \r\nthe tools that can make the Peacebuilding Commission \r\nan effective partner for countries seeking a brighter \r\nfuture. \r\n Mr. Grauls (Belgium) (spoke in French): Since \r\ntheir establishment a few years ago, the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission and the Peacebuilding Fund have \r\nfollowed an interesting and encouraging path. The \r\nreports of the work of those two elements of the United \r\nNations peacebuilding architecture that are before us \r\ntoday (A/64/341 and A/64/217) are proof of that. That \r\ndirection would not have been possible without the \r\nhighly appreciated contribution of the Secretariat and \r\nof many Member States. \r\n Belgium fully aligns itself with the statement \r\nmade by the representative of Sweden on behalf of the \r\nEuropean Union. That statement described the point of \r\ndeparture of the European contribution to the five-year \r\nreview of the United Nations peacebuilding \r\narchitecture. \r\n I would like to make a few brief remarks in my \r\nnational capacity, bearing in mind my experience as \r\nChair of the Central African Republic configuration of \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission. Consideration of the \r\nCommission’s achievements and future with a view to \r\nthe five-year review of the Peacebuilding Commission, \r\nless than a year away, has only just begun. Belgium \r\nintends to become involved in that collective review \r\nprocess on the basis of three guiding principles.  \r\n First, we must draw on the vision that was at the \r\nroot of the Peacebuilding Commission’s establishment \r\nin 2006. That vision was clear: the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission was to become a platform for \r\ncoordinating, channelling and mobilizing international \r\nefforts on behalf of countries emerging from conflict. \r\nWe will make the Peacebuilding Commission an \r\nessential tool for international engagement in post-\r\nconflict situations only if we are all ready to strengthen \r\nour coordination and mobilization efforts. In that \r\nregard, the report of the Secretary-General on \r\npeacebuilding in the immediate aftermath of conflict \r\n(A/63/881) contains very worthwhile \r\nrecommendations, such as the strengthening of high-\r\nlevel United Nations posts on the ground, the rapid \r\ndeployment of civilian capacities and an improved \r\ncoordination role for the Peacebuilding Commission. \r\n Secondly, the Commission’s work evolves and is \r\ndynamic. The Peacebuilding Commission has made \r\ngreat progress since its establishment barely four years \r\nago. In the country-specific configurations, we are \r\n A/64/PV.49\r\n \r\n29 09-61513 \r\n \r\nalmost constantly reviewing our working methods, \r\nseeking to adapt them to the challenges encountered \r\nboth in New York and in the field. We should act \r\nwithout dogmas by adopting a flexible approach and by \r\ntailoring our actions since the reality in the countries \r\non the Commission’s agenda varies greatly. In thinking \r\nabout the direction of our work, let us keep in mind its \r\nevolving nature and take into consideration the lessons \r\nalready drawn from our past experience. In any case, \r\nthat is what we are trying to do within the Central \r\nAfrican Republic configuration, the latest country to \r\nhave been put on the Peacebuilding Commission’s \r\nagenda. \r\n Thirdly, we should see the Commission’s work as \r\npart of a whole, in particular by taking into account the \r\ndevelopments in recent years in the context of other \r\nUnited Nations reforms. I am thinking especially of the \r\nlink between peacebuilding and peacekeeping, two \r\nworlds that to date are still too far apart but that must \r\nbe brought closer together. I am also thinking of \r\nsystem-wide coherence and the One United Nations \r\nconcept, two objectives to which the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission can substantially contribute.  \r\n Lastly, I am thinking of cooperation efforts \r\nbetween the United Nations and regional and \r\nsubregional organizations. Within our Central African \r\nRepublic configuration, we have for example helped to \r\nstrengthen the links among the United Nations \r\nPeacebuilding Support Office in the Central African \r\nRepublic, the United Nations Development Programme \r\n(UNDP), the United Nations Mission in the Central \r\nAfrican Republic and Chad, the Economic Community \r\nof Central African States, the European Union and the \r\nAfrican Union so as to implement both security sector \r\nreform and process of the disarmament, demobilization \r\nand reintegration of ex-rebels, which has now become \r\ntruly urgent. We have also worked closely with the \r\nSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General for \r\nChildren and Armed Conflict and with UNICEF to find \r\nsolutions to the problem of child soldiers. \r\n It is also necessary to consider the formal and \r\ninformal procedures whereby the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission interacts with the Security Council, the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil. The Commission’s advisory role vis-à-vis the \r\nSecurity Council can without doubt be developed \r\nfurther, for example by consulting the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission in the immediate aftermath of a conflict or \r\nwhen the Security Council is preparing documents \r\nrelating to countries on the Commission’s agenda. \r\nBelgium also calls for strengthening the relationship \r\nbetween the Peacebuilding Commission and the \r\nGeneral Assembly, for example by organizing a second \r\nannual debate on peacebuilding in this forum in \r\naddition to the debate on the annual report. \r\n At our five-year review, we must consider the \r\ndevelopments beyond the United Nations system, with \r\na view to improving the dialogue between fragile \r\nStates and the international community, such as \r\nthrough South-South cooperation and the \r\nimplementation of the Paris Principles. In that regard, I \r\nwish to stress that the Central African Republic \r\nconfiguration works extremely well with the European \r\nCommission, the World Bank and UNDP. \r\n Lastly, I wish to say a word about the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund. My delegation notes with \r\nsatisfaction the efforts of the Secretariat, in particular \r\nof the new Assistant Secretary-General, Ms. Cheng-\r\nHopkins, seeking to make the Fund an instrument that \r\ncan act more rapidly and more as a catalyst. In fact, \r\nthose are the characteristics that will enable the Fund \r\nto stand out.  It is necessary to continue to improve \r\nthe synergies between the Peacebuilding Fund and the \r\nefforts of bilateral partners and of other funds in the \r\nrecipient countries, as well as with the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission. However, overall, Belgium believes that \r\nthe revisions and the adjustments that the Fund has \r\nmade this past year are promising. \r\n For my part and speaking in my capacity as \r\nPermanent Representative of Belgium, I wish to \r\nreiterate here that Belgium will continue its active and \r\nresolute commitment in support of peacebuilding, \r\nincluding through its various contributions to the \r\nUnited Nations peacebuilding architecture. \r\n The Acting President: In accordance with \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 57/32 of 19 November \r\n2002, I now call on His Excellency Mr. Theo-Ben \r\nGurirab, President of the Inter-Parliamentary Union \r\nand President of the General Assembly at its fifty-\r\nfourth session.  \r\n Mr. Gurirab (Inter-Parliamentary Union): I \r\nwould be remiss if, on this happy occasion, I did not \r\nconvey to my dear brother the President of the General \r\nAssembly how very pleased I was to see him \r\noccupying the post that I once occupied, at the turn of \r\nthe century. The Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) is at \r\nA/64/PV.49  \r\n \r\n09-61513 30 \r\n \r\nhis service and will offer all the help it can. I wish him \r\nwell. \r\n I am pleased to be back in this Hall and to \r\naddress the Assembly on behalf of the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union as it reviews the work of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission. The promotion of peace \r\nlies at the heart of the mandate of the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union. Our organization is founded on \r\nthe notion that parliaments and their members have an \r\nessential contribution to make in building peace and \r\nsocial stability. It is in parliament that the competing \r\nand sometimes conflicting interests in society are \r\ndebated. It is there that agreements are forged on \r\npublic policy and national priorities. A fully \r\nrepresentative parliament that has the requisite powers \r\nto legislate and hold Government to account is, in \r\nmany ways, the best antidote to conflict. \r\n As a melting pot of the diverse components of \r\nsociety, parliament has a determining role to play in the \r\nprocess of national reconciliation, political tolerance \r\nand peacebuilding in the aftermath of conflict. Despite \r\nthe undeniable progress made over the past couple of \r\ndecades, many parliaments in developing countries, \r\nand those in post-conflict countries in particular, \r\ncontinue to face daunting challenges. Their capacities \r\nand resources are far too limited to enable them to \r\nfunction effectively and to promote democracy. \r\n In the IPU, we are working to assist these \r\nparliaments by giving them sustained and practical \r\nsupport and thereby promote their long-term \r\ndevelopment into more credible institutions — \r\ninstitutions that can help build consensus and serve as \r\na platform for open and frank debate, which can also \r\ncontribute to healing the scars of conflict and averting \r\nthe danger of a return to instability and discord.  \r\n We are working closely with the United Nations \r\nin the field of conflict resolution. We have a shared \r\ninterest in seeing vibrant parliaments take root. They \r\nare essential to achieving the local ownership that is \r\ncritical to the success of international operations in \r\npost-conflict societies. \r\n I am pleased that the Peacebuilding Commission \r\nis paying increasing attention to the needs of \r\nparliaments in embattled countries where it is working. \r\nI warmly welcome the growing cooperation between \r\nthe IPU and the Peacebuilding Commission. \r\n In our experience, in order for parliaments in \r\ncountries emerging from conflict to function \r\neffectively, dialogue is absolutely indispensable. This \r\nholds true for majority and opposition parties alike: it \r\nis necessary for them to be able to work together. In \r\nthis way, they will be able to form a common vision \r\nbased on shared confidence and mutual respect. For \r\nthis reason, the IPU is engaged in a long-term effort to \r\nhelp the parliament in Burundi create a framework for \r\nongoing dialogue, consensus-building and inclusive \r\ndecision-making. \r\n Similarly, we are helping the parliament of Sierra \r\nLeone to play a robust role in the process of national \r\nreconciliation and forging a new beginning. Currently, \r\nwe are assisting in the development of a code \r\nregulating the opposition in parliament and \r\nencouraging parliamentarians on both sides of the \r\npolitical divide to work together for the common good. \r\n In Kenya, we are working with the parliament to \r\nensure that it is at the forefront of efforts being made to \r\nensure long-term stability and development in that \r\ncountry. We have facilitated the finalization by \r\nparliament of an action plan to implement the overall \r\npolitical agreement. Furthermore, we are now \r\naccompanying the parliament as it implements all \r\nstages of the plan. \r\n Moreover, we are in discussions with the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and the parliament in the \r\nCentral African Republic. Early next year, we will \r\nconduct a mission to that country in the context of a \r\nPeacebuilding Commission mission with a view to \r\nassessing the parliament’s needs and devising a \r\nstrategy for supporting its long-term development and \r\nconsolidation efforts. \r\n As we debate how best to bring peace and \r\nstability to countries affected by conflict, we must \r\nremember that this cannot be achieved without \r\ngoodwill and reconciliation, and that such efforts must \r\nbe a home-grown affair in all respects. This process \r\nrequires the participation of all parties, and that \r\nnecessarily means the participation of parliament. \r\n I should therefore like to conclude by urging all \r\nmembers of the Assembly to give their full support to \r\nthe parliaments in those countries — to respect their \r\nsovereignty while giving them the means to become \r\ntruly representative, transparent, accountable, \r\naccessible and effective institutions. That is one of the \r\nmost vital investments the international community can \r\n A/64/PV.49\r\n \r\n31 09-61513 \r\n \r\nmake in building peace and reconstruction. This is one \r\nof the important contributions we in the IPU are \r\nmaking to peace and development in a growing number \r\nof countries, and I urge the Assembly to join us in this \r\nexercise in building a better common future. \r\n \r\nProgramme of work \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I should like to consult \r\nmembers regarding an extension for the work of the \r\nSecond Committee. Members will recall that at its 2nd \r\nplenary meeting, on 18 September 2009, the General \r\nAssembly approved the recommendation of the \r\nGeneral Committee that the Second Committee would \r\ncomplete its work by Tuesday, 24 November 2009. \r\nHowever, I have been informed by the Chairperson of \r\nthe Second Committee that, due to ongoing \r\nnegotiations, the Chairperson would like to request an \r\nextension of the Committee’s work until Friday,  \r\n \r\n4 December 2009. May I therefore take it that the \r\nGeneral Assembly agrees to extend the work of the \r\nSecond Committee until Friday, 4 December 2009? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The Acting President: I would like now to make \r\nan announcement concerning changes in the schedule \r\nof the work of the Assembly. First, members are \r\nadvised that consideration of agenda item 114, \r\n“Follow-up to the outcome of the Millennium \r\nSummit”, and specific meetings focused on \r\ndevelopment, scheduled for Wednesday, 25 November \r\n2009, as well as consideration of agenda item 14, \r\nentitled “Protracted conflicts in the GUAM area and \r\ntheir implications for international peace, security and \r\ndevelopment”, and agenda item 18, entitled “The \r\nsituation in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan”, \r\nscheduled for Thursday, 3 December 2009, are \r\npostponed to a later date to be announced. \r\nThe meeting rose at 1.20 p.m. \r\n"
