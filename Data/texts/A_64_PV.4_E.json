(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.40 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAddress by Mrs. Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, \r\nPresident of the Argentine Republic \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Argentine Republic. \r\n  Mrs. Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, President of \r\nthe Argentine Republic, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations Her Excellency Mrs. Cristina Fernández de \r\nKirchner, President of the Argentine Republic, and to \r\ninvite her to address the Assembly. \r\n President Fernández de Kirchner (spoke in \r\nSpanish): I must confess that, when I arrived in this \r\ncity to participate in this session of the General \r\nAssembly, I had intended to begin my statement with a \r\nstrong appeal on the need to rebuild multilateralism \r\nand cooperation as the two basic instruments to \r\novercome what today is undoubtedly the central issue \r\nin our global discussion, namely, overcoming the social \r\nand economic crisis. \r\n  Mr. Berdymukhammedov (Turkmenistan), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n However, certain events on Monday and Tuesday \r\noblige me to begin my statement by reporting that the \r\nEmbassy of the Argentine Republic in Tegucigalpa, \r\nRepublic of Honduras, had its electricity cut off some \r\ntwo days ago. That, of course, was not because we had \r\nnot paid the bill, but was for far more serious reasons.  \r\n Next to the Argentine Embassy is a television \r\nstudio which broadcast the news of President Zelaya’s \r\narrival in Honduras, the repression and the \r\ndemonstrations in favour of the return of democracy. \r\nThat was one of the reasons. In any event, we have had \r\nbetter luck than the Embassy of the sister Republic of \r\nBrazil, where, at an early stage they cut off not only \r\nthe electricity but the water as well — for having given \r\nshelter to the constitutional President, Manuel Zelaya. \r\n As a Latin American, I must recall that not even \r\nin Chile during the dictatorship of General Pinochet, or \r\nin Argentina during the dictatorship of General Jorge \r\nRafael Videla — perhaps the two cruelest dictatorships \r\nin Latin America — was there similar behaviour \r\nagainst embassies that were actively working to give \r\nshelter to refugees. \r\n I say this because it is crucial that we realize that \r\nwe must design and forge a multilateral strategy which \r\nis strong and specific to return democracy to Honduras. \r\nWe need a strategy which would actually allow for true \r\nrespect for human rights and ensure free and \r\ndemocratic elections — which can take place only with \r\nfull respect for the constitution. If we do not do this, \r\nwe would be setting a harsh precedent in a region \r\nwhere, for decades during the national security \r\ndoctrine, suspensions of democracy claimed the lives \r\nof thousands and thousands of Latin Americans, led to \r\nthe exile of many other and created the region’s most \r\nserious economic and social tragedy in memory. \r\nA/64/PV.4  \r\n \r\n09-52228 2 \r\n \r\n I make this appeal because I played an active role \r\nfrom the platform of the Organization of American \r\nStates, and also accompanied the former President of \r\nthe General Assembly, Father Miguel d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann, to El Salvador in order to carry out a task \r\nwhich would safeguard two basic values which, in my \r\nopinion, our region has managed to develop: \r\ndemocracy and respect for human rights. \r\n Therefore, I believe that multilateralism would \r\nalso mean understanding that we have to set common \r\nand general rules in this globalized world that must be \r\naccepted by all countries. In this case, we are faced \r\nwith a cynical media coup which was carefully hidden \r\nor minimized because, in fact, it was slanted against \r\nthe advent of populist progressive Governments in the \r\nregion. I believe that, for all of us, defining \r\nmultilateralism is going to require specific actions and \r\nrules so that absolutely all of us will have the same \r\nparameters when it comes time to judge conduct, \r\nattitudes and institutional situations. \r\n Yesterday I took part in the climate change event \r\nconvened by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in order \r\nto bring positions closer together with a view to the \r\nCopenhagen Conference, which will take place in a \r\nlittle more than 10 weeks’ time. A decade and a half \r\nago we agreed on the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change, dealing with \r\nenvironmental protection, and we later adopted the \r\nKyoto Protocol in order to begin ensuring respect for \r\nthose obligations undertaken by nations. A decade and \r\na half later, it is clear that neither agreement is being \r\nsatisfactorily implemented. \r\n Essentially, this is sometimes because the nations \r\nmost responsible for pollution and gas emissions, \r\nwhich should bear greater responsibility for reducing \r\nthose emissions, in terms of investments both in their \r\nown countries and in developing countries, cannot \r\ncome to an agreement either. As I was saying yesterday \r\nin our meeting, I think we need to understand that the \r\nonly possibility of successfully approaching \r\nglobalization lies precisely in the setting of common \r\nrules which would be respected by all nations, \r\ndeveloped and developing. \r\n In this framework, we should mention the \r\nsituation of the Argentine Republic, where we still \r\nhave a colonial enclave, our Malvinas Islands, which \r\npersists without the possibility of addressing the \r\nquestion of sovereignty together with the United \r\nKingdom, as proclaimed in many General Assembly \r\nresolutions. We were recently able to agree, following \r\na humanitarian request, that family members with \r\nloved ones buried on the islands should be able to \r\ntravel there by air to inaugurate a cenotaph to pay \r\ntribute to those who fought for their homeland. \r\n All of this points to the very clear need to look at \r\nmultilateralism not only as a type of rhetorical \r\nstatement repeated every year in this or other \r\nmultilateral forums, but rather in terms of concrete \r\nresults. Otherwise, it will become increasingly \r\ncomplicated, with ever more unresolved problems. For, \r\nin the final analysis, the multilateralism we have been \r\npersistently proclaiming since 2003 has not been put \r\ninto practice. \r\n My country and the United States are the only \r\ntwo countries to have experienced attacks of \r\ninternational terrorism. For Argentina, the first was in \r\n1992, at the Embassy of Israel, and the second was at \r\nthe Asociación Mutual Israelita Argentina (AMIA). \r\nHundreds of people died in those attacks. Today, in this \r\nAssembly, I am joined by the head of AMIA, the entity \r\nthat was bombed, as well as by family members who \r\nhave accompanied him. \r\n In 2007, then-President Néstor Kirchner came \r\nhere to the Assembly (see A/62/PV.5) to call on the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran to agree to extradite officials \r\nof its country wanted by the Argentine justice system \r\nin order to carry out a proper investigation and assign \r\nresponsibility for that serious attack. Last year, I \r\nmyself came here (see A/63/PV.5) to call once again on \r\nthe authorities of the Islamic Republic of Iran to \r\naccede to our request. I said that there were \r\nconstitutional guarantees in my country; that the \r\nprinciple that no one is guilty until proven guilty \r\nbeyond a shadow of a doubt prevails from one end of \r\nmy country to the other; and that we have guarantees \r\nfor freedom and the administration of justice. \r\nNevertheless, that did not happen. Instead, this year, \r\none of the officials whose extradition was sought by \r\nthe prosecutor on the case was promoted to minister.  \r\n I know that some 4, 5 or 15 speakers from now \r\nthe President of the Islamic Republic of Iran will take \r\nthe floor. Surely, he will once again deny tragedies that \r\noccurred in the course of western history in the \r\ntwentieth century. He will surely invoke the threat of \r\nother imperialisms. And he will also surely invoke \r\nGod. I would like to say to him that my country, the \r\n A/64/PV.4\r\n \r\n3 09-52228 \r\n \r\nArgentine Republic, is not an imperialist country — \r\nneither by way of belief nor as a reflection of our \r\nhistory. To the contrary, ours is a country that suffered \r\nfrom colonial oppression at its founding. During the \r\nworld’s bipolar era, we also suffered from the doctrine \r\nof national security. I would like to tell him that, like \r\nhim, I believe in God. We may do so in different faiths \r\nbut, in the end, I believe that neither of us believes that \r\nGod could command us to prefer threats or to avoid \r\njustice from being done. \r\n As President of the Argentine Republic, therefore, \r\nI humbly reiterate once again our appeal for the \r\nextradition of the officials whom Argentina’s justice \r\nsystem believes are responsible — not to be found \r\nguilty, but to be judged and to be allowed to take \r\nadvantage of all the rights and guarantees that every \r\nArgentine citizen and foreigner has in our country: \r\nguarantees under democracy, whose unconditional \r\ndefence Argentina has made part of its institutional and \r\nhistorical core. \r\n I would not wish to conclude without referring to \r\nthree events that I believe are very positive, which I \r\nwould like to share with the members of the Assembly \r\ntoday. The first took place quite recently, on \r\n9 September, when the Argentine Republic received a \r\nvisit from the Inter-American Commission on Human \r\nRights, including its Chair and the President of the \r\nInter-American Court of Human Rights. That visit \r\noccurred 30 years after the Court’s first visit, during \r\nthe dictatorship, when it came to investigate the crimes \r\nthat were being committed and to take complaints from \r\nArgentine citizens — including our Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs, who is with me today and who, like \r\nhis father, was imprisoned at that time — and to hear \r\ntestimony about the serious violations that were taking \r\nplace. \r\n Thirty years later, the men who comprised the \r\nCommission and the men and women who are its \r\nmembers today visited an Argentina where criminals \r\nresponsible for genocide under the dictatorship are \r\nbeing tried by judges in accordance with the \r\nConstitution. We have also reached an agreement with \r\nthe Inter-American Court to send a bill to our \r\nlegislature — which I have already done — to \r\neliminate the crime of libel and defamation against \r\njournalists. That is homage to the freedom of \r\nexpression and of the press. But I also firmly believe \r\nthat it should apply to all citizens. It is offensive that, \r\nin the twenty-first century, someone could be sentenced \r\nto prison for having said something and said it freely. \r\n We have also reached an agreement to send up \r\ntwo bills — which we have also already done — to \r\ncontribute to the recovery of children born in captivity \r\nduring the dictatorship. Those will include provisions \r\nto ensure respect for the victims, as well as on society’s \r\ncollective right to learn their identities. \r\n The second thing that I would like to share has to \r\ndo with the fact that I listened today to the President of \r\nthe United States speak about an issue that is crucial to \r\nworld peace and security, as well as to the rights of the \r\nPalestinian people. It is also a key component of a \r\nstrategy against international terrorism, which, as ever, \r\nwe continue to condemn. It is genuinely satisfying, and \r\na salve to the soul, to hear from the mouth of the \r\nPresident of the United States of America that there is a \r\nneed for the Palestinian people to be able to live on \r\ntheir land free of settlements of any kind, as well as, \r\nclearly, a right for Israel’s citizens to live in peace \r\nwithin their borders. The words of the President and \r\nthe timely message he delivered at Cairo University, \r\nwhich many here likely followed with interest, place us \r\nin a position that we have not occupied for many years, \r\nnamely, the possibility of beginning negotiations — \r\nsuccessful ones, I hope — between the Palestinian \r\nAuthority and the Government of Israel to at last \r\nresolve a key issue for international peace and security, \r\nnamely, the Palestinian question. \r\n Lastly, I would like to tell the Assembly that, as a \r\nmember of the Group of 20 (G-20), which will meet \r\ntomorrow in Pittsburgh, we would like to call for the \r\npresence of another multilateral body to be heard from \r\nat those meetings: the International Labour \r\nOrganization. In the two previous G-20 meetings, there \r\nwas a great deal of discussion about the financial \r\ncrisis. However, as we did then, we continue to believe \r\nthat a key issue is to once again discuss the real \r\neconomy. That is why we believed it timely that \r\nworkers and business owners, as genuine actors in the \r\nreal economy and as catalysts to re-energizing it, \r\nshould be heard from as well in those forums, \r\nalongside officials from multilateral credit institutions \r\nand the World Bank. \r\n We are genuinely convinced that there is a need \r\nto build a new multilateralism in which all of us are \r\ngenuinely on an equal footing; where rights and \r\nobligations and the road map for the course to be taken \r\nA/64/PV.4  \r\n \r\n09-52228 4 \r\n \r\nare the same for rich and poor countries alike; and \r\nwhere the rights and responsibilities of developing \r\ncountries are the same as those of developed States. We \r\ntherefore agreed that equal rules of the game for the \r\nentire world was one of the basic elements of ensuring \r\nsuccess in building multilateralism. If we do not \r\nachieve this, we will continue with these rhetorical \r\nexercises year after year, but we will never achieve the \r\nresults that are not a right but an obligation for all of us \r\nwho make up this body. \r\n In conclusion, democracy, the defence of human \r\nrights, and equal rules for all countries in the world are \r\nthe three key elements to building a new \r\nmultilateralism. These three requirements must be \r\nequal and the same for all countries, but above all for \r\nthose that, through their own actions and because of \r\ntheir level of social and economic development, lead \r\nthe major developed countries of the world.  \r\n It is clear that those who have the greatest \r\nresponsibility and hold the greatest leadership roles — \r\nwon through military, technological, economic and \r\neven cultural power — also have an obligation to \r\nexercise that leadership in a responsible manner. This \r\nis what we, the developing and emerging countries, \r\nfeel, and what we ask of the major nations of the \r\nworld. They have the responsibility to build this world. \r\nThis will no doubt be echoed in all our speeches, but \r\nthis building must be done every day through our \r\ndecisions and concrete actions. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Russian): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Argentine Republic for the statement \r\nshe has just made. \r\nMrs. Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, President \r\nof the Argentine Republic, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Emomali Rahmon, President of the \r\nRepublic of Tajikistan \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Russian): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Tajikistan. \r\nMr. Emomali Rahmon, President of the Republic \r\nof Tajikistan, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Russian): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Emomali Rahmon, President of the Republic of \r\nTajikistan, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Rahmon (spoke in Tajik; English text \r\nprovided by the delegation): At the outset, I should like \r\nto congratulate Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-fourth session. I am confident that his extensive \r\ndiplomatic experience and talent will contribute to the \r\nfruitful and successful work of the General Assembly \r\nat this session. \r\n In recent decades, the world has made \r\nconsiderable progress in terms of technology, \r\ninformation and economic and social development, \r\nwhich, due to globalization, is being spread throughout \r\nthe world. However, the negative aspects of this \r\nphenomenon, such as international terrorism, \r\nextremism, transnational organized crime, narcotics \r\ntrafficking, pandemic outbreaks and emerging \r\necological challenges, pose a serious threat to the \r\ninternational community. The United Nations plays the \r\nkey role in coordinating Member States’ efforts to \r\neffectively meet the challenges of modern times and to \r\nattain the Millennium Development Goals. \r\n Tajikistan regards peacekeeping as one of the \r\nmost important aspects of the work of the United \r\nNations. Last year, for the first time ever, citizens of \r\nthe Republic of Tajikistan joined police forces in \r\npeacekeeping operations, contributing to efforts to \r\nstrengthening peace and stability in conflict zones. A \r\nnational strategy on the development of Tajikistan’s \r\npeacekeeping capacity is currently being drafted. \r\n Tajikistan attaches the utmost importance to \r\nstrengthening the disarmament process. We hope that, \r\nat the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, a \r\nconstructive exchange of views will take place on \r\nurgent issues related to the practical implementation of \r\nthat agreement. We are convinced that the \r\nestablishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones is equally \r\nimportant at the regional and global levels. Tajikistan \r\nis therefore prepared to work to enhance its practical \r\nimplementation of the provisions of the Treaty on a \r\nNuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia, which \r\ncame into effect on 21 March 2009. \r\n We support the leading role played by the United \r\nNations in combating the illicit trade in small arms and \r\nlight weapons. We hope that important measures for \r\n A/64/PV.4\r\n \r\n5 09-52228 \r\n \r\ncoordinating further steps in this direction will be \r\ndeveloped at the next Biennial Meeting to be held on \r\nthe Programme of Action. \r\n Tajikistan supports the efforts of the international \r\ncommunity to achieve the comprehensive prohibition \r\nof the use of anti-personnel mines. For our part, we are \r\nmeeting our commitments under the Convention on the \r\nProhibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and \r\nTransfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their \r\nDestruction, by providing mine-risk information to the \r\nSecretary-General on an annual basis. \r\n The first international conference to address the \r\nissues of the consequences of landmines was held in \r\nDushanbe, the capital of my country, in June 2009. \r\nTajikistan has long suffered the effects of landmines. \r\nWe believe that Central Asia must be free from the \r\nthreat of mines and we call upon the international \r\ncommunity to do its utmost to achieve this noble goal. \r\n The international community continues to fight \r\nterrorism, extremism, transnational organized crime \r\nand illicit drug trafficking. These combined threats \r\ngive rise to greater concerns. We therefore consider it \r\nessential to expedite the adoption of a comprehensive \r\nconvention on international terrorism. Double \r\nstandards must be avoided in this endeavour, since \r\nterrorism has no national or religious affiliations. \r\n The prevention of illicit drug trafficking is an \r\nintegral part of the common struggle against terrorism. \r\nTajikistan has developed bilateral, regional and \r\nmultilateral short- and long-term programmes of action, \r\nand ratified approximately 30 intergovernmental \r\nagreements. \r\n The Drug Control Agency established by the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Tajikistan, with the active \r\ninvolvement of the United Nations, has now been in \r\nexistence for over a decade. The total value of heroin \r\nseized during these years, in terms of its average price \r\nin Europe, is estimated at $1.12 billion. This initiative \r\nhas helped save more than 36 million lives from drug \r\naddiction. The Tajik initiative to establish an \r\nanti-narcotics security belt around Afghanistan was \r\nlaunched from the lofty podium of the General \r\nAssembly at its twentieth special session in 1998. \r\n We believe that rendering assistance to \r\nAfghanistan’s target programmes could be one way to \r\ncounteract the drug threat emanating from that country. \r\nRegrettably, the efforts undertaken to date and the \r\nresources allocated by the international community to \r\naddress this challenge have not always been sufficient \r\nto counteract the increasingly aggressive spread of \r\nnarcotics. In our view, the borders of the countries \r\nneighbouring Afghanistan should be regarded as the \r\nfront line in this struggle, and efforts to reinforce that \r\nline should be enhanced. For many years, Tajikistan \r\nhas acted as a buffer zone against the spread and export \r\nof narcotics, terrorism, extremism and other negative \r\nphenomena emanating from this area. \r\n We are profoundly interested in strengthening \r\nlasting peace and stability in our neighbour \r\nAfghanistan because the security of Central Asia \r\ndepends in every respect on the situation in \r\nAfghanistan. Today, it is obvious that the Afghan issue \r\ncannot be resolved by military means alone, but \r\nrequires a comprehensive approach taking into account \r\nall the many factors involved. First and foremost, \r\nsocial and educational projects and programmes should \r\nbe implemented in that country. We support the current \r\nefforts at peaceful rehabilitation and believe that the \r\ninternational strategy of action in Afghanistan should \r\nto a larger extent rely upon the Afghan people \r\nthemselves, and that priority should be given to \r\nensuring close and efficient cooperation with the \r\ncountry’s authorities. \r\n The world situation is rapidly changing because \r\nof the financial and economic crisis. It not only \r\nundermines our efforts and capacity to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, but imposes new and \r\ncomplex tasks. We highly appreciate the United \r\nNations role and efforts to address the current threefold \r\ncrisis and mitigate its consequences.  \r\n It is well known that the global financial and \r\neconomic crisis was caused primarily by the most \r\nadvanced and wealthy countries, which unreasonably \r\ninflated banking assets on the basis of unsecured loans. \r\nWe therefore believe that these countries must bear \r\ntheir share of responsibility towards the developing \r\ncountries, whose already difficult situation was further \r\naggravated by the global financial crisis. Partial write-\r\noffs of the debts incurred during the crisis, ongoing \r\nincreases in donor assistance and rational management \r\nof labour migration would be very helpful in this \r\nsituation. In my opinion, it is high time for a number of \r\nforums to be replaced by practical support for the \r\nefforts of the developing countries to mitigate and \r\novercome the impact of the crisis. If the crisis should \r\nA/64/PV.4  \r\n \r\n09-52228 6 \r\n \r\npersist over the long term, it may be fraught with ever-\r\nmore serious consequences. \r\n Along with other Member States, Tajikistan \r\nsupported the outcome of the United Nations \r\nConference on the World Financial and Economic \r\nCrisis and Its Impact on Development. We highly \r\nappreciate the efforts undertaken by the High-level \r\nTask Force on the Global Food Security Crisis, and \r\ndeem it necessary to enhance assistance to the \r\ndeveloping countries in the form of financial and \r\neconomic support and the transfer of modern \r\ntechnology and seed stocks.  \r\n Meanwhile, in our opinion the efforts to solve the \r\nproblems caused by the energy crisis have not been \r\nsuccessful enough. We believe that, along with the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, access to energy \r\nshould be given top priority. Tajikistan, which ranks \r\neighth in the world in terms of available hydropower \r\nresources — the total amount of which is estimated at \r\n527 billion kilowatt hours — currently utilizes less \r\nthan 5 per cent of its potential, and over the past \r\n18 years has endured a chronic energy crisis for eight \r\nmonths of every year, primarily in autumn and winter. \r\nIn recent years, the electricity shortage has been \r\nexacerbated by abnormally severe and long winters, the \r\nresult of climate change. It is perfectly logical that, in \r\nthe absence of explored hydrocarbon resources, \r\nTajikistan should develop its hydropower engineering \r\nin a concerted and comprehensive manner. \r\n The completion of the construction of a number \r\nof small, medium-size and large hydropower stations \r\nwill help to provide energy not only to the whole of \r\nCentral Asia, but to neighbouring countries as well. In \r\nthis regard, the implementation of such regional \r\nprojects as the Central Asia-South Asia Electricity \r\nTransmission and Trade Project will define the \r\ndevelopment prospects of our vast region, which \r\nincludes Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan and \r\nPakistan. \r\n The ever-increasing need for cost-efficient and \r\nenvironmentally sound energy requires the construction \r\nof hydropower stations and water reservoirs, which are \r\nessential to providing reliable volumes of water, \r\nespecially in years of drought. As hydropower facilities \r\ngenerate energy by utilizing water rather than by \r\nconsuming it, hydropower engineering plays an \r\nimportant role in developing energy production and the \r\nsocio-economic sphere, as well as in environmental \r\nprotection not only in Tajikistan but in the entire \r\nCentral Asian region.  \r\n Global climate change requires a comprehensive \r\nand integrated approach to the use of natural resources. \r\nWe are deeply convinced that the Copenhagen meeting \r\nof the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change will \r\nendorse a new comprehensive agreement on this issue. \r\n Every year, natural disasters cause severe damage \r\nto agriculture, the environment and the entire economy \r\nof countries such as ours. In Tajikistan, 93 per cent of \r\nthe terrain consists of mountains. The damage done to \r\nour country’s economy in recent years by such natural \r\ndisasters as mud flows, landslides and floods is \r\nestimated at hundreds of millions of United States \r\ndollars. Tragically, that damage entails human \r\ncasualties. \r\n An assessment of the impact of climate change on \r\nTajikistan’s glaciers has shown that, during the period \r\nof observation begun in 1930, the total area of the \r\nglaciers has been reduced by approximately one third. \r\nSince glaciers and snowcaps are the main sources for \r\nwater runoff into the rivers, there is a probability that \r\nin the near future river capacity will be diminished by \r\n5 to 15 per cent. At the same time, water consumption \r\nhas increased, due to demographic growth and the \r\nexpansion of areas of irrigation. In the previous \r\ncentury alone, the total area of irrigated land increased \r\nfrom 2.5 million to 9 million hectares, while the \r\npopulation of Central Asia grew from 20 million in \r\n1956 to 63 million people today. In these \r\ncircumstances, the countries of the region should \r\nreview their programmes and strategies with regard to \r\nwater use, especially in agriculture, and take \r\nconsolidated and concerted action to promote \r\nsustainable development. \r\n From this lofty rostrum, we should like once \r\nagain to remind everyone of the problems caused by \r\nthe degradation of the Aral Sea. The large-scale use of \r\nland for cultivating such agricultural crops as cotton \r\nand rice, which consume a great deal of water, has \r\nbecome the primary cause of this ecological disaster. \r\n The most reasonable solution to the current \r\nsituation, which is characterized by the salinization of \r\nsoil and the irretrievable loss of 30 to 60 per cent of \r\nirrigation water, would be to adopt specific water-\r\nsaving measures, such as the rehabilitation of irrigation \r\nsystems, the reclamation of irrigated land, the \r\n A/64/PV.4\r\n \r\n7 09-52228 \r\n \r\nintroduction of advanced irrigation technologies and \r\nthe partial replacement of cotton and rice with crops \r\nthat consume less water, which would also help to \r\naddress the food crisis issue.  \r\n Only an integrated and mutually beneficial \r\napproach of the countries of the region towards the use \r\nof water energy and other natural resources can help to \r\nresolve the interrelated energy, food and environment \r\nproblems and to ensure the sustainable development of \r\nall Central Asian countries. It is no secret that \r\nhumankind is already facing a shortage of safe \r\ndrinking water, which is not accessible to more than \r\n1 billion people on the planet, while in some countries \r\nthe price of freshwater currently exceeds that of petrol.  \r\n As a country that has one of the largest amounts \r\nof freshwater resources in the world, Tajikistan is \r\nconvinced that creating an economic mechanism for \r\nthe cross-flow of water and energy resources between \r\nupstream countries that are rich in water resources and \r\ndownstream countries where hydrocarbon deposits are \r\nprimarily located would promote long-term mutually \r\nbeneficial cooperation among those States.  \r\n Having put forward the idea of using safe \r\ndrinking water from Lake Sarez to meet the needs of \r\nthe population of the entire region, we propose specific \r\nmeasures in that area. We hope that the United Nations \r\nand other international organizations, regional \r\ncommissions and relevant institutions can offer \r\nconstructive and unwavering assistance on that issue, \r\nwhich is of utmost significance to our region. \r\n As the initiator of the International Year of \r\nFreshwater 2003 and the International Decade for \r\nAction, “Water for Life”, 2005-2015, Tajikistan \r\nbelieves that it is of paramount importance to expedite \r\nthe implementation of the United Nations water agenda \r\nand to enhance it by achieving the Decade goals. World \r\nWater Day on 22 March 2010 will mark the fifth year \r\nsince the commencement of the Water Decade. In that \r\nregard, Tajikistan proposes holding on that day a high-\r\nlevel dialogue of the General Assembly to discuss the \r\nimplementation of the international water Decade and \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals on water and \r\nsanitation. That event could be a milestone in the \r\nmidterm review of the implementation of half of the \r\nDecade and evaluation of the progress in achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. \r\n My Government has already put forward a \r\nproposal to hold a conference for a midterm review in \r\nDushanbe in 2010 that would serve as one of the \r\npreparatory events for the United Nations millennium \r\nreview summit in 2010. I hope that that initiative will \r\nfind understanding among and receive support from all \r\nMember States. \r\n Bearing in mind the water crisis, which has been \r\naggravated by population growth and global climate \r\nchange, the international community should take \r\nspecific measures to ensure the fair and integrated use \r\nof water resources in order to meet the needs of the \r\npeople, environment and economies of all countries \r\naround the world. To that end, the Republic of \r\nTajikistan has proposed declaring 2012 international \r\nyear of water diplomacy, with the aim of developing, \r\nwithin the United Nations, further coordinated steps \r\ntowards the rational use of water resources at the \r\nnational, regional and international levels. Our country \r\nintends to further promote that issue at the General \r\nAssembly, and hopes for the support of all Member \r\nStates. \r\n Next year will mark the beginning of the third \r\nfive-year term on the way towards the international \r\ncommunity’s achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. The year 2010 will be a landmark in the \r\nassessment of our efforts to meet global challenges, \r\novercome difficulties and evaluate the progress in \r\nattaining the goals outlined in the United Nations \r\nMillennium Declaration. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to stress that, as an \r\nadvocate of broad-based cooperation, Tajikistan \r\nbelieves that only collective and coordinated efforts \r\nand effective regional and international cooperation \r\ncan serve as a foundation for our common success in \r\nthat area. The mutual understanding and cooperation \r\nthat have prevailed in this Organization since its \r\nestablishment remain the only way to a bright and clear \r\nfuture and to universal peace and prosperity. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Russian): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Tajikistan for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\nMr. Emomali Rahmon, President of the Republic \r\nof Tajikistan, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nA/64/PV.4  \r\n \r\n09-52228 8 \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Hu Jintao, President of the People’s \r\nRepublic of China \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Russian): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe People’s Republic of China. \r\nMr. Hu Jintao, President of the People’s Republic \r\nof China, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Russian): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Hu \r\nJintao, President of the People’s Republic of China, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Hu Jintao (spoke in Chinese): The \r\nworld today is undergoing major developments, major \r\nchanges and major adjustments. The trend towards \r\npeace, development and cooperation, which represents \r\nthe call of our times, has grown stronger than ever. As \r\nthe world moves further towards multipolarity and \r\neconomic globalization, multilateralism and democracy \r\nin international relations have won greater popular \r\nsupport, while openness and cooperation for mutual \r\nbenefit and win-win progress have become the shared \r\naspirations of the international community. Countries \r\nhave become more interdependent. \r\n At the same time, the world remains in the grip of \r\nthe financial crisis, and the prospects for economic \r\nrecovery are still not clear. Worldwide, unemployment \r\nand poverty are worsening, and development \r\nimbalances are more acute. Global issues such as \r\nclimate change, food security, energy and resource \r\nsecurity, and public health security have been thrown \r\ninto sharp relief. Non-traditional security threats, \r\nincluding terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of \r\nmass destruction, transnational organized crime and \r\nmajor communicable diseases, are threatening our \r\nworld. Some long-standing hotspot issues remain \r\nunresolved, while regional and local conflicts continue \r\nto flare up. The instability and uncertainties on the \r\ninternational landscape pose severe challenges to world \r\npeace and development. \r\n In the face of unprecedented opportunities and \r\nchallenges, we members of the international \r\ncommunity should commit ourselves to peace, \r\ndevelopment, cooperation, common progress and \r\ntolerance, and continue our joint endeavour to build a \r\nharmonious world of enduring peace and common \r\nprosperity and contribute to the noble cause of the \r\npeace and development of humankind. \r\n First, we should view security in a broader \r\nperspective and safeguard world peace and stability. \r\nThe security of all countries has never been as closely \r\ninterconnected as it is today. Security is not a zero-sum \r\ngame, and there is no isolated or absolute security. No \r\ncountry can be safe and stable in the absence of world \r\nand regional peace and stability. \r\n We should embrace a new security mindset of \r\nmutual trust, mutual benefit, equality and coordination. \r\nWhile maintaining our own national security, we \r\nshould also respect the security concerns of other \r\ncountries and advance the common security of \r\nhumankind. We should adhere to the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and \r\nseek peaceful solutions to regional hotspot issues and \r\ninternational disputes. There should be no wilful use or \r\nthreat of force. We should support the United Nations \r\nin continuing to play an important role in the field of \r\ninternational security. We should oppose terrorism, \r\nseparatism and extremism in all their manifestations \r\nand broaden international security cooperation. \r\n China has consistently stood for the complete \r\nprohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear \r\nweapons and for a world without nuclear weapons. We \r\ncall on the international community to take credible \r\nsteps to push forward the nuclear disarmament process, \r\neradicate the risks of nuclear weapons proliferation and \r\npromote the peaceful use of nuclear energy and related \r\ninternational cooperation. \r\n Secondly, we should take a more holistic \r\napproach to development and promote common \r\nprosperity. Increasing economic globalization has \r\nlinked the development of all countries closely \r\ntogether. Without the development and equal \r\nparticipation of developing countries, there can be \r\nneither common prosperity in the world nor a more just \r\nand equitable international economic order. The \r\ndeveloping countries now face a deteriorating external \r\nenvironment brought about by the international \r\nfinancial crisis. Their economies are slowing down, \r\nand their development endeavours are beset by serious \r\ndifficulties. \r\n We believe that common development is an \r\nimportant way to redress global development \r\nimbalances and achieve sustainable development. The \r\nUnited Nations should increase its input in \r\n A/64/PV.4\r\n \r\n9 09-52228 \r\n \r\ndevelopment; advance economic globalization in the \r\ndirection of balanced development, shared benefits and \r\nwin-win progress; and foster an international \r\nenvironment conducive to the development of \r\ndeveloping countries. The international financial \r\ninstitutions should use their newly increased resources, \r\nfirst and foremost, to help developing countries move \r\nout of poverty and provide loans to them in a more \r\nflexible, diverse, convenient and efficient manner. \r\nGreat effort should be made to increase the \r\nrepresentation and voice of developing countries in the \r\nprocess of reforming the international financial system. \r\n We should take responsible measures to counter \r\nthe international financial crisis, firmly oppose \r\nprotectionism and actively work for an early, \r\ncomprehensive and balanced outcome of the Doha \r\nRound negotiations. Developed countries should open \r\ntheir markets to developing countries and reduce or \r\nexempt tariffs for those countries. They should honour \r\ntheir official development assistance and debt relief \r\ncommitments and, in particular, increase assistance to \r\nthe least developed countries, with a focus on tackling \r\nsuch issues as hunger, health care and education.  \r\n For developing countries, self-reliance is \r\nessential. They should explore development models \r\nconducive to their development and poverty \r\neradication efforts. It is also in their interest to increase \r\ntrade and investment cooperation, open markets to one \r\nanother and step up South-South cooperation. \r\n Thirdly, we should pursue cooperation with a \r\nmore open mind and work for mutual benefit and \r\ncommon progress. Climate change, food security, \r\nenergy and resource security, and public health security \r\nare all global challenges, and no country is immune to \r\nthem. The only way for us to meet those challenges and \r\nensure harmony and peace is to engage in closer \r\ninternational cooperation.  \r\n Climate change is one of the serious challenges to \r\nhuman survival and development, and international \r\ncooperation is the key to tackling that challenge. We \r\nshould retain the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol \r\nas the main channel in addressing climate change, \r\nabide by the principle of common but differentiated \r\nresponsibilities, adhere to the mandate of the Bali Road \r\nMap, and work for the success of the Copenhagen \r\nconference with a view to achieving mutual benefit and \r\ncommon progress. \r\n Food and energy are vital to the livelihood, \r\ndevelopment and stability of all nations. We should \r\nincrease our input into agriculture, develop advanced \r\ntechnologies, curb market speculation, increase food \r\nassistance and intensify cooperation with regard to \r\nagriculture and food. We should strengthen mutually \r\nbeneficial cooperation in the area of energy, step up the \r\nresearch and development of new and renewable \r\nenergies, put in place a system for the research, \r\ndevelopment and dissemination of advanced energy \r\ntechnologies, and diversify the energy supply. \r\n The continued spread of influenza A — H1N1 — \r\nhas presented a global public health challenge \r\nconfronting the entire international community. China \r\nis ready to provide help, within its capacities, to other \r\ndeveloping countries in the prevention and control of \r\ninfluenza A. \r\n Fourthly, we should be more tolerant towards one \r\nanother and live together in harmony. Mutual learning \r\nand tolerance among different civilizations are an \r\ninexhaustible source of strength for social progress, \r\nand all countries — large or small, strong or weak, rich \r\nor poor — are equal. We should acknowledge \r\ndifferences in our cultural traditions, social systems \r\nand values, respect the right of all countries to \r\nindependently choose their own development paths, let \r\ndifferent civilizations and models of development draw \r\non one another’s strengths through competition and \r\ncomparison, and achieve common development by \r\nseeking common ground while reserving the right to \r\ndiffer.  \r\n The Chinese people will soon celebrate the \r\nsixtieth anniversary of the founding of the People’s \r\nRepublic of China. Sixty years ago, the Chinese people \r\nwon independence and liberation after a prolonged, \r\nhard struggle and became masters of the new China. \r\nToday, China’s national strength has grown remarkably \r\nand the people are better off. \r\n China’s development has contributed greatly to \r\npeace and development in the world, and China’s \r\nfuture is more closely interconnected with that of the \r\nworld. A more developed China will make greater \r\ncontributions and bring more opportunities to the \r\nworld. We are committed to the path of peaceful \r\ndevelopment and the win-win strategy of opening up. \r\nWe will develop friendly relations and cooperation \r\nwith all countries on the basis of the Five Principles of \r\nPeaceful Coexistence. China has always been and will \r\nA/64/PV.4  \r\n \r\n09-52228 10 \r\n \r\ncontinue to be a positive force for world peace and \r\ncommon development. \r\n As a responsible and major developing country, \r\nChina has always made common development an \r\nimportant aspect of its foreign policy. We have made a \r\ngreat effort to provide support and assistance to other \r\ndeveloping countries. To further assist them, China will \r\nadopt the following measures. \r\n First, we will increase support for other \r\ndeveloping countries hit hard by the financial crisis, \r\nhonestly implement relevant capital increase and \r\nfinancing plans, intensify trade and investment \r\ncooperation and help increase the capacity of relevant \r\ncountries for risk resistance and sustainable \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n Secondly, we will continue to implement the \r\nmeasures announced at the United Nations High-level \r\nEvent on the Millennium Development Goals to assist \r\nother developing countries in accelerating development \r\nand facilitating attainment of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). \r\n Thirdly, China will follow through on the \r\nmeasures to help African countries that were \r\nannounced at the Beijing Summit of the Forum on \r\nChina-Africa Cooperation, increase assistance to \r\nAfrica, reduce or cancel debts for African countries, \r\nexpand trade and investment, provide human resources \r\nand technological support for African countries in such \r\nareas as agriculture, health, education and disaster \r\npreparedness and reduction, and intensify personnel \r\ntraining tailored to African needs. \r\n Fourthly, China will continue to participate in and \r\npromote regional monetary and financial cooperation, \r\nmaintain financial and economic stability and promote \r\nfinancial cooperation and trade in the region. \r\n Let us join hands, share the development \r\nopportunities, rise above the challenges and make an \r\nunremitting effort towards building a harmonious \r\nworld of enduring peace and common prosperity. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Russian): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the People’s Republic of China for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\nMr. Hu Jintao, President of the People’s Republic \r\nof China, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\nMr. Grauls (Belgium), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n \r\nAddress by His Serene Highness Prince Albert II  \r\nof Monaco  \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Serene \r\nHighness Prince Albert II of Monaco. \r\nHis Serene Highness Prince Albert II of Monaco, \r\nwas escorted into the General Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Serene Highness \r\nPrince Albert II of Monaco and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly. \r\n Prince Albert (spoke in French): My \r\nparticipation in this general debate, like that of more \r\nthan 100 heads of State and Government, confirms \r\nboth the seriousness of the choices we must make in \r\nthe face of the challenges confronting our States and \r\nthe unavoidable role of the United Nations in deciding \r\non the future of our planet and its inhabitants. \r\n More than ever before, the General Assembly \r\nmust be the “centre for harmonizing the actions of \r\nnations” in the attainment of the common ends defined \r\nin Article 1 of the Charter. To remain the vital centre, \r\nthe Organization and its most representative body of \r\nthe community of nations — our General Assembly — \r\nmust better take into consideration the interdependence \r\nthat links our destinies and the opportunity presented to \r\nour sovereign States to bestow upon our fellow \r\ncountrymen a common vision marked by moral values. \r\n The financial storm that swept through the world \r\na year ago has caused too much suffering and too much \r\nharm to the global economy, at a time in our history \r\nwhen we are confronted with the major challenges of \r\nthe climate crisis and the implementation of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), for us not to \r\ndraw obvious conclusions. \r\n A year from now, we will meet again in this same \r\nforum to take stock of the progress we have made in \r\nthe implementation of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). The 2015 deadline — which already \r\nseemed compromised on the eve of this \r\nmultidimensional crisis — requires that we define a \r\nglobal vision for the future of humankind. Some will \r\ncall it solidarity or moral awareness. Whatever the \r\n A/64/PV.4\r\n \r\n11 09-52228 \r\n \r\nname, we need to clearly define and implement the \r\nMDGs to meet the basic needs of all human beings. \r\n If poverty eradication is to remain our priority, \r\nwe will have to get busy on fulfilling our obligations, \r\nfor the most destitute are also the ones who are hungry, \r\nwho suffer from malnutrition and who lack access to \r\nwater and to basic social and health services. Among \r\nthe main victims are women and children, 25,000 of \r\nwhom die each day, according to UNICEF. \r\n Several hundred thousand people today benefit \r\nfrom actions undertaken by my country in the \r\nframework of its international cooperation in the fields \r\nof health, education and the fight against poverty. This \r\nis why I requested that we continue our effort to \r\ncontribute 0.7 per cent of our GDP by 2015 to official \r\ndevelopment assistance. This assistance must not be \r\nsacrificed because of the present economic and \r\nfinancial situation. On the contrary, it must be \r\nstrengthened at a time when the most vulnerable are \r\nthe ones who need it the most. This development \r\nassistance must be accompanied by long-term \r\ninvestments aimed at strengthening the capacity-\r\nbuilding of developing countries, in particular through \r\nthe transfer of appropriate technologies with a view to \r\nrespecting the requirements of sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\n From this perspective, and in the light of the \r\nrecent food crisis, the time is right to restore \r\nagriculture to its proper place, because food security \r\ndepends on it. Today, it is up to us to forge for future \r\ngenerations a new destiny, “a new deal”. We must \r\nmove from being donors to become partners in a green \r\nrevolution in Africa, where food-producing agriculture \r\nadapted to the specific conditions of the continent must \r\nempower the local populations. \r\n The restoration of agriculture to the heart of our \r\ncivilization also raises the crucial issue of water. \r\nWhether regarding access to it for the survival of our \r\npopulations, for farming or for energy production, it is \r\nimperative to guarantee water security. Therefore, an \r\nintegrated management of water resources is needed. \r\nWe must be aware of the potential disasters and \r\nconflicts that would arise if we failed, and of risks \r\nlinked to poor sanitation that could cause outbreaks of \r\ninfectious diseases and pandemics. \r\n The phenomena of desertification and drought, as \r\nwell as the acidification of seas and oceans, are \r\nexacerbated by man-made climatic change. This is why \r\nfailure of the Copenhagen negotiations is not an option. \r\nMy commitment, and that of my worldwide \r\ncounterparts, as stated yesterday in the framework of \r\nthe climate change summit convened by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, is unequivocal: we must, together — \r\ndeveloped countries, countries with high carbon \r\ndioxide emissions and developing countries — succeed \r\nin defining a post-Kyoto regime that will be decidedly \r\nin line with a low-carbon-emission future. \r\n For too long, we have neglected the scientific \r\nwarnings. More than 20 years ago, the \r\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was \r\ncreated by the World Meteorological Organization. \r\nDuring the third World Climate Conference at the \r\nbeginning of September which, with great pleasure, I \r\nattended, it was decided to establish a Global \r\nFramework for Climate Services, with a view to \r\nhelping populations meet this increasingly pressing \r\nchallenge. \r\n This Global Framework, which we fully support, \r\naims at improving the management of the risks of \r\nclimate fluctuations and climate change as well as \r\nadaptation to climate change at all levels, through \r\ndevelopment and the incorporation of science-based \r\ninformation and forecasting into policies and planning. \r\nThe unparalleled mobilization of public opinion \r\ncompels us to adopt innovative measures to slow \r\nglobal warming, whose consequences could be \r\ncatastrophic. \r\n The Trade and Development Report recommends \r\ndeep structural changes, which will not happen unless \r\nwe are willing to challenge our patterns of production \r\nand consumption. The setting up of a green economy \r\nmust be the basis of such a process. Our role, as \r\npolitical decision makers, is to ensure that the \r\nnecessary technology — which already exists — is put \r\nto use to reduce greenhouse gases. Sustainable \r\ndevelopment requires the globalization of green \r\ntechnologies and environmental assets. \r\n On behalf of the Principality, I reiterate our stated \r\nambition to become carbon neutral and our resolve to \r\nreduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by \r\n2020 and by 60 per cent by 2050. \r\n During these past few months, the world \r\neconomy has been sorely tried and tested. Signs of \r\nrecovery are beginning to show, but we must draw \r\nlessons from this grim year. The globalization of the \r\neconomy and the resulting interdependence require \r\nA/64/PV.4  \r\n \r\n09-52228 12 \r\n \r\nreform of the international monetary and financial \r\nsystem. \r\n Created 10 years ago, the Group of 20 (G-20) met \r\nfor the first time at the level of heads of State or \r\nGovernment last November, thereby acknowledging \r\nthe urgency of adopting measures to save the world \r\neconomy from a disaster worsened by the panic \r\nreigning in the financial markets. Monaco \r\nacknowledges that this group, which represents two \r\nthirds of the world’s population and trade and close to \r\n90 per cent of the world gross domestic product, bears \r\nspecial responsibility vis-à-vis the rest of the \r\ninternational community. \r\n We are confident of the capacity of the G-20, \r\ntomorrow in Pittsburgh, to lay the foundations for a \r\nnew era encompassing, inter alia, financial regulation, \r\nfinancial traders’ income, governance and resources \r\nallocated to international financial institutions. The \r\nG-20’s ability to bring together all States will give rise \r\nto the legitimacy necessary for renewed growth. \r\n For several months, my Government has been \r\nworking to fulfil the commitments it undertook and to \r\ncomply with the required norms of the Organization for \r\nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) with \r\na view to improve transparency and exchanges of fiscal \r\nand banking information. That is why my Government \r\nhas already signed 12 bilateral conventions and has \r\nundertaken to conclude other agreements in this area. \r\nAs of today, Monaco has had its efforts acknowledged \r\nby the OECD and will thus now be included on its \r\nWhite List. \r\n But let us make no mistake: the breach of trust \r\nresulting from the financial disaster has made it more \r\nnecessary than ever before that the measures taken by \r\nthe G-20 be non-discriminatory and bring together all \r\nMember States. A consultative body would thus ensure \r\nthe legitimacy of any decisions made. \r\n We must, together, rebuild solid foundations for a \r\ncapitalism with a human face that promotes growth and \r\nsocial development. Current circumstances have \r\nprovided us the opportunity to create a green economy, \r\none which associates job creation with the transfer of \r\nnew technologies which will enable us to achieve a \r\nsustained recovery. \r\n The State must continuously adapt its role and the \r\nexpression of its sovereignty to new realities in order \r\nto remain the guarantor of the security and social well-\r\nbeing of populations. The United Nations cannot avoid \r\nthis either. Since its creation, the Organization has \r\nworked for the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity through operations led under its flag. It has \r\nalso played a prominent federative role in the field of \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation. \r\n Human and material resources available to \r\npeacekeeping operations have reached levels that \r\nwould have not been conceivable only a decade ago. \r\nThe necessary consideration of this matter initiated \r\nwithin the Security Council and the Secretariat, as well \r\nas with Member States, is a priority and we support it. \r\n What is just as important is the strengthening of \r\nthe rule of law and of democratic institutions, \r\nguardians of sovereignty and the peaceful coexistence \r\nof States. In this respect, I wish to reiterate the support \r\nof my country for the implementation of the \r\nresponsibility to protect, which is symbolic of the \r\nstrengthening of multilateralism for the good of \r\npopulations. The responsibility to protect does not \r\naffect the exercise of responsible sovereignty, which \r\nplaces the individual at the forefront. Monaco will \r\ncontinue to work with its partners — that is, each and \r\nevery one in this Hall — to implement best practices in \r\nthe field of protection, international assistance and \r\ncapacity-building, with the sole objective of saving \r\nlives. \r\n The Principality will keep responding, in \r\nsolidarity, to emergency humanitarian situations, \r\nespecially when it comes to assisting women and \r\nchildren, whose vulnerability in crisis situations, \r\nunfortunately, no longer needs to be demonstrated.  \r\n In 2010, we will celebrate the International Year \r\nfor the Rapprochement of Cultures and the \r\nInternational Year of Biodiversity. These themes \r\nsymbolize, at the outset of the twenty-first century, the \r\nharmony that we must seek both among our people — \r\nwith acceptance of our differences — and between the \r\nhuman species and the other living species on Earth, \r\nwhich we have the duty to protect and save from \r\nextinction. \r\n I can assure the Assembly that my country will \r\ncontinue to tirelessly commit itself to processes likely \r\nto build and strengthen the ties between our societies in \r\norder to promote dialogue and cultural and religious \r\nunderstanding based on mutual respect, such as the \r\nUnion for the Mediterranean and the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations.  \r\n A/64/PV.4\r\n \r\n13 09-52228 \r\n \r\n I am convinced that the President’s great \r\nexperience at the United Nations and his role in the \r\ncreation of the African Union are great pluses for the \r\nsuccess of his very sensitive mission. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank His \r\nSerene Highness Prince Albert II of the Principality of \r\nMonaco for the statement he has just made. \r\nPrince Albert II of the Principality of Monaco \r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Alvaro Uribe Vélez, President of the \r\nRepublic of Colombia \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Colombia. \r\nMr. Alvaro Uribe Vélez, President of the Republic \r\nof Colombia, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Alvaro Uribe Vélez, President of the Republic of \r\nColombia, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Uribe Vélez (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nwould like to congratulate the President of the General \r\nAssembly and reiterate to the United Nations our \r\ngratitude for its positive presence and cooperation with \r\nthe Colombian people. \r\n The Government over which I preside aims to \r\nenhance the confidence of the national and \r\ninternational community in Colombia. This quest for \r\nconfidence is based on three pillars: security with \r\ndemocratic values, the promotion of investment and \r\nentrepreneurship with social responsibility, and social \r\ncohesion with freedoms. \r\n We continue with our security advances, but also \r\nthere are some outstanding challenges. I would like to \r\nhighlight some intangible achievements that attest to \r\nthe democratic credentials of our security project.  \r\n We have recovered two monopolies that we \r\nshould never have lost: the monopoly of institutional \r\nforces to fight criminals and the monopoly of justice \r\nthat the terrorists tried to dislodge. We have dismantled \r\nparamilitarism, a term that emerged to describe private \r\ncriminal gangs whose objective was to fight drug-\r\ntrafficking guerrillas. Today, the State is the only entity \r\nthat fights all those criminals. Those criminals in all \r\ntheir forms — narco-guerrillas, criminal gangs — are \r\npart of a mafia-type relationship that unites them or \r\npits them against each other to distribute or fight over \r\nthe gains of the criminal drug business.  \r\n Justice, with the Supreme Court that was attacked \r\nin 1985 by drug traffickers and guerrillas; justice, \r\nwhich was tormented by the threats to and \r\nassassination of judges and was dislodged in many \r\nregions by the terrorists leaders of guerrillas and \r\nparamilitary groups that attempted to replace it; justice \r\nhas, throughout the entire country, regained its full \r\neffectiveness. \r\n Victims did not complain out of fear of retaliation \r\nor because they thought it was pointless. Now, thanks \r\nto the recovery of our security, we have registered \r\n239,758 victims, whose situations we are determined to \r\nremedy, a remedy that is never complete but which will \r\nlead little by little to reconciliation by overcoming of \r\nthe spirit of vengeance and hatred. \r\n We have regained the independence of \r\ndecentralization and of political exercise. Terrorism \r\nhad displaced 30 per cent of our mayors, stolen and \r\ncorrupted municipal and departmental budgets and \r\nexercised coercion within the public sector. Mayors \r\nhave regained their security so that they may freely \r\ncarry out their duties and transparently manage their \r\nresources. Politics is now expressed freely in all \r\nspectrums of thought. This terrorist threat has been \r\ntackled without martial law, with full civil and political \r\nguarantees and absolute respect for the freedom that we \r\npromote with security.  \r\n We are working to improve the effectiveness of \r\nour public forces as well as respect for human rights. \r\nWe do not hesitate to punish those who violate them, \r\nbut neither do we refrain from defending our soldiers \r\nand policemen who sometimes have been victims of a \r\ndirty legal war. Colombia has voluntarily presented \r\nitself to a United Nations human rights review.  \r\n Furthermore, despite the suffering caused by \r\nlandmines that had been planted by terrorist groups, the \r\nState destroyed those that were used by its public \r\nforces for training purposes. Our country is one of the \r\nleaders of the Ottawa Convention to destroy these \r\nlandmines and will host the next meeting of States \r\nparties in Cartagena. \r\nA/64/PV.4  \r\n \r\n09-52228 14 \r\n \r\n We tackle terrorism with the utmost \r\ndetermination, and we practise democracy fervently. \r\nThat is why the doors of Colombia have been open \r\nwithout restriction to international vigilance. We \r\ndeliberate and disagree, but both impartial observers \r\nand biased critics have had complete freedom to \r\nexpress themselves in Colombia. \r\n Our interest does not lie in the fanatical \r\nconfrontation between left and right, which is as \r\ndangerous as it is obsolete. Rather, we are betting on a \r\nmodern democracy, a democracy that is safe and free, \r\nthat builds social cohesion, a democracy with \r\nindependent institutions and with confidence that stems \r\nfrom the transparency that is based on a high level of \r\ncivic participation. \r\n We have not been able to completely overcome \r\nthe problem of displacement, but we have increased \r\nour budget twelvefold to help displaced persons. We \r\npromote trust between public forces and communities \r\nso that those who fight drug trafficking are not \r\nthwarted by the displacement that is caused by drug \r\ntraffickers. \r\n We have demobilized 51,783 members of terrorist \r\ngroups, whose numbers have dropped from around \r\n60,000 to fewer than 8,000. We have been extremely \r\ngenerous with those who have been demobilized and \r\nextremely severe with the 7 per cent who have returned \r\nto crime. The Justice and Peace Law, which covers \r\nthem, made it possible to report 29,555 criminal acts, \r\n12,104 confessions, the discovery of 2,043 graves with \r\n2,492 corpses, the identification of 708 bodies and the \r\nreturn of 581 to their families. The participation of \r\nvictims and new procedures for restitution and \r\nrestoration of their rights are a decisive component of \r\nthis demobilization process. \r\n Terrorism cannot be ignored in the name of good \r\ninternational relations. To the contrary, multilateralism \r\nand diplomacy must lead to collaborative action among \r\nStates to overcome this tragedy and its corollaries, \r\nincluding arms trafficking, illicit drugs, money and \r\nasset laundering and terrorist havens. \r\n We reaffirm our commitment to multilateralism in \r\nall its legitimate expressions, from organizations of \r\nneighbouring countries to the most global \r\nOrganization, but we believe that multilateralism must \r\ndemonstrate that it is effective in defeating \r\ninternational crime. \r\n Colombia has acknowledged its internal problem \r\nof narco-terrorism. We have carried out a heroic \r\nstruggle that will ultimately prevail. We cooperate with \r\nthe international community and we ask for more \r\neffective cooperation. We are cooperating with Mexico, \r\nGuatemala, Panama, Costa Rica, Haiti, the Dominican \r\nRepublic, Peru, Afghanistan and other countries. We \r\nacknowledge the efforts of the United States to work \r\ntogether with us to make progress in dismantling \r\nnarco-terrorism. We request greater cooperation from \r\nmore countries and from the international community. \r\nOur objective is to restore domestic security and never \r\nto participate in the arms race for the bloody game of \r\ninternational warfare. Our tradition is one of respect \r\nfor the global community. \r\n We are concerned that, instead of progress \r\ntowards greater cooperation to ensure the security, \r\npeace and tranquillity of the citizens of all countries, \r\nthere is an acceleration of the arms race. Some justify \r\nit by citing the need to modernize their military \r\nequipment, while others admit their desire for war. \r\n Multilateral agencies, led by the United Nations, \r\nmust strengthen their action so that Governments will \r\nfulfil their duty to protect their citizens and their \r\nobligation not to attack the international community. \r\n In Colombia, the only reason for terrorism is the \r\ndrug trade. Its violent criminals used to deny being \r\ninvolved in narco-terrorism and to try to appear \r\nideological; today, having lost all sense of decency, \r\nthey cannot hide their criminal enterprise or feign \r\nideological postures, which are negated by their cruelty \r\ntowards their victims and those whom they have \r\nkidnapped. The democratic transparency of our \r\ncountry, which they tried to destroy, ensures that they \r\nwill never be acceptable. \r\n We have a different view of co-responsibility and \r\nof the proposal that drugs be legalized. The former \r\ndivision between producer and consumer countries has \r\ndisappeared. Colombia began as a trafficking territory, \r\nburst into production and now suffers as a consumer. \r\nThose who began as consumers increase production. \r\nAll peoples are exposed to the risks of drug production, \r\ntrafficking and consumption. Co-responsibility must \r\nthus be exercised in accordance with its real meaning: \r\na task that belongs to all of us, without any \r\nreservations. \r\n We believe that, instead of advocating the \r\nlegalization of drugs, we should consider the need to \r\n A/64/PV.4\r\n \r\n15 09-52228 \r\n \r\ncriminalize consumption. There is no consistency \r\nbetween toughness when it comes to production and \r\ntrafficking and permissiveness when it comes to \r\nconsumption. That has led to deadly micro-trafficking \r\nin cities, the promotion of consumption by adolescents \r\nand young people and the involvement of children in \r\nthe criminal trade. We are making progress in the \r\nconstitutional process of criminalizing consumption, \r\ntaking care not to confuse the sick addict with the \r\ncriminal distributor.  \r\n Our Government is promoting investment and \r\nentrepreneurship as ways to overcome poverty and \r\nbuild equity. Colombia is moving forward in terms of \r\ncompetitiveness and confidence. Investment must \r\nperform a function of social responsibility to acquire \r\npopular legitimacy in democratic societies. Social \r\nresponsibility — not speculation — is inseparable from \r\ncapital as a significant factor in social-wealth creation. \r\nThe economic crisis is a crisis of speculation, rather \r\nthan of creative free enterprise. We are confident that \r\nthe necessary conventions will be adopted to avoid the \r\nrisks created by speculative money transfers and \r\nfinancial market speculation. We fear a new era of \r\nprotectionism and the selective closure of developed \r\neconomies, which would impede sustainable economic \r\nrecovery. \r\n Social responsibility is inseparable from the fight \r\nagainst climate change. Colombia is a net producer of \r\noxygen and emits insignificant amounts of carbon \r\ndioxide. However, we are highly vulnerable, as shown \r\nby the winter tragedies in recent years, which have \r\ncaused losses in terms of human life, production and \r\nhigh service costs. We support tougher international \r\nconventions to protect the environment. We hope that \r\nthe Copenhagen conference will produce effective \r\nbinding instruments so that it will not be another dead \r\nletter. \r\n Our main contribution to the fight against climate \r\nchange is the preservation of our 578,000-square-\r\nkilometre rainforest, which constitutes more than \r\n51 per cent of our national territory and the majority of \r\nwhich lies along the Amazon. We have as a concrete \r\npolicy the forest ranger family programme, which has \r\ninvolved more than 90,000 rural families in the \r\ncollective effort to protect the rainforest, keep it free \r\nfrom the shadow of illicit drugs and ensure its recovery \r\nwhere it has been destroyed. The State pays a bonus to \r\nthose families. The programme, supervised by the \r\nUnited Nations, has received the highest rating from \r\nthe Organization. \r\n In Colombia, forest ranger families protect the \r\nAmazon rainforest from predatory drugs; elsewhere in \r\nthe world, a similar model could preserve trees in order \r\nto mitigate climate change. \r\n Clean energy, mass transportation systems and \r\nthe protection of water sources are essential actions in \r\nour contribution to the fight against global warming. \r\nColombia, at more than 1 million litres per day, is the \r\nsecond-largest Latin American producer of ethanol \r\nfrom sugar cane and, at 1.8 million litres per day, the \r\nlargest producer of biodiesel from African palm. The \r\nconditions in our country make it possible to increase \r\nthose outputs without destroying the rainforest or \r\nlimiting food security. \r\n We have introduced incentives for other clean \r\nenergies such as solar and wind energy, the \r\ndevelopment of which remains small despite their great \r\npotential. \r\n We are working on building nine mass \r\ntransportation systems in major cities and are now in \r\nthe process of incorporating another 10 that are \r\nproportionally sized, with a view to replacing \r\nindividual transportation with collective transportation. \r\n Eleven per cent of our national territory has been \r\ndesignated a protected area. In natural sanctuaries such \r\nas the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, which is the \r\nhighest coastal sanctuary in the world, agreements with \r\nindigenous communities are being implemented. In \r\nexchange for security, the recovery of lands and the \r\nbuilding of seven out of nine promised villages, they \r\nhave once again taken over the noble task of preserving \r\nforests and water sources. \r\n We gain nothing from security, investment, \r\nhealth, education or any other social cohesion policy if \r\nwe do not attach equal importance to the environment. \r\nWe understand this in a “mega-diverse” nation that \r\ncontains 14 per cent of the planet’s diversity and ranks \r\nsecond — behind Brazil — in terms of plant and \r\nanimal species and first in terms of amphibians and \r\nbirds. \r\n Our fervent desire is to increase the Human \r\nOpportunity Index in order to eliminate poverty, build \r\nequity and guarantee every possible alternative for new \r\ngenerations. We propose to include in the measuring of \r\nthe Index progress and setbacks in environmental \r\nA/64/PV.4  \r\n \r\n09-52228 16 \r\n \r\npolicies. Opportunities are pointless without \r\nenvironmental protection. Let us be effective in our \r\nfight against climate change so that we do not condemn \r\nthe future inhabitants of the Earth to a planetary \r\nholocaust. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Colombia for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Alvaro Uribe Vélez, President of the Republic \r\nof Colombia, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.  \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Dmitry Medvedev, President of the \r\nRussian Federation \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Russian Federation. \r\n Mr. Dmitry Medvedev, President of the Russian \r\nFederation, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Dmitry Medvedev, President of the Russian \r\nFederation, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Medvedev (spoke in Russian): Today, \r\nspeaking from this high rostrum, I would like to \r\nhighlight five topics that are, in my view, important to \r\nall of us and our common approaches to the \r\ninternational agenda. \r\n The first is the timing of this meeting and the \r\nmoment that humankind is currently experiencing. This \r\nsession of the General Assembly is taking place at a \r\nvery critical and complex time. It can be said without \r\nexaggeration that we are living through one of the \r\nwatershed moments of modern history. Besides the \r\neconomic crisis — the first large-scale crisis of the era \r\nof globalization — global development as a whole \r\ncontinues to be threatened by regional and local \r\nconflicts, terrorism, cross-border crime, food shortages \r\nand climate change. The impact of the crisis continues \r\nto be felt by most countries of the world. Although so \r\nfar we have been able, it seems, to avoid the very worst \r\nscenarios, the question remains: how to overcome the \r\nhuge imbalances and deficits — amounting to trillions \r\nof dollars — accumulated in the global and national \r\neconomies. \r\n Our collective agenda for unification has been \r\ndictated by life itself, which also dictates the growing \r\nneed for the United Nations as a time-tested \r\nmechanism for harmonizing the interests of different \r\nStates and peoples. As never before, we are feeling the \r\nneed for informal collective leadership and for an \r\nincreased role for such platforms as the G-8 and the \r\nmore recent G-20, as well as other negotiation and \r\nmediation forums, and all the more because these \r\noperate not on a model of opposition, but rather to \r\nadvance the converging interests of their participants. \r\n At this morning’s meeting, the President of the \r\nUnited States addressed this Assembly, and I would \r\nlike to endorse one of the thoughts he voiced. He stated \r\nthat no single country can or should attempt to \r\ndominate others, and that is absolutely true. However, \r\nthese agreed approaches need to be implemented in \r\nsome way, including through the United Nations \r\nsystem. \r\n Another distinctive feature of modern times is the \r\nincreasing role of regional entities, which are growing \r\nmore active on every continent. This trend is entirely \r\nconsistent with the principles of the United Nations. \r\nRussia, for its part — together with its partners in the \r\nCommonwealth of Independent States, in the \r\nframework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, \r\nand with its fellow BRIC countries Brazil, India and \r\nChina — will continue to bolster the mechanisms of \r\nregional interaction. These mechanisms facilitate a \r\ncollective response to common threats, while \r\nmitigating the consequences of the crisis for our \r\ncitizens and increasing the sustainability of our \r\nnational economies. \r\n Secondly, I want to touch on the issue of existing \r\nproblems. Allow me to dwell on those that cannot be \r\neffectively addressed without the participation or \r\noutside the framework of the United Nations. The first \r\ntask in this regard is to address the imbalance of \r\nexisting mechanisms of global economic governance, \r\nthe inadequacy of their rules of the game, and the \r\nchasm between the financial markets and the real \r\neconomy. We need to make joint efforts to establish \r\nfinancial and economic models that will protect all of \r\nus from such turmoil in the future. \r\n Virtually all countries have seen a drop in output \r\nand in the standards of living of millions of their \r\n A/64/PV.4\r\n \r\n17 09-52228 \r\n \r\ncitizens. The crisis has exacerbated social problems, \r\npainfully tested young people at the very start of their \r\nlives, and caused significant growth in unemployment \r\nin all countries. Russia is no exception in this. \r\n A painful blow has been delivered to our plans to \r\nalleviate poverty. A real threat of disruption of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals has emerged. We must \r\ndo our utmost to prevent such a development. Donor \r\nassistance to countries in need cannot be postponed \r\nuntil some other time. The tasks set out as a priority by \r\nthe international community must absolutely be \r\naddressed. The arrangements adopted at the G-20 \r\nsummits and the United Nations Conference on the \r\nWorld Financial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on \r\nDevelopment must be implemented — and they must \r\nbe implemented within the deadlines that we ourselves \r\nset. \r\n The second major task in this context is to \r\naddress the issues of global energy security. Three \r\nyears ago at the Saint Petersburg G-8 summit in \r\nRussia, the principles for a new legal framework for \r\nsuch cooperation were formulated. The goal is to \r\nharmonize the interests of all participants in the energy \r\nchain: suppliers, consumers and intermediaries or \r\ntransiters. It was not so long ago that we solidified \r\nthese principles, and we invite all States to engage in \r\ndiscussion on them. We believe that such discussions \r\nshould be conducted with the active involvement of \r\nspecialized multilateral institutions, including, of \r\ncourse, the agencies of the United Nations family. \r\n The third task that Russia deems to be potentially \r\ncritical is the comprehensive strengthening of the \r\nUnited Nations itself. The United Nations must adapt \r\nitself in a rational way to the new global realities. It \r\nshould strengthen its influence while preserving its \r\nmultinational nature and the integrity of the Charter’s \r\nkey provisions. The most important component of the \r\nrevitalization of the United Nations is reform of the \r\nSecurity Council. The time has come to speed up the \r\nsearch for a compromise formula for the Security \r\nCouncil’s expansion, and of course to increase its \r\nefficiency. \r\n The third issue I want to touch on is \r\ndisarmament. The process of multilateral disarmament \r\nunder United Nations auspices is an extremely \r\nimportant task. There are grounds for hope since, as \r\nmembers are aware, a number of positive trends have \r\nemerged in overcoming the protracted crisis. The \r\nConference on Disarmament in Geneva has adopted its \r\nprogramme of work. I should also like to mention the \r\nRussian-Chinese initiative to develop a treaty to \r\nprevent the deployment of weapons in outer space, as \r\nwell as our current proposal to universalize the \r\nRussian-American Treaty on the Elimination of \r\nIntermediate-range and Shorter-range Missiles. \r\n Russia will unswervingly follow the path of \r\nverifiable and irreversible reductions in nuclear \r\nweapons as an essential element of a new start in our \r\nrelations with the United States. In Moscow in July this \r\nyear, President Obama and I not only signed a relevant \r\ndocument, but also agreed on a mandate for further \r\nnegotiations to elaborate a new, legally binding treaty. \r\nThis treaty should replace the Treaty on the Reduction \r\nand Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, which \r\nexpires in December. \r\n Of special importance here is the relationship \r\nbetween strategic offensive and defensive arms. In my \r\nmeeting with President Obama this morning, we \r\ndiscussed the recently announced adjustments to the \r\nUnited States’ planned development of a missile \r\ndefence system. I should like to state in this highest of \r\nforums that we view this decision as a constructive step \r\nin the right direction, which has deservedly received \r\nnumerous expressions of support from the international \r\ncommunity. Russia is ready to engage in detailed \r\ndiscussions with the American side and to undertake \r\nrelevant initiatives in this field in order to reach \r\nmutually acceptable agreement. \r\n Without resolving such problems as missile \r\ndefence and non-nuclear strategic offensive arms, it \r\nwill be simply impossible to achieve real progress in \r\nthe field of nuclear disarmament. I believe that the \r\nwork on this new treaty will be fully consistent with \r\nrelevant provisions of the joint document endorsed by \r\nthe President of the United States and myself at our \r\nmeeting in Moscow. \r\n We believe that other nuclear States should join \r\nthe disarmament efforts of Russia and the United \r\nStates. There is no need to wait for further progress in \r\nthe Russian-American disarmament process. We can \r\nbegin forthwith to elaborate acceptable and practical \r\narrangements that take into account the differences in \r\nthe size of potentials. In that respect, we could draw on \r\ninternational experience in the twentieth century, for \r\nexample the 1921-1922 Washington Conference on \r\nnaval armaments, where participants agreed on the \r\nA/64/PV.4  \r\n \r\n09-52228 18 \r\n \r\nmaximum size of their fleets without insisting on parity \r\nin absolute terms. If we take the same approach today, \r\nbased on the current status of nuclear arsenals, we \r\ncould send the rest of the world a sure signal that the \r\nunaccounted numbers will be added to the equation of \r\nstrategic stability. \r\n Pursuing nuclear disarmament, strengthening the \r\nnuclear non-proliferation regime and promoting the \r\npeaceful use of nuclear energy will be at the very heart \r\nof the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \r\n(NPT). We cherish the hope that it will be successful. \r\n The global nuclear security summit scheduled for \r\nApril 2010 will provide a good opportunity for a more \r\ndetailed discussion of these issues. We support that \r\ninitiative. We have also agreed with the United States \r\nAdministration on joint steps for further progress on \r\nsuch aspects of nuclear security as the prevention of \r\nnuclear terrorism, expanding access to the benefits of \r\npeaceful nuclear energy to all signatories implementing \r\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons in good faith, and other decisions. We call for \r\ncollective cooperation on these matters. \r\n In order to reach a common understanding on \r\nsuch important issues, we must engage all nations  \r\nand influential international organizations in the \r\naforementioned negotiation processes. The international \r\ncommunity, it must be said, has at its disposal such \r\ntried and tested measures for enhancing regional and \r\ninternational security as nuclear-weapon-free zones. In \r\nparticular, there is a very pressing need to establish a \r\nzone in the Middle East free of all types of weapons of \r\nmass destruction and their means of delivery. This is a \r\nlong-standing issue, with respect to which a resolution \r\nwas adopted at the 1995 NPT Review Conference. \r\n Russia, as a member of the Quartet of \r\ninternational mediators on the Middle East settlement, \r\nhas consistently supported efforts to strengthen the \r\nnuclear non-proliferation regime in the Middle East. \r\nRussia has made specific proposals within the \r\nframework of the NPT review process to seek mutually \r\nacceptable ways of implementing earlier decisions on \r\nthis matter. All countries of the region need to take an \r\nactive stance on this issue and demonstrate their \r\nwillingness to achieve that end. \r\n We also need to accelerate work towards a \r\nmechanism to ensure peace and security in North-East \r\nAsia. Russia has made proposals in this regard to the \r\nparticipants in the Six-Party Talks. In the present \r\ncircumstances, this task is more urgent than ever. \r\n The fourth topic I wish to address is that of \r\nregional conflicts and regional security. We intend to \r\ncontinue to participate in the search for effective \r\noptions for settling regional conflicts. We are \r\nconvinced that the use of force can only exacerbate \r\nsuch situations. That was demonstrated by the reckless \r\nattempt by the Georgian authorities last year to resolve \r\nthe problems in their relations with South Ossetia by \r\nmilitary means. \r\n At that time, in August 2008, we came very close \r\nto a situation in which a local armed conflict had the \r\npotential to grow into a full-scale war. I am certain that \r\nthis is clearly understood by everyone in this Hall \r\ntoday. In order to ensure that this should never recur, \r\nwe need clear and effective mechanisms to implement \r\nthe principle of the indivisibility of security. Without \r\nsuch a mechanism, we will not be able to move beyond \r\nthe legacy of the past or overcome existing prejudices. \r\nI wish to stress that irresponsible regimes should not \r\nhave any opportunity whatsoever to foment disputes \r\namong other countries. \r\n The role and place of the modern nation in \r\nensuring global security is a topic of the greatest \r\nrelevance today. We have witnessed situations time and \r\nagain in which problems emerging within the confines \r\nof an individual State have acquired a regional or even \r\nglobal character. The incompetence and, very often, \r\nineffectiveness of national Government institutions can \r\nhave consequences that are fraught with risks for \r\nseveral countries. The prevention of such an outcome \r\nis of course a very complex and sensitive issue, but one \r\nupon which we must deliberate together. \r\n These issues were the focus of discussions at a \r\nrecent conference held in Russia. The outcome was \r\nquite clear. What we require in the future is a smart \r\nforeign policy. The current global crisis is not limited \r\nto economics; it is also a crisis of ideas. It is the \r\naccumulation of a critical mass of outdated policies \r\nand development models. \r\n Having developed the initiative to sign a new \r\nEuropean security treaty, Russia has proposed taking a \r\nfresh approach to this problem and, above all, \r\nabandoning outdated policies. We all hope that the cold \r\nwar has been left behind, but the world has not become \r\nmore secure. What we need today are modern solutions \r\nand clear legal frameworks for implementing existing \r\n A/64/PV.4\r\n \r\n19 09-52228 \r\n \r\npolitical commitments. We do not need declarations, \r\nappeals or demagogues; what we need are clear legal \r\nframeworks, including to enshrine the principle under \r\ninternational law that one must not seek to ensure one’s \r\nown security at the expense of the security of others. \r\n Our initiative concerns the Euro-Atlantic space. \r\nHowever, its key provision on the indivisibility of \r\nsecurity is a universal principle that is applicable to all \r\nregions of the world and is fully consistent with the \r\nletter and spirit of the United Nations Charter. The \r\nprinciple of the indivisibility of security should be an \r\nintegral part of current international law. \r\n Values are the last issue that I wish to mention \r\nfrom this rostrum. The protection of human rights and \r\ninterests and the universal application of commonly \r\nrecognized norms and principles in that area should be \r\nthe basis for strengthening trust and stability in \r\ninternational relations. We are all united by values that \r\nare rooted in morality, religion, customs and traditions. \r\nI am talking about such fundamental concepts as the \r\nright to life, tolerance of dissent, responsibility towards \r\none’s family, charity and compassion, which are the \r\nfoundation both of daily life and of relations among \r\nStates. \r\n However, unfortunately, it is the reality that the \r\nworld is witnessing growing nationalism and numerous \r\nmanifestations of religious intolerance and hatred. That \r\nis why we believe that establishing a high-level group \r\non interfaith dialogue under the Director-General of \r\nUNESCO is extremely valuable. It is particularly \r\nrelevant on the eve of 2010, which the United Nations \r\nhas declared International Year for the Rapprochement \r\nof Cultures. \r\n To conclude, I cannot fail to mention, as I stand \r\nhere, another topic that is very close to the heart of all \r\ncitizens of our country and all peoples of the world. \r\nNext year, we are going to celebrate the sixty-fifth \r\nanniversary of the end of the Second World War. \r\nRussia put forward a proposal to adopt a relevant \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution and to hold a special \r\nsession to commemorate all victims of that war in May \r\nnext year. We cannot allow its horrible lessons to be \r\nforgotten. \r\n However, from time to time we see neo-fascist \r\norganizations raise their heads. Racial, national and \r\nethnic crimes are being committed. Attempts are being \r\nmade to whitewash Nazism, to deny the Holocaust and \r\nto review the decisions of the Nuremberg Tribunal. I \r\nam convinced that strong and joint resistance to \r\nmanifestations of neo-Nazism and to attempts to revise \r\nthe results of the Second World War enshrined in the \r\nUnited Nations Charter should remain a priority task of \r\nthe Organization. \r\n The creation of the United Nations was one of the \r\nprincipal achievements of the international community \r\nin the twentieth century. This Organization and its \r\nfruitful activities have become a symbol of the \r\ntwentieth century, and there is simply no alternative to \r\nthese activities. We have no right to forget that the \r\nUnited Nations possesses unique international \r\nlegitimacy, and we all must preserve and strengthen \r\nthis shared wealth of the peoples of the world. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Russian Federation for the statement \r\nhe has just made. \r\n Mr. Dmitry Medvedev, President of the Russian \r\nFederation, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Jacob Zuma, President of the \r\nRepublic of South Africa \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of South Africa. \r\n Mr. Jacob Zuma, President of the Republic of \r\nSouth Africa, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Jacob Zuma, President of the Republic of South \r\nAfrica, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Zuma: This year marks the twentieth \r\nanniversary of the adoption, in 1989, of General \r\nAssembly resolution 44/27 A, on international \r\nsolidarity with the liberation struggle in South Africa. \r\nThat was one of numerous Assembly resolutions in \r\nwhich the nations of the world pledged their support \r\nfor the eradication of apartheid. \r\n Within months of the adoption of that important \r\nresolution, the ban on South African liberation \r\nmovements was lifted. Nelson Mandela and other \r\npolitical prisoners were released. The stage was thus \r\nA/64/PV.4  \r\n \r\n09-52228 20 \r\n \r\nset for the negotiations that would eventually lead to \r\nthe achievement of freedom and democracy in our \r\ncountry. \r\n The role of the United Nations in the struggle to \r\nend apartheid is an exceptional example of the \r\ncollective political will of the international community. \r\nIt represented the victory of unity over division and of \r\nnegotiation over confrontation. It represented a clear \r\ncommitment to the promotion of basic human rights. \r\nAs South Africans, we will always be grateful for that \r\ninternational solidarity. \r\n Since the advent of democracy in 1994, we have \r\nbuilt a solid, stable democracy, founded on the \r\nprinciples of unity, non-sexism, non-racialism and \r\ndemocracy. As we continue to build our young nation, \r\nwe are cognizant of the need for a conducive \r\ninternational environment. For that reason, we are \r\ncommitted to playing our part, with the rest of the \r\ninternational community, in taking forward the fight \r\nagainst poverty and in responding to the crises that are \r\nconfronting the world today. We must act now, \r\ntogether, to halt the degradation of the environment. \r\nWe must act now, together, to prevent the global \r\neconomic crisis from undoing the gains that we have \r\nachieved over decades. \r\n The eradication of poverty must remain central to \r\nthe work of the United Nations. The Organization must \r\ncontinue to work harder to unite the world to work to \r\nalleviate the suffering of the world’s poor and \r\nmarginalized. The global economic meltdown has dealt \r\na heavy blow to world efforts to eradicate poverty. But \r\nit should not diminish our resolve. \r\n The United Nations must play a significant role \r\nin finding solutions to the global economic crisis. The \r\ncrisis should not be an excuse to delay further action \r\non the delivery of the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nRather, it should urge us to double our efforts to \r\nachieve greater and faster progress. Developing \r\ncountries did not cause the economic crisis, but they \r\nare severely affected by it. The crisis has further \r\nhighlighted the urgent need for fundamental reform of \r\nthe Bretton Woods institutions, including their \r\nmandate, scope, governance and responsiveness. \r\n These institutions have been unrepresentative \r\nsince their formation half a century ago. The current \r\narrangements are inadequate and unfair. They do not \r\nreflect the changes that have taken place in the global \r\neconomy. We should ensure that the election of the \r\nheads of all those institutions is more democratic, and \r\nopens opportunities to developing countries. The \r\nemerging and developing countries, including the \r\npoorest, must have a greater voice and greater \r\nparticipation in those institutions. Similarly, if we are \r\nto eradicate poverty there is an urgent need to conclude \r\nthe Doha Round of trade negotiations in a manner that \r\nprioritizes development. \r\n We continue to work for an African renewal, and \r\nwelcome the ongoing support of the United Nations \r\nsystem in addressing the challenges facing the \r\ncontinent. Now more than ever, it is necessary for the \r\nUnited Nations to ensure that the international \r\ncommunity collectively implements the commitments \r\nmade to Africa. We have a viable socio-economic \r\ndevelopment blueprint, the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development, which should be used in \r\nmobilizing resources for Africa. We appreciate that \r\nthere can be no lasting peace without development, and \r\nno development without security. \r\n Over the past 20 years, Africa has made much \r\nprogress in working to end conflicts and to promote \r\ndemocratic practices and institutions. However, some \r\npockets of conflict persist. For its part, South Africa \r\nhas been engaged in mediation, conflict prevention and \r\npeacekeeping on the continent, in, among other places, \r\nBurundi, Zimbabwe and the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo. \r\n The African Union has the political will to \r\nresolve conflicts on the continent. However, it lacks \r\nresources to run effective peacekeeping interventions \r\nand conflict prevention mechanisms. We appeal for \r\nsupport for African peacemaking efforts, and for \r\ngreater cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe African Union. In this regard, we call on the \r\nGeneral Assembly to align itself with resolutions of the \r\nAfrican Union and the Southern African Development \r\nCommunity that do not recognize Governments that \r\ncome into power by force or other unconstitutional \r\nmeans. \r\n The search for global peace, stability and security \r\ncannot be separated from the pursuit of justice, \r\nself-determination, human rights and economic \r\ndevelopment. We need to constantly reaffirm the \r\ninalienable human rights of all people. We call for the \r\nfull and effective implementation of the outcomes of \r\nthe World Conference against Racism and the \r\nsubsequent Durban Review Conference. It is of \r\n A/64/PV.4\r\n \r\n21 09-52228 \r\n \r\nconcern that at the close of the first decade of the \r\ntwenty-first century there are still nations that find \r\ntheir lands occupied and their peoples oppressed.  \r\n We are convinced that urgent and concrete steps \r\nare needed to resolve the situation in Western Sahara. \r\n We must work with similar urgency towards the \r\nachievement, through negotiations, of peaceful \r\ncoexistence between Israelis and Palestinians. This \r\nmust be based on the creation of a viable Palestinian \r\nState, existing side by side with Israel, within the 1967 \r\nborders, which must be secure and internationally \r\nrecognized. \r\n We also call for the lifting of the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo on Cuba. \r\n We also appreciate the recent pronouncements by \r\nsome nuclear-weapon States on their intention to \r\nreduce their nuclear arsenals. \r\n Let us take up this new momentum and utilize the \r\nopportunity of the 2010 Review Conference of the \r\nParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) to recommit ourselves to the \r\nfull implementation of obligations under the NPT. We \r\nshould ensure a balance among the objectives of \r\ndisarmament, non-proliferation and the peaceful use of \r\nnuclear energy. \r\n For Africa, the impact of climate change is \r\ndevastating and will severely undermine development \r\nand poverty eradication efforts. We need to act now to \r\nensure that there is an inclusive, fair and effective \r\nglobal agreement on this critical challenge. The \r\nagreement must recognize that solving the climate \r\nproblem cannot be separated from the struggle to \r\neradicate poverty. Developed countries bear the \r\ngreatest responsibility for climate change and its \r\nimpact. We must therefore strike a balance between \r\nadaptation and mitigation. Our goal should be to \r\nsignificantly reduce emissions across the globe without \r\nconstraining development in the countries of the South. \r\n Ms. McClean (Barbados), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n Developed countries must make ambitious, \r\nquantified and legally binding emission reduction \r\ncommitments that are in line with science and that \r\naddress their historical responsibilities. At Copenhagen, \r\nthere needs to be agreement on new, additional, \r\nsustainable and predictable financing for adaptation. \r\nThis should be for programmes that reduce the \r\nvulnerability of developing countries to the effects of \r\nclimate change. \r\n In a world that is increasingly interconnected and \r\ninterdependent, international problems can be resolved \r\neffectively only through multilateral cooperation. The \r\nUnited Nations must continue to be at the centre of \r\nmultilateralism, but it needs to be reformed if it is to \r\ncarry out its mandate effectively, efficiently and \r\ntransparently. \r\n We remain committed to the view that no reform \r\nof the United Nations can be complete without the \r\nfundamental reform of the Security Council. It must be \r\nrepresentative of the international community and \r\nreflect the geopolitical realities of today. If the Security \r\nCouncil is not reformed and does not have permanent \r\nrepresentation for Africa, the legitimacy of the \r\nCouncil’s decisions will continue to be questioned. \r\nSouth Africa continues to advocate an expansion in \r\nboth the permanent and non-permanent categories of \r\nmembership. \r\n Let me express our appreciation to the world for \r\nthe celebration of the inaugural Nelson Mandela Day \r\non 18 July this year. Scores of people engaged in a \r\nminimum of 67 minutes of voluntary action in the \r\nservice of humanity, in honour of our icon, President \r\nMandela. The Non-Aligned Movement has joined the \r\ncall for this General Assembly to declare 18 July \r\nNelson Mandela Day. This would be in recognition of \r\nPresident Mandela’s contribution to the struggle for \r\ndemocracy and the cause of humanity, and to promote \r\ncommunity service across the globe. In this regard, we \r\nhope that the General Assembly will adopt a consensus \r\nresolution in support of Nelson Mandela Day. \r\n South Africa is privileged to host the 2010 \r\nFédération Internationale de Football Association \r\nWorld Cup in the middle of next year, which will be \r\nthe first time that the tournament has been held on \r\nAfrican soil. We look forward to hosting the peoples of \r\nthe world, who will enjoy unique African hospitality \r\nand vibrancy. \r\n I wish to take this opportunity to thank the \r\noutgoing President of the General Assembly for his \r\nleadership at the sixty-third session of the Assembly. I \r\nthank the General Assembly and representatives for the \r\nopportunity to address this esteemed gathering. \r\nWorking together as a global family, we can do more to \r\ncreate a better and just world. \r\nA/64/PV.4  \r\n \r\n09-52228 22 \r\n \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof South Africa for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Jacob Zuma, President of the Republic of \r\nSouth Africa, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Václav Klaus, President of the  \r\nCzech Republic \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Czech \r\nRepublic. \r\n Mr. Václav Klaus, President of the Czech \r\nRepublic, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Václav Klaus, President of \r\nthe Czech Republic, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\n President Klaus: My country, the Czech \r\nRepublic, has always appreciated the role that the \r\nUnited Nations has played in strengthening security, \r\nstability and prosperity in the world. I want to assure \r\nMembers that we will continue to participate in the \r\nactivities of the United Nations. We firmly believe in \r\nthe importance of this Organization and want it to be \r\nefficient and effective. For that reason, we support the \r\nreform of the Security Council so that it will more \r\nadequately reflect the political and economic realities \r\nof the world today, as some speakers have stressed here \r\ntoday. Changes are necessary and we are ready to start \r\ndiscussing them very seriously. \r\n This year, in our part of the world, we \r\ncommemorate 20 years since the fall of communism, \r\nsince the moment when my country — together with \r\nother States of Central and Eastern Europe — regained \r\nfreedom and sovereignty, and was again able to resume \r\nthe place in the community of free and democratic \r\ncountries that it enjoyed when the United Nations was \r\nfounded in 1945. \r\n In the 20 years that have passed since those \r\nhistoric events, we succeeded in building a stable \r\npolitical democracy and in transforming our economic \r\nsystem into a functioning free-market economy. I am \r\nmentioning this because I believe that our experience is \r\nrelevant to the ongoing discussions about how to solve \r\nthe economic problems that the world faces today. \r\n We are meeting at a time when the world is in the \r\nmidst one of the deepest economic crises since the \r\nSecond World War. The financial crisis, which \r\noriginated in the United States two years ago, quickly \r\nspilled over into most other countries and led to a \r\nsevere decline in economic activity all over the world, \r\na substantial decrease in international trade and capital \r\nflows and an increase in social and economic \r\ninstability in a large number of countries on all \r\ncontinents. \r\n The United Nations — as a unique worldwide \r\nOrganization — and its specialized institutions have \r\nbecome an important global platform for discussing \r\nalternative steps and policies that could, one hopes, \r\nhelp to overcome the crisis and diminish its impact. \r\nThe measures that have been implemented to date have \r\ncontributed to the fact that the world has succeeded in \r\navoiding a repetition of the situation in the 1930s. We \r\nalso succeeded in avoiding a repetition of a massive \r\nprotectionist reaction to the crisis. Protectionism in all \r\nits forms should be resolutely condemned here today. \r\n We see the first signs that the economic crisis has \r\nreached bottom, or come close to it. Nevertheless, we \r\nfind ourselves at the beginning of a difficult and very \r\ncomplicated post-crisis period. There are many reasons \r\nfor the fragility and vulnerability of this phase, but I \r\nshould like to refer to just a few. \r\n First, attempts to increase aggregate demand led \r\nto unprecedented expansion in public expenditure and \r\npublic debt. As a result, a large number of United \r\nNations Member States are facing or approaching a \r\ndebt trap. Those huge fiscal deficits will harm future \r\neconomic growth. Secondly, international flows of \r\nprivate capital, which contributed so substantially to \r\nrapid economic growth in recent decades, are \r\ndecreasing and becoming less reliable. Thirdly, a \r\ndecrease in international trade will undermine the \r\ncontinuation of export-oriented strategies of many \r\nemerging markets. \r\n It would be a tragic mistake to fundamentally \r\nimpair economic freedom in favour of State or \r\nsupra-State regulation just now. Long-term experience \r\nshows us that it is thanks to free markets and free \r\nentrepreneurship that we enjoy the current material \r\nwell-being and economic progress. Business cycles, \r\naccompanied by economic downturns, recessions and \r\n A/64/PV.4\r\n \r\n23 09-52228 \r\n \r\ncrises, did exist, do exist and will exist in the future. In \r\nspite of them, the world has been — at least in the past \r\ntwo centuries — characterized primarily by economic \r\ngrowth and growing prosperity.  \r\n When looking for an appropriate reaction to the \r\nproblems connected with the current crisis, we should \r\nbuild on the idea that the crisis was basically a failure \r\nof Governments, not of markets. The manipulation of \r\nmonetary policy in an attempt to artificially prolong \r\nthe period of growth, the irrational subsidization of \r\ndemand in the housing sector and the failures in \r\nfinancial-market regulation contributed substantially to \r\nthe crisis. Let us not delude ourselves into believing \r\nthat economic cycles and their consequences can be \r\nprevented by more extensive Government regulation or \r\nby aiming at global governance of the world economy. \r\n This issue has its important territorial and \r\ngeographic aspects as well. We have to pay attention to \r\nthe needs and interests of all kinds of countries — rich \r\nand poor, developed and developing. Global economic \r\ndevelopment will benefit from the removal of barriers, \r\nnot from creating new ones, because barriers would \r\nsubstantially complicate poorer countries’ access to \r\nforeign markets, as well as their ability to develop by \r\ntheir own means. \r\n Economic recession and large increases in public \r\ndebt have reduced the possibilities available to today’s \r\nworld to meet such goals as combating climate change. \r\nI do not intend to go into details of this issue here now, \r\nbut we should carefully follow it because of unfinished \r\nscientific debate and pay attention to the costs and \r\nbenefits of our future decisions. \r\n I do, however, want to emphasize that the \r\nmeasures proposed to combat climate change represent \r\nanother heavy burden for both developed countries, \r\nwhich are falling into deep fiscal deficits now, and for \r\ndeveloping countries. This is happening in a context in \r\nwhich rich countries, often pushing this agenda at \r\ninternational forums, are losing their ability to \r\ncompensate poorer countries for the impact of those \r\nadditional costs. \r\n The Czech Republic, as a successor State to \r\nCzechoslovakia, which was one of the founding \r\nMembers of the United Nations, has always \r\nparticipated actively in all kinds of United Nations \r\nactivities. It intends to do so in the future as well. It is \r\nin our interest that the Organization remains a \r\nrespected high-level forum that contributes to \r\nprosperity, stability and peaceful solutions to the \r\nconflicts of today’s world. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Czech \r\nRepublic for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Václav Klaus, President of the Czech \r\nRepublic, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Carlos Mauricio Funes Cartagena, \r\nPresident of the Republic of El Salvador \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nEl Salvador. \r\n Mr. Carlos Mauricio Funes Cartagena, President \r\nof the Republic of El Salvador, was escorted into \r\nthe General Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Carlos Mauricio Funes \r\nCartagena, President of the Republic of El Salvador, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Funes Cartagena (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nwould first of all like to thank Mr. Miguel d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann of the sister Republic of Nicaragua for his \r\nwork during the sixty-third session of the General \r\nAssembly. I would also like to convey our \r\ncongratulations to Mr. Ali Treki on his election as \r\nPresident of the Assembly at its sixty-fourth session, as \r\nwell as to wish him every success in his efforts. We \r\nwould also like to thank Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon for his leadership of the United Nations. \r\n A little more than three months ago, by changing \r\nits Government after two decades under the same \r\npolitical party, El Salvador began a process to expand \r\nand strengthen its democracy. The new Government \r\nhas set just a few, but overarching, goals aimed at \r\nbeginning a process of change that pulls the country \r\nout of its economic crisis and its social and cultural \r\nbackwardness while establishing the foundation for the \r\nfull development of its productive potential, including \r\nsocial integration and fair distribution of its income, as \r\nwell as making it possible to achieve peace and \r\nsecurity, which is our greatest challenge. We have set \r\nout the major outlines of my Administration in three \r\nwords: unite, grow and include. \r\nA/64/PV.4  \r\n \r\n09-52228 24 \r\n \r\n First of all, the Government over which I preside \r\nis not based on a single political party, let alone on a \r\nsingle faction. It is a Government of national unity \r\nfocused on two main goals. The first is to put an end to \r\nthe confrontations, hatred and divisions that have \r\ndrained a significant amount of vigour from our society \r\nand fuelled a bloody civil war that has left behind \r\npainful scars. The second is to put in place the \r\nfoundation for peaceful and secure coexistence. \r\n That means that major national decisions will no \r\nlonger be taken behind closed doors or out of sight of \r\nthe majority of our people. Every measure, every step \r\nin El Salvador will be discussed and decided at the \r\ntable through dialogue. Seated at that table will be \r\nrepresentatives of the production and labour sectors, as \r\nwell as of social movements, non-governmental \r\norganizations, political parties, churches and academia. \r\nIt is untrue that the demands of administration require \r\ncurtailing dialogue as the basic instrument of the \r\ndecision-making process. \r\n We were able to set up our economic and social \r\ncouncil in barely 100 days. That body is charged with \r\nproposing and considering social and economic \r\npolicies that will allow us to successfully address the \r\ncrisis we are experiencing. In the same period, we were \r\nalso able to launch an ambitious low-income housing \r\nprogramme that is unprecedented in El Salvador’s \r\nhistory. That programme, which was the result of \r\nGovernment working with the private sector, will \r\nproduce 100,000 jobs. Work has already begun in the \r\nfirst projects.  \r\n That undertaking, like others in the area of social \r\nand productive infrastructure, also helps to promote \r\ntemporary work for young people at risk and to \r\nimprove the housing and community conditions in the \r\npoorest areas. It is also part of the comprehensive \r\nanti-crisis plan that I promised during my campaign, \r\nwhich we are carrying out through enormous effort. \r\n Also in less than 100 days, we succeeded in \r\nexpanding the social safety net and the provision of \r\nassistance for the poorest families in 100 rural \r\nmunicipalities. Upon my return to the country, we will \r\nlaunch the first safety net, involving social and \r\nemployment services in urban communities \r\nexperiencing extreme poverty. We are responding \r\npromptly to the urgent needs of the most excluded, \r\nimpoverished and neglected groups in our society. I \r\nshould like to reiterate that all this is being done \r\nthrough an honest and wide-scale dialogue that \r\nincludes the entire social spectrum of El Salvador. \r\n We have resolutely addressed the concerns \r\nresulting from changes in power. It was once believed \r\nthat changes in Government would lead to instability \r\nand uncertainty. The complete opposite happened. We \r\nhave given legal guarantees and clear examples that the \r\nnew Government is serious, responsible in managing \r\nfinances and trustworthy when it comes to both \r\ndomestic and foreign affairs, including as regards \r\nmultilateral organizations and friendly countries \r\nextending assistance to El Salvador. \r\n In that connection, allow me to thank the \r\ncountries and groups for that assistance. Their \r\ngenerosity makes us even more determined to follow \r\nthe path of responsibility, austerity and anti-corruption \r\nefforts throughout society and Government. \r\n My country has open wounds that have an impact \r\non our daily lives, including on our family, social and \r\ncultural lives. Those wounds include public safety and \r\nimmigration, which has taken about 3 million of our \r\nfellow citizens abroad in search of the work and \r\nopportunities they have not found in our homeland.  \r\n I should first like to speak briefly about \r\ninsecurity. \r\n As the Assembly is aware, this is not an \r\nexclusively Salvadoran phenomenon. While it is a \r\nglobal problem, it is certainly more pronounced in our \r\nregion. Organized crime, drug trafficking and the \r\nactivities of violent criminal youth gangs have \r\ndeveloped in the past decade to become the worst \r\nthreat to the stability of our countries. The policies that \r\nhave been implemented jointly and within individual \r\ncountries have not merely fallen short; they have been \r\nbut a succession of failures. That means that we must \r\nincrease our joint efforts while using all the means and \r\nintelligence at our disposal to confront those scourges. \r\nWe are faced with a structural phenomenon that \r\nhampers the full normal functioning of our societies. \r\n In that regard, I am completely convinced that we \r\nmust have strong, long-term, decisive and intelligent \r\npolicies within our countries. However, we will fully \r\ndefeat crime only if we unite as a single entity that is \r\ngenuinely determined to defeat organized crime, which \r\nis a destructive element that undermines institutions \r\nand saps the creative and productive energies of our \r\npeoples. \r\n A/64/PV.4\r\n \r\n25 09-52228 \r\n \r\n I have said to my fellow citizens, and I should \r\nlike to reiterate here, that my Government will do \r\neverything the law allows to combat crime with \r\ndetermination and courage. However, this is not a task \r\nfor a single president or Government; it is also one for \r\nsociety as a whole. I have therefore called for the \r\nwidest possible level of participation from all groups \r\nand people of good will in carrying out what is called \r\n“the good fight”, referred to by the Apostle Paul in his \r\nfirst letter to Timothy — a good fight against \r\ninsecurity, fear and hopelessness. That is the great \r\nchallenge that brings us together, let us make no \r\nmistake. \r\n I should like to propose the holding of an \r\ninternational conference to address these problems in \r\norder to consider best practices with which to confront \r\nthat battle together. To that end, we would require the \r\nlogistical and financial support of both the \r\nOrganization of American States and the United \r\nNations. \r\n The other wound to which I referred is the \r\nongoing waves of immigration by Salvadoran men and \r\nwomen that have been taking place for many years. All \r\nthose who have left have been in their productive \r\nyears, the most skilled, seeking the work, security and \r\nwell-being denied them in their own country. With \r\n3 million Salvadorans abroad, remittances equal about \r\n18 per cent of our gross national product. That tearing \r\napart of families is difficult to overcome. It is also a \r\nconstant reminder of the fact that we have not been \r\nable to put in place the necessary conditions to keep \r\nour children home, as well as of the fact that we will \r\nnever be able to achieve our potential, individually or \r\nas a society, unless we heal this terrible wound. \r\n I have personally raised the flag of our country’s \r\nfull democratization, which means that emigrants \r\nshould have access to the vote that has been denied \r\nthem to this day. That unjustifiable denial is added to \r\nthe pain of separation and the loss of human rights to \r\nwhich they are subjected as immigrants. \r\n I have called on political parties, intellectuals, \r\nacademics and judges to draft the outlines of a national \r\npolitical accord that advances the necessary reforms to \r\nexpand and strengthen democracy, increase \r\ntransparency in the workings of political parties, \r\nimprove the administration of national elections law \r\nand — as a key element of my appeal — ensure the \r\nright to vote for our brothers and sisters abroad. \r\n We are concerned, moreover, not only by the \r\nunstable situation of migrants living abroad with no \r\nlegal status, suffering constant uncertainty and fear of \r\nbeing deported, but also by the difficult situation they \r\nare currently experiencing as a result of the global \r\nfinancial and economic crisis. For this reason a policy \r\nfor the inclusion and protection of the rights of our \r\nmigrant population and their families is a priority for \r\nus. We will be undertaking measures within and with \r\ncountries of transit and destination countries to \r\nguarantee migrants’ rights everywhere in the world, \r\nand in particular the rights of our Salvadorian brothers. \r\nWe will emphasize an integrated and long-term \r\napproach to addressing migration, considering all its \r\ncauses, manifestations and effects. We will bring this \r\nvision to the process initiated at the High-level \r\nDialogue on International Migration and Development, \r\nand we pledge our participation at the third Global \r\nForum on Migration and Development, to take place in \r\nAthens. \r\n My Government is carrying out a foreign policy \r\ngeared towards strengthening and broadening \r\nrelationships of friendship and cooperation with all \r\ncountries of the world, both at the bilateral and \r\nmultilateral levels, based on solidarity, mutual respect \r\nand compliance with the principles of peaceful \r\ncoexistence, such as respect for sovereignty, territorial \r\nintegrity, non-interference in internal affairs, the \r\nnon-use or threat of use of force, the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes, respect for the right to \r\nself-determination and respect for international law and \r\ninternational commitments, in accordance with the \r\nprinciples and purposes of the United Nations Charter. \r\n The foreign policy of El Salvador is free from \r\nideological or partisan political stances. In good faith it \r\nis guided not only by national interests and priorities \r\nbut also by the common goals and interests of the \r\ninternational community, in particular the quest for and \r\npromotion of peace, political dialogue, cooperation in \r\nsolidarity, security and sustainable development. One \r\nexample of this is the restoration of diplomatic \r\nrelations between El Salvador and Cuba, which \r\novercame a lingering breach in our country’s \r\nhemispheric relations. I also wish to underscore that a \r\nfurther key objective of my Government is to \r\nstrengthen the ties that we have with our brother \r\ncountries in Central America. \r\n In this context, I am certain that there will be no \r\nsolution or future for any of our countries if we act in \r\nA/64/PV.4  \r\n \r\n09-52228 26 \r\n \r\nisolation from each other. We long ago emerged from \r\nthe era of nationalities, and we are now ready to \r\nembark on a new phase, one of greater integration. In \r\nthis regard the European Union is perhaps the most \r\nadvanced example. \r\n I appeal to my Central American colleagues to \r\nconsider this point. There are many pending issues that \r\nwe must address. There are common challenges that we \r\nmust face shoulder to shoulder. We have everything to \r\ngain and nothing to lose in the full integration of our \r\nregion. In these years of the bicentenary we must \r\nregain the free and independent spirit of our ancestors, \r\nwhich was exemplified in the concept of a Central \r\nAmerican union as a basis for development, well-being \r\nand peace for our peoples. A first step would be to \r\nconvene a summit that would focus on a balanced \r\nintegration process and an analysis of greater transfer \r\nof competencies to strengthen the mechanisms of \r\nsupra-nationality, in order to further the aims and \r\nprinciples established in the Tegucigalpa Protocol, to \r\nensure its credibility and viability. \r\n Among the aims, of course, would be to \r\nstrengthen regional democratic institutions, helping us \r\nto avoid occurrences such as the Honduran coup d’état, \r\nof which members are all well aware. Working together \r\nwe must ensure that it will be impossible to return to \r\nthe times of authoritarianism or military or civilian-\r\nmilitary dictatorships. The coup d’état in Honduras \r\nmust not be allowed to set a precedent which will \r\njeopardize the achievements that we have reached in \r\nterms of regional stability and democratic institutions. \r\nThe de facto Government in our brother country has \r\nignored the clamour of voices raised by the \r\ninternational community, calling for Honduras to return \r\nas quickly as possible to constitutional order through \r\ndialogue and political negotiation in accordance with \r\nhuman rights and the fundamental freedoms of the \r\nHonduran people. \r\n Until the Constitution is restored in Honduras \r\nthrough the immediate reinstatement of President \r\nZelaya and the creation of a government of national \r\nunity in keeping with the San José Agreement, the \r\nelectoral process currently being prepared in our \r\nbrother country will lack the legitimacy or \r\ntransparency necessary to guarantee reliable results \r\nwhich might help resolve the crisis in our brother \r\ncountry. \r\n The United Nations has played and will play a \r\nleading role in the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security and in the promotion of democracy and \r\ndevelopment. El Salvador is a leading example: the \r\nOrganization helped in reaching the Peace Agreements \r\nthat succeeded in resolving our internal conflict — a \r\ncontribution for which I am deeply grateful, because it \r\nled us from war to peace and from peace to a phase of \r\ntransition to democratization and development. In this \r\nregard we will engage in a major review of the \r\ninternational agenda in order to set priorities and to \r\nensure compliance with the key guidelines issued by \r\nthis global Organization and which benefit the well-\r\nbeing and dignity of our peoples. We are implementing \r\npolicies that are geared towards meeting the \r\ncommitments we have entered into at major \r\ninternational conferences, in particular the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and the promotion and full \r\nprotection of human rights. We will also be joining \r\ninternational agreements aimed at strengthening human \r\nrights and freedoms. \r\n We believe in the role that the United Nations has \r\nplayed in the field of cooperation and development, \r\nand we reiterate our support for the reform of its \r\nprincipal organs, programmes and subsidiary bodies, \r\nwhich will allow the Organization to adapt to the \r\ndemands and complexities of new challenges, in \r\nparticular through the interrelationship and interaction \r\nthat exist among political, economic, social, \r\nenvironmental and security phenomena. \r\n Thus we commit ourselves to strengthening our \r\nnational system for the protection of human rights and \r\nto promoting and guaranteeing a policy of justice, truth \r\nand compensation for serious infringements of human \r\nrights, by implementing a policy of openness, honesty \r\nand transparency in public affairs. \r\n The effects of the international crisis that broke \r\nout last year have been felt by all, but especially by \r\npoor and developing countries whose economies are \r\ndependent on large markets and that suffer from the \r\nconsequences of the decline of economic activity, \r\nemployment and consumption. Given this situation, \r\ninternational solidarity and cooperation take on \r\nextreme importance for developing countries, which \r\nhave limited natural and financial resources and are \r\nvery vulnerable. In this regard we call upon the \r\nindustrialized countries and on the donor community to \r\njoin every international effort and initiative to \r\novercome the current challenges, which jeopardize \r\n A/64/PV.4\r\n \r\n27 09-52228 \r\n \r\nachievements made to date and future progress for \r\nhumankind. \r\n We recommend taking full advantage of the \r\nexperience and expertise within the United Nations \r\nsystem in fostering international cooperation and \r\ncoordinating efforts to achieve common goals. In this \r\ncontext we appeal particularly to developed countries \r\nto ensure follow-up, support for and implementation of \r\nthe recommendations and commitments set out in the \r\nMonterrey Consensus and the Follow-up International \r\nConference on Financing for Development to Review \r\nthe Implementation of the Monterrey Consensus that \r\ntook place in Doha in 2008, as well as the \r\nrecommendations contained in the Outcome of the \r\nConference on the World Economic and Financial \r\nCrisis and Its Impact on Development (resolution \r\n63/303, annex), in particular the need for donors to \r\nmaintain and fulfil their commitments and objectives \r\nwith regard to official development assistance. To that \r\nend, there is a need for political resolve to reform the \r\ninternational financial structure and system in order to \r\naddress the current difficulties. \r\n The high-level meeting on climate change \r\nconvened by the Secretary-General provided us with an \r\nopportunity to consider that issue, especially with \r\nrespect to compliance by States, and in particular the \r\nindustrialized countries, with the provisions of the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange, which was adopted shortly before the Earth \r\nSummit, and with later commitments to eliminate the \r\ndanger posed by environmental degradation and \r\nongoing activities that have exacerbated climate \r\nchange. We therefore hope that we will act in earnest, \r\nresponsibly and decisively at the Copenhagen \r\nconference to achieve a new agreement in this area so \r\nas to ensure that States do not put their own interests \r\nbefore the common well-being of humankind. It is time \r\nto adopt measures and mechanisms to rectify the \r\nmistakes and shortcomings of the past, and to launch a \r\nprocess to bring development into harmony with \r\nenvironmental protections. \r\n As participants here are aware, in my country we \r\nhave done away with ideological prejudices and \r\nstereotypes in our international relations. We believe in \r\nmultilateralism and in particular in the systems of our \r\ncontinental organization, the Organization of American \r\nStates, and of the United Nations. We believe in the \r\nrich and valuable contribution that new and emerging \r\nnations can make to the work of those two systems. We \r\nbelieve that the future of humankind largely depends \r\non the intelligence, honour and generosity of the larger \r\nnations in ensuring the full and fair development of \r\nemerging countries so as to put an end to the \r\ndiscrimination and differences that offend human \r\nnature. \r\n I thank the General Assembly for its attention and \r\nits support for my country and the Salvadoran people. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof El Salvador for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Carlos Mauricio Funes Cartagena, President \r\nof the Republic of El Salvador, was escorted from \r\nthe General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nEquatorial Guinea. \r\n Mr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, President \r\nof the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema \r\nMbasogo, President of the Republic of Equatorial \r\nGuinea, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Obiang Nguema Mbasogo (spoke in \r\nSpanish): At the outset, allow me to congratulate \r\nMr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, Minister of African Union \r\nAffairs of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, on his \r\nunanimous election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-fourth session. We are convinced \r\nthat, guided by his Government’s adherence to the \r\nprinciples of national independence and sovereignty, \r\nthe primacy of the values of the human individual, the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, and \r\nthe economic development of all countries, and with \r\nhis well-known diplomatic skills, he will contribute to \r\nthe good management of the Assembly and to ensuring \r\nthat the United Nations achieves the universal \r\nobjectives of peace, stability and global development. \r\n We also express our thanks to Mr. Miguel \r\nd’Escoto Brockmann, Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nthe Republic of Nicaragua, for his outstanding work at \r\nA/64/PV.4  \r\n \r\n09-52228 28 \r\n \r\nthe sixty-third session, at a time when the world was \r\nshaken by an acute financial and economic crisis the \r\nconsequences of which have fomented instability and \r\nthreatened peace in various regions of the world. \r\n Mr. Singh Puri (India), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n Amid this climate of insecurity, the food and \r\nglobal energy crises, natural disasters and climate \r\nchange that threaten the sustainability of the global \r\necology, the work of the Secretary-General, as the \r\ncoordinator of the activities of our Organization, has \r\nbeen far from easy. We therefore commend Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon for his efforts to address those issues and \r\noffer him our full support and cooperation so that his \r\nactions can be implemented without delay. \r\n In taking the floor to address this international \r\nforum, I wish first and foremost to express our \r\ngratitude for this renewed opportunity to share our \r\nthoughts, experience and common concerns for the \r\nmodern world. It is timely indeed that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has dedicated the sixty-fourth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly to the topic of effective responses to \r\nthe current global economic and financial crisis in \r\norder to analyse its causes and adopt policies and \r\nstrategies that will enable States to mitigate the \r\nnegative consequences of the crisis, which are having \r\nan increasingly debilitating impact on economically \r\nweak countries in particular. \r\n Following the end of the cold war and the \r\ndisappearance of the bipolar and antagonistic world \r\nthat emerged from the Second World War, it became \r\nclear that a more globalized, united and integrated era \r\nhad dawned among nations that would result in greater \r\njustice, solidarity and integration in international \r\nexchanges and relations. Mutual respect for cultural \r\nspecificities remains the fundamental basis for \r\ninternational cooperation, an association of shared \r\nresponsibilities, mutual respect and equitable mutual \r\nbenefit. That has been the guiding ideal of the United \r\nNations since its inception. Its efforts to create a world \r\nof peace, development and well-being for humankind \r\nhave followed this aim for the sixty-plus years of its \r\nhistory. \r\n Yet the gap between developed and developing \r\ncountries has only widened, in spite of the numerous \r\nresolutions, decisions and recommendations that have \r\nbeen adopted to promote the equality of political, \r\neconomic, social and cultural rights; the global \r\ndevelopment of humanity; the replacement of the old \r\neconomic order with a new, more just and equitable \r\nsystem; the provision of financial assistance to the \r\nmost vulnerable countries; the liberalization of global \r\ntrade; and in spite of the many other measures  adopted \r\nat special summits. \r\n Yet, despite all this, global achievement of the \r\nUnited Nations Millennium Development Goals has \r\nfallen short by  20 per cent. We can see that, \r\nunfortunately, egoism and the desire to dominate \r\nremain the driving force in international relations. \r\nInevitably, without a multilateralism that respects the \r\ncriterion of partnership based on mutual respect for \r\nshared responsibilities and reciprocal and equitable \r\ninterests, the global political, economic and social \r\nbalance is undermined. Inevitably, unless this \r\npartnership is based on respect for the cultural values \r\nof every nation, a new cold or hot war is bound to \r\nbreak out between poor countries and rich countries. \r\n The Republic of Equatorial Guinea welcomes the \r\ntimeliness of this debate, since in the middle of this \r\nunprecedented global crisis we can all redefine our \r\npositions on the subject of global development. Here, \r\nin New York in 2009, we must resolve these problems \r\nso that the current causes of a misery and \r\nconflictiveness driven by the wealthy countries to the \r\ndetriment of the poor or economically fragile countries \r\nno longer justify this new and absurd bipolarization — \r\nwhen, despite everything, humankind has assimilated \r\nthe supremacy of the values that make up the human \r\nindividual. \r\n What kind of morality is it when some States \r\nenjoy economic abundance, while others suffer in \r\nmisery, marginalization and desolation? \r\n Accordingly, the Republic of Equatorial Guinea \r\ncalls for new global approaches that will enhance the \r\ncapacity of developing countries to contribute \r\npolitically and economically and will allow a \r\ncoexistence that safeguards the political and economic \r\ninterests of all countries.  \r\n We can no longer continue on the path that we are \r\non. We can no longer continue on this irrational and \r\nirresponsible path. We must consider matters calmly in \r\norder to adopt positive attitudes that effectively support \r\nthe original philosophy of the United Nations, a \r\nphilosophy that conceived of a united world where \r\nhuman beings, regardless of race, culture or level of \r\n A/64/PV.4\r\n \r\n29 09-52228 \r\n \r\ncivilization, are recognized as human beings, in both \r\nthe North and the South.  \r\n Thus, there can be no justification for theories of \r\nglobalization of policies unless they respect the \r\ncultural plurality that characterizes the peoples of the \r\nworld. There can be no discrimination or exclusion. \r\nIntercultural dialogue must strengthen this community \r\nof nations with a view to achieving a coexistence that \r\nis conducive to learning from one another for the \r\nmutual benefit of us all. \r\n Equatorial Guinea conceives of its development \r\nas the outcome of coordinated action between national \r\neffort and international cooperation. We rule out \r\ndiscrimination of any kind for reasons of political, \r\neconomic or cultural system in the case of any country \r\nor international organization, provided that the latter \r\nrespects our country’s independence, national \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity, the peace and free \r\nexercise of the sovereignty of the people, the right to \r\nthe free utilization of our natural resources, the \r\nmaintenance of friendly relations and cooperation for \r\nreciprocal benefit, and respect for the cultural values of \r\nthe people. \r\n Through its application of these principles, \r\nEquatorial Guinea enjoys excellent ties of friendship, \r\ncooperation and good neighbourliness with all \r\ncountries in Central Africa. We accept economic \r\ncooperation with countries of all ideological beliefs, \r\nfrom the East to the West and from the North to the \r\nSouth. This is part of our contribution to global peace \r\nand balance. \r\n As a result, our oil and other resources contribute \r\nnot only to the development of our European partners, \r\nbut also to that of Africa, America and Asia. This being \r\nsaid, we are constantly amazed by the conflictiveness, \r\nsuspicion and envy that these oil resources arouse in a \r\nnumber of countries, these same resources that we have \r\nmade freely available to the international community. \r\nWe witnessed this first-hand when Equatorial Guinea \r\nwas the victim of mercenary-led invasions, terrorist \r\nattacks and plans for political destabilization, whose \r\nclear aim was to gain illegal access to resources which \r\nbelong solely to the people of Equatorial Guinea. \r\n We wish to emphasize that Equatorial Guinea is a \r\npeaceful country without ambitions to acquire territory \r\nor engage in political hegemony and without policies \r\ndesigned to jeopardize peace or stability in other States \r\nand nations. We reaffirm our commitment to the \r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter and the \r\nCharter of the African Union with regard to the \r\nmaintenance of peaceful relations, the rejection of \r\nviolence and the peaceful resolution of disputes \r\nthrough dialogue, mediation and, where necessary, \r\nrecourse to international tribunals. \r\n Global peace is the universal right of all and an \r\nindispensable prerequisite for the survival of \r\nhumankind. It is non-negotiable, not to be traded with \r\nany public or private interest, and is so fragile that it \r\ncan be shattered when injustices affecting a State or a \r\ncommunity of States are committed. Therefore, we are \r\naddressing the situation caused by the global economic \r\ncrisis, which, without a doubt, has had repercussions in \r\nindividual States of the international community, each \r\nat different levels and each with the potential to affect \r\nglobal peace. We have witnessed examples of such \r\nconsequences in the recent conflicts that have engulfed \r\nvarious States in the world today. Yet, this noble world \r\nOrganization was created for peace.  \r\n It is for the sake of maintaining peace and world \r\nstability that we all meet here every year. It is also for \r\nthe sake of peace and stability that we must be careful \r\nnot to the let the attitudes of some countries or groups \r\nof countries foster, out of whatever ambitions or \r\nselfishness they have, continuing injustices that have \r\ncreated the crisis in international relations. \r\n With best wishes for a world abundant in peace \r\nand happiness, I wish every success to this sixty-fourth \r\nsession of the General Assembly. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Equatorial Guinea for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n Mr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, President \r\nof the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Leonel Fernández Reyna, President \r\nof the Dominican Republic \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Dominican \r\nRepublic. \r\n Mr. Leonel Fernández Reyna, President of the \r\nDominican Republic, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\nA/64/PV.4  \r\n \r\n09-52228 30 \r\n \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Leonel Fernández Reyna, \r\nPresident of the Dominican Republic, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly. \r\n President Fernández Reyna (spoke in Spanish): \r\nWe convey our warmest congratulations to the \r\nrenowned Libyan diplomat Mr. Ali Treki on his recent \r\nelection to preside over the General Assembly at this \r\nsixty-fourth session, as well as for his call for a \r\ndialogue among civilizations, for interreligious \r\nunderstanding, for the promotion for peace and \r\nsecurity and for closing the divide between rich and \r\npoor. \r\n Exactly one year ago, when we were taking stock \r\nof progress made towards meeting the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals at the midterm point, something \r\nunexpected occurred: the collapse of some of the most \r\nemblematic investment banks, and with that the \r\nworsening of the global financial crisis.  \r\n Before this crisis occurred, however, the world, in \r\nparticular the developing countries, was already \r\naffected by the impact of two other crises that had \r\nbegun simultaneously: the crisis involving oil prices \r\nand that involving food prices. \r\n As a result of the first of these crises, that is, the \r\noil crisis, vigorous and intense social protest broke out \r\nin various parts of the world. Suddenly, all products \r\nbecame more expensive. Governments were forced to \r\nuse their currency reserves to pay their oil bills and \r\nwere forced to allocate subsidies for the sake of \r\nmaintaining civic peace and democratic governance.  \r\n When it comes to the second crisis, the food \r\ncrisis, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the \r\nUnited Nations established that as a result of the food \r\ncrisis, the number of people suffering from hunger \r\nworldwide rose by 150 million, which meant that for \r\nthe first time in human history the total figure \r\nexceeded the number of 1 billion human beings.  \r\n Before these two crises broke out, the World \r\nBank had already indicated that in order to meet the \r\nMillennium Development Goals in the remaining seven \r\nyears — that is, between 2008 and 2015 — \r\n$250 billion were still needed, or $50 billion every \r\nyear. Obviously, with the outbreak of these crises, \r\nwhich gravely affected the economies of developing \r\ncountries, the resources needed to meet the objectives \r\nthat had been set to cut by half the level of poverty \r\nworldwide would have to be increased significantly \r\nabove the projected figures established by the World \r\nBank. \r\n As one can see, the situation last year was already \r\nbleak at the time of submitting for analysis and \r\nevaluation the achievements that had been made and \r\nfuture challenges to meet in order to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. In spite of the dark \r\nclouds that were gathering on the global economic \r\nhorizon, we still felt optimistic; we held the illusion \r\nthat we might meet our targets. After all, we had made \r\ncontinuous progress towards meeting some of the \r\nGoals. But from then on, we witnessed the deluge of \r\nthe global financial crisis. Since then, the storm has \r\nbeen so intense that it has created a widespread state of \r\nanxiety and fear at a global scale the likes of which has \r\nnot been seen in many decades.  \r\n According to the Director-General of the World \r\nHealth Organization, Dr. Margaret Chan, 400,000 more \r\nchildren and tens of thousands of women will die every \r\nyear as a direct consequence of the global financial \r\ncrisis. Today, while the meetings of the General \r\nAssembly of the most important global organization \r\nare being held, 25,000 children will die in various parts \r\nof the world. That is the equivalent of saying that a \r\nchild will die every three seconds, or 18 children every \r\nminute.  \r\n By the time I conclude my statement this \r\nafternoon — my 15 minute statement — worldwide \r\n270 children will have died, whose early deaths could \r\nhave been avoided. Throughout the course of this year, \r\n9 million children, which is equivalent to the entire \r\npopulation of my country, the Dominican Republic, \r\nwill have lost their lives for no reason or justification. \r\nThis represents a human tragedy of epic proportions, a \r\ntrue catastrophe. It is morally and politically \r\nunacceptable. For that reason, it is important to call \r\nupon the General Assembly to declare a state of \r\nemergency with regard to compliance with the \r\nMillennium Development Goals.  \r\n When facing the challenges to our efforts to meet \r\nthe eight goals established in the year 2000 for \r\nimproving the human dignity and living conditions of \r\nmillions of people worldwide, it is possible to adopt \r\ndifferent attitudes. We might consider that we have \r\nfailed and that these goals can never be met; that they \r\nrepresent a new utopia and therefore the only path \r\n A/64/PV.4\r\n \r\n31 09-52228 \r\n \r\nremaining is to abandon any effort to meet those goals. \r\nClearly that would be a cowardly and irresponsible \r\nattitude — the worst possible decision. It would mean \r\nleaving all those in need of human solidarity and \r\ncompassion out in the cold. A second attitude would be \r\nto reconsider the goals and then extend the timetable to \r\nfulfil them; that would seem logical and reasonable. \r\nHowever, that reasoning encounters one obstacle — the \r\nfact that children, the poor and the women of the world \r\ncannot wait. \r\n The only real way to ensure fulfilment of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals by the planned 2015 \r\ndate, is for the General Assembly to work towards \r\npromoting true commitment among nations and \r\ngovernmental and non-governmental institutions to \r\nurgently assume their task to achieve economic and \r\nsocial development for all people affected by poverty, \r\nhunger, disease and illiteracy. \r\n It cannot be argued that the resources available to \r\naddress this urgent task are insufficient. We have seen \r\nin the diligent manner used to address the collapse of \r\nthe international financial system that — as the saying \r\ngoes — where there is the will there is a way. \r\n Looking ahead, the first thing to be considered is \r\nthat with the forecasted end of the global economic \r\nrecession and the resulting gradual recovery of \r\neconomic growth, we must ensure that we never again \r\nwitness such a sudden and abrupt increase in oil and \r\nfood prices as a result of excessive speculation and the \r\ntransactions of the futures market. We issue this \r\nwarning because we have been observing with concern, \r\nan increase in milk prices over the past three weeks on \r\nthe international market that have risen by more than \r\n$1,000 per ton without any valid justification.  \r\n We must set aside all individual interests, \r\nresistance and obstacles that stand in the way of the \r\nreform of the global financial system and the stock \r\nmarkets, in order to establish new mechanisms for \r\nregulation and supervision that will guarantee that no \r\ncrisis such as this one will ever occur again. \r\n Because of the lack of compliance to date by the \r\nmajority of developed countries with their \r\ncommitments made during the Copenhagen World \r\nSummit for Social Development to contribute to the \r\ndevelopment of the poorest and most vulnerable \r\nnations and due to the prevailing situation of the global \r\nrecession, we draw the attention of the General \r\nAssembly to the possibility of finding new sources of \r\nfinancing for the Millennium Development Goals.  \r\n In that regard, we suggest the creation of a \r\nworking group to carry out professional, high-quality \r\nresearch and submit a report containing \r\nrecommendations and a plan of action geared towards \r\nestablishing a fine to benefit development on capital \r\ndeposited in fiscal havens, offshore banks and \r\ninternational financial centres. Placing financial \r\nresources in such fiscal havens means that every year \r\nwe witness tax evasion in a sum equivalent to \r\n$250 billion — a figure — according to the World \r\nBank — equal to the total sum of external aid \r\nnecessary to meet the Millennium Development Goals.  \r\n According to the Organization for Economic \r\nCooperation and Development (OECD), some \r\n$7 trillion is currently deposited in tax havens which \r\ndo not contribute one single cent towards fiscal \r\nincome. OXFAM has indicated that more than \r\n$50 billion in fiscal income slips through the fingers of \r\ndeveloping countries each year as a result of offshore \r\nbanks and tax havens. The organization Christian Aid \r\nhas also affirmed bleakly that tax evasion is \r\nresponsible for the deaths of more than 5 million \r\nchildren between the year 2000 and 2015 — the years \r\nwe set to meet the Millennium Development Goals. \r\n There are abundant resources in the world and \r\nwhat is happening is that they are unfairly and \r\nunequally distributed due, inter alia, to an existing \r\nglobal financial architecture marked by the lack of \r\ntransparency, secrecy, money-laundering, evasion and \r\nfraud. Our only hope of changing the current situation \r\nof economic decline and social deterioration and the \r\nmoral crisis that is shaking up the world lies in \r\nadopting brave, wise and timely decisions in this \r\nprestigious global forum. \r\n The peoples of the world are waiting for these \r\ndecisions. They are aware that their right to a dignified, \r\nhonourable and happy life depends upon that. We \r\ncannot let them down. We must act with justice \r\ncourage, a sense of history and with a vision of the \r\nfuture. \r\n I cannot conclude this statement without touching \r\nupon the current prevailing situation in Honduras. The \r\nUnited Nations passed a resolution condemning the \r\ncoup d’état which took place in this Central American \r\nnation in June of this year and called for the return of \r\ndemocratic order. The same attitude was adopted by the \r\nA/64/PV.4  \r\n \r\n09-52228 32 \r\n \r\nOrganization of American States, the European Union, \r\nthe African Union and by the League of Arab States. \r\nDespite the entire world’s condemnation of that assault \r\non democracy, the de facto Government of Honduras \r\nhas remained in power, thereby underscoring the \r\nweaknesses of the international community to take \r\naction.  \r\n President José Manuel Zelaya — the sole \r\nlegitimate President of Honduras, who was scheduled \r\nas the sixth speaker to take the floor in the General \r\nAssembly this afternoon — has, in a great display of \r\npersonal courage and daring, preferred to return to his \r\ncountry. It is now to be hoped that we the \r\nrepresentatives of the peoples gathered here at this \r\nworld forum will be able to act with the same dignity, \r\nsense of responsibility and level of commitment when \r\nit comes to the supremacy of democracy, freedom and \r\njustice. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the \r\nDominican Republic for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n Mr. Leonel Fernández Reyna, President of the \r\nDominican Republic, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, President \r\nof the Islamic Republic of Iran \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran. \r\n Mr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, President of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, \r\nPresident of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly. \r\n President Ahmadinejad (spoke in Farsi; English \r\ntext provided by the delegation): I thank Almighty God \r\nfor granting me the opportunity once again to address \r\nthis important international forum. \r\n At the outset, I wish to begin by congratulating \r\nMr. Ali Treki on his assumption of the presidency of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session, and to \r\nwish him every success. I would also like to extend my \r\nthanks to Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann, President \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-third session, for \r\nhis excellent stewardship of the work of the Assembly \r\nduring his term. \r\n Over the past four years, I have spoken about the \r\nmain challenges facing our world. I have talked about \r\nthe underlying causes of those challenges and about the \r\nneed for world Powers to review their outlook and \r\nwork out new mechanisms to address the pressing \r\ninternational problems before us. I have also talked \r\nabout the two conflicting outlooks that prevail in our \r\nworld. One is based on the predominance of its \r\nmaterialistic interests through spreading inequality and \r\noppression, poverty and deprivation, aggression, \r\noccupation and deception and looks to bring the entire \r\nworld under its control and to impose its will on other \r\nnations. That outlook has produced nothing but \r\nfrustration, disappointment and a dark future for \r\nhumankind as a whole. \r\n The other outlook is one that espouses a belief in \r\nthe oneness of the Almighty God, follows the teachings \r\nof His messengers, respects human dignity and seeks to \r\nbuild a secure world for all members of the human \r\ncommunity in which everybody can equally enjoy the \r\nblessings of sustainable peace and spirituality. This is \r\nan outlook that respects all human beings, nations and \r\nvenerable cultures in defiance of all types of \r\ndiscrimination in the world. It is also one that commits \r\nitself to an ongoing fight to promote equality for all \r\nbefore the law on the basis of justice and fraternity \r\nwhile laying a solid foundation to guarantee equal \r\naccess for all human beings in their quest to excel in \r\nknowledge and science. \r\n Time and again, I have emphasized the need to \r\nmake fundamental changes in the current outlook on \r\nthe world and on humankind, so as to be able to create \r\na brighter tomorrow. \r\n Today, I wish to share with the Assembly a few \r\npoints about the changes that should take place. First, \r\nthe continuation of the current circumstances in the \r\nworld is clearly impossible. The present inequitable \r\nand unfavourable conditions run counter to the very \r\nnature of humankind and move in a direction that \r\ncontravenes the truth and the goal behind the creation \r\nof the world. It is no longer possible to inject trillions \r\nof dollars of unreal wealth into the world economy \r\nsimply by printing worthless paper assets or by \r\n A/64/PV.4\r\n \r\n33 09-52228 \r\n \r\ntransferring inflation and social and economic \r\nproblems to others by creating severe budget deficits.  \r\n The engine of unbridled capitalism, with its \r\nunfair system of thought, has reached the end of road \r\nand is unable to move. The era of capitalist thinking \r\nand the imposition of one’s thoughts on the \r\ninternational community, which is intended to \r\ndominate the world in the name of globalization, as \r\nwell as the age of setting up empires, is over. It is no \r\nlonger possible to humiliate nations or to impose \r\ndouble standard on the world community. \r\n It is necessary to delegitimize and reject any \r\napproach that holds up the realization of the interests \r\nof certain Powers as the only measure of democracy or \r\nemploys despicable forms of intimidation and deceit in \r\nthe name of freedom and democratic practices. \r\nApproaches by which dictators are portrayed as \r\ndemocrats lack legitimacy and must be totally rejected. \r\nTime has come to an end for those who define \r\ndemocracy and freedom and set standards while they \r\nthemselves are the first to violate those fundamental \r\nprinciples. They can in fact no longer be both judge \r\nand executioner or challenge real democratically \r\nestablished Governments.  \r\n I would like to say again that the time has passed \r\nfor a group of people who believe that they alone can \r\ndefine concepts such as democracy and freedom and \r\nput forth the criteria for those definitions while \r\nsimultaneously violating the very principles to which \r\nthey claim to aspire. The continuation of Governments \r\nis based on the rule of the people. The development of \r\nnations and increasing freedom worldwide will no \r\nlonger allow them to continue their hypocrisy and \r\nvicious attitudes. For those reasons, most nations, \r\nincluding the people of the United States, are waiting \r\nfor real and profound change. They have welcomed \r\nand will continue to welcome change. \r\n How can it be possible that inhuman policies in \r\nPalestine have driven the entire population of the \r\ncountry from their homeland for over 60 years by \r\nmeans of force and coercion, attacking them with all \r\ntypes of weapons, including banned weapons, and \r\ndenying them their legitimate right of self-defence, \r\nand, to the astonishment of the international \r\ncommunity, calling the occupiers peacemakers and \r\nportraying the victims as terrorists? \r\n How can the crimes of the occupiers against \r\ndefenceless women and children and the destruction of \r\ntheir homes, farms, hospitals and schools be supported \r\nunconditionally by certain Governments and, at the \r\nsame time, oppressed men and women be subjected the \r\nharshest economic blockade, depriving them of \r\nresources to meet their basic needs, including food, \r\nwater and medicine, and leading to genocide? They are \r\nnot even allowed to rebuild their homes, destroyed \r\nduring the 22-day barbaric attacks of the Zionist \r\nregime, with winter approaching, while the aggressors \r\nand their supporters deceitfully continue their \r\nrhetorical defence of human rights in order to put \r\nothers under pressure. \r\n It is unacceptable for a small minority to \r\ndominate the politics, economy and culture of large \r\nparts of the world through complex systems, \r\nestablishing a de facto new form of slavery, and \r\nharming the reputation of other nations, even European \r\nnations and the United States, to achieve its racist \r\ngoals. \r\n It is unacceptable that nations several thousand \r\nmiles from the Middle East send their troops to \r\nintervene militarily and to promote war, bloodshed, \r\naggression, terror and fear in our region, the Middle \r\nEast, while brushing aside the protests of nations in the \r\nregion concerned about their future and their national \r\nsecurity, thereby violating peace and interfering in the \r\naffairs of others.  \r\n Such standpoints are baffling. We only have to \r\nlook at the situations in Iraq and Afghanistan. A \r\ncountry cannot remain under military occupation in the \r\nname of the fight against terrorism and drug \r\ntrafficking, when the production of illicit drugs has \r\ngrown, terrorism has increased and tightened its grip, \r\nthousands of innocent people have been killed, injured \r\nor displaced, infrastructure has been destroyed and \r\nregional security has been seriously jeopardized.  \r\n Yet those who have created the current disastrous \r\nsituation continue to blame others. How can they talk \r\nabout friendship and solidarity with other nations while \r\nthey expand their military bases in various parts of the \r\nworld, including Latin America. That situation cannot \r\ncontinue. It is increasingly impossible to promote \r\nexpansionist and inhuman policies on the basis of \r\nmilitaristic logic. The logic of coercion and \r\nintimidation will have dire consequences and \r\nexacerbate current global problems. \r\n It is not acceptable that the military budgets of \r\nsome Governments far exceed the budgets of entire \r\nA/64/PV.4  \r\n \r\n09-52228 34 \r\n \r\ncountries of the world. Some countries export billions \r\nof dollars of arms every year, stockpile chemical, \r\nbiological and nuclear weapons, establish military \r\nbases or have a military presence in other countries \r\nwhile accusing others of militarism, and mobilize all \r\ntheir global resources to impede the scientific and \r\ntechnological progress of other nations under the \r\npretext of countering arms proliferation. \r\n It is not acceptable that the United Nations and \r\nthe Security Council, whose decisions should represent \r\nall nations and Governments through the application of \r\ndemocratic and popular methods of decision-making, \r\nbe dominated by a few Governments who seek to serve \r\ntheir own interests.  \r\n Above all, in a world where culture, ideas and \r\npublic opinion should be the only determining factors, \r\nthe present situation cannot continue and a \r\nfundamental change seems inevitable. We must strive \r\nto establish a new world system. \r\n Secondly, any change must be deep-seated both \r\nin theory and in practice, encompassing all spheres of \r\nour life. Outdated methods of government that have \r\ncaused the current problems in society cannot be used \r\nto bring about change and create a better world. \r\nLiberalism and capitalism, in particular the types that \r\nseek to dominate the world and to alienate people from \r\nspiritual and moral values, will never bring humankind \r\nhappiness, since they are the principal source of all \r\ndisasters, wars, poverty and deprivation. We have all \r\nseen how unfair economic structures controlled by \r\ncertain political interests have been used to plunder the \r\nnational wealth of countries for the benefit of a group \r\nof corrupt businesses. Existing structures are thus \r\nincapable of addressing the challenges that we face. \r\nThe political and economic structures created after the \r\nSecond World War that sought to dominate the world \r\nhave failed, in short, to promote justice and lasting \r\nsecurity. \r\n Rulers whose hearts do not beat with love for \r\nhumankind and who have abandoned ideas of justice \r\ncan never provide humankind with the promise of \r\npeace and friendship. By the grace of God, Marxism is \r\nno more; it is history now. And the unhindered growth \r\nof capitalism will certainly meet the same fate because, \r\nbased on the divine tradition of a principle in the Holy \r\nKoran, the deceitful one, like a bubble on the surface \r\nof water, will disappear. Only that which eternally \r\nserves the interests of human societies survives. \r\n We must therefore all remain vigilant to prevent \r\nthe pursuit of colonialism and discriminatory and \r\ninhuman goals disguised under slogans for change or in \r\nany new format. The world needs to undergo \r\nfundamental changes, and we must all engage \r\ncollectively to bring them about in the right way. \r\nThrough such efforts, no one and no Government \r\nwould consider itself an exception to change or \r\nsuperior to others, or try to impose its will on others by \r\nproclaiming world leadership. \r\n Thirdly, all of the problems that exist in our \r\nworld today emanate from the fact that rulers have \r\ndistanced themselves from human values, morality and \r\nthe teachings of divine messengers. Regrettably, in the \r\ncurrent state of international relations, selfishness and \r\ninsatiable greed have taken the place of such \r\nhumanitarian concepts as love, sacrifice, dignity and \r\njustice. Belief in the one God has been replaced with \r\nself-belief. Some have sought to take the place of God \r\nand insist on imposing their values and wishes on \r\nothers. Lies have taken the place of honesty, hypocrisy \r\nhas replaced integrity and selfishness has taken the \r\nplace of sacrifice. Nowadays, deception in interactions \r\nis called foresight and statesmanship. Looting the \r\nwealth of other nations is called development efforts. \r\nOccupation is introduced as a gift in promotion of \r\nfreedom and democracy. And defenceless nations are \r\nsubjected to repression in the name of the defence of \r\nhuman rights. \r\n Global problems will be resolved, justice \r\nadministered and peace maintained only through the \r\ncollective determination and cooperation of all nations \r\nand States. The era of a world polarized by the \r\npremises of hegemony or the domination by a few \r\nGovernments is over. Today, we must rise together \r\nthrough collective commitment against the present \r\nchallenges. We must take change seriously and work \r\ncollectively to help others return to basic moral and \r\nhuman values. \r\n Messengers were sent by God to show the light of \r\ntruth to humankind. They came to make people aware \r\nof their individual and social obligations. Living in \r\npiety, having faith in Allah and judgment of human \r\nbehaviour or conduct in the next world, believing in \r\nthe primacy of justice in both lives, seeking happiness, \r\nwell-being and security in the happiness, well-being \r\nand security of others, respecting humankind, making \r\nefforts to expand love and compassion against \r\nhostility — these were all paramount in the teachings \r\n A/64/PV.4\r\n \r\n35 09-52228 \r\n \r\noffered by the divine messengers of God, from Adam \r\nto Noah, Noah to Abraham, Moses, Jesus Christ and \r\nthe last Prophet, Muhammad, may peace be upon all of \r\nthem. All of them came to eliminate war and \r\nignorance, eradicate poverty and uproot discrimination \r\nin order to spread happiness to the entire world. They \r\nare the best gifts that almighty God has granted to \r\nhuman beings. If the belief in Entezar — that is, in \r\npatiently awaiting the return of justice to Earth — can \r\nbecome a common goal and we join hands to achieve \r\nprosperity for all, then there will be greater and more \r\ngenuine hope for reform.  \r\n Fourthly, in my opinion, we have several \r\nimportant matters before us. The Secretary-General and \r\nthe General Assembly can take the lead by undertaking \r\nthe necessary measures to fulfil our shared goals on the \r\nbasis of the following actions. \r\n First, the United Nations should be restructured \r\nin order to transform this world body into an efficient \r\nand fully democratic organization, capable of playing \r\nan impartial, equitable and effective role in the \r\ninternational relations. The structure of the Security \r\nCouncil should be reformed, especially by abolishing \r\nthe discriminatory privilege of the veto right. The \r\ninalienable rights of the Palestinian people should be \r\nrestored by holding a referendum and free elections in \r\nPalestine to prepare an environment in which all \r\nPalestinian populations, including Muslims, Christians \r\nand Jews, can live together in peace and harmony. All \r\ntypes of interference in the affairs of Iraq, Afghanistan \r\nand the Middle East, as well as all countries of Africa, \r\nLatin America, Asia and Europe, must be ended. \r\n As our great Prophet said, a Government may \r\nsurvive with blasphemy, but never with oppression. \r\nThe Palestinians continue to suffer oppression and their \r\nrights continue to be violated. Yet another group of \r\nPalestinians who lived in al-Quds al-Sharif were forced \r\nout of their homes as the occupiers and usurpers \r\ncontinue to destroy their residential area. Bombings in \r\nAfghanistan and Pakistan have not yet stopped, the \r\nGuantanamo prison has not yet been shut down, and \r\nthere are still secret prisons in Europe. \r\n The continuation of the present situation adds to \r\nhostilities and violence. Oppression and military \r\naggression must be stopped. Regrettably, official \r\nreports concerning the brutalities of the Zionist regime \r\nin Gaza have not all been published. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the United Nations have crucial \r\nresponsibilities in this respect, and the international \r\ncommunity is impatiently waiting for the aggressors \r\nand the murderers of the defenceless people of Gaza to \r\nbe punished. \r\n Regarding the second action, current economic \r\nstructures must be reformed and a new international \r\neconomic order set up based on human and moral \r\nvalues and obligations. A new course is needed that \r\nwould help promote justice and progress worldwide by \r\nallowing the potential and talents of all nations to \r\nflourish, thus bringing well-being to all and for future \r\ngenerations. \r\n The third action is that international political \r\nrelations must undergo reform on the basis of \r\npromotion of lasting peace and friendship, the \r\neradication of arms races and the elimination of all \r\nnuclear, chemical and biological weapons to pave the \r\nway for all nations to have access to advanced and \r\npeaceful technologies for the advancement of the \r\nhuman race. \r\n The fourth action is that we should reform \r\ncultural structures, promote respect for the diverse \r\ncustoms and traditions of all nations and foster moral \r\nvalues and spirituality aimed at strengthening the \r\ninstitution of the family, which is the backbone of all \r\nhuman societies. \r\n For the fifth action, worldwide efforts must be \r\nmade to protect the environment and fully observe the \r\ninternational agreements and arrangements to prevent \r\nthe annihilation of nature’s non-renewable resources. \r\n My fifth point is that our nation has successfully \r\ngone through a glorious and fully democratic election, \r\nopening a new chapter for our country in the march \r\ntowards national progress and enhanced international \r\ninteractions. Once again, a large majority has entrusted \r\nme with this heavy responsibility.  \r\n And now, I want to declare that our great nation, \r\nwhich has made significant contributions both to world \r\ncivilization and to the Islamic Republic of Iran itself, \r\nand as one of the most democratic and progressive \r\nGovernments in the world, is ready to mobilize all its \r\ncultural, political and economic capabilities to engage \r\nin a constructive process aimed at addressing the \r\ninternational concerns and confronting the challenges \r\nthat face human society. Our country, the builder of \r\ncultures, has itself been a principal victim of blind \r\nA/64/PV.4  \r\n \r\n09-52228 36 \r\n \r\nterrorism and the target of all-out military aggression \r\nduring the first decade of its revolution. \r\n Throughout the past 30 years, we have been \r\nsubject to the hostile attitudes of those who at one time \r\nsupported, with all their might, Saddam’s military \r\naggression and his use of chemical weapons against us, \r\nand who at another time decided to take military action \r\nin Iraq to get rid of the same man. \r\n Today, our nation seeks to create a world in \r\nwhich justice and compassion will prevail. We \r\nannounce our commitment to participating in the \r\nprocess of building lasting peace and security \r\nworldwide for all nations, based on justice, spirituality \r\nand human dignity, while being dedicated to strongly \r\ndefending our legitimate and legal rights. \r\n To achieve those goals, our nation is prepared to \r\nwarmly shake all hands which are extended to us in \r\ngood faith. No nation can claim to be free of the need \r\nto change and reform in this journey towards \r\nperfection. We welcome real and humane changes and \r\nstand ready to actively engage in fundamental global \r\nreforms. \r\n Therefore, we emphasize that the only path to \r\ncontinued safety and security is to return to \r\nmonotheism and justice. That is the greatest hope and \r\nopportunity of all ages and generations. Without belief \r\nin God and commitment to the cause of justice, along \r\nwith the fight against injustice and discrimination, the \r\nworld structure will not be corrected. \r\n Man is at the centre of the universe. Man’s \r\nunique feature is his humanity, a humanity that seeks \r\njustice, piety, love, knowledge, awareness and all other \r\nhigher values. These human values should be \r\nsupported, and each and every fellow human being \r\nshould be given the opportunity to develop them. \r\nNeglecting any of them is tantamount to the omission \r\nof an essential aspect of humanity. These are common \r\nelements which connect all human communities and \r\nwhich constitute the basis of peace, security and \r\nfriendship. \r\n Divine religions pay attention to all aspects of \r\nhuman life, including obedience to God, morality, \r\njustice, fighting oppression and endeavouring to \r\nestablish just and good governance. The Prophet \r\nAbraham called for the oneness of God against \r\nNimrod, as the Prophet Moses did the same against the \r\nPharaohs. Jesus Christ and the Prophet Muhammad, \r\nmay peace be upon them, did the same against the \r\noppressors of their own time. All of these men were \r\nthreatened with death and were forced out of their \r\nhomelands. Without resistance and objection, the face \r\nof the Earth will not be rid of injustice. \r\n I turn now to my final point. The world is in \r\ncontinuous change and evolution. Mankind’s promised \r\ndestiny is the establishment of a pure humane life. This \r\nwill come about when justice prevails around the globe \r\nand when every single human being enjoys respect and \r\ndignity. That will be the moment when mankind’s path \r\nto moral and spiritual perfection will be opened and his \r\njourney to God and the manifestation of God’s divine \r\nnames will come to be. Mankind should strive to \r\nrepresent God’s knowledge and wisdom, his \r\ncompassion and benevolence, his justice and fairness, \r\nhis power and art, and his kindness and forgiveness. \r\n These will all come true under the rule of the \r\nperfect Man, the last divine source on Earth, Hazrat \r\nMahdi, peace be upon him. He will be an offspring of \r\nthe Prophet of Islam, who will re-emerge, and Jesus \r\nChrist, peace be upon him. Other noble and pious men \r\nwill accompany him in the accomplishment of this \r\ngrand universal mission. This is the belief in entezar: \r\nwaiting patiently for the Imam to return; waiting \r\npatiently for the rule of goodness and the governance \r\nof the best, which he promises. This is a universal \r\nhuman notion and a source of the hope of nations for \r\nthe betterment of the world. \r\n They will come, and with the help of righteous \r\npeople and true believers will realize man’s long-\r\nstanding desire for freedom, perfection, maturity, \r\nsecurity, tranquillity, peace and beauty. They will come \r\nto put an end to war and aggression and to reveal all \r\nknowledge to the world, as well as spirituality and \r\nfriendship. Yes indeed, mankind’s bright future will \r\ncome. \r\n In waiting for that brilliant time to come and in a \r\ncollective commitment, let us each do our part to pave \r\nthe way and prepare the conditions for building that \r\nbright future. Long live love and spirituality. Long live \r\npeace and security. Long live justice and freedom. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran for the statement he has just made. \r\n A/64/PV.4\r\n \r\n37 09-52228 \r\n \r\n Mr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, President of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Evo Morales Ayma, President of the \r\nPlurinational State of Bolivia \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Plurinational \r\nState of Bolivia.  \r\n Mr. Evo Morales Ayma, President of the \r\nPlurinational State of Bolivia, was escorted into \r\nthe General Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Evo Morales Ayma, \r\nPresident of the Plurinational State of Bolivia, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Morales Ayma (spoke in Spanish): \r\nOnce again, we meet at the United Nations to share \r\nconcerns, problems and experiences and to discuss the \r\nvarious ways in which we can serve our peoples \r\nworldwide. \r\n Since this morning I have listened closely to \r\nstatements, starting with that of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral — to whom I offer a special, revolutionary \r\ngreeting — until this moment, when we just heard the \r\nPresident of Iran. In all of these statements, there has \r\nbeen great convergence on problems such as the \r\nfinancial crisis, problems arising from the \r\nenvironmental crisis and problems concerning stability \r\nand institutionalization of democracies in a number of \r\ncountries. There have also been ideas and proposals \r\nsuch as those offered by the Secretary-General, who \r\ncalled for unity among Presidents and unity within the \r\nUnited Nations. I fully agree that it is important that \r\nwe Presidents and Governments unite to meet the \r\ndemands of our peoples, in order to resolve these \r\ncrises.  \r\n I would say that in my country the crises have \r\nbeen imposed from above and from outside. We need \r\nunity within the United Nations for the sake of the \r\nequality of our peoples; we need unity for dignity; we \r\nneed unity above all to tackle the deep economic \r\ndivergences, the deep asymmetries between continents, \r\nbetween families and between countries. But it must be \r\nunity in a context of complementarity, in order to meet \r\nour peoples’ demands.  \r\n There is an ongoing debate on the financial crisis \r\nand on climate change, as well as on the problems of \r\ndemocracy and the energy and food crises. I welcome a \r\nnumber of the statements that addressed and focused \r\non the origins of this crisis. But the majority of \r\nPresidents and the majority of the statements referred \r\nonly to the effects, not to the causes.  \r\n I would like to speak frankly to the Assembly — \r\nmy listeners here, and to all others who are following \r\nthe debates taking place in this global forum. I would \r\nlike to say that the origin of these crises was the \r\nunbridled accumulation of capital in a few hands, the \r\nirretrievable looting of natural resources and the \r\ncommercialization of Mother Earth. And above all, I \r\nbelieve their origin lies in an economic model, an \r\neconomic system, namely, capitalism.  \r\n If we do not tell our peoples the truth about the \r\norigin of this crisis, then we will be misleading \r\nourselves and the international community too. We will \r\nbe misleading our peoples, who have great \r\nexpectations of their Presidents and Governments and \r\nof forums such as this one.  \r\n Although we are promoting and seeking peace, in \r\nthe light of our experience, we know that we will not \r\nfind social peace while there is economic inequality, \r\nand all the less when there are military bases in some \r\ncountries. These may be located on many continents, \r\nincluding Latin America and South America. How can \r\nwe hold discussions when United States military bases \r\nprovoke distrust among peoples?  \r\n I would like to briefly tell the Assembly that I \r\nwas a victim of the military bases operating in my \r\ncountry before assuming the presidency, before the \r\nsocial movements were not merely opposed to policies \r\nbut also actors in a new country of equality and social \r\njustice. All of us were victims of the United States \r\nmilitary presence in Bolivia, and as victims we know \r\nwhat uniformed armed United States personnel can do \r\nin South American countries. For that reason, I would \r\nlike to say that when there is a United States military \r\nbase, particularly in Latin America — I do not know \r\nabout their conduct in Europe or on other continents, \r\nbut in Latin America, the presence of military bases is \r\nno guarantee of social peace or of democracy. \r\nCertainly, it cannot guarantee the integration of our \r\ncountries, much less of the peoples who are seeking to \r\nbring about deep-wrought changes in our social, \r\neconomic and cultural structures.  \r\nA/64/PV.4  \r\n \r\n09-52228 38 \r\n \r\n Now we have Honduras. If there is a United \r\nStates military base in Honduras, why can this military \r\nbase not guarantee democracy? It cannot because there \r\nare Presidents who change these countries, which are \r\nconstantly threatened by military bases. \r\n I hail the courage of our colleague, President \r\nZelaya of Honduras, who is democratically and \r\npacifically resisting with the aim of restoring \r\ndemocracy. My respect and admiration go to him as he \r\nstrives together with his defiant people to uphold \r\ndemocracy. How good it would be if the United \r\nNations, this great international organization, were to \r\nadopt a resolution issuing an ultimatum to the military \r\ndictatorship in Honduras to withdraw and restore the \r\nonly internationally recognized President. \r\n I am convinced that the United States Southern \r\nCommand does not accept Latin American countries or \r\ntheir Presidents that are seeking liberation. I have even \r\nheard from some friends, comrades and brothers that \r\nthey supported the dictatorships in Bolivia and \r\nelsewhere in Latin America. They say that the only \r\nreason there has been no coup d’état in the United \r\nStates is that there is no United States Embassy in the \r\nUnited States. There are coups d’état occurring \r\neverywhere, but let me say that in September last year \r\nthere was an attempted coup d’état in Bolivia, and \r\nthanks to the union forces and the involvement of the \r\ninternational community, particularly from the southern \r\ncone, we were able to halt that civilian — not \r\nmilitary — coup d’état.  \r\n For these reasons, we are convinced that military \r\nbases cannot guarantee democracy, integration or \r\nsocial peace.  \r\n We have also been discussing the subject of \r\nclimate change, and I would like to take this \r\nopportunity to propose a number of issues to the \r\nAssembly which are of the utmost importance for all of \r\nus who inhabit Mother Earth. For the indigenous \r\nmovement, this is Mother Earth — or, for many others, \r\nplanet Earth or the environment. For those of us who \r\nlive in harmony with Mother Earth, not just in harmony \r\nwith human beings, Mother Earth is something sacred. \r\nIt is Mother Earth which gives life, which provides \r\nwater, natural resources, oxygen. We all promote the \r\nwell-being of our peoples. We are struggling and \r\nfighting and working for the well-being of our peoples, \r\nbut first of all, we must ensure the well-being of \r\nMother Earth. \r\n If we cannot guarantee the well-being of Mother \r\nEarth, then it will be impossible to guarantee the well-\r\nbeing of our countrymen or of all the peoples on planet \r\nEarth. I have reached the conclusion that Mother \r\nEarth — or planet Earth — can and will exist forever \r\nwith or without human life. But human life cannot \r\nexist without planet Earth — Mother Earth. \r\n After having listened to many statements and \r\nafter having listened to my brothers, I have reached the \r\nconclusion that at this point in time, in this new \r\ntwenty-first century, it will be more important than \r\never before to defend the rights of Mother Earth than to \r\ndefend human rights. \r\n If we do not protect the rights of Mother Earth, \r\nthere will be no point in defending human rights. I am \r\nprepared to discuss this concept, and sooner or later \r\neveryone will understand why it is so important to \r\ndefend the rights of Mother Earth. \r\n As we are currently discussing climate change, I \r\npropose to Presidents, representatives and all our other \r\nbrothers and sisters who are listening throughout the \r\nworld our very simple, three-point proposal.  \r\n First, the developed countries must acknowledge \r\nand pay the climate debt that they and all humankind \r\nowe Planet Earth. \r\n Secondly, a court for climate justice must be \r\nestablished to try and to punish those who fail to meet \r\ntheir commitments and those who continue to damage \r\nPlanet Earth. We need a structure that can quantify the \r\ndamage caused by some countries and transnational \r\ncompanies, and therefore it is important that such a \r\ncourt for climate justice be established. \r\n The third proposal is one of those that have been \r\ndeveloped above all by rural and indigenous \r\nmovements: the United Nations must draw up a \r\ndeclaration of the rights of Mother Earth, in order to \r\ndefend the right to life, the right to the regeneration of \r\nbio-capacity, the right to a clean life and the right to \r\nharmony and the coexistence of us all. \r\n I hope that these proposals will be taken into \r\naccount during the discussions in Copenhagen. We also \r\nhope that Copenhagen will provide a grand solution to \r\nresolve the serious problems that affect us all, in all the \r\ncountries of the world. \r\n I also take this opportunity to take up some of the \r\nproposals made by a number of Presidents. If we want \r\n A/64/PV.4\r\n \r\n39 09-52228 \r\n \r\nto change the world, we must first change the United \r\nNations. If we want to effect change in our countries, \r\nseeking equality and dignity for our compatriots, why \r\nnot first change the structures of the United Nations? \r\n Listening to what many other Presidents said \r\nabout the Security Council, I felt that there were many \r\npoints of agreement. We need a real democratization of \r\nthe United Nations, for which I make the following \r\nsuggestions. \r\n The status of permanent membership of the \r\nSecurity Council and the right to veto must be \r\nabolished. It is not possible in the twenty-first century \r\nto maintain outdated totalitarian practices going back \r\nto the time of monarchies. All countries must have the \r\nsame rights within the United Nations. Those who \r\nproclaim themselves to be the leaders of democracy \r\nshould give up their privileges and accept true \r\ndemocratization of the Security Council. We must be \r\nresponsible with democracy and begin to democratize \r\nthe United Nations. \r\n I shall soon end my short intervention, as I do not \r\nwish to exceed my time limit, in keeping with the \r\ndiscipline that our peoples teach us. But first I am sorry \r\nto have state a truth that may upset the Government of \r\nthe United States. I had great hopes of President \r\nObama. I welcome his closure of Guantanamo, which \r\nrepresents progress. But in addition the economic \r\nblockade of Cuba should be ended. That is my \r\nrespectful request to the Government and people of the \r\nUnited States. \r\n Bolivia, like Latin America as a whole, used to \r\nenjoy certain tariff preferences, but under ex-President \r\nBush they were removed, because we were accused of \r\nnot combating drug-trafficking and poverty. We know \r\nthat that was a political decision, but ex-President Bush \r\nnever took into account Bolivian norms or our \r\nConstitution.  \r\n Now, under President Obama’s Government, we \r\nsee documents which include references to our new \r\nConstitution, which, for the first time in the 183 years’ \r\nexistence of the Republic, was approved by a vote of \r\nthe Bolivian people. There is a reference to article 56 \r\nand respect for private property. That strikes me as \r\ndirect interference by the United States Government in \r\nthe Constitution and other norms and standards, and I \r\nroundly reject it. What we want is diplomatic relations \r\nnot of interference, but of cooperation and investment. \r\nWhile the new Constitution for the first time \r\nguarantees private property and State property, \r\nfundamentally it guarantees collective property — \r\nproperty held by associations and cooperatives, and \r\ncommunal lands belonging to the indigenous, native \r\nmovement. \r\n In addition, an accusation is made against me in a \r\nUnited States report stating that current challenges \r\ninclude the explicit acceptance and encouragement of \r\ncoca production at the highest levels of the Bolivian \r\nGovernment. That is to say that I encourage the \r\ncultivation of coca. It should be understood that \r\ngrowing the coca leaf is one thing and that cocaine is \r\nquite another. We do not defend cocaine; we shall fight \r\nit. Indeed, our proposal is zero cocaine. What I have \r\njust said does not mean having free cultivation of the \r\ncoca leaf, though in its natural state it is beneficial and \r\nhealthy for human life. \r\n We have launched a campaign on decriminalizing \r\nthe traditional consumption of the coca leaf. I \r\nguarantee that there will never be free cultivation of \r\ncoca, but neither will there a zero coca leaf policy. But \r\nthere is a zero cocaine policy. It cannot be said that I \r\nencourage coca cultivation in Bolivia. That is not true. \r\n The Assembly will know that I come from the \r\ntrade union and social movements, and that I was a \r\nunion leader. Now President, fortuitously and for the \r\ntime being, I am extremely concerned that it is said \r\nthat the Government will dismantle the union \r\nmovement by decree. How could I eliminate the \r\nunions, when they and the social movements are the \r\nbackbone of the Evo Morales Government? I have built \r\nunion headquarters and encouraged unions, workers \r\nand indigenous peoples, and yet I am accused of \r\ndismantling the unions. \r\n President Obama may not be aware of the \r\ndocuments to which I have referred, which perhaps \r\ncome from the State Department. I perfectly \r\nunderstand that sometimes when change is desired it is \r\ndifficult to change State structures. But after reading \r\nthe documents very carefully I wonder how it is \r\npossible for someone who has suffered discrimination \r\nto discriminate against another. At least in Latin \r\nAmerica, the so-called Afro-Americans and \r\nAfro-Bolivians are the sectors most discriminated \r\nagainst in society, together with the so-called Indians \r\nor indigenous people. We are called “negroes” and \r\n“Indians”. I do not understand how a black person who \r\nhas been discriminated against and excluded can \r\nA/64/PV.4  \r\n \r\n09-52228 40 \r\n \r\ndiscriminate against and exclude an Indian. It is a \r\nmatter of grave concern.  \r\n It is to be hoped that those historic errors can be \r\nrectified, not for the good of the President, and not just \r\nfor the good of Bolivians, but for the image of peoples, \r\nsuch as the people of the United States. I well \r\nunderstand that sometimes it is not easy to change \r\nstructures which may work against our peoples. \r\n Finally, I refer  to some historical demands, such \r\nas the return of our access to the sea. Our two peoples, \r\nour brother republics, Chile and Bolivia, feel sufficient \r\ntrust in each other to seek to resolve the issue of  \r\nmaritime access. I hope that it can be settled bilaterally. \r\nIf not, intervention by the international community will \r\nbe needed. Progress has been made. I feel that there is \r\ntrust, which is needed in order to resolve any problem. \r\nOtherwise, important steps must be taken. \r\n I thank my brothers and sisters for listening to \r\nme. I would like to continue to share their experience,  \r\nproposals and concerns for the good of mankind as a \r\nwhole. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the \r\nPlurinational State of Bolivia for the statement he has \r\njust made. \r\n Mr. Evo Morales Ayma, President of the \r\nPlurinational State of Bolivia, was escorted from \r\nthe General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Victor Yushchenko, President \r\nof Ukraine \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of Ukraine.  \r\n Mr. Victor Yushchenko, President of Ukraine, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Victor Yushchenko, \r\nPresident of Ukraine, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\n President Yushchenko (spoke in Ukrainian; \r\nEnglish interpretation provided by the delegation): On \r\nbehalf of Ukraine, I congratulate Mr. Ali Abdussalam \r\nTreki of Libya on his election to preside over the sixty-\r\nfourth session of the General Assembly. I wish him \r\nevery success in his activities. \r\n Every year we all gather here at high level in the \r\nGeneral Assembly to present our own national views \r\non the life of our planet and its peoples. We strive to \r\nget the feeling of the overall emotional setting and \r\npulse of human energy, ideas and quests. The \r\nemotional setting of Ukraine is open, principled and \r\ntolerant. \r\n We have gathered here not to offend each other or \r\nexchange insults, but to resolve our common problems. \r\nI call upon all of us to use tolerance against bigotry, \r\nmalignancy and arrogance. I say this on behalf of a \r\nnation whose last lustrum is unique in terms of \r\nchallenges and progress. \r\n We in Ukraine live in an atmosphere of \r\nstrengthening freedom. This process is both grand and \r\ncomplex. Its difficulties discourage idealists and \r\nnurture authoritarian forces, yet they are another alpine \r\npeak for all who are enlightened to ascend. The \r\nmilestone at which our nation stands today is the basis \r\nfor moving forward to a free and safe life, to revive our \r\nown millennium-old tradition and its interrupted ties \r\nand to be again an active part of global civilization. \r\n Our democratic choice is irreversible. As a free \r\nnation, we shall not accept any forms of interference in \r\nthe internal affairs of sovereign States, any pressure on \r\nthem or manifestations of authoritarian thinking in \r\ninternational relations. We remember the price paid by \r\nour fathers for our freedom, for the freedom of Europe \r\nand the world, and for the future independence of \r\nUkraine. \r\n We shall soon commemorate the sixty-fifth \r\nanniversary of the victory over fascism. This joint \r\nvictory of the anti-Hitler coalition is sacred. The \r\nmission of all countries which remember the horrors of \r\nfascism is to avert any hint of a restoration of \r\ntotalitarian ideology and its derivative: the policy of \r\nimperial ambitions, neglecting the value of human life \r\nand violating the right of peoples to sovereign national \r\nexistence. \r\n I raise this issue because we are witnessing the \r\nre-emergence of very disconcerting signals from the \r\npast, ranging from questioning the very existence of \r\nnewly independent States to denying nations’ own \r\nviews on their past and future. We are concerned about \r\nthe substitution of concepts and approaches. \r\nCooperation, openness and friendship between nations \r\nare being explicitly confronted by aggressive national \r\negotism, which ignores the interests of close partners \r\n A/64/PV.4\r\n \r\n41 09-52228 \r\n \r\nand dictates the right of the powerful. Unconcealed \r\ninformation wars, energy blackmail and economic \r\nblackmail, as well as interference in sovereign affairs, \r\nfall outside the civilized framework. \r\n Most important, we strongly condemn and shall \r\nnot accept any violations of fundamental international \r\nprinciples — in particular, territorial integrity and the \r\ninviolability of the frontiers of all sovereign States. \r\n It is axiomatic for us that all United Nations \r\nMember States, and especially the permanent members \r\nof the Security Council, must be exemplary in abiding \r\nby the principles of international law, of equality of \r\nnations and of neighbourliness, for our Charter, which \r\nremains unbroken, entrusts the Security Council with \r\nthe primary responsibility for maintaining international \r\npeace and security. \r\n Ukraine acts in strict compliance with the goals \r\nand principles of the United Nations, and expects the \r\nsame from its partners and neighbours. \r\n Today I have the honour to confirm Ukraine’s \r\nresolve to become a Security Council member in 2016-\r\n2017. \r\n Our country has been and will always remain a \r\nreliable partner of the United Nations in all  peace and \r\nsecurity matters and in collective actions fostering \r\nstability in every region, especially in Africa. This year \r\nI approved the strategy of Ukraine’s international \r\npeacekeeping activity, which will consolidate our \r\ncontribution and participation in this field. \r\n Safety of peacekeepers has been constantly the \r\nfocus of Ukraine’s attention. As one of the initiators of \r\nthe Convention on the Safety of United Nations and \r\nAssociated Personnel, we propose that the General \r\nAssembly consider additional measures to strengthen \r\nthe legal protection of participants in peacekeeping \r\noperations. \r\n Almost 15 years ago Ukraine voluntarily gave up \r\nthe third largest nuclear potential and acceded to the \r\nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear \r\nState. We welcome the steps taken by the United States \r\nand the Russian Federation to elaborate a new \r\nagreement to replace the Treaty between the Union of \r\nSoviet Socialist Republics and the United States on the \r\nReduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, \r\nof 31 July 1991, which expires this year. \r\n At the same time, Ukraine continues to count on \r\nthe support of the Security Council permanent \r\nmembers for our proposal to enhance security \r\nassurances for non-nuclear States, in particular for \r\nthose which have voluntarily renounced nuclear \r\nweapons or their development. That will become an \r\nimportant incentive for many countries. \r\n Ukraine will continue to act responsibly and \r\nconstructively in matters of military and security \r\ncooperation. \r\n We strictly abide by Security Council resolutions, \r\nand adhere to all established international regimes. Our \r\nposition in this sphere is consistent with all our \r\ninternational obligations. It is verified, balanced and \r\nunchangeable. \r\n I wish to dwell on an issue of the utmost \r\nimportance for Ukraine: the global fight against \r\nmaritime piracy. We value all the efforts of the United \r\nNations and the International Maritime Organization \r\n(IMO) in this regard. However, the measures taken so \r\nfar have not been sufficient. \r\n Almost 60,000 Ukrainian citizens are employed \r\non ships under foreign flags. Any developments on the \r\nhigh seas affect us directly. In the last seven years \r\nalone pirates have attacked 18 vessels with Ukrainian \r\nsailors on board, and in the last nine months alone \r\n35 Ukrainian sailors have been taken hostage. It is no \r\nlonger a local problem; it has become very dangerous \r\nand threatens us all. We shall not turn a blind eye to it. \r\n Ukraine was among the sponsors of IMO \r\nresolution A.1002 (25), entitled “Piracy and armed \r\nrobbery against ships operating in waters off the coast \r\nof Somalia”, which laid the ground for further Security \r\nCouncil resolutions in that regard. We strongly support \r\nthe elaboration of uniform, clear rules to fight pirates \r\nand to protect sailors. We are convinced that the \r\nGeneral Assembly has to become a coordinating body \r\nfor the efforts of all specialized institutions in this \r\nfield. We call for a more active stance by those United \r\nNations Members which are main countries of origin of \r\nmarine workers and by those States and organizations \r\ncapable of making an impact on the safety of \r\ninternational maritime navigation. \r\n On behalf of Ukraine, I propose to examine \r\ncarefully the idea of establishing in one of the African \r\ncountries a regional centre under the United Nations \r\naegis which would bring under its umbrella specialized \r\nA/64/PV.4  \r\n \r\n09-52228 42 \r\n \r\nagencies, programmes and funds, as well as political \r\noffices, to counter piracy. I want to be clear: Ukraine \r\nwill be actively engaged in all international \r\nendeavours, and we intend to join the European Union \r\nAtalanta anti-piracy naval operation. \r\n As President of Ukraine, I urge the General \r\nAssembly to debate these very critical issues in a \r\nseparate meeting. \r\n We face manifold challenges that we can resolve \r\nonly by concerted efforts. I am convinced that one of \r\nthe most acute problems for us all is the global \r\nfinancial crisis. Ukraine welcomes decisions of \r\nmultilateral forums, in particular those of the Group of \r\n20, as the leading instrument to counter the crisis. \r\n In this process, our Organization can and should \r\nplay its role in preventing the financial perturbations \r\nfrom spinning out into social upheavals. Perhaps it is \r\ntime to revisit the idea, put forward earlier by Ukraine \r\nand recently by a number of other countries, of the \r\ncreation of a United Nations economic security \r\ncouncil. The large scale of this proposal should not \r\nprompt us to shelve it or reject it altogether. \r\n In addition, decisions on the financing of United \r\nNations activities within regular reviews of the scale of \r\nassessments must be taken with due account of the \r\nglobal crisis. \r\n The principal and most important objective for \r\nour universal Organization and for each of our \r\ncountries is to protect common people from the crisis \r\nand to prevent the decline of their living standards.  \r\n Despite all the economic difficulties, Ukraine is \r\naware of its responsibility to support other countries \r\nthat have suffered even more. This year Ukraine has \r\nbecome a World Food Programme donor. We hope that \r\nour contribution will save millions of lives in Africa. I \r\nsay to our dear partners that Ukraine understands very \r\nwell your needs, and we shall strive to save people \r\nsuffering from hunger.  \r\n We have gathered here today to get the feeling of \r\nthe overall emotional setting of our planet. Ukraine’s \r\nemotional setting is resolute, persevering and \r\nbenevolent. \r\n We believe in our Organization. We are capable \r\nof great achievements. I am firmly convinced of our \r\nstrength to move forward confidently for the benefit of \r\nthe world, our peoples and countries. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I thank the President of Ukraine for the \r\nstatement he has just made.  \r\n Mr. Victor Yushchenko, President of Ukraine, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall.  \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Lech Kaczyński, President of the \r\nRepublic of Poland \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nPoland. \r\n Mr. Lech Kaczyński, President of the Republic of \r\nPoland, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.  \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Lech Kaczyński, President \r\nof the Republic of Poland, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly.  \r\n President Kaczyński (spoke in Polish; English \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): Sixty-four \r\nyears since the foundation of the United Nations we \r\nrecall the self-evident fact that the United Nations was \r\ncreated to prevent atrocities such as those that occurred \r\nduring the Second World War, from 1939 to 1945. It \r\nwas called into being in order to avoid a repetition of \r\nthe failure of the League of Nations, the first \r\nworldwide organization, which tried to carry out its \r\nduties between the two world wars. \r\n The United Nations over 64 years has undergone \r\nvarious twists and turns. There have been better and \r\nworse years, years when here in this Hall there were \r\nclashes between the forces of two camps, the so-called \r\nsocialist camp and the free world. There were times \r\nwhen here in this Hall scores of new countries of \r\nAfrica, Oceania and Asia emerged. There was also the \r\ntime, 20 years ago, when, after the collapse of the \r\nSoviet Union, there appeared many other new \r\ncountries, and when others such as mine, Poland, \r\ngained real, not only formal, independence.  \r\n At that time the whole world believed that we had \r\nfound a way to solve all problems, especially economic \r\nproblems, using market economy rules, which meant a \r\nfree economy and free movement of capital in all areas. \r\nWe have to state clearly that, as we have heard here \r\nmany times, in recent years this faith has been \r\n A/64/PV.4\r\n \r\n43 09-52228 \r\n \r\nundermined, and therefore I have to devote my address \r\nto the problem of the crisis to some extent. \r\n This crisis is a new problem. Participating in a \r\nGeneral Assembly session for the first time, I can state \r\nthat all the earlier problems, such as conflicts, of which \r\nthere are many, the more recent problem of climate \r\nchange, and the problem of poverty, are not new. To \r\nthem we should add the problem of health: AIDS, \r\nepidemics and so on. \r\n However, the problem of the current crisis \r\nappeared in the last year. Before coming to it, I should \r\nlike to refer to what the President of Ukraine said. \r\nThere are many causes of conflict in the world, one \r\nbeing the violation of faith in territorial integrity. \r\nBecause many new countries have emerged over the \r\npast dozens of years, it is clear that there will be \r\ndifferences of opinion over this or that territory. If \r\nforce is used to resolve such differences, as it was last \r\nyear against Georgia, this may give rise to fundamental \r\nproblems. It could be the source of local wars, but it \r\ncould also be the source of great conflicts, even \r\nconflicts on a world scale. On behalf of my country, I \r\nwarn against this. \r\n I return to the problem of the current crisis. I \r\nrepresent a country that continues to develop. We are \r\nthe only country in the European Union that will this \r\nyear record — albeit small — economic growth. This \r\nis due to some factors that are specific to my country, \r\nso I do not wish to dwell at length on the subject. \r\nHowever, it is clear that one reason for the crisis is that \r\nwe place too much faith in markets and banking \r\nsystems that become more and more complicated. \r\nSooner or later that must lead to the outcomes that we \r\nall see. \r\n What preventive measures can be taken? They are \r\nknown, but it is difficult to implement them. I believe \r\nthat the United Nations has a great opportunity here. It \r\nis not that there will be management of the global \r\neconomy. Such attempts are doomed to failure and will \r\nlead to another crisis. But it is not true that we do not \r\nneed new rules, new regulations, to deal with issues \r\nthat have also been discussed today, including \r\nsupervision and oversight over the banking sector. \r\nPerhaps that oversight should not be global in nature, \r\nbut it must include countries where banks are under no \r\ncontrol, because that is the source of an economic \r\npathology, which often facilitates large-scale criminal \r\nactivity, such as drug-trafficking. \r\n Another problem that has been mentioned here is \r\nthat of so-called tax havens. Mention can also be made \r\nof cheap flags of convenience for shipping. We \r\nunderstand that all those who use them do so to \r\nimprove the situation in their countries; we realize that \r\nfrom the point of view of various countries, especially \r\nthose that are not rich, there is a reason. I am not here \r\nto criticize them. But it is in our common interest to \r\nput an end to such practices. There is no other \r\norganization in the world that can do this but the \r\nUnited Nations, through the creation of international \r\nnorms. \r\n President Lula of Brazil spoke about certain very \r\nimportant problems, including those relating to \r\nfinancial agencies affiliated to the United Nations. In \r\nthat regard, I refer to the problem of greater flexibility \r\nin programmes launched by the International Monetary \r\nFund or the World Bank. \r\n There is another issue: better use of certain \r\norganizations affiliated to the United Nations. Here I \r\ndraw attention first to the International Labour \r\nOrganization (ILO), which has been in existence for 80 \r\nyears. It embraces almost all countries of the world and \r\nhas about 2,500 employees. Should it not to a greater \r\nextent be a place for the formulation of programmes \r\nproviding an alternative to liberal development? It \r\nseems that a reformed ILO could successfully perform \r\nthat function. It requires a common effort, but it is \r\nfeasible. \r\n I am not talking about additional funds and \r\nfinancial means. I am talking about formulating \r\nalternative programmes that take the interests of \r\nworkers into account to a greater extent than so far, and \r\nalso a balance between different social groups, not only \r\nin the rich countries, but also in the poorer countries. \r\n Today’s address by the President of the United \r\nStates pointed to the fact that a country that, whatever \r\none thinks about it, is the most powerful in the world \r\ntoday, is now approaching the problems of the United \r\nNations differently. This creates a certain possibility \r\nfor the Organization, our Organization. This is an \r\nopportunity that can be taken if the United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations become more effective. We \r\nshould appreciate the operations that have been carried \r\nout so far, but we need certain organizational changes \r\nto make the activity more effective. What I am saying \r\ndoes not exclude the tasks taken up by, for instance, \r\nA/64/PV.4  \r\n \r\n09-52228 44 \r\n \r\nNATO. But the United Nations should play the leading \r\nrole. \r\n There is also the problem of United Nations \r\nreform, especially reform of the Security Council. I do \r\nnot wish to dwell on the subject now, but we are all \r\naware that it is a very important issue, in that there is a \r\nbasic difference between what was established 64 years \r\nago and what we have now. \r\n  In the past the United Nations has placed a great \r\ndeal of emphasis on climate change and climate issues. \r\nMuch has been said about the subject, and I do not \r\nwant to repeat it. However, I strongly emphasize that \r\nthis is a very important issue, requiring great \r\nsensitivity. If richer countries want to become strongly \r\ninvolved in climate protection, they must realize that \r\nthe weaker States should be assisted, because this very \r\njust cause cannot be dealt with in such a way as to \r\nmake development easier for some and harder for \r\nothers. We should always bear that in mind in thinking \r\nabout the solidarity of all nations and about the \r\nobjectives given to the United Nations 64 years ago. \r\n Last, but not least, I turn to an issue that has not \r\nbeen discussed at great length, except in regard to \r\npiracy: international terrorism. Today it is an important \r\nproblem. The situation in some countries, such as \r\nAfghanistan and Pakistan, is very significant proof of \r\nthat. Terrorism has its sources, not all of which are \r\nrelated to external ideologies. There are also some \r\nobjective premises, and we understand this. We also \r\nunderstand that the United Nations can play a greater \r\nrole than it has played so far. \r\n Poland is a member of NATO, and is very much \r\ninvolved in operations. But we understand that under \r\ninternational law the only 100 per cent legitimacy for \r\nsuch operations derives from the United Nations. This \r\nis very important now and also for the future, because \r\nwe must realize that the problems of conflict, crisis and \r\nterrorism cannot be solved within a few years.  \r\n Many times today we heard that the United \r\nNations is entering a new stage. We believe that this \r\nwill be a phase of its greatness, because we have \r\nlearned from the past that this great world experiment, \r\nwhich has many times passed the test on a global scale, \r\nwill continue to do so in the near future. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Poland for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Lech Kaczyński, President of the Republic of \r\nPoland, was escorted from the General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\nGeneral debate \r\nAddress by Mr. Kevin Rudd, Prime Minister  \r\nof Australia  \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of Australia. \r\n Mr. Kevin Rudd, Prime Minister of Australia, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum. \r\n The President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming The Honourable Kevin Rudd, Prime \r\nMinister of Australia, and inviting him to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n Mr. Rudd (Australia): I come to the Assembly, as \r\nAustralia has each year since the first session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly in 1946, and I come in the same \r\nspirit, to seek solutions to the great challenges of our \r\nage and together help give those solutions effect. \r\n The challenges are not new. They are reflected in \r\nthe Preamble to the Charter which we, as an \r\ninternational community, crafted together: “to save \r\nsucceeding generations from the scourge of war”, to \r\nadvance economic growth and social progress for all, \r\n“to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights … in \r\nthe equal rights of men and women and of nations large \r\nand small”. All those great undertakings were to be \r\nreflected in a new body of international law. \r\n Two thirds of a century later these great \r\ninternational values remain constant, while the \r\nchallenges to which we apply them are subject to \r\ncontinuing change. It is on the current challenges \r\nfacing the global order that I wish to speak to the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fourth session today: the \r\nglobal financial crisis, the unfinished business of the \r\nDoha Round, the unfolding crisis of the planet itself, \r\nunresolved questions of nuclear weapons 20 years after \r\nthe end of the cold war, and the future of global \r\ngovernance itself. \r\n Just on a year ago, just down the road from here, \r\na destructive chain of events triggered the worst global \r\nfinancial crisis in three quarters of a century. It was \r\njust on a year ago that I addressed the Assembly for the \r\nfirst time, 10 days after the collapse of Lehman \r\n A/64/PV.4\r\n \r\n45 09-52228 \r\n \r\nBrothers, to reflect on the challenges which lay ahead \r\nfor the proper regulation of global financial markets. \r\n That reform programme is now under way, \r\nthrough the Group of 20 (G-20), the Financial Stability \r\nBoard and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). But \r\nthere remains much work to be done to prevent the \r\nunrestrained greed of unregulated financial markets \r\nthat has wrought such economic carnage across the \r\nworld in the past 12 months from sowing the seeds of \r\nfuture financial crises. \r\n The global financial crisis has been a wake-up \r\ncall to the international community to reform the \r\ninstitutions of global governance, and a wake-up call \r\nthat our system of global governance today is in need \r\nof radical reform. Because the truth is that the failure \r\nof these institutions is not just a matter of concern for \r\nGovernments and for diplomats and for economists; the \r\nprice of the failure of these institutions has been paid \r\nby working people and their families right across the \r\nworld.  \r\n The events on Wall Street spread rapidly and \r\nindiscriminately to every corner of the globe, from \r\nLondon to Lima, from Beijing to Barcelona, from \r\nMelbourne to Mumbai, to developed and developing \r\neconomies. This global financial crisis and its ensuing \r\neconomic and employment crisis has been no respecter \r\nof national boundaries, and no respecter of peoples. \r\n Australia has been no exception. The global \r\nfinancial crisis saw the Australian stock market fall by \r\n55 per cent. It wiped around A$ 150 billion from the \r\nretirement savings of Australian workers. And it led to \r\ntens of thousands of Australians losing their jobs. We \r\nexpect more job losses to follow. Behind each of these \r\nstatistics lie the faces of working Australians, who \r\nhave seen their savings diminished, their financial \r\nsecurity eroded and their job security threatened.  \r\n I think of places like Liverpool in Sydney, where \r\nthe decline in its light manufacturing base has led to an \r\nincrease in unemployment of 4.5 per cent over the past \r\nyear, and where now 19,000 local people are without \r\nwork; like the tourist destination of Cairns in far North \r\nQueensland, where unemployment has risen by 3.7 per \r\ncent over the past year, meaning that 13,300 people are \r\nnow out of work in that area; and like the south-eastern \r\nsuburbs of Perth, where unemployment has risen by \r\n3.3 per cent in the past year, leaving 12,800 people in \r\nthat community without a job as well.  \r\n In communities like those across Australia the \r\nglobal recession is hurting in very real ways, just as in \r\ncommunities like them across the world the global \r\nrecession is hurting in very real ways. We can never \r\nforget these men, these women, and their families, as \r\nwe seek to find a path out of this global recession.  \r\n While our global economic system failed \r\ncomprehensively to prevent the crisis, the G-20 \r\nGovernments have rallied to reduce the damage and \r\nprevent systemic collapse. Through the agency of the \r\nG-20, for the first time involving heads of Government \r\nfrom the major developed and developing economies, \r\nGovernments acted in concert to provide around \r\n$13.6 trillion-worth of support to directly stabilize the \r\nglobal financial system; to inject $5.5 trillion-worth of \r\nfiscal stimulus into the global economy; to provide \r\n$1.1 trillion in resources to the international financial \r\ninstitutions, to give markets confidence that any \r\nsubsequent collapses could be dealt with; to develop \r\nalso an integrated framework of toxic asset \r\nmanagement to repair the balance sheets of many \r\nmajor banks; and to initiate a comprehensive financial \r\nmarkets reform programme, through the Financial \r\nStability Board.  \r\n The IMF has assessed that these extraordinary \r\ninterventions succeeded in breaking the fall in what \r\nwas an economic crisis spiralling out of control. \r\n But the truth is that our global economic recovery \r\nis far from certain, and that many twists and turns lie \r\nahead. Furthermore, the institutions of global economic \r\ngovernance are facing new challenges. First, the \r\nfinancial market reform programme must be completed \r\nand implemented to prevent a future crisis. Secondly, \r\nin anticipation of global economic recovery, we must \r\nagree on a framework for the coordinated withdrawal \r\nof our emergency interventions. And, thirdly, and most \r\ncritically, we must articulate a new framework for \r\nsustainable future economic growth, a framework that \r\ndoes not simply return to business as usual, based on \r\nunsustainable financial imbalances and excessive \r\nconsumption, fuelled by consumer and corporate debt \r\nand irresponsible risk-taking in systemically significant \r\nfinancial institutions. \r\n One of the failures of the old growth model of the \r\nlast decade was the lack of effective global economic \r\ncoordination. This allowed imbalances to grow \r\nunchecked and financial institutions to remain \r\ninadequately supervised. As we move towards \r\nA/64/PV.4  \r\n \r\n09-52228 46 \r\n \r\nrecovery, we must build a framework to foster both \r\ngrowth and balance in the global economy. The IMF \r\nestimates that effectively implemented coordination \r\nbetween major economies could add significantly to \r\nglobal growth — an additional 10 per cent to global \r\noutput, or around $6 trillion over a five-year period. To \r\nachieve this coordination dividend the G-20 will need \r\nto build on the structures of cooperation that have been \r\nestablished during the crisis and apply them to the new \r\nchallenges of the global recovery.  \r\n In Pittsburgh we have a historic opportunity to \r\nagree on a framework to deliver effective coordination \r\nof our national economic policies. This framework \r\nshould have four key elements.  \r\n First, G-20 members should agree on a common \r\nobjective to achieve balanced and sustainable growth. \r\nSecondly, G-20 members should outline their own \r\nnational economic strategy and identify how it \r\ncontributes to our common objectives. Thirdly, the IMF \r\nshould analyse individual national economic plans to \r\ndetermine whether they are consistent and collectively \r\nadequate to achieve sustainable and balanced global \r\ngrowth. And, fourthly, this report should be submitted \r\nto the G-20 to form the basis of peer review, which \r\nwould identify specific risks and vulnerabilities for the \r\nfuture. This framework should be consistent with, and \r\nan important input to, the development of a set of \r\nglobal principles, such as the current proposal from \r\nGermany for a charter for sustainable economic \r\nactivity. \r\n The other great global challenge of our age is \r\nclimate change. With only 74 days remaining until \r\nCopenhagen, the Governments of the world are far \r\nfrom agreement. Enough has been said about the need \r\nfor action on climate change, but as of today not \r\nenough action has been taken. Our collective political \r\nwill to date has not been adequate to meet the task. For \r\ntoo long discussions between developed and \r\ndeveloping countries have degenerated into mutual \r\nrecrimination, with developing countries accusing \r\ndeveloped countries of failing to meet their obligations, \r\ngiven their undeniable responsibility for the bulk of \r\ngreenhouse gas emissions already in the atmosphere, \r\nand developed countries warning the major emerging \r\neconomies that unless they take action global warming \r\nwill increase to unacceptable levels, based on emerging \r\neconomy emissions alone.  \r\n The trouble is that both arguments are right. What \r\nis required globally is the leadership to embrace this \r\ntruth and respond to it accordingly, because the truth is \r\nthat all our Governments need to reach beyond their \r\nself-interests and instead fashion a grand bargain \r\nbetween the developed and the developing countries of \r\nthe world: a grand bargain on climate change which \r\nembraces both historical and future responsibility; a \r\ngrand bargain which is anchored in the science of \r\nclimate change and the need to keep temperature rises \r\nwithin 2 degrees Celsius to avoid catastrophic climate \r\nchange; a grand bargain embracing the three great \r\nchallenges of climate change which we are yet to \r\nresolve.  \r\n Those three challenges are to answer these \r\nquestions: what binding targets and commitments must \r\ndeveloped and developing countries adopt to keep \r\ntemperature rises within 2 degrees Celsius; what public \r\nand private climate change financing arrangements are \r\nnecessary to support the mitigation and adaptation \r\nmeasures we need to implement in the future; and what \r\ntechnology transfer do we need to undertake in \r\nrenewable energy, in carbon capture and storage, in \r\nenergy efficiency and in the avoidance of deforestation \r\nand forest degradation to bring about real reductions in \r\ngreenhouse gas emissions?  \r\n In the period ahead, the grand bargain we must \r\nstrike needs to resolve all three of those challenges, as \r\neach is inextricably dependent on the other. We must \r\nmake use of all available mechanisms for international \r\ncooperation, including the Major Economies Forum \r\nand the G-20, to achieve success in the negotiations. \r\nFor us all, this will be a test of our leadership, \r\nleadership which seeks to lift our collective vision \r\nbeyond today and instead focus on the needs of \r\ntomorrow.  \r\n But time is short. As Chair of the Pacific Islands \r\nForum, I know that time is already running out for the \r\nisland States of the Pacific. Coastal inundation is not a \r\nprospect; it is a reality. Fifty per cent of the population \r\nof those island States reside within 1.5 km of the coast. \r\nThe South Pacific is part of the human face of climate \r\nchange. And that is why Australia, nationally, \r\nregionally and globally, stands ready to play its part in \r\nacting on this great moral, environmental and \r\neconomic challenge of our time. \r\n This Organization was born in the shadow of \r\nnuclear weapons; that shadow remains today. One truth \r\n A/64/PV.4\r\n \r\n47 09-52228 \r\n \r\nremains absolutely clear: the proliferation of nuclear \r\nweapons can never make any country more secure. The \r\nnuclear test by North Korea this year was rightly \r\ncondemned across the international community. It \r\nreiterates that the only path to safety is through the \r\neventual elimination of nuclear weapons. Australia is \r\nencouraged by the commitment of the United States \r\nand Russia to further reduce their nuclear arsenals, but \r\nthe international community must also progress the \r\nbroader disarmament and non-proliferation agenda.  \r\n The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty has played a \r\ncrucial role in limiting the spread of nuclear weapons, \r\nbut the Treaty today is under grave challenge. We must \r\nwork to ensure that its global security benefits are \r\nreinforced by a successful Review Conference in 2010. \r\nTo reinvigorate global consensus and activism ahead of \r\nthat Conference and beyond, Australia and Japan last \r\nyear established the International Commission on \r\nNuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament, which in \r\nthe next few months will produce its final report. Its aim \r\nis to chart a practical and realistic course to achieve a \r\nstrengthened non-proliferation disarmament regime, \r\nleading to the ultimate elimination of nuclear arsenals.  \r\n Tomorrow’s Security Council summit on \r\nnon-proliferation and disarmament is important for us \r\nall. We must not miss the opportunity it offers to \r\nsummon the political resolve to move towards a \r\nnuclear-weapons-free world. \r\n The challenges of global governance extend \r\nbeyond the global financial crisis, climate change and \r\nthe threat of nuclear weapons. The realization of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals is fundamental to the \r\nelimination of extreme poverty. It remains an obscenity \r\nthat in 2009, after an age of unprecedented global \r\nprosperity, 1.5 billion of our fellow human beings are \r\nliving in extreme poverty. That is a core reason why \r\nthe Australian Government has committed to \r\nincreasing official development assistance to 0.5 per \r\ncent of gross national income, to help close the \r\ndevelopment gap which has been widening in many \r\nPacific island countries, while also helping, where  \r\n \r\n \r\npossible, to deal with poverty elsewhere in Asia, \r\nAfrica, Latin America and the Caribbean. \r\n Parallel to the Millennium Development Goals, \r\nthe Doha Development Round has now been going for \r\neight years. This is too long. The negotiating gap \r\nbetween us all is not wide, but the deficit in political \r\nwill to conclude the Round seems vast. As the world \r\nsearches for a new growth formula to sustain long-term \r\neconomic recovery, surely Doha represents one critical \r\nelement? Australia, as one of the lead negotiators \r\nwithin the Doha Round, remains ready to help bridge \r\nthe negotiating gap. \r\n Let the Assembly also not forget the continuing \r\ncritical work of the United Nations across the full \r\nspectrum of global governance — issues concerning \r\ninternational peacekeeping operations, humanitarian \r\noperations, food security, women, health, children and \r\nrefugees — all hallmarks of a civilized global order. \r\n The United Nations is not a place; it is not an \r\ninstitution. The United Nations is us, “We, the peoples \r\nof the United Nations”, as the Charter begins. It is we \r\nwho must find solutions to the problems we face, build \r\nconsensus around those solutions, and implement them. \r\nThis Organization had its beginnings not in an act of \r\nwill, though will was certainly needed, but in an act of \r\nimagination, an idea of what the world should and \r\ncould be. This is the challenge of leadership: to \r\nimagine a future worth having and then craft that \r\nvision into a practical and present reality. \r\n That was the challenge to which our forebears \r\nrose in 1945. That is the challenge to which our \r\ngeneration must now rise for the future. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of \r\nAustralia for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Kevin Rudd, Prime Minister of Australia, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum. \r\nThe meeting rose at 9.15 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n"
