(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) \r\n \r\n \r\n The meeting was called to order at 3.20 p.m. \r\n \r\nAgenda items 10 and 108 (continued) \r\n \r\nReport of the Peacebuilding Commission (A/64/341) \r\n \r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund (A/64/217) \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/63/881) \r\n \r\n Mr. Park In-kook (Republic of Korea): Over the \r\npast three years, the Peacebuilding Commission (PBC) \r\nhas effectively carried out its mandate of catalyzing \r\ninternational efforts to assist countries emerging from \r\nconflict. The third annual report of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission (A/64/341), which we have before us, is a \r\nstatement of the achievements of the Commission and \r\nthe challenges that it has faced during its third session. \r\nThis report was prepared with close consultation \r\namong Member States and the Peacebuilding Support \r\nOffice. During this process, many lessons learned and \r\nchallenges were identified and have been reflected in \r\nthe report. My delegation is pleased to note this \r\nconstructive process and believes that this report will \r\nprove to be a valuable asset in the 2010 review process. \r\n The Secretary-General’s report on peacebuilding \r\nin the immediate aftermath of conflict (A/63/881) \r\nrightfully articulates the importance of the early \r\nengagement of international efforts in post-conflict \r\nsituations. That report also concludes that the United \r\nNations is increasingly expected to play a leadership \r\nrole in that process, and I believe that the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission is well placed to assume \r\nthat critical role. How to strengthen and consolidate the \r\nrole and capacity of the Commission throughout that \r\nprocess should be one of the priority subjects \r\naddressed in the 2010 review process. In this \r\nperspective, I should like to underline the following \r\nseveral points. First, as an advisory body to the \r\nSecurity Council, the Commission has a substantive \r\nrole to play in strengthening the peacekeeping and \r\npeacebuilding architecture. As is often reiterated, \r\npeacekeepers are early peacebuilders, and more \r\npeacebuilding elements need to be integrated into \r\npeacekeeping activities. The Commission has much to \r\ncontribute with the accumulated lessons and \r\nexperiences from its country-specific activities. The \r\nsuccess of quick-impact projects in Côte d’Ivoire \r\nindicates that they are an excellent case to build on in \r\nthe effort to better align the links between \r\npeacekeeping and peacebuilding. \r\n Secondly, peacekeeping, peacebuilding and \r\nsustainable development should be pursued seamlessly \r\nand not sequentially. This point has been constantly \r\nreiterated by many colleagues; but as we see, there are \r\nstill some cases where the peacebuilding process has \r\nbeen put on hold until very late in the game. This kind \r\nof approach often increases the possibility of missing \r\nthe critical early window of opportunity. Peacekeeping, \r\npeacebuilding and sustainable development should be \r\npursued side by side to create synergies in order to help \r\ncountries overcome post-conflict situations. \r\n Thirdly, we believe that it is time to start \r\ndiscussing and developing entry and exit strategies for \r\nthe Commission. As we witness encouraging progress \r\nA/64/PV.50  \r\n \r\n09-61775 2 \r\n \r\nin certain agenda countries, we need to think of ways \r\nto help those countries transfer to the next stage, \r\nnamely, through sustainable economic growth. \r\nMeanwhile, my delegation understands that there are \r\ncertain countries that wish to be put on the PBC agenda \r\nbut their country-specific configurations have not yet \r\nbeen established. When to engage and when to help \r\ncountries move on to the next stage is a subject that \r\ndeserves our thorough analysis. \r\n Fourthly, as the involvement of the Commission \r\nis increasingly called upon, we need to find a way to \r\nincorporate more countries within its agenda. \r\nConsidering the Commission’s limited capacity to \r\nengage multiple countries simultaneously, new and \r\ninnovative working methods need to be developed. A \r\n“light engagement” model suggested by some \r\ndelegations could work as one of the options, allowing \r\nthe Commission to engage more countries \r\nsimultaneously. The Peacebuilding Support Office \r\ndiscussion paper on this subject will serve as a good \r\nstarting point, and we look forward to further \r\ndiscussion on this matter in the following months and \r\nin the 2010 review process.  \r\n Fifthly, in order to prevent post-conflict countries \r\nfrom relapsing into conflict situations, quick impact \r\nresults should be delivered to the people in those \r\ncountries. In other words, our peacebuilding efforts \r\nshould be country-specific and field-oriented. Voices \r\nfrom the field should be further incorporated into the \r\npeacebuilding discussions in New York and field trip \r\nopportunities need to be expanded to allow Member \r\nStates to see and hear from the field. \r\n Sixthly, peacebuilding is not something that can \r\nbe achieved by a single player but must be orchestrated \r\namong various players. We cannot emphasize enough \r\nthe importance of linkages between United Nations \r\npartner organizations, including its funds and \r\nprogrammes, and cooperative relations with regional \r\norganizations and international financial institutions. \r\nThe visit of the PBC Chairs’ group to the African \r\nUnion Headquarters in Addis Ababa two weeks ago \r\nwas truly an important step to broaden and strengthen \r\nthese relations. I hope that that initiative will expand to \r\nother regional organizations so as to provide them with \r\nthe opportunity to broaden their relationship with the \r\nCommission. \r\n My delegation is pleased to learn from the \r\nSecretary-General’s report that the donor base of the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund (PBF) has been broadened to 45 \r\ndonors and that the Fund’s portfolio has been \r\nsignificantly increased during the reporting period. We \r\nbelieve that this represents the confidence and credit \r\nthat Member States have in the Fund. With the revised \r\nterms of reference and the new window structures, the \r\nFund is now better equipped to assume its role and \r\nperform its objectives. However, as the report \r\nindicates, the catalytic function of the Fund still needs \r\nto be improved. My delegation looks forward to more \r\ndiscussion on ways to enhance the catalytic role of the \r\nFund in the next session. \r\n Mr. Schaper (Netherlands): Let me begin by \r\naligning my delegation with the statement of Sweden \r\non behalf of the European Union. The Netherlands \r\nwould like to use this occasion to make some \r\nadditional remarks. \r\n Today’s debate is important and I wish to thank \r\nyou, Sir, for organizing it and for providing us with an \r\nopportunity to share our views on the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission (PBC), three years after it became \r\noperational. Our discussion today, as we consider the \r\nexperiences gained and the progress made by the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission over the past year, is also \r\nimportant for the 2010 review of the Commission. We \r\nlook forward to this important exercise and, as active \r\nmembers of the Commission since it first became \r\noperational, we stand ready to contribute to this \r\ndiscussion. \r\n The decision to set up the Commission around the \r\ntime of the 2005 World Summit reflected the growing \r\nrecognition by the international community of the need \r\nfor comprehensive and integrated strategies in support \r\nof countries emerging from conflict. The \r\nCommission — this year under the spirited leadership \r\nof the Permanent Representative of Chile, Ambassador \r\nMuñoz — has developed into an intergovernmental \r\nbody that stands at the forefront of new thinking on \r\nmatters of peacebuilding, drawing on its practical \r\nexperience in the field. \r\n Through its country-specific meetings especially, \r\nthe Commission has developed approaches that rightly \r\nfocus on areas where gaps exist in terms of \r\npeacebuilding, and that seek to address those gaps \r\nthrough integrated and well-coordinated cooperation \r\nframeworks. At the same time, such a comprehensive \r\nand coherent approach is essential to mobilize the \r\nsupport of the international community and the \r\nengagement of all relevant actors. \r\n A/64/PV.50\r\n \r\n3 09-61775 \r\n \r\n The country-specific approach, which is a \r\ndefining characteristic of the Commission’s work, is at \r\nthis moment focused on four countries: Sierra Leone, \r\nBurundi, Guinea-Bissau and the Central African \r\nRepublic. While some common challenges exist, it is \r\nclear that the countries on the PBC agenda require \r\ntailored approaches that take into account the specific \r\nneeds of each. This flexibility of the Commission is a \r\nmajor asset and, as future approaches are being \r\nconsidered, that key principle should, in our opinion, \r\nbe preserved. \r\n Let me also mention the important role of the \r\nindividual Chairs — Canada, Sweden/Switzerland, \r\nBrazil and Belgium, respectively. It is their \r\nengagement in support of the efforts of the \r\nGovernments concerned that has proved critical in \r\nadvancing the peacebuilding agenda in these countries. \r\n On a number of occasions the Commission has \r\nbeen instrumental in efforts to address specific critical \r\nissues as they emerged in countries on the PBC agenda. \r\nFor example, the Commission has focused international \r\nattention on drug trafficking in West Africa, a regional \r\nsecurity issue affecting Guinea-Bissau as well as \r\nseveral other countries in the region, such as Sierra \r\nLeone. It is on issues like these that the Commission \r\ncan and must play a crucial role as an advocate for \r\ninternational engagement in support of the \r\npeacebuilding agendas in these countries. At the same \r\ntime, experiences in one country can be useful in \r\nanother country. For instance, the role of the PBC in \r\nmonitoring the presidential and parliamentary elections \r\nin Sierra Leone sets a good example for a similar role \r\nin the context of the upcoming elections in Burundi. \r\n We have always maintained that the PBC is the \r\nmaster of its own procedures and working methods, \r\nsuch as the tailored and country-specific approach. In \r\nthe future, even more differentiated approaches could \r\nbe considered that would enable the PBC to deliver \r\nadded value on specific issues and within a shorter \r\nperiod of time. But in the end, the PBC will be able to \r\nsignificantly contribute to peacebuilding in countries \r\non its agenda only if the full range of its membership, \r\nincluding the whole United Nations system, is fully \r\ncommitted to it. Similarly, the World Bank and the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund must be fully engaged. \r\nThe peacebuilding cooperation frameworks that have \r\nbeen drawn up for the countries in which the PBC is \r\nengaged stand as critical benchmarks for measuring \r\nthat commitment and its real impact on the ground. \r\n If the PBC, Member States and the Peacebuilding \r\nSupport Office, under the leadership of Assistant \r\nSecretary-General Cheng-Hopkins, do indeed draw on \r\nthe valuable experiences that have now been gained \r\nand on the lessons learned, the PBC should be well \r\nplaced to enter a new stage in its development — a \r\nstage in which it can be even more effective in \r\nfurthering the international peacebuilding agenda and \r\nin which its activities are even better tailored to the \r\nneeds of the post-conflict countries on its agenda. \r\n Mr. Sumi (Japan): On behalf of the Government \r\nof Japan, it is my great pleasure and honour to address \r\nthe General Assembly under the presidency of Mr. Ali \r\nAbdussalam Treki. My delegation would like to \r\nexpress its gratitude to Ambassador Heraldo Muñoz, \r\nChair of the Peacebuilding Commission (PBC), for the \r\nin-depth report on the Commission (A/64/341). I would \r\nalso like to thank the Secretary-General for his report \r\non the Peacebuilding Fund (A/64/217), and to express \r\nour appreciation and support for the achievements in \r\nthe work of the Commission during the third session. \r\n Ambassador Takasu acted as the Chair of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission during its third session \r\nuntil handing over responsibility to the current Chair, \r\nAmbassador Muñoz, in January of this year. During his \r\ntenure, Ambassador Takasu actively held strategic \r\ndiscussions with high-level representatives from \r\nvarious organizations, including the Administrator of \r\nthe United Nations Development Programme. We are \r\npleased that this tradition was continued and \r\nstrengthened by Ambassador Muñoz this year. \r\n Three years after its creation, the PBC has \r\ndeepened strategic discussions in both the \r\nOrganizational Committee and the country-specific \r\nconfigurations. The PBC has helped to maintain the \r\npolitical momentum for the peace process in Burundi. \r\nThe PBC sent a fact-finding mission to Sierra Leone \r\nafter the onset of political instability in March, thereby \r\nhelping to prevent further deterioration in the situation. \r\nIt also organized a High-level Special Session on \r\nSierra Leone in June to mobilize resources for its new \r\ndevelopment goals. On Guinea-Bissau, the PBC held a \r\nseries of discussions and made recommendations to \r\navoid a relapse into conflict after the assassinations of \r\nthe President and others early this year. Those events \r\nshow that the PBC has become an organ that is \r\ncommitted to making a difference in countries \r\nemerging from conflict. Japan acknowledges the \r\nA/64/PV.50  \r\n \r\n09-61775 4 \r\n \r\nsupport given to the PBC by the General Assembly as \r\nits supervisory organ. \r\n The Peacebuilding Fund has enjoyed continuous \r\nsupport. We welcome the increase in the number of \r\ncommitments and the broadening of the donor base. \r\nThe Peacebuilding Fund is supporting 12 countries in \r\nbuilding durable peace. In the meanwhile, we hope that \r\nthe Fund will strengthen its catalytic role to attract \r\nadditional resources for countries in need. \r\n Turning to the way forward, as envisaged in its \r\nfounding resolutions, the PBC will soon undergo a \r\nreview by building on the achievements of the past \r\nthree sessions. Japan views the following points as \r\nessential for that review. \r\n First, the review should focus on increasing the \r\neffectiveness of the PBC in bringing about positive \r\nresults on the ground. It is important to reflect on past \r\nexperiences and to examine what has worked well and \r\nwhat has not. The objective of the PBC is to produce \r\ntangible results on the ground. We therefore believe \r\nthat the review should not turn into a philosophical \r\ndebate, but instead focus on the pragmatic fine-tuning \r\nof the Peacebuilding Commission. \r\n Secondly, it is necessary to discuss how to \r\nstrengthen the advisory role of the PBC vis-à-vis the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council as its \r\nparent organs. In that regard, it is also essential that the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council make the \r\nbest use of the PBC’s advisory role and make concrete \r\nrequests of the Commission. For instance, the \r\nsubstantive interaction between the PBC, the Assembly \r\nand the Council should be conducted more regularly. In \r\nturn, reflection and review by the Assembly and the \r\nCouncil should increase further. \r\n Thirdly, the review should encompass the \r\nfunctions of the PBC, the Peacebuilding Fund and the \r\nPeacebuilding Support Office, as they constitute \r\nintegral parts of the United Nations peacebuilding \r\narchitecture. We need to explore how to maximize \r\npolitical leverage, financial support and the \r\ncoordination capability of the United Nations in \r\npursuing the peacebuilding agenda. \r\n Fourthly, we need to discuss how the PBC can \r\nbroaden its support to countries emerging from \r\nconflict. The essential objective is to maximize the \r\nadded value of the Peacebuilding Commission’s \r\nengagement, particularly in countries that are \r\nexperiencing the immediate aftermath of conflict. We \r\nalso believe that extending the PBC’s work to various \r\nparts of the world will also increase its credibility.  \r\n The relationship between peacekeeping missions \r\nand the PBC is not mutually exclusive, but \r\ncomplementary. In some cases, collaboration between \r\npeacekeeping missions and the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission can better address the needs of a country. \r\nIn that connection, the review of the PBC should \r\nexplore innovative ways for the Commission to deal \r\nwith countries that are on its agenda. \r\n Lastly, we welcome the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on peacebuilding in the immediate aftermath \r\nof conflict (A/63/881), as well as the efforts of the \r\nSecretariat to implement the recommendations \r\ncontained in the report. It is a priority for the United \r\nNations to be well equipped and harmonized to address \r\nthe challenges of peacebuilding. The efforts of the \r\nSecretariat are of relevance to the work of the PBC. We \r\ntherefore believe that the implementation of the \r\nSecretary-General’s report should be duly linked to the \r\nreview of the Peacebuilding Commission. \r\n Japan is committed to contributing to the work of \r\nthe PBC and to its upcoming review. As one of the \r\nfounding members of the PBC and a current member of \r\nthe Security Council, we believe that it is our \r\nobligation to contribute to discussions during the \r\nreview in a constructive manner. \r\n Mr. Parham (United Kingdom): I would like to \r\nthank you, Mr. President, for organizing this debate, \r\nwhich provides a useful opportunity to take stock of \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission (PBC) and the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund (PBF).  \r\n I should like to align myself with the statement \r\ndelivered by the representative of Sweden on behalf of \r\nthe European Union. \r\n I would first like to give particular thanks to \r\nAmbassador Muñoz for his dedicated efforts in \r\nchairing the Organizational Committee. I would also \r\nlike to thank the Permanent Representatives of Canada, \r\nBelgium, Brazil, El Salvador and Switzerland, and \r\ntheir respective teams, for their chairing roles. I would \r\nalso like to thank the Peacebuilding Support Office \r\n(PBSO) for its support. \r\n The Commission’s annual report (A/64/341) \r\ndescribes many of the achievements made during the \r\nyear. I would like to highlight a few of them. The PBC \r\n A/64/PV.50\r\n \r\n5 09-61775 \r\n \r\nhas played an important role in maintaining the \r\ninternational spotlight on all of the countries on its \r\nagenda. Its biannual reviews have served to maintain \r\npressure on all parties to live up to their commitments \r\nto deliver on agreed priorities. \r\n In Sierra Leone, the PBC has helped to mobilize \r\nsupport for the Government’s new Agenda for Change, \r\nwhich the PBC has appropriately taken up as its \r\nframework for action. In Burundi, the PBC has helped \r\nto support regional efforts to maintain momentum in \r\nthe peace process, in which there have been many \r\npositive developments, and is now closely engaged in \r\nsupporting the upcoming elections. In the Central \r\nAfrican Republic, the PBC has assisted with the \r\nnational dialogue and is helping to spur progress on \r\ndisarmament, demobilization and reintegration. \r\n But many challenges remain. We have seen \r\ncontinued fragility, for example in Guinea-Bissau, as \r\nevidenced by the many assassinations that have \r\noccurred over the past year. We need to make use of \r\nthe current window of opportunity following the \r\ninauguration of the new Government there to help \r\ntackle some of the key peacebuilding challenges facing \r\nthe country, notably security sector reform. \r\n There are other examples of the PBC genuinely \r\nhelping peacebuilding processes, but are those enough? \r\nIn going forward, we need to pose some tough \r\nquestions. Why have we not seen more post-conflict \r\ncountries coming forward to be on the PBC’s agenda? \r\nHow effective has the PBC’s advice been in shaping \r\nthe work of its parent bodies? How solid a bridge has \r\nthe PBC been in bringing together political, security, \r\nhumanitarian and development actors? How much of a \r\ndistinctive role has the PBC carved out with other \r\ncountry-related forums, such as groups of friends and \r\ncontact groups? And to what extent have the business \r\npractices adopted by the PBC allowed for flexibility to \r\nrespond to emerging needs? \r\n The PBC review in 2010 will provide an \r\nimportant opportunity to take stock of those questions \r\nand, in so doing, to reinvigorate the PBC and clarify its \r\nadded value. The review should result in there being \r\nmuch better linkages between peacekeeping and \r\npeacebuilding. It should help us look at what are the \r\nincentives and disincentives for a country coming on to \r\nthe PBC’s agenda, and what is the optimum time for \r\nthat to occur. It should see what role the PBC can play \r\nin helping to address the continued lack of progress in \r\nsome of the core peacebuilding areas, notably security \r\nsector reform, strengthening the rule of law, economic \r\nrecovery and the restoration of core Government \r\nfunctions. \r\n The review should help determine how the PBC’s \r\nadvice can have increased impact, and how the PBC \r\ncan be encouraged to play a stronger role in addressing \r\nobstacles to a sustained, long-term and joined-up \r\ninternational approach to peacebuilding, while ensuring \r\na coordinated effort among the United Nations, the \r\nWorld Bank and donors. And it should help in \r\nimproving how additional partners and funds are \r\nmobilized behind a single nationally owned strategy. \r\n Another key issue for 2010 is the implementation \r\nof the Secretary-General’s report on peacebuilding in \r\nthe immediate aftermath of conflict (A/63/881). It is \r\nimportant for the next Secretary-General’s report to be \r\nnot just an update of New York-based discussions; \r\nrather, it should demonstrate real improvements and \r\nimpacts on the ground. Of particular importance is \r\ngetting real clarity on roles and responsibilities for the \r\nkey peacebuilding sectors. \r\n The Peacebuilding Fund also has an important \r\npart to play. We need to see evidence that its \r\nmanagement arrangements allow it to provide rapid \r\nand flexible financing. The PBF’s revised terms of \r\nreference, which we agreed to earlier this year, give it \r\nthe framework to do that. What we now need to see is \r\nthe PBSO implementing the new operational \r\nguidelines. But it is not just an issue for the PBSO. As \r\nwe have seen in many countries to which PBF money \r\nhas been disbursed, the very slow pace of delivery has \r\nbeen due to the limited capacity of implementing \r\nagencies. It is important that only those agencies with \r\nreal capacities be tasked with delivery. \r\n Those strands of work make 2010 a critical year \r\nfor improving the way we support countries emerging \r\nfrom conflict. We need to seize this opportunity; \r\notherwise, we will continue to see countries slide back \r\ninto conflict. And when they do, they have a habit of \r\nspreading that conflict and destabilizing neighbouring \r\nregions. Countries affected by conflict and fragility \r\naccount for a third of the people living in extreme \r\npoverty, half the children not in primary school and \r\nhalf the children who die before their fifth birthday. \r\nThere is a real imperative to make sure that the new \r\npeacebuilding architecture put in place at the 2005 \r\nA/64/PV.50  \r\n \r\n09-61775 6 \r\n \r\nSummit really delivers real benefits for real people in \r\nreal time. \r\n Ms. Anderson (Ireland): Ireland aligns itself with \r\nthe statement made earlier today by the representative \r\nof Sweden on behalf of the European Union.  \r\n Peacebuilding is at the nexus of maintaining \r\npeace and security, promoting and protecting human \r\nrights and ensuring sustainable development. It is at \r\nonce one of the most complex and one of the most vital \r\nfunctions of the United Nations system. In Ireland, we \r\nhave first-hand experience of the complexities of \r\ncrafting sustainable peace. Our engagement in \r\nNorthern Ireland has taught us the range and depth of \r\nthe challenges involved. The long and painstaking \r\nwork to build peace on our own island helps to inform \r\nand underpin our strong support for United Nations \r\npeacebuilding. \r\n Beyond our financial commitment to the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund, we endeavour to maintain \r\nsubstantial engagement in policy terms. In May of this \r\nyear, together with host country Egypt, we co-chaired a \r\nconference in Cairo on the theme “Post-conflict \r\npeacebuilding: contemporary challenges and the way \r\nforward”. The outcome of that conference, which \r\nincluded a range of specific recommendations, was \r\npresented to the Organizational Committee of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission (PBC). \r\n The peacebuilding task is not only inherently \r\ncomplex, it also has to be undertaken at a time when a \r\nsociety is exhausted and traumatized. It requires \r\nforging strong national institutions and capacities, \r\nwhich quite often are either non-existent or nascent, \r\nemerging as products of fragile peace agreements or \r\nhaving been significantly weakened over years of \r\nconflict. In such a context, the international community \r\nis challenged to provide support that is skilful, \r\nsensitive and sustained. \r\n The recently established United Nations \r\npeacebuilding architecture remains a work in progress. \r\nThe initial years have been ones of learning as well as \r\nof achievement. The Secretary-General’s report of last \r\nJune (A/63/881) sets out forthright recommendations, \r\nand the report of the Commission on its third session \r\n(A/64/341) also contains pertinent observations on the \r\nway forward. Those reports have commented on some \r\nof the principal lessons of the experience to date. There \r\nhave also been remarks in that regard during today’s \r\ndebate. Among them are the facts that national \r\nownership is critical and that the international \r\ncommunity’s role is one of support. Its task is to \r\nstrengthen and reinforce national efforts, not to \r\nsubstitute for them. \r\n The example of Sierra Leone is worth \r\nmentioning. It is one of the PBC country-specific \r\nconfigurations that works well. Ireland participates \r\nactively in it. As a significant donor to Sierra Leone, \r\nwe have committed to aligning all our future support \r\nwith the Government’s Agenda for Change, the \r\nnationally owned development plan. \r\n Secondly, the response must be timely and \r\nflexible. As the Secretary-General has pointed out, \r\nsuccessful peacebuilding depends on seizing make-or-\r\nbreak moments and providing the right amount of \r\nsupport at the right time. That does not necessarily \r\ncome easily to the United Nations. Except in \r\nemergency aid situations, we are not often fleet-footed. \r\nA conscious mode change may be required if those \r\nmake-or-break moments are to be grasped. As donors, \r\nwe need, at times, to be prepared to assume greater \r\nrisk. Monies should be available to fund innovative and \r\ncatalytic quick-impact projects. In exhausted and \r\nconflict-scarred communities, there must be a visible \r\npeace dividend to sustain the energy and commitment \r\nfor the long haul. \r\n Thirdly, with regard to continuity and coherence, \r\nrapid response has to be combined with longer-term \r\nvision. Fragility and instability will almost inevitably \r\ncontinue beyond the immediate aftermath of conflict. \r\nNational Governments face the daunting task of \r\nmoving their countries along the continuum from \r\nconflict and its aftermath to healthily functioning \r\nsocieties. \r\n The PBC is there to help after the media spotlight \r\nhas moved on. Long-term peacebuilding requires a \r\nseries of integrated and appropriately sequenced steps. \r\nThose include action on democratic accountability, \r\ngood governance, grievance mechanisms and human \r\nrights frameworks. The PBC could consider developing \r\nappropriate standards and guidance in those areas. The \r\nempowerment of women is another vital aspect of \r\npeacebuilding. The PBC should identify ways in which \r\nit can assist in the implementation of Security Council \r\nresolution 1325 (2000) and related resolutions. \r\n Coherence is critical to effective peacebuilding. \r\nWe need to establish strong linkages with other, \r\ndirectly relevant processes. For example, it makes no \r\n A/64/PV.50\r\n \r\n7 09-61775 \r\n \r\nsense, in either conceptual or practical terms, to \r\ncompartmentalize peacekeeping and peacebuilding. \r\nPeacebuilding experiences and priorities must fully \r\nfeed into the consultative exercise taking place in the \r\ncontext of the New Horizon paper of the Department of \r\nPeacekeeping Operations and the Department of Field \r\nSupport. There is also the linkage to system-wide \r\ncoherence. From the outset, Ireland has been a strong \r\nproponent of delivering as one. We believe that \r\nprogress made in that area can usefully inform our \r\nwork on peacebuilding. \r\n The recent blue paper on peacebuilding by the \r\nInternational Peace Institute makes for interesting \r\nreading. While acknowledging the achievements, it \r\nconsiders that “the peacebuilding architecture has yet \r\nto stamp its authority” and that the Peacebuilding \r\nSupport Office “has not yet been able to serve as the \r\nfocal point of peacebuilding within the United Nations \r\nsystem as originally envisaged”. Those measured \r\nassessments are scarcely surprising, given that we are \r\ndealing with such new constructs in such a complex \r\narea. \r\n Next year’s review of the PBC will be an \r\nopportunity to reflect on what is working well and \r\nwhere there is scope for adjustment or course \r\ncorrection. Especially since procedural issues initially \r\ntook up a disproportionate amount of time and energy, \r\nit is our hope that the review will maintain a firm focus \r\non what makes a difference in the field.  \r\n Given the importance that country-specific \r\nconfigurations have assumed in the PBC, the review \r\nwill provide an opportunity to consider a number of \r\nrelevant issues. Is there an overall appropriate number \r\nof those configurations? How do we ensure that \r\ncountries that could potentially benefit see real added \r\nvalue in the process, and are thus incentivized to enter? \r\nHow do we deal with exiting as well as entering, \r\nideally in circumstances where a country has advanced \r\nalong the spectrum but also if it has moved backwards \r\nto a point where the peacebuilding approach is no \r\nlonger a fit? \r\n There is, of course, a wider perspective. Since the \r\nnumber of country-specific configurations will always \r\nbe limited, the PBC will want to consider how it can \r\nbest make a contribution in the multiple conflict \r\nsituations that are not encompassed by those \r\nconfigurations. The final observation of the PBC \r\nreport — which emphasizes the need for reassessment \r\nto ensure a more strategic role for the Organizational \r\nCommittee — is relevant in that regard. \r\n Ireland will continue to contribute fully to the \r\nwork ahead. We know that building peace on our own \r\nisland would not have been possible without the \r\nsteadfast support of the international community. In \r\ngiving back, we are determined that the endeavours of \r\nthe United Nations in this field will have our \r\nunwavering support. \r\n Ms. Lucas (Luxembourg) (spoke in French): \r\nLuxembourg welcomes the holding of this debate on \r\nthe third report of the Peacebuilding Commission \r\n(PBC) (A/64/341) and the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the Peacebuilding Fund (A/64/217).  \r\n My country associates itself fully with the \r\nstatement delivered by the representative of Sweden on \r\nbehalf of the European Union. \r\n The axiom that there can be no security without \r\ndevelopment and no development without security, and \r\nthat both depend on respect for human rights, is \r\nespecially true in post-conflict situations. That is the \r\nraison d’être for the mandate of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, which, almost four years since it was \r\nestablished, continues to be as relevant as ever. \r\n Drawing on the lessons learned in its early years \r\nof operation, it seems to us clearer than ever that there \r\nis a role for the Commission in the institutional \r\narchitecture of the United Nations and that the PBC \r\nfills an obvious gap in the system itself.  \r\n If peace is to be lasting, the peacebuilding and \r\nreconciliation effort in the aftermath of conflict should \r\nbe undertaken in a coordinated, coherent and \r\ncomprehensive manner. That entails marshalling all \r\navailable resources and overcoming the customary \r\nstructural and organizational limitations.  \r\n The Commission has endeavoured to play its \r\ncoordinating role within and outside the Organization, \r\nand to strengthen the links between the various bodies \r\nof the United Nations, regional organizations and the \r\ninternational financial institutions. That coordination \r\nundertaking should be continued and further \r\nintensified, both on the ground and at Headquarters, by \r\ninvolving all stakeholders — political, economic, \r\nhumanitarian, security and development — as well as \r\ncivil society, in devising truly integrated strategies. \r\nA/64/PV.50  \r\n \r\n09-61775 8 \r\n \r\n In that regard, we welcome the fact that the \r\nSecurity Council has taken on board the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission’s recommendations and transformed the \r\nmissions in Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone and the \r\nCentral African Republic into integrated peacebuilding \r\nmissions. The Commission’s consultative role in the \r\narea of peacebuilding vis-à-vis the Council could — \r\nand should, in our view — be strengthened in the \r\nfuture, above all at the stage when the Security Council \r\nis developing mandates for peacekeeping operations. It \r\nseems to us that adhering to a strictly sequential \r\napproach to peacekeeping and peacebuilding is \r\nincreasingly a contrived, if not counter-productive, way \r\nto address those matters. \r\n There is also a need to strengthen the relationship \r\nbetween the Peacebuilding Commission and the \r\nEconomic and Social Council, another principal organ \r\nof the United Nations. By virtue of its unique know-\r\nhow and experience with respect to the problems \r\nassociated with countries emerging from conflict, the \r\nEconomic and Social Council can in many ways make \r\na meaningful contribution to the Commission’s efforts. \r\nThat is why, in my capacity as President of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council last year, I worked with \r\nCommission Chairperson Ambassador Muñoz to foster \r\ncloser cooperation.  \r\n Those efforts have begun to produce results. \r\nThus, the President participated in several debates \r\nwithin the Economic and Social Council on the specific \r\nchallenges and needs of post-conflict countries. \r\nFurthermore, on 29 October, the Council and the \r\nCommission, in partnership with the World Food \r\nProgramme, held their first joint meeting, in which \r\nthey examined the impact of the food and economic \r\ncrises on post-conflict countries. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral also took part in that meeting. The Economic \r\nand Social Council, during its substantive session, \r\ncalled for enhanced engagement with the Commission, \r\nincluding its various country-specific configurations.  \r\n With regard to the implementation of the second \r\npart of the Commission’s mandate — the mobilization \r\nof resources — the Commission should continue and \r\nenhance its awareness-raising activities both with \r\ntraditional donors and non-traditional partners such as \r\ndiasporas, private foundations and the private sector, in \r\nparticular in this time of crisis.  \r\n The peace dividend should not remain a hollow \r\nconcept. People in the countries affected should see a \r\nspecific improvement of their situation, even if it \r\ninvolves more risk-taking on the part of donors with \r\nregard to regular development financing. The \r\nPeacebuilding Commission should, in our opinion, also \r\nencourage donors in post-conflict countries to better \r\ncoordinate and align their assistance with the priorities \r\nestablished in national development strategies, in close \r\ncooperation with the countries affected, which must \r\nshoulder their own responsibilities in peacebuilding.  \r\n In recent years, the country-specific \r\nconfigurations have played a growing role in shaping \r\nopinions and strategic recommendations on setting \r\npriorities for financing and the use of the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund. We commend that activity. The \r\neffectiveness of the Fund can certainly be improved, in \r\nparticular by implementing the key principles laid out \r\nin the revised mandate, such as transparency, \r\nflexibility, rapid response, the catalyst effect and \r\nbeneficiary ownership of programmes. However, the \r\nFund can undoubtedly still play an important support \r\nrole in terms of establishing lasting peace. Luxembourg \r\ntherefore intends to maintain its financial support to \r\nthe Fund and in more general terms to peacebuilding \r\nactivities.  \r\n Mr. Grauls (Belgium), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n The Commission’s success will be broadly \r\nmeasured by its ability to ensure that countries on its \r\nagenda do not relapse into conflict and to produce \r\nconcrete results for the people on the ground. It should, \r\nhowever, also be endowed with the means — more so \r\nthan it is today — to advise other post-conflict \r\ncountries. The Peacebuilding Commission should be \r\nrelevant to a larger number of countries.  \r\n If peace is to be sustainable, short-term security \r\ngoals should be targeted, while medium- and long-term \r\ndevelopment objectives are also pursued. Maintaining \r\npeace and security requires a lasting commitment from \r\nthe international community, in terms of both \r\nprevention and of re-establishing peace and \r\nreconstruction. For this reason, it is crucial to invest \r\nsimultaneously in mediation and conflict prevention \r\nefforts in order to ensure that violence does not recur.  \r\n While Luxembourg’s membership in the \r\nOrganizational Committee of the PBC is to expire on \r\n31 December, I assure members that Luxembourg \r\nintends to remain fully engaged in the work of the \r\n A/64/PV.50\r\n \r\n9 09-61775 \r\n \r\nCommission, since we believe now more than ever that \r\nits work is crucial. \r\n Mr. Sial (Pakistan): The institution of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission (PBC) represents a \r\ncollective recognition by the Member States of the \r\ninextricable relationship between peace and \r\ndevelopment and the need for a comprehensive \r\napproach to peace. As a founding member, Pakistan \r\ncontributed to the work of the Commission in its \r\nformative phase. As the Commission diversifies its \r\nscope and area of work, we remain deeply committed \r\nto its success. \r\n I thank Ambassador Heraldo Muñoz of Chile for \r\nskilfully guiding the work of the Commission as its \r\nChair and for his introduction of the Commission’s \r\nreport (A/64/341). We are also thankful to the Chairs of \r\ncountry-specific configurations with respect to \r\nBurundi, the Central African Republic, Guinea-Bissau \r\nand Sierra Leone. We note that the various \r\nconfigurations of the PBC have met regularly and \r\naddressed important issues pertaining to their \r\nrespective areas. I also take this opportunity to thank \r\nthe Peacebuilding Support Office for its important \r\ncontribution to our work. \r\n During the Commission’s third session, its main \r\nfocus was on peacebuilding in the four situations on its \r\nagenda: Burundi, Sierra Leone, Guinea-Bissau and the \r\nCentral African Republic. In the case of the first two \r\ncountries, this was the Commission’s third year of \r\nengagement. We are happy to note the progress in terms \r\nof substantive work to ensure the durability of peace \r\ngains and that such gains respond to the socio-economic \r\nneeds of the peoples. The framework for the \r\nCommission’s engagement with those two countries \r\nprescribes integrated strategies leading to specific \r\nworkplans with targeted objectives. This is a pragmatic \r\napproach that must be driven by national ownership, \r\nconsultations and initiatives at the field level. \r\n In the case of Sierra Leone, a realignment of the \r\ncountry’s focus with the Commission’s work was \r\ncarried out to address particular priority issues in terms \r\nof governance, role of law and employment issues. The \r\nrealignment points to the evolving nature of the \r\nCommission’s work. We hope that important lessons \r\nwill be learned in the process to the benefit of the \r\nfuture work of the Commission. \r\n The Commission’s engagement with Guinea-\r\nBissau and the Central African Republic is relatively \r\nrecent. It is satisfying to note that the strategic \r\nframeworks for the Commission’s engagement with \r\nthese countries have been finalized and that work under \r\nboth structures has started. The progress achieved thus \r\nfar deserves our appreciation, particularly in the case \r\nof Guinea-Bissau, where the violent incidents of March \r\nand June posed a significant challenge to the \r\nCommission’s work. \r\n Apart from describing the Commission’s work, the \r\nreport offers observations on outstanding issues and \r\nenumerates a way forward. We suggest a three-layered \r\nstrategy to further strengthen the structure and \r\nfunctioning of the Commission: first, build solid \r\npartnerships with the United Nations system, \r\ninternational financial institutions and individual donors \r\nwith a view to expanding the Commission’s resource \r\nbase; secondly, seek pragmatic frameworks of operation \r\nwith the countries on the agenda, targeting priority areas \r\nin an environment of national ownership; and thirdly, \r\nenhance the visibility of the Commission and its work \r\nthrough a robust outreach plan aimed at achieving a \r\nprofile that is commensurate with its noble work. \r\n While the Commission has made important \r\nprogress over the past three years, it is barely out of its \r\nformative phase. Accordingly, it may be too early to \r\npass judgment on its work in terms of success or \r\nfailure. Considering the inherent difficulties presented \r\nby the complex situations on its agenda, the \r\nperformance of the Peacebuilding Commission is by \r\nany measure commendable. \r\n The provision of adequate resources is an \r\nessential requirement for comprehensive peacebuilding \r\nefforts. In this context, the Peacebuilding Fund is an \r\nindispensable component of the overall peacebuilding \r\narchitecture. The Secretary-General’s report (A/64/217) \r\nnotes the initial success achieved by this funding \r\ninstrument. It is gratifying to note the steady rise of the \r\nFund’s portfolio growth over the past three years. A \r\nrobust accountability framework, as suggested by the \r\nSecretary-General, is essential to ensuring transparency \r\nand oversight. In terms of disbursals, it is equally \r\nimportant to keep the interests of the recipient \r\ncountries paramount in designing the projects \r\nresourced from the Fund. At the same time, we hope \r\nthat the Fund itself will be guided in its objectives and \r\nterms of reference by resolution 63/282. The Fund’s \r\ncapacity will increase if the Fund is flexible and \r\nresponsive and complements the work of the \r\nCommission. \r\nA/64/PV.50  \r\n \r\n09-61775 10 \r\n \r\n In conclusion, I would like to say that the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission has shown great promise in \r\naddressing the complex challenges entailed in its \r\nmandate. The Commission can deliver only with our full \r\nsupport. The international community has the resources \r\nand the capability to offer a collective solution to the \r\nproblems of poverty, hunger and disease generated by \r\nviolence and conflict. The Peacebuilding Commission is \r\na viable tool to offer such collective solutions. \r\n Mr. Zhang Yesui (China) (spoke in Chinese): \r\nThe Chinese delegation welcomes the report of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission (A/64/341) on its third \r\nsession and the report (A/64/217) on the activities of \r\nthe Peacebuilding Fund (PBF) submitted by Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon. I wish to take this opportunity \r\nto thank Ambassador Heraldo Muñoz, Chairman of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission (PBC), for his diligent \r\nwork over the past year. \r\n The establishment of the PBC is an important \r\naccomplishment in the framework of United Nations \r\nreform undertaken since the 2005 World Summit. It \r\nmarked a new and substantive step forward in United \r\nNations peacebuilding endeavours. Over the past few \r\nyears, pursuant to its mandates under General \r\nAssembly and Security Council resolutions, the PBC \r\nhas provided vigorous assistance of various kinds to \r\nthe four countries on its agenda — Sierra Leone, \r\nBurundi, Guinea-Bissau and the Central African \r\nRepublic — in the light of their respective national \r\nsituations. The PBF has provided financial assistance \r\nto 12 countries, extending the exemplary role and \r\ninfluence of United Nations peacebuilding efforts. \r\n The challenges facing United Nations \r\npeacebuilding endeavours deserve due attention. \r\nEnsuring that post-conflict countries embark on \r\npeaceful reconstruction and avoid relapsing into \r\nconflict and turbulence is a major task facing the \r\ninternational community. This has brought the \r\nimportance of United Nations peacebuilding \r\nendeavours into sharper relief. I would like to make the \r\nfollowing four points on how to improve and \r\nstrengthen United Nations peacebuilding efforts. \r\n First, the United Nations should adopt an \r\nintegrated approach to coordinate peacemaking, \r\npeacekeeping and peacebuilding efforts. The United \r\nNations needs to put more energy into preventive \r\ndiplomacy, to avoid the outbreak of conflicts and \r\nreduce the global need for peacekeeping operations and \r\npost-conflict reconstruction efforts. To ensure a smooth \r\ntransition from peacekeeping to peacebuilding, the \r\nSecurity Council should take peacebuilding into \r\nconsideration when it deploys peacekeeping operations. \r\nAt the same time, there should be a clear division of \r\nlabour between peacekeeping and peacebuilding \r\nendeavours to avoid duplication of efforts. \r\n Secondly, the PBC should strengthen its \r\npartnership with recipient countries. Recipient \r\ncountries have the primary responsibility for their own \r\npeacebuilding efforts. Not only are they the recipients \r\nof assistance, but they should also become partners for \r\ndialogue on an equal footing and should be fully \r\nentitled to air their views on identifying the priority \r\nareas for assistance. The PBC should take full account \r\nof the priority development projects identified by \r\nrecipient countries themselves and should establish \r\npeacebuilding strategies in accordance with these \r\ncountries’ specific conditions. In carrying out \r\npeacebuilding strategies, the PBC needs to focus on \r\nstrengthening capacity-building and human resources \r\ntraining in recipient countries and should make full use \r\nof their domestic human resources and expertise. \r\n Thirdly, the PBC should use the 2010 \r\ncomprehensive review as an opportunity to make \r\nfurther progress on institutional development. We hope \r\nPBC members will increase consultation, accommodate \r\none another’s concerns and achieve a smooth transition \r\nbetween old and new members. We also hope the PBC \r\nwill reduce the number of its meetings, improve their \r\nefficiency and ensure their quality. In identifying the \r\npriority areas for peacebuilding endeavours, we hope \r\nthe PBC will not only focus on security sector reform, \r\nprotection of human rights and promotion of the rule of \r\nlaw, but also put greater emphasis on the deep-seated \r\nproblems that triggered the conflicts, including those \r\nhaving to do with economic and social development. \r\n Fourthly, the fund-raising role of the PBF should \r\nbe given full play. Sufficient financial input provides \r\nthe basic underpinnings for the success of \r\npeacebuilding efforts. The PBF and multilateral and \r\nbilateral donors have invested a great deal of resources \r\nin peacebuilding endeavours and have played a \r\npositive role, but they still fall short of meeting every \r\nneed. Further play must be given to the Fund’s role as a \r\ncatalyst in order not only to provide emergency \r\nfinancial assistance to the recipient countries, but also \r\nto attract long-term development assistance to the \r\ncountries concerned. China supports improvement of \r\n A/64/PV.50\r\n \r\n11 09-61775 \r\n \r\nthe work of the PBF to speed up financial disbursement \r\nand strengthen the performance evaluation and \r\naccountability of projects. \r\n Ms. Dumont (France) (spoke in French): I would \r\nlike to thank the President of the Assembly for having \r\norganized today’s debate, which comes at a particularly \r\nopportune time. I fully endorse the statement made this \r\nmorning by the representative of Sweden on behalf of \r\nthe European Union, and I would like to add a few \r\nbrief comments. \r\n The Peacebuilding Commission (PBC), which is \r\na significant institutional innovation, is aimed at \r\nimproving the coherence of the international \r\ncommunity’s interventions in countries emerging from \r\ncrisis in the immediate aftermath of conflict. This \r\nincludes the entire United Nations family, international \r\nfinancial institutions, regional organizations and \r\nbilateral donors. The Commission’s role is to draft \r\nintegrated strategies for peacebuilding for the countries \r\non its agenda, strategies adapted to each country and \r\ninvolving all of the different stakeholders engaged in \r\nmanaging the post-conflict situation. It does so by \r\nproviding a road map for the affected countries and \r\ntheir partners.  \r\n The Peacebuilding Commission has already \r\nachieved some results in the four countries currently on \r\nits agenda. The country-specific configurations mean \r\nthat coherence in international assistance can be \r\nensured. Their effectiveness, however, needs further \r\nimprovement. \r\n With the review planned for 2010, we are arriving \r\nat a key stage. France hopes that through that review \r\nprocess, which was agreed on by the entire General \r\nAssembly and the Security Council in 2005, the PBC \r\nwill be able to strengthen the role it plays in \r\ncoordinating efforts and thus apply its added value to \r\nthe key areas that will enable the establishment of \r\nlasting peace. The Peacebuilding Fund must be a useful \r\ntool at the disposal of the PBC. Through the PBF, the \r\nPBC must better monitor financial project, in order to \r\nensure coherence in the financial measures taken by the \r\ninternational community. It would undoubtedly be \r\nbeneficial to think about how to better focus the \r\nfinancial interventions of the Fund on the countries on \r\nthe agenda of the Commission. We would also like the \r\nadministrative management of the Fund to be \r\nimproved. The new terms of reference allow for this \r\nand should be implemented.  \r\n We also commend the Peacebuilding Support \r\nOffice and its new head, Ms. Cheng-Hopkins, and we \r\nencourage her to continue her work in support of the \r\ndrawing up of peacebuilding strategies, the mobilizing \r\nof resources and the strengthening of international \r\ncoordination.  \r\n It is crucial to take peacebuilding issues into \r\naccount already during the first stages of dealing with a \r\ncrisis and in planning a peacekeeping mission. We are \r\nin favour of strengthening the relations between the \r\nCommission and the Security Council, as the \r\nSecretary-General recommended in his report \r\n(A/63/881) on peacebuilding in the immediate \r\naftermath of conflict.  \r\n France fully supports the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, and would like all Member States to do \r\nthe same. France supports the renewal process of the \r\nCommission and encourages it to continue its work. \r\n Mr. Goledzinowski (Australia): I would like to \r\nthank the President of the General Assembly for the \r\nopportunity to speak today on this important topic. \r\n Post-conflict peacebuilding is one of the \r\nfundamental challenges of our time. Collectively, we \r\nneed to help prevent post-conflict societies from \r\nslipping once again into conflict. In 2005, our leaders \r\nemphasized the need for us to take a coordinated, \r\ncoherent and integrated approach to post-conflict \r\npeacebuilding. With that end in mind, our leaders \r\ndecided to establish the Peacebuilding Commission.  \r\n We all know that the challenges of peacebuilding \r\nare not solely the remit of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, nor of the United Nations more broadly. \r\nThe Secretary-General’s report (A/63/881) on post-\r\nconflict peacebuilding from earlier this year provided a \r\nvaluable assessment of the international community’s \r\nengagement in peacebuilding activities and identified a \r\nnumber of areas in which the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission and the Peacebuilding Fund could \r\ncontribute. \r\n Today’s consideration of the reports on the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and the Peacebuilding \r\nFund provides us with an opportunity to assess the \r\nrespective contributions of these bodies to international \r\npeacebuilding efforts and to assess whether they have \r\nbeen meeting the expectations set for them by our \r\nleaders in 2005. \r\nA/64/PV.50  \r\n \r\n09-61775 12 \r\n \r\n I would like to commend Ambassador Muñoz for \r\nhis presentation of the third annual report of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission (A/64/341). The report \r\nclearly articulates the activities of the Commission, \r\nboth through its Organizational Committee and, more \r\nconcretely, through its country-specific configurations. \r\nIn the years ahead, we should be increasingly looking \r\nto the Commission to deliver country-specific tangible \r\nresults as a demonstration of its contribution to the \r\nbroader peacebuilding effort. \r\n We would encourage the Commission to continue \r\nto evaluate the contribution that it brings to the \r\ncountries on its agenda and to engage in outreach to \r\npromote this contribution. We would further encourage \r\nthe Commission to continue to refine and diversify its \r\nworking methods to ensure that it remains responsive \r\nto the needs of those countries on its agenda, as well as \r\nthose perhaps looking to be included on its agenda. \r\n One issue that is raised in the Commission’s \r\nreport and in the Secretary-General’s earlier report on \r\npost-conflict peacebuilding is the need to broaden and \r\ndeepen the pool of civilian expertise and volunteers for \r\npeacebuilding. My country, Australia, has recently \r\nannounced the establishment of a deployable civilian \r\ncapacity to assist with stabilization and recovery efforts \r\nin post-conflict countries. We look forward to working \r\nclosely with the United Nations and the Commission to \r\nensure that our deployable civilian capacity fits well \r\nwith others and contributes to broadening the pool of \r\ncivilian expertise, including through mobilization of \r\ncapacity from the global South. \r\n I would also like to thank the Secretary-General \r\nfor his report on the Peacebuilding Fund (A/64/217). \r\nThe report demonstrates that the Fund is filling a \r\ncritical niche in the area of peacebuilding. The Fund \r\nhas undergone significant improvement in the past 12 \r\nmonths. Australia welcomes the revision of the terms \r\nof reference for the Fund, which has strengthened its \r\ncapacity to serve as a flexible, responsive and risk-\r\ntaking resource for peacebuilding support. We continue \r\nto support the use of the Fund as a catalytic tool for \r\nkey peacebuilding priorities. \r\n When we established the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission in 2005, we undertook to review it in \r\n2010. That review will provide all Member States with \r\nan opportunity to reinvigorate their engagement with \r\nthe Commission and to assess further its place in the \r\nbroader international peacebuilding architecture. It will \r\nalso be an opportunity to listen to the experiences of \r\npost-conflict countries, to take stock of the \r\nCommission’s successes and to demonstrate to Member \r\nStates and other peacebuilding actors the valuable \r\ncontribution the Commission can make to countries on \r\nits agenda. \r\n Mrs. Gallardo Hernández (El Salvador) (spoke \r\nin Spanish): I wish to express my delegation’s gratitude \r\nfor the initiative of holding this joint debate on the \r\nannual report of the Peacebuilding Commission on its \r\nthird session (A/64/341) and the report on the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund (A/64/217). We are also grateful to \r\nthe Secretary-General for the documents and reports \r\nprovided and for his valuable contribution to the work \r\nof the Peacebuilding Commission through the \r\nPeacebuilding Support Office. We also welcome his \r\nleadership at the head of the Peacebuilding Fund.  \r\n El Salvador has been committed from the outset \r\nto the very essence of the Commission, in the belief \r\nthat the establishment of this body constitutes a crucial \r\nbuilding block for the international peacebuilding \r\narchitecture, as it assists countries in post-conflict \r\nsituations to entrench lasting peace with sustainable \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n Today, the General Assembly is considering the \r\nreport on the third session of the Commission. In \r\nchronological terms, we are about to close the first \r\nfive-year cycle of the Commission, which, since its \r\ninception, has supported post-conflict countries.  \r\n At this point, my delegation does not intend to \r\ntake stock of the achievements, obstacles and \r\nchallenges the Peacebuilding Commission has faced in \r\nits first years of existence. The time for doing so will \r\nbe during the review process to take place in 2010, in \r\nwhich my country wishes to participate actively. We \r\nwould like to do so, as members are aware, based on \r\nour own experience as a post-conflict country. My \r\ncountry has demonstrated its political will without, \r\nhowever, forgetting that we must remain alert, as any \r\npost-conflict country, in order to prevent any new \r\noutbreaks of violence that could be generated by \r\nglobalization and the new geopolitical context.  \r\n El Salvador believes that the establishment of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission represented a turning point \r\nin the perception and management of the inherent links \r\nbetween peacekeeping operations, peacebuilding and \r\nthe promotion of development in countries emerging \r\nfrom conflict. \r\n A/64/PV.50\r\n \r\n13 09-61775 \r\n \r\n Likewise, the Commission’s work gives us the \r\nopportunity to focus afresh, and perhaps with a broader \r\nperspective, on the various components that contribute \r\nto propagating, maintaining and suppressing conflict in \r\nthe countries on the Commission’s agenda. It also \r\nenables us to recognize that each conflict has its own \r\nparticular features that can be overcome only with a \r\nspecific approach. Otherwise we run the risk of \r\ngeneralizing the particular causes and dynamics that \r\nled to conflict in each of the countries the Commission \r\nis currently working with. \r\n El Salvador acknowledges the leadership \r\ndemonstrated by Ambassador Heraldo Muñoz, \r\nPermanent Representative of Chile, as Chair of the \r\nCommission, and of the other members of the Bureau. \r\nWe wish to highlight particularly his commitment to \r\nstrengthening the Commission’s relationships with the \r\nprincipal organs of the United Nations. In particular, he \r\nhas worked to strengthen the links with the Economic \r\nand Social Council. My delegation has frequently stated \r\nthat the Commission must truly interact with the \r\nEconomic and Social Council, and in particular has \r\ncalled on the PBC to make the most of the Council’s \r\naccumulated experience in the area of operational \r\ndevelopment activities, as well as the work of the \r\nAd Hoc Advisory Groups on African countries emerging \r\nfrom conflict and the Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti. \r\n In this context, we welcome the Economic and \r\nSocial Council’s invitation to the Chair of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission to participate in the \r\nsubstantive part of its session, as well as the special \r\nevent on food and economic crises in post-conflict \r\ncountries, jointly organized by the Commission, the \r\nEconomic and Social Council and the World Food \r\nProgramme in Geneva. These activities are a positive \r\nstep in the task of strengthening the Commission’s \r\nrelations with the principal organs of the United \r\nNations. Similarly, we support the Chair’s efforts \r\ntowards improving public awareness and the visibility \r\nof the work of the Commission. \r\n With regard to the work of the Commission on \r\nthe country-specific configurations, El Salvador \r\nacknowledges the efforts made by the Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of Belgium, Brazil, Canada and \r\nSwitzerland as Chairs of the country-specific \r\nconfigurations. We also note with a degree of optimism \r\nthe major progress made in those countries in \r\nresponding to the enormous challenges of post-conflict \r\npeacebuilding. We also acknowledge the importance \r\nthe Commission gives to the full application of the \r\nprinciple of national ownership, which constitutes the \r\nfundamental basis for directing international efforts \r\ntowards the national priorities established by the \r\nGovernments of the countries in question. Beyond this, \r\nour participation in the Addis Ababa meeting with the \r\nAfrican Union compels us to stress the need to build \r\nbetter synergy for coordination and communication \r\nwith regional organizations. \r\n El Salvador remains convinced of the great \r\nimportance of the role played by the Working Group on \r\nLessons Learned, which we have been honoured to \r\nchair. In our opinion, this Working Group is an \r\nessential component, due to the broad role it has played \r\nin the PBC architecture as a discussion forum open \r\nboth to Member States and to civil society. In this \r\nforum we can examine the various elements that come \r\ntogether to create or worsen conflict, as well as the \r\nactions undertaken to deal with them by various \r\nplayers. This is a forum for considering the medium- \r\nand long-term strategic issues that the international \r\ncommunity should be focusing on in order to learn \r\nfrom the mistakes — or from the best practices that \r\nhave made it possible to tackle successfully different \r\nsituations in various countries — by incorporating such \r\nexperience into the Commission’s broad strategy and \r\npolicies. It is also important to recognize the need to \r\nmake more effective use of this valuable experience \r\nand incorporate it into specific actions implemented in \r\nthe current country-specific configurations, so that we \r\ncan contribute to a faster transition from conflict to \r\npeacebuilding and sustainable development. \r\n Concerning the Peacebuilding Fund, El Salvador \r\nacknowledges the generosity and solidarity of the \r\ndonor countries and highlights the contribution the \r\nFund has made to the peacebuilding efforts in the four \r\ncountries on the PBC agenda. We also consider it \r\nimportant that it has contributed to five additional \r\ncountries, since it has been determined that they meet \r\nthe requirements for being a part of the programme. \r\nDespite these important achievements, however, we are \r\nconvinced that there is room for improvement, in order \r\nto continue increasing the Fund’s effectiveness and \r\ncatalytic effect, which in future should definitely take a \r\ndegree of geographic balance into consideration. We \r\nalso believe that coordination between the Fund and \r\nthe PBC, and their shared strategic vision, can be \r\nfurther strengthened, in keeping with the spirit \r\nestablished in the Commission’s founding resolutions. \r\nA/64/PV.50  \r\n \r\n09-61775 14 \r\n \r\n In conclusion, my delegation hopes that this issue \r\nand others we have mentioned will be considered in the \r\nreview process planned for 2010. Allow me to reaffirm \r\nthe willingness of the Government of El Salvador to \r\ncontinue to contribute its experience as a post-conflict \r\ncountry. I assure the international community that we \r\nknow that, although almost 18 years have passed since \r\nour peace agreements were signed, many challenges, \r\nborn of the post-conflict situation, remain. We must be \r\non our guard to ensure that violence does not return \r\nagain. \r\n Mr. Momen (Bangladesh): I would like to thank \r\nthe President for convening this joint debate on post-\r\nconflict peacebuilding and the Peacebuilding Fund. My \r\ndelegation aligns itself with the statement delivered by \r\nthe representative of Jamaica on behalf of the caucus of \r\ncountries of the Non-Aligned Movement in the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission (PBC). In addition, \r\nhowever, I would like in my national capacity to \r\nhighlight the following points. \r\n We welcome the third annual report of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, contained in document \r\nA/64/341, reflecting the activities of the Commission \r\nfrom 23 June 2008 to 30 June 2009. We commend the \r\nwork of the Commission in the third year since its \r\nfounding, through country-specific configuration \r\nmeetings, including utilizing the evolving integrated \r\npeacebuilding strategies as frameworks for advancing \r\npeacebuilding in ways that respond to the differing \r\nneeds of the four countries now on its agenda. \r\n My delegation notes with satisfaction the \r\nfollowing notable outcomes of the Commission’s work \r\nduring the reporting period: first, the adoption of \r\nStrategic Frameworks for Peacebuilding in Guinea-\r\nBissau and the Central African Republic; secondly, the \r\nadoption of conclusions on the second and third \r\nbiannual reviews of the implementation of the Strategic \r\nFramework for Peacebuilding in Burundi; and thirdly, \r\napproval of the Government of Sierra Leone’s Agenda \r\nfor Change as the core strategic document for guiding \r\nall future national and international development \r\nefforts. \r\n The PBC has continued to strengthen its links \r\nwith the General Assembly, the Security Council and \r\nthe Economic and Social Council. My delegation \r\nparticularly welcomes its efforts to intensify its \r\nrelationship with the Economic and Social Council on \r\nthe important nexus among security, recovery from \r\nconflict and development. My delegation fully \r\nendorses the Commission Chair’s conclusion in \r\npresenting the report that  \r\n “The Commission combines a unique link to the \r\nthree principal organs of the United Nations, a \r\nunique composition of membership and a unique \r\ndegree of flexibility to engage non-United \r\nNations and non-governmental actors. Thus, the \r\nCommission could, in particular, promote a \r\nseamless transition from humanitarian to early \r\nrecovery assistance, synergy between \r\npeacekeeping and peacebuilding mandates and \r\nnational capacity development in critical \r\npeacebuilding priorities.” (A/64/PV.49) \r\nWe further welcome the Commission’s continued \r\nefforts towards expanding partnerships with different \r\nnational, regional and international actors, including \r\nUnited Nations agencies, funds and programmes, \r\ninternational financial institutions, regional \r\norganizations, the private sector and civil society. \r\n We are encouraged by the important discussions \r\nthat the Committee convened on enhancing the \r\ncapacity of the PBC to fulfil its resource mobilization \r\nmandate, employment and income generation and \r\nprivate sector development in post-conflict countries; \r\non the implications of the financial crisis for countries \r\nemerging from conflict; and, most recently, on the \r\nprospects for the mandated 2010 review of the United \r\nNations peacebuilding architecture and on improving \r\nengagement with countries seeking the Commission’s \r\nadvice. We also take note of the Chair’s tireless efforts \r\nin undertaking a number of activities in order to raise \r\nglobal awareness of the challenges that countries \r\nemerging from conflict face and to enhance the \r\nCommission’s visibility on the ground. \r\n My delegation would like to reiterate its \r\nprincipled position on the following issues. First, the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission should have the central role \r\nin post-conflict peacebuilding and reconciliation. The \r\nPBC, in institutional harmony with the Peacebuilding \r\nFund and the Peacebuilding Support Office, should act \r\nas the spearhead for a coordinated, coherent and \r\nintegrated peacebuilding architecture as outlined in its \r\nfounding resolutions, General Assembly resolution \r\n60/180 and Security Council resolution 1645 (2005).  \r\n Secondly, my delegation strongly emphasizes the \r\nprinciple that post-conflict societies must take charge \r\nof their own destiny. The work of the PBC should be \r\n A/64/PV.50\r\n \r\n15 09-61775 \r\n \r\nbased on national ownership and national priorities. We \r\nrecommend that, to further the work of the PBC, \r\npluralist political institutions be built, peace \r\nconstituencies be created, the root causes of conflict be \r\nidentified, an environment of mutual trust, confidence \r\nand tolerance be restored, a process of societal \r\nreconciliation and healing be established, justice and \r\nfair rule of law be allowed to take root and government \r\nmachinery be overhauled to lead the process of \r\ndemocratization. We also emphasize the importance of \r\ngovernmental efforts being properly supported by the \r\ninternational financial institutions and other \r\norganizations, the private sector, civil society, \r\ndevelopment partners and all other stakeholders, both \r\nexternal and domestic. \r\n Thirdly, we very much agree with the concept of \r\na more rapid and flexible funding mechanism. \r\nDisbursement of the multi-donor trust funds and other \r\nfunds should be rapid and immediate to ensure early \r\nstabilization of countries emerging from conflict. This \r\nis required for support to national and local authorities \r\nin delivering a peace dividend. However, we reiterate \r\nthat one of the main purposes of the PBC, as depicted \r\nin its founding resolutions, is to marshal resources for \r\nreconstruction and institution-building in countries \r\nemerging from conflict. Therefore, the PBC should \r\nhave a central role in any discussion regarding the \r\ncreation of new rapid funding mechanisms. \r\n Finally, for early recovery, our focus should be on \r\nidentifying approaches that would offer a sustainable \r\nnational political dialogue aimed at reconciliation \r\namong the parties to the conflict with participation \r\nfrom all stakeholders — local, national and regional — \r\nincluding international partners. Women’s involvement \r\nwould be key to that process. Integrated needs \r\nassessment, including prioritization, should be conducted \r\nin consultations with all stakeholders. Unity of vision \r\nshould be maintained while designing a clear and \r\ncoordinated mandate to define the leadership role of \r\nthe United Nations agencies on the ground. This should \r\nbe articulated in the early stages to avoid duplication of \r\nefforts and inefficient use of scarce resources. \r\n We strongly feel that women’s empowerment and \r\nthe involvement of civil society and non-governmental \r\norganizations (NGOs) in development activities at the \r\nlocal level could significantly contribute to the process \r\nof achieving sustainable economic growth leading to \r\nsustainable peace and development in post-conflict \r\ncountries. Bangladesh offers to share its tested and \r\nwell-recognized practices in integrating civil society \r\nand development NGOs with public authorities in \r\nnation-building endeavours. In this context I am happy \r\nto note that a leading non-governmental organization \r\nbased in Bangladesh, the Bangladesh Rural \r\nAdvancement Committee (BRAC) — which is the \r\nlargest NGO in Bangladesh and probably in the world, \r\nwith its wide-ranging operations in poverty alleviation, \r\nempowerment of the poor, health, education, \r\ncommunity development, agriculture and microfinance \r\ndevelopment projects — has recently begun to help \r\nresidents of Kroo Bay and other communities in Sierra \r\nLeone and other countries in Africa. \r\n We would further like to refer to our post-\r\nliberation experiences, whereby we have learned the \r\nimportance of domestic initiatives such as home-grown \r\nideas like microcredit to address poverty and non-formal \r\nprimary education. In a similar vein, proven initiatives \r\nsuch as cooperative arrangements for agriculture \r\ndevelopment, establishment of targeted small and \r\nmedium-sized enterprises through community-based \r\norganization and microfinancing projects could be \r\npursued. These would provide invaluable opportunities \r\nfor creating jobs, which, in effect, can re-engage young \r\npeople, ex-combatants in particular. My delegation \r\nwould be happy to share our experiences regarding \r\ncooperative arrangements in agriculture development \r\nas well as microfinancing projects in establishing and \r\ncreating successful small enterprises.  \r\n Countries emerging from conflict at times need \r\nnational digital identification cards, or IDs, that help \r\nthe Government and election commissions to prepare \r\nnon-controversial, transparent and accurate voter lists. \r\nBangladesh has the experience and expertise, having \r\nissued nearly 90 million national IDs in recent years, \r\nand we can share our expertise with emerging \r\ncountries. \r\n Peacebuilding is an area that may contribute to \r\nfurther defining the image of the Organization in the \r\ncoming years. The envisaged 2010 review of the \r\nCommission called for in its founding resolutions, in \r\nthis context, will provide a good opportunity to further \r\nbuild on the experiences it has gained and lessons that \r\nhave been learned, define its potential role in support \r\nof an expanding United Nations peacebuilding agenda \r\nand enhance its support to countries emerging from \r\nconflict. The 2010 review will be charting an important \r\ncourse for the future relevance of the United Nations in \r\ntackling post-conflict situations. My delegation looks \r\nA/64/PV.50  \r\n \r\n09-61775 16 \r\n \r\nforward to working in close collaboration with all \r\nconcerned. \r\n A key element of the vision that led to the \r\ncreation of the PBC was the need for a new twenty-\r\nfirst-century machinery that could energize all to \r\nactively integrate peacebuilding tools in order to allow \r\npeace processes to bear fruit. The efforts of the PBC to \r\nachieve coherence have attracted increased attention. \r\nAlso, the recent decisions of the Security Council to set \r\nup integrated peacebuilding missions have been widely \r\nrecognized. We welcome such successful steps in that \r\nregard. \r\n The need for further coherence in peacebuilding \r\nefforts gradually seems to be beginning to take hold at \r\nthe United Nations. The penultimate paragraph of the \r\nSecurity Council presidential statement of 5 August \r\n(S/PRST/2009/24) recognizes the importance of \r\nintroducing peacebuilding elements into peacekeeping \r\noperations before they are transferred to the PBC. But \r\nthat recognition remains to be translated in any \r\ncountry-specific context. \r\n In conclusion, may I say that Bangladesh’s \r\ncommitment to peace and security in post-conflict \r\ncountries has a deep emotional basis, given that \r\nBangladeshi peacekeepers, while serving in United \r\nNations peacekeeping operations in such countries, \r\noften under very difficult situations, have been able to \r\nestablish strong bonds with ordinary local residents, \r\nthereby winning their confidence and, more important, \r\ntheir hearts. We would not, and therefore cannot, shy \r\naway from any effort aimed at the overall well-being of \r\nthe people of post-conflict societies. \r\n Mr. Loulichki (Morocco) (spoke in French): It is \r\na real pleasure to take the floor under your leadership, \r\nSir. We commend your commitment and your very \r\nvaluable contribution to the work of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, of which both our countries are members.  \r\n At the outset, I should also like to thank \r\nAmbassador Heraldo Muñoz, Permanent Representative \r\nof Chile, for his outstanding work as Chair of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and for his tireless efforts to \r\nimprove the operation of the Commission and to inform \r\nthe public and his potential partners of his mission. \r\n As a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, the \r\nKingdom of Morocco naturally associates itself with \r\nthe statement delivered this morning by the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Jamaica on behalf of the Movement. \r\n The annual report of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission (A/64/341), which is now before us, \r\nallows us to assess the scope of the Commission’s \r\nwork and its progress in carrying out its mandate. It \r\nalso allows us to take stock of the difficulties \r\nencountered by the Commission as it fulfils the tasks \r\nassigned to it. No one can deny that, as the cornerstone \r\nof the intergovernmental architecture of the United \r\nNations, the Commission has made it possible to \r\naddress the needs and priorities of countries emerging \r\nfrom conflict, to lay the foundations for the economic \r\nrecovery of post-conflict countries, and to socially and \r\neconomically reintegrate and rehabilitate former \r\ncombatants. \r\n We commend the Commission’s country-specific \r\nconfigurations for Burundi, Sierra Leone, the Central \r\nAfrican Republic and Guinea-Bissau. Despite the \r\nchallenges and obstacles they have encountered, those \r\nconfigurations have proven that they are able to help \r\nthose countries to undertake a number of reforms in the \r\nareas of good governance, justice and the rule of law. \r\n As a member of the Peacebuilding Commission’s \r\nOrganizational Committee, my delegation can attest to \r\nthe many advances made by the Commission — in \r\nparticular with regard to partnerships with other United \r\nNations bodies, such as the General Assembly, \r\nthe Security Council and the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil — with the aim of improving the coherence of \r\nits strategies and improving its operations. For its part, \r\nthe Working Group on Lessons Learned continues to \r\nserve as an informal mechanism to allow the \r\nCommission to gather the views of competent \r\nstakeholders from within and outside the United \r\nNations system, including national specialists, with \r\nexperience in post-conflict peacebuilding. \r\n Despite the fact that it was established not long \r\nago, the Commission has demonstrated the added value \r\nit brings to stabilizing post-conflict situations. Its \r\ncontribution could be more effective and robust if it \r\nwere to take the following points into consideration. \r\n First, the partnership established between the \r\nCommission’s Chair and the main organs of the United \r\nNations should be expanded to include a larger number \r\nof Commission members, including the countries of the \r\nvarious country-specific configurations. Such an \r\napproach would make it possible to involve more \r\ncountries in the partnership and create more visibility \r\nwhile improving interaction. \r\n A/64/PV.50\r\n \r\n17 09-61775 \r\n \r\n Secondly, in the same vein, my country believes \r\nthat the Commission should update its rules, \r\nprocedures and working methods with a view to \r\nimproving the effectiveness, coherence and \r\ntransparency of its work. \r\n Thirdly and lastly, with regard to the country-\r\nspecific configurations, great attention must be paid to \r\neducation, training, infrastructure development, private \r\nsector reform and the promotion of investment. \r\n Given its valuable contribution to the efforts \r\nmade in the context of the country-specific \r\nconfiguration, the Peacebuilding Fund deserves our \r\nongoing support. The Fund should endeavour to ensure \r\ngreater transparency and flexibility in its operations. In \r\nthat regard, the role played by the Peacebuilding \r\nSupport Office in revising the Fund’s mandate and \r\nacting as the conduit for information about the Fund’s \r\nactivities deserves to be highlighted, appreciated and \r\nsupported. \r\n The Peacebuilding Commission is a manifestation \r\nof the international community’s desire to stabilize and \r\nbring peace to countries emerging from conflict. The \r\nsuccess of its missions transcends the borders of the \r\nStates concerned and has an impact on all neighbouring \r\ncountries. It is up not only to the members of the \r\nCommission but to the entire international community \r\nto support the Commission as it carries out the noble \r\ntasks for which it was established. \r\n For our part, on the basis of the ongoing \r\ncommitment of His Majesty the King to South-South \r\ncooperation, my country remains ready to share its \r\nmodest peacebuilding experience with African \r\ncountries on the Commission’s agenda, just as we have \r\ndone with regard to peacekeeping.  \r\n Mr. Cancela (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): First \r\nof all, allow me to thank the President for convening \r\nthis truly important debate to receive the report \r\n(A/64/341) of the Peacebuilding Commission (PBC) on \r\nits third session as we prepare to begin the process of \r\nreviewing that body. Secondly, I congratulate our \r\ncolleague Ambassador Heraldo Muñoz, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Chile, for his excellent work as Chair \r\nof the Commission. I also welcome Ms. Judy Cheng-\r\nHopkins, who recently became the head of the very \r\nactive Peacebuilding Support Office. \r\n The report illustrates several relevant aspects of \r\nthe work of the Peacebuilding Commission and \r\nexamples of the success and tangible results of \r\npeacebuilding in several countries, several of which we \r\nhave heard about today. Were it not for the action of \r\nthe PBC, such progress would certainly not have been \r\nachieved. Beyond individual cases, we also believe it \r\nimportant to highlight that the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission has progressively provided another added \r\nvalue — the increasing awareness among Member \r\nStates of the crucial importance of peacebuilding tasks \r\nto the maintenance of international peace and security \r\nand to the promotion of sustainable development, two \r\ncore objectives of our Organization.  \r\n It is true that peacebuilding did not begin with the \r\nPBC. We are aware that this young body of the United \r\nNations is one of many multilateral, regional and \r\nindividual players, and not even the most influential in \r\nthis area. However, the PBC has certain salient \r\ncharacteristics. It is probably the only intergovernmental \r\nforum that brings North and South together to discuss \r\npeacebuilding and reconstruction, that integrates \r\npolitical aspects with those of security and development, \r\nthat is so intensely involved in specific countries and, \r\nabove all, that enjoys unparalleled legitimacy. These \r\nfeatures give the Peacebuilding Commission a \r\nprivileged position in addressing one of the most \r\negregious deficiencies of the system as a whole — the \r\nlack of coordination and coherence in peacebuilding \r\nactions worldwide.  \r\n We are therefore convinced that the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission is a fundamental tool for \r\nimproving this situation. We hope that, during the \r\nreview process in 2010, Member States will seize the \r\nopportunity to create greater space for the PBC to \r\nimprove coordination both inside and outside the \r\nOrganization. \r\n But such coordination should begin at home. In \r\nthat regard, while we highlight the progress that has \r\nbeen made, such as the creation of single national \r\nstrategies and integrated peacebuilding missions, we \r\nunderstand that there is still much room for \r\nimprovement, as for example with regard to the \r\nrelationship between the PBC and the Peacebuilding \r\nFund, and as is clearly revealed by the need to \r\nstrengthen links between peacekeeping and \r\npeacebuilding. \r\n Accordingly, the role of peacekeeping personnel \r\nas actors in early peacebuilding is essential and \r\npractically irreplaceable, given the Organization’s \r\nA/64/PV.50  \r\n \r\n09-61775 18 \r\n \r\ncapacities on the ground and the difficult \r\ncircumstances in which they work. The support that \r\npeacekeeping personnel can offer in such key areas as \r\nproviding security and strengthening the rule of law — \r\nincluding in disarmament, demobilization and \r\nreintegration, security sector reform, extending State \r\nauthority and rapid-impact projects, inter alia — \r\nshould be better exploited. There are more than \r\n100,000 women and men deployed in 16 missions who \r\ncan make a decisive contribution, especially to the \r\nstabilization of a country and in the first phases after \r\nstability returns. \r\n With respect to the upcoming review process, my \r\ndelegation believes it important to highlight two key \r\naspects, bearing in mind that the objective is to use that \r\nopportunity to strengthen the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission. The Commission must be made a more \r\neffective tool and its legitimacy enhanced. \r\n When it comes to greater effectiveness, beyond \r\nwhat I have said about improving coordination and \r\nconsistency, it would be useful to review its \r\ninvolvement with countries where peacebuilding \r\nefforts are made. The benefits of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission’s work should be extended to more \r\ncountries and regions, certainly not by replicating the \r\nmodels of current configurations but perhaps through \r\nactivities in specific work areas. \r\n The second aspect is related to the legitimacy of \r\nthe PBC, which is linked to a concept of great \r\nimportance to our day-to-day work — that of \r\nownership. We have already noted that, given the \r\nCommission’s very nature, no other body devoted to \r\nthis issue enjoys greater legitimacy. But we should ask \r\nourselves frankly how we are doing internally. The \r\nPBC Organizational Committee and the members of \r\nthe configurations are the most representative sampling \r\nof the whole that it was possible to obtain at the time. \r\nThey personify the collective political will of the \r\nOrganization in this field. However, we believe that we \r\nshould all do more to effectively extend to all Member \r\nStates the sense of ownership of peacebuilding efforts.  \r\n We therefore feel that it would be very positive to \r\nextend the basis of support for the United Nations \r\npeacebuilding efforts. In this regard, the Commission \r\nshould actively encourage the participation of other \r\ncountries in these efforts, for example, through \r\ntriangular and South-South cooperation, which would \r\nhave a very positive impact in terms of renewing \r\ncommitment to and increasing the real legitimacy of \r\nthe PBC. The reference to this topic in the current \r\nreport of the Peacebuilding Commission, and the stress \r\nplaced in the Secretary-General’s report (A/63/881) on \r\nthe need for the United Nations to make better use of \r\nthe capacities of the southern hemisphere, are \r\nencouraging precedents. \r\n Finally, we reiterate our commitment to working \r\nconstructively in the upcoming review process to \r\nstrengthen the Peacebuilding Commission so that it can \r\ncontinue to contribute to the stabilization, institutional \r\nstrengthening and economic and social development of \r\nsocieties affected by conflict. \r\n Mr. Towpik (Poland): Poland fully aligns itself \r\nwith the statement delivered earlier today by the \r\nrepresentative of Sweden on behalf of the European \r\nUnion. I shall therefore limit myself only to a few \r\npoints. \r\n Poland remains a strong supporter of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission (PBC). Since its \r\nestablishment in 2005, the PBC has made important \r\ncontributions to post-conflict peacebuilding in \r\ncountries on its agenda. It has provided input to the \r\ndevelopment of new partnerships and more holistic \r\napproaches that integrate peace processes and the \r\ndevelopment agenda. \r\n The Commission has already proven its added \r\nvalue as a platform for policy coordination with respect \r\nto international support for post-conflict countries. It \r\nhas also become a framework for mutual accountability \r\non the part of host Governments and the international \r\ncommunity. Its periodic reviews of the implementation \r\nof integrated peacebuilding strategies provide excellent \r\nopportunities to assess progress, identify obstacles and \r\ngaps, and decide on urgent actions to be taken. \r\n Poland attaches great importance to the principle \r\nof national ownership and the involvement in \r\npeacebuilding processes not only of international \r\nstakeholders and Governments, but also of various \r\ngroups from civil society and non-governmental \r\norganizations. There is also scope for a greater role for \r\nregional and subregional organizations.  \r\n Peacebuilding is not limited to peacekeeping and \r\npolitical peace processes. It also includes development \r\nactivities and establishing the economic foundations \r\nfor countries on the Commission’s agenda. \r\n A/64/PV.50\r\n \r\n19 09-61775 \r\n \r\n I would like to pay tribute to Ambassador \r\nHeraldo Muñoz of Chile, Chair of the Commission, as \r\nwell as to the Chairs of the Commission’s country-\r\nspecific configurations, including you, Sir. We highly \r\nappreciate your chairmanship. We also recognize the \r\nimportant role of the Working Group on Lessons \r\nLearned. The invaluable personal involvement of all \r\nthose persons sets the pace for the PBC’s cooperation \r\nwith the countries on its agenda. They have contributed \r\nto the further development of both the practice and \r\nconcept of peacebuilding. I would like to thank them \r\nfor their outstanding service and devotion. \r\n Poland looks forward to the 2010 review, which \r\nwill be another strategic opportunity to reflect on and \r\nfurther improve the work of the PBC. One of the areas \r\nthat can be enhanced is the so-called instrument of \r\nengagement of the PBC with the countries concerned. \r\nThe development of such an instrument should not put \r\nan additional burden on the Governments of the \r\ncountries on the Commission’s agenda. It could be \r\nbased to a greater extent on existing national strategies \r\nand programmes and might be limited to only some \r\nareas of peacebuilding that require international \r\nsupport. It could also make use of existing local \r\ncivilian capacity. \r\n We also think that sharing experiences and \r\nbuilding on previous activities is important. In that \r\nregard, it would be useful to keep records of the \r\nprojects implemented with financing from the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund in order to make continued use of \r\nthe capacities built at the country level. \r\n Another issue involves providing adequate \r\nsupport to the Chairs of the various configurations of \r\nthe PBC, in New York and in the field. There should be \r\nsufficient institutional memory to enable the \r\ncontinuation of the work of country-specific meetings \r\nin case of a change in chairmanship or membership. \r\n Before I conclude, I would like to take this \r\nopportunity to welcome Assistant Secretary-General \r\nJudy Cheng-Hopkins as head of the Peacebuilding \r\nSupport Office. I wish her success in her work. \r\n Mr. Scott (United States of America): The United \r\nStates welcomes the report of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission on its third session (A/64/341) and \r\ncommends the Commission for its work over the \r\ncourse of the past year. We thank Ambassador Muñoz \r\nfor his dedicated chairmanship, and would also like to \r\nexpress our appreciation for the committed efforts of \r\nthe Chairs of the country-specific configurations. \r\n The United States appreciates the Commission’s \r\ngrowing track record. We particularly note the \r\nCommission’s achievements in instituting more \r\nflexible methods of work, mobilizing resources from \r\ntraditional and non-traditional donors to support \r\nnational peacebuilding priorities and strategies, and \r\nfacilitating coordination among all stakeholders in \r\norder to have a concrete impact. \r\n As the report describes, the Commission has in \r\nthat way contributed to the lives of ordinary citizens of \r\nthe countries on its agenda. In Burundi, the \r\nCommission has added its voice to regional institutions \r\nand others in helping Burundi create the conditions for \r\nthe resumption of the political process. In Sierra \r\nLeone, the Commission has helped to broaden the \r\ndonor base. In Guinea-Bissau, the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission has supported the organization of \r\nlegislative elections and helped to secure crucial \r\nfunding. In the Central African Republic, the \r\nCommission has supported the national dialogue and is \r\nhelping to bring coherence and coordination to \r\ndisarmament, demobilization and reintegration efforts. \r\n As those accomplishments show, the Commission \r\nis capable of bringing together all stakeholders to \r\nsupport countries emerging from conflict and to \r\nprevent fragmentation of effort. It can provide a unique \r\nforum for mobilizing our best collective efforts, \r\nhelping us to stay focused on essential priorities and \r\nsending messages about the need for action. \r\n As we look ahead to the Commission’s future, we \r\nbelieve that we need to set our sights high to see the \r\nCommission react quickly and flexibly, to add value to \r\ncountries on its agenda without adding burdens, to \r\nprioritize and to innovate, and to push all of us to raise \r\nthe bar in our common efforts. We know the \r\nimportance of the agenda: helping Governments restart \r\ncritical services, generating jobs and reviving \r\neconomies, restoring the rule of law, reforming the \r\nsecurity sector, tackling crime and transborder causes \r\nof instability, and putting an end to sexual and gender-\r\nbased violence. Whether in the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission or elsewhere, those issues are among the \r\nhighest on our agenda at the United Nations, and we \r\nsee a pressing need to strengthen ways of working \r\ntogether to address them successfully. \r\nA/64/PV.50  \r\n \r\n09-61775 20 \r\n \r\n We look forward to the launch of the five-year \r\nreview. Like others, we believe the first step is \r\ninformation-gathering, informal discussion and \r\nconsensus-building about the scope and core elements \r\nof the review. The United States is committed to a \r\nserious process. The review should be ambitious, \r\nevidence-based and open-minded. It should also keep \r\nforemost in mind the views and experiences of post-\r\nconflict countries, both on and off the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission’s agenda.  \r\n The Commission was created because of gaps in \r\nthe international response that left too many countries \r\nvulnerable to the relapse of violence. The \r\nPeacebuilding Commission has already helped to \r\nshrink those gaps, but many remain. The review can \r\nhelp us in closing them if we stay focused on the \r\nimperative of helping post-conflict countries establish \r\nthe foundations for peace and long-term development. \r\n Mr. Midekssa (Ethiopia): My delegation would \r\nlike to thank Ambassador Heraldo Muñoz of Chile, \r\nChairperson of the Peacebuilding Commission (PBC), \r\nfor presenting the third annual report of the \r\nCommission, as contained in document A/64/341, and \r\nalso wishes to express its appreciation to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his report (A/64/217) on the \r\noperations of the Peacebuilding Fund (PBF). My \r\ndelegation aligns itself with the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of Jamaica on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement. \r\n My delegation welcomes the efforts of the PBC \r\nas it continues to implement its core mandates by \r\nadapting to the existing global conditions and by \r\ndeveloping mechanisms that are vital to the priorities \r\nof peacebuilding. Ethiopia’s involvement with United \r\nNations peacekeeping and peacemaking since 1948 \r\nunderpins our commitment to peacebuilding. \r\n The report notes that the Commission has \r\naccomplished significant tasks over the past year in its \r\nefforts to rebuild nations emerging from conflict. My \r\ndelegation believes that the international community’s \r\nrecognition that the fragility of States in the aftermath \r\nof a crisis signifies a development challenge and a \r\npotential risk to global stability is a measure of \r\nprogress that should be strengthened. As the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission was established in the hope \r\nof bringing peace to people destabilized by conflicts, \r\nwe are convinced that the PBC remains true to the \r\ninternational community that created it to deal with \r\nchallenges to peace, security and development in a \r\npractical and effective way. \r\n Through the PBC, the international community is \r\nexpected to provide the necessary assistance to all \r\ncountries emerging from crisis by building partnerships \r\nwith other stakeholders. The shared conviction that the \r\nPBC should work in partnership with other \r\ninternational actors and promote the ownership of the \r\ncountries concerned should be given serious emphasis. \r\nThe concerned parties need to participate in the process \r\nto make that endeavour successful. \r\n My delegation is convinced that the PBC’s \r\nOrganizational Committee will continue to include new \r\ncountries on its agenda. As the major conflicts in \r\nAfrica account for over 60 per cent of the items on the \r\nSecurity Council’s agenda, the focus of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission’s activities is on Africa. \r\nThe PBC should work hand in hand with the African \r\nUnion and give serious consideration to the prevailing \r\nconditions on the continent. The number of African \r\nnations benefiting from the Peacebuilding Fund is \r\nincreasing and their performance reflects the \r\nCommission’s achievements. \r\n Even though the PBC has made some progress, \r\nchallenges are still unfolding. The increasing number \r\nof conflicts in Africa calls for more engagement on the \r\npart of the international community substantively to \r\naddress the early recovery of fragile States, which are \r\nat greater risk of relapsing into violence and could pose \r\nreal threats to regional and international stability. In \r\nthat regard, it is important to stress that, unless the \r\ninternational community is determined to bring lasting \r\npeace to our subregion, the situation will deteriorate in \r\nthe future. \r\n As a body, the PBC is, of course, in its early \r\nyears and is expected to draw lessons from past \r\nactivities and benefit from the experience of the \r\nMembers of the United Nations. The Commission \r\nshould coordinate with other United Nations bodies so \r\nas to increase its effectiveness. The PBC’s strategic \r\nwork in country-specific cases administered by \r\ncountry-specific configurations and the working \r\nmethods employed in the integrated strategies need to \r\nbe streamlined with the country teams. In order to \r\nrespond to the needs of the different countries on its \r\npeacebuilding agenda, the PBC has to address the \r\ncurrent managerial and operational challenges. \r\n A/64/PV.50\r\n \r\n21 09-61775 \r\n \r\n The PBC’s readiness to improve its work assures \r\nus that it will vigorously strengthen its peacebuilding \r\nactivities. The mandate review in the coming year will \r\nseek to improve various approaches to integrated \r\npeacebuilding strategies in terms of objective and \r\nscope, strengthening and diversifying the approach to \r\nresource mobilization, and calibrating responses to \r\nemerging situations in the field, all of which are \r\nimportant factors that need serious consideration. We \r\nbelieve that the PBF will continue to be of great \r\nimportance in launching relevant peacebuilding \r\nprogrammes. The key role of the Fund as a channel for \r\nthe effectiveness of the PBC’s operations in recent \r\nyears should not be overlooked. \r\n We all acknowledge that peace is more precious \r\nthan anything. Hence, the approach that we took in \r\nbuilding peace through cooperation is a noble \r\nfoundation. The PBC embodies our common goal of \r\nbuilding the conditions for a peaceful life for those \r\nwho are in crisis. \r\n Mr. Hardeep Singh Puri (India): We welcome the \r\njoint debate on today’s agenda items, all of which have \r\nan underlying substantive connection. The work of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission (PBC) over the past three \r\nyears has sought to draw on the synergies of the three \r\nprincipal organs of the United Nations — the General \r\nAssembly, the Security Council and the Economic and \r\nSocial Council — in handling post-conflict situations. \r\n Let me begin by placing on record our \r\nappreciation for the good work done by Ambassador \r\nHeraldo Muñoz, who brings to the Commission his rich \r\nexperience in dealing with complex issues at the \r\nUnited Nations. We will gladly continue to cooperate \r\nwith him in his efforts. I would also like to \r\ncongratulate the new Chairs of the country-specific \r\nconfigurations, as well as the Chair of the Working \r\nGroup on Lessons Learned, for their work. \r\nFurthermore, I would like to extend congratulations to \r\nMs. Judy Cheng-Hopkins on her appointment as head \r\nof the Peacebuilding Support Office. My delegation \r\nlooks forward to working with all of them in a spirit of \r\nconstructive and positive cooperation. \r\n India is a member of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission and has contributed to the Peacebuilding \r\nFund. We will continue our active association both \r\nwith the Commission and with the Fund with a view to \r\nenabling those institutions to fulfil in their entirety the \r\ntasks assigned to them by the General Assembly and \r\nthe Security Council. We have always held the view \r\nthat the setting up of the PBC filled an important \r\ninstitutional gap and that the Commission can and \r\nshould make an important contribution to the recovery, \r\nreconstruction and development of countries emerging \r\nfrom conflict whenever it agrees to act upon a request \r\nfor advice and assistance from any such Member State. \r\n India has unique experience of nation-building in \r\na large, complex and very diverse setting as we strive \r\nto give our people a better life. That has allowed us to \r\ndevelop multifaceted capacities relevant to \r\npeacebuilding and development. We have shared that \r\nexperience and expertise with a number of countries \r\ntransiting from conflict to peace. We are very happy to \r\ncontinue to make our capabilities in nation-building \r\navailable to countries in post-conflict situations and to \r\ncooperate with the United Nations in its peacebuilding \r\nactivities, including with regard to development, social \r\nsector reform, the rule of law and security. \r\n We welcome the three reports under \r\nconsideration, in particular the new one on \r\npeacebuilding in the aftermath of conflict (A/63/881). \r\nThe report of the Secretary-General on peacebuilding \r\nin the immediate aftermath of conflict has as its central \r\ntheme the imperative of national ownership and rightly \r\nnotes that peacebuilding efforts must be anchored at \r\nthe country level. We are hopeful that a sincere effort \r\nwill follow during the implementation phase, so that \r\nthe advisory function of the Peacebuilding Commission \r\ncan be thoroughly exploited for the benefit of the \r\ncountries and regions concerned and for the cause of \r\ninternational peace and security in general. \r\n India co-sponsored General Assembly resolution \r\n63/282 on the Peacebuilding Fund last spring. This \r\nreflects our determination to ensure that the Fund is so \r\nstructured as to enable it to serve as a flexible, \r\nresponsive and focused recourse for peacebuilding \r\nsupport. In this context, we are happy to note that the \r\nSecretary-General’s report on the Peacebuilding Fund \r\n(A/64/217) observes that the revised terms of \r\nreference, which essentially transformed the Fund’s \r\nthree-window architecture into two facilities, namely \r\nthe Immediate Response Facility and the Peacebuilding \r\nand Recovery Facility, has enabled the Fund “to serve \r\nas a fast-disbursing, agile, responsive and risk-taking \r\npeacebuilding instrument” (A/64/217, para. 55). \r\nEqually heartening is the fact that these improvements \r\nhave been effected as a result, among other things, of \r\nintrospection within the Commission on its working. \r\nA/64/PV.50  \r\n \r\n09-61775 22 \r\n \r\n We are also happy to note that the Commission is \r\ntaking a comprehensive approach to handling its tasks. \r\nQuite notable is the fact that it is trying to cooperate \r\nand coordinate with other United Nations agencies, as \r\nwell as with other international institutions such as the \r\nWorld Bank. Equally praiseworthy are the efforts to \r\nexpand the web of stakeholders as well as their \r\ninvolvement in the process of peacebuilding. \r\n At the same time, I would be remiss if I did not \r\nstress two very important imperatives. First, we must \r\nalways strive to ensure that there is effective two-way \r\ndialogue between countries on the PBC agenda and the \r\nCommission itself during all stages. This dialogue \r\nshould help bring the requisite assistance at the \r\nappropriate time and should be flexible enough to \r\nallow for mid-course corrections where necessary. This \r\ndialogue will also ensure that relevant information is \r\nconstantly relayed and absorbed within the \r\npeacebuilding architecture for the best results. \r\n Secondly, we need to constantly improve the \r\ngovernance structures of the peacebuilding \r\narchitecture. In our view, such improvements must \r\nseek to ensure that all available resources that are \r\ngeared towards peacebuilding in post-conflict \r\nsituations are properly harnessed in the shortest \r\npossible time. This, we believe, is the sine qua non of \r\npeacebuilding. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to reiterate India’s \r\ncommitment to the peacebuilding architecture. India \r\nwill continue to be constructively engaged in the \r\nprocess of perfecting this architecture to the benefit of \r\nthe countries concerned. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): We \r\nhave heard the last speaker in the debate on these \r\nitems. \r\n The Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of items 10 and 108. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 118 (continued) \r\n \r\nRevitalization of the work of the General Assembly \r\n \r\n Mr. Sial (Pakistan): I would like to congratulate \r\nMr. Jorge Argüello, Permanent Representative of \r\nArgentina, and Ms. Sanja Štiglic, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Slovenia, for their appointment as \r\nco-facilitators of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly. We assure them \r\nof our full cooperation and support. \r\n A first step on how best we can carry forward the \r\nprocess of revitalization of the General Assembly \r\nduring the current session would be to deal with the \r\nissue of the implementation of General Assembly \r\nresolutions, to see how far we have reached in this \r\nregard and to discuss why we could not achieve more. \r\nA thorough evaluation of the status of implementation \r\nof the General Assembly resolutions and identification \r\nof underlying causes for their lack of implementation \r\nshould, therefore, be the main focus of the \r\ndeliberations of the Ad Hoc Working Group during the \r\nsixty-fourth session. Towards this end, an efficient \r\nfollow-up mechanism could be useful. This could \r\nconsist of a special unit in the Office of the President \r\nof the General Assembly. \r\n It must also be borne in mind that rationalization \r\nof the General Assembly’s agenda is essentially a \r\npolitical exercise. Therefore, the Assembly’s agenda \r\nmust remain open to the insertion of new issues in \r\nconsultation with Member States interested in certain \r\nitems, and any criteria utilized to guide these decisions \r\nwill have to apply equitably to all. In this regard, we \r\nwould like to emphasize that the notion of the sunset \r\nclause should be very carefully examined. We should \r\nexamine ways and means to assess the extent to which \r\nthe mandates approved by the intergovernmental \r\nbodies have been implemented and what should be \r\ndone for their better implementation. We would not \r\nwish to see an exercise in the application of sunset \r\nclauses to United Nations mandates without prior \r\napproval of the Member States. Any such attempt \r\nwould certainly undermine the intergovernmental \r\nmandates and cannot be accepted. \r\n We should also be mindful of our commitment to \r\nfurther enhance the General Assembly’s role in the \r\nselection and appointment of the Secretary-General in \r\naccordance with Article 97 of the Charter. Our \r\ndiscussions in this regard should be aimed at achieving \r\na consensus rather than an open-ended process of \r\ndeliberations. \r\n It would be fitting that the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup also focus on further strengthening the Office of \r\nthe President of the General Assembly so as to enable \r\nthe President to more effectively play a leadership role \r\nand take initiatives and decisions. Some of these \r\nencouraging trends include the holding of informal and \r\nformal meetings and thematic debates to discuss issues \r\nof critical importance to the international community. \r\nSteps in the right direction would include requesting \r\n A/64/PV.50\r\n \r\n23 09-61775 \r\n \r\nbriefings by the Secretariat on issues pertaining to the \r\nmandates of the General Assembly, including on \r\nmatters of peace and security, and convening press \r\nconferences to highlight particular issues discussed by \r\nor decisions adopted by the Assembly. As with any \r\nother institution, the Office of the President could \r\nfunction more effectively and efficiently if it were \r\nprovided adequate human and financial resources to \r\ncarry out its responsibilities. In every other area the \r\nOrganization’s budget has grown, whereas the budget \r\nof the President’s Office has remained unchanged since \r\n1998. Given the complexity and diversity of the issues \r\nand the time-consuming negotiations, which \r\nnecessitate stronger secretariat support and a larger \r\nquantum of resources, the Office of the President of the \r\nAssembly should have dedicated resources, for \r\nexample for conference servicing, in order to enable \r\nthe Office to organize informal discussions and debates \r\non issues of urgent importance without being bogged \r\ndown by procedures. \r\n We fully support the strengthening of the Office \r\nof the President of the General Assembly. In this \r\ncontext, we believe that the Assembly President should \r\nhave the flexibility to deploy human and financial \r\nresources as he deems appropriate for the session. \r\nMoreover, there is a need for better transitional \r\narrangements for the President, perhaps by using a \r\ntroika consisting of the past and future General \r\nAssembly Presidents. \r\n We must sustain the progress achieved during the \r\nsixty-third session with the adoption of resolution \r\n63/309 on this important agenda item. We expect that, \r\nthrough constructive dialogue and engagement, we will \r\nbe able to build on all previous resolutions on this \r\nmatter and identify further ways to enhance the role, \r\nauthority, effectiveness and efficiency of the General \r\nAssembly. The delegation of Pakistan extends its full \r\ncooperation and support to the co-facilitators in \r\nachieving a successful outcome of our deliberations on \r\nthis agenda item. \r\n Mr. Morejón (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nEcuadorian delegation associates itself with the \r\nstatements of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Rio \r\nGroup (see A/64/PV.48) and wishes to make the \r\nfollowing additional comments. \r\n We cannot discuss reform of the United Nations \r\nwithout a true revitalization of the General Assembly. \r\nAnd that does not consist just of ratifying its role as the \r\nmain deliberative and representative body of the \r\nUnited Nations when it comes to adopting policies; it \r\nalso requires the political will to make its actions \r\nincreasingly effective and democratic. \r\n For Ecuador, it is essential that implementation of \r\nresolutions be an integral part of our discussions on \r\nrevitalization so that the General Assembly will regain \r\nits central role in the Organization, as well as the \r\npublic visibility that should distinguish it. Issues that \r\nbelong to the Assembly should not for any reason be \r\ntransferred to the purview of the Security Council. In \r\nthat context, the simple logic of action is to proceed in \r\naccordance with the principles in the United Nations \r\nCharter, bearing especially in mind that the only body \r\nin charge of establishing the norms is the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n In that order of things, it is important to define \r\nthe Assembly’s role and responsibility in the process of \r\nselecting the Secretary-General. Based on existing \r\nresolutions and the provisions of the Charter, the \r\nAssembly should have an active presence in the \r\nselection of the Secretary-General. Times change and \r\nthe General Assembly should go along with those \r\nchanges, which enable it to act in accordance with the \r\nnew dynamics of international relations. That being the \r\ncase, and considering its strengthened powers, it is \r\nimportant that the Assembly take on a direct role in the \r\nhandling of issues related to international peace and \r\nsecurity. \r\n We are pleased to note that the General Assembly \r\nwas able to act quickly and efficiently on topics of vital \r\ninterest to the international community, such as the \r\nresolution in which it condemned the coup d’état in \r\nHonduras (resolution 63/301) and the conference on \r\nthe financial and economic crisis. That is one of the \r\ndynamics that the Assembly should maintain. Ecuador \r\nis firmly committed to that task. We firmly believe that \r\nrevitalization is on the right track, as demonstrated by \r\nthe results achieved by resolution 63/309, which the \r\nAssembly adopted by consensus thanks to the political \r\nwill shown by all Member States. \r\n I would like to use this opportunity to thank all \r\ndelegations and the President for the recognition of the \r\nwork of Ecuador and Norway. We offer our support and \r\ncongratulations to the Permanent Representatives of \r\nArgentina and Slovenia for their appointment as \r\nco-facilitators of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the \r\nRevitalization of the General Assembly. It is also \r\nA/64/PV.50  \r\n \r\n09-61775 24 \r\n \r\nimportant to highlight that analysis of the working \r\nmethods should not focus only on the Assembly but \r\nalso on each of its committees, especially those which \r\nhave not made the expected progress on the \r\nOrganization’s priority topics. \r\n Finally, my delegation reiterates its will to \r\nactively and constructively participate in this essential \r\nprocess, as it already has in coordinating the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group. The most important thing is for \r\nMember States to express their commitment and \r\npolitical will. \r\n Mr. Escalona Ojeda (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): My delegation aligns \r\nitself with the statements made by the Algerian \r\nrepresentative on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement \r\nand the Mexican representative on behalf of the Rio \r\nGroup (see A/64/PV.48). \r\n We meet in this historic Hall to discuss one of the \r\nmost important topics on the agenda of this \r\nOrganization: the revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly. If that reform, the cornerstone of a process \r\nof genuine reform of the United Nations, does not take \r\nplace, the democratization of this forum, called for \r\ntoday by the peoples of the world, will not become a \r\nreality. \r\n During the previous session this topic received an \r\nimportant boost. The effective work of the facilitators \r\nof the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization of \r\nthe General Assembly — Ambassador Maria Fernanda \r\nEspinosa, Permanent Representative of the Republic of \r\nEcuador, and Ambassador Morten Wetland, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Norway — encouraged the debate, \r\nwhich addressed substantive issues that should serve as \r\na reference for this new session. We appreciate the \r\nwork carried out by both representatives and their \r\nteams. We wish success to the new facilitators in \r\ncarrying out their functions: Ambassador Jorge \r\nArgüello, Permanent Representative of Argentina, and \r\nAmbassador Sanja Štiglic, Permanent Representative \r\nof Slovenia. \r\n The revitalization of the General Assembly is a \r\ncentral aspect of the process of changes and \r\ntransformations that must take place within the United \r\nNations. Today, the Organization does not meet the \r\ndemocratization expectations of the peoples of the \r\nworld. The changes to the international system in \r\nrecent years are expressed in a new political \r\nconfiguration. Inevitably a unipolar world will fall \r\napart. New national and social actors that nourish the \r\nconfiguration of a multipolar world have arisen. The \r\nstruggles of the peoples of the South are being \r\nrevitalized. Unilateralism and imperial pretensions of \r\nimposing a single model of democracy on the world are \r\nbeing questioned. Peace movements are gaining new \r\nstrength. Those new realities must be reflected in the \r\ncomposition of the principal organs of the United \r\nNations. \r\n The political configuration resulting from the \r\nSecond World War is maintained in this Organization. \r\nIn that framework we are witnessing the progressive \r\nstripping of the functions of the General Assembly in \r\nissues of international peace and security, and many of \r\nits functions are absorbed by the Security Council. \r\nThat undemocratic trend must be reversed. \r\n The people are calling for the democratization of \r\nthe United Nations. Thus a revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly that democratizes decision-making in this \r\nforum is a paradigmatic issue. In that sense, all \r\ncountries should be able to genuinely influence the \r\ncourse of world affairs, and thus revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly has become a fundamental challenge \r\nin democratizing international relations. \r\n Through the adoption of resolution 63/309 in \r\nSeptember, Member States pledged to seek new ways \r\nto enhance the role, authority, effectiveness and \r\nefficiency of the General Assembly. \r\n My delegation highlights the value of resolution \r\n11 (I) of 24 January 1946 at this time. It sets out the \r\nprocedures for selecting the Secretary-General and \r\nemphasizes the responsibility of the General Assembly \r\non that important issue. Some proposals on the \r\nselection of the Secretary-General were considered \r\nduring the previous session, including the possibility of \r\namending the resolution. We suggest that those \r\nproposals be considered by the Ad Hoc Working Group \r\nduring the current session. \r\n Venezuela believes that the Security Council \r\nmonopoly on selecting the Secretary-General is \r\nundemocratic. Selection should be the responsibility of \r\nall Member States making up the General Assembly. \r\nThe selection process should be inclusive and \r\ntransparent and have the full involvement of this body. \r\n My country reiterates the need for the Secretary- \r\nGeneral to act in accordance with the terms established \r\nin the Charter of the United Nations and in the rules of \r\n A/64/PV.50\r\n \r\n25 09-61775 \r\n \r\nprocedure of the General Assembly and on the basis of \r\nrequests from Member States. Going beyond those \r\nparameters reduces the credibility and legitimacy of his \r\nfunctions and, ultimately, of the Organization itself. \r\n The revitalization of the General Assembly is not \r\nonly a procedural issue. Some delegations try to focus \r\ndiscussions on improving working methods and on \r\nissues such as the modernization of the voting process. \r\nThe importance of those issues should not be \r\noverlooked. But a true revitalization process should \r\ninclude questions of substance that require appropriate \r\nand timely responses and, by their nature, call for \r\nconcerted actions that are discussed in a universal, \r\ntransparent and inclusive manner. \r\n The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela questions \r\nthe intention to move to the Security Council issues \r\nthat should be addressed by the General Assembly, or \r\nany initiative seeking to diminish the role of the \r\nAssembly, which by its nature is more inclusive and \r\nrepresentative. The Charter is very clear on that point, \r\nand under no circumstances does it give the Security \r\nCouncil the authority to address issues that fall within \r\nthe competence of the Assembly. \r\n Strengthening the role of the General Assembly \r\nrequires the full exercise of its powers in the field of \r\npeace and security, as provided in the provisions in \r\nArticles 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 of the Charter. Those \r\nissues should not be exclusively under the authority of \r\nthe Security Council. \r\n Venezuela believes that the Assembly must \r\ncontinue to be the Organization’s principal forum for \r\ndiscussion, maintaining its independence from other \r\nbodies. The tendency of the Security Council to become \r\ninvolved in matters outside its jurisdiction must be \r\nreversed, as it weakens the Assembly’s central role. \r\n The negotiations to revitalize the Assembly are \r\nonly beginning. Venezuela is committed to that end. \r\nThe Assembly can depend on our support in boosting \r\nthe debate which we will soon resume on the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Solón-Romero (Plurinational State of \r\nBolivia) (spoke in Spanish): I would like to begin by \r\nthanking the President for convening this meeting on a \r\ntopic of great importance. \r\n The Plurinational State of Bolivia aligns itself \r\nwith the statement by the delegation of Algeria on \r\nbehalf of the Non-Aligned Movement (see A/64/PV.48). \r\n Revitalization of the General Assembly is \r\nfundamental to strengthening its role as the main \r\nrepresentative, deliberative and normative organ of the \r\nUnited Nations system. It is essential to re-establish the \r\nbalance among the principal organs of the United \r\nNations, ensuring that their mandates are respected and \r\nthat they confine themselves to what is set out in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. \r\n If we carefully read Article 24 of the Charter, we \r\nwill see that it does not give the Security Council the \r\ncompetence to consider topics that fall within the \r\npurview of the General Assembly and the Economic \r\nand Social Council. In order to re-establish the balance \r\nof powers in the United Nations system, it is essential \r\nthat the Security Council confine itself to the functions \r\nassigned to it. My delegation firmly believes that \r\nre-establishing the balance among the principal organs \r\nof the Organization will ensure that the mandates given \r\nwill be fully respected and legitimized. \r\n To revitalize the General Assembly, the \r\nimplementation of its resolutions must be strengthened \r\nthrough closer monitoring, promotion and assessment. \r\nFor that, it is necessary to strengthen the Assembly \r\npresidency and provide it with greater means, and to \r\npromote periodic evaluation processes and \r\ntransmission of institutional memory, seeking to deal \r\nwith the new, emerging problems and not confining \r\nourselves to repeating already agreed positions. \r\n The role of the Assembly needs to be more \r\nvisible in the media and in our own countries through \r\nactions that highlight its role as a main representative, \r\ndeliberative and normative body of the United Nations. \r\n When it comes to the election of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, we wish to state that the 1946 resolution \r\n(resolution 11 (I)) has to be modified. That resolution \r\nin actuality affected the Assembly’s mandate to elect \r\nthe Secretary-General. In the opinion of the \r\nPlurinational State of Bolivia, the Assembly should \r\nelect from a list of two or three candidates, and \r\nbuilding a consensus around the Secretary-General to \r\nbe elected should take place here, in the Assembly, \r\nwhere 192 Member States participate, and not in a \r\nbody where there are only 15 States, five of which are \r\npermanent members with the right to veto. The \r\nAssembly has, in fact, lost its power to name the \r\nSecretary-General. For a true revitalization to happen, \r\nit must recover that mandate. \r\nA/64/PV.50  \r\n \r\n09-61775 26 \r\n \r\n What my country expects of this process is not \r\njust changes in the Assembly’s procedures to make it \r\nfunction in a more dynamic, effective manner. What we \r\nreally wish for are changes in the very concept of what \r\nthe role of the General Assembly should be, in the \r\nselection of topics, in the conduct of negotiations and \r\nin the election of its President — all that in order to \r\nstrengthen this body and give its resolutions the \r\npolitical and moral authority that legitimizes its \r\nactions. \r\n We have undoubtedly made progress in the \r\nprocess with some specific tasks. We all wish to \r\nimprove the voting system, but we have to carefully \r\nreflect on establishing digital voting systems that \r\nimperil the integrity and confidentiality of voting. \r\nThere is a series of other simple measures, such as cell \r\nphone access to the Journal or specific events on the \r\nagenda, which could be very easily implemented. \r\n Mr. Aguiar Patriota (Brazil): First and foremost, \r\nI wish to thank the former Permanent Representative of \r\nEcuador, Ambassador Maria Fernanda Espinosa, and \r\nthe Permanent Representative of Norway, Ambassador \r\nMorten Wetland, for their work as Co-Chairs of the Ad \r\nHoc Working Group on the Revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly during its sixty-third session. I also \r\nseize this opportunity to warmly welcome Ambassador \r\nJorge Argüello, the Permanent Representative of \r\nArgentina, and Ambassador Sanja Štiglic, the \r\nPermanent Representative of Slovenia, as the incoming \r\nCo-Chairs of the Working Group, and I pledge my \r\ndelegation’s full support for their endeavours. \r\n The General Assembly is the most representative \r\ndecision-making body of the United Nations. Its \r\nlegitimacy is drawn from the universal nature of the \r\nmembership, operating under a democratic statute, \r\nwherein all Member States are treated as equals and \r\ninteract with each other as such. Ensuring the vitality, \r\nefficacy and significance of the work of the Assembly \r\nis therefore tantamount to protecting multilateralism in \r\nits purest form and highest expression. Strengthening \r\nthe role and authority of the Assembly should always \r\nbe at the heart of any process of reform of the \r\nmultilateral system. \r\n The General Assembly has several roles. It \r\ncoordinates, oversees and instructs multiple bodies of \r\nthe United Nations system subordinate to it. It is also a \r\npolitical forum for the consideration of all issues on the \r\ninternational agenda falling within its purview. Efforts \r\naimed at revitalizing the Assembly should support the \r\nfull breadth of its role and responsibilities. The \r\nrelationship among the principal organs of the United \r\nNations should be mutually reinforcing. For the \r\noptimum functioning of the system, the main bodies \r\nmust fulfil their respective duties and exercise their \r\npowers in the manner provided for by the Charter. \r\n However, there are issues to be addressed. While \r\nthe Security Council’s agenda shows a distinct \r\ntendency to expand in new directions over time, we are \r\nwitnessing a General Assembly overburdened by a \r\nproliferation of resolutions and agenda items, not all of \r\nthem necessarily contributing to raising the standards \r\nof performance and relevance of the main body of the \r\nUnited Nations. The same could be said of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council, which is seen by many \r\nas falling short of its original mandate. Of course, \r\ncertain complaints about the so-called encroachment of \r\nthe Security Council on the work of the Assembly \r\ncould be mitigated if the Council were made more \r\nrepresentative, transparent and accountable to a \r\nbroader membership, including of the permanent kind. \r\n The role of the Assembly as an interface between \r\nMember States and the United Nations Secretariat \r\nshould also be reinforced, so that the policies and \r\npriorities set by Members are better reflected and \r\naccounted for from within the United Nations \r\nmachinery. More frequent and direct dialogue between \r\nthe Assembly and internal system-wide coordination \r\nmechanisms, such as the Chief Executives Board, \r\nwould be an important step in that direction. \r\n The renewed process of selecting and appointing \r\nthe Secretary-General deserves our full support and \r\ncontinued attention. In addition, we would welcome \r\ncloser consideration of the procedures for selecting, \r\nappointing and confirming the heads of the major \r\nspecialized agencies, funds and programmes with a \r\nview to ensuring transparency, legitimacy and a \r\nbalanced representation. \r\n We must also consider strengthening the role of \r\nthe President of the General Assembly as part of our \r\nefforts towards revitalization. Initiatives taken by the \r\nPresident often allow the United Nations to respond \r\nbetter to particular needs and situations, such as the \r\nworld financial and economic crisis. Brazil was an \r\nenthusiastic supporter of a stronger role for the United \r\nNations in the debate about the crisis. Only in the \r\nGeneral Assembly can countries without a voice in the \r\nexisting financial governance structures put forward \r\ntheir views. It is often the case that special conferences \r\n A/64/PV.50\r\n \r\n27 09-61775 \r\n \r\nconvened under the auspices of the Assembly require \r\ncomplex follow-up actions for which the President and \r\nhis office are insufficiently equipped. That is a matter \r\nrelevant to the revitalization of the Assembly, and we \r\nwould support giving it further consideration. \r\n Mr. Cabral (Guinea-Bissau) (spoke in French): \r\nAt this late hour, I will try to be as brief as possible.  \r\n On behalf of my delegation, I would like to say \r\nthat the revitalization of the General Assembly is not a \r\nslogan. First and foremost, it is the recognition that \r\nthere are problems, there are difficulties, and that we \r\nneed to make changes. That requires a great deal of \r\nattention, but it requires above all that we examine \r\nourselves. \r\n It has often been said that the General Assembly \r\nhas lost the role assigned to it by the terms of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. But who is responsible \r\nfor that? That is the real question we need to ask \r\nourselves here.  \r\n If we take a look at the Charter, we see that \r\nArticle 7 establishes the principal organs of the United \r\nNations system. There are six of them. There is, first, \r\nthe General Assembly, and then the Security Council, \r\nthe Economic and Social Council and the Trusteeship \r\nCouncil. Then you have the International Court of \r\nJustice and the Secretariat. \r\n How is it that since the creation of the United \r\nNations we have seen, voluntarily or sometimes against \r\nour will, this lessening of the importance of the \r\nGeneral Assembly? We need to ask ourselves that \r\nquestion. And that self-examination that I mentioned \r\nearlier requires that we should be willing to practice a \r\nkind of self-criticism.  \r\n The General Assembly is very often reproached \r\nfor having become a sort of automatic system where \r\nresolutions are voted on year after year, where \r\nMembers ask the Secretariat to furnish report after \r\nreport. It is often said, and rightly so, that we do not \r\neven take the care to examine the results and \r\nconclusions contained in those reports. And, \r\nautomatically, at the end of every resolution, we ask \r\nthe Secretary-General to present a report. Those are the \r\ncriticisms directed at the Assembly — redundancy, \r\nduplication and the superficial nature of the resolutions \r\nthat are adopted here. \r\n Well, if we want to breathe new life into the \r\nGeneral Assembly, let us do so, and if we need to make \r\na decision, let us display the will and determination, \r\nbecause things change. We must change our attitude. \r\nWe must ensure that the role that is given to the \r\nAssembly is completely fulfilled.  \r\n We often hear criticisms here; we often hear \r\ncertain distinguished colleagues say that the Assembly \r\nis a victim of encroachment by the Security Council. \r\nWhy is that? It was the Assembly, under Article 24 of \r\nthe Charter, that conferred on the Council the \r\nprerogative of handling security questions and \r\ninternational peace. But that same Article 24 also says \r\nthat the Security Council must account to the General \r\nAssembly. Are we demanding enough? Are we \r\nadequately assuming our responsibilities when we \r\ndiscuss issues of international peace and security? \r\nNowhere in the Charter of the United Nations does it \r\nsay that the Security Council has the exclusive right to \r\ndeal with issues of international peace and security. On \r\nthe contrary, when we look at Article 10, it clearly says \r\nthat the General Assembly, this Assembly — which, it \r\nhas been correctly stated, is the plenary Assembly — is \r\nwhere power needs to be exercised. \r\n Article 10 says that the General Assembly may \r\ndiscuss any questions related to international peace and \r\nsecurity except, of course, for issues that fall under \r\nArticle 12, but do we really do that? Change is good, \r\nbut in order to change properly we need to be ready to \r\ntake appropriate measures. There should be fewer \r\ndocuments here, fewer resolutions. We need to be seen \r\nas a serious body. There is work that needs to be done, \r\nand we can get a new image and breathe new life into \r\nthe General Assembly, provided we decide to do so. \r\n As regards documentation, for example, I would \r\nsay that we produce too many documents, some of \r\nwhich at least are fairly useless. We live in an era of \r\ninformation technology, and each delegation is able to \r\nuse the Internet, the United Nations website, for \r\nexample, to find and to examine a document. I think \r\nthat we could make an effort in that area. If we were to \r\ndo so, we could decrease expenditures. \r\n Now, we have been told that we need to shore up \r\nthe role of the President of the General Assembly. My \r\ndelegation agrees. We agree that an appropriate budget \r\nneeds to be earmarked for that, but I think, as regards \r\nthe choice of the President of the General Assembly, \r\nwe could also ask the regional groups that have the \r\ntask and responsibility of proposing the name of a \r\nperson for that job to propose several names, since \r\nwhat we want to do is establish a degree of pluralism \r\nA/64/PV.50  \r\n \r\n09-61775 28 \r\n \r\nhere. These ideas relating to the choice of the President \r\nof the General Assembly need to be linked in with the \r\nchoice of the Secretary-General. We should not ask the \r\nSecurity Council to propose several names for us, if we \r\nourselves in the General Assembly do not do that. \r\nOthers have said, and my delegation agrees, that that is \r\nnot a correct reading of resolution 11 (I) of 1946 \r\nregarding the mechanism for appointing the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations. \r\n I would just like to remind the Assembly that, \r\naccording to the Charter, in particular Article 97, which \r\nsays that the Secretary-General is appointed — not \r\nelected — by the General Assembly upon the \r\nrecommendation of the Security Council. I would like \r\nus to think about the shade of difference between \r\nappointment and election. I have heard colleagues here \r\nsay that we need to ask the Security Council to request \r\nthat the General Assembly propose several names to the \r\nCouncil. I think it should be the opposite. I think we \r\nshould ask the Security Council to recommend several \r\nnames, but we basically cannot, in the humble opinion \r\nof my delegation, present names to the Security \r\nCouncil, given what Article 97 of the Charter says. That \r\nArticle states that “The Secretary-General shall be \r\nappointed by the General Assembly upon the \r\nrecommendation of the Security Council”. So, in my \r\ndelegation’s opinion, the General Assembly should not \r\nbe presenting names to the Security Council, but rather \r\nthe opposite. We would like the Security Council to \r\npresent various names to us, bearing specifically \r\nresolution 11 (I) of 1946 in mind. We should look to see \r\nwhat is written there, because the Assembly wanted to \r\nfacilitate the process when it asked the Security Council \r\nat that time, in 1946, to submit only one name rather \r\nthan several names. So we really need to decide what \r\nare the best mechanisms for achieving our purposes. \r\n I would now like to say that we need to reach \r\nagreement on recognizing the fact that the functioning \r\nof the General Assembly does not meet the needs of the \r\ntwenty-first century. We have talked about voting \r\nmethods here, and it is true that sometimes we feel that \r\nwe are using a rather archaic voting system. We should \r\nnot be scared of technology. I am frankly convinced \r\nthat if the Secretariat decides that it will propose to us \r\na computerized system — once it has been checked, of \r\ncourse, to make sure that all security checks are in \r\nplace — that would be good. I have to say that in many \r\nMember States of the United Nations, people vote \r\nusing computerized systems, and I think that we could \r\nuse such a system as well. \r\n In conclusion, on behalf of my delegation, I \r\nwould like to say that I thank my colleagues from \r\nEcuador and Norway for the excellent work that they \r\nhave carried out, and before them, their predecessors \r\ndid exactly the same thing. I very much hope that our \r\ntwo colleagues from Argentina and Slovenia will be \r\nable to do the same. We are available to assist them in \r\nevery possible way. Having heard many delegations \r\nhere take the floor, I hope that everybody will do the \r\nsame in order to ensure that we can breathe greater life \r\ninto the General Assembly and deserve the confidence \r\nof the people who send us here to speak and act on \r\ntheir behalf. \r\n I think it might be useful to remind delegates here \r\nthat rather than working or acting in a spirit of \r\nconfrontation with the Security Council, we need to \r\nfind what the possibilities are for complementarity, so \r\nthat we can work together, basing our work on the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. The roles and \r\nresponsibilities are clearly defined there. I think that \r\ncollectively we can shoulder the responsibilities that \r\nare ours. \r\n Mr. Bodini (San Marino): I would like to extend \r\nmy gratitude to the President for convening this \r\nmeeting today to discuss the revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. I would also like to thank the \r\nprevious Co-Chairs, the Ambassador of Ecuador and \r\nthe Ambassador of Norway, for their excellent work. \r\n Allow me to welcome the Ambassador of \r\nSlovenia and the Ambassador of Argentina, with whom \r\nI will be delighted to work together closely. Like many \r\nsmall States, San Marino is committed to having a \r\nvibrant and efficient General Assembly, and therefore, \r\neach year, we look forward to participating in the \r\nGeneral Assembly revitalization process. \r\n We are delighted that during the sixty-third \r\nsession of the General Assembly we were able to have \r\nso many thematic debates, including those on the world \r\nfinancial crisis and the food crisis. We believe that over \r\ntime, these debates will make the General Assembly \r\neven more relevant and will reinforce and re-establish \r\nthe General Assembly’s role in global governance. \r\n San Marino strongly believes in the fundamental \r\nrole of the President of the General Assembly and \r\nwelcomes any improvements that could be made to the \r\nselection process for the President of the General \r\nAssembly and any enhancements that might assist the \r\nPresident in carrying out his duties. \r\n A/64/PV.50\r\n \r\n29 09-61775 \r\n \r\n We are grateful to Security Council members for \r\ntheir increased openness to the members of the General \r\nAssembly and we believe strongly that an equitable \r\nreform of the Security Council will enhance the role of \r\nthe General Assembly as well. Moreover, we are \r\nconvinced that the General Assembly should work even \r\nmore closely with the Secretariat to enhance the \r\nefficiency and transparency of the work of the entire \r\nUnited Nations, including special projects such as the \r\none we are undertaking right now, the Capital Master \r\nPlan. I believe that under the leadership of President \r\nTreki much will be accomplished, and I look forward \r\nto working with Ambassadors Štiglic and Argüello on \r\nrevitalizing our General Assembly even further. \r\n Mrs. Gallardo Hernández (El Salvador) (spoke \r\nin Spanish): My delegation associates itself with the \r\nstatement of Mexico on behalf of the Rio Group. \r\n The revitalization of the General Assembly is \r\nvery important to El Salvador, as part of advancing the \r\ndemocratization of the United Nations as a whole. This \r\nis also an important basis for our future deliberations. \r\nWe are especially pleased with the appointment of the \r\nAmbassadors of Slovenia and Argentina as Co-Chairs \r\nof the Ad Hoc Working Group on the revitalization of \r\nthe General Assembly, and we express our full support \r\nfor them. \r\n El Salvador supports the Assembly’s timely action \r\non political issues of enormous interest for the \r\ninternational community, such as the resolutions \r\nadopted on issues such as the situations in Honduras \r\nand the Middle East, among others. Allow me to point \r\nout, however, that despite progress in this area, my \r\ndelegation considers it imperative that the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group on the revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly continue its discussions of substantive issues. \r\n These include the role and responsibility of the \r\nGeneral Assembly in the selection process for the \r\nSecretary-General. Indeed, a transparent, inclusive \r\nprocess should be established in which the Assembly \r\nplays a more important part, in accordance with the \r\nCharter of the Organization. \r\n Concerning the application of resolutions relating \r\nto the revitalization of the Assembly, we believe it \r\nappropriate to keep an updated chart of the \r\nimplementation of resolutions, which would make it \r\npossible to rationalize the work of the Assembly and \r\nalso to rely on the support of delegations that have \r\nproposed specific topics. \r\n With regard to strengthening the General \r\nAssembly and the Office of the President of the \r\nAssembly, we should add that the more the Assembly \r\nis revitalized and fully realizing its deliberative, \r\nnormative and policy-defining role, the more we will \r\nalso be strengthening multilateralism. It is also \r\nimportant that other United Nations bodies’ functions \r\nnot overlap those of the General Assembly. However, it \r\nis appropriate to promote better interaction and \r\ncoordination with the presidencies of other organs. \r\n My delegation believes it is important to increase \r\nthe public visibility of the General Assembly’s \r\nactivities, by using the web page on substantive areas \r\nof its agenda in all the official languages of the \r\nOrganization. We also support the development of \r\nthematic debates, since these respond to issues of \r\ninterest to the international community and that are a \r\nfocus of concern and interest for the Organization as a \r\nwhole. We also support an expansion of human and \r\nfinancial resources for the Office of the President. \r\n Regarding the voting system, it is imperative that \r\nwe modernize the system itself so that it is transparent, \r\nmaking it possible to guarantee the credibility, \r\nreliability and confidentiality of the voting process. It \r\nis also worth reconsidering the procedures for voting \r\non candidatures, in order to make the process speedier \r\nand more effective. \r\n On the question of documentation, I would like to \r\npoint out once more the importance of getting \r\ndocumentation in time to review the necessary and \r\nspecific points before the discussions take place and, \r\nespecially, in all six official languages of the \r\nOrganization. \r\n In conclusion, I reiterate my country’s full \r\nsupport for continuing to work actively during the \r\ncurrent session on this issue, seeking a precise focus \r\nconducive to the genuine strengthening of this world \r\nforum, which all our countries need. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): We have \r\nheard the last speaker in the debate on this item. One \r\nrepresentative has requested permission to exercise the \r\nright of reply. May I remind members that statements \r\nmade in the exercise of the right of reply are limited to \r\n10 minutes for the first intervention and 5 minutes for \r\nthe second, and should be made by delegations from \r\ntheir seats. I now give the floor to the representative of \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo. \r\nA/64/PV.50  \r\n \r\n09-61775 30 \r\n \r\n Mr. Ileka (Democratic Republic of the Congo) \r\n(spoke in French): Permit me, Sir, to take this \r\nopportunity to reiterate the congratulations of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo on Belgium’s \r\nelection to the presidency of the European Council. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n I am taking the floor in my capacity as Chair of \r\nthe Southern African Development Community \r\n(SADC) and in response to the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of Madagascar on 19 November \r\nconcerning agenda item 118, “Revitalization of the \r\nwork of the General Assembly”. We have noted with \r\nconcern the content of the statement in which the \r\nrepresentative of Madagascar referred to an action by \r\nSADC during the general debate segment of the sixty-\r\nfourth session of the Assembly that prevented the \r\nleader of the High Transitional Authority of \r\nMadagascar from participating in the debate. We would \r\nlike to offer the following points in response. \r\n Madagascar has been suspended from SADC and \r\nthe African Union (AU) since March of this year, \r\nowing to an unconstitutional change of Government in \r\nthat country, following which the international \r\ncommunity, led by SADC, the AU and the United \r\nNations, among others, undertook a mediation process \r\nto restore constitutional governance. \r\n In August, the main parties to the dispute agreed \r\non a settlement and the establishment of a transitional \r\nGovernment representative of all parties to the dispute. \r\nHowever, the leader of the High Transitional Authority \r\ndefied that agreement and appointed his own \r\nGovernment. This was the basis for the action SADC \r\ntook during the general debate. It was not interference \r\nin the domestic affairs of a Member State of the United \r\nNations, as the representative of Madagascar stated, \r\nbut should rather be seen as part of the broader \r\nmediation efforts in that country aimed at ensuring \r\nMadagascar’s return as a full member of the regional \r\norganizations to which it belongs. \r\n With regard to the process in the United Nations, \r\nthe Assembly should note that the members of SADC \r\nrequested an urgent meeting of the Credentials \r\nCommittee to review the credentials of the \r\nunconstitutional representative of Madagascar and his \r\ndelegation. However, the Committee was unable to \r\nmeet, and the President of the General Assembly ruled \r\nthat he would allow the representative of Madagascar \r\nto speak in spite of the objections raised by SADC. \r\nBased on that decision, SADC utilized rule 71 of the \r\nRules of Procedure of the General Assembly to \r\nchallenge the decision of the President of the General \r\nAssembly. That rule states that: \r\n  “A representative may rise to a point of \r\norder, and the point of order shall be immediately \r\ndecided by the President in accordance with the \r\nrules of procedure. A representative may appeal \r\nagainst the ruling of the President. The appeal \r\nshall be immediately put to the vote, and the \r\nPresident’s ruling shall stand unless overruled by \r\na majority of the members present and voting.” \r\n I repeat: “present and voting”. I emphasize that \r\nthe action undertaken by SADC was not aimed at \r\nundermining the person, office or stature of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly as claimed by the \r\nrepresentative of Madagascar in his statement. \r\n I should like to assure the President of the General \r\nAssembly that it was a difficult decision for SADC, and \r\none which we took reluctantly. However, that action \r\nwas necessary in order to save the outcome of the \r\nmediation process, and it was based on firm principles. \r\n Under this agenda item, we are discussing the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly. Many \r\ndelegations pointed out that the General Assembly is \r\nthe representative legislative body of the world. Many \r\nalso stated that it is essential for the General Assembly \r\nto become more responsive to matters of international \r\npeace and security. SADC has identified democratic, \r\nstable and constitutional governance as a priority for \r\nensuring regional and international peace and security. \r\nIt has worked tirelessly over the past years to achieve \r\nthat, as the many elections in the region attest. There \r\nhave been problems and difficulties, but it is our aim to \r\naddress these through mediation and dialogue. It is \r\nessential for the General Assembly to do the same. \r\n Finally, SADC has continued its mediation efforts \r\nin Madagascar and, as representatives of the region, we \r\nhave noted with interest the recent developments in \r\nthat process. We reiterate that it is important for \r\nMadagascar to continue implementing the agreements \r\nreached in order to ensure the return to constitutional \r\ngovernance in that country. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 118. \r\n The meeting rose at 6.35 p.m. \r\n"
