(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 3:15 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 16 (continued) \r\n \r\nQuestion of Palestine \r\n \r\n  Report of the Committee on the Exercise  \r\nof the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian \r\nPeople (A/64/35) \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/64/351) \r\n \r\n  Draft resolutions (A/64/L.20, A/64/L.21, \r\nA/64/L.22 and A/64/L.23) \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I would like to \r\nmake a brief statement as President of the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n We meet today to consider the question of \r\nPalestine, which remains the oldest unresolved issue \r\nbefore the General Assembly. We have before us the \r\nreport of the Committee on the Exercise of the \r\nInalienable Rights of the Palestinian People (A/64/35) \r\nand the Secretary-General’s report on the peaceful \r\nsettlement of the question of Palestine (A/64/351). \r\n This morning we observed the International Day \r\nof Solidarity with the Palestinian People, an occasion \r\nfor renewing our commitment to the realization of the \r\ninalienable rights of the Palestinian people — primarily \r\nthe right to self-determination and the right to an \r\nindependent State — and for reaffirming our support to \r\na comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle \r\nEast. The fact that after all these years the question of \r\nPalestine still awaits a peaceful settlement weighs \r\nheavily on the United Nations. This day should also \r\nremind us that the human cost of the Middle East \r\nconflict is borne by the Palestinian people. Their \r\nsuffering will continue until the question of Palestine is \r\nresolved and the right of the Palestinian people to their \r\nhomeland is realized. \r\n The Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip has forced \r\n1.5 million Palestinian civilians into poverty and \r\nisolation. The Israeli military offensive almost a year \r\nago further exacerbated the already desperate situation. \r\nInternational efforts to rebuild the Gaza Strip and to \r\nassist its civilian population are blocked by Israel. The \r\nUnited Nations has repeatedly called on Israel to lift \r\nthe blockade, but Israel continues to impose collective \r\npunishment on the civilian population of Gaza, in clear \r\nviolation of international law. Israel must heed the call \r\nof the international community to release its \r\nstranglehold on civilian life in the Gaza Strip and to lift \r\nthe illegal blockade. \r\n Earlier this month, the General Assembly \r\nendorsed the report of the United Nations Fact-Finding \r\nMission on the Gaza Conflict (A/HRC/12/48) and \r\ncalled on Israel and the Palestinian side to undertake \r\nindependent, credible investigations with a view to \r\nensuring accountability and justice (see resolution \r\n64/10). The Secretary-General has been requested to \r\nreport on the implementation of the resolution before \r\n2 February 2010. The General Assembly will in due \r\ncourse consider the report of the Secretary-General and \r\nany further action. \r\nA/64/PV.51  \r\n \r\n09-62352 2 \r\n \r\n The situation of the question of Palestine is at a \r\ncritical juncture where sustained focus and a \r\nreinvigoration of the peace process are needed. The \r\nrenewed engagement of President Barack Obama to \r\npromote peace in the Middle East has the support of \r\nthe international community. But, on the ground, the \r\nobstacles to peace remain in place.  \r\n The continued expansion of Israeli settlements \r\nand construction of the separation barrier on occupied \r\nPalestinian territory, notwithstanding the advisory \r\nopinion handed down by the International Court of \r\nJustice, undermine the peace process and violate \r\nUnited Nations resolutions. Continued Israeli actions to \r\nchange the status of Jerusalem further endanger the \r\nestablishment of a Palestinian State with East \r\nJerusalem as its capital. \r\n The United Nations has consistently upheld the \r\nright of the Palestinian people to self-determination \r\nand will continue to work for a peaceful settlement of \r\nthe question of Palestine on the basis of the relevant \r\nSecurity Council and General Assembly resolutions, \r\nthe Madrid terms of reference, the road map and the \r\nArab Peace Initiative. These resolutions and \r\nagreements are the building blocks of a Palestinian \r\nState and must be implemented. In order to achieve a \r\ncomprehensive peace in the region, the international \r\ncommunity must also work for a just and lasting \r\nsettlement of the conflict in the Middle East that \r\nensures the withdrawal of Israel from the Syrian Golan \r\nand the territories it occupies in Lebanon. \r\n I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Paul \r\nBadji of Senegal, who will speak in his capacity as \r\nChairman of the Committee on the Exercise of the \r\nInalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, and who \r\nwill also introduce draft resolutions A/64/L.20, \r\nA/64/L.21, A/64/L.22 and A/64/L.23. \r\n Mr. Badji (Senegal) (spoke in French): Allow \r\nme, at the outset, to express, on behalf of the \r\nCommittee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of \r\nthe Palestinian People, our sincere appreciation to all \r\nthe representatives of Member States, observers, \r\nrepresentatives of intergovernmental organizations, \r\nUnited Nations system entities and civil society who \r\nparticipated this morning in the special meeting of the \r\nCommittee to observe the International Day of \r\nSolidarity with the Palestinian People. The meeting \r\nforcefully reaffirmed the solidarity of the international \r\ncommunity and highlighted the broad support for the \r\nexercise by the Palestinian people of its inalienable \r\nrights. \r\n Before I introduce for the Assembly’s \r\nconsideration the four draft resolutions prepared by our \r\nCommittee under this agenda item, I would like to talk \r\nabout the situation in the occupied Palestinian territory \r\nand developments in the political process. Today, the \r\nsituation can only be described as bleak. It is \r\ncharacterized by a steadily worsening humanitarian \r\nsituation in the Gaza Strip exacerbated by the Israeli \r\nmilitary offensive of last December and January, a lack \r\nof progress in efforts to unite the West Bank and the \r\nGaza Strip under the Palestinian Authority and a \r\nstagnation of the political process. The continuing \r\nblockade of Gaza does not allow the long overdue \r\nreconstruction and rehabilitation, which are so \r\nnecessary. \r\n Equally disturbing are the Israeli actions in East \r\nJerusalem, in particular, land confiscations, house \r\ndemolitions, evictions of Palestinian residents and \r\nsettler violence. Elsewhere throughout the West Bank, \r\nwe have witnessed unrestrained settlement \r\nconstruction, Israeli incursions into Palestinian towns \r\nand villages and arrests of Palestinians. Violent actions \r\non the part of radical Israeli settlers against the \r\nPalestinian population are also of great concern. \r\n Let me address two of the most critical issues and \r\nremind Israel of the position of the overwhelming \r\nmajority of the international community on them, \r\nnamely the settlements and East Jerusalem. \r\n As regards the settlements, it is recognized by all, \r\nwith the exception of Israel, the occupying Power, that \r\nsettlements in the occupied West Bank and East \r\nJerusalem are illegal under international law and \r\ncontravene Israel’s obligations under the road map. All \r\nsettlement construction, including so-called natural \r\ngrowth, must be halted immediately. All outposts must \r\nbe dismantled. The settlements built on Palestinian \r\nland perpetuate conflict, lead to violence and constitute \r\na clear obstacle to ever achieving peace between \r\nIsraelis and Palestinians, as they undermine efforts at \r\nestablishing a State of Palestine that will live in peace \r\nand security with Israel. \r\n As regards East Jerusalem, the international \r\ncommunity does not recognize Israel’s unilateral \r\nclaims that the entire city of Jerusalem is the capital of \r\nIsrael. All actions taken by Israel that alter or purport \r\nto alter the status of the city are null and void and \r\n A/64/PV.51\r\n \r\n3 09-62352 \r\n \r\nillegal under international law. The status of the Holy \r\nCity is clearly and unequivocally outlined in several \r\nSecurity Council and General Assembly resolutions, \r\nand Israel must abide by them. The continuation of \r\nthose policies by the Israeli Government has prevented \r\nany tangible improvement in the situation in the \r\noccupied territories and cast serious doubts on the \r\ngenuine intention of the Israeli leaders when they \r\ndeclare their interest in the resumption of negotiations \r\nwithout preconditions. \r\n The Committee is a strong supporter of the two-\r\nState solution, by which an independent, sovereign \r\nState of Palestine would be created within the 1967 \r\nborders, with East Jerusalem as its capital, living side \r\nby side with Israel in peace and security. It considers it \r\nto be the only feasible solution whereby the Palestinian \r\npeople would be able to exercise its inalienable \r\nnational rights. That solution would also bring peace \r\nand security to the State of Israel and give a \r\nconsiderable boost to economic development and \r\ncooperation in the Middle East region. \r\n To achieve that goal, the Israeli Government must \r\nchange its policy. The continuation for decades of \r\nsettlement-expansion policies, land annexations, \r\nexploitation of Palestinian natural resources and \r\ncontrol and, in fact, stifling and collective punishment \r\nof Palestinians by erecting a separation wall on their \r\nland and establishing checkpoints and closures will not \r\nlead to peace. Those policies have entrenched the \r\nstatus quo, subjugated the Palestinian people, triggered \r\ntwo intifadas and created tension and conflict in the \r\nregion.  \r\n More than 20 years ago, Palestinian leaders \r\ndeclared their acceptance of the two-State solution in \r\naccordance with relevant United Nations resolutions. \r\nPresident Abbas has undertaken to achieve that goal \r\nthrough negotiations. Palestinian and Israeli \r\nnegotiators have met many times for that purpose and \r\nhave invariably found themselves confronted with a \r\nnew situation on the ground: new or expanded \r\nsettlements, outposts and the construction of the \r\nseparation wall with its detrimental effect on the lives \r\nof Palestinians. Furthermore, daily oppressive practices \r\nof the occupying Power continue unabated: military \r\nraids, arrests, restrictions on the movement of persons \r\nand goods, settler violence and numerous other \r\ncoercive measures. The list of illegal acts and measures \r\nby Israel is long. \r\n That was not the objective expected when the \r\ninternational community wholeheartedly worked for \r\nthe Madrid peace process that started in 1991 and then \r\nthe confidence-building measures set up by the Oslo \r\nAccords of 1993 and those that followed. That was not \r\nat all what the participants in the Annapolis Conference \r\nhad in mind when they supported the resumption of the \r\nnegotiations on permanent status. A lack of cooperation \r\non the part of the Israeli Government is contrary to the \r\nspirit and letter of the road map of the Quartet and \r\nleaves no room for implementing the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative. \r\n Our Committee has continuously supported \r\nefforts by the parties and the international community \r\nto bring about a peaceful solution to the Palestinian \r\nquestion. In view of the widening gap between the \r\ndesired objective — namely, the establishment of a \r\nPalestinian State within the borders of 1967 — and the \r\nreality on the ground, the Committee has focused its \r\nannual programme of work on the urgent achievement \r\nof the two-State solution. Serious and honest \r\nnegotiations in good faith on all permanent status \r\nissues are necessary to get the process off the ground. \r\n At the same time, actions on the ground have to \r\nchange radically. Settlement expansion has to stop. \r\nExtremists on all sides must be held accountable for \r\ntheir acts. The rule of law must prevail. The blockade \r\nof Gaza has to be lifted. Palestinian economic activity \r\nmust be relauanched through the lifting the restrictions \r\non the movement of people and goods. That would \r\ncreate a climate of trust and encourage growing support \r\non the part of Palestinian and Israeli public opinion, \r\nallowing the parties to reach decisions that at the \r\nmoment may seem very difficult or remote. \r\n The Committee’s position is that the continuing \r\nillegal occupation of the Palestinian territories remains \r\nthe root cause of the conflict. As long as that situation \r\ncontinues, we will not cease to remind Israel, the \r\noccupying Power, that it is bound by well-defined \r\nobligations enshrined in international humanitarian \r\nlaw. \r\n The international community must ensure that all \r\nof its members adhere to those principles. Impunity for \r\nserious violations must end. The General Assembly \r\nrecently held an important discussion on those issues \r\nwhen considering the Goldstone report \r\n(A/HRC/12/48). Our Committee encourages the parties \r\nand the international community to implement the \r\nA/64/PV.51  \r\n \r\n09-62352 4 \r\n \r\nrecommendations contained in that report. \r\nResponsibility and accountability must be established, \r\nand everything must be done to prevent a reoccurrence \r\nof the devastation caused by Israel during the war in \r\nGaza and the human tragedy it brought to the civilian \r\npopulation of Gaza. \r\n The best solution would be a negotiated solution \r\nthat would end the occupation, ensure the exercise by \r\nthe Palestinian people of its inalienable rights and \r\nguarantee security for the State of Israel. Such a \r\nsettlement must be based on international law, relevant \r\nUnited Nations resolutions and the principles outlined \r\nin the Road Map and the Arab Peace Initiative. \r\n On a number of occasions, the Committee has \r\nvoiced its concern about internal Palestinian divisions \r\nthat block national reconciliation and the reunification \r\nof the West Bank and Gaza under the aegis of the \r\nPalestinian Authority. The Committee supports all \r\nefforts, in particular those by Egypt, aimed at restoring \r\nPalestinian national unity, which is indispensable for a \r\npermanent settlement of the question of Palestine. \r\n The Committee firmly believes that the United \r\nNations should continue to maintain its permanent \r\nresponsibility towards the question of Palestine until it \r\nis effectively resolved in all its aspects in accordance \r\nwith international law and legitimacy. The Committee \r\ncalls on the Security Council to act decisively to ensure \r\nimplementation of its own resolutions with respect to \r\nthe question of Palestine, in particular resolutions 242 \r\n(1967) and 338 (1973). The Committee also hopes that \r\nthe Council, as the principal United Nations organ \r\nresponsible for the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security, will live up to its obligations under the \r\nCharter. For its part, the Committee will continue to \r\nfulfil the mandate entrusted to it by the General \r\nAssembly, the purpose of which is to help the \r\nPalestinian people to realize its inalienable rights. \r\n In this context, I wish to introduce to the \r\nAssembly the four draft resolutions approved by the \r\nCommittee and circulated under agenda item 16, in \r\ndocuments A/64/L.20, A/64/L.21, A/64/L.22 and \r\nA/64/L.23.  \r\n The first three draft resolutions are related to the \r\nwork of the Committee on the Exercise of the \r\nInalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, of the \r\nDivision for Palestinian Rights of the Secretariat and of \r\nthe special information programme on the question of \r\nPalestine of the Department of Public Information. \r\nThey reaffirm the important mandates entrusted to this \r\norgan of the General Assembly and to the divisions of \r\nthe Secretariat. As in the past, the Committee intends \r\nto ensure that its resources placed at its disposal are \r\nused in the most cost-effective manner for all activities \r\nrelevant to its mandate. These three draft resolutions \r\nhave been updated.  \r\n The fourth draft resolution, entitled “Peaceful \r\nsettlement of the question of Palestine”, reaffirms the \r\nposition of the General Assembly with regard to the \r\nessential elements of such a settlement and includes \r\nreferences to developments during the past year. This \r\ndraft reaffirms in particular our full support for the \r\nMiddle East peace process, based on the relevant \r\nUnited Nations resolutions, the Madrid terms of \r\nreference, including the principle of land for peace, the \r\nArab Peace Initiative, the Quartet road map and the \r\nexisting agreements between Israel and the \r\nPalestinians. \r\n The four draft resolutions I have just introduced \r\noutline positions, mandates and programmes that are of \r\nspecial importance, in particular at the crucial juncture \r\nwhere we find ourselves today. I call on Member States \r\nto vote in favour of the draft resolutions and support \r\nthe important goals contained therein. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Saviour Borg of Malta, \r\nRapporteur of the Committee on the Exercise of the \r\nInalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, to \r\nintroduce the Committee’s report. \r\n Mr. Borg (Malta): It is an honour for me, in my \r\ncapacity as Rapporteur of the Committee on the \r\nExercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian \r\nPeople, to present to the General Assembly the annual \r\nreport of the Committee, contained in document \r\nA/64/35. Indeed, the report I am presenting today is the \r\nCommittee’s thirty-third report to the Assembly.  \r\n For the past three decades the Committee has \r\nfollowed the recommendations that it made in its first \r\nreport to the Assembly, recommendations that have \r\nbeen endorsed by the Assembly in its 32 subsequent \r\nsessions, as a basis for the solution of the question of \r\nPalestine. However, as indicated in paragraph 2 of this \r\nyear’s report,  \r\n“The recommendations of the Committee \r\ncontained in its first report could not be \r\nimplemented, and the Assembly each year \r\n A/64/PV.51\r\n \r\n5 09-62352 \r\n \r\nrenewed the Committee’s mandate in pursuit of \r\nthe tasks assigned to it.”  \r\n Allow me now to summarize each section of the \r\nreport.  \r\n Chapters I through III cover the Committee’s \r\nobjectives and its general perspective on the events that \r\nhave taken place in the course of the year. They also \r\nsummarize the General Assembly mandates to the \r\nCommittee and contain information on the organization \r\nof the Committee’s work during the year. \r\n In Chapter I, the introduction to the report, a \r\nnumber of facts are highlighted. They include in \r\nparticular the Committee’s consistent support for a \r\npeaceful solution of the question of Palestine; the \r\nstagnation of the political process, lack of progress in \r\nefforts to unite the West Bank and the Gaza Strip under \r\nthe Palestinian Authority, and the worsening situation \r\non the ground throughout the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritory, including East Jerusalem; the failure of the \r\npolitical process between the Israeli and Palestinian \r\nsides, which was resumed after the Annapolis \r\nConference of November 2007, to produce any tangible \r\nresults; the response by the international community to \r\nthe assault on Gaza by calling for calm and respect for \r\nthe lives of innocent civilians; the continued efforts by \r\nthe Quartet to achieve a comprehensive resolution of \r\nthe Arab-Israeli conflict; and the Committee’s activities \r\nwhich sought to draw attention to the urgent need for \r\ncoordinated and collective efforts to mitigate the \r\nnegative developments occurring on the ground. \r\n In Chapter IV the report reviews the situation, \r\nmonitored by the Committee during the year, in the \r\noccupied Palestinian territory, including East \r\nJerusalem, as well as the relevant political situation. \r\nThis chapter contains a detailed factual account of \r\nevents that took place in the period under review, as \r\nwell as the role played by the United Nations Relief \r\nand Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near \r\nEast and the Office for the Coordination of \r\nHumanitarian Affairs in alleviating the hardships that \r\nthe populations suffer because of the situation \r\nprevailing in and around the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritory, including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. \r\n Chapter V reviews the action taken by the \r\nCommittee in accordance with Assembly resolution \r\n63/26, including action taken in the Assembly and the \r\nSecurity Council and the participation of the \r\nCommittee Chairman in the debates of these two \r\nprincipal organs of the United Nations. The chapter \r\nreviews statements issued by the Committee and its \r\nBureau and the Committee’s continued dialogue and \r\nconsultations with Governments, United Nations \r\nagencies and programmes, intergovernmental \r\norganizations, non-governmental organizations and \r\nparliamentarians. It also reports on the series of \r\ninternational meetings and conferences organized by \r\nthe Committee. The valid role and mandated activities \r\ncarried out by the Division for Palestinian Rights are \r\nappropriately reflected in the report. \r\n Chapter VI provides an overview of the work \r\ndone over the year by the Department of Public \r\nInformation (DPI) in pursuance of Assembly resolution \r\n63/28 of 26 November 2008. In particular, it outlines in \r\nsome detail the role of DPI in the implementation of its \r\nspecial information programme on the question of \r\nPalestine in order to raise the awareness of the \r\ninternational community on that question, as well as on \r\nthe situation in the Middle East, in such a way as to \r\ncontribute actively to an atmosphere conducive to \r\ndialogue and supportive of the Middle East peace \r\nprocess. \r\n The last Chapter of the report contains the \r\nCommittee’s conclusions and recommendations. The \r\nCommittee has repeatedly expressed, throughout the \r\nreporting period, its utmost concern about the ever-\r\ndeteriorating situation in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritory, including East Jerusalem, and the breakdown \r\nof the political process. It condemned the offensive by \r\nthe Israeli military in the Gaza Strip late last year and \r\nin the beginning of this year. The Committee also \r\ndenounced the firing of rockets and mortar rounds by \r\nPalestinian militants from Gaza. The Committee \r\nexpressed its deep alarm about the resultant suffocating \r\nblockade of the Gaza Strip, which continues to be \r\nimposed by Israel after the thousands of casualties \r\namong the civilian population and massive destruction \r\nof Palestinian homes, property and infrastructure \r\ncaused by the offensive.  \r\n In this regard, the Committee reminds Israel, the \r\noccupying Power, of its obligation under the Fourth \r\nGeneva Convention to protect the civilian population \r\nunder its occupation and to act within the ambit of \r\ninternational law. The Committee recommends that the \r\ninternational community consider strengthening respect \r\nof international humanitarian law by creating \r\nappropriate mechanisms to monitor adherence, and that \r\nthe High Contracting Parties take, individually or \r\nA/64/PV.51  \r\n \r\n09-62352 6 \r\n \r\ncollectively, the measures they deem appropriate to \r\nensure respect for the Convention, including the \r\nconvening of a conference of the High Contracting \r\nParties to address the subject of respect and ensuring \r\nrespect for the Convention. \r\n The Committee notes that the actions of the \r\nIsraeli Defence Forces during Operation Cast Lead in \r\nthe Gaza Strip led to serious allegations of violations \r\nof international humanitarian law and, possibly, war \r\ncrimes. The Committee commends the work of the \r\nvarious investigative missions and, at the same time, \r\nexpresses its disquiet over an almost complete denial \r\nby Israel of any violations of the rules governing the \r\nconduct of war. The Committee deplores the lack of \r\nIsraeli cooperation with some of the missions. The \r\nCommittee expresses its view that the perpetrators of \r\nserious crimes on either side should be brought to \r\njustice and held accountable for their actions, and calls \r\nfor the recommendations contained in the various \r\nreports to be implemented. \r\n The Committee also expresses its serious concern \r\nover Israel’s ongoing settlement activity and reiterates \r\nthat the presence of settlements in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, is \r\nillegal under international law. In this context, the \r\nCommittee welcomes the fact that the international \r\ncommunity has remained focused on the damaging \r\neffects of Israel’s settlement policies for the \r\nachievement of a two-State solution and calls for \r\nserious action to be taken in that regard. The \r\nCommittee also expresses its concern about the \r\naccelerated creation of faits accomplis in East \r\nJerusalem, including recent policy statements and \r\nillegal unilateral measures by the Government of \r\nIsrael. The Committee reiterates that East Jerusalem is \r\npart of the occupied Palestinian territory, and that a \r\nnegotiated solution to the question of Jerusalem, based \r\non international law, is absolutely essential to resolving \r\nthe Israeli-Palestinian conflict and crucial for a durable \r\npeace in the whole region. Moreover, the Committee \r\ndenounces the continued construction of the wall in the \r\noccupied Palestinian territory, including East \r\nJerusalem, and recommends that the international \r\ncommunity take more determined action challenging \r\nthe presence of the wall. \r\n The Committee notes that as result of those \r\ndetrimental developments and the continuing Israeli \r\noccupation, no progress has been achieved in the \r\nrealization of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian \r\npeople. The Committee reiterates its full support to the \r\ninternational consensus that the only viable solution to \r\nthe conflict and the exercise by the Palestinian people \r\nof its inalienable rights is the creation of a Palestinian \r\nState in the territory occupied by Israel in 1967, living \r\nside by side with Israel in peace and security. To that \r\nend, the Committee calls for the resumption of the \r\npermanent status negotiations between Israel and the \r\nPalestinians. The Committee also calls for invigorated \r\nefforts by all to work to reconcile their positions on the \r\nbasis of the prevailing consensus on the need to \r\nachieve a two-State solution, which would lead to the \r\nexercise by the Palestinian people of its inalienable \r\nrights. \r\n The Committee also emphasizes the useful and \r\nconstructive contribution of the Division for \r\nPalestinian Rights in support of its mandate. It \r\nexpresses the view that that the programme of \r\ninternational meetings and conferences implemented \r\nby the Division contributes to focusing the attention of \r\nGovernments, intergovernmental and civil society \r\norganizations and the public on the urgency of bringing \r\nabout the two-State solution and mobilizing assistance \r\nto the Palestinian people. The Committee intends to \r\nfurther generate wide support for a peaceful solution of \r\nthe conflict based on international law and relevant \r\nUnited Nations resolutions through its programme of \r\ninternational meetings and conferences for 2010. \r\nFurthermore, the Committee intends to reach out, with \r\nthe assistance of United Nations entities on the ground, \r\nto the people most affected by the status quo, namely, \r\nrefugees and Palestinians living under occupation, and \r\nto members of the Israeli public to involve them in the \r\nsearch for solutions, to promote dialogue and common \r\nprojects and to win their backing for a settlement \r\nnegotiated by their leaders and supported by the \r\ninternational community. The Committee wishes to \r\ncontribute to efforts aimed at ending incitement on \r\nboth sides, provide a venue to have the narratives heard \r\nand reconciled and, with the help of civil society, \r\npromote peace education on the ground. It will pay \r\nparticular attention to the empowerment of women and \r\ntheir organizations in this process. \r\n The Committee also commends civil society \r\norganizations for their support of the Palestinian people \r\nand lauds the courageous advocacy actions of \r\nnumerous activists, including parliamentarians, who \r\nhave participated in demonstrations against the wall, \r\nprovided assistance to Gaza and kept their home \r\n A/64/PV.51\r\n \r\n7 09-62352 \r\n \r\nconstituencies informed about the harsh realities of life \r\nunder occupation. The Committee will continue to \r\nassess its programme of cooperation with civil society \r\norganizations and consult them on ways to enhance \r\ntheir contribution. The Committee also commits to \r\nfurther developing its cooperation with \r\nparliamentarians and their umbrella organizations, \r\nwhich have a special responsibility to ensure that their \r\nGovernments actively promote and support the \r\nrealization of a two-State solution and ensure respect \r\nfor international law, in accordance with their \r\ninternational obligations. \r\n Lastly, the Committee expresses its view that the \r\nDepartment of Public Information’s special \r\ninformation programme on the question of Palestine \r\nhas made and continues to make an important \r\ncontribution to informing the media and public opinion \r\nof the relevant issues. In this regard, the Committee \r\nrequests the continuation of the programme with the \r\nnecessary flexibility as warranted by developments \r\nrelevant to the question of Palestine. \r\n In closing, I would like to express the hope that \r\nthe report I have just presented will be of assistance \r\nnot only to the Members of this Assembly in its \r\ndeliberations on the question of Palestine but also serve \r\nas another clarion call to all States and parties to join in \r\nthis endeavour and to expand their cooperation and \r\nsupport to the Committee. In that context the \r\nCommittee invites the General Assembly again to \r\nrecognize the importance of the Committee’s role and \r\nto reconfirm its mandate. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency Riyad Mansour, Chairman of \r\nthe observer delegation of Palestine. \r\n Mr. Mansour (Palestine) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nAllow me at the outset, Sir, to express our deep \r\nappreciation for your wise leadership and excellent \r\nstewardship of the General Assembly. At the same \r\ntime, it is my pleasure to express our gratitude and \r\nappreciation to the Committee on the Exercise of the \r\nInalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, to its \r\nChairman, His Excellency Ambassador Paul Badji, to \r\nall members of the Committee and to the members of \r\nthe Bureau. I also wish to thank the Division for \r\nPalestinian Rights and the Department of Public \r\nInformation of the United Nations Secretariat for their \r\ntireless efforts and serious work to mobilize \r\ninternational support for the Palestinian cause and for \r\nthe Palestinian people in their endeavour to realize \r\ntheir inalienable rights. I also express gratitude to the \r\nSecretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \r\nfor his efforts to serve the cause of peace. \r\n We gathered this morning in the Trusteeship \r\nCouncil Chamber to solemnly commemorate the \r\nInternational Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian \r\nPeople. Our people express their profound gratitude for \r\nthe solidarity and the support for their cause, which \r\nhave been reaffirmed on this Day from all corners of \r\nthe world. The Day is traditionally observed on \r\n29 November, the date in 1947 when the General \r\nAssembly adopted resolution 181 (II), which \r\npartitioned historic Palestine into two States — one of \r\nwhich is Palestine, which has yet to see the light of \r\nday, and the other, Israel. That resolution led to the \r\ntragedy and injustice that befell the Palestinian people, \r\nwho were uprooted from their land, dispossessed and \r\ndispersed and who suffered the loss of their homeland \r\nin 1948. The Day also reaffirms the continuing \r\ninternational commitment, including on the part of the \r\nUnited Nations, to uphold its historic responsibility \r\nwith regard to the question of Palestine until it is \r\nresolved in all its aspects, in accordance with \r\ninternational law and United Nations resolutions.  \r\n The consequences of the Nakba are known to \r\neveryone. More than half the Palestinian people, \r\ncomprised of more than three generations of families, \r\ncontinue to live in exile as refugees after their \r\ndisplacement from their homeland. They are scattered \r\nin all parts of the world, with millions still languishing \r\nin refugee camps and denied the right to return to their \r\nhomes to live in peace with their neighbours, and are \r\nsuffering innumerable hardships. The rest of the \r\nPalestinian people, including refugees, continue to live \r\nunder Israeli occupation in the Palestinian territory, \r\nincluding East Jerusalem, and are continually suffering \r\nrepression, punishment and violations of their basic \r\nrights. \r\n Israel, the occupying Power, continues to deny \r\nthe rights of the Palestinian people and to slight \r\ninternational law, including international humanitarian \r\nlaw and human rights law. At the same time, it \r\ncontinues its illegal colonial settlement by building and \r\nexpanding settlements and by constructing the \r\nseparation wall in the occupied Palestinian territory, \r\nincluding East Jerusalem, aimed at advancing its \r\nexpansionist plans by creating facts on the ground so as \r\nto alter the character, status and demographic \r\nA/64/PV.51  \r\n \r\n09-62352 8 \r\n \r\ncomposition of the occupied Palestinian territory. The \r\nIsraeli occupying forces use excessive and \r\nindiscriminate military force against Palestinian \r\ncivilians, in flagrant violation of the Fourth Geneva \r\nConvention. That has resulted in the loss of innocent \r\nlives, including children and women, and many injuries \r\nand cases of psychological trauma among the civilian \r\npopulation, as well as the destruction of property, \r\nhomes, agricultural fields and the Palestinian \r\ninfrastructure. Acts of violence, harassment, \r\nprovocation, incitement and terror against Palestinian \r\ncivilians continue to be committed by the armed \r\nextremist Israeli settlers who have been transferred \r\nillegally to the occupied Palestinian territory.  \r\n In addition, Israel, the occupying Power, \r\ncontinues to arbitrarily detain and imprison \r\napproximately 11,000 Palestinian civilians, including \r\nchildren and women. Moreover, Palestinian prisoners \r\nand detainees continue to be subjected to physical and \r\nmental ill-treatment, solitary confinement and torture. \r\nThey are denied family visits, adequate medical care \r\nand food and are held in completely unsanitary and \r\ninhumane conditions, in violation of all rules and \r\nprinciples of international humanitarian law. \r\n Since its occupation of the Palestinian territory, \r\nIsrael has persistently pursued a policy of collective \r\npunishment against the Palestinian people by imposing \r\nclosures and restrictions on the movement of persons \r\nand goods within, into and out of the occupied \r\nPalestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, which \r\nhas been completely cut off from the rest of the \r\noccupied Palestinian territory. That policy has led to \r\nobstructing Palestinian access to schools, hospitals, \r\nfarms and work and holy places and to preventing the \r\narrival of food supplies and humanitarian aid. That \r\npolicy is reflected in its ugliest forms through the \r\ncomplete blockade of the Gaza Strip and the creation \r\nof more than 550 checkpoints and roadblocks in the \r\nWest Bank, in addition to the settlements, the \r\nseparation wall, bypass roads, the permit regime and, \r\nin particular, the residency restrictions imposed on the \r\nPalestinian inhabitants of Jerusalem. \r\n At the same time, Israel continues to defy the \r\nconsensus of the international community, which \r\ndemands the cessation of Israel’s illegal settlement \r\nactivities. Israel is continuing its colonization \r\ncampaign in the occupied Palestinian territory, \r\nincluding East Jerusalem, in grave breach of the Fourth \r\nGeneva Convention and its Additional Protocol I, in \r\nviolation of United Nations resolutions and in complete \r\ndisregard for the 9 July 2004 Advisory Opinion of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, showing deliberate \r\ndisrespect for the commitments made in the peace \r\nprocess.  \r\n The city of East Jerusalem is subjected to a \r\nfeverish campaign through the continued expansion of \r\nsettlements and the transfer of settlers, the destruction \r\nand seizure of Palestinian homes, the displacement of \r\nits inhabitants, severe residence restrictions and the \r\nserious excavations beneath and around Al-Aqsa \r\nMosque that threaten its foundations. All those illegal \r\nIsraeli measures and actions are clearly aimed at \r\nchanging the character, status and demographic \r\ncomposition of the city. \r\n The immoral Israeli practices forcibly displacing \r\nPalestinians and replacing them with unlawful settlers \r\nare illegal and must be seriously condemned and \r\nseriously and immediately addressed by the \r\ninternational community. Such actions constitute war \r\ncrimes under article 8 of the Rome Statute of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court, a violation of article 49 \r\nof the Fourth Geneva Convention, and grave breaches \r\nof international humanitarian law under article 147 of \r\nthe Convention. They are also in violation of numerous \r\nUnited Nations resolutions, including Security Council \r\nresolutions 476 (1980) and 478 (1980). \r\n The ongoing building of additional colonial \r\nsettlement units in the occupied Palestinian territory by \r\nthe Israeli Government, including in East Jerusalem, \r\nare stark evidence of Israel’s continued policy of \r\nseizure and confiscation of Palestinian land and reflect \r\nthe absolute arrogance of power and disdain for the \r\ninternational will and consensus in that regard and for \r\nthe resolutions of international legitimacy that affirm \r\nthat occupied East Jerusalem is an integral part of the \r\noccupied Palestinian territory and that all Israeli \r\nsettlement and annexation activities in the city are null \r\nand void and have no legal validity. \r\n Allowing Israel to continue its campaign of \r\nillegal colonial settlement seriously jeopardizes the \r\nchances of achieving peace in the future. That \r\ncampaign undermines not only the contiguity, \r\nintegration and unity of the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritory but also the efforts seeking to achieve a two-\r\nState solution. \r\n The brutal military aggression launched by Israel \r\non 27 December 2008 against the defenceless \r\n A/64/PV.51\r\n \r\n9 09-62352 \r\n \r\nPalestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip viciously killed \r\nmore than 1,400 people, including hundreds of \r\ninnocent children and women, and left more than 5,500 \r\ninjured. Undoubtedly, that was a disgraceful \r\nillustration of Israel’s complete disregard for human \r\nrights and for the sanctity of human life. At the same \r\ntime, Israel has continued its illegal and unjust \r\nblockade of the Gaza Strip in collective punishment of \r\nthe entire Palestinian population of Gaza. That \r\nblockade has turned the Gaza Strip into a large prison \r\nand exacerbated the humanitarian crisis, causing \r\nmassive poverty, hunger, disease and unemployment. \r\n Regrettably, the selectivity and inaction of the \r\ninternational community, including the Security \r\nCouncil, has allowed Israel, the occupying Power, to \r\ncontinue its shameful violations of international law \r\nand international humanitarian law and human rights \r\nlaw against the Palestinian civilian population in the \r\noccupied Palestinian territory, including East \r\nJerusalem. Undoubtedly, the international community’s \r\nfailure to hold Israel accountable for its violations and \r\nwar crimes has reinforced Israel’s impunity and \r\nlawlessness, allowing it to continue to use military \r\nforce and collective punishment against the defenceless \r\nPalestinian people under its occupation. \r\n The investigation carried out by the United \r\nNations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict \r\nclearly confirmed that Israel, the occupying Power, had \r\ncommitted serious human rights violations and grave \r\nbreaches of international humanitarian law, including \r\nthe Fourth Geneva Convention, amounting to war \r\ncrimes and even crimes against humanity against the \r\nPalestinian people. It also concluded that the absence \r\nof accountability and, worse still, in many instances the \r\nlack of any expectation thereof is what allowed Israel, \r\nto a large extent, to continue its violations and to \r\npersist in the culture of impunity that it has enjoyed for \r\nmore than four decades. That has not only gravely \r\ndeepened the injustice and suffering endured by the \r\nPalestinian people, but has also undermined the \r\ncredibility of international law and of the international \r\norder as a whole. \r\n In that regard, resolution 64/10, adopted by the \r\nGeneral Assembly on 5 November 2009, is an \r\nimportant step in the direction of beginning the process \r\ntowards ensuring accountability and justice. In addition \r\nto efforts made to address that serious issue in the \r\nGeneral Assembly, we will continue to call on all \r\nrelevant United Nations bodies, including the Security \r\nCouncil, to shoulder their responsibility and on the \r\nHigh Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva \r\nConvention to accept their individual and collective \r\nlegal obligations and responsibilities in order to \r\nembark on a new era for our people and for the entire \r\nworld, based on respect for international law — the \r\ntrue guarantor of peace, freedom, security and human \r\ndignity. \r\n The international community, in particular the \r\nSecurity Council, must shoulder its responsibility by \r\nsending a clear and strong message to the occupying \r\nPower that the international community will no longer \r\ntolerate its illegal practices, violations and crimes, \r\nbecause the duty to abide by the principles of \r\ninternational law should be above all other \r\nconsiderations that may make a mockery of our \r\ninternational system. Such principled commitment to \r\nthe law will help us to break that vicious cycle of \r\nimpunity and to bring an end to the crimes that have \r\ncaused so much suffering and have prolonged that \r\ntragic conflict, as well as to ensure the protection of the \r\nPalestinian civilian population. There is no doubt that \r\nthat would bring an end to the human suffering caused \r\nby the Israeli occupation of our people, create an \r\nappropriate and more stable environment for achieving \r\npeace and a two-State solution and put an end to the \r\nPalestinian-Israeli conflict and the Arab-Israeli conflict \r\nas a whole.  \r\n There will be no peace, security or stability in the \r\nMiddle East as long as the question of Palestine \r\nremains unresolved. That cannot be achieved while \r\nIsrael continues to defy the law and continues not to \r\nfulfil its legal obligations, remaining an absent or \r\nunwilling partner in the peace process and constantly \r\ntrying to impose a solution based on military force. \r\n We are going through a period of serious political \r\nactivity in order to revitalize a political process aimed \r\nat achieving a comprehensive peace agreement. \r\nHowever, we again emphasize that launching that \r\nprocess should be based on each party, in particular \r\nIsrael, implementing its obligations under the first \r\nphase of the Road Map, which basically calls for the \r\ncomplete cessation of all forms of settlement activities \r\nand the commitment to resolving the final status issues, \r\nin accordance with the known terms of reference, in \r\nparticular Jerusalem, refugees, borders, water, security \r\nand others. That position is the core of the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative, which we and all international Powers, \r\nA/64/PV.51  \r\n \r\n09-62352 10 \r\n \r\nwithout exception, in particular, the Quartet, have been \r\npursuing. \r\n We affirm that the Palestinian leadership, in any \r\nfuture political move, will adhere firmly to its \r\ncommitment to the national programme and the \r\nPalestinian peace initiative endorsed by the Palestinian \r\nNational Council, as stated in the Declaration of \r\nPalestinian Independence of 15 November 1988, to its \r\nobligations in the peace process in the Middle East that \r\nbegan in 1991, and to the two-State solution for the \r\nestablishment of an independent State of Palestine, \r\nwith East Jerusalem as its capital, in the Palestinian \r\nterritory under Israeli occupation since 1967. The \r\nPalestinian leadership remains committed to the \r\nMadrid terms of reference and the principle of land for \r\npeace, Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 \r\n(1973), 1397 (2002), 1515 (2003) and 1850 (2008), the \r\nArab Peace Initiative and the road map. \r\n However, we wish to reiterate that the Palestinian \r\nleadership fully rejects any ideas or schemes pertaining \r\nto an alternative homeland, to resettlement, or to a \r\nState with provisional borders. We reject Israel’s toying \r\nwith the peace process and using it as a cover to \r\nachieve its expansionist and settlement objectives, \r\nincluding the latest theatrical declaration by the Israeli \r\nPrime Minister of a partial and provisional suspension \r\nof settlement building in the West Bank but not in East \r\nJerusalem. That is not subject to debate. The State of \r\nPalestine will be based on the entire territory occupied \r\nin 1967 and on a solution to the Palestine refugee \r\nissue. The interests of Palestinians, wherever they are, \r\nform an indispensable priority that must be solved \r\njustly, in accordance with United Nations resolution \r\n194 (III) of 1948. The only means to resolve the \r\nconflict and to achieve peace in our region is complete \r\nwithdrawal of Israel from all Palestinian, Syrian and \r\nLebanese territories occupied since 1967 and a just \r\nsolution of the issue of Palestinian refugees. \r\n The obligations of the Palestinian and Israeli \r\nsides are specific and unambiguous. The Palestinian \r\nside has fulfilled all of its obligations, unlike Israel, \r\nwhich has not complied with any of its obligations, \r\nincluding in particular halting its settlement activities. \r\nWe are not placing any preconditions but we demand \r\nthat Israel fulfil its obligations as called for in the road \r\nmap referred to in Security Council resolution 1515 \r\n(2003). \r\n In conclusion, I wish to reiterate the immense \r\ngratitude and appreciation of the Palestinian people for \r\nall the support and solidarity extended to it over the \r\nyears by the international community, including the \r\nUnited Nations. In that connection, we express the \r\nhope that all countries will vote in favour of all of the \r\ndraft resolutions submitted under the agenda items on \r\nthe question of Palestine and the situation in the \r\nMiddle East, as well as all other draft resolutions \r\nrelevant to Palestine that will be put before the \r\nAssembly. We firmly believe in the principles and \r\npurposes of the Charter of the United Nations and of \r\ninternational law. We also believe that all free and \r\npeace-loving nations of the world stand for peace and \r\njustice and support the question of Palestine because it \r\nis a just and noble cause and because they wish to see \r\nan end to the suffering and pain of our people through \r\nthe realization of their rights and freedom and the \r\nestablishment of an independent State of Palestine. \r\nThey also wish to see an end to decades of occupation \r\nand cycles of violence, so that peace, security, stability, \r\njustice and prosperity will be achieved for all peoples \r\nof the Middle East region. We express the hope that \r\none day soon we shall gather here to celebrate the \r\ninclusion of the free and independent State of Palestine \r\namong the family of nations. \r\n Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt): I have the pleasure of \r\naddressing the General Assembly on this important \r\noccasion on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement.  \r\n Today we mark the International Day of \r\nSolidarity with the Palestinian People, which provides \r\na special opportunity for the international community \r\nto reaffirm its support for the legitimate endeavours of \r\nthe Palestinians to restore and fully exercise their \r\ninalienable rights, foremost among which is the right to \r\nestablish an independent, sovereign and viable State of \r\nPalestine with East Jerusalem as its capital. The \r\nMovement believes that the achievement of such a \r\nlofty goal should be based on the two-State solution, \r\nthe relevant Security Council and General Assembly \r\nresolutions, the Madrid principles and the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative. \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement therefore calls for \r\nthe early resumption of the peace process. It regrets the \r\nlack of progress that has been made, despite the \r\ninternational consensus on the urgent need for peace \r\nand the increased efforts by the international \r\ncommunity to achieve a just and lasting solution to the \r\nquestion of Palestine and comprehensive peace in the \r\n A/64/PV.51\r\n \r\n11 09-62352 \r\n \r\nMiddle East region. Regrettably, no progress has been \r\nmade, owing to Israel’s continued defiance of United \r\nNations resolutions and international law, including \r\ninternational humanitarian and human rights law. The \r\ninternational community must not waver in its calls \r\nupon Israel to cease its violations and to return to \r\nnegotiations in good faith. \r\n Since the consideration of the agenda item on the \r\nquestion of Palestine by the General Assembly in 2008, \r\nIsrael, the occupying Power, has not ceased its \r\nunlawful practices in the occupied Palestinian territory, \r\nincluding its collective punishment of the Palestinian \r\npeople in the Gaza Strip and its illegal settlement \r\nactivities in the West Bank. Moreover, Israel has used \r\nexcessive and indiscriminate force against Palestinian \r\ncivilians and has committed grave breaches of \r\ninternational humanitarian law and human rights law, \r\nas described by the United Nations Fact-Finding \r\nMission on the Gaza Conflict, the United Nations \r\nHeadquarters Board of Inquiry and the independent \r\nfact-finding mission of the League of Arab States. \r\nIsrael’s activities have had a negative impact on the \r\nconducive environment needed to achieve the objective \r\nof peace. They have also affected endeavours to \r\nresume negotiations and reach an agreement on final \r\nstatus core issues. \r\n Israel is continuing to impede efforts to resume \r\npeace negotiations by oppressing the Palestinian \r\npeople, refusing to stop settlement activities and trying \r\nto impose unilateral solutions by creating new facts on \r\nthe ground whose aim is to alter the status and \r\ncharacter of occupied Palestinian territory, including \r\nEast Jerusalem. Israel does not refrain from measures \r\nthat prejudice the outcome of negotiations on final \r\nstatus issues, namely, those of Jerusalem, settlements, \r\nrefugees, borders, security and water. Such illegal \r\nmeasures undermine confidence, inflame tensions on \r\nthe ground, prevent any progress and raise questions \r\nabout Israel’s credibility as a partner for peace. \r\n Israel is continuing its illegal settlement activities \r\nin the West Bank, in particular in and around East \r\nJerusalem. It is also intensifying its confiscation of \r\nPalestinian land, expanding settlements, transferring \r\nIsraeli settlers, constructing the wall and engaging in \r\nother destructive measures, including demolishing \r\nmore Palestinian homes, in an attempt to annex de \r\nfacto more Palestinian territory. All of that is being \r\ndone in grave breach of international law, United \r\nNations resolutions and Israel’s commitments under the \r\nroad map, which clearly call upon Israel to freeze all \r\nsettlement activities, including as a result of natural \r\ngrowth, and to dismantle all settlement outposts \r\nestablished since March 2001.  \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement continues to have \r\ngrave concerns in that regard. It also wishes to raise a \r\nwarning with regard to the effects of Israel’s ongoing \r\npolicy and the prospects for achieving a two-State \r\nsolution and establishing a viable Palestinian State. \r\nFurthermore, the Non-Aligned Movement is alarmed \r\nabout the latest illegal Israeli measures in the occupied \r\nWest Bank, including its approval of the construction \r\nof 900 additional new housing units in the Gilo \r\nsettlement, south of East Jerusalem. That contradicts \r\nthe internationally supported objective of resolving the \r\nconflict through the peace process. Settlement \r\nactivities undermine the possibility of realizing a two-\r\nState solution. The Non-Aligned Movement would like \r\nto draw the attention of the international community to \r\nthe fact that Israeli settlement expansion in occupied \r\nEast Jerusalem is accelerating at an unprecedented rate. \r\nThat expansion requires the demolition of Palestinian \r\nhomes and the eviction and displacement of hundreds \r\nof Palestinian families in a flagrant and illegal attempt \r\nto alter the demographic composition, status and nature \r\nof the city and to pre-empt any final solution to the \r\nconflict. \r\n Concerning the situation in occupied East \r\nJerusalem, the Non-Aligned Movement would like to \r\nexpress its grave alarm and warn against the continued \r\nand persistent attacks by extremist and militant Israeli \r\nsettlers, with the protection of Israeli forces, against \r\nPalestinian worshippers at the Islamic holy sites of \r\nAl-Haram Al-Sharif and the Al-Aqsa Mosque. Such \r\nattacks pose a threat and constitute a provocation in an \r\nalready volatile situation in the occupied city.  \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement expresses its grave \r\nconcern that, in defiance of the clear international \r\nconsensus rejecting Israeli illegal colonization in \r\noccupied East Jerusalem, Israel is continuing to \r\nconstruct settlements in the city and, inter alia, to \r\ndemolish Palestinian homes, evict Palestinian families, \r\nconfiscate their land and property and carry out \r\nexcavations in the city, including in the vicinity of the \r\nAl-Haram Al-Sharif compound. \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement condemns Israel’s \r\ncontinuing provocations and illegal actions against the \r\ncity’s holy sites and against its Palestinian inhabitants, \r\nA/64/PV.51  \r\n \r\n09-62352 12 \r\n \r\nwho are living under foreign occupation. Furthermore, \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement reiterates that it deplores \r\nall Israeli actions and provocative measures aimed at \r\naltering the demographic composition, geographic \r\nnature, character and status of occupied East \r\nJerusalem. The Non-Aligned Movement believes that \r\nthe time has come for the Security Council to \r\npronounce itself and to take a clear position and \r\nserious actions with regard to Israel’s violations in \r\noccupied East Jerusalem. \r\n The situation in Gaza also continues to be a \r\nmatter of grave concern for the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement. We have repeatedly stressed the fact that \r\nthe current situation in Gaza is unacceptable and \r\nunsustainable and has negative repercussions on all \r\nefforts to advance the peace process. By closing all its \r\ncrossing points to Gaza, Israel is continuing to impose \r\na blockade on the Palestinian civilian population, \r\nthereby depriving it of its humanitarian needs.  \r\n Israel is also continuing to prevent Gaza’s \r\nreconstruction, in violation of international \r\nhumanitarian law and United Nations resolutions, \r\nincluding Security Council resolution 1860 (2009) and \r\nthe resolution adopted at the resumption of the tenth \r\nemergency special session of the General Assembly \r\n(ES-10/18) on 15 and 16 January 2009. The \r\nNon-Aligned Movement demands that Israel \r\nimmediately lift its illegal blockade and allow for the \r\nimmediate and sustained opening of all border \r\ncrossings to alleviate the humanitarian crisis and to \r\nachieve the urgent early recovery and reconstruction of \r\nthe Gaza Strip. \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement stresses the urgent \r\nneed for reconstruction to begin in Gaza, including \r\nthrough the implementation of the Secretary-General’s \r\nproposal for the commencement of United Nations-led \r\ncivilian reconstruction activities and the completion of \r\nnumerous suspended projects managed by United \r\nNations agencies working on the ground despite the \r\navailability of funds. The Non-Aligned Movement \r\nregrets the continued obstruction of the import of \r\nessential reconstruction materials into Gaza as a result \r\nof the ongoing Israeli blockade. \r\n A peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine \r\nrequires a rapid response and intensive efforts by the \r\ninternational community to rectify the unlawful current \r\nsituation in the occupied Palestinian territory and to \r\ncommit Israel to comply with its obligations under \r\ninternational law and international humanitarian law. \r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement believes that respect for \r\ninternational law will bring about a real change in the \r\nsituation and create the appropriate environment for \r\npursuing the negotiation of a final, just and lasting \r\nsettlement that will bring the peace, stability and \r\ncoexistence that our long-troubled region needs and \r\ndeserves. \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement calls upon the \r\nSecurity Council to act in conjunction with the General \r\nAssembly to fulfil its permanent responsibility with \r\nregard to the question of Palestine until it is resolved \r\nthrough the establishment of a Palestinian State, \r\nthereby fulfilling the vision of a two-State solution. \r\n In conclusion, the question of Palestine and the \r\nMiddle East peace process is now at a crucial juncture. \r\nFulfilling the vision of the two-State solution of \r\nPalestine and Israel living side by side in peace and \r\nsecurity is the only way to settle the question of \r\nPalestine and to restore peace in the Middle East. The \r\nNon-Aligned Movement supports the achievement of \r\nthe two-State solution and will continue to support the \r\nPalestinian people and its leadership in their \r\nendeavours to bring an end to the long-standing Israeli \r\noccupation, which began in 1967, through a just, \r\nlasting and peaceful solution in accordance with \r\ninternational law and United Nations resolutions. \r\n Mr. Ja’afari (Syrian Arab Republic): I have the \r\nhonour to make this statement on behalf of the \r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC). \r\n The OIC would like to express its serious concern \r\nabout the grave situation in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritory, in particular the continuing inhuman Israeli \r\nblockade and the dire humanitarian crisis being \r\nimposed on the Palestinian civilian population in the \r\nGaza Strip, as well as the ongoing illegal colonization \r\ncampaign being carried out by Israel, the occupying \r\nPower, in and around Al-Quds Al-Sharif. \r\n The international community has witnessed and \r\ncondemned Israel’s illegal and intensifying \r\ncolonization measures in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritory, the ongoing settlement activities, the \r\npersistent aggression against Islamic and Christian \r\nholy places in Al-Quds Al-Sharif, the transfer of more \r\nIsraeli settlers, the continued construction of the \r\nseparation wall in and around the holy city, which \r\nincludes changing its demographic and geographic \r\ncharacter, the restrictions on the freedom of movement \r\n A/64/PV.51\r\n \r\n13 09-62352 \r\n \r\nof Palestinian citizens, their unlawful detention, the \r\ndemolition of Palestinian houses and, in particular, the \r\ncontinued excavation work in and around the Al-Aqsa \r\nmosque. \r\n The OIC emphasizes that the question of the holy \r\nAl-Haram Al-Sharif in Al-Quds Al-Sharif is a red line \r\nthat cannot be addressed with laxity or be the subject \r\nof any debate. Any prejudice to the holy Al-Aqsa \r\nmosque will have very serious repercussions for the \r\nIslamic world and is likely to destabilize the region. \r\n The OIC affirms its unwavering support for the \r\nstand of the State of Palestine based on a commitment \r\nto the right of sovereignty over Palestinian territories \r\noccupied in 1967, including Al-Quds Al-Sharif, \r\nAl-Haram Al-Sharif and all Christian and Muslim holy \r\nplaces that are part of the Palestinian territories \r\noccupied since 4 June 1967. It also emphasizes that \r\nAl-Quds is the capital of the independent State of \r\nPalestine. In that regard, the OIC rejects any attempt to \r\nundermine the Palestinian right of sovereignty over \r\nAl-Quds Al-Sharif. \r\n We strongly condemn the recent attacks by the \r\nIsraeli occupying forces and extremist settlers \r\nperpetrated against Palestinian civilians and \r\nworshippers at Al-Aqsa mosque and the Al-Haram \r\nAl-Sharif compound in occupied Al-Quds Al-Sharif. \r\nOur group reiterates its condemnation of Israel’s \r\npersistent aggression against Islamic and Christian \r\nholy places in Al-Quds Al-Sharif and against the \r\nPalestinian inhabitants of the holy city. That aggression \r\ncontinues to cause rising tensions and mounting \r\ndifficulties for the Palestinian inhabitants of the city in \r\nall spheres of life.  \r\n That ongoing aggression is a new chapter in the \r\nconstant saga of terror committed by Israel, the \r\noccupying Power. This current aggression began on \r\n27 September 2009 with Israel’s excavation activity, \r\nwhich seeks to undermine the symbolic and sacred \r\nsignificance of the city for Muslims throughout the \r\nworld and to the Islamic faith itself. \r\n Early this year, the international community \r\nwitnessed with horror the events in the occupied Gaza \r\nStrip. The Goldstone report (A/HRC/12/48) confirmed \r\nthe international community’s worst fears about the \r\ncommission of war crimes and crimes against \r\nhumanity, including wilful killings, deliberate attacks \r\non civilian objects, the wanton destruction of civilian \r\nproperty, indiscriminate attacks, the use of human \r\nshields and collective punishment against Gaza’s \r\ncivilian population in the form of a continuing \r\nblockade by Israel during its aggression on the Gaza \r\nStrip, which continues to this very moment. \r\n The OIC welcomes the General Assembly’s \r\nadoption, on 5 November 2009, of resolution 64/10, \r\nentitled “Follow-up to the report of the United Nations \r\nFact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict”. We are of \r\nthe view that this resolution constitutes an important \r\nfirst step in remedying those Israeli violations, which \r\nhave been confirmed and authenticated in the \r\nGoldstone report. Hence, further action is yet to be \r\ntaken by the relevant organs and bodies of the United \r\nNations, including by the Security Council, in order to \r\nbring the Israeli perpetrators of those crimes to justice \r\nand to put an end to Israel’s impunity and above-the-\r\nlaw attitude. \r\n Israel has left behind much more than dead and \r\ninjured Palestinians in the bleeding Gaza Strip. Israeli \r\njets, tanks and battleships could see only one target on \r\ntheir radar screens — civilians — and yet they fired. \r\nThat was documented by a United Nations team. Israel \r\nhas therefore placed the United Nations in a situation \r\nin which it has either to react or to tell us why it does \r\nnot. \r\n The OIC remains deeply concerned by Israel’s \r\nongoing air and land violations of Lebanon’s \r\nsovereignty, in breach of Security Council resolution \r\n1701 (2006). The OIC calls on Israel to withdraw fully \r\nfrom the remaining Lebanese occupied land in the \r\nShab’a Farms, the Kfar Shouba hills and the northern \r\npart of the village of Al-Ghajar. \r\n The OIC also reaffirms that all measures and \r\nactions taken or to be taken by Israel, the occupying \r\nPower, to alter the legal, physical and demographic \r\nstatus of the occupied Syrian Golan and its institutional \r\nstructure or to impose jurisdiction and administration \r\nthere are null and void and have no legal effect. The \r\nOIC demands that Israel abide by Security Council \r\nresolution 497 (1981) and withdraw fully from the \r\noccupied Syrian Golan to the lines of 4 June 1967, in \r\nimplementation also of Security Council resolutions \r\n242 (1967) and 338 (1973). \r\n The OIC calls for an intensification of efforts by \r\nthe international community aimed at accelerating the \r\nprocess of achieving a just and comprehensive peace \r\nsettlement on the basis of the relevant United Nations \r\nresolutions, the Madrid terms of reference, including \r\nA/64/PV.51  \r\n \r\n09-62352 14 \r\n \r\nthe principle of land for peace, the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative and the Road Map. In that regard, the OIC \r\nreiterates its firm and unwavering support for the just \r\ncause of Palestine. The OIC calls for the speedy \r\nrealization by the Palestinian people of their \r\ninalienable rights, including their right to self-\r\ndetermination, with the establishment of their \r\nindependent State of Palestine, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif \r\nas its capital, and a just solution to the plight of the \r\nPalestine refugees on the basis of resolution 194 (III). \r\n Mr. Lidén (Sweden): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of the European Union (EU). Turkey, \r\nCroatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, \r\nAlbania, Montenegro, Serbia, Iceland, Ukraine and the \r\nRepublic of Moldova align themselves with this \r\nstatement. \r\n The European Union continues to be concerned \r\nabout the current lack of movement in the Middle East \r\npeace process. The combination of negative \r\ndevelopments on the ground and limited achievements \r\nin the diplomatic efforts is dangerous. At this juncture, \r\nrelaunched negotiations and positive movement on the \r\nground are urgently needed to create hope and \r\nstrengthen the hand of those working for peace. If we \r\nfail, the responsibility will be for all of us to bear, and \r\nthe consequences will also be felt widely. \r\n The European Union remains committed to a \r\ncomprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict on \r\nthe basis of international law, the relevant resolutions of \r\nthe Security Council, the terms of reference of the \r\nMadrid Conference, including the principle of land for \r\npeace, the Road Map, the agreements previously reached \r\nby the parties and the Arab Peace Initiative. We reiterate \r\nthe need to ensure a political solution, with two states — \r\nIsrael and an independent, democratic and viable \r\nPalestinian State — living side by side in peace and \r\nsecurity. We welcome the United States \r\nAdministration’s commitment to pursuing vigorously \r\nthe two-State solution and comprehensive peace in the \r\nMiddle East. The European Union is ready to work \r\nwith the parties to the conflict as well as with the \r\nUnited States, other Quartet members and Arab \r\npartners to achieve that goal. The two-State solution is \r\nthe road to future security for both peoples.  \r\n Both parties must now take concrete measures to \r\nresume peace negotiations, while respecting previous \r\nagreements and understandings. The continuing \r\nsettlement activities, house demolitions and evictions \r\nin the occupied Palestinian territories, including in East \r\nJerusalem, remain a serious concern for the European \r\nUnion. We urge the Government of Israel to end \r\nimmediately those settlement activities, including so-\r\ncalled natural growth, and to dismantle all outposts \r\nerected since March 2001. The European Union \r\nreiterates that the settlements are illegal under \r\ninternational law and constitute an obstacle to peace. \r\nThe EU will not recognize any changes to the pre-1967 \r\nborders other than those agreed by both parties. \r\n A durable solution to the Gaza crisis has to be \r\nachieved through the full implementation of Security \r\nCouncil resolution 1860 (2009). The European Union \r\nremains gravely concerned at the humanitarian \r\nsituation in Gaza and calls for the immediate and \r\nunconditional opening of crossings to the flow of \r\nhumanitarian aid, commercial goods and persons to \r\nand from Gaza. Reconstruction and economic recovery \r\nhave to be allowed. An effective mechanism to prevent \r\nammunition smuggling into the Gaza Strip must also \r\nbe established. The European Union calls for a \r\ncomplete stop to all violence, including a sustained halt \r\nto rocket attacks against Israel. We reiterate our call on \r\nthose holding the abducted Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit \r\nto release him without delay. \r\n The European Union is also very concerned about \r\nthe recent incidents in East Jerusalem. We have been \r\nfollowing closely the situation around the Al-Aqsa \r\nmosque and the Temple Mount/Al-Haram Al-Sharif. \r\nWe urge all parties to refrain from any provocative \r\nactions that could further inflame tensions or lead to \r\nviolence. Everyone must take action to avoid \r\nescalation. If there is to be genuine peace, a way must \r\nbe found to resolve the status of Jerusalem as the future \r\ncapital of two States. \r\n This year, as we commemorate the sixtieth \r\nanniversary of the four Geneva Conventions, the \r\nEuropean Union reiterates the importance it attaches to \r\nthe Geneva Conventions, which, together with their \r\nAdditional Protocols, form the heart of international \r\nhumanitarian law. We call on all parties to stop \r\nincitement and violence against civilians. Respect for \r\ninternational humanitarian law and human rights law \r\nmust be ensured. The European Union emphasizes the \r\nimportance of appropriate and credible investigations \r\ninto possible violations of international human rights \r\nlaw and international humanitarian law. \r\n A/64/PV.51\r\n \r\n15 09-62352 \r\n \r\n The European Union calls upon the Palestinians \r\nto step up the intra-Palestinian reconciliation efforts \r\nbehind President Mahmoud Abbas. We support the \r\nmediation by Egypt and the Arab League. The \r\nEuropean Union will continue to promote Palestinian \r\nState-building and will intensify work on reforms, in \r\npartnership with the Palestinian Authority. The efforts \r\nof the Palestinian Authority to develop an effective and \r\nreformed security sector are positive. We will \r\ncooperate towards additional improvement. Civilian \r\npolice and the judicial sector will continue to be a \r\nfocus of European Union support. \r\n The declared readiness of the Government of \r\nIsrael to promote Palestinian economic development is \r\na positive sign. This should be carried out within the \r\nframework of the broader perspective of the two-State \r\nsolution. The European Union welcomes the positive \r\nsteps taken by the Israeli authorities regarding the \r\neasing of restrictions on the West Bank. The ongoing \r\nlimitations of freedom of movement in the West Bank \r\nnegatively affect the human rights situation. We \r\ntherefore look forward to further and sustained \r\nimprovements of movement and access in all of the \r\noccupied Palestinian territories. The Agreement on \r\nMovement and Access of 2005 must be fully \r\nimplemented. The European Union is ready to work \r\nclosely with Israel, the Palestinian Authority and \r\ninternational donors to achieve the sustainable \r\ndevelopment of the Palestinian economy. \r\n The European Union will contribute substantially \r\nto post-conflict arrangements aimed at ensuring the \r\nsustainability of peace agreements and addressing the \r\nregional economic and security dimensions. We call on \r\nall partners in the international community to \r\ncontribute actively to the achievement of a \r\ncomprehensive settlement. In the light of further \r\ndevelopments at the political level and on the ground, \r\nthe European Union stands ready to support concrete \r\nand early results on the path to a comprehensive \r\nsettlement of the conflict. \r\n Mr. Salam (Lebanon): Does one need to recall \r\nthat the principle of the self-determination of peoples \r\nis among the fundamental purposes of the United \r\nNations, as enshrined in Chapter I, Article 1, of the \r\nCharter? Does one need to recall that the principle of \r\nthe self-determination of peoples was confirmed by \r\nthis Assembly in its resolution 637 (VII) of 1952 on the \r\nright of people and nations to self-determination; in its \r\nDeclaration on the Granting of Independence to \r\nColonial Countries and Peoples, adopted in 1960 as \r\nresolution 1514 (XV); in its resolution 1803 (XVII) of \r\n1962 on permanent sovereignty over natural resources; \r\nand in its Declaration of Principles of International \r\nLaw concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation \r\nAmong States in accordance with the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, which was unanimously adopted as \r\nresolution 2625 (XXV) in 1970 and is considered an \r\nexpression of customary international law? \r\n Moreover, does one need to recall that common \r\narticle 1 of both the International Covenant on \r\nEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights and the \r\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights \r\nreaffirms the right of all peoples to self-determination? \r\n Self-determination has become almost \r\nsynonymous with the long struggle of the Palestinian \r\npeople to exercise their internationally recognized \r\ninalienable rights, including the right to national \r\nindependence and sovereignty and the right to return to \r\nthe homes and property from which they have been \r\nuprooted. The mere fact, however, that this Assembly \r\nhas been meeting on a yearly basis since 1978 to \r\ncelebrate the International Day of Solidarity with the \r\nPalestinian People is in itself an indication of the \r\nenormity of the obstacles preventing the Palestinian \r\npeople from exercising their right to self-\r\ndetermination. \r\n The aforementioned resolutions of this Assembly \r\nconvey upon States not only the obligation to respect \r\nthe principle of self-determination, but also the duty to \r\nrefrain from actions which deprive peoples of such a \r\nright. In this case, however, not only has Israel failed \r\nto withdraw from the Palestinian territories that it \r\noccupied in 1967, as per its legal obligations under \r\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 \r\n(1973), but it has also been creating a series of facts on \r\nthe ground in the occupied territories in the form of \r\nsecurity zones, settlements, bypass roads and \r\ncheckpoints, not to mention the annexation of East \r\nJerusalem and the erection of the wall, which all \r\nprevent the Palestinian people from exercising its right \r\nto self-determination. \r\n The magnitude of these facts on the ground is \r\nwell illustrated by the size and growth of settlement \r\nactivities in the occupied territories. So-called official \r\nsettlements have recently exceeded 120, in addition to \r\nsome 100 so-called unofficial outposts. According to \r\nthe Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the \r\nA/64/PV.51  \r\n \r\n09-62352 16 \r\n \r\nOccupied Territories, B’Tselem, the number of settlers \r\nin the West Bank by the end of 2008 stood at 479,000, \r\nincluding 193,000 in East Jerusalem. It is also \r\nnoteworthy that by 2008, the settler population — \r\nexcluding East Jerusalem — had grown at a much \r\nfaster rate than the general population of Israel: 4.7 per \r\ncent compared to 1.6 per cent, respectively. The same \r\nwas true in 2007. \r\n Mr. Cabral (Guinea-Bissau), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n In addition, the International Court of Justice in \r\nits Advisory Opinion of July 2004 found that vast \r\nsections of the wall that are on occupied Palestinian \r\nterritory  \r\n “severely impede[s] the exercise by the \r\nPalestinian people of its right to self-\r\ndetermination, and is therefore a breach of \r\nIsrael’s obligation to respect that right”.  \r\nThe Court ruled that Israel is legally obliged to “return \r\nthe land, orchards, olive groves and other immovable \r\nproperty seized”.  \r\n However, five years on, construction of the wall \r\ncontinues, with approximately 200 kilometres built \r\nsince the Advisory Opinion was rendered. \r\nApproximately 58 per cent of the 709-kilometre wall is \r\ncomplete; a further 10 per cent is under construction \r\nand 31.5 per cent is planned. The total area located \r\nbetween the wall and the Green Line amounts to \r\n9.5 per cent of the West Bank. When completed, the \r\nmajority of the route, or approximately 85 per cent of \r\nit, will run inside the West Bank and East Jerusalem \r\nrather than along the 1949 armistice line. Also, when \r\ncompleted, this wall will be four times as long as the \r\nno-less-infamous Berlin Wall, which was \r\n155 kilometres long. Reaching in places a height of \r\n8 metres, it will also be twice as high as the Berlin \r\nwall, the average height of which was 3.6 metres. \r\n Until such time as it complies with its obligations \r\nto withdraw from the occupied Palestinian territories, \r\nthus removing the main impediment to the Palestinian \r\npeople exercising their right to self-determination, \r\nIsrael’s duties as the occupying Power in the West \r\nBank and Gaza shall remain those described under \r\ninternational humanitarian law as set out in The Hague \r\nRegulations and the Geneva Convention relative to the \r\nProtection of Civilian Persons in Time of War. This has \r\nbeen reaffirmed in repeated resolutions by the General \r\nAssembly and the Security Council, by the high \r\ncontracting parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention \r\nand by the International Court of Justice in its \r\nAdvisory Opinion on the wall. \r\n However, since 1967, Israel, as an occupying \r\nPower, has constantly and systematically violated its \r\nbasic duties under international humanitarian law. Such \r\nviolations have included the annexation of land, the \r\npunitive demolition of houses, the transfer of \r\npopulations, collective punishment, political \r\nassassinations and the use of torture. \r\n In addition, based on evidence gathered by \r\ninternationally respected human rights organizations, \r\nsuch as Amnesty International and Human Rights \r\nWatch, and by the United Nations Fact-Finding \r\nMission on the Gaza Conflict, led by Judge Richard \r\nGoldstone, Israel has been charged with grave \r\nviolations of human rights and with a number of war \r\ncrimes in its conduct of military operations in the \r\noccupied territories. Those include failing to protect \r\ncivilian populations; deliberately attacking civilian \r\ntargets; the premeditated killing of civilians; denying \r\nmedical aid to wounded Palestinians; firing at civilians \r\ncarrying white flags; carrying out attacks on the \r\nfoundations of civilian life, such as the destruction of \r\nindustrial infrastructure, food production, water \r\ninstallations and sewage treatment plants; using \r\nPalestinian civilians as human shields; detaining \r\ncivilians, including women and children, in humiliating \r\nand degrading conditions; arbitrarily depriving \r\nPalestinians of liberty and violating their due process \r\nrights; and using phosphorus bombs in residential areas \r\nand using dense inert metal explosive munitions. \r\n For too long, Israel has systematically challenged \r\nthe will of this Assembly. For too long, it has shown \r\nflagrant disrespect for international law. For too long, \r\nits war criminals have benefited from impunity. \r\n Seeking to reverse this trend, earlier this month \r\nthis Assembly demonstrated resolve by endorsing the \r\nreport of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on \r\nthe Gaza Conflict (A/HRC/12/48), led by Justice \r\nRichard Goldstone. More resolve will be needed, \r\nhowever, if we are one day to celebrate the fact that we \r\nno longer need an International Day of Solidarity with \r\nthe Palestinian People. My delegation is confident that \r\nthis day will come because the cause of the Palestinian \r\nPeople is just and because international law must \r\nultimately prevail. \r\n A/64/PV.51\r\n \r\n17 09-62352 \r\n \r\n Mr. Benmehidi (Algeria) (spoke in French): For \r\nover three decades now, the General Assembly has \r\nidentified the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as the core of \r\nthe problem in the Middle East and has put forward \r\nproposals for its settlement.  \r\n Today, as we celebrate the International Day of \r\nSolidarity with the Palestinian People, my delegation \r\nwould like to reaffirm Algeria’s unfailing solidarity \r\nwith the Palestinian people in their struggle to exercise \r\ntheir inalienable rights, first and foremost their right to \r\nestablish in their land an independent, sovereign and \r\nviable State with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, on \r\nthe basis of the pertinent resolutions of the General \r\nAssembly and the Security Council and in line with the \r\nprinciples underpinning the Arab Peace Initiative.  \r\n When faced with the clear framework for the \r\nsettlement of this conflict based on the principles of \r\ninternational law and international legality, Israel’s \r\nresponse has always been one of defiance of the efforts \r\nof the international community and disdain for its \r\npeace partner. This negative trend attained its peak \r\nduring the horrifying military aggression by Israel \r\nagainst the defensive population of the Gaza Strip. \r\nThat aggression caused the deaths of over 1,400 \r\nPalestinian civilians, most of whom were \r\nnon-combatants, including women and children, not to \r\nmention the thousands of injured and the essential \r\ninfrastructure that was totally or partially destroyed. \r\nThat serious situation was created deliberately and \r\nleads us to note that the peace process has been \r\ncompletely deadlocked since the General Assembly \r\nexamined the question of Palestine at its sixty-third \r\nsession. \r\n Achieving comprehensive peace in the Middle \r\nEast is a shared goal of the international community, \r\nwhich has spared no effort in seeking to patiently \r\ndefine a negotiated settlement framework that depends \r\non the good faith of both parties in question and cedes \r\nno ground in terms of the Palestinian people’s \r\ninalienable rights.  \r\n Despite the declared commitment to lasting peace \r\nbased on a two-State solution, over the past year we \r\nhave witnessed Israel’s continued application of illegal \r\nand aggressive policies and practices, which all seek to \r\ntorpedo an already fragile peace process. The impact of \r\nIsrael’s aggression against the Palestinian people in \r\nGaza has become tragically obvious, given the \r\nincontrovertible truth of pictures taken and reports \r\ndrawn up by United Nations bodies. This should have \r\nprompted the international community, in particular the \r\nSecurity Council, to play a more decisive role, first in \r\nputting an end to the aggression, and then in pushing \r\nfor a peaceful and definitive solution to the conflict.  \r\n Instead, the reaction was only one of vague moral \r\ndisapproval that failed to sway Israel in the pursuit of \r\nits concealed designs. The international community \r\nmust not continue to tolerate such impunity. The law \r\nmust prevail once again. The General Assembly, for its \r\npart, in adopting resolution 64/10 on the conclusions of \r\nthe Goldstone report (A/HRC/12/48), has shown a way \r\nforward that does not depend on the abhorrent practice \r\nof applying double standards. \r\n All the reports of United Nations bodies highlight \r\nthe disturbing deterioration of the situation in the \r\noccupied Palestinian territories due to the illegal and \r\ndestructive policies and practices adopted by Israel, the \r\noccupying Power. In Gaza, the complete and ongoing \r\nblockade imposed by Israel has led to some \r\nparticularly worrisome developments.  \r\n More than 10 months after Israel’s destructive \r\nmilitary aggression, the Palestinian population is still \r\nliving in a state of siege, with limited freedom of \r\nmovement, restrictions on the import of even basic \r\ngoods and negative gains in terms of economic \r\ndevelopment. The intensity of the conflict and its \r\ndestructive impact have seriously exacerbated the \r\nhumanitarian crisis, causing environmental \r\ndegradation, health problems and a deterioration in \r\nfood security.  \r\n Given the heavy sacrifices made by the \r\nPalestinian people in Gaza, and in the light of \r\nestablished international standards, this situation is \r\nunacceptable. In particular, it runs counter to the \r\nprovisions of Security Council resolution 1860 (2009). \r\nThe Council should, with no further hesitation, call for \r\nthe criminal and illegal blockade to be lifted, \r\nimmediately and unconditionally. \r\n The situation in the West Bank and East \r\nJerusalem is also extremely worrying. Israel is \r\ncontinuing its illegal settlement activities, particularly \r\nin and around Jerusalem, stepping up its confiscation \r\nof Palestinian lands, its destruction and seizure of their \r\nhouses, and expanding settlements and moving settlers \r\nwith the clear goal of creating fait accompli situations, \r\nparticularly since, in violation of the advisory opinion \r\nof 9 July 2004 of the International Court of Justice, the \r\nA/64/PV.51  \r\n \r\n09-62352 18 \r\n \r\nwall of separation that Israel continues to build \r\ndeviates clearly from the 1967 Green Line and crosses \r\ninto the occupied Palestinian territory in the West \r\nBank. Algeria firmly condemns Israel’s provocations \r\nand illegal actions against Jerusalem’s holy sites, \r\naimed at changing the city’s demographic composition \r\nand status. We appeal to the Security Council to \r\nshoulder its responsibility and require Israel with the \r\nutmost urgency to immediately lift the illegal blockade \r\nof Gaza and bring a complete halt to the settlements \r\nand their expansion, and to adopt the necessary \r\ndecisions to deal with Israel’s provocative measures, \r\nparticularly in Jerusalem, that seek to strip the peace \r\nprocess of its substance. \r\n The quest for a negotiated solution to the Israeli-\r\nPalestinian conflict must be based on the principles of \r\ninternational law and the conditions and parameters \r\ndefined in the draft resolution on the peaceful \r\nsettlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict \r\n(A/64/L.23) that will be adopted at the end of our \r\nwork. The international community is within its rights \r\nto demand that the global rejection of these barbaric \r\nacts should be reflected in binding decisions on Israel \r\nby the Security Council. The United Nations should \r\nalso implement standards concerning the protection of \r\ncivilians in armed conflict in order to protect the \r\ncivilian population of Palestine, who have been \r\nsubjected to collective punishment. \r\n Only by ensuring that these parameters are \r\nimplemented on the ground and by stepping up \r\ndemands with respect to the Charter and to \r\ninternational law will our Organization restore its \r\ncredibility and encourage the Middle East peace \r\nprocess by protecting it from power struggles and faits \r\naccomplis. \r\n Mr. Hoang Chi Trung (Viet Nam): To begin, \r\nallow me, on the occasion of the International Day of \r\nSolidarity with the Palestinian People, to convey the \r\nwarmest greetings of the Government and people of \r\nViet Nam to the Government and people of Palestine. \r\n The Vietnamese delegation wishes to align itself \r\nwith the statement delivered by the representative of \r\nEgypt on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement. \r\n The question of Palestine remains the oldest \r\nunresolved issue on the agenda of the United Nations. \r\nFor many decades now, the Palestinian people have \r\ncontinued to be deprived of their inalienable rights and \r\nto undergo much suffering and sacrifice. This year has \r\nbeen marked by the steady deterioration of the security, \r\neconomic and humanitarian situation in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, and by \r\nthe breakdown of the political process. It is truly \r\nheartrending to see more lives of innocent Palestinian \r\nand Israeli civilians lost or harmed in this conflict. \r\nDespite unanimous appeals by the world community, \r\nthe Israeli authorities continue to move ahead with \r\ntheir policies of occupation, settlement expansion and \r\nblockade in the occupied Palestinian territory, \r\nincluding the ongoing settlement activity, land \r\nconfiscation and destruction of Palestinians’ homes and \r\nproperty in and around East Jerusalem. Those measures \r\nhave seriously affected the legal, demographic and \r\ncultural character and status of the city, threatening to \r\ndestroy the fragile hopes for the restoration of the \r\npeace process as well as the search for a two-State \r\nsolution to the long-running conflict. \r\n Our delegation wishes to reiterate that the \r\nsettlements and the wall constructed by Israel in the \r\noccupied Palestinian territory, including East \r\nJerusalem, are contrary to international law and to \r\nnumerous resolutions of the Security Council and the \r\nGeneral Assembly as well as the provisions of the road \r\nmap. We call upon Israel to immediately cease all its \r\nillegal settlement activity, including construction \r\nrelated to natural growth, and to dismantle settlement \r\noutposts and refrain from provocative actions. \r\n Viet Nam has expressed its profound concerns \r\nover the findings contained in the Goldstone Report \r\n(A/HRC/12/48) regarding the accusations of war \r\ncrimes, as well as other violations of international \r\nhumanitarian law, committed during the Gaza conflict. \r\nIn this context, we welcome the General Assembly’s \r\nadoption on 5 November of resolution 64/10, which \r\ncalls on both Israel and Palestine to investigate the \r\naccusations of war crimes committed during the \r\nincursion of the Israeli armed forces into Gaza. We \r\nwelcome the statements made by the two sides that \r\nthey will conduct those investigations. It is our hope \r\nthat the parties concerned will do their utmost to \r\nconduct early and proper investigations and bring \r\njustice to the victims. \r\n In addition, we wish to urge the Palestinian \r\nfactions to make greater efforts to promote national \r\nreconciliation and to rally behind the Palestinian \r\nNational Authority for a Government of national unity \r\nand future statehood. We also call for early resumption \r\nof the permanent status negotiations between Israel and \r\n A/64/PV.51\r\n \r\n19 09-62352 \r\n \r\nPalestine. In this connection, the continued strong \r\nsupport of the international community is crucial in \r\norder to get the peace process back on track and enable \r\nIsraeli-Palestinian negotiations to move forward on all \r\ncore issues. We thus support the collective efforts and \r\nall peace initiatives of the United Nations, the Quartet, \r\nthe League of Arab States and the international \r\ncommunity in the quest for a two-State solution based \r\non internationally recognized guidelines such as the \r\nroad map, the Annapolis outcomes, the principle of \r\nland for peace, the Arab Peace Initiative and relevant \r\nSecurity Council resolutions, including, recently, \r\nresolutions 1850 (2008) and 1860 (2009). \r\n On this occasion, my delegation wishes to \r\nreiterate the consistent support of the Government and \r\npeople of Viet Nam for the just cause of the Palestinian \r\npeople in their heroic and tireless struggle for \r\nindependence, sovereignty and statehood. \r\n Mr. Shalgham (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): This meeting is especially important \r\nbecause it is the first held to consider this item since \r\nthe adoption on 5 November 2009 of General \r\nAssembly resolution 64/10 on the report of the Fact-\r\nFinding Mission on the Gaza Conflict. That document, \r\nthe Goldstone Report, called for an impartial and \r\nindependent investigation into violations of human \r\nrights and war crimes against civilians in the Gaza \r\nStrip. It seems that the Israeli authorities will deal with \r\nthis as they have dealt with previous resolutions, \r\nbecause Israel believes it is a State above the law and \r\ncannot be held accountable or subjected to punishment. \r\nInstead of trying to achieve progress on the ground and \r\nimprove conditions for Palestinians — whether in the \r\nGaza Strip or the West Bank — and to convince the \r\nworld of the need to focus on the peace process, Israel \r\nannounced that it was allowing the construction of \r\n900 more settlement units in East Jerusalem, in flagrant \r\ndefiance of the international community and \r\ninternational legitimacy, thus emphasizing their lack of \r\ninterest in the peace process. \r\n The situation in the region has plunged to \r\nunprecedented levels of deterioration owing to the \r\nintransigence of the Israeli authorities and their lack of \r\ninterest in negotiating with the Palestinians. The way \r\nIsraeli authorities respond to international resolutions \r\nand calls by the international community are clear.  \r\n The killing and detention of Palestinians have \r\ncontinued, settlement activities have intensified, the \r\nstate of siege in Gaza has been reinforced, the number \r\nof barriers in the West Bank has increased, the \r\ndemolition of houses continues and the building of the \r\nwall persists. The whole world has witnessed how the \r\nIsraeli army and the security forces of Israel have \r\nprovided protection for the acts of terrorism \r\nperpetuated by the settlers and extremists against \r\nPalestinian people. All of that has resulted in \r\nunbearable daily living conditions for Palestinians. \r\n The continuation of that situation goes against the \r\ngrain of what has been achieved all over the world in \r\nthe field of human rights since the adoption of the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. It undermines \r\nthe credibility and effectiveness of the United Nations \r\nand turns the principles of international law and the \r\nvalues of human rights into empty slogans and tools to \r\nbe used by a certain country according to its interests \r\nand political objectives. It leads to a culture of \r\nviolence, hatred and extremism in the region. \r\n Libya is of the view that the international \r\ncommunity must, pursuant to the letter and spirit of the \r\nCharter, consider and resolve the question of Palestine, \r\nwhich has represented a continuous threat to \r\ninternational peace and security for six decades. The \r\ninternational community has to put an end to the \r\nsuffering of the Palestinian people and the other \r\npeoples of the region because of what they are \r\nsubjected to in terms of violations of human rights, \r\ninternational law and international humanitarian law by \r\nthe Israeli occupying forces. Those violations have \r\nreached unprecedented levels in their atrociousness, \r\nscope, duration and contravention of all international \r\nnorms and laws. \r\n Peace efforts aimed at achieving a two-State \r\nsolution have reached a dead end because of Israeli \r\npolicies and that option has, thus, become unrealistic, \r\nespecially with the disappearance of the land on which \r\nthe Palestinians have dreamt of establishing their State \r\nand the continuation by Israel of the confiscation of \r\nPalestinian land for settlements, in clear defiance of all \r\ninternational resolutions. \r\n It is therefore time for the international \r\ncommunity to seriously consider another option to \r\nresolve the question of Palestine, namely, a solution \r\nthat takes into account historic experience and fulfils \r\nboth Jewish and Palestinian aspirations, namely, the \r\nestablishment of a single democratic State in which the \r\ntwo peoples coexist with equal rights and duties. On \r\nA/64/PV.51  \r\n \r\n09-62352 20 \r\n \r\n23 September, that option was proposed by Brother \r\nMuammar Al-Qadhafi, the initiator of the resolution \r\nbefore the General Assembly. We urge States to support \r\nthat option, which proved to be effective in South \r\nAfrica. There is no other alternative in light of Israeli \r\nintransigence, the confiscation of land and the \r\ncontinued suffering of the Palestinian people. \r\n Mr. Kleib (Indonesia): Let me first of all extend \r\nour appreciation to the Secretary-General and the \r\nCommittee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of \r\nthe Palestinian People for their respective reports, \r\ncontained in documents A/64/351 and A/64/35. \r\nIndonesia fully shares the observations as well as the \r\nrecommendations contained in both reports. \r\n My delegation also wishes to associate itself with \r\nthe statement delivered by the representative of Egypt \r\non behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, and the \r\nrepresentative of Syria on behalf of the Islamic \r\nConference of Foreign Ministers. \r\n Today, we held a solemn meeting to observe the \r\nInternational Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian \r\nPeople. Every year on this occasion, the international \r\ncommunity reiterates its full support for the Palestinian \r\npeople in the exercise of their inalienable right to \r\nestablish a sovereign and independent State. Indonesia \r\nis of the view that the past year is the one of the worst \r\nfor the struggle of the Palestinians to achieve their \r\nlegitimate rights. \r\n Following the brief flicker of hope for the two-\r\nState solution, arising from the Annapolis Conference \r\nat the end of 2007, Israeli-Palestinian negotiations \r\nwere soon abandoned, to be replaced by renewed \r\nviolence. We witnessed the inhumane Israeli military \r\nassault in the Gaza Strip, causing immense loss of lives \r\nand injuries to thousands of Palestinians. \r\n The Goldstone report has shown that an excessive \r\nand disproportionate use of force and a policy of \r\ncollective punishment were intentionally inflicted on \r\nthe people of Gaza. Israel committed a variety of \r\ncrimes, including war crimes, and violations of \r\ninternational law and international humanitarian law, \r\nincluding the Fourth Geneva Convention. The war in \r\nGaza in December 2008 and January 2009 was a \r\ndeliberate assault aimed at punishing, humiliating and \r\nterrorizing a civilian population. \r\n That Israeli military offensive is further described \r\nin the report issued by the Special Committee to \r\nInvestigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human \r\nRights of the Palestinian People and other Arabs of the \r\nOccupied Territories in document A/64/339. Not only \r\ndoes the report show that over 3,000 private homes \r\nwere destroyed during the conflict, but also that over \r\n20,000 other homes, hospitals, schools, universities, \r\nfactories, businesses and mosques were damaged. \r\n Israel is further extending or complicating some \r\nof the final status issues. It continues to extend its \r\nillegal settlement activity in the West Bank. Contrary \r\nto all expectations, Israel has failed to commit to its \r\nobligation under the road map to freeze all settlement \r\nconstruction, including natural growth, and to \r\ndismantle outposts erected since March 2001. \r\n And in East Jerusalem, Israel has continued with \r\nthe odious policy of evicting Palestinians from their \r\nhomes and demolishing those structures. The \r\nsettlements are the greatest obstacles to the \r\nestablishment of a physically viable, sovereign and \r\nindependent Palestinian State, and thus, to the \r\nachievement of peace. \r\n Similarly, Israel has also continued with its \r\nconstruction of the separation wall, despite the \r\n2004 advisory opinion of the International Court of \r\nJustice. It has also continued restricting Palestinian \r\naccess to East Jerusalem, social services and \r\nagricultural land. \r\n Furthermore, the insensitive and reckless recent \r\nattacks against Palestinian worshippers and other \r\ncivilians at the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Al-Haram al-\r\nSharif compound in East Jerusalem, which are \r\ncondemnable, can only further complicate the road to \r\npeace.  \r\n While the international community is today \r\nexpressing its solidarity with Palestinians, we call upon \r\nall nations to go beyond mere expressions of goodwill \r\nand take action. Indonesia stands ready to fully support \r\nPalestinian independence and the resumption of the \r\npeace process in the region. Without doubt, the events \r\nall over the occupied territories in the past year show \r\nthat, unless concerted, determined and just action is \r\ntaken, peace will not be achieved in the near future. \r\nIndonesia therefore strongly supports a just and \r\ncomprehensive resolution to the conflict. We wish to \r\nreaffirm our support for a two-State solution that \r\nenvisions the creation of an independent, democratic \r\nand viable Palestinian State living side by side in peace \r\nand security with Israel and its other neighbours. \r\n A/64/PV.51\r\n \r\n21 09-62352 \r\n \r\n Before concluding, I should like to take this \r\nopportunity to express the gratitude of my delegation \r\nto the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable \r\nRights of the Palestinian People for its tireless and \r\nconsistent implementation of its mandate. \r\n We also express our deep recognition to and \r\nappreciation of the Department of Public Information \r\nfor its work in pursuing a strong and effective public \r\ninformation programme to raise awareness among the \r\ninternational community on this issue, as well as on the \r\nsituation in the Middle East. \r\n Mr. Núñez Mosquera (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nCuba supports the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of Egypt on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement. This meeting is an appropriate occasion for \r\nthe international community to reaffirm its support for \r\nthe heroic efforts of the Palestinian people in their \r\nstruggle to exercise their inalienable right to self-\r\ndetermination and, furthermore, to express its \r\ncommitment to stepping up efforts to attain a \r\ncomprehensive solution to the Palestinian question in \r\nall its aspects. \r\n Cuba reiterates its solidarity with the Palestinian \r\npeople and condemns the continued illegal occupation \r\nof their land by Israel, which is the principal obstacle \r\nto a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in the whole \r\nregion. \r\n Over the past year, the situation in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territories, including East Jerusalem, has \r\ncontinued to deteriorate. Israel continued to violate \r\ninternational law and international humanitarian law. \r\nSince the military aggression carried out by Israel in \r\nGaza, there has been an alarming increase across the \r\nwhole of the occupied Palestinian territories, and in the \r\nbesieged Gaza Strip in particular, in the number of \r\ncasualties as well as of injured, displaced, homeless \r\nand impoverished persons, unable to meet their basic \r\nneeds. \r\n The human damage caused by the aggressor has \r\nbeen irreparable. The report of the United Nations \r\nFact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict \r\n(A/HRC/12/48), better known as the Goldstone report, \r\nand the results of the Secretary-General’s Board of \r\nInquiry lay out the situation in a vivid and graphic way. \r\nNonetheless, the perpetrators of these barbarous acts \r\ncontinue to go unpunished, enjoying impunity that is \r\nonly possible owing to the protection that Israel \r\nreceives from the superPower, which continues to \r\nsupply Israel with the financial resources and arms that \r\nsustain its policy of aggression. \r\n Unfortunately, the Security Council continues to \r\nbe unable to adequately address the situation in \r\nPalestine as it should in order to find a fair and \r\nimpartial solution to this longstanding conflict. This is \r\na result of the habitual application of double standards \r\nand of the use, or threat of the use, of the veto on the \r\npart of the superPower on any draft resolution aimed at \r\nthis objective. \r\n Israel continues to severely limit the freedom of \r\nmovement of Palestinians, imposing a humiliating and \r\ndiscriminatory network of hundreds of checkpoints, in \r\nparticular in the Gaza Strip. It continues the unjust and \r\ninhumane blockage against Gaza inhabitants, its policy \r\nof border-crossing closures, the imposition of physical \r\nbarriers on roads used by Palestinians, as well as the \r\nlimitation of the movement of persons and goods such \r\nas food, medicine, fuel and other essential \r\nhumanitarian supplies. \r\n Post-war reconstruction work in Gaza has not yet \r\nbegun because of the intransigence of the Israeli \r\nGovernment. Cuba condemns this aggressive policy, \r\nwhich ignores the repeated calls by the international \r\ncommunity and the successive resolutions adopted by \r\nvarious bodies of the United Nations, in clear violation \r\nof international law, and we insist that Israel \r\nimmediately lift the Gaza blockade. \r\n Israel continues to build barriers throughout the \r\noccupied Palestinian territory, thus fragmenting and \r\nprofoundly undermining the contiguity and integrity of \r\nthe territory, totally isolating East Jerusalem from the \r\nrest of the West Bank and causing great damage to \r\nPalestinian society and the Palestinian economy. \r\n The occupying Power continues its intensive \r\ncolonization activities, such as the ongoing practice of \r\nconfiscating large tracts of land, the construction and \r\nextension of Israeli settlements and the construction of \r\nthe wall. The settlement policy aimed at altering the \r\ndemographic composition, character and nature of the \r\nPalestinian lands, annexing them de facto by means of \r\nconfiscating large areas of Palestinian territory, have \r\nbeen accelerated to an unprecedented rate. This \r\nsituation has been intensified in the West Bank in \r\nparticular. The most recent example is the \r\nannouncement of the construction of 900 new settler \r\nhomes south of Jerusalem. The continuation of those \r\nA/64/PV.51  \r\n \r\n09-62352 22 \r\n \r\nsettlement activities endangers the realization of a \r\nnegotiated two-State solution. \r\n Cuba condemns those policies and practices, \r\nwhich violate international law, including the Fourth \r\nGeneva Convention, United Nations resolutions and \r\nthe advisory opinion issued on 9 July 2004 by the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, and we insist that Israel \r\nimmediately end all of these illegal practices. \r\n On this occasion, as we are gathered here to \r\nconsider the Palestinian question, which goes back \r\nmore than 60 years now, Cuba reaffirms its support for \r\nthe just cause of the Palestinian people and for their \r\nefforts to realize their legitimate national aspirations. \r\nCuba will continue to support the Palestinian people in \r\ntheir fight to end the Israeli occupation, which began in \r\n1967, as well as in the search for a just, peaceful and \r\nlasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that \r\nwill allow the Palestinian people to exercise their \r\ninalienable rights, including the right to self-\r\ndetermination and sovereignty in an independent State \r\nwithin the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its \r\ncapital. \r\n Mr. Al-Jarman (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in \r\nArabic): At the outset, I should like to thank the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly for having \r\nconvened this important meeting, which the General \r\nAssembly organizes every year in conjunction with the \r\nworld’s celebration of the International Day of \r\nSolidarity with the Palestinian People to renew the \r\ncommitment and support of the international \r\ncommunity for the efforts made by the Palestinian \r\npeople towards exercising their inalienable rights to \r\ndetermine their destiny, attain independence and \r\nfreedom, and return to their homeland. \r\n I wish also to seize this opportunity to express \r\nmy country’s appreciation of and support for the efforts \r\nmade by the Committee on the Exercise of the \r\nInalienable Rights of the Palestinian People and its \r\nChairman, Ambassador Paul Badji. \r\n Today, the international community recalls the \r\n61 years of suffering, misery and deprivation of the \r\nPalestinian people, which started in 1948 with Israel’s \r\noccupation of their land and continues to this very day \r\nowing to Israel’s serious and repeated violations of \r\ninternational law and human rights. Such human \r\nsuffering, which the Palestinian people have endured \r\ncollectively and individually, has continued for years \r\nbefore the eyes of the world.  \r\n The Palestinian people — more than half of \r\nwhom live in exile or are in refugee camps and are \r\ndeprived of their most basic rights, including their \r\nlegitimate right to return to their homeland and live in \r\npeace with their neighbours, like other peoples — are \r\nvery disappointed today at the many unfulfilled \r\npromises regarding achieving their aspirations for \r\nfreedom, independence and self-determination, in \r\naccordance with international law and resolutions of \r\ninternational legitimacy. Their disappointment has \r\nespecially increased with the growing hostile policies \r\nof the present Israeli Government, which follows an \r\nintensive plan for the illegal confiscation of more \r\nPalestinian lands and properties, expansion of illegal \r\nsettlements and the building of the separation wall in \r\nthe occupied Palestinian cities and villages, \r\nparticularly in Jerusalem and its surroundings, with a \r\nview to changing the demographic composition of East \r\nJerusalem and its legal structure and Arab identity in \r\norder to create a new reality on the ground that would \r\nlead to a new interruption of negotiations with the \r\nPalestinian Authority. \r\n The United Arab Emirates, which expresses its \r\ngrave concern at the continued deterioration of the \r\nalready desperate and dangerous situation in the \r\noccupied Palestinian territory, including East \r\nJerusalem, condemns Israel’s policies and its \r\naggressive and countless violations of international \r\nlaw, including international humanitarian law and \r\nhuman rights law, and its total impunity for the war \r\ncrimes and crimes against humanity committed in \r\nGaza. The United Arab Emirates also condemns the \r\ncontinued collective punishment measures imposed by \r\nIsrael on Gaza, including the frequent closures.  \r\n The United Arab Emirates reiterates the \r\nimportance of maintaining the integrity of the \r\nPalestinian territory as one contiguous political entity \r\nin the West Bank and Gaza under the Palestinian \r\nAuthority and also welcomes efforts in that regard by \r\nthe Arab Republic of Egypt to achieve Palestinian \r\nreconciliation and accord. The United Arab Emirates \r\ndemands that the international community — \r\nrepresented by the United Nations, including the \r\nSecurity Council and other agencies of the \r\nOrganization, each within its own field of competence, \r\nas well as the members of the Quartet — increase \r\neffective efforts and put further political and economic \r\npressures on Israel to cease its aggression and \r\nsettlement building and renounce its current hard-line \r\n A/64/PV.51\r\n \r\n23 09-62352 \r\n \r\npolitical positions and comply with the international \r\ndemands that it correct the unlawful present reality it \r\nhas created in the occupied Palestinian territories, \r\nespecially in East Jerusalem.  \r\n Israel should stop immediately, permanently and \r\nunconditionally, under international oversight, all its \r\npresent settlement activities and remove what is \r\nalready built, including the separation wall in the West \r\nBank and around Jerusalem, in compliance with \r\nrelevant international laws and the advisory opinion of \r\nthe International Court of Justice. We further demand \r\nthat Israel be compelled to lift all restrictions on \r\nmovement and passage, re-open the crossings in Gaza \r\nand the Palestinian Authority institutions in occupied \r\nEast Jerusalem, and release all the Palestinian \r\nprisoners, in compliance with its commitments to \r\ninternational law and international humanitarian law, in \r\nparticular the Fourth Geneva Convention. That will \r\nlead to a final, permanent and just settlement to all \r\naspects of the Palestinian question, including a just \r\nsettlement to the issues of Palestinian refugees, \r\nJerusalem and the final demarcation of the borders of \r\nthe two States, Israel and Palestine, according to the \r\nprovisions of the road map, the Annapolis Conference \r\nunderstandings, Security Council resolutions \r\n242 (1967) and 338 (1973), all relevant General \r\nAssembly resolutions, in particular 181 (II) and \r\n194 (III), the Madrid principles and the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative, which calls for the unconditional complete \r\nwithdrawal of Israel from the Palestinian territories.  \r\n In that context, we renew our demand to \r\nimplement the recommendations of the report of the \r\nUnited Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza \r\nConflict (A/HRC/12/48), identify those responsible for \r\nwar crimes and crimes against humanity committed in \r\nthe Gaza Strip and bring them to justice, and prevent \r\nthe continuation of impunity, in compliance with \r\nAssembly resolution 64/10. \r\n The United Arab Emirates believes that the Arab-\r\nIsraeli conflict, which continues to dominate all other \r\nissues in the Middle East, is the root of the tension, \r\nviolence and persistent instability in the region. We \r\nrenew today our commitment to the choice of peace \r\nwith the rest of the Arab countries, based on \r\nimplementation of the principles of international \r\nlegitimacy and the principle of land for peace. We \r\nstress that establishing permanent, just and \r\ncomprehensive peace and security in the region is \r\nconditional on the sincerity of the international \r\ncommunity in showing a genuine and earnest political \r\nwill to put an end to Israel’s aggression and \r\nintransigence, to revive the peace process and to ensure \r\na complete withdrawal of Israel from all Palestinian \r\nand Arab territories occupied since 1967, including \r\nEast Jerusalem, the Syrian Golan and the Sheba’a \r\nfarms and the village of Al-Ghajar in Lebanon. \r\n We hope that our deliberations on this item will \r\ncontribute to strengthening the important, major role \r\nthat the United Nations plays in reaching a settlement \r\nfor the Palestinian problem and the situation in the \r\nMiddle East, in accordance with the Charter. We urge \r\nthe international community, especially the donor \r\ncountries and parties, to increase political, moral and \r\nfinancial support to the Palestinian people so as to \r\nalleviate their exacerbated humanitarian crisis until the \r\njust realization of their rights and the fulfilment of \r\ntheir aspirations to freedom, independence and the \r\nestablishment of their State of Palestine as a viable \r\nindependent State, on the basis of the two-State \r\nsolution. \r\n Mr. Al-Saadi (Yemen) (spoke in Arabic): This \r\nInternational Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian \r\nPeople has political, humanitarian and ethical \r\nsignificance for our Organization, which for over half a \r\ncentury has especially championed the struggles of \r\noppressed peoples and their right to resist occupation. \r\nOur celebration of this occasion confirms the \r\nlegitimacy of the Palestinian people’s struggle to resist \r\noccupation and its right to establish its independent \r\nState on its national soil, with Jerusalem as its capital.  \r\n The situation of the Palestinians in the occupied \r\nterritories is a tragedy because of the killings, \r\ngenocide, State terrorism, displacement policies, the \r\nbuilding of the separation wall, the ongoing building of \r\nillegal settlements, the blockade of Gaza and the \r\ninfliction of collective punishment. All that \r\ncontravenes international law, the Fourth Geneva \r\nConvention and relevant General Assembly and \r\nSecurity Council resolutions. Those aggressive and \r\ndangerous practices aim at killing the peace process \r\nand the efforts of the international Quartet, which are \r\nsupported by the international community. That \r\nescalation can lead to real dangers which might push \r\nthe region to violence and terrorism, with very \r\ndangerous repercussions for the stability of the region \r\nand for international peace and security. \r\nA/64/PV.51  \r\n \r\n09-62352 24 \r\n \r\n My delegation expresses its deep concern at the \r\naggressive policies with which Israel is challenging the \r\ninternational community, at its rejection of all relevant \r\nSecurity Council resolutions, including resolutions \r\n242 (1967) and 338 (1973), at its disregard of all \r\nappeals and calls by the countries of the world, and at \r\nits negative response to international initiatives, \r\nincluding the Arab Peace Initiative submitted by King \r\nAbdullah Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, King of sisterly \r\nSaudi Arabia — the initiative that provided a political \r\nframework for peace in the region.  \r\n My delegation calls on the United Nations and \r\nthe international community to shoulder their \r\nresponsibilities to guarantee the rights of the \r\nPalestinian people and force Israel to stop its policies \r\nof violence and State terrorism, compel it to respond \r\npositively to international and regional agreements, \r\ninitiatives and resolutions relevant to the peace \r\nprocess, and make it reach comprehensive and just \r\nsolutions leading to the establishment of an \r\nindependent Palestinian State in the territories \r\noccupied since 4 June 1967, with Jerusalem as its \r\ncapital.  \r\n We would like to renew the call on Israel to \r\nwithdraw from all occupied Arab territories and return \r\nthe occupied Syrian Golan to Syrian sovereignty. We \r\nalso call on Israel to resume negotiations with Syria, \r\nwith the expectation that Israel will respect its previous \r\ncommitments. Such negotiations cannot succeed in \r\nachieving peace unless Israel respects what has already \r\nbeen agreed with the Syrian side and unless it \r\nwithdraws from the occupied Lebanese lands.  \r\n We support here the recommendations and \r\nconclusions of the Committee on the Exercise of the \r\nInalienable Rights of the Palestinian People. We also \r\nwish to reiterate the need for the Security Council to \r\nimplement the advisory opinion of the International \r\nCourt of Justice and Assembly resolution ES-10/15, \r\nwhich calls on Israel to stop building the separation \r\nwall. Furthermore, we call on the Security Council to \r\nconsider imposing sanctions on Israel if it continues to \r\nignore its international legal commitments.  \r\n My country supports the exercise of the \r\ninalienable rights of the Palestinian people in its \r\nstruggle to achieve independence and establish its \r\nindependent State. \r\n Mr. Faqeeh (Saudi Arabia) (spoke in \r\nArabic): The delegation of Saudi Arabia is honoured to \r\nbe able to thank both the President of the General \r\nAssembly and the Secretary-General for their efforts to \r\nhold this meeting to discuss agenda item 16 on the \r\nquestion of Palestine under the present circumstances \r\nand changes that threaten international peace and \r\nsecurity.  \r\n My delegation would like to express its concern \r\nabout the deteriorating situation in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territory and the grave threats to our \r\nbrethren in Palestine. Since the onset of aggression \r\nagainst Gaza at the end of 2008 and at the beginning of \r\n2009, the negative effects and repercussions have \r\ncontinued, not only with regard to the security of \r\nPalestinians but for the security, peace and well-being \r\nof the entire world.  \r\n Whatever the complexity of details and \r\ndifferences in interests and positions with respect to the \r\nquestion of Palestine, the solutions must meet one sole \r\ncriterion — namely, comprehensive compliance with \r\ninternational legitimacy, international law and \r\ninternational justice that allows no exception, double \r\nstandard or selectivity. Any departure from that \r\ninclusive criterion, whatever justification might be \r\nused, would lead to the deterioration of the situation \r\nand would have a grave negative impact on our ability \r\nto effectively address the list of problems and crises we \r\nface with respect to the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security.  \r\n Compliance with international legitimacy is the \r\neasiest, best and most effective way to resolve the \r\nArab-Israeli conflict, which is truly the gravest threat \r\nto peace and security in the Middle East, which in turn \r\nis a strategic region whose situation has broad effects \r\non the entire world. That conflict could never have \r\ncontinued for over seven decades with such tragic \r\neffects were it not for the deviation from the principles \r\nof international legitimacy, the norms of international \r\nlaw and the requirements of international justice.  \r\n The Arab world, including the State of Palestine, \r\nhas done its best to achieve a true and lasting peace. \r\nThe Arab Peace Initiative is still continuing and \r\nprovides an offer to end the conflict with Israel and to \r\nenter into a peace agreement that would provide \r\nsecurity, recognition and normal relations for all \r\ncountries of the region. It embodies the Arab \r\ncommitment to peace as a strategic option and is \r\nconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations.  \r\n A/64/PV.51\r\n \r\n25 09-62352 \r\n \r\n All initiatives and international efforts and \r\nsolutions in this respect are still facing a wall of \r\nrejection, manipulation, procrastination and delaying \r\ntactics by Israel, which continues to take unilateral \r\nmeasures in violation of international law and of the \r\nresolutions of the Security Council. Instead of making \r\na true effort to achieve peace, Israel continues daily to \r\nsubjugate and oppress the Palestinian people, building \r\nsettlements, walls and bypass roads that contradict \r\ninternational legitimacy and create new realities on the \r\nground.  \r\n It is the building of settlements that changes the \r\ngeography and demography of the Palestinian \r\nterritories, especially in Jerusalem and its surrounding \r\nareas, in clear violation of international law and all \r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions. Those \r\nsettlements undermine most of the major cities in the \r\nWest Bank, consuming more than half of its resources, \r\nincluding water resources.  \r\n Despite our presence here in this General \r\nAssembly meeting, where we are expressing hope and \r\noptimism with regard to reaching tangible results, and \r\ndespite all the commendable efforts made by the \r\nUnited States and the Quartet, no actual results have \r\nbeen achieved.  \r\n If all the interest of the international community, \r\nall this unanimity and all of those international efforts \r\nare still unable to push Israel to fulfil its obligations \r\nunder the road map, how can we be optimistic? The \r\nprotection of human rights in Palestine should be given \r\npriority in the agenda of the United Nations through \r\nthe rule of law and the dissemination of the culture of \r\npeace and dialogue between civilizations and peoples, \r\nwhich are basic elements in any effective strategy \r\nseeking to achieve a comprehensive and just peace \r\nbetween the Palestinians and the Israelis and to reject \r\nviolence and extremism.  \r\n The Arab-Israeli conflict, which has been going \r\non for over six decades, has dominated all issues in the \r\nMiddle East. It has led to more extremism and \r\nterrorism, and it seriously impedes development and \r\nreform in a region that should play a cultural role \r\ninstead of being submerged in a conflict that depletes \r\nits resources and capabilities. \r\n All Arab countries reconfirm their commitment to \r\na just and comprehensive peace based on international \r\nlegitimacy. Those countries are still waiting for the \r\nsame serious commitment by Israel. In that context, \r\npartial solutions do not support current negotiations \r\nbetween the two sides aimed at reaching a lasting and \r\ncomprehensive solution. The peace process requires \r\nIsrael to immediately stop building settlements in the \r\noccupied Palestinian territories because Israel’s \r\ncontinued settlement activities are an obstacle to \r\nnegotiations.  \r\n The peace process is based on a good idea, but it \r\nrequires more communications and contacts between \r\nour peoples. We have understood that we need to have \r\nour Arab Peace Initiative reach the Israeli people easily \r\nand quickly. Affecting public opinion can lead to \r\npeace. We should intelligently and wisely use the \r\navailable mass media to create channels of \r\ncommunication and structures that enable us as leaders, \r\nGovernments and civil society to create the appropriate \r\nconditions for the peace that we seek. \r\n International dialogue has come to focus on \r\nhumanitarian issues as we see it now at the United \r\nNations and in other forums such as the 2008 World \r\nConference on Dialogue held in Madrid and other \r\ndialogues on religions and cultures. Those efforts all \r\nwork towards enriching peaceful coexistence among \r\nsocieties and peoples as the optimal means of relating \r\nto one another and as the main way to relieve tensions, \r\nconflicts and divisions. \r\n The investigation of the events in Gaza at the end \r\nof last year and into January of this year, presented in \r\nthe Goldstone report to the Human Rights Council \r\n(A/HRC/12/48), proved that Israel has committed war \r\ncrimes and crimes against humanity. In that war, \r\n1,400 Palestinians, mostly women and children, were \r\nkilled, thousands of Palestinians were wounded, and \r\nIsrael even attacked United Nations facilities in Gaza. \r\nThose who tried to flee were brutally killed. Israel also \r\naggressively attacked holy sites. Such aggressive \r\npractices have made peace absent from the region. \r\n Israel has also conducted two destructive wars \r\nagainst Lebanon and has besieged Gaza, and it is still \r\noccupying the Syrian Golan. It used excessive force in \r\nboth cases, including internationally banned weapons, \r\nin violation of international humanitarian law. The \r\nreport of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on \r\nthe Gaza Conflict testifies to that. The head of that \r\nMission stated that Israel violated international \r\nhumanitarian law and human rights law, and those \r\nviolations amount to war crimes and probably crimes \r\nagainst humanity. \r\nA/64/PV.51  \r\n \r\n09-62352 26 \r\n \r\n Saudi Arabia is deeply concerned by the \r\ncontinued Israeli blockade of Gaza, which undermines \r\nthe rights of the Palestinians and causes deterioration \r\nof their living conditions. In addition to that, Israel has \r\nimposed a blockade on East Jerusalem that has \r\nprevented people from accessing their homes and \r\nplaces of worship. \r\n Israel’s practices against Islamic holy places are \r\ndaily aggressions against the defenceless Palestinian \r\npeople. The flagrant Israeli attacks on the Al-Aqsa \r\nMosque will undoubtedly have a serious direct effect \r\non international peace and security. In that context, my \r\nGovernment calls on the international community to \r\nstand against those flagrant aggressions and to support \r\nthe Goldstone report and the recommendations \r\ncontained therein to prevent the reoccurrence of such \r\ncrimes. \r\n This year, contrary to past years, the international \r\nhandling of the Middle East crisis took a different track \r\nand occupied a prominent place on the international \r\nagenda. We optimistically welcome that. However, at \r\nthe same time we see that despite the action of the \r\nUnited States and its new Administration and of other \r\nmembers of the Security Council, as well as of the \r\nEuropean Union, the Organization of the Islamic \r\nConference and the Non-Aligned Movement, Israel \r\nstill acts in contravention of the most basic principles \r\nof the peace process and so defies the will and policies \r\nof its allies and friends and the majority, if not all, of \r\nthe international community. Thus, Israel shows its true \r\nface, perpetuating its systemic aggression, racism, \r\nexpansionism and rejection of peace in defiance of all \r\nthose calling for it. \r\n Israel refuses to freeze settlement activity even \r\nthough it is illegal under international law. It continues \r\nconfiscating Palestinian land, building the separation \r\nwall, trying to judaize Jerusalem and to expel \r\nPalestinian people from their homes. I could continue \r\nthe list, but it would take a long time to provide all \r\ndetails and statistics. Israel rejects the two-State \r\nsolution, which is supported by the international \r\ncommunity, and what its Prime Minister has said was \r\njust a manoeuvre and a formality that contradicts the \r\npolicies of his Government and does not reflect \r\nrealities on the ground. \r\n In conclusion, Saudi Arabia reaffirms that peace \r\nand occupation are mutually exclusive and that our \r\nstrategic option is a just and comprehensive peace \r\nbased on implementation of Security Council \r\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), the Madrid \r\nterms of reference, the principle of land for peace and \r\nthe Arab Peace Initiative. \r\n We therefore support all efforts to reach a \r\ncomprehensive regional peace. The lack of genuine \r\npolitical will for peace on the part of the Israeli \r\nGovernment and its aggressive war against Gaza closed \r\nall doors to those efforts. We are still hopeful and \r\nconfident, however, that the United Nations and peace-\r\nloving nations and peoples can lead us to peace, \r\nstability, cooperation and prosperity for all. \r\n  The meeting rose at 6.10 p.m. \r\n"
