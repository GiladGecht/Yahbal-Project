(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 7 (continued) \r\n \r\nOrganization of work, adoption of the agenda and \r\nallocation of items \r\n \r\n  Second report of the General Committee \r\n(A/64/250/Add.1) \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): In paragraph  \r\n1 (a) of its report (A/64/250/Add.1), the General \r\nCommittee decided to recommend to the General \r\nAssembly that an additional item entitled “Observer \r\nstatus for the Parliamentary Assembly of the \r\nMediterranean in the General Assembly” be included in \r\nthe agenda of the current session under heading I, \r\n“Organizational, administrative and other matters”. \r\n May I take it that the General Assembly decides \r\nto include this item in the agenda of the current session \r\nunder heading I? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): In paragraph  \r\n1 (b), the General Committee further recommends that \r\nthe item be allocated to the Sixth Committee. May I \r\ntake it that the General Assembly decides to allocate \r\nthis item to the Sixth Committee? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I should like to \r\ninform members that the item entitled “Observer status \r\nfor the Parliamentary Assembly of the Mediterranean \r\nin the General Assembly” becomes item 169 on the \r\nagenda of the current session. \r\n The Chairman of the Sixth Committee will be \r\ninformed of the decision just taken by the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n In paragraph 3 (a) of the report, the General \r\nCommittee recommends to the General Assembly that \r\nan additional item entitled “United Nations University” \r\nbe included in the agenda of the current session under \r\nheading B, “Promotion of sustained economic growth \r\nand sustainable development in accordance with the \r\nrelevant resolutions of the General Assembly and \r\nrecent United Nations conferences”. \r\n May I take it that the General Assembly decides \r\nto include this item in the agenda of the current session \r\nunder heading B? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): In paragraph  \r\n3 (b), the General Committee further recommends that \r\nthe item be allocated to the Second Committee. May I \r\ntake it that the General Assembly decides to allocate \r\nthis item to the Second Committee? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I should like to \r\ninform members that the item entitled “United Nations \r\nUniversity” becomes item 170 on the agenda of the \r\ncurrent session. \r\nA/64/PV.52  \r\n \r\n09-62559 2 \r\n \r\n The Chairman of the Second Committee will be \r\ninformed of the decision just taken by the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n In paragraph 4 (a) of the report, the General \r\nCommittee recommends to the General Assembly that \r\nan additional item entitled “Observer status in the \r\nGeneral Assembly for the Council of Presidents of the \r\nGeneral Assembly” be included in the agenda of the \r\ncurrent session under heading I, “Organizational, \r\nadministrative and other matters”.  \r\n May I take it that the General Assembly decides \r\nto include this item in the agenda of the current session \r\nunder heading I?  \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): In paragraph  \r\n4 (b), the General Committee further recommends that \r\nthe item be allocated to the Sixth Committee. May I \r\ntake it that the General Assembly decides to allocate \r\nthis item to the Sixth Committee? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I should like to \r\ninform members that the item entitled “Observer status \r\nin the General Assembly for the Council of Presidents \r\nof the General Assembly” becomes item 171 on the \r\nagenda of the current session. \r\n In light of the decisions just taken by the \r\nAssembly, may I take it that the Assembly also decides \r\nto extend the work of the Sixth Committee to \r\nspecifically consider agenda items 169 and 171, which \r\nhave been allocated to that Committee? \r\n It was so decided.  \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The Chairman \r\nof the Sixth Committee will be informed of the \r\ndecisions just taken by the General Assembly. \r\n In paragraph 5, the General Committee decided to \r\nrecommend to the General Assembly that the item \r\nentitled “Question of the Comorian island of Mayotte” \r\nbe included in the agenda of the current session under \r\nheading A, “Maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity”, on the understanding that there would be no \r\nconsideration of this item by the General Assembly \r\nuntil further notice. \r\n May I take it that the General Assembly decides \r\nto include this item in the agenda of the current session \r\nunder heading A, on the understanding that there would \r\nbe no consideration of this item by the General \r\nAssembly until further notice? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I should like to \r\ninform members that the item entitled “Question of the \r\nComorian island of Mayotte” becomes item 172 on the \r\nagenda of the current session. \r\n The General Assembly has thus concluded its \r\nconsideration of the second report of the General \r\nCommittee. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 16 (continued) \r\n \r\nQuestion of Palestine \r\n \r\n  Report of the Committee on the Exercise  \r\nof the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian \r\nPeople (A/64/35) \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/64/351) \r\n \r\n  Draft resolutions (A/64/L.20, A/64/L.21, \r\nA/64/L.22 and A/64/L.23) \r\n \r\n Mr. Haroon (Pakistan): Yesterday, a great voice \r\nfor the Palestinian people, Mr. Walid Khalidi, spoke at \r\nthe United Nations. His lament reminded me of that \r\nother great Palestinian, Edward Saïd, and hearing \r\nKhalidi I thought it appropriate to remember Saïd and \r\nto give thanks to God that his voice continues.  \r\n A lot of people might be unhappy that the voice \r\nof Palestine as echoed by these great people is still \r\nbeing heard in the halls of the United Nations, and \r\ntoday that lament carries forward in items 15 and 16 as \r\na stark reminder of the protracted suffering, desolation \r\nand dispossession of the Palestinian people and their \r\ncontinuing ordeal and oppression under occupation. A \r\nlot of people seem to ask: “What good does this annual \r\nlament make”? To them I say, “If you listen closely \r\nenough, the lament is asking not for retribution but for \r\nlasting peace”. That is the essential matter in this \r\nlament.  \r\n And is it a difficult task for the people who \r\nbelieve in one God? Palestinians and Jews believe in \r\nAbraham; both believe in Moses. Is it all that difficult \r\nto reach the promised land together and to unite? I do \r\nnot think so. I think that today we must commend the \r\nCommittee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of \r\nthe Palestinian People for the very compact case and \r\nposition they have put before us here. I would \r\n A/64/PV.52\r\n \r\n3 09-62559 \r\n \r\nspecifically like to mention the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Senegal and the Rapporteur of the \r\nCommittee, the Permanent Representative of Malta, for \r\ntheir invaluable contributions.  \r\n Today’s important debate coincides with the \r\nobservance of the International Day of Solidarity with \r\nthe Palestinian People. It is therefore a propitious \r\noccasion to reaffirm our commitment to the legitimate \r\nstruggle of the Palestinian people and to remind the \r\nworld of their inalienable rights.  \r\n For the past six decades, the peaceful settlement \r\nof the question of Palestine has remained one of the \r\nmajor challenges for the international community. Let \r\nus put on record that we are now entering the seventh \r\ndecade of our collective failure — I repeat, our \r\ncollective failure — to meet this challenge. It is indeed \r\na sad record for the United Nations. From Oslo in 1993 \r\nto Annapolis in 2007, matters do not seem to have \r\nbecome more encouraging. On the other hand, the \r\nserious deterioration of living conditions in the \r\noccupied territories has seen no reversal. The impunity \r\nand defiance of the international community are \r\ninflicting a mortal blow both to the proponents of the \r\npeace process and, more important, to the living \r\nconditions of human beings under forceful occupation. \r\n From among these trends, the worsening \r\nhumanitarian situation in the occupied territories is a \r\nmatter of more serious concern to my delegation. As \r\nacknowledged in various United Nations reports, the \r\nclosure of Gaza’s borders to the free flow of people \r\nand commerce is strangulating the local economy. \r\nPublic services and human security stand threatened. \r\nConstruction of the separation wall replicates the \r\nsituation in the West Bank. \r\n Elsewhere in the occupied territories, settlement \r\nactivity by Israel is compounding the conflict. We note \r\nwith great concern a finding that, even this year, over \r\n755 square metres of further territory — and this may \r\nsound miniscule, but it is the principle of it that  \r\nmatters — has been added to the settlements in the \r\nWest Bank alone. This becomes, slowly and steadily, \r\nan encroachment that does not want to go away. The \r\nsettlement activity in and around East Jerusalem and \r\nthe inexplicable and irrational occupation of the Syrian \r\nGolan, together with provocative excavation around \r\nsites holy to Muslims, Christians and Jews, are only \r\nwidening the dimensions of this conflict. The \r\nconstruction of 900 housing units in Gilo, south of East \r\nJerusalem, has the potential to further ignite the \r\nprevailing tensions in the region. \r\n The incessant culture of impunity vitiates trust \r\nand confidence, which are prerequisite to any viable \r\npeace process. Confidence cannot be built in the face \r\nof actions involving the use of force, human rights \r\nviolations, discrimination, checkpoints, permits and \r\nblockades of entire populations, resulting in social and \r\neconomic strangulation. The collective punishment of \r\nthe Palestinian people is the worst example of all. \r\nIsrael must seriously reconsider its actions and harsh \r\nmeasures, not just for the sake of the besieged \r\nPalestinian people and the peace process, but also for \r\nits own security concerns and the peace of the world \r\nthat it antagonizes with utter disdain for humanity. \r\n While we see little reason for optimism for a \r\nsustainable peace process in the near future, complete \r\ndesperation and hopelessness must be avoided because \r\nthey create violence. It is our hope that the parties \r\nconcerned will undertake immediate and credible \r\nconfidence-building measures aimed at improving the \r\noverall environment and making it conducive to a \r\nnegotiation process. For this, it is imperative for the \r\ninternational community to re-engage on this issue and \r\nto revive the momentum for a renewed peace process. \r\n During the Security Council debate of  \r\n14 October, I outlined four parameters for such a  \r\nre-engagement (see S/PV.6201). I shall now repeat \r\nthem. First, the Security Council should take a lead in \r\nthe international community’s re-engagement. Its \r\nmember States must show the political will to achieve \r\nreal progress on peace and security in the Middle East \r\nbased on relevant resolutions of the Security Council \r\nas well as the Madrid terms of reference, the Road \r\nMap, the Arab Peace Initiative and the understanding \r\nreached in Annapolis in 2007.  \r\n Secondly, the Middle East Quartet must utilize \r\nthe full potential of its statement of 24 September 2009 \r\nin support of the peace process through a transparent \r\nand objective engagement.  \r\n Thirdly, there is a pressing urgency to address the \r\nhumanitarian plight in the Palestinian territories and to \r\nrebuild the Palestinian institutions battered by conflict \r\nand violence. Likewise, we must support the efforts to \r\nachieve further cohesion among the Palestinian people.  \r\n Fourthly, to achieve a lasting settlement to the \r\nArab-Israeli conflict, it is imperative to address its root \r\nA/64/PV.52  \r\n \r\n09-62559 4 \r\n \r\ncause — the Israeli occupation of the Arab territories. \r\nThe solution therefore requires Israel’s complete \r\nwithdrawal from the occupied Palestinian territory, \r\nincluding East Jerusalem, and all other occupied Arab \r\nterritories, including the Syrian Golan and South \r\nLebanon. Israel should also immediately cease all \r\nsettlement activities. Also crucial to this equation \r\nwould be parallel progress on the Syria-Israel and \r\nLebanon-Israel tracks in order to achieve \r\ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East — peace \r\nbeing the most important aspect of the rendition of this \r\nspeech today. \r\n Having said that, let us make life a little easier. \r\nComing in, I met a very wise, old Arab dignitary, and I \r\nsaid to him, “Why do we not take one point and begin \r\nfrom there?” And he turned around and said, “There is \r\na very easy solution. Let us just freeze the settlements \r\nimmediately and opt for peace”. This is a very \r\nsimplistic but very profound piece of advice. Let Israel \r\ngrasp the bull by its horns. Let it not falter at this \r\nmoment. This is the time to grasp what should be a \r\ntenable peace.  \r\n The people of all races and religions in the \r\nMiddle East have suffered for too long. Over the past \r\n60 years, many generations have completed their \r\nrespective life cycles in the perverse shadows of \r\npoverty, inane violence and life-threatening insecurity. \r\nOnly our firm, joint resolve, concerted action and, \r\nabove all, the political will to build a lasting peace can \r\nsave succeeding generations of the region from the \r\ntragedies and tribulations of their ill-fated heritage and \r\nfrom the repetition of the senseless, blood-soaked \r\nhistory of their predecessors. \r\n I should like to conclude by quoting John Milton. \r\nIn the face of perversity and the fall from paradise, he \r\nwrites in the first book of Paradise Lost that “All is not \r\nlost; the unconquerable Will”. That is what the United \r\nNations needs: an unconquerable will. \r\n Mr. Alrowaiei (Bahrain) (spoke in Arabic): My \r\ndelegation should like to extend its thanks to \r\nAmbassador Paul Badji, Chairman of the Committee \r\non the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the \r\nPalestinian People. We should also like to thank all the \r\nother members of the Committee for their efforts in \r\npreparing the Committee’s thirty-fifth report (A/64/35) \r\nbefore us, which contains valuable information on the \r\ngrave deterioration of the situation in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territories. We also highly appreciate their \r\nefforts in carrying out their tasks aimed at enabling the \r\nPalestinian people to exercise their inalienable rights as \r\nenshrined in the relevant General Assembly and \r\nSecurity Council resolutions, which have echoed in \r\nthis Hall a thousand times. \r\n We should also like to thank the Department of \r\nPublic Information for its effective role in highlighting \r\nissues relevant to the question of Palestine and for \r\norganizing activities within its Special Information \r\nProgramme on the Question of Palestine in order to \r\nraise awareness of this issue among the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n Yesterday, in a letter addressed by King Hamad \r\nbin Issa Al Khalifa of the Kingdom of Bahrain to \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the Chairman of \r\nthe Committee, Mr. Paul Badji, on the International \r\nDay of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, His \r\nMajesty called upon the international community to \r\nshoulder its responsibilities with respect to the future \r\nof the Palestinian people and to help them attain their \r\ninalienable rights to self-determination and establish \r\ntheir independent State on their national soil, with \r\nJerusalem as its capital. \r\n His Majesty also called upon Israel and the \r\nPalestinian Authority to pursue peaceful efforts to \r\nreach a just and comprehensive peace agreement, in \r\naccordance with the Annapolis Joint Understanding \r\nand proceedings within the international framework on \r\nthis issue, foremost among which are United Nations \r\nresolutions, the Arab Peace Initiative and the Road \r\nMap. \r\n He also stressed the need for the international \r\ncommunity to take a firm position in genuine solidarity \r\nwith the Palestinian people and to help them realize \r\ntheir legitimate national rights by offering them \r\npolitical and financial support for pursuing serious \r\nnegotiations aimed at reaching a final settlement of this \r\npending issue. \r\n He also stressed that, this year, the International \r\nDay of Solidarity with the Palestinian People comes at \r\na time when the Palestinian people are suffering most. \r\nThe greatest testimony to this was the report prepared \r\nby Judge Richard Goldstone this year (A/HCR/12/48), \r\nwhich laid bare to the international community the \r\npersecution and oppression of the Palestinian people at \r\nthe hands of the occupying Israeli forces. It reaffirmed \r\nthe absolute necessity for the international community \r\n A/64/PV.52\r\n \r\n5 09-62559 \r\n \r\nto provide international protection to the Palestinian \r\npeople under Israeli occupation. \r\n That letter also stresses Bahrain’s firm position \r\nwith regard to the Palestinian issue in two particular \r\naspects: first, in standing with the brotherly Palestinian \r\npeople against that historic injustice, embodied in the \r\nworst forms of occupation, wanton aggression, forced \r\nemigration, killing and blockade; and secondly, in \r\nreaching a peaceful international settlement of the \r\nissue, based on the well-known international terms of \r\nreference.  \r\n I need not dwell on the daily deterioration of the \r\nsituation of the occupied Palestinian people due to \r\nIsrael’s ongoing policies of subjecting them to \r\nhumiliation and siege, in particular in the Gaza Strip, \r\nand of continuing to build the separation wall in clear \r\nviolation of the advisory opinion of the International \r\nCourt of Justice, international law and international \r\nhumanitarian law. The latest events in Gaza are only \r\none more atrocious link in a chain of aggression \r\nperpetrated by Israel, in which it has deliberately \r\ndestroyed Palestinian infrastructure and United Nations \r\nfacilities, killed men, women and the elderly, used \r\ninternationally prohibited weapons, and deprived \r\nPalestinians of the most basic necessities of life under \r\nthe eyes of the international community.  \r\n Only a political process can bring about a \r\npeaceful settlement that guarantees the Palestinian \r\npeople the enjoyment of all its inalienable rights. It \r\nwould also ensure that the Israeli people enjoy peace \r\nand security within internationally recognized borders, \r\nliving side by side with their neighbour in peace. That \r\nis Bahrain’s particular appeal at this time and always \r\nhas been. \r\n In conclusion, we agree with the view expressed \r\nin the report of the Secretary-General (A/64/351) that \r\nthe time has come for Israel to fundamentally change \r\nits policies in that regard. The observance of the \r\nInternational Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian \r\nPeople represents recognition of the international \r\ncommunity’s particular responsibility to remediate the \r\nhistoric injustice and inequity done to the Palestinian \r\npeople. It also requires us to assist that people in \r\nattaining their inalienable rights, including the right to \r\nself-determination and to establish their independent \r\nState on their national soil, with Jerusalem as the \r\ncapital. \r\n Mr. Al Habib (Islamic Republic of Iran): At the \r\noutset, on the occasion of the International Day of \r\nSolidarity with the Palestinian People, I wish to \r\nexpress our solidarity with the people of Palestine in \r\ntheir tireless efforts and unwavering determination to \r\npursue their national aspirations and in their \r\ncourageous struggle to defend and exercise their \r\ninalienable rights. \r\n The recent United Nations reports on the question \r\nof Palestine, particularly the report of the Committee \r\non the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the \r\nPalestinian People, contained in document A/64/35, \r\nonce again bear witness to the unfortunate reality that, \r\nin the period under consideration, the Israeli regime \r\nhas continued with its crimes against the defenceless \r\nPalestinian people. It has been systematically altering \r\nthe demography and the historical and cultural heritage \r\nof the Palestinian land through unlawful policies and \r\npractices, thus inflicting unspeakable suffering and \r\nlosses on the Palestinian people, including the recent \r\ncarnage in Gaza that resulted in the deaths and injury \r\nof hundreds of innocent Palestinians and an \r\nunprecedented humanitarian crisis in that area. \r\n Despite the International Court of Justice’s \r\nadvisory opinion and the strong condemnation of the \r\ninternational community, illegal settlements are \r\nexpanding much faster than before and more and more \r\nPalestinian houses are being demolished. The recent \r\nillegal decision of the Israeli regime to build 900 new \r\nhousing units is a move undoubtedly orchestrated to \r\nalter the demographic composition and character of the \r\nPalestinian territories, particularly in Jerusalem and its \r\nsurrounding areas. \r\n The Israeli regime has also persisted in its \r\naggressive and expansionist policies towards Lebanon \r\nand the occupied Syrian Golan. The illegitimate regime \r\ncontinues to violate the most basic principles of \r\ninternational law, international humanitarian and \r\nhuman rights law and the United Nations Charter, and \r\ncontinues its defiance of numerous resolutions of \r\ndifferent United Nations bodies. Those crimes are \r\nundoubtedly among the most serious and gross \r\nviolations of United Nations resolutions, especially \r\nthose of the Security Council, and therefore must be \r\ndealt with urgently and appropriately by the Council \r\nand other United Nations bodies in a resolute and \r\ndecisive manner. \r\nA/64/PV.52  \r\n \r\n09-62559 6 \r\n \r\n In that regard, we welcome the adoption of \r\nresolution 64/10 on 5 November on the follow-up to \r\nthe report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission \r\non the Gaza Conflict. That resolution needs to be \r\nseriously followed up by the relevant United Nations \r\norgans, in particular the Security Council, in order to \r\nbring to justice the Israeli perpetrators of the crimes so \r\nvividly authenticated in the Goldstone report \r\n(A/HRC/12/48) and to put an end to the culture of \r\nimpunity and above-the-law behaviour. If criminals are \r\npunished, room for criminal acts by those who possess \r\nthe motives and means to commit them will be \r\nrestricted. Impunity for the perpetrators of serious \r\ncrimes is itself a cause of and an incentive to further \r\ncrimes. \r\n Unfortunately, the Security Council’s debate on \r\nthe Goldstone report in October (see S/PV.6201) did \r\nnot result in the expected conclusion. We believe that \r\nany action to appease the Israeli regime or to divert the \r\nattention of the international community from the root \r\ncauses of the issue of Palestine, including the \r\npolitically motivated manoeuvres in the Council during \r\nits debate on Gaza, amounts to defending State \r\nterrorism, injustice and oppression, as well as the \r\nrecent 22-day massacre of hundreds of Palestinian \r\nmen, women and children. \r\n Since the question of Palestine is the international \r\ncommunity’s most urgent problem, finding a solution \r\nto that issue is of the highest priority. Over 60 years \r\nhave passed since the occupation of Palestine. During \r\nall those years, the Israeli regime has benefited from \r\nall material means of power, including financial aid, \r\nweapons and technology, as well as the political and \r\ndiplomatic support of some Western countries, \r\nincluding their giant monopolized empire of news \r\nmedia and networks. Yet, despite that staggering \r\nsupport, not only have those countries failed to solve \r\nthe problem of the Israeli regime’s illegitimacy, but the \r\ncomplex issue of Palestine has grown more \r\ncomplicated with time. In the past, there have been \r\nmany solutions on the table, but none has been \r\nsuccessful because, first, they were based on denying, \r\nin one way or another, the legitimate rights of the \r\nPalestinian people, and, secondly, because of the \r\nintransigence of the Israeli regime in failing to abide \r\nby its commitments and international norms and \r\nregulations. \r\n There is no doubt that attaining a peaceful and \r\njust settlement of the question of Palestine is \r\nimperative to the realization of a comprehensive and \r\nlasting peace and stability in the Middle East and \r\nbeyond. Aggression, State terrorism, intimidation, \r\noccupation, the setting up of new illegal settlements \r\nand the construction of the separation wall will not \r\nbring peace to the Middle East. In our view, a lasting \r\npeace in Palestine and the region will be possible only \r\nby establishing justice and putting an end to \r\ndiscrimination and the occupation of Palestine and \r\nother occupied Arab territories. \r\n Today, in commemoration of the International \r\nDay of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, we need \r\nto act collectively to demonstrate our unqualified \r\nsupport for the Palestinian cause, and to rally to assist \r\nthose who have been deprived of their inalienable \r\nrights. The reconstruction of Gaza is one of Palestine’s \r\nmost urgent needs, requiring our strong political will \r\nand immediate collective action. We have a common \r\nduty and responsibility to offer multifaceted support to \r\nthe Palestinians in Gaza. The Government of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran has done its share to \r\nfinancially assist the Palestinians in order to alleviate \r\ntheir suffering in the humanitarian sphere. \r\n My delegation would like to reiterate our \r\nproposal for a durable solution to the Palestinian \r\nproblem. Our proposal is a solution that is in total \r\nsympathy with democratic values and has a basis in \r\ncommon logic. Based on our proposal, all those who \r\nhave a legitimate stake in the territory of Palestine, \r\nincluding Muslims, Christians and Jews, should choose \r\ntheir own system of Government in a general \r\nreferendum. All Palestinians who have for years \r\nendured the ordeals of exile should also be allowed to \r\ntake part in the referendum. For true believers in peace \r\nand democracy, this is the only just, comprehensive \r\nand democratic solution to this long-lasting problem in \r\nthe Middle East. \r\n Finally, I wish to express our appreciation to the \r\nChairman and the members of the Committee on the \r\nExercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian \r\nPeople for their tireless efforts to address the torment \r\nand onerous situation of the people of Palestine and for \r\nthe informative report they have presented to us. \r\n Mr. Kohona (Sri Lanka): I wish to express the \r\nsincere appreciation of my delegation to the Committee \r\non the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the \r\nPalestinian People for its report contained in document \r\nA/64/35. We would also like to thank the Chairman of \r\n A/64/PV.52\r\n \r\n7 09-62559 \r\n \r\nthe Committee, Ambassador Paul Badji of Senegal, for \r\nhis comprehensive statement on the Committee’s work. \r\n Sri Lanka has consistently extended its steadfast \r\nsupport to the Palestinian people in the pursuit of their \r\ninalienable rights, including the right to statehood. This \r\nhas been a matter persistently advocated by our \r\nPresident, His Excellency Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa, \r\nover the past 40 years. I would like to seek the \r\nAssembly’s indulgence and quote the message he has \r\nsent to mark this year’s observance of the International \r\nDay of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, which \r\nreads as follows. \r\n  “On the solemn occasion marking the \r\nInternational Day of Solidarity with the \r\nPalestinian people, on behalf of the people and \r\nthe Government of Sri Lanka, I take this \r\nopportunity to reiterate our unequivocal and \r\nsincere support for the people and the \r\nGovernment of Palestine for their just struggle to \r\nachieve their inalienable rights, including the \r\nright to statehood. \r\n  “We remain deeply concerned about the \r\nwidespread suffering and hardships the \r\nPalestinian people continue to undergo and the \r\ngrave situation in the Occupied Palestinian \r\nTerritory. We welcome the new efforts and \r\ncommitments by the international community to \r\nreinvigorate the peace process. However, we are \r\ndisappointed that no tangible results have been \r\nachieved towards the two-State solution and the \r\nrealization of the inalienable rights of the \r\nPalestinian people. \r\n  “On this commemorative Day of Solidarity, \r\nI wish to recall my association with the cause of \r\nthe Palestinian people for nearly 40 years, during \r\nwhich I have advocated the recognition of the \r\ninalienable rights of the Palestinian people and a \r\nviable solution to the conflict. I sincerely hope \r\nthat all peace initiatives that have as their main \r\nobjective the realization of a two-State solution \r\nand the renewed efforts of the international \r\ncommunity will enable the speedy creation of a \r\nPalestinian State coexisting with Israel in peace, \r\nharmony and prosperity.” \r\n The Palestinian people have suffered for too long \r\nand have lived under occupation. The denial of their \r\nfundamental right to statehood due to the continued \r\nIsraeli occupation has seriously affected the  \r\nsocio-economic well-being of the Palestinian \r\npopulation in Gaza and the West Bank, including East \r\nJerusalem. We believe it is imperative to fully \r\nimplement the relevant Security Council resolutions, \r\nand those adopted by the Assembly, to achieve a just, \r\nlasting and comprehensive solution to the Middle East \r\nand Palestinian questions. The principle of land for \r\npeace, the Road Map and the Arab Peace Initiative are \r\nimportant milestones in the process of achieving a \r\npermanent two-State solution. \r\n For peace to be viable and sustainable in the \r\nPalestinian territory, Israel must withdraw from all the \r\nPalestinian territories back to the 1967 borders. It must \r\nend the economic blockade and siege of the Gaza Strip. \r\nThe illegal expansion of settlements and the \r\ncontinuation of the construction of the separation wall, \r\nchanging the demographic and geographic character of \r\nthe Palestinian territory, can only increase tensions and \r\nanimosities between the two parties to the conflict. The \r\nPalestinian Authority needs to continue implementing \r\nits security plan and to make every effort at its disposal \r\nto improve law and order. \r\n Sri Lanka wishes to reiterate its support for the \r\nPalestinian Authority under the leadership of President \r\nMahmoud Abbas. We stress the need to preserve and \r\nprotect the national and democratic institutions that are \r\nvital to a future independent Palestinian State. We \r\ntherefore urge the Palestinian groups to act speedily to \r\nreconcile and unite within the framework of the \r\nlegitimate Palestinian Authority. Unity among \r\nPalestinian people is their strength. In this regard, we \r\ncommend the initiative of Egypt to promote a dialogue \r\namong the parties concerned in order to restore \r\nPalestinian national unity. \r\n Serious efforts must be made for the early \r\nresumption of negotiations by the two sides, with the \r\nobjective of reaching a final agreement, to enable both \r\nthe people of Israel and the people of Palestine to live \r\nside by side, securely and within recognized \r\nboundaries. In this regard, it is important that both \r\nparties abide by their previous agreements and \r\nobligations and take concrete steps to consolidate \r\nconfidence. \r\n In conclusion, permit me to convey our \r\nappreciation to the United Nations Relief and Works \r\nAgency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East \r\n(UNRWA), which has played a vital role in providing \r\nessential humanitarian relief and development \r\nA/64/PV.52  \r\n \r\n09-62559 8 \r\n \r\nassistance to the Palestinian population for 60 years. \r\nThe work carried out by UNRWA under difficult \r\nconditions is commendable. We also extend our good \r\nwishes to the outgoing Commissioner-General,  \r\nMs. Karen AbuZayd, who has contributed tirelessly to \r\nthis worthy cause during her tenure. \r\n Ms. Shalev (Israel): “Thirty-three for. Thirteen \r\nagainst. Ten abstentions. The resolution is approved.”  \r\nThose were the words at Lake Success on  \r\n29 November 1947 that announced the General \r\nAssembly’s adoption of resolution 181 (II). Those were \r\nthe words that conferred international legitimacy on the \r\ncreation of two States for two peoples: “Thirty-three \r\nfor. Thirteen against. Ten abstentions. The resolution is \r\napproved.” \r\n The Jewish population in then-British-Mandate \r\nPalestine accepted that historic resolution. It reflected \r\nthe Zionist conviction that it was both necessary and \r\npossible to live in peace with our neighbours in the \r\nland of our forefathers. Yet the Arab side within the \r\nMandate territory and across the region instantly \r\nrejected resolution 181 (II), and Egypt, Saudi Arabia, \r\nSyria, Iraq and Lebanon — Members of the United \r\nNations — launched a war of annihilation against \r\nIsrael together with Jordan and the Arabs of Palestine. \r\n As a result of that rejection and that war, many \r\nPalestinian Arabs became refugees, while a similar \r\nnumber of Jews who lived in Arab countries were \r\nforced to flee their homes, and they, too, became \r\nrefugees. They all — Jews and Arabs — lived in \r\nrefugee camps, torn away from their homes. \r\n The difference between the two distinct refugee \r\npopulations was — and still is — that Israel has done \r\nits utmost to redeem these Jewish refugees from their \r\nmisery and to absorb them successfully in Israel, \r\nwhereas the belligerent Arab States did not lift a finger \r\nto redeem their brethren. To wage war? Yes, by all \r\nmeans. To help in redeeming and resettling, let alone \r\nabsorbing their brethren: that is another matter \r\naltogether. \r\n Today, the Arabs’ historic mistake of rejecting \r\nresolution 181 (II) is also measured in lives lost in war, \r\nparents who bury their children and pain that has \r\ntouched us all, Israelis and Arabs. But Israel will not \r\nlet the pain that we all have suffered turn into hate. It \r\nwill not diminish Israel’s desire for peace. For history \r\nshows that peace can be achieved in the Middle East, \r\nsuch as through the historic peace treaties with Egypt \r\nand Jordan. How can it be, then, that the debate in \r\nthese halls embraces a one-sided narrative that \r\npromotes and maintains an obsessive and \r\ncondemnatory focus on Israel? \r\n Today’s debate undermines the endorsement of \r\nthe two-State solution. It reflects the reality of an \r\nautomatic majority that ensures that any debate on the \r\nsituation in the Middle East will be fruitless, \r\ndestructive, cynical and hateful. Peace will require a \r\nnew direction. It will require truthfulness and courage. \r\n And so I ask our Palestinian neighbours whether \r\nor not we both possess the courage to transform \r\nourselves from soldiers of war into soldiers of peace. \r\nDo the Arab States have the courage not only to speak \r\nabout peace, but to engage with Israel in a serious \r\npolitical and economic manner? Do those in our region \r\nhave the courage to say publicly that Israel is the \r\nlegitimate nation-State of the Jewish people? Do the \r\nmembers of this body have the courage to confront \r\nHamas and Hizbullah and all those for whom there is \r\nno two-State solution? \r\n Israel, for its part, will choose the path of peace \r\nover the course of conflict. Thus, a few days ago, the \r\nGovernment of Israel announced a policy of settlement \r\nrestraint, a policy that includes the suspension of new \r\npermits and new construction in the West Bank for a \r\nperiod of 10 months. This unprecedented step reflects \r\nthree simple realities: first, that Israel wants to reenter \r\ninto negotiations with the Palestinians; secondly, that \r\nIsrael is not only talking about peace but is taking \r\npainful and effective steps towards it; and, thirdly, that \r\nIsrael is serious about its intention to pursue peace. \r\n Israel wishes to reach a historic peace agreement, \r\nand will discuss peace at any time, anywhere and \r\nwithout preconditions. We wish to hear the Palestinian \r\nAuthority say the same: that it, too, will discuss peace \r\nat any time, anywhere and without preconditions. Only \r\nthrough negotiations between the parties can we solve \r\nthe conflict in a complete and comprehensive fashion. \r\n We are now witnessing efforts to use the Security \r\nCouncil or the General Assembly to promote unilateral \r\ndeclarations. Like the rejection of resolution 181 (II), \r\nthis could turn into another historic mistake. Such \r\ndeclarations erode the foundations of peace and create \r\ninstead a situation that will destroy the hope for \r\nbilateral negotiations. \r\n A/64/PV.52\r\n \r\n9 09-62559 \r\n \r\n We must also confront the most dangerous threat \r\nto peace in our region, namely Iran. Iran continues to \r\nexport violence, hatred and terrorism to our region and \r\nbeyond. The 360 tons of weapons aboard the Francop \r\nwere merely a drop in the ocean. Iran funds, trains and \r\nsupports global terrorism, including the relentless \r\nattacks by Hamas and Hizbullah against Israeli men, \r\nwomen and children. Iran must be stopped. \r\n As our region stands at a critical juncture, this \r\nbody can choose between two paths. It can indulge in \r\nthe hatred of yesterday. It can mourn the rejection of \r\nresolution 181 (II). It can even promote and applaud \r\nfutile unilateral affirmations. It can turn a blind eye to \r\nterrorists and their sponsors and justify their repugnant \r\ntactics and deadly consequences. Or it can recognize \r\nthat the only way towards peace is through bilateral \r\nnegotiations. It can then celebrate 29 November as a \r\njoint day of peace for two States, living honourably, \r\nside by side. For us, there is no other way. \r\n Mr. Manjeev Singh Puri (India): At the outset, \r\nMr. President, allow me to express our appreciation to \r\nyou for having convened this discussion on the \r\nquestion of Palestine in the General Assembly as we \r\nmark the International Day of Solidarity with the \r\nPalestinian People. Our appreciation goes also to \r\nAmbassador Paul Badji and the Committee on the \r\nExercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian \r\nPeople.  \r\n India has long-standing social and cultural ties \r\nwith the entire region of the Middle East and a strong \r\ntradition of support for the Palestinian cause. We voted \r\nin support of the Human Rights Council resolution on \r\nthe United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza \r\nConflict, as well as General Assembly resolution \r\n64/10. We believe that the conflict in West Asia is \r\nessentially political and cannot be resolved by force. \r\nWe favour a negotiated solution wherein a sovereign, \r\nindependent, viable and united State of Palestine can \r\nlive within secure and recognized borders, side by side \r\nand at peace with Israel, as endorsed in the Quartet \r\nRoad Map and Security Council resolutions 1397 \r\n(2002) and 1515 (2003). This is in line with our \r\nsupport for Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) \r\nand 338 (1973) as well. India also participated in the \r\nAnnapolis Conference in 2007. \r\n The Arab Peace Initiative calls for the withdrawal \r\nof Israel to pre-1967 borders, the recognition of Israel \r\nand the establishment of the State of Palestine with \r\nEast Jerusalem as its capital. India has supported that \r\nplan. We have also called for an end to Israeli \r\nsettlements in the occupied Palestinian territories and \r\nthe easing of restrictions, at an early date, of the \r\nmovement of goods and persons within Palestine. \r\n India has always stood by the Palestinian people \r\nin their pursuit of their legitimate goals and their \r\nefforts aimed at economic and social development with \r\ndignity and self-reliance. Towards that end, India has \r\nbeen doing what it can to extend development support \r\nto Palestine. In New Delhi, we have completed the \r\nPalestinian Chancery building as a gift from the \r\nGovernment of India and an enduring symbol of our \r\nsolidarity with the people of Palestine. \r\n Mindful of the deteriorating humanitarian \r\nsituation, India contributed $1 million in response to \r\nthe flash appeals of the United Nations Relief and \r\nWorks Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East \r\n(UNRWA) following the conflict in Gaza in late 2008-\r\nearly 2009. \r\n In this sixtieth anniversary year of the \r\nestablishment of UNRWA, we have increased our \r\ncontributions to that agency. India has, furthermore, \r\ncontributed $10 million in budget support to the \r\nPalestinian National Authority after the International \r\nConference in Support of the Palestinian Economy for \r\nthe Reconstruction of Gaza, held in Sharm el-Sheikh in \r\nMarch 2009. \r\n We have also participated in various donor \r\nconferences, including those in Paris, Jakarta and \r\nSharm el-Sheikh, and have expeditiously implemented \r\nour pledges. \r\n Instability and violence, coupled with \r\nhumanitarian issues in Palestine, have impacted upon \r\nthe broader situation in the Middle East and beyond. \r\nThere can be little doubt that the situation in Palestine \r\nremains a matter of grave concern to the international \r\ncommunity, and there is a need for all stakeholders to \r\ncome together and create an environment for the \r\nearliest possible resumption of dialogue in the Middle \r\nEast peace process. \r\n The Prime Minister of India, Mr. Manmohan \r\nSingh, in his message on the occasion of the \r\nInternational Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian \r\nPeople, reiterated that concerted and inclusive action is \r\nnecessary to reinvigorate the peace process with the \r\nobjective of achieving a durable, comprehensive and \r\nA/64/PV.52  \r\n \r\n09-62559 10 \r\n \r\njust settlement. We remain convinced that lasting peace \r\nin the region will contribute to global stability and \r\nprosperity. \r\n Mr. Chekkori (Morocco) (spoke in Arabic): We \r\nmet yesterday to celebrate the International Day of \r\nSolidarity with the Palestinian People, which serves to \r\nremind us that compliance with United Nations \r\nresolutions on the Palestinian question is necessary so \r\nthat the Palestinians can enjoy their right to self-\r\ndetermination and their own State. \r\n The Palestinian people are resilient despite the \r\nchallenges they face, but they have suffered now for \r\nmore than six decades. They continue to be courageous \r\nin asking here and in other international forums for the \r\nrespect of commitments and promises made so many \r\ntimes over that we have come to regard the rays of \r\nhope they provided as mere mirages. \r\n We would like to pay tribute to the steadfast \r\nPalestinian people who have undergone trials and, in \r\nspite of all those years of difficulties and all those \r\nyears of displacement, imprisonment, killing and an \r\noverwhelming daily situation, have maintained that ray \r\nof hope. And every time someone would want to snuff \r\nit out, soft winds fan its flames for a better day \r\ntomorrow so that the Palestinians can live in their own \r\nterritory and in peace and security. \r\n We fully align ourselves with the statements \r\nmade by Egypt on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement and Syria on behalf of the Islamic \r\nConference of Foreign Ministers. We would like to \r\nstress, notwithstanding, the following main points. \r\n Before doing that, however, we would like to \r\nthank you, Mr. President, for having convened this \r\nmeeting to consider recent developments on the \r\nquestion of Palestine. \r\n We would also like to express our appreciation to \r\nHis Excellency Ambassador Paul Badji for the efforts \r\nhe has made at the head of the Committee on the \r\nExercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian \r\nPeople. \r\n I also wish to commend the work and efforts \r\nmade by the Division for Palestinian Rights of the \r\nSecretariat, as well as the special programme in the \r\nDepartment of Public Information. We are grateful for \r\nits many activities, in particular its daily update of \r\ndevelopments in the situation. \r\n Last September, we celebrated the sixtieth \r\nanniversary of the United Nations Works and Relief \r\nAgency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East \r\n(UNRWA). Here, we wish to commend and express our \r\ngratitude to the continuous and valuable efforts that \r\nhave been made by UNRWA to reduce the suffering of \r\nmore than 4.5 million Palestinians in the occupied \r\nterritories and in the surrounding countries. \r\n As she leaves her post, we commend Ms. Karen \r\nKoning AbuZayd on all the work she has done for the \r\npast nine years while at the head of UNRWA and all of \r\nthe valuable achievements of her work on behalf of the \r\nPalestinian people. \r\n We are meeting here to discuss the question of \r\nPalestine in the present session. Our assessment of \r\nwhat has happened recently forces us to conclude that \r\nthere is a clear contradiction between the efforts of the \r\ninternational community to relaunch the negotiations, \r\non the one hand, and the very serious developments on \r\nthe ground, on the other. \r\n Even though the international community had \r\nhoped that the Annapolis arrangements would lead to \r\nprogress, Israel, for its part, has continued its collective \r\npunishment policy, its settlement activities and its \r\nexpropriation of Arab property, which is then given to \r\nIsraeli settlers.  \r\n In that context and a few days after a meeting on \r\nthe subject by the General Assembly, the Israeli forces \r\nlaunched an attack against Gaza that killed more than \r\n1,400 Palestinians and wounded 5,000 others, \r\nincluding women, children and the elderly. The Israeli \r\nforces did not spare homes, schools, mosques or \r\nhospitals treating the ill and wounded. After the \r\ndeclaration of the ceasefire and following the adoption \r\nof Security Council resolution 1860 (2009), a number \r\nof reports were produced. Those reports clearly \r\nrevealed the scope of the crimes committed by the \r\nIsraeli forces during their aggression in Gaza, where \r\nthe most fundamental international humanitarian and \r\nhuman rights norms were violated. \r\n We were first made aware of a summary of the \r\nreport of the Commission of Inquiry that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral had dispatched from United Nations \r\nHeadquarters to investigate nine incidents involving \r\nUnited Nations facilities that led to deaths and injuries. \r\nThis detailed summary of extremely serious events \r\noffers but a small selection of the terrible, widespread \r\nactions that are given specific attention in the report of \r\n A/64/PV.52\r\n \r\n11 09-62559 \r\n \r\nthe United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza \r\nConflict (A/HRC/12/48), some recommendations of \r\nwhich were adopted by the General Assembly on  \r\n5 November.  \r\n Another report was published in September, but it \r\ndid not receive as much coverage as the two others. \r\nThe report, entitled “Environmental Assessment of the \r\nGaza Strip following the escalation of hostilities in \r\nDecember 2008-January 2009” and published by the \r\nUnited Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), \r\naddresses the consequences of the acts of war \r\ncommitted in the Gaza Strip, in particular the pollution \r\nof its already deteriorating environment, economy and \r\nliving conditions. Among the conclusions of the UNEP \r\nreport, which was prepared by international experts — \r\nincluding Israelis and Palestinians — was that, if the \r\ninternational community did not intervene, the \r\nconsequences would last not merely for years, but for \r\ncenturies. The scarcity of water resources could \r\njeopardize the security of the population if minimal \r\nsanitary needs are not met. \r\n The international community had hoped that after \r\nthe ceasefire declaration, in keeping with Security \r\nCouncil resolution 1860 (2009), Israel would stop \r\nthese practices and end its policy of collective \r\npunishment of the Palestinian people, while at the same \r\ntime halt its imposition of facts on the ground and its \r\nincremental seizure of Palestinian land. Unfortunately, \r\nIsrael has in fact done the opposite, continuing its \r\nillegal settlement activity on the West Bank, including \r\nin East Jerusalem, and has grabbed more Arab property \r\nand land. It has chased Palestinians from their \r\nneighbourhoods to enable settlers to move in. Israel has \r\nalso continued building the separation wall, \r\nfragmenting the Arab presence.  \r\n All these activities seek to alter the city’s \r\ndemographics and character. Israel has continued to \r\nattack the city’s holy sites, undermining the Al-Aqsa \r\nmosque through excavations and tunnels beneath and \r\naround it, offering worthless justifications in an effort \r\nto mask its repeated attempts to violate freedom of \r\nworship at the mosque and the right of worshippers to \r\naccess holy sites in safety and unconditionally. All of \r\nthese excesses and policies flagrantly violate \r\ninternational legal decisions, the provisions of \r\ninternational law and the religious sensitivities of all \r\nfaiths. \r\n Our Kingdom and His Majesty Mohammed VI, \r\nChairman of the Al Quds Committee, express our grave \r\nconcern about these practices and activities, which \r\nseek to change the specifically Arab and Islamic nature \r\nof the holy city of Jerusalem, and we condemn them. \r\nMotivated by that sense of responsibility, and given \r\nthat the city is of particular importance in the Arab-\r\nIsraeli conflict, His Majesty has tirelessly sought to \r\ndraw the attention of the United Nations, world Powers \r\nand religious leaders, in particular the Pope, to the \r\ndangers posed by these illegal, unilateral Israeli \r\nactions. In the face of activities that threaten the \r\nstability and security of the region, he has also urged \r\nthem to shoulder their responsibilities and to help \r\npreserve the special character of Jerusalem, in \r\naccordance with General Assembly and Security \r\nCouncil resolutions and earlier commitments \r\nundertaken by the parties. \r\n Finally, the Kingdom of Morocco firmly \r\ncondemns the decision of the Israeli Government to \r\nissue permits for 900 new units to be built in East \r\nJerusalem; this is illegal and completely unacceptable. \r\nWe also note the illicit and illegal nature of all Israeli \r\nsettlement and construction activity in the West Bank. \r\nMoreover, Jerusalem must under no pretext be made \r\nthe subject of an exemption. Given the suffering \r\nendured daily by the Arab population of the holy city, \r\nthe Al Quds Committee of the Organization of the \r\nIslamic Conference continues to offer support by \r\nundertaking social projects and creating social \r\nfacilities managed by the Bayt-Mal-Al-Quds Agency.  \r\n The most recent meeting of the Al Quds \r\nCommittee and the Yasser Arafat Institute, held on 28 \r\nand 29 October, affirmed that it was urgent that the \r\ninternational community end the illegal and immoral \r\nIsraeli offences against Jerusalem and its places of \r\nworship. The meeting also called on Israel to respect \r\nfreedom of religion and worship on the basis of the \r\nprinciple that Jerusalem is an inherent part of the \r\noccupied Palestinian territories, as set forth in the \r\nprovisions of international law and the Fourth Geneva \r\nConvention. Participants also called for the freedom of \r\nworship and holy sites to be respected and for greater \r\ntolerance and a strengthened spirit of coexistence.  \r\n In view of the importance of Al-Quds to the Arab \r\nand Islamic world, an important international meeting \r\nwill be held at the Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah \r\nUniversity in Fez, Morocco, from 11 to 13 December \r\nto celebrate Jerusalem as the 2009 capital of Arab \r\nA/64/PV.52  \r\n \r\n09-62559 12 \r\n \r\nculture. That international forum, to be held under the \r\ntheme “Al-Quds in Arab and International Thought”, \r\nwill address various issues, highlighting the important \r\nof Jerusalem and the Al-Aqsa mosque in Arab and \r\nMuslim consciousness, as well as the consequences of \r\nIsraeli settlement for the city, its history and human \r\nheritage. The meeting will also focus on Palestinian \r\nculture in the context of occupation and the \r\npreservation of the Palestinian identity. \r\n Our deep concern about the serious recent events \r\nin Palestine and the threat they pose to stability and \r\nsecurity in the Middle East is accompanied by our firm \r\nand lasting belief that the peace process is an \r\nirrevocable choice and that its outcome will establish a \r\njust and comprehensive peace in the region, to the \r\nbenefit of all its peoples, and thereby ensure their \r\nsecurity and the restoration of their rights. On the basis \r\nof the Arab Peace Initiative, the Kingdom of Morocco \r\nis committed to the Middle East peace process and, as \r\na member of the implementation committee, \r\nparticipates in all international efforts aimed at the \r\neffective resumption of negotiations. \r\n In that respect, the Kingdom of Morocco \r\nwelcomes the efforts of President Obama to overcome \r\nthe obstacles to the peace process and hopes that he \r\nwill sustain them until the desired objective is \r\nachieved. We also commend the efforts of the \r\ninternational community, in particular the European \r\nUnion, and hope that they will lead to the resumption \r\nof negotiations based on the relevant General \r\nAssembly and Security Council resolutions, the Madrid \r\nterms of reference, the agreements and understandings \r\nbetween the parties, and the Arab Peace Initiative — a \r\ncourageous undertaking that reflects the Arab desire to \r\nachieve a fair and comprehensive solution to the \r\nconflict in the Middle East. That being said, the \r\nInitiative will be strengthened by the unity of the \r\nPalestinian people and by progress in meeting their \r\ncommitments to the terms of the Quartet Road Map.  \r\n The Kingdom of Morocco reiterates once again \r\nits support for President Abbas because of his wisdom, \r\nhis leadership and his pioneering role until the \r\nPalestinian dream — an independent, viable State with \r\nEast Jerusalem as its capital, living side by side with \r\nIsrael in peace and security — is realized. In that \r\nregard, a comprehensive just and lasting peace in the \r\nMiddle East will be possible only when Syria has \r\nregained sovereignty over the occupied Golan and \r\nwhen Lebanon has recovered every centimetre of its \r\nland. \r\n Mr. Ali (Malaysia): My delegation first wishes to \r\nalign itself with the statements delivered by the \r\nrepresentatives of Egypt and Syria on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement and the Organization of the \r\nIslamic Conference, respectively. \r\n Sixty-two years ago, the General Assembly \r\nadopted resolution 181 (II), proposing the partitioning \r\nof Palestine into two independent States, one Jewish \r\nand one Arab. However, to date, only one State has \r\ncome into being. This is a situation that has resulted in \r\nthe loss of many lives and whose effect reverberates \r\nnot only in the Middle East, but worldwide. We must \r\ntherefore undertake urgent, decisive action to bring \r\norder and stability to the region and to restart the peace \r\nprocess leading to a comprehensive and just solution. \r\nIn so doing, we can give effect to what was provided \r\nfor in resolution 181 (II). \r\n It is apparent that the root cause of this problem \r\nis the illegal occupation by Israel of Palestinian, \r\nLebanese and Syrian territories. The problems have \r\nbeen compounded throughout the decades by Israel’s \r\nactions and intransigence in the following areas: first, \r\natrocities committed by Israel in Gaza, which \r\ncontravene the Geneva Conventions; secondly, lack of \r\npolitical commitment to follow through in the \r\nsuccessive peace processes; thirdly, continuation and \r\nexpansion of illegal settlement activities in the West \r\nBank, including East Jerusalem, as well as the recent \r\nIsraeli Government approval of the construction of 900 \r\nnew settlement housing units in the settlement of Gilo, \r\nwhich is located on the south side of East Jerusalem; \r\nfourthly, forced evictions of the Palestinian people, \r\ndemolition of homes and confiscation of Palestinian \r\nlands, including through the building of the separation \r\nwall, which continues to be built despite the advisory \r\nopinion of the International Court of Justice. Such \r\nunlawful actions could alter the demographic \r\ncomposition, status and nature of East Jerusalem. They \r\nalso negatively affect the territorial contiguity of the \r\nPalestinian territories, as well as the social fabric of the \r\nPalestinian people, in violation of international law; \r\nfifthly, imposition of measures that constitute a form of \r\ncollective punishment, as is strictly forbidden under \r\ninternational humanitarian law. Such measures include \r\nthe blockade of Gaza, which has restricted the passage \r\nof essential goods and construction materials to the \r\nvulnerable groups, the establishment of hundreds of \r\n A/64/PV.52\r\n \r\n13 09-62559 \r\n \r\ncheckpoints and roadblocks, the permit system as well \r\nas other obstacles that have violated the Palestinians’ \r\nright to freedom of movement. \r\n The attacks on Palestinians by extremist Israeli \r\nsettlers at the Islamic holy sites of Al-Haram Al-Sharif \r\nand Al-Aqsa mosque are further acts of impunity \r\nmanifested by the Israeli regime in the occupied \r\nterritories. We are alarmed at the increasing incidents \r\nof illegal acts of violence and attacks by Israeli settlers \r\nagainst Palestinians without much action by the Israeli \r\nauthorities to stop or to hinder their occurrence. Such \r\nprovocations have further worsened the already volatile \r\nsituation in the occupied territories, especially in \r\noccupied East Jerusalem. \r\n The dehumanization of the Palestinian people \r\nthrough such exploitation is not only illegal and \r\nimmoral, but is counter-productive to the aim of \r\nachieving genuine and lasting peace. Israel cannot, as it \r\nhas so often tried to do in the past, alter the way in \r\nwhich it is perceived by the international community \r\nby listing, at the United Nations and other forums, \r\nactions it has undertaken to lessen the sufferings of the \r\nPalestinians. Israel must recognize itself as it is and \r\nthat it is a source of conflict in the Middle East. \r\n It is therefore manifestly clear that peace in the \r\nMiddle East will only be achieved when the \r\ninternational community succeeds in its efforts to have \r\nIsrael recognize its wrongdoings and to hold Israel \r\naccountable. Israel must improve the situation on the \r\nground, including lifting the blockade in Gaza, \r\naddressing the humanitarian needs of the people of the \r\noccupied territories, fostering economic activities and \r\nimproving the atmosphere for negotiations. \r\n It is necessary that the international community \r\nrefocus its energy and efforts to return to the \r\nPalestinians their inalienable rights, including the right \r\nto an independent State of Palestine. In that regard, we \r\nurge the Security Council to take the necessary \r\ndecisive action against Israel’s violations in the \r\noccupied Palestinian territory and to thus end the \r\nimmoral culture of impunity of the Israeli regime. \r\n Mr. Cabral (Guinea-Bissau), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n Yesterday, we also marked the International Day \r\nof Solidarity with the Palestinian People. I wish to take \r\nthis opportunity to pay tribute to all Palestinians who \r\nhave suffered in their just struggle to live in freedom \r\nand dignity in a State they can call their own. The \r\npeople of Palestine can count on Malaysia’s unceasing \r\nand unwavering support for their efforts to create an \r\nindependent and sovereign State of Palestine with East \r\nJerusalem as its capital. \r\n Mr. Al-Allaf (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset I express my gratitude and appreciation for the \r\nconvening of this important meeting, which coincides \r\nwith the International Day of Solidarity With the \r\nPalestinian People and renews the commitment of the \r\ninternational community to support and assist the \r\nPalestinian people in exercising their inalienable right \r\nto self-determination and establishing their \r\nindependent State. \r\n I also wish to express Jordan’s appreciation for \r\nthe historic role of the Committee on the Exercise of \r\nthe Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People and for \r\nthe efforts of its Chairman, His Excellency Mr. Paul \r\nBadji, and for the significant efforts by the Committee \r\nto preserve the United Nations historic responsibility to \r\nensure the rights of the Palestinian people.  \r\n Here, I also mention the letter of appreciation for \r\nthe Committee’s efforts that His Majesty King \r\nAbdullah Bin Al Hussein addressed yesterday to the \r\nChairman of the Committee. \r\n The situation in the Middle East is experiencing a \r\nhighly delicate stage these days. The gap between the \r\nparties to the conflict has expanded and unilateral \r\nactions have increased. The level-headed thinking \r\nrequired to control tensions and prevent escalating \r\nviolence is absent, as is the political will to achieve a \r\npermanent, just and comprehensive solution to the \r\nPalestinian problem, which is at the core of the conflict \r\nin the Middle East. \r\n Peace is the only option for the region. That \r\nrequires the relevant parties to commit to serious \r\nnegotiations, within the regional context, based on the \r\ntwo-State solution and the agreed terms of reference, in \r\norder to achieve comprehensive peace in the region. It \r\nis important that the negotiations resume at the point \r\nwhere the previous negotiations stopped and that they \r\naddress all of the issues of a final solution, primary \r\namong which are the borders, Jerusalem, refugees and \r\nsecurity. \r\n International efforts to resume negotiations must \r\nbe strengthened. Under the leadership of His Majesty \r\nKing Abdullah II, Jordan is continuing its efforts at all \r\nA/64/PV.52  \r\n \r\n09-62559 14 \r\n \r\nlevels in order to mobilize international support to \r\nlaunch the negotiation process between the Palestinians \r\nand the Israelis with the aim of achieving a peace \r\nagreement that guarantees the establishment of an \r\nindependent, contiguous and viable State on the \r\noccupied Palestinian territories based on the 1967 \r\nborders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. That \r\nprocess must take place within a clear timetable and \r\nbased on the accepted terms of reference, in particular \r\nthe Arab Peace Initiative, which reflects a unified Arab \r\nposition to achieve a comprehensive and permanent \r\npeace that guarantees true security and stability in the \r\nregion. \r\n The current situation in the Gaza Strip has \r\nbecome a human catastrophe, especially in the light of \r\nthe continued Israeli blockade which constitutes a \r\ncollective punishment of the civilian population of the \r\nGaza Strip. The Gaza Strip has turned into a giant \r\nprison. The siege and conflict must end and \r\nhumanitarian relief supplies must be guaranteed \r\nunrestricted access. Those in need of medical attention \r\nmust be allowed access to medical care and civilians \r\nshould be allowed free and unrestricted movement. The \r\ninternational community must strive to ensure \r\nprotection of the human rights of the Palestinian people \r\nthroughout the Palestinian territories, not as an act of \r\nhumanitarian charity but as a matter affecting \r\nPalestinian rights and the obligations and \r\nresponsibilities of the international community. \r\n In this respect, Jordan continues, under the \r\nleadership of His Majesty King Abdullah Bin  \r\nAl Hussein, its efforts and contacts with the \r\ninternational community to urge it to end the stifling \r\nsuffering of the Palestinian people and to provide \r\nassistance aimed at improving the living conditions of \r\nthe Palestinians and preventing their deterioration. We \r\ncall upon the international community, on the grounds \r\nof their legal and humanitarian responsibilities, to \r\nstand by their Palestinian brethren and provide \r\nemergency humanitarian relief and put an end to their \r\nhuman suffering.  \r\n The occupied territories today witness arbitrary \r\nIsraeli practices against Palestinians and the Arab \r\npopulation that are completely contrary to any desire to \r\nachieve peace. In order to create a sincere impression \r\nof seeking peace Israel would have to immediately halt \r\nall practices that contradict its obligations as the \r\noccupying Power and international human rights and \r\nhumanitarian law, specifically the Fourth Geneva \r\nConvention. Any progress would require a change in \r\nthe tragic reality and living conditions of the \r\nPalestinians in the occupied territories by revitalizing \r\nthe Palestinian economy, which cannot be achieved \r\nwithout the elimination of the closures and the \r\nunjustified security checkpoints. \r\n This year we witnessed a clear acceleration in the \r\npace and volume of unilateral Israeli measures in \r\noccupied East Jerusalem, such as excavations \r\nunderneath and around sites that are holy to Muslims \r\nand Christians, especially the holy sanctuary Al-Haram \r\nAl-Sharif and its surroundings, in addition to the \r\npolicies of home demolitions and expulsion of the Arab \r\npopulation in a feverish attempt to change the identity \r\nand demographic structure of occupied East Jerusalem \r\nand to create obstacles in the management of Islamic \r\nendowment trusts. In this respect the Hashemite \r\nKingdom of Jordan emphasizes that all of these \r\nunilateral Israeli practices are illegal and illegitimate \r\nand constitute a serious violation of Israel’s \r\ncommitments and obligations, as the occupying Power \r\nin the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem. \r\nThey also constitute an obstacle to the efforts to launch \r\nnegotiations seeking to achieve a two-State solution \r\nand a comprehensive peace in the Middle East. The \r\ninternational community must shoulder its \r\nresponsibilities and must adopt a firm position to put a \r\nhalt to all Israeli attacks and provocations in the \r\noccupied Arab territories.  \r\n Any harm to the holy city is, in the view of the \r\nHashemite Kingdom of Jordan and its leadership in the \r\nperson of His Majesty King Abdullah Bin Al Hussein, \r\nconstitutes a red line and crossing it is unacceptable. \r\nBased on this position, the protection of Jerusalem will \r\nalways be a Hashemite and Jordanian priority. Our \r\ncountry will spare no effort to protect Jerusalem and \r\nthe Muslim and Christian holy places. Jerusalem \r\nenjoys a significant position of importance in the \r\nminds and hearts of tens of millions of Muslims and \r\nChristians throughout the world, which makes of such \r\nillegal provocations and actions sparks that could \r\ncreate a situation that threatens the foundations of \r\ninternational peace and security. \r\n Israel’s activities seek to create a new reality on \r\nthe ground, to obliterate the Arab and Islamic features \r\nof Jerusalem and to affect the legal status of the city. \r\nThese provocative measures could undermine the \r\nefforts of international parties to achieve a just, \r\ncomprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East. \r\n A/64/PV.52\r\n \r\n15 09-62559 \r\n \r\nIndeed, they threaten the entire negotiating process. \r\nIsrael must put an immediate stop to these illegitimate \r\nviolations and must abide by the provisions of the \r\nIsraeli-Jordanian peace agreement with regard to \r\nJerusalem and the protection of the holy sites. \r\n The unilateral Israeli declaration of a partial halt \r\nto settlements in the occupied West Bank is an \r\ninsufficient step that does not fulfil the necessary \r\nconditions in the view of the international community \r\nseeking to achieve a two-State solution. The fact that \r\nEast Jerusalem was not covered by this proposed hold \r\non settlements is unacceptable and contradicts the \r\ninternational consensus that considered East Jerusalem \r\nto be part of the occupied territories in 1967. That \r\nconsensus also acknowledges that Jerusalem is a \r\nprincipal item among the issues of the final status \r\nnegotiations. The settlements themselves are a clear \r\nviolation of international law, based on paragraph 120 \r\nof the advisory opinion of the International Court of \r\nJustice on the legal consequences of the construction of \r\nthe separation wall in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritories (A/ES-10/273). \r\n Israeli actions linked to the construction of \r\nsettlements, such as the expulsion of Palestinians and \r\nthe demolition of their homes in several areas of the \r\nWest Bank and East Jerusalem, also constitute a clear \r\nviolation of international humanitarian law, specifically \r\nthe Fourth Geneva Convention. In addition to all this, \r\nIsraeli settlements constitute insurmountable burdens \r\non the movement of Palestinians and on development \r\nin the Palestinian territories. The settlements also \r\ndeprive Palestinians of the right to benefit from their \r\nland, their resources and their water sources. In this \r\ncontext, Jordan emphasizes the importance of a \r\ncomplete, direct and immediate cessation of all the \r\nillegal and condemned Israeli settlement activities, \r\nincluding the so-called natural growth of existing \r\nsettlements. Just as settlement itself is illegitimate so is \r\nits so-called natural growth, which is also an unnatural \r\nand illegitimate activity. Settlement and peace are \r\nopposites that cannot meet. Settlement activities \r\nundermine the chances for the creation of an \r\nindependent and viable Palestinian State on Palestinian \r\nnational soil. The feverish continuation of settlement \r\nactivities is a direct and grave threat to the prospects \r\nfor peace in the entire region. \r\n In conclusion, a just and comprehensive solution \r\nto the Palestinian question, which is the core of the \r\nconflict in the Middle East, is a key to the resolution of \r\nother conflicts and a guarantee to the peace and \r\nstability of the region. Our region is eager for peace, \r\nand peace can only be achieved through the two-State \r\nsolution, an independent, contiguous and viable \r\nPalestinian State, with East Jerusalem as its capital, \r\nliving in peace and security side by side with Israel. \r\n Mr. Momen (Bangladesh): Let me begin by \r\nthanking the President of the Assembly for scheduling \r\nthis meeting on the occasion of the observance of the \r\nInternational Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian \r\nPeople. On this occasion, Bangladesh unites with the \r\ninternational community in reaffirming its full support \r\nfor the Palestinian people in their just and legitimate \r\nstruggle for self-determination and freedom from \r\ncontinued occupation. Bangladesh stands firm in its \r\nposition on the Arab-Israeli conflict in favour of \r\nachieving a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in \r\nthe Middle East. \r\n My delegation aligns itself with the statements \r\nmade by the representative of Egypt on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement and by the representative of \r\nthe Syrian Arab Republic on behalf of the Organization \r\nof the Islamic Conference. I would, however, like to \r\nmention some issues of concern to us. \r\n The Palestinian issue has always been a serious \r\nconcern for Bangladesh. Our Prime Minister, Sheikh \r\nHasina, on this Day of Solidarity expressed our \r\nunwavering support for and solidarity with the \r\nPalestinian people in their just and legitimate struggle \r\nfor their right of self-determination and statehood.  \r\n Bangladesh reiterates its long-standing position \r\nthat the continued occupation of Palestine is the root \r\ncause of violence, unrest and destabilization in the \r\nregion. The people of Palestine have been under illegal \r\noccupation over the past four decades. Unfortunately, it \r\nappears to be a collective failure on the part of the \r\ninternational community that their fundamental rights \r\nto self-determination and a sovereign State have \r\nremained unrealized.  \r\n It is also unfortunate that Israel, whose people \r\nhad experienced sufferings in the past, has continued to \r\nviolate international humanitarian law by committing \r\nsystematic human rights violations against the \r\nPalestinian people. The people of Palestine are being \r\ndenied their fundamental rights to self-determination \r\nand to live freely in their own land, and displaced \r\nPalestinians have been denied their right to return \r\nhome in dignity and safety. We believe that the \r\nA/64/PV.52  \r\n \r\n09-62559 16 \r\n \r\nestablishment of an independent Palestinian State with \r\nEast Jerusalem as its capital is the only sustainable \r\nsolution to this long-lasting conflict. \r\n Bangladesh strongly condemns the illegal \r\nexpansion of settlements that Israel has undertaken by \r\ngrabbing Palestinian lands. The continued expansion of \r\nIsraeli settlements in the occupied territories and the \r\nconstruction of the separation wall threaten to derail \r\nthe ongoing peace negotiations. As the construction of \r\nthe wall in disregard of the International Court of \r\nJustice advisory opinion continues unabated, the \r\noccupied territories are increasingly being fragmented \r\ninto smaller parts, which will seriously affect the \r\nviability of a sovereign, stable, peaceful and \r\nindependent Palestine State. \r\n According to the report of the United Nations \r\nFact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict — the \r\nGoldstone report (A/HRC/12/48) — there is evidence \r\nindicating that serious violations of international \r\nhuman rights and humanitarian law were committed by \r\nIsrael during its military operations in Gaza from  \r\n27 December 2008 to 18 January 2009, and that Israel \r\nhad committed actions tantamount to war crimes, and \r\npossibly crimes against humanity. The situation in East \r\nJerusalem seriously deteriorated, with land \r\nconfiscations, house demolitions and evictions of \r\nPalestinian residents and the transfer of more Israeli \r\nsettlers. Homes, schools, medical facilities and even \r\nUnited Nations buildings took direct hits.  \r\n We are deeply concerned at the violations of \r\ninternational human rights and humanitarian law \r\ncommitted by Israel as reported in the Goldstone \r\nreport. We trust that implementation of the \r\nrecommendations of the Goldstone report will help \r\ncreate an opportunity to put an end to impunity for \r\nviolations of international law in Israel and in the \r\noccupied Palestinian territory. \r\n My delegation wishes to draw attention to the \r\nfact that Israel, as a signatory to the relevant provisions \r\nof the Fourth Geneva Convention, which sets forth the \r\nresponsibilities of an occupying Power, cannot legally \r\nor morally absolve itself of its responsibilities to \r\nguarantee the basic human rights of the people under \r\nits occupation. The General Assembly and the Security \r\nCouncil, in their resolutions adopted over the years, \r\nhave reconfirmed Israel’s obligation to ensure the basic \r\nhuman rights of the Palestinian people. Bangladesh \r\nbelieves that only full and sincere implementation of \r\nthe relevant General Assembly and Security Council \r\nresolutions can resolve the Palestinian crisis. \r\n A durable and sustainable resolution of the Arab-\r\nIsraeli conflict, including the issue of Palestine, which \r\nis the core of the long-lasting crisis, must be our \r\ncollective strategic objective. All Member States must \r\npledge complete commitment to this objective and \r\nthrow their full moral, diplomatic, political and \r\neconomic support behind its early realization. \r\nBangladesh is ready to play a supportive role in this \r\ncollective endeavour to achieve a just and \r\ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East. \r\n In conclusion, in order to achieve a lasting \r\nsolution in the Middle East, it is very important to \r\naddress the key issue, which is the illegal Israeli \r\noccupation of the Arab territories. The solution \r\ntherefore requires Israel’s complete and unconditional \r\nwithdrawal from the occupied Palestinian territories, \r\nincluding East Jerusalem, and all other occupied Arab \r\nlands. We reiterate that the creation of a Palestinian \r\nState, coexisting peacefully alongside Israel on the \r\nbasis of the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its \r\ncapital, is the only sustainable solution to the conflict \r\nthat may bring peace to the region. The Road Map, the \r\nArab Peace Initiative and the relevant resolutions are \r\nthe best guides for achieving a two-State solution. \r\n Mr. Sipangule (Zambia): My delegation \r\nwelcomes this debate on agenda items 15 and 16, on \r\nthe situation in the Middle East and the question of \r\nPalestine, respectively. As clearly stated in the report \r\nof the Secretary-General contained in document \r\nA/64/351, the United Nations remains and will \r\ncontinue to be central for the promotion of a peaceful \r\nsettlement of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, which is, \r\nin fact, the core of any success in achieving global \r\npeace and stability in the Middle East. \r\n The Zambian delegation fully aligns itself with \r\nthe statement made by the representative of Egypt on \r\nbehalf of the Non-Aligned Movement. However, in our \r\nnational capacity, we wish to make one additional \r\ncardinal point.  \r\n The General Assembly, together with the Security \r\nCouncil, correctly foresaw the ultimate solution to \r\nproblem of the Middle East about 60 years ago, when it \r\nadopted the principle of a two-State solution. That \r\nprinciple, which remains valid today, provides for two \r\nStates and two peoples living side by side in peace and \r\nsecurity. This ultimate solution was clearly elaborated \r\n A/64/PV.52\r\n \r\n17 09-62559 \r\n \r\nin resolution 181 (II) of 29 November 1947 and has \r\nbeen reaffirmed by subsequent Security Council \r\nresolutions, in particular resolutions 242 (1967) and \r\n338 (1973) up to resolution 1850 (2008), which \r\nunfortunately was sidelined when a military solution \r\nwas promoted over a negotiated solution between the \r\nkey parties to the conflict. \r\n One year ago, on 26 November 2008, the \r\nAssembly — realizing that, notwithstanding the desire \r\nof the Israelis, the Palestinians and the larger \r\ninternational community to set the goal of a two-State \r\nsolution, no major steps had been taken by the \r\ninternational community in that direction — adopted \r\nresolution 63/29. That Assembly action, taken with the \r\nlargest support in history, reaffirmed the undisputed \r\nhistorical and socio-economic viability of the two-State \r\nsolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Zambia \r\nwishes to appeal to the key participants in the conflict \r\nto seize this opportunity to crown those two years of \r\nmultilateral efforts to deliver peace and security in the \r\nMiddle East in general and to the suffering Palestinian \r\npeople in particular.  \r\n Mr. Mohamad (Sudan), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n Zambia, a country that maintains full diplomatic \r\nrelations with both the State of Israel and the \r\nPalestinian National Authority, continues to support the \r\ntwo-State solution to this conflict. In bilateral relations \r\nwith both parties, the Zambian Government has urged \r\nand continues to urge both to negotiate in good faith on \r\nthe core issues in the conflict on which the premises \r\nfor any comprehensive agreement can be based. Those \r\nissues are the status of Jerusalem, settlements, \r\nrefugees, borders, security and even water. \r\n In our view, the international community needs to \r\nsustain support to both Israel and the Palestinian \r\nNational Authority in order to build the required \r\nconfidence for them to revert to the original United \r\nNations plan for the region — the two-State solution, \r\nby which two States for two peoples exist side by side \r\nin peace and security. \r\n Mr. Cabral (Guinea-Bissau) (spoke in French): \r\nYesterday in the Trusteeship Council Chamber we \r\nparticipated in a very moving day. Together, we \r\nattended a celebration of the International Day of \r\nSolidarity with the Palestinian People. I do not think \r\nthat we just did that out of habit, not at all. I do not \r\nthink that those who were there — the many \r\nrepresentatives of civil society, international \r\norganizations, non-governmental organizations and \r\neven representatives from the Jewish community — \r\nacted out of habit, either. \r\n We were moved by the need to express our active \r\nsolidarity towards a justice-loving people, a people that \r\nis suffering — human beings, like us. Yesterday we did \r\nnot have the feeling that we were attending a campaign \r\nagainst Israel, far from it. On the contrary, we heard \r\nmeasured statements by speakers who expressed \r\nthemselves on the basis on facts, known and \r\nundeniable facts — and, so far, irrefutable facts. \r\n The Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable \r\nRights of the Palestinian People is working tirelessly \r\nso that we do not forget the tragic fate forced on the \r\nPalestinian people. I wish to congratulate the \r\nCommittee for its perseverance in its useful and \r\nnecessary work demanding our awareness of the fate of \r\na people fighting for its freedom. I would like to say \r\nthat yesterday the Committee excelled in its \r\npresentation of the situation, in the rigour of its \r\nimpartial analysis of, as I said, irrefutable facts. I \r\ncongratulate our colleague Ambassador Badji, who is, \r\nin our view, the most noteworthy member of the \r\nCommittee, which is doing such excellent work. \r\n Moreover, we did not have the impression \r\nyesterday that we were expressing any hostility \r\ntowards Israel, far from it. I am not here today before \r\nthe Assembly to participate in some sort of alleged trial \r\nagainst Israel, not at all. We are here to demonstrate \r\nour solidarity towards a people. We are here because \r\nwe have the very profound feeling that an injustice \r\nmust be rectified. We all have the feeling that \r\nsomething must be done, and done quickly, so that we \r\ncan be in conformity with the well-known resolution \r\nadopted here in the General Assembly — not in New \r\nYork City, because it was in 1947, but in any case, 62 \r\nyears ago, almost to the day. I am pleased that a while \r\nago someone mentioned that important resolution.  \r\n We are not here in an echo chamber. We are not \r\nacting mechanically. We are officials who have the \r\nintention to fully shoulder our responsibilities. It is up \r\nto the international community to ensure international \r\nlegality, to ensure respect for the principles that guide \r\ninternational relations so that peace can exist in the \r\nMiddle East and so that peace will be lasting and based \r\non the fundamental principles that regulate today’s \r\ninternational relations. \r\nA/64/PV.52  \r\n \r\n09-62559 18 \r\n \r\n For a long time, we have repeatedly said how we \r\nwere and remain against the actions of the Israeli \r\nauthorities in Palestine, in the occupied Arab \r\nterritories. We have always maintained in a very \r\ndetermined way that that situation is unjust and that we \r\ncannot accept it. Today, we must note that the situation \r\nis stagnating, as we saw in the report in document \r\nA/64/35, which was tabled yesterday on behalf of the \r\nCommittee by the Ambassador of Malta. \r\n Stagnation — there is no progress; things are not \r\nmoving forward, and we could even say that the \r\nsituation is becoming much more complicated. So what \r\ndo we do except to say, to repeat, to try to convince our \r\nIsraeli friends of the need to cast a much more serene \r\ngaze on what is happening in their country and around \r\nthem so that they can hear what the rest of the \r\ninternational community is saying. \r\n We have always said here that we cannot accept \r\nthe wall that was built illegally. That wall is simply \r\nunacceptable, not only because the International Court \r\nof Justice said as much in its advisory opinion, but also \r\nbecause the wall, which snakes through territories that \r\nbelong to the Palestinians, is in the process of creating \r\na horrible injustice. The wall separates neighbours, it \r\nseparates people who, before it, associated with each \r\nother. The wall prevents children from going to school. \r\nThe wall keeps believers from going to the mosque or \r\nto church. The wall is in taking away the veritable soul \r\nof the Palestinians. We thus cannot accept it.  \r\n I would like to say here that this wall could also \r\nbe a type of alienation of our Israeli friends from their \r\nown history. Walls, barbed wire and watchtowers \r\nshould conjure up some very bad memories for our \r\nfriends. I think they should not accept the construction \r\nof this wall because it represents a true laceration in \r\nthe body and soul of the Palestinians. That is \r\nunacceptable.  \r\n I also say that it is high time that the Palestinians \r\nreconcile among and with themselves. We are friends, \r\nand we have to challenge them to reunify, so that they \r\nwill come together around the core principle — the \r\ninalienable right of their people to self-determination. \r\nThe differences should be silenced. Our Palestinian \r\nfriends should be able to sit down at the same table to \r\nlift the standard of liberty, to struggle for the self-\r\ndetermination of their people. That is what I would like \r\nto say to them today, here and now, with a great deal of \r\nsincerity. \r\n Those living in Gaza are no less Palestinian than \r\npeople living elsewhere, on the West Bank or in the \r\ndiaspora. They are human beings, just like each of us, \r\nwho deserve that we think about their fate, who \r\ndeserve that we be struck by the barbaric acts they \r\nhave been subjected to. They have been harassed, \r\nattacked, bombed, day and night, violently. I think that \r\nabove and beyond humanitarian questions and \r\nhumanitarian aspects that bring us here today, we must \r\nalso cast our eyes on the fate befalling those living in \r\nthat part of Palestine.  \r\n And I would like to say that we are grateful to the \r\nSecretary-General for displaying such determination in \r\nhis quest for a fair, lasting solution in the Middle East. \r\nI would also like to thank the members of the Quartet \r\nfor their efforts and say that we are with them, we are \r\nbehind them to support their commitments and efforts \r\nto achieve a lasting resolution of this conflict. \r\n We have heard some statements here that could \r\ngive rise to some irritation, but I think we are \r\nreasonable people. We all wish to work for peace. We \r\nshould certainly be disposed to show patience, but we \r\nalso need to continue to show determination to bring to \r\nthe Palestinian people all the support that they need, to \r\ngive them active solidarity that will not fail them, to \r\nsay to all who might like to listen that we are not \r\nagainst anybody, that we are not showing hostility \r\ntowards anyone, that we wish to work for peace, a \r\nlasting peace that benefits all peoples in the region. \r\n I conclude by saying that as long as this question \r\nis not resolved, as long as the inalienable right of the \r\nPalestinian people is not fulfilled, as long as children, \r\nwomen, seniors — in short, human beings — are \r\nsubject to barbaric acts, as long as they continue to \r\nsuffer, we will be there to add our voice to the clamour \r\nthat is rising here in this Chamber, in this General \r\nAssembly Hall, to say “no” to what is unacceptable, to \r\nrefuse what is illegal, to come out against actions that \r\ngo against the fundamental principles of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations and the freedom of peoples. \r\n Mr. Ba-Omar (Oman) (spoke in Arabic): It gives \r\nme great pleasure to extend, on behalf of the Sultanate \r\nof Oman, our thanks and appreciation to His \r\nExcellency Ambassador Paul Badji, Chairman of the \r\nCommittee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of \r\nthe Palestinian People, for the Committee’s \r\ncomprehensive report in document A/64/35. I cannot \r\nfail to mention that we highly appreciate his efforts, as \r\n A/64/PV.52\r\n \r\n19 09-62559 \r\n \r\nwell as those of the other members of the Committee, \r\nin supporting the Palestinian people in their just cause. \r\nWe would also like to thank him for his comprehensive \r\nstatement on the situation in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritories (see A/64/PV.51). \r\n There is no doubt that our meeting today acquires \r\nspecial importance with regard to an issue that has \r\nbeen before the international community for far too \r\nlong, particularly since the situation in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territories is increasingly deteriorating. The \r\ninternational community cannot sit silent and allow the \r\nsituation to deteriorate further. More than 50 years of \r\nmurder, expulsion and destruction of infrastructure \r\nhave not broken the will of the Palestinian people to \r\ndemand their legitimate rights, including the \r\nestablishment of their independent State, with \r\nJerusalem as its capital.  \r\n The Government of Oman expresses its deep \r\nconcern regarding the serious situation in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territories, particularly the continued Israeli \r\nblockade and the cruel humanitarian crisis imposed on \r\nthe Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip, the \r\ncampaigns of settler occupation, the separation wall \r\nand other illegal actions carried out by Israel in Holy \r\nJerusalem and its surrounding areas, and its desecration \r\nof religious and spiritual holy places. \r\n Today marks the celebration of the thirty-second \r\nInternational Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian \r\nPeople, which in 1977 embodied the firm position that \r\nthe international community has taken in support of the \r\nPalestinian people in their struggle for their legitimate \r\nand inalienable rights. This day also coincides with the \r\nsixty-second anniversary of the adoption in 1947 of \r\nresolution 181 (II), which provided for the partition of \r\nPalestine into two States. Nevertheless, the Palestinian \r\npeople are still deprived of their legitimate rights, \r\nnational sovereignty and independence and of their \r\nright to self-determination. That has resulted in more \r\nthan 4 million Palestinian refugees suffering the \r\nscourge of exile, diaspora and deprivation. \r\n The aspirations of the Palestinian people have \r\nbeen and are still directed to this international forum in \r\nthe hope that it will protect them from the \r\nintransigence and oppression of successive Israeli \r\nGovernments and their inhuman and illegal practices. \r\nThe international community should take a firm, \r\nserious stand against all those practices.  \r\n Earlier this year we saw the destructive results of \r\nthe war against Gaza and the flagrant violations of \r\nhuman rights. We should send a clear, unambiguous \r\nmessage demanding that Israel put an end to those \r\npolicies and start genuine negotiations to establish the \r\nfoundations for security and stability in the region, on \r\nthe basis of the framework of the peace process, \r\nincluding the principle of land for peace and Security \r\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). \r\n In that regard, my delegation welcomed the \r\nadoption of Assembly resolution 64/10 on 5 November \r\n2009, on the report of the United Nations Fact-Finding \r\nMission on the Gaza Conflict (A/HRC/12/48), and the \r\ninclusion by the Assembly of recommendations of that \r\nreport in its resolution. We hope that all relevant \r\nUnited Nations entities, including the Security Council, \r\nwill seriously consider them.  \r\n My delegation would also like to express its deep \r\nconcern regarding the continued occupation of Arab \r\nterritories in the Syrian Golan and southern Lebanon, \r\nIsrael’s daily violations of Lebanese air, land and sea \r\nspace in clear violation of Council resolution 1701 \r\n(2006) and its illegal actions to change the \r\ndemographic and natural makeup of the occupied \r\nSyrian Golan. We call on Israel to withdraw from all \r\noccupied Arab territories and start serious negotiations \r\nwith the parties concerned. \r\n Oman has always been among the countries that \r\nwelcomed the peace process and considered it a natural \r\nand civilized way to settle disagreements through \r\ndialogue and negotiations. On that basis, we call on the \r\nparties concerned and the sponsors of the peace process \r\nto play an effective role in reaching a settlement of the \r\nMiddle East conflict, in view of the gravity of the \r\nsituation in the region and the crises seen there \r\nrecently. \r\n That will require the Security Council and the \r\nQuartet to shoulder their responsibilities by responding \r\npositively to the Arab Peace Initiative and to call for \r\nconvening a peace conference to be attended by the \r\nArab parties, Israel and the permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council, with a view to reaching a just and \r\ncomprehensive solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict on \r\nall tracks, in accordance with the relevant international \r\nresolutions and the principle of land for peace. Let us \r\nhope that the fruit of that conference will be the \r\nembodiment of the vision of establishing a Palestinian \r\nA/64/PV.52  \r\n \r\n09-62559 20 \r\n \r\nState, living side by side with Israel within \r\ninternationally recognized borders. \r\n In concluding, we call on the international \r\ncommunity to support the peace efforts in the Middle \r\nEast, for a peace that can be achieved only through the \r\nrecognition of the legitimate right of the Palestinian \r\npeople to establish their independent State within the \r\n1967 borders, including Jerusalem, and to live in peace \r\nin a sovereign State within internationally recognized \r\nborders. \r\n Mr. Valero Briceño (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): Venezuela supports the \r\ndraft resolutions before the Assembly today and thus \r\naligns itself with the statement by the representative of \r\nEgypt on behalf of the countries of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement (see A/64/PV.51). \r\n The Government and people of the Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela join in the clamour demanding \r\nan end, unequivocally and without further delay, to the \r\nIsraeli presence in the occupied territories as a basic \r\nprerequisite for achieving a comprehensive, just and \r\nlasting peace in the Middle East and for the definitive \r\nestablishment of a free and sovereign Palestinian State. \r\n Today we remember that 62 years ago the \r\nGeneral Assembly adopted the historic resolution  \r\n181 (II), calling for the creation of two States in the \r\nterritory of Palestine. The State of Israel was founded \r\nin 1948 and has now existed for 61 years. The \r\nPalestinian State has yet to be born, having fallen prey \r\nto the genocidal aggression of Israel. \r\n On 27 November 2009 the President of the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez Frías, \r\nand the President of the Palestinian National Authority, \r\nMahmoud Abbas, met in Caracas to strengthen the \r\nhistorical ties between their peoples. President Abbas \r\nvisited various countries in Latin America, where he \r\nwas welcomed with signs of solidarity with the \r\nPalestinian cause. In welcoming President Abbas to \r\nVenezuela, our President, Hugo Chávez, said: \r\n  “We salute the heroic Palestinian people, a \r\npeople with a long history of struggle, spirituality \r\nand sacrifice. The Bolivarian Revolution from the \r\nbeginning has sided with the Palestinian people. \r\nWe have always been on the side of the \r\nPalestinian people in their memorable fight \r\nagainst the Yankee empire, their lackeys and the \r\ngenocidal State of Israel, which bulldozes, kills \r\nand attempts to exterminate the Palestinian \r\npeople. All those who fight for justice on this \r\nplanet join their voices to those of the Palestinian \r\npeople.” \r\n In a speech before the National Assembly, the \r\nparliament of Venezuela, Palestinian leader Mahmoud \r\nAbbas stated: \r\n  “We demand that the international \r\ncommunity and the world understand that for  \r\n60 years, Palestine has wanted to live as a free, \r\npeaceful, independent and sovereign State and \r\npeople, like the other countries in the world. … \r\nWe have inherited the task of building a \r\ndemocratic State in Palestine where Jews, \r\nChristians and Muslims can live on equal terms.” \r\n The Presidents of Venezuela and the Palestinian \r\nNational Authority signed a framework cooperation \r\nagreement between the two countries, which involves \r\nthe development of social, economic, educational, \r\nagricultural, scientific and cultural programmes, among \r\nothers. They also signed a memorandum of \r\nunderstanding on university-level education for \r\ntraining Palestinian professionals in undergraduate and \r\ngraduate programmes at various institutions of higher \r\neducation in Venezuela. \r\n During Mr. Abbas’ visit to the national \r\nparliament, that body issued a declaration stating that, \r\nto achieve lasting peace in the Middle East, the State of \r\nIsrael must recognize each and every one of the rights \r\nof the Palestinian nation, put an end to the occupation \r\nof the occupied Palestinian territories and to the siege \r\nimposed on the Gaza Strip, dismantle the Israeli \r\nsettlements and resolve the Palestinian refugee issue. \r\nThe slaughter of the Palestinian people, the demolition \r\nof their houses, the systematic destruction of orchards \r\nand olive groves, the dismantling and destruction of \r\nbasic civic infrastructure and the imprisonment of the \r\nPalestinian people must cease.  \r\n Venezuela recalls the report of the United Nations \r\nFact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict, drafted \r\nunder the leadership of Richard Goldstone, of  \r\n16 October 2009 (A/HRC/12/48), and its condemnation \r\nof the multiple and massive violations of the Fourth \r\nGeneva Convention characterized as war crimes \r\ncommitted by the Israeli occupying forces — \r\nexecutions, torture, inhumane treatment, use of human \r\nshields and physical and psychological harm to the \r\n A/64/PV.52\r\n \r\n21 09-62559 \r\n \r\nPalestinian population during Operation Cast Lead in \r\nDecember 2008 and January 2009.  \r\n Furthermore, it recalls the conclusions of the \r\nGoldstone report referring to the long and sinister \r\nblockade of Gaza by the occupying Power, Israel, \r\nincluding depravation of the basic means of \r\nsustenance: jobs, water, shelter, the right to movement \r\nand a court of justice, inter alia. Israel remains the \r\noccupying Power in the occupied Palestinian territory, \r\nincluding the Gaza Strip, and therefore it has specific \r\nobligations under the Geneva Convention to protect the \r\noccupied population. But instead of protecting the \r\nPalestinian people as required under international law, \r\nthe Government of Israel systematically exterminates \r\nit.  \r\n We cannot forget the situation facing the \r\nPalestinian people in the West Bank, with more than \r\n600 check points and control points, which impede \r\ntheir free movement and development, nor can we \r\nforget the construction of an ominous and illegal wall \r\non Palestinian territory, nor the acts of aggression, the \r\nattacks and the killings of Palestinian civilians in the \r\nWest Bank and East Jerusalem. Venezuela categorically \r\nrejects the violent attacks by Israeli extremists against \r\nthe Palestinians gathered in holy places — the mosques \r\nAl-Haram al-Sharif and Al-Aqsa.  \r\n We can never equate the genocidal Government \r\nof Israel with those Palestinian forces who, under the \r\nprotection of inalienable historic rights and in the \r\nexercise of their legitimate self-defence, resist the \r\ncriminal aggression against their nation and their \r\npeople. We would like to recall that the Revolutionary \r\nGovernment of President Hugo Chávez Frías \r\nsuspended diplomatic relations with the Government of \r\nIsrael following its brutal invasion of Gaza and is not \r\nprepared to resume them until the inhumane \r\nharassment of the Palestinian people ceases.  \r\n The Israeli authorities, responsible for genocide \r\nand crimes against humanity, must be brought before in \r\nthe International Criminal Court. It is time for them to \r\nbe held accountable under international law. How \r\nmany more crimes must they commit before they have \r\nto answer to the international rule of law? The Security \r\nCouncil cannot evade its responsibilities in this matter; \r\nit must echo the cry of the peoples of the world \r\ndemanding justice for the Palestinian people. \r\n In organizing this important meeting of the \r\nGeneral Assembly on the question of Palestine, I think \r\nwe should remember the poetic song of Mahmoud \r\nDarwish:  \r\n “We love life whenever we can.  \r\nWe steal a thread from a silkworm to weave  \r\na sky …”. \r\n Mr. Hernández-Milian (Costa Rica) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): When on 5 February 2008 Costa Rica \r\nrecognized the State of Palestine, it did so honouring \r\nan historic commitment to that people, especially since \r\nwe were one of the 33 countries that voted in favour of \r\nthe resolution that approved the 1947 Partition Plan for \r\nPalestine (resolution 181 (II)). In speaking in this \r\ndebate, my country would like to build bridges. Today \r\nwe extend a hand of solidarity to the Palestinian \r\npeople, and we hope that in the near future we will no \r\nlonger have to fill the Assembly’s archives with attacks \r\nand rhetorical messages that do not contribute anything \r\nsubstantive to peace in the region. \r\n We are concerned by the demonstrations of \r\nviolence that are still going on, because they create \r\ngreater tension and they do not help to provide the \r\nconditions for renewing the dialogue between Israelis \r\nand Palestinians. The humanitarian situation in Gaza is \r\nstill a cause for concern.  \r\n Costa Rica understands the legitimate concerns of \r\nIsraelis with regard to their security and calls on the \r\nPalestinian authorities to continue to monitor the \r\nactivities of extremist elements that are involved in \r\nacts of terrorism. At the same time, we also feel that it \r\nis imperative to lift the restrictions imposed by Israel \r\non access to the goods and humanitarian aid so \r\nurgently needed by the population of Gaza, particularly \r\ngiven the upcoming winter. \r\n Recently, new obstacles to rapprochement \r\nbetween the parties have emerged, moving them further \r\naway from negotiations on the core issues of the \r\nconflict. One was the authorization by the Government \r\nof Israel to build new settlements, in addition to \r\ncontinuing its policy of demolition of Palestinian \r\nhouses and eviction of Palestinian families in East \r\nJerusalem. The Israeli policy of settlements expansion \r\nin occupied territories, in addition to weakening those \r\nwho are called on to be their interlocutors in the \r\nnegotiations, adds to the distrust between the parties \r\nand endangers any possibility for a solution to the \r\nconflict. The Palestinians need to know that the \r\nnegotiations are credible. \r\nA/64/PV.52  \r\n \r\n09-62559 22 \r\n \r\n On the other hand, we call upon the Palestinians \r\nto redouble efforts conducive to genuine national \r\nreconciliation — a condition that is necessary for \r\nholding credible elections and for moving the peace \r\nprocess forward. Although President Abbas and his \r\nteam have established guidelines to improve the \r\nsecurity conditions and to free their people from \r\nviolence, Palestinian unity has been systematically \r\nweakened by radical sectors that represent an obstacle \r\nto the well-being of the people they claim to be \r\ndefending.  \r\n We are concerned about the announcement of the \r\nPalestinian Central Elections Commission with regard \r\nto the cancellation of the elections that were planned \r\nfor next January, because the Palestinian people and \r\nthe international community need to continue to count \r\non legitimate leadership in order to move the peace \r\nprocess forward. Israel also needs valid interlocutors \r\nwho are able to negotiate and end the conflict. The \r\nabsence of that leadership will only weaken the \r\ncommitment to the peace process. \r\n It is indispensable that there be a renewal of \r\nnegotiations between the parties on the final objectives, \r\nwithout conditions and without detriment to the \r\nagreements already reached. We have heard both \r\nparties express the desire to find a solution to the \r\nconflict on the basis of two States, and good use should \r\nbe made of that. That commitment should not be \r\nmarginalized.  \r\n It is up to the international community to assume \r\nthe responsibility of providing a favourable context for \r\nthe reactivation of the negotiating process. Both the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council have a \r\nhuge responsibility, particularly those States that have \r\ngreater influence over the parties.  \r\n Costa Rica is convinced that the only sustainable \r\nsolution to the conflict in the Middle East is one that is \r\nfounded on absolute respect for international law, \r\nincluding the fulfilment of the resolutions of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council, the \r\nMadrid principles and the Arab Peace Initiative. Today, \r\nthe path to sustainable peace involves observance of \r\ninternational humanitarian law without reservation and \r\nabsolute respect for human rights. The objective of two \r\nStates, Palestine and Israel, living side by side in peace \r\nwithin internationally recognized borders can only be \r\nbased on international law, not on force. In this \r\ncontext, the Arab countries are strategic partners in \r\nbuilding peace and should therefore contribute to \r\nhelping the Palestinian Authority prevent this conflict \r\nfrom serving as an excuse for actions by extremist \r\ngroups. \r\n The parties must focus negotiations on the core \r\nissues of the conflict: Jerusalem, borders, refugees, \r\nsettlements and security. This was in essence one of the \r\nmessages that the President of my country, Óscar Arias, \r\nrecently took to the region when he visited Israel and \r\nPalestine and held constructive meetings with leaders \r\nof both parties. Costa Rica is aware of its limited \r\ninfluence in a place where the major Powers of the \r\nworld have failed time and again. However, we take to \r\nboth parties the message of a faithful friend who has no \r\nother interest in the region than that of contributing to \r\npeace.  \r\n During President Arias’s visit, Costa Rica shared \r\nwith the other parties its experience as a small \r\ndemocracy that lives without an army and entrusts its \r\nsecurity to law, the international community and its \r\nmultilateral mechanisms. We welcomed the interest \r\nshown by the Palestinian authorities in our experiences \r\nand we shared with both parties the conviction that, \r\nprovided there are appropriate conditions in place for \r\npeaceful regional coexistence, building a military \r\nstructure in the Palestinian State would not seem to \r\nmake sense.  \r\n Today more than ever before, we need bold \r\nmeasures to build trust and good will as the basis for a \r\nlasting and sustainable peace. In the Middle East, there \r\nwill be no final victory of one over the other. In the \r\nend, peace will be the fruit of pragmatic voices that \r\naccept the coexistence of two independent States that \r\nwish to live in peace and security. \r\n Mr. Ali (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): At the outset, \r\nI would like to express my appreciation and gratitude \r\nto the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable \r\nRights of the Palestinian People and its Chair, the \r\nPermanent Representative of Senegal, Mr. Paul Badji, \r\nwho yesterday organized an important ceremony to \r\ncelebrate the International Day of Solidarity with the \r\nPalestinian People. We would like to emphasize once \r\nagain our complete and unreserved solidarity with and \r\nsupport for the legitimate struggle of the Palestinian \r\npeople in their just cause to recover their right to self-\r\ndetermination and to establish an independent State \r\nwith Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. \r\n A/64/PV.52\r\n \r\n23 09-62559 \r\n \r\n Israel, the occupying Power, continues to defy the \r\ninternational community by depriving the Palestinian \r\npeople of their rights and violating international, \r\ninternational humanitarian and international human \r\nrights law. It pursues these actions in inhumane and \r\nillegal ways that violate the rights of the Palestinians in \r\ntheir occupied territories. That is clear to all and has \r\nrecently been emphasized in a number of United \r\nNations reports, including the report of Special \r\nRapporteur Richard Falk on the situation of human \r\nrights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel \r\nsince 1967 (A/64/328), a United Nations report \r\ninvestigating incidents that took place during Israel’s \r\ninvasion of Gaza, and the combined report \r\n(A/HRC/10/22) presented by 10 Special Rapporteurs \r\non 20 March 2009 to the Human Rights Council \r\nregarding Israel’s siege of Gaza, which called for the \r\nblockade to be lifted and for the import of basic \r\nnecessities, fuel, construction and agricultural \r\nmaterials into Gaza and for the free movement of \r\npeople to work and hospitals.  \r\n In addition, the report of the High Commissioner \r\nfor Human Rights (A/HRC/8/17) noted serious \r\nbreaches of human rights during the Israeli aggression \r\nin Gaza. Finally, the comprehensive report of the \r\nUnited Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza \r\nConflict (A/HRC/12/48), headed by Judge Richard \r\nGoldstone, which we considered in this Assembly, led \r\nto the adoption of the important resolution 64/10 on \r\nthat subject. \r\n Israel’s destructive aggression in besieged Gaza \r\nhas caused the deaths of thousands of people in Gaza \r\nand wounded and disabled many, including women and \r\nchildren, as well as the destruction of homes, schools, \r\nhospitals, universities, factories, businesses, places of \r\nworship, and United Nations facilities. Crossing points \r\ninto Gaza remain closed, besieging 1.5 million people \r\nin Gaza. In the West Bank and East Jerusalem, Israel \r\ncontinues its settlement activities, its destruction of \r\nPalestinian property and its appropriation of fertile \r\nlands in an attempt to alter the demographic nature of \r\nthe region, prevent the establishment of a Palestinian \r\nState and influence the final status negotiations. \r\n The Palestinians continue to suffer from the \r\nconstruction of the apartheid wall in the West Bank, in \r\ncontravention of the advisory opinion of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice on the building of the \r\nwall. The Palestinians suffer incarceration and \r\ndetention, even of children, and aggression by Israeli \r\nsettlers. In 2009, checkpoints in the occupied territories \r\nnumbered 688. The Palestinians cannot enjoy their \r\nrights to water, food, work, clothing, shelter, health, \r\neducation and, indeed, life. The Israelis continue to \r\nenlarge their settlements in East Jerusalem by \r\nconfiscating land, bringing in settlers, destroying \r\nhomes and chasing out the Palestinians as they Judaize \r\nthe city and alter its demographic character. They \r\nexcavate in and around the Al-Aqsa mosque, in \r\ndisregard for Muslim sensitivities around the world.  \r\n Hundreds of resolutions, including Security \r\nCouncil resolution 497 (1981), have demanded that \r\nIsrael withdraw from occupied Arab lands, including \r\nthe Syrian Golan. Nevertheless, Israel has increased the \r\nnumber of settlers in the Golan, inter alia, by building \r\ninfrastructure, businesses, water and other natural \r\nresources. Israel consistently violates the civil and \r\npolitical rights of the Syrian people of the occupied \r\nGolan and continues to disperse Syrian families and to \r\nprevent the United Nations from accessing the \r\nterritory. In addition, the Syrian population is suffering \r\nfrom anti-personnel mines and the dumping of nuclear \r\nwaste in some occupied areas. We also ask Israel to \r\nwithdraw from Lebanese territories, including Kfar \r\nShuba and Al-Ghajar village in southern Lebanon. \r\n We have always supported the Palestinian people \r\nand their fight against injustice and occupation. The \r\nUnited Nations must assume its historic responsibility \r\nto ensure a just and comprehensive settlement of the \r\nPalestinian cause, the core of the Arab-Israeli conflict, \r\nby pressuring Israel to withdraw fully from all Arab \r\nterritories occupied since 1967 and to give the \r\nPalestinians the right to return to their land and \r\nestablish their independent State, based on hundreds of \r\nresolutions of the Security Council and the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Mr. Zhang Yesui (China) (spoke in Chinese): \r\nYesterday, the Committee on the Exercise of the \r\nInalienable Rights of the Palestinian People held a \r\nspecial meeting to observe the International Day of \r\nSolidarity with the Palestinian People. Premier Wen \r\nJiabao of China sent a message of solidarity to the \r\nCommittee, expressing support for the just cause of the \r\nPalestinian people in seeking their national \r\nindependence. Today, the consideration of the question \r\nof Palestine and the situation in the Middle East in the \r\nGeneral Assembly is of particular significance. We \r\nhope that this meeting will give new impetus to \r\nrelaunching the Middle East peace process.  \r\nA/64/PV.52  \r\n \r\n09-62559 24 \r\n \r\n Two years after the Annapolis meeting, the peace \r\nprocess in the Middle East is again at a crossroads. We \r\nhoped that Palestine and Israel would have advanced \r\ntowards negotiations for a just and lasting peace and \r\nhave achieved results. However, it is regrettable that \r\nthe situation there is still tumultuous and negotiations \r\nremain deadlocked. Despite the tireless efforts of the \r\nparties concerned to resolve the situation in the Middle \r\nEast, in particular the question of Palestine, there has \r\nbeen no major breakthrough in the political process. \r\nThe situation on the ground has been marked by some \r\nvery alarming events and tendencies.  \r\n Late last year and early this year, the military \r\nactions of Israel in Gaza caused grave casualties and \r\nthe destruction of property. They not only triggered a \r\nsevere humanitarian crisis, but also set back the Middle \r\nEast peace process. Israel’s disproportionate use of \r\nforce is unacceptable. The facts have shown that until \r\nthe question of Palestine is decisively resolved, there \r\ncan be no guarantee of peace and stability in the \r\nMiddle East. \r\n We express serious concern about the grave \r\nhumanitarian situation in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritory, in particular Gaza. With the onset of winter, \r\nthe humanitarian situation in Gaza may continue to \r\ndeteriorate. We appeal to all parties concerned to \r\nresolutely implement Security Council resolution 1860 \r\n(2009), and urge Israel to open all border crossings in \r\nresponse to the international community’s appeal and \r\nto allow humanitarian and reconstruction materials \r\nenter Gaza without hindrance so as to facilitate Gaza’s \r\nprompt reconstruction. The international community \r\nshould actively provide socio-economic development \r\nassistance to Palestine, speedily honour its \r\ncommitments and alleviate the humanitarian crisis in \r\nGaza. \r\n The Palestinian people of the West Bank and East \r\nJerusalem also deserve our sympathy. Israel continues \r\nto expand its settlements and to construct the \r\nseparation wall. Its violations of its obligations under \r\ninternational law do not promote its own security. We \r\ncall on Israel to completely cease the construction of \r\nsettlements and the separation wall, lift all obstructions \r\nto the movement of the Palestinian people and cease \r\nany action that might complicate the situation of \r\nJerusalem. \r\n The content of the report of the United Nations \r\nFact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict to the \r\nHuman Rights Council (A/HRC/12/48) is a source of \r\nconcern. Violence and all actions that violate \r\ninternational human rights law are unacceptable. We \r\ncall on both sides to carry out independent and credible \r\ninvestigations of the actions that gravely violated \r\ninternational law.  \r\n Achieving comprehensive, just and lasting peace \r\nis the common expectation of the international \r\ncommunity. We have always believed that political \r\nnegotiation is the only correct way and that the use of \r\nforce cannot lead to a solution. At a time when the \r\nMiddle East peace process still faces various \r\nchallenges, we hope that the two sides can reaffirm \r\ntheir faith in the peace negotiations, adhere to the path \r\nto peace, overcome differences and obstacles, resume \r\nnegotiations as soon as possible and desist from taking \r\nany action that might undermine trust and harm the \r\npeace process. We support the demands of the \r\nPalestinian people for their inalienable rights and for \r\nthe establishment of an independent country. We hope \r\nthat the Palestinian factions can reconcile as soon as \r\npossible. \r\n Meanwhile, the international community should \r\ncontinue to strive to promote peace in the Middle East. \r\nWe support the two sides on the basis of the relevant \r\nGeneral Assembly and Security Council resolutions, \r\nthe principle of land for peace and the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative in order to achieve, by means of negotiation, \r\nthe two-State solution whereby Arabs and Jews can \r\nlive side by side in peace.  \r\n The international community should continue to \r\nfocus on the other issues in the Middle East peace \r\nprocess. We welcome the significant progress in the \r\nsituation of Lebanon. We hope that the Lebanese \r\nparties can uphold the Doha agreement, strengthen \r\ntheir unity and make common efforts to safeguard \r\nnational peace, stability and development. We respect \r\nthe sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity \r\nof Lebanon and call on all parties to implement \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1701 (2006). The \r\nnegotiations between Syria and Israel and Lebanon and \r\nIsrael are important components of the peace process. \r\nWe hope that the parties can work together to create \r\nconditions conducive to the resumption of the \r\nnegotiations.  \r\n China has always supported an early, just and \r\nlasting settlement of the Middle East issue. We have \r\nsupported and actively participated in the efforts of the \r\n A/64/PV.52\r\n \r\n25 09-62559 \r\n \r\ninternational community to promote peace, stability \r\nand development, including by providing economic \r\nand humanitarian assistance to the best of our ability. \r\nChina will remain committed to promoting the Middle \r\nEast peace process and is ready to work with the rest of \r\nthe international community in playing a constructive \r\nrole in order to achieve the two-State solution and a \r\ncomprehensive, just and lasting peace. \r\n Mr. Jomaa (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nYesterday, we all observed the International Day of \r\nSolidarity with the Palestinian People, an occasion that \r\nreminds us of the continuing daily suffering of the \r\nbrotherly Palestinian people and the tragic situation \r\nthat necessitates the further intensive efforts of the \r\ninternational community and all relevant parties to find \r\nan immediate and appropriate solution to the crisis in \r\nthe occupied Palestinian territories. \r\n We observe the International Day at a time when \r\nthe situation in the occupied Palestinian territories is \r\nseriously deteriorating, owing to Israel’s ongoing \r\nactions against the brotherly Palestinian people, \r\nincluding its siege, confiscation of land, violation of \r\nholy places and excessive settlement expansion \r\npolicies. Israel’s actions also create impossible \r\nconditions that set up additional obstacles to \r\nrevitalizing the peace process at a time when the \r\ninternational community is trying to support the \r\nnegotiation process so as to achieve peace, stability \r\nand security in the region. \r\n Our country believes in the principles of right, \r\njustice and international legitimacy, upholds the \r\nprinciples of international law and has always \r\nsupported the just Palestinian cause. Tunisia wishes to \r\nreaffirm once again from this rostrum its consistent \r\nsupport for the struggle of the heroic Palestinian people \r\nand expresses its full solidarity with their struggle to \r\nrecover their legitimate national rights and to establish \r\nan independent State on their own territory. \r\n President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali has \r\nconsistently affirmed, in various regional and \r\ninternational forums and on numerous national \r\noccasions, the importance of the Palestinian cause, \r\nwhich we consider to be our primary issue and to \r\nwhich we give special attention. In his message on the \r\noccasion of the International Day of Solidarity, the \r\nPresident also wrote: \r\n  “Tunisia is anxious to see all the legitimate \r\nrights of the fraternal Palestinian people restored \r\nto them. We therefore renew our call to all \r\ninternational parties concerned to step up their \r\nefforts to compel Israel to comply with the \r\nrequirements for peace. These include, primarily, \r\nbringing a complete halt to settlement activities \r\nand to attempts to change the geographic and \r\ndemographic status of the city of Jerusalem, and \r\nacknowledging the right of the Palestinian people \r\nto establish an independent State within its own \r\nborders and in the framework of a just, \r\ncomprehensive and lasting settlement based on \r\ninternational law, the terms of reference of the \r\npeace process, the Arab Peace Initiative and the \r\ntwo-State solution.” \r\n The President also emphasized in his message \r\n  “the continued support of Tunisia for the \r\nefforts of the United Nations and various \r\ninternational parties to put an end to the suffering \r\nof the Palestinian people and to enable them to \r\nrealize their aspirations to sovereignty, \r\nindependence and a dignified life in their own \r\nterritories in peace and stability”. \r\n The Secretary-General’s recent report to the \r\nSecurity Council on the peaceful settlement of the \r\nquestion of Palestine (A/64/351) contains information \r\nthat has caused grave concern. The General Assembly \r\nreferred to that same information in warning that the \r\ndeadlock in the peace process presaged growing \r\ninsecurity and the further deterioration of the \r\nhumanitarian situation in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritory.  \r\n It is thus the collective and historical \r\nresponsibility of the States Members of this \r\ninternational Organization to seek to avoid a recurrence \r\nof the crises, such as Israel’s incursion into the Gaza \r\nStrip, that have worsened the tragic situation in the \r\nMiddle East in general and the Palestinian territories in \r\nparticular. That incursion into Gaza resulted in grave \r\nloss of life and property and was the subject of the \r\nreport of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on \r\nthe Gaza Conflict (A/HRC/12/48), led by Judge \r\nRichard Goldstone, which made recommendations that \r\nthe General Assembly incorporated into resolution \r\n64/10, adopted on 5 November. \r\n Tunisia calls on all influential parties, particularly \r\nthe Quartet, to take effective measures to put an end to \r\nthe suffering of the Palestinian people and their tragic \r\nsituation. We also emphasize the need to compel Israel \r\nA/64/PV.52  \r\n \r\n09-62559 26 \r\n \r\nto end its illegitimate practices and aggressive policies \r\ntowards the Palestinian people. We also call on the \r\ninternational community as a whole to consolidate, \r\nstrengthen and support the negotiations in order to \r\nachieve the peace sought by all peoples of the region \r\non the basis of international law, the relevant \r\nresolutions of the Security Council and the General \r\nAssembly, and the Arab Peace Initiative. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to express my \r\ncountry’s appreciation for the Organization’s continued \r\nefforts in support of the Palestinian cause, and \r\nparticularly those of the United Nations Relief and \r\nWorks Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East \r\nand the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable \r\nRights of the Palestinian People. \r\n  The meeting rose at 1.05 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
