(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) \r\n \r\n \r\n The meeting was called to order at 10.25 a.m. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 16 (continued) \r\n \r\nQuestion of Palestine \r\n \r\n  Draft resolutions (A/64/L.20, A/64/L.21, \r\nA/64/L.22 and A/64/L.23) \r\n \r\n The President: Members will recall that the \r\nAssembly held the debate on this item at its 51st to \r\n53rd plenary meetings, on 30 November and \r\n1 December 2009. \r\n Before the Assembly takes action on the draft \r\nresolutions one by one, I wish to remind members that \r\nthey will have an opportunity to explain their votes on \r\nall of the draft resolutions before and after action is \r\ntaken on each one.  \r\n We shall now proceed to consider draft resolutions \r\nA/64/L.20, A/64/L.21, A/64/L.22 and A/64/L.23. Before \r\ngiving the floor to the speaker in explanation of vote \r\nbefore the voting, may I remind delegations that \r\nexplanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and \r\nshould be made by delegations from their seats. \r\n I now give the floor to the representative of the \r\nUnited States of America. \r\n Mr. Erdman (United States of America): With \r\nrespect to the situation in the Middle East, the United \r\nStates has clearly stated our policy that there should be \r\ntwo States, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in \r\npeace and security. Therefore, we are deeply saddened \r\nto be presented once again with unbalanced draft \r\nresolutions that, unlike the General Assembly’s action \r\nwith respect to any other Member State, geographic \r\narea or issue, place demands on Israel while failing to \r\nacknowledge that both sides have obligations and must \r\ntake difficult steps.  \r\n While the United States accepts the principle that \r\nthe General Assembly may look into the practices of \r\nindividual States, the draft resolutions under this \r\nagenda item, in combination with over 15 other draft \r\nresolutions that will come before the Assembly this \r\nyear — as every year — form a clear pattern of \r\ninstitutional bias directed at one Member State of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n Of particular concern to the United States are \r\nthree resolutions concerning entities established more \r\nthan a generation ago that perpetuate institutional bias. \r\nThe millions of dollars expended on the Secretariat’s \r\nDivision for Palestinian Rights, the Committee on the \r\nExercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian \r\nPeople and the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli \r\nPractices Affecting the Human Rights of the \r\nPalestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied \r\nTerritories could be better directed towards more \r\npressing issues, including direct assistance to needy \r\nPalestinians, as could the staff resources taken up by \r\nthose entities. The United States provides significant \r\nfinancial support to the Palestinian Authority and to \r\nPalestinian refugees receiving support from the United \r\nNations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine \r\nRefugees in the Near East, to which the United States \r\nis the largest single donor. We reiterate our call for all \r\nA/64/PV.54  \r\n \r\n09-62820 2 \r\n \r\nMember States to review seriously the continued \r\nexistence of those bodies, with a sharp focus on what, \r\nif anything, they actually contribute towards a solution \r\nto the Middle East conflict. \r\n In addition to these three draft resolutions, the \r\nGeneral Assembly will consider other draft resolutions \r\nthat prejudge the outcome of permanent status issues. \r\nThose issues properly belong in bilateral negotiations. \r\nResolutions such as these call into question the \r\ncredibility of the United Nations, which, through the \r\nQuartet, has an important role to play in supporting the \r\nresolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict. \r\n We believe that through good-faith negotiations \r\nthe parties can mutually agree on an outcome that ends \r\nthe conflict and reconciles the Palestinians’ goal of an \r\nindependent and viable State based on the 1967 lines \r\nwith agreed territorial swaps, and the Israeli goal of a \r\nJewish State with secure and recognized borders that \r\nreflect subsequent developments and that meet Israeli \r\nsecurity requirements. Our commitment to achieving a \r\nsolution, with two States living side by side in peace, is \r\nunwavering. \r\n The President: We have heard the only speaker \r\nin explanation of vote before the voting. \r\n The Assembly will now take decisions on draft \r\nresolutions A/64/L.20, A/64/L.21, A/64/L.22 and \r\nA/64/L.23. I give the floor to the representative of the \r\nSecretariat to make an announcement. \r\n Mr. Botnaru (Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management): Before the Assembly \r\nproceeds to take action on the draft resolutions, I \r\nwould like to announce that, since their introduction, \r\nGuinea has become a sponsor of draft resolutions \r\nA/64/L.21, A/64/L.22 and A/64/L.23. \r\n The President: We turn first to draft resolution \r\nA/64/L.20, entitled “Committee on the Exercise of the \r\nInalienable Rights of the Palestinian People”.

They reflect a one-sided \r\npolitical agenda that has been traditionally repeated \r\nhere year in and year out. They are unhelpful to the \r\nconflict, where one side is only right while the other \r\nonly has obligations.  \r\n The peoples in our region need peace based on \r\nmutual recognition that is the result of direct bilateral \r\nnegotiations, which should be resumed as soon as \r\npossible and without preconditions. Our region does \r\nnot need annual biased, unbalanced and one-sided \r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions. Instead, the Middle East \r\nrequires an agreement that will enable us to live side \r\nby side in peace and security. \r\n Mr. McLay (New Zealand): New Zealand wished \r\nto explain its vote on two resolutions, namely, \r\nresolution 64/17, on the Division for Palestinian Rights \r\nof the Secretariat, and resolution 64/18, on the special \r\ninformation programme on the question of Palestine of \r\nthe Department of Public Information of the Secretariat. \r\n New Zealand has consistently and strongly \r\nsupported negotiations towards a two-State solution to \r\nthe Middle East conflict — namely, a viable, \r\ncontiguous Palestinian State living side by side with \r\nIsrael in peace and security. As we have previously \r\nexplained, New Zealand believes that it is essential to \r\napproach the issues raised in those resolutions with \r\nbalance and with regard for the overall purpose and \r\nintent of the text in question. \r\n With regard to the resolution on the special \r\ninformation programme, New Zealand supports the \r\ndissemination of balanced and objective information on \r\nthe conflict in the Middle East. We welcome the \r\nresolution’s focus on promoting dialogue and \r\nunderstanding between Palestinians and Israelis. \r\nAlthough we voted in favour of the resolution, we call \r\non the Department of Public Information’s special \r\ninformation programme to carry out its mandate in a \r\nmanner that reflects the full spectrum of perspectives \r\non the question of Palestine, particularly those of both \r\nIsrael and Palestine. \r\n On the resolution on the Division for Palestinian \r\nRights, New Zealand is not convinced that the Division \r\nis a constructive use of resources, and we think it does \r\nlittle to contribute to the Middle East peace process. \r\nThat we voted against the resolution does not detract, \r\nhowever, from our strong support for Palestinian self-\r\ndetermination and for the continuation of negotiations \r\nleading to a two-State solution. \r\n Ms. Måwe (Sweden): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of the European Union (EU).  \r\n The European Union wishes to make to following \r\nexplanation of vote with regard to resolution 64/19, on \r\nthe peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine. \r\n The European Union urges the Palestinian \r\nAuthority and the Government of Israel to enter into \r\nserious peace negotiations as soon as possible while \r\nrespecting international law and previous agreements \r\nand implementing their road map obligations. We \r\nhereby reiterate the need to ensure a political solution, \r\nwith two States — Israel and an independent, \r\ndemocratic and viable Palestinian State — living side \r\nby side in peace and security. \r\n We welcome the United States Administration’s \r\ncommitment to pursue vigorously a two-State solution \r\nand a comprehensive peace in the Middle East. The EU \r\nis ready to work with the parties to the conflict, as well \r\nas with the United States and other Quartet members \r\nand Arab partners, to achieve that goal. \r\n The European Union remains deeply concerned at \r\nthe continued settlement activities, house demolitions \r\nand evictions in the occupied Palestinian territories, \r\nincluding in East Jerusalem. The EU reiterates that the \r\nsettlements are illegal under international law and \r\nconstitute an obstacle to peace.  \r\n The European Union is also concerned about the \r\nrecent developments in East Jerusalem. We have been \r\nfollowing closely the situation around the Al-Aqsa \r\nmosque, the Temple Mount and Al-Haram Al-Sharif. We \r\nurge all parties to refrain from any provocative actions \r\nthat could further inflame tensions or lead to violence. \r\n The EU remains gravely concerned about the \r\nhumanitarian situation in Gaza and what is described \r\nas, in effect, amounting to a blockade. While \r\nacknowledging that crossings are open for the delivery \r\nof some basic humanitarian supplies on a relatively \r\nfrequent basis, they remain at an insufficient level to \r\nmeet the needs of the population. The EU has \r\nconsistently called for the immediate and unconditional \r\nopening of crossings for the flow of humanitarian aid, \r\ncommercial goods and persons to and from Gaza, \r\nwithout which the unimpeded delivery of humanitarian \r\nA/64/PV.54  \r\n \r\n09-62820 6 \r\n \r\naid, reconstruction and economic recovery will not be \r\npossible. \r\n The President: We have heard the last speaker in \r\nexplanation of vote after the voting. The General \r\nAssembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 16. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 15 (continued) \r\n \r\nThe situation in the Middle East \r\n \r\n  Draft resolutions (A/64/L.24 and A/64/L.25) \r\n \r\n The President: Members will recall that the \r\nAssembly held the debate on this item at its 53rd \r\nplenary meeting, on 1 December 2009. \r\n Before the Assembly takes action on the draft \r\nresolutions one by one, I should like to remind \r\nmembers that they will have an opportunity to explain \r\ntheir votes on the two draft resolutions before and after \r\naction is taken on both of them.  \r\n The Assembly will now take decisions on draft \r\nresolutions A/64/L.24 and A/64/L.25.

I wish in \r\nparticular to explain the votes of our delegations with \r\nregard to resolution 64/21, entitled “The Syrian \r\nGolan”, which the General Assembly adopted just a \r\nfew moments ago. \r\n Brazil and Argentina both voted in favour of the \r\nresolution, for we believe that its crucial nature is \r\nlinked to the illegality of the acquisition of territory by \r\nforce. Article 2, paragraph 4, of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations prohibits the use or threat of use of \r\nforce against the territorial integrity of a State. That is \r\nan imperative norm of international law.  \r\n I should also like to clarify the position of our \r\ndelegations with regard to paragraph 6 of the \r\nresolution. Our votes do not prejudge the provisions of \r\nthat paragraph, and in particular the reference to the \r\nline of 4 June 1967. \r\n Brazil and Argentina believe that it is important \r\nto make progress in the search for a solution on the \r\nSyrian-Israeli track of the Middle East conflict, with a \r\nview to putting an end to the occupation of the Golan \r\nHeights in line with Security Council resolutions 242 \r\n(1967) and 338 (1973). I should therefore like to take \r\nthis opportunity, on behalf of the Governments of \r\nBrazil and Argentina, to once again urge Israeli and \r\nSyrian authorities to renew negotiations in order to find \r\na definite solution to the situation in the Syrian Golan, \r\nin line with resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and \r\nthe principle of land for peace. \r\n Mr. Salsabili (Islamic Republic of Iran): I wish \r\nto place on record here in the General Assembly that \r\nmy delegation has voted in favour of all the resolutions \r\nadopted today under the agenda item entitled \r\n“Question of Palestine”, namely, resolutions 64/16, \r\nA/64/PV.54  \r\n \r\n09-62820 8 \r\n \r\n64/17, 64/18 and 64/19. We have also voted in favour \r\nof resolutions 64/20 and 64/21, which were adopted \r\nunder agenda item 15, entitled “The situation in the \r\nMiddle East”. We have done so in the spirit of \r\nsolidarity with the Palestinian people and their cause, \r\nas well as in solidarity with other peoples under \r\noccupation.  \r\n However, I would like to express my delegation’s \r\nreservations on those parts of the resolutions that may \r\nnot be in line with the stated policies and positions of \r\nmy country, or that may be construed as recognition of \r\nthe Israeli regime. \r\n The President: We have heard the last speaker in \r\nexplanation of vote after the voting. \r\n Mr. Ja’afari (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): My country’s delegation would like to express \r\nits deep gratitude and appreciation for the General \r\nAssembly’s majority adoption of resolution 64/21, \r\nentitled “The Syrian Golan”. The Assembly has done \r\nso for many years now, since 1991, in order to promote \r\njustice, right and law,. I am also grateful for the \r\nadoption of the other resolutions concerning the \r\nquestion of Palestine and the situation in the Middle \r\nEast. \r\n That the international community has continued \r\nto support those resolutions is a clear reflection of the \r\ncommitment of Member States to the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations. It also \r\nreflects their rejection of foreign occupation as well as \r\ntheir support of our right to recover our territory, which \r\nhas now been occupied by Israel since 5 June 1967, \r\nmore than 40 years. \r\n There is no doubt whatever that the affirmative \r\nvotes for the resolutions were intended to send a clear \r\nmessage from the international community to Israel, \r\nthe occupying Power in the Golan, Palestine and parts \r\nof Lebanon, that it rejects all expansionist policies and \r\npolicies of occupation, aggression and killing, the \r\nconstruction of settlements, the imposition of fait \r\naccompli situations and the annexation of the territory \r\nof others by force. Those policies and practices are \r\nrejected, as they violate the Charter and the 1949 \r\nFourth Geneva Convention. The entire international \r\ncommunity has thereby condemned those policies and \r\npractices.  \r\n The world is unanimous in its belief that just and \r\ncomprehensive peace can be established only on the \r\nbasis of the principles of peace and international \r\nresolutions. By definition that means that there is a \r\nneed for an Israeli partner with whom peace can be \r\nestablished. That partner does not exist today. It also \r\nillustrates the international community’s belief that all \r\noccupied Arab territories, included Syrian Golan, \r\nshould be restored to the 4 June 1967 borders and that \r\nan independent Palestinian State, with Jerusalem as its \r\ncapital, must be established. The ongoing Israeli \r\noccupation is counter to peace and underscores the \r\nneed for all resources to be mobilized in order to end \r\nthe occupation. \r\n I would like to reiterate Syria’s gratitude to all \r\nthe States that sponsored the resolution entitled “The \r\nSyrian Golan”. I also wish to thank all countries that \r\nvoted in favour. Lastly, I would like to emphasize my \r\ncountry’s call for the establishment of a just and \r\ncomprehensive peace. More than ever before, Syria is \r\ndetermined to liberate the occupied Golan to the 4 June \r\n1967 borders and to rid it of Israeli occupation through \r\nevery means guaranteed by international law.  \r\n The President: I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Palestine. \r\n Mr. Mansour (Palestine): Palestine would like to \r\nexpress its gratitude to all those who sponsored the \r\nresolutions related to the question of Palestine and the \r\nsituation in the Middle East, as well as all those who \r\nvoted in their favour. We view the adoption of those \r\nresolutions as a very strong signal from the General \r\nAssembly both with regard to upholding international \r\nlaw and reaffirming very clear principles. \r\n We hope, and will work diligently to ensure, that \r\nthe Israeli side will comply with the essence of these \r\nresolutions, which are rooted in international law and \r\nthe civilized conduct of nations. We do not see \r\nupholding international law and reaffirming those \r\nprinciples as conditions. What we see as illegal, and as \r\nobstacles to peace, is unilateral action in building \r\nillegal settlements, the construction of an illegal wall \r\nand the annexation of East Jerusalem. And if the Israeli \r\noccupying authority thinks that they can take us for a \r\nride, forcing us to negotiate on the basis of their \r\nconditions, creating all those unilateral, illegal actions, \r\nthey will have a long time to wait. They must abide by \r\ntheir obligations under international law and by the \r\nessence of the resolutions of the General Assembly and \r\nthe Security Council. \r\n A/64/PV.54\r\n \r\n9 09-62820 \r\n \r\n We are eager to move forward in the direction of \r\npeace, as we have demonstrated all along by fulfilling \r\nall of our obligations. We do not see similar behaviour \r\non the Israeli side. And for those who think that these \r\nresolutions are one-sided, they have to recall that this \r\nstrong message is sent by almost the entire membership \r\nof the United Nations. We cannot all of us be wrong. \r\nWe cannot all of us be selecting Israel as a target. Israel \r\nis acting and behaving as if it were above international \r\nlaw, and it is getting away with it. It is high time for all \r\nof us to bring Israel into compliance with international \r\nlaw and the essence of these resolutions. \r\n The one-sided action is that of the Israeli side, \r\nwhich is building illegal settlements and creating the \r\nreality on the ground. Its actions are much stronger \r\nthan resolutions. Although these resolutions defend \r\ninternational law and the rights of the Palestinian \r\npeople, the action of the Israeli side, which should be \r\ncondemned and which we should seek to stop, could be \r\nthe most important contribution to the peace process so \r\nthat all obstacles could be removed from the path of \r\nthe peace negotiations and the occupation brought to \r\nan end, allowing the Palestinian people to enjoy \r\nfreedom and sovereignty in their own independent \r\nPalestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital. \r\n We hope that, collectively, we can find a way to \r\nbring Israel into compliance so that we can put an end \r\nto the tragedy of the Palestinian people and allow them \r\nto exercise self-determination and have their own \r\nindependent State in Palestine. \r\n We wish to thank all members for the strong \r\nmessage they are sending to our people, who continue \r\nin their struggle. They will not cease in their struggle \r\nuntil they succeed in putting an end to the occupation \r\nand realizing their aspiration for an independent State \r\nof Palestine.  \r\n The President: The General Assembly has thus \r\nconcluded this stage of its consideration of agenda \r\nitem 15. \r\n The meeting rose at 11.05 a.m. \r\n"
