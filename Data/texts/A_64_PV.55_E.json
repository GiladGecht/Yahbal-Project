(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) \r\n \r\n \r\n The meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m. \r\n \r\nReports of the First Committee \r\n \r\n The President: The General Assembly will now \r\ntake up the reports of the First Committee on agenda \r\nitems 86 to 103, 118 and 133. \r\n I now request Ms. Tetyana Pokhval’ona of \r\nUkraine, Rapporteur of the First Committee, to \r\nintroduce the reports of the First Committee in one \r\nintervention. \r\n Ms. Pokhval’ona (Ukraine), Rapporteur of the \r\nFirst Committee: It gives me great pleasure to \r\nintroduce to the General Assembly the reports of the \r\nFirst Committee on agenda items 86 to 103 and 118 \r\nand 133. Those reports are contained in documents \r\nA/64/381 through A/64/400. \r\n In response to the General Assembly’s appeal, the \r\nFirst Committee continued to fully utilize its existing \r\nresources and was able to conclude its work at the \r\ncurrent session in four weeks and one day, with 23 \r\nformal meetings. The work of the Committee at the \r\npresent session could be characterized as procedurally \r\nsmooth and substantively constructive, more focused \r\nand action-oriented than in past sessions. \r\n The First Committee had before it 49 draft \r\nresolutions and 5 draft decisions submitted under \r\nvarious disarmament and related international security \r\nagenda items for its consideration. Of all adopted texts, \r\n29 draft resolutions and 4 draft decisions, or almost \r\n60 per cent, were adopted without a vote. \r\n As at previous sessions, the whole complex of \r\nissues related to weapons of mass destruction, \r\nparticularly nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation \r\nissues, including the prevention of terrorists from \r\nacquiring nuclear technologies and other weapons of \r\nmass destruction, were by far the most important \r\nsubjects. Out of the 54 adopted draft texts, 19 draft \r\nresolutions were on nuclear issues and 3 on other \r\nweapons of mass destruction. \r\n Turning to the meetings of the First Committee, \r\nseveral new trends were evident. First, statements \r\nmade by the delegations were devoted due attention to \r\nthe existing stockpiles of weapons, in general, and \r\nweapons of mass destruction, in particular. While the \r\nfocus was on nuclear, chemical, biological weapons \r\nand on small arms and light weapons, a renewed sense \r\nof urgency and readiness to act with an unprecedented \r\ndegree of cooperation on all outstanding disarmament \r\nand related issues was clearly visible. \r\n On the one hand, that development is the result of \r\nan ongoing process of reconsideration of positions by \r\nMember States on disarmament and security issues. On \r\nthe other hand, it is rooted in comprehension of the \r\nneed to redouble efforts aimed at working out \r\nsubstantive and tangible disarmament measures. \r\n It was this new action-oriented approach that \r\nprovided a background for discussions on the entire \r\ncomplex of issues related to nuclear weapons. Thus, \r\nMember States increasingly focused on aspects of \r\nnuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament that \r\nneed to be addressed on a priority basis in the \r\nA/64/PV.55  \r\n \r\n09-62827 2 \r\n \r\nimmediate future. In that context, delegations focused \r\non the further efforts needed to scale down nuclear \r\nweapons at both the unilateral and the bilateral levels. \r\nThey noted that in the atmosphere of reasonable \r\nexpectations, which is prevailing in anticipation of the \r\nReview Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, it is even more \r\nimportant to take a fresh look at nuclear disarmament \r\nwith a view to adopting new innovative and daring \r\napproaches. \r\n Here, the practical underpinnings of operative \r\nmilitary postures and measures for preventing weapons \r\nfrom falling into the hands of terrorists were highly \r\nvisible. Those concerns were reflected in a number of \r\ndraft resolutions regarding, inter alia, the conclusion of \r\na convention on the prohibition of the use of nuclear \r\nweapons, reducing nuclear danger, renewed \r\ndetermination to achieve the total elimination of \r\nnuclear weapons, nuclear disarmament, the \r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the \r\nFissile Material Cut-off Treaty. \r\n For the first time, the draft resolution on the \r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was \r\nco-sponsored by all permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council. After 10 years of failure and \r\ndisappointment, the Conference on Disarmament \r\nadopted its programme of work, which includes the \r\ndifficult issue of the fissile material cut-off treaty. \r\nFinally, substantive discussion has started on an arms \r\ntrade treaty, which resulted in adoption of a draft \r\nresolution on the subject with overwhelming support \r\nfrom Member States. In addition to the agreement on \r\nthe fissile material cut-off treaty, a number of events \r\ncontributed to this end, in particular, the decision of the \r\nRussian Federation and the United States to renew \r\nnegotiations on further reduction of their nuclear \r\narsenals and the successful conclusion of a meeting on \r\narticle XIV of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban \r\nTreaty in New York. Those are just two important \r\ndevelopments, but there are many others. \r\n Visible progress in the area of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction in general and nuclear weapons in \r\nparticular did not overshadow or somehow diminish \r\nthe importance of other vital disarmament and \r\ninternational security issues such as small arms and \r\nlight weapons, the universalization of existing legal \r\ninstruments and the role assigned to multilateralism in \r\ndisarmament. On the contrary, draft resolutions on \r\nthose issues enjoyed the increasing support of Member \r\nStates. \r\n The overall tone of the concrete results-oriented \r\napproach was clearly evident during the thematic \r\ndebate stage. Panel discussions and interactive \r\ndialogues with the participation of high-level officials \r\nof major international disarmament bodies, such as the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, the Preparatory \r\nCommission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban \r\nTreaty Organization, the Organization for the \r\nProhibition of Chemical Weapons, the Conference on \r\nDisarmament and others, were also aimed at the \r\nconceptual and practical aspects of national and \r\ninternational security. \r\n In the course of the general debate, 100 \r\ndelegations, including four observers and one \r\nrepresentative of a specialized agency, made \r\nstatements. Among those speaking, six spoke on behalf \r\nof various groups. More than 140 delegations made \r\nstatements within the framework of the thematic \r\ndiscussions. These numbers that I have cited are \r\nunprecedented. Another contributing factor was the \r\nsustained level of support from civil society for greater \r\nprogress on a wide range of disarmament issues. \r\n Before concluding, I should like to pay a well \r\ndeserved tribute to all delegations for their active \r\nparticipation in the work of the Committee and for \r\ntheir spirit of cooperation in the common search for a \r\nbetter, safer and more stable world. I should like to \r\nexpress special gratitude to the Chairman of the First \r\nCommittee, Mr. José Luis Cancela, who, with his \r\ncomprehensive knowledge of disarmament and \r\ninternational security matters as well as his general \r\ndiplomatic skills, led the proceedings of the Committee \r\nwith vision and able leadership. Let me also, on behalf \r\nof the Committee and on my own behalf, extend our \r\nsincere gratitude to the Committee’s Vice-Chairmen, \r\nAmbassador Hilario Davide of the Philippines, \r\nMr. Hossam Aly of Egypt and Mr. Florian Laudi of \r\nGermany, for their most effective contribution to the \r\nwork of the Committee. I should also like to express \r\nmy appreciation to Mr. Sergio Duarte, High \r\nRepresentative for Disarmament Affairs, and \r\nMr. Shaaban Muhammad Shaaban, Under-Secretary-\r\nGeneral for General Assembly and Conference \r\nManagement, for their leadership and contributions, as \r\nwell as to the Secretariat staff that assisted the \r\nCommittee.  \r\n A/64/PV.55\r\n \r\n3 09-62827 \r\n \r\n Moreover, special thanks go to the Acting \r\nSecretary of the First Committee, Mr. Timur Alasaniya, \r\nwhose vast experience and high degree of competence \r\nmade a significant contribution to the successful \r\noutcome of the Committee’s work. In that connection I \r\nshould also like to express my gratitude to Mr. Sergei \r\nCherniavsky, Ms. Emer Herity, Ms. Tatyana \r\nShestakova and other members of the Secretariat for \r\ntheir valuable assistance to the Committee. \r\n With these brief remarks, I present the reports of \r\nthe First Committee to the General Assembly for \r\nconsideration and approval, as contained in documents \r\nA/64/381 through A/64/400. \r\n The President: I thank the Rapporteur of the \r\nFirst Committee for her introduction of the reports of \r\nthe Committee. \r\n If there is no proposal under rule 66 of the \r\nAssembly’s rules of procedure, I shall take it that the \r\nGeneral Assembly decides not to discuss the reports of \r\nthe First Committee that are before it today. \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President: Statements will therefore be \r\nlimited to explanations of vote. The positions of \r\ndelegations regarding the recommendations of the First \r\nCommittee have been made clear in the Committee and \r\nare reflected in the relevant official records. \r\n May I remind members that, in accordance with \r\nGeneral Assembly decision 34/401, a delegation \r\nshould, as far as possible, explain its vote only once, \r\nthat is, either in the Committee or in plenary meeting, \r\nunless that delegation’s vote in plenary meeting is \r\ndifferent from its vote in the Committee, and that \r\nexplanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and \r\nshould be made by delegations from their seats. \r\n Before we begin to take action on the \r\nrecommendations contained in the reports of the First \r\nCommittee, I should like to advise representatives that \r\nwe are going to proceed to take decisions in the same \r\nmanner as was done in the Committee, unless the \r\nAssembly is notified otherwise in advance. This means \r\nthat where separate or recorded votes were taken, we \r\nwill do the same. I should also hope that we may \r\nproceed to adopt without a vote those \r\nrecommendations that were adopted without a vote in \r\nthe First Committee. \r\n Before proceeding further, I would like to draw \r\nthe attention of members to a note by the Secretariat \r\nentitled “Situation reports of the First Committee on \r\nagenda items 86 to 103”, which has been circulated in \r\nEnglish only as document A/C.1/64/INF/3. This note \r\nhas been distributed desk-to-desk in the General \r\nAssembly Hall as the reference guide for action on \r\ndraft resolutions and decisions recommended by the \r\nFirst Committee in its reports. In that connection, \r\nmembers will find in column 2 of the note the numbers \r\nof the draft resolutions or decisions of the First \r\nCommittee, with the corresponding numbers for action \r\nin the plenary in column 5 of the same note.  \r\n Furthermore, members are reminded that \r\nadditional sponsors are no longer accepted, now that \r\ndraft resolutions and decisions have been adopted in \r\nthe Committee. Any clarification about co-sponsorship \r\nin the Committee reports should be addressed to the \r\nSecretary of the Committee. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 86 \r\n \r\nReduction of military budgets \r\n \r\n  Report of the First Committee (A/64/381) \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly has before it a \r\ndraft resolution recommended by the First Committee \r\nin paragraph 8 of its report. We will now take a \r\ndecision on the draft resolution, entitled “Objective \r\ninformation on military matters, including transparency \r\nof military expenditures”. The First Committee adopted \r\nit without a vote. May I consider that the Assembly \r\nwishes to do the same?  \r\n The draft resolution was adopted (resolution \r\n64/22). \r\n The President: May I take it that it is the wish of \r\nthe General Assembly to conclude its consideration of \r\nagenda item 86? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 87 \r\n \r\nImplementation of the Declaration of the Indian \r\nOcean as a Zone of Peace \r\n \r\n  Report of the First Committee (A/64/382) \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly has before it a \r\ndraft resolution recommended by the First Committee \r\nin paragraph 7 of its report.

The First Committee adopted it \r\nwithout a vote. May I take it that the Assembly wishes \r\nto do the same? \r\n Draft decision I was adopted. \r\n The President: Draft decision II is entitled \r\n“Preventing the acquisition by terrorists of radioactive \r\nmaterials and sources”. The First Committee adopted it \r\nwithout a vote. May I take it that the Assembly wishes \r\nto do the same? \r\n Draft decision II was adopted. \r\n The President: I shall now give the floor to \r\nspeakers who wish to speak in explanation of vote or \r\nposition following the adoption of the resolutions and \r\ndecisions on which the Assembly has just taken action. \r\n Mr. Hallak (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): My country voted in favour of resolution 64/52, \r\nentitled “Second Conference of States Parties and \r\nSignatories to Treaties that Establish Nuclear-Weapon-\r\nFree Zones and Mongolia”. My country supports the \r\nnoble principle of emphasizing the importance of \r\nspecial agreements pertaining to the establishment of \r\nnuclear-weapon-free zones throughout the world.  \r\n In that connection, I should like to refer to our \r\nfirmly held belief in the importance of establishing a \r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, given the \r\nimportance of doing so to regional and international \r\n A/64/PV.55\r\n \r\n27 09-62827 \r\n \r\npeace and security. We would like to congratulate the \r\ncountries in regions that have successfully rid \r\nthemselves of nuclear weapons, and we look forward to \r\nthe fulfilment of a similar request to establish a \r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. I recall \r\nthat on 29 December 2002, Syria, on behalf of the Arab \r\nGroup, submitted a proposal to the Security Council \r\nthat would rid the Middle East of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction, in particular nuclear weapons. That \r\nimportant initiative continues to await implementation.  \r\n The failure to achieve a nuclear-weapon-free \r\nzone in the Middle East stands as a stark illustration of \r\nthe use of double standards and a lack of sincere \r\npolitical will on the part of some. Israel is continuing \r\nits aggressive military policy of building up its large \r\narsenal of both conventional and non-conventional \r\nweapons and weapons of mass destruction, in \r\nparticular nuclear weapons and their means of delivery. \r\n Israel is conducting a dangerous nuclear military \r\nprogramme that threatens the security of the region and \r\nthe world. It is doing so completely without effective \r\nsupervision and in the absence of an international \r\nresponse to its dangerous attitude. It is therefore \r\nenjoying an immoral impunity, which allows it to \r\nundermine all efforts for nuclear disarmament and \r\nnon-proliferation of nuclear weapons in the Middle \r\nEast. That makes the region more vulnerable to threats \r\nand injustices and falsifies truth, serving to exempt \r\nIsrael from the principles of international law and the \r\nNon-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) regime.  \r\n For all these reasons, my delegation wishes to \r\nrecord its opposition to the phrase in the fourth \r\npreambular paragraph, “agreements freely arrived at \r\namong the States of the region concerned”. That \r\nmeans, by definition, that a nuclear-free zone cannot be \r\nestablished in the Middle East, because Israel has no \r\ninterest in such an endeavour. As is well known, there \r\nare specific terms of reference regarding the \r\nestablishment of a nuclear-free zone in the Middle \r\nEast, set out in the resolution on the Middle East \r\nadopted at the NPT Review Conference in 1995 \r\n(NPT/CONF.1995/32 (Part I), Annex). Non-mention of \r\nthis reference gives Israel more room to avoid and \r\nevade the commitment to the establishment of such a \r\nnuclear-free zone. \r\n Mr. Chatel (France) (spoke in French): I would \r\nlike to speak briefly on agenda item 96, especially with \r\nregard to resolutions 64/32, on the relationship \r\nbetween disarmament and development, and 64/33, on \r\nobservance of environmental norms in agreements on \r\ndisarmament and arms control. My delegation wishes \r\nto specify that we did not participate in the decisions \r\non those two resolutions for reasons already alluded to \r\nin the First Committee. \r\n Mr. Torres (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nColombia voted in favour of resolution 64/48, entitled \r\n“The arms trade treaty”, because it is convinced of the \r\nneed for a universal, legally binding instrument \r\nregulating the illicit traffic in conventional arms, \r\nincluding small arms and light weapons, munitions and \r\nexplosives, to prevent them from being diverted to \r\nillegal markets.  \r\n In both the Group of Governmental Experts and \r\nin the Open-ended Working Group, my country \r\nexpressed its opinion that an arms trade treaty must be \r\nbased, first, on recognition that arms control, \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation are essential \r\nelements for international peace and security; secondly, \r\non respect for international law, including human rights \r\nnorms and international humanitarian law; thirdly, on \r\nrespect for the principles enshrined in the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations, particularly the inherent right to \r\nself-defence, sovereignty, equality of all Members and \r\nnon-intervention in internal affairs; and fourthly, on the \r\nright of all States to produce, export, import, transfer \r\nand possess conventional weapons for their legitimate \r\nself-defence.  \r\n Colombia is aware that an arms trade treaty \r\nwithout the participation of all States, particularly \r\nthose playing a significant role in the sale, purchase \r\nand transfer of arms, will affect both its effectiveness \r\nand its full implementation. Likewise, it makes no \r\nsense to negotiate an instrument of this kind at the \r\nglobal level if it does not establish effective controls \r\nover the transfer of arms that go beyond existing \r\nregulations and thus does not create greater \r\ntransparency.  \r\n In the view of my delegation, the absence of \r\ncontrols on the transfer of arms to non-State actors has \r\na negative effect on the internal security of States, \r\nsince such arms can be used to undermine institutions \r\nand the rule of law and to commit crimes against \r\nhumanity and serious violations of international \r\nhumanitarian law. That is why Colombia has advocated \r\nand will continue to advocate the inclusion in the arms \r\nA/64/PV.55  \r\n \r\n09-62827 28 \r\n \r\ntrade treaty of the explicit prohibition of such transfers \r\nby establishing stricter control mechanisms.  \r\n Colombia is pleased that these principles are \r\nreflected in resolution 64/48, entitled, “The arms trade \r\ntreaty”, which the Assembly just adopted by a \r\nconsiderable majority. We reiterate our commitment to \r\nthe work of the preparatory committee established in \r\nthat resolution and to the search, whenever possible, \r\nfor consensus that will lead discussions and \r\nnegotiations to a positive conclusion in the adoption of \r\nan arms trade treaty at the conference scheduled for \r\n2012.  \r\n Finally, my delegation wishes to refer to the \r\nadoption of decisions by consensus in the framework \r\nof the conference that will negotiate the arms trade \r\ntreaty. Colombia is concerned about the interpretation \r\nthat could be given to paragraph 5 of the resolution. \r\nWhile for Colombia it is certainly necessary to seek \r\nagreements that permit progress towards an arms trade \r\ntreaty, we must not lose sight of the fact that consensus \r\ncan become an obstacle to decision-making. \r\n Mrs. Sánchez Quintero (Cuba) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): My delegation wishes to explain its vote on \r\nresolution 64/54, on transparency in armaments. Cuba \r\nabstained in the vote on the resolution as a whole, as \r\nwell as in the separate votes on operative paragraphs 3 \r\nand 6.  \r\n My country believes that transparency in \r\narmaments is an important factor in building a climate \r\nof trust and in decreasing tensions among States, and \r\nwe believe that the United Nations Register of \r\nConventional Arms is a concrete measure that can \r\ncontribute to that objective. However, we observe with \r\nconcern the ever-increasing emphasis on including in \r\nthe Register information on small arms and light \r\nweapons while there is absolutely no progress on \r\nincluding information on weapons of mass destruction, \r\nespecially nuclear weapons.  \r\n We have always stressed the need for the Register \r\nto be balanced, holistic and non-discriminatory. The \r\ninclusion of requests for information on weapons of \r\nmass destruction and transfers of equipment and \r\ntechnology that are directly connected to the \r\ndevelopment and production of such weapons would \r\nmake the Register a more balanced instrument and \r\nwould facilitate its becoming universal. The Register \r\ncannot be an end in itself. It must be a means of \r\nmoving towards the objective of greater security on \r\nnational, regional and international levels for all States \r\non the basis of strict respect for international law.  \r\n The recommendations of the Group of \r\nGovernmental Experts transmitted by the note by the \r\nSecretary-General endorsed by this resolution \r\n(A/64/296) have practical implications that are very \r\nimportant for the future of the Register. It should be \r\npointed out that States have a legitimate right to a \r\nreasonable period of time to assess those \r\nrecommendations, which, because of their very \r\nimplications, require comprehensive analysis by \r\nseveral national bodies linked to the issues of national \r\nsecurity within States. We underline the importance of \r\nusing transparent and participatory procedures. In no \r\nway should acceptance of the recommendations of the \r\nGroup of Governmental Experts be forced on Member \r\nStates without previously giving them the opportunity \r\nto express their views on them and exchange opinions.  \r\n With respect to the closed Group of Experts that \r\nconvenes every three years on the question of the \r\nRegister, we wish to express once again our concern at \r\nthe way in which the concerns of many States are being \r\nignored while a few States are benefiting, without \r\ntaking into account the reasoning and arguments of all. \r\nThat is not a healthy or truly multilateral way of \r\nattaining the necessary consensus on such a delicate \r\nsubject for international peace and security. \r\n Even though my delegation voted in favour of \r\noperative paragraph 6 (d), we wish to put on record \r\nthat, despite the interest expressed by Cuba in being a \r\nmember of that Group in 2005, no Cuban experts were \r\nincluded in it. We hope that in the future the \r\ncomposition of this and other groups of experts \r\nestablished in accordance with resolutions adopted on \r\nthe recommendation of the First Committee will take \r\ninto due account the interest of all Member States in \r\nparticipating.  \r\n The President: The General Assembly has thus \r\nconcluded this stage of its consideration of agenda \r\nitem 96. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 97 \r\n \r\nReview and implementation of the Concluding \r\nDocument of the Twelfth Special Session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly  \r\n \r\n A/64/PV.55\r\n \r\n29 09-62827 \r\n \r\n  Report of the First Committee (A/64/392) \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly has before it six \r\ndraft resolutions recommended by the First Committee \r\nin paragraph 20 of its report.
