(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 10.20 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 76 \r\n \r\nOceans and the law of the sea \r\n \r\n (a) Oceans and the law of the sea \r\n \r\n  Reports of the Secretary-General (A/64/66 and \r\nAdd.1 and Add.2) \r\n \r\n  Report on the results of the assessment of \r\nassessments (A/64/88) \r\n \r\n  Report on the work of the United Nations \r\nOpen-ended Informal Consultative Process on \r\nOceans and the Law of the Sea at its tenth \r\nmeeting (A/64/131) \r\n \r\n  Report on the work of the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup of the Whole to recommend a course of \r\naction to the General Assembly on the regular \r\nprocess for global reporting and assessment of \r\nthe state of the marine environment, including \r\nsocio-economic aspects (A/64/347)  \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/64/L.18 and Corr.1) \r\n \r\n (b) Sustainable fisheries, including through the \r\n1995 Agreement for the Implementation of the \r\nProvisions of the United Nations Convention on \r\nthe Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 \r\nrelating to the Conservation and Management \r\nof Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory \r\nFish Stocks, and related instruments \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/64/305) \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/64/L.29) \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I give the floor \r\nto the representative of the United States of America to \r\nintroduce draft resolution A/64/L.29. \r\n Ms. Ross (United States of America): My \r\ndelegation has the honour to be a sponsor of draft \r\nresolution A/64/L.18, entitled “Oceans and the Law of \r\nthe Sea”. We also have the honour to introduce, on \r\nbehalf of the sponsors, draft resolution A/64/L.29, on \r\nsustainable fisheries. \r\n I should like to begin by expressing appreciation \r\nfor the spirit of cooperation exhibited by delegations \r\ninvolved in crafting both resolutions this year. It is our \r\nhope that that spirit of cooperation will also \r\ncharacterize our efforts to address the numerous and \r\ncomplex issues that lie ahead in the new year. \r\n The United States is very pleased with the \r\nsuccessful outcome of this year’s review in the \r\nInformal Consultative Process on Oceans and the Law \r\nof the Sea. The Process is a useful forum for informing \r\npolicymakers about cutting-edge oceans issues, \r\nincluding their relationship to sustainable development \r\nof the oceans and marine resources. Following this \r\nyear’s review of that Process and agreement on \r\nimprovements to it, we look forward to addressing \r\ncapacity-building in ocean affairs and the law of the \r\nsea, including marine science, in 2010 and other \r\ncritical oceans-related issues in the years beyond. \r\n This year’s resolution on sustainable fisheries \r\nonce again contains important provisions to address \r\nA/64/PV.56  \r\n \r\n09-63342 2 \r\n \r\ncritical issues such as better regulation of destructive \r\nfishing practices, control of illegal, unregulated and \r\nunreported (IUU) fishing, reduction of fishing capacity, \r\nemphasis on science-based conservation and \r\nmanagement measures, implementation of the United \r\nNations Fish Stocks Agreement, strengthened \r\nconservation and management of sharks, and other \r\nimportant matters. However, perhaps the most notable \r\naspect of this year’s resolution is the provisions to \r\nstrengthen and enhance the regulation of bottom-\r\nfishing activities and the impact of such activities on \r\nvulnerable marine ecosystems in areas beyond national \r\njurisdiction. \r\n In 2006, the United States, along with many other \r\ncountries, successfully sought strong provisions in the \r\nsustainable fisheries resolution to address the critical \r\ngap in oceans governance with respect to bottom \r\nfisheries. In our view, the provisions contained in \r\nresolution 61/105 were a landmark step forward for \r\nsustainable bottom fisheries and in protecting fragile \r\nand rare marine ecosystems from adverse impacts of \r\nfishing activities. \r\n In the three years since the adoption of resolution \r\n61/105, the international community has made \r\nsignificant and important progress in implementing the \r\ncalls made in it. This year’s sustainable fisheries draft \r\nresolution reviews the progress in implementing those \r\ncalls and further refines recommendations to assist \r\nStates and regional fisheries management organizations \r\nwith the implementation of those provisions. \r\nDelegations recognized that States and regional \r\nfisheries management organizations and arrangements \r\n(RFMOs) have taken important and tangible steps to \r\nimplement resolution 61/105, including beginning — \r\nand, in the case of the South Pacific, completing — \r\nnegotiations to establish two new RFMOs where they \r\ndo not currently exist. However, delegations also \r\nexpressed concern that implementation has been \r\nuneven and not sufficient in all cases. Therefore, \r\ndelegations crafted language to strengthen and focus \r\naction where it is urgently needed. \r\n As a result, the United States is pleased that this \r\nyear’s sustainable fisheries draft resolution contains a \r\npackage of provisions that clearly articulates what \r\nurgent actions States and RFMOs should take to ensure \r\nfull implementation of resolution 61/105, and that it \r\nencourages enhanced cooperation among States and \r\nRFMOs in achieving that goal. The United States will \r\ncontinue to work with others to advance this issue \r\nthrough the relevant RFMOs and through negotiations \r\nto establish new organizations. \r\n Much work remains if we are to ensure the \r\nsustainability of global fish stocks. RFMOs continue to \r\nbe the best available mechanism for regulating \r\ninternational fisheries. Nonetheless, there is much \r\nroom for improvement within those organizations to \r\nadvance our common goals. To that end, a number of \r\nRFMOs have embarked on systematic reviews of their \r\nperformance. Those efforts must be recognized and \r\ncommended. However, the recommendations of those \r\nreviews must now be implemented to bring about \r\nmuch-needed reform and modernization within \r\nRFMOs. Such reform must also address how States \r\nimplement and enforce the rules that they adopt as \r\nmembers of such organizations. The United States will \r\nbe looking ahead to the United Nations Fish Stocks \r\nAgreement Review Conference, scheduled for May \r\n2010, as a venue to consider that and other critical \r\nissues facing international fisheries. \r\n I wish to thank all the delegations for their hard \r\nwork in the development of the sustainable fisheries \r\ndraft resolution. The United States was once again \r\nproud to provide the coordinator for the informal \r\nconsultations, Ms. Holly Koehler, who led the \r\nnegotiations to their successful conclusion, and we \r\ngreatly thank her for her work to that end. \r\n Mr. Lundkvist (Sweden): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the European Union (EU). The \r\ncandidate countries Croatia and the former Yugoslav \r\nRepublic of Macedonia, the countries of the \r\nStabilization and Association Process and potential \r\ncandidates Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, \r\nMontenegro and Serbia, as well as Ukraine, the \r\nRepublic of Moldova, Armenia and Georgia align \r\nthemselves with this statement. \r\n This year, the European Union has once again \r\ndemonstrated its commitment to the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea and to the 1995 \r\nUnited Nations Fish Stocks Agreement by actively \r\nparticipating in the consultations that led to the draft \r\nresolutions before the General Assembly today. The \r\nEuropean Union believes that the Convention is an \r\nimportant instrument that promotes stability, peace, \r\nprogress and economic and social advancement, in \r\naccordance with the purposes and principles of the \r\nUnited Nations. It therefore holds special significance \r\nin a difficult international context. The European \r\n A/64/PV.56\r\n \r\n3 09-63342 \r\n \r\nUnion would like to reiterate the importance it attaches \r\nto preserving the Convention’s integrity and the \r\nConvention’s pre-eminent role as the legal framework \r\nfor all ocean issues and ocean-related activities. The \r\nEuropean Union calls upon all States to accede to the \r\nConvention and to the Agreement relating to the \r\nimplementation of Part XI of the Convention. \r\n The European Union reiterates the importance it \r\nattaches to the freedom of navigation, the right of \r\ninnocent passage and the right of transit passage in \r\ncompliance with the relevant provisions of the \r\nConvention. The European Union would further like to \r\nreiterate its deep concern about the continued acts of \r\npiracy, which are detrimental to the safety of persons \r\nand property, whether vessels are attacked or hijacked \r\nor prisoners are held for ransom. In view of the \r\nresurgence of such acts, the international community \r\nhas committed itself to combating this scourge within \r\nthe United Nations framework. In that regard, we note \r\nthe efforts of the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast \r\nof Somalia. \r\n Other major challenges remain, such as the \r\ndeclining quality of the marine environment and the \r\ndestruction of natural marine resources. Marine \r\nbiodiversity is being threatened, and time is running \r\nout if we are to meet the deadlines set in the 2002 \r\nJohannesburg Plan of Implementation. The European \r\nUnion remains firmly committed to addressing those \r\nchallenges. \r\n The European Union has repeatedly and in \r\nvarious forums expressed its concerns over the loss of \r\nmarine biodiversity and has supported the initiative \r\ntaken by the General Assembly to create an Ad Hoc \r\nOpen-ended Informal Working Group on the matter. \r\nThe European Union welcomes that the Working \r\nGroup will reconvene in early 2010 and that its \r\nmandate has been confirmed. We also welcome that \r\nStates are invited to further consider issues of marine \r\nprotected areas and environmental assessment \r\nprocesses in the context of the Group’s mandate. The \r\nWorking Group is in a position to make important \r\nrecommendations to the Assembly, with a view to \r\nforging ahead on the sensitive issue of the conservation \r\nand sustainable use of biological diversity beyond \r\nareas of national jurisdiction. \r\n The draft omnibus resolution notes the concerns \r\nraised in relation to the issue of climate change and its \r\neffects on the oceans, seas and natural resources. In \r\nthat regard the EU would have wished to highlight the \r\nstate of the Arctic region as a priority area for research. \r\nWe would also have wished to see a reference to the \r\nforthcoming United Nations Framework Convention on \r\nClimate Change Conference, to be held in Copenhagen \r\nfrom 7 to 18 December 2009. To respond to the debates \r\nwithin the international community, the draft resolution \r\ntakes into account various issues relating to climate \r\nchange, such as eutrophication, acidification, \r\nfertilization, the discharge of carbon dioxide into the \r\natmosphere and greenhouse gases. The international \r\ncommunity for the law of the sea the must take an \r\nactive role in the movement to prevent and combat \r\nclimate change. \r\n At a time when the international scientific \r\ncommunity must inspire the work of States and \r\ninternational organizations, the European Union \r\nrecognizes the relevance of the regular process for \r\nglobal reporting and assessment of the state of the \r\nmarine environment, including socio-economic \r\naspects. We welcome the convening of another meeting \r\nof the Ad Hoc Working Group in 2010, which confirms \r\nthat the real start-up of the first cycle of the process \r\nhas begun. \r\n In 1999 the General Assembly created a useful \r\nand efficient tool for preparing for its debates on \r\noceans and the law of the sea, namely, the Open-ended \r\nInformal Consultative Process on Oceans and the Law \r\nof the Sea. This year, at its ten-year juncture, the focus \r\nof discussion was on the implementation of the \r\noutcome of the Consultative Process. A very useful \r\nreview of its achievements and shortcomings in its first \r\nmeetings was undertaken. The review made clear that \r\nthe Consultative Process has served and will continue \r\nto serve its purpose. The European Union looks \r\nforward to the discussions at next year’s Consultative \r\nProcess, the theme of which will be capacity-building \r\nin oceans affairs and the law of the sea, including \r\nmarine science. We note the agreement of all parties \r\nduring the negotiations that this theme should \r\nincorporate the issue of the mitigation of the effects of \r\nclimate change, particularly in respect of developing \r\ncountries. \r\n The European Union is concerned about the \r\nsubstantially increased workload of the Commission on \r\nthe Limits of the Continental Shelf and is mindful of \r\nthe need to find a sustainable solution to that problem. \r\nWe therefore welcome the decision of the Nineteenth \r\nMeeting of States Parties to the Convention on the Law \r\nA/64/PV.56  \r\n \r\n09-63342 4 \r\n \r\nof the Sea to facilitate an informal working group to \r\ncontinue consideration of how to address that \r\nimportant issue. In relation to the Commission’s \r\nongoing work, the European Union welcomes the fact \r\nthat the summaries of most recommendations have \r\nbeen made publicly available, thus enabling all parties \r\nto have a better understanding of the entire process. We \r\nencourage the Commission to continue to \r\ncomprehensively reflect its reasoning in the summaries \r\nof recommendations, in accordance with the rules of \r\nprocedure and the confidentiality of the information \r\nprovided to the Commission. \r\n With its 148 operative paragraphs, this year’s \r\ndraft resolution on sustainable fisheries has reached an \r\nextent which makes it difficult to manage, and the \r\nEuropean Union would be in favour of efforts to \r\nshorten the resolution in the years to come. \r\nNevertheless, this year a crucial part of the resolution \r\nconsists of the important review of resolution 61/105 in \r\nrelation to the impact of bottom fishing on vulnerable \r\nmarine ecosystems (VMEs), as called for in paragraph \r\n91 of that resolution. \r\n Resolution 61/105 represented a real regime shift, \r\nwhich the EU fully supported and promoted. In fact, in \r\n2008 the EU implemented the calls made by the \r\nGeneral Assembly with regard to addressing the impact \r\nof deep-sea bottom fishing practices by its vessels in \r\nthe high seas and in European Community waters. The \r\nEU will continue its work with all the relevant \r\nstakeholders to deepen and extend knowledge and \r\nprotection of those habitats and their ecosystems, to \r\ndevelop regional fisheries management organizations \r\n(RFMOs) or arrangements where they do not currently \r\nexist, and to urge existing ones to implement effective \r\nprotection measures for VMEs as far as they have not \r\nyet done so. In that regard, the EU recognizes the \r\nefforts made by States and RFMOs to conduct \r\nscientific surveys and to map VMEs. \r\n The EU welcomes and fully endorses the \r\nconsiderable commitment shown at the international \r\nlevel to ensure the continued urgent implementation of \r\nmeasures, in accordance with the Food and Agriculture \r\nOrganization (FO) Guidelines for the Management of \r\nDeep-sea Fisheries in the High Seas, aimed at \r\nstrengthening impact assessment prior to the \r\nauthorization of bottom fishing activities and the \r\nestablishment of encounter protocols, as well as the \r\nadoption of conservation and management measures \r\nfor deep-sea stocks to ensure their long-term \r\nsustainability. The next review, foreseen for 2011, will \r\nbe crucial for the credibility of the commitments made. \r\n The EU has long advocated the need for a strong \r\nand binding agreement at the international level on port \r\nState control, based on the requirement for prior \r\nnotification by the flag State to the port State to certify \r\nthat the fish a vessel is carrying have been caught \r\nlegally, under licence and within quota, before that \r\nvessel can be granted access to the port and its \r\nfacilities. It is that stronger requirement that forms the \r\nbasis for the port State control schemes recently \r\nadopted by a number of RFMOs — including the North \r\nEast Atlantic Fisheries Commission, the International \r\nCommission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas \r\nand the North Atlantic Fisheries Organization — as \r\nwell as for the port State measures contained in the \r\nEuropean Union’s own regulation on illegal, \r\nunreported and unregulated fishing, which will be \r\napplied from 1 January 2010. \r\n The EU appreciates that this year’s draft \r\nresolution underscores the approval by the FAO \r\nConference of the Agreement on Port State Measures to \r\nPrevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and \r\nUnregulated Fishing. Having already signed the \r\nagreement on 22 November 2009, the EU fully \r\nsupports encouraging States to consider signing and \r\nratifying, accepting, approving or acceding to it, with a \r\nview to its early entry into force. \r\n In relation to the impacts of global climate \r\nchange on the sustainability of fish stocks and the \r\nhabitats that support them, the draft resolution again \r\nurges States to intensify efforts to assess and address \r\nsuch impacts. In relation to the possible consequences \r\nof climate change on fishery resources in the Arctic \r\nOcean, the EU would, also in the context of the draft \r\nresolution on sustainable fisheries, have wished to \r\nhighlight the state of the Arctic region as a specific \r\narea where further scientific studies should be carried \r\nout due to the particular implications that climate \r\nchange may have on fisheries management in that area \r\nin the future. \r\n The European Union welcomes the strong \r\nendorsement given by the international community to \r\nthe Kobe process to improve and streamline \r\ninternational management of high-seas tuna fisheries at \r\nthe meeting which took place in San Sebastián, Spain, \r\nin July 2009. The EU is therefore pleased to see that \r\nthis year’s resolution takes the Course of Actions \r\n A/64/PV.56\r\n \r\n5 09-63342 \r\n \r\nagreed at that meeting into account, including by \r\nnoting that global fishing capacity for tunas has to be \r\naddressed urgently. \r\n Finally, the European Union reiterates its \r\nattachment to universal adherence to the United \r\nNations Fish Stocks Agreement and looks forward to \r\nparticipating in the work related to the resumed \r\nReview Conference, which will take place in 2010. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I now give the \r\nfloor to the representative of Brazil to introduce draft \r\nresolution A/64/L.18. \r\n Ms. Dunlop (Brazil): It is with great pleasure and \r\na keen sense of responsibility that I, this year again, \r\nhave the honour of presenting to the General Assembly \r\nthe draft omnibus resolution on oceans and the law of \r\nthe sea (A/64/L.18). \r\n It is not fortuitous that the text before us today, \r\nlike its predecessors, is the longest and one of the most \r\ncomprehensive resolutions adopted annually by the \r\nGeneral Assembly. As recognized in the preamble of \r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea \r\n(UNCLOS), the depth and scope of the issues involved \r\nreflect the awareness that “the problems of ocean space \r\nare closely interrelated and need to be considered as a \r\nwhole”. \r\n The universal and unified character of the \r\nConvention sets out the legal framework within which \r\nall activities in the oceans and seas must be carried out. \r\nUNCLOS sets out the strategic framework within \r\nwhich national, regional and global action and \r\ncooperation in the marine sector unfold. The need to \r\nmaintain the integrity of the Convention is an \r\nimperative, as recognized, in particular, by the United \r\nNations Conference on Environment and Development \r\nin Chapter 17 of Agenda 21. \r\n That imperative is even more significant in view \r\nof the ever-increasing challenges to sustainable \r\ndevelopment and the full enjoyment of peace and \r\nsecurity. Thus the goal of universal participation in the \r\nConvention and the agreement relating to the \r\nimplementation of its Part XI remain important \r\npriorities. \r\n Capacity-building is a cross-cutting issue in most \r\nareas covered by the draft resolution. The availability \r\nin all States, particularly in developing States, of \r\neconomic, legal, navigational, scientific and technical \r\nskills is crucial for the full implementation of the \r\nConvention and for meeting the objectives of the draft \r\nresolution. \r\n Capacity-building, in particular, is required for \r\nthe sustainable development of the oceans and seas \r\nnationally, regionally and globally. The interests and \r\nneeds of landlocked developing States must also be \r\ntaken into account in that respect. Those aspects were \r\nunderscored during the tenth Open-ended Informal \r\nConsultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the \r\nSea. The Process should, thus, intensify its focus on \r\nthat important aspect of international cooperation. \r\n Capacity-building is also necessary in assisting \r\ndeveloping States, especially the least developed and \r\nsmall island developing States and coastal African \r\nStates, in the preparation of submissions to the \r\nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf \r\nregarding the establishment of the outer limits of the \r\ncontinental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles. \r\n Some developing coastal States have not been \r\nable to present, by the 13 May 2009 deadline, full \r\nsubmissions on the outer limits of their continental \r\nshelves beyond 200 nautical miles. It is thus imperative \r\nto enhance cooperation and assistance to those States \r\nin that regard. The capacity-building activities of the \r\nDivision on Oceans and Law of the Sea of the Office of \r\nLegal Affairs should be supported by Member States. \r\n The draft resolution recalls the progress made by \r\nthe International Seabed Authority at its sixteenth \r\nsession in advancing the consideration of regulations \r\nfor prospecting and exploration for polymetallic \r\nsulphides. It also encourages greater progress on the \r\nregulations for prospecting and exploration for cobalt-\r\nrich ferromanganese crusts in the Area. \r\n In setting the normative framework for the \r\nexploration of the common heritage of humankind, the \r\nAuthority is also preparing, pursuant to article 145 of \r\nthe Convention, rules, regulations and procedures to \r\nensure the effective protection of the marine \r\nenvironment, including the protection and conservation \r\nof the natural resources of the Area. This important \r\nrole, as well as the responsibilities entrusted to the \r\nAuthority under article 143 of the Convention with \r\nregard to marine scientific research, is duly \r\nunderscored in the text under consideration. \r\n As previously mentioned, 13 May of this year \r\nwas the deadline for the presentation of submissions by \r\ncoastal States to the Commission on the limits of their \r\nA/64/PV.56  \r\n \r\n09-63342 6 \r\n \r\ncontinental shelf, where it extends beyond 200 nautical \r\nmiles. Since 2001, the Commission has received 51 \r\nsubmissions and has established subcommissions for 13 \r\nof them. The Commission has adopted recommendations \r\non nine submissions. Despite its best efforts, including in \r\nrefining its communication with the coastal States, the \r\nCommission is currently faced with several constraints, \r\nfrom the number of sub-commissions that can be \r\nestablished simultaneously to the limited time allocated \r\nfor the two sessions of approximately six weeks each per \r\nyear. \r\n The Commission has thus estimated that, unless \r\noptions are found to expedite the consideration of the \r\nsubmissions without prejudice to the efficiency, \r\neffectiveness and high level of expertise, it may take \r\nuntil 2035 to conclude consideration of the current \r\nworkload. \r\n This is a major cause of concern for the States \r\nparties, especially considering the efforts and \r\nresources, both human and financial, deployed by the \r\ncoastal States, particularly developing ones, in \r\npreparing their submissions. Notwithstanding, the draft \r\nresolution recalls that pursuant to article 77, \r\nparagraph 3, of the Convention, the rights of a coastal \r\nState over the continental shelf do not depend on \r\noccupation, effective or notional, or on any express \r\nproclamation. \r\n With a view to addressing the issue of the \r\nworkload of the Commission, the States parties have \r\nestablished a working group of the whole to consider \r\nways and means to enable the Commission to expedite \r\nits work. Utter flexibility must be demonstrated in the \r\nsearch for adequate solutions for supporting the \r\nCommission and its secretariat and the Division of \r\nOceans and Law of the Sea of the Office of Legal \r\nAffairs, including by allocating resources that are \r\ncommensurate with the task at hand. The integrity of \r\nUNCLOS must be duly preserved in the process. \r\n The legal regimes governing maritime safety and \r\nmaritime security may have common and mutually \r\nreinforcing objectives, and all actions taken to combat \r\nthreats to maritime security must be in accordance with \r\ninternational law, including the principles embodied in \r\nthe Charter and the Convention. \r\n The crucial role of international cooperation \r\nshould be recognized, both in combating threats to \r\nmaritime security, in accordance with international law, \r\nand in fighting transnational organized criminal \r\nactivities, within the scope of the United Nations \r\ninstruments against illicit drug trafficking and of the \r\nUnited Nations Convention against Transnational \r\nOrganized Crime. \r\n The draft resolution recalls the need for enhanced \r\nsharing of information among States relevant to the \r\ndetection, prevention and suppression of threats to \r\nmaritime security, the need for the prosecution of \r\noffenders to pay due regard to national legislation, and \r\nthe need for sustained capacity-building to support \r\nsuch objectives. \r\n Regarding the continuing rise in the number of \r\nincidents of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the \r\ncoast of Somalia, the text recognizes the importance of \r\na comprehensive and sustainable settlement of the \r\nsituation in Somalia and the primary role of the \r\nTransitional Federal Government in rooting out piracy \r\nand armed robbery against ships. It further \r\nre-emphasizes the need, in particular, to assist Somalia \r\nand States in the region to strengthen their capacity to \r\nfight piracy and armed robbery against ships off the \r\ncoast of Somalia and bring to justice those involved in \r\npiracy and armed robbery at sea. \r\n The prosecution of those involved in acts of \r\npiracy committed off the coast of Somalia commands \r\nconsiderable interest and has been the object of \r\ndeliberations within the Contact Group on Piracy off \r\nthe Coast of Somalia, established on 14 January 2009, \r\nfollowing the adoption of Security Council resolution \r\n1851 (2008). The draft resolution invites States, the \r\nInternational Maritime Organization and the \r\nInternational Labour Organization to consider possible \r\nsolutions for the seafarers and fishers who are victims \r\nof pirates. \r\n The need to ensure freedom of navigation, the \r\nsafety of navigation and the rights of transit passage, \r\narchipelagic sea lanes passage and innocent passage \r\nenshrined in the Convention has been consistently \r\npromoted by the General Assembly and the draft \r\nresolution reiterates the appeal to States in that respect. \r\n Likewise, it notes that cessation of the transport \r\nof radioactive materials through the regions of small \r\nisland developing States is a desired goal of small \r\nisland developing States and some other countries. \r\n The draft resolution highlights the work of the \r\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in \r\nparticular its findings on the acidification of oceans. In \r\n A/64/PV.56\r\n \r\n7 09-63342 \r\n \r\nthat regard, States and competent international \r\norganizations and other relevant institutions are \r\nencouraged to urgently pursue further research on \r\nocean acidification and to increase national, regional \r\nand international efforts to address levels of ocean \r\nacidity and the negative impact of such acidity on \r\nvulnerable marine ecosystems, particularly coral reefs. \r\n It notes the need to enhance scientific activity \r\naimed at better understanding the effects of climate \r\nchange on the marine environment and marine \r\nbiodiversity and at developing ways and means of \r\nadaptation. A note of caution is needed however, given \r\nthe present state of knowledge, on ocean fertilization \r\nactivities. Other than for legitimate scientific research, \r\nsuch activities should not be allowed. Scientific \r\nresearch proposals should be assessed on a case-by-\r\ncase basis. An assessment framework is to be \r\ndeveloped by the scientific groups formed under the \r\nLondon Convention and Protocol. \r\n The role of the General Assembly relating to the \r\nconservation and sustainable use of marine biological \r\ndiversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction must be \r\nemphasized. Further discussion on the relevant legal \r\nregime covering marine genetic resources in areas \r\nbeyond national jurisdiction in accordance with the \r\nConvention is also called for. This issue is to be further \r\nconsidered in the context of the mandate of the Ad Hoc \r\nOpen-ended Informal Working Group, which includes \r\nthe study of issues relating to the conservation and \r\nsustainable use of marine biological diversity beyond \r\nareas of national jurisdiction.  \r\n The Working Group will meet for the third time \r\nin 2010. Progress on this issue is needed, given the \r\nabundance and diversity of marine genetic resources \r\nand their value in terms of the benefits, goods and \r\nservices they can provide. It should be recalled that \r\n2010 will be the International Year of Biodiversity. \r\n The section on marine science stresses the \r\nimportance of increasing the scientific understanding \r\nof the oceans-atmosphere interface, including through \r\nparticipation in ocean observation programmes and \r\ngeographic information systems. The intentional or \r\nunintentional damaging of platforms used for ocean \r\nobservation and marine scientific research is a cause of \r\nconcern. Action and cooperation to address such \r\ndamage is called for. \r\n The text records the progress made in giving \r\neffect to the recommendation, contained in the \r\nJohannesburg Plan of Implementation of the World \r\nSummit on Sustainable Development, on the \r\nestablishment of a regular process for global reporting \r\nand assessment of the state of the marine environment, \r\nincluding socio-economic aspects. In that respect, the \r\nreport on the results of the assessment of assessments \r\nsubmitted by the United Nations Environment \r\nProgramme and the Intergovernmental Oceanographic \r\nCommission, the lead agencies of the process, has been \r\nan important step and marked the completion of the \r\nstart-up phase of the Regular Process. \r\n An Ad Hoc Working Group of the Whole was \r\nestablished to recommend a course of action to the \r\nGeneral Assembly based on the outcomes of the fourth \r\nmeeting of the Ad Hoc Steering Group, convened in \r\naccordance with paragraph 157 of resolution 63/111. \r\nThe Ad Hoc Working Group of the Whole proposed a \r\nframework for the Regular Process. By adopting the \r\ntext of the draft resolution before it today, the General \r\nAssembly will endorse the recommendations of the Ad \r\nHoc Working Group, including the request for the \r\nDivision for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea to \r\nprovide support for the Regular Process. \r\n The Secretary-General is requested to establish a \r\nvoluntary trust fund for the purpose of supporting the \r\noperations of the first five-year cycle of the Regular \r\nProcess, including the provision of assistance to \r\nexperts from developing countries, as well as a special \r\nscholarship fund to support training programmes for \r\ndeveloping countries. \r\n It is expected that the Regular Process will \r\nstrengthen the regular scientific assessment of the state \r\nof the marine environment in order to enhance the \r\nscientific basis for policymaking. \r\n Finally, the tenth meeting of the Open-ended \r\nInformal Consultative Process on Oceans and the Law \r\nof the Sea, held in June of the current year, reviewed \r\nthe mandate, objectives, achievements and \r\nshortcomings of the Process in its first nine years. The \r\nreview recognized that the role of the Consultative \r\nProcess was unique in promoting comprehensive \r\ndiscussion of issues related to oceans and the law of \r\nthe sea, consistent with the framework provided by the \r\nConvention and chapter 17 of Agenda 21. It also \r\nrecognized that perspectives based on the three pillars \r\nof sustainable development should be integrated \r\nfurther in the examination of selected topics. \r\nA/64/PV.56  \r\n \r\n09-63342 8 \r\n \r\n The need to strengthen and improve the \r\nefficiency of the Consultative Process was also \r\nrecognized during the review. It was recommended that \r\nthe Consultative Process devise a transparent, objective \r\nand inclusive process for the selection of topics and \r\npanellists, so as to facilitate the work of the General \r\nAssembly during the informal consultations on the \r\nannual draft resolution on oceans and the law of the \r\nsea. \r\n It is proposed that at its eleventh meeting the \r\nInformal Consultative Process focus on capacity-\r\nbuilding in ocean affairs and the law of the sea, \r\nincluding marine science. With that important topic, \r\nwhich reflects the concerns of developing countries, it \r\nis hoped that the Informal Consultative Process will \r\nreinstate its original intent, further promote the sharing \r\nof knowledge, the exchange of views among the \r\nmultiple stakeholders and coordination among \r\ncompetent agencies, and enhance awareness of the \r\ntopics, including emerging issues, while promoting the \r\nthree pillars of sustainable development. In that \r\ncontext, our approach to climate change should be \r\nfocused on the conservation of blue carbon sinks. \r\n In concluding my presentation of this important \r\ndraft resolution, I wish to recognize the efforts of all \r\nthe delegations involved in the consultations, the high \r\nlevel of expertise, the professionalism and the \r\ncooperative spirit that enabled this outcome before the \r\nGeneral Assembly today. \r\n The support of the Division for Ocean Affairs and \r\nthe Law of the Sea of the Office of Legal Affairs was \r\nalso instrumental to the positive results. I wish to thank \r\nthe highly efficient team of that Division through their \r\nDirector, Mr. Serguei Tarassenko. \r\n We are convinced of the relevance of the \r\ncomprehensive text before the General Assembly and \r\nhope that it will be adopted by consensus. \r\n Mr. Zinsou (Benin) (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the African Group, my delegation would like to \r\nreiterate its pleasure, Mr. President, at seeing you guide \r\nthe work of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth \r\nsession and to assure you of its full cooperation for the \r\nsuccess of your term of office. \r\n The Group would like to thank in particular the \r\ntwo coordinators of the draft resolutions on oceans and \r\nthe law of the sea (A/64/L.18) and on sustainable \r\nfisheries (A/64/L.29), as well as the experts of the \r\nMember States, for the professionalism that they have \r\ndemonstrated, which has facilitated the drafting and \r\nfinalization of the two omnibus draft resolutions. \r\n The Group would also like to thank the United \r\nNations Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the \r\nSea and its specialized institutions for the key role that \r\nthey play in implementing the rules of the law of the \r\nsea and its relevant resolutions. \r\n The two draft resolutions before the General \r\nAssembly today, it must be remembered, are part of the \r\nframework for applying the principles contained in the \r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, \r\nwhich was concluded after several years of difficult \r\nnegotiations among States seeking to ensure proper \r\nocean governance and promote the sustainable \r\ndevelopment of its resources. \r\n The result of painstaking compromises among \r\nMember States, the draft resolutions take into account \r\nthe various aspects of the preservation of the marine \r\necosystem and the controlled management of its riches. \r\nSuch aspects include issues related to the environment, \r\nmarine resources, biodiversity, coordination, \r\ncooperation, the settlement of disputes and capacity-\r\nbuilding. Those are also areas where an agreed \r\nregulatory framework and a proper code of conduct \r\nmake it easier to work together. Measures taken in that \r\ncontext help to ensure a better preservation of the \r\noceans. \r\n Here, we confirm our full support for the noble \r\nprinciples set out in the draft resolutions and for those \r\ncontained in previous resolutions on the same topics. \r\nHowever, those principles can only give rise to a \r\nsustainable development that is capable of achieving \r\nthe development goals of States if a real effort is made \r\nto involve all States, in particular developing ones, \r\nspecifically African coastal States, both in drafting the \r\nresolutions and in implementing the principles.  \r\n Indeed, those States, because they lack the \r\nlogistical and technical resources and qualified \r\npersonnel, watch powerlessly as their maritime areas \r\nare illegally and anarchically exploited, including those \r\nover which they have sovereignty under international \r\nlaw. \r\n The vessels and trawlers of the large fishing \r\ncompanies have abandoned the fishing zones of States \r\nthat have the resources to monitor their coasts to \r\nhappily descend on the African coast, where they \r\n A/64/PV.56\r\n \r\n9 09-63342 \r\n \r\nindulge in illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, \r\nthus overexploiting Africa’s maritime resources. That \r\nillegal fishing, which African States have no way of \r\nstopping, will eventually wipe out the efforts of the \r\ninternational community to protect several endangered \r\nspecies. \r\n Given that situation, the African Group strongly \r\nbelieves that there is an urgent need for the \r\ninternational community to pay greater attention to \r\nillegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, so as to \r\nmake all fishing practices comply with international \r\nlaws governing that area. That applies in particular to \r\nfishing activities along the African coast, so that we \r\ncan preserve our fish stocks and protect them from \r\nexploitation, which will lead inevitably to their \r\nreduction, and even their disappearance. For the \r\nsituation is such that, if nothing is done, the legal and \r\ninstitutional structure established under the United \r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea might well \r\nsuccumb to the law of the jungle. \r\n It is also vital that the international community \r\nprovide the necessary assistance to developing coastal \r\nStates in order to build up their capacity at the national, \r\nsubregional and regional levels so that they can control \r\ntheir territorial waters and those beyond and prevent \r\nand fight against crime and other illicit activities, such \r\nas illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, bottom \r\nsea trawling, piracy, drug trafficking and trafficking in \r\npersons, and so forth. \r\n It is also important that States and relevant \r\norganizations, international agencies and bodies \r\ncooperate in order to strengthen the capacity of \r\ndeveloping countries in the area of marine sciences, \r\nmonitoring and evaluation of the marine environment, \r\nparticularly by organizing workshops and providing \r\nnecessary training and teaching materials, as well as \r\ngrants for experts from developing countries. \r\n Similarly, the African Group would like to call on \r\nStates and international organizations to contribute to \r\nefforts aimed at ensuring that experts from African \r\ncountries can participate, especially in the various \r\nmeetings concerning oceans and the law of the sea, \r\nparticularly by making regular and adequate \r\ncontributions to the trust fund set up to help developing \r\ncountries, particularly the least developed countries, \r\nsmall island developing States and landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries. \r\n The African Group attaches major importance to \r\nissues related to the protection of the marine \r\nenvironment, and the preservation of the marine \r\necosystem and marine biodiversity, from any negative \r\nimpact, particularly those due to climate change. In this \r\narea, the African Group is actively involved in \r\nnegotiations on draft resolutions concerning fisheries, \r\nthe oceans and the law of the sea, not merely to \r\nstrengthen action against illegal, unreported and \r\nunregulated fishing, but, above all, to combat practices \r\nthat might lead to destruction of the ocean floor and \r\nhave a deleterious effect on the life of the seabed and \r\nits resources. To the same end, the African Group \r\nencourages greater cooperation between the Food and \r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) \r\nand regional fisheries organizations, in order to \r\npromote effective implementation of the FAO \r\nInternational Plan of Action to Prevent, Deter, and \r\nEliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing. \r\n For Africa, the issue of the limits of the \r\ncontinental shelf is still unresolved, despite efforts by \r\nthe Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf \r\nto find appropriate solutions to the problems this \r\nraises. In this context, the African Group welcomes the \r\nCommission’s efforts to facilitate implementation of \r\nthe provisions of the United Nations Convention on the \r\nLaw of the Sea relating to the delineation by coastal \r\nStates of the outer limits of their continental shelf, in \r\naccordance with paragraph 8 of article 76 of the \r\nConvention. \r\n The African Group would, however, like to \r\nexpress its concern over the workload of the \r\nCommission. It makes scheduling meetings to consider \r\nreports submitted by coastal States a difficult \r\nchallenge. This situation is seriously prejudicial for \r\ndeveloping States, especially those that have agreed to \r\nenormous sacrifices in order to invest in the framework \r\nof the delineation process. At this rate, the African \r\nGroup believes that several developing States have no \r\nchance of meeting the deadlines set by the Convention \r\nfor delineating the continental shelf beyond the \r\n200-nautical-mile mark. As a result, in order to comply \r\nwith the spirit and the letter of the Convention, the \r\nAfrican Group strongly encourages delegations to be \r\nproactive in seeking practical and realistic solutions to \r\nthis important problem. \r\n As can be seen, the challenges to be dealt with in \r\nimplementing the United Nations Convention on the \r\nLaw of the Sea are still huge, and the rather impressive \r\nA/64/PV.56  \r\n \r\n09-63342 10 \r\n \r\nsize of the draft resolution before us (A/64/L.18 and \r\nCorr.1) gives an idea of the enormous amount of work \r\nstill to be done. That cannot be achieved without the \r\neffective solidarity and efficient cooperation of every \r\nState. \r\n Mr. Wolfe (Jamaica): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of the 14 member States of the Caribbean \r\nCommunity (CARICOM): Antigua and Barbuda, the \r\nBahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, \r\nGuyana, Haiti, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, \r\nSt. Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, Trinidad and \r\nTobago, and my own country, Jamaica. \r\n CARICOM continues to attach great importance \r\nto our participation in the annual debates in the \r\nGeneral Assembly on the item relating to oceans and \r\nthe law of the sea. In this regard, we welcome the very \r\ncomprehensive and detailed reports prepared by the \r\nSecretary-General, as contained in documents A/64/66 \r\nand Add.1 and 2. \r\n It is useful to recall that one of the principal \r\nobjectives and guiding principles of the historic 1982 \r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea \r\n(UNCLOS) was the commitment by States parties to, \r\ninter alia, \r\n “promote the peaceful uses of the seas and \r\noceans, the equitable and efficient utilization of \r\ntheir resources, and the study, protection and \r\npreservation of the marine environment”. \r\n(UNCLOS, preamble). \r\nThese cardinal principles, together with the main \r\nprovisions of the Convention, remain as relevant today \r\nas they were 27 years ago, when the Convention was \r\nadopted, and should therefore be embraced by the \r\nentire international community. \r\n As a group of small and vulnerable island \r\ndeveloping States, CARICOM remains highly \r\ndependent on the Caribbean Sea for its commercial \r\nactivities and economic livelihood, including tourism, \r\nfishing and fisheries, and the exploitation of oil and \r\ngas resources, as well as for regional and international \r\ntrade, most of which is facilitated by ocean freight and \r\ninternational shipping arrangements. Indeed, as the \r\nSecretary-General has highlighted in his report, \r\nmaritime transport remains vital to the world economy, \r\ngiven that more than 80 percent of international trade \r\nby volume is carried by sea, and also bearing in mind \r\nthat an even higher percentage of developing-country \r\ntrade is carried by ships. \r\n For those and other reasons, CARICOM member \r\nStates remain firmly committed to the protection and \r\npreservation of the Caribbean Sea, with the support of \r\nthe international community and with a view to \r\nachieving sustainable development. It has long been \r\nestablished that the Caribbean is the most tourism-\r\ndependent region in the world, relative to its size, and \r\nthe Caribbean Sea, in comparison to other large marine \r\necosystems, is surrounded by the largest number of \r\ncountries in the world. \r\n CARICOM therefore welcomes the renewed \r\nemphasis on efforts to heighten global awareness of the \r\ncurrent challenges faced by the international \r\ncommunity in sustainable ocean management and on \r\nthe future prospects and challenges in the \r\nimplementation of the regime established by the \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea for the protection \r\nand preservation of the marine environment. \r\n These issues must be addressed in the context of \r\nthe current challenges faced by Caribbean and other \r\ndeveloping countries, as a result of the high degree of \r\nvulnerability occasioned by climate change and the \r\nconsequent rise in sea level, as well as the increase in \r\nthe frequency and intensity of national disasters caused \r\nby hurricanes, floods and drought that our region has \r\nexperienced in recent years. \r\n In this regard, we view marine scientific research \r\nas essential to our efforts to confront the challenges to \r\nthe marine environment. We therefore welcome the \r\nrevision of the guide on marine scientific research \r\nprepared by the Division for Ocean Affairs and the \r\nLaw of the Sea. This guide will be useful in assisting \r\ndeveloping countries in examining best practices as we \r\nstrive to conduct research in our respective maritime \r\nzones. \r\n CARICOM reiterates its position that safe, secure \r\nand crime-free routes for navigation and the \r\nimplementation of international rules and standards for \r\nimproving marine safety and security must underpin \r\nthe core of a comprehensive programme aimed at \r\nprotecting marine trade, and at combating, in \r\naccordance with international law, threats to maritime \r\nsecurity. \r\n We therefore remain concerned at the alarming \r\nincrease in the number of committed and attempted \r\n A/64/PV.56\r\n \r\n11 09-63342 \r\n \r\nacts of piracy and armed robbery against ships, \r\nreported to the International Maritime Organization \r\n(IMO), which, in the first six months of 2009 alone, \r\ntotalled 238, as compared with 121 in the first six \r\nmonths of 2008, as indicated in the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport (A/64/66/Add.1). The international community \r\nmust remain resolute in addressing that scourge, which \r\nhas the potential to cause severe disruptions to \r\nmaritime commerce. \r\n At the twelfth meeting of the Council on Foreign \r\nand Community Relations (COFCOR), held in \r\nKingston, Jamaica, in May this year, CARICOM \r\nexpressed its concern at that grave phenomenon, which \r\naffects Caribbean countries that are flag registers, \r\nwhile also noting that the Caribbean Sea is recognized \r\nas a major shipping route and that robbery at sea is not \r\nunknown in the Caribbean and the South Atlantic and \r\ncould have a negative impact on CARICOM States. \r\n As a result, CARICOM members have agreed to \r\ncollaborate effectively in relevant international forums \r\nto share information and strategize jointly so as to have \r\na strong voice in the international dialogue on the issue \r\nof piracy. It was also agreed that those CARICOM \r\nStates that enjoy membership in the IMO will \r\ncooperate in drafting domestic legislation to tackle the \r\nproblem and would forward such drafts to the Legal \r\nCommittee of the IMO in order to facilitate the drafting \r\nof model legislation relevant to piracy and related \r\nissues. \r\n CARICOM also continues to face serious security \r\nthreats posed by the maritime traffic in narcotic drugs \r\nand psychotropic substances, coupled with the illicit \r\ntrade in small arms and light weapons, which continue \r\nto pose serious challenges for Governments and law \r\nenforcement agencies in our region. We have devised \r\nregional strategies aimed at addressing that illegal \r\ntrade and its associated crimes, which are at variance \r\nwith the provisions of the Convention on the Law of \r\nthe Sea and the stipulations for peaceful uses of the \r\nsea, and we are committed to working with agencies \r\nsuch as the Commission on Narcotic Drugs to confront \r\nthose serious crimes. \r\n Another perennial concern for CARICOM States \r\nis the danger posed by the transport of radioactive \r\nmaterials through the Caribbean Sea. While \r\nrecognizing the principles of freedom of navigation \r\nenshrined in the relevant provisions of the Convention, \r\nwe remain deeply disturbed at the potential risk to \r\nlives, health, and our environment and economies in \r\nthe event of an accident during the transportation of \r\nradioactive materials by sea. \r\n We wish to reiterate that States involved in the \r\ntransport of such hazardous materials have a legal \r\nobligation to protect and preserve the marine \r\nenvironment and we call upon them to continue to \r\nadhere to the guidelines established by the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency and other \r\nagencies on the transportation of such materials. \r\n Turning to other issues under our consideration, \r\nCARICOM takes this opportunity to re-emphasize its \r\nsupport for the work of the Commission on the Limits \r\nof the Continental Shelf (CLCS). We are encouraged \r\nby the important contribution that the CLCS continues \r\nto make with respect to the submissions made by \r\ncoastal States seeking to extend the limits of the \r\ncontinental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles in \r\naccordance with article 76, paragraph 8, of the \r\nConvention. \r\n As of 12 May 2009, the workload of the CLCS \r\nhas increased due to the 51 submissions lodged by \r\ncoastal States. The Chairman of the Commission has \r\nreported that, given its current workload and the \r\nresource constraints, new strategies would have to be \r\nemployed if the Commission is to make \r\nrecommendations to coastal States within a reasonable \r\ntime, so that the submitting States can establish the \r\nlimits of their continental shelf as provided under \r\narticle 76. \r\n We thus call on Member States to participate in \r\nthe informal working group established by the \r\nnineteenth Meeting of States Parties, which has been \r\nmandated to devise strategies aimed at streamlining the \r\nwork of the Commission. It is our view that States need \r\nto commit to providing more resources to the \r\nCommission, including to the Division for Ocean \r\nAffairs and the Law of the Sea, which serves as its \r\nSecretariat, at this critical period, if the Organization is \r\nto effectively discharge its mandate. CARICOM also \r\ncalls on States that are in a position to do so to \r\ncontribute to the Trust Fund established by General \r\nAssembly resolution 55/7 to assist members of the \r\nCommission from developing countries in participating \r\nin the work of the Commission. \r\n CARICOM also wishes to commend the \r\nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea for the \r\nimportant action undertaken to enhance the quality of \r\nA/64/PV.56  \r\n \r\n09-63342 12 \r\n \r\nits work with the establishment of a new Chamber for \r\nMaritime Delimitation Disputes, as well as the \r\nmodification of the Chamber for Fisheries Disputes \r\nand the Chamber for Maritime Environment Disputes. \r\n The pacific settlement of disputes is a hallmark in \r\nthe international law of the sea and we urge States \r\nparties to make declarations under article 287 of the \r\nConvention, accepting the jurisdiction of the Tribunal \r\nin settling disputes concerning the interpretation and \r\napplication of the provisions of the Convention. \r\n As part of the CARICOM family, Jamaica \r\ncontinues to fulfil its legal obligations as host country \r\nfor the headquarters of the International Seabed \r\nAuthority, which has been entrusted with the mandate \r\nto administer, organize and control activities in the \r\ninternational seabed area on behalf of States parties. \r\n CARICOM is pleased at the considerable \r\nprogress achieved by the Authority over the past two \r\nyears, towards the finalization of the draft on \r\nprospecting and exploration for polymetallic sulphides \r\nin the Area. We remain reasonably confident that the \r\ndraft regulations can be concluded at the upcoming \r\nsixteenth session of the Authority, to be held from \r\n26 April to 7 May 2010. At that session, the Council of \r\nthe Authority will also have before it the draft \r\nregulations on prospecting and exploration for cobalt-\r\nrich ferromanganese crusts in the Area, which were \r\nadopted by the Legal and Technical Commission \r\nduring the fifteenth session. \r\n CARICOM therefore wishes to emphasize the \r\nurgent need for improvement in attendance at the \r\nmeetings of the Authority, particularly at this critical \r\njuncture when we are in the process of finalizing legal \r\ncodes for prospecting and exploration of mineral \r\nresources that are part of the common heritage of \r\nhumanity. Improved attendance would also serve to \r\nreemphasize the pre-eminent role of the Authority as \r\nthe sole legitimate body that has the mandate to act on \r\nbehalf of the international community in this important \r\nmaritime zone. \r\n It should be noted that the role of the Authority is \r\nassuming greater importance at a time when the \r\nCommission has made recommendations to some \r\ncoastal States allowing them to establish their \r\ncontinental shelf jurisdiction beyond 200 nautical \r\nmiles. As a result of such action by the Commission, \r\nthe Authority will now have a more definitive position \r\nas to those areas where national jurisdiction ends and \r\nwhere its own mandate begins, that is, to manage the \r\ninternational seabed regime. \r\n An institution as important as the Authority must \r\nbe endowed with competent leadership for it to garner \r\nconfidence among its membership. It is for this reason \r\nthat we are very pleased to welcome the presence in the \r\nGeneral Assembly this morning of His Excellency Nii \r\nAllotey Odunton, who was elected Secretary-General \r\non 4 June 2008 at the Authority’s fourteenth session \r\nand whose term of office formally commenced in \r\nJanuary of this year. \r\n With more than 20 years of experience in the \r\ninternational civil service, particularly in the area of \r\nmarine mineral resources and marine resource policy \r\nformulation, Mr. Odunton brings a wealth of \r\nknowledge and experience to his new post. CARICOM \r\nis therefore confident that he will harness all of his \r\nmultiple talents to enable the Authority to be a true \r\ncustodian of our common heritage. In conclusion, \r\nCARICOM urges those States members of the \r\nAuthority that are not yet parties to the 1994 \r\nAgreement relating to the Implementation of Part XI of \r\nthe Convention immediately to take steps towards \r\nbecoming parties so as to remove the incongruity and \r\nanomaly that currently exist for those States. \r\n Mr. Valero Briceño (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n CARICOM welcomes the increasing number of \r\nMember States that have become parties to the United \r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea. We are \r\nparticularly pleased that, as of 31 August 2009, there \r\nwere 159 parties to the Convention representing an \r\nincrease of three over the previous year. \r\n Finally, we take this opportunity to once again \r\nurge those States that have not yet become parties to \r\nthe Convention to do so with a view to ensuring its \r\nuniversal acceptance. \r\n Ms. Moses (Nauru): I have to honour to speak on \r\nbehalf of the Pacific small island developing States \r\n(SIDS) represented at the United Nations, namely, the \r\nFederated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Palau, Papua New \r\nGuinea, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Samoa, \r\nSolomon Islands, Tuvalu, Tonga, Vanuatu and my own \r\ncountry, Nauru. \r\n To the Pacific SIDS as island nations, the \r\nrobustness of the international ocean governance is of \r\ncritical concern. Not only is the ocean an integral part \r\n A/64/PV.56\r\n \r\n13 09-63342 \r\n \r\nof our cultural identity, but we rely on the oceans as a \r\nmajor source of our food. Negative impacts on the \r\nhealth of marine ecosystems threaten the very ability of \r\nour people to meet their nutritional needs. Healthy \r\necosystems are also critical to tourism, which is a \r\nmajor source of revenue for many of our islands. The \r\nsustainable management of our marine ecosystem is \r\nessential to the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. \r\n All nations are beneficiaries of the rich resources \r\nprovided by the oceans, and all nations have the \r\nresponsibility to ensure the sustainable conservation \r\nand management of marine resources. The Pacific \r\nregional waters compose 10 per cent of the Earth’s \r\nsurface, and much of this falls within the national \r\njurisdictions of the small island developing States. We \r\ntake our role as custodians of the precious ecosystems \r\nseriously. Our region has a high concentration of \r\nvulnerable marine ecosystems, including coral reefs, \r\nhydrothermal vents and underwater seamounts. The \r\nPacific Ocean is also home to fish stocks of global \r\nimportance. \r\n Our oceans are under threat. The human impacts \r\non the health of marine biodiversity are profound. Fish \r\nstocks continue to fall, and scientists warn that global \r\nfisheries are in crisis. Illegal, unregulated and \r\nunreported (IUU) fishing is one of the gravest threats \r\nto the future sustainability of our regional marine \r\nresources and the marine environment. The rate of IUU \r\nfishing in the Pacific is higher than in any other region, \r\naccounting for approximately 36 per cent of the total \r\ncatch. IUU fishing has severe impacts on target species \r\nand by-catch, both affecting subsistence fishing by \r\nPacific people and having severe negative impacts on \r\nbiodiversity. \r\n The Pacific SIDS face serious constraints in their \r\nability to respond to IUU fishing in our region because \r\nof geographic isolation, small populations and lack of \r\ntechnical expertise. We call on all countries to continue \r\nand increase their efforts to end IUU fishing, and we \r\nwelcome the assistance provided to us by our partners, \r\nparticularly in relation to joint enforcement exercises. \r\nWe would like to strengthen these initiatives. \r\n Bottom trawling is gravely endangering \r\nvulnerable ecosystems. We welcome the review of the \r\nimplementation of resolution 61/105 that took place in \r\nSeptember, particularly on the issue of bottom \r\ntrawling. Progress was made in strengthening the \r\nmeasures, and we consider this year’s draft resolution \r\n(A/64/L.29) a genuine step in the right direction \r\ntowards greater conservation and management of deep-\r\nsea fish stocks, habitats and ecosystems. We strongly \r\nwelcome the provisions calling upon flag States and \r\nregional fisheries management organizations not to \r\nauthorize bottom trawling until the requirements in \r\nresolution 61/105 have been met, and we will exercise \r\nour own role as participants in the South Pacific \r\nRegional Fisheries Management Organization process \r\nto ensure that the high-seas pockets enclosed by our \r\nexclusive economic zones in the western tropical \r\nPacific are not threatened by bottom trawling. \r\n We wish to reiterate the call on those States \r\nparticipating in negotiations to establish a new regional \r\nfisheries management organization for the North \r\nPacific to expedite their negotiations and to ensure that \r\nthere is no gap between the areas covered by the South \r\nPacific Regional Fisheries Management Organization \r\nand the measures implemented for the North Pacific. \r\nWe repeat our call for a prohibition on destructive \r\nfishing practices, including bottom trawling, where \r\nthere is no regional fisheries management organization \r\nunder negotiation or interim measures in effect, until \r\nappropriate conservation and management measures \r\nare in place. \r\n We wish to thank all parties in the negotiations \r\nfor their constructive work in addressing the serious \r\nthreats of bottom trawling, but we remind them that \r\nfurther urgent work remains to be done to ensure the \r\nsustainability of our oceans. We look forward to further \r\nreview of the actions of States and regional fisheries \r\nmanagement organizations to implement resolution \r\n61/105 and this year’s draft resolution in 2011, and we \r\nhope that improvements in implementation will be \r\nreported. \r\n Climate change is having severe impacts on our \r\noceans, and we regret that this serious issue has \r\nreceived too little practical attention from the \r\ninternational community. The importance of our oceans \r\nin regulating the global atmosphere has been largely \r\ntaken for granted. The oceans have absorbed over \r\n50 per cent of all anthropogenic carbon emissions over \r\nthe past 200 years, and thus have a significant role to \r\nplay in mitigating climate change. \r\n Yet the high level of carbon dioxide absorbed by \r\nour oceans is having severe negative impacts on the \r\nhealth and functioning of marine ecosystems. Higher \r\nA/64/PV.56  \r\n \r\n09-63342 14 \r\n \r\nlevels of carbon dioxide are causing acidification, \r\naffecting the growth and viability of many marine \r\norganisms, and threatening acute changes in the food \r\nweb and effects on fish stocks. Coral reefs are \r\nparticularly vulnerable to ocean acidification, as higher \r\nacid levels prevent coral growth. It is estimated that \r\ncorals around the world will stop growing if the \r\natmospheric carbon dioxide concentration stabilizes at \r\n450 parts per million, with unknown but likely \r\nprofound negative impacts on dependent species. \r\n In light of these impacts, we reiterate our call for \r\nthe United Nations Climate Change Conference in \r\nCopenhagen to conclude with an agreement with \r\nemission targets that limit atmospheric carbon dioxide \r\nconcentration at 350 parts per million and keep global \r\ntemperature rise well below 1.5 degrees Celsius. \r\n Finally, the delineation of continental shelves is a \r\ncritical issue for the Pacific SIDS. It is imperative that \r\na solution be found for the inadequate resources so that \r\nthe work is able to progress in a timely manner. The \r\ncurrent timeframes are severely disadvantageous for \r\nsmaller missions relying on external advice to navigate \r\nthe highly technical issues involved. \r\n Ms. Negm (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, the delegation of Egypt aligns itself with the \r\nstatement delivered by the representative of Benin on \r\nbehalf of the African Group. It also expresses its \r\nappreciation to the coordinators of the draft resolutions \r\non oceans and the law of the sea (A/64/L.18) and \r\nsustainable fisheries (A/64/L.29) for their efforts to \r\nreach agreement on the two drafts resolutions. The \r\ndelegation of Egypt attaches particular importance to \r\nthe role of these drafts in promoting international \r\ncooperation in matters relating to the seas and oceans, \r\nthe protection of the marine environment and the \r\nsustainability of fisheries for the benefit of humanity, \r\nin accordance with the principles of international law \r\nenshrined in the United Nations Convention on the \r\nLaw of the Sea of 1982. Furthermore, we thank the \r\nSecretary-General and the United Nations Division for \r\nOcean Affairs and the Law of the Sea for their efforts \r\nin preparing the reports before us today. \r\n From this perspective, the Egyptian delegation \r\nstresses the importance of strengthening the efforts of \r\nthe international community in the field of marine \r\nscientific research, particularly in the context of the \r\nInternational Seabed Authority and the study of the \r\neffects of mining activities on the seabed environment. \r\nIt also stresses the importance of following the new \r\nguidelines to prevent the monopolization of mineral \r\nexploitation of those areas, as they represent the \r\ncommon heritage of humankind. Similarly, the \r\nEgyptian delegation is deeply concerned over the \r\nincreasing impact of climate change on marine life and \r\necosystems and on shipping routes and the associated \r\nincreased costs of maritime transport. It also stresses \r\nthe need to take these issues into account in the current \r\nnegotiations in Copenhagen on the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change. \r\n Turning to the safety and security of navigation, \r\nthe Egyptian delegation further expresses its growing \r\nconcern at the rising number of incidents involving \r\npiracy and armed robbery against ships, especially in \r\nthe waters off the coast of East Africa. Egypt supports \r\ninternational efforts to combat this phenomenon, \r\nparticularly off the coast of Somalia. In this regard, it \r\nwelcomes the recognition in draft resolution A/64/L.18 \r\non oceans and the law of the sea of the importance of \r\nreaching a comprehensive and permanent settlement of \r\nthe situation in Somalia, which is closely linked to the \r\nspread of piracy in that region. Aware of the need to \r\npromote international cooperation in this regard, Egypt \r\nis participating actively in the Contact Group on Piracy \r\noff the Coast of Somalia with a view to reaching a \r\ncomprehensive solution to this problem. \r\n Furthermore, my delegation emphasizes the need \r\nto implement the Djibouti Code of Conduct concerning \r\nthe Repression of Piracy and Armed Robbery against \r\nShips in the Western Indian Ocean and the Gulf of \r\nAden, and urges everyone to work to improve \r\nconditions for seafarers and fishermen victims of \r\npiracy. Hence, it welcomes the Assembly’s request of \r\nthe International Maritime Organization and the \r\nInternational Labour Organization to study ways to \r\nachieve this. \r\n The Egyptian delegation is also closely following \r\ninternational efforts being made with international \r\nshipping companies to allow the transport of \r\nradioactive materials in accordance with the relevant \r\ninternational protection measures on the transfer of \r\nsuch materials for peaceful purposes and medical use \r\nand in accordance with the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. \r\n From the same perspective, the Egyptian \r\ndelegation stresses the importance of providing the \r\nnecessary support to developing countries to ensure \r\n A/64/PV.56\r\n \r\n15 09-63342 \r\n \r\ntheir increased participation in data collection \r\nprogrammes and exchanges in various fields related to \r\nmarine and ocean sciences. It also deems it necessary \r\nto solve the problem of the increasing workload of the \r\nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf in \r\norder to enable it to consider the recent submissions of \r\ndeveloping countries on an equal footing with the past \r\nsubmissions of developed countries. \r\n With regard to the United Nations Open-ended \r\nInformal Consultative Process on Oceans and the Law \r\nof the Sea, the Egyptian delegation welcomes the \r\nresults of the tenth meeting, which emphasized the \r\nneed to strengthen the pillars of sustainable \r\ndevelopment when considering topics consistent with \r\nthe legal framework of the Convention in order to \r\nachieve the goals of Agenda 21, which established this \r\nprocess. The Egyptian delegation looks forward to \r\nachieving this goal through the future activities of the \r\nConsultative Process. \r\n As for sustainable fisheries, the Egyptian \r\ndelegation emphasizes the need for greater efforts to \r\nprotect endangered fish species, fight illegal, \r\nunregistered and unreported fishing and eliminate \r\ndestructive fishing practices affecting the seabed. In \r\nthis regard, the Egyptian delegation has monitored \r\nmeasures taken by regional fishery management \r\norganizations to protect seabed ecosystems in \r\nimplementation of resolution 61/105. However, we \r\nnote the inadequacy of these measures to ensuring the \r\nsustainable use of marine resources and habitats, \r\nincluding vulnerable marine ecosystems, and look \r\nforward to the enhanced cooperation of States with the \r\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United \r\nNations and regional fisheries management \r\norganizations in creating a system to manage seabed \r\nfishing in a manner that preserves the marine \r\necosystems. \r\n Also, in order to strengthen international \r\ncooperation on sustainable fisheries, the Egyptian \r\ndelegation proposes that the 2010 Review Conference \r\non the 1995 Fish Stocks Agreement address the \r\nproblems in the Agreement that are preventing \r\nratification by more countries, especially the \r\ndeveloping ones, and the establishment of effective \r\nfisheries management mechanisms. \r\n Finally, the Egyptian delegation expresses its \r\ngrowing concern over the state of the oceans and seas \r\nworldwide and looks forward to greater cooperation \r\nefforts by the international community to improve \r\nthese conditions and to protect the marine environment \r\nfrom factors that harm marine biodiversity and \r\nvulnerable marine ecosystems. \r\n Ms. Picco (Monaco) (spoke in French): We have \r\nprobably reached the maximum potential of capture \r\nfishing in the planet’s oceans. In 2007, almost 28 per \r\ncent of fish stocks were overexploited, exhausted or in \r\nthe process of reconstitution. Migratory species, \r\nwhales and other cetaceans are still vulnerable to \r\nchemical pollution, collision with ships, exploitation, \r\nsound pollution, by-catch, ingestion of marine waste \r\nand the effects of climate change. \r\n Marine ecosystems, which scientific research has \r\nconfirmed as important carbon sinks, are suffering \r\nfrom those devastating impacts and disappearing. \r\nOcean acidification due to climate change threatens the \r\nlivelihoods of billions of people throughout the world. \r\nAcidification leads to erosion and jeopardizes the \r\nstability of coastal areas. Its economic and social \r\nimpact, aggravated by extreme climatic phenomena, is \r\npotentially devastating. \r\n Although knowledge of marine diversity remains \r\ninsufficient, as demonstrated by the fact that over \r\n1,000 species are discovered every year, progress in \r\nresearch confirms the essential role of marine life and \r\nbiodiversity in preserving the world’s ecosystems and \r\nensuring socio-economic development. Healthy oceans \r\nare a tool against poverty and hunger, can ensure food \r\nsecurity and are essential to attaining our common goal \r\nof sustainable development. \r\n At this moment when our heads of State and \r\nGovernment are preparing to negotiate a critical \r\npolitical agreement in Copenhagen, it is deplorable that \r\nno reference is made to that event in the omnibus \r\nresolution (A/64/L.18), in particular due to the fact that \r\nthe General Assembly is preparing to devote special \r\nattention to biodiversity within the context of the 2010 \r\nInternational Year of Biodiversity. \r\n In addition to developing further methods to \r\nadapt to climate change, necessary to strengthening the \r\nresilience of marine ecosystems, the international \r\ncommunity also has a collective duty to act and to take \r\ngreater care in preserving and managing the living \r\nmarine resources, pursuant to its obligations under the \r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. \r\nA/64/PV.56  \r\n \r\n09-63342 16 \r\n \r\n The personal commitment of His Serene \r\nHighness Prince Albert II is reflected in concrete steps \r\nto protect fragile ecosystems such as coral reefs, which \r\nare home to 30 per cent of marine biodiversity and are \r\nunder unprecedented stress. In that connection, I \r\nshould like to announce that, from 12 to 15 January \r\n2010, Monaco will host the General Meeting of the \r\nInternational Coral Reef Initiative. \r\n That commitment is also behind the Principality \r\nof Monaco’s efforts with regard to threatened species \r\nsuch as the bluefin tuna, which is one of the world’s \r\nmost exploited species. It is for that reason that the \r\nPrincipality has acted to have the bluefin tuna placed \r\non the Appendix I list of the Convention on \r\nInternational Trade in Endangered Species of Wild \r\nFauna and Flora (CITES), with a view to banning the \r\ninternational trade in that species, preventing the \r\ncollapse of stocks and avoiding its extinction. \r\n In our opinion, the 13,500 ton limit just adopted \r\nby the International Commission for the Conservation \r\nof Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) for the 2010 fishing season \r\nwill not guarantee the rehabilitation of that \r\noverexploited species, especially in the Mediterranean. \r\nWe therefore appeal to all countries that share this \r\nworld heritage, in particular CITES States parties, to \r\nfully assume their responsibilities — failing which, the \r\nindustries that benefit from trade in this species will \r\ndisappear with it. Moreover, unreported and illegal \r\nfishing makes it impossible to bring international trade \r\nback under control. In that regard, we should promote \r\nactive cooperation between ICCAT and CITES. \r\n In addition, Monaco welcomes the recent \r\nadoption, during the thirty-sixth session of the \r\nConference of the Food and Agriculture Organization, \r\nof a treaty aimed at prohibiting access to fishing ports \r\nby vessels involved in illegal, unreported or \r\nunregulated fishing. \r\n Monaco also continues to be very concerned \r\nabout large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing, despite the \r\nfact that it was officially banned many years ago, as \r\nwell as by the devastating impact of bottom trawling \r\non marine ecosystems. \r\n The third meeting of the Ad Hoc Open-ended \r\nInformal Working Group to study issues relating to the \r\nconservation and sustainable use of marine biological \r\ndiversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction should \r\npromote efforts in the areas of research, coordination, \r\nthe management of protected marine areas and \r\nenvironmental impact assessment procedures. Its \r\nexperience will continue to be useful in improving \r\nprotection for deep-sea and pelagic areas. \r\n On the eve of the deadline we set ourselves at the \r\nJohannesburg World Summit on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment for putting in place an ecosystem-based \r\napproach, and in line with our obligations under the \r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and \r\nthe Convention on Biological Diversity, it is crucial \r\nthat we establish representative networks for protected \r\nmarine areas so as to preserve their ecological and \r\nbiological wealth. Regional intergovernmental \r\nprocesses must also be strengthened. \r\n Against that backdrop, and with a view to the \r\nestablishment of a regulatory mechanism, it would \r\nseem essential to develop both marine evaluation \r\ncapabilities and capacities that are primarily based on \r\nbetter scientific understanding. \r\n Mr. Wetland (Norway): Next week, the attention \r\nof the international community will be directed \r\ntowards the United Nations Climate Change \r\nConference in Copenhagen. The effects and impacts of \r\nclimate change are evident to all of us, and we need to \r\nrespond urgently. We hope that the Conference will \r\nhave the necessary momentum and that the parties will \r\nshow the necessary political will and flexibility so that \r\nconcrete results can be achieved. \r\n The consequences of climate change are \r\nespecially visible and measurable in the Arctic. If ice-\r\nmelting continues and the polar ice cap continues to \r\ndiminish, new opportunities to exploit previously \r\ninaccessible resources and new shipping routes will \r\nemerge. We will thus face the challenge of balancing \r\nthe protection of the Arctic environment with the \r\norderly and sustainable use of its resources. \r\n The five Arctic Ocean coastal States — Canada, \r\nDenmark, the Russian Federation, the United States \r\nand Norway — have a special responsibility in that \r\nregard. In last year’s Ilulissat Declaration, they \r\nexpressed readiness to stand by their special \r\nresponsibilities on the basis of the extensive \r\ninternational legal framework that applies to the Arctic \r\nOcean, such as the law of the sea. \r\n Under the Arctic Council, negotiations on an \r\ninternational instrument regarding search and rescue in \r\nthe Arctic will commence next month. In the \r\nInternational Maritime Organization (IMO), we are \r\n A/64/PV.56\r\n \r\n17 09-63342 \r\n \r\nworking to strengthen the guidelines for ships \r\noperating in ice-covered waters — the so-called polar \r\ncode. We attach great importance to that work in the \r\nIMO, and we count on the active support of all \r\nMember States to make sure that a mandate for a \r\nrevision can be agreed upon in the meeting of IMO \r\nSubcommittee on Ship Design and Equipment in \r\nFebruary 2010. \r\n This year’s negotiations on the General Assembly \r\ndraft resolution on sustainable fisheries (A/64/L.29) \r\nincluded a review of resolution 61/105, of 2006, which, \r\ninter alia, encourages States to take action to protect \r\nvulnerable marine ecosystems from destructive fishing \r\npractices. Norway has worked actively to promote \r\naction against the use of fishing gear that may harm \r\nmarine biodiversity. We have done so in the North East \r\nAtlantic Fisheries Commission, the Northwest Atlantic \r\nFisheries Organization and the Commission for the \r\nConservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources. \r\nWe also played an active part in the development of the \r\nFood and Agriculture Organization (FAO) International \r\nGuidelines for the Management of Deep-Sea Fisheries \r\nin the High Seas. \r\n This year’s review and the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport on the issue (A/64/305) show that States have \r\ntaken significant measures to implement the 2006 \r\nresolution. However, it is also clear that considerable \r\nwork remains to be done in order to offer vulnerable \r\necosystems the necessary protection. We are happy that \r\nboth those points are reflected in the draft resolution. \r\nThe goals set out are ambitious, and they need to be in \r\norder to prevent further damage from the use of \r\ndestructive fishing practices. States and regional \r\nfisheries management organizations must assume their \r\nfull responsibility in that regard. \r\n Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing \r\nseriously undermines efforts to conserve and manage \r\nfish stocks in a sustainable manner. It is particularly \r\nharmful to developing countries. Such fishing also has \r\nsevere negative effects on food security and \r\nenvironmental protection all over the world. \r\n An important milestone in the global fight against \r\nIUU fishing was reached last August when, in the \r\nframework of FAO, we managed to finalize the \r\nAgreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter \r\nand Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated \r\nFishing. Those negotiations were initiated by Norway \r\nin 2005 because we saw the need for a global approach \r\nto prevent the landing of IUU fish. The agreement was \r\napproved by the FAO Conference and signed by \r\nNorway on 22 November. This is an important \r\ninstrument for better global port-State control. We \r\nencourage all States to become parties to the \r\nAgreement as soon as possible. \r\n The establishment of the outer limits of the \r\ncontinental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles is a central \r\nelement in the implementation of the law of the sea \r\nregime. The delineation process clarifies the legal \r\nframework for future shelf activities. Such clarity also \r\nentails significant positive development implications. \r\n Norway submitted documentation concerning the \r\nlimits of our continental shelf in the High North in \r\n2006, and received the recommendations from the \r\nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf \r\nearlier this year. We were impressed by the work of the \r\nmembers of the Commission and I take this \r\nopportunity to commend them for their efforts. The \r\nDivision for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea \r\n(DOALOS) also deserves praise for its contribution to \r\nthe work and functioning of the Commission. States \r\nmust now work together to secure for the Commission \r\nand DOALOS the resources they need to continue their \r\nwork in this important field. \r\n Many developing countries face particular \r\nchallenges in preparing documentation for their \r\nsubmissions. We heard testimony to that effect from \r\nmy colleague from Nauru earlier today. States with the \r\nnecessary financial and technical resources must \r\ntherefore assist developing countries in the preparation \r\nof those submissions. \r\n At the eighteenth Meeting of States Parties, in \r\nJune 2008, we worked actively for the decision \r\ncontained in document SPLOS/183, to the effect that \r\ndeveloping countries can submit preliminary \r\ninformation indicative of the outer limits of their \r\ncontinental shelves. Norway has also assisted 10 \r\nAfrican States in their preparation of such preliminary \r\ninformation to be submitted to the Secretary-General \r\nbefore the deadline. In that endeavour, we had close \r\nand fruitful cooperation with the Shelf Programme of \r\nthe United Nations Environment Programme, as \r\nrepresented by the Global Resource Information \r\nDatabase at Arendal, Norway, as well as with the \r\nEconomic Community of West African States and the \r\nSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General for \r\nSomalia. We also received valuable advice from the \r\nA/64/PV.56  \r\n \r\n09-63342 18 \r\n \r\nUnited Nations Office for West Africa. We are now \r\nstudying how we can best provide those African coastal \r\nStates with technical and financial assistance in order \r\nto prepare full submissions to the Commission. \r\n Piracy and armed robbery off the coast of \r\nSomalia and in the Gulf of Aden continue to threaten \r\nthe people of Somalia, the whole region and a series of \r\nprotective interests. Those interests include innocent \r\nlives, humanitarian supplies and international \r\ncommerce and navigation. Some 1,000 Norwegian-\r\nowned ships pass through the Gulf of Aden every year. \r\nWe are therefore directly affected, and are acting \r\naccordingly. \r\n We co-sponsored Security Council resolution \r\n1897 (2009) of 30 November 2009. We highly \r\nappreciate the work of the Contact Group on Piracy off \r\nthe Coast of Somalia, which was established in January \r\n2009. Norway participates in the work of the four \r\nworking groups under the Contact Group. In January \r\n2010, we will chair the fifth meeting of the Contact \r\nGroup itself. Norway also contributes, with one frigate, \r\nto the European Union-led Operation Atalanta in the \r\nGulf of Aden. International cooperation to ensure \r\nsecurity for international shipping off the coast of \r\nSomalia must continue, as must cooperation to improve \r\nthe situation on land in Somalia in order to address the \r\nroot causes of the problem. \r\n Mr. Nguyen Duy Chien (Viet Nam): At the \r\noutset, my delegation wishes to welcome the continued \r\nconsideration by the General Assembly of the agenda \r\nitem relating to developments in ocean affairs and the \r\nlaw of the sea. We thank the Secretary-General and the \r\nSecretariat, and in particular the Division for Ocean \r\nAffairs and the Law of the Sea, for the reports on \r\noceans and the law of the sea and on sustainable \r\nfisheries. We also thank the two coordinators for their \r\nhard work in conducting the negotiations on the two \r\ndraft resolutions that have been introduced under this \r\nagenda item (A/64/L.18 and A/64/L.29). \r\n The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law \r\nof the Sea (UNCLOS) provides a comprehensive and \r\nsound legal framework for all ocean issues and ocean-\r\nrelated activities. The nearly universal acceptance of \r\nUNCLOS by the international community is a \r\nreflection of our cherished goals of promoting the \r\noptimal use of the world’s oceans and seas in \r\nconformity with the principles of justice and equal \r\nrights. Every effort must be made to fully implement \r\nUNCLOS, with due respect for the delicate balance \r\nbetween the rights and obligations of States contained \r\nin its provisions. \r\n Viet Nam commends the International Seabed \r\nAuthority, the International Tribunal for the Law of the \r\nSea and the Commission on the Limits of the \r\nContinental Shelf for the great amount of work they \r\nhave taken on in the past year. We note with \r\nsatisfaction the efforts of UNCLOS States parties, \r\nespecially developing countries, to fulfil their \r\nobligation to make submissions to the Commission or \r\nto inform the Commission of their intention to make \r\nsubmissions establishing the outer limits of their \r\ncontinental shelves beyond 200 miles. \r\n Viet Nam is of the view that every submission \r\nmade to the Commission by States parties should be \r\nconsidered by the Commission in accordance with the \r\nprovisions of UNCLOS. The Commission now has a \r\nclearer picture for organizing its working schedules. It \r\nwill need stronger support from us to accomplish its \r\nheavy work load in the years ahead. \r\n Thanks to the flexibility shown by all regional \r\ngroups of States parties, important decisions were \r\nmade at the nineteenth Meeting of States Parties to \r\nUNCLOS, held in June 2009, with regard to the \r\nallocation of seats on the Commission and the \r\nTribunal. My delegation calls on all UNCLOS States \r\nparties to adhere strictly to those decisions in the future \r\nelections to those bodies. \r\n My delegation recognizes the contribution of the \r\nOpen-ended Informal Consultative Process to \r\nstrengthening the annual debate of the General \r\nAssembly on oceans and the law of the sea. At the \r\ntenth meeting of the Consultative Process, Member \r\nStates made great efforts in assessing the achievements \r\nand shortcomings of the past nine meetings and in \r\nrecommending ways to move the Process forward. My \r\ndelegation fully supports the view expressed by the \r\nGroup of 77 and China that the Process should be \r\ncarried out in full accordance with UNCLOS, taking \r\ninto account the agreements reached at the United \r\nNations Conference on Environment and Development, \r\nin particular chapter 17 of Agenda 21. \r\n Against the backdrop of this assessment of all the \r\ndevelopments relating to oceans and the law of the sea, \r\nthe Government of Viet Nam supports the two draft \r\nresolutions on which the General Assembly will take \r\naction today. \r\n A/64/PV.56\r\n \r\n19 09-63342 \r\n \r\n As a developing coastal State that borders the \r\nSouth China Sea — which is known to all Vietnamese \r\npeople as the Eastern Sea — Viet Nam attaches great \r\nimportance to adopting and implementing policies that \r\npromote legitimate and sustainable uses of maritime \r\nspace and resources for economic development, as \r\nprovided for by UNCLOS. It is no secret that \r\nmaintaining peace and stability in the South China Sea \r\nnot only meets the interests of the States adjacent to \r\nthat important sea area, but also makes a valuable \r\ncontribution to the world’s peace and security. It is \r\ntherefore essential for all States in the South China Sea \r\nregion to work together more closely in order to reach \r\nmutual understandings so as to make the South China \r\nSea a peaceful and stable zone. \r\n The conclusion and implementation of the \r\nDeclaration on the Conduct of the Parties in the South \r\nChina Sea by the member countries of the Association \r\nof Southeast Asian Nations and China constitutes a \r\nsignificant step in that direction. The Vietnamese \r\nGovernment strongly believes that the successful \r\nimplementation of the Declaration and the elaboration \r\nand adoption of a code of conduct in the South China \r\nSea that fully respects the legal framework provided by \r\nUNCLOS, will provide a more conducive environment \r\nfor peace, stability and economic development in the \r\nregion. For its part, the Government of Viet Nam is \r\ncommitted to making every effort to work with all \r\nneighbouring States for the sake of the peace, stability \r\nand prosperity of all peoples sharing the South China \r\nSea. \r\n Mr. Al-Ateeqi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I am pleased to convey to the President our \r\ndeep gratitude and appreciation for all the outstanding \r\nand effective efforts he is making to conduct this \r\nsession of the General Assembly. We would also like to \r\nthank the Secretary-General for his reports, submitted \r\nin accordance with paragraphs 128 and 173 of \r\nresolution 63/111, relating to ocean affairs and the law \r\nof the sea. \r\n The State of Kuwait welcomes the contents of the \r\nreport of the Secretary-General on oceans and the law \r\nof the sea (A/64/66). We would like to emphasize that \r\nthe collective patrimony of the seas and oceans belongs \r\nto humankind as a whole. In addition, friendly relations \r\nbetween all States must include adherence to the \r\nprinciples of justice and equality in the enactment of a \r\nglobal economic system that is based on protecting the \r\nmarine environment and maintaining the sustainability \r\nof the oceans, so as to achieve progress and prosperity \r\nfor the peoples of the world. \r\n The State of Kuwait would also like to welcome \r\nthe ongoing increase in the number of States parties to \r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, \r\nwhich this year has reached 159 States. That proves the \r\nimportance of the Convention at the global and \r\nregional levels. In that regard, my country calls on \r\nStates that have not yet joined the Convention to do so \r\nin order to attain universal participation, achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and promote \r\ninternational peace and security. \r\n Acts of piracy and armed robbery against ships \r\ncontinue to pose a threat to trade and commercial \r\nshipping. It also threatens the lives of sailors who work \r\nonboard those ships. My country’s delegation therefore \r\ncondemns all acts of piracy, hijacking of commercial \r\nships and terrorism that occur on the oceans and seas, \r\nin particular the acts of piracy that take place in the \r\nGulf of Aden and off the Somali coast. According to \r\nthe International Maritime Bureau, the majority of \r\nthose incidents occurred off the Somali coast during \r\nthe first six months of this year. To counter such acts of \r\npiracy and armed robbery against ships, the \r\ninternational community must coordinate all its efforts \r\nby effectively implementing international law, the law \r\nof the sea and all other legal instruments to confront \r\npirates and to prosecute criminals. \r\n My country’s delegation commends the Security \r\nCouncil’s adoption, under Chapter VII of the Charter, \r\nof resolution 1846 (2008) of 2 December 2008. That \r\nresolution emphasizes the importance of fostering \r\ninternational efforts to combat piracy off the Somali \r\ncoast by expanding the scope of mandates of regional \r\nStates and organizations working with Somali officials \r\nin order to achieve that goal. \r\n The State of Kuwait joined the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea in 1986. \r\nSubsequently, in 2002, it acceded to the Agreement \r\nrelating to the implementation of Part XI of the \r\nConvention. Kuwait is also a party to the Protocol \r\nconcerning Marine Pollution Resulting from \r\nExploration and Exploitation of the Continental Shelf. \r\nIt is for that reason that the State of Kuwait would like \r\nto emphasize the need for respecting international law \r\nand relevant international conventions and for \r\nguaranteeing their effective implementation, in \r\nparticular with regard to marine safety and security. \r\nA/64/PV.56  \r\n \r\n09-63342 20 \r\n \r\nThat should be done by ensuring that flag States fulfil \r\ntheir responsibilities in the course of innocent or \r\ntransient passage, as well as by taking all the measures \r\nstipulated under international law to guarantee the \r\nrights of each State. \r\n In conclusion, the State of Kuwait believes that \r\ninternational efforts must be intensified in order to \r\nensure understanding of the effects of climate change \r\non the marine environment and on marine biodiversity \r\nand to find appropriate ways and means for adaptation \r\nto those changes. Those efforts must also include \r\nbuilding the capacities of developing countries and the \r\ntransfer of technology to them, so as to preserve the \r\nmarine environment and achieve sustainable \r\ndevelopment in the oceans and the seas. \r\n The State of Kuwait urges all Member States to \r\nexpand their good offices with a view to improving \r\npeople’s lives while also preserving the marine \r\nenvironment, its resources and their optimal use. That \r\ncan be done by adhering to the provisions of \r\ninternational conventions and rules that guarantee the \r\nrights of peoples to use marine resources in an \r\nequitable and just fashion, thereby securing for all the \r\nsustainability of the marine environment and \r\npromoting international peace and security. \r\n Mr. Budiman (Indonesia): At the outset, allow \r\nme to express our gratitude to the Secretary-General \r\nfor his comprehensive reports on ocean affairs and the \r\nlaw of the sea contained in documents A/64/66 and \r\nAdd.1 and Add.2. We also wish to thank the Division \r\nfor Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea and the \r\nSecretariat for their valuable support in the \r\nconsideration of issues related to the law of the sea \r\nduring this session. \r\n Indonesia continues to participate actively in the \r\nconsideration of issues related to the law of the sea, \r\nincluding fisheries, the maritime environment and \r\nnavigation. There are two main reasons for our interest. \r\nFirst, we are the largest archipelagic State in the world, \r\noccupying a position of strategic importance between \r\nthe Asian and Australian continents and within most of \r\nthe important Asian waters. \r\n Secondly, the United Nations Convention on the \r\nLaw of the Sea (UNCLOS) is one of the most \r\nimportant constitutive instruments in international law \r\nregulating the uses of one of the world’s largest set of \r\nresources. \r\n On the issue of the safety of navigation and \r\nmaritime security, I wish to take this opportunity to \r\nunderline our unwavering commitment to suppressing \r\narmed robbery and piracy on the high seas adjacent to \r\nwaters within our national jurisdiction. Indonesia, \r\ntogether with other littoral States, continues to \r\nstrengthen cooperation in combating armed robbery \r\nand piracy in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore. We \r\nare pleased that those concerted measures have \r\nsignificantly decreased incidents of piracy and armed \r\nrobbery against ships in the region. \r\n As far as the situation off the coast of Somalia is \r\nconcerned, Indonesia notes the adoption of Security \r\nCouncil resolution 1897 (2009) on 30 November 2009. \r\nIn this regard, my delegation also recalls Council \r\nresolutions 1816 (2008), 1831 (2008), 1838 (2008), \r\n1844 (2008), 1846 (2008) and 1851 (2008), which were \r\nadopted to narrowly address piracy and armed robbery \r\ncommitted against ships off the coast of Somalia. \r\nTherefore, the authorization granted under those \r\nresolutions does not affect rights or obligations or \r\nresponsibilities under international law, including any \r\nrights or obligations under UNCLOS, and they are not \r\nconsidered to establish customary international law. \r\n The Government of Indonesia attaches great \r\nimportance to the work of the Commission on the \r\nLimits of the Continental Shelf. We appreciate that, at \r\nits twenty-third session, the Commission began \r\nconsideration of our submission with respect to north-\r\nwest Sumatra, Indonesia. \r\n However, Indonesia is concerned about the recent \r\nwork overload that the Commission must be facing in \r\nview of the large number of submissions it has already \r\nreceived, as well as forthcoming submissions that \r\ncould impact on the Commission’s projected work \r\ntimetable. We hope that States actively participating in \r\nthe ongoing work of the informal working group \r\ndealing with the issue of the Commission’s workload \r\nwill contribute constructively. \r\n Furthermore, we encourage States to make \r\nadditional contributions to the two voluntary trust \r\nfunds established by resolution 55/7 with laudable \r\nobjectives. Those trust funds facilitate the preparation \r\nof submissions to the Commission by developing \r\nStates and are also used to defray the cost of the \r\nparticipation by developing States members of the \r\nCommission in meetings of the Commission and its \r\nsubcommissions. \r\n A/64/PV.56\r\n \r\n21 09-63342 \r\n \r\n Turning to fisheries issues, Indonesia is of the \r\nview that the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement is \r\nof paramount importance. For that reason, on \r\n28 September 2009, Indonesia ratified the Agreement \r\nfor the Implementation of the Provisions of the United \r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea of  \r\n10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation and \r\nManagement of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly \r\nMigratory Fish Stocks. \r\n Indonesia believes that that Agreement sets out \r\nprinciples for the conservation and management of fish \r\nstocks and provides for management based on a \r\nprecautionary approach and the best available scientific \r\ninformation. The Agreement also develops the \r\nfundamental principle established in the Convention \r\nthat States should cooperate to ensure conservation and \r\npromote the objective of optimally utilizing fisheries \r\nresources both within and beyond their exclusive \r\neconomic zones. By ratifying and implementing the \r\nAgreement, Indonesia joins the international \r\ncommunity in its efforts to sustainably manage fish \r\nstocks and their link to the marine environment. \r\n We continue to be very concerned about illegal, \r\nunregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing activities \r\nthat threaten the sustainability of fish stock resources. \r\nIndonesia is of the view that such fishing is a global \r\nproblem that undercuts responsible fishing activities. It \r\nundermines conservation and enforcement efforts and \r\ndistorts trade and prices in export markets. In the light \r\nof that, Indonesia welcomes the adoption by the Food \r\nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations on \r\n22 November 2009 of the Agreement on Port State \r\nMeasures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, \r\nUnreported and Unregulated Fishing. \r\n The Agreement recognizes that States have the \r\nsovereign right to decide which foreign vessels may \r\nenter their ports, in particular as regards vessels that \r\nundertake or support IUU fishing activities, building on \r\nexisting measures taken in some regional fisheries \r\nmanagement organizations. Obviously, the effectiveness \r\nof the Agreement depends on its wide ratification and \r\nimplementation. But it is hoped that the agreement will \r\nhelp block IUU-caught fish from entering international \r\nmarkets, thereby removing an important incentive for \r\nsome fishermen to engage in illicit fishing. \r\n Issues related to oceans and climate change \r\ncontinue to be of serious concern for coastal States. \r\nIndonesia’s unique situation has caused us to undertake \r\nspecial initiatives to increase our awareness of the \r\nimpact of climate change in connection with the ocean \r\nand of the ocean’s possible role in addressing the \r\nchallenge of climate change. That is why, for the \r\nsecond consecutive year, Indonesia supports the \r\ninsertion of a paragraph concerning climate change and \r\nthe oceans in the draft resolution on oceans and the law \r\nof the sea. \r\n Indonesia is pleased that the draft resolution we \r\nare about to adopt makes reference to the need to \r\nimprove understanding of the impact of climate change \r\non the ocean, following on the World Ocean \r\nConference, which was held in Manado, Indonesia, in \r\nMay this year, at which the Manado Ocean Declaration \r\nwas adopted. We believe that the Declaration will \r\ncontribute to shedding light on the new challenges we \r\nface in promoting healthier oceans for the socio-\r\neconomic benefit of present and future generations. \r\n The Declaration also emphasizes the need for the \r\ninternational community to work together for improved \r\nunderstanding of the impact of oceans on climate \r\nchange and vice versa, and its effects on marine \r\necosystems, marine biodiversity and coastal \r\ncommunities. \r\n The Declaration underscores the importance of \r\nincorporating ocean-sensitive policies into climate \r\nchange policy at the global level within the existing \r\nframework of the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change, thereby making sure \r\nthat the concerns of ocean communities and coastal \r\ncountries will be taken into account without necessarily \r\ncreating new processes that might duplicate existing \r\nones. \r\n Lastly, with regard to consultations, we wish to \r\nunderline the importance and value of the informal, \r\nopen and inclusive nature of the consultative process \r\nfor discussions on ocean affairs within the United \r\nNations system. \r\n Before concluding, I would like to take this \r\nopportunity to thank the coordinators of the law of the \r\nsea and the sustainable fisheries resolutions, \r\nAmbassador Henrique Valle of Brazil and Ms. Holly \r\nKoehler of the United States of America, for their able \r\nleadership and excellent contribution to the work on \r\nthe two resolutions before us today. \r\n Mr. Tladi (South Africa): I am grateful for the \r\nopportunity to take the floor on this very important \r\nA/64/PV.56  \r\n \r\n09-63342 22 \r\n \r\ntopic, that of oceans and the law of the sea. I am also \r\nhappy to associate myself with the statement delivered \r\nby the Permanent Representative of Benin, who spoke \r\non behalf of the Group of African States.  \r\n This debate gives us an opportunity to reflect on \r\nour activities over the sixty-third session and look \r\nforward to forthcoming activities at the sixty-fourth \r\nsession. We should, as we reflect and look forward, be \r\ncontinually guided by the United Nations Convention \r\non the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which constitutes \r\nthe framework within which all activities in the oceans \r\ntake place. In reflecting on those activities, we should \r\nbe ever mindful of the opportunities, challenges and \r\nprospects in our efforts to create an oceans governance \r\nsystem underpinned by sustainable development. \r\n My delegation is unwavering in its belief in the \r\nuniversal character of UNCLOS and that large parts of \r\nit constitute customary international law binding on all \r\nStates, whether State party or not. We are particularly \r\npleased to welcome Chad, the Dominican Republic and \r\nSwitzerland, which have, since our last debate on the \r\nagenda item, become States parties to the Convention, \r\nthereby bringing the total number of States parties to \r\n160. We hope that in the near future all Member States \r\nof the United Nations will accede to the Convention so \r\nthat this instrument, the “Constitution of the oceans”, \r\ncan achieve quantitative universality. \r\n We hope also that those States parties that are not \r\nas yet party to the two implementing agreements of the \r\nConvention, namely the Agreement relating to the \r\nImplementation of Part XI of the Convention on the \r\nLaw of the Sea of 10 December 1982 and the \r\nAgreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of \r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea \r\nof 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation and \r\nManagement of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly \r\nMigratory Fish Stocks, will accede to those agreements \r\nsooner rather than later. \r\n We welcome the outcome of the negotiations on \r\nthe draft omnibus resolution on oceans and the law of \r\nthe sea and are proud, once again, to co-sponsor the \r\nresolution. We also welcome the fruitful deliberations \r\non the draft fisheries resolution. It was on 8 December \r\n2006 that the General Assembly adopted resolution \r\n61/105, which contained provisions on bottom fishing. \r\n In that resolution we called on the regional \r\nfisheries management organizations (RFMOs) and \r\narrangements with competence to regulate bottom \r\nfisheries to adopt and implement certain measures to \r\nprotect vulnerable marine ecosystems. In the resolution \r\nwe also called for a review of those measures at the \r\ncurrent session. In his report on actions taken by States \r\nand RFMOs in the implementation of resolution \r\n61/105, contained in A/64/305, the Secretary-General \r\nnoted that, while progress has been made, \r\nimplementation of the resolution had been uneven and \r\nthat further efforts were needed.  \r\n We are of the view that more could be done to \r\nprotect vulnerable marine ecosystems from the damage \r\nthat can occur as a result of bottom fishing than the \r\nprotective regulations laid out in resolution 61/105. We \r\nremain optimistic, however, that the approach we have \r\ntaken this year, the result of consensus, will contribute \r\nto the cultivation of more sustainable fishing practices. \r\nWe are particularly hopefully that in 2011, when we \r\nmeet to yet again review the measures we have \r\nadopted, sterner regulations will have been adopted \r\nand wider implementation recorded. \r\n It will come as no surprise to many here that my \r\ndelegation attaches particular importance to Part XI of \r\nthe Convention. We therefore continue to push for the \r\nearly implementation and operationalization of the \r\ncommon heritage of humanity principle, as reflected in \r\nPart XI. For that reason, my delegation is an active \r\nparticipant in the deliberations of the International \r\nSeabed Authority (ISA). \r\n We are concerned at the apparent inability of the \r\nCouncil of the International Seabed Authority to \r\nfinalize regulations on polymetallic sulphides. We are \r\nencouraged by the fact that only a few contentious \r\nissues, including the question of overlapping claims \r\nand the anti-monopoly provision, remain. Nonetheless, \r\nwe urge delegations to do their utmost to ensure that a \r\nconsensus is reached on those outstanding issues. \r\n We believe that the Convention, in particular \r\nAnnex III, entitled “Basic Conditions of Prospecting, \r\nExploration and Exploitation”, provides a sound basis \r\nfor enabling the finalization of outstanding issues at \r\nthe next meeting of the Authority in April 2010. \r\n For us, the common heritage of humanity \r\nprinciple is not only an esoteric concept, but a \r\nprinciple of international law. We are thus concerned at \r\nthe lack of its implementation and operationalization \r\nowing to, inter alia, the non-completion of the \r\nregulations. \r\n A/64/PV.56\r\n \r\n23 09-63342 \r\n \r\n Another factor having a negative impact on the \r\nfull implementation of Part XI of the Convention is the \r\ndifficulty encountered in the establishment of the outer \r\nlimits of the continental shelf, as provided for in \r\narticle 76 of the Convention. South Africa sent its \r\ncontinental shelf submission to the Commission on the \r\nLimits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS) in May of this \r\nyear, in accordance with the Convention and yet, owing \r\nto the workload of the Commission, the prognosis is \r\nthat a subcommission to consider the South African \r\nsubmission will only be formed in 2019. \r\n That is a most unsatisfactory situation. We have \r\nno doubt that the only solution to that difficulty will be \r\nto have longer and/or more frequent sessions of the \r\nCommission. Indeed, there may be legal, technical and \r\nfinancial constraints. But the significance of the \r\nendeavours to establish the limits of the continental \r\nshelf leads me, unavoidably, to a cliché, namely, that \r\n“where there is a will, there is a way”. We therefore \r\ncall on States to consider innovative ways to facilitate \r\nthe funding of such longer and/or more frequent \r\nsessions of the CLCS. \r\n The Open-ended Informal Consultative Process \r\non Oceans and the Law of the Sea (UNICPOLOS) held \r\nits review in June of this year. We are pleased that, \r\nafter much discussion, the vast majority of delegations \r\nthat took part in UNICPOLOS discussions were \r\nsupportive and saw it as an important forum to \r\ndeliberate, in an informal manner, issues pertaining to \r\noceans and the law of the sea, with a view to \r\nstrengthening coordination and contributing to the \r\ndeliberations of the General Assembly under the \r\nagenda item. \r\n We were also particularly pleased that attendees \r\nat the meeting recognized the centrality of sustainable \r\ndevelopment as the prism through which those issues \r\nought to be discussed. My delegation wishes to \r\nreiterate its commitment to UNICPOLOS and looks \r\nforward to working with other delegations to \r\nstrengthen that important forum for the law of the sea. \r\nWe are pleased that in the next session we will have an \r\nopportunity to discuss an issue that has not been given \r\nsufficient follow-up, namely, capacity-building in \r\noceans affairs and the law of the sea, including marine \r\nscientific research. \r\n I now wish to make some brief observations on a \r\nforthcoming issue that is of particular importance to \r\nmy delegation. In February 2010, the Ad Hoc Open-\r\nended Working Group to study issues relating to the \r\nconservation and sustainable use of marine biological \r\ndiversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction will \r\nmeet. That will provide us with an opportunity to make \r\nprogress on key issues relating to marine biodiversity \r\nbeyond national jurisdiction. \r\n Some of the key questions that will be \r\nconfronting us will be how to improve the governance \r\nof the oceans, so as to ensure better protection of the \r\nmarine environment in accordance with the \r\nConvention. Another issue that is sure to confront us \r\nwill be the question of marine genetic resources and, in \r\nparticular, whether the common heritage of humanity \r\nprinciple is applicable thereto — that is, the “legal \r\nregime” debate. \r\n The view of my delegation, which is rooted in the \r\ncall for solidarity embodied in sustainable \r\ndevelopment, is well known and can be summed up by \r\nwhat we said in 2008 during the last meeting of the Ad \r\nHoc Working Group, namely, that the common heritage \r\nof mankind principle is not solely about benefit \r\nsharing. It is just as much about conservation and \r\npreservation. The principle is about solidarity; \r\nsolidarity in the preservation and conservation of a \r\ngood we all share and therefore should protect. \r\nSolidarity also implies joint efforts to ensure that this \r\ngood, which we all share, is for all our benefit. \r\n It is our hope that the meeting of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group in February will come up concrete \r\nproposals on how to move issues relating to conservation \r\nand sustainable use of marine biodiversity in areas \r\nbeyond national jurisdiction forward. From the \r\nperspective of my delegation, it is clear that moving \r\nforward must, somehow, involve discussion about an \r\nimplementing agreement to give expression to the clear \r\nprovisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law \r\nof the Sea, namely, that the Area and its resources — not \r\njust some of its resources, but all of them — are the \r\ncommon heritage of humanity. \r\n We trust that, as we make preparations for how \r\nwe will participate at this forthcoming meeting, we will \r\nremember that what is at stake is not only the narrow \r\ncommercial interests of some. What is at stake is the \r\nhealth of our marine environment and the humanity, \r\nwhich can only be reflected in our solidarity in \r\nensuring equitable access for all. \r\n Mr. Muchemi (Kenya): Allow me to start by \r\ncongratulating you, Mr. President, on your election as \r\nA/64/PV.56  \r\n \r\n09-63342 24 \r\n \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth \r\nsession. I also convey to the other members of the \r\nBureau warm congratulations for their elections. My \r\ndelegation assures you of its support and full \r\ncooperation during your tenure. \r\n My delegation fully aligns itself with the \r\nstatement delivered by the representative of Benin on \r\nbehalf of the African States. \r\n Kenya expresses its appreciation and recognition \r\nfor the key role the United Nations continues to play in \r\nmatters relating to the law of the sea. I would like to \r\ncommend the good work of the Secretariat of the \r\nDivision for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea \r\nunder the able leadership of Mr. Serguei Tarassenko, \r\nand to thank them for their support, in particular during \r\nthe recent informal consultations. \r\n My delegation notes with appreciation the various \r\nreports of the Secretary-General on the subject of \r\noceans and the law of the sea. We also appreciate the \r\ntext of the draft resolution on oceans and the law of the \r\nsea, resulting from this year’s informal consultations in \r\nthe General Assembly, and the draft on sustainable \r\nfisheries, both of which we are pleased to sponsor. I \r\nnow wish to comment on some of the issues that are of \r\ngreat concern to my delegation. \r\n Kenya is among the many coastal States that \r\ndelivered their submissions on the continental shelf \r\nbeyond 200 nautical miles to the Commission on the \r\nLimits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS) within the \r\nstipulated deadline of 13 May 2009. This was followed \r\nby an oral presentation made before the Commission at \r\nits twenty-fourth session on 3 September 2009. \r\n At an early stage in the preparation of its \r\nsubmission, Kenya noted with concern the anticipated \r\nheavy workload of the Commission that will be \r\noccasioned by the considerable number of States filing \r\ntheir submissions to the Commission in compliance \r\nwith the deadline set for delineation of the extended \r\ncontinental shelf. Some 51 submissions have already \r\nbeen received and many others are expected. The \r\nCommission will subsequently be faced with the huge \r\nworkload of examining all the submissions within an \r\nacceptable time frame. This places a huge and \r\nunprecedented burden on both the Commission and the \r\nsecretariat of the Division. \r\n During the nineteenth Meeting of States Parties to \r\nthe Convention, the Chairman of the Commission \r\npresented to the plenary a tentative timetable detailing \r\nwhen the 51 submissions already received might be \r\nconsidered. The situation as projected would result in a \r\nconsiderable time lapse between the preparation of \r\nsubmissions and their consideration by the \r\nCommission, a scenario that is obviously unacceptable \r\nto my country, considering that it will greatly \r\njeopardize our submission. The problem is \r\ncompounded further by difficulties associated with the \r\nretention of the expertise that was directly responsible \r\nfor the preparation of the submission, including the \r\nloss of institutional memory. \r\n Kenya welcomes the recommendations contained \r\nin paragraphs 52 and 53 of the omnibus draft resolution \r\nencouraging States to participate actively and \r\nconstructively in the ongoing work of the informal \r\nWorking Group established by States parties to find \r\npractical ways of resolving this matter. My country is \r\nready to support proposals aimed at accelerating the \r\nwork of the Commission, and will forward its views to \r\nthe Working Group before the February 2010 deadline \r\nfor the submission of comments and suggestions. We \r\nare convinced that the outcome of the Meeting of \r\nStates Parties in June 2010 should be informed by the \r\nrecommendations submitted to the Working Group for \r\nincorporation into the Secretary-General’s report on the \r\nproblem, which is contained in document SPLOS/157. \r\n The issue of piracy and armed robbery against \r\nships at sea off the coast of Somalia is of grave concern \r\nto my country. These activities have greatly affected \r\ntrade and commerce in the entire subregion. In \r\naddition, acts of piracy have led to artificial shortages \r\nof food and other essential commodities. This poses a \r\nserious security risk that, if left unchecked, could cause \r\na serious crisis and much instability in the entire \r\nregion. \r\n Although efforts by the international community, \r\nincluding the establishment of a Contact Group on \r\nPiracy off the Coast of Somalia, have had some \r\ndeterrent effect on piracy and armed robbery in our \r\nregion, more needs to be done. In particular, it appears \r\nthat apprehended pirates are being prosecuted mainly \r\nin Kenyan courts. This burden weighs heavily on \r\nKenya, in terms of financial cost and security \r\nexposure, and we call upon all other nations to \r\nparticipate in this endeavour. \r\n Capacity-building is an area that is regarded with \r\ngreat interest by my country. The lack of capacity and \r\n A/64/PV.56\r\n \r\n25 09-63342 \r\n \r\ntechnical know-how has immensely contributed to the \r\ninability of developing countries to exploit and utilize \r\nmarine resources, especially those found within their \r\nnational jurisdictions. Needless to say, this has also \r\naggravated illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. \r\nWe appreciate the assistance extended to Kenya by the \r\nDivision and by the Trust Fund for the purpose of \r\nfacilitating the preparation of submissions by \r\ndeveloping countries to the Commission. It is of vital \r\nimportance to strengthen cooperation to facilitate the \r\ntransfer of technology to developing nations. In this \r\nregard, we urge States and other relevant international \r\norganizations and institutions with the ability to do so \r\nto increase funding, training opportunities and other \r\ncapacity-building-related activities for developing \r\nnations. \r\n In conclusion, my delegation reaffirms its \r\ncommitment to the ideals enshrined in the United \r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea and \r\nreassures the President of the General Assembly of its \r\nsupport. We look forward to the fruitful deliberations \r\nof this body under his able guidance. \r\n Mr. Gutiérrez García (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nWe reaffirm the fundamental importance of the United \r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea in \r\nmaintaining and strengthening peace, order and the \r\nsustainable development of the oceans and seas. \r\n Cuba places particular emphasis on the need to \r\nstrengthen international cooperation among all \r\nstakeholders participating in the management of seas \r\nand oceans, including knowledge exchange and \r\ncapacity-building, which are of vital significance for \r\ndeveloping countries. \r\n For my country, as an island located in the \r\ndelicate ecosystem of the Caribbean Sea, issues \r\nrelating to the seas and the oceans are of particular \r\ninterest. Despite the serious economic hardships that it \r\nfaces, Cuba has carried out and continues to carry out \r\ngreat efforts to implement national strategies for \r\nsustainable development and for the protection of the \r\nmarine environment, with a view to achieving a \r\ncoherent, progressive and effective implementation of \r\nthe Convention’s provisions. \r\n The United Nations Convention on the Law of \r\nthe Sea establishes the proper and universally accepted \r\nlegal framework within which all of the activities on \r\nthe oceans and seas must be carried out. We are, \r\ntherefore, concerned by policies and initiatives that are \r\nundermining the regime of the Convention, such as the \r\nmanagement being assigned to new sustainable uses of \r\noceans, including the conservation and management of \r\nmarine biological biodiversity of sea beds beyond areas \r\nof national jurisdiction. In this respect, States must \r\nabide by the principles established in the Convention, \r\nwhich provides that marine scientific research in such \r\nareas must be carried out exclusively for peaceful \r\npurposes and for the benefit of humanity as a whole. \r\n We warmly welcome the work of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group of the Whole tasked with \r\nrecommending a course of action to the General \r\nAssembly on the regular process for global reporting \r\nand assessment of the state of the marine environment, \r\nincluding socioeconomic aspects. We welcome in \r\nparticular the recommendations annexed to its report. \r\nThis process must be carried out on the basis of respect \r\nfor the principles enshrined in the aforementioned \r\nrecommendations, which guarantee the full \r\ntransparency of the process and an equitable \r\ngeographic participation in all activities of the process. \r\nCuba believes that, under the supervision of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and in order to ensure greater \r\ncoherence, that process must have the ongoing \r\nassistance of the Division for Ocean Affairs and the \r\nLaw of the Sea. \r\n Matters concerning crime at sea must be \r\naddressed on a case-by-case basis. They require \r\nholistic solutions under international law and strict \r\nrespect for national jurisdictions. The Cuban State is \r\nendowed with a solid institutional basis and national \r\nlegislation when it comes to addressing crime at sea, in \r\nparticular with regard to the illicit traffic in narcotic \r\ndrugs and psychotropic substances, trafficking in \r\npersons and piracy. Likewise, intense work is being \r\ndone to continue to strengthen bilateral and regional \r\ncooperation, with due respect for the principles of \r\ninternational law and State sovereignty over territorial \r\nwaters and the management of resources in their \r\nexclusive economic zones. \r\n We would also like to underscore the importance \r\nof preserving the Convention’s integrity and the \r\nimplementation of its provisions as a whole, including \r\nrespect for the right of passage and the obligation of \r\nStates bordering straits to adopt laws and regulations \r\nrelating to transit passage through straits. \r\n Oceans and seas today face one of the greatest \r\nchallenges in history, namely, problems arising from \r\nA/64/PV.56  \r\n \r\n09-63342 26 \r\n \r\nclimate change on an unprecedented scale. Arctic ice \r\nthickness continues to decrease. Glaciers are receding. \r\nThe sea level is rising. Small island States run the risk \r\nof disappearing under water. \r\n The interconnected nature of ocean systems \r\nleaves no other option but for all States to cooperate to \r\nensure the protection of the global marine \r\nenvironment. Either we are all saved or no one is. \r\nDeveloped countries therefore have a responsibility to \r\nprovide assistance to developing countries at their \r\nrequest, so as to work together to protect oceans and \r\nseas. \r\n With regard to the 1995 Agreement for the \r\nImplementation of the Provisions of the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December \r\n1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of \r\nStraddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish \r\nStocks, Cuba is not a party to the Agreement, but we \r\ncomply in good faith with its major provisions on \r\nconservation and management. The main reason that \r\nhas prevented Cuba from becoming party to the \r\nAgreement has to do with its concern about the \r\nmechanism of visits and inspection aboard fishing \r\nvessels, which is provided for in articles 21 and 22 of \r\nthat instrument. \r\n I do not want to conclude without expressing our \r\nappreciation for the work done by the coordinators of \r\nthe two draft resolutions to be adopted on this topic, \r\nwhich Cuba will support. Likewise, owing to the \r\ngrowing importance of the issue of oceans and the law \r\nof the sea, there is a need to provide full conference \r\nand translation services for informal meetings to \r\nnegotiate such draft resolutions. That would contribute \r\nto the quality of the negotiations, so that they clearly \r\nreflect the interests of all States, in particular of \r\ndeveloping countries. \r\n Mr. Kohona (Sri Lanka): We would like to take \r\nthis opportunity to thank the two coordinators who \r\nhave guided us in the shaping the draft resolutions \r\nbefore us. We also wish to thank the Division for \r\nOcean Affairs and the Law of the Sea for the support it \r\nhas provided in that task. \r\n The United Nations Convention on the Law of \r\nthe Sea is the overarching instrument that provides the \r\nlegal framework for State activities relating to the seas \r\nand the oceans and for the regulation of the \r\nexploitation of their resources. It has been said that the \r\nConvention provides the constitution for the seas and \r\noceans. All States parties, and others, have a \r\nfundamental responsibility to protect the integrity of \r\nthe Convention. Many provisions of the Convention \r\nare now considered to be part of customary \r\ninternational law. \r\n In this statement, my delegation wishes to \r\naddress the issues of fisheries, climate change, the \r\ncontinental shelf and piracy. \r\n In relation to sub-item (b) of agenda item 76, on \r\nsustainable fisheries, the Convention on the Law of the \r\nSea provides for the protection and preservation of the \r\nmarine environment. The issue of fisheries \r\nmanagement has assumed much importance. Today, the \r\nregulation of the exploitation and preservation of the \r\nliving resources of the high seas, or the areas beyond \r\nthe limits of national jurisdiction, are governed by the \r\n1995 Straddling Fish Stocks Agreement and other \r\ninternational, regional and subregional arrangements. \r\nFishing activities have the most significant impact on \r\nmarine biodiversity in areas within and beyond \r\nnational jurisdiction. \r\n We are conscious of the overfishing of stocks, \r\nhabitat degradation from destructive fishing practices \r\nand the incidental capture of non-target species, \r\nincluding endangered species. My delegation welcomes \r\nthe steps taken by the United Nations and various \r\nagencies — such as the Food and Agriculture \r\nOrganization, the International Whaling Commission \r\nand the Forum Fisheries Agency — with regard to \r\nthose aspects. We encourage them to develop further \r\nstrategies to that end. \r\n Fish do not recognize national jurisdictions. As a \r\nnation that is surrounded by the sea and is substantially \r\ndependent upon the ocean, we would like to see \r\nfisheries beyond the limits of national jurisdiction \r\nbetter controlled through cooperative means. The \r\nIndian Ocean Tuna Commission is active in its \r\nnamesake region. However, there is a need for a \r\nregional fisheries management organization or \r\narrangement with wider powers and the capacity to \r\neffectively regulate all high-seas fisheries and the \r\nconservation of stocks in that vast expanse of ocean. \r\n While we endorse the adoption of international \r\nagreements, guidelines and practices for the better \r\nregulation of bottom fisheries, we are conscious of the \r\nneed to accommodate the difficulties that developing \r\ncountries may face, especially owing to the lack of \r\ncapacity, in enforcing such measures. Accordingly, we \r\n A/64/PV.56\r\n \r\n27 09-63342 \r\n \r\nare pleased that the negotiations led to the adoption of \r\nparagraph 121 in draft resolution A/64/L.29, which \r\nrecognizes the special circumstances and requirements \r\nof developing States and the specific challenges they \r\nmay face and gives full consideration to the section of \r\nthe guidelines on the special requirements of \r\ndeveloping countries. \r\n Sri Lanka would also like to refer to the study \r\nprepared by the Secretariat, which is contained in \r\ndocument A/63/342, with regard to the assistance \r\navailable to, and measures that may be taken by, \r\ndeveloping States to realize the benefits of the \r\nsustainable and effective development of marine \r\nresources and the uses of oceans. The scope of the \r\nstudy has now been extended to include areas beyond \r\nnational jurisdiction, which include the high seas. \r\n Oceans are indivisible ecosystems in which \r\nnational boundaries are products of political \r\nexpediency. Therefore, while jurisdiction over \r\nresources gives the needs of developing States with \r\nrespect to the sustainable development of maritime \r\nspace within national jurisdiction an urgent and \r\ndistinctive dimension, their needs in maritime space \r\nbeyond national jurisdiction are to be viewed in an \r\nintegrated manner. Sri Lanka therefore welcomes the \r\nsupplemental inclusive study to include the needs of \r\nthe developing States and the potential assistance \r\navailable to them with respect to the whole ecosystem \r\nof oceans, as envisaged in the draft resolution. Turning \r\nto sub-item (a) of agenda item 76 and the Commission \r\non the Limits of the Continental Shelf: my delegation \r\nconsiders that body to be most important, and we \r\nbelieve that measures should be taken immediately to \r\nsecure the effectiveness of the important work of the \r\nCommission. \r\n A matter of great concern is the Commission’s \r\nworkload. States were required to submit their claims \r\nto the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles by \r\n13 May 2009. Many States, at great expense and with \r\nthe use of outside technical expertise, made these \r\nsubmissions within the stipulated deadline. Sri Lanka \r\nwas one of them. However, the workload of the \r\nCommission and the slow progress it has made in \r\ndealing with the submissions have evoked great \r\nconcern. It is estimated that some claims already \r\nlodged may be examined as late as 2040. \r\n We are, in fact, pleased to have participated in the \r\nefforts to find practical solutions to this problem. We \r\nlook forward to positive results and appropriate \r\nmeasures being adopted by the twentieth Meeting of \r\nthe States Parties to the Law of the Sea Convention in \r\n2010 and by the sixty-fifth session of the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Climate change continues to figure prominently \r\non the international agenda, as human-induced changes \r\nto the climate continue to threaten the global \r\nenvironmental balance. The world’s oceans play a \r\ncritical role in sustaining life on earth by generating \r\noxygen and absorbing carbon dioxide from the \r\natmosphere, regulating climate and temperature and \r\nproviding essential resources. Changes to the climate \r\nhave a direct impact on the oceans and lead to a \r\nnumber of critical threats, such as sea-level rise and \r\nocean acidification. Such effects also impair the ability \r\nof marine and coastal ecosystems to provide food, \r\nincome, cultural identity and recreation to coastal \r\nresidents. Sea coasts are also a major source of tourism \r\nincome for many States. \r\n Many key climate indicators have already helped \r\nimprove our understanding of the patterns of natural \r\nvariability within which our societies and economies \r\nhave developed and thrived. Ocean warming appears to \r\nbe approximately 50 per cent greater than what we had \r\npredicted. New estimates suggest that by 2100 sea \r\nlevels could rise by one metre or more. The impacts of \r\nocean acidification on some major marine calcifiers \r\nalready appear to be detectable and some coastal \r\nwaters have become corrosive to the shells of various \r\nbottom-dwelling organisms. The oceans may be losing \r\nthe ability to absorb carbon dioxide. With unabated \r\nlevels of greenhouse-gas emissions, many climate \r\ntrends are likely to accelerate, leading to an increasing \r\nrisk of abrupt or irreversible climate shifts. \r\n The adverse effects of climate change on the \r\nmarine environment and marine biodiversity are \r\nmatters of serious concern and have to be addressed \r\nwith a sense of urgency. Research activities need to be \r\nenhanced to help us to better understand the effects of \r\nclimate change on the marine environment and \r\nbiodiversity, and to develop ways and means of \r\nadaptation. Research on ocean acidification has to be \r\npursued to address levels of ocean acidity and their \r\nnegative impact on vulnerable marine ecosystems, \r\nparticularly coral reefs. It is necessary, therefore, to \r\nrecognize the importance of improved understanding of \r\nthe impact of climate change on the oceans and to \r\nA/64/PV.56  \r\n \r\n09-63342 28 \r\n \r\nformulate and adopt mitigating strategies to overcome \r\nthem. \r\n Regarding piracy, my delegation expresses its \r\ngrave concern at the increase in the incidence of piracy, \r\nwhich poses a threat to maritime security and safety. \r\nThis has become a threat to global trade and a factor, \r\nfor instance, in insurance costs. We welcome the \r\nconcerted efforts made by some States to combat \r\npiracy. All types of vessels have been targeted, often by \r\nwell-armed criminals with rocket-propelled grenades \r\nand automatic weapons. More than 238 attacks \r\noccurred in the first six months of 2009 alone. Sri \r\nLanka is a party to the Regional Cooperation \r\nAgreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery \r\nagainst Ships in Asia (ReCAAP), which, with its \r\ninformation-sharing, has had positive effects in the \r\nregion. \r\n In addition to piracy, another threat to maritime \r\nsecurity is that posed by the transportation of large \r\nconsignments of sophisticated equipment and lethal \r\ncargo to provide logistical support to terrorist groups. \r\nIn recent years, Sri Lanka has experienced \r\nunprecedented and highly dangerous forms of maritime \r\nterrorism. Our navy has successfully confronted and \r\ninterdicted the movement of virtual floating \r\nwarehouses of arms and ammunition, posing a grave \r\nthreat to the security and stability of our country and \r\nour region. At the global level, this phenomenon calls \r\nfor a revision of existing laws pertaining to boarding \r\nand search of vessels in the high seas. We need a \r\ncomprehensive legal framework to address all aspects \r\nof safety and security of maritime navigation, going \r\nbeyond the current concerns with weapons of mass \r\ndestruction. This would make a distinct contribution to \r\nsecuring global peace and security. Sri Lanka strongly \r\nsupports paragraphs 68 to 83 of the draft resolution \r\n(A/64/L.18 and Corr.1) addressing the issues of piracy \r\nand armed robbery at sea. \r\n Finally, I would like to express our gratitude to \r\nMs. Patricia O’Brien, the United Nations Legal \r\nCounsel, for her undertaking to comply with the \r\nassurance given by her predecessor that the Hamilton \r\nShirley Amarasinghe Fellowship on the Law of the Sea \r\nwould continue with the next award in 2010. The \r\nFellowship has acquired much prestige, as it honours a \r\nprominent Sri Lankan who guided the third United \r\nNations Conference on the Law of the Sea from its \r\nvery inception and as Chair of the Ad Hoc Committee \r\non the Seabed and Ocean Floor till nearly the end of \r\nthe Conference. \r\n Mr. Gan (Singapore): I have the honour to speak \r\non sub-item (a) of agenda item 76, “Oceans and the \r\nlaw of the sea”. The Straits of Malacca and Singapore \r\nare one of the busiest international waterways in the \r\nworld, linking the Indian Ocean to the South China \r\nSea. On average, more than 900 ships use the Strait of \r\nSingapore every day, with more than 80 per cent of \r\nthese ships arriving and departing from the port of \r\nSingapore. Maritime trade and freedom of navigation \r\nare therefore of critical importance to our country. We \r\nalso see the United Nations Convention on the Law of \r\nthe Sea as the principal international legal instrument \r\nfor dealing with all issues relating to maritime rights \r\nand obligations. \r\n A crucial characteristic of the Convention is that \r\nit is an indivisible package and as such, it must be read \r\nas a whole and fully complied with. When the \r\nConvention was drafted, the negotiators recognized \r\nthat there were a number of very contentious issues \r\nthat could be resolved only through trade-offs and by \r\naccepting the Convention as a package. That meant that \r\nevery individual provision of the text was agreed on \r\nwithin the context of the whole. This is especially true \r\nof the new legal concepts and regimes created under \r\nthe Convention, such as exclusive economic zones, \r\narchipelagic States, transit passage and archipelagic sea \r\nlanes passage. We must, therefore, avoid emphasizing \r\nparts of the Convention that we like while ignoring \r\nparts that we do not. We should not extract paragraphs \r\nfrom the Convention out of context, or misuse certain \r\nprovisions in an attempt to justify measures that are \r\ninconsistent with the Convention. All States Parties \r\nhave a shared interest in maintaining the integrity of \r\nthe Convention. \r\n A key bargain in the Convention was balancing \r\nthe aspirations of coastal States to expand the extent of \r\ntheir territorial sea from 3 to 12 nautical miles with the \r\nright of the international community to enjoy free and \r\nuninterrupted passage through some of the world’s \r\ncritical sea lanes. Coastal States were therefore allowed \r\nto expand the extent of their territorial sea out to \r\n12 nautical miles, in exchange for accepting a special \r\nregime of passage for ships and aircraft going through \r\nand over the 116 straits used for international \r\nnavigation. This special regime, under which a ship or \r\naircraft enjoys unimpeded passage through the strait, \r\nsubject to the provisions of the Convention, is known \r\n A/64/PV.56\r\n \r\n29 09-63342 \r\n \r\nas “transit passage”. The coastal State may not \r\ninterfere with that passage, even if the sea lane is \r\nwithin its territorial sea. This critical provision ensures \r\nthe continued use of the seas and oceans to facilitate \r\nglobal trade, 85 to 90 per cent of which is seaborne. \r\n It was not easy for the drafters of the Convention \r\nto arrive at that crucial and delicate balance between \r\nthe claims of coastal States for more rights over their \r\nadjacent seas and the historic rights of user States over \r\nthose seas. It would thus be wise to maintain that \r\nbalance, as it benefits both coastal States and user \r\nStates. With the economies of the world becoming \r\nmore open and interconnected and as trade flows \r\nincrease, States that used to think in terms of protecting \r\ntheir interests as coastal States will find that they have \r\nsignificant and growing interests as user States as well. \r\nIt is, therefore, our firm belief that, within the \r\nframework of the Convention, coastal States and user \r\nStates can work hand in hand to ensure their common \r\ninterests such as safety of navigation and \r\nenvironmental protection. \r\n Singapore is pleased to note the fruitful \r\ncooperation among the littoral States of the Straits of \r\nMalacca and Singapore as well as between the littoral \r\nStates, user States and other key stakeholders in \r\nensuring the safety of navigation and environmental \r\nprotection of critical international waterways in our \r\nregion. The establishment of the Cooperative \r\nMechanism on the safety of navigation and \r\nenvironmental protection in the Straits of Malacca and \r\nSingapore in September 2007 was a landmark \r\nachievement, as it provides a platform for the littoral \r\nStates to engage user States, the shipping industry and \r\nother stakeholders in enhancing the safety of \r\nnavigation and protection of the marine environment in \r\nthe Straits. We are pleased to report that the \r\nCooperative Mechanism has made good progress in all \r\nits three pillars, namely the Cooperation Forum, the six \r\nStraits projects under the Project Coordination \r\nCommittee and the Aids to Navigation Fund, since its \r\ninception two years ago. We are encouraged by the \r\nsteady progress in the number of countries and other \r\nstakeholders contributing to the Cooperative \r\nMechanism, including Australia, China, the European \r\nCommission, Germany, Greece, India, Japan, the \r\nRepublic of Korea, the United Arab Emirates, the \r\nUnited States, the Malacca Strait Council, the Middle \r\nEast Navigation Aids Service, the Nippon Foundation \r\nand the Japanese Shipowners’ Association. \r\n More recently, Indonesia, Malaysia and \r\nSingapore concluded a Joint Technical Arrangement \r\nwith the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to \r\ninstitutionalize an IMO Fund that supports cooperation \r\namongst stakeholders aimed at enhancing safety and \r\nmaritime cooperation in the Straits of Malacca and \r\nSingapore. The Fund benefited from an initial \r\ncontribution of $1 million from Greece, as well as a \r\nfurther pledge of $100,000 from China, and marks \r\nanother major step forward in promoting and \r\nfacilitating international cooperation in this important \r\ninternational waterway. We look forward to the \r\ncontinued participation and support of all stakeholders. \r\n In the larger Asian region, Singapore is pleased to \r\nnote the continued close cooperation between littoral, \r\ncoastal and user States aimed at combating piracy. The \r\nRegional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy \r\nand Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP), \r\nwhich came into force in 2006, is the first \r\nGovernment-to-Government agreement that addresses \r\nthe incidence of piracy and armed robbery in the Asian \r\nregion. Contracting States to the Agreement share \r\ninformation on incidents of piracy and armed robbery, \r\nincluding reports on subsequent law enforcement \r\ninvestigations and their outcomes, through the \r\nReCAAP Information Sharing Centre (ReCAAP ISC), \r\nbased in Singapore. The Information Sharing Centre \r\nmakes publicly available regular updates and analyses \r\non the piracy and armed robbery situation in the Asian \r\nregion. The ReCAAP ISC is now regarded as the \r\ncrucial source of information on piracy and armed \r\nrobbery in Asia for both the media and the industry. \r\n Singapore is also heartened by the ongoing \r\ncooperation between ReCAAP ISC and IMO, where \r\nIMO has held up ReCAAP as a model of \r\nintergovernmental cooperation against piracy for other \r\nregions. Most recently, in November 2009, ReCAAP \r\nISC, in conjunction with IMO, organized a \r\nfamiliarization programme for the Djibouti Code \r\ncountries in Singapore and facilitated the participation \r\nof the same countries in a ReCAAP capacity-building \r\nworkshop in the Philippines. \r\n We are confident that the Agreement will \r\ncontinue to play an important role in promoting \r\nmaritime safety and security in our region. The \r\ncontinued decline in piracy in the Asian region is \r\ntestament to the success of the organization, together \r\nwith other regional and national initiatives in the \r\nA/64/PV.56  \r\n \r\n09-63342 30 \r\n \r\nregion to fight piracy and armed robbery, such as the \r\nMalacca Strait Patrols. \r\n As a major maritime nation, Singapore is also \r\nstrongly committed to supporting the international \r\ncounter-piracy efforts in the Gulf of Aden and off the \r\ncoast of Somalia. In addition to deploying a tank-\r\nlanding ship to the Gulf of Aden from April to July \r\n2009, Singapore will also be taking command of \r\nCombined Task Force 151 from January to March \r\n2010. The piracy situation off the Somali coast is a \r\ncomplex and multifaceted problem that is beyond the \r\nscope of any one country to resolve. It requires a \r\ncoordinated and holistic international response. \r\n Therefore, the development of international \r\ncooperation in those waters, with ships from various \r\nnations learning to self-organize into naval patrols and \r\nto communicate with one another, is a welcome  \r\n \r\ndevelopment. Such efforts, carried out in accordance \r\nwith international law, demonstrate the important roles \r\nthat user States can play to complement the efforts of \r\nthe littoral States in combating piracy and ensuring the \r\nsafety and freedom of navigation in key sea lanes used \r\nfor international shipping. \r\n Singapore fully supports the ongoing efforts by \r\nboth the United Nations and IMO to address the urgent \r\nsituation in those waters. We would also be happy to \r\nshare our experience in working with Malaysia and \r\nIndonesia, through initiatives such as the Malacca \r\nStrait Patrols, and our experience as the host of \r\nReCAAP ISC, which has contributed to successfully \r\nreducing piracy in the Straits of Malacca and \r\nSingapore. \r\n The meeting rose at 1.20 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
