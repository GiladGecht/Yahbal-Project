(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) \r\n \r\n \r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Mohamed \r\n(Maldives), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 76 (continued) \r\n \r\nOceans and the law of the sea \r\n \r\n (a) Oceans and the law of the sea \r\n \r\n  Reports of the Secretary-General (A/64/66 and \r\nA/64/66/Add.1 and Add.2) \r\n \r\n  Report on the results of the assessment of \r\nassessments (A/64/88) \r\n \r\n  Report on the work of the United Nations \r\nOpen-ended Informal Consultative Process on \r\nOceans and the Law of the Sea at its tenth \r\nmeeting (A/64/131) \r\n \r\n  Report on the work of the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup of the Whole to recommend a course of \r\naction to the General Assembly on the regular \r\nprocess for global reporting and assessment of \r\nthe state of the marine environment, including \r\nsocio-economic aspects (A/64/347)  \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/64/L.18 and Corr.1) \r\n \r\n (b) Sustainable fisheries, including through the \r\n1995 Agreement for the Implementation of the \r\nProvisions of the United Nations Convention on \r\nthe Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 \r\nrelating to the Conservation and Management \r\nof Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory \r\nFish Stocks, and related instruments \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/64/305) \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/64/L.29) \r\n \r\n Mr. Limeres (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nAllow me at the outset to congratulate and thank both \r\ncoordinators, Ms. Holly Koehler of the United States \r\nand Ambassador Henrique Valle of Brazil, for having \r\nled with remarkable professionalism the negotiations \r\non the draft resolutions before the General Assembly \r\ntoday. We also welcome the presence among us of the \r\nPresident of the International Tribunal on the Law of \r\nthe Sea, Judge José Luis Jesus, and the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the International Seabed Authority, Mr. Nii \r\nAllotey Odunton. \r\n The United Nations Convention on the Law of \r\nthe Sea is one of the clearest contributions to the \r\nstrengthening of peace, security, cooperation and \r\nfriendly relations among all nations. At the same time, \r\nit is one of the international instruments with the \r\ngreatest economic, strategic and political ramifications. \r\n The goal of the negotiators of the Convention was \r\nto settle all issues relating to the law of the sea in one \r\nsingle instrument. Its provisions, therefore, strike a \r\ndelicate balance between the rights and duties of \r\nA/64/PV.57  \r\n \r\n09-63459 2 \r\n \r\nStates. That balance took shape over nine years of \r\nnegotiation and must be preserved by all States, both \r\nindividually and as members of international \r\norganizations with competence in ocean affairs and of \r\norganizations of any kind. \r\n The time elapsed since the Convention’s adoption \r\nin 1982 has proven that it is a true “constitution of the \r\noceans”, with a clearly universal character. In that \r\nregard, we welcome its ratification by Chad, the \r\nDominican Republic and Switzerland. \r\n The Argentine delegation will, at the appropriate \r\ntime, make a statement in explanation of our position \r\non the draft resolution on sustainable fisheries \r\n(A/64/L.29) to be adopted by consensus today. \r\nNevertheless, we would like to take this opportunity to \r\nrefer to some of the issues dealt with in that draft \r\nresolution and in the draft resolution on oceans and the \r\nlaw of the sea (A/64/L.18). \r\n The question of biodiversity beyond the limits of \r\nnational jurisdiction is one of the emerging issues of \r\nthe law of the sea. In February 2010, the second next \r\nmeeting of the Ad Hoc Open-ended Informal Working \r\nGroup established by resolution 59/24 will be held. In \r\nthat regard, Argentina is concerned about certain \r\nproposals put forward during the negotiations of the \r\ndraft resolution on oceans and the law of the sea the \r\nresult of which could have overburdened the Working \r\nGroup at a time when it has not yet concluded an \r\nextremely important debate, that on the legal regime \r\napplicable, under the Convention, to genetic marine \r\nresources in areas beyond national jurisdiction.  \r\n In addition, in that connection my delegation \r\nwishes to highlight that in recent years the use of the \r\nambiguous term “areas beyond national jurisdiction” \r\nhas led to a certain level of confusion on how to deal \r\nwith the conservation and use of those resources in the \r\ntwo maritime areas beyond national jurisdiction in \r\nquestion, namely, the high seas and the Area.   \r\n We would therefore like to recall once again that \r\nthe question of the legal regime is still outstanding, as \r\nreflected in paragraph 142 of the draft resolution that \r\nwe are about to adopt (A/64/L.18). This issue should \r\nbe addressed within the context of the mandate of the \r\nWorking Group, with a view to making progress. My \r\ncountry expects that in the course of that work, \r\nMember States will take into account the fact that one \r\nof the purposes of the Convention was to develop the \r\nprinciples embodied in resolution 2749 (XXV) of 17 \r\nDecember 1970. In that resolution, the General \r\nAssembly solemnly declared, inter alia, that the area of \r\nthe seabed and ocean floor, and the subsoil thereof, \r\nbeyond the limits of national jurisdiction, as well as its \r\nresources “are the common heritage of mankind”, the \r\nexploration and exploitation of which “shall be carried \r\nout for the benefit of mankind as a whole”.  \r\n This year, at the nineteenth Meeting of States \r\nParties to the Convention, the possibility of addressing \r\na substantive issue was discussed. Regardless of the \r\nmerit of each issue, my country has consistently \r\nmaintained that the Meeting of States Parties is the \r\ncompetent forum, under article 319, in which to \r\naddress any issue relating to the interpretation and \r\napplication of the Convention. This is also consistent \r\nwith the general rule of the law of treaties, namely, that \r\nthe authentic interpreters of any treaty are its parties. \r\n My country believes that special consideration \r\nshould be given to the question of the outer limit of the \r\ncontinental shelf beyond 200 miles. Argentina made its \r\ncomplete submission to the Commission on the Limits \r\nof the Continental Shelf on 21 April 2009. On \r\n26 August, during the twenty-fourth session of the \r\nCommission, my country made its oral presentation. \r\n The Commission has received 51 submissions \r\nand more than 40 preliminary informational \r\npresentations to date. More are to come in the future. \r\nIts workload is a matter of the outmost importance, in \r\nparticular in the light of the future timeline the \r\nPresident of the Commission presented at the most \r\nrecent Meeting of States Parties. The picture he painted \r\nfor us is frustrating for most of the coastal States that \r\nhave made submissions, as we will have to wait a long \r\ntime for the Commission’s recommendations. \r\n My delegation would therefore like to highlight \r\ntwo aspects of this matter. On the one hand, it is urgent \r\nthat parties to the Convention consciously address the \r\nquestion of the Commission’s workload so that it can \r\nfulfil its duties in an expeditious, efficient and effective \r\nmanner. On the other hand, it is now more important \r\nthan ever to remind all States that the work of the \r\nCommission has to do with drawing the limit, not with \r\nthe rights of coastal States, and that article 77 \r\nparagraph 3 of the Convention provides that:  \r\n  “The rights of the coastal State over the \r\ncontinental shelf do not depend on occupation, \r\neffective or notional, or on any express \r\nproclamation.” \r\n A/64/PV.57\r\n \r\n3 09-63459 \r\n \r\nThat reminder is reflected in paragraph 40 of the draft \r\nresolution on oceans and the law of the sea \r\n(A/64/L.18). \r\n As regards the regular process for global \r\nreporting and assessment of the state of the marine \r\nenvironment, including socio-economic aspects, my \r\ncountry participated actively in the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup that considered, in August 2009, the assessment \r\nof assessments (A/64/88, annex) and made \r\nrecommendations to the General Assembly in that \r\nregard. Argentina is of the view that all of those \r\nrecommendations are pertinent and should be \r\nimplemented by the Assembly. In particular, I would \r\nlike to highlight that the follow-up to the regular \r\nprocess should be carried out by an intergovernmental \r\nforum, that equitable geographic distribution in the \r\nconstitution of the panel of experts should be respected \r\nand that capacity-building should be ensured for the \r\neffective participation of developing countries. Besides \r\nthat, the essential legal framework of the regular \r\nprocess is the Convention. With that in mind, the \r\nWorking Group also recommended that secretariat \r\nservices for the regular process be provided by the \r\nOffice for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea of the \r\nSecretariat in New York. \r\n Another aspect of the draft resolutions that we \r\nwill adopt to which my country attaches particular \r\nimportance is the United Nations Open-ended Informal \r\nConsultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the Sea \r\nestablished by resolution 54/33. Argentina supported \r\nthe review of the Process, which took place this year at \r\nits tenth meeting, in the understanding that its \r\ncontinuation depends on its being redirected back its \r\noriginal objectives, which are closely linked to \r\nsustainable development.  \r\n During the discussions at the tenth meeting, it \r\nwas clear that many delegations considered that the \r\nConsultative Process should not be a negotiating \r\nforum, but one for coordination and exchange of views, \r\nand also that the Consultative Process is not a forum \r\nfor the interpretation of the law of the sea that is \r\nalready in force. My country believes that those issues \r\nshould be duly taken into account when the General \r\nAssembly considers, at its sixty-fifth session, the \r\nrenewal of the Consultative Process. \r\n Another issue that was insistently stressed during \r\nthe review of the Consultative Process was the need to \r\nadequately incorporate the development prospective in \r\nthe consideration of every topic. Thus we welcome the \r\nfact that, on the basis of a proposal made by the Group \r\nof 77 and China, the General Assembly decided that \r\nthe next meeting of the Consultative Process will be \r\ndevoted to the topic of capacity-building in oceans and \r\nthe law of the sea, including marine science. We \r\nbelieve that the consideration of the topic should be \r\nbroad and should include the transfer of technology. \r\nThat issue, to which a whole part of the Convention — \r\nPart XIV — is devoted, is possibly the one in which \r\nthere is the greatest gap in the application of the \r\nConvention and is, at the same time, the main vehicle \r\nfor capacity-building in the field of marine sciences. \r\n As regards the draft resolution on sustainable \r\nfisheries (A/64/L.29), the first review of the \r\nimplementation of resolution 61/105 took place this \r\nyear.  \r\n Already in the sixty-fourth session, my country \r\nhas recalled that the sedentary resources of the \r\ncontinental shelf are subject to the sovereignty rights \r\nof the coastal States in the whole extension of that \r\nmaritime area. Therefore, conservation and \r\nmanagement of such resources is under the exclusive \r\nauthority of coastal States, which have the \r\nresponsibility of adopting the necessary measures \r\nregarding such resources and their associated \r\necosystems that could be affected by fishing practices \r\nthat can have a destructive impact. We also stated at \r\nthat time that Argentina was taking the necessary steps \r\nto adopt that type of measures for the conservation of \r\nsedentary resources throughout its continental shelf \r\nand called on other coastal States to exercise the same \r\nresponsibility. \r\n Without prejudice to that, Argentina considered it \r\nappropriate, at that moment, to propose the inclusion of \r\noperative paragraph 104 of resolution 63/112, in order \r\nto prevent any interpretation that could suppose \r\nignorance of the exclusiveness of the rights of the \r\ncoastal State over the areas of its continental shelf \r\nsituated beyond 200 miles. \r\n However, the report of the Secretary-General \r\n(A/64/305), in its section III.B.5, on actions taken by \r\nStates for areas where no competent regional fisheries \r\nmanagement organizations and arrangement exists, \r\nshows that in some States and in one regional \r\norganization there can be confusion as to the measures \r\nthat should be adopted with respect to high seas fishing \r\nundertaken under the responsibility of the flag State, on \r\nA/64/PV.57  \r\n \r\n09-63459 4 \r\n \r\nthe one hand, and, on the other, the measures related to \r\nconservation of resources and vulnerable marine \r\necosystems in the seabed and subsoil that are subject to \r\nthe jurisdiction of the coastal State when such seabed \r\nand subsoil are part of its continental shelf beyond 200 \r\nmiles. \r\n In that context, the Argentine delegation makes \r\nexpress reservation regarding what is expressed in \r\nparagraphs 178, 179, 180 and 181 of the report in \r\ndocument A/64/305 and expects that future \r\ncontributions of States or international organizations to \r\nthe reports of the Secretary-General regarding this \r\nissue will include all the information needed to \r\nexamine whether the activities that were undertaken \r\nare in conformity with international law in force. \r\n The application of conservation measures or the \r\ncarrying out of research recommended in the \r\nresolutions of the General Assembly, in particular \r\nresolution 61/105 and concurrent resolutions, have as \r\ntheir unavoidable legal framework the international \r\nlaw of the sea in force, as reflected in the Convention. \r\nThus it is not conceivable that implementation of such \r\nresolutions could be cited as justification for denying \r\nor ignoring the rights established in the Convention. \r\n Alert to that type of situation, the General \r\nAssembly, in paragraph 115 of its draft resolution on \r\nsustainable fisheries (A/64/L.29), would remind all \r\nStates that \r\n “nothing in the paragraphs of its resolution \r\n61/105 and the present resolution addressing the \r\nimpacts of bottom fishing on vulnerable marine \r\necosystems prejudices the sovereign rights of \r\ncoastal States over their continental shelf or the \r\nexercise of the jurisdiction of coastal States with \r\nrespect to their continental shelf under \r\ninternational law as reflected in the Convention, \r\nin particular article 77”. \r\n In the same vein, the Assembly, in paragraph 123 \r\nof the same draft resolution, when encouraging States \r\nand international regional fisheries organizations to \r\ndevelop and strengthen procedures and research \r\nprogrammes for identification of vulnerable marine \r\necosystems, assessment of impacts and assessment of \r\nfishing activities on target and non-target species, \r\nwould recall that those activities must conform to the \r\nConvention, including Part XII. Part XIII of the \r\nConvention, which contains the regime for marine \r\nscientific research, provides, in article 246, paragraph 2, \r\nthat  \r\n “(m)arine scientific research in the exclusive \r\neconomic zone and on the continental shelf shall \r\nbe conducted with the consent of the coastal \r\nState.” \r\n Also in relation to fisheries, my country wishes to \r\nhighlight its concern about an incipient trend of some \r\nStates to try to interpret passages in Assembly \r\nresolutions as providing for the possibility of regional \r\nfisheries management organizations adopting some \r\ntype of measure with respect to vessels whose flag \r\nStates neither are members of such organizations nor \r\nhave expressly consented the application of such \r\nmeasures to their vessels. My country is convinced that \r\nsuch interpretations are not in conformity with \r\ninternational law in force and that nothing in the \r\nresolutions of the General Assembly can be construed \r\nas to support such interpretations. \r\n Finally, as every year when the report of the \r\nSecretary-General on oceans and the law of the sea is \r\nconsidered, Argentina wishes to acknowledge the team \r\nin the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the \r\nSea for its professional and devoted work and for the \r\nassistance that it spontaneously provides to Member \r\nStates in the matters of its competence. \r\n Mr. Sinhaseni (Thailand): I have the honour to \r\nshare Thailand’s views on agenda item 76, on oceans \r\nand the law of the sea. \r\n Thailand shares the growing concern of the \r\ninternational community over the threat posed by \r\nillegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, \r\nparticularly to the sustainable management of fish \r\nstocks. We therefore welcome the recent adoption by \r\nthe Food and Agriculture Organization Conference of \r\nthe Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, \r\nDeter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and \r\nUnregulated Fishing. \r\n Thailand respects the right of coastal States to \r\nenact laws and regulations in exercise of their \r\nsovereign rights to explore, exploit, conserve and \r\nmanage living resources in their Exclusive Economic \r\nZones (EEZ). At the same time, measures taken by a \r\ncoastal State to ensure compliance with those laws and \r\nregulations should be proportionate to and in line with \r\nthe provisions of Article 73 of the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea, relating to \r\n A/64/PV.57\r\n \r\n5 09-63459 \r\n \r\nenforcement of laws and regulations of the coastal \r\nState, including the fundamental principle of due \r\nprocess of law. \r\n Furthermore, we attach great importance to well-\r\nestablished rules of customary international law as \r\nrecognized and codified by the Convention, namely, \r\nthe right of innocent passage in territorial seas, the \r\nright of transit passage in straits used for international \r\nnavigation, and freedom of navigation in the EEZ of \r\nanother State. Therefore we would like to reaffirm our \r\nposition as stated in the letter dated 18 February 1993 \r\nfrom the Permanent Representative of Thailand \r\naddressed to the Secretary-General as reproduced in \r\ndocument A/48/90, dated 22 February 1993. \r\n With respect to maritime safety and security, \r\nThailand has always supported international efforts and \r\ninitiatives against piracy and armed robbery, both at \r\nthe regional and international levels. In that regard, we \r\nnote with appreciation the adoption of Security Council \r\nresolution 1897 (2009) on 30 November, which \r\nconstitutes a renewed basis for international action \r\nagainst piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of \r\nSomalia, with particular attention to the investigation \r\nand prosecution process.  \r\n We note with concern that a growing number of \r\nhijacked vessels are fishing boats. Such vessels are \r\nparticularly prone to attack, since pirates perceive \r\neconomic value in them, for which the vessel owners \r\nwould be willing to pay. Accordingly, special attention \r\nshould be paid to that matter, as well as to the safety \r\nand security of the fishermen. Here, Thailand \r\ncommends the work of the International Maritime \r\nOrganization in combating piracy by adopting a \r\nnumber of documents which provide guidance to the \r\nindividuals and sectors concerned. \r\n Mr. Okuda (Japan): Let me first join other \r\ndelegates in thanking the facilitators of the two draft \r\nresolutions, Ambassador Henrique Valle of Brazil and \r\nMs. Holly Koehler of the United States, for their \r\ntremendous work. I also wish to thank all Member \r\nStates that worked together during informal \r\nconsultations on the draft resolutions in the spirit of \r\ncooperation. My appreciation also goes to the \r\nSecretariat for its assistance. \r\n Japan is pleased to sponsor draft resolution \r\nA/64/L.18, on oceans and the law of the sea. Japan is a \r\nmaritime country surrounded by sea and depends on \r\nmaritime transport for nearly all imports of energy \r\nresources, including oil and minerals. As an island \r\ncountry with few natural resources, living marine \r\nresources and other natural resources located on the \r\ncontinental shelf and the deep seabed under its \r\nsurrounding waters are crucial to Japan from an \r\neconomic perspective. Consequently, we have a strong \r\ninterest in the two agenda items and have been actively \r\ntaking part in the discussions on the draft resolutions. \r\n It is Japan’s continuing concern that acts of \r\npiracy are still a serious threat off the coast of Somalia \r\nand in the Gulf of Aden. Japan takes the view that a \r\nmultifaceted approach that includes assistance for \r\nmaritime enforcement capacity-building and other \r\nmedium- to long-term efforts in addition to operations \r\nby naval vessels must be pursued in order to effectively \r\nsuppress piracy. \r\n Japan has dispatched two destroyers and two  \r\nP-3C patrol aircraft in the Gulf of Aden and off the \r\nCoast of Somalia. In June this year Japan enacted the \r\nAnti-Piracy Measures Law, which ensures domestic \r\nimplementation of the provisions on piracy stipulated \r\nin the United Nations Convention on the Law of the \r\nSea. In addition, Japan has contributed $13.6 million to \r\nthe International Maritime Organization Djibouti Code \r\nTrust Fund in an effort to assist the development of \r\nmaritime enforcement capacity in coastal countries. \r\nThrough that contribution, we will support \r\nimplementation of the Djibouti Code of Conduct, \r\nincluding the launching of the regional centres for \r\ninformation sharing in Kenya, Tanzania and Yemen and \r\na training centre in Djibouti. \r\n Japan intends to maintain its commitment to \r\ncooperate in the activities based on the Regional \r\nCooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and \r\nArmed Robbery against Ships in Asia.  \r\n Regarding the Commission on the Limits of the \r\nContinental Shelf beyond 200 nautical miles, Japan \r\nfully recognizes the need to improve the situation \r\nconcerning the Commission’s workload, in view of the \r\nlarge number of submissions made by coastal States. \r\nJapan, as a State party to the Convention, will work \r\ntogether with other States parties in the process of the \r\nInformal Working Group on the workload of the \r\nCommission by participating actively in the efforts to \r\nfind practical and effective solutions to this issue. \r\n As regards the International Tribunal for the Law \r\nof the Sea, Japan highly appreciates the important role \r\nit has played in the peaceful settlement of disputes as \r\nA/64/PV.57  \r\n \r\n09-63459 6 \r\n \r\nwell as in the maintenance and development of the \r\nlegal order of the sea. Japan will continue to support \r\nthe Tribunal’s valuable work. \r\n Turning to the conservation of marine \r\nbiodiversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction, the \r\npromotion of global conservation of biodiversity has \r\nbecome more important than ever, as the world will \r\ncommemorate the International Year of Biodiversity in \r\n2010. Japan recognizes the challenges facing the \r\nGeneral Assembly in facilitating the protection of \r\nmarine biodiversity beyond national jurisdictions and \r\nwill continue to participate in a constructive way in the \r\nwork of the Ad Hoc Open-ended Informal Working \r\nGroup to study issues relating to the conservation and \r\nsustainable use of marine biodiversity in that area. \r\n As a responsible fishing State and a State party to \r\nthe Convention on the Law of the Sea and the 1995 \r\nFish Stocks Agreement, Japan is dedicated to \r\naddressing the promotion of sustainable use through \r\nthe conservation and management of living marine \r\nresources and appropriate conservation of the marine \r\necosystem in cooperation with the parties concerned, \r\nthrough bilateral fisheries agreements, the Food and \r\nAgriculture Organization (FAO) and regional fisheries \r\nmanagement organizations. \r\n The problems of illegal, unreported and \r\nunregulated fishing activities and over-capacity are so \r\nserious for the sustainable use of living marine \r\nresources that it is urgent to tackle those problems on a \r\nglobal scale. Regarding the discussions in FAO on the \r\nAgreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter \r\nand Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated \r\nFishing, Japan would like to express its appreciation to \r\nFAO and the relevant States for their efforts that \r\nbrought about the adoption of the draft Agreement by \r\nthe FAO Conference after only one year of negotiation. \r\n Japan continues to participate in consultations \r\nwith the States and regions concerned regarding the \r\nestablishment of an international mechanism for the \r\nmanagement of high seas fisheries in the North Pacific \r\nOcean and will take responsible actions based on this \r\nresolution. In May 2010, the Review Conference on the \r\n1995 Fish Stocks Agreement will take place, with the \r\nparticipation of all Contracting Parties to the \r\nAgreement. Japan will continue its efforts towards \r\nstrengthening the effectiveness of the Agreement in \r\ncooperation with other Contracting Parties. \r\n In concluding, Japan expresses its hope that the \r\ndraft resolutions before us, which resulted from \r\nintensive negotiations and a spirit of cooperation \r\namong Member States during the informal \r\nconsultations, will be duly adopted at this session of \r\nthe General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Sullivan (Canada): It gives me great pleasure \r\nto be here today to talk about Canada’s support for the \r\nresolutions on sustainable fisheries (A/64/L.29) and \r\noceans and the law of the sea (A/64/L.18) and to \r\ndiscuss some of the issues of importance to Canada. \r\n I should like to begin by thanking Ms. Koehler of \r\nthe United States and Ambassador Valle of Brazil, \r\ncoordinators of the sustainable fisheries and law of the \r\nsea resolutions, for having helped develop the \r\nresolutions we are considering today. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n I should like to thank the United Nations Division \r\nfor Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea for its \r\nsupport and excellent work. We also express our thanks \r\nto those delegates that ensured that the resolutions give \r\npriority to oceans and fisheries governance. \r\n In my capacity as Canada’s Ambassador for \r\nFisheries Conservation, I have the privilege of working \r\nclosely with our partners across the world towards the \r\naim of creating more sustainable fisheries and looking \r\nafter the health of ocean ecosystems. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n The resolutions on sustainable fisheries and on \r\noceans and the law of the sea are important to Canada, \r\nand we are pleased to be sponsoring them again this \r\nyear. They acknowledge both the important work the \r\ninternational community has accomplished and the \r\nchallenges that lie ahead. \r\n Today, I should like to talk about Canada’s three \r\nkey priorities for international fisheries and oceans \r\ngovernance. They include ensuring that Member States \r\nimplement their commitments, working together to \r\nidentify gaps in implementation and working \r\ncollectively to remedy those gaps. \r\n We all acknowledge the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea as the legal \r\nframework that governs all oceans activities. The \r\neffective implementation and enforcement of the \r\nConvention and other relevant instruments must guide \r\nall our actions. Canada takes this seriously. To that end, \r\n A/64/PV.57\r\n \r\n7 09-63459 \r\n \r\nas acknowledged in these resolutions, the international \r\ncommunity needs to effectively implement \r\ncommitments already made and be prepared to \r\nestablish new mechanisms where appropriate. We also \r\nneed to ensure that information and scientific \r\nknowledge are effectively shared and that the particular \r\nchallenges of developing States are considered. \r\n Over the past few years, the global community \r\nhas worked together and has achieved significant \r\nprogress in making our oceans and fisheries healthier \r\nand more sustainable. But we must continue our efforts \r\nwith added resolve as new information is developed \r\nand new approaches identified. As we strive to fulfil \r\nour obligations, it is important to recognize the \r\nchallenges we face and work together to find solutions. \r\n Canada believes that individual States and \r\nRegional Fisheries Management Organizations \r\n(RFMOs) play a critical role in implementing the \r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and \r\nthe United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement. We are \r\npleased that States, both individually and within \r\nRFMOs, have taken up the challenge to implement \r\nmodern fisheries management principles. We will \r\ncontinue to encourage the use of the best scientific \r\ninformation available in their decision-making, as \r\nRFMOs continue to reform and improve. \r\n Canada is encouraged by the actions agreed to at \r\nthe second joint meeting of tuna RFMOs for improving \r\ntheir management. We want to continue our efforts to \r\nstrengthen coordination and cooperation among all \r\ntuna RFMOs. At its recent annual meeting, the \r\nInternational Commission for the Conservation of \r\nAtlantic Tunas (ICCAT) adopted stronger measures to \r\nprotect and rebuild Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean \r\nBluefin Tuna stocks, in keeping with sound scientific \r\nadvice. Now it will be a question of effective \r\nimplementation and compliance. \r\n In the past, Canada has been disappointed that \r\nscientific advice was not followed by ICCAT members \r\nand that overfishing continued. Canada will continue to \r\npress for sustainable management of tuna and tuna-like \r\nspecies within ICCAT and other RFMOs. We want to \r\nensure that those organizations continue to move in \r\nthat positive direction. We see this as a pivotal example \r\nof management bodies playing their role — a role that \r\nneeds to be continuously assessed and improved, as \r\nwith any management process. \r\n Our efforts to close the gaps in fisheries \r\ngovernance are exemplified by the recent adoption by \r\nthe members of the Food and Agriculture Organization \r\n(FAO) of the Agreement on Port State Measures to \r\nPrevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and \r\nUnregulated (IUU) Fishing. In our view, that \r\nAgreement will be an important new tool to tackle the \r\nproblem of IUU fishing globally, and we hope for its \r\nearly entry into force. We also call on FAO members to \r\nconclude work on improving flag State performance. \r\nCanada is eager to work with our international partners \r\nto strengthen sustainable fisheries and oceans \r\nmanagement. We want to work with other countries to \r\nachieve our shared goal of reducing IUU fishing. \r\n Now that the review of the implementation of \r\nelements of resolution 61/105 has been concluded, we \r\nnote that significant progress has also been made to \r\nimplement our commitments to protect vulnerable \r\nmarine ecosystems while allowing responsible fishing \r\nto continue. We have identified gaps in some areas and \r\nrecognize that urgent action is needed where those \r\nparticular gaps exist. Canada was instrumental in \r\nproviding leadership on this issue. Further discussions \r\nof technical aspects are planned at the FAO, and a \r\nfurther review at the United Nations is slated for 2011. \r\n We believe our commitments in resolution 61/105 \r\nprovide an effective framework for management. We \r\nhope that challenges can continue to be identified and \r\naddressed in the technical discussions. \r\n An example of how we put this into practice in \r\nCanada was to work closely with our partners in the \r\nNorthwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) to \r\nensure their cooperation in managing fisheries in order \r\nto protect vulnerable marine ecosystems in the NAFO \r\nRegulatory Area.  \r\n As the Assembly knows, the United Nations Fish \r\nStocks Agreement is at the heart of modern governance \r\nof high seas fisheries. It includes precautionary and \r\necosystem approaches and gives a predominant role to \r\nRFMOs. We are pleased that, since we met last year, \r\nanother five States have become parties, namely, \r\nMozambique, Panama, Tuvalu, Indonesia and Nigeria. \r\nThe Agreement now has 77 States parties, 19 more \r\nStates parties than at the time of the Review \r\nConference in 2006. \r\n Canada looks forward to the resumption of the \r\nReview Conference in May 2010. At the Conference, \r\nparticipants will examine the effectiveness of the \r\nA/64/PV.57  \r\n \r\n09-63459 8 \r\n \r\nAgreement and seek new ways to strengthen its \r\nimplementation. They will also review the progress \r\nmade on the recommendations made at the 2006 \r\nReview Conference. \r\n Around the world, scientists are making great \r\nstrides to help us understand our ocean environment. \r\nSound science must underpin all of our decision-\r\nmaking, from our fisheries decisions to ocean \r\nmanagement. Science-based decision-making will not \r\nonly enhance our understanding of complex ocean \r\nprocesses, but will also allow us to build a better \r\npicture of the state of our oceans. That is why we must \r\ncontinue our work to develop a global mechanism, a \r\nregular process, to deliver science-based information to \r\nthe public and key decision makers. \r\n Turning to the law of the sea, we note the current \r\nefforts of coastal States, including Canada, to delineate \r\ntheir continental shelves. Canada is concerned that the \r\ndemands now placed on the Commission on the Limits \r\nof the Continental Shelf will result in lengthy delays \r\nbetween the filing of a submission and its \r\nconsideration by the Commission. We share the \r\nconcern of other States Parties that something must be \r\ndone to ensure that the Commission can continue to \r\nperform its work effectively. Achieving this will likely \r\nmean difficult choices and testing new ideas. \r\n With respect to piracy, Canada has demonstrated \r\nits commitment to international efforts to combat \r\npiracy off the coast of East Africa. We have sent \r\nCanadian warships to the region three times to take \r\npart in counter-piracy missions and to escort ships \r\ncarrying humanitarian assistance to Somalia. Canada \r\nviews the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of \r\nSomalia as the primary mechanism for the coordination \r\nof counter-piracy activities. In that respect, we must be \r\ncareful not to propose projects or initiatives that would \r\nduplicate work already being conducted by the Contact \r\nGroup or in other forums. Canada strongly supports \r\ninternational efforts to find long-lasting solutions to \r\nthis issue. \r\n Regarding the Informal Consultative Process, \r\nCanada was pleased with the open and frank \r\ndiscussions held this year. The Process provides a \r\nvaluable platform for debate among experts, \r\npractitioners, decision makers and other stakeholders. \r\nWe feel that that dialogue should continue. We look \r\nforward to our discussions next year on capacity-\r\nbuilding in ocean affairs and the law of the sea, \r\nincluding marine science. \r\n On the world stage, Canada is demonstrating \r\nleadership in the areas of ocean conservation, \r\nprotection and sustainability, domestically and \r\ninternationally. We are influencing international \r\npriorities, decisions and processes. But no State can \r\nwork in isolation when it comes to our oceans. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n We are encouraged by the recent progress made \r\nto improve fisheries and ocean governance — whether \r\nthrough adopting the Agreement on Port State \r\nMeasures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, \r\nUnreported and Unregulated Fishing, the work done to \r\nimplement General Assembly resolution 61/105, or \r\nrecent efforts to establish the regular process on the \r\nassessment of the state of the marine environment. We \r\nmust now build on this momentum and focus on the \r\nchallenges ahead. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n We must seize this opportunity to turn our words \r\ninto concrete action — to protect our oceans and \r\nmarine environments for future generations. It is our \r\nglobal responsibility. \r\n Mr. Liu Zhenmin (China) (spoke in Chinese): \r\nWith the advance of science and technology and the \r\ndeepening of mankind’s knowledge of the oceans, the \r\ninteraction between mankind and the oceans has \r\nincreased both in scope and in depth. Over the past \r\nseveral years, we have consistently advocated \r\nestablishing and maintaining a harmonious marine \r\norder through action by the international community, \r\nwith the aim of promoting sustainable, long-term \r\ndevelopment of the oceans. \r\n In support of the importance of a harmonious \r\nmarine order, the Chinese delegation has taken an \r\nactive part in this year’s informal consultations on the \r\ndraft resolution under this item (A/64/L.18 and Corr.1). \r\nHere I would like to express my sincere gratitude to \r\nAmbassador Valle of Brazil and Ms. Holly Koehler of \r\nthe United States for their contribution as coordinators \r\nin this area. \r\n The Chinese delegation has noted the hard work \r\nof the members of the Commission on the Limits of the \r\nContinental Shelf. Since the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) took \r\n A/64/PV.57\r\n \r\n9 09-63459 \r\n \r\neffect, the work of the Commission has attracted \r\nincreasing attention from the international community. \r\nTo date, the Commission has received 51 submissions \r\nand 44 preliminary information submissions. It has \r\nbeen the consistent view of the Chinese Government \r\nthat the division of rights and interests in ocean areas \r\nwithin and beyond national jurisdictions should be \r\ncarried out in a scientific and reasonable manner, so as \r\nto enable coastal States, on the one hand, to fully \r\nexercise their sovereign rights and jurisdiction over \r\ncontinental shelves that constitute the natural \r\nprolongation of their land territories, and, on the other \r\nhand, to prevent the international seabed, which is the \r\ncommon heritage of mankind, from possible \r\nencroachment. \r\n The Commission should fulfil its responsibilities \r\nin an impartial manner and abide strictly by the \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea as a whole, so as to \r\nensure that its work is consistent with the letter and \r\nspirit of the Convention and can stand the tests of \r\nscience, law and time. My Government believes that \r\nthe consideration by the Commission of submissions in \r\naccordance with article 76 and Annex II of the \r\nConvention should not prejudice the application by \r\nStates of other parts of the Convention. We note that \r\nthe draft resolution also confirms this point. \r\n The work of the Commission and its results bear \r\non the implementation of the Convention as an \r\nintegrated whole, and thus deserve the serious attention \r\nof States and the relevant international organizations. \r\nAt the same time, the international community should \r\nalso focus on the difficulties that complex legal issues \r\ncreate for the work of the Commission, in order to \r\nexplore ways to solve such issues. The Chinese \r\nGovernment will, as always, support the work of the \r\nCommission. \r\n The Chinese delegation congratulates the \r\nInternational Seabed Authority on its achievements \r\nover the past year. Substantive progress has been made \r\nin formulating regulations on prospecting and \r\nexploration for polymetallic sulphides and cobalt-rich \r\ncrust. Although the knowledge of the international \r\ncommunity about such new seabed resources is still \r\nvery limited, the finalization of relevant regulations \r\nwill definitely be helpful in building a framework for \r\nthe development and utilization of new resources, \r\nfacilitating the dynamic work of the Authority and \r\npromoting effective management by the international \r\ncommunity of the seabed area and its resources, as well \r\nas ensuring that all countries, including developing \r\ncountries, can share in the results derived from them. \r\nWe hope that all parties will work actively to seek \r\nsolutions to outstanding issues and move for the \r\nadoption of the regulation on polymetallic sulphides at \r\nthe Authority’s sixteenth session. \r\n The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea \r\nis one of the judicial organs that, in accordance with \r\nthe Convention, can be used to solve disputes \r\nconcerning interpretation and application of the \r\nConvention. My Government has always valued and \r\nsupported the important role of the Tribunal in the \r\npeaceful settlement of maritime disputes and the \r\nmaintenance of international marine order. \r\n As a responsible fishing country, China has made \r\nits contribution to sustainable fisheries development by \r\ncommitting to strengthening conservation and \r\nmanagement measures, as well as by participating \r\nactively in the work of regional fisheries management \r\norganizations. I wish to reiterate here that the aim of \r\ninternational fisheries management should be to \r\nregulate fishing activities in order to achieve rational \r\nand sustainable utilization of fisheries resources, and at \r\nthe same time to maintain a marine ecological balance \r\nand ensure the equitable distribution of fisheries \r\nresources among all countries. \r\n The Chinese Government pays great attention to \r\ngreenhouse gas emissions from vessels and has noted \r\nthe work of the International Maritime Organization in \r\nthat regard. We believe that the key to addressing that \r\nissue lies in upholding the principle of common but \r\ndifferentiated responsibilities, enshrined in the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, \r\nand that emphasis should be put on increasing the \r\nenergy efficiency of ships and vessels by using \r\nadvanced technology. \r\n Safeguarding maritime security and freedom of \r\nnavigation is in the common interests of the \r\ninternational community and is given importance in the \r\nConvention. At present, rampant piracy in some areas \r\nhas threatened daily maritime trade and the safety and \r\nsecurity of ships and sailors. Together with other \r\ncountries, China has taken vigorous measures to \r\naddress such threats. In our view, effectively \r\ncombating piracy calls for action to address both the \r\nsymptoms and the root causes. While the international \r\ncommunity needs to take concerted actions, greater \r\nattention should be paid to enhancing the capacity-\r\nA/64/PV.57  \r\n \r\n09-63459 10 \r\n \r\nbuilding of coastal States so as to help them to \r\neliminate the economic, social and other problems that \r\ngive rise to piracy.  \r\n In addition, the international community should \r\nrespect the sovereignty of coastal States and the \r\nconcerns of States in the region. China will continue to \r\ncooperate fully with the international community, \r\nincluding coastal States, in a joint response to the \r\nthreat of piracy. We will actively participate in \r\ninternational actions in that regard and make our \r\ncontribution to the peace, security and stability of the \r\noceans. \r\n Ocean affairs are sensitive and complex. The \r\nissues of the oceans are closely interrelated. Only \r\nthrough increased coordination and cooperation among \r\nStates and international organizations will it be \r\npossible to effectively protect the integrity of the \r\nConvention, strike a reasonable balance among the \r\ninterests of all parties and meet the various challenges \r\nin utilizing and protecting the oceans. We are pleased \r\nto note that the draft resolution has explicitly called for \r\nimproved coordination and cooperation among States \r\nand international organizations. \r\n Developing human society has always been \r\nclosely related to the oceans. In a twenty-first century \r\ncharacterized by the pursuit of cooperation, win-win \r\nresults and common development, the oceans represent \r\na source of strength and hope for human development \r\nand progress. We call on the international community \r\nto make common efforts to build a harmonious marine \r\norder so that we can continue sustainable ocean \r\ndevelopment and mankind can benefit from oceans \r\nforever. \r\n Mr. Kuzmin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): At the outset, I would like to express \r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for submitting \r\nthe reports on ocean affairs to the General Assembly.  \r\n The Russian delegation advocates preserving the \r\nintegrity and comprehensively strengthening the \r\nprovisions of the United Nations Convention on the \r\nLaw of the Sea of 1982, which should be implemented \r\nin the appropriate manner. The activities of States on \r\nthe world’s oceans should be carried out in strict \r\ncompliance with the norms of the Convention. In \r\nparticular, that applies to the freedom of the high seas, \r\nthe right of States to transit passage through straits \r\nused for international navigation, the right of innocent \r\narchipelagic passage, the right of fishing on the high \r\nseas and other no less important provisions of the \r\nConvention. We call on the States that have not yet \r\ndone so to become parties to the Convention.  \r\n The Russian Federation positively views the work \r\nof the bodies established in accordance with the 1982 \r\nConvention: the International Tribunal for the Law of \r\nthe Sea, the International Seabed Authority and the \r\nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf. We \r\nnote the importance of making fuller use of their \r\npotential. \r\n We would like to note in particular the role of the \r\nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf. We \r\nemphasize the importance of full compliance by \r\ncoastal States with the requirements of article 76 of the \r\nConvention, as well as with other relevant norms of \r\ninternational law, when making their submissions \r\nrelated to delineating the outer limits of the continental \r\nshelf beyond 200 nautical miles to the Commission. \r\nThe Commission should strive for full and \r\nnon-discriminatory compliance with the requirements \r\nof the Convention when considering those submissions. \r\n The Commission, being a body comprised of \r\nexperts in geology, geophysics and hydrography, does \r\nnot have the authority to resolve the complex legal \r\nissues that it sometimes faces in the course of its work. \r\nThat problem requires reflection and an appropriate \r\nsolution. The Russian Federation recalls its proposal \r\nthat the Commission submit a list of such legal issues \r\nto the States Parties to the Convention. \r\n Another challenge is the significant increase in \r\nthe Commission’s workload. We support efforts to \r\nidentify measures to optimize its work that would be \r\nfeasible in practice and realistic and would not require \r\nchanges to the Convention. We also call for more \r\nactive cooperation between the Commission and States \r\nthat have made submissions to establish the outer \r\nlimits of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical \r\nmiles. \r\n The Russian Federation attributes to the General \r\nAssembly and the Meeting of States Parties to the \r\nConvention a central role in discussing ocean affairs \r\nwithin the United Nations. One clear example of \r\nsuccessful work by the General Assembly in that area \r\nis its contribution to the consideration of the problem \r\nof piracy. We support further strengthening the role of \r\nthe United Nations in that area. \r\n A/64/PV.57\r\n \r\n11 09-63459 \r\n \r\n We believe that the discussion that took place at \r\nthe tenth meeting of the United Nations Open-ended \r\nInformal Consultative Process on Oceans and the Law \r\nof the Sea was valuable, including the consideration of \r\nimproving working methods and enhancing \r\ncoordination of activity among the various \r\ninternational bodies dealing with ocean issues. That \r\nreaffirmed once again the paramount importance of \r\nthat forum and its valuable practical contribution to a \r\ndeeper understanding of issues related to the world’s \r\noceans. We continue to believe that the Informal \r\nConsultative Process is a useful format for discussing \r\nocean issues, including in relation to the issue of \r\nsustainable development. We believe that the practice \r\nof holding informal consultative processes regularly \r\nshould continue. \r\n With respect to marine biodiversity in areas \r\nbeyond national jurisdictions, we note that the regime \r\ngoverning the Area’s deep sea resources, provided for \r\nin the Convention, applies to the solid, liquid and gas \r\nmineral resources, including polymetallic nodules, in \r\nthe Area, on the seabed or within its subsoil, as set out \r\nin the Convention. It does not apply to living \r\nresources. In that connection, we consider it \r\nunnecessary for the International Seabed Authority to \r\ntake on additional functions to protect biological \r\nresources.  \r\n The Russian Federation has always held the \r\nposition that it is not advisable to introduce excessive \r\nlimitations on fishing on the high seas. The basic \r\nmechanisms in that area should, in our view, be \r\nestablished by relevant regional fisheries management \r\norganizations, based on comprehensive scientific data, \r\nincluding the results of both current and past scientific \r\nmarine research. \r\n We consider useful the discussion that took place \r\non progress in implementing the provisions of \r\nresolution 61/105 with respect to bottom fishing. The \r\nRussian Federation takes an active part in developing \r\nmeasures to protect vulnerable marine ecosystems, in \r\naccordance with the provisions of that resolution and \r\nthe international recommendations of the Food and \r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations and in \r\nthe context of the relevant regional fisheries \r\nmanagement organizations, such as the International \r\nCouncil for the Exploration of the Sea, the Northwest \r\nAtlantic Fisheries Organization, the North-East \r\nAtlantic Fisheries Commission and the Commission for \r\nthe Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living \r\nResources, inter alia. \r\n We are paying particular attention to this issue as \r\nthe process of developing new international \r\nconventions on fishing in the southern and northern \r\nparts of the Pacific Ocean proceeds. We support the \r\ndevelopment of effective measures for combating \r\nillegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. These \r\nmeasures should be adopted on a strong legal basis, \r\ntaking into account the views of all concerned parties. \r\nThey should not be discriminatory or protectionist.  \r\n We once again draw attention to the exclusive \r\nimportance of the Agreement for the Implementation of \r\nthe Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the \r\nLaw of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the \r\nConservation and Management of Straddling Fish \r\nStocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks and we call \r\non States that have not yet done so to consider the \r\npossibility of acceding to the Agreement. \r\n The Russian Federation supports the draft \r\nresolutions on oceans affairs that have been prepared \r\nfor approval at the sixty-fourth session of the General \r\nAssembly (A/64/L.18 and Corr.1, A/64/L.29). Many of \r\ntheir provisions are the result of difficult compromises. \r\n However, we would like to note that we have a \r\nfew criticisms to make: we, like many other \r\ndelegations, have several times expressed concern \r\nabout the steady extension of the scope of and the \r\nincrease in the number of themes covered by the \r\nresolutions on ocean affairs and the law of the sea. One \r\nof the negative consequences of this trend is that the \r\nnegotiation of resolutions has become a long and tense \r\nprocess. In our view, the time has come to think about \r\nwhat can be done to improve the situation in this area.  \r\n In conclusion, we express appreciation to the \r\ncoordinators of the informal consultations in the \r\npreparation of the draft resolutions on sustainable \r\nfishing (A/64/L.29) and the law of the sea (A/64/L.18 \r\nand Corr.1), Ms. Holly Koehler and Ambassador \r\nHenrique Rodrigues Valle, as well as the Director of \r\nthe Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea, \r\nMr. Sergei Tarassenko, and his staff for the their highly \r\nskilled assistance in the work on these drafts. \r\n Mr. Sergeyev (Ukraine): At the outset, I would \r\nlike to thank the Secretary-General and the Secretariat, \r\nin particular the Division for Ocean Affairs and the \r\nLaw of the Sea for their comprehensive reports on \r\nA/64/PV.57  \r\n \r\n09-63459 12 \r\n \r\noceans and the law of the sea. I also wish to express \r\ngratitude to the coordinators of the draft resolutions on \r\nthe law of the sea and sustainable fisheries, \r\nAmbassador Henrique Valle of Brazil and Ms. Holly \r\nKoehler of the United States of America. Fully aligning \r\nitself with the statement of the European Union, my \r\ndelegation, in its national capacity, would nevertheless \r\nlike to touch upon some issues. \r\n Ukraine has the honour to be a sponsor of both \r\nannual General Assembly resolutions. We reaffirm our \r\ncommitment to due implementation and strict \r\ncompliance with the 1982 United Nations Convention \r\non the Law of the Sea. Given its comprehensive role in \r\nthe legal regime of the world’s oceans, universal \r\nacceptance of the Convention and of all related \r\nagreements is highly important. \r\n We believe that the ability of international \r\ncommunity to effectively address the manifold \r\nchallenges it faces in ocean affairs is substantially \r\nenhanced when international and regional cooperation \r\narrangements are in place. One such challenge relates \r\nto piracy and armed robbery at sea. \r\n Ukraine welcomes actions taken by the Security \r\nCouncil to date in order to combat piracy, including \r\nadoption of resolutions 1846 (2008) and 1897 (2009), \r\nwhich my country had the honour of co-sponsoring. \r\n We also commend the activity of the Contact \r\nGroup on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia, as well as \r\nthe valuable efforts undertaken by individual States \r\nMembers of the United Nations aimed at suppressing \r\npiracy and armed robbery against ships off that \r\ncountry’s coast by conducting maritime military \r\noperations. Ukraine acknowledges that those measures \r\nhave greatly contributed to reducing the number of \r\nsuccessful hijackings in the region. \r\n We appreciate the significant decrease in the \r\nnumber of attacks by pirates and armed robbers in the \r\nAsian region today and emphasize that that success has \r\nemanated from national and multilateral initiatives as \r\nwell as regional mechanisms of cooperation in \r\ncombating and preventing piracy and armed robbery at \r\nsea. \r\n Similarly, Ukraine welcomes the work of the \r\nInternational Maritime Organization (IMO) and other \r\ninternational organizations engaged in combating such \r\nillicit acts and ensuring safety at sea. Still, much \r\nremains to be done in this area, and Ukraine knows it \r\nfrom its own sad experience. That is why we urge \r\nrelevant organizations and States to continue to give \r\npriority to this issue in order to enhance the safety of \r\nseafarers and of trade in general in affected areas.  \r\n In this respect, we call upon States that have not \r\nyet done so to become parties to the Convention for the \r\nSuppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of \r\nMaritime Navigation and its Protocol, as well as the \r\nConvention against Organized Transnational Crime and \r\nits Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by \r\nLand, Sea and Air. \r\n There is also a crucial need to promote the \r\ndevelopment of effective national criminal justice \r\nsystems that are able to ensure that any person \r\ninvolved in the financing, planning, preparation or \r\nperpetration of acts of piracy or in support of such acts \r\nis brought to justice. It is clear that acts of piracy \r\nshould be treated as serious criminal offences in \r\ndomestic legislation and State regulations. However, \r\nwhile we cannot deny that the elimination of the roots \r\nof piracy on land and the suppression of its \r\nmanifestations at sea are important, we still strongly \r\nbelieve that the efforts of the international community \r\nin this field should also include addressing the impacts \r\nof piracy, especially with respect to its victims. \r\n Ranking fifth on the list of countries with the \r\nmost citizens working in the international maritime \r\nfleet, Ukraine is among the States most affected by the \r\nramifications of piracy. As this meeting is unfolding, \r\nSomali pirates continue to hold 24 Ukrainians hostage — \r\nthe crew of the Ariana, a vessel captured on 2 May this \r\nyear. Over all, in the last 5 years, 15 vessels with \r\nUkrainians on board have been held hostage by pirates. \r\nIndeed, Somali pirates have captured 67 Ukrainians, \r\none of whom was shot dead and one seriously injured. \r\n In this dismal context, we regret to report one of \r\nthe most recent cases of pirate attacks, one which led \r\nto the death of another Ukrainian seafarer. On \r\n24 November, pirates attacked the Monrovia-flagged \r\noil tanker Cancale Star 18 nautical miles off the Benin \r\ncoast, killing a Ukrainian seaman. Four other crew \r\nmembers were wounded. This fact confirms once again \r\nthat the geography of piracy has expanded alarmingly. \r\n We believe that effective anti-piracy measures \r\nand the protection of human rights are not conflicting \r\ngoals, but complementary and mutually reinforcing. \r\nProtecting the rights of victims of piracy attacks should \r\n A/64/PV.57\r\n \r\n13 09-63459 \r\n \r\nbe a matter of the utmost concern for States and \r\ninternational institutions. \r\n Fully convinced of that, Ukraine took the \r\ninitiative to press for inclusion in the draft resolution \r\non oceans and the law of the sea (A/64/L.18 and \r\nCorr.1) of a provision that invites States and \r\ninternational organizations, namely, the International \r\nMaritime Organization and the International Labour \r\nOrganization (ILO), to consider possible solutions for \r\nseafarers and fishermen who are victims of piracy. \r\n We would like to express our sincere gratitude to \r\nthe delegations involved in drafting that proposal. We \r\nare looking forward to practical implementation of that \r\ninitiative in the framework of the IMO and the ILO, as \r\nwell as on the national level. In our view, possible \r\nsolutions for the victims of pirate attacks and their \r\nfamilies could include such short-term and long-term \r\nmeasures as adequate compensation, rehabilitation for \r\nsurvivors of attacks and the comprehensive review of \r\nstandards, including those related to the rights, \r\nlivelihoods and social security of maritime workers.  \r\n Strongly convinced of the necessity to strengthen \r\nthe role of the United Nations in countering and \r\npreventing piracy, Ukraine convened an interactive \r\ndiscussion on 1 December 2009 on strengthening the \r\ncontribution of the United Nations to countering \r\nmaritime piracy, in connection with General Assembly \r\nagenda item 76 (a) entitled Oceans and the law of the \r\nsea. That event brought together the delegations of the \r\nmore than 30 Member States and regional \r\norganizations that play a key role in international \r\nanti-piracy efforts, as well as senior representatives and \r\nexperts of the organizations of the United Nations \r\nfamily, the United Nations Secretariat and \r\nnon-governmental organizations dealing with this \r\nchallenge. \r\n The issue of protecting seafarers before, during \r\nand after pirate attacks was high on the agenda of the \r\nmeeting, probably for the first time within these walls. \r\nFurthermore, one of the conclusions of the discussion \r\nwas that the General Assembly does have a role to play \r\nin dealing with piracy. In our view, one of its areas of \r\ninvolvement could be promoting the protection of and \r\ncompensation for seafarers and fishers who are \r\nsurvivors of pirate attacks. We look forward to \r\nconcrete follow-up to this idea in the General \r\nAssembly. It should not be allowed to go unnoticed \r\nwhile piracy continues taking a human toll. \r\n The interactive discussion of 1 December proved \r\nto be a useful exercise and merited, in the view of its \r\nparticipants, a relevant follow-up. Given the scope and \r\nmagnitude of the piracy problem, it was suggested that \r\nthe General Assembly hold a thematic, expert and \r\nresult-oriented debate on the topic. I invite all \r\ndelegations to carefully consider this idea. \r\n Piracy on the high seas cannot be fought by any \r\none country alone. Universal cooperation is urgently \r\nneeded to tackle it effectively. Ukraine stands ready to \r\ndo its part. \r\n Mr. Shin Boonam (Republic of Korea): First of \r\nall, my delegation thanks the Secretary-General for his \r\ncomprehensive report on oceans and the law of the sea \r\n(A/64/66 and Add.1 and Add.2). We also commend \r\nMr. Serguei Tarassenko, Director of the Division for \r\nOcean Affairs and the Law of the Sea, and his staff for \r\ntheir dedicated work and invaluable assistance to \r\nMember States. In addition, we would like to thank \r\nAmbassador Henrique Valle of Brazil and Ms. Holly \r\nKoehler of the United States for their excellent work in \r\ncoordinating the two draft resolutions before us. \r\n This year marks the fifteenth anniversary of the \r\nentry into force of the United Nations Convention on \r\nthe Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). We extend our heartfelt \r\nappreciation to those who have endeavoured to realize \r\nthe ideals of UNCLOS over the past 15 years. Given \r\nthe centrality of UNCLOS as the global legal \r\nframework for the governance of the oceans and seas, \r\nit is important that all activities in the oceans and seas \r\nbe carried out within that framework and that the \r\nintegrity of the Convention be maintained. \r\n The implementing mechanisms of the Convention — \r\nthe International Seabed Authority, the International \r\nTribunal for the Law of the Sea and the Commission on \r\nthe Limits of the Continental Shelf — have all played \r\nimportant roles. The concerted efforts and \r\ncontributions of Member States are required to address \r\nthe difficulties that these implementing bodies might \r\nencounter in carrying out their work. The Republic of \r\nKorea has been actively participating in their work and \r\nwill do its utmost to continue contributing to these \r\nentities. \r\n We cannot adequately stress the importance of the \r\noceans and seas as a source of marine living and \r\nnon-living resources and a vital avenue for \r\ntransportation. However, it is regrettable to witness the \r\nongoing prevalence of piracy and the degradation of \r\nA/64/PV.57  \r\n \r\n09-63459 14 \r\n \r\nmarine resources. Collaborative efforts at subregional, \r\nregional and international levels are necessary to \r\nadequately address those problems. In this regard, the \r\nGovernment of the Republic of Korea hosted the Seoul \r\nHigh-Level Meeting on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia \r\nin June.  \r\n More attention must be focused on the oceans and \r\nseas as invaluable assets for the welfare of humanity. \r\nThe Republic of Korea is pleased to note that the tenth \r\nmeeting of the United Nations Open-ended Informal \r\nConsultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the Sea \r\nthis year was timely in reviewing the achievements and \r\nshortcomings of its first nine meetings. \r\n Marine science and technology are pivotal to the \r\nfulfilment of our common objectives in all aspects of \r\nthe oceans and seas. A variety of cooperative scientific \r\nand technical endeavours in ocean affairs, a healthy \r\nexchange of information and the design of joint \r\nresearch activities are needed to achieve the \r\nconservation and sustainable development of marine \r\nresources. The Republic of Korea is doing its part to \r\nenhance international cooperation by transferring \r\nmarine technology to developing countries through the \r\nKorea International Cooperation Agency’s funding and \r\ninternship programmes. \r\n According to the report of the Secretary-General, \r\nresearch continues to show that marine life and \r\nbiodiversity are important for maintaining a healthy \r\nglobal ecosystem and climate and for sustaining \r\nsocio-economic development. The Republic of Korea \r\nalso attaches great importance to the conservation and \r\nsustainability of marine biodiversity. We are pleased to \r\nnote that in the coming year the international \r\ncommunity will have a valuable opportunity to \r\ncontemplate the importance of marine biodiversity as \r\nthe General Assembly, in resolution 61/203, declared \r\n2010 the International Year of Biodiversity. \r\n As a responsible fishing State and a State party to \r\nUNCLOS, the Republic of Korea is deeply concerned \r\nabout illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) \r\nfishing. Preventing, deterring and eliminating IUU \r\nfishing activities is essential to achieving the \r\nconservation, management and sustainable use of \r\nmarine living resources. Our Government has put in \r\nplace a framework to prevent the operation of \r\nsub-standard vessels and to exercise effective control \r\nover vessels flying its flag in order to prevent and deter \r\nthem from engaging in IUU fishing. The Republic of \r\nKorea will also continue to work with other States \r\nparties to take effective measures in combating IUU \r\nfishing activities. \r\n Mrs. Gallardo Hernández (El Salvador), \r\nVice-President,  took the Chair. \r\n In conclusion, we reiterate the willingness of our \r\nGovernment to extend its full cooperation for the \r\neffective implementation of the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea. We also wish to \r\nassure the Assembly of our Government’s commitment \r\nto the promotion of an orderly and stable oceans \r\nregime in the spirit of mutual understanding and \r\ncooperation enshrined in the Convention. \r\n Ms. Rovirosa (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nMexico wishes to thank the coordinators of draft \r\nresolutions A/64/L.18 and A/64/L.29, Ambassador \r\nHenrique Valle of Brazil and Ms. Holly Koehler of the \r\nUnited States, respectively, for their work during the \r\ncurrent session. We would also like to thank the \r\nDivision for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea for \r\npreparing the meetings and reports throughout the year. \r\n The reports of the Secretary-General identify \r\ncertain advances that have been made in protecting the \r\nmarine environment as well as the ongoing signs of its \r\ndeterioration. Mexico therefore appeals to all States to \r\nredouble their efforts to comply with their \r\ncommitments under the international maritime law \r\nregime. \r\n Through cooperation and coordination at all \r\nlevels, the establishment of interdisciplinary \r\napproaches to ocean policy and the recognition of the \r\njudicial bodies competent to resolve disputes, we can \r\nguarantee the efficiency of the tools at the disposal of \r\nthe international community, particularly the 1982 \r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. \r\n I should like to comment on some aspects of draft \r\nresolution A/64/L.18, “Oceans and the law of the sea”. \r\nWith regard to the work of the Commission on the \r\nLimits of the Continental Shelf, designing and \r\nimplementing concrete measures to allow the \r\nCommission to better address its heavy workload is a \r\nmatter of urgency. With the adoption of this draft \r\nresolution, the General Assembly will have made a first \r\nstep to that end, but it will be the informal working \r\ngroup established by the Meeting of States Parties to \r\nthe Convention that will provide substantive and long-\r\nterm solutions to this issue. \r\n A/64/PV.57\r\n \r\n15 09-63459 \r\n \r\n On the subject of climate change, we must \r\nacknowledge that this phenomenon affects the vast \r\nmajority of human activities and our environment. \r\nMexico therefore considers of particular importance \r\nthe paragraphs in draft resolution A/64/L.18 on ocean \r\nacidification, as well as the call for increased scientific \r\nresearch to achieve a better understanding of the \r\neffects of climate change on the marine environment \r\nand marine biodiversity. \r\n Regarding marine biodiversity beyond areas of \r\nnational jurisdiction, we welcome the course of action \r\ndrafted by the Ad Hoc Open-ended Informal Working \r\nGroup. We hope that, at its next meeting in February \r\n2010, it will make specific recommendations to the \r\nGeneral Assembly that will allow it in future to better \r\nframe the subject of the conservation and sustainable \r\nuse of marine biodiversity beyond areas of national \r\njurisdiction. \r\n As for the Open-ended Informal Consultative \r\nProcess on Oceans and the Law of the Sea, we hope \r\nthat the eleventh meeting will allow us to strengthen \r\nand make it more effective following the \r\ncomprehensive review undertaken this year. We also \r\nwelcome the fact that the discussions of the next \r\nmeeting will focus on capacity-building in ocean \r\naffairs and law of the sea, including marine science. \r\nThis issue is of special interest and relevance to \r\ndeveloping countries. \r\n With regard to the “assessment of assessments”, \r\nmy delegation welcomes the fact that the General \r\nAssembly endorses the recommendations of the Ad \r\nHoc Working Group of the Whole at its last meeting in \r\nSeptember, especially those regarding the \r\nestablishment of a framework for the Regular Process \r\nbeginning with the sixty-fifth session of the Assembly. \r\n Moving on to draft resolution A/64/L.29, we wish \r\nto highlight the following aspects. \r\n Mexico is fully committed to sustainable fisheries \r\nand is in compliance with all the substantive provisions \r\nof the 1995 Agreement. This issue is of great \r\nimportance to my country, and we therefore participate \r\nin the search for mechanisms aimed at achieving \r\nuniversal participation. One such mechanism is \r\ngenuine dialogue that takes into consideration the \r\nconcerns of States that are not parties to the \r\nAgreement, as recognized by the 2006 Review \r\nConference. Mexico hopes that such dialogue, in \r\naddition to promoting wider ratification of the \r\nAgreement, will serve to promote cooperation in \r\nimplementing conservation and management measures \r\nat the national level that will in turn ensure the \r\nconservation and sustainable use of straddling and \r\nhighly migratory fish stocks. We will give special \r\nattention to the two events to be held next year in New \r\nYork, in particular the Review Conference. \r\n Furthermore, we would like to reiterate that \r\nresponsible international trade is an essential factor in \r\nensuring that fishing contributes to sustainable \r\ndevelopment. A key mechanism for guaranteeing this is \r\nthe use of certification and ecolabelling plans, provided \r\nthat they are consistent with international law. \r\nEffective market access must be managed in a \r\nnon-discriminatory manner, without unnecessary \r\nbarriers or trade distortions, and must adhere to the \r\nprinciples of the Code of Conduct for Responsible \r\nFisheries. \r\n As regards the effects of fishing on vulnerable \r\nmarine ecosystems, Mexico recognizes the need to \r\ncontinue implementing the measures agreed to in 2006 \r\nin order to address this issue effectively, particularly \r\nwith regard to deep-sea fishing. The application of the \r\nprecautionary approach is aimed at avoiding \r\nirreversible damage to ecosystems and preventing \r\nlosses that may require long-term and difficult \r\nrecovery efforts, and must therefore be applied to deep-\r\nsea fishing. The fact that technological developments \r\nnow allow for the exploitation of seabed resources by \r\nother, less destructive methods, should also be taken \r\ninto consideration. \r\n For these reasons, we call for the series of \r\nmeasures proposed in the draft resolution to be \r\nimplemented on a priority basis and in the manner \r\nestablished therein, in recognition of the special \r\ncircumstances and challenges that developing States \r\nface in this connection. \r\n Concerning illegal fishing and its possible \r\nconnections to transnational organized crime, as \r\nreflected in paragraph 61 of the draft resolution, the \r\nAssembly has proposed a cautious approach. In our \r\nview, such a connection can be made only once States \r\nhave launched a serious dialogue on the subject, using \r\nas reference points solid and comprehensive studies \r\nthat facilitate an understanding of the issues. It is also \r\nessential to bear in mind the variety of legal regimes \r\napplicable to both activities, in accordance with \r\ninternational law. This is a subject on which we must \r\nA/64/PV.57  \r\n \r\n09-63459 16 \r\n \r\nmove forward firmly but gradually, without jumping to \r\nconclusions. \r\n The wide range of topics covered by the two draft \r\nresolutions is clear evidence of the strategic \r\nimportance of ocean affairs worldwide. The \r\nproductivity of the oceans depends on their being used \r\nin a sustainable manner, and on recognition by the \r\ninternational community that the problems of the \r\noceans are closely interlinked and should be considered \r\nas a whole. Mexico supports the draft resolutions and \r\nhopes to continue working in a committed and \r\nresponsible manner with the Members of the \r\nOrganization to meet the challenges faced by the \r\ninternational community with regard to the oceans. \r\n Mr. Borg (Malta): Malta wishes to align itself \r\nwith the statement delivered by the representative of \r\nSweden on behalf of the European Union. \r\n My delegation notes with appreciation the report \r\non oceans and the law of the sea submitted to this \r\nAssembly by the Secretary-General (A/64/66), which \r\nprovides a comprehensive overview of the latest \r\ndevelopments and issues relating to ocean affairs and \r\nthe law of the sea. Malta particularly welcomes the \r\nlarge number of wide-ranging topics covered by the \r\nreport, ranging from maritime space to climate change. \r\n It will be recalled that 42 years ago, Malta called \r\nupon United Nations Member States in this Assembly \r\nHall to undertake a reform of the law of the sea, which \r\nculminated in the adoption of the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea on 10 December \r\n1982. On 16 November of this year, we celebrated the \r\nfifteenth anniversary of the entry into force of the \r\nConvention, described as the constitution for regulating \r\nhumankind’s activities in the oceans. \r\n As stated by the Prime Minister of Malta in his \r\naddress to the General Assembly on 24 September \r\n2009, Malta feels that “[i]t is… necessary to see the \r\n1982 Convention in the light of some pressing \r\ncontemporary problems which are either being \r\naddressed inadequately or not being addressed at all” \r\n(A/64/PV.6). Malta therefore feels that the time has \r\ncome for the General Assembly to examine possible \r\napproaches to a review of the 1982 law of the sea \r\nConvention. For example, among its limitations, one \r\ncould note the provisions dealing with piracy, the illicit \r\ntraffic in narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances, the \r\nrules relating to the protection and preservation of the \r\nmarine environment, and the rules dealing with \r\nsubmarine cables and pipelines. A number of issues are \r\nalso not dealt with in the Convention, such as the \r\ntrafficking of human beings, the safety and security of \r\nnavigation, the transportation of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction, and climate change.  \r\n For all those reasons, the Prime Minister of Malta \r\nhas proposed that the General Assembly, through its \r\nrelevant bodies, undertake appropriate consultations \r\namong its member States to revise the Convention in \r\nview of the passage of time and the emergence of new \r\nand critical issues over the years. In that context, Malta \r\nintends to continue its consultations with other \r\ninterested Member States in order to consider how to \r\nadvance that proposal further. \r\n For centuries, pirates have been considered the \r\nenemies of mankind. International law has recognized \r\nthat characteristic by covering piracy through the \r\ndoctrine of universal jurisdiction. To a large extent, \r\nthat is reflected in articles 100 to 107 of the 1982 \r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. \r\nHowever, since the adoption of those articles, the \r\ninternational community has seen the re-emergence of \r\na problem that threatens vital sea routes. In the light of \r\nexperiences in certain regions of the oceans, it has \r\nbecome apparent that the provisions require revision, \r\nparticularly with respect to the definition of piracy in \r\narticle 101, the issue of seizing a pirate ship or aircraft, \r\nwhich is currently limited to the high seas, and the \r\nprosecution of pirates, particularly as problems of \r\nevidence and jurisdiction are encountered once the \r\npirates are arrested. \r\n Another issue of concern to Malta is the question \r\nof illegal fishing, especially in the Mediterranean. In \r\nthat regard, Malta welcomes the Agreement on Port \r\nState Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, \r\nUnreported and Unregulated Fishing, which was \r\nadopted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of \r\nthe United Nations (FAO) on 25 November this year \r\nand which aims to close fishing ports to ships involved \r\nin illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. Malta \r\nparticipated actively in the technical discussions on the \r\nport State measures held at FAO headquarters in Rome. \r\nIn that context, it is relevant to note that the European \r\nUnion, on behalf of its member States, was among the \r\nfirst signatories to sign the Agreement. \r\n With reference to paragraphs 117 and 118 of draft \r\nresolution A/64/L.18, which Malta supports \r\nwholeheartedly, my delegation wishes to encourage \r\n A/64/PV.57\r\n \r\n17 09-63459 \r\n \r\nStates to join the regional agreements and support their \r\nwork to ensure a better protection of the marine and \r\ncoastal environments. Indeed, Malta is proud to be the \r\nhost country of the Regional Marine Pollution \r\nEmergency Response Centre for the Mediterranean Sea \r\n(REMPEC), a Regional Activity Centre of the \r\nMediterranean Action Plan and the first Regional Seas \r\nProgramme, established by the United Nations \r\nEnvironment Programme in 1976.  \r\n Such Centres and regional cooperation schemes \r\nhave proved to be very useful tools for assisting \r\ncountries by enhancing at the regional level the \r\nenforcement of multilateral treaties on the protection of \r\nthe marine environment. Since its establishment, \r\nREMPEC has assisted more than 13 Mediterranean \r\ncoastal States in drafting their national contingency \r\nplans and has also facilitated the conclusion of \r\nsubregional response agreements. In such a politically \r\ndiverse geographical area, Regional Seas Programmes \r\nand technical cooperation assist in achieving the main \r\ngoals of the Organization, namely, to maintain peace \r\nand ensure better livelihoods for our citizens. \r\n As the Secretary-General points out in his report, \r\nthe perilous journeys by sea undertaken by people to \r\nclandestinely cross borders continue to result in the \r\nloss of life. In the Mediterranean, the sinking of small \r\nboats crowded beyond their capacity with illegal \r\nimmigrants has become an all too frequent occurrence \r\nresulting in the considerable loss of lives of women, \r\nchildren and men. That is a human tragedy that we \r\nmust all, without exception, try to avoid and resolve. \r\nThe number of those who risk their lives crossing the \r\nMediterranean, with grave consequences, requires \r\nurgent regional and international attention.  \r\n Last year, a record number of 2,775 irregular \r\nmigrants were rescued by the Armed Forces of Malta \r\nor landed in Malta. The number so far recorded this \r\nyear is 1,475. For an island State with a surface area of \r\n316 square kilometres and one of the highest \r\npopulation densities in the world, the magnitude of the \r\nproblem takes on a completely different dimension. \r\nNotwithstanding those severe difficulties, Malta has \r\ncontinued to honour its international obligations vis-à-\r\nvis genuine refugees and persons qualifying for \r\nhumanitarian protection and, indeed, is cited as one of \r\nthe countries, in proportion to its size and population, \r\nthat has awarded asylum to the highest number of \r\nasylum-seekers. \r\n My delegation is pleased to place on record in \r\nthis Assembly the fact that this year the International \r\nMaritime Law Institute (IMLI) is commemorating its \r\ntwentieth anniversary in the service of the rule of \r\ninternational maritime law. IMLI was established in \r\nMalta to provide States, particularly developing States, \r\nwith the facility to train their legal officials in the field \r\nof international maritime law. As pointed out by the \r\nSecretary-General of the International Maritime \r\nOrganization (IMO), IMLI has become an \r\nindispensable part of IMO for it allows Governments to \r\nhave at their disposal experts in the field of \r\ninternational maritime law whom Governments can \r\nconsult on compliance with international maritime \r\ntreaties.  \r\n Another important and unique aspect of training \r\nat IMLI is the emphasis given to the drafting of \r\nlegislation. Government legal officials are trained to \r\ndraft domestic laws that incorporate the international \r\nobligations found in international maritime treaties. \r\nThis enables Governments to enforce treaty provisions \r\nthrough their courts, thereby ensuring that international \r\ntreaties are implemented and enforced. \r\n To date, IMLI has trained 517 lawyers from 115 \r\nStates. Given this valuable training, States are advised \r\nto communicate with the Institute if they wish to send \r\ntheir judicial officials to attend the academic \r\nprogrammes. IMLI’s main course is the Master of \r\nLaws degree in international maritime law, and each \r\nyear 35 participants undertake an intensive course for \r\none academic year. The activities of IMLI have been \r\nrecognized as a valid and resourceful contribution to \r\ncapacity-building. As noted in the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport,  \r\n “Capacity-building is particularly vital in order to \r\nassist States in need to efficiently and effectively \r\nimplement their obligations under the Convention \r\nand other relevant instruments and receive \r\nbenefits from the regime contained therein”. \r\n(A/64/66/Add.1, para. 400). \r\n Malta endorses the statement made by the \r\nSecretary-General in his report that “[t]he international \r\ncommunity has a collective duty to constructively \r\naddress the multifaceted challenges facing the world’s \r\noceans and seas” (ibid., para. 398). Malta’s initiative \r\nin 1967 was precisely to bring to the fore and initiate a \r\nprocess which then saw its vision of an international \r\nregime for the oceans and the seabed become a reality \r\nA/64/PV.57  \r\n \r\n09-63459 18 \r\n \r\n15 years later. This universal treaty of law and order \r\npertaining to the common heritage of mankind has and \r\nwill continue to have far-reaching implications for the \r\npreservation and management of the oceans. \r\nFurthermore, its strengthening would enhance its \r\nrelevance to present-day needs and the needs of future \r\ngenerations. \r\n Finally, my delegation would like to indicate that \r\nagain this year, Malta is one of the sponsors of the two \r\ndraft resolutions under this agenda item, which are \r\nbefore the Assembly for consideration and approval. \r\n Mr. Al-Sheikh (Yemen) (spoke in Arabic): Allow \r\nme on behalf of the Republic of Yemen to thank the \r\nPresident for his excellent stewardship of this meeting \r\nof the Assembly devoted to the discussion of the \r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea \r\n(UNCLOS). I would be remiss if I neglected to thank \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his reports on this \r\nissue (A/64/66 and Add.1 and Add.2).  \r\n Given its geographic location, the Republic of \r\nYemen considers all issues related to oceans and seas \r\nof particular importance. We have been working to \r\nimplement UNCLOS provisions in a coordinated and \r\neffective manner despite the dire economic difficulties \r\nwe face. We are convinced that the Convention has \r\nestablished a comprehensive system for all of the \r\noceans and seas worldwide. In that connection, we pay \r\ntribute to all of the important mechanisms established \r\nto implement UNCLOS — the International Seabed \r\nAuthority, the Commission on the Limits of the \r\nContinental Shelf and the International Tribunal for the \r\nLaw of the Sea.  \r\n As a coastal and least developed country, Yemen \r\nis plagued by limited financial and technical resources \r\nand illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing \r\nactivities that have caused harm to our coast. We also \r\nsuffer from the effects of bottom trawling and stress in \r\nthat connection that those practices have depleted the \r\nfish stocks in our exclusive economic zone and \r\ndevastated the livelihoods of our fishermen, thus \r\nexacerbating the food security crisis and poverty in my \r\ncountry. These practices have also damaged our marine \r\necosystems and their biodiversity. We therefore call on \r\nall States to implement effective measures to manage \r\nsustainable fisheries and control all fishing vessels in \r\norder to protect living marine resources and the marine \r\nenvironment. \r\n We believe that the work of the Commission on \r\nthe Limits of the Continental Shelf is of primary \r\nimportance in facilitating the exercise by coastal \r\ncountries of full sovereignty over their continental \r\nshelf. For that reason, we welcome the draft resolution \r\non oceans and the law of the sea (A/64/L.18). We have \r\nsubmitted our report on the limitation of our \r\ncontinental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles south-east \r\nof Socotra Island, in implementation of paragraph 8 of \r\narticle 76 of UNCLOS, thus meeting the deadline of \r\n13 May 2009. \r\n My country notes the statement delivered by the \r\nChairman of the Commission at the nineteenth Meeting \r\nof States Parties to UNCLOS, at which he informed my \r\ndelegation that the Commission will consider Yemen’s \r\nsubmission in 2012 and will issue its recommendation \r\non our continental shelf in 2015, according to its \r\nprogramme of work. \r\n Yemen shares the concern of other States with \r\nregard to the Commission’s workload and funding. In \r\nthis context, we stress the importance of providing \r\nfunding to the Commission in order enhance its ability \r\nto handle the increasing number of submissions and to \r\novercome its limitations, as well as to enable it to study \r\nin a serious, practical and precise manner all of the \r\nsubmissions and to present its recommendations in a \r\ntime manner. \r\n We are confident that the Contact Group on the \r\nCommission’s work will achieve satisfactory results \r\nand we pay tribute to the support given to the \r\nCommission, its subsidiary bodies and the Division for \r\nOcean Affairs and the Law of the Sea. \r\n My country is increasingly concerned by the \r\ngrowing phenomenon of piracy in the territorial waters \r\nand high seas off the coast of Somalia. We stress the \r\nimportance of safety for fishing and navigation in all \r\ninternational waters and call for the vigorous \r\ncondemnation of all acts of piracy and armed robbery \r\nwherever they occur.  \r\n Yemen, itself a victim of piracy, has contributed \r\nto all international efforts to combat that scourge. \r\nPirates have constantly attacked our fishing vessels, \r\nand many Yemeni fishermen whose livelihoods depend \r\non fishing have been exposed to attacks by naval forces \r\npatrolling international waters, in the course of which \r\nsome have been killed or injured.  \r\n A/64/PV.57\r\n \r\n19 09-63459 \r\n \r\n We welcome paragraph 74 of the draft resolution \r\non oceans and the law of the sea, which invites all \r\nStates, the International Maritime Organization and the \r\nInternational Labour Organization to consider possible \r\nsolutions for the seafarers and fishers who are victims \r\nof pirates. We call upon all international maritime \r\nforces to unify their activities in order to protect the \r\nfishermen and their livelihoods.  \r\n We stress the importance of cooperation and \r\ncoordination of efforts at the international and regional \r\nlevels to combat piracy. All efforts to combat piracy \r\nshould be in line with relevant international rules and \r\nshould respect the sovereignty of the State over its \r\nterritorial waters. We also stress that we stand ready to \r\ncooperate with all stakeholders in order to bring about \r\nsecurity and stability in the Arabian Sea, the Red Sea \r\nand the Gulf of Aden. \r\n We support the efforts being made by the United \r\nNations and the International Maritime Organization in \r\norder to combat piracy and armed robbery off the coast \r\nof Somalia. We welcome the adoption of the Djibouti \r\nCode of Conduct to combat piracy and armed robbery \r\nof vessels in the Western Indian Ocean and the Gulf of \r\nAden. We also welcome its entry into force in January \r\nof this year. \r\n We are also appreciative of the establishment of \r\nthree regional centres in Yemen, Kenya and Tanzania \r\nto share relevant information on piracy and armed \r\nrobbery. We also believe that the four working groups \r\non piracy are an effective means of international \r\ncooperation to combat piracy. We wish to stress that \r\npiracy is a natural outcome of the deterioration of the \r\npolitical situation in Somalia and the lack of stability in \r\nthat country for two decades. It will only be overcome \r\nif the international community succeeds in finding a \r\ncomprehensive political solution to all the problems of \r\nSomalia and assist all Somali factions to form a \r\nnational unity government so as to bring about security \r\nand stability in its land, sea and air. \r\n Ms. Medina-Carrasco (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): The Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela wishes to take this opportunity \r\nto reaffirm the importance it attaches to the subject of \r\nthe oceans and the law of the sea. We cannot ignore the \r\nrole played by the oceans and seas in meeting our food \r\nneeds. Nor can we ignore the fact that they constitute a \r\ncentral component in the world system for sustaining \r\nlife and a valuable resource that contributes to \r\nachieving sustainable development. \r\n For that reason, the use of the oceans and seas is \r\ndealt with as a matter of public policy in our country \r\nand given priority attention, as is amply reflected in \r\nour national legislation and the plans and programmes \r\ndesigned and implemented in accordance with criteria \r\nand principles regarding the conservation and use of \r\nmarine resources. \r\n In that connection, the Republic has been \r\nattentive to developments and events at the \r\ninternational level during the course of this year \r\nregarding the subject of the oceans and the seas. We \r\nattach particular importance to the tenth meeting of the \r\nUnited Nations Open-ended Informal Consultative \r\nProcess on Oceans and the Law of the Sea, held from \r\n17 to 19 June 2009 here at the United Nations \r\nheadquarters.  \r\n Venezuela believes, as it stated during those \r\ndiscussions, that the Consultative Process is a forum \r\nfor political and technical consultation that involves all \r\nStates and other parties interested in assessing the \r\ncondition of the marine environment worldwide. We \r\nbelieve that it is essential to maintain the Process as a \r\npermanent forum within the United Nations, since it \r\nallows for synergy among the major international \r\ninstruments related to the environment, which will, in \r\nturn, eventually lead to consistency in matters related \r\nto the oceans and seas and will make it possible to \r\nremedy the legal gaps in the law of the sea. \r\n Moreover, it should be pointed out that \r\napproaches to the oceans and the seas should stay \r\nwithin the conceptual framework of sustainable \r\ndevelopment. In that regard, it is necessary, for \r\nexample, to examine further the role of the oceans in \r\nmatters relating to the eradication of poverty, food \r\nsecurity and the interrelationship between oceans and \r\nclimate change.  \r\n On that subject, we share the concern about and \r\nthe interest expressed in gaining further knowledge of \r\nthe scope of that interrelationship and, in particular, the \r\nimportance of promoting at the international level an \r\nawareness regarding the impact of climate change on \r\nmarine ecosystems and, in particular, on low-lying \r\ncoastal areas and coastal States, with full respect for \r\nthe standards and principles laid down in the United \r\nNations Framework Convention of Climate Change \r\nand its Kyoto Protocol. \r\nA/64/PV.57  \r\n \r\n09-63459 20 \r\n \r\n It is timely and necessary to point out in the \r\ncontext of our debate on the oceans and the law of the \r\nsea that we continue to be concerned at the existing \r\ndeficiencies in the implementation of the international \r\nlegal framework on the management and conservation \r\nof genetic resources beyond national jurisdiction. \r\nTherefore, in my delegation’s view, this forum should \r\nalso deal on a permanent basis with all the conventions \r\nrelating to the subject, in particular the United Nations \r\nConvention on Biological Diversity. \r\n In that regard, I would like to state that the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela does not accept that \r\nthe management of such resources should be decided \r\nthrough a legal regime that seeks to exclude some \r\nparties. My delegation also believes it is necessary to \r\nengage in further research with a view to arriving at the \r\nscientific certainty needed to guide the international \r\ncommunity in adopting the best possible decisions in \r\nthat connection. \r\n The complex reality we face today convincingly \r\ndemonstrates that the United Nations Convention on \r\nthe Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 does not \r\nincorporate, neither in its text nor in its additional \r\nAgreement, any full treatment of all aspects and \r\nsubjects to be dealt with by the international \r\ncommunity with regard to the oceans and seas.  \r\n On that basis, the Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela draws attention to the key role of other \r\ninternational instruments in dealing with marine and \r\ncoastal biological diversity beyond national \r\njurisdiction, as reflected in decision IX/20 of the ninth \r\nmeeting of the Conference of the Parties to the \r\nConvention on Biological Diversity, which was held \r\nfrom 19 to 30 May 2008 in Bonn, Germany.  \r\n Regarding the draft resolution on sustainable \r\nfisheries and the Agreement for the Implementation of \r\nthe Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the \r\nLaw of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the \r\nConservation and the Management of Straddling Fish \r\nStocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks and \r\nassociated instruments, my delegation would also like \r\nto emphasize that that is a highly sensitive matter and \r\nconstitutes an area of priority importance for our \r\ncountry. Hence, we have undertaken significant and \r\nfar-reaching initiatives to promote and implement \r\nprogrammes for the conservation, protection and \r\nmanagement of marine biological resources. \r\n In our legislation on fisheries and aquaculture, \r\npenalties have been established for imposition on \r\nvessels flying the national flag that engage in illegal \r\nactivities relating to the extraction of resources without \r\ndue authorization by the State and also for incursions \r\ninto waters under the State’s jurisdiction without the \r\nsubmission of the requisite documentation. Such \r\nsituations are then reported to the flag State of the \r\nvessel. With respect to highly migratory fish stocks, we \r\nmaintain a register of vessels, which is regularly \r\ntransmitted to regional fisheries management \r\norganizations for follow-up in accordance with \r\nregulations on enhancing transparency. At the \r\ninternational level, the Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela has implemented the principles of the Code \r\nof Conduct for Responsible Fisheries of the Food and \r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), \r\nand of chapter 17 of Agenda 21 adopted at the United \r\nNations Conference on Environment and Development, \r\nwhich was held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. Likewise, \r\nwe actively participate in regional and other fisheries \r\norganizations, such as the FAO Committee on Fisheries \r\nand its subsidiary bodies, the Western Central Atlantic \r\nFishery Commission, the Latin American Fisheries \r\nDevelopment Organization, the Commission for Inland \r\nFisheries of Latin America, the International \r\nCommission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas \r\nand the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission.  \r\n The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela considers \r\nit vital to participate in initiatives to combat illegal, \r\nunreported and unregulated fishing. Our Government \r\nhas adopted the measures necessary to tackle that \r\nproblem through ongoing reporting of the position and \r\nlegal status of vessels flying the Venezuelan flag on the \r\nhigh seas to the regional fisheries management \r\norganizations of which we are a part. Moreover, \r\nVenezuelan law provides for the installation of global \r\npositioning satellite equipment and devices in fishing \r\nvessels of over ten gross register tons. Also, it made \r\nsignificant contributions, in its national capacity, to the \r\nlegally binding Agreement on Port State Measures to \r\nPrevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and \r\nUnregulated Fishing, adopted in the framework of \r\ntechnical consultations by FAO. \r\n Our delegation demonstrated the commitment of \r\nthe Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to cooperate with \r\nmultilateral efforts and initiatives seeking to promote \r\nthe sustainable development of oceans and seas. Since \r\nthe oceans and the seas are a universal heritage, we \r\n A/64/PV.57\r\n \r\n21 09-63459 \r\n \r\nadvocate applying an international judicial framework \r\nthat would incorporate all regional and international \r\nagreements that regulate the conservation and \r\nsustainable use of marine resources. \r\n Lastly, Venezuela reiterates its historic position, \r\nwhich it has maintained in various international \r\nforums, namely that the United Nations Convention on \r\nthe Law of the Sea is not the only source of the law of \r\nthe sea. For that reason, we object to the proposition \r\nthat it is the sole source. It should be recalled that it \r\ndoes not enjoy global acceptance, inasmuch as a \r\nsignificant number of States are not parties to it. \r\n Mr. Mohamed (Maldives): The ocean is integral \r\nto all aspects of Maldivian life. There are few nations \r\nin the world whose well-being and future development \r\nare so intricately linked to their marine and coastal \r\necosystems. While this interrelationship has enhanced \r\nour culture and lifestyle for centuries, it has also made \r\nus particularly vulnerable to the ocean’s fragility. We \r\nrecognize that within our borders we have primary \r\nresponsibility for protecting this vital resource and all \r\nthat flows from it, and we continue in our efforts to \r\nmeet these obligations. Many of the challenges, \r\nhowever, require international cooperation before one \r\nState can make a difference.  Because of that, I \r\nwould like to take this opportunity to applaud the \r\nefforts of those Member States working towards \r\nimplementing and refining the law of the sea. My \r\ndelegation also welcomes the report by the Secretary \r\nGeneral, submitted pursuant to General Assembly \r\nresolution 63/111, detailing the developments and \r\nissues relating to ocean affairs and the law of the sea \r\n(A/64/66). \r\n The precarious state of the world’s oceans is \r\nunmistakable, and the Maldives experiences the \r\nconsequences of the problem through economic, social \r\nand ecological signals. The last few decades have seen \r\nthe continued overexploitation of fisheries, with only \r\n20 per cent of stocks considered moderately exploited \r\nor underexploited. Sustainable fisheries management is \r\na key concern of the Maldivian community. Fisheries, \r\nalong with tourism, are the two mainstays of our \r\neconomy, accounting for 90 per cent of gross domestic \r\nproduct and three quarters of all jobs. Dependence, \r\nhowever, on transboundary stocks such as the tuna, \r\nwhich constitutes 90 per cent of our commercial catch, \r\nrepresents a key vulnerability. Our efforts alone cannot \r\nprotect this species; further international cooperation, \r\nresearch and management efforts are required to ensure \r\nthat fishery’s lasting viability. \r\n Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in our \r\nwaters remains a pressing concern. Despite \r\nconsiderable efforts, which include creating additional \r\nreserves and introducing new legislative measures, the \r\nMaldives’ struggles to make significant headway. \r\nPolicing an exclusive economic zone of 859,000 square \r\nkilometres and over 1,100 islands, of which just 194 \r\nare inhabited, would present challenges even to the \r\nmore developed countries, but is particularly \r\nproblematic given the Maldives’ development status \r\nand limited capacity. Illegal fishing jeopardizes food \r\nsecurity for our people and undermines our efforts to \r\nmanage our fisheries so that we can sustainably exploit \r\ntheir economic potential and protect them from \r\ndegradation. \r\n All efforts taken by the Secretary-General to \r\nassist small island developing States and other \r\ndeveloping countries to develop sound marine \r\necosystem management practices are greatly \r\nappreciated. We also note the need to continue \r\nincreasing international cooperation on policing and \r\nprosecuting illegal fishing. Again, these are global \r\nissues, and we are bound together in the search for \r\nlasting solutions. \r\n Any threat to the biodiversity of our marine \r\necosystems is a threat to our sustainable development. \r\nHealthy fisheries aside, the genetic material contained \r\nin that biodiversity is a potential and unexplored source \r\nof economic opportunity: our atolls form by far the \r\nlargest group of coral reefs in the Indian Ocean, with \r\nover 250 species of coral and over 1,100 species of reef \r\nfishes. Our tourism industry is dependent on healthy \r\nand flourishing reef ecosystems. A functioning reef \r\nsystem also provides a very necessary buffer from \r\nextreme weather events, in which the erosive power of \r\nthe sea reduces our land area. This has unimaginable \r\nconsequences to island States such as the Maldives, as \r\na shrinking land area affects the limits of our exclusive \r\neconomic zone, thereby impacting on our territory as \r\nan independent and sovereign nation. \r\n The catastrophic impact of climate change on \r\nmarine ecosystem resilience cannot be \r\noveremphasized. Coral reefs are considered amongst \r\nthe most vulnerable ecosystems. Their susceptibility to \r\nthe consequences of climate change, including rising \r\nocean temperatures and acidity and rising sea levels, \r\nA/64/PV.57  \r\n \r\n09-63459 22 \r\n \r\nhas led to projections that such reefs will be wiped out \r\nwithin 50 to 100 years. We cannot begin to describe the \r\ntragedy that that would represent for our country. One \r\nneed only look at the 1998 El Niño episode alone, in \r\nwhich certain species of coral saw a 99 per cent \r\ndecline, with an economic loss estimated at  \r\n$91 million, to grasp the consequences of a more \r\nsustained warming. \r\n Combating such impacts will place an enormous \r\nburden on small island developing States and threaten \r\nto undermine ongoing development efforts. We are \r\nproud that the Maldives is taking an active leadership \r\nrole in this area, with President Mohamed Nasheed \r\nannouncing earlier this year that the Maldives will \r\nstrive to be carbon neutral by 2020. Pursuing \r\ninnovative approaches to adaptation options for reefs \r\nand developing ways to decrease other environmental \r\nstresses to maximize reef resilience are key issues for \r\nsmall island developing States such as the Maldives. \r\nHowever, such efforts need broader international \r\nsupport, through capacity building and technology \r\ntransfer. We also emphasize the need for more stringent \r\nemissions abatement by all large emitters for the \r\nbenefit of oceans globally and given the limits to \r\npossible adaptation at the social, biophysical and \r\neconomic levels. This underscores the need for greater \r\nintegration between a new international climate regime \r\nand the law of the sea, given that the success of one is \r\ninexorably linked to the other. \r\n Our geographic isolation, along with our narrow \r\neconomic base, requires us to import nearly all our \r\nsupplies. Thus, the Maldives is extremely vulnerable to \r\nall the external shocks impacting the global economy. \r\nWe refer here particularly to the devastating impact on \r\nour domestic economy of any rise in oil prices, the \r\nrecent global financial crisis and the terrorist attacks of \r\n11 September 2001. Other threats to shipping, such as \r\nthe recent increase in piracy off the coast of East \r\nAfrica, are also of particular concern. Our ability to \r\ncombat the rising cost of living for our people and to \r\nassist them in satisfying even their basic needs, let \r\nalone improving their quality of life through \r\nsustainable development, is intricately tied to shocks \r\nover which we have little or no control. \r\n The issues we have raised need to be tackled at \r\nmultiple levels. As for many of the global problems we \r\nface, truly international responses are required and \r\nmust be supported by regional and local action. The \r\nsmall island developing States, through their own \r\ndomestic legal frameworks and cooperatively through \r\ninstruments such as the Barbados Programme of \r\nAction, are directing considerable time and resources \r\nto discharging our responsibilities to the best of our \r\nabilities. However, we do not have the capacity to \r\nsucceed in this work alone. \r\n Recognizing this fact, we applaud the continued \r\nefforts of the General Assembly to secure international \r\ncooperation and coordination on these matters and are \r\ntruly grateful for the assistance that has already been so \r\ngenerously provided. But we call upon the \r\ninternational community to redouble its efforts to \r\nsupport, promote and strengthen capacity-building \r\nactivities associated with the sustainable development \r\nof our ocean resources, including the building of \r\nscientific research capacity and enhanced technologies \r\nand capacities for responding to threats to maritime \r\nsecurity and safety, the conservation and sustainable \r\ndevelopment and use of marine resources, and \r\necosystem and fisheries management approaches as a \r\nwhole.  \r\n We must also be prepared to think creatively \r\nabout how we tackle these problems and how we \r\nintegrate existing law of the sea obligations with other \r\nmultilateral environmental agreements. Importantly, as \r\nscientific understanding evolves and we enter the \r\nuncertain world of climate change, we must also be \r\nflexible enough in our legal frameworks to respond \r\nquickly and decisively to new challenges as they \r\nemerge. \r\n Mr. Goledzinowski (Australia): Australia has the \r\nhonour this afternoon to co-sponsor both of the draft \r\nresolutions before us today (A/64/L.18 and A/64/L.29). \r\nThese drafts resolutions continue to raise issues of key \r\nimportance to Australia, including bottom fisheries, \r\nhigh seas governance and the workload of the \r\nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf. I \r\nwill briefly touch upon each of these issues. \r\n Australia supports the outcomes of this year’s \r\nsustainable fisheries draft resolution and was pleased \r\nto participate in the informal consultations on it, \r\nparticularly the review of the implementation of the \r\nbottom fishing provisions in resolution 61/105. This \r\ndraft resolution recognizes the immense importance \r\nand value of deep-sea ecosystems and the biodiversity \r\nthey contain, and was an important step forward in \r\nregulating bottom fishing and managing the impacts of \r\nfishing on vulnerable marine ecosystems. Australia \r\n A/64/PV.57\r\n \r\n23 09-63459 \r\n \r\nreaffirms its strong commitment to regulating bottom \r\nfisheries in accordance with resolution 61/105 and \r\nwelcomes all efforts made thus far to adopt and \r\nimplement such measures. We encourage further efforts \r\nto meet the objectives of resolution 61/105.  \r\n Australia encourages all States and regional \r\nfisheries management organizations (RFMOs) to \r\nensure that areas where vulnerable marine ecosystems \r\nare known to occur or likely to occur are closed to \r\nbottom fishing activities, and that activities are \r\nauthorized to proceed only if management measures \r\nare in place to prevent significant adverse impacts in \r\naccordance with resolution 61/105. \r\n We are also pleased to see the 2008 International \r\nGuidelines on the Management of Deep-sea Fisheries \r\nin the High Seas, issued by the Food and Agriculture \r\nOrganization (FAO), recognized for the guidance they \r\nprovide in implementing measures in accordance with \r\nresolution 61/105. We note that the FAO Guidelines \r\nprovide a minimum standard of response to the need to \r\nimprove the conservation and management of deep-sea \r\nfisheries, and in this respect should complement and \r\nfurther inform existing efforts and measures adopted \r\nby RFMOs, such as the standards already agreed \r\nthrough the Commission for the Conservation of \r\nAntarctic Marine Living Resources. \r\n We are pleased that this year’s draft resolution \r\nwelcomes the adoption of the Convention on the \r\nConservation and Management of High Seas Fishery \r\nResources in the South Pacific Ocean, which \r\nestablishes a South Pacific RFMO. When the \r\nConvention enters into force, the gap that exists in the \r\ninternational conservation and management of \r\nnon-highly migratory fisheries and the protection of \r\nbiodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction \r\nextending from the most easterly part of the southern \r\nIndian Ocean through the Pacific towards the exclusive \r\neconomic zones of South America will be closed. We \r\nlook forward to the entry into force of the Convention \r\nand to working with others in this important new \r\nRFMO. \r\n Australia also continues to implore all States that \r\nhave yet to do so to ratify the 1995 Fish Stocks \r\nAgreement and to join each regional fisheries \r\nmanagement organization or arrangement where they \r\nhave an interest. \r\n Australia is a strong supporter of the United \r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea. We have \r\nadopted measures on the safety of navigation and the \r\nprotection of the marine environment in a manner that \r\nis consistent with international law, including the \r\nConvention. \r\n Australia acknowledges the considerable \r\nworkload faced by the Commission on the Limits of \r\nthe Continental Shelf and notes the importance of \r\nsubmissions being examined within a reasonable time \r\nframe, including to ensure the continued engagement \r\nof relevant expertise. Australia supports the informal \r\nworking group and encourages States to actively \r\ncontribute to its work. \r\n Finally, Australia welcomes the reconvening of \r\nthe Ad Hoc Open-ended Informal Working Group to \r\nstudy issues relating to the conservation and \r\nsustainable use of marine biological diversity beyond \r\nareas of national jurisdiction. We understand that the \r\nWorking Group will convene in February 2010. It is \r\nimportant that adequate arrangements and governance \r\nstructures be in place to ensure the conservation and \r\nsustainable use of marine biodiversity beyond national \r\njurisdiction. Australia looks forward to further progress \r\non these issues in February. \r\n Mr. Pramanik (Bangladesh): At the outset, I \r\ncongratulate President Ali Abdussalam Treki and other \r\nmembers of the Bureau on their election to their high \r\nposts in the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth \r\nsession. My delegation is confident that, under his able \r\nleadership, the session will be a great success. My \r\ndelegation is always ready to extend its full \r\ncooperation to him. I thank the President, the \r\nSecretary-General and the Secretariat, and in particular \r\nthe Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea \r\nfor its reports on oceans and the law of the sea \r\n(A/64/66 and Add.1 and 2) which have been submitted \r\nto this Assembly for consideration. We express our \r\ndeep appreciation to the coordinators for their hard \r\nwork in conducting the negotiations on the two draft \r\nresolutions (A/64/L.18 and A/64/L.29). \r\n The United Nations Convention on the Law of \r\nthe Sea is the fundamental document that provides the \r\nlegal framework for States’ rights and obligations \r\nrelating to the use of ocean space. The Convention \r\nfurther regulates the exploration and exploitation of the \r\nresources therein. \r\n The resources of the oceans and seas can make \r\nsignificant contributions to the achievement of \r\nsustainable development. In this regard, we strongly \r\nA/64/PV.57  \r\n \r\n09-63459 24 \r\n \r\nemphasize the essential need for cooperation, including \r\nthrough capacity-building and the transfer of marine \r\ntechnology, to ensure that all States, especially \r\ndeveloping countries and in particular the least-\r\ndeveloped countries and small island developing \r\nStates, are able to benefit from the sustainable \r\ndevelopment of the oceans and seas. \r\n Bangladesh recognizes that the Informal \r\nConsultative Process, a unique forum for the \r\ncomprehensive discussion of issues related to oceans \r\nand the law of the sea, must take into consideration the \r\ntrue perspective of the three pillars of sustainable \r\ndevelopment. In this regard, we welcome the decision \r\ncontained in draft resolution A/64/L.18 that the \r\nConsultative Process at its eleventh meeting will focus \r\nits discussions on capacity-building in ocean affairs \r\nand the law of the sea, including marine science. \r\n The proven impacts of climate change are being \r\nseen with greater severity and frequency, and new \r\nestimates are being established. One such estimate is \r\nthat by 2100, the rise in sea level could be more than \r\none metre, which would inundate some 15 to 17 per \r\ncent of the low-lying costal areas of Bangladesh, \r\ndisplacing approximately 20 million people. \r\nBangladesh is thus deeply concerned over the current \r\nand projected adverse effects of climate change on the \r\ncostal population of millions worldwide, including on \r\ntheir livelihoods. We will need to find appropriate \r\nways and means to identify adaptation measures \r\nrequired to redress the sea-level rise. We therefore \r\nemphasize the urgency of addressing the climate \r\nchange issue under the agenda item “Oceans and the \r\nlaw of the sea”. \r\n The Commission on the Limits of the Continental \r\nShelf is now overloaded with submissions. There are \r\npotentially 99 submissions — 50 actual submissions \r\nplus 49 filings of preliminary information — in the \r\nCommission’s queue. Assuming the current rate of \r\nprogress, as outlined by the Chairman of the \r\nCommission before the nineteenth Meeting of States \r\nParties, it could be 50 years or more before the \r\nCommission will have examined all the submissions. \r\nThis implies that all sorts of continental shelf \r\ndelimitation issues, at least for areas beyond 200 \r\nnautical miles, will effectively have to be put on hold \r\nuntil the Commission has dealt with the submissions of \r\naffected areas and States. \r\n Bangladesh is deeply concerned by the workload \r\nof the Commission. We need to find creative and \r\npractical solutions to redress this problem. States \r\nparties to the Convention need to address this situation \r\nwith the utmost urgency and take the necessary \r\nmeasures, including interim measures, to enable the \r\nCommission to discharge its functions in a timely \r\nmanner by holding lengthier and more frequent \r\nsessions. In this regard, we welcome the \r\nrecommendations contained in paragraphs 52 and 53 of \r\nthe draft resolution encouraging States to participate \r\nactively and contribute constructively to the ongoing \r\nwork of the informal working group of the Bureau. We \r\nfurther call upon States to make voluntary \r\ncontributions to the Trust Fund established for \r\npayments of emoluments of the Commission members, \r\nparticularly those from developing States. \r\n Bangladesh should like to reaffirm its strong \r\nposition that, in accordance with article 77, paragraph \r\n3, of the Convention, “the rights of the coastal State \r\nover the continental shelf do not depend on occupation, \r\neffective or notional, or any express proclamation”. In \r\nthis regard, Bangladesh strongly endorses the inclusion \r\nof this fundamental continental shelf doctrine in the \r\ndraft resolution on oceans and law of the sea that the \r\nAssembly will consider later today in order to clarify \r\nambiguities that might exist concerning costal States’ \r\nentitlements and rights over the continental shelf \r\nbeyond 200 nautical miles, based on natural \r\nprolongation. \r\n In essence, article 76 and the Statement of \r\nUnderstanding prescribe procedures whereby qualified \r\ncoastal States must define the extents of their exclusive \r\ncontinental shelf entitlements beyond 200 nautical \r\nmiles. With individual States seeking to define their \r\nperceived entitlements, it is to be expected that \r\ndiffering interpretations will arise concerning the areas \r\nwhere these entitlements apply, leading inevitably to \r\nsituations in which adjacent or opposite States will \r\nclaim entitlements to the same portions of the seabed. \r\nSuch overlaps could be bilateral and involve just two \r\nStates, or they could be multilateral and involve three \r\nor more States. A good example of the latter case is the \r\nBay of Bengal, where Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka and \r\nMyanmar claim jurisdiction over overlapping \r\ncontinental shelf areas. \r\n In this regard, Bangladesh recalls with \r\nsatisfaction that States parties to the Convention may \r\nsubmit to, inter alia, the International Tribunal for the \r\n A/64/PV.57\r\n \r\n25 09-63459 \r\n \r\nLaw of the Sea or the International Court of Justice any \r\ndispute concerning matters relating to maritime affairs, \r\nincluding boundary delimitation. Bearing that in mind, \r\nBangladesh has recently submitted its maritime \r\nboundary dispute matters to an arbitral tribunal \r\npursuant to Annex VII of the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea. \r\n There can be little doubt that the partitioning of \r\nouter continental shelves offers coastal States a \r\ntremendous opportunity for engaging in substantive \r\ndialogue that leads ultimately to cooperation and \r\nharmonious relations. The Commission on the Limits \r\nof the Continental Shelf will not intervene in situations \r\nwhere coastal States object to the proposed outer shelf \r\nlimits of their neighbours, leaving it to the affected \r\nStates to seek a solution through direct negotiation or \r\nthrough established mechanisms for arbitration. To \r\nachieve success in this arena, my delegation is of the \r\nview that it is essential to develop early on a positive \r\nrelationship with neighbour States that fosters a climate \r\nof trust and good will and facilitates increasing levels \r\nof collaboration in activities aimed at achieving an \r\nequitable solution. \r\n Mr. Mahiga (United Republic of Tanzania): My \r\ndelegation would like to thank the Secretary-General \r\nfor his comprehensive report on oceans and the law of \r\nthe sea, contained in document A/64/66 and \r\nAddendums 1 and 2. The report provides us with a \r\nuseful basis for the consideration of this agenda item. \r\nWe commend the Secretariat for its continued hard \r\nwork in following up various matters relating to the \r\nlaw of the sea, which continues to be the subject of \r\ngrowing attention in the General Assembly. We further \r\ncongratulate the coordinators, Ms. Holly Koehler of the \r\nUnited States and Ambassador Henrique Valle of \r\nBrazil, for their professional conduct of the informal \r\nconsultations on the two draft resolutions before the \r\nAssembly (A/64/L.18 and A/64/L.29). We also thank \r\nthe delegations that made valuable contributions to the \r\nconsultations. \r\n My delegation would like to focus on some \r\nspecific aspects of the report before the Assembly.  \r\n First, on the subject of maritime safety and \r\nsecurity, it is not arguable that piracy and armed \r\nrobbery against ships are among the major menacing \r\nproblems threatening the international regime of \r\nmaritime trade and security of navigation. The number \r\nof reported incidents — not even including unreported \r\nones — as indicated in the report is alarming. Figures \r\nindicate that the number of incidents of piracy and \r\narmed robbery, especially in the Indian Ocean, is on \r\nthe increase despite the current international efforts to \r\ncheck it. We believe that this is a time to translate our \r\ncollective concern into tangible efforts to contain the \r\nproblem and to ensure that it is progressively dealt \r\nwith. \r\n The statistics indicated in the report of the \r\nSecretary-General clearly break with the assumption \r\nthat this problem is limited to a specific region. \r\nAlthough statistics show that incidents of piracy are \r\nhigh in specific areas, it is also evident that they are \r\nnot uncommon in other parts of the world. To my \r\ndelegation, this is yet another reason why the \r\ninternational community should be urged to come up \r\nwith mechanisms to combat this crisis wherever in the \r\nworld it strikes. We must continue to enhance \r\ncooperation among States to ensure the safety and \r\nsecurity of navigation and improve prevention and \r\nresponse capabilities in responding to new and \r\nemerging threats to maritime security. States should be \r\nhighly encouraged in particular to patrol and ensure the \r\nsafety of maritime waters for navigational purposes in \r\na concerted manner. \r\n Concerted efforts should also be extended to \r\nfighting impunity. My delegation strongly urges \r\nMember States to continue exploring the available \r\nmeans of prosecuting suspected pirates, particularly by \r\nexercising jurisdiction as provided for in article 105 of \r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. \r\nWe further recommend that, in the future, we open a \r\ndebate to explore the possibility of expanding the \r\njurisdiction of the International Criminal Court to \r\ninclude the crime of piracy.  \r\n There may also be a need for an urgent \r\ninternational conference under the auspices of the \r\nUnited Nations to re-examine the resurgence of this \r\nage-old problem of piracy, and to review the efficacy \r\nand relevance of existing conventions in responding to \r\nthe new challenge. The conference would also rally \r\ninternational political will and obligations in dealing \r\nwith the problem of piracy under the leadership of the \r\nUnited Nations, in partnership with regional \r\norganizations and other stakeholders in the \r\ninternational community. \r\n Secondly, regarding the Commission on the \r\nLimits of the Continental Shelf, my delegation is \r\nA/64/PV.57  \r\n \r\n09-63459 26 \r\n \r\npleased by the many States that have complied with \r\ntheir obligation under the Charter to complete their \r\nsubmissions in accordance with article 4 of annex II of \r\nthe Convention and preliminary information in \r\naccordance with paragraph 1 (a) of document \r\nSPLOS/183.  \r\n However, we wish to join other delegations that \r\nhave expressed their concern on the challenge that the \r\nCommission is now facing in examining the large \r\nnumber of submissions. My delegation is concerned \r\nwith the timeline for examining such submissions. In \r\nthis respect, we request the General Assembly to \r\nconsider the proposals of Member States to facilitate \r\nthe prompt examination of these submissions, \r\nparticularly by increasing the capacity of the \r\nCommission in order to enable it examine the \r\nsubmissions in the shortest possible time frame so that \r\nwe do not defeat the spirit of the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea. \r\n Thirdly, regarding the conservation of marine \r\nfisheries resources, my delegation is deeply concerned \r\nabout reckless illegal fishing activities, which have \r\nadverse effects and lead to the overexploitation of fish \r\nspecies and the marine environment, particularly for \r\ndeveloping coastal States. We strongly urge the \r\ninternational community to continue its efforts to \r\nprovide the necessary assistance to build the capacities \r\nof and equip developing coastal States to monitor and \r\nprotect their marine resources. Regional cooperation \r\nand efforts to develop joint patrol programmes are also \r\nvery effective ways of curbing this problem. We \r\nwelcome the efforts to develop a comprehensive global \r\nrecord on fishing vessels and refrigerated transport and \r\nsupply vessels. While addressing this problem, related \r\nsecurity problems in the high seas can also be met or at \r\nleast better understood. \r\n Fourthly, the adverse impact of climate change is \r\nthrowing up new challenges to marine ecology, from \r\nthreats to the very existence of some island States and \r\nthe displacement of coastal populations to the possible \r\nextinction of some marine animal and plant species in \r\nvarious parts of the world due to the destruction of \r\ntheir habitat and ecosystems. The legal and socio-\r\neconomic implications of these changes will now be far \r\nbetter understood and responded to in a manner \r\nproportionate to the threat. As already mentioned, at \r\nthe forthcoming Copenhagen Conference on Climate \r\nChange, the legal dimensions of such future changes \r\nneed to be recognized, addressed or at least flagged for \r\nfollow-up action after the Conference. Again, on this \r\nissue, we continue to count on the leadership of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n In conclusion, we welcome the ratification of the \r\nConvention by Switzerland, the Dominican Republic \r\nand, recently, Chad, and urge those States that still \r\nhave not ratified the Convention to consider doing so \r\nin order to achieve the ultimate goal of universal \r\nparticipation. \r\n Mr. Manjeev Singh Puri (India): First of all, I \r\nwould like to take this opportunity to thank the \r\nPresident of the Assembly for convening this debate. \r\nMy delegation would like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his excellent report (A/64/66 and Add.1 \r\nand Add.2) on issues relating to oceans and the law of \r\nthe sea. \r\n We appreciate the presentation of the report \r\n(A/64/347) on the work of the Ad Hoc Working Group \r\nof the Whole, established pursuant to paragraph 157 of \r\nresolution 63/111, on the regular process for global \r\nreporting and assessment of the state of the marine \r\nenvironment, including socio-economic aspects. We \r\nare happy to note that the regular process would be \r\nguided by international law, including the United \r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) \r\nand other applicable international instruments, and that \r\ncapacity-building, sharing of data, information and the \r\ntransfer of technology would be crucial elements of the \r\nframework for the regular process. \r\n The United Nations Convention on the Law of \r\nthe Sea provides the basic framework for carrying out \r\nany activity in the oceans and seas, for the use of their \r\nresources and for national, regional and international \r\naction and cooperation to counter threats and \r\nchallenges to the marine environment. We need to take \r\nconcerted action and to adopt integrated approaches to \r\npreserve oceans for future generations. The draft \r\nomnibus resolution (A/64/L.18) rightly recognizes that \r\nthe problems of ocean space are closely interrelated \r\nand need to be considered as a whole through an \r\nintegrated, interdisciplinary and intersectoral approach. \r\nWe thank the coordinator, Ambassador Henrique Valle, \r\nfor his efforts in coordinating this year’s draft omnibus \r\nresolution. \r\n India attaches high priority to the effective \r\nfunctioning of the institutions established under the \r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, \r\nnamely, the International Seabed Authority, the \r\n A/64/PV.57\r\n \r\n27 09-63459 \r\n \r\nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea and the \r\nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf. \r\nThese institutions have made considerable progress in \r\ntheir respective areas of work over the past year. We \r\nclosely follow the work of all these subsidiary \r\ninstitutions. \r\n We congratulate the Chairman of the Commission \r\non the Limits of Continental Shelf for the considerable \r\nprogress made by the Commission in undertaking its \r\nconsideration of the submissions. However, we note \r\nthat since a considerable number of States have made \r\ntheir submissions, it will take a long time for the \r\nCommission to consider those submissions. \r\n We fully share the concerns expressed in the draft \r\nomnibus resolution regarding the projected timetable \r\nof the work of the Commission on the submissions \r\nalready received by it and those yet to be received and \r\nthe significant inequities and difficulties that may arise \r\nfor States as a result of the projected timetable, \r\nincluding with respect to retaining expertise when there \r\nis a considerable delay between the preparation of a \r\nsubmission and its consideration by the Commission. \r\n We hope that the informal working group \r\nengaged in examining this issue will consider and \r\nsuggest short-, medium- and long-term measures to \r\naddress this problem with a view to shortening this \r\ntime frame in a practical and realistic manner. This \r\nwould enable the forthcoming Meeting of the States \r\nParties to consider this issue in a holistic manner and \r\nsuggest practical solutions to address this important \r\nissue. \r\n We support the efforts made by the Secretariat to \r\nstrengthen the capacity of the Division for Ocean \r\nAffairs and the Law of the Sea, which serves as the \r\nsecretariat of the Commission, in order to ensure \r\nenhanced support and assistance to the Commission in \r\nits consideration of submissions. \r\n We are committed to the goal of the protection \r\nand preservation of marine biodiversity, in particular in \r\nareas beyond national jurisdiction. Marine biodiversity \r\nin areas beyond national jurisdiction is threatened by a \r\nnumber of causes such as destructive fishing activities, \r\noverexploitation in vulnerable marine environments, \r\nopen, unregulated access to fisheries, bottom trawling, \r\nbiological prospecting, geo-engineering activities and \r\npollution of the marine environment from various \r\nsources, just to name a few. Coordinated and combined \r\nefforts are required to minimize the harmful effects of \r\nthose activities on the marine environment. \r\n We recognize the need to consider new \r\napproaches within the overall framework of the \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea to promote \r\ninternational cooperation aimed at conservation, \r\nsustainable use of the living resources of the high seas \r\nand benefit-sharing of seabed resources located in \r\nareas beyond national jurisdiction. However, the \r\nparticipation of developing countries in devising and \r\nadopting such approaches greatly depends on the \r\nscientific information and technical know-how \r\navailable to them. Promoting the flow of scientific data \r\nand information and the transfer of technology that \r\nresults from marine scientific research, especially to \r\ndeveloping States, is therefore essential to achieve that \r\nobjective. \r\n Marine scientific research can lead to better \r\nunderstanding and utilization of almost all aspects of \r\nthe oceans and their resources. The research that aims \r\nat exploring the biodiversity of the deep seabed for \r\ncommercially valuable genetic and biochemical \r\nresources should be carried out in accordance with the \r\ngeneral principles of marine scientific research, \r\nnamely, those set out in articles 140, paragraph 1, and \r\n241 of the Convention. \r\n In the area of maritime navigation, we would like \r\nto express our serious concern over piracy and armed \r\nrobbery at sea, particularly off the coast of Somalia. \r\nPiracy not only threatens freedom of the seas, maritime \r\ntrade and maritime shipping security, but also \r\nendangers the lives of seafarers, affects national \r\nsecurity and territorial integrity and hampers the \r\neconomic development of countries in the region. \r\n India is actively cooperating in international \r\nefforts to combat piracy and armed robbery at sea. We \r\nsupport joint and concerted efforts taken by the \r\ninternational community in that regard. As past \r\nincidents have shown, that threat persists, especially \r\noff the coast of Somalia. There is a growing need for a \r\nwell-considered, coordinated course of action in \r\naccordance with international law. There is also a \r\ncontinuing need to assist developing coastal States \r\nthrough capacity-building, including training of law \r\nenforcement officials, transfer of equipment, et cetera, \r\nto enhance their capacities, thus enabling them take \r\neffective action against the threats to maritime security. \r\nA/64/PV.57  \r\n \r\n09-63459 28 \r\n \r\n We also emphasize the importance of the \r\nprinciple of the freedom of navigation, including the \r\nright of innocent passage and transit passage through \r\nstraits used for international navigation. We reaffirm \r\nour view that States bordering straits may adopt laws \r\nor regulations relating to transit passage through the \r\nstraits, but such laws should be enforced in a \r\nnon-discriminatory manner that is fully consistent with \r\narticle 42 of the Convention on the Law of the Sea. \r\n Speaking of fisheries, we take this opportunity to \r\nthank Ms. Holly Koehler of the United States of \r\nAmerica for her skilful and professional coordination \r\nof the informal consultations on the draft resolution on \r\nsustainable fisheries (A/64/L.29). The fisheries sector \r\noccupies an important place in the socio-economic \r\ndevelopment of India. We support increased adherence \r\nto and stronger implementation of the 1995 Fish Stocks \r\nAgreement. \r\n The effective implementation of measures \r\nproposed in resolution 61/105 to combat adverse \r\nimpacts of bottom fishing on vulnerable marine \r\necosystems was an area of particular interest during the \r\nnegotiations on the fisheries resolution this year. We \r\nhope that the additional measures agreed to — which \r\ninclude, inter alia, identification of vulnerable \r\necosystems, assessment of the impact of bottom fishing \r\non such ecosystems, exchange of best scientific \r\ninformation and adoption of conservation and \r\nmanagement measures to prevent adverse impacts on \r\nsuch ecosystems — will help towards regulating \r\nbottom fishing in areas beyond national jurisdiction.  \r\n Mr. Tommo Monthe (Cameroon), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair. \r\n We are pleased to note that the draft resolution on \r\nsustainable fisheries duly recognizes the special \r\ncircumstances and requirements of developing States \r\nand the specific challenges they may face in giving full \r\neffect to their obligations under that resolution. \r\n The most important task before the developing \r\ncountries in the development of their fisheries sector is \r\nto develop and enhance their capacity-building. For \r\nthat purpose they require access to and sharing of \r\nscientific knowledge, resources, technology transfer \r\nand development of skills. In that context we \r\nparticularly support operative paragraph 27 of the \r\nsustainable fisheries resolution, which invites States \r\nand international financial institutions and \r\norganizations to, inter-alia, provide assistance to \r\ndeveloping States to enable them to develop their \r\nnational capacity to exploit fisheries resources, \r\nincluding developing their domestically flagged fishing \r\nfleets, value-added processing and the expansion of \r\ntheir economic bases within the fishing industry. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on agenda item 76 and its \r\nsub-items (a) and (b) for this meeting. The next plenary \r\nmeeting will begin immediately following adjournment \r\nof this one. \r\n \r\nProgramme of work  \r\n \r\n The Acting President: Before concluding the \r\nmeeting, I should like to consult members regarding an \r\nextension for the work of the Second Committee.  \r\n Members will recall that at its 49th plenary \r\nmeeting, held on 20 November 2009, the General \r\nAssembly agreed to extend the work of the Second \r\nCommittee until Friday, 4 December 2009. However, I \r\nhave been informed by the Chairperson of the Second \r\nCommittee that due to ongoing negotiations, the \r\nBureau would like to request an additional extension of \r\nthe Committee’s work until Wednesday, 9 December. \r\nMay I therefore take it that the Assembly agrees to \r\nextend the work of the Second Committee until \r\nWednesday, 9 December 2009? \r\n It was so decided.  \r\n The meeting rose at 6.10 p.m.  \r\n \r\n"
