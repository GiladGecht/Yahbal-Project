(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) \r\n \r\n \r\n In the absence of the President, Mr. Salahuldeen \r\n(Sudan), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 9.05 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Ahmed Abdallah Sambi, \r\nPresident of the Union of the Comoros  \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Union of the \r\nComoros. \r\n Mr. Ahmed Abdallah Sambi, President of the \r\nUnion of the Comoros, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.  \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Ahmed Abdallah Sambi, \r\nPresident of the Union of the Comoros, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly. \r\n President Sambi (spoke in French): I wish to pay \r\ntribute to the President of the General Assembly and \r\nthe Secretary-General for their dedication to their \r\nnoble missions.  \r\n For once, I do not wish to conclude my statement \r\nwith the issue of the Comorian island of Mayotte, as I \r\nusually do. I should like to address that sensitive issue \r\nfirst. It affects not only the unity and integrity of the \r\nComoros and its history and international law, but also \r\npeace in the region of the Indian Ocean.  \r\n The General Assembly has condemned the French \r\npresence on the Comorian island of Mayotte several \r\ntimes, because the Comoros was admitted to the \r\ninternational community with its colonial borders, \r\nwhich include the islands of Mayotte, Anjouan, Moheli \r\nand Grand Comore. Despite many relevant and final \r\nUnited Nations resolutions and several consultations \r\nheld on the island, France continues to hold \r\nreferendums on Mayotte to definitively anchor that \r\nComorian island to the French Republic. Those \r\nconsultations have made it possible to change the \r\nstatus of the Comorian island of Mayotte several \r\ntimes — only within the framework of internal French \r\nlaw — until, through the most recent consultation, the \r\nisland became the 101st French department.  \r\n Moreover, it should be noted that the relations \r\nbetween France and the Comoros are unique. Indeed, \r\ndespite the dispute arising from the separation of one \r\nisland from its three sisters — thus handicapping the \r\nComoros Archipelago by changing it into a three-\r\nlegged cow, as President Ahmed Abdallah Abderemane \r\nsaid — the Comoros, contrary to what one might think, \r\nenjoys a special partnership with France.  \r\n France is present on the Comoros in the sense \r\nthat, in the international community, it is always \r\nassociated with major decisions that affect my \r\ncountry’s future. France remains the primary economic \r\npartner of the Comoros. It is one of the largest \r\ncontributors of development assistance to my country. \r\nMore than 200,000 Comorian citizens live on French \r\nsoil. Those are just a few examples to demonstrate that \r\nno hostility exists between our two peoples or our two \r\ncountries. And we are firmly resolved not only to \r\nA/64/PV.5 \r\n \r\n09-52320 2 \r\n \r\ncontinue that special partnership, but also to reaffirm it \r\neven more.  \r\n However, this desire for harmony in no way \r\nconstitutes a renunciation of our firm attachment to the \r\nterritorial integrity of our country. That is why I have \r\ntaken the initiative to come here to solemnly present to \r\nFrance, before the entire international community, a \r\nproposal to resolve this dispute.  \r\n In fact, I propose to France that it recognize that \r\nthe four islands of the Comoros Archipelago remain an \r\nindivisible nation based on the principle of one \r\ncountry, two administrations. By that principle, I mean \r\nthat France recognizes the full sovereignty of the \r\nUnion of the Comoros throughout its territory while \r\ncontinuing to administer the Comorian island of \r\nMayotte.  \r\n Obviously, both parties must reach agreement on \r\nthe duration of the French presence on the Comorian \r\nisland of Mayotte. On the other hand, we request that \r\nFrance actively assist in the economic development of \r\nthe three other islands to achieve a certain balance \r\nthroughout the Archipelago — a balance that will \r\nnecessarily encourage a harmonious rapprochement \r\namong them and will enable the Comorian island of \r\nMayotte to finally return to its natural home. This \r\nprocess will enable our brothers and sisters of Mayotte \r\nto maintain their social advantages and their standard \r\nof living and the other three islands to rise to the many \r\ndevelopment challenges they face. \r\n I am convinced that with the active participation \r\nof the whole of the international community these new \r\nproposals, which should become part of the \r\nnegotiations between France and the Comoros, would \r\nlead to a happy outcome. France and the Comoros have \r\nnearly two centuries of life together, two centuries of \r\nshared history, culture and language. We do not have \r\nthe right to spoil that patrimony by allowing \r\nmisunderstandings to persist, by continuing to let play \r\nout the tragedies that make of the sea lane between \r\nAnjouan and Mayotte one of the greatest maritime \r\ncemeteries in the world. For all of these reasons we \r\ncome here, in the full view of the world, to \r\ndemonstrate our good will, which we dare to hope will \r\nnever be obliterated by an attitude of inflexibility or \r\nintransigence. \r\n We meet every year in these prestigious \r\nsurroundings to debate questions of peace, security and \r\ndevelopment. Unfortunately, we have to acknowledge \r\nthat our joint efforts do not always lead to conclusive \r\nresults, since as of today numerous challenges remain, \r\nand their consequences for our countries and our \r\npeoples are becoming ever more dire.  \r\n Certainly, some progress can be seen here and \r\nthere, yet our people continue to suffer hunger, \r\nmalnutrition and sickness. Our children do not have the \r\nbenefit of an education of the quality necessary to \r\nassure them a better future. Health care remains a \r\nluxury for most of our citizens. Some of our villages \r\nand even cities suffer a cruel lack of basic social \r\nservices, indeed even of potable water and electricity.  \r\n Finally, many of our countries, particularly small \r\nisland States like my own, are threatened by multiple \r\nnatural catastrophes whose consequences only \r\naggravate an already fragile socio-economic situation. \r\nCertain of our nations are even at risk of no longer \r\nappearing on the map of the world in a few years. That \r\ncatastrophic situation, which prevails in an era when, \r\nparadoxically, every day sees enormous technical and \r\ntechnological advances, must challenge and incite us to \r\nredouble our efforts to find appropriate responses. \r\n Thus a genuine international mobilization — \r\nespecially on the part of those countries most equipped \r\nto face the challenges confronting us all — is required. \r\nWe must take concrete, urgent and concerted action \r\nand make a determined stand against the consequences \r\nof the economic, financial and food crises that lash all \r\nour countries without distinction. \r\n I believe now is the time to demonstrate active \r\nsolidarity and pragmatism if we want our words to \r\ntranslate into concrete actions and if we want to \r\nrekindle hope in our peoples, who have suffered more \r\nthan enough. Obviously our developing nations are not \r\nasking for the moon — at least not for now. We merely \r\nask that we join our efforts to satisfy the legitimate \r\ndemands of our peoples, who only aspire to live better \r\nand with dignity, peace and peace of mind. \r\n Our Organization has a great role to play in the \r\nrealization of that goal, and for its voice to reach as far \r\nas necessary we must all agree on the need to bring to \r\nits various branches the necessary reforms. Indeed, \r\nonly an organization that is more representative, more \r\ndemocratic and more equitable in its various \r\ninstitutions will be in a position to better address the \r\nproblems all countries face, to understand them and \r\nconceive the solutions most likely to produce more \r\npeace, stability and development. \r\n A/64/PV.5\r\n \r\n3 09-52320 \r\n \r\n Furthermore, in the framework of respect for \r\nhuman rights and good international governance, the \r\nabusive use of universal jurisdiction should be fought \r\nby working for a better structure for such jurisdiction, \r\nbut also to put in place an organ to regulate the \r\nprinciple of jurisdiction itself. A better definition of the \r\nconcept of the responsibility to protect should also be \r\nsought, with sufficient time allocated to seriously \r\nconsider its implementation. \r\n Peace and security remain essential conditions for \r\nthe promotion of socio-economic development. Thus \r\nthe conflict conditions that prevail in numerous regions \r\nof the world call out a challenge to us. We must show \r\ngreater solidarity in regard to the populations of \r\nregions that for years on end have known only \r\ndesolation, despair and humiliation. \r\n We should also celebrate the initiative undertaken \r\nby President Barack Obama in the Middle East, which \r\noffers the hope of seeing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict \r\nresolved through a solution that is just, equitable and \r\nacceptable to the parties involved — notably the \r\nsolidification of the two-State principle, as stipulated \r\nby the various United Nations resolutions on the \r\nmatter. \r\n Moreover, I take this opportunity to applaud the \r\npresence among us of His Excellency President Barack \r\nObama, whose charisma, dynamism and sense of \r\njustice renew our hope to see the United States of \r\nAmerica act with more engagement and pragmatism in \r\nthe service of peace, justice and development in the \r\nworld.  \r\n I will not neglect to mention Iraq, Afghanistan, \r\nSomalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Great \r\nLakes region and Darfur, where fratricidal conflicts \r\nonly further exacerbate poverty and underdevelopment. \r\nWe therefore urge the international community to offer \r\nits assistance to those brother countries so as to put an \r\nend to that unfortunate situation. \r\n I cannot close this chapter on crises and conflicts \r\nwithout wishing my Malagasy brothers and sisters \r\ncomplete success in the ongoing negotiations for a \r\npeaceful transition that quickly leads to peace and \r\nstability being restored in this sister island and to \r\nrenewed efforts for its economic prosperity. \r\n Here, I would also like to reiterate the \r\nunwavering support of the Union of the Comoros to the \r\nPeople’s Republic of China and to the Kingdom of \r\nMorocco in their legitimate efforts to recover their \r\nterritorial integrity. \r\n To conclude, I am greatly honoured to express the \r\nwarm thanks and deep appreciation of the Comorian \r\ndelegation to all the American authorities, in particular \r\nthose of the State of New York, for the good \r\narrangements to ensure us a pleasant stay in this great \r\nand beautiful country.  \r\n(spoke in Arabic) \r\n I beseech God that we have a session that serves \r\nhumanity.  \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Union of \r\nthe Comoros for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Ahmed Abdallah Sambi, President of the \r\nUnion of the Comoros, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. John Evans Atta Mills, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Ghana \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nGhana. \r\n Mr. John Evans Atta Mills, President of the \r\nRepublic of Ghana, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. John Evans Atta Mills, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Ghana, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly. \r\n President Mills: I bring very warm greetings \r\nfrom the people of Ghana. Allow me to join previous \r\nspeakers in congratulating the President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-fourth session on his election. \r\nHis long distinguished service to his country and to \r\nAfrica gives us confidence that we are in experienced \r\nand capable hands. I also wish to express my \r\ndelegation’s appreciation to his predecessor, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann, for the \r\nable manner in which he presided over the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-third session.  \r\n Last Monday, 21 September, Ghana celebrated \r\nthe centenary of the birth of an illustrious son of Ghana \r\nand of Africa, our first President, Mr. Kwame \r\nA/64/PV.5 \r\n \r\n09-52320 4 \r\n \r\nNkrumah, under whose leadership Ghana became a \r\nMember of the United Nations on 8 March 1957, only \r\ntwo days after achieving independence. We recall \r\nMr. Nkrumah’s declaration before the General \r\nAssembly on 23 September 1960 that the United \r\nNations was the only organization to hold out any hope \r\nfor the future of mankind. At the same session, he \r\ncalled for the reform of the Security Council in order to \r\nbring it in line with a rapidly changing world. Those \r\nviews were expressed almost 50 years ago, but they \r\nremain relevant.  \r\n Then, as now, Africa faced a deep crisis, with \r\nprofound and far-reaching implications for \r\ninternational peace and stability. Today, the combined \r\neffects of climate change, high food and energy prices \r\nand the current financial and economic crisis threaten \r\nto erode the modest but hard-earned economic growth \r\nand democratic achievements of the past two decades. \r\nAfrica remains volatile, and violent conflicts still \r\npersist. Therefore, it is my humble proposal that we all \r\nsupport the United Nations and its regional allies, such \r\nas the African Union, in living up to those and to the \r\nother pressing challenges facing the international \r\ncommunity.  \r\n While we acknowledge that globalization has \r\nexpanded and accelerated economic interdependence \r\namong States, the truth is that the benefits for many \r\ndeveloping countries have been negligible. Indeed, the \r\neconomies of many developing countries have not been \r\ntransformed in any significant manner. Despite almost \r\na decade of impressive growth of about 5 per cent, only \r\na few countries have been able to reduce the proportion \r\nof their population living on less than $1 per day. \r\nConsequently, most of those countries remain \r\nvulnerable to the various external shocks that continue \r\nto pose threats to their growth. \r\n In fact, over-reliance on high commodity prices \r\nand mineral exports has not lessened, but rather \r\nexposed structural impediments to food security. That \r\nis particularly true of sub-Saharan Africa, where the \r\nongoing world financial and economic crisis threatens \r\nto erode decades of modest growth, and thereby make \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals unattainable in any \r\nmeaningful way.  \r\n Ghana, therefore, reiterates its support for global \r\nintegration that ensures inclusive and equitable \r\ndevelopment and also leads to a substantial reduction \r\nin poverty, including full and productive employment \r\nand broad access to social services. \r\n A number of developing countries have adopted \r\nvarious measures to mitigate the impact of the crisis on \r\ntheir economies, including interest rate reductions, \r\nrecapitalization of financial institutions, trading \r\nreforms, and increased liquidity to banks. Ghana has \r\nalso exercised fiscal restraint in response to the crisis, \r\nby cutting out all low-priority public spending and \r\nshifting the balance from recurrent expenditure to \r\ninfrastructure investment. \r\n In addressing the impact of the crisis on their \r\neconomies, African countries would like to see the \r\nfollowing: rich countries making a greater effort to \r\nmeet existing commitments on aid and debt reduction; \r\nthe acceleration of disbursements and improved access \r\nto existing financial facilities; the International \r\nMonetary Fund (IMF) being urged to put in place a \r\nnew facility with relaxed conditions to help African \r\ndevelopment during this crisis period; a capital \r\nincrease for the African Development Bank to enable it \r\nto scale up its interventions in support of African \r\ndevelopment; the sale of IMF gold reserves to release \r\nmore resources to help African development during \r\nthis period; and finally, the issuance of new Special \r\nDrawing Rights. \r\n International trade carries enormous potential for \r\npoverty reduction and alleviation as well as for driving \r\neconomic growth so that millions of our people can be \r\nlifted out of the quagmire of poverty. The ongoing \r\nDoha Round of trade talks promises, at least in \r\nprinciple, to improve market access for poor countries. \r\nThis commitment, in our view, is very important, \r\nespecially in low-skill and labour-intensive sectors \r\nsuch as garment manufacturing, from where most \r\nAfrican exports come. \r\n Sustained economic growth requires that poor \r\ncountries increase their exports to rich countries. \r\nUnfortunately, the current system of trade \r\ndiscriminates against poor countries, hinders their \r\nparticipation in the global economy and damages the \r\nearning potential and opportunities of rural \r\ncommunities in those countries. \r\n These developments do not work in the interest of \r\nour developing countries. Indeed, trade-distorting \r\nsubsidies, as well as tariff and non-tariff barriers \r\ninstituted by most advanced countries, discriminate \r\nagainst African products. Developing countries, \r\n A/64/PV.5\r\n \r\n5 09-52320 \r\n \r\nincluding Ghana, though we accept that liberalization \r\nis, indeed, required, believe that liberalization must be \r\naccompanied by predictable access to markets, \r\nelimination of the abuse of anti-dumping measures as \r\nwell as the reduction of tariffs and non-tariff barriers. \r\n In the face of all these developments, we in \r\nAfrica acknowledge and recognize that all our efforts \r\nto achieve social and economic development will not \r\nyield much result unless we demonstrate our \r\ncommitment to good governance. In spite of the \r\ndifficulties and challenges, I can say without fear of \r\ncontradiction that, leaders across the continent have \r\nembraced democratic values, except in a few cases \r\nwhere narrow self-interests are threatening the \r\ncommendable gains that we have made in the past \r\ndecade. \r\n We are also confronted with the grave risks to \r\nenvironmental, social and economic development \r\nposed by climate change. The need for concrete, timely \r\nand decisive measures to enable us to deal with this \r\nlargely man-made problem is obvious, and meeting \r\nthat need must not be deferred any longer. \r\n As we proceed to the United Nations Climate \r\nChange Conference scheduled for December 2009 in \r\nCopenhagen, the issue of financing mitigation and \r\nadaptation to climate change in developing countries \r\nwill remain central to the deliberations. In fact, \r\nprogress on these issues will be crucial in determining \r\nany outcome in Copenhagen. \r\n The intrinsic link between security and \r\ndevelopment has been generally recognized by the \r\ninternational community. Despite the pivotal role \r\nplayed by the United Nations in identifying the threats \r\nconfronting the international community and \r\nmarshalling the necessary international support to deal \r\nwith those challenges, humanity’s hope and aspiration \r\nfor a peaceful and prosperous world are weakened by a \r\nlitany of unfulfilled promises and failures. \r\n Rather than being discouraged by these \r\nshortcomings, we in Ghana are unwavering in our \r\nconviction that, though daunting, the challenge to the \r\ncommunity of nations could be surmounted through \r\ninnovative, bold, and achievable measures. \r\n Peacekeeping operations have played a pivotal \r\nrole in the Organization’s efforts to fulfil its core \r\nmission of maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity. Ghana, as one of the oldest and most \r\nconsistent troop-contributing countries, deems it a \r\nmatter of privilege and honour to be associated with \r\nthis success story of our Organization. We equally \r\nacknowledge that increasing demands have placed \r\nfurther strain on an overstretched system. \r\n It is for this reason that we applaud and renew \r\nour support for the reform process that is in place and \r\nalso acknowledge the fruitful dividends that have come \r\nout of it, even though we admit that much more needs \r\nto be done if we are to achieve our objectives.  \r\n Ghana cannot but commend the growing \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional \r\norganizations. We call for its intensification to enable it \r\nto take advantage of the cooperative strength of the \r\nUnited Nations and regional organizations in a \r\nmutually complementary manner. \r\n Next year marks the fifteenth year since the \r\nadoption, at the Fourth World Conference on Women, \r\nof the 1995 Beijing Platform for Action. In view of the \r\nhuge gap between policy and practice and the \r\nunyielding progress in implementing that international \r\nconvention on gender equality and the empowerment \r\nof women, it is our suggestion that we need to take a \r\ncoherent, integrated and multisectoral approach to this \r\nproblem. \r\n Over the years, Ghana has demonstrated its \r\ncommitment to implementing in an accelerated manner \r\nthe goals of the Beijing Platform for Action, and we \r\nhave done so by adopting concrete administrative, \r\nlegal and constitutional means. Our efforts have \r\nyielded some measure of success, as clearly testified to \r\nby the appointment of our first female speaker of \r\nparliament, the first female attorney-general, and quite \r\na number of female ministers and deputy ministers.  \r\n At its sixty-third session, the General Assembly \r\nadopted resolution 63/194, urging us to improve our \r\nefforts and join the international initiative against \r\nhuman trafficking and for the protection of victims. We \r\nin Ghana concur with those who view the elaboration \r\nand adoption of a United Nations global plan of action \r\nas an effective and practical way to give life and effect \r\nto the international initiative against this despicable \r\ncrime. It is our expectation that the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fourth session will make \r\nthis an urgent and priority issue. I can assure him of \r\nGhana’s commitment and support. \r\nA/64/PV.5 \r\n \r\n09-52320 6 \r\n \r\n In conclusion, I note with regret that conflicts, \r\nparticularly in the developing world, have robbed us of \r\nan opportunity to improve the circumstances of our \r\npeoples. Indeed, it is well known that sustainable \r\ndevelopment can only be achieved in an international \r\nenvironment characterized by peace and stability. \r\n We in Ghana therefore want to take this \r\nopportunity to renew our commitment to the ideals of \r\nthe United Nations and to fulfil our Charter obligations \r\nby joining together with other Member States to assist \r\nthe United Nations in playing its role in the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and stability and in \r\nthe promotion of fruitful international cooperation. We \r\nare convinced that the United Nations remains the ideal \r\nmultilateral instrument for achieving international \r\npeace and security and promoting fruitful international \r\ncooperation. I would therefore want all of us to \r\nstrengthen our resolve and muster the necessary \r\npolitical will to assist the United Nations to more \r\neffectively discharge its obligation to redeem our \r\npeoples from war, disease and poverty. \r\n We in Ghana have pledged to build a better \r\nGhana. We therefore want to assist the United Nations \r\nto build a better world. May God bless us in all these \r\nefforts. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Ghana for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. John Evans Atta Mills, President of the \r\nRepublic of Ghana, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Željko Komšić, Chairman of \r\nthe Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Chairman of the Presidency of \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. \r\n Mr. Željko Komšić, Chairman of the Presidency \r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Željko Komšić, Chairman \r\nof the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly. \r\n Mr. Komšić (spoke in Bosnian; English \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): It is a great \r\nhonour for me to address the General Assembly today \r\nin my capacity as the Chairman of the Presidency of \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. At the very outset, allow me \r\nto congratulate the President of the Assembly at its \r\nsixty-fourth session and the other members of the \r\nBureau on their election, and to express our full \r\nsupport to their future work. Furthermore, I would like \r\nto congratulate His Excellency Mr. Miguel d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann, whom I met on several occasions, on the \r\nresults achieved during his presidency of the sixty-\r\nthird session of the General Assembly at a time when \r\nthis body and the international community in general \r\nwere facing an array of challenges related to pressing \r\nglobal issues.  \r\n Sessions of the General Assembly have always \r\nserved as opportunities for leaders of States to gather \r\nand exchange their opinions about the situation in the \r\nworld with the aim of finding the most suitable \r\nsolutions for current global issues. The United Nations, \r\nlike other organizations, depends upon the collective \r\nstrength of its Members; that strength needs to be \r\nbased on consensus among Member States. One of the \r\nmost pressing issues that has marked the past year is \r\nthe global economic and financial crisis, which has \r\nbecome the biggest threat to global peace and stability. \r\nIf we miss the opportunity to tackle its negative effects \r\nimmediately, it could produce unimaginable \r\nconsequences throughout the world. \r\n Even though there are indicators which show that \r\nrecession in developed countries is slowly abating, it is \r\nevident that recovery will be slow and time-consuming. \r\nWith regard to the developing and less developed \r\ncountries, we can only imagine the harmful \r\nconsequences that this crisis could produce in the times \r\nahead. It is more than obvious that countries cannot \r\ncombat these crises on their own, regardless of the \r\nefficiency of their Governments. Global crisis requires \r\nglobal solutions.  \r\n Ms. Koirala (Nepal), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n We welcome the adoption of the outcome \r\ndocument of the recent high-level Conference on the \r\nWorld Financial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on \r\nDevelopment (resolution 63/303, annex). The \r\nConference confirmed once again that the role of the \r\nUnited Nations — and especially of the General \r\n A/64/PV.5\r\n \r\n7 09-52320 \r\n \r\nAssembly, as one of the most democratic of forums — \r\nis to lead this process and find new modalities for \r\nimprovement of cooperation with the aim of \r\nestablishing effective mechanisms for preventing crises \r\nand alleviating and eliminating their consequences, as \r\nwell as for eradicating poverty and establishing social \r\njustice in the world. \r\n It is accurate to say that the present global \r\neconomic crisis — the severest since the establishment \r\nof the United Nations — has heavily compromised and \r\neven jeopardized the attainment of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, one of the noblest tasks set by the \r\nOrganization since its foundation. This applies in \r\nparticular to the poorest countries, and especially to \r\nsub-Saharan African countries that had failed to \r\nachieve positive results even before the onset of the \r\ncrisis. I stress that besides the responsibility borne by \r\nthose countries pertaining to their activities in \r\nestablishing good governance and the rule of law, \r\nwhich are prerequisites for achieving the \r\naforementioned development goals, a huge \r\nresponsibility lies with the developed countries. \r\n It is exactly the developed countries that are \r\nexpected to do everything in their power in order to \r\novercome the global economic crisis. We think that \r\nduring the crisis it is necessary to reform the global \r\nfinancial system and make it more transparent, to \r\ndevelop mechanisms for market monitoring and thus to \r\navoid the mistakes that occurred in the period prior to \r\nthe current decrease in the global GDP.  \r\n State institutions in my country — Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina — have made systematic efforts to \r\naccomplish the Millennium Development Goals, and \r\nwe believe that other than the difficulties caused by \r\nglobal economic volatility, there possibly will be no \r\nother obstacles in the context of finalizing the defined \r\ntasks by 2015. At the moment, Bosnia and Herzegovina \r\nis preparing a development strategy and a social \r\ninclusion strategy. The anti-poverty strategy was \r\ndrafted earlier and has been implemented. Such \r\nprojects have been carried out in cooperation with \r\nrelevant United Nations agencies in Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina, and I wish to take this opportunity to \r\nexpress my gratitude for that intensive cooperation. \r\n Climate change is one of the key issues that \r\nrequire an urgent response from the international \r\ncommunity. Bosnia and Herzegovina aspires to end the \r\nyear 2009 with successful completion of international \r\nnegotiations on climate change. Furthermore, we hope \r\nthat the Copenhagen summit will produce an \r\nagreement that outpaces the Kyoto Protocol and that it \r\nwill gain the support of the United Nations Member \r\nStates.  \r\n However, it is not only island countries that are \r\naffected by this problem. It is a universal challenge and \r\nthreat. Humanitarian catastrophes caused by weather \r\nconditions that have affected parts of our planet over \r\nrecent years should serve as a warning to all of us. \r\nNeither economic nor political interests must be \r\nallowed to obstruct the achievement of a global \r\nconsensus as the true beginning of a global struggle to \r\nprevent the loss of the natural balance of our planet. \r\n All of us gathered here today agree that \r\nconsensus and comprehensive reform of the United \r\nNations system is necessary and that it ought to be \r\ncarried out in a careful, prudent manner that ensures \r\nthe broadest consensus of the Member States. United \r\nNations reform should result in efficient and \r\ncoordinated functioning of all bodies of the system. \r\nHowever, a widely accepted perspective is that the \r\nreform of the Security Council is of key importance for \r\nsubstantive reform of the entire system of the world \r\norganization.  \r\n I am convinced that the majority agree with me \r\nthat Security Council reform ought primarily to result \r\nin better transparency of that body and its activities and \r\nshould provide for a considerably larger spectrum of \r\nnon-member States to participate in its work. That \r\napplies in particular to countries that are most on the \r\nCouncil’s agenda, countries that are directly affected \r\nby a particular crisis, as well as countries that could \r\nuse their expertise or experience gained in similar \r\nsituations that contribute to following the best and \r\nmost acceptable solutions. \r\n We all have to be aware that any further delay in \r\nSecurity Council reform will undermine the credibility \r\nof that body, whereas the willingness to reach a \r\ncompromise must be an imperative. Dialogue and \r\ncompromise are the only way to ensure the broadest \r\npossible support for reforms.  \r\n Bosnia and Herzegovina is of the opinion that \r\nSecurity Council reform should urgently commence. In \r\nany case, we believe that in the future reformed \r\nCouncil, the group of Eastern European countries must \r\nhave another non-permanent seat, considering that the \r\nA/64/PV.5 \r\n \r\n09-52320 8 \r\n \r\nnumber of countries in that group has more than \r\ndoubled in the last two decades. \r\n I wish to emphasize that I expect the Council to \r\nengage more strongly in preventive diplomacy. We \r\nbelieve that taking that new course of action would \r\nmean that many issues and crises could be solved \r\nbefore they become aggravated, thus increasing the \r\nCouncil’s efficiency. Ensuring timely and efficient \r\nconflict prevention, rather than reacting once a crisis \r\nhas already escalated, is a more efficient and less \r\nexpensive method for preserving peace and security. \r\n Unfortunately, armed conflicts remain the reality \r\nof our world, and those most in danger are the poorest \r\npeoples and nations, who are left to fend for \r\nthemselves. Therefore, it is necessary to foster \r\nadditional United Nations early warning mechanisms \r\nand establish multiple sources of information in order \r\nto create a true picture of the situation and at the same \r\ntime strengthen countries’ abilities to resist enticements \r\nthat lead to genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and \r\ncrimes against humanity. \r\n Bosnia and Herzegovina remains committed to \r\nfull cooperation with the International Criminal \r\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, since those \r\nindicted for war crimes in the former Yugoslavia must \r\nbe prosecuted. Meanwhile, a legal framework has been \r\nset up in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the Court of \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina has begun to prosecute war \r\ncrimes. That is one of the requirements for building \r\nmutual confidence and reconciliation in post-conflict \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. \r\n The number of refugees has been growing daily \r\naround the globe, but less effort and fewer means are \r\ndevoted to finding a concrete solution to this global \r\nissue. We in Bosnia and Herzegovina are well \r\nacquainted with the destiny, pain and suffering of \r\nrefugees, and thus we urge maximum effort to \r\nsystematically resolve the global refugee crises. We \r\nsupport the joint and continued endeavours of all \r\nUnited Nations agencies and the non-governmental \r\nsector that directly deal with this problem. We are \r\nwilling to offer cooperation in every aspect. \r\n With regard to United Nations peacekeeping \r\nmissions, we believe that, with foresight and \r\nconsidering the best practices, each crisis has to be \r\ncarefully examined, taking into consideration all its \r\ncauses, if we are to find a sustainable and justifiable \r\nsolution. We believe that there are no universal \r\nsolutions applicable to every crisis, to the requirements \r\nof each particular case. \r\n Various cultures and traditions have coexisted in \r\nthe Balkans for centuries. We are willing to share both \r\nour positive and negative experiences in the post-\r\nconflict peacebuilding aspect.  \r\n The foreign policy of Bosnia and Herzegovina is \r\naimed at preserving and improving long-lasting peace, \r\nsecurity and stability, democratic and comprehensive \r\nsocial development and contributions to international \r\npeace and stability. \r\n The presence, participation and actions of small \r\ncountries in the decision-making process of the \r\nSecurity Council are of great importance in \r\nmaintaining balance within the Council. However, \r\napart from the views of the permanent members and \r\nworld Powers, the Council needs to encourage smaller \r\ncountries to present their views and participate in the \r\ndecision-making process of that body, which in some \r\nways represents global government. That is one of the \r\nreasons why we decided, after careful consideration \r\nand for the first time in our history, to run for a \r\nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council for the \r\nperiod 2010-2011. Bosnia and Herzegovina, which has \r\nbeen the main topic of numerous debates of the \r\ninternational community, today wants to have the \r\ncapacity to actively participate in and contribute to the \r\nwork of the Security Council.  \r\n As a small but multi-ethnic, multinational and \r\nmultireligious country with a rich historic heritage, \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina is conversant with a plethora \r\nof sociopolitical systems and cultural and historical \r\ncontexts. Bosnia and Herzegovina is willing to share its \r\nexperience in peacebuilding in a post-conflict situation, \r\nparticularly in the area of confidence-building among \r\nmulticultural communities, and thus actively contribute \r\nto better understanding and long-term reconciliation in \r\nsuch regions.  \r\n Today, Bosnia and Herzegovina actively \r\nparticipates in the work of international organizations, \r\nespecially the work of the United Nations. It has been a \r\nmember of the Human Rights Council since June 2007, \r\nand within the Council’s framework it has been \r\nworking on promoting and protecting human rights \r\nthroughout the world. Since 2000, members of the \r\narmed forces and police forces from Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina have been equal participants in United \r\nNations international military and police missions in \r\n A/64/PV.5\r\n \r\n9 09-52320 \r\n \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, \r\nEritrea, Liberia, Sudan, East Timor, Cyprus and Haiti, \r\nthus contributing to the preservation of international \r\npeace and stability. Furthermore, it supports \r\ninternational efforts to stabilize the situations in Iraq \r\nand Afghanistan. \r\n Finding a solution to the Middle East crisis \r\nremains one of the priorities of the world Organization. \r\nWe believe that positive momentum ought to be used in \r\nthe best possible manner to establish equitable and \r\ncomprehensive peace in this region. After so many \r\nyears of suffering, bloodshed, tension, mutual \r\nmisunderstanding and conflict, we must support the \r\nlatest activities of the Quartet members, as well as \r\nregional initiatives aimed at taking the crucial step \r\nforward leading to sustainable peace, which implies \r\ncreation of a sovereign, independent and self-\r\nsustaining Palestinian State. \r\n Bosnia and Herzegovina has been closely \r\nfollowing the situation in Africa. We expect that \r\ndespite the hard-hitting global economic crisis, the \r\nworld’s most developed countries will continue to \r\nincrease the percentage of their gross domestic product \r\nthat they contribute to official development assistance \r\nand to contribute the other expertise necessary for \r\nstrengthening the capacities of poor African countries. \r\nWe therefore welcome the efforts by the United \r\nNations through the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment intended to lead Africa to stable and \r\nsustainable development and to fulfil the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals.  \r\n This particularly relates to sub-Saharan countries. \r\nWe support the efforts of the African Union, African \r\nGovernments, the United Nations, the United Nations \r\nOffice for West Africa and other regional initiatives \r\ndesigned to improve the rule of law and democracy and \r\nto strengthen capacities of civil society and \r\ninstitutions, and thus to upgrade all aspects of social \r\nlife. We underline the importance of the continued \r\nprovision of material aid for Africa, as well as \r\nimproved use of these resources towards sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Nowadays, when political and social processes \r\nare more dynamic than ever and we are facing \r\nchallenges quite opposite from those of several decades \r\nago, it has become more obvious that only a strong, \r\nmultilateral approach can provide the right answers. \r\nThe United Nations has faced numerous challenges, yet \r\nit remains the only path leading to a better future and \r\nthe only Organization able to offer adequate solutions \r\nto the array of global issues we are facing. If we work \r\ntogether to implement the conclusions reached here at \r\nthis high-level event, we will undoubtedly live in better \r\nand more equitable conditions than is the case today. \r\n Bosnia and Herzegovina is willing to fully \r\ncontribute to the work of the United Nations. I would \r\nlike to express my gratitude to all Member States who \r\nsupported Bosnia and Herzegovina and who are willing \r\nto elect my country as a non-permanent member of the \r\nSecurity Council for the period 2010-2011. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Chairman of the \r\nPresidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Željko Komšić, Chairman of the Presidency \r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina, was escorted from \r\nthe General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Paul Kagame, President of the \r\nRepublic of Rwanda  \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nRwanda. \r\n Mr. Paul Kagame, President of the Republic of \r\nRwanda, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Paul Kagame, President of \r\nthe Republic of Rwanda, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly. \r\n President Kagame: This session of the General \r\nAssembly offers further opportunity to reflect on how \r\nbest to reconcile what at times mistakenly appears to \r\nbe irreconcilable: socio-economic development and a \r\nhealthy environment. Leaders, experts and citizens the \r\nworld over ask how we can grow our economies and \r\nspread prosperity to more of the world’s citizens, yet \r\nnot degrade our oceans, rivers and the air we breathe? \r\n But these are also times of extraordinary \r\nscientific, technological and business innovations that \r\ncan help address those challenges, if we have the \r\ncourage to put into proper perspective and indeed \r\nharmonize our national, regional and global priorities.  \r\nA/64/PV.5 \r\n \r\n09-52320 10 \r\n \r\n History is replete with illustrations of how \r\nnations immersed in crises changed the underlying \r\nassumptions by which they acted, created new \r\ninstitutions and tools to solve problems and emerged \r\nfrom the process as stronger societies. While those \r\ninnovations are always different, the challenges to \r\nsurmount the crises are always the same: forging a \r\nshared vision, increasing the social capital required to \r\nenhance predictability, having trustful relations \r\nbetween peoples, being receptive to doing things in \r\nnew ways and adopting an explicit moral purpose in \r\norder to achieve common goals. \r\n We have an exceptional opportunity to \r\nsimultaneously address our environmental challenges, \r\nimprove our economies and reform our global \r\nmultilateral institutions for better global governance. \r\nFor example, the Group of Twenty (G-20) is now \r\nplaying a crucial role in restoring global economic \r\nstability. But should we not even broaden the base to \r\ninclude many nations that are most vulnerable to the \r\ndecisions of the few? All nations should be part of \r\nthose important discussions and decisions, because \r\nthey have valuable contributions to make. This is the \r\ntime to embrace true multilateralism.  \r\n We in developing nations appreciate the \r\ncorrective measures taken by the G-20 and the Group \r\nof Eight to accelerate global economic recovery. But it \r\nis evident that most of their proposals fall short of the \r\nconcrete steps needed to address challenges that are \r\nspecific to low-income countries. \r\n Multilateralism has always been the key tenet in \r\nforging a fairer international community based on \r\nequitable global governance. The United Nations itself \r\nis based on that very sound and tested principle, and \r\nthat should be the practice. The rise of worldwide \r\nnetworks of trade, industry, prosperity and social \r\nvalues, together with the creation of multilateral \r\ninstitutions to guide and harmonize those processes, \r\nhas no doubt contributed to a fairer and improved \r\nglobal decision-making system. That is what needs to \r\nbe rendered more inclusive. \r\n Improving global governance has also to address \r\ninternational justice. International justice should be fair \r\nto all — rich and poor, strong or weak. We are all \r\npleased to note that at its sixty-third session the \r\nGeneral Assembly undertook to examine \r\ncomprehensively the issue of universal jurisdiction. We \r\nlook forward to the resolutions on that matter during \r\nthe Assembly’s current session.  \r\n It is also fitting that we recognize the recent \r\ncreation of a single entity within the United Nations to \r\nadvance the work on women’s rights and gender \r\nequality. Rwanda has always made that one of its \r\npriorities and has achieved good results.  \r\n With regard to socio-economic challenges in our \r\nEast African Community region, we are making \r\nprogress in key areas. For instance, we are preparing to \r\ninaugurate, in January 2010, the East African Common \r\nMarket to facilitate greater trade, investment and the \r\nfree movement of almost 130 million people. We \r\nbelieve that there is no better strategy for mitigating \r\neconomic difficulties than building larger regional \r\nmarkets that bring about improved productivity, which \r\nincreases purchasing power and, in turn, strengthens \r\nour societies. \r\n With regard to the global environmental \r\nchallenge, this session of the General Assembly \r\nprovides an important platform for preparing for the \r\nCopenhagen climate change summit. Every nation \r\nshould have co-equal status and be considered a \r\nconcerned nation at the forthcoming summit. That \r\nimplies that each nation has both rights and obligations \r\nand should be open to burden-sharing according to its \r\nability. This is the time to address in a timely fashion \r\nsuch key issues as how much the industrialized \r\ncountries are to reduce their emissions of greenhouse \r\ngases, how much the developing countries are to limit \r\nthe growth of their emissions, and how to finance and \r\nsupport strategies to conserve energy, mitigate risk and \r\nbuild green technologies that counteract the impact of \r\nclimate change in the developing world. \r\n We in Rwanda have been making a modest but \r\nproportionate contribution by, among other things, \r\nhosting African preparatory meetings for the \r\nCopenhagen summit in order to encourage a strong and \r\nessential African voice at that critical meeting. We \r\nhave also been actively implementing national \r\nenvironmental policies for reforestation, terracing and \r\nthe rehabilitation of wetlands that supply lake and river \r\nsystems in our country, to name a few areas in which \r\nwe have had good results. \r\n On the matter of peace and security, the world \r\nfaces a number of regional threats. The Great Lakes \r\nregion has its share of peace and security problems, but \r\nwe continue to make significant progress in \r\n A/64/PV.5\r\n \r\n11 09-52320 \r\n \r\nfundamentally addressing that question. The leaders of \r\nthe region recognize that, most crucially, home-grown \r\nsolutions, beginning with a joint regional effort, can \r\nbring about sustainable peace. It is in that context that, \r\ntogether with our colleagues and neighbours in the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, we are dealing \r\nwith the root cause of instability in our area, namely, \r\nthe negative forces that have been a menace since \r\n1994. \r\n If history teaches us anything, it is that we cannot \r\napply the same strategies to different problems and \r\nexpect satisfactory outcomes all the time. We have to \r\nthink differently on the fundamental questions, \r\nincluding the urgent imperatives of, first, strengthening \r\nthe future of all nations by fostering economic growth \r\nand development while investing in the environment. \r\nThat should be our moral purpose. Secondly, we must \r\nimprove peace and stability in all regions by learning \r\nfrom, and supporting, legitimate regional actors. \r\nFinally, we must engage and embrace the majority \r\nworld in terms of multilateralism in decision-making, \r\ntrade and prosperity.  \r\n These should be our shared vision. Future \r\ngenerations will then know how leaders of nations in \r\nthe year 2009, immersed in crises, focused on the most \r\ndifficult challenges, including the global economic \r\ncrisis, climate change and greater peace and security, \r\nand how they acted with resolve. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Rwanda for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Paul Kagame, President of the Republic of \r\nRwanda, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\n  Address by Ms. Dalia Grybauskaitė, President \r\nof the Republic of Lithuania \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nLithuania. \r\n Ms. Dalia Grybauskaitė, President of the \r\nRepublic of Lithuania, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations Her Excellency Dalia Grybauskaitė, President \r\nof the Republic of Lithuania, and to invite her to \r\naddress the Assembly. \r\n President Grybauskaitė: Today the international \r\ncommunity is striving to meet challenges that the \r\nfounders of the United Nations could not have \r\nenvisioned some 65 years ago. At the same time, the \r\nfounding principles of the United Nations have not \r\nchanged. The provision of joint security and prosperity \r\nand the safeguarding of human rights remain the \r\nimpetus for United Nations activities as they were \r\n60 years ago. Countries that gather here, big and small, \r\nhave a common responsibility as members of the \r\nUnited Nations to uphold and cherish the ideals \r\nexpressed in the United Nations Charter.  \r\n The global financial and economic crisis is not \r\nthe only problem today. Terrorism, the proliferation of \r\nweapons, energy challenges, climate change and many \r\nother issues must be addressed in order to make the \r\ngoals of the United Nations a reality. Complex \r\nchallenges require comprehensive responses. It is \r\nobvious we cannot benefit from isolationist or egoistic \r\npolicies. \r\n The United Nations must come of age. It must \r\nbecome the visible and credible expression of the \r\nglobalization of politics. The modern world dictates \r\nthat we are dependent on each other. Either we work \r\nwith each other or suffer in isolation.  \r\n Today more than ever before, the United Nations \r\nhas to play the leading role in strengthening our \r\nsocieties by promoting the shared values of humanity \r\nand tolerance. It is our responsibility to make sure that \r\nsuch phenomena as anti-Semitism, xenophobia and \r\nracism are eliminated from our lives. There can be no \r\nexcuse for not bearing this responsibility. Countries big \r\nand small alike have duties not only towards their own \r\ncitizens but also towards global society. But it is \r\nusually the poor and vulnerable who suffer the most, \r\nespecially as the current crisis and the lag in donor \r\ncommitments push back the hopes of implementing the \r\nMillennium Development Goals on schedule. \r\nTherefore, with all due regard for the domestic \r\nconcerns and needs of national taxpayers, we need to \r\nadapt to the reality of global complexity and to respect \r\nour common responsibility and international \r\ncommitments. We need to make sure that the \r\nMillennium Development Goals do not become the \r\nprime victims of the current global economic and \r\nfinancial situation.  \r\nA/64/PV.5 \r\n \r\n09-52320 12 \r\n \r\n What particular steps should be taken? I will \r\nmention several. First, recent United Nations peace \r\noperations show that efforts to achieve and consolidate \r\npeace entail many dimensions, ranging from \r\npeacebuilding to nation-building. Despite its current \r\neconomic limitations my country is determined to meet \r\nits obligations. We will contribute to peace-keeping \r\nmissions and operations working to ensure global \r\nsecurity and stability, specifically by continued \r\nparticipation in the European Union missions in \r\nKosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Afghanistan. \r\n Second, the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and \r\nbiological weapons will never be halted unless there is \r\nan international consensus to do so. The United \r\nNations must strengthen its policy against \r\nproliferation; in particular we need to find ways to \r\nallow nations to develop civil nuclear power but not \r\nnuclear weapons. Therefore the upcoming Review \r\nConference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons next year will provide a good \r\nopportunity to seek diplomatic solutions and work for \r\nfull compliance with international commitments and \r\nrequirements. \r\n Third, better and more responsible governance at \r\nthe global, regional and local levels is crucially \r\nimportant for a steady and sustainable economic \r\nrecovery. Protectionism and isolationism have never \r\nworked and will never work in the future.  \r\n Fourth, realizing the fact that global climate \r\nchange calls for global solutions, we will do our best to \r\nreach an international consensus at the Climate Change \r\nConference in Copenhagen. Fully aware of the global \r\nimpact of climate change, we support the ambitious \r\nEuropean Union commitment to cut carbon dioxide \r\nemissions by 20 per cent by 2020, within the \r\nframework of an international agreement. \r\n Fifth, I think that global responsibility has to be \r\naddressed regionally as well — this is the rule for \r\neffective implementation of the United Nations \r\nCharter. Regional organizations should assume a \r\ngreater responsibility for taking care of their regions. \r\nThey must share their best practices with their \r\nneighbours and other regional organizations. \r\n Aware of being a comparatively small State, \r\nLithuania is assuming its regional and global \r\nresponsibility to promote United Nations values \r\nthrough the core principles of dialogue, respect, \r\nunderstanding and tolerance, as it assumes the \r\npresidencies of regional and global organizations. \r\nLithuania began its one-year presidency of the Council \r\nof the Baltic Sea States as well as the presidency of the \r\nCommunity of Democracies on 1 July 2009, and it will \r\ntake on the chairmanship of the Organization for \r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe in 2011. A \r\nLithuania representative will then assume the yearly \r\npresidency of the United Nations General Assembly in \r\nSeptember 2012 and will complete that term as \r\nLithuania takes on the European Union presidency in \r\nthe second half of 2013.  \r\n It is an immense responsibility to guide the \r\nCommunity of Democracies forward at this point in \r\ntime. In our view, real progress in development is \r\nlinked directly to the institution of democratic norms \r\nand principles. We believe democracy to be inseparable \r\nfrom peace, the rule of law, respect for individual and \r\nhuman rights, equal opportunity and overall prosperity.  \r\n Allow me to reiterate that small or less developed \r\nStates can no longer avoid global responsibility and \r\nthat all of us are responsible for our common present \r\nand future. Let us all recognize from now on, in each \r\nof our capitals, that the global interest is our national \r\ninterest and global responsibility is our national \r\nresponsibility. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Lithuania for the statement she has just made. \r\n Ms. Dalia Grybauskaitė, President of the \r\nRepublic of Lithuania, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Dimitris Christofias, President \r\nof the Republic of Cyprus \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nCyprus. \r\n Mr. Dimitris Christofias, President of the \r\nRepublic of Cyprus, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Dimitris Christofias, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Cyprus, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly. \r\n A/64/PV.5\r\n \r\n13 09-52320 \r\n \r\n President Christofias (spoke in Greek; English \r\ntext provided by the delegation): I would like to extend \r\nto Mr. Ali Treki my sincere congratulations on his \r\nelection as President of the sixty-fourth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly of the United Nations. I would also \r\nlike to express my appreciation for the excellent work \r\ndone by his predecessor, Mr. Miguel d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann. I should also like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his comprehensive report (A/64/1) on the \r\nwork of the Organization, as well as to congratulate \r\nhim on his initiative in convening the high-level \r\nClimate Change Summit. \r\n Since its independence, the Republic of Cyprus \r\nhas been committed to multilateral diplomacy and the \r\nstrengthening of the role of the United Nations. World \r\nstability and welfare have been threatened by the \r\nrecent global economic crisis. The crisis revealed the \r\nweaknesses of our collective oversight systems. It is \r\nonly through collective international action, and not \r\nthrough economic nationalism, that we can overcome \r\nsuch challenges. The same is true of action against \r\ndisease and poverty, as well as the prevention of \r\nfurther damage to the environment, which affects the \r\nlives of us all. \r\n The most important lesson to be learned from the \r\nfinancial crisis is that the economy cannot be seen in \r\nisolation from the needs of society. Despite the \r\nremarkable development of production forces that \r\ncould have secured decent living conditions for all, \r\npeople in many parts of the world are still deprived of \r\nbasic needs such as drinking water, health care and \r\naccess to education and work. The magnitude of the \r\nfinancial crisis shows that it is a crisis of the system \r\nand of its most extreme manifestation, namely, \r\nneo-liberalism and market lawlessness. In its present \r\nform, globalization is not the realization of the vision \r\nof philosophers and social revolutionaries for global \r\nbrotherhood and prosperity for all. That is because \r\nglobalization is driven by the pursuit of excessive \r\nprofits. As a result, the rich are becoming richer and \r\nthe poor poorer. \r\n More than half way to the 2015 deadline for the \r\nattainment of the Millennium Development Goals, the \r\nfinancial crisis is forcing States and institutions to \r\nreassess global priorities. The United Nations is the \r\nmost important international body able to tackle the \r\neffects of the global financial crisis and to act \r\ncollectively and effectively to prevent their most dire \r\nconsequences. \r\n The world today faces multiple challenges and \r\nthreats, including climate change, the depletion of \r\nresources, human rights abuses, the failure to protect \r\nvulnerable populations, increased regional and \r\ninter-State conflict, the proliferation of weapons of \r\nmass destruction and pandemics. From this rostrum, we \r\nhave heard the desperate voices of those who live on \r\nsmall-island States, the despairing appeal of young \r\npeople and the dramatic warnings of scientists about \r\nclimate change. If we do not take measures now, we \r\nface the risk of extinction. We join our voice and lend \r\nour support to the proposals for taking concrete action. \r\nWe must take measures now. Tomorrow will be too \r\nlate. The December meeting in Copenhagen must \r\nbecome a historic turning point in effectively \r\naddressing catastrophic climate change. \r\n Since its independence, the Republic of Cyprus \r\nhas relied on the principles of the United Nations in \r\nmaintaining its independence, its sovereignty and its \r\nterritorial integrity. After the dual crime of a military \r\ncoup and the foreign invasion of Cyprus in 1974, when \r\nmilitary forces attempted to obliterate our statehood \r\nand violated the integrity of our State, the United \r\nNations responded with a number of important \r\nresolutions that expressed the international \r\ncommunity’s moral and legal support for the Republic \r\nof Cyprus. The plethora of Security Council and \r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions on Cyprus provided my \r\ncountry with the necessary support to continue its \r\nstruggle for a solution to its political problem on the \r\nbasis of those resolutions, the principles of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations and international law. \r\n Shortly after my election to office, I undertook \r\nthe initiative of bringing the stalemate to an end. As a \r\nresult of that, and on the basis of the relevant Security \r\nCouncil resolutions and under the auspices of the good \r\noffices mission of the Secretary-General, a year ago we \r\nembarked upon intensive negotiations with the leader \r\nof the Turkish Cypriot community, Mr. Mehmet \r\nAli Talat.  \r\n Trusting in the sincerity of Mr. Talat’s intentions, \r\nwe have engaged in a common effort to bring an end to \r\nthe division of our country. We agreed that the process \r\nwould be in the hands of Cypriots, without arbitration \r\nor artificial timetables. Some progress has been \r\nachieved in the negotiations, but not such as to make us \r\nconfident that we are close to a final solution to the \r\nCyprus problem. Our goal is the restoration of the \r\nsovereignty, territorial integrity, independence and \r\nA/64/PV.5 \r\n \r\n09-52320 14 \r\n \r\nunity of the Republic of Cyprus, the common \r\nhomeland of Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots. It is \r\nalso our goal to restore the human rights and basic \r\nfreedoms of all citizens of the Republic of Cyprus, \r\nregardless of their ethnic background. \r\n We are committed to the evolution of the unitary \r\nState into a federal State consisting of two largely \r\nautonomous regions. One region will be administered \r\nby the Greek Cypriot community and the other by the \r\nTurkish Cypriot community. The fact that the \r\npopulation of Cyprus lived intermingled throughout the \r\nisland constituted for us a great historical concession \r\non the part of the late President Makarios to our \r\nTurkish Cypriot compatriots. We remain true to that \r\ncommitment. The united federal republic of Cyprus \r\nmust safeguard the unity of the State and its \r\ninstitutions, as well as of the economy and the people. \r\n Unfortunately, despite our common efforts, the \r\nTurkish Cypriot side, supported by Turkey, continues \r\nto present positions and proposals that take us outside \r\nthe framework of the United Nations resolutions on \r\nCyprus with regard to the termination of military \r\noccupation, the illegal possession of properties and the \r\npresence of settlers. Acceptance of those positions \r\nwould lead to acceptance of many consequences of the \r\noccupation and to violations of international \r\nconventions on human rights, basic freedoms and the \r\nprinciples on which federations are built. It is clear that \r\nsuch a solution would be neither viable nor functional \r\nand would not ensure the continuing unity of the State \r\nand the country. \r\n We sincerely hope that during the second round \r\nof negotiations, which has just started, the Turkish \r\npositions will be reconsidered so that we can, as soon \r\nas possible, reach an agreed solution that we can then \r\npresent to the people in separate simultaneous \r\nreferendums. That solution must be by the Cypriots for \r\nthe Cypriots. It is clear that we will not present to the \r\npeople a solution that originates from outside, nor can \r\nwe accept arbitration or pressure being exercised \r\nthrough artificial timetables.  \r\n Those preconditions were agreed with the \r\nSecretary-General, under whose auspices the \r\nnegotiations are taking place. I would like to take this \r\nopportunity to thank once again the Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon, for his good offices mission and for \r\nthe role of the United Nations as a facilitator in the \r\nnegotiating process. \r\n After the 1974 invasion and the occupation of \r\n30 per cent of the territory of the Republic of Cyprus, \r\nTurkey has become a key player in the solution of the \r\nCyprus problem. The success of our efforts towards a \r\nsolution of the problem depends on Turkey’s political \r\nwill and on the policies that it implements. It is not \r\nenough for the Turkish leadership to publicly state that \r\nit supports the negotiating process. \r\n Turkey should contribute in a practical way to a \r\nsolution that seeks a bizonal and bicommunal \r\nfederation with political equality, as defined in the \r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions. Instead, Turkey \r\npursues a confederal solution. A measure of goodwill \r\non the part of Turkey would have been the \r\nimplementation of Security Council resolution \r\n550 (1984), which stipulates the transfer of the \r\noccupied ghost town of Varosha to the administration \r\nof the United Nations and the return of its legal \r\ninhabitants to their homes and property. In addition, \r\nTurkey should proceed with normalizing its relations \r\nwith the Republic of Cyprus and with recognizing it, as \r\nstipulated in the decisions of the European Union. \r\n I ask if it is not a paradox for a country that is a \r\nmember of the Security Council not to recognize the \r\nRepublic of Cyprus, a State Member of the United \r\nNations, of the European Union and of all international \r\norganizations. Is it not a paradox for a member of the \r\nSecurity Council to keep occupation troops on the \r\nterritory of another United Nations Member State and a \r\nmember State of the European Union for 35 years? Is it \r\nnot a paradox to undermine the unity and the territorial \r\nintegrity of the Republic of Cyprus by promoting the \r\ncreation of a second State on the island in violation of \r\nSecurity Council resolution 541 (1983), which \r\nunanimously condemns the illegal unilateral \r\ndeclaration of independence, calling it null and void, \r\nand calls on all States to respect the sovereignty, \r\nindependence and territorial integrity of the Republic \r\nof Cyprus? \r\n Yes, it is a paradox, and it is also illegal. Cyprus \r\nhas never sought, nor wishes, to have hostile relations \r\nwith its neighbour, Turkey, but it is our responsibility \r\nto defend the independence, territorial integrity and \r\nsovereignty of our State. \r\n Nevertheless, before this body, I would like to \r\nexpress my readiness to initiate dialogue with the \r\nTurkish leadership, in parallel to our negotiations with \r\nTurkish Cypriot leader, and to share ideas on a future \r\n A/64/PV.5\r\n \r\n15 09-52320 \r\n \r\nthat would greatly enhance the possibility of a positive \r\noutcome to the negotiations. Cyprus has consistently \r\nsupported Turkey’s accession to the European Union in \r\nthe belief that the entire adaptation process and \r\nTurkey’s eventual membership would benefit our \r\nneighbours, our region and us. However, that support is \r\nnot unconditional. Turkey should fulfil its obligations \r\ntowards the Republic of Cyprus and towards the \r\nEuropean Union. \r\n I would like to state once again that our Turkish \r\nCypriot compatriots are equal citizens of the Republic \r\nof Cyprus and that I personally will consistently strive \r\nfor their rights and for finding their rightful place in all \r\norgans of the State. My political roots are in the \r\nprogressive people’s movement of my country, which \r\nhas always stood by our Turkish Cypriot compatriots \r\nfor peace and harmonious coexistence.  \r\n Nevertheless, the rights of our Turkish Cypriot \r\ncompatriots cannot be implemented at the expense of \r\nthose of the larger community, which is the Greek \r\nCypriot one. There must be mutual respect. I want to \r\naffirm that I will spare no effort in order to achieve a \r\nbalanced and just solution that would restore the rights \r\nof the people as a whole.  \r\n We have all paid a heavy price — human, \r\npolitical and economic — and continue to do so. The \r\ngains of lasting peace will benefit the people of \r\nCyprus, of Turkey and of our region as a whole. True \r\npolitical leaders are not those who think of the next \r\nelection, but of the next generation. We have the \r\nresponsibility to work together to achieve a lasting \r\npeace in our region. \r\n I wish the family of the United Nations a \r\nsuccessful outcome to the deliberations of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-fourth session. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Cyprus for the statement he has just made. \r\n  Mr. Dimitris Christofias, President of the Republic \r\nof Cyprus, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Fradique Bandeira Melo de \r\nMenezes, President of the Democratic Republic \r\nof Sao Tome and Principe \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of Sao \r\nTome and Principe. \r\n  Mr. Fradique Bandeira Melo de Menezes, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Sao Tome and \r\nPrincipe, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Fradique Bandeira Melo de \r\nMenezes, President of the Democratic Republic of Sao \r\nTome and Principe, and invite him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\n President De Menezes (spoke in Portuguese; \r\nEnglish interpretation provided by the delegation): \r\nBefore anything else, allow me to congratulate His \r\nExcellency Mr. Ali Treki of Libya, a country with \r\nwhich we maintain excellent relations of brotherhood, \r\nfor his election to the important post of President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fourth session, which \r\nrole he will certainly carry out with his usual level of \r\nexcellence. I would also like to congratulate His \r\nExcellency Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann for his \r\nexcellent work on the world economic crisis during his \r\npresidency at the sixty-third session. \r\n A year has passed since the opening of the \r\nAssembly’s sixty-third session, and yet we have still \r\nnot recovered from the full effects of the global \r\neconomic crisis, despite enormous efforts on the part of \r\ndeveloped countries. The same distortions in the \r\nworld’s economy remain.  \r\n But it is not just economic and financial problems \r\nthat we face. Our biggest challenge today is \r\nguaranteeing the future of our planet, not just in the \r\neconomic sense, but also resolving climate change \r\nissues that threaten the very survival of small island \r\nnations like Sao Tome and Principe. Though our carbon \r\nemissions are insignificant and our forests play a key \r\nrole as part of the world’s lungs, rising sea levels are \r\nalready causing coastal erosion around our country. \r\n Time is no longer on our side but has become our \r\nunforgiving judge. There is no time for more \r\nunfounded justifications for the non-fulfilment of the \r\nKyoto Protocol. We cannot continue evading these \r\nA/64/PV.5 \r\n \r\n09-52320 16 \r\n \r\nessential environmental issues, which are not a \r\nquestion of developing countries against developed \r\nones. We need urgent measures that are global and \r\nconcrete to save us from this crisis. \r\n The report of the Secretary-General on the work \r\nof the Organization (A/64/1) contains some important \r\npoints to which we have given considerable attention, \r\nbecause my country shares similar concerns. I am \r\nreferring to the urgent need for reform of the United \r\nNations system. Africa, especially its small countries \r\non the periphery, continues mired in the deepest \r\npoverty. Our problems are particularly difficult to solve \r\ndue to a combination of adverse factors that deserve an \r\napproach from the international community that is \r\nmore systematic, more diligent and more coordinated. \r\n There have been several crises in 2009, and we \r\nhave to re-think together the future of the new world \r\neconomic order. Those crises affect all countries and \r\ndemand a global response. Sao Tome and Principe is a \r\nmicro-State with a micro-economy, and thus it is poor \r\nand vulnerable. As such, it is not immune to the effects \r\nof those crises. \r\n We need to reinforce the merits of multilateralism \r\nas an instrument through which the international \r\ncommunity can promote peace and development. \r\nTherefore, Sao Tome and Principe wants to \r\ndemonstrate its support for the institutionalization of \r\nthis agenda within the framework of the United \r\nNations. In a world confronting a global economic and \r\nfinancial crisis, along with the negative impact of \r\nclimate changes, there is a need to guarantee food \r\nsecurity and energy security, to deal with migrations \r\nand pandemics and numerous regional conflicts of \r\nincreasing complexity and associated risks.  \r\n The only way we can face these crises is through \r\nactive multilateralism, based on international law and \r\non the principles of the United Nations Charter, and \r\nthrough reaffirming our commitment to achieving the \r\ngoals set out in the United Nations 2005 World \r\nSummit. We are well aware that we will achieve those \r\ngoals only through a renewed multilateral system, \r\nintegrated in a world organization that is stronger, \r\nmore egalitarian and with more solidarity. \r\n In this framework we call for support for the oft-\r\nrepeated proposal for reforming the United Nations \r\nsystem, and particularly the issue of permanent \r\nmembers of the Security Council. We believe that this \r\nissue cannot be endlessly put off. There must be more \r\njustice in the context of the United Nations. The \r\nAfrican States must have a voice and cannot be ignored \r\nin this process of reform of our Organization. That is \r\nwhy I want to state my complete agreement with what \r\nwas said from this tribune yesterday, at the \r\n3rd meeting, by the President of the African Union, our \r\nbrother-leader Qadhafi, reclaiming better participation \r\nby the African countries as permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council.  \r\n We are beginning the last five years in the \r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). The past five years have presented us with \r\nthe biggest challenges facing global society: poverty, \r\npandemics, environmental degradation — everything \r\nthat galvanized the world’s position that was translated \r\ninto the declaration that we heard yesterday. The goals \r\nand hopes that this declaration embodies need \r\nattention. I can say that in Sao Tome and Principe we \r\nhave made determined efforts, especially to achieve the \r\nGoals in the areas of health and education. We are \r\nalmost there, although we are yet not completely \r\nsatisfied. \r\n The biggest debates related to global warming \r\nconcentrate on substitutions for fossil fuels in order to \r\nreduce carbon emissions that contribute to the \r\ngreenhouse effect. This debate has gone on as \r\ntemperatures have risen, causing the glaciers and polar \r\nice caps to melt, which in turn has already caused a rise \r\nin the sea level. As I mentioned earlier, that is \r\nthreatening our country. \r\n These environmental changes present a strategic \r\nchallenge for countries, with increasing global \r\ninsecurity caused by the effects of violent storms, \r\ndroughts, massive migrations and pandemics, which \r\nlead to an increase in poverty, environmental \r\ndegradation and weakening national Governments. \r\nExperts in this field call our attention to the fact that \r\nthese climate changes may result in an unprecedented \r\nneed to provide emergency food aid, which could cause \r\na crisis of sustainability for the international \r\ncommunity.  \r\n The negotiations in the framework of the United \r\nNations are aimed at creating a substitute for the 1997 \r\nKyoto Protocol, which establishes limits on greenhouse \r\ngas emissions by 2012 for 37 countries in the \r\ndeveloped world and is an attempt to profoundly alter \r\nthe world climate situation. \r\n A/64/PV.5\r\n \r\n17 09-52320 \r\n \r\n We hope the 2020 objectives can be formalized \r\nduring the Copenhagen summit. Even in the meetings \r\nthis week, at the Assembly’s current session, we have \r\nseen growing concern on the part of the international \r\ncommunity, at the level of the Secretary-General and in \r\nthe Alliance of Small Island Developing States, with \r\nregard to the success of this process. \r\n Whenever I speak before the General Assembly, I \r\nconclude by mentioning two continuing cases of \r\ninjustice: that of the Republic of China on Taiwan and \r\nthat of the trade embargo against Cuba.  \r\n Despite everything, there are positive signs on the \r\ninternational scene, for which we are grateful. We \r\nwelcome the recent positive developments between the \r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan and the People’s \r\nRepublic of China. We continue to support increased \r\nparticipation at the United Nations for the Republic of \r\nChina on Taiwan. In that regard, we welcome the \r\nadmission of that nation of 23 million people as an \r\nobserver at the World Health Organization. We hope \r\nthat other United Nations agencies, such as the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \r\nand the International Civil Aviation Organization, can \r\nalso take advantage of the valuable contributions that \r\nthat developed country can make with respect to the \r\nurgent needs of the Organization. \r\n Unfortunately, however, while we can express a \r\ncertain satisfaction concerning the issue of the \r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan, we cannot do so with \r\nregard to the trade embargo against Cuba; indeed, we \r\nare greatly disappointed in that area. But we dare to \r\nremain hopeful that the new United States \r\nAdministration will have the courage and \r\ndetermination to shortly address this issue in the same \r\nmanner as it has dealt with that of Guantánamo.  \r\n  Mr. Parham (United Kingdom), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair. \r\n \r\n I wish to stress that the road ahead of us is very \r\ndifficult and long. There must be global cooperation in \r\na context of availability and responsibility to ensure \r\nsustainable development for all countries. I therefore \r\nappeal for greater cooperation between donor and \r\nbeneficiary countries and greater consultation not only \r\nwith Government institutions, but also with institutions \r\nmore familiar with the needs of people on the ground. I \r\nam referring specifically to rural communities, \r\nteachers, doctors, nurses, farmers, fishermen and all \r\nthose in the productive sectors of our countries.  \r\n For the Government and the people of Sao Tome \r\nand Principe, the United Nations remains an \r\nindispensable Organization where there should be no \r\ndifferences among Member States. The United Nations \r\nmust continue its mission of maintaining peace and \r\nsecurity and promoting international development. \r\nThose are the Organization’s objectives to ensure the \r\nbetterment of our world. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n  Mr. Fradique Bandeira Melo de Menezes, \r\nPresident of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome \r\nand Principe, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Ernest Bai Koroma, President \r\nof the Republic of Sierra Leone \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nSierra Leone. \r\n  Mr. Ernest Bai Koroma, President of the Republic \r\nof Sierra Leone, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Ernest Bai Koroma, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Sierra Leone, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly. \r\n President Koroma: I feel highly honoured to \r\naddress the Assembly once again. I would like to start \r\nby congratulating Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his \r\nassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-fourth session and to assure him of my \r\ndelegation’s support and cooperation as he performs \r\nthe demanding task of presiding over our deliberations. \r\nThrough him, I would also like to convey my sincere \r\ngratitude to His Excellency Monsignor Miguel \r\nd’Escoto Brockmann for the efficient and effective \r\nmanner in which he conducted the previous session. In \r\naddition, my appreciation goes to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his comprehensive account of the work of \r\nthe Organization and his analysis of the challenges \r\nfacing the global community. \r\n The theme for this year’s session is apt and \r\ntimely. It is only through dialogue among the various \r\nA/64/PV.5 \r\n \r\n09-52320 18 \r\n \r\ncivilizations of the world represented in this \r\ndeliberative body and the strengthening of the \r\ninstitutions and architecture responsible for promoting \r\nsuch dialogue that we can effectively meet the \r\nchallenges posed by the current global crisis. Dialogue \r\npromotes understanding; understanding enhances \r\ncooperation; and cooperation gives vitality and \r\nlegitimacy to the institutions and mechanisms that have \r\nbeen structured to meet our common challenges and \r\ngoals. \r\n Civilizations began as magnificent blueprints for \r\nmeeting challenges that were specific to particular \r\nregions of the world, but advances in technology and \r\ncommunications have made problems no longer \r\nspecific to particular regions. Climate change; the \r\nHIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and swine flu pandemics; the \r\nfood and fuel crises, including the present global \r\neconomic meltdown; terrorism; nuclear proliferation; \r\nand drug trafficking are all beyond the capacity of any \r\nof the world’s civilizations to tackle without \r\ninternational cooperation. While the major causes of \r\nthose challenges may arise from particular regions, \r\ntheir impacts are global and affect the lives and \r\nfortunes of peoples of all civilizations. Dialogue \r\namong civilizations will create the synergies required \r\nto tackle the causes and impacts of the global crises. \r\n My Government fully subscribes to and supports \r\nthe promotion of dialogue, as well as the facilitation of \r\nmechanisms that will help to ameliorate the impact of \r\nthe global crises. Among some population groups, that \r\nimpact may be on the size of their bonuses; among \r\nothers, it may be on whether they acquire a second car \r\nor not. But for the vast number of people — \r\nparticularly in Africa — the impact of the crises is \r\ncreating life-threatening situations.  \r\n Years of conflict had increased the number of \r\npoor and vulnerable people in my country. However, \r\nstable economic growth, remittances and international \r\nfinancial and security support were increasing \r\nprospects for ameliorating the situation, but the present \r\nglobal crisis has suddenly decreased those prospects, \r\npushing greater numbers of our people into extreme \r\npoverty. \r\n We in Sierra Leone are saddled with the effects of \r\ntrade imbalances in international commerce. Our \r\neconomy continues to be vigorously challenged by the \r\nfalling prices of our exports in the international market. \r\nThis includes diamonds and cash crops. The effect of \r\nthis intractable problem is that we are not able to \r\ngarner enough foreign exchange to meet the basic \r\nimport requirements for our sustenance. We are on the \r\nthreshold of the tenth year of the implementation of the \r\nMillennium Declaration and yet the prospects for \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 \r\nremain dismal for Africa. \r\n Many countries in Africa, including mine, have in \r\nthe last few years registered important improvements \r\nin the essential areas of governance and economic and \r\nsocial indicators. My country, Sierra Leone, is putting \r\nin place mechanisms to ensure a stable democratic \r\nregime. Worldwide indicators show that we have made \r\nextremely fast progress in political stability. Our \r\neconomic growth remains strong at 6 to 9 per cent. My \r\nGovernment has firmed up the aspirations of our \r\npeople in an Agenda for Change that sets out four clear \r\npriority areas: agriculture, energy, infrastructure and \r\nreforms to improve delivery of health and education \r\nservices. We are already delivering results in our \r\npriority areas. Key roads are under construction, we \r\nhave completed a hydroelectric project that is \r\nsupplying clean, affordable power to Freetown for the \r\nfirst time, and our reforms have ensured that we are the \r\nbest performer among neighbouring countries \r\naccording to the Doing Business Index. \r\n My Government could not sustain these results \r\nwithout multilateral support. On 18 and 19 November \r\nof this year, we are organizing a Consultative Group \r\nMeeting on Sierra Leone in London to dialogue with \r\ninvestors, donors and other partners, and to mobilize \r\nsupport for our efforts in tackling the many challenges \r\nfacing our country. We see the Sierra Leone conference \r\nas a problem-solving dialogue; we aspire to a \r\nconference that will build an action-oriented \r\nmultilateral framework for meeting the challenges we \r\nface. My country believes in multilateralism; we \r\nbelieve in dialogue among nations as the most effective \r\nmeans of tackling our problems. We call upon all \r\ncountries to ensure that the current financial crisis does \r\nnot deny the many African nations only recently \r\nremoved from violent conflict the security and prospect \r\nof prosperity that we have all worked so hard to \r\nachieve. \r\n I would like to address another issue my \r\ndelegation takes very seriously, one that is interwoven \r\nwith the financial crisis, poverty and development — \r\nthe serious threat that climate change poses to human \r\ndevelopment in general and African nations in \r\n A/64/PV.5\r\n \r\n19 09-52320 \r\n \r\nparticular. Despite the scientific consensus that the \r\nearth is warming at an alarming rate, progress in \r\nreducing greenhouse-gas emissions and limiting global \r\nwarming to below an increase of 2 degrees Celsius \r\nper year has proved elusive. Today, the poorest nations, \r\nwhich contribute the least to the phenomenon, are the \r\nmost vulnerable. The recent torrential rainfall in \r\nFreetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, left scores of \r\npeople dead, homeless or seriously injured. Drought, \r\nhurricanes, floods, changing rainfall patterns, rising sea \r\nlevels and low crop yields rank high among the key \r\nchallenges facing the world’s poor. Unfortunately, \r\nthose nations with the least resources are the most \r\nunprepared for such challenges. \r\n It is our obligation to reverse the alarming rate of \r\nenvironmental destruction and depletion of our natural \r\nresources. It is in this regard that I wish to reiterate \r\nAfrica’s common position on climate change, which, \r\namong other things, urges developed countries to cut \r\ngreenhouse-gas emissions by 40 per cent. This is \r\ncertainly not an ambitious goal. It is the least that we, \r\nthe most vulnerable, deserve. \r\n We believe that in addition to the necessity of \r\ninvesting in clean development mechanisms, the \r\nworld’s developed countries must take a leadership \r\nrole, providing adequate and predictable financial and \r\ntechnical support for less developed countries to foster \r\neffective adaptation as well as mitigation measures. We \r\nshare the Secretary-General’s vision that the Climate \r\nChange Summit in Copenhagen represents a unique \r\nand powerful opportunity at a critical moment in \r\nhuman history to steer humankind towards a safer, \r\nmore stable and more sustainable future. \r\n A final threat critical to the future stability of \r\nnations around the world is the increasing proliferation \r\nof small arms and light weapons, which, as former \r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan recently emphasized, \r\nare tantamount to weapons of mass destruction in slow \r\nmotion, capable of destabilizing countries and entire \r\nregions. Given that many African countries routinely \r\nface political instability and violent threats, we need to \r\nstrengthen the national, regional and subregional \r\nconflict-resolution mechanisms through which it \r\nbecomes possible for Africa to control small weapons. \r\nPeace and development can be achieved in Africa, in \r\npart, by exploration of the peace and security \r\narchitecture evolving within the African Union, the \r\nEconomic Community of West African States, the \r\nSouthern African Development Community and the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission. \r\n Against this background, I wish to reiterate that \r\ncollaborative efforts among members of the \r\ninternational community are crucial to addressing our \r\nglobal problems, and that international support remains \r\ncritical for the consolidation of hard-won gains by \r\nnations emerging from war. It is our hope that the \r\nUnited Nations and our development partners will \r\ncontinue to be our steadfast allies in our ongoing \r\nstruggle for economic progress and development. In \r\nthis regard, I urge that we continue to forge enhanced \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nAfrican Union, as well as subregional organizations, \r\ncooperation that goes beyond rhetoric and translates \r\ninto concrete efforts. \r\n As I intimated before the Assembly at the sixty-\r\nthird session, we have come a long way, thanks to \r\nmultilateral and bilateral efforts in favour of our \r\nsurvival as a nation. The ongoing peacebuilding \r\nefforts, spearheaded by the United Nations \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, continue to strengthen the \r\npeace-consolidation process in the country. I am \r\npleased to announce that, in return and in a spirit of \r\nreciprocity, Sierra Leone has joined the ranks of the \r\ntroop-contributing countries of United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations. \r\n Multilateralism is vital for international \r\ncooperation and for responding to global crises. In the \r\nbid to promote effective multilateralism, my \r\nGovernment has continued to urge the international \r\ncommunity to effect various reforms aimed at \r\nstrengthening our intergovernmental organizations, \r\nincluding the Bretton Woods institutions, with a view \r\nto making them more inclusive, transparent and \r\ndemocratic in their decision-making processes.  \r\n An effective, legitimate and democratic United \r\nNations cannot be achieved without a true reform of \r\nthe Security Council. The ongoing intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on the question of equitable representation \r\non, and increase in the membership of, the Security \r\nCouncil and other matters relating to the Council have \r\nprogressed through three informal plenary rounds at \r\nthe last session of the General Assembly. We in Africa \r\nhave consistently demanded that the historical injustice \r\nthat is rooted in our underrepresentation and \r\nnon-representation in the non-permanent and \r\npermanent categories of the Council be addressed \r\nA/64/PV.5 \r\n \r\n09-52320 20 \r\n \r\nwithout any further delay. It is in this respect that we \r\nhave continued to negotiate in good faith and mutual \r\ntrust. I am hopeful that the outcome of these \r\nnegotiations will lead to a meaningful reform of this, \r\nthe principal decision-making organ of the United \r\nNations in the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity. We in Africa stand ready, willing and \r\nprepared, as always, to resume negotiations during this \r\nsession. \r\n Let us promote multilateralism and strengthen our \r\ncollaborative efforts to contain the rising threats to our \r\nplanet. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Sierra Leone for the statement he has just made. \r\n  Mr. Ernest Bai Koroma, President of the Republic \r\nof Sierra Leone, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Ricardo Martinelli Berrocal, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Panama \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nPanama. \r\n  Mr. Ricardo Martinelli Berrocal, President of the \r\nRepublic of Panama, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Ricardo Martinelli \r\nBerrocal, President of the Republic of Panama, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Martinelli Berrocal (spoke in \r\nSpanish): The people of Panama welcome the very \r\nsound decision to elect Mr. Ali Treki to serve as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its current \r\nsession. We are sure that he possesses the vision and \r\nthe leadership to guide the nations represented here \r\ntoday. \r\n I should also like to thank the Secretary-General \r\nfor his tireless pursuit of dialogue in the interests of \r\npeace, security and the peaceful coexistence of peoples \r\nand brothers. \r\n Yesterday saw the conclusion of the Summit on \r\nClimate Change. I congratulate all nations for their \r\ncollaborative efforts in confronting the global-warming \r\ncrisis. The beauty, resources and biodiversity of our \r\nshared heritage are in peril. \r\n Global warming is the most serious symptom of a \r\ncrisis caused by the excessive exploitation of \r\nresources. We must apply new formulas, change our \r\nbehaviour and learn to value our relationship with \r\nnature. Our options are clear: we can talk or we can \r\nact. If we do not act with global responsibility, the \r\nconsequences will be irreversible.  \r\n Three million years ago, the Isthmus of Panama \r\nemerged from the sea. We are one of the youngest \r\ncountries on Earth. As a result of our birth, a land \r\nbridge was formed between North and South America \r\nand constituted the narrowest stretch of land between \r\nthe Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Panama parted the \r\nseas to unite continents, and generated a new global \r\nnetwork of ocean currents that transformed the climate \r\nof the entire planet. The whole world changed when \r\nPanama came into being. \r\n Today, all forms of life upon this planet are the \r\nresult of an evolutionary process that adapted to our \r\nbirth. The great African savannahs and deserts came \r\nforth from these changes, and modern man evolved \r\nfrom those new savannahs. \r\n Panamanians have always played an important \r\nrole for our neighbours and for the world at large. In \r\nthe next five years, it is our duty to demonstrate how \r\nour economic and governmental model can serve as an \r\nexample for all who aspire to prosperity and progress. \r\n I am an entrepreneur, not a politician. I went into \r\npolitics to change how things are done. I am a simple \r\nand direct man. I believe that time is very short and \r\nvery valuable. I will expand upon my experiences in \r\nthe private sector and put them to work in the public \r\nsector. \r\n I was elected to the presidency with an \r\nunprecedented mandate. Panamanians gave me a clear \r\nmandate to deliver change to our country and build a \r\nbetter Panama for all. We are placing the interests of \r\nthe people first and foremost, above personal or \r\npartisan interests, because a country is more important \r\nthan a political party.  \r\n I have selected the best people to work in our \r\nGovernment without regard to their political \r\naffiliations. I have plans for the nation. We want \r\ncapitalism which is based on opportunities and rewards \r\nresponsible entrepreneurs who show solidarity, but \r\n A/64/PV.5\r\n \r\n21 09-52320 \r\n \r\ncapitalism which also strongly demands responsibility \r\nand solidarity from any old-fashioned entrepreneurs \r\nwho do not satisfy those two criteria.  \r\n We formed this Government during a crisis. Less \r\nthan a year ago, we saw the collapse of the \r\ninternational financial framework. The global \r\neconomic model was forever changed. Our guiding \r\nlight is the improvement of our peoples’ quality of life. \r\nThat is why, during the first 100 days, we increased the \r\nsalaries of all public officials and distributed $100 per \r\nmonth to senior citizens over the age of 70 who do not \r\nhave a pension and require economic aid.  \r\n We will be building a modern new metro in \r\nPanama, and it will be the largest employment \r\nprogramme in the history of the country after the \r\nexpansion of the canal currently under way. \r\n We have launched a construction project for low-\r\ncost housing which will not only provide a safe roof \r\nover the heads of thousands of Panamanians, but will \r\ngenerate jobs at difficult times during a crisis.  \r\n The promises we have made meet the demands of \r\nour people. But beyond that, they are part of the plan \r\nwe need to boost our economy.  \r\n America is a recently populated continent, and \r\nPanama was the bridge across which the first native \r\nAmericans crossed to South America. They built great \r\ncultures and civilizations such as those of the Incas and \r\nthe Chibchas. When the Spanish arrived, they made our \r\ncountry into the commercial hub of their colonies. \r\nWhen Panama separated from Spain, the first railroad \r\nin the world between the Atlantic and the Pacific was \r\nbuilt, and that in turn led to the construction of our \r\ncanal. Today, Panama is the gatekeeper of the global \r\neconomy. \r\n We are a small country, with less than 3.5 million \r\ninhabitants, and services represent more than 75 \r\nper cent of our gross national product. The United \r\nStates dollar is our currency. We have a solid banking \r\nand financial centre which is very conservative and \r\nstrictly regulated. The Colón Free Zone is the largest in \r\nthe hemisphere, thanks to the most important \r\ncommercial maritime route in the world, and this \r\nmakes us the most efficient logistical hub in the \r\nAmericas.  \r\n We shall soon begin the construction of a third set \r\nof locks to expand the capacity of the Panama Canal, \r\nthereby opening an important gateway for international \r\ntrade.  \r\n Panama is an ideal place to invest, to establish \r\nenterprises and also to live. We will be transforming \r\nPanama into the Hong Kong or the Dubai of the \r\nAmericas. Within the new Panama-Pacific Special \r\nEconomic Area, labour and immigration laws are \r\nwelcoming and flexible. Throughout our national \r\nterritory, there are fantastic incentives for investors. \r\nOur spirit of service and open door policy make \r\nPanama an enjoyable, exciting place of true \r\nopportunities.  \r\n And despite the crisis Panama is growing. Talent \r\nand creativity, social assistance, infrastructure and \r\ninvestment in human capital will allow us to weather \r\nthe storm.  \r\n Panama was born to serve the world. Everyone is \r\nmore than welcome in Panama. We are open for \r\nbusiness. \r\n We believe in free trade as a tool to improve \r\npeople’s lives. We want to do business with all nations \r\nand have signed free trade agreements with our \r\nstrategic partners. We have already signed one with the \r\nUnited States. To be ratified, it just needs one small \r\n“push”, and I believe that President Obama will deliver \r\nthat push very shortly. \r\n In Panama, we are proud of our history and our \r\nheritage, our freedom of expression and thought, our \r\nfreedom to determine our country’s direction, and our \r\ntradition of peace.  \r\n Peace is the best sentiment that any country or, \r\nindeed, the whole planet can have. Peace brings with it \r\ntranquillity, stability and growth. There is absolutely \r\nno reason why neighbouring peoples should offend one \r\nanother, because no one wins and we all lose. The \r\nchildren of Bolívar share the same history and the same \r\nchallenges. We have the same blood in our veins. We \r\nare a single nation. Here, anyone who attacks, attacks \r\nonly himself. Anyone who retaliates, retaliates against \r\nhimself. Anyone who bears arms does so against \r\nhimself. Because here we are all siblings. \r\n Weapons of war bring poverty. They steal the \r\nbread from our mouths and the future from our \r\nchildren. These weapons are not necessary, and at the \r\nend of the day they solve nothing. Let us sit down \r\ntogether, for there is nothing that we cannot solve \r\ntogether. There is nothing like peace. And peace is \r\nA/64/PV.5 \r\n \r\n09-52320 22 \r\n \r\nwhat all countries of the world should be pursuing until \r\nit is achieved. \r\n I would like to talk here about our sister country \r\nof Honduras, and the need for it to return to the rule of \r\nlaw, which is necessary for its well-being and that of \r\nCentral America. That is why we are closely following \r\nthe reconciliation in Honduras.  \r\n The San José accord constitutes the best method \r\nfor formulating a consensus Government that can \r\noversee new elections and guarantee a peaceful return \r\nto democracy. Let us allow the Honduran people to \r\nsolve their destiny and future with one another. We \r\nPanamanians have the utmost trust in the Honduran \r\nsociety’s capacity for reconciliation. \r\n Nothing is stronger than words, either spoken or \r\nwritten, and through dialogue we understand one \r\nanother, to paraphrase the poet. Communication is the \r\nbest conduit for cultures, education, ethnicities, history, \r\nreligions and politics. In Panama, we are a melting pot \r\nof races, nationalities and ideologies that, through \r\ncommunication and mutual respect, has created a \r\ndiverse society with common interests. That is part of \r\nour idiosyncrasy and is what makes us who we are.  \r\n Tolerance is the secret to the coexistence of \r\npeoples. Nuclear tests make us all nervous, and living \r\nin a state of alert only serves to increase tensions \r\nbetween nations whose relations are already less than \r\nstable. That is why we live in constant fear and \r\nmistrust, which has a significant impact on dialogue \r\nbetween us. \r\n In Panama, we respect the use of science as a tool \r\nfor human development, but we reject its use as a front \r\nto conceal nuclear proliferation and the production of \r\nweapons of mass destruction.  \r\n A challenge to global peace and security lies in \r\nthe war on drug trafficking, money-laundering and \r\narms trafficking. Because it is a crossroads, Panama is \r\nused by organized crime for drugs and arms trafficking. \r\nBut we are declaring our own war. We have become an \r\nactive partner with Mexico and Colombia in the battle \r\nagainst narco-terrorists. Alongside President Uribe and \r\nPresident Calderón, we are committed to strengthening \r\nthe ties of cooperation, so that Panama can be an active \r\nsource of intelligence.  \r\n The many efforts and improvements that Panama \r\nhas achieved in this field have been recognized in \r\nreports by the Financial Action Task Force on Money \r\nLaundering and the International Monetary Fund. \r\nPanama has information exchange agreements with \r\n39 countries to combat money-laundering and the \r\nfinancing of illicit activities. \r\n Drugs are not good business. Those who dedicate \r\nthemselves to them are destined to jail or the cemetery. \r\nThey have no future. \r\n Mr. Nasheed (Maldives), Vice-President, took the \r\n Chair. \r\n Everyone knows Panama as a banking centre, as a \r\nplace to do business, and because of our canal. But in \r\nfact, we are nature’s best-kept secret in the world. \r\nTourism is our new passion. Panama City has the \r\nhighest concentration of migratory birds on the planet. \r\nWe are the hub for America’s flying species. The Gulf \r\nof Chiriquí has the greatest biodiversity of any spot in \r\nthe eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. Forty percent of our \r\nnational territory is protected. This includes over \r\n1.5 million hectares of uninterrupted forests between \r\nChagres and Darién. \r\n Our national parks have been declared biosphere \r\nreserves and world heritage sites, as has the island of \r\nCoiba, a natural jewel where they are still discovering \r\nnew species and where whales from the Arctic and \r\nAntarctic meet to give birth to their calves. \r\n Over 1,000 islands and coral reefs beautify our \r\nseas, and we are framed by over 2,500 kilometres of \r\ncoastline, many of them as pristine and untouched as \r\nwhen Christopher Columbus first arrived in the \r\nAmericas. \r\n But the very best resource we have is our people. \r\nWe are a multiethnic and friendly people. Our \r\nindigenous peoples of the comarcas are an example of \r\nresistance to mistreatment at the hands of nature and \r\ncultural assimilation.  \r\n All the countries represented in this Hall have \r\ntheir own wonders that the entire world admires. We \r\nmust unite to protect and conserve our beauty, \r\nresources, biodiversity, world heritage and, first and \r\nforemost, our peoples. \r\n I am an eternal optimist. I see my country, \r\nPanama, providing more jobs for its men and women. I \r\nsee a middle class that keeps growing and earning \r\nmore. I see new technologies spawning unprecedented \r\neconomic growth. I see the first country in the world \r\nwith free internet access for all its citizens. \r\n A/64/PV.5\r\n \r\n23 09-52320 \r\n \r\n I see Panama with better health care, better \r\neducation, better transportation, and with families that \r\nare happier and more unified. We Panamanians can do \r\nanything we dream of. And if each and every one of us \r\nachieves our dreams, we will have a better world. \r\n In the five years ahead of us, we are going to \r\ndream big. Our best days are yet to come. \r\n If I had to describe Panama in just a few words, I \r\nwould say we are a country and a people full of \r\nsurprises. Panama will amaze you, and Panama will \r\namaze the world. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Panama for the statement he has just made. \r\n  Mr. Ricardo Martinelli Berrocal, President of the \r\nRepublic of Panama, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Hans-Rudolf Merz, President of \r\nthe Swiss Confederation \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Swiss \r\nConfederation. \r\n  Mr. Hans-Rudolf Merz, President of the Swiss \r\nConfederation, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Hans-Rudolf Merz, \r\nPresident of the Swiss Confederation, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly. \r\n President Merz (spoke in French): We look back \r\non a year that has been exceptional in so many \r\nrespects. Twelve months ago, a bank only a few \r\nhundred metres away from here collapsed and brought \r\nthe global financial system to the verge of breakdown. \r\nThe ensuing turbulence in the finance sector led to a \r\nsevere global economic downturn. \r\n This illustrates the interconnectedness of our \r\nworld. It reminds us that other issues, such as climate \r\nchange, the food crisis, migration, pandemics, \r\nterrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction are not confined by national borders. \r\nRising to these global challenges requires determined \r\nand coordinated action at the national, regional and \r\ninternational levels. International cooperation has \r\nbecome vital. The United Nations is the place where \r\nthis cooperation happens. Today, the world needs the \r\nUnited Nations more than ever. \r\n The United Nations should continue along its \r\npath of reform in order to reinforce its legitimacy. At \r\nthe same time, exchanges between the United Nations \r\nand other forums such as the Group of 20 (G-20) — \r\nwhich is meeting today — must be strengthened. The \r\nG-20 has taken over a role in discussing important \r\nglobal issues. This development must not take place at \r\nthe expense of other nations or global institutions such \r\nas the United Nations. The G-20 lacks legitimacy; \r\nbasic considerations of due process are absent in the \r\nsanctions procedures. The members of the G-20 \r\nthemselves are not subject to the same scrutiny. \r\nSwitzerland advocates a level playing field. \r\n The financial and economic crisis continues to be \r\nof concern to all of us. Governments and central banks \r\nhave put together vast stabilization packages. However, \r\nquantity is not everything. What counts is quality. \r\nEconomic activity must revert to fundamental values \r\nand virtues. It must focus on economic, social and \r\nenvironmental sustainability. Through institutions such \r\nas the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank \r\nand the United Nations Development Programme \r\n(UNDP), the United Nations has the knowledge and the \r\ninstruments needed to combat the financial and \r\neconomic crisis. It is important to ensure that the \r\nvoices of these institutions too be heard within the \r\nG-20. \r\n The present crisis has occasionally been used in \r\nsome quarters as an opportunity to question the market \r\neconomy and, indeed, globalization. I do not dispute \r\nthat reform is necessary. The failures and abuses have \r\nbeen too big to ignore. Nevertheless, we must remind \r\nourselves that it is also thanks to a liberal economic \r\norder and open markets that much of the world’s \r\npopulation has been lifted out of poverty. Here, we \r\nshare the concerns of those who believe that the current \r\ngrowing trend towards protectionism will lead us \r\nstraight towards disaster. My country therefore \r\nwelcomes the call made at the United Nations World \r\nConference on the Financial and Economic Crisis for \r\nthe swift conclusion of the Doha Round. \r\n People in the developing countries have been hit \r\nparticularly hard by the financial and economic crisis. \r\nThere is a significant risk that the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals will be delayed. As for \r\nA/64/PV.5 \r\n \r\n09-52320 24 \r\n \r\nSwitzerland, we have pledged to maintain our level of \r\ndevelopment aid despite stringent budget constraints. \r\nDeveloping and developed countries are jointly \r\nresponsible for achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. Next year, the United Nations conference \r\nmarking the tenth anniversary of the Millennium \r\nDeclaration will provide us with the opportunity to \r\nreinvigorate this partnership and to improve the \r\neffectiveness of development aid. \r\n Sustainable development must also be our \r\nguiding principle in the fight against climate change. \r\nThis is why the climate conference in Copenhagen \r\nmust be a success. Switzerland wants and is able to set \r\na good example. We will achieve our CO2 reduction \r\ntargets for 2012. For the period until 2020, we are \r\nprepared to cut our CO2 emissions by 20 per cent. At \r\nthe global level, the costs of adaptation to climate \r\nchange will amount to several tens of billions of \r\ndollars per year of which more than half will be at the \r\nexpense of developing countries. Switzerland has \r\ntherefore proposed the creation of a global carbon tax \r\nwhich is based on the polluter-pays principle, in order \r\nto deal with these emerging needs. \r\n Violent conflicts continue to plague the planet, \r\nrendering a life in dignity, peace and security elusive \r\nfor too many people. The unique legitimacy of the \r\nUnited Nations allows it to play an active role in \r\nconflict prevention, mediation, the protection of \r\ncivilians, peacekeeping and peacebuilding. My country \r\nwelcomes the greater involvement of the United \r\nNations in these areas and especially advocates the \r\nstrengthening of United Nations prevention and \r\nmediation capacities. Switzerland is also active in the \r\narea of peacebuilding. It has taken over the \r\nchairmanship of the Peacebuilding Commission’s \r\ncountry-specific configuration on Burundi and will \r\ncontinue its initiative on armed violence and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n This year we celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of \r\nthe Geneva Conventions. Since their creation, the \r\nGeneva Conventions have set indispensable rules for \r\nsituations of armed conflict. New forms of armed \r\nconflict and new means and methods of warfare make \r\nit increasingly difficult to ensure respect for these \r\nrules. It is unacceptable that civilian populations \r\nshould be so often the target of deliberate attacks and \r\nthat humanitarian aid personnel should be so often \r\ndenied rapid and unimpeded access to populations in \r\nneed.  \r\n In an effort to identify ways of improving \r\ncompliance with the Geneva Conventions, Switzerland \r\nis organizing a ministerial side event on Saturday here \r\nin New York. In November we will hold an \r\ninternational conference of experts in Geneva, open to \r\nall State parties to the Geneva Conventions. The \r\nconference will focus on the current and future \r\nchallenges faced by international humanitarian law. \r\n Human dignity is an inalienable right of all \r\nhuman beings, regardless of their gender, origin or \r\nreligion. The Human Rights Council is the principal \r\nforum for discussing human rights within the United \r\nNations. Both its special procedures and its universal \r\nperiodic review process have demonstrated their \r\neffectiveness. This said, a great many challenges \r\nremain. Switzerland will continue to work vigorously \r\nfor an effective Human Rights Council and will present \r\nits candidacy for a second term starting in 2010.  \r\n The protection of human rights, along with the \r\npromotion of democracy and the strengthening of the \r\nrule of law will also be priorities of the Swiss \r\npresidency of the Council of Europe from November \r\n2009 to May 2010. Under the Swiss presidency, efforts \r\nwill be made to increase cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and the Council of Europe. \r\n 2010 will thus be a symbolic year for the United \r\nNations. Five years will have passed since the adoption \r\nof the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document and ten \r\nyears since the signing of the Millennium Declaration. \r\nNext year’s summit will be an opportunity to assess the \r\nstatus of implementation of these declarations and to \r\ninitiate new, more comprehensive reforms. These are \r\nnecessary steps because only a reformed United \r\nNations will be in a position to find appropriate \r\nresponses to the global challenges.  \r\n In this context, it is my great pleasure to \r\nannounce to Member States that Switzerland has put \r\nforward the candidature of Joseph Deiss, former \r\nPresident of the Swiss Confederation, for the \r\npresidency of the sixty-fifth session of the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n I will conclude with the following: the challenges \r\nto be met are huge, however we must not yield to \r\npessimism. Throughout history, human beings have \r\ndemonstrated time and again that with courage, \r\nimagination and persistence they are capable of great \r\nachievements. The Swiss writer Max Frisch once said: \r\n“A crisis can be a productive state. You just have to get \r\n A/64/PV.5\r\n \r\n25 09-52320 \r\n \r\nrid of the aftertaste of disaster.” I absolutely agree. So \r\nlet us be productive and seize the opportunity to create \r\na prosperous, just, peaceful and sustainable world. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Swiss \r\nConfederation for the statement he has just made. \r\n  Mr. Hans-Rudolf Merz, President of the Swiss \r\nConfederation, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n  Address by Mr. José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, \r\nPresident of the Government of the Kingdom of \r\nSpain \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Government of \r\nthe Kingdom of Spain. \r\n  Mr. José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, President of \r\nthe Government of the Kingdom of Spain, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum. \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. José Luis Rodríguez \r\nZapatero, President of the Government of the Kingdom \r\nof Spain, and inviting him to address the Assembly. \r\n Mr. Rodríguez Zapatero (Spain) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): A little more than a year ago, we witnessed \r\nwith great concern the collapse of some of the largest \r\nfinancial institutions of the world’s wealthiest \r\ncountries. That financial fissure precipitated a global \r\neconomic crisis which, despite the emerging signs of \r\nrecovery, all of us continue to experience. We faced the \r\nstark reality that we lacked the necessary guidelines \r\nand rules to prevent what was occurring in the global \r\nfinancial system, even though it already was a global \r\nsystem. Now, following the G-20 summits in \r\nWashington and London, where we laid the \r\nfoundations to resolve the problems, it is up to the \r\nPittsburgh conference to finish the work.  \r\n Despite what has been said, this is not the first \r\nglobalization crisis. Instead, it is the first crisis of \r\nglobal governance, that is to say, a crisis of an \r\ninsufficiently governed globalization. We have an \r\nobligation to learn from this experience — certainly to \r\nlearn a lesson with regard to the financial and \r\neconomic crisis, but also about the other global \r\nchallenges that require both collective determination \r\nand coordinated multilateral political efforts. For those \r\nchallenges are interrelated. We cannot aspire to \r\neconomic and social development unless countries and \r\npeoples enjoy adequate peace and security. Conversely, \r\nit will not be possible to build lasting peace and \r\nsecurity unless there is sustainable development.  \r\n That same willingness to take responsibility for \r\nboth problems and solutions, which has re-emerged \r\nstrongly in recent months, should ensure that we do not \r\nfail in responding to the conflicts and threats \r\nconfronting world peace and security. That willingness \r\nshould also ensure that we do not fail in dealing with \r\nextreme hunger and poverty; in effectively committing \r\nourselves to combating the effects of climate change; \r\nor in tackling organized crime, terrorism and piracy. \r\nWe therefore have a great opportunity before us.  \r\n Here at the general debate, one year after the \r\nbeginning of the financial crisis that nearly engulfed \r\nthe well-being of developed countries and dashed the \r\nhopes of many others, I would like to reiterate that \r\nSpain is a country committed to multilateralism and the \r\nneed to continue to develop a system of global \r\ngovernance — and that applies to every one of the \r\nchallenges to which I have just referred. But before \r\nturning to those challenges, I should like to begin by \r\nsaying that multilateralism is not just a process for \r\ntaking decisions and resolving conflicts at the \r\ninternational level. It is indeed that; but in order for \r\nmultilateralism to be effective and lasting, it must \r\nabove all include two fundamental elements. \r\n First of all, multilateralism is intrinsically linked \r\nwith the faithful observance of democratic values, \r\nhuman rights and effective equality between women \r\nand men throughout the world. In that regard, I very \r\nmuch welcome the last resolution adopted by the \r\nGeneral Assembly at the previous session, which will \r\nmake a single body responsible for all gender issues.  \r\n Today, however, standing firmly for democracy \r\nelicits a single name: Honduras. Our Latin American \r\nbrothers in that country have in recent years seen the \r\nstrengthening of both democracy and the prospects for \r\nthe future. With the support of Spain and the \r\ninternational community, they have now decided that \r\nthey are going to overcome the challenge before \r\nHonduras. We will not accept an anti-democratic coup. \r\nWe will not accept it, and democracy must return to \r\nHonduras. \r\nA/64/PV.5 \r\n \r\n09-52320 26 \r\n \r\n Secondly, but no less important, multilateralism \r\nrequires, if not a culture, an atmosphere of dialogue, \r\nrespect and acceptance between countries, regions and, \r\nmore broadly, civilizations. Five years ago, I addressed \r\nthe General Assembly for the first time to propose the \r\nestablishment of an alliance of civilizations focused on \r\npromoting understanding and cooperation between \r\ncountries and peoples of different cultures and \r\nreligions, as well as on countering the forces that breed \r\nextremism and endanger peace.  \r\n We cannot be satisfied solely at the fact that the \r\ngroup of friends for that initiative has since grown to \r\nover 100 members, or that there are now associated \r\nnetworks of individuals and representatives of civil \r\nsociety organizations who are ensuring the continued \r\nexistence of the project, or that the third forum of the \r\nAlliance will be held next year in Rio de Janeiro. Nor \r\ncan we be satisfied at the fact that those developments \r\nclearly illustrate the universality of the principles \r\nunderpinning the initiative. Respect for the diversity of \r\ncivilizations, cultures and traditions are crucial to the \r\neffectiveness and sustainability of the multilateralism \r\nthat we wish to see strengthened on the basis of human \r\nrights and the universal values that we share as \r\nresponsible members of the international community. \r\n When I launched the Alliance of Civilizations \r\ninitiative from this very rostrum five years ago, it was \r\nat a less favourable time than the present. Yesterday, \r\nhaving heard statements by the President of the United \r\nStates of America and other international leaders, I \r\nthought to myself that this effort has been worthwhile. \r\nToday the Alliance is able to deploy its full potential in \r\norder to promote the effective multilateralism we \r\ndesire. We are now able to build. The initiative was \r\nworth it and — if I may put it this way — it was also \r\nright that the United Nations made it its own through \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon and his predecessor, \r\nKofi Annan.  \r\n Spain is therefore pleased that the President of \r\nthe General Assembly has proposed that the debate at \r\nthis new session focus on “Effective responses to \r\nglobal crises: strengthening multilateralism and \r\ndialogue among civilizations for international peace, \r\nsecurity and development”. We must now take a new \r\nstep.  \r\n The Alliance of Civilizations, which sets out and \r\npromotes those values throughout the entire United \r\nNations, should be a structural component of the main \r\nbodies and all other entities of the Organization. The \r\ntime has come for the General Assembly to adopt a \r\nresolution conferring that structural character on the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations through a constitutive charter. \r\nSpain will work with Turkey and the wider \r\nmembership of the Alliance’s group of friends in order \r\nthat such a resolution can be adopted by the end of this \r\nfall. I am convinced that it will make a very positive \r\ncontribution to the work of such bodies as the Human \r\nRights Council, the Economic and Social Council and \r\neven the Security Council. The dialogue among \r\ncivilizations should be the mother tongue of the United \r\nNations. \r\n The new multilateralism has been essential for \r\ntaking significant steps forward in the area of \r\ndisarmament and arms control, such as prohibiting \r\nanti-personnel landmines and cluster bombs.  \r\n Now, the world has the opportunity to take a \r\ngreat step: abolishing nuclear weapons. President \r\nObama has had the courage to put that on the table, and \r\nthe United States and Russia — a country that is and \r\nwill remain key to Euro-Atlantic security — are \r\nnegotiating the largest cuts ever made to these arsenals. \r\nWe encourage them. We are hopeful about the initiative \r\nto convene a special summit of the Security Council \r\ndevoted to the fight against nuclear proliferation.  \r\n Spain, a nation that renounced the development \r\nand possession of nuclear weapons, fully shares that \r\nobjective and will support it with every means at our \r\ndisposal. We should immediately undertake to \r\nstrengthen the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT), whose Review Conference in \r\nMay 2010 will coincide with Spain’s presidency of the \r\nEuropean Union. I pledge to do everything possible, as \r\nfar as Spain and the European Union are concerned, to \r\nensure that this important conference has concrete \r\nresults that will enable us to advance the perspective of \r\na world free from nuclear weapons.  \r\n Let us continue to act with determination and \r\nwithout discouragement to build and consolidate peace \r\nin all areas and regions. My country is proud to have \r\nbeen contributing to United Nations peacekeeping \r\nmissions for 20 years. Over those 20 years, we have \r\ntaken part in 22 missions comprising a total of more \r\nthan 100,000 troops.  \r\n Currently, we share the concern over the situation \r\nin Afghanistan. I am sure, however, that the \r\ninternational community will be able to find a \r\n A/64/PV.5\r\n \r\n27 09-52320 \r\n \r\nsolution — a solution that is not and cannot be purely \r\nmilitary. The shared conviction as to the strategic value \r\nof the region and the internal solidarity among the \r\ncountries present there is stronger than ever and will be \r\ndecisive in the face of the difficulties before us.  \r\n I also wish to reiterate the need to persevere in \r\nseeking formulas for peace in the Middle East because \r\nof that conflict’s potential to spread and affect other \r\nregional conflicts such as those just mentioned. The \r\nworld has an unresolved task: peace in the Middle \r\nEast, with two secure States — the State of Israel, but \r\nalso the State of Palestine, which the international \r\ncommunity must consider and recognize within a \r\nreasonable period of time. Peace in the Middle East has \r\nbeen and continues to be the first strategic priority for \r\nthe international community.  \r\n According to the most recent estimates, more \r\nthan 1 billion people throughout the world — nearly \r\none sixth of its total population — suffer hunger. We \r\nmust say this as often as possible: figures such as that, \r\nreflecting unfathomable human suffering, assault our \r\nconsciences time and again as leaders of the \r\ninternational community and as citizens. It is unjust \r\nand unacceptable to proceed further into the twenty-\r\nfirst century, as we are doing, with such a radical \r\nimbalance in the living conditions of humanity. It is \r\nunjust, unacceptable and also unsafe — a permanent \r\nsource of instability. It is not possible to aspire to a \r\nsecure world if the current levels of inequality and \r\npoverty persist.  \r\n That is why our commitment to international \r\npeace and security must go hand in hand with a \r\nrenewed effort to eradicate poverty, using our \r\nleadership responsibly and with solidarity and avoiding \r\nthe temptation, in times of economic crisis, to lessen \r\nour commitment to the world’s poorest and most \r\nvulnerable.  \r\n The achievement of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals must be a central aspect of the international \r\nagenda. Five years before 2015, the Goals can still be \r\nachieved, with sustained collective effort. At the next \r\nsession of the General Assembly, we must reach \r\nspecific agreements that will guarantee their \r\nachievement.   \r\n I wish to strengthen the appeal for that urgent \r\njoint effort by citing the commitment of my country \r\nand its citizens. I refer in particular to Africa. The \r\ntwenty-first century should belong to a continent that \r\nhas been dispossessed for too long in the history of \r\nhumanity: the African continent. Spain has become the \r\nseventh-largest international donor and the eighth-\r\nlargest United Nations contributor, and we have made a \r\nclear commitment in the area of food security. \r\n Over the past few years, we have raised \r\nhumanity’s awareness about the seriousness of the \r\neffects of climate change. There is now sufficient \r\nawareness about the need to combat climate change \r\nand also about the opportunities it provides us to create \r\na new model of economic development — sustainable \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n With climate change, the time for awareness-\r\nraising is over and the time for commitments has \r\narrived. We do not need any more words; it is time for \r\naction. We must take everyone’s circumstances into \r\naccount, but, if we are to make collective progress, we \r\nmust not delay. Although we have been able to see the \r\neffects of the economic crisis, we still find it difficult \r\nto react to the effects of a phenomenon much more \r\ndevastating for entire future generations. That is \r\nparadoxical and incomprehensible — even more so \r\nwhen we consider that to emerge from the economic \r\ncrisis means ensuring the only kind of growth possible: \r\nsustainable growth.  \r\n We have 75 days before the Copenhagen summit \r\nbegins. They can be 75 days for the future or for \r\nfailure, 75 days for responsibility or for impotence, \r\n75 days for agreement or for the useless defence of \r\nselfish interests. Copenhagen should give two answers \r\nto the world, regarding what and when: an ambitious \r\nreduction of emissions — the what — and a horizon \r\nthat is near and defined — the when. \r\n In order to attain those objectives, we also need \r\nto think about how. We know that technological \r\nresearch, innovation and development in the area of \r\nenergy assist in the fight against climate change. That \r\nis why Spain has proposed that every State should \r\ndevote at least 0.7 per cent of its gross domestic \r\nproduct to research, development and innovation in the \r\narea of technology and energy. That is a reference \r\nfigure that, as in the area of development cooperation \r\npolicy, will help us determine a commitment before the \r\ninternational community. My country also proposes to \r\npromote, when we assume the European Union \r\npresidency in the first half of 2010, the agreements that \r\nwe must all adopt at Copenhagen.  \r\nA/64/PV.5 \r\n \r\n09-52320 28 \r\n \r\n Finally, only one year ago we were struck by a \r\nfinancial crisis that shook every corner of the world. \r\nSince then, all of us have suffered the effects of that \r\ncrisis, but we have also become aware of the need to \r\nmove ahead in building global governance and have \r\ntaken resolute steps in that direction. Let us continue \r\non that path, not just to continue fighting against the \r\ncrisis and for employment, but to overcome it together \r\nand successfully address the other global challenges.  \r\n Let us use this time for clarity; let us take this \r\nopportunity. Let us build a multilateralism that is \r\neffective and responsible — above all, a \r\nmultilateralism of solidarity. Since 1945, there have \r\nnever been such favourable circumstances for \r\ntranslating the desires of the founders of the United \r\nNations into the reality of the international order. \r\nThose desires were intended for succeeding \r\ngenerations. And we are the first generation that has \r\nwithin its reach the ability to fulfil the old and \r\nbeautiful dream of a world governed by all. Let us do \r\nso.  \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the \r\nGovernment of the Kingdom of Spain for the statement \r\nhe has just made. \r\n  Mr. José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, President of \r\nthe Government of the Kingdom of Spain, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum. \r\n  Address by Mr. Yukio Hatoyama, Prime \r\nMinister of Japan \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of Japan. \r\n \r\n Mr. Yukio Hatoyama, Prime Minister of Japan, \r\nwas escorted to the rostrum. \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Yukio Hatoyama, Prime \r\nMinister of Japan, and inviting him to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n Mr. Hatoyama (Japan): I should like to extend \r\nmy heartfelt congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Ali \r\nAbdussalam Treki on his assuming the presidency of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. I \r\nshould also like to express my respect to His \r\nExcellency Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann for his \r\nexcellent leadership at the previous session. I also \r\nhighly commend the dedication and leadership of His \r\nExcellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in tackling \r\nthe various challenging issues that the United Nations \r\nfaces at the present time. \r\n It was 120 years ago, in 1889, that an electoral \r\nsystem, while limited, was initiated in Japan. From that \r\ntime forward, the change of governments through \r\nelections has been a matter of course in Japan. Japan \r\nalso enjoyed a period in the early twentieth century \r\nknown as the Taisho democracy. \r\n Japan is thus a nation with a solid heritage of \r\ndemocracy and elections. Since the Second World War, \r\nhowever, Japan has not experienced changes of power \r\nthrough the ballot box. Tensions between politicians \r\nand bureaucrats disappeared. It cannot be denied that \r\nas a result, Japan’s foreign policy has been somewhat \r\ndeprived of vitality. \r\n However, on 30 August this year, the Japanese \r\npeople finally chose, through a general election, to \r\nhave a change of power. This is a triumph for \r\ndemocracy in Japan and a victory for the Japanese \r\npeople.  \r\n Last week, on 16 September, I assumed the office \r\nof Prime Minister of Japan, and thus I stand before you \r\ntoday. My new Administration embodies the dynamism \r\nof democracy and will exert all efforts to address both \r\ndomestic affairs and foreign policy challenges through \r\nour all-Japan agenda. \r\n Japan’s membership in the United Nations was \r\napproved on 18 December 1956. The Prime Minister at \r\nthe time was Ichiro Hatoyama, my grandfather. At the \r\neleventh session of the General Assembly, where Japan \r\nmade its maiden speech, then-Foreign Minister \r\nMamoru Shigemitsu stated: \r\n  “The substance of Japan’s political, \r\neconomic and cultural life is the product of the \r\nfusion within the last century of the civilizations \r\nof the Orient and the Occident. In a way, Japan \r\nmay well be regarded as a bridge between the \r\nEast and the West. It is fully conscious of the \r\ngreat responsibilities of such a position.” \r\n(A/PV.623, para. 80) \r\n My grandfather Ichiro, Prime Minister at that \r\ntime, was an advocate of the concept of “yu-ai”, or \r\nfraternity. This “yu-ai” is a way of thinking that \r\nrespects one’s own freedom and individual dignity \r\nwhile also respecting the freedom and individual \r\n A/64/PV.5\r\n \r\n29 09-52320 \r\n \r\ndignity of others. There is a remarkable resonance \r\nbetween the concept of the bridge in Mamoru \r\nShigemitsu’s address and Ichiro’s concept of “yu-ai”, \r\nor fraternity.  \r\n Now, 53 years later, here before the very same \r\nGeneral Assembly, I declare with firm determination \r\nthat Japan will again play the role of a bridge. Today, \r\nthe world faces numerous arduous challenges. This is \r\nnot an easy era by any means, but the new Japan will \r\nnot turn its back on such challenges. Based upon the \r\nspirit of “yu-ai”, or fraternity, Japan will make utmost \r\nefforts to become a bridge for the world, between the \r\nOrient and the Occident, between developed and \r\ndeveloping countries and between diverse civilizations.  \r\n Today, I should like to address the Assembly \r\nregarding five challenges that Japan intends to take on \r\nin serving as this bridge. \r\n The first is seeking measures to respond to the \r\nglobal economic crisis. While the global economy \r\nappears to have emerged from the worst stage of the \r\ncrisis, it is still difficult to predict its future prospects, \r\nincluding the issue of employment. What Japan must \r\ndo in this area is, first of all, to revive its own \r\neconomy. The new Japan has a plan for achieving this. \r\nChild allowances totalling 5.5 trillion yen per year will \r\nserve not only as an investment in education but also as \r\na means of stimulating consumption and addressing the \r\nlow birth rate in Japan. \r\n The abolishment of provisional rates on auto-\r\nrelated taxes will provide tax relief amounting to \r\n2.5 trillion yen per year and at the same time is \r\nexpected to enhance the cost competitiveness of \r\nJapanese industries through the revitalization of the \r\ndistribution infrastructure. \r\n On a topic I will return to later, we are setting a \r\nvery ambitious target to tackle climate change, which \r\nshould result in the creation of new markets, including \r\nfor electric vehicles, solar power generation and clean \r\nenergy businesses. Furthermore, we will ensure stable \r\npotential for growth through the creation of new \r\nindustries and new technologies in maritime, space, \r\nnext-generation information technology and other \r\nfields. \r\n By reviewing economic policies through this \r\nchange of power, Japan is sending a clear signal of the \r\nforthcoming revival of its economy.  \r\n The new Japan will also need to respond \r\nappropriately to globalization. The deepening of \r\nworldwide interdependence described by the term \r\n“globalization” includes aspects of both light and \r\nshadow. Expanding the light while controlling the \r\nshadow has become a task on a global scale for today’s \r\nworld. As we advance the liberalization of trade and \r\ninvestment, international coordination is necessary to \r\nforge systems to rein in the issues of poverty and \r\neconomic disparity — which are difficult to coordinate \r\nby simply leaving them to market mechanisms — and \r\nexcessive money-making games. Japan will play a role \r\nas a bridge in international forums, including the \r\nGroup of 20, towards the formulation of common rules \r\nto that end. \r\n The second challenge is to address the climate \r\nchange issue. As is apparent from the increased \r\nincidence of extreme weather events, rising sea levels \r\nand other phenomena, climate change is a danger that \r\nis already confronting us. Furthermore, efforts by one \r\ncountry can produce only limited effects. However, due \r\nto differences in short-term interests between \r\ndeveloped and developing countries, and among \r\ndeveloped countries as well as among developing \r\ncountries, the path towards creating a post-2012 \r\nframework will be anything but smooth. The new \r\nJapanese Government has set a very ambitious target \r\nfor a greenhouse gas emissions reduction of 25 per cent \r\nby 2020, as compared to the 1990 level. \r\n It has also made it clear that it is prepared to \r\nprovide more financial and technical assistance to \r\ndeveloping countries than in the past, in accordance \r\nwith the progress of international negotiations. This \r\ninternational commitment is premised on the \r\nformulation of a fair and effective international \r\nframework by all major economies and agreement on \r\ntheir ambitious targets. Japan has announced this \r\nambitious pledge because it wishes to serve as a bridge \r\namong countries with varied interests and to preserve \r\nthe planet for future generations. I would like to appeal \r\nstrongly to the representatives present today — let us \r\nwork together to ensure the success of the upcoming \r\nCopenhagen meeting. \r\n The third challenge is that of nuclear \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation. I welcome the \r\nprogress being made in the negotiations on nuclear \r\nweapons reduction between the United States and the \r\nRussian Federation. I also commend the United \r\nKingdom and France for their initiatives. It is urgent \r\nA/64/PV.5 \r\n \r\n09-52320 30 \r\n \r\nthat all nuclear-weapon States take concrete measures \r\non nuclear disarmament. There are States currently \r\nengaged in efforts to develop nuclear weapons. \r\nFurthermore, there is an increasingly greater risk that \r\nnuclear materials and nuclear technologies will be \r\npassed onto terrorists or even actually used. \r\n In this area as well, Japan has the potential to \r\nbecome a promoter of nuclear disarmament and to \r\nserve as a bridge between States possessing nuclear \r\nweapons and those without them. Japan can speak with \r\nthe greatest persuasiveness in urging nuclear-weapon \r\nStates towards nuclear disarmament and non-nuclear-\r\nweapon States to avoid the temptation to acquire \r\nnuclear weapons. Japan can do so because it is the only \r\ncountry which has ever suffered the devastation of \r\natomic bombs and, as such, has never ceased to appeal \r\nfor no more Hiroshimas and no more Nagasakis. Japan \r\nhas also continued to maintain its three non-nuclear \r\nprinciples, despite its potential capability to acquire \r\nnuclear weapons. \r\n In April this year in Prague, President \r\nBarack Obama articulated a vision of a world without \r\nnuclear weapons, inspiring people throughout the \r\nglobe. I am one of those people. In order to ensure the \r\nsuccess of the Review Conference of the Parties to the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, \r\nto be held next year in May, we must take action now \r\ntowards the early entry into force of the \r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the early \r\ncommencement of negotiations on a fissile material \r\ncut-off treaty. \r\n Here, I must touch upon the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea. Its nuclear tests and missile \r\nlaunches are a threat to the peace and stability not only \r\nof the region, but also of the international community \r\nas a whole, and cannot be condoned under any \r\ncircumstances. It is imperative that the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea comply fully with the \r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions and that the \r\ninternational community implement these resolutions. \r\n Japan will continue its efforts to realize the \r\ndenuclearization of the Korean peninsula through the \r\nSix-Party Talks. Japan seeks to normalize relations \r\nwith the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, in \r\naccordance with the Pyongyang Declaration issued by \r\nour two countries, through the comprehensive \r\nresolution of the outstanding issues of concern with the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, including the \r\nabduction, nuclear and missile issues, as well as by \r\nsincerely moving beyond the unfortunate past. \r\n In particular, regarding the abduction issue, \r\nconstructive actions by the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea, including swiftly commencing a \r\nfull investigation as agreed last year, will be an avenue \r\ntowards progress in relations between our two \r\ncountries. If the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea takes such constructive and sincere actions, \r\nJapan is ready to respond positively. \r\n The fourth challenge is posed by issues related to \r\npeacebuilding, development and poverty. Even in the \r\ntwenty-first century, the world has not been liberated \r\nfrom the problems of poverty, infectious diseases, \r\nhealth, education, water and sanitation, food and illegal \r\ndrugs. The situation is particularly serious in \r\ndeveloping countries. \r\n I am also compelled to point out the unfortunate \r\nreality that fragile or failed States can become breeding \r\ngrounds for terrorism. The global economic crisis that \r\nbegan last year has exacerbated the situation. The new \r\nJapan should also become a bridge in this area. Japan \r\nwill work in partnership with international and \r\nnon-governmental organizations and strengthen its \r\nassistance to developing countries in terms of both \r\nquality and quantity. \r\n Mr. Žbogar (Slovenia), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n Japan intends to continue and strengthen the \r\nTokyo International Conference on African \r\nDevelopment process, and redouble its efforts towards \r\nthe achievement of the Millennium Development Goals \r\nand the promotion of human security. \r\n For the stability and reconstruction of \r\nAfghanistan, Japan has provided assistance in a broad \r\nrange of fields, such as strengthening the security \r\nsector, including through assistance for police, and \r\ndeveloping social infrastructure. Japan has also \r\nextended agricultural assistance and capacity-building \r\nsupport, including vocational training, through the \r\nJapan International Cooperation Agency, its aid \r\nimplementation agency. \r\n Japan will proactively support Afghanistan’s own \r\nefforts to ensure its stability and reconstruction, in \r\nconjunction with the international community. It goes \r\nwithout saying that the primary actors in achieving \r\npeace in Afghanistan and in advancing national \r\n A/64/PV.5\r\n \r\n31 09-52320 \r\n \r\nreconstruction are the people of Afghanistan \r\nthemselves. \r\n As progress is made, the reconciliation and \r\nreintegration of insurgents will become critical issues. \r\nJapan will make vital contributions in these areas, \r\nincluding possible reintegration assistance, such as \r\nvocational training aimed at providing a means of \r\nlivelihood to people who have undergone \r\nreconciliation. The stability of the surrounding region \r\nis also important, and Japan is steadfastly providing \r\nsupport for Pakistan and other countries in the area. \r\n In the world in which we now live, national \r\nsecurity and human security are becoming increasingly \r\nintertwined. The path forward that will save humanity \r\nis one which can bring about shared security in which \r\nvarious nations, ethnicities, races and religions coexist \r\nwhile acknowledging the differences among them. In \r\nother words, it is to bring about shared security through \r\nthe principles of yuai, or fraternity.  \r\n The fifth challenge is to build an East Asian \r\ncommunity. Today, there is no way that Japan can \r\ndevelop without deeply involving itself in the Asia and \r\nPacific regions. Reducing the region’s security risks \r\nand sharing in one another’s economic dynamism, \r\nbased on the principle of open regionalism, will result \r\nin tremendous benefits not only for Japan but also for \r\nthe region and the international community. Given the \r\nhistorical circumstances arising from its mistaken \r\nactions in the past, Japan has hesitated to play a \r\nproactive role in this region. It is my hope that the new \r\nJapan can overcome this history and become a bridge \r\namong the countries of Asia. \r\n I look forward to an East Asian community taking \r\nshape as an extension of the accumulated cooperation \r\nbuilt up step by step among partners who have the \r\ncapacity to work together, starting with fields in which \r\nwe can cooperate — free trade agreements, finance, \r\ncurrency, energy, the environment, disaster relief and \r\nmore. Of course, Rome was not built in a day, so let us \r\nseek to move forward steadily on this, even if at a \r\nmoderate pace. \r\n In closing, I would like representatives to recall \r\nthat the United Nations is the forum in which bridging \r\ndiplomacy is made manifest. In resolving various \r\nissues of international peace and stability, development \r\nand the environment, among others, the United Nations \r\nhas an immense role to play. I intend to make greater \r\nuse of the Organization and to work to enhance the \r\neffectiveness and efficiency of the United Nations as a \r\nwhole. \r\n I firmly believe that Japan has the capacity to \r\nplay an even greater role in the United Nations, and \r\nabove all at the Security Council, as a bridge between \r\nvarious countries. Japan will continue to participate \r\nactively in the intergovernmental negotiations on \r\nSecurity Council reform, pursuing the expansion of \r\nboth permanent and non-permanent membership and of \r\nJapan’s permanent membership in the Council. This \r\nconcludes my message from the new Japan. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of Japan \r\nfor the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Yukio Hatoyama, Prime Minister of Japan, \r\n was escorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Turkey \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Turkey. \r\n Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Prime Minister of the \r\n Republic of Turkey, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, \r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Turkey, and inviting \r\nhim to address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Erdoğan (Turkey) (spoke in Turkish; English \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): It is a great \r\npleasure for me to address and greet the General \r\nAssembly once again from this rostrum in my capacity \r\nas Prime Minister of Turkey on the occasion of the \r\ngeneral debate of the Assembly’s sixty-fourth session. \r\n I would like to congratulate Mr. Ali Abdussalam \r\nTreki on his election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-fourth session. I also wish to \r\nexpress my appreciation and thanks to Mr. D’Escoto \r\nBrockmann for his able and prudent conduct of the \r\npresidency of the Assembly at its sixty-third session. I \r\ntake this opportunity also to thank all the Member \r\nStates for the high degree of trust and approval shown \r\nto my country in electing it last year as a \r\nnon-permanent member of the Security Council by a \r\nwide margin of support. \r\nA/64/PV.5 \r\n \r\n09-52320 32 \r\n \r\n The global problems of our age necessitate \r\nsolutions on a global scale, and we therefore need to \r\nwork in a determined fashion. From wars to economic \r\ncrises, from hunger and poverty to terrorism, from \r\nenergy security to climate change, the problems of our \r\nworld are extremely challenging. However, none of \r\nthem is insurmountable. \r\n If we are to resolve these problems, we need a \r\nfair and inclusive global order that is based on trust \r\nand regards diversity as a source of wealth. It is \r\npossible to make the transition from a conception of \r\nthe world based on risk and perceptions of threats to \r\none that is based on trust and solidarity. Indeed, this \r\nhas become a necessity for all of us. To do so, \r\nhowever, we need a new kind of leadership. We can \r\nindeed make the twenty-first century an era ruled by \r\npeace instead of war; trust instead of fear; justice \r\ninstead of injustice; tranquillity instead of terror and \r\nviolence; and prosperity instead of hunger and poverty. \r\nIt is our common responsibility and historic duty to \r\nparticipate in the construction of such a world, \r\nregardless of our differences of language, religion or \r\nnationality. \r\n Threats such as terrorism and the proliferation of \r\nnuclear weapons have become sources of worldwide \r\nconcern. Problems such as hunger and poverty, the \r\nincreased frequency of pandemics, food and energy \r\nsecurity, growing xenophobia and radicalism remain \r\ngrave challenges. In addition, global warming and the \r\nfinancial crisis are fundamental issues that demand \r\nsubstantial solutions. \r\n Against that backdrop, the relevance and \r\nindispensability of the United Nations has become \r\neven more evident. In order to establish a fair and \r\nparticipatory global order, we must work together to \r\nenhance the Organization’s efficiency. We certainly do \r\nnot despair. We maintain our hope that the achievement \r\nof global peace and stability is within our grasp. We \r\ntherefore wish to see the United Nations serve as the \r\nvoice and spokesperson of the global public \r\nconscience. We believe that a more representative, \r\ndemocratic, transparent, just and effective United \r\nNations will be able to make a greater contribution to \r\nglobal peace and stability. \r\n The United Nations must become a much more \r\neffective institution on such matters as climate change, \r\nsustainable development, the struggle against poverty, \r\ngender equality and the protection of human rights and \r\ndignity, and we fully support reform efforts to that end. \r\nHowever, there is no doubt that the reform of the \r\nUnited Nations system will be incomplete if not \r\naccompanied by Security Council reform. I would like \r\nto underscore once again that Turkey is in favour of \r\nenlarging the non-permanent membership of the \r\nSecurity Council. \r\n Another important aspect of reform that I wish to \r\nunderline is the need to improve the United Nations \r\npeacekeeping system. In this context, we want the \r\nviews and expectations of the United Nations troop-\r\ncontributing countries, in particular, on such issues as \r\nearly and effective coordination, capacity-building and \r\nenhanced cooperation with regional organizations to be \r\ntaken into full account. \r\n Turkey continues to be a force for peace and \r\nstability in its region. Especially in the course of the \r\npast seven years, we have made every effort to settle \r\nour problems with our neighbours. Thanks to this \r\napproach, which we call a zero-problem policy with \r\nour neighbours, Turkey has made significant progress \r\nin solving outstanding issues with its neighbours and \r\nhas greatly improved its bilateral relations. \r\n The problems of our region have global \r\nimplications as well. Therefore, our constructive and \r\npeaceful regional policies serve not only our own \r\nneighbourhood but also world peace. However, we do \r\nnot consider those efforts to be sufficient. We seek to \r\nmove from a relationship of passive good-\r\nneighbourliness to one of active friendship and \r\ncooperation. The positive impact of this approach on \r\nregional and world peace is well appreciated by all our \r\nfriends in the East and the West.  \r\n Another concrete example of this approach is our \r\nongoing dialogue with our neighbour, Greece. Another \r\ncase in point is our quest to normalize our relations \r\nwith Armenia, which has gained fresh momentum of \r\nlate and begun to bear fruit.  \r\n We also believe that the conflicts and disputes in \r\nthe Caucasus, including but not limited to the problems \r\nbetween Armenia and Azerbaijan, are issues that need \r\nto be resolved. In this regard, we hope that our regional \r\npartners will share Turkey’s vision for region-wide \r\npeace, security and stability. We believe that the \r\nCaucasus Stability and Cooperation Platform, which \r\nwe launched in the aftermath of the crisis of August \r\n2008, can make a substantial contribution to efforts in \r\nthat direction. \r\n A/64/PV.5\r\n \r\n33 09-52320 \r\n \r\n Another issue of great interest to us and the world \r\nis Iraq’s territorial integrity, political unity and internal \r\npeace. We attach great importance to the continuation \r\nof the political dialogue process encompassing all \r\ngroups in Iraq and the establishment of national unity. \r\nA clear manifestation of this importance is the \r\nneighbouring countries process regarding Iraq, which \r\nwas initiated by Turkey. \r\n In this connection, I also wish to emphasize the \r\nsignificance of the strategic dialogue mechanism set up \r\nbetween Turkey and Iraq, which is important in terms \r\nof both the fight against terrorism and other aspects of \r\nour bilateral relations. We are fully committed to \r\nmaintaining and further developing this process. \r\n Another area to which Turkey is sensitive is the \r\nPalestinian-Israeli conflict. In our view, the resolution \r\nof the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, based on the vision \r\nof two States existing side by side in peace and \r\nsecurity, is an indispensable element of regional and \r\nglobal peace. The achievement of Palestinian national \r\nunity will expedite the establishment of an independent \r\nPalestinian State. Turkey has always stood by the \r\nPalestinian people and will continue to do so.  \r\n I wish to draw the Assembly’s attention to the \r\nfollowing facts. The aggression against Gaza carried \r\nout at the end of 2008 quickly turned into a human \r\ntragedy and resulted in the deaths of nearly \r\n1,400 people, most of whom were women and children, \r\nas the result of phosphate bombs. Over 5,000 people \r\nwere injured and the infrastructure of Gaza was \r\ncompletely destroyed. Even United Nations buildings \r\nin Gaza did not escape this destruction. Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon personally witnessed the \r\ndevastation and voiced his reaction. The 575-page \r\nUnited Nations report on Gaza (A/HRC/12/48), \r\nreleased on 15 September 2009, clearly confirms this \r\nfact. \r\n It has been eight months since the declaration of \r\nthe ceasefires that ended the hostilities in Gaza and the \r\nadoption of resolution 1860 (2009). Similarly, six \r\nmonths have elapsed since the Sharm el-Sheikh \r\nconference, at which the international community \r\npledged billions of dollars for the reconstruction of \r\nGaza. However, I regret to say that the human tragedy \r\nin Gaza continues.  \r\n People are living in tents and cannot find \r\ndrinking water. In the face of this situation, are we \r\nfulfilling our humanitarian responsibility? What can \r\nthe United Nations or the Security Council do? What \r\nmeasures have the United Nations and the Security \r\nCouncil really enacted? We really must think about that \r\nbecause the promises made in Gaza have not been \r\nfulfilled.  \r\n As at the time of aggression, Gaza has once again \r\nbeen left to its own devices in the aftermath of the \r\nheavy destruction it suffered. Currently, the \r\nimportation of construction materials to Gaza is not \r\npermitted; only food and medication are allowed to \r\npass through, and the suffering of the people of Gaza \r\ncontinues. \r\n We demand that these obstacles be immediately \r\nlifted and normalcy restored to Gaza for the sake of the \r\npeace and security of Israelis and Palestinians alike. \r\nThe Palestinian question cannot be resolved solely by \r\nsatisfying the demands of one party alone. The security \r\nof the Palestinians is as important as the security of \r\nIsrael. The Palestinian people’s quest for freedom and \r\npeace is as legitimate as Israel’s quest for stability. \r\n The settlement of the Palestinian question, which \r\nis one of the greatest obstacles to regional and global \r\npeace, will be possible only when everyone is treated \r\nfairly and equitably. On every possible occasion, \r\nTurkey has stressed that it is not possible to turn a \r\nblind eye to the appalling conditions in Gaza, and we \r\nwill continue to make that point. It is our common \r\nhumanitarian and moral responsibility to ensure that \r\nthe tragedy unfolding in Gaza is brought to an end and \r\nthat an atmosphere of lasting peace is created in the \r\nregion. \r\n It is extremely important that the international \r\ncommunity remain engaged in this matter and inject \r\nnew vigour and momentum into efforts to resolve the \r\nproblem. We call on all parties concerned not to remain \r\nindifferent to this question and not to condone further \r\nsuffering. \r\n We also believe that the resumption of the Israeli-\r\nPalestinian talks, which have been disrupted by the \r\nGaza conflict, is of the utmost importance. We hope \r\nthat the peace process will be revitalized as quickly as \r\npossible. To date, Turkey has made every possible \r\neffort to contribute to the peace process in the Middle \r\nEast. The indirect negotiations between Syria and \r\nIsrael, which we hosted in 2008, are a case in point. \r\nDepending on the mutual desire of both parties, we are \r\nready to resume our active role in the future. \r\nA/64/PV.5 \r\n \r\n09-52320 34 \r\n \r\n We have always said that our neighbouring \r\ncountry Syria is a very important country in our region \r\nand is in a position to play a key role in the search for \r\nregional peace, security and stability. Lebanon, too, is \r\nof critical importance to regional stability. Turkey has \r\nexpended intensive efforts to ensure that a \r\ncomprehensive political compromise prevails in \r\nLebanon. We will continue to strongly support \r\nLebanon’s stability in the future. \r\n We also believe that the dispute over our \r\nneighbour Iran’s nuclear programme, which has long \r\npreoccupied the international community, should be \r\nresolved through dialogue. Turkey defends the right of \r\nall countries to benefit from the peaceful use of nuclear \r\nenergy. On the other hand, we also call on all countries \r\nto act responsibly and to bear in mind the serious \r\nconsequences of the proliferation of nuclear weapons \r\nfor the whole world. In that spirit, we supported the \r\nadoption of Security Council resolution 1874 (2009), \r\non North Korea’s nuclear test last May. \r\n We also closely follow the situation in \r\nAfghanistan and developments in Pakistan. We support \r\nthe struggle against extremism by the peoples of \r\nAfghanistan and Pakistan, with whom we enjoy \r\nhistorical and brotherly ties. We are maintaining our \r\ninfrastructure investments in order to help those two \r\ncountries achieve the prosperity they deserve. The \r\nministerial-level meeting of friends of a democratic \r\nPakistan that we convened in Istanbul in late August is \r\nan indication of the importance we attach to Pakistan’s \r\nstability and prosperity.  \r\n I would like to take this opportunity to announce \r\nthat, in addition to becoming the lead country on \r\nAfghanistan in the Security Council in 2010, we shall \r\nalso assume the chairmanship of the Council’s \r\nCounter-Terrorism Committee. Our strong support for \r\nefforts to achieve security and stability in Afghanistan \r\nand to combat terrorism will continue unabated during \r\nthe course of our performance of those duties on the \r\nCouncil. \r\n The Balkans is another region that we follow \r\nclosely. We believe that the integration of the countries \r\nof the region into Euro-Atlantic institutions is \r\nimportant. That perspective should be maintained. \r\n Turkey and the Turkish Republic of Northern \r\nCyprus support efforts to find a comprehensive \r\nsolution on the island. The basis upon which such a \r\nsolution should be built is right here under the roof of \r\nthe United Nations. If all the parties to the current \r\nnegotiations were to act constructively, it would be \r\npossible to reach a comprehensive solution by the end \r\nof 2009. We believe that the Secretary-General should, \r\nas he did in 2004, play a role in bridging the \r\ndifferences on which the parties themselves cannot \r\nagree. \r\n It should be our common objective to submit the \r\nsolution to be reached to a referendum in the spring of \r\n2010, at the latest. However, at this juncture, I would \r\nalso like to stress that, if a solution cannot be found \r\ndue to Greek Cypriot intransigence, as was the case in \r\n2004, the normalization of the status of the Turkish \r\nRepublic of Northern Cyprus will become a necessity \r\nthat can no longer be delayed. It is therefore essential \r\nto realize that negotiations cannot be sustained \r\nad infinitum, that the current window of opportunity \r\ncannot remain open forever, and that efforts must be \r\ndeployed to ensure the success of the process. \r\n I would also like to take this opportunity to \r\nemphasize once again that a comprehensive solution to \r\nbe achieved on the basis of established United Nations \r\nparameters, which will secure the founding of a new \r\npartnership in Cyprus, will enjoy the open support of \r\nTurkey as a guarantor Power. A fair and lasting \r\nsolution in Cyprus will make a major contribution to \r\nthe transformation of the eastern Mediterranean into a \r\nzone of peace, stability and cooperation. I call upon \r\neveryone to do their utmost to help achieve that goal. \r\n In the meantime, the Turkish Cypriot side is still \r\nsubject to unfair measures of isolation, despite the fact \r\nthat in 2004 it accepted all the sacrifices that the Annan \r\nplan entailed. It is not fair to expect the Turkish side to \r\npay the price for a lack of a solution. The lifting of \r\nsuch restrictions on Turkish Cypriots will not only \r\nremove an unjust practice, but also accelerate the \r\nprocess of resolution. \r\n Turkey continues to participate actively in \r\npeacekeeping operations around the world under the \r\numbrella of the United Nations, NATO, the European \r\nUnion and the Organization for Security and \r\nCooperation in Europe. We also strongly support least \r\ndeveloped and developing countries in their struggle to \r\nresolve development problems. \r\n In addition, as a party to the Kyoto Protocol, \r\nTurkey is ready to live up to its responsibilities with \r\nrespect to a vital issue that concerns the future of our \r\nworld. We support the determined efforts being made \r\n A/64/PV.5\r\n \r\n35 09-52320 \r\n \r\nby the Secretary-General in the process of devising a \r\nnew climate change regime. \r\n I should also like to draw the Assembly’s \r\nattention to another very important issue that poses a \r\nthreat to our world. We should not forget that each \r\nculture and civilization flourishes through the \r\ninspiration provided by the successes of other cultures \r\nand civilizations. As a matter of fact, our common \r\nvalues today, as well as our science, law and art, have \r\nbeen influenced not only by the ancient Greek and \r\nRoman civilizations, but also by ancient Eastern \r\ncivilizations. From Al-Khwarizmi, the father of \r\nalgebra, to Al-Farabi, who laid the foundations of \r\nmusic; from Ibn Sina, who ushered in a new era in \r\nmedicine, to Sinan the architect, who produced the \r\nfinest engineering examples of his time, many Turkish \r\nand Islamic scholars, men of learning and artists have \r\nmade significant contributions to the progress of \r\nhumankind. \r\n It is therefore essential to regard and understand \r\ndiverse cultures not as the other, but as individual \r\nelements of humankind’s cultural inheritance, as well \r\nas to inculcate that spirit in new generations. That is \r\nthe philosophy that underlies the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations, which has become a United Nations \r\ninitiative that has strengthened its institutional \r\nstructure under the co-sponsorship of Turkey and \r\nSpain. I have no doubt that the Alliance will make a \r\nsignificant contribution. We should ensure that it has a \r\nmeaningful place in the Organization, as it can make \r\nimportant contributions to shaping a global civilization \r\nbased on universal values centred on democracy, the \r\nrule of law, good governance, human rights, gender \r\nequality, young people and media. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to express my hope \r\nthat the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly \r\nwill serve the best interests of all humankind, as well \r\nas the interests of peace. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Turkey for the statement he has just made.  \r\n Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Prime Minister of the \r\n Republic of Turkey, was escorted from \r\n the rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime \r\nMinister of the State of Israel \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the State of \r\nIsrael. \r\n Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister of the \r\n State of Israel, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu, \r\nPrime Minister of the State of Israel, and inviting him \r\nto address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Netanyahu (Israel): Nearly 62 years ago, the \r\nUnited Nations recognized the right of the Jews, an \r\nancient people 3,500 years old, to a State of their own \r\nin their ancestral homeland. I stand here today as the \r\nPrime Minister of Israel, the Jewish State, and I speak \r\nto the Assembly on behalf of my country and my \r\npeople. \r\n The United Nations was founded after the \r\ncarnage of the Second World War and the horrors of \r\nthe Holocaust. It was charged with preventing the \r\nreoccurrence of such horrendous events. Nothing has \r\nundermined that mission, nothing has impeded it more, \r\nthan the systematic assault on the truth. Yesterday, the \r\nPresident of Iran stood at this very rostrum spewing his \r\nlatest anti-Semitic rants. Just a few days earlier, he \r\nagain claimed that the Holocaust was a lie. \r\n Last month, I went to a villa in a suburb of Berlin \r\ncalled Wannsee. There, on 20 January 1942, after a \r\nhearty meal, senior Nazi officials met and decided to \r\nexterminate my people. They left detailed minutes of \r\nthat meeting that have been preserved for posterity by \r\nsuccessive German Governments. I have here a copy of \r\nthe minutes of the meeting of senior Nazi officials \r\ninstructing the Nazi Government exactly how to carry \r\nout the extermination of the Jewish people. Is that \r\nprotocol a lie? Are the German Government and all \r\nGerman Governments lying? \r\n The day before I was in Wannsee, in Berlin I was \r\ngiven the original construction plans for the \r\nAuschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. I now hold in \r\nmy hand the Auschwitz-Birkenau plans. They contain \r\nthe signature of Heinrich Himmler, Hitler’s deputy, \r\nhimself. Are those plans for the Auschwitz-Birkenau \r\nconcentration camp, where 1 million Jews were \r\nmurdered, a lie too? In June, President Obama visited \r\nanother concentration camp, one of many — the \r\nA/64/PV.5 \r\n \r\n09-52320 36 \r\n \r\nBuchenwald concentration camp. Did President Obama \r\npay tribute to a lie? \r\n And what of the Auschwitz survivors, whose \r\narms still bear the tattooed numbers branded on them \r\nby the Nazis? Are those tattoos a lie, too? One third of \r\nall Jews perished in the great conflagration of the \r\nHolocaust. Nearly every Jewish family, including my \r\nown, was affected. My wife’s grandparents, her \r\nfather’s two sisters and three brothers, and all the \r\naunts, uncles and cousins were murdered by the Nazis. \r\nIs that a lie?   \r\n Yesterday, the man who calls the Holocaust a lie \r\nspoke from this rostrum. I commend those who refused \r\nto come and those who left in protest. They stood up \r\nfor moral clarity and brought honour to their countries. \r\nBut to those who gave that denier of the Holocaust a \r\nhearing, I say on behalf of my people, the Jewish \r\npeople, and of decent people everywhere: Have they no \r\nshame? Have they no decency? A mere six decades \r\nafter the Holocaust, they give legitimacy to a man who \r\ndenies the murder of 6 million Jews, while promising \r\nto wipe out the State of Israel, the State of the Jews. \r\n That is a disgrace. It is a mockery of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations. Perhaps some representatives \r\nthink that that man and his odious regime threaten only \r\nthe Jews. If they believe that, they are wrong — dead \r\nwrong. History has shown us time and again that what \r\nstarts with attacks on the Jews eventually ends up \r\nengulfing many, many others.  \r\n For this Iranian regime is fuelled by an extreme \r\nfundamentalism that burst onto the world scene three \r\ndecades ago after lying dormant for centuries. In the \r\npast 30 years, that fanaticism has swept across the \r\nglobe with a murderous violence that knows no bounds \r\nand with a cold-blooded impartiality in the choice of \r\nits victims. It has callously slaughtered Muslims, \r\nChristians, Jews, Hindus and many others. The \r\nadherents of that unforgiving creed, although it is \r\ncomprised of different offshoots, seek to return \r\nhumanity to medieval times. Wherever they can, they \r\nimpose a backward, regimented society where women, \r\nminorities, gays or anyone else deemed not to be a true \r\nbeliever is brutally subjugated.  \r\n The struggle against that fanaticism does not pit \r\nfaith against faith, or civilization against civilization. It \r\npits civilization against barbarism, the twenty-first \r\ncentury against the ninth, and those who sanctify life \r\nagainst those who glorify death. The primitivism of the \r\nninth century ought to be no match for the progress of \r\nthe twenty-first. The allure of freedom, the power of \r\ntechnology and the reach of communications should \r\nsurely win the day. Ultimately, the past cannot triumph \r\nover the future, and our future offers all nations \r\nmagnificent bounties of hope because the pace of \r\nprogress is growing, and growing exponentially.  \r\n It took us centuries to get from the printing press \r\nto the telephone, decades to get from the telephone to \r\nthe personal computer, and only a few years to get \r\nfrom the personal computer to the Internet. What \r\nseemed impossible a few years ago is already outdated, \r\nand we can scarcely fathom the changes that are yet to \r\ncome. We will crack the genetic code. We will cure the \r\nincurable. We will lengthen our lives. We will find a \r\ncheap alternative to fossil fuel, and we will clean up \r\nthe planet.    \r\n I am proud that my country, Israel, is at the \r\nforefront of many of those advances in science and \r\ntechnology, medicine and biology, agriculture and \r\nwater, and energy and the environment. Those \r\ninnovations in my country and in many others offer \r\nhumanity a sunlit future of unimagined promise. \r\n However, if the most primitive fanaticism can \r\nacquire the most deadly weapons, the march of history \r\ncould be reversed for a time and, like the belated \r\nvictory over the Nazis, the forces of progress and \r\nfreedom prevail only after a horrific toll of blood and \r\nfortune has been exacted from mankind. That is why \r\nthe greatest threat facing the world today is the \r\nmarriage between religious fundamentalism and the \r\nweapons of mass destruction.  \r\n The most urgent challenge facing this body today \r\nis to prevent the tyrants of Tehran from acquiring \r\nnuclear weapons. Are the Members of the United \r\nNations up to that challenge? Will the international \r\ncommunity confront a despotism that terrorizes its own \r\npeople as they bravely stand up for freedom? Will it \r\ntake action against the dictators who stole an election \r\nin broad daylight and then gunned down Iranian \r\nprotesters, who died on the sidewalks and in the streets \r\nchoking in their own blood? Will the international \r\ncommunity thwart the world’s most pernicious sponsor \r\nand practitioner of terrorism? Above all, will the \r\ninternational community stop the terrorist regime of \r\nIran from developing atomic weapons and thereby \r\nendangering the peace of the entire world? \r\n A/64/PV.5\r\n \r\n37 09-52320 \r\n \r\n The people of Iran are courageously standing up \r\nto this regime. People of goodwill around the world \r\nstand with them, as do the thousands who have been \r\nprotesting outside this Hall throughout the week. Will \r\nthe United Nations stand with them? \r\n The jury is still out on the United Nations. Recent \r\nsigns are not encouraging. Rather than condemning the \r\nterrorists and their Iranian patrons, some here in the \r\nUnited Nations have condemned their victims. This is \r\nexactly what a recent United Nations report on Gaza \r\ndid, falsely equating the terrorists with those they \r\ntargeted. \r\n For eight long years, Hamas fired rockets from \r\nGaza on nearby Israeli cities and citizens — thousands \r\nof missiles and mortars hailing down from the sky on \r\nschools, homes, shopping centres and bus stops. Year \r\nafter year, as these missiles were deliberately fired on \r\nour civilians, not one single United Nations resolution \r\nwas passed condemning those criminal attacks. We \r\nheard nothing — absolutely nothing — from the \r\nHuman Rights Council of the United Nations, a \r\nmisnamed institution if ever there was one. \r\n In 2005, hoping to advance peace, Israel \r\nunilaterally withdrew from every inch of Gaza. It was \r\nvery painful. We dismantled 21 settlements, really \r\nbedroom communities and farms. We uprooted over \r\n8,000 Israelis; we just yanked them out of their homes. \r\nWe did this because many in Israel believed that it \r\nwould win peace. Well, we did not get peace. Instead \r\nwe got an Iranian-backed terror base 50 miles from \r\nTel Aviv. But life in the Israeli towns and cities \r\nimmediately adjacent to Gaza became nothing less than \r\na nightmare. The Hamas rocket attacks not only \r\ncontinued after we left, they actually increased \r\ndramatically. They increased tenfold. And again, the \r\nUnited Nations was silent — absolutely silent. \r\n Well, after eight years of this unremitting assault, \r\nIsrael was finally forced to respond. But how should \r\nwe have responded? There is only one example in \r\nhistory of thousands of rockets being fired on a \r\ncountry’s civilian population. This happened when the \r\nNazis rocketed British cities during the Second World \r\nWar. During that war, the Allies levelled German cities, \r\ncausing hundreds of thousands of casualties. I am not \r\npassing judgement; I am stating a fact, a fact that is the \r\nproduct of the decisions of great and honourable \r\nmen — the leaders of Britain and the United States — \r\nfighting an evil force in the Second World War. \r\n It is also a fact that Israel chose to respond \r\ndifferently. Faced with an enemy committing a double \r\nwar crime — firing on civilians while hiding behind \r\ncivilians — Israel sought to conduct surgical strikes \r\nagainst the rocket-launchers themselves. That was no \r\neasy task because the terrorists were firing their \r\nmissiles from homes and schools, using mosques as \r\nweapons depots and missile caches, and ferreting \r\nexplosives in ambulances. \r\n Israel, by contrast, tried to minimize casualties by \r\nurging Palestinian civilians to vacate the targeted \r\nareas. We dropped countless flyers over their homes. \r\nWe sent thousands and thousands of text messages to \r\nthe Palestinian residents. We made thousands and \r\nthousands of cellular phone calls urging them to \r\nvacate, to leave. Never has a country gone to such \r\nextraordinary lengths to remove the enemy’s civilian \r\npopulation from harm’s way.  \r\n Yet faced with an absolutely clear-cut case of \r\naggressor and victim, who do you think the United \r\nNations Human Rights Council decided to condemn? \r\nIsrael. A democracy legitimately defending itself \r\nagainst terror is morally hanged, drawn and quartered, \r\nand given an unfair trial to boot. By these twisted \r\nstandards, the Human Rights Council would have \r\ndragged Roosevelt and Churchill to the dock as war \r\ncriminals. What a perversion of truth! What a \r\nperversion of justice! \r\n The delegates to the United Nations and the \r\nGovernments that they represent have a decision to \r\nmake. Will they accept this farce? Because if they do, \r\nthe United Nations would revert to its darkest days, \r\nwhen the worst violators of human rights sat in \r\njudgement against the law-abiding democracies, when \r\nZionism was equated with racism and when an \r\nautomatic majority could be mustered to declare that \r\nthe Earth is flat. If you had to choose a date when the \r\nUnited Nations began its descent, almost a freefall, and \r\nlost the respect of many thoughtful people in the \r\ninternational community, it was the day in 1975 it \r\ndecided to equate Zionism with racism. \r\n Now this body has a choice to make. If it does \r\nnot reject this biased report, it would vitiate itself, it \r\nwould recommence the process of vitiating its own \r\nrelevance and importance. But it would also do \r\nsomething else. It would send the message to terrorists \r\neverywhere that terrorism pays: all you have to do is \r\nA/64/PV.5 \r\n \r\n09-52320 38 \r\n \r\nlaunch your attacks from densely populated areas, and \r\nyou will win immunity. \r\n A third point: in condemning Israel, this body \r\nwould also deal a mortal blow to peace. Let me explain \r\nwhy. When Israel left Gaza, many hoped that the \r\nmissile attacks would stop. Others believed that, even \r\nif they did not stop, at the very least Israel, in having \r\nmade this extraordinary gesture for peace, would have \r\ninternational legitimacy to exercise its right of self-\r\ndefence if peace failed. What legitimacy? What self-\r\ndefence? \r\n The same United Nations that cheered Israel as it \r\nleft Gaza and promised to back our right of self-\r\ndefence now accuses us — my people, my country — \r\nof being war criminals? And for what? For acting \r\nresponsibly in self-defence? For acting in a way that \r\nany country would act, with a restraint unmatched by \r\nmany? What a travesty! \r\n Israel justly defended itself against terror. This \r\nbiased and unjust report provides a clear-cut test for all \r\nGovernments. Will the Assembly stand with Israel or \r\nwill it stand with the terrorists? We must know the \r\nanswer to that question now. Now, not later. Because if \r\nIsrael is again asked to take more risks for peace, we \r\nmust know today that the Assembly will stand with us \r\ntomorrow. Only if we have the confidence that we can \r\ndefend ourselves can we take further risks for peace. \r\n Make no mistake: all of Israel wants peace. Any \r\ntime an Arab leader genuinely wanted peace with us, \r\nwe made peace. We made peace with Egypt led by \r\nAnwar Sadat. We made peace with Jordan led by King \r\nHussein. And if the Palestinians truly want peace, my \r\nGovernment and I, and my people, will make peace. \r\nBut we want a genuine peace, a defensible peace, a \r\npermanent peace.  \r\n In 1947, this body voted to establish two States \r\nfor two peoples — a Jewish State and an Arab State. \r\nThe Jews accepted that resolution. The Arabs rejected \r\nit and invaded the embryonic Jewish State with the \r\nhopes of annihilating it. \r\n We ask the Palestinians to finally do what they \r\nhave refused to do for 62 years: say yes to a Jewish \r\nState. It is as simple, as clear and as elementary as that. \r\nJust as we are asked to recognize a nation-State of the \r\nPalestinian people, the Palestinians must be asked to \r\nrecognize the nation-State of the Jewish people. The \r\nJewish people are not foreign conquerors in the Land \r\nof Israel. It is the land of our forefathers. \r\n Inscribed on the walls outside this building is the \r\ngreat Biblical vision of peace: “Nation shall not lift up \r\nsword against nation. They shall learn war no more.” \r\nThese words were spoken by the great Jewish prophet \r\nIsaiah 2,800 years ago as he walked in my country, in \r\nmy city, in the hills of Judea and in the streets of \r\nJerusalem.  \r\n We are not strangers to this land. This is our \r\nhomeland. But as deeply connected as we are to our \r\nhomeland, we also recognize that the Palestinians also \r\nlive there and they want a home of their own. We want \r\nto live side by side with them — two free peoples \r\nliving in peace, living in prosperity, living in dignity.  \r\n Peace, prosperity and dignity require one other \r\nelement: we must have security. The Palestinians \r\nshould have all the powers to govern themselves except \r\na handful of powers that could endanger Israel. That is \r\nwhy the Palestinian State must be effectively \r\ndemilitarized. I say “effectively” because we do not \r\nwant another Gaza, another south Lebanon, another \r\nIranian-backed terror base abutting Jerusalem and \r\nperched on the hills a few kilometres from Tel Aviv. \r\n We want peace. I believe that with goodwill and \r\nwith hard work such a peace can be achieved. But it \r\nrequires that all of us roll back the forces of terror led \r\nby Iran that seek to destroy peace, that seek to \r\neliminate Israel and to overthrow the world order.  The \r\nquestion facing the international community is whether \r\nit is prepared to confront those forces, or will it \r\naccommodate them. \r\n Over 70 years ago, Winston Churchill lamented \r\nwhat he called the “confirmed unteachability of \r\nmankind”. By that he meant the unfortunate habit of \r\ncivilized societies to sleep and to slumber until danger \r\nnearly overtakes them. Churchill bemoaned what he \r\ncalled the  \r\n “want of foresight, unwillingness to act when \r\naction would be simple and effective, lack of \r\nclear thinking, confusion of counsel until the \r\nemergency comes, until self-preservation strikes \r\nits jarring gong …”. \r\n I speak here today in the hope that Churchill’s \r\nassessment of the “unteachability of mankind” is for \r\nonce proven wrong. I speak here today in the hope that \r\n A/64/PV.5\r\n \r\n39 09-52320 \r\n \r\nwe can learn from history, that we can prevent danger \r\nin time. \r\n In the spirit of the timeless words spoken to \r\nJoshua over 3,000 years ago, let us be strong and of \r\ngood courage.  Let us confront this peril, secure our \r\nfuture and, God willing, forge an enduring peace for \r\ngenerations to come. \r\n(spoke in Hebrew) \r\n May God bless his people with peace; may God  \r\ngive strength to his people; may God bless his people \r\nwith peace. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nState of Israel for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister of the \r\nState of Israel, was escorted from the rostrum. \r\nThe meeting rose at 1.40 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
