(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Hugo Rafael Chávez Frías, President \r\nof the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela. \r\n Mr. Hugo Rafael Chávez Frías, President of the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela, was escorted \r\ninto the General Assembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Hugo Rafael Chávez Frías, \r\nPresident of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, and \r\nto invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Chávez Frías (spoke in Spanish): I \r\ngreet all the citizens of the world who have come \r\nhere — as they do every year — for this gathering of \r\nsuch great importance for the world. I am very pleased \r\nto be back in New York and at the United Nations \r\nfollowing a few years’ absence. I am very grateful for \r\nall the cooperation and the manner in which our \r\ndelegation has been received.  \r\n Last night we visited Lincoln Center to see a film \r\nmade by Oliver Stone during the past year. The title of \r\nthe film already stirs your thoughts. It is called “South \r\nof the Border”. In this film, you can see President Evo \r\nMorales chewing coca leaves, together with Oliver \r\nStone. And, as President Morales says, coca is not the \r\nsame as cocaine. You can see Cristina, the President of \r\nArgentina, and the automobile of General Perón. You \r\ncan hear what she has to say about events in South \r\nAmerica, in Latin America. And you can see Lula, the \r\nPresident of Brazil, in the Guajira region of Venezuela, \r\nworking with us to help the indigenous peoples, who \r\nwere exploited for centuries, through core industrial \r\nprojects. You will see President Fernando Lugo, a \r\nbishop and liberation theologian, living today in the \r\nresidence occupied for many years by Stroessner. And \r\nyou can see how a bishop became a president.  \r\n You can also see Rafael Correa, the President of \r\nEcuador, in Havana with President Raúl Castro. You \r\ncan see Fidel. You can even see Obama, in Trinidad, \r\nchatting with a group of us, with his hand held out to \r\nus and an open smile. \r\n I think it is an interesting film, one of the many \r\nmade by this great filmmaker of the United States, \r\nOliver Stone. He had already made two films about \r\nFidel, “Looking for Fidel” and “El Comandante”. \r\nThere is a lot in this film, many messages that could \r\nhelp us to decipher the enigmas of the times in which \r\nwe live.  \r\n We stayed behind after the film was over last \r\nnight, chatting with a group of people from the United \r\nStates and other parts of the world. And this contact \r\nwas very instructive and very symptomatic of the \r\nimportance of what Fidel calls “the battle of ideas”. A \r\nlady in her fifties came up to me and said “I am very \r\nhappy”. She was a North American, very white; a \r\ntypical United States citizen, born in this country, but \r\nshe spoke some Spanish. She told me, “I am very \r\nA/64/PV.6  \r\n \r\n09-52425 2 \r\n \r\nhappy”. And I asked her why. “Because, now having \r\nseen this movie, I realize what you are. I thought you \r\nwere a very bad person”.  \r\n This person was a victim of the hostile media \r\nbombardment, the ideological bombardment, of the \r\nUnited States and of the entire world, whose aim is to \r\nturn reality inside out and to turn the world upside \r\ndown, as Eduardo Galeano put it. \r\n The film is called “South of the Border” and I am \r\ntaking advantage of this opportunity and that title to \r\ntell you that, south of the border, a revolution is under \r\nway. A revolution is under way in South America. A \r\nrevolution is under way in Latin America. There is a \r\nrevolution in the Caribbean. The world must see this, it \r\nmust truly realize this and accept it, because it is a \r\nreality and it is not going to change. What is more, this \r\nis a revolution that goes beyond ideology. It is a \r\ngeographical and geopolitical revolution. It is a historic \r\nrevolution; it is part of our times. It has very deep \r\nroots. It is a total, moral and spiritual revolution. And \r\nwe believe that it is a necessary revolution. This \r\nrevolution is great in both spirit and magnitude, and it \r\nis going to keep growing as the days, months and years \r\ngo by. And why is it great? It is great because it has \r\nbeen a long time coming: centuries of history have led \r\nup to this moment in time. It is great in terms of the \r\nspace that it covers. \r\n I am not going to speak any longer than  \r\nMr. Al-Qadhafi. Al-Qadhafi has said everything there \r\nis to say. This applause is for Al-Qadhafi and his \r\nspeech. But nor will I speak any less than Mr. Obama, \r\nor Lula.  \r\n I was explaining why this revolution is great. \r\nFirst, because of time, the accumulated time that has \r\ngone by. It is centuries, centuries of battles, of \r\nstruggles, of hopes, of suffering of millions and \r\nmillions of human beings in Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean. This revolution is great in the area it \r\ncovers. This revolution is great in the depth of its \r\nfoundations. This revolution is great in the masses of \r\npeople that are joining it. No one seeks to slow it down \r\nand no one will be able to. \r\n Yesterday, it was said by President Morales here \r\n(see A/64/PV.5), by this great companion and \r\nindigenous leader of the Aymara, Evo Morales. He also \r\nsaid it in the film, which you should not miss, “South \r\nof the Border”. Oliver Stone told me last night that \r\npressure is already being exerted to prevent the \r\nAmerican people from seeing it. Where is their \r\nfreedom of expression? It is just a movie. How can \r\nthey be afraid of a movie? But there is already pressure \r\nfrom the monopolies that run the film industry, that \r\noperate the theatres — these are all monopolies and \r\nthey are putting on pressure. But the movie will be \r\nshown elsewhere. Fortunately, we are in the age of \r\ncomputers and telecommunications. We no longer \r\ndepend on movie theatres run by monopolies.  \r\n In the film, Evo, speaking with Oliver Stone, \r\nrecalls a phrase pronounced by a great leader of the \r\nAymara, an ancestor of his who was murdered, just one \r\nof the many millions that were murdered by the \r\nSpanish, Portuguese and English invasion, by the \r\nEuropean invasion of our continent. I know that all \r\npresent are aware that when the European ships arrived \r\nat the American shores there were approximately \r\n90 million indigenous people living here.  \r\n Two hundred years later only four million \r\nsurvived. This is one of the greatest genocides in \r\nhistory — the genocide of the continent itself, of the \r\nAbya Yala, as our indigenous people call it. So Evo in \r\nthe movie repeats the sentence uttered by this great \r\nAymara leader, who was drawn and quartered — he \r\nwas tied to four horses by the arms and legs and he was \r\ntorn apart, and as he died the Indian uttered a \r\nprophesy: “Today I die,” said Túpac Katari, “today I \r\ndie, but one day I will return as millions.” Túpac Katari \r\nhas returned, and we are millions. We are millions. \r\n Nothing and no one can hold back the great South \r\nAmerican, Latin American, Caribbean revolution. And \r\nI think the world should support it. The United States \r\nshould support it. Europe should support it, because \r\nthis revolution — some brothers and sisters may not \r\nhave noticed — is the start of the road to salvation for \r\nthis planet, and to salvation for the human race, \r\nthreatened as it is by capitalism, imperialism, hunger \r\nand war. This is the necessary revolution. For centuries \r\nthis has been called “the New World”. Now we can \r\ntruly call it “a new world”. \r\n Years ago — as we recalled last night — I was \r\ninvited to a conversation — a large group of important \r\nleaders. They were important in their own right. They \r\nwere trade union leaders here in the United States. \r\nSome workers were complaining about a biscuit \r\nfactory that was not paying them. They were striking, \r\nand one of them asked me, “Why don’t you buy that \r\nfactory?” And I said, “I’ll see. Maybe we can make it a \r\n A/64/PV.6\r\n \r\n3 09-52425 \r\n \r\nsocialist biscuit factory, if Obama gives me permission. \r\nMaybe we could do that — buy it, give it to the \r\nworkers, let them make the crackers and distribute \r\nthem. Why should there just be one or two capitalists \r\nexploiting a lot of people?” That is socialism and that \r\nis the path to salvation for this planet. \r\n Yesterday a journalist asked me — after the \r\nmovie there was forum at which he asked me — “Do \r\nyou defend socialism even though the Soviet Union \r\nfailed?” The reply is very simple. The Soviet Union \r\nlost its way early on. There was never real socialism in \r\nthe Soviet Union. But this century, the twenty-first \r\ncentury, will be the century of socialism — the \r\nsocialism of the human race.  \r\n I’m sure everyone listening to me has read \r\nEinstein. Albert Einstein convinced the American \r\nPresident to build the atomic bomb — to begin the \r\nresearch before the Nazis did. Then later he regretted \r\nwhat he had done when he saw the disaster of \r\nHiroshima and the disaster of Nagasaki. But Albert \r\nEinstein, after all his years of study, the great scientist, \r\namong the greatest scientists ever to have walked the \r\nEarth, came to the conclusion — and this is written in \r\nhis own hand — “Why socialism?” Einstein came to \r\nthe conclusion that the only way for the human race to \r\nlive on this planet is socialism. Capitalism is the road \r\nto extinction of the human species. We as a species \r\nhave only been around for what? This is Castro \r\nterritory, he knows these figures. But, whereas life first \r\nappeared here at least three billion years ago, we the \r\nhuman species only appeared maybe less than 300,000 \r\nyears ago, hardly 0.01 per cent of the time that life has \r\nexisted on this planet. So we appear after so long and \r\nwe’re going to wipe out life on this planet? \r\n We’ve heard it from everybody — Obama, Lula, \r\nCristina Fernández, Al-Qadhafi, Sarkozy — everyone \r\nsaid the same thing. They have all clamoured for \r\nchange. And what is the change? Capitalism allows no \r\nchange. Let us not fool ourselves. It’s only through \r\nsocialism that we can bring about genuine change. And \r\nthe revolution in Latin America has it all and it has a \r\nstrong socialist element. As Mariátequi, the great \r\nPeruvian thinker said, it is an Indian-American \r\nsocialism. It is our own socialism. It is a Bolivarian \r\nsocialism. It is a José Martí socialism. It is a new \r\nsocialism. It has not been copied from anybody else. \r\nThere are no manuals for socialism, said Mariátequi. It \r\nis a heroic creation that has to be constantly reinvented. \r\n Yesterday we were remembering what a North \r\nAmerican President, that is to say a United States \r\nPresident, said shortly before he was assassinated, and \r\nthis is on the record, in a speech before the United \r\nStates Congress. John Kennedy spoke of a revolution \r\nin the South, saying that the principal cause was \r\nhunger. Only a few days later he was assassinated. \r\nJohn Kennedy was not a revolutionary, but he was an \r\nintelligent man, just as I think President Obama is an \r\nintelligent man. And I hope God protects Obama from \r\nthe bullets that killed Kennedy. I hope Obama will be \r\nable to look and see — genuinely see — what has to be \r\nseen. It does not smell of sulphur here anymore. That \r\nsmell has gone. It smells of something else — it smells \r\nof hope. And you have to have hope in your heart and \r\nbelieve in the hope.  \r\n We cannot destroy this planet. What about our \r\nchildren? What about future generations? Come, let’s \r\ntake on the challenge. Lula was saying yesterday that \r\nthere was no political will. Those words were whips. I \r\nknow Lula’s will. I am deeply aware of his humane \r\nattitude. He is a true brother of mine, and he was right \r\nto say what he said. But I would not exactly say that \r\nthere is no political will. I would say rather that some \r\npolitical will is lacking, because Lula has it and we \r\nhave it, but it has to be increased. It has to continue to \r\ngrow in the leaders, in society, among the people, \r\namong the youth — particularly in the hearts of the \r\nyoung — and the workers, everywhere in the world.  \r\n Kennedy said it: there is a revolution in the \r\nSouth. And he added, “Those who make peaceful \r\nrevolution impossible will make violent revolution \r\ninevitable”. Jack Kennedy said that. You can find it on \r\nthe Internet; you can find everything on the Internet. \r\n My dear Maria Fernanda Espinosa, once \r\nambassador from fraternal Ecuador, whom I have not \r\nseen for days. We’d like to say hello to President \r\nCorrea. The ambassador was Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs at the beginning of the citizens’ revolution, \r\nwith Correa leading the people of Ecuador, the people \r\nof Manuela Saenz and Bolivar and Eloy Alfaro, the \r\nnoble and great people in Bolivia and that whole area. \r\n Some are trying to block the path to our peaceful \r\nrevolution. And there’s another brave woman, Patricia \r\nRodas, the Foreign Minister of Honduras; please, a \r\nhand for this brave Central American woman, from the \r\npeople of Morazán. Long live Honduras! Long live \r\nMorazán! And long live the dignity of the people!  \r\nA/64/PV.6  \r\n \r\n09-52425 4 \r\n \r\n At 1 p.m. exactly, I was jotting down these \r\nnotes — I don’t have much farther to go, Mr. President; \r\ndon’t anybody throw a shoe at me. The Cuban Minister \r\nhas taken off his shoe to throw it at me. He had some \r\nrubber shoes — if you are going to throw me a shoe, \r\nthrow one of those. I spoke to Manuel Zelaya at 1 p.m. \r\nsharp; I remember it was 1 p.m. sharp — we started at \r\n1 and finished at 1.13. \r\n While we are here, comrades of the world, there \r\nis a President, firm, dignified, who with a small group \r\nof people, almost martyrs, was able to escape those \r\ntrying to carry out a coup d’état. The perpetrators of \r\nthe coup had brought repression to the Plaza Morazán \r\nin Tegucigalpa and had taken every single road. They \r\nhad an entire army; it was as if they had invaded \r\nHonduras with their own army — what an indignity. \r\nFrom here I make an appeal — I, who am a \r\nrevolutionary soldier — to the soldiers of Honduras, to \r\nthe sons of Morazán to not continue to repress an \r\ninnocent people. \r\n While we are here, Manuel Zelaya, the President \r\nof Honduras, is in the Brazilian embassy, which has \r\ngiven him refuge. According to what the President has \r\ntold me, there are more than 200 soldiers surrounding \r\nthe embassy in the most brutal fashion. Were they \r\ntrying to go back to the Stone Age? It will not work. Is \r\nthat what the perpetrators of the coup d’état had in \r\nmind? They will be swept away by the wind of the new \r\nage. The coup cannot succeed, these regressive forces \r\ncannot have their way, not in Honduras, not in any of \r\nthe countries of the Americas. These people have been \r\nout in the streets for 90 days, resisting, resisting, \r\nresisting. \r\n So, there we have a President, firm in his \r\nconviction, with a group of compatriots, with his wife, \r\nthe First Lady. Apparently they are not letting food \r\nthrough; the water is cut off every now and then. \r\nLuckily there is a cistern with water. This morning they \r\nwere able to get some of the most up-to-date telephone \r\ninterception equipment, which the President told me is \r\nan Israeli brand. Israel has recognized the coup d’état \r\nGovernment; I think it is the only country in the world \r\nthat has. They have all kinds of equipment to block \r\nsignals and jam communications, and they are also \r\ntrying to create panic among the few people inside the \r\nBrazilian embassy, threatening them with incursion \r\ninto the embassy. Does the Assembly realize how \r\nretrograde this is? It is like some kind of trolls or dark \r\ngiants or magicians, something from the age of the \r\ncavemen. But they will not return. \r\n The people are in the street, protesting. The \r\nairport is closed now. Who is behind the coup d’état? It \r\nis the Honduran bourgeoisie; the State is taken over by \r\nthe bourgeoisie, by the rich. Four or five wealthy, \r\npowerful families own the State. I think we have to \r\npull out our copies of Lenin, his State and Revolution, \r\nwhere he talks about the bourgeois State, the control of \r\neverything by the bourgeois State including the \r\nnational congress, the judiciary, the army. \r\n The people are in the street, but they are being \r\nfired on. Yesterday the President told me that he knows \r\nof at least three people in the vicinity of the Brazilian \r\nembassy who were killed. And the President is asking \r\nfor dialogue, so as to return to the road to democracy. \r\nSo let us send the expression of our strongest solidarity \r\nto the people of Honduras and President Zelaya, and let \r\nus ask that the United Nations resolution be complied \r\nwith, and the resolution of the Organization of \r\nAmerican States. \r\n The United States Government — and this is \r\nstrange — has not recognized that a military coup \r\nd’état has occurred. President Zelaya told me today \r\nthat there is some friction between the State \r\nDepartment and the Pentagon. Yesterday I was reading \r\nPentagonism, a book by the great Dominican author \r\nJuan Bosch, who was overthrown by imperialism. The \r\nPentagon is the imperial cave. They do not want \r\nObama. They do not want change. They want to \r\ndominate the world with their military bases, with all \r\ntheir threats, their bombs, their soldiers and bases. \r\n The Pentagon is behind the coup in Honduras. \r\nPresident Zelaya was dragged out of his home, out of \r\nhis bed, at dawn on 28 June, taken to a plane, bundled \r\nup by Honduran soldiers under command from the \r\nUnited States base there, in Palmerola. The plane took \r\noff from Tegucigalpa and landed at the Palmerola base. \r\nThey held the Honduran President there for some time. \r\nThen they decided to take him to Costa Rica. The \r\nAmerican military in Honduras knew about the coup; \r\nthey supported it. They supported the Honduran \r\nmilitary. Hence the contradictions that Obama has to \r\nface. \r\n At times we wonder if are there two Obamas — \r\nthe one who spoke here yesterday and the other — a \r\ndouble? The one who supports, or allows his military \r\nto support, the coup on Honduras? I want to present \r\n A/64/PV.6\r\n \r\n5 09-52425 \r\n \r\nthis question for thought. Is there one Obama, or are \r\nthere two? Let us hope the one we heard yesterday will \r\nprevail. That is what the world needs; that is what the \r\nworld is calling for. \r\n What is the backdrop of the coup in Honduras? It \r\nhas to do with everything we are talking about here — \r\nit is the revolution of the South. It is not the kind of \r\nrevolution where there are columns of guerrillas, \r\nheroes such as in the Sierra Maestra, heroes of the high \r\nmountains of Bolivia, where Ernesto Che Guevara was. \r\n But this is not that kind of revolution. This \r\nrevolution is different. It does not break out in the \r\nmountains with guerrilla groups. No, it starts in the \r\ntowns among the masses. It is a mass revolution, but it \r\nis peaceful and wants to remain peaceful. It is \r\ndemocratic, deeply democratic. \r\n Do not be afraid of democracy. Here, I am \r\nparaphrasing Noam Chomsky in another wonderful \r\nwork that I did not know until I obtained the book in \r\nMadrid a few days ago. I went to visit my friend, the \r\nKing of Spain, mainly because an Ibero-American \r\nsummit was coming up in Portugal, and I said that I \r\nwould go if he did not tell me to shut up. He told me \r\nthat he would not. So, I am going. King Juan Carlos \r\nand I are great friends. I went to a recommended \r\nbookshop — La Casa del Libro — in Madrid, and I got \r\nChomsky’s book Fear of Democracy. We should all \r\nread that book, Fear of Democracy.  \r\n The elite are afraid of the people. They are afraid \r\nof true democracy, which Abraham Lincoln, another \r\nmartyr, defined very clearly in three ideas: democracy \r\nis government of the people, by the people and for the \r\npeople. It is not government of the bourgeoisie or of \r\nthe elite when the people rise up and the thugs are \r\npushed out. That happened in Honduras, and in \r\nVenezuela in 2002. It happened in Brazil with João \r\nGoulart, and in the Dominican Republic. Why were the \r\npeoples of Latin America and of the Caribbean not \r\nallowed to build their own future in the twentieth \r\ncentury? They did not let them.  \r\n This century is ours. This century, in Latin \r\nAmerica and in the Caribbean we will build our own \r\nway and no one can stop it. No one can stop it. \r\nImperialism must end. At times, one wonders. I was \r\nonce asking Lula what America, our Latin America, \r\nwould be today if the Governments of the United States \r\nhad not dug their claws into our America to impose a \r\nmodel by violently cutting off the hope and the \r\nstruggle of millions of people, extinguishing the dawn. \r\n I was born in 1954. Fidel was already in prison, \r\nand they were dropping bombs in Guatemala. They \r\ninvaded the Guatemala of Jacobo Árbenz Guzmán; and \r\nthen the Bay of Pigs, although they failed there; then \r\nthis revolutionary Cuba — admirable, but blockaded.  \r\n I call on Obama to lift the blockade on Cuba. \r\nWhat is he waiting for? Let him do what he says. Or \r\nare there two Obamas? Yesterday, Obama said, and I \r\nnoted it — here, I noted down Lula, who spoke before \r\nObama, and then I noted Obama’s words — that a \r\npolitical system cannot be imposed on any people and \r\nthat each people and its sovereignty must be respected. \r\nThen what is President Obama waiting for to order the \r\nlifting of the brutal and murderous blockade on Cuba? \r\nDoes anyone have doubts about that? Does anyone \r\nthink that it is rhetorical? No. There is persecution \r\nagainst businesses in any part of the world that provide \r\neven food to Cuba, and now also to Venezuela.  \r\n Not long ago, Fidel Castro mentioned in one of \r\nhis reflections that a company known throughout the \r\nworld that manufactures and supplies medical \r\nequipment did not meet its obligations to the \r\nGovernments of Cuba or of Venezuela this past year or \r\nthe one before. They did not send the spare parts for \r\nhundreds of pieces of medical equipment that the two \r\nGovernments had bought to bring free quality health \r\ncare to our peoples. These include 64-row CT scanners \r\nand electrocardiogram machines that are now in the \r\npoor areas of Caracas. Where the indigenous people \r\nlive, there are medical facilities. We have 30,000 \r\nCuban doctors there and a free, good health-care \r\nsystem for the people. We tried to quietly find solutions \r\nwith the company — Philips — but the company has \r\nrefused to send the spare parts for that high-tech \r\nequipment. Why? Under pressure from whom? From \r\nthe Government of the United States? Is it this Obama \r\nor another Obama? Is it Obama one or Obama two? \r\nWho are you, Obama? Who are you? I want to believe \r\nin yesterday’s Obama, whom I saw here, but these \r\nthings keep happening, and they affect the lives of \r\nmillions of human beings. Why? In whose name? Why \r\ndoes the United States continue to do that? \r\n It is fear of democracy, just as happened in \r\nHonduras. It is the fear of the Bolivarian Alliance for \r\nthe Americas that rises up as a new and innovative \r\nmechanism of solidarity, and we have brought into line \r\nA/64/PV.6  \r\n \r\n09-52425 6 \r\n \r\nthe Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of our Americas \r\nand the Governments and the countries of Cuba, \r\nNicaragua, Honduras, Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, \r\nAntigua and Barbuda, Dominica and Saint Vincent and \r\nthe Grenadines. They attack us and try to stop us, but \r\nthey will not succeed. The Common Market of the \r\nSouth and the Union of South American Nations are \r\nbeing set up and are all part of the great historic Latin \r\nAmerican geographic and geopolitical revolution.  \r\n Along the same lines are the seven military bases \r\nthat the United States is going to establish in \r\nColombia. Yesterday, Obama spoke — I have it noted \r\nhere — about four pillars. Everyone remembers that. \r\nSo let us accomplish that. I take him at his word. We \r\ntake the President of the United States at his word: \r\nnuclear non-proliferation, agreed? They could begin by \r\ndestroying all the nuclear weapons that they have. \r\nThen go ahead and destroy them.  \r\n Obama’s second pillar — the first was \r\nnon-proliferation — is the pursuit of peace. So, \r\nPresident Obama, let us pursue peace in Colombia, in \r\ndear sister Colombia. There is a civil war in Colombia. \r\nThat some do not want to acknowledge it is another \r\nmatter. There is a long-standing, historical conflict in \r\nColombia. The United Nations must acknowledge it \r\nand consider it, and we all should extend a hand to \r\nColombia, while of course respecting its sovereignty, \r\nto pull it from and help it out of that tragedy that that \r\nbrother people is experiencing. \r\n I remember that I mentioned that peace to Obama \r\nin front of Lula in Trinidad and Tobago at the Summit \r\nof the Americas. Let us seek peace in Colombia. If \r\nonly peace were achieved in Central America, in \r\nGuatemala. When I was an active soldier, I was in \r\nGuatemala. That was war. It was war, with thousands \r\nand thousands dead and disappeared. Look at \r\nEl Salvador and Nicaragua. And now Daniel Ortega is \r\nback in Government after almost 20 years. The \r\nSandinista people brought him back. \r\n What is good for the goose is good for the gander. \r\nFarabundo Martí and the people of El Salvador brought \r\nPresident Funés to the presidency of that sister \r\nrepublic. Peace was achieved — I know President \r\nArias is here — and if peace was achieved in Central \r\nAmerica, my God, why can peace not be achieved in \r\nColombia? This is one of the greatest desires of my \r\nlife. I am Venezuelan, but I feel like a Colombian — \r\nthe Colombia of Bolivar, the Colombia of Miranda, our \r\nColombia.  \r\n Is President Obama thinking of seeking peace — \r\nhis second pillar — with seven more military bases in \r\nColombia? These seven bases are a threat, not only for \r\nthe possible peace in Colombia but for peace in South \r\nAmerica. We are right — we the Governments of South \r\nAmerica — to have said, each in our own way and in \r\nour own degree of intensity, how concerned we are \r\nabout the installation of these seven American military \r\nbases on Colombian territory. I would like to denounce \r\nit and point it out. I ask President Obama to think about \r\nit and that he apply his pillars. \r\n Let us promote peace. The United Nations could \r\nset up a peace commission in Colombia or Venezuela. \r\nNaturally, we would cooperate, I am sure, all countries \r\nthat want peace. We do not want any more war among \r\nourselves. \r\n I will skip some pages. There is another topic that \r\nFidel touches upon in his 21 September thoughts. It has \r\nto do with climate change. I am going to take another \r\ntwo minutes, Mr. President, to insist on this point. \r\nSome people think this is a metaphysical concern, it is \r\nfor intellectuals. No, we are destroying our planet. As a \r\nreputable Venezuelan journalist has said, this rocket we \r\nare travelling on — because this planet is like a rocket \r\nship — we are destroying it.  \r\n Fidel says, in his piece entitled “A species in \r\ndanger of extinction”, from 21 September 2009, “At \r\nthe international environmental conference held by the \r\nUnited Nations in Rio de Janeiro” — that was in 1992; \r\nI remember because I was in jail at the time — “I \r\nstated, as the then head of the Cuban State, ‘A species \r\nis in danger of extinction — man’”. Fidel goes on to \r\nsay:  \r\n  “When I uttered and backed up those words, \r\nreceived and applauded by the heads of State in \r\nattendance — including the President of the \r\nUnited States, a Bush less dismal than his son \r\nGeorge W. — they still believed that they had \r\nseveral centuries to confront the problem. I \r\nmyself” — Fidel — “did not envision a date any \r\ncloser than 60 or 80 years. \r\n  “Today we are dealing with a truly \r\nimminent danger and its effects are already \r\nvisible. \r\n A/64/PV.6\r\n \r\n7 09-52425 \r\n \r\n  “Average temperatures have increased \r\n0.8 degrees centigrade since 1980.” \r\n That is scientific data, according to the NASA \r\nInstitute for Space Studies — 0.8 degrees in the last \r\nalmost 30 years. Fidel continues,  \r\n  “The last two decades of the twentieth \r\ncentury were the warmest in hundreds of years. \r\nThe temperatures in Alaska, the Canadian west \r\nand eastern Russia have gone up at a pace that \r\ndoubles the world average. Arctic ice has been \r\nquickly disappearing and the region can \r\nexperience its first completely ice-free summer as \r\nsoon as the year 2040. The effects are visible in \r\nthe 2-kilometre-high masses of ice melting in \r\nGreenland, the South American glaciers, from \r\nEcuador all the way to Cape Horn, fundamental \r\nsources of water, and the gigantic ice cap \r\ncovering the extensive area of Antarctica.  \r\n  “Current carbon dioxide concentrations \r\nhave reached the equivalent of 380 parts per \r\nmillion, a figure surpassing the natural range of \r\nthe last 650,000 years.” \r\n We are destroying our planet. We must be aware \r\nof this, and we must act, as Lula stated at the 3rd \r\nmeeting yesterday. With respect to climate change, \r\nLula said there is no will. The most developed \r\ncountries do not want to take decisions. But Obama \r\nsays they do. But we are told that the United States is \r\ngoing to take some decisions. Please do, Mr. President, \r\ndo that. But now is time to move from words to action. \r\nLet us save this planet. Let us save the human race.  \r\n Let us hope that the summit in Denmark in \r\nDecember will produce decisions, truly forceful ones. \r\nVenezuela is willing to accept those decisions. \r\nVenezuela calls on everyone to take decisions \r\nproportionate to the extent of their responsibility.  \r\n Now, what is the basic cause of this \r\ncontamination? It is hyper-consumption. We are \r\nexhausting the petroleum, gas and other fossil fuel \r\nreserves. Reserves that accumulated over millions of \r\nyears are being burned in a single century, in less than \r\na century.  \r\n And that of course has to do with the economy. I \r\nshall not read this document, Mr. President; I shall \r\nmerely refer to it. It is the Stiglitz report. I invite the \r\nAssembly to analyse it. Yesterday the President of \r\nFrance also invited the Assembly to analyse it. It is \r\nthanks to him that the report of the Stiglitz \r\nCommission exists. But it is nothing more than a mere \r\ngesture.  \r\n The report contains 12 recommendations of the \r\nStiglitz Commission. Let us assess them. I think that \r\nthey address the substance, although they do not \r\nquestion the capitalist model. We socialists do question \r\nthat model, but let us talk about it, let us find \r\nconsensus solutions for the circumstances and later for \r\nthe medium and long terms.  \r\n In its recommendations, the Stiglitz report says, \r\nfirst, that we should look at income and consumption \r\nto assess material well-being. Second, it recommends \r\nprioritizing the family perspective; third, taking into \r\naccount the heritage; fourth, giving more importance to \r\nredistribution of income beyond the average. Fifth, it \r\nrecommends expanding indicators of non-commercial \r\nactivities. For example, certain services such as child \r\ncare, bricklaying, plumbing and carpentry appear in \r\nnational accounts only if they are carried out by a \r\nsalaried person.  \r\n Delegates know that this has to do with \r\naccounting for gross domestic product (GDP). These \r\nare merely capitalist mechanisms. According to the \r\nreport, the following is certain: the GDP rises with \r\ntraffic, while the anxiety of the people also rises, just \r\nas the unhappiness of passers-by and passengers in \r\ntraffic rises as they lost precious time in the traffic.  \r\n The GDP rises. Why is it rising? It is rising \r\nbecause more gasoline is consumed. Moreover, \r\npollution increases. We know why. The capitalist world \r\nhas created measuring methods for the economy that \r\nare destructive. That is why I think the Stiglitz report \r\noffers important considerations. Here, in its second \r\npoint, it says that we should establish a battery of \r\nindicators for the environment and for climate change. \r\n Turning to the economy, this report is very \r\ntimely. Let us now adopt it, and above all, \r\nGovernments, particularly Governments of the most \r\ndeveloped countries — I think they are meeting in \r\nPittsburgh today, not as the Pittsburgh Pirates, but as \r\nPresidents of the Group of 20 — should discuss it. \r\nTomorrow I will ask Lula and Cristina how the meeting \r\nwent, because they are coming to Caracas on their way \r\nto Margarita Island for the Africa-South American \r\nsummit.  \r\nA/64/PV.6  \r\n \r\n09-52425 8 \r\n \r\n The economy, the economy, the economy. We are \r\nin favour of socialism, but let us discuss it and talk \r\nabout indicators and methods and modes of production. \r\nAs President Obama said yesterday with regards to his \r\nfourth pillar, we need an economy that serves human \r\nbeings. Well, President Obama, that is called socialism. \r\nCome over to the side of socialism, President Obama, \r\ncome join the axis of evil and we will build an \r\neconomy that truly serves human beings. It is \r\nimpossible to do that with capitalism. Capitalism only \r\nbenefits a minority and excludes the majority. Besides, \r\nit destroys the environment and destroys lives. That is \r\ncapitalism. \r\n Finally — and I think I have now been speaking \r\nfor my allotted 10 minutes — I will end with a phrase \r\nof Lula’s. He was the first speaker in the Assembly \r\nyesterday. He said there is no political will. I have \r\nalready commented on that, and I would add to it \r\nbecause I know Lula and I know exactly what he said \r\nto us. He is calling upon all of us to strengthen political \r\nwill. \r\n Unlike other Governments elsewhere, which have \r\ndoubts and do not want to change despite the terrible \r\ncrisis in which we are living, we in southern America \r\nhave a lot of political will — here I am speaking for \r\nVenezuela and, I know, also for South America, for \r\nLatin America — a tremendous political will for true \r\nchange.  \r\n I recommend this book by István Mészáros, a \r\ngreat Hungarian philosopher and thinker who has been \r\na professor at various universities in London for many \r\nyears: Beyond Capital: Toward a Theory of Transition. \r\nI think the book is among the greatest writings of the \r\ntwentieth century. It is a complete renewal of socialist \r\ntheory. In one of the interesting chapters Mészáros \r\nquotes another great person, Karl Marx. We must not \r\nbe afraid of Karl Marx — he was the Einstein of \r\npolitics. Yes, he was demonized, but Karl Marx was \r\nright about so many things. \r\n Quoting Marx, Mészáros says in this book that \r\ncrises act as a general threat and thus urgently lead us \r\nbeyond presuppositions towards a new historic \r\nparadigm. We need a new historic paradigm. For years \r\nwe have been hearing about a new world, but what \r\nactually exists is this old, moribund order. We need the \r\nnew order to be born, the new historic paradigm, the \r\nnew political paradigm, a new global paradigm. \r\nYesterday Al-Qadhafi said here that we need a new \r\ninstitutionalism, a new economy, a new society, but \r\ntruly new — a world that is new.  \r\n Now, I think Lula said yesterday — he finished \r\nspeaking at 10:10 in the morning — that we must \r\nbecome the midwives of history. I agree. I would add \r\nto what Lula said. Has the birth already started? The \r\nbirth is not a future event; it is here. Let us be, as \r\nComrade Lula said, midwives of the new history, \r\nprevailing over those who would bury it. Let us \r\nstruggle on the planet for the birth of this new history, \r\nthis new time, this new multi-polar, free world, this \r\neconomy at the service of all people, not of minorities, \r\nthis world of peace.  \r\n I am a Christian. One day Christ said, “My \r\nkingdom is not of this world.” It is of a future world, \r\nthe reign of love among us, where we can truly live as \r\nbrothers and sisters. \r\n Last Sunday in Havana — and I will put my little \r\nbooks away and I will wind up now — on the Plaza de \r\nla Revolución there was a great concert, the “Concert \r\nfor Peace”, with Miguel Bosé, Juanes, Olga Tañó and \r\nCuban singers. Silvio Rodríguez was there — the Great \r\nSilvio — and they sang to the whole world. Some \r\npeople in Miami went crazy and tried to destroy \r\nJuanes’ CDs — that great Colombian — just because \r\nhe had gone to sing on the Plaza of the Revolution. \r\nHow crazy can you get? Fortunately they are a \r\nminority. Silvio was there with his guitar, and I am sure \r\nhe sang, “This era is giving birth to a heart”. He ends \r\nhis song, Cita Con Angeles, like this: “Let us be a tiny \r\nbit better and a little less selfish.” \r\n Cheers! \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela for the statement \r\nhe has just made. \r\n Mr. Hugo Chávez Frías, President of the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela, was escorted \r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Danilo Türk, President of the \r\nRepublic of Slovenia  \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nRepublic of Slovenia. \r\n A/64/PV.6\r\n \r\n9 09-52425 \r\n \r\n Mr. Danilo Türk, President of the Republic of \r\nSlovenia, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Danilo Türk, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Slovenia, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly. \r\n President Türk: Yesterday and today we have \r\nheard many inspiring words. We heard powerful words, \r\nwords of hope. A few moments ago we heard words \r\nabout salvation. Although most of us would not agree \r\nthat salvation is around the corner, at the same time I \r\nbelieve all of us will agree that improvement is \r\npossible and that the reason we are here is to make that \r\nimprovement a reality. But in order to do that, we must \r\ndo what the peoples of the world legitimately expect \r\nfrom us as representatives of United Nations Member \r\nStates: to make this institution, the United Nations, \r\neffective and to work for it with a sense of common \r\npurpose, truly as united nations.  \r\n I express full confidence in your experience and \r\nwisdom, Mr. President, congratulate you on your \r\nelection and wish you every success in your work for \r\nthe improvement of humankind’s situation. \r\n At the same time, I would not wish to miss the \r\nopportunity to thank the President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-third session, Mr. Miguel \r\nd’Escoto Brockmann, who guided this Assembly with \r\ngreat determination and an ethical commitment to \r\nfairness and justice. \r\n I also wish to pay tribute to our Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his guidance in these \r\ntrying times. \r\n In the past few days, many of us were engaged in \r\nan effort, spearheaded by the Secretary-General, to \r\ngenerate the necessary political will to seal the deal in \r\nCopenhagen. We all appreciate this example of \r\ninternational leadership. Humankind must take resolute \r\nsteps towards a new and effective system to mitigate \r\nthe effects of global warming and to ensure our \r\nnecessary adaptation.  \r\n Our responsibilities are common and \r\ndifferentiated. Today, we understand that each of the \r\nMember States of the United Nations must do its share \r\nand that, together as united nations, we can save the \r\nplanet. Let the Copenhagen Conference be the turning \r\npoint. \r\n We also need to broaden the front and fully \r\ninclude civil society and the business sector in broad \r\naction for this needed technological and social \r\ntransformation. Action starting now to mitigate the \r\nconsequences of climate change will have to lead to \r\nprofound societal change — a change in the way we \r\nproduce, the way we consume and the way we live. Let \r\nus not be afraid of these changes. These changes may \r\nnot amount to a revolution, of which President Chávez \r\nFrías of Venezuela spoke, but they will have to be real \r\nand, if guided in a wise and timely manner, they can \r\nimprove our common future. \r\n Now the world needs a comprehensive strategy in \r\norder to fulfil this task. Such a strategy needs to \r\naddress all the main challenges of our time in a \r\nconsistent manner. The food crisis, climate change, the \r\nenergy crisis, the spreading of infectious diseases and \r\nother problems may have different roots, but they \r\nproduce a single, communicative effect. They hobble \r\nglobal development and make the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals only a distant \r\npossibility. Therefore, clear responses are called for. \r\n Mr. Grauls (Belgium), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n And what is the role of the United Nations in this \r\ncontext? Some of the answers have already been \r\nprovided. They are enshrined, inter alia, in the \r\nOutcome of the United Nations Conference on the \r\nWorld Financial and Economic Crisis and its Impact on \r\nDevelopment, which was held in New York in June. \r\nResults of that Conference should be further \r\nelaborated. Specific priority tasks for global \r\ndevelopment must soon be defined. \r\n These days, many expectations are linked to the \r\nG-20 summit meeting in Pittsburgh. Much needs to be \r\ndone to bring greater discipline and responsibility to \r\nthe global financial system. This is an important and \r\nimmediate priority. Moreover, it is necessary to \r\nincrease resources and to adjust the Bretton Woods \r\ninstitutions with a view to the proper maintenance of \r\nglobal financial stability and of development financing. \r\nThe restarting of global trade negotiations has become \r\nan urgent priority. \r\n But even more is needed, including the \r\nimprovement of official development assistance, with a \r\nA/64/PV.6  \r\n \r\n09-52425 10 \r\n \r\nparticular priority on development in Africa. Issues of \r\nglobal development represent a large part of the agenda \r\nof the current session of the General Assembly. \r\n However, we must also think about the fate of \r\nhuman rights in current global circumstances. Human \r\nrights and development are closely connected. The \r\ncurrent recession has already increased global levels of \r\npoverty. Unemployment is growing. The faith of many \r\nyoung people is becoming ever more uncertain. All \r\nthese are serious challenges to global social stability \r\nand may turn into the serious security concerns of \r\ntomorrow if left unattended. \r\n I welcome the efforts of the International Labour \r\nOrganization and the Global Jobs Pact adopted in June. \r\nToday, there is no challenge to human rights more \r\npervasive, more strategic and more pressing than the \r\nchallenge of poverty and unemployment. Policymakers \r\nneed to ensure that economic policies and human rights \r\npolicies alike are coordinated and that mechanisms are \r\nput into place at the national and international levels. \r\n Slovenia was one of the first Member States to \r\nsign today the Optional Protocol to the International \r\nCovenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. \r\nThe Protocol will give individuals an additional and \r\npotentially significant implementation mechanism. \r\nThis is a small step, but one which demonstrates our \r\nawareness of the problem and our commitment to \r\naction. \r\n We are also looking to the Human Rights Council \r\nas the main body of the United Nations to devise \r\nstrategies for human rights. Slovenia has been an active \r\nmember of the Council and we remain optimistic. The \r\nprogress achieved so far in developing new methods of \r\nwork in the Council is encouraging, albeit not yet \r\nsufficient. We welcome the election of the United \r\nStates to the Council and believe that only an inclusive \r\nforum for human rights can be an effective forum for \r\nhuman rights. Members of the Human Rights Council \r\nmust realize that they bear a special responsibility to \r\nlead. \r\n But there are problems which exceed the \r\npotential of the Human Rights Council itself. The \r\nfailures to protect human beings from mass atrocities \r\nand from gross and systematic violations of human \r\nrights should not be repeated. We still have not found \r\nthe right tools to respond in a timely and effective \r\nmanner to such situations. I therefore welcome the \r\ndebate on the responsibility to protect that took place \r\nin the General Assembly in July this year. Continued \r\nengagement of the General Assembly on this subject \r\nhas proved to be necessary, and I hope that this \r\ndiscussion will yield results. \r\n Issues of environment, development and human \r\nrights represent today the bulk of the current United \r\nNations agenda, but it is in the area of the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security that some of the \r\nmost urgent thinking and action are necessary. Four \r\nareas of work are of special importance. \r\n The reform of the Security Council is long \r\noverdue and progress made at the sixty-third session of \r\nthe General Assembly is insufficient. However, \r\nnegotiations so far have generated a positive \r\nmomentum. It is apparent that the expansion of the \r\nSecurity Council in the permanent and non-permanent \r\ncategories of membership has gained broad support \r\namong United Nations Member States. Exactly a year \r\nago from this rostrum, I suggested a specific model for \r\nSecurity Council expansion. It was one of many \r\nproposals that were made. Now the time is right for \r\nthat and other proposals to be put on the table and to be \r\naddressed head on. \r\n In addition to structural change, such as Security \r\nCouncil reform, we need to strengthen the United \r\nNations practical role in the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. I welcome the \r\nthinking expressed in the report of the Department of \r\nPeacekeeping Operations entitled “A New Partnership \r\nAgenda: Charting a New Horizon for United Nations \r\nPeacekeeping”, published in July this year. The report \r\nhighlights many of the most pressing and subtle needs \r\nfor improvement. Member States must give careful \r\nconsideration to the report and to such concepts as \r\nexpanding the peacekeeping partnership, the purpose \r\nof which is to strengthen the operational capacity and \r\npolitical sophistication of United Nations peacekeeping. \r\n Let us not overlook the fact that progress in \r\npeacekeeping would strengthen all other United \r\nNations activities linked to the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security, including preventive \r\ndiplomacy and post-conflict peacebuilding. \r\n The third area which needs to be addressed is \r\ndisarmament, non-proliferation and arms control, \r\nwhere we have come up against far too many \r\nstumbling blocks in the past. United Nations action \r\nneeds to be energized now, and the forthcoming review \r\n A/64/PV.6\r\n \r\n11 09-52425 \r\n \r\nof the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons has to be a step forward.  \r\n Fourthly, the United Nations will continue to be \r\nan indispensable forum for political consultation and \r\npolicy advice. The experience of the United Nations is \r\nirreplaceable. The situation in Afghanistan can be cited \r\nas a case in point. For three decades now, the United \r\nNations has been seized with a variety of problems \r\naffecting Afghanistan, a Member State. No one should \r\ndoubt that Afghanistan belongs to the Afghans or that \r\nthe Afghanization of security is the only real path \r\ntowards security in the country. There can be no \r\nmilitary solution to the country’s variety of problems. \r\nIt is becoming ever more apparent that the international \r\ncommunity will have to assist in an Afghan process of \r\ntransition that will decrease and eventually phase out \r\nthe international military presence in the country. \r\n Let me emphasize the role of the United Nations \r\nin that context. Sometimes, matters such as the \r\nsituation in and around Afghanistan are discussed at \r\nspecialized international conferences, but wisdom and \r\ncommon sense suggest that the experience of the \r\nUnited Nations be put to use. Let us not forget the \r\nunique success of the United Nations, of the United \r\nNations-led 2001 Bonn Conference and of the \r\nsubsequent Constitutional Loya Jirga. The time has \r\ncome for a broad look at the entire experience since \r\nthat period, an assessment of what exactly went wrong \r\nand why, a sober assessment of the current situation, \r\nand the careful definition of further steps that will \r\nmake international political, economic and \r\nadministrative assistance more effective and the \r\ninternational military presence no longer needed. The \r\nassistance of the Security Council and the General \r\nAssembly will be valuable in that regard.  \r\n Let me conclude by saying something very \r\nobvious. The agenda of the United Nations today is \r\nheavy, but that is not news. The United Nations has \r\nalways been the forum for addressing the world’s most \r\nintractable problems. At the same time, however, the \r\nUnited Nations has always represented hope and \r\npromise to the world. Let us live up to that hope and \r\nthat promise. Let us make this the era of the United \r\nNations and the Organization’s finest hour. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Slovenia for the statement \r\nhe has just made. \r\n Mr. Danilo Türk, President of the Republic of \r\nSlovenia, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.  \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Bharrat Jagdeo, President of the \r\nRepublic of Guyana \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Guyana. \r\n Mr. Bharrat Jagdeo, President of the Republic of \r\nGuyana, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency  \r\nMr. Bharrat Jagdeo, President of the Republic of \r\nGuyana, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Jagdeo: I extend our gratitude to the \r\nSecretary-General for continuing to spearhead the work \r\nof the United Nations at a time when our membership \r\nis beset by historic challenges. \r\n I am told that it is only what one says from the \r\nrostrum that is reflected in the record of the meeting. I \r\nhope that perhaps in the future, we can change the \r\nsystem. If we do so, we may be able to say more \r\nwithout spending a lot of time at the rostrum. So I shall \r\ncirculate the full text of my speech and focus on only \r\ntwo areas that I think are important at this point in \r\ntime. The first has to do with the financial crisis and its \r\nimpact on the Caribbean, and the second concerns the \r\nclimate change crisis.  \r\n In the case of the prevailing financial crisis, the \r\nsmall, vulnerable economies of the Caribbean have had \r\nto bear the brunt of global recession. That has \r\nmanifested itself both through depressed prices for \r\nprimary exported commodities, such as bauxite, and \r\nthrough depressed demand for services, such as \r\ntourism. The result has been losses in export and \r\nforeign currency earnings, with attendant dislocation of \r\nexchange rates and Government revenues, exacerbating \r\nan already tenuous fiscal and debt situation and \r\ncausing the loss of jobs and welfare and a reversal of \r\ngains previously made against poverty. \r\n Even as we seek long-term solutions to bolster \r\nthe resilience of our economies, the need for relief and \r\nsupport is immediate. The capacity of the small \r\ncountries of the Caribbean to respond with \r\nA/64/PV.6  \r\n \r\n09-52425 12 \r\n \r\ncountercyclical measures is virtually non-existent, with \r\nno available fiscal space and levels of indebtedness \r\nthat are among the highest in the world. The case is \r\ntherefore compelling for the global community to \r\nrelieve and restructure the debt of these heavily \r\nindebted vulnerable small countries, including those \r\nthat were not previously considered for debt relief \r\nbecause of their income levels, but whose debt ratios \r\nare clearly unsustainable by any standard. \r\n The case is equally compelling for new additional \r\nflows of development assistance to be delivered to \r\nthese countries by both multilateral and bilateral \r\ndevelopment partners. Despite injections of large \r\namounts of additional resources into some of the \r\nmultilateral institutions and the approval of new \r\nfacilities by those institutions, very little has actually \r\nmaterialized in terms of additionality in disbursements \r\nto smaller States. This needs to be corrected urgently if \r\nwe are to avoid the perception that there is an absence \r\nof concern at the global level for the needs of smaller \r\ncountries. \r\n My fear is that, as the crisis abates, so too will \r\nthe will to change the global financial architecture. \r\nTherefore, we are advocating urgent action in this area, \r\nand we are also saying that this solution — a new \r\nglobal financial architecture — must involve smaller \r\ncountries in its articulation. Our fear is that, if we \r\ncontinue along the same path, we will have a new \r\narchitecture that caters only to the concerns of the large \r\ncountries — now expanded to the Group of 20 — and \r\nthat the smaller countries will not see their concerns \r\nreflected in it. That is why, last year, I called for a new \r\nBretton Woods-type conference at which all the \r\ncountries in this Hall would help to create that \r\narchitecture.  \r\n The second crisis that I wish to mention is that of \r\nclimate change. This week, there has been much talk \r\nabout the urgency of tackling climate change. Thanks \r\nto the vision exhibited by the Secretary-General and \r\nthe work of leaders and citizens from countries across \r\nthe world, the level of understanding about the nature \r\nof the climate challenge is increasingly clear. \r\n But we need to move beyond simply \r\nunderstanding the challenge. We need to work as a \r\nglobal community to shape a solution that is in the \r\ninterests of all countries, and many of the building \r\nblocks that will enable us to do this have been \r\nidentified. The challenge for the Copenhagen meeting \r\nis to turn these building blocks into an agreement that \r\ncan start to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \r\n In doing so, we should be guided by science and \r\nby the need for solutions that treat all countries fairly. \r\nBut we also need to recognize that the challenge now is \r\nas much about political will as it is about scientific, \r\neconomic and institutional considerations. In \r\naddressing the politics, we need to recognize that in all \r\ncountries — developed and developing — there are \r\nconcerns about the commitment of others to the long-\r\nterm global partnership we need. Many developing \r\ncountries question whether the international \r\ncommunity will commit to the scale of financial \r\ntransfers that all major analyses agree are needed. \r\nOthers are worried that acting on climate change now \r\nwill stymie their national development, precisely at a \r\ntime when many are poised for historic levels of \r\neconomic growth and social advances. \r\n On the other hand, many developed countries are \r\nworried that the financial transfers needed will be an \r\nexcessive burden on their budgets during extremely \r\nchallenging economic times. Domestic constituencies \r\nin the developed world are also fearful about \r\ntransferring significant sums of money abroad, and \r\nthey worry that jobs or investment will be driven away \r\nfrom their economies. There are also fears from \r\nindividual countries that they will be expected to carry \r\na greater burden than other developed nations. These \r\npolitical concerns could be a recipe for a stalemate that \r\nthe world cannot afford. Failure to overcome them now \r\nwill mean misery for future generations, and the \r\neventual costs of tackling climate change will be even \r\ngreater than they are now.  \r\n We therefore need to find a way through. This \r\nwill require leadership from all nations. I welcome the \r\nproposals laid out by Gordon Brown, and subsequently \r\nsupported by the European Union, to generate funding \r\nin excess of $100 billion per annum to address climate \r\nchange in the developing world. For the first time, \r\nthere is a proposal that starts to square up to the \r\nmagnitude of funding that is required for adaptation \r\nand mitigation. \r\n Having spoken with many of my fellow leaders \r\nthis week, I am confident that, with the right signal \r\nfrom the developed world, developing countries are \r\nready to play their part. Of particular urgency will be \r\nfinding ways to work together to address the 17 per \r\ncent of greenhouse gas emissions that result from \r\n A/64/PV.6\r\n \r\n13 09-52425 \r\n \r\ntropical deforestation and forest degradation globally. \r\nAs with climate change in general, we now have a \r\nlarge degree of clarity around the nature of this specific \r\nproblem. We know that it causes more emissions than \r\nthe entire European Union, and we know that this is \r\nbecause the world economy makes trees worth more \r\ndead than alive. We also know that the only sustainable \r\nway to address the problem is national-scale action in \r\nforest countries coupled with international incentives \r\nthat place a value on trees to make them worth more \r\nalive than dead. \r\n We now need to rapidly move from constantly \r\nrearticulating this problem towards putting in place \r\nworkable solutions. In Guyana, we remain ready to \r\nplay our part, and we have launched our low-carbon \r\ndevelopment strategy, which sets out how we can place \r\nour entire forest under long-term protection, not only \r\nto provide the world with badly needed climate \r\nservices, but also to move our economy onto a long-\r\nterm, sustainable low-carbon development path, where \r\njobs are created across our country in sectors that do \r\nnot threaten our trees. \r\n Thanks to the visionary leadership of the Prime \r\nMinister of Norway, our two countries are also \r\nworking together to provide a functioning model of \r\nhow low-deforestation and low-carbon economies can \r\nbe created in countries such as ours. \r\n In parallel, Guyana continues to play its part in \r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange (UNFCCC) process, which must provide the \r\nlong-term framework for combating forest-based \r\nemissions through the United Nations Collaborative \r\nProgramme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation \r\nand Forest Degradation in Developing Countries \r\n(REDD) or the REDD+ Programme. But we also \r\nbelieve that the world can move quickly to slow down \r\ndeforestation starting now, not in 2013. Guyana was \r\npleased to participate in the April G-20 side meeting \r\nthat addressed how this can happen. We support the \r\nproposals made by the informal working group on \r\ninterim financing for REDD, which was set up after the \r\nG-20 side meeting. We support its report, which lays \r\nout how the world can achieve a 25 per cent reduction \r\nin global deforestation rates by 2015 with an \r\ninvestment of less than €25 billion in total.  \r\n Using highly conservative estimates of forest \r\ncarbon, this could lead to seven gigatons of greenhouse \r\ngas emissions being avoided between now and 2015. If \r\nthis occurred, it would be the single biggest \r\ncontribution to averting climate catastrophe over this \r\nperiod. And it can be done. Rainforest countries \r\nrepresenting the vast majority of the world’s tropical \r\nforests have worked with the informal working group \r\nand are willing to act. The question now is: Will the \r\ndeveloped world understand the enormous potential \r\nthis offers our world, and will it act to generate the \r\nfinances that are needed? \r\n The sum of money needed for this interim period \r\nmay seem large, but it does not only represent a very \r\ngood value for money abatement solution; it can also \r\ngenerate significant financial flows for developing \r\ncountries, it can create alternative livelihoods for \r\nindigenous peoples and other forest-dependent \r\ncommunities, and it can preserve the enormous \r\nbiodiversity present in the world’s forests. \r\n Twenty-five billion euros over five years \r\nrepresent less than 1.5 cents per citizen per day in \r\ndeveloped countries. It is a fraction of what the world \r\nhas generated to save the financial system from \r\ncollapse, it provides a bridge to a long-term REDD+ \r\nsolution under the UNFCCC, and it buys the world \r\nbadly needed time in the race to defeat climate change. \r\nTo turn away from making this proposal a reality \r\nwould be a mistake of historic proportions. \r\n I have just said to President Chávez Frías that I \r\nwish I could conclude by singing, but I do not have his \r\nwonderful voice. Instead, I will confine myself to \r\nsaying that we all have an important role to play in \r\nsolving this crisis, but the developed world has a moral \r\nobligation to play a greater part in solving both the \r\nfinancial crisis and the climate change crisis, because it \r\nis due to its actions that we are in this situation. I hope \r\nthat the developed world recognizes this obligation and \r\nthe urgency to act upon it now. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Guyana for the statement \r\nhe has just made. \r\n Mr. Bharrat Jagdeo, President of the Republic of \r\nGuyana, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\nA/64/PV.6  \r\n \r\n09-52425 14 \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Óscar Arias Sánchez, President of \r\nthe Republic of Costa Rica \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Costa Rica. \r\n Mr. Óscar Arias Sánchez, President of the \r\nRepublic of Costa Rica, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Óscar Arias Sánchez, President of the Republic of \r\nCosta Rica, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Arias Sánchez (spoke in Spanish): Let \r\nme begin by sending a warm greeting to Mr. Ali \r\nAbdussalam Treki, President of the Assembly, on \r\nbehalf of a country 35 times smaller than his native \r\nLibya and infinitely different in scenery and \r\ngeography. Instead of desert sandstorms we have \r\ntorrential rains. We know not the waves of the \r\nMediterranean, but the capricious tides of the \r\nCaribbean. Its dunes are our forests, its mosques our \r\ncathedrals. But I believe that such differences are at the \r\nvery heart of the United Nations. Aristotle posited that \r\nthings are distinguished by what they look like. Here, \r\nwithin this haven, nations are similar precisely in that \r\nthey are distinct, because each is irreplaceable in the \r\nvast catalogue of the planet. From the far reaches of \r\nthis variety that makes us brothers, I wish him the \r\ngreatest success in this Assembly. \r\n Twenty-three years ago, I spoke for the first time \r\nat this rostrum — a rock of reason amidst seas of \r\ninsanity. At that time, I came here bearing the cries of \r\nmillions of Central Americans who sought a peaceful \r\nsolution to the civil wars that were lacerating our \r\nregion. I came to ask powerful nations to stop the flow \r\nof arms fuelling the procession of coffins in our \r\nterritories, and I came to defend the right of the \r\npeoples of Latin America to build their own destiny \r\nfreely and democratically. \r\n The second time I visited this Hall, I came \r\nseeking support for the peace plan that the Presidents \r\nof Central America had signed. In those days, no one \r\nthought that little Central America would defy the \r\nworld and choose life in the face of all threats. No one \r\nthought that we would have the strength to confront the \r\nPowers of the cold war and find our own solution to all \r\nour problems. No one thought that we would be able to \r\nsow the seeds of democracy in our lands and go on to \r\nwork for the human development of our peoples. We \r\ngave the pessimists and the sceptics a lesson. We \r\nrefuted with dreams the nightmares that many \r\nprophesied for us. Today, I come here to recognize the \r\ndistance we have travelled and to warn of the risk of \r\nbacksliding. \r\n Since the last time I spoke before this Assembly, \r\na Central American nation has seen the demon of the \r\ncoup d’état awaken once again. Our region’s armies \r\nhave received nearly $60 billion to combat imaginary \r\nenemies, while our peoples have struggled empty-\r\nhanded against the economic crisis. Some leaders have \r\ndefied democratic rules in the most imaginative ways, \r\nwhile everything that was wrong with our continent has \r\ncarried on the same, or worse. Poverty has continued to \r\nafflict more than a third of our inhabitants. One in \r\nthree young Latin Americans still has never seen a \r\nhigh-school classroom. Hundreds of thousands of \r\npeople have died of preventable diseases. The toll of \r\nviolent death in some of our countries has exceeded \r\nthose of countries at war, despite the fact that, with the \r\nexception of Colombia, there are no armed conflicts in \r\nour region. And millions of trees have been felled in \r\nterritories responsible among them for two thirds of the \r\nworldwide forest cover loss in the twenty-first century. \r\n This scenario is not a hopeful one. For those of us \r\nfrom Latin America, it is difficult not to feel that we \r\nare always rescuing our future from the clutches of our \r\npast, and that we are always trying to take off on a \r\nrunway where some foolish person spilled oil, long \r\nago. We have not achieved greater development. We \r\nhave not made our democracy stronger. We have not \r\ndriven from our reality the shadow of militarism and \r\noppression. These problems recur endemically, to \r\nvarying degrees, in the majority of developing \r\nnations — the very nations that will to a large extent \r\nbear the weight of the course of humanity over the next \r\n50 years. \r\n It is the developing nations that will shoulder the \r\nworst of the struggle against global warming, that will \r\ncarry the heaviest burden of population growth on the \r\nplanet, and that will be responsible for accelerating the \r\ngrowth of a global economy to which the rich cannot \r\ncontribute much more than they already generate. We \r\ndo not yet know how the leading role we have been \r\ngiven will play out. Our success or failure will depend \r\non whether we have the courage to take on at least \r\n A/64/PV.6\r\n \r\n15 09-52425 \r\n \r\nthree fundamental challenges: the strengthening of our \r\ndemocracies, the encouragement of human development \r\nfor our peoples through the reduction of military \r\nspending and cross-border arms trafficking, and the \r\ncreation of a new international order for the transfer of \r\naid, information and technology to combat climate \r\nchange. \r\n Developing nations, and middle-income nations \r\nin particular, live simultaneously in the medieval and \r\npostmodern eras. In our race to emulate the \r\nexperiences of developed countries, we have skipped \r\npast fundamental steps. There is no doubt that one of \r\nthese steps is the patient construction of democratic \r\ninstitutions, on which developed countries have spent \r\ncenturies, while we, if we have been lucky, have spent \r\ndecades.  \r\n As a result, beyond superficial appearances, we \r\nlack a true civic culture. We have democratic structures \r\nthat in many cases are no more than empty shells. We \r\nhave free elections, but lack the open social forum to \r\nallow all citizens freely to make political or ideological \r\ncontribution. We have formal separation of powers, but \r\nin many places power remains a single monopoly \r\ndisguised in multiple public entities. We have rule of \r\nlaw, but the reach of the law is tested every day by \r\nGovernments incapable of applying it, when not \r\ndetermined actually to weaken it. We have political \r\nconstitutions and international treaties that reaffirm our \r\nbelief in democratic values, but populations still prone \r\nto toss those values aside for material gain. \r\n Paraphrasing the great Argentinean writer Jorge \r\nLuis Borges, we can say that most inhabitants of \r\ndeveloping countries do not identify with the State, \r\nwhich seems to them an abstract concept, removed \r\nfrom their immediate concerns. That is why they allow \r\na Government to end before its constitutional period \r\nhas elapsed or to continue in power beyond that period. \r\nThat is why they expect the Government to offer social \r\nwelfare and public services, but do not recognize the \r\nreciprocal obligations of citizens.  \r\n That is why they prefer caudillos to political \r\nparties, messianic leaders to democratic institutions. \r\nThat is why they boycott the approval of new taxes in \r\ncountries whose tax burden is half or even a third of \r\nthat of developed countries. That is why they so easily \r\nfall for a discourse that blames national problems on \r\nothers instead of assuming responsibility for designing \r\nmechanisms that confront them. And this is the best-\r\ncase scenario, because in the worst there is no \r\ndemocracy at all. \r\n As long as we continue on this path, placing our \r\nhopes in developing nations will be like pouring water \r\ninto a sack. As long as we fail to dedicate more \r\ninternational attention, and more international aid, to \r\nstrengthening and perfecting democracies in this world, \r\nwe will watch again and again as our countries try to \r\ntake off on a slippery runway. \r\n This challenge is even more urgent in the face of \r\nan arms race that, year by year, moves $1.3 trillion \r\nglobally. The combination of strong armies and weak \r\ndemocracies has proved harmful in every corner of the \r\nplanet, and above all in Latin America, which, during \r\nthe second half of the twentieth century was a \r\nshowcase of dictatorial horrors, fuelled by the \r\nexistence of an omnipresent military apparatus. I will \r\nnever tire of repeating it: in Latin America, and in a \r\nsubstantial portion of the developing world, armies \r\nhave served no purpose other than to carry out coups \r\nd’état. They have not protected the people; they have \r\noppressed them. They have not safeguarded liberties; \r\nthey have trampled on them. They have not guaranteed \r\nrespect for the will of the people; they have mocked it. \r\n What is the threat to our nations? What, for \r\nexample, is the great enemy of Latin America that \r\ncompels it to waste $165 million a day on weapons and \r\nsoldiers? I assure the Assembly that such threats are far \r\nless significant than that posed by the mosquito that \r\ncarries malaria, for instance. They are less significant \r\nthan the threat posed by the lack of opportunity that \r\npushes our young people into crime. They are less \r\nsignificant than the threat posed by the drug cartels and \r\nstreet gangs that survive thanks to an unrestricted \r\nmarket for small arms and light weapons. \r\n And so what we have to do is order our priorities. \r\nCosta Rica was the first country to abolish its army and \r\ndeclare peace on the world. Thanks to that visionary \r\ndecision, thanks to the liberating army of Commander \r\nJosé Figueres, who renounced arms forever, we have \r\nthe opportunity today to invest our resources in things \r\nthat matter. And while we know that not every nation is \r\nready to take such a radical step, we believe that a \r\ngradual and progressive reduction in military spending \r\nis not only a good strategy for allocating resources, but \r\nalso a moral imperative for developing nations. \r\n For this reason I ask the Assembly once more to \r\nmake the Costa Rica Consensus a reality. This \r\nA/64/PV.6  \r\n \r\n09-52425 16 \r\n \r\ninitiative would create mechanisms for forgiving \r\nforeign debt and using international financial resources \r\nto support those poor and middle-income developing \r\ncountries that are investing more in environmental \r\nprotection, education, health, housing and sustainable \r\ndevelopment for their people and less in arms and \r\nsoldiers. And I also ask the Assembly to approve an \r\narms trade treaty, which is known to this Organization, \r\nand which seeks to prohibit the transfer of arms to \r\nStates, groups or individuals when sufficient reason \r\nexists to believe that those arms will be used to \r\nundermine human rights or international law. I assure \r\nmembers that these two initiatives will make us safer, \r\nand certainly more developed, than the costly \r\nmachinery of death that currently consumes our \r\nbudgets. \r\n What is more, spending on arms deprives us not \r\nonly of economic resources. Above all, it deprives us \r\nof human resources. At this moment, the greatest \r\narsenal of genius in the world is working on refining \r\nthe weaponry and defence systems of a few nations. \r\nThat is not where this genius should be. Its place is in \r\nthe laboratories where medicines are being created that \r\nwill be accessible to all humankind. Its place is in the \r\nclassrooms where the leaders of tomorrow are being \r\nformed. Its place is in the Governments that need help \r\nin protecting their harvests, their cities and their \r\npopulations from the effects of global warming. \r\n We have included sustainable development in the \r\nCosta Rica Consensus because we believe there is a \r\nconnection between arms and the protection of the \r\nenvironment. This is, first, because arms and wars \r\ngenerate more environmental devastation and pollution \r\nthan any productive activity; and secondly, because the \r\nvery existence of military spending constitutes, in and \r\nof itself, a negation of resources available to combat \r\nglobal warming. Every armoured helicopter, every \r\ntank, every nuclear submarine represents, in practice, \r\nforests that are not protected, technologies that are not \r\nbecoming less costly and adaptations that are not being \r\nmade. \r\n Only a few weeks remain before the Climate \r\nChange Conference in Copenhagen, where every \r\ncountry will have to undertake commitments much \r\ngreater than today’s. My small nation, Costa Rica, will \r\nattend the conference with its head held high, because \r\nunilaterally, and at great sacrifice, we have set \r\nourselves goals that are ever more challenging. We \r\nhave launched an initiative called Peace with Nature, \r\nthrough which we propose, among other things, to \r\nbecome a carbon-neutral country by the year 2021. \r\nThis is possible, in large part, thanks to the nearly four \r\ndecades we have spent protecting our land, replanting \r\nour forests and safeguarding our natural species — and \r\nalso because, at the same time that we abolished our \r\narmy, we created pioneering institutions devoted to the \r\nsearch for renewable energy sources. Today, more than \r\n95 per cent of our electricity comes from water or \r\nwind, from the depths of the Earth or the rays of the \r\nsun. \r\n Infinite challenges remain, for Costa Rica as for \r\nany other middle-income country. The world’s rich \r\nnations, which developed in the most unsustainable \r\nway possible, cannot now place limits that choke the \r\ndevelopment expectations of every other country. \r\nEfforts must be directed instead at forming a global \r\nplatform that allows us to transfer international aid, \r\ninformation and technology efficiently from one nation \r\nto another; a platform that will only make sense if the \r\nmember States of the Organization for Economic \r\nCooperation and Development increase their official \r\ndevelopment aid, which today stands at $120 billion \r\nper year. When it comes to mitigating and adapting \r\nourselves to global warming the world must share, not \r\ncompete. \r\n These three challenges — strengthening \r\ndemocracies, reducing military spending and \r\ncooperating to confront climate change — perhaps \r\nconstitute the most ambitious agenda humanity has \r\never had to take on. Neither I, nor my Government, nor \r\nCosta Rica, will ignore this historic call; for we simply \r\ncannot fail. We cannot falter. We cannot turn back \r\nwhen we are standing at the vanguard of 6.8 billion \r\nhuman beings.  \r\n Like Adam and Eve, we are still living in a \r\nheavenly Paradise minutes before being expelled due \r\nto our own arrogance. Our sense of responsibility, our \r\nhumility and our courage will determine whether we \r\nwaste our opportunity on Earth and squander the \r\nmiracle of life that has brought us heartbreak and pain \r\nyet has also allowed us to know happiness. The \r\ngreatest of the Costa Rican poets, Jorge Debravo, said \r\nthat hope is as strong as bone and more powerful than \r\nimagination or memory. May that still-present hope \r\ngive us the strength to embark on the last journey of an \r\nunsustainable civilization and the first of a civilization \r\nthat will survive and outlast us all. \r\n A/64/PV.6\r\n \r\n17 09-52425 \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of Costa Rica for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n Mr. Óscar Arias Sánchez, President of Costa \r\nRica, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, President of \r\nthe United Republic of Tanzania \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe United Republic of Tanzania. \r\n Mr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, President of the \r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania, was escorted into \r\nthe General Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, President of the United \r\nRepublic of Tanzania, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\n President Kikwete: It is indeed an honour and a \r\npleasure for me to extend my very warm \r\ncongratulations to Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his \r\nwell-deserved election to the presidency at the sixty-\r\nfourth session of the General Assembly. I hope that \r\nduring his presidency he will help advance the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly, reinforce \r\nmultilateralism and promote dialogue among \r\ncivilizations. I promise Mr. Treki my personal \r\ncooperation as well as that of the Tanzanian delegation \r\nin the discharge of his responsibilities. \r\n Allow me also to use this opportunity to pay \r\ntribute to his predecessor, His Excellency Father \r\nMiguel d’Escoto Brockmann, for a job very well done. \r\nI thank him for the honour he recently bestowed upon \r\nthe late Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, the founder President \r\nand Father of the Tanzanian nation. \r\n Our deep appreciation also goes to our illustrious \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his diligent \r\nservice to the United Nations and to humankind. His \r\nexemplary leadership and commitment to action in \r\naddressing the global challenges we are facing are \r\nappreciated by many of us. We wish him and his entire \r\nteam great success in the future. \r\n For over five years now, a number of countries in \r\nEastern Africa, including Tanzania, have been \r\nexperiencing unprecedented drought. We have never \r\nseen anything like this before. Maybe the effects of \r\nclimate change are taking a toll. As a result of this, \r\nagricultural production has been affected severely \r\ncausing acute food shortages. There is an acute \r\nshortage of pasture and water for our livestock and \r\nwildlife in the game parks that is resulting in the deaths \r\nof many of our animals. Rivers have been drying up \r\nfrequently thus causing interruptions in hydropower \r\ngeneration.  \r\n The effects of the drought are threatening to \r\nreach catastrophic proportions if the shortage of rain \r\ncontinues for the next few years. It is important for the \r\nUnited Nations to be aware of this growing danger and \r\nto look into ways of assisting us. We should not wait to \r\nact until graphic pictures of emaciated and dying \r\nchildren dominate TV screens and newspapers. \r\n History has taught us that the greatest successes \r\nin the development of nations began with agriculture. \r\nNo doubt, therefore, the low levels of development in \r\nAfrica today are indicative of the underdevelopment of \r\nour agriculture. Indeed, African agriculture is \r\nbackward and productivity is low. It needs to be \r\ntransformed, it needs to be modernized. The African \r\ngreen revolution has taken too long to happen. \r\n Concerted efforts by African Governments and \r\nAfrica’s development partners are required. \r\nUnfortunately, there is not as much interest on the part \r\nof our development partners to support agricultural \r\ntransformation in Africa as there is for other sectors. \r\nThis is an unfortunate omission which needs to be \r\ncorrected. We look to the United Nations to take the \r\nlead in this regard. \r\n Allow me to pay tribute to President Barack \r\nObama for demonstrating keen interest in assisting the \r\ntransformation and modernization of Africa’s \r\nagriculture. African leaders were humbled by his \r\ncommitment at the meeting he held with leaders from \r\nsub-Saharan Africa on 22 September of this year. I \r\nappeal to other leaders to emulate his example. \r\n Another issue that I would like to raise for \r\ndiscussion and action is the problem of youth \r\nunemployment in Africa. Africa faces one of the \r\nbiggest unemployment challenges on the planet. \r\nAfrican youth make up 37 per cent of the working age \r\npopulation in Africa, but they are 60 per cent of the \r\nA/64/PV.6  \r\n \r\n09-52425 18 \r\n \r\nunemployed. In some nations youth unemployment is \r\nup to 80 per cent. Africa has the fastest-growing and \r\nmost youthful population in the world. Over 20 per \r\ncent of Africa’s population is between the ages of 15 \r\nand 24. As a result, a constantly rising number of \r\nyoung Africans has been entering, and will continue to \r\nenter, a labour market that has not been fast-growing. \r\n Beyond economic costs, high rates of youth \r\nunemployment have had negative consequences in our \r\ncontinent. We have seen how some youths with no job \r\nprospects, and little hope of getting any, have become \r\nthe fuel being added to the raging fires of conflict in \r\nmany parts of our continent. They simply fall prey to \r\nthe machinations of war lords, criminal gangs and \r\npolitical manipulators, to the detriment of peace and \r\nstability in their countries. \r\n Creating job opportunities for Africa’s youth is an \r\nenormous task that Governments of our poor \r\neconomies cannot carry out alone. Friends of Africa in \r\nthe international community, both from Government \r\nand the private sector, have an important role to play in \r\nthat regard. Allow me to commend the Danish \r\nGovernment for showing the way. In April 2008, it \r\nformed the Danish Commission for Africa to address \r\nyouth unemployment challenges on the continent. The \r\nCommission, on which I was fortunate to serve, came \r\nup with five bold initiatives that I believe, if strong \r\ninternational partnership can be forged to implement \r\nthem, can turn the large youth unemployment problem \r\nfrom a challenge into an opportunity. I humbly ask this \r\nbody for the opportunity for the Commission’s report \r\nto be presented to the General Assembly. At the same \r\ntime, I propose that the Assembly consider declaring a \r\ndecade to focus on youth employment in Africa, \r\npossibly 2011 to 2020.  \r\n Two days ago, we held the fruitful high-level \r\nClimate Change Summit. I would like to thank \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon and commend him for \r\nhis leadership on this important and challenging issue \r\nof our time. The event will go a long way towards \r\npaving the way for a comprehensive agreement in \r\nCopenhagen in December 2009. \r\n It was heart-warming indeed to hear President \r\nBarack Obama assure this world body that the United \r\nStates will join other nations in the joint endeavour to \r\nsave our common planet. We are also happy that, under \r\nthe leadership of Prime Minister Gordon Brown of the \r\nUnited Kingdom, consensus has been emerging on \r\nmaking additional resources available to assist \r\ndeveloping nations in their efforts at adaptation, \r\nmitigation and the pursuit of clean development. \r\n Allow me now to talk about three side events that \r\nhave taken place during this session of the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n The first one was the panel discussion on \r\naccelerating the implementation of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), which was organized by \r\nMs. Helen Clark, the new Administrator of the United \r\nNations Development Programme, together with \r\nMr. Douglas Alexander, the United Kingdom’s Secretary \r\nfor International Development. At that meeting, \r\nimportant impressions were made about successes and \r\nshortcomings with regard to the implementation of the \r\nMDGs to date. The meeting was a curtain-raiser for \r\nnext year’s MDG summit. I hope all of us will take \r\nseriously the observations and conclusions that were \r\nmade, so that there will be no default come 2015. \r\n The second was the meeting on maternal and \r\nchild health convened by Prime Minister Gordon \r\nBrown with the support of Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon and World Bank President Robert Zoellick. \r\nThe meeting was a great success. I was impressed and \r\nencouraged by the commitment made by Prime \r\nMinister Brown and by the support of the World Bank \r\nto save the lives of millions of innocent mothers and \r\nchildren who die of causes that can be prevented. \r\nWhile I applaud and thank Prime Minister Brown for \r\nhis leadership, I appeal for unqualified support for the \r\noutcome of the meeting, for the sake of saving the lives \r\nof many women and children in Africa and elsewhere \r\nin the developing world. \r\n The third was yesterday’s launch of the African \r\nLeaders Malaria Alliance. That was a landmark event \r\nat which African leaders made an unequivocal \r\ndeclaration of commitment to end malaria in their \r\nrespective countries. The Alliance provides the \r\nmechanism for advocacy, collective action and follow-\r\nup on measures to build capacities to eliminate the \r\nnumber one killer disease in Africa. Malaria can be \r\nprevented, cured, controlled and eliminated in Africa. \r\nMany countries in the world have done so; why not us \r\nin Africa? I would like the General Assembly to \r\nacknowledge that historic event and render support to \r\nthe work of the African Leaders Alliance against \r\nmalaria. Once again, I would like to thank Mr. Ray \r\nChambers, the Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for \r\n A/64/PV.6\r\n \r\n19 09-52425 \r\n \r\nMalaria, for successfully organizing that event. I would \r\nalso like to thank all African leaders for their support \r\nand commitment. \r\n The gains made in the area of development can \r\neasily be eroded if the foundations of peace and \r\nstability are threatened. It is a matter of great comfort \r\nand pride that peace reigns in most parts of Africa, \r\nexcept for one or two hot spots — Somalia in \r\nparticular and, to some extent, Darfur. There is calm in \r\nthe eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo. Burundi is enjoying peace after many years of \r\ncivil war and instability, which has facilitated the \r\nreturn of many Burundi refugees from Tanzania. \r\nHowever, there are more than 160,000 Burundi \r\nrefugees who have chosen to remain in Tanzania and \r\nare applying to become Tanzanian citizens.  \r\n We have in principle accepted their request and \r\nare now finalizing the procedures to grant them \r\ncitizenship. However, I want this body to know that my \r\nGovernment has decided that, if accepted, they will be \r\nmoved from the refugee camps in which they reside at \r\nthe moment and will be resettled in various places in \r\nthe country. We do not want them to remain with the \r\nrefugee mentality. We also do not want Tanzanians to \r\ncontinue to consider them refugees. That is going to be \r\na very expensive exercise for which the support of the \r\nUnited Nations and other friends will be necessary. \r\n Tanzania remains committed to contribute to \r\npeace in Africa and the world. I promise that we will \r\ncontinue to play that historic role to the best of our \r\nability. In that regard, we are making good progress on \r\nour promise to scale up our participation in United \r\nNations peacekeeping operations. We have \r\npeacekeepers in the United Nations mission in \r\nLebanon, and we are ready to increase their number. \r\nWe are also in the final preparations of deploying a \r\nbattalion of peacekeepers in Darfur. We are going to \r\nhonour the request made by the United Nations to work \r\nwith the United Nations Organization Mission in the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) in the \r\ntraining of the armed forces of that country, under the \r\nMission’s security sector reforms for the country. My \r\nmessage today is that we are ready to do more \r\nwhenever requested. \r\n Let me add my voice in support of the two-State \r\nsolution for an Israel and a Palestine living together \r\nside by side at peace with one another. Tanzania is of \r\nthe strong opinion that that is the best way to \r\nsustainable peace in the Middle East.  \r\n With regard to Western Sahara, we call upon the \r\nSecurity Council to expedite the process of giving the \r\npeople of Western Sahara the opportunity to decide on \r\ntheir future status. That matter has dragged on for too \r\nlong, namely, since 1975. The time has come to end the \r\nimpasse. \r\n I would like to reiterate that the reform of the \r\nUnited Nations will be incomplete without the \r\nstructural reform of the Security Council. That reform \r\nshould include Africa’s attainment of two permanent \r\nseats in the Council. Giving seats to Africa is not a \r\nmatter of favour; it is a matter of correcting the \r\nhistorical injustice against the continent and its people. \r\n Let me conclude by echoing Africa’s appeal to \r\nthe United Nations and the international community to \r\nsupport Africa’s position with regard to unconstitutional \r\nchanges of Government in Africa. In recent years, the \r\nghosts of unconstitutional changes of Government have \r\nagain haunted Africa — through military coups and \r\nso-called mass action instigated by insatiable \r\ndemagogic politicians. There are people who want to \r\nget into leadership by using undemocratic shortcuts. \r\nThe African Union has taken a strong position, which \r\nis enshrined in its Constitutive Act, not to recognize \r\nsuch Governments and to suspend them from \r\nmembership of the organization until democracy is \r\nrestored.  \r\n Such decisions of the African Union would \r\nbenefit so much from, and actually would be \r\nstrengthened by, the support of the international \r\ncommunity and in particular the United Nations. Africa \r\nhas young polities, and its democracy is still fragile. \r\nWhat the African Union is trying to do is to entrench a \r\nculture of democratic values and governance. The \r\nsupport of the United Nations and the international \r\ncommunity is very critical in that regard. A decision to \r\nthe contrary would undermine the African Union’s \r\ngood intentions. Africa needs the United Nations to \r\nsupport that historic position. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the United Republic of Tanzania for the \r\nstatement he has just made.  \r\nA/64/PV.6  \r\n \r\n09-52425 20 \r\n \r\n Mr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, President of the \r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania, was escorted from \r\nthe General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Valdis Zatlers, President of the \r\nRepublic of Latvia \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Latvia. \r\n Mr. Valdis Zatlers, President of the Republic of \r\nLatvia, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Valdis Zatlers, President of the Republic of Latvia, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Zatlers: I wish to begin by \r\ncongratulating the President on his assumption of the \r\npresidency at this session of the General Assembly. I \r\npledge Latvia’s full support to him. \r\n This year marks the twentieth anniversary of a \r\nunique peaceful demonstration, namely, the Baltic \r\nWay. On 23 August 1989, more than 1 million people \r\njoined hands in a 600-kilometre-long human chain \r\nacross the three Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and \r\nLithuania. That event was dedicated to the fiftieth \r\nanniversary of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact between \r\nthe Stalinist Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. The Pact \r\nwas another mile marker leading to the Second World \r\nWar and the occupation of the three Baltic States. \r\n The Baltic Way served as a powerful symbol of \r\nthe drive for democracy and freedom in our three \r\nStates. The importance of the Baltic Way was so \r\nsubstantial that the United Nations Educational, \r\nScientific and Cultural Organization added it to the \r\nMemory of the World Register. The message of the \r\nBaltic Way is very clear, namely, that if people and \r\ncountries truly commit to a common goal, and if they \r\njoin their efforts, even the most difficult challenge can \r\nbe met successfully. \r\n A look at today’s world reveals that never before \r\nhas international cooperation been so important. Never \r\nbefore have we faced such a multitude of simultaneous \r\ncritical challenges of global significance. Many phrases \r\nhave been coined to describe the most severe problems: \r\nthe “three Es” crisis, for energy, economy and \r\nenvironment, and the “three Fs” crisis, for finance, \r\nfood and fuel. But no matter what name we use we \r\nmust remember that those global issues require urgent \r\nand concerted action at the global level. \r\n Since we met here last year, the financial crisis \r\nhas turned into a global economic crisis. It has struck \r\nthe world with its full strength. Consequences are \r\nbeing felt by every State and by every economy. They \r\nhave an effect on international policy and make us \r\nreconsider domestic policies as well. Latvia has \r\nundertaken painful but necessary adjustments to the \r\ndownturn. We have learned our lessons. I am confident \r\nthat our economy and the entire global economic \r\nsystem will come out of the crisis stronger than before. \r\n Current realities are serving to underline the \r\nvalues of inclusiveness, tolerance and compassion, not \r\nonly domestically but also in the international arena. It \r\nis self-evident that we can tackle the challenges only \r\nby joint efforts. We should use the crisis as a catalyst \r\nfor looking beyond our individual gains. We should \r\ntherefore use it to look at how we can promote an open \r\ninternational trade system. We hope for the prompt \r\nconclusion of the long-overdue round of talks on the \r\nDoha Development Agenda. \r\n Development is hard in times of crisis. \r\nDeveloping countries are particularly severely affected \r\nby its negative effects. We are well aware of the risk of \r\njeopardizing what has been done in achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. We must not give up. \r\nLatvia is honouring its commitments to achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. \r\n Climate change is a global challenge that needs to \r\nbe tackled at the global level. The United Nations \r\nSummit on Climate Change has demonstrated that it is \r\nimportant to reach a comprehensive and fair agreement \r\non future global climate policy at the Copenhagen \r\nConference, to be held in December of this year. Such \r\nan agreement should follow the principle of common \r\nbut differentiated responsibilities. Every country \r\nshould contribute according to its capabilities, but the \r\npolitical will of every nation is what matters most. \r\n The stability and security situation in a number of \r\ncountries and regions of the world is of particular \r\nconcern to the global community. Afghanistan is \r\ncertainly one of them. The holding of presidential \r\nelections in a fragile security situation was a \r\nsignificant achievement by the Afghan people. It is \r\ncrucial to pursue balanced international involvement in \r\n A/64/PV.6\r\n \r\n21 09-52425 \r\n \r\nAfghanistan, which should include both a civilian \r\nsurge and military efforts. We must continue our \r\nassistance to Afghanistan and other countries in the \r\nregion in order to prevent the threat of festering \r\nterrorism. It is important to understand that the value \r\nof local knowledge of the situation and of regional \r\ninvolvement cannot be overestimated. We remain \r\ncommitted to the rebuilding process in Afghanistan \r\nwhile paying special attention to upgrading its \r\ninfrastructure and strengthening its economy. Latvia \r\nhas contributed both military and civilian assistance to \r\nthe development of Afghanistan. \r\n Achieving peace in the Middle East is another \r\nissue that remains at the top of the international \r\nagenda. The two-State idea will become a reality only \r\nwhen the Israeli Government sincerely works to make \r\nit one. It will become a sustainable reality only when \r\nPalestinian leaders settle their own differences in the \r\ninterests of their people. This year, Latvia provided a \r\nrehabilitation programme for 18 Palestinian boys and \r\ngirls. They came to Latvia to participate in our \r\nrehabilitation programme for traumatized children \r\nfrom the Gaza Strip. Those children came to overcome \r\nthe psychological impact of the conflict they \r\nexperienced earlier this year. \r\n Latvia would like to reiterate its firm support for \r\nthe security and stability of Georgia, which must be \r\nbased on full respect for the principles of \r\nindependence, sovereignty and territorial integrity as \r\nrecognized by international law. The security situation \r\nin and around Georgia is still very fragile. We regret \r\nthat the Security Council failed to agree on the \r\ncontinuation of the United Nations Observer Mission \r\nin Georgia. Unfortunately, despite all the efforts by the \r\ninternational community, the Organization for Security \r\nand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) was forced to close \r\nits Mission in Georgia. \r\n As a result, this year we lost two important \r\ninternational instruments for promoting stability and \r\npeaceful conflict resolution in Georgia. Latvia strongly \r\nbelieves that the international community should \r\ncontinue to look for a solution. We should work to \r\nsecure a full and effective United Nations and OSCE \r\npresence in Georgia, including in Abkhazia and South \r\nOssetia. Meanwhile, it is ever more important to \r\nstrengthen the only remaining international mission, \r\nnamely, the European Union Monitoring Mission in \r\nGeorgia, which has convincingly proven its pivotal role \r\nin stabilizing the situation on the ground. We would \r\nalso like to stress the importance of the resolution on \r\nthe status of internally displaced persons and refugees \r\nfrom the Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South \r\nOssetia. The resolution is an important show of \r\ncommitment to fundamental humanitarian principles. \r\n Choosing leadership is the right and the \r\nresponsibility of the people. We recently witnessed the \r\npost-electoral crisis in Iran. We are concerned about \r\nthe deteriorating human rights situation and the violent \r\ncrackdowns there. If the Iranian Government seeks \r\nrecognition as the representative of its people, it should \r\nrespect human rights. If the Iranian Government seeks \r\nthe respect of the international community, it should \r\ncomply with the relevant resolutions of the Security \r\nCouncil. By doing so, Iran could become a genuine \r\ncontributor to peace and stability in the whole region. \r\n Latvia has been steadfast in the global efforts to \r\ncombat the proliferation of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction. We are sure that the 2010 Review \r\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons will be an \r\nimportant milestone in that process. Latvia is \r\nconvinced that it will promote the aims of \r\nnon-proliferation, disarmament and the use of nuclear \r\nenergy for exclusively peaceful purposes. \r\n This fall we will celebrate the sixtieth \r\nanniversary of the four Geneva Conventions. The \r\ncharacter of armed conflict is constantly changing, and \r\nnew challenges, such as terrorism, arise. Still, the \r\nGeneva Conventions remain the bedrock of \r\ninternational humanitarian law. Unfortunately, the \r\npolitical will to fully implement the Conventions \r\nremains insufficient. Violations of the provisions of the \r\nConventions and the norms of human rights law still \r\noccur. \r\n Latvia therefore strongly supports the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. It is a mechanism \r\ndesigned to fight impunity and to promote compliance \r\nwith the norms of international law. Latvia commends \r\nthe work of the Court. We also call on all States to \r\nfully cooperate with it.  \r\n Mr. Gomes (Guinea-Bissau), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n The concept of the responsibility to protect was \r\nagreed upon at the 2005 World Summit. Latvia \r\nsupports that concept. It is important to work towards \r\nits implementation. It would help us to create a world \r\nA/64/PV.6  \r\n \r\n09-52425 22 \r\n \r\norder where inactivity in the face of mass atrocities \r\nbecomes a thing of the past. \r\n Three years ago, the General Assembly decided \r\nto establish the Human Rights Council. The Council \r\nhas already achieved some results. The Universal \r\nPeriodic Review mechanism is one of its most notable \r\nsuccesses. However, we believe that that process can \r\nbe further improved to avoid abuse of its shortcomings \r\nin methodology and practice. The Human Rights \r\nCouncil will undergo a review in 2011. We believe that \r\nthe Council can become even more credible, as well as \r\nan effective body for the promotion and protection of \r\nhuman rights. \r\n Latvia has a long-standing commitment and \r\nexperience with promoting human rights. We are ready \r\nto share our experience in that area with the \r\ninternational community. Latvia has therefore put \r\nforward its candidacy for the Human Rights Council \r\nfor the year 2014. \r\n Latvia has always supported the strengthening of \r\nthe United Nations. The reform of the Security \r\nCouncil, aimed at enhancing the effectiveness and \r\nlegitimacy of its work, is an important part of the \r\noverall reform of the United Nations. The composition \r\nof the Security Council must reflect the realities and \r\ndynamics of today’s world. Latvia welcomes the \r\nbeginning of intergovernmental negotiations on \r\nSecurity Council reform. We also emphasize the \r\nimportance of continued progress in that area. \r\n We note with concern that, at a time of global \r\nrecession, the United Nations budget is increasing \r\nconsiderably. It is important to prioritize activities and \r\nto continue the reform of the United Nations. We \r\nwould also like to see more transparency and budgetary \r\ndiscipline in the process of budget planning and \r\nimplementation. \r\n Latvia is a candidate for next year’s elections to \r\nthe Economic and Social Council. We are willing to \r\nshare our experience in addressing global challenges, \r\nsuch as sustainable development, poverty eradication, \r\nthe implementation of good governance and the rule of \r\nlaw, fundamental freedoms and environmental stability.  \r\n Latvia is already building up its expertise on the \r\nfunctional commissions and activities related to the \r\nmandate of the Council. We are an active participant in \r\nthe United Nations Forum on Forests, the Commission \r\non Science and Technology for Development, the \r\nStatistical Commission, and the Commission on \r\nSustainable Development. \r\n The United Nations is the only truly universal \r\nforum for dialogue and action. All States, big and \r\nsmall, have the responsibility to contribute to the \r\nfruitful work of the United Nations. Let me assure the \r\nPresident that Latvia is ready to work closely with him \r\nand all Member States to make the sixty-fourth session \r\nof the General Assembly a successful one. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Latvia for the statement he \r\nhas just made. \r\n Mr. Valdis Zatlers, President of the Republic of \r\nLatvia, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Bingu Wa Mutharika, President of \r\nthe Republic of Malawi \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Malawi. \r\n Mr. Bingu Wa Mutharika, President of the \r\nRepublic of Malawi, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Bingu Wa Mutharika, President of the Republic of \r\nMalawi, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Mutharika: I wish to add my voice to \r\nthose who have spoken before me on the need for \r\neffective responses to global crises and for \r\nstrengthening multilateralism and dialogue among \r\ncivilizations for international peace, security and \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n I believe that there is no longer an excuse for \r\nworld leaders to be reluctant to move closer together \r\nand stimulate debate on how multilateralism and \r\ndialogue could be strengthened. We need to strengthen \r\ncollaboration so that the international community \r\nresponds effectively to such global challenges as \r\nclimate change, the financial and economic crisis, food \r\nand energy crises, armed conflicts, terrorism and, \r\nabove all, poverty reduction. \r\n A/64/PV.6\r\n \r\n23 09-52425 \r\n \r\n The first item on the multilateralism agenda is to \r\nreach a global consensus on reforming multilateral \r\ninstitutions, including the United Nations, to ensure the \r\nequitable and geographical representation of developed \r\nand developing countries alike. It is imperative that \r\ndeveloping nations have an effective voice on matters \r\nthat concern them. Therefore, the United Nations \r\nshould promote dialogue that ensures the inclusiveness, \r\ntransparency and accountability that are needed to \r\nattain genuine global peace, security and development. \r\n The Security Council must be made flexible to \r\nallow the countries of Africa, Asia, Latin America and \r\nthe Middle East to have fair representation in that \r\nbody. The continued monopoly of that body by the \r\nsuper-Powers is no longer justifiable. Developing \r\nnations cannot continue to be silent spectators in \r\nmatters that affect them. Every sovereign nation is an \r\nintegral part of the global village. Gone are the days \r\nwhen conflicts, wars and economic crises in Africa, \r\nSouth-East Asia, the Middle East and Latin America \r\nwere the concerns only of the peoples and \r\nGovernments in those areas. \r\n The second agenda item for multilateral dialogue \r\nis the attainment of world food security. Food \r\nshortages threaten the foundations of democracy and \r\ngood governance. The United Nations cannot sustain a \r\nworld system where huge populations live permanently \r\nwith hunger and starvation. This world body must find \r\na formula whereby the world can produce enough food \r\nfor all at affordable prices. I believe that it is possible \r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations to achieve \r\nglobal food security. \r\n Malawi has a well-organized agricultural \r\ndevelopment strategy and can contribute to United \r\nNations efforts in this matter. Malawi has, within a \r\nshort period of time, transformed itself from being a \r\nfood-deficit and hungry nation to a food-surplus \r\nnation. Malawi now produces enough food for all its \r\npeople, and we are able to export to neighbouring \r\ncountries. \r\n The key factor behind this success story is that \r\nMalawi has allocated huge budgetary resources and \r\nheavy investment to the agricultural sector. We have \r\nalso successfully introduced an agricultural input \r\nsubsidy programme that enables poor and low-income \r\nhouseholds to buy fertilizer, seeds and chemicals at a \r\nheavily subsidized price. As a result, poor smallholder \r\nfarmers have become more productive. At the same \r\ntime, there are visible signs of improvements in the \r\nstandard of living of the people, particularly in rural \r\nareas. \r\n The third agenda item for multilateral dialogue is \r\nto manage climate change. Malawi is happy that this \r\nmatter will be fully discussed at the Copenhagen \r\nConference later this year. At the national level, \r\nMalawi is responding to the challenge of climate \r\nchange through intensive irrigation farming and by \r\nmoving away from dependence on rain-fed agriculture. \r\nThe Government has introduced the Green Belt \r\nprogramme that will irrigate up to 1 million hectares of \r\nland for small-, medium- and large-scale farmers by \r\nharnessing water sources from the rivers and lakes to \r\nprovide extensive irrigation. We shall grow a broad \r\nrange of food crops, such as rice, wheat, maize, beans \r\nand lentils, as our way to contribute to resolving the \r\nworld food crisis. \r\n The threat of climate change is real. I believe that \r\nthe price of complacency will be much higher if we fail \r\nto act today. For Africa and developing countries \r\nelsewhere, we need to adequately address the issue of \r\ndeforestation, environmental degradation and \r\nagricultural productivity. We need to act now. \r\n Let me conclude by stating that we also need a \r\nglobal dialogue on democracy, good governance, \r\nhuman rights, the rule of law and the fight against \r\nterrorism in all its manifestations. We also need a new \r\nunderstanding of how developing nations can cope \r\nwith the shocks of global financial crises and \r\nescalating fuel prices. \r\n I believe that, working together, all nations of the \r\nworld, rich or poor, powerful or powerless, can \r\nstrengthen multilateralism and dialogue for lasting \r\ninternational peace, security and development. We live \r\nin one world. We have the same destiny. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Malawi for the statement \r\nhe has just made. \r\n Mr. Bingu Wa Mutharika, President of the \r\nRepublic of Malawi, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nA/64/PV.6  \r\n \r\n09-52425 24 \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Jalal Talabani, President of the \r\nRepublic of Iraq \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Iraq. \r\n Mr. Jalal Talabani, President of the Republic of \r\nIraq, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Jalal Talabani, President of the Republic of Iraq, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Talabani (spoke in Arabic): Permit me \r\nto congratulate our brother and friend Mr. Ali \r\nAbdussalam Treki on his assumption of the presidency \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. Let \r\nme assure him of our delegation’s assistance and \r\nsupport as he discharges his task. Given his wisdom \r\nand experience, we are certain that he will successfully \r\nfulfil the tasks assigned to him and further the \r\nobjectives of the United Nations. I would like also to \r\nthank his predecessor, Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann, \r\nfor his presidency of the General Assembly during the \r\nprevious session. \r\n The current political process in Iraq, ongoing \r\nsince the collapse of the former regime in 2003, has \r\nproduced radical political change, pushing towards \r\nbuilding a unified, independent and democratic federal \r\nIraq with respected constitutional institutions. \r\nRealizing these objectives has not been easy and has \r\nnot been without challenges, chief among which were \r\ndomestic and regional forces attempting to return Iraq \r\nto the period prior to the change. These forces have \r\nused various means to attain that goal, including \r\ncommitting the worst of crimes, allying themselves \r\nwith organized crime and joining with networks of \r\ninternational terrorism to disrupt the security and \r\nstability of Iraq. \r\n Significant developments have taken place in Iraq \r\nsince I stood here last year. The most important of \r\nthem were the signing of the agreement with the \r\nUnited States on the withdrawal of its troops, \r\norganization of the American forces’ temporary \r\npresence in Iraq and the signing of the Strategic \r\nFramework Agreement with the United States. Based \r\non that agreement, United States troops withdrew from \r\nIraqi cities at the end of last June, and Iraqi forces \r\nassumed responsibility for security throughout Iraq. \r\nThe security situation has greatly improved under the \r\nGovernment of National Unity, thanks to its tireless \r\nendeavours towards national dialogue and national \r\nreconciliation projects. These efforts seek to include all \r\npolitical parties and social groups, within the political \r\nprocess and outside it, that believe in the peaceful \r\ntransfer of power. The Iraqi Government is also \r\ncontinuing its policy of imposing law and order in \r\nconfronting terrorist groups, armed militias and \r\noutlaws, including those working to sabotage the \r\npolitical process and undermine security and stability \r\nin Iraq and the region. \r\n The year’s great successes for Iraq have brought \r\nprogress in its external relations. This year witnessed \r\nhigh-level visits from Arab, regional and other \r\ninternational Powers, many of which reopened their \r\nembassies in Baghdad. This has taken place within the \r\nframework of the Iraqi Government’s efforts to restore \r\nits international standing. The Iraqi Government will \r\ncontinue to deepen its good-neighbour policy of \r\nfriendship and cooperation in order to restore its role in \r\nthe Arab, regional and international communities, and \r\nto promote security and stability in the region. \r\n The economic situation also saw significant \r\nimprovement through a number of economic and \r\nfinancial laws enacted by the Iraqi Government, which \r\nled to increased personal income, purchasing power \r\nand social welfare services for our citizens. The Iraqi \r\nGovernment prepared an ambitious budget for this \r\nyear, aiming not only at reconstruction, but also at \r\nbuilding a sound and healthy economy to promote \r\nprogress and general prosperity. The Iraqi Government \r\nhas reviewed this budget and its economic programmes \r\nin the light of the financial crisis facing the world. \r\n Improvements in the economic sphere have \r\nencouraged a significant number of internally and \r\nexternally displaced Iraqis to voluntarily return to the \r\ncountry. The Iraqi Government has taken a series of \r\npractical measures and decisions aimed at facilitating \r\nthe voluntary return of displaced Iraqis because it \r\nbelieves that the best solution for them is to return to \r\ntheir homeland. We therefore call upon States hosting \r\nIraqi refugees and on international and civil society \r\norganizations aiding refugees to help promote a culture \r\nof voluntary return, because Iraq needs the capacities \r\nof all Iraqis to help build the future of their country. \r\n A/64/PV.6\r\n \r\n25 09-52425 \r\n \r\n The most important challenge we face in the near \r\nfuture is the round of legislative elections scheduled \r\nfor January 2010, for which the political parties have \r\nalready started preparations. Successful elections will \r\nsolidify the current political regime’s basis in \r\ndemocracy, pluralism and the peaceful transfer of \r\npower. Successful elections will move the political \r\nprocess forward from this initial stage to one of \r\npermanence and stability and will promote stability and \r\nsecurity in Iraq. They will also help us build national \r\ninstitutions strong enough to support a State that is \r\nbased on law and order, that is at peace with its own \r\npeople and its neighbours and that is a solid force for \r\nsecurity and stability in the region. This in turn will \r\nimprove Iraq’s Arab, regional and world relations and \r\nfoster its active return to the international community. \r\n The real danger currently facing Iraq is outside \r\ninterference in its internal affairs. The forces of such \r\ninterference have committed the worst crimes against \r\ninnocent Iraqis from many segments of society — men, \r\nwomen, children and the elderly. In an attempt to derail \r\nthe security and stability achieved in Iraq during 2008 \r\nand 2009, they have recently engaged in a series of \r\ncriminal bombings and terrorist attacks, the most \r\nrecent of which were the Bloody Wednesday \r\nexplosions of 19 August 2009, which targeted the Iraqi \r\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Finance — \r\nsovereign institutions of the country. These attacks \r\nkilled many innocent victims, including many \r\nGovernment employees, as well as foreign \r\nadministrators and diplomats.  \r\n These criminal acts claiming such large numbers \r\nof victims have reached the level of genocide and \r\ncrimes against humanity, which are subject to \r\npunishment under international law. We believe that \r\nacts at this level of organization, complexity and \r\nmagnitude could not have been planned, funded and \r\nimplemented without the support of external forces and \r\nparties. Indeed, preliminary investigations and \r\nevidence indicate the involvement of external parties in \r\nthese attacks. \r\n Therefore, the Government of the Republic of \r\nIraq wishes to place this important matter before the \r\nSecretary-General. Because of the nature and scope of \r\nthe crimes committed, which require an investigation \r\nbeyond Iraq’s jurisdiction, we request the Security \r\nCouncil to form an international independent \r\ninvestigation commission to refer those responsible to \r\na special international criminal court. The Iraqi \r\nGovernment found itself obliged to turn to the United \r\nNations to protect its people and stop the \r\nhaemorrhaging of innocent Iraqi lives. We seek the \r\ninternational community’s support and assistance in \r\nestablishing an independent international commission \r\nto investigate the crimes of terrorism against the Iraqi \r\npeople and to label those crimes as genocide. \r\n We look forward to improved cooperation and \r\ncoordination with neighbouring countries and other \r\nconcerned States to protect Iraq’s borders, exchange \r\ninformation, coordinate efforts, and to thwart groups \r\nthat support terrorism and work against Iraq under any \r\ncover. \r\n We are currently working towards the settlement \r\nof issues regarding Iraq vis-à-vis the Security Council; \r\nthese were inherited from the former regime and led to \r\ncommitments which we are attempting to meet. Iraq \r\nwill continue to work with relevant parties and \r\nstakeholders at the United Nations to reach a \r\nsettlement satisfactory to all parties and without \r\nprejudice to our obligations under Security Council \r\nresolutions. \r\n As a result of major positive developments that \r\nhave taken place in Iraq since the fall of the former \r\nregime and the removal of the dictatorship, the current \r\nsituation is fundamentally different from the situation \r\nthat existed when the Security Council adopted \r\nresolution 661 (1990). \r\n Along with the adoption of Security Council \r\nresolution 1859 (2008) and the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral pursuant to paragraph 5 of that resolution \r\n(S/2009/385), this shows that the time has come for the \r\nSecurity Council to act in response to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report pursuant to the aforementioned \r\nresolution, and on the basis of its responsibility for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. It \r\nshould review resolutions relevant to Iraq adopted \r\nunder Chapter VII, starting with resolution 661 (1990), \r\nwith a view to restoring Iraq’s international standing. \r\n Here, I must point out that since the collapse of \r\nthe former regime in 2003, Iraq has been eager to \r\nrespect international legitimacy and to deal with \r\nSecurity Council resolutions relevant to Iraq and to the \r\nsituation between Iraq and brotherly Kuwait with the \r\nhighest degree of responsibility and respect. \r\n The current Iraqi Government inherited political \r\nand financial burdens and difficult commitments from \r\nA/64/PV.6  \r\n \r\n09-52425 26 \r\n \r\nthe former regime through dozens of resolutions issued \r\nagainst the former regime because of its domestic \r\npractices and foreign policies. The Iraqi people are still \r\nbearing the consequences. After more than six years of \r\nhard and continuous work with the United Nations and \r\nits agencies, and within the framework of international \r\nand bilateral cooperation, Iraq has proven its desire and \r\ndetermination to return to the international community \r\nwith all its resources and capabilities. \r\n Therefore, because the situation which \r\nnecessitated the adoption of the aforementioned \r\nresolutions no longer exists, we request a clear \r\nresolution by the Security Council to terminate all \r\nresolutions issued under Chapter VII which affected \r\nthe sovereignty of Iraq and gave rise to financial \r\nobligations that are still binding on Iraq. \r\n We and the Iraqi people look forward to the day \r\nwhen Iraq is released from Chapter VII sanctions. In \r\nthis regard, I must point to the positive role of the \r\nUnited Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) \r\nin providing advice and assistance. The promotion of \r\nmutual endeavours and cooperation between Iraq and \r\nthe United Nations, and improved results of that \r\ncooperation in many fields, pursuant to Security \r\nCouncil resolution 1770 (2007) and other resolutions, \r\nrequire that the United Nations agencies and \r\ninstitutions step up their presence in Iraq, undertake \r\nfield activities and re-open their offices in Baghdad, as \r\nother diplomatic missions have done. \r\n The Iraqi Constitution sets the basic principles of \r\nIraq’s foreign policy, which focus on good-\r\nneighbourliness, non-interference in the internal affairs \r\nof other countries, the peaceful settlement of disputes \r\nand establishing international relations based on \r\ncommon interests and respect of Iraq’s international \r\nobligations. These are the established principles of \r\nIraq’s foreign policy. \r\n On this basis, we seek to establish the best \r\npossible relations with other Arab and Islamic \r\ncountries and are committed to the decisions of the \r\nLeague of Arab States and the Organization of the \r\nIslamic Conference. Accordingly, we endorse and \r\nsupport the struggle of the Palestinian people to uphold \r\ntheir inalienable rights, including the right to establish \r\nthe State of Palestine on the land of Palestine. \r\n We are also working to implement the legitimate \r\ninternational resolutions concerning the return of \r\noccupied Arab land. We consider the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative to be a practical step in the right direction \r\ntowards resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict in order to \r\nachieve security, peace and stability in the Middle East. \r\nWe call for the Middle East to be made a zone free of \r\nnuclear weapons and other weapons of mass \r\ndestruction, so as to promote opportunities to achieve \r\npeace and security in the region. \r\n In this context, we call upon all States that have \r\nnot yet acceded to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \r\nTreaty to do so and to be bound by its provisions. \r\nFollowing years of isolation during the previous \r\nregime, Iraq seeks to form a new integrated economic \r\npartnership with the international community through \r\nthe International Compact with Iraq. The Iraqi \r\nGovernment, in cooperation with the United Nations, is \r\nworking towards convening the second review \r\nconference, to be held in Baghdad next November. We \r\nwill seek the greatest degree of international \r\nparticipation at the conference, following on from the \r\nsuccess of the first review conference, held in \r\nStockholm last year. \r\n The current political process in Iraq is aimed at \r\nbuilding a federal, democratic and unified Iraq where \r\nthe Iraqi people work under constitutional institutions, \r\nthe rule of law, protection of human rights and full \r\nrespect for all segments of society. We attach key \r\nimportance to our ability and potential, as a country \r\nrich in natural and human resources, to achieve these \r\ngoals. \r\n However, at this most critical stage, we need \r\npolitical and economic support and international \r\ncooperation to gain firm footing that will enable us to \r\nmove towards a future where we will be able not only \r\nto develop our country and our people but also to \r\ncooperate with the international community in \r\nachieving peace, security and sustainable development \r\nfor all peoples. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Iraq for the statement he \r\nhas just made. \r\n Mr. Jalal Talabani, President of the Republic of \r\nIraq, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\n A/64/PV.6\r\n \r\n27 09-52425 \r\n \r\nAddress by Al Hadji Yahya Jammeh, President of the \r\nRepublic of the Gambia \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of the Gambia. \r\n Al Hadji Yahya Jammeh, President of the \r\nRepublic of the Gambia, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency  \r\nAl Hadji Yahya Jammeh, President of the Republic of \r\nthe Gambia, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Jammeh: I would like first of all to \r\nthank almighty Allah for granting us yet another \r\nopportunity for a gathering of world leaders. My \r\ndelegation would like to thank President Obama, the \r\nGovernment and people of the United States of \r\nAmerica, and the leadership of the United Nations for \r\ntheir warm welcome and the facilities placed at our \r\ndisposal since our arrival. \r\n Permit me also to congratulate Mr. Miguel \r\nd’Escoto Brockmann on his inspiring leadership and on \r\nconducting the affairs of the sixty-third session so well. \r\nBy the same token, I extend warm felicitations to \r\nMr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at this important \r\nsixty-fourth session. He has the full support of my \r\ndelegation. Our special thanks go to Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon for his stewardship and the commitment \r\nhe has shown to the welfare of humanity, particularly \r\nof Africa. \r\n “Effective responses to global crises: \r\nstrengthening multilateralism and dialogue among \r\ncivilizations for international peace, security and \r\ndevelopment”, the theme adopted for this year’s \r\nsession, is indeed apt and relevant. It calls on every \r\nnation, big or small, to adopt multilateralism and \r\ndialogue in fostering international partnership on all \r\nmatters of common concern surrounding global peace \r\nand development. \r\n The complexities of today’s world are such that \r\nno nation can successfully confront them alone. Some \r\nissues cannot even be resolved by regional groups \r\nacting independently. Much can be achieved only when \r\nwe all collaborate and work together within the \r\nframework of multilateralism based on mutual \r\nunderstanding, respect and, above all, sincerity, strong \r\ncommitment and universal justice under the same rule \r\nof law and equity. \r\n Our global body, the United Nations, has indeed \r\nadopted countless resolutions, which, if implemented \r\nto the letter, would have made this world a better place \r\nfor all humankind and indeed other creatures on our \r\nplanet. Unfortunately, there are some Member States \r\nthat block well-meaning resolutions necessary for the \r\nmaintenance of world peace and even question or \r\ndisregard with impunity resolutions adopted by this \r\nbody.  \r\n As long as this continues to be the order of the \r\nday, the United Nations will remain united in name \r\nonly, unable to achieve in full the fundamental \r\nobjectives for which it was established. The modus \r\noperandi of the Organization therefore needs urgent \r\nreforms to ensure that such impunity is eliminated and \r\nthat the principle of equality among nation States, \r\nirrespective of their geopolitical size, location, \r\neconomic circumstances, race or religion is \r\nsafeguarded. Double standards have no place in the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n There cannot be peace and security in the absence \r\nof justice for all. There cannot be justice in the face of \r\nabject poverty characterized by hunger, starvation, \r\ndisease and a lack of basic social services as a result of \r\nexploitation. There cannot be justice if there is \r\nmerciless exploitation, suppression and criminal \r\ninvasion of sovereign States. There cannot be peace if \r\nthere is no development as a result of marginalization, \r\ninjustice and racism. Unfortunately, injustice, racism, \r\nmerciless exploitation and marginalization, especially \r\nas inflicted on developing nations by developed \r\nnations, are the order of the day. \r\n Africa and Africans are the poorest of the poor, \r\ndespite the fact that the African continent is the world’s \r\nrichest in terms of mineral and other natural resources. \r\nThe sad truth is that, despite the fact that the African \r\ncontinent is the source of 90 per cent of the precious \r\nminerals, gemstones and strategic raw materials for the \r\nindustrialized North, we Africans are the poorest of the \r\npoor. \r\n It is no fault of ours if we Africans are poor \r\ntoday. This situation has been brought about by the \r\nperennial invasions of the locusts and their permanent \r\npresence in Africa. They devour 90 per cent of our \r\nuseful resources, from agricultural and mineral to flora \r\nA/64/PV.6  \r\n \r\n09-52425 28 \r\n \r\nand fauna. These locusts are present in all resource-rich \r\nAfrican countries today. This devastating permanent \r\ninvasion is exacerbated by another destructive \r\nphenomenon — the permanent drought that affects all \r\nAfrican countries without exception. We cannot do \r\nanything about these two deadly scourges of the \r\nAfrican continent. In the case of the locusts, they are \r\nprotected by a one-sided international treaty imposed \r\non all third-world countries, not only Africa. As for the \r\ndrought, it is even worse, since no irrigation system in \r\nAfrica can eradicate it. \r\n The locusts I am talking about are the \r\nmultinational Western companies that exploit our \r\nnatural resources and agricultural produce, taking \r\n95 per cent of their financial value and leaving us, the \r\nowners of the resources, with 5 per cent or less at most. \r\nIs it not interesting that, with respect to the mining of \r\nAfrican mineral resources, only four African countries \r\nreceive more than a 3 per cent royalty from these \r\nmultinational mining companies? The rest receive only \r\na 3 per cent royalty or even less. In the case of \r\npetroleum exploitation, few African countries receive \r\nabove a 15 per cent royalty. \r\n There is nothing African countries can do about \r\nthis because these locusts have an absolute monopoly \r\nof the technologies used in the extractive industries. \r\nThe treaty that makes it impossible for us to do \r\nanything about it is called globalization, which means \r\nthe exploitation of poor third-world countries’ \r\nresources by the rich first-world countries. With \r\nregards to the drought — that is, the debt burden — \r\nvery few rich countries have cancelled the debt owed \r\nthem by third-world countries. This excruciating \r\nburden of debt consumes 80 per cent of the 3 to 5 per \r\ncent left by the multinational companies. \r\n Our agricultural produce, such as tea, coffee and \r\ncocoa, is bought at prices fixed by the buyers, in most \r\ncases at an average price of less than $1 per kilo. The \r\nsame produce is then sold at more than $15 per kilo \r\nwhen processed. Thus, for every kilogram of our \r\nagricultural produce worth $15 on the Western market, \r\nwe get only $1. How can Africa develop and emerge \r\nfrom this abject poverty? \r\n African resources have been looted continuously \r\nfrom the eleventh century to date. Everything in Africa \r\nthat the locusts set their eyes on is looted even today. \r\nEven dead bodies have not been spared by the locusts. \r\nGraves were and are being desecrated and human \r\nbodies called mummies have been stolen from Africa. \r\nIn such a situation, where even Africans in their graves \r\nare not spared by these rampaging locusts, who in his \r\nright mind could expect us in Africa to develop and \r\nbecome rich? In Africa, “R.I.P.” on a tombstone, which \r\nnormally means “Rest In Peace”, has never been \r\nrespected. “R.I.P.” really means “Respected If Poor” — \r\nthat is, the body in the tomb will rest only if it was not \r\nburied with any precious jewellery. \r\n The United Nations must come to the rescue of \r\nAfrica. Otherwise, we Africans stand ready to liberate \r\nourselves from this eternal bondage at any cost. From \r\nnow on, the African Union will work towards ensuring \r\nthat African nations and our farmers receive their \r\nrightful share of our God-given natural and agricultural \r\nresources. We will no longer accept less than 65 per \r\ncent of the proceeds from our natural resources. \r\n We Africans have been suffering for too long at \r\nthe hands of Westerners and we will put an end to this. \r\nIt is African sweat, blood, tears and natural resources \r\nthat have built the North throughout almost five \r\ncenturies of merciless and racist exploitation that \r\ncontinues today. Enough is enough. Instead of being \r\nrespected, we are being called all sorts of names and \r\ngiven all sorts of unsolicited titles — dictators, corrupt \r\nleaders, failed States and even rogue States.  \r\n We, the new generation of African leaders, will \r\nseek to put an end to this humiliating, degrading and \r\nracist treatment by any means necessary. The world \r\nwill not live in peace and security as long as this \r\ndehumanizing and racist status quo continues to prevail \r\nwith regard to the continent of Africa and to Africans. \r\nWe have been forced to endure this for far too long and \r\nnow we are going to put an end to it, as we have ended \r\napartheid in South Africa, by force if necessary. We \r\nwill defend our humanity, our dignity, our resources, \r\nour interests and our culture from this moment \r\nforward. \r\n HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis are killer \r\ndiseases. While I would like to reiterate my \r\ndelegation’s support for the work of the Global Fund in \r\nfighting these diseases, I wish to call for concerted \r\nefforts to mobilize resources to support international \r\nresearch on traditional medicine and alternative disease \r\ntreatment programmes. These traditional systems are in \r\nmost instances more cost-effective, yet they have been \r\nabandoned due to the sort of criticism that come from \r\nmultinationals threatened that certain traditional \r\n A/64/PV.6\r\n \r\n29 09-52425 \r\n \r\nbreakthroughs would be detrimental to their corporate \r\nexistence and interests. These multinationals value \r\ntheir monetary gains more than human life. They \r\nshould not be allowed to hold humanity to ransom. \r\nTheir insatiable appetite for massive wealth at any cost \r\nhas pushed them to the point of blindness, insensitivity \r\nto human suffering and the loss of human life in the \r\ndeveloping world, especially in Africa. \r\n With regard to international peace and security, \r\nmy delegation calls once again for stronger and more \r\nhonest international cooperation and dialogue in \r\naddressing conflict prevention, the peaceful resolution \r\nof disputes and respect for the cultural values, norms \r\nand ways of life of others. We must respect the fact that \r\nhumanity was created to be diverse, just as planet Earth \r\nhas different regions, each with its own diverse \r\nclimatic and ecological system. Therefore, there is \r\nbound to be diversity in the colour of our skin, \r\ndiversity in the way we live and differences in our \r\nbeliefs. Diverse as we may be, we are part and parcel \r\nof the one human family created by the one and only \r\nGod, Allah. If we accept the principle that we are all \r\nhuman beings equal before the only God that created \r\nus, and that differences in religion and skin colour do \r\nnot make one person less human than another, then we \r\nwill all live in perfect peace and harmony in this global \r\nvillage called the world. \r\n The problem is that some play God and believe \r\nthat, by virtue of the colour of their skin, they are \r\nbetter than the rest of humanity and therefore should \r\ndictate to them how they should live and how they \r\nshould worship God. They impose their value systems \r\non the rest of humanity. This unacceptable dictatorship \r\nis the source of all the world’s major conflicts and a \r\ncontributing factor to persistent threats to world peace. \r\n Racism is on the rise. Extremist hate-mongers are \r\nincreasing in number and rising in rank. Instead of \r\nbeing condemned as criminals and terrorists, they are \r\nlabelled the far right, neo-Nazis or supremacists, and \r\ntolerated and even encouraged by the same Powers that \r\nwould happily bomb them back to the Stone Age if \r\nthey were Muslim, black African or Asian. As long as \r\nthis status quo persists, peace and security will \r\ncontinue to be an elusive dream as people, rich or poor, \r\nMuslim or non-Muslim, black or Asian, are bound to \r\ndefend their human dignity at any price. \r\n My delegation therefore calls for a united front \r\nagainst this dictatorship of a few over the rest of \r\nhumanity. And in the interest of our collective security, \r\nthe United Nations should see to the total elimination \r\nof racism and hatred in all their forms, whatever it \r\ntakes, so that we can bequeath to the generations of \r\nhumanity yet unborn a very peaceful and prosperous \r\nworld devoid of destitution, exploitation and \r\nmarginalization. \r\n In this context, my delegation would like to see a \r\nspeedy resolution of the plight of the Palestinians. We \r\ncall on the State of Israel to accept and respect the \r\ntwo-State solution that the international community has \r\nso clearly articulated without preconditions. We also \r\nurge the Security Council to ensure that its resolutions \r\nare respected by all States and enforced to the letter \r\nand spirit by the United Nations, and not to allow \r\ncertain States to choose not only to ignore these \r\nresolutions, but to violate them with impunity, while \r\nother States face drastic and devastating military action \r\nif such resolutions are adopted against them and they \r\nso much as ask for clarification. \r\n The State of Israel has ignored and violated all \r\nUnited Nations resolutions and conventions with \r\nregard to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, not only with \r\nimpunity, but also with the support and protection of \r\ncertain world Powers, while other countries have paid a \r\nvery high price merely for not having fully complied \r\nwith a Security Council resolution. The Council should \r\nstop employing these unfortunate double standards. \r\nThe United Nations must not be turned into an “animal \r\nfarm”. \r\n Secondly, there is also the lingering issue of the \r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan. My delegation holds the \r\nposition that Taiwan should be invited to participate in \r\nall meetings and activities of the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change and the \r\nInternational Civil Aviation Organization, among other \r\nbodies. Taiwan has a legitimate right to full \r\nmembership of all United Nations specialized agencies, \r\nsince even non-governmental organizations have either \r\nfull membership or observer status in those agencies. \r\nTaiwan, a democratic State with a population of \r\n23 million, is still being denied this fundamental \r\nhuman right, which the United Nations is supposed to \r\nuphold and protect in the first place.  \r\n My delegation also hereby calls on the United \r\nNations to urge the United States of America to \r\nimmediately and unconditionally lift its embargo on \r\nCuba, in accordance with the wishes of more than \r\nA/64/PV.6  \r\n \r\n09-52425 30 \r\n \r\n98 per cent of the membership of this body. That trade \r\nembargo continues to hurt Cuban women and children. \r\nThe Cuban children born into those extreme hardships \r\nhave committed no crime. The punishment of women \r\nand children because of political differences is a very \r\nserious violation of their rights. \r\n Thirdly, my delegation renews its full support for \r\nthe territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Kingdom \r\nof Morocco. On the question of the Moroccan Sahara, \r\nwe remain convinced that the proposal of the \r\nMoroccan Government to grant substantive autonomy \r\nto the Saharan region on the basis of the negotiations \r\ninitiated by the Security Council and conducted and \r\nagreed by the parties would lead to a lasting and \r\npeaceful resolution of the conflict. \r\n Finally, my delegation has been following keenly, \r\nbut with deep dismay, the protracted negotiations on \r\nreform of the Security Council and a seeming \r\nconnivance to prevent such reform. Africa would like \r\nto see Council reform undertaken, with balanced \r\nrepresentation of all continents in the Council. My \r\ndelegation therefore urges the President of the General \r\nAssembly to make more effort on the issue during the \r\nsixty-fourth session and to ensure that the continent of \r\nAfrica has at least two permanent seats on the Security \r\nCouncil with full veto powers; if it does not, any \r\nresolution adopted by the Council will not be binding \r\non Africa or any African Union member State by the \r\nend of 2010. Africa, a continent 10 times the size of \r\nEurope, does not have a single permanent seat on the \r\nSecurity Council, while Europe has more than one. \r\n Africa has been subjected to discrimination, \r\nmarginalization, exploitation and humiliation for a very \r\nlong time. We Africans are no longer going to accept \r\nthat status quo. We will put an end to it very soon. \r\nMembers should take my words seriously. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of the Gambia for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n Al Hadji Yahya Jammeh, President of the \r\nRepublic of the Gambia, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.  \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Fernando Lugo Méndez, President of \r\nthe Republic of Paraguay \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Paraguay. \r\n Mr. Fernando Lugo Méndez, President of the \r\nRepublic of Paraguay, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Fernando Lugo Méndez, President of the Republic \r\nof Paraguay, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Lugo Méndez (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nshould like at the outset to express my sincerest \r\ncongratulations to Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his \r\nelection to preside over the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-fourth session. I also wish to express the thanks \r\nof the delegation of Paraguay to Mr. Miguel d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann, President of the Assembly at its sixty-third \r\nsession, for the progress made during his tenure.  \r\n I wish to begin by discussing what is most \r\nimportant: life. I cannot forget that, while the first \r\nparagraph of the preamble of the Charter of the United \r\nNations states that our peoples, gathered together, are \r\ndetermined to save succeeding generations from the \r\nscourge of war, the murderous onslaught of warplanes \r\nhas continued to kill, mutilate and traumatize children \r\nin many civilian populations; in national coffers, \r\namounts allocated to the death budget, glibly labelled \r\n“defence expenditures”, continue to swell; and the \r\nmilitary industries of the world’s most powerful \r\ncountries continue to reap the most lucrative benefits \r\nwithout any questions from politicians or any outrage \r\non the part of the international news networks, in a \r\ngame of perverse hypocrisy that is undermining our \r\nfuture with lies disguised as imposed truths. \r\n We are very rigorous in estimating the high \r\nglobal costs of containing and providing public health \r\ninsurance for pandemics such as H1N1 influenza. But \r\nwe forget that our “defence expenditures”, promoted \r\nby the great weapons industries from high, snow-\r\ncovered summits of complacency, end up exchanging a \r\ncontainer of vaccine for a rifle or a significant part of \r\nthe public health budget for a warplane.  \r\n The United Nations was born to promote peace \r\nand to eradicate war. However, the voracious traffic in \r\n A/64/PV.6\r\n \r\n31 09-52425 \r\n \r\narms continues to pass through our countries with its \r\nconvoys of machine guns, missiles and grenades. \r\nSelect regions of the world continue to be opportunistic \r\nenclaves for the trade of the merchants of death. \r\nConflicts that mutilate, destroy and kill neighbours and \r\ncondemn them forever to disgrace are at the same time \r\nopportunities for those who profit by, foment, create \r\nand manage the business of war. \r\n Who questions the bloodstained bank notes that \r\nlie untouched in the vaults of the most powerful bank? \r\nWe are face to face in this Hall, but truly we, the \r\nGovernments of the countries of the world, rich, poor \r\nand very poor, are face to face with history. If we could \r\njust for one minute believe in the great tenets of \r\nequality and the shared rights of the human race, it \r\nwould be time enough to ask ourselves the question: \r\nHow much longer will the warlords continue to \r\nmaximize their future income on the physical \r\nelimination of human beings? \r\n My country, Paraguay, declares before the world \r\nthat we are absolutely committed to peace. My \r\nGovernment is not prepared to spend the cost of a loaf \r\nof bread on weapons or war machinery. Any \r\ninvestment in defence must be the bare minimum \r\ncompared to the social expenditures of the \r\nGovernment. Paraguay will not pawn its daily bread to \r\ndance the blind waltz of the warlords.  \r\n We believe that, in the context of globalization, \r\nthere should be a call for the creation of a new world \r\neconomic order capable of eliminating the sharp \r\ncontrasts of the present and the clearly unequal access \r\nto the benefits of contemporary development. In that \r\nrespect, I should like to describe the reality of life in \r\nParaguay today. Our situation is essentially very \r\nsimilar to that of other countries that are also at the \r\nmercy of serious socio-economic problems.  \r\n A little more than a year ago, a historic transition \r\noccurred in Paraguay that left our economy in \r\ntatters — with backward and obsolete production \r\nmechanisms, weak democratic institutions rife with \r\ncorruption, barely credible political parties and a lack \r\nof channels for civic participation in the \r\ndecision-making process. Society was riven by serious \r\ncontrasts, including about 40 per cent of the population \r\nliving in poverty, tens of thousands of unemployed, \r\nhigh levels of migration, and unscrupulous minorities \r\nwho lived well and sought to perpetuate their \r\nillegitimate privileges.  \r\n Those traits are shared by the majority of \r\ncountries represented here, which, over and above their \r\nindividual circumstances, like Paraguay are facing the \r\nthreefold challenge of modernizing their economies, \r\nstrengthening their participatory democracies, and \r\neliminating serious and severe social inequities. As in \r\nParaguay, in all poor countries the causes of the \r\nscourges we have suffered can be traced to the \r\nentrenchment of systems without justice or equality \r\nthat ultimately widen the gaps between the rich \r\ncountries and the poor. \r\n We have sought in vain to mask the failures of the \r\npolicies of recent decades with ostensibly technical \r\nterms that do little to describe the pathetic global \r\nreality. For example, we speak of least developed \r\ncountries, middle-income countries and developing \r\ncountries when the simple fact is that today we live in \r\na world where there are countries that benefit until they \r\ncan benefit no longer from world growth, while others \r\nare left behind and condemned to poverty. \r\n Since the United Nations was established, our \r\nunavoidable obligation has been to proceed fearlessly \r\nto change that reality. We must give serious thought to \r\na new world economic order with simple and specific \r\naims. First, we must promote and strengthen small \r\neconomies based on the fair and equitable distribution \r\nof the benefits of the production of wealth. We must \r\nput an end to inequitable trade relationships and \r\ndevelop effective policies of solidarity with those \r\ncountries that endure adverse geographical or climate \r\nconditions.  \r\n Secondly, we must promote the healthy political \r\ndevelopment of all nations of the world and ensure that \r\nthe most powerful countries do not interfere in local \r\naffairs, above all when these interventions seek to \r\ndestabilize genuine democratic processes. I would like \r\nto clearly reaffirm my concern over events in the \r\nbrotherly Republic of Honduras following the savage \r\ncoup d’état that opened a gaping wound in the heart of \r\nour regional democracy. \r\n Thirdly, we must promote peaceful solutions to \r\ninternational conflicts, firmly resolved to reduce the \r\nalarming levels of militarization and armament.  \r\n Fourthly, we must advocate an end to the harmful \r\ncriminal attacks on the environment, including global \r\nwarming and the natural disasters that occur with \r\nincreasing frequency. We the peoples of the South are \r\npaying the growing and unsustainable social, \r\nA/64/PV.6  \r\n \r\n09-52425 32 \r\n \r\nenvironmental and financial costs of climate change. In \r\nthe meantime, those States that bear greatest \r\nresponsibility for global warming are not shouldering \r\ntheir obligations or the growing socio-environmental \r\ndebt that they generate. They are perpetuating and \r\naggravating a clearly unjust situation that must be \r\nreversed. As a matter of justice and urgency, we must \r\nheed the calls of the most vulnerable people on the \r\nplanet.  \r\n Fifthly and finally, we must promote gender \r\nequality and put an end to discrimination of all kinds \r\nbased on sexual, political or ideological preferences or \r\nracial, ethnic or religious differences. In sum, it is a \r\nmatter of developing a better and more humane world \r\non the way towards a kinder living environment that is \r\nmore supportive and much more in keeping with the \r\nfuture of humankind.  \r\n I am fully aware of the scope of the challenge \r\nthat I am suggesting. I am also completely aware of the \r\ndifficulties that we will encounter in this epic fight, but \r\nin the twenty-first century we cannot continue to \r\noverlook an in-depth and open debate on realities of \r\nconcern. \r\n I do not in any way underestimate the relevant \r\nrole that the United Nations has played in its relatively \r\nshort existence in promoting world peace and equitable \r\nsocial development, but we must not ignore the \r\ndecades of failure with regard to comprehensive \r\nmodernization, much less fail to creatively and \r\nresolutely make use of the greatest world forum of \r\ntoday. \r\n There is no time to lose. Historical justice and \r\nredress of the rich countries to the poor ones must be a \r\npriority on the agenda of the United Nations. In order \r\nfor the United Nations to meet that important goal, we \r\nmust support the General Assembly’s adoption of the \r\nnecessary reforms, so as to reaffirm its inherent nature \r\nas a representative, democratic and equitable organ. We \r\nmust uphold the precedence of its bodies over other \r\ninternal organs of the Organization, such as the \r\nSecurity Council, in order to underscore the processes \r\nthat will help build that greatly desired social justice. \r\n The Security Council, as the organ entrusted with \r\nthe maintenance of world peace, must also be \r\nreformed, not only so as to give it greater legitimacy \r\nby increasing its representativeness, but also so as to \r\nadopt new working methods to reflect a new \r\nmulti-centred world order, founded on relations of \r\ncooperation, solidarity and peace, in which the \r\ncommunity and human dignity are at the centre of \r\nevery decision.  \r\n It is difficult to say this in such a hallowed Hall \r\nbut it is worth recalling that, at this very moment, \r\nthousands of people are dying of hunger in the world \r\nthat we shape. The ease with which television news \r\nswitches between pictures of pitiful children \r\noverpowered by appalling hunger and figures for the \r\nbrutal arms business of the industrialized countries \r\nexposes human indifference.  \r\n Once and for all, we must believe in — and \r\ncreate — a different planet that is able to retrieve its \r\nvast natural wealth, having put an end to the terrible \r\nhavoc wrought by petty interests. We must believe in a \r\nfairer and more balanced international economic \r\nsystem, in which the huge discrepancies are a thing of \r\nthe past. I believe in the great solidarity of human \r\nbeings. I believe in the dreams of great leaders who \r\ndefiantly changed the world. I believe in Jesus Christ, \r\nin Gandhi and in Martin Luther King. \r\n Before ending my comments, I would like to take \r\nthis opportunity to set out some clear positions on \r\npressing matters that affect us. \r\n First, I would like to say that the economic crisis \r\nthat began in the major Powers and spread worldwide \r\nhas had serious consequences in all countries. It has \r\nbrought about a rapid destruction of accumulated \r\nwealth. Unemployment has risen to unprecedented \r\nlevels. The number of poor has increased. The crisis \r\nhas jeopardized dozens of democratic political \r\nprocesses.  \r\n Secondly, I would like to resolutely state that the \r\nviolent rupture in the constitutional process in \r\nHonduras is a tremendous setback for the \r\nre-democratization of Latin America. Those involved \r\nin the coup who dealt a resounding blow to the \r\nhonourable face of the continent’s democracy are \r\nresponsible for the human sacrifices and the \r\ntremendous social unrest that is taking place. I would \r\nlike to state my explicit solidarity and that of my \r\npeople with Manuel Zelaya and the people of \r\nHonduras, who are bravely standing up to the effects of \r\nthe coup. \r\n Thirdly, I would ask the peoples and the \r\nGovernments represented here to vigorously condemn \r\nthe trade embargo that the largest economy in the \r\n A/64/PV.6\r\n \r\n33 09-52425 \r\n \r\nworld imposes on Cuba — another intolerable chapter \r\nthat, while it lasts, undermines the credibility of any \r\ndiscussion on pluralism, tolerance and humanism in \r\nthese forums. We have complete faith in a new vision \r\nthat breaks with the past and its uncompromising \r\ndivisions. We believe that the hopes of Latin America \r\nand the Caribbean with regard to the humanistic \r\napproach towards Cuba of the new leadership of the \r\nmost powerful country on Earth will be met sooner \r\nthan later. \r\n Fourthly and lastly, I would like to state open \r\nconcern about the sinister currents circling in the world \r\nwith the unbridled arms race that can in no way be \r\njustified and can only be welcomed by the industries of \r\ndeath and barbarity. We must defuse the tensions that \r\nfoster that interest in weapons and we must urgently \r\nclarify the elements that obscure the prospect for peace \r\nthroughout the world.  \r\n I reaffirm the commitment of my small and \r\nhumble country to supporting any and all initiatives \r\nthat seek to build a better world for future generations.  \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Paraguay for the statement \r\nhe has just made. \r\n Mr. Fernando Lugo Méndez, President of the \r\nRepublic of Paraguay, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Mohamed Nasheed, President of the \r\nRepublic of Maldives  \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Maldives. \r\n Mr. Mohamed Nasheed, President of the Republic \r\nof Maldives, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Mohamed Nasheed, President of the Republic of \r\nMaldives, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Nasheed: I should like to begin by \r\nextending to His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki \r\nmy delegation’s warmest congratulations on his \r\nelection to preside over the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-fourth session. I assure him of the full support \r\nand cooperation of my delegation. I also take this \r\nopportunity to express our most profound appreciation \r\nto his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Miguel \r\nd’Escoto Brockmann, for the exemplary manner in \r\nwhich he guided our work at the sixty-third session. \r\n I should also like to record my delegation’s \r\nheartfelt gratitude to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \r\nfor his inspiring leadership and dedication in \r\npromoting the noble principles and ideals of this \r\nOrganization. \r\n This is the first time the General Assembly has \r\nbeen addressed by a democratically elected President \r\nof the Maldives. I am extremely pleased to be here. I \r\nhave spent many of the past General Assembly sessions \r\nlocked in a hot, humid, damp cell with my hands \r\nshackled and my feet bound, imprisoned for my \r\nconviction that the 300,000 people of the Maldives \r\nshould be free from fear, free from want and free to \r\nlive their lives in liberty and in dignity. \r\n I would like to thank the international community \r\nfor its invaluable support in securing our democratic \r\ntransition. Reformers in the Maldives and our friends \r\nin the United Nations should feel justifiably proud that \r\nour island home was able to mark last year’s first \r\nInternational Day of Democracy in the best possible \r\nway: by throwing off a 30-year-old autocracy and \r\nsecuring a smooth, peaceful and democratic transfer of \r\npower. \r\n Just as the international community played a key \r\nrole in securing the Maldives’ democratic transition, \r\nso, I hope, will it play a role in the even more difficult \r\ntask of making sure our democracy becomes a \r\npermanent feature rather than a passing illusion. All of \r\nus who care about the Maldives and believe in \r\ndemocracy bear an enormous responsibility to ensure \r\nthat the beliefs we fought for are set in stone rather \r\nthan written in sand. \r\n There are three areas in which the Maldives seeks \r\nthe help of the international community. The first is \r\ncontinued collaboration in democracy-building. We \r\nmust work together to strengthen the various pillars of \r\na democratic society, namely protection of human \r\nrights, good governance, independent oversight bodies, \r\na free press and civil society. The Maldives has made \r\nenormous progress on all of those pillars, but much \r\nremains to be done. My sense is that the necessary \r\nfoundations are now in place. The separation of powers \r\nA/64/PV.6  \r\n \r\n09-52425 34 \r\n \r\nhas been established by constitutional reform. A range \r\nof independent agencies and commissions have now \r\nbeen set up. We have a thriving independent media. \r\nNevertheless, several crucial challenges still remain, \r\nand we look forward to the support of the international \r\ncommunity as we move to meet these challenges. In \r\nparticular, I would like to stress the importance of \r\nensuring the equality of women and men, not just in \r\nname, but in practice. \r\n The second way in which the international \r\ncommunity can help consolidate democracy and the \r\nrule of law in the Maldives is by promoting a \r\nconducive economic environment. As a small, open \r\nmarket economy that is heavily dependent on tourism \r\nand fishery exports, the Maldives has suffered badly \r\nfrom the current global recession. Moreover, since \r\nassuming office, we have come to understand that, in \r\nthe run-up to last year’s election, the former regime \r\nengaged in highly irresponsible economic policies in \r\nthe hope of buying their way to victory. Add to this \r\npicture our continued efforts to recovery from the 2004 \r\ntsunami, our impending graduation from the least \r\ndeveloped country category and the high oil and food \r\nprices of recent years, and the scale of the economic \r\nchallenge facing the new Government becomes very \r\napparent. \r\n The new Government is determined to confront \r\nthis challenge with honesty and with vigour. In \r\nconsultation with the International Monetary Fund \r\n(IMF) and the World Bank, we have embarked on a \r\nprogramme of major economic reform designed to \r\nreduce the bloated public sector, privatize public \r\nutilities and promote private enterprise and trade. Yet \r\nthe scale of the problems we face means we cannot \r\nsucceed on our own. We therefore look to our friends \r\nin the international community to help us get back on \r\nour feet. We are very grateful for the support extended \r\nto us by the IMF and the Indian Government, to name \r\nbut two of our partners. However, more is needed if \r\ndemocracy and human rights are to coexist with \r\neconomic stability and prosperity. \r\n The third way in which the international \r\ncommunity can and must help the Maldives consolidate \r\ndemocracy and establish a secure, prosperous and \r\nequitable society is by taking urgent and effective \r\naction to tackle climate change. The threats posed to \r\nthe Maldives from climate change are well known. \r\nEvery beach lost to rising seas, every house lost to \r\nstorm surges, every reef lost to increasingly warm \r\nwaters, every job lost as fish stocks dwindle and every \r\nlife lost to more frequent extreme weather events will \r\nmake it harder and harder to govern the country, until a \r\npoint is reached when we must consider abandoning \r\nour homeland. \r\n I therefore call on you, the leaders of the world, \r\nto protect the future of frontline countries like the \r\nMaldives by reaching an ambitious and effective \r\nagreement at December’s United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) conference \r\nin Copenhagen which seeks to limit average global \r\ntemperature increases to less than 1.5 centigrade \r\ndegrees above pre-industrial levels. To do otherwise \r\nwould be to sign a death warrant for the \r\n300,000 Maldivians.  \r\n But the Maldives is determined to do what we \r\ncan to survive. We are going to be the first country to \r\ngo carbon neutral, in 10 years’ time. In order to do that, \r\nwe are determined to formulate a survival kit: a \r\ncarbon-neutral manual that would enable others to \r\nreplicate our actions, in order that all of us together \r\nmight just about save ourselves from climate \r\ncatastrophe. \r\n As part of our efforts to achieve a unified voice, I \r\nwill be inviting some of the most vulnerable States \r\naffected by climate change to the Maldives. We hope \r\nthat that November summit will reinforce our \r\ndetermination to leave no stone unturned to ensure our \r\nsurvival.  \r\n I should now like to touch on a number of other \r\nimportant issues which are of enormous concern to us. \r\nThe Maldives abhors terrorism in all its forms and is \r\ndetermined to stand shoulder to shoulder with all \r\ncountries in facing down this menace. Events over the \r\npast year in Afghanistan, Pakistan and India, our \r\nneighbours and partners in South Asia, show us that \r\nvictory in this fight will not be easy to achieve. They \r\nalso show us that to effectively tackle terrorism we \r\nmust reaffirm and not dilute our commitments to \r\nhuman rights, democracy, the rule of law and good \r\ngovernance. \r\n While we applaud recent efforts to reform and \r\nrevitalize the United Nations, we believe that such \r\nreforms cannot be successful or complete without the \r\nmuch-anticipated and much-needed reform of the \r\nSecurity Council. We strongly believe that the third \r\nround of intergovernmental negotiations on Security \r\nCouncil reform must produce tangible results. I call \r\n A/64/PV.6\r\n \r\n35 09-52425 \r\n \r\nupon the Assembly to complete this task during the \r\nsixty-fourth session and come to agreement on \r\nincreases in both the permanent and non-permanent \r\nmembership of the Council. In terms of composition, \r\nwe believe that the geo-political realities of the \r\ncontemporary world must be duly reflected in the \r\nmembership of the Council. Therefore, we support the \r\ninclusion of India and Japan as permanent members. \r\n The new Government of Maldives is determined \r\nto pursue friendly and mutually respectful relations \r\nwith every country represented in this Hall. However, \r\nany friendship must include a willingness to be frank \r\nwith one another and to object to behaviour not \r\nbefitting a sovereign State. \r\n We believe dialogue and constructive engagement \r\nserve the cause of peace better than ostracism and \r\nisolation. The new Government in Maldives will look \r\nto renew relations with Israel and to use the \r\nrelationship to reiterate our support for an independent \r\nand sovereign Palestinian homeland, in conformity \r\nwith the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. \r\n Maldives is seeking election to the Human Rights \r\nCouncil during the current session of the General \r\nAssembly because we firmly believe in the universality \r\nof human rights and their critical importance to \r\nachieving the noble goals of the United Nations \r\nCharter. \r\n Standing at this rostrum, I must admit how, as a \r\nprisoner, I was inspired by the courage and vision of \r\nAung San Suu Kyi of Burma. Today I would like to \r\necho the call of the Secretary-General for her \r\nimmediate and unconditional release along with all \r\nother political prisoners. I also reiterate my strident \r\nsupport for the work assigned to Mr. Ibrahim Gambari, \r\nthe United Nations Special Envoy to Burma, and say a \r\nprayer for political prisoners everywhere. \r\n In conclusion, I must say that the most critical \r\ntest so far of the resoluteness of the international \r\ncommunity to save itself will come during Mr. Treki’s \r\nwatch as President of this Assembly: the Copenhagen \r\nmeeting in December. We must prime ourselves to \r\nsucceed at that conference. Between now and then, we \r\nmust all use every opportunity, every debate, and every \r\nencounter to achieve that goal. It is imperative that we \r\nsucceed. If we want to save the world, I suggest that \r\nsaving Maldives is a very good starting point. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Maldives for the statement \r\nhe has just made. \r\n Mr. Mohamed Nasheed, President of the Republic \r\nof Maldives, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Álvaro Colom Caballeros, President \r\nof the Republic of Guatemala \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Guatemala. \r\n Mr. Álvaro Colom Caballeros, President of the \r\nRepublic of Guatemala, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency  \r\nMr. Álvaro Colom Caballeros, President of the \r\nRepublic of Guatemala, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly. \r\n President Colom Caballeros (spoke in Spanish): \r\nAt the outset, I would like to salute Mr. Ali Treki, our \r\nPresident and a distinguished diplomat. I wish him \r\nmuch success in leading the deliberations of this \r\nsession. At the same time, I would like to express our \r\nadmiration and respect for Father Miguel d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann, who led the Assembly at its last session. \r\n My presence highlights our commitment to \r\nmultilateralism in general and to the United Nations in \r\nparticular. I salute Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and \r\nreiterate to him our appreciation for his management. \r\nAllow me to say how the Guatemalan people \r\nappreciate and value the presence of the United \r\nNations. We try to reciprocate, in part with our \r\nparticipation in various peacekeeping operations. \r\n I would like to touch briefly on some topics that \r\nare at the heart of our concerns but that at the same \r\ntime have an important international dimension. \r\n First, like the other countries of our region, \r\nGuatemala has been strongly impacted by the \r\ninternational economic and financial crisis. This fact is \r\nreflected in the value and volume of our exports, in the \r\nlevel of family remittances and especially in the level \r\nof economic activity, employment and tax collection. \r\nA/64/PV.6  \r\n \r\n09-52425 36 \r\n \r\nIn more general terms, the crisis has made it more \r\ndifficult for us to meet the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. \r\n To make matters worse, our efforts to mitigate the \r\nimpact of the crisis have been partially annulled by an \r\nirregular climatic event, as we are suffering the worst \r\ndrought in the last thirty years. This phenomenon has \r\naffected the harvest of basic grains and has had a \r\nserious impact on the poorest regions of our country. \r\nBecause of this, I decided to declare a state of \r\nemergency. The disaster is not just because of the \r\ndrought, but also an historic disaster, striking the \r\npoorest people in our country, whom our Government \r\nis aiming to lift from extreme poverty. \r\n This situation illustrates one of the manifold \r\nmanifestations of climate change occurring in diverse \r\nregions, and it comes on top of the burden of the \r\nregressive effects we experienced during the first half \r\nof 2008, in the double crises of energy and food, \r\nfollowed by the aforementioned effects of the \r\neconomic crisis. Unfortunately, the adverse effects of \r\nthis situation disproportionately affect those sectors of \r\nthe population with less capacity and less income. The \r\npicture is complicated by the fact that the imperative of \r\nthe State to address the people’s needs is severely \r\nrestricted by fiscal considerations. \r\n Nevertheless, we are not sitting on our hands, far \r\nfrom it. We have surged forward with a dynamic and \r\nstrong social cohesion programme. Today, more than \r\nhalf a million families are covered by programmes in \r\nthe poorest and most excluded regions of the country. \r\nToday, I note with real satisfaction that in only \r\n18 months since our Administration began, our health \r\nindicators — all of the health indicators — have \r\nimproved to an extraordinary extent. \r\n Education indicators have improved. For \r\nexample, this year enrolment increased by 37 per cent \r\nin secondary education, by 9 per cent in primary \r\neducation and by 27 per cent in preschool. Now we \r\nhave the problem of schools that cannot cope with the \r\nnumber of children, but we prefer that problem to not \r\nhaving children in school. This means that there is an \r\nurgent need to build more than 14,400 classrooms over \r\nthe next 14 months, but we prefer that to having \r\nchildren on the streets or working. \r\n The international cooperation that we have \r\nreceived in this effort is important, and we would like \r\nto recognize here the support of the Inter-American \r\nDevelopment Bank, the World Bank and the Central \r\nAmerican Bank for Economic Integration, which have \r\nhelped us with our efforts to build social cohesion and \r\nto support the indigenous people who constitute our \r\npopulation. \r\n I wish to sincerely express our total conviction \r\nwith regard to the change that we all must make. It is a \r\nchange of attitude, a change of will, as President Lula \r\nsaid yesterday. It is important that we see the birth of \r\nthis new international order, this new order of justice \r\nand equity.  \r\n The drought in Guatemala exacerbated abject \r\npoverty, but a solution to drought will not resolve the \r\npoverty situation in the country, because it is structural \r\nand historical, resulting from 50 years of neglect of \r\nrural populations and our indigenous peoples.  \r\n We will follow with interest the deliberations of \r\nthe Group of 20, which is meeting this very day in \r\nPittsburgh. We trust that that exclusive forum will also \r\ntake into account the concerns of countries with small \r\nand medium-sized economies. In addition, we support \r\nthe efforts being promoted within the multilateral \r\ninternational financial institutions and the United \r\nNations to improve their capacity to help developing \r\ncountries and to address the crisis. That is why our \r\ncountry is seriously promoting the capitalization of the \r\nInter-American Development Bank and our regional \r\nfinancial organization, the Central American Bank for \r\nEconomic Integration.  \r\n I should like to mention the lack of security in \r\nour country. Our country is being assaulted by \r\norganized crime, and our Government, within the space \r\nof a year and a half, has begun a merciless war against \r\nit. In this forum, I wish to express my appreciation for \r\nthe magnificent cooperation and support that we have \r\nreceived, particularly from Colombia, Panama and \r\nMexico, to attack and staunch the scourge of drug \r\ntrafficking and to begin a process of eliminating it.  \r\n I also wish to inform the Assembly with great \r\nsatisfaction that, in terms of seizures of cocaine alone, \r\nwe have seen a 700 per cent increase compared with \r\nthe same period under the previous Government; \r\nseizures of marijuana have risen fifteenfold, and poppy \r\neradication has increased by 300 per cent during the \r\nsame period. Our efforts against drug trafficking are \r\ndefinitive and resolute, but we recognize that it is a \r\nphenomenon that must be attacked at the regional \r\nlevel. That is why we are working closely with the \r\n A/64/PV.6\r\n \r\n37 09-52425 \r\n \r\nfraternal country of Mexico and our Central American \r\nbrothers to address it directly and regionally. \r\n The problem of drug trafficking has had a serious \r\nimpact on Guatemala. For more than eight years, the \r\ncountry was handed over to organized crime — \r\nspecifically, drug trafficking — leaving territories and \r\ntrafficking corridors more unprotected than ever \r\nbefore. The national army was reduced beyond the \r\nlevel mandated by peace agreements, and territorial \r\ncontrol was suspended. The National Civilian Police \r\nwere seriously compromised by drug traffickers, \r\nbecoming corrupt and dishonest.  \r\n However, thanks to the United Nations and the \r\npresence of the International Commission against \r\nImpunity in Guatemala — a United Nations exercise in \r\nGuatemala, unique in the world — we have support \r\nand advice for our Public Ministry, and our prosecutors \r\nand are making significant progress. For the first time \r\nin Guatemala’s history, one of the drug-trafficking \r\nbosses is a fugitive, and we will capture him very soon. \r\nThe notorious drug-trafficking families have never \r\nbeen sent such a strong message.  \r\n We have also imprisoned 10 murder suspects \r\nconnected to the 10 May crisis. I take this opportunity \r\nto thank this forum, the United Nations, for the \r\nunrestricted support provided to my Government \r\nduring the crisis. I am confident that the efforts of the \r\nInternational Commission against Impunity in \r\nGuatemala will reach the masterminds of that \r\ndespicable crime and that the truth will be found and \r\njustice done. What could have become a technical coup \r\nd’état has become a genuine example of justice and \r\ntruth. I am sure that my Government, which has \r\nensured the total independence of this investigation, \r\nwill get to the heart of the matter and that the truth will \r\nsoon be found. \r\n We have worked hard on the security of our \r\ncitizens, and I recognize that it is a long and \r\ncomplicated process. Here again, the assistance of the \r\nInternational Commission is essential, and we believe \r\nthat this experience will be effectively used by our \r\nPublic Ministry, which has already begun the process \r\nof re-engineering and restructuring itself.  \r\n I should like to mention the case of Honduras, \r\nour fraternal neighbouring country. From the very \r\nbeginning, Guatemala has supported a return to \r\ndemocracy and the rule of law in Honduras. Nowhere \r\nin the world, much less in Central America — where \r\ndemocracy has cost us so many lives and where so \r\nmany deaths and, in the case of Guatemala, massacres, \r\nhave affected us — can we allow a President to be \r\ndeposed at gunpoint and fail to use democratic and \r\nlegal mechanisms. We will accept nothing less than the \r\nreturn of President Zelaya to power so that the \r\nelections in Honduras can be carried out legitimately \r\nand our Honduran brothers can soon live in peace and \r\ntranquillity. Our Government has been unsparing in its \r\nsupport for President Zelaya, and I am sure that we will \r\nsee Central America return to its natural rhythm of \r\nintegration, democratic development and democratic \r\nsecurity. \r\n I should also like to highlight our adherence to \r\nnearly all human rights mechanisms, principles and \r\nnorms within and outside Guatemala. We are a \r\nmulti-ethnic, pluri-cultural and multilingual nation. We \r\nhave a beautiful 108,000-square-kilometre country \r\nwith 23 cultures and 23 peoples sharing the blessed \r\nland that God gave us. That is why we are committed \r\nto promoting the strengthening of the participation of \r\nall the indigenous peoples of Guatemala in terms of our \r\ndaily life, development, peace and security. \r\n We have adopted a law on free access to \r\ninformation, with very few problems, which has \r\nguaranteed free access to all State information except \r\nthat related to security matters and foreign relations. \r\nThat is why we wish to stress the need to strengthen \r\nthe mechanisms for human rights and arms control. I \r\nbelieve that countries have the freedom to arm \r\nthemselves for defence, but I do not agree that our \r\ncountries should be arms-trafficking corridors. I also \r\nbelieve that countries exporting armaments should be \r\nmore careful and have more controls and standards \r\nwith regard to the entire weapons trade. Our country, \r\nmy Government, has increased its seizures of illegal \r\nweapons almost tenfold, but we still have much work \r\nahead of us. Meanwhile, many innocent people are \r\ndying as a result of drug trafficking, smuggling and \r\norganized crime.  \r\n Let us make progress in the definition of the \r\nconcept of the responsibility to protect our respective \r\npopulations from genocide and war crimes, which we \r\nhave already endured; ethnic cleansing and crimes \r\nagainst humanity, from which Guatemala suffered \r\ngreatly for 36 years.  \r\n I wish to express my total conviction that the \r\nUnited Nations must be constantly renewed and \r\nA/64/PV.6  \r\n \r\n09-52425 38 \r\n \r\nadapted to today’s needs. Our civilization is changing. \r\nThis is a crisis not just of energy or finance or climate; \r\nit is a crisis of values, of principles. The financial crisis \r\nis a crisis of values and principles, and we are paying \r\nfor it with the poverty of our people. That is why we \r\nneed better adaptation of the United Nations \r\nmechanisms so we can really get to the bottom — al \r\ngrano, as we say in Guatemala — of the problems of \r\npoverty and inequality, to strengthen democracy and \r\nthe rule of law. \r\n I have the honour to be familiar with the Mayan \r\ncosmic vision, and I am quite sure that in 2012, the \r\ntransformation of civilization it prophesied will begin. \r\nThis is a very ancient prophecy and it will be fulfilled, \r\njust as all the others have been. We will enter an era of \r\ngreat humanity and great human strength. And America \r\nis also changing. If you look at the Americas today, \r\nthey have nothing to do with the way they were \r\n10 years ago. Democracy, although it has problems, \r\nhas improved and been strengthened, thank heaven. \r\n We support United Nations and Organization of \r\nAmerican States (OAS) resolutions with regard to \r\nHonduras, and I am also happy to affirm that we have \r\nmade very concrete progress in honourably ending our \r\nhistorical dispute with our brother nation of Belize. In \r\nDecember, under the good offices of the OAS, both \r\nGovernments signed a special agreement, which, prior \r\nto complying with the domestic ratification processes \r\nof our Congresses, commits us to seek a juridical \r\nsettlement through the International Court of Justice. \r\nWe hope that, through these internal procedures, we \r\nwill be able to proceed to plebiscites in both countries, \r\nin order to put an end to the dispute with our brother \r\ncountry of Belize. \r\n I would like to conclude with some very brief \r\nreflections on our Organization and its agenda for the \r\nfuture. I would like it to continue to give priority to the \r\npoor, those with limited incomes, children, young \r\npeople living in the mountains of our countries who do \r\nnot have access to health care, education or drinking \r\nwater. The drought and the malnutrition we are seeing \r\namong our children in Guatemala are nothing more \r\nthan the product of historical injustice. If all of us in \r\nthe United Nations share in this fight to help those who \r\nhave so little, I am sure that we will have more for \r\neveryone. The more we support those who have less, \r\nthe more we will all have in the end. I hope that this \r\nAssembly session reaches a fruitful conclusion. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Guatemala for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Álvaro Colom Caballeros, President of the \r\nRepublic of Guatemala, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. René Préval, President of the \r\nRepublic of Haiti \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Haiti. \r\n Mr. René Préval, President of the Republic of \r\nHaiti, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. René Préval, President of the Republic of Haiti, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Préval (spoke in French): Allow me at \r\nthe outset to convey my congratulations to the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly and to wish him \r\nvery fruitful work. \r\n Can you imagine a General Assembly where the \r\nrepresentatives of States and Governments who follow \r\none another on this rostrum would bring us only good \r\nnews, inform us that our world is doing better and that \r\nmost development indicators are at their best level \r\never? We are very far indeed from such an ideal. \r\n It would even seem that, in addition to numerous \r\ncrises of all kinds — food, energy, financial and so \r\nforth — that are already exacting a very high toll on \r\nour populations, some of us must now get used to \r\nrecurrent upheavals resulting from natural disasters. \r\nEach time, we have to rebuild the same ruined \r\ninfrastructure; we have to restore the same productive \r\ncapacities that have been swept away by cyclones and \r\nfloods. And, for lack of sufficient resources, the \r\nreconstruction process is never launched in time. We \r\nfind we are having to prepare for the return of these \r\ndisasters even before our communities have recovered \r\nfrom the previous ones. This, evidently, is the new life \r\ncycle that vulnerable countries such as ours must be \r\nprepared for. With, of course, insufficient resources at \r\ntheir disposal. \r\n A/64/PV.6\r\n \r\n39 09-52425 \r\n \r\n This situation is no accident. It is the direct \r\nconsequence of a development and governance model \r\nthat nations recognized as powerful have imposed on \r\nthe rest of the world for centuries: a development and \r\ngovernance model that is largely concerned with the \r\nwelfare of money and too little with the welfare of \r\npeople; a development model that, even in very rich \r\ncountries, imposes a precarious existence on major \r\nsections of the population, which lack health care, \r\ndecent housing and even a good education. \r\n Why should the whole of humankind accept that \r\nhalf the inhabitants of our planet should live with these \r\nprivations, in hunger and misery, with no prospect of \r\nimprovement in their situation? Why should the whole \r\nof humankind accept that our planet should be \r\nendangered irresponsibly, that species should be \r\ncondemned to extinction or that, through climate \r\nchange, our populations should become more \r\nvulnerable to natural disasters merely because of \r\nselfish economic choices by a small minority of \r\npolluters? \r\n What substance can we give to our membership \r\nin this human community that the United Nations seeks \r\nto champion? To paraphrase George Orwell, beyond a \r\ncertain level of inequality, there is no common world \r\nanymore. The glaring inequalities that characterize our \r\ncountries’ situations are an obstacle to the formation of \r\nthe great family that the United Nations should be. \r\n The time has come to oppose the globalization of \r\nprofit at any price, which has become the new credo, \r\nand to replace it with the globalization of solidarity, \r\nwhich alone will ensure the eradication of poverty, as \r\nrequired by this Assembly.  \r\n Here, I should reiterate to members that the true \r\nvehicle for peace, stability and security is development. \r\nThe aid received by our countries will be ineffective \r\nand a source of great frustration for donors and \r\nbeneficiaries unless it is part of a plan to create and \r\ndevelop the productive potential of our countries. That \r\nis the only way to put an end to the cycle of poverty \r\nand dependence. \r\n Haitians, like many other peoples of the South, \r\nare a hardworking, clever and entrepreneurial people \r\nequipped with great resilience forged by dealing with \r\ndaily setbacks and able to utilize to the extreme and \r\noptimize the scant resources made available to them. \r\nOur peoples yearn to mobilize that potential and that \r\ncapacity to take the path of sustainable development.  \r\n Developing our countries is thus a possible \r\nendeavour. However, all the efforts under way could \r\nremain ineffective unless we are able to develop a new \r\nparadigm for international cooperation — a paradigm \r\nrequiring that we transcend the logic of human \r\nassistance and recognize the capacity of poor peoples \r\nto engage in business and produce wealth, using the \r\nmeans and opportunities afforded them to strengthen \r\ntheir productive capacity. Without such a new vision, \r\nwhich breaks with the culture of perpetual \r\nhumanitarian assistance, peace and stability will \r\nremain precarious and fleeting achievements.  \r\n Permit me to add a few words about Haiti, \r\nbecause my country is the focus of particular attention \r\nby the Security Council. Over the past three years, \r\ndespite the negative effects of numerous international \r\ncrises on our economy, significant progress has been \r\nmade, in particular in the areas of security, respect for \r\nhuman rights, the investment climate, eliminating \r\ncorruption and building a friendly society in which \r\ndialogue occupies a central place, supported and \r\nreported on by totally free and independent media. \r\nThat progress must be deepened and expanded. That is \r\nwhy United Nations support is necessary for us.  \r\n In his report to the Security Council, the \r\nSecretary-General recommended that the mandate of \r\nthe United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti \r\n(MINUSTAH) be extended for another year. That \r\nproposal is most welcome, and we fully endorse it. We \r\nare convinced that the right balance among its military, \r\npolice and administrative components will best place \r\nMINUSTAH to assist our country more effectively in \r\nconsolidating an atmosphere of peace and stability, \r\nwithout making it indifferent to our struggle to rebuild \r\nand to reduce poverty and vulnerability. I thank the \r\nSecretary-General for having chosen Bill Clinton as his \r\nSpecial Envoy to our country. I also thank the former \r\nPresident, a friend of Haiti, for having agreed to help \r\nus.  \r\n Many summits organized under United Nations \r\nauspices produce resolutions and commitments that are \r\nconsigned to oblivion or indifference when the time \r\ncomes to implement them. It is our shared \r\nresponsibility to work to ensure that this general debate \r\nis not pure ritual in which, from this lofty rostrum, we \r\nuse rhetoric to share our ideas about major \r\ninternational issues, express our good intentions, make \r\ntempting promises and leave again without any real \r\nA/64/PV.6  \r\n \r\n09-52425 40 \r\n \r\ndesire to take appropriate measures to keep our \r\ncommitments.  \r\n For example, will we accept the fact that the \r\nPresident of Honduras, José Manuel Zelaya, \r\nlegitimately elected by his people, has been deposed by \r\nthe military and that the many resolutions adopted by \r\nvarious regional organizations condemning that coup \r\nd’état remain dead letters? Similarly, every year for \r\nmore than 15 years now, the General Assembly has \r\nadopted a resolution condemning the embargo against \r\nthe Cuban people. The continuation of that embargo \r\nruns counter to all the values that we promote to make \r\ninternational trade a tool for human development. \r\nWhen will rhetoric be replaced by action? \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Haiti for the statement he \r\nhas just made. \r\n Mr. René Préval, President of the Republic of \r\nHaiti, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.  \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Abdoulaye Wade, President of the \r\nRepublic of Senegal \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Senegal. \r\n Mr. Abdoulaye Wade, President of the Republic of \r\nSenegal, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.  \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Abdoulaye Wade, President of the Republic of \r\nSenegal, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Wade (spoke in French): We are \r\nmeeting once again, but this time at a moment when \r\nhumankind is facing many problems, each as difficult \r\nas the others, as if they had been planned to coincide: \r\nthe agriculture crisis, the financial and economic crisis, \r\nenvironmental peril and tenacious, deadly diseases. Be \r\nthat as it may, we are destined to prevail. There is \r\nsimply no other option. We must and we can succeed. \r\nThe numerous deliberations about these problems at all \r\nlevels illustrate our increasing awareness of the \r\ndangers to us and succeeding generations. \r\n Believing fundamentally as I do in the genius of \r\nhumankind and its capacity for imagination and \r\ncreativity in extricating itself from the most difficult \r\nsituations, I am both optimistic and aware of the price \r\nthat will have to be paid. This is what we are called on \r\nto do here and elsewhere. The only question is how to \r\ncoordinate the numerous elements required to expedite \r\nthe rescue mission. \r\n Before going any further, however, I should like \r\nwarmly to congratulate Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, who \r\nhas been charged with guiding the work of this sixty-\r\nfourth session of the General Assembly. I have known \r\nMr. Treki for a long time, and Senegal is delighted by \r\nhis election and expresses its confidence in his human \r\nand professional qualities, which will bolster the \r\nsuccess of his mission.  \r\n I also pay tribute to Mr. Miguel d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann, President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-third session, for his contributions to the effort to \r\nrevitalize the Assembly. His commitment and \r\ndynamism are well known. I have admired his \r\nintelligence, his lively wit and the sensitivity he shows \r\nin his relations with others. To Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon, Senegal reiterates its support for his delicate \r\ntask in the face of the many and urgent issues facing \r\nthe Organization. \r\n This sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly \r\nhas begun at a time of multifaceted turmoil. The \r\neconomic and financial crisis, the scale of which has \r\nsurprised many observers, reveals above all the \r\ndeadlock in contemporary economic theory. In \r\nhighlighting the inadequacy of our analytical and \r\npredictive abilities, it calls for a broader sense of \r\nshared responsibility both for the management of its \r\nimmediate effects and for the search for long-term \r\nresponses. In seeking solutions, let us be careful not to \r\nmake the mistake of falling back on received wisdom \r\nand ready-made answers. Be it in the sphere of the \r\nenvironment, political and economic governance or \r\ndevelopment, the world must find a new way of \r\nthinking and acting, and thereby address the need to \r\nchange our outlook. \r\n Having myself argued, often strongly, for the full \r\nparticipation of Africa in the conversation on world \r\ngovernance, I welcome the progressively expanded \r\ncooperative framework of the Group of Eight (G-8) \r\nand the Group of 20 (G-20). I only regret that my \r\nproposal to establish a shadow G-20, made up of the \r\n A/64/PV.6\r\n \r\n41 09-52425 \r\n \r\nworld’s greatest experts but open to all those who bring \r\nnew ideas, has not yet been put into practice. \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n Clearly, the world’s heads of State, elected on the \r\nbasis of political criteria, cannot miraculously \r\ntransform themselves into universal polymaths. They \r\nmust hold to their political and even strategic role, and \r\nrely on the superior knowledge of experts. It is through \r\ndialogue open to all that we will be able to grasp the \r\ndiversity of our respective situations and apply real-\r\nworld answers to real-world problems. It is therefore \r\nfitting that the theme of this sixty-fourth session should \r\nbe “Effective responses to global crises: strengthening \r\nmultilateralism and dialogue among civilizations for \r\ninternational peace, security and development”. \r\n The current challenges, both complex and global \r\nin nature, call strongly for innovative and concerted \r\nsolutions if we are to succeed. That is especially true \r\nfor problems of agriculture and food security. If we are \r\nto achieve on schedule Millennium Development Goal 1, \r\nto halve by 2015 the number of people suffering from \r\nhunger, we must put into practice a different approach \r\nto international cooperation, one based on support for \r\nagriculture instead of food assistance, which should be \r\nused only as an emergency response to exceptional \r\ncircumstances.  \r\n The development of agriculture to promote \r\nsustainable food security in Africa necessarily involves \r\nwater management, the availability of equipment, \r\nproducers’ access to inputs and a sound organization of \r\nchains of production, storage, processing and sales of \r\nagricultural products. That is why Senegal hopes that \r\nthese essential questions — and others, such as the \r\nregulation of agricultural markets and scientific \r\nresearch to increase productivity — will take a \r\nprominent place on the agenda of the Summit of the \r\nWorld’s Regions on Food Security, to be held in \r\nJanuary 2010 in Dakar, and of the Global Partnership \r\nfor Agriculture and Food Security proposed by the G-8. \r\n Once the right conditions are in place, there is no \r\nreason why Africa should not be able to ensure its own \r\nfood security. Better yet, its enormous land and water \r\nresources predispose the continent to become the \r\nworld’s breadbasket. To that end, however, we must \r\navoid the vicious trap of ceding land to foreigners \r\nbearing millions of dollars. The G-8 quite rightly \r\nexpressed its concern on this subject at its most recent \r\nsummit in Italy. According to recent estimates, between \r\n15 and 20 million hectares have changed hands over \r\nthe past three years, primarily in Africa. We Africans \r\nshould make it our vocation to become farmers tilling \r\nour own land rather than being agricultural labourers \r\nworking for capital-rich foreign planters. \r\n For its part, Senegal, as I have often said, cannot \r\naccept such a course, which would without doubt \r\nempty our countryside of newly impoverished millions, \r\nwho would swell our slums and the ranks of those ripe \r\nfor illegal emigration. On the other hand, if we exploit \r\nour mutually complementary circumstances, we of the \r\nNorth and the South can promote a win-win \r\npartnership in which investors and local communities \r\njoin to develop African land without dispossession. \r\nSenegal has succeeded, in record time, in responding \r\npositively to the food crisis. For the second year in a \r\nrow, our home-grown agricultural campaign for food \r\nand abundance, known as GOANA, has rewarded us \r\nwith excellent results. \r\n We intend to strengthen this food self-sufficiency \r\noption with the unionization of rural producers, on the \r\nmodel of Québec. To this end, we are currently setting \r\nup a green bank for farmers, fishers and livestock \r\nfarmers, which will support financing of these sectors. \r\nThis is a bold innovation, a green revolution that we \r\nwant very much to see succeed. \r\n At the global level, I believe that, beyond its \r\nadverse impacts, the current crisis has a silver lining \r\ninsofar as it stimulates creativity, initiative and a \r\nfighting spirit. If the Secretary-General had not \r\nlaunched his emotional appeal at World Food Day in \r\nRome two years ago, I might not have felt a challenge \r\nso great as to demand the invention of GOANA. And \r\nbecause the fate of our people is at stake, it is our \r\nprimary responsibility to establish on our own the \r\nconditions necessary for a brighter future. \r\n Internal efforts will continue to be futile without \r\na healthy global environment rid of the speculative \r\npractices of the virtual economy and unjust asymmetric \r\nprogrammes, such as subsidies and other inequitable \r\npractices. In this context, non-oil-producing African \r\ncountries continue to feel the full brunt of the increase \r\nin oil prices resulting from speculative practices that \r\nwe cannot mitigate because they are controlled by the \r\noil oligarchy. Economies such as ours, which had \r\nhitherto posted average growth rates of 5 per cent, have \r\nbeen brutally weakened by imported inflation. \r\nA/64/PV.6  \r\n \r\n09-52425 42 \r\n \r\n For that reason, Senegal supports and encourages \r\nthe dialogue between producers and consumers \r\ninitiated by the International Energy Forum to improve \r\ntransparency in the oil market and take effective \r\nmeasures against speculative practices that devastate \r\nthe economies of importing States. \r\n In implementing the “Wade formula”, I proposed \r\na fund to fight poverty funded by voluntary \r\ncontributions from African oil-producing States and oil \r\ncompanies working in Africa, based on the principle of \r\nshared social responsibility. The fund could be \r\nmanaged collectively or entrusted to the World Bank. \r\nSimilarly, I welcome the extension of the Exogenous \r\nShocks Facility to countries benefiting from the Policy \r\nSupport Instrument. \r\n The summit meeting on climate change \r\nconfirmed a broadly shared conclusion. If we do not \r\nchange our methods of production and consumption, \r\nthe future of mankind itself will be in peril. We must \r\nadmit that we have not taken sufficient action to \r\nreverse these negative trends. Nature subjects us daily \r\nto the adverse consequences of our own attacks against \r\nit in different ways, including floods, droughts, \r\ndesertification and coastal erosion. These upheavals \r\nforeshadow even more devastating phenomena. \r\nInternational consensus is therefore urgently needed to \r\nsave the planet. In order to survive, each of us must \r\nstrive to behave more respectfully towards the \r\nenvironment and to create a world with fewer \r\ngreenhouse gas emissions. According to the hopeful \r\nstatement of the Secretary-General, we now find \r\nourselves on the threshold of a new era — that of the \r\ngreen economy. Let us have the courage to cross the \r\nthreshold for ourselves and for succeeding generations. \r\n Africa for its part wishes to assume its share of \r\nresponsibility in this necessary environmental rebirth. \r\nThat is the essence of the Great Green Wall project that \r\nruns from Dakar to Djibouti. Shared by all countries it \r\nruns through, the Great Green Wall is 7,000 kilometres \r\nlong and 15 kilometres wide, and Senegal has the \r\nresponsibility of coordinating it on behalf of the \r\nAfrican Union.  \r\n With the assistance of experts from all over the \r\nworld, we have selected plants adapted to the fairly \r\narid conditions prevailing in the Sahelian-Saharan \r\nzone. At the same time, we have decided to build \r\nwater-collection basins along the entire length of the \r\nGreat Green Wall, based on the model that we have \r\nimplemented in Senegal with some 250 basins. Every \r\nAfrican State involved in the construction of the Great \r\nGreen Wall organizes its implementation at the local \r\nlevel through a national agency. At the continental \r\nlevel, national agencies are coordinated by a pan-\r\nAfrican Great Green Wall agency under the auspices of \r\nthe African Union. \r\n I cherish the hope that the United Nations will \r\nbecome involved in this project, which contributes to \r\nprotecting the global environment, by mobilizing what \r\nmight be called anti-desert soldiers along the lines of \r\npeacekeeping troops. Here, I pay tribute to the \r\nparticipation of Ivorian boys and girls who, although \r\nnot directly impacted by desertification — Côte \r\nd’Ivoire being a country of forests — spontaneously \r\nparticipated in building the Senegalese section of the \r\nGreat Green Wall in Senegal. They worked voluntarily, \r\nside by side with their comrades from Senegal. These \r\nyoung people, transcending the artificial borders \r\ncreated by colonization, are using self-determination to \r\ntake ownership of the struggle for Africa’s future. This \r\nexperience could serve as a prelude to the creation of a \r\nbroad movement of “youth without borders” that unites \r\nyoung Africans from throughout the continent. They \r\ncould be the heralds of various causes, such as the fight \r\nagainst HIV/AIDS, early marriage and female \r\ncircumcision, as they in Senegal. \r\n While we await foreign assistance, Senegal has \r\nalready built nearly 527 kilometres of the Great Green \r\nWall. The project is also under way in Mali, and Chad \r\nwill follow in the near future. \r\n Through the progressive restoration of the \r\nSaharan ecosystem, the Great Green Wall will \r\ncontribute through greenhouse gas sequestration to the \r\nglobal fight against global warming. I thank the \r\nEuropean Union for its pledged support, and I welcome \r\nin particular President Sarkozy’s initiative to deploy to \r\nthis front — the only worthy front — soldiers to plant \r\ntrees and build water-collection basins. I cherish the \r\nhope that this initiative will serve to inspire other \r\nStates with the necessary human and material resources \r\nto support the Great Green Wall. \r\n Given the severity of the situation, the \r\nenvironmental threat, in my opinion, should be \r\nconsidered a threat to international peace and security. \r\nIf it were, we might consider allocating new \r\ninternational missions to national armies. In the \r\nmanner of peacekeeping operations, Senegal proposes \r\n A/64/PV.6\r\n \r\n43 09-52425 \r\n \r\nthe creation of a mechanism to save and restore the \r\nenvironment based on the voluntary commitment of \r\narmies through modalities to be determined. \r\n In the framework of civilian and military \r\nactivities, countries wishing to do so could mobilize \r\ncontingents for specific periods to assist in \r\nimplementing major environmental projects, such as \r\nthe Great Green Wall, or what is referred to in Senegal \r\nas the Atlantic wall against coastal erosion. \r\n In Senegal, we are currently creating along our \r\ncoastline a concrete wall 3 to 4 metres deep and \r\n40 centimetres wide built on an impermeable \r\nfoundation to stop the maritime erosion that threatens \r\nmany African countries. Its effectiveness is guaranteed. \r\nThe only problem is the cost — $1.5 million per \r\nkilometre. From Casablanca to Cotonou, representing \r\nsome 5,000 kilometres of vulnerable coastline, the \r\noverall cost would be $7.5 billion. Compared to \r\nexpenditures often seen at the global level, it certainly \r\nis not much. Moreover, if mankind were to stop \r\nbuilding lethal weapons for only three months and \r\nallocate the money thus saved to building the Atlantic \r\nwall, the threat to that part of Africa would be \r\npermanently removed.  \r\n For 16 years now, Security Council reform has \r\nbeen an important item on our agenda. It is a paradox \r\nthat an Organization, universal in its mission, should \r\nremain deadlocked 64 years after its creation by the \r\nelitist nature of its principal body. The leader \r\nAl-Qadhafi summarized our position on that issue (see \r\nA/64/PV.3). As Africa is the only continent not \r\nrepresented among the permanent members, despite the \r\nfact that it’s the focus of 70 per cent of the Council’s \r\nwork, that historic injustice must be corrected by \r\ngranting the continent here and now, outside the \r\ncontext of overall reform, one seat with the right of \r\nveto that could be held by the Chairman-in-Office of \r\nthe African Union. Let us ensure that this session is the \r\none at which we finally solve the issue of Security \r\nCouncil reform so that we can focus our efforts on \r\nother important issues.  \r\n Those important issues still unfortunately include \r\nthe tragic situation in the Middle East. While it \r\nrecognizes the Israeli people’s right to live in peace \r\nwithin secure and internationally recognized borders, \r\nSenegal resolutely supports the just and legitimate \r\nclaim of the Palestinian people to a viable, free and \r\nindependent State. That claim is morally consonant \r\nwith the right of peoples to self-determination.  \r\n However, in general, Senegal rejects violence in \r\nall its forms, whatever its origin. Israel’s pursuit of \r\nillegal activities on Palestinian territory is \r\ncounterproductive. The settlement, expropriation and \r\nlockdown of the territories are a serious obstacle to the \r\nnegotiations process and delay the prospects of an era \r\nof peace for all peoples of the subregion. Senegal \r\nsupports the vision of two States, Israeli and \r\nPalestinian, as recalled here yesterday by President \r\nBarack Obama (see A/64/PV.3). \r\n Turning to the situation in Africa, Senegal \r\nwelcomes the considerable progress made in the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes and in the integration \r\nprocess towards establishing the United States of \r\nAfrica. The accomplishment of African unity is the \r\nonly viable answer to the challenges of globalization, \r\nthe creation of large groupings and the redefinition of \r\nthe rules of governance. It is also an essential condition \r\nfor the establishment of lasting peace and stability on \r\nthe continent. \r\n Senegal continues to contribute to the settlement \r\nof disputes in Africa on the basis of that ideal of peace. \r\nI therefore welcome the normalization of the situation \r\nin our sister Republic of Mauritania following the \r\nDakar Accord of June 2009. We should remember that \r\nthe Accord was concluded with the support of the \r\nInternational Contact Group throughout the negotiation \r\nprocess. I reiterate my congratulations and my \r\nappreciation to all. \r\n In the sister Republic of Guinea-Bissau, I \r\nwelcome the gradual return to stability after the \r\npresidential elections, recognized and acknowledged \r\nby all as free and transparent. As a neighbour, Senegal \r\nreiterates its call for the convening of a donor \r\nconference in support of the courageous stabilization \r\nand development efforts of the people of Guinea-\r\nBissau, through their new authorities. \r\n On the other hand, the situation in the Republic \r\nof Guinea seems to me of greater concern. That \r\ncountry merits our full attention because it could fall \r\ninto violence at any time. Mrs. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, \r\nPresident of Liberia, and I, in our capacity as goodwill \r\nneighbours, were in Conakry only two weeks ago. I \r\nreported back to the African Union, stressing the need \r\nfor an ongoing presence in the field and for a dialogue \r\nwith all stakeholders, including the army. In my view, \r\nA/64/PV.6  \r\n \r\n09-52425 44 \r\n \r\nthat is the only way to help restore the constitutional \r\norder in Guinea. \r\n The ideal of peace, the primary raison d’être of \r\nour Organization, remains seriously threatened by \r\nextremism of all stripes, fuelled and perpetuated by \r\nignorance, mistrust and the manipulation of religion. \r\nThe need for dialogue between cultures and \r\ncivilizations is all the more urgent on that account. The \r\nchallenge today, in particular for the three revealed \r\nreligions that share the same God, is to build on that \r\ncommon monotheistic pedestal a bridge of brotherhood \r\nthat brings us closer and teaches us to live together \r\nagain by sharing our common values and with respect \r\nfor our differences. \r\n As Chairman-in-Office of the Organization of the \r\nIslamic Conference, I reiterate once again the \r\ndedication of the Islamic ummah to dialogue for the \r\nmutual understanding and peaceful coexistence of \r\npeoples because Islam, in letter and spirit, is a religion \r\nof the happy medium and of peace that teaches, in all \r\nthings, knowledge, moderation, reasonableness and \r\nrespect for the freedom of worship. \r\n Let us all agree to strive to learn to better \r\nunderstand each other, overcome mistrust and fight the \r\nobscurantist ideas that give rise to tensions and \r\nconfrontation. A world living in peace in the twenty-\r\nfirst century will be one in which all peoples enjoy an \r\nequally dignified existence. \r\n In that spirit, Senegal will host the Third World \r\nFestival of Negro Arts from 1 to 15 December 2010. \r\nThat artistic and intellectual event, with Brazil as guest \r\nof honour, will provide the opportunity for Africa and \r\nits diaspora to celebrate the values of culture and \r\ncivilization of the black world. For us, that is a way to \r\nfight the prejudices that still haunt some malicious \r\nminds and fuel the re-emergence of revisionist ideas. \r\n Africa is ready to meet the challenges of the \r\ntwenty-first century in a spirit of openness and \r\ndialogue with all peoples for a world of peace and \r\nhuman brotherhood. \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Republic of Senegal for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n Mr. Abdoulaye Wade, President of the Republic of \r\nSenegal, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\nAddress by Ms. Tarja Halonen, President of the \r\nRepublic of Finland \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Finland. \r\n Ms. Tarja Halonen, President of the Republic of \r\nFinland, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations Her Excellency Ms. Tarja Halonen, President \r\nof the Republic of Finland, and to invite her to address \r\nthe Assembly. \r\n President Halonen: Let me begin by \r\ncongratulating you, Sir, on your election as President \r\nof the General Assembly. I assure you of our full \r\nsupport in your important functions. \r\n As many colleagues have already underlined, the \r\ninternational climate negotiations are at a crucial stage. \r\nThe Copenhagen Conference is a real possibility for \r\nchange. We need political determination and solidarity \r\nto reach a new climate agreement that is global, \r\neffective and fair. The responsibility lies with all of \r\nus — industrial countries, emerging economies and \r\ndeveloping countries alike — to take the decisions that \r\nwill so profoundly shape the future of humankind. \r\n I thank the Secretary-General for convening the \r\nSummit on Climate Change at the beginning of the \r\ncurrent session of the General Assembly. We had a \r\ngood discussion on issues that still need to be \r\naddressed before December. The meeting delivered a \r\nclear message that we are committed to working hard \r\nto seal the deal. \r\n A global climate agreement is a precondition for \r\ncomprehensive sustainable development. The poorest \r\nare the most vulnerable when struggling with the \r\nadverse effects of climate change. The new agreement \r\nmust include elements of solidarity and international \r\nsupport in coping with the needs of adaptation. Climate \r\nchange will affect especially seriously the lives and \r\nlivelihoods of women, but women are also powerful \r\nactors in combating it. We need to ensure their full \r\nparticipation in the negotiations and in the \r\nimplementation of the new agreement. \r\n Gender, food production and climate change are \r\nall interlinked. We know that 70 per cent of the world’s \r\npoor are women and girls. We also know that the \r\n A/64/PV.6\r\n \r\n45 09-52425 \r\n \r\nmajority of agricultural labourers are women. If we \r\nreally want to combat climate change and avoid a \r\nglobal food crisis, we need to pay close attention to the \r\nrole of women, especially in least developed countries. \r\n While the negative consequences of climate \r\nchange are universal, their impact on small island \r\ndeveloping States and countries with low-lying coastal \r\nareas is particularly grave. Those countries are \r\nthreatened by the rise of sea levels and by extreme \r\nweather conditions. They need particular attention and \r\nassistance. \r\n In September 2000, we committed ourselves here \r\nto a new global partnership to reduce extreme poverty \r\nand to reach the Millennium Development Goals. We \r\nreiterated that pledge at the 2005 World Summit. Now, \r\nin 2009, we have to demonstrate our resolve to live up \r\nto that commitment when faced with a contracting \r\nworld economy as well.  \r\n The solution of the current financial and \r\neconomic crisis should be based on the concept of fair \r\nglobalization. Our action, while striving to achieve \r\nsustainable economic growth, must address the goal of \r\ndecent work for all. It is really essential that we honour \r\nour commitments to development in spite of our budget \r\nconstraints. \r\n In the world economy, the tectonic plates are in \r\nmotion and new actors are emerging. We need to \r\ndevelop a new global consensus on business ethics, \r\nintegrity and sustainable economic growth. We must \r\nwork together so that trust in international financial \r\ninstitutions can be re-established. Let us make them \r\nmore transparent, accountable and sustainable. \r\n I sincerely hope that the Pittsburgh summit of the \r\nGroup of 20 will agree on further measures for global \r\nrecovery. But we should also make full use of the \r\nUnited Nations to promote inclusive and equitable \r\ncooperation on issues that are truly global. \r\n While climate change and the global economic \r\ndownturn cause problems in many parts of the world, \r\nAfrica is the continent that suffers the most. The \r\ninternational community must remain attentive to \r\nAfrica’s needs. I am glad to note that positive \r\ndevelopments have also taken place in Africa. During \r\nthis decade, the number of conflicts in Africa has \r\ndecreased. The African Union is committed to \r\nstrengthening the organization’s capacity in conflict \r\nprevention. Finland is contributing to that important \r\neffort by supporting the build-up of the peace \r\nmediation structures of the African Union. \r\n The latest developments in the Middle East peace \r\nprocess provide a reason for cautious optimism. It \r\nseems that the parties are willing to take some steps. \r\nCountries outside the region are committed to \r\nsupporting those efforts. It is my belief that, with that \r\nbroadening consensus, we can reactivate the peace \r\nprocess soon. \r\n Finland values highly the United Nations Charter \r\nand the central role given to the Security Council. We \r\nactively participate in efforts to make that body more \r\nrepresentative and efficient. Finland is a candidate to \r\nbecome a non-permanent member of the Security \r\nCouncil for the period 2013 to 2014. At the same time, \r\nwe hope that progress on the Council’s reform can be \r\nmade during this session of the General Assembly. \r\n Security Council resolutions 1325 (2000) and \r\n1820 (2008) on women, peace and security were \r\nimportant achievements. Their implementation in all \r\ncountries and in all situations is urgently needed. The \r\ninternational colloquium on women’s empowerment, \r\nleadership development and international peace and \r\nsecurity, which was held last March in Monrovia, \r\nadopted a call to action on resolution 1325 (2000) and \r\na call for action on gender and climate change. As a \r\nfollow-up to the colloquium, Finland and Liberia \r\nconvened a side event today here at the United \r\nNations. In a word, it was a success. I hope that the \r\nnext success will be in Copenhagen, and that women \r\nwill make a contribution to it.  \r\n Security Council resolution 1820 (2008) strongly \r\ncondemns sexual violence in conflicts. We must treat \r\nsystematic rape as a forbidden weapon of war. Victims \r\nof rape and sexual abuse must have access to legal \r\nprocesses, and rapists must be prosecuted and \r\ncondemned. In our view, the appointment of a special \r\nrepresentative of the Secretary-General on women and \r\narmed conflict would enhance the implementation of \r\nthose resolutions. We hope that all Member States will \r\nsupport that proposal. I want to thank Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for bringing up the question of \r\nviolence against women in his opening address to the \r\nGeneral Assembly yesterday. \r\n Civilian populations need protection in conflict \r\nsituations. At the United Nations World Summit in \r\n2005, the responsibility to protect was accepted as a \r\ngeneral principle applicable to genocide, crimes against \r\nA/64/PV.6  \r\n \r\n09-52425 46 \r\n \r\nhumanity, ethnic cleansing and war crimes. Further \r\nefforts are urgently needed to save civilians from \r\nviolence. \r\n This morning, the Security Council held a debate \r\non nuclear security issues. I am sure that we are all \r\npleased that disarmament is now strongly returning to \r\nthe international agenda. I sincerely hope that that will \r\nlead to real progress. \r\n Finally, I would like to underline that we have to \r\ntry to find things that unite us — and not things that \r\ndivide us — if we want to be midwives of the future \r\nand not guardians of the past. Lasting peace can be \r\nbuilt only through open dialogue between cultural and \r\nreligious communities, in our countries and worldwide. \r\nFinland supports all initiatives, such as the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations, to stimulate intercultural communication. \r\nI wish those efforts the best of success in promoting \r\nmutual understanding and peace. I promise that Finland \r\nwill support them. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Finland for the statement she has just made.  \r\n Ms. Tarja Halonen, President of the Republic of \r\nFinland, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Rupiah Bwezani Banda, President of \r\nthe Republic of Zambia \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Zambia. \r\n Mr. Rupiah Bwezani Banda, President of the \r\nRepublic of Zambia, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome His \r\nExcellency Mr. Rupiah Bwezani Banda, President of \r\nthe Republic of Zambia, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly. \r\n President Banda: Let me join previous speakers \r\nin congratulating you, Sir, on your assumption of the \r\npresidency at the sixty-fourth session of the General \r\nAssembly. I should also like to extend Zambia’s \r\nsincere appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Miguel \r\nd’Escoto Brockmann for his able leadership during the \r\nsixty-third session. \r\n The theme for this session provides us with an \r\nopportunity to evaluate existing multilateral \r\napproaches to address the challenges arising from \r\nglobalization. Those include threats to socio-economic \r\ndevelopment and international peace and security. \r\nThere is a need to develop innovative approaches and \r\nresponses to those challenges, which include \r\nHIV/AIDS and influenza A(H1N1), terrorism, climate \r\nchange, nuclear weapons and, more recently, the global \r\neconomic and financial crisis. In this globalized and \r\ninterdependent world, no country, however wealthy or \r\npowerful it is, can resolve all those challenges single-\r\nhandedly. Common solutions are therefore required \r\nthrough a strong United Nations. \r\n This session is taking place against the backdrop \r\nof the adverse effects of the recent global economic \r\nand financial crisis, which has spared no one. In my \r\nown country of Zambia and in other African countries, \r\nthe economic growth achieved from 2000 to 2007 is \r\nnow declining as a result of the global economic and \r\nfinancial crisis. We are faced with serious financial \r\nconstraints, lower commodity prices and weak external \r\nand domestic demand for our products, high inflation \r\nand rising unemployment. Manufacturing and \r\nconstruction activities have also slackened. As copper \r\naccounts for about 70 per cent of Zambia’s exports, the \r\neffect of the collapse of international copper prices — \r\nfrom $8,985 per metric tonne in August 2008 to $2,902 \r\nat the end of 2008 — has, among other things, resulted \r\nin greatly reduced revenue collections. \r\n Zambia’s experience from the recent global \r\nfinancial and economic crisis is a timely reminder of \r\nthe consequences of overdependence on a single \r\neconomic sector. My Government has therefore \r\ndeveloped a diversification plan to shift the economy \r\nfrom dependence on copper. That is being done \r\nthrough policy interventions in the agriculture, tourism \r\nand manufacturing sectors, coupled with programmes \r\naimed at improving the business environment in \r\nZambia. \r\n For those efforts to succeed, however, there must \r\nbe an expeditious conclusion to the World Trade \r\nOrganization’s Doha Round of negotiations. Zambia \r\nconsiders the aid-for-trade component of the \r\nnegotiations as critical, as it will develop our country’s \r\ncapacity to overcome supply-side constraints and \r\nencourage value addition in its commodities. \r\n A/64/PV.6\r\n \r\n47 09-52425 \r\n \r\n Zambia’s response to the global economic crisis \r\nneeds the support of its international development \r\npartners. We appreciate that our cooperating partners \r\nhave also been affected by the global economic crisis. \r\nNonetheless, we urge them to fulfil their pledge to \r\nincrease their contributions to official development \r\nassistance to 0.71 per cent of gross national income. \r\nThat is necessary if the global development agenda is \r\nto help vulnerable economies, such as Zambia’s, meet \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. \r\n Zambia believes that there is a need to reform \r\ninternational financial governance systems in order to \r\navoid future global financial crises. The changes, \r\nwhich must be inclusive, should respond to the needs \r\nand concerns of all nations, regardless of status. It is \r\nessential that there be an increase in the voice and \r\npower of developing countries at the World Bank and \r\nthe International Monetary Fund. The reform process \r\nshould aim to improve the predictability of aid flows \r\nand emphasize reforms that promote faster aid delivery \r\nand fewer conditionalities. \r\n Zambia roundly applauds the leadership that the \r\nUnited Nations provides in tackling climate change, as \r\nwas illustrated only two days ago by the hosting of the \r\nhigh-level Summit on Climate Change. Our efforts to \r\nraise the standards of living for the world’s poor people \r\nin order to meet the Millennium Development Goals \r\nare being frustrated by the effects of climate change.  \r\n Scientists have spoken. We have seen with our \r\nown eyes, in just one generation, how great an effect \r\nclimate change has had on our environment. On the eve \r\nof the Climate Change Summit, just a few days ago, \r\nunprecedented floods hit the state of Georgia in this \r\ncountry, as if to rebuke any of us who still doubt the \r\nevidence. Let us just look around us. We do not need \r\nscience to tell us that deserts have expanded, that \r\nforests have drastically shrunk, that rivers have dried \r\nup and that it rains less and less in many places, and \r\nyet so much more in others. Nature has lost its balance \r\nand humankind has lost its footing. \r\n In our own short lifespan, in my own country, I \r\nremember a time when forests were within a child’s \r\nwalking distance, teeming with a profusion of animals, \r\nbirds, plants, insects and fruits. Today my \r\ngrandchildren would be lucky to name the indigenous \r\nfruits of our country on the fingers of one hand. So \r\nmany species of our countries’ flora and fauna have \r\nbecome extinct — forever lost to the world — in such \r\na short time.  \r\n Our children have spoken. Our citizens have \r\nspoken. If we go to Copenhagen to question the science \r\nyet again, or to make more speeches justifying \r\ninaction, if we still believe that we can only act after \r\nour competitors act, then we as leaders will have failed \r\nour peoples and consigned the world to utter \r\ndestruction. Copenhagen is the precipice, either we \r\nstep back and let live or tip over into the abyss. We \r\nmust act, and act now. \r\n With regard to mitigation, Zambia’s view is that \r\nthe shared vision should be based on shared \r\nresponsibilities for climate change; and that there must \r\nbe an equitable burden-sharing mechanism that requires \r\ndeveloped countries to commit to reducing emissions to \r\nlegally binding levels, while developing countries take \r\nactions to ensure a substantial reduction from \r\nenvironment-degrading development programmes. \r\n As the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference \r\ndraws near, Zambia expects an agreement that will \r\nbalance climate change concerns with development. \r\nThe Copenhagen agreement must provide increased \r\nand predictable support for the implementation of the \r\nadaptation programme, which must be established \r\nwithin a binding legal instrument under the United \r\nNations Framework Convention. \r\n Speaking in my capacity as the Chairman of the \r\nInternational Conference on Great Lakes Region, I am \r\nhappy to report to the Assembly that the Great Lakes \r\nregion of Africa is now more stable and peaceful than \r\nit has ever been in the past 15 years, albeit with \r\nchallenges. The improved relations between the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda, and \r\ntheir joint efforts to tackle the problem of negative \r\nforces in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo, has opened up opportunities for achieving \r\nsustainable peace and stability in the region. \r\n However, the region is still faced with the threat \r\nposed by the continued presence of illegal armed \r\ngroups and negative forces, namely, the Forces \r\ndémocratiques de libération du Rwanda (FDLR)/ \r\nex-Forces armées rwandaises/Interahamwe, the Lord’s \r\nResistance Army (LRA) and the Allied Democratic \r\nForces. Although the recent joint military operations \r\nbetween the Democratic Republic of the Congo and \r\nRwanda succeeded in dislodging FDLR elements from \r\nmost of their strongholds, the continued atrocities \r\nA/64/PV.6  \r\n \r\n09-52425 48 \r\n \r\ncommitted by the remnants of that group against \r\ncivilians remains a great source of concern. \r\n We applaud the role of the international \r\ncommunity through the United Nations Organization \r\nMission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in \r\nproviding support for the Government of that country \r\nin its efforts to build military capacity to neutralize the \r\nnegative forces in the eastern part of its territory. The \r\ninternational community needs to exert more sustained \r\npressure on the leadership of those negative forces \r\nliving within and outside the region, so that they are \r\nbrought to justice. \r\n The Lord’s Resistance Army, which fled to the \r\nnorth-eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo and the Central African Republic after the Juba \r\ntalks failed, continues to commit atrocities against the \r\ninnocent civilian population. The Great Lakes \r\nmechanisms allowed for a joint military operation \r\nagainst the LRA, which, challenges notwithstanding, \r\nachieved some progress in dislodging rebel forces. \r\n There is a need for sustained military and \r\ndiplomatic pressure to bring Joseph Kony back to the \r\nnegotiating table. There is also a need for more \r\nlogistical support from the international community to \r\nprotect the civilian population and, at the same time, \r\nput an end to the atrocities and brutality committed \r\nwith impunity by the LRA. \r\n The Great Lakes region is organizing a round \r\ntable conference in Bujumbura, Burundi, to be held \r\nfrom 5 to 6 November 2009, at which we expect \r\nrenewed support from the Group of Friends and other \r\npartners to finance the Pact on Security, Stability and \r\nDevelopment in the Great Lakes Region. \r\n Prior to the global economic downturn, Zambia’s \r\neconomic growth was on course to meet all but one of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, namely, ensuring \r\nenvironmental sustainability. However, the effect of the \r\nglobal financial and economic crisis, coupled with the \r\neffects of climate change, threaten the prospects of \r\nmeeting the MDGs on poverty, agriculture and \r\nenvironmental sustainability. \r\n The United Nations remains the central principal \r\norgan for coordinating international cooperation in \r\nsocio-economic development, peace, security, human \r\nrights and the rule of law. There is a need to reform the \r\nUnited Nations in order to make it more effective and \r\nefficient. Zambia believes that the reform of the United \r\nNations will not be complete without meaningful \r\nreform of the Security Council. Making the Council \r\nmore representative, democratic and accountable to all \r\nMember States, irrespective of status, is essential if its \r\ndecisions are to be acceptable to the entire \r\ninternational community. The Security Council must \r\nadapt to the realities of the new geopolitical situation \r\nthat characterize the world. \r\n Given that Africa constitutes the second largest \r\nbloc of United Nations membership, proposals to \r\nreform the Security Council should heed Africa’s call \r\nfor two permanent seats with veto power and two \r\nadditional non-permanent seats. That would address the \r\nhistorical injustice against Africa while responding to \r\nthe need to democratize the Security Council. Equally \r\nimportant in that regard is the need to reform the \r\nworking methods of that important United Nations \r\nbody. \r\n Human rights issues are an important component \r\nin the maintenance of peace and stability in any \r\ncountry. I wish to inform the Assembly that, since \r\nZambia was elected a member of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, in 2006, it has continued to advocate for the \r\npromotion and protection of human rights. In May \r\n2008, Zambia extended an open invitation to all \r\nmandate holders on special areas of focus relating to \r\nissues of human rights to visit and evaluate the extent \r\nto which Zambia observes its obligations under the \r\nvarious United Nations conventions. We urge other \r\ncountries to follow suit. \r\n Even in the post-cold-war era, nuclear arms pose \r\na threat to international peace and security and the very \r\nexistence of humankind. It is for that reason that \r\nZambia stands for general and complete disarmament \r\nin a time-bound manner, to include biological, \r\nchemical, nuclear and radiological weapons. The \r\ndemand of the time is that we compete for peace, not \r\nwar, for development and not armaments.  \r\n There is no doubt that the United Nations \r\ncontinues to be the only multilateral institution capable \r\nof addressing the challenges of our one world. This \r\nsession’s theme attests to that fact. The world looks up \r\nto this body to encourage dialogue among civilizations \r\non all global challenges in an inclusive manner as the \r\nonly practical way to ensure meaningful and effective \r\ninternational cooperation. \r\n Allow me to conclude by quoting Jonathan Rauch \r\nin the January 2001 issue of The Atlantic magazine, in \r\n A/64/PV.6\r\n \r\n49 09-52425 \r\n \r\nhis article entitled “The New Old Economy: Oil, \r\nComputers and the Reinvention of the Earth”, as \r\nquoted by R. A. Bisson and Jay Lehr in the preface to \r\ntheir book entitled Modern Groundwater Exploration. \r\nIn the article, which looked at future oil supply, \r\nMr. Rauch predicted that demand for oil will peter out \r\nwell before supply runs out because, he argued, \r\nsomething cheaper and cleaner would come along. He \r\nconcluded by stating that “knowledge, not petroleum, \r\nis becoming the critical resource in the oil business” \r\nand that, although the supply of oil is fixed, the supply \r\nof knowledge is boundless. \r\n Thus human ingenuity holds the secret to \r\nresolving problems confronting humankind. So it is \r\nwith all the issues facing us and this United Nations of \r\nours today. The resolution of our problems of climate \r\nchange, the economic and financial crisis, peace and \r\nsecurity and human rights and democracy depends \r\nupon human ingenuity. The United Nations must \r\ntherefore first — and most important — work to create \r\nan environment where ingenuity can indeed flourish, \r\nthat is, a peaceful world where all feel they belong and \r\nare treated with dignity. \r\n Before I conclude my remarks, let me just say a \r\nword or two about the embargo that has been imposed \r\non the people and Government of Cuba since 1959 by \r\nthe United States of America. Those unfair and \r\nunjustified sanctions have greatly hurt the people of \r\nCuba. The time has come for those sanctions to be \r\nlifted. I join those who are calling for the lifting of \r\nsanctions. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Zambia for the inspiring statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Rupiah Bwezani Banda, President of the \r\nRepublic of Zambia, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Stjepan Mesić, President of the Republic \r\nof Croatia \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Croatia. \r\n Mr. Stjepan Mesić, President of the Republic of \r\nCroatia, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Stjepan Mesić, President \r\nof the Republic of Croatia, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly. \r\n President Mesić (spoke in Croatian; English \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): We have \r\nassembled once again to discuss the situation in the \r\nworld, outline the problems our countries face and \r\npresent our views on the world we live in. The \r\nPresident of the General Assembly has offered a topic \r\nfor discussion, one which, I would say, perfectly \r\nreflects current circumstances and the tasks arising \r\nfrom them. \r\n What kind of world are we discussing here? A \r\nglobalized world? By all means. An interconnected and \r\ninterdependent world? Without any doubt. A world of \r\ngreat discrepancies and major threats? Certainly. In \r\nbrief, our world is such that there are practically no \r\nlonger regional problems and crises, since each and \r\nevery issue, no matter how much it may appear to be \r\nregional, reveals itself as global in terms of its \r\nconsequences. \r\n Our world is still dominated by developed and \r\nmost developed countries; while developing countries \r\nare desperately lagging behind, struggling with hunger, \r\nthe inability to educate their citizens and the lack of \r\neven the most basic health care. Can we be content \r\nwith such a world? Without any hesitation, I respond \r\nthat, no, we cannot. \r\n Mr. Viinanen (Finland), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n In our world there are many States as well as \r\ngroups that are united in their inclination to use terror \r\nas a means of action and to resort to force to achieve \r\ntheir goals. Admittedly, confrontation between the \r\nblocs no longer exists. A balance of fear between \r\nsuper-Powers is non-existent, but our world has hardly \r\nbecome more secure, while peace has hardly become \r\nmore stable. Can we be content with such a world? \r\nAgain, without any hesitation, I respond that, no, we \r\ncannot. \r\n Our world is ultimately still dominated by an \r\neconomic model that is self-evidently exhausted and \r\nhas now reached a stage where it is itself generating \r\ncrises and causing hardship to millions of people. If \r\none attempts to save that already obsolete model at any \r\ncost, and if one stubbornly defends a system based on \r\ngreed and devoid of any social value worth \r\nA/64/PV.6  \r\n \r\n09-52425 50 \r\n \r\nmentioning, there can be only one result: social unrest \r\nharbouring the potential to erupt into social insurgence \r\non a global scale. \r\n Can we accept such prospects? I respond with the \r\nutmost resolution that, no, we cannot, and must not. It \r\nis up to us to embark now upon the enormous task of \r\ncreating a new world order — not returning to anything \r\nthat existed before, but creating something new: an \r\norder that will in the end provide a life worthy of \r\nhumankind for each person and equal chances for all, \r\nand not one that writes off those who are in dire need \r\nthrough no fault of their own and those who at the end \r\nof their lives are viewed as useless and therefore \r\nunworthy of any support. \r\n It is up to us to dispel prejudices more resolutely \r\nthan ever before, to stand up to discrimination on \r\nwhatever grounds, to say no to intolerance and to \r\npromote not only the idea but also the practice of \r\nmultilateralism and dialogue among civilizations. That \r\nis the only way towards building global peace, security \r\nand development as vital preconditions for lasting and \r\nstable peace. \r\n Fortunately, the world has emerged from a \r\npotentially very dangerous period of unipolarism and is \r\nnow on a path towards multipolarism. However, the \r\nworld is still in the process of learning that only \r\ndialogue can help us to build mutual trust and \r\nunderstanding. It is not yet ready to face the fact that it \r\nis not a crime to be different and that our future can be \r\nfound only in unity through diversity — of course, \r\nunder the condition of full equality and strict \r\nobservance of human rights and in line with the United \r\nNations conventions.  \r\n With the simultaneous drift from unipolarism and \r\na shift towards multipolarism, we have to understand \r\nand accept that though we have established a set of \r\nuniversal values, we have not, will not and cannot \r\nestablish a single model of social and economic \r\nrelations applicable to all. The specific features of \r\nindividual nations and civilizations must be respected, \r\nsince there is no reason why anyone should renounce \r\nsomething that is part of his cultural or traditional \r\nheritage. \r\n Finally, a world characterized by international \r\npeace, security and development is not possible \r\nwithout disarmament, in particular without renouncing \r\nnuclear weapons. This was the topic of my address in \r\nthe Security Council this morning. I would like to \r\nmention in addition the notorious fact that problems of \r\ndevelopment would become minor if the huge funds \r\ncurrently allocated for armament were channelled into \r\ndevelopment. \r\n I reiterate: the task before us is enormous. Let us \r\nshow courage and political will to grapple with it. The \r\nRepublic of Croatia, although a small country, is ready \r\nto make its contribution. Although my ten-year term is \r\nnearing its end and this is the last time I stand at this \r\nrostrum, I will just say that I shall continue to place my \r\nskills at the service of achieving this noble goal. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Croatia for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Stjepan Mesić, President of the Republic of \r\nCroatia, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Litokwa Tomeing, President of the \r\nRepublic of the Marshall Islands \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of the \r\nMarshall Islands. \r\n Mr. Litokwa Tomeing, President of the Republic \r\nof the Marshall Islands, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Litokwa Tomeing, \r\nPresident of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and \r\nto invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Tomeing: I bring the greetings and \r\nbest wishes of the people of the Republic of the \r\nMarshall Islands. I congratulate the President on his \r\nelection to chair the Assembly at this session. He has \r\nour confidence and support.  \r\n I offer my gratitude to the United Nations for its \r\ncontinuing role in coordinating and leading the world’s \r\nefforts to meet challenges affecting the interests of all \r\nnations. The United Nations Joint Presence Office in \r\nthe Marshall Islands has brought the ideals of the \r\nOrganization closer to our people and country. Our \r\nhope is that other United Nations agencies — including \r\nthe World Health Organization, the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Fund for Women (UNIFEM), the Food \r\nand Agriculture Organization and the United Nations \r\n A/64/PV.6\r\n \r\n51 09-52425 \r\n \r\nEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and the \r\nPacific — will follow suit and make their presence felt \r\nmore prominently, producing concrete results on the \r\nground. \r\n I wish to acknowledge the personal commitment \r\nof the Secretary-General to meeting the challenges of \r\nclimate change. His reminder to take our best to the \r\ntable in Copenhagen in service of a higher calling to \r\nsave the planet is well noted. His call for a clear moral \r\nimperative for bold and decisive urgent action and his \r\nrecognition of the duty of the larger economies to the \r\nmost vulnerable have not gone unnoticed by us small \r\nisland States. Although some may consider as \r\ninsufficient the Group of 8 commitment in Italy this \r\nyear, I believe it is an encouraging and a necessary step \r\nforward. \r\n We cherish the hope that the increasing \r\nparticipation of the United States in debates on issues \r\nrelating to climate change is a signal of its intention to \r\ntake its rightful place at the forefront of the global war \r\nagainst climate change. Likewise, we are encouraged \r\nby Japan’s bold and new commitment to address the \r\nadverse effects of climate change. \r\n Let me express my appreciation to the Alliance of \r\nSmall Island States (AOSIS) for its leadership in \r\nassisting small island developing countries to prepare \r\nfor negotiations in Copenhagen. We assure AOSIS of \r\nour unwavering support. \r\n Full of expectation, the world has its eyes on \r\nCopenhagen. It will be an event of historic significance \r\nwhere, despite our differences, everyone can now view \r\nthe entire planet through a common perspective. \r\n Now, a few weeks away from Copenhagen, I feel \r\nmoved to ask what it is that we want to see happening \r\nin there. What kind of outcome do we expect? How \r\nshould we and future generations judge the success of \r\nCopenhagen? \r\n The answer, it seems to me, is a matter of \r\nperspective. Major economies will no doubt be \r\nwatchful that Copenhagen does not disturb too much \r\nan established way of life and all its benefits. I ask \r\nthese nations to consider the implicit moral obligation \r\nthat comes with their privileged and affluent status. \r\n For the small island States, however, the question \r\nis whether Copenhagen will diminish or enhance their \r\nsecurity and their chances of survival, whether the \r\npopulations of the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu, Tokelau \r\nand others should make haste to evacuate and head to \r\nsafer regions, as foreshadowed in a recent warning \r\nfrom the United Nations High Commissioner for \r\nRefugees. \r\n Therefore, our message to the leaders in \r\nCopenhagen is clear: we appeal to them to strive with \r\nevery fibre of their being to increase their level of \r\ncommitment to combating climate change, to show the \r\nworld by their deeds — not words — their unbending \r\ncommitment to secure an effective post-Kyoto global \r\nagreement. We appeal to them to be as unrestrained as \r\nthe wind and set the limit on the increase in global \r\naverage temperature above the pre-industrial period at \r\na level that will ensure our survival. We appeal to them \r\nto be fair-minded and to act with determination to \r\nreduce global emissions from 1990 levels by at least \r\n85 per cent by 2050. We appeal to them to ensure that \r\nglobal emissions peak no later than 2015. Finally, we \r\nappeal to the leaders of all nations to construct in \r\nCopenhagen the ark of salvation in which all nations \r\nand peoples will find shelter. \r\n I believe that the success of Copenhagen will be \r\nultimately judged by the extent to which small, low-\r\nlying island States — the most vulnerable — will feel a \r\nsense of guaranteed safety and security. For, in our \r\ninterdependent global community, the moral duty of \r\nthe collective must always be the protection of the \r\nweak and the most vulnerable. \r\n Short of that, however, Copenhagen will be no \r\nmore than the continuation of the law of the jungle, the \r\nsurvival of the strongest. It will be a moral and \r\npolitical failure. For Copenhagen is not about \r\nmathematics. It is not about raw power; it is not \r\ncompetition for the survival of the few. It is about \r\nunleashing the moral and political forces and synergies \r\ninherent in the collective body of nations for the good \r\nof all. What else does political will mean but this? \r\n Failure in Copenhagen will make a mockery of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, for their \r\nachievement will be beyond our capacity to attain. It \r\nwill question the ability of the Charter of the United \r\nNations to safeguard our pre-existing sovereign rights. \r\nIn short, the world and the most vulnerable in it cannot \r\nafford the cost of failure.  \r\n Closer to home, even though the rate of emission \r\nof the Marshall Islands is insignificant in relative \r\nterms, we have set for ourselves a reduction target of \r\n40 per cent by 2020. Over the years, and subject to \r\nA/64/PV.6  \r\n \r\n09-52425 52 \r\n \r\naccessibility of funding, we have been pursuing a \r\nsystematic programme of solar power use. Nearly 40 \r\nper cent of the households in our outer islands are now \r\ndrawing on that power as one of their main sources of \r\nenergy. We intend to pursue this initiative until all 33 \r\nislands in our country are fully covered. On the \r\nMicronesian subregional front, we are committed to the \r\ngoals of the Micronesia Challenge. \r\n Our efforts to adapt continue to suffer from the \r\nlack of adequate funding, compounded by the sheer \r\ncomplexity in accessing it from the sources. \r\nSimplifying the process by direct access to those \r\nsources could enable us to fast-track some of our \r\nadaptation priorities, such as seawalls, coastal \r\nmanagement and safe water projects. \r\n I now turn to a matter that is very dear to the \r\nheart of every Marshallese. We are deeply encouraged \r\nby the Security Council meeting today, moderated by \r\nPresident Obama, on the use and testing of nuclear \r\nweapons.  \r\n Nuclear weapon testing was conducted on our \r\nislands between 1946 and 1958, at the time when we \r\nwere a ward of the United Nations trusteeship system. \r\nOur first-hand experience as victims of nuclear weapon \r\ntesting on our islands, and the painful memories that \r\ncontinue to haunt us after six decades, are nightmares \r\nwe would not wish on anyone. The toll in human \r\nsuffering and environmental damage has been \r\ndevastating. Now, sixty years since the detonation of \r\nsome 67 nuclear bombs, the Marshall Islands is still \r\ngrappling with the after-effects. Complete recovery in \r\nterms of restoring affected islands to full economic \r\nproductivity and adequate compensation of the victims \r\nremains uncertain. \r\n We have not come here to condemn or to point \r\nfingers. However, we are compelled by our moral duty \r\nto humanity to raise our voice in gatherings such as \r\nthis and to appeal to the conscience of the world \r\ncommunity. We call for the formulation of a new \r\nperspective by which the spectre of war and of the use \r\nof nuclear weapons may forever be dismissed from the \r\nsurface of the Earth.  \r\n Banning nuclear weapons will not by itself \r\nremove the root cause of war. Important as it may be, it \r\ndoes not exert an enduring influence. People are too \r\ningenious not to invent still other forms of warfare. \r\nPolitical agreements or good intentions alone are not \r\nenough. The world craves something much more deep-\r\nseated than pure pragmatism. It yearns for permanent \r\npeace that springs from an inner state supported by a \r\nmoral attitude. \r\n There is no lack of recognition by national \r\nleaders of the nature of the problem, but there is a \r\nparalysis of will. The stark realities of the experience \r\nof the people of the Marshall Islands have deepened \r\nour profound conviction that, in a world irreversibly \r\nmoving towards a global society, it becomes imperative \r\nthat we recast our perspective, a perspective in which \r\nnational impulses and interests will find their fullest \r\nexpression when subordinated to the needs and \r\ninterests of the planet, our collective homeland, a \r\nperspective that does not regard that subordination as \r\nbeing disloyal to the nation. \r\n Amid our deepening economic and financial \r\nwoes, the Republic of the Marshall Islands continues to \r\nremain buoyant through the generous support of our \r\nfriends and partners. Our special relationship with the \r\nUnited States within the framework of the Compact of \r\nFree Association provides a unique partnership that is \r\nenduring and stable. \r\n We express our firm support for the efforts of the \r\nUnited States and its allies in combating terrorism, and \r\nwe are proud of our young Marshallese men and \r\nwomen serving in the armed forces of the United \r\nStates. The support also provided by Japan, the \r\nRepublic of China (Taiwan), the European Union, \r\nAustralia and our other donor partners is sincerely \r\nacknowledged. \r\n The increasing complexity of the management of \r\nevolving global affairs demands a reconstitution of the \r\nmembership of the Security Council. Japan’s \r\ndistinguished leadership and achievements in the area \r\nof human security match its aspirations to seek a \r\npermanent seat on the Council and thus deserve \r\nfavourable consideration. Evidence of progress in the \r\nconfidence-building process between China and the \r\nRepublic of China (Taiwan) deserves praise and \r\nencouragement from the international community. \r\nTaiwan’s membership in the United Nations \r\nspecialized agencies will enable its 23 million people \r\nto play an active part in the affairs of the family of \r\nnations. \r\n Not a single nation can escape the powerful grip \r\nof the challenges of climate change. Its deadly virus is \r\nhere already. The remedy is clear: collective and \r\nresolute action, now more than ever. The choice is \r\n A/64/PV.6\r\n \r\n53 09-52425 \r\n \r\nours. We implore Almighty God to give us courage and \r\nwisdom. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof the Marshall Islands for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n Mr. Litokwa Tomeing, President of the Republic \r\nof the Marshall Islands, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Lawrence Gonzi, Prime \r\nMinister of Malta \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of Malta. \r\n Mr. Lawrence Gonzi, Prime Minister of Malta, \r\nwas escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Lawrence Gonzi, Prime \r\nMinister of Malta, and inviting him to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n Mr. Gonzi (Malta): I would like to congratulate \r\nMr. Ali Treki on his unanimous election to preside over \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. His \r\nelection is a deserved tribute to his personal qualities \r\nas a seasoned politician and diplomat and also to his \r\ncountry, Libya, with which Malta has long-standing \r\nties of friendship and cooperation. I am sure that under \r\nhis wise leadership and experience this august \r\nAssembly will be guided throughout his term to a \r\nsuccessful and fruitful outcome. \r\n My delegation’s thanks and appreciation are \r\nextended to his distinguished predecessor, Father \r\nMiguel d’Escoto Brockmann, for the dedicated manner \r\nin which he presided over the work and activities of the \r\nsixty-third session. \r\n Malta would like to take this opportunity to \r\ncommend and thank the Secretary-General for his \r\nunstinting efforts in guiding our Organization in the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and stability \r\nworldwide. Under his leadership the United Nations \r\nhas made important strides in raising awareness and in \r\nmany instances responding effectively to the critical \r\nsituation of the poor and more vulnerable. It was \r\ntherefore of great satisfaction to my Government and \r\nthe Maltese people that we had the honour and \r\nprivilege to welcome him to Malta last April. \r\n This year Malta is marking three important \r\nanniversaries. The first is the forty-fifth anniversary of \r\nour country’s independence, on 21 September 1964; \r\nthe second is the fifteenth anniversary of the coming \r\ninto force on 21 March 1994 of the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change; and the \r\nthird is the fifteenth anniversary of the coming into \r\nforce on 16 November 1994 of the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea. \r\n Over the past 45 years, Malta has made good on \r\nthe pledge it made when it joined this Organization. In \r\nthis regard, I would like to avail myself of this \r\nopportunity to renew today, on this forty-fifth \r\nanniversary of Malta’s United Nations membership, \r\nour pledge and our unwavering faith and trust in the \r\nideals and purposes enshrined in the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n One of the issues which in the coming weeks will \r\nbe at the top of the international agenda is the \r\nCopenhagen Summit. Two days ago, this Hall \r\nwitnessed one of the largest-ever gatherings of Heads \r\nof State and Heads of Government to debate the future \r\nof our planet Earth. During this unique summit we all \r\nagreed that the challenges posed by climate change \r\nhave become the most urgent and critical faced by \r\nhumankind. \r\n It will be recalled that in 1988, when Malta took \r\nthe initiative to formally submit the issue of climate \r\nchange as a political item on the agenda of the forty-\r\nthird session of the General Assembly, few of us would \r\nhave thought at that time that this issue of climate \r\nchange would become in the span of two decades one \r\nof the principal critical issues dominating the \r\ninternational environmental concerns of this new \r\ncentury. Throughout these 20 years, Malta has been in \r\nthe forefront of those ensuring that climate change \r\ncontinues to be one of the top-priority issues of our \r\ntimes. Our commitment of 20 years ago remains \r\nsteadfast and as strong as ever. As we have heard \r\nduring the past few days, the outcome of the \r\nCopenhagen Summit must signal a turning point. Malta \r\nstrongly believes that it is the duty of all countries, \r\nlarge and small, rich and poor, to contribute their fair \r\nshare to this concerted effort, which must be global if it \r\nis to succeed. \r\nA/64/PV.6  \r\n \r\n09-52425 54 \r\n \r\n On 16 November of this year, Member States will \r\ncommemorate the fifteenth anniversary of the coming \r\ninto force of the United Nations Convention on the \r\nLaw of the Sea, which has been described as the \r\nconstitution for regulating humankind’s activities \r\nrelating to the oceans. It was 42 years ago that, in this \r\nHall, Malta once again called on Member States to \r\nundertake a reform of the law of the sea, which \r\neventually culminated in the adoption of the current \r\nConvention on 10 December 1982. \r\n It is also necessary to see the 1982 convention in \r\nthe light of some pressing and contemporary problems \r\nwhich are either being addressed inadequately or not \r\nbeing addressed at all. Among these deficiencies are \r\nthe provisions dealing with piracy, illicit traffic in \r\nnarcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, the rules \r\nrelating to the protection and preservation of the \r\nmarine environment and the rules dealing with \r\nsubmarine cables and pipelines. Examples of omissions \r\nare the trafficking of human beings, the safety and \r\nsecurity of navigation, the transportation of weapons of \r\nmass destruction, and climate change. \r\n In the light of the issues I have just mentioned, \r\nMalta feels that the time has come for the General \r\nAssembly to examine possible approaches to a review \r\nof the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea. In this \r\ncontext, Malta would like to propose that the General \r\nAssembly, through its relevant bodies, undertake \r\nappropriate consultations among its Member States to \r\nrevise the Convention in view of the passage of time \r\nand the emergence of new and critical issues over the \r\nyears. My delegation will be ready to enter into \r\nconsultations with other interested Member States to \r\nadvance this proposal further. \r\n Just as it was necessary in 1948 to recognize the \r\nneed for a universal declaration of human rights as a \r\nfundamental condition for the enjoyment of freedom, \r\njustice and peace for all men and women around the \r\nworld, so it has become vital now to have a \r\nconcomitant declaration on human duties of the present \r\ngeneration, including our responsibilities towards \r\nfuture generations. We have the overall task of \r\nconserving the human species in the sacredness of its \r\nlife and in its continuity, as well as of preserving the \r\nenvironment, in all its manifestations. We believe that \r\nsuch a declaration emanates naturally from that \r\ndoctrine of the common heritage of mankind, which \r\nmy country first mooted before this Assembly in 1967 \r\nand which eventually led to the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea. \r\n Malta believes that human duties are intrinsic to \r\nthe personality, oneness and uniqueness of the human \r\nbeing, and are as inalienable as human rights. Those \r\nduties do not arise from laws or obligations but are \r\ninherent to the human being. Such duties relate to \r\nhuman beings themselves and to their fellow beings, \r\nand in a special manner to their family, to the \r\ncommunity at all levels and to the natural and cultural \r\nenvironment in which their life evolves. The envisaged \r\ndeclaration, strengthening and fulfilling the thrust of \r\nthe 1948 universal instrument, should mark the work of \r\nthis Assembly as a consummate service to the \r\ninternational community. It should stand out as a major \r\nachievement of the United Nations at the beginning of \r\nthe third millennium of our era. It is in this spirit that \r\nMalta proposes that consideration be given to the \r\ndrafting of such a declaration on human duties and \r\nresponsibilities. \r\n Conflicts around the world have continued to \r\naffect the political, economic and social development \r\nof many countries and a large part of our societies. It is \r\ntragic that in the past decade more than two million \r\ninnocent children were killed and six million seriously \r\ninjured in conflicts. The role of the United Nations in \r\npreventive diplomacy and support to peace processes \r\nmust enjoy strong and sustainable political backing \r\nfrom Member States. \r\n A number of hotspots, from Somalia and \r\nAfghanistan to the Democratic Republic of the Congo \r\nand the Middle East, continue to challenge our \r\ncollective search for peaceful and long-lasting \r\nsolutions for these war-torn countries and regions. \r\nMalta therefore welcomes our Organization’s \r\nengagement through its peacekeeping missions and \r\npeacebuilding mechanisms to foster political dialogue \r\nand reconciliation among the warring parties. We \r\nbelieve that assisting countries emerging from conflict \r\nin the rebuilding of the lives of their populations would \r\ncontribute in no small way to providing the necessary \r\nsupport to nationally driven efforts in the achievement \r\nof sustainable peace and development. \r\n One of the long-standing issues of which the \r\nUnited Nations has been seized since its inception is \r\nthe question of the Middle East. Indeed, peace in the \r\nMiddle East continues to evade our ongoing efforts. \r\nMalta reiterates its vision of a two-State solution, with \r\n A/64/PV.6\r\n \r\n55 09-52425 \r\n \r\nboth States living in secure and guaranteed frontiers, \r\neach recognizing the other’s sovereignty, and the right \r\nto peaceful coexistence. Malta calls in both parties to \r\nengage fully in resumed negotiations to this end, \r\nresulting in a viable Palestinian State on the basis of \r\nthe June 1967 borders. This is not a view which we \r\nhave adopted today. It is a vision that has been ours for \r\ndecades, believing as we do that peace in the Middle \r\nEast determines peace in the Mediterranean and \r\nbeyond. \r\n Malta’s strategic geographic location in the \r\nMediterranean has placed it in the privileged yet \r\nresponsible position of building bridges between the \r\ntwo continents. In fact, Malta’s vocation towards peace \r\nand security in the Mediterranean continues to occupy \r\nan important place of my Government’s foreign policy \r\npriorities. During the past 12 months, Malta has \r\ncontinued to build on the achievements made so far by \r\nenhancing the dialogue between countries in the \r\nMediterranean region and the European Union and also \r\nwith the League of Arab States. It is with a strong \r\nsense of political commitment and direction that we in \r\nMalta bear the responsibility of hosting the liaison \r\noffice aimed at strengthening cooperation between the \r\nEuropean Union and League of Arab States, which is \r\ndue to be opened this coming October. Malta believes \r\nthat the liaison office will render a major contribution \r\nto deepening mutual understanding through practical \r\ncooperation between Europe and the Arab world, as \r\nwell as enhancing intercultural dialogue. \r\n Members will recall that last year I raised the \r\nissue of the influx of illegal immigrants who risk their \r\nlives in crossing the Mediterranean to seek a new \r\nbeginning. I had indicated that our size and our \r\nfinancial and human resources, which are very limited, \r\nmake it extremely difficult for Malta to cope with the \r\nlarge number of these unfortunate people arriving on \r\nour shores on their way to mainland Europe. Malta has \r\nalways dealt with this situation with great \r\nresponsibility, humanity and benevolence, paying due \r\nrespect to every human being without any exception. \r\nAnd we will continue to do so. At the same time, the \r\nproblem of illegal immigration is an international \r\nphenomenon driven by external factors which cannot \r\nalways be prevented or even mitigated by the countries \r\ndirectly affected by the problem. We therefore strongly \r\nfeel that the United Nations should address the issue of \r\nillegal immigration in a holistic way so as to find \r\nsolutions to a humanitarian problem that Malta and \r\nother like us, especially in the Mediterranean, are \r\ncurrently facing. Much more needs to be done, and all \r\nof us, including countries of origin and countries of \r\ntransit, need to step up our efforts in order to deal with \r\nthis challenge. \r\n My Government is deeply appreciative of those \r\ncountries that have come forward to assist us in coping \r\nwith this phenomenon, including the United States of \r\nAmerica, France, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Portugal, \r\nSlovenia and Slovakia. My Government also hopes that \r\nother countries will come forward to assist in \r\nalleviating the burden which Malta carries — a burden \r\nso acutely disproportionate to the country’s population, \r\nwealth and land area. \r\n In his report on the work of the Organization, the \r\nSecretary-General has laid emphasis on the need to \r\nembark on a multilateral effort of immense magnitude \r\n“that draws upon the strengths and contributions of all \r\nthe countries of the world, as well as their citizens” \r\n(A/64/1, para. 4). Malta believes that such an effort \r\nmust find its foundations in this Organization where all \r\nMember States are equal and where the many \r\nchallenges facing humankind can be addressed in a \r\ncohesive and coherent manner. The global challenges \r\nwhich the United Nations faces are our challenges. We, \r\nas Member States, have an obligation and the \r\nresponsibility to ensure that our Organization lives up \r\nto the commitments and decisions that we, as heads of \r\nState and Government, solemnly undertake to \r\nimplement in the best interests of our constituencies \r\nand societies. \r\n Allow me to conclude by stating that Malta \r\ncontinues to strongly believe that together, as Members \r\nof the United Nations, we can and should continue to \r\nsupport the Organization, our Secretary-General and all \r\nthose who contribute to making our world a better \r\nplace for present and future generations. I know that \r\nMalta intends to do so. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Malta for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Lawrence Gonzi, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Malta, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n \r\nA/64/PV.6  \r\n \r\n09-52425 56 \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Mikheil Saakashvili, President \r\nof Georgia \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of Georgia. \r\n Mr. Mikheil Saakashvili, President of Georgia, \r\nwas escorted into the General Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Mikheil Saakashvili, \r\nPresident of Georgia, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\n President Saakashvili: I am grateful for the \r\nopportunity to address the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-fourth session. \r\n Each year, we gather here to confront our \r\ncommon challenges and to express our vision for the \r\nworld we share, the world for which we are common \r\nstewards. And each year we promise to do more and to \r\ndo better to live up to and defend the principles \r\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter. \r\n This year, we meet on the twentieth anniversary \r\nof the most successful triumph of those principles. \r\nTwenty years have passed since Europe and the rest of \r\nthe world were liberated from one of the cruellest \r\nepisodes in modern history. The fall of the Berlin Wall \r\nbrought an end to an artificial line that separated \r\nnations, divided families, strangled freedom and \r\nimprisoned millions. Remarkably, that formidable wall \r\ncrumbled without a single shot being fired. It yielded \r\nto the will of those millions who yearned for liberty \r\nand it yielded to the determination of a united West. \r\n Twenty years ago, a universally feared military \r\nforce was defeated by the force of a universal truth — \r\nthe call for freedom and the simple desire to live a \r\ndignified life. When the Berlin Wall was dismantled \r\n20 years ago, it did more than free the captive nations \r\nof the Warsaw Pact. It unleashed the hopes, dreams, \r\naspirations and talents of millions of citizens living \r\nunder the tyranny of the Soviet Union — including my \r\nown nation’s people. \r\n Today, these citizens make up more than a dozen \r\ndiverse nations, linked together by the common desires \r\nand ambitions to live in a world free from spheres of \r\ninfluence — free from external control — and to be \r\nable to choose their own destiny. Today, as we look \r\nback at that historic chapter and the impact it has had \r\non our world, we can rightly be proud of what was \r\nachieved, the tremendous progress that has been made, \r\nand the prosperity that a lasting peace has brought. \r\n But if we are to evaluate the past honestly, we \r\nmust admit that the present remains bittersweet. For \r\nthere is a real danger that, rather than build on this \r\ngreat chapter of idealism and progress, States and \r\nleaders will allow a return of the dull complacency and \r\ncynical power politics that led to so many of the worst \r\nmoments of the past 100 years. \r\n And the moment is bittersweet because, \r\nregrettably, not everyone drew the same lessons of \r\nhope and inspiration when that wall came down. \r\nIndeed, 20 years ago, when freedom’s spirit swept that \r\nwall away, few imagined the repression and threats it \r\nrepresented would so soon reappear and that the hopes \r\nunleashed in 1989 would so quickly founder. Yet today, \r\na Europe that is whole, free, and at peace remains a \r\ngoal still to be achieved — a project not yet \r\naccomplished and a challenge, unfortunately, unmet. \r\n Today, I stand before the Assembly as the \r\ndemocratically elected leader of a proud and sovereign \r\nnation. But, tragically, Georgia today, like Germany a \r\ngeneration ago, is a nation with a deep wound running \r\nthrough it. As Václav Havel and other leading voices  \r\nof Europe’s conscience declared earlier this week, \r\nEurope is today divided by a new wall built by an \r\noutside force — a wall that runs through the middle of \r\nGeorgia. \r\n This wall has been built by the same people who \r\nmiss the Berlin Wall, who regret its fall, who did \r\neverything so that the wall would not fall. This wall \r\ncuts off one fifth of our territory and, once again, \r\ndivides Europe from itself, creating new lines of \r\nrepression and fear, artificial dividing lines inside the \r\ninternationally recognized borders of a European \r\nnation. \r\n It may be unpopular, but I am obliged to speak \r\nthe truth. And the truth is that this wall’s existence \r\nmocks the progress we seemed to have made since that \r\nbright, shining day in Berlin 20 years ago. This new \r\nwall tells us that, once again, the rule of force has \r\ntrumped the rule of law and the rule of reason. \r\n I see no irony — only tragedy — in the fact that \r\nthis wall is being built by the very people whose ideas \r\nwere collectively and decisively defeated and rejected \r\njust 20 years ago. I take no comfort in the fact that \r\n A/64/PV.6\r\n \r\n57 09-52425 \r\n \r\nthose who thought the wall’s destruction was the single \r\ngreatest tragedy of the twentieth century now lead \r\nthese deplorable efforts. \r\n One year ago, my country was invaded. Tanks, \r\nwarplanes, warships, bombs and State-directed cyber-\r\nhackers descended upon our towns, villages, cities, \r\ninfrastructure and economy. Hundreds of our people \r\nwere killed within days and thousands were wounded. \r\nTens of thousands of innocent civilians were forced to \r\nflee in the face of ethnic cleansing, which independent \r\nhuman rights organizations have documented very \r\nwell. \r\n Today, these acts of brutality have gone \r\nunaddressed, in direct contravention of international \r\nlaw, the norms of this institution and internationally \r\nsigned agreements designed to reverse these wrongs. \r\nThese are the facts that confront us as we gather here \r\ntoday, and these facts have a name: armed aggression, \r\nethnic cleansing, mass violation of human rights and \r\ncontinuing illegal occupation. \r\n Those who unleashed war in our region and in my \r\ncountry and led ethnic cleansing campaigns in Georgia \r\nsaid yesterday — in this very Hall, from this very \r\nrostrum — that they had to do it to “implement the \r\nprinciple of the indivisibility of security” in order to \r\n“move beyond the legacy of the past” (A/64/PV.4). This \r\nis la langue de bois — very classical langue de bois \r\nfrom the old days. \r\n The only thing that they stepped over in reality \r\nwas our sovereign border. They said they had to do it, \r\njust as their predecessors had to invade Poland — \r\nbecause of Poland’s reckless desire to be free — in \r\n1939, Finland in 1940, Hungary in 1956, \r\nCzechoslovakia in 1968, and Afghanistan in 1979. The \r\nsame people had to erase a capital of 400,000 \r\ninhabitants — Grozny — to destroy and exterminate \r\nthe proud Chechen nation and kill tens of thousands of \r\ninnocent women and children. And I am saying on the \r\nrecord that the clock is ticking, and they will have to \r\ndo it again, and they will do it again unless they are \r\nstopped by all of us. Recent history indeed is a \r\npowerful guide to understanding what kind of actions \r\nthese leaders undertake in order to bring what they call \r\nsecurity and stability to my nation. \r\n But I want to say clearly today that the people of \r\nGeorgia cannot and will not accept a new dividing line \r\nin our country. That is an unchangeable commitment. \r\nUnder these daily menaces, military provocations and \r\nall kinds of lies directed against us from many different \r\nsources, my nation will not crumble and we will never \r\nsurrender to this brutal force. \r\n The wall across Europe is not a matter of concern \r\nto Georgia alone. Indeed, in this matter the very values \r\nof this institution are under threat. The protection of \r\nhuman rights, respect for the dignity and equality of all \r\npersons, the inadmissibility of ethnic cleansing and the \r\nrecognition of the inviolability of sovereign borders — \r\nall these are values that form the bedrock of this \r\ninstitution.  \r\n We certainly did not choose this course of action, \r\nbut it is up to us to recognize and reverse its illegality. \r\nAs a community of responsible nations, it is our \r\ncollective responsibility to uphold international law \r\nand to insist that borders cannot and will not be \r\nchanged through the use of force. It is up to us to tear \r\ndown this new wall peacefully with the power of our \r\nideas and the strength of our convictions. I want the \r\nworld to understand clearly how we view this new wall \r\nand our strategy for tearing it down. \r\n To start with, let me state outright that we do not \r\nexpect it to disappear overnight. We understand that it \r\nis a very, very hard process, but the history of the \r\nBerlin Wall teaches us that patience must never be \r\npassive. We should never become resigned to the idea \r\nthat this situation should be accepted or tolerated. The \r\nBerlin Wall fell only because passionate, disciplined, \r\nenergetic partisans of freedom, both behind and outside \r\nthat wall, worked with focus, discipline, courage and \r\ndetermination to remind the world community of the \r\nillegitimacy and illegality of that wall, and to take \r\naction to hasten its demise. \r\n I would like to take this opportunity to thank \r\nthose States Members of the United Nations for their \r\nvotes recognizing the right of return for all who have \r\nbeen displaced and for all the victims of ethnic \r\ncleansing. I would like to thank all those nations across \r\nthe globe that resisted illegal pressure — and in many \r\ncases attempts at bribery — by standing firm in their \r\nnon-recognition of those territories of Georgia now \r\noccupied by a foreign force. I want to thank all those \r\nnations that have been so generous in pledging and \r\nproviding the vital economic support that has proved \r\ninvaluable in helping to build shelters for and rebuild \r\nthe dreams of those the invasion has made refugees and \r\ninternally displaced persons. On behalf of all my \r\nfellow citizens, I wish to thank them for their \r\nA/64/PV.6  \r\n \r\n09-52425 58 \r\n \r\ngenerosity, especially at a time of such extreme \r\nhardship around the world. \r\n Beyond the comfort provided by their material \r\nsupport, I want to thank all of Georgia’s friends who \r\nhave defended not only our sovereignty, but our right \r\nto forge our own path in the world, to choose our own \r\nalliances and to reject the nineteenth-century notion of \r\nspheres of influence, which led to so much warfare, \r\nrepression and hardship in the world’s history. I want \r\nto thank those nations and leaders of the European \r\nUnion who today have committed their monitors to \r\nGeorgia for the promotion of peace. The Georgian \r\npeople are also grateful to United States President \r\nObama for his unyielding words and very strong \r\ndeclarations of support for our sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity, as well as to Vice President Biden \r\nfor visiting Georgia this summer and for underscoring, \r\nin meeting with refugee children, America’s \r\ncommitment to our democracy and our right to choose \r\nour own future. In particular, I want to thank the \r\nUnited Nations for more than 16 years of contributions \r\nto peace on the ground in Georgia through its presence \r\nin our country — a presence recently and abruptly \r\nhalted by the unilateral actions of one single Member \r\nState. \r\n Our future depends on us, and so today I also \r\nwant to report to the United Nations on the progress \r\nGeorgia has made, through our own efforts, in the year \r\nsince we suffered Europe’s first invasion in the post-\r\ncold war era. One year after losing hundreds of our \r\nsons and daughters and after seeing hundreds of \r\nthousands of our people displaced, the Georgian people \r\nhave regrouped and made real progress down the path \r\nof peace, freedom and individual liberty. \r\n I would like to pay tribute to their courage. Just a \r\nfew days ago, in a refugee camp outside Tbilisi, I saw \r\nyoung children demonstrating their unstoppable will to \r\nhave a normal and free life. These were children of all \r\nethnic backgrounds. Indeed, most of the refugees from \r\nSouth Ossetia are ethnic Ossetians, and they fled from \r\nso-called liberators or were forced out. The children I \r\nsaw in that refugee camp were seizing the opportunity \r\nto learn how to compete in the modern age using new \r\ncomputers, mastering English and advancing their \r\npursuit of knowledge, despite the odds. These children \r\nare the future of my country. These children symbolize \r\nthe path Georgia took after the invasion. \r\n We are following through on the promises I made \r\nat this rostrum last year to strengthen our democracy, \r\nfoster pluralism and expand individual liberties. \r\nAlready, we have set reforms in motion that within the \r\nnext year will advance the progress of the Rose \r\nRevolution and irreversibly deepen our identity as the \r\nfreest State in our region. Already, we have permitted \r\nnearly three months of opposition protests to proceed \r\nunhindered, even though they closed down the main \r\nstreets of our capital and paralysed Government \r\nbuildings. Our actions reflect our deep commitment to \r\npluralism and our respect for dissent and freedom of \r\nspeech.  \r\n In a situation where enemy troops are just two \r\ndozen kilometres from the capital, with their artillery \r\npointed at the city centre, we have already given \r\nopposition-controlled broadcast stations license to \r\ntransmit across the nation. Already, we have brought \r\nopposition parties into the meetings of our national \r\nsecurity council, basically keeping no secrets from \r\nthem and giving full access to all State information, so \r\nas to ensure that our security policies reflect the unified \r\nwill of the nation, beyond faction and beyond party. \r\nAlready, we have committed to the direct election of \r\nall mayors in a few months’ time, and we have begun \r\nthe development of new electoral rules, based on \r\nconsensus and the agreement of different political \r\nparties, in order to ensure the greatest possible \r\nlegitimacy of the next local, parliamentary and \r\npresidential elections. \r\n Along with all these efforts and our commitment \r\nto democratic reforms, our biggest imperative today is \r\nto continue to integrate all different political interests \r\nand groups in promoting a better everyday life for our \r\ncitizens. We are also doing everything we can to \r\nrebuild our economy. \r\n The Georgian people are skilled and hard-\r\nworking, but they are enduring the double punishment \r\nof the global economic downturn and the economic \r\nconsequences of last summer’s invasion. Our biggest \r\nimperative at home is to create more employment, and \r\nwe are pursuing that goal every day. Indeed, we are \r\nheartened and proud that the World Bank recently \r\nranked Georgia as the eleventh most attractive country \r\nin the world for doing business, when only a few years \r\nago we ranked 122nd. We also rank first in Eastern and \r\nCentral Europe, just one year after the invasion. And \r\nwe will continue to take steps to strengthen our \r\neconomy and create more employment. \r\n A/64/PV.6\r\n \r\n59 09-52425 \r\n \r\n We are resolutely committed to our vision of a \r\nsovereign and unified Georgia. Together with all of \r\nGeorgia’s diverse ethnic groups and religions, we will \r\nprevail over the illegal occupation and reverse the \r\nresults of ethnic cleansing. \r\n Abkhazia is the birthplace of Georgian \r\ncivilization. Since the days of the ancient kingdom of \r\nColchida — which was the birthplace of one of the \r\nmost interesting and ancient European cultures, \r\nbeginning with Jason and the Argonauts — it has been \r\na valuable and vibrant part of our journey through \r\nhistory. Just a few years ago, it remained a very vibrant \r\npart of Georgia. And that most vibrant and successful \r\npart of Georgia has now been emptied of more than \r\nthree quarters of its population. Gardens, hotels, \r\ntheatres and restaurants have been replaced by military \r\nbases, minefields and graveyards. It will take time, but \r\nI am sure that Abkhazia will once again be what it \r\nwas — the most wonderful part of Georgia — and that \r\nthe occupation will be merely a part of history.  \r\n I came here today to deliver a simple message. \r\nWe believe that Georgia is winning the peace, and here \r\nis how the Assembly can measure our commitment. \r\nDid we crumble in the face of the brutal invasion? No. \r\nDid we crack down on dissent? No. Did we reduce \r\nfreedom in the face of recession? No. Even in the face \r\nof adversity, we continue to contribute to the common \r\ngoals established by our friends and the international \r\ncommunity at large. \r\n I am proud to say that Georgia is in the vanguard \r\nof the battle against climate change, producing 85 per \r\ncent of its electricity from green and renewable \r\nsources. That percentage is growing, and within the \r\nnext three years we will cover 100 per cent of our \r\nneeds. Meanwhile, we are on the front lines in \r\nconfronting terrorism throughout the world with our \r\nallies, including in Afghanistan, where our troops will \r\nserve side by side with others from around the world. \r\n We are winning the peace because, every day, the \r\nnations of our region become more and more \r\nindependent from our common imperial legacy. Every \r\nday, regional States increasingly reject the tremendous \r\npressure generated by our common past. Every day, the \r\nidea that we can resist revanchist tendencies is \r\nspreading further, and every day the arc of independent \r\nnations — from Ukraine to Moldova and from \r\nUzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan to Mongolia — is telling \r\nthe world that spheres of influence are a thing of the \r\npast.  \r\n Georgia is not only a country; the new wall that \r\ncuts across our territory has transformed Georgia into \r\nan idea and a test. It is an idea of freedom and \r\nindependence and a test for the world — a test that the \r\nworld must not fail. If the world passes the test, then \r\neveryone will be amazed at how quickly the region will \r\ndevelop its tremendous potential. An active, patient \r\nvictory over this new wall would be a crucial step in \r\nthe effort to build energy security for free nations and a \r\nunited front against lawlessness and terrorism. Georgia \r\nis a place where all cultures, influences, religions and \r\ntraditions meet, providing an antidote to the threat of a \r\nclash of civilizations. \r\n Yesterday, President Obama said clearly that new \r\nwalls should not divide us, that the future belongs to \r\nthose who build and not to those who destroy, and that \r\ncooperation and values must prevail against division \r\nand cynicism. Today, I want to stress how much we \r\nshare that vision and how vital that vision is to my \r\ncountry, my region and beyond. \r\n Twenty years ago, the velvet revolutions opened a \r\nnew era of international relations and a new journey \r\nbegan towards a free and cooperative world. I am \r\nconfident that we will prevail on that journey, but only \r\nif we are not complacent or passive and only if we \r\nsupport and defend our deeply held values. After all, \r\nonly this week, the clarion voice of those velvet \r\nrevolutions two decades ago — the voice of Václav \r\nHavel — offered us a solemn reminder about the \r\ndangers that we have yet to overcome. Speaking about \r\nthe new wall that now divides Georgia, he wrote, \r\ntogether with other prominent Europeans, that \r\n“the failure of western democracies to respond to \r\nthe dismemberment of a friendly nation, albeit a \r\nsmall one, can have very serious global \r\nconsequences … The European Union was built \r\nagainst the temptation of Munich and the iron \r\ncurtain. It would be utterly disastrous if we were \r\nto appear in any way to condone the kind of \r\npractices that plunged our continent into war and \r\ndivision for most of the last century. At stake is \r\nnothing less than the fate of the project to which \r\nwe continue to dedicate our lives: the peaceful \r\nand democratic reunification of the European \r\ncontinent”. \r\nA/64/PV.6  \r\n \r\n09-52425 60 \r\n \r\n We must not fail to hear Václav Havel’s call, \r\nPresident Obama’s call and the call of one of my \r\npersonal heroes from Russia, Anna Politkovskaya, who \r\nwas so brutally silenced. I remember my conversation \r\nwith Ms. Politkovskaya just a few days before she was \r\nmurdered. She was my friend and my hero, and I \r\nremember the hopes that she expressed. Their calls \r\necho across two decades of progress — progress that \r\nhas inspired the greatest hopes but that remains very \r\nfragile. Today and together, we must provide answers. \r\nToday and together, we must show leadership and \r\nvision. Today and together, we must demonstrate our  \r\n \r\ncommon resolve. And most of all, today and together, \r\nwe must provide an example, showing that the power \r\nof our values and ideals will finally unleash the \r\ntremendous human potential within all of us.  \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of Georgia for \r\nthe statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Mikheil Saakashvili, President of Georgia, \r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall. \r\nThe meeting rose at 10.10 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
