(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 9.10 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Robert G. Mugabe, President of the \r\nRepublic of Zimbabwe \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nRepublic of Zimbabwe. \r\n Mr. Robert G. Mugabe, President of the Republic \r\nof Zimbabwe, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Robert G. Mugabe, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Zimbabwe, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly. \r\n President Mugabe: Let me begin by extending \r\nour warmest congratulations to you, Sir, on your \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-fourth session. Your election to this high office is \r\na fitting and eloquent tribute to the personal and \r\ndiplomatic qualities that we have witnessed in you over \r\nthe years. We are indeed proud of the honour that has \r\nbeen bestowed upon the African continent by your \r\nelection. We are confident that under your wise \r\nstewardship we will make pleasing progress on the \r\nimportant agenda before us. \r\n In the same vein, Mr. President, I wish to \r\ncommend your predecessor, the President at the sixty-\r\nthird session, Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann, for \r\nhaving brought his experience and wisdom to bear \r\nupon the various meetings and conferences that he \r\npresided over during the last year. He brought integrity, \r\ntransparency and credibility to the deliberations of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. Indeed, we share his assertion that \r\nthe “G-192” — that is, the General Assembly — being \r\nthe most representative body of the United Nations, is \r\nthe best forum in which to tackle global issues, which \r\ninclude the current financial and economic crises. We \r\ncommend him for standing up for what is right and for \r\nupholding the right of each Member State, no matter \r\nhow small, to be heard. \r\n Over the years, my delegation has underlined the \r\nneed for the United Nations and other international \r\nbodies to truly serve the collective interest of all \r\nMember States. Our unchanging conviction is that all \r\ninternational institutions should abide by the universal \r\nprinciples that underlie the multilateral processes of \r\ndecision-making, particularly, the principle of equality \r\namong States and the right to development. It is in this \r\ncontext that we welcome the appropriate, indeed, \r\ntimely, theme of this session, namely, effective global \r\nresponses to global crises, and strengthening \r\nmultilateralism and dialogue among civilizations. It is \r\nour hope that we will have a candid and holistic debate \r\non the global responses to the crises that currently \r\naffect our world. \r\n Zimbabwe supports the revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly in order to make it more effective \r\nand thus enable it to fulfil its mandate. As the \r\npre-eminent deliberative and policymaking body of the \r\nUnited Nations, the Assembly should play a more \r\nactive role in mobilizing action against such challenges \r\nA/64/PV.7  \r\n \r\n09-52463 2 \r\n \r\ntoday as the maintenance of peace and security, the \r\nfinancial and economic crises, economic and social \r\ndevelopment and climate change.  \r\n Accordingly, the encroachment of other United \r\nNations organs on the work of the General Assembly is \r\nof great concern to us. We therefore reiterate that any \r\nprocess of revitalization should strengthen the principle \r\nof the accountability of all principal and subsidiary \r\norgans of the United Nations to the Assembly. \r\n It is our hope that the current negotiations on the \r\nreform of the Security Council will break the deadlock \r\nthat for some time now has prevented us from making \r\nprogress in an area of strategic interest to Africa. The \r\nreform of the Council is not only desirable but \r\nimperative if it is to ensure the successful \r\nimplementation of its global mandate to maintain \r\ninternational peace and security on behalf of all \r\nMember States.  \r\n The fact that Africa, a major geographical region, \r\nremains underrepresented and without a permanent seat \r\non the Security Council is not only a serious and \r\nantiquated anomaly whose time for address is overdue. \r\nIt is also clearly an untenable violation of the principle \r\nand practice of democracy in international relations. \r\nThe reform of the Security Council should urgently \r\ntake full notice of the African position, which demands \r\ntwo permanent seats, with complete veto power — as \r\nlong as the veto lasts — plus two additional \r\nnon-permanent seats. \r\n The United Nations Conference on the World \r\nFinancial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on \r\nDevelopment, held in June 2009, rightfully positioned \r\nthe Organization at the centre of efforts to deal with the \r\nglobal financial and economic crisis. The devastating \r\neffect of the current global crisis has clearly exposed \r\nthe folly of leaving the management of the global \r\neconomy in the hands of a few self-appointed countries \r\nand groupings.  \r\n My delegation, therefore, fully supports the \r\nsetting up of a follow-up working group under the \r\naegis of the General Assembly. It is urgent and critical \r\nthat the working group reach an early agreement on \r\nimmediate policy actions to be taken by the \r\ninternational community in support of developing \r\ncountries, which have suffered the most as a result of \r\nthis global financial meltdown. Such actions should \r\ninclude the development of a global stimulus plan to \r\nrespond to the crisis and issues related to it. \r\n Those measures will not achieve the desired \r\nobjectives unless accompanied by a comprehensive \r\nreform of the Bretton Woods institutions. Such reforms \r\nwould, inter alia, include representation of sub-Saharan \r\nAfrica on the Executive Boards of these institutions. \r\nWe are glad that our unequivocal call for their reform \r\nis beginning to bear fruit. We welcome the recent \r\ndecision by the World Bank to establish three seats for \r\nAfrica on its Executive Board. We are similarly pleased \r\nthat, earlier this month, the International Monetary \r\nFund finalized the re-allocation of special drawing \r\nrights on the basis of the $250 billion pledged by the \r\nGroup of 20 at its meeting in April 2009. Regrettably, \r\nonly a mere $18 billion of this money was allocated to \r\nlow-income countries, while the developed countries — \r\nwhich caused the crisis, after all — got the lion’s share. \r\n The need to ensure global food security has been \r\nraised and restated at many international forums. We \r\nreiterate our call for an urgent and substantial increase \r\nin investment in agriculture in developing countries. It \r\nis critical that provisions of agricultural inputs — \r\nseeds, fertilizers and chemicals — be put in place for \r\nsmall-scale farmers, particularly women.  \r\n To achieve this, we need to channel more support \r\ntowards agriculture, which has dwindled over the last \r\nfew decades. In addition, we call upon developed \r\ncountries to remove or reduce their agricultural \r\nsubsidies and to open up their markets to agricultural \r\nproducts from developing countries. \r\n In the area of health, efforts to reduce maternal \r\nand child mortality and to combat HIV and AIDS, \r\nmalaria and tuberculosis still fall short of targets \r\ndespite the commitments made at national and \r\ninternational levels. Over the last few years, Zimbabwe \r\nhas made great strides in the fight against the HIV and \r\nAIDS pandemic, our limited resources \r\nnotwithstanding. The country has witnessed a drop in \r\nthe adult prevalence rate from 20 per cent in 2000 to \r\n11 per cent this year.  \r\n However, we still face a major challenge in \r\nincreasing the availability of affordable antiretroviral \r\ndrugs. We therefore continue to urge the international \r\ncommunity, in cooperation with pharmaceutical \r\ncompanies, to assist in increasing access to affordable \r\nessential drugs, particularly for people in Africa. \r\nPeople living with HIV and AIDS expect delivery on \r\nthe commitments we have made.  \r\n A/64/PV.7\r\n \r\n3 09-52463 \r\n \r\n For sub-Saharan Africa, malaria presents yet \r\nanother still-formidable challenge. The commitment of \r\nthe international community and national Governments \r\ntherefore needs to be strengthened to eradicate the \r\nscourge of malaria in our part of the world. \r\n We warmly welcome the renewed enthusiasm on \r\nthe part of Russia and the United States to pursue \r\nactions to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons, and \r\nwe urge other nuclear-armed States to do the same. In \r\nthis regard, Zimbabwe is honoured to have chaired, in \r\nMay of this year, the third session of the Preparatory \r\nCommittee for the 2010 Nuclear Non-Proliferation \r\nTreaty Review Conference and takes this opportunity \r\nto thank all members for their support. We are hopeful \r\nthat, having secured agreement on the Conference \r\nagenda, members will produce a renewed commitment \r\nto the three pillars of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \r\nTreaty: nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation and \r\npeaceful use of nuclear energy. \r\n I would now like to turn to developments in my \r\ncountry. Since its formation in February this year, the \r\nInclusive Government in Zimbabwe has demonstrated \r\na conviction and unity of purpose and an unwavering \r\ncommitment to chart a new vision for the country and \r\nto improve the lives of the people in peace and \r\nharmony. In the Global Political Agreement, we have \r\ndefined our priorities as the maintenance of conditions \r\nof peace and stability, economic recovery, \r\ndevelopment, promotion of human rights and \r\nimprovement of the condition of women and children. \r\n Regrettably, while countries in the Southern \r\nAfrican Development Community (SADC) region have \r\nmade huge sacrifices and given Zimbabwe financial \r\nand other support at a time when they too are reeling \r\nfrom the effects of the global economic crisis, the \r\nWestern countries — in particular the United States \r\nand the European Union, who imposed illegal \r\nsanctions on Zimbabwe — have, to our surprise, and \r\nthat of SADC and the rest of Africa, refused to remove \r\nthe sanctions. We wonder what their motives are, and \r\nwe ask what they would want to see us do. Indeed, \r\nsome Western countries are working strenuously to \r\ndivide the parties in the Inclusive Government. If they \r\nwill not assist the Inclusive Government in \r\nrehabilitating our economy, could they please, please \r\nstop their filthy clandestine, divisive antics. Where \r\nstand their humanitarian principles, we ask, when their \r\nillegal sanctions are ruining the lives of our children? \r\n We simply call for an immediate end to the \r\ncoercive, illegal and unjustified 50-year economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo against Cuba, which \r\nis estimated to have cost Cuba a total of some \r\n$96 billion so far. My delegation joins other countries \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement that have repeatedly \r\ncondemned the use of unilateral coercive measures as a \r\nflagrant violation of the norms of international law and \r\ninternational relations, especially as they govern \r\nrelations between States under the United Nations \r\nCharter. \r\n Let me conclude by reiterating the need for \r\neffective and comprehensive multilateralism to \r\npromote a global partnership for peace and \r\ndevelopment. The United Nations and other \r\ninternational organizations that carry the legitimacy of \r\nmultilateralism should play a leading role in directing \r\nthe course of events and developments, taking into \r\naccount the interests of the majority of the \r\nOrganization’s members in an inclusive, peaceful, just, \r\nuniversal and democratic manner.  \r\n It is our hope that through our unity, solidarity, \r\ncooperation and commitment, the challenges facing the \r\ninternational community can be addressed. Let us rise \r\nto the occasion and demonstrate our political will and \r\nability to work together for the good of humanity. \r\nZimbabwe is willing and ready to play its part. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Zimbabwe for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Robert G. Mugabe, President of the Republic \r\nof Zimbabwe, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by the Honourable Marcus Stephen, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Nauru \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nRepublic of Nauru. \r\n The Honourable Marcus Stephen, President of the \r\nRepublic of Nauru, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency The Honourable Marcus \r\nStephen, President of the Republic of Nauru, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly. \r\nA/64/PV.7  \r\n \r\n09-52463 4 \r\n \r\n President Stephen: I would like to offer my \r\ncongratulations, Mr. President, on your assumption of \r\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nfourth session. Allow me also to commend your \r\npredecessor, Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann, for \r\nhis capable leadership during the sixty-third session. I \r\nassure you, Sir, of my delegation’s full support and \r\ncooperation as you lead the work of this important \r\nsession. \r\n The new millennium has been no stranger to \r\ncrisis. We have seen how ideological extremism can \r\nfoment turmoil and civil unrest in ways that do not \r\nrespect international borders. We have also learned that \r\nfinancial instability can quickly propagate through \r\nglobal markets and cause chaos in the real economy. \r\nAnd we have been repeatedly reminded that we \r\ndisrespect the natural environment at our peril. \r\n The global challenges that we face today may \r\nsometimes shock us, but they should not surprise us. \r\nMost stem from problems that have been allowed to \r\nfester and grow for many years, if not decades. All are \r\ninextricably linked to the choices made by the \r\ninternational community regarding international \r\ncommerce and development. The challenges of the new \r\nmillennium are global in nature and therefore require a \r\nglobal response. Now, more than ever, we must \r\nrevitalize our multilateral systems of governance in \r\norder to make them more responsive and more \r\nrepresentative. Large countries tend to dominate \r\ninternational forums and drown out the rest of us.  \r\n In the case of climate change and small island \r\nStates, I mean that quite literally. We must consider the \r\nimpacts of our activities and institutions on the most \r\nvulnerable, so that large and small countries alike can \r\nenjoy the stability and security necessary for \r\nsustainable economic development. In this new \r\nmillennium, even the mighty have been humbled. So \r\nwhat does that mean for a small island nation like \r\nNauru? When giants stumble, it is usually the smallest \r\nthat suffer the most serious injuries. \r\n The international community must begin this \r\nprocess of renewal by reaffirming its commitment to \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), an \r\ninitiative meant to alleviate the burdens of extreme \r\npoverty, hunger, illiteracy, inequality and disease. After \r\nearly success in the 1990s, progress towards the MDGs \r\nhas slowed throughout the world.  \r\n In the Pacific, where nearly 40 per cent of the \r\npopulation lives on less than a dollar a day, it has been \r\nno different. The reasons are not hard to identify. The \r\nAsian financial crisis was devastating for the \r\neconomies in our region. The recent spike in food and \r\nenergy prices has strained our limited financial \r\nresources. Now the global economic downturn \r\nthreatens to depress our economies even further. \r\n Additionally, the Pacific confronts a unique set of \r\nchallenges in reaching our MDGs. Our remoteness \r\nmakes it difficult to access world markets and greatly \r\nincreases the cost of doing business. Our small size \r\ndeprives us of the advantage of economies of scale, and \r\nour vulnerability to climate change places our hard-\r\nwon economic and social progress in jeopardy. Perhaps \r\nthe most vivid example of our situation is the price of a \r\nbag of rice. For most countries, the food crisis has \r\neased as commodity prices have fallen but, in Nauru, \r\nthe price of a bag of rice has increased by 80 per cent \r\nover the past year, hovering now above $60. The rest of \r\nthe world pays less than $25. \r\n The time has come for the international \r\ncommunity to deliver on its promises and to dedicate \r\n0.7 per cent of gross national income to helping \r\ndeveloping countries meet their development goals. \r\nPast recessions have led to a steep drop in levels of \r\nofficial development assistance. There will be no hope \r\nof reaching our MDGs if that happens again. \r\n It is vitally important for United Nations agencies \r\nto strengthen their engagement in the Pacific region. \r\nFor the past four years, Nauru has called upon the \r\nUnited Nations to establish a presence on the ground \r\nby opening an office in our country. It is my fervent \r\nhope that the next time that I address this body I can \r\nannounce that that commitment of the United Nations \r\nhas been fulfilled. \r\n The absence of the United Nations in the Pacific \r\nis reflected by the paucity of statistics collected in the \r\nregion. Accurate indicators are necessary for tracking \r\neconomic and social progress. It is critical for United \r\nNations agencies and other international institutions to \r\nwork more closely with our national Governments and \r\nwith regional organizations so that accurate data is \r\navailable for planning and policymaking. \r\n The temptation to add layer upon layer of new \r\nprogrammes must be avoided. We must not forget the \r\ncommitments made under the Mauritius Strategy for \r\nthe Further Implementation of the Programme of \r\n A/64/PV.7\r\n \r\n5 09-52463 \r\n \r\nAction for the Sustainable Development of Small \r\nIsland Developing States, the Monterrey Consensus, \r\nthe Paris Declaration and other international \r\nagreements. Too often, the United Nations and other \r\ndevelopment partners succeed in delivering many new \r\nreports, but fail to deliver tangible results. Action plans \r\nare no substitute for action. We must dispense with the \r\nexcuse that helping poor countries develop is \r\nsomething that we cannot afford. That is simply not \r\ntrue. Quite the opposite: in a globalized world, leaving \r\nlarge portions of the world to languish in poverty is \r\nwhat we cannot afford. \r\n The international community must also reform \r\nthe world financial system so that all developing \r\ncountries share equitably in global economic \r\nprosperity. The current economic crisis has revealed \r\ndeep flaws in our international financial system. The \r\noverriding goals of those reforms should be to facilitate \r\ngrowth in developing nations and to increase their \r\nresilience to abrupt economic fluctuations and the \r\nfickle flow of capital. \r\n While Nauru does not have a mature financial \r\nsector, shocks to the international system can be \r\ndevastating to our local economy and dry up vital \r\ndevelopment assistance. To be effective, development \r\nassistance needs to be reliable. That is not possible \r\nwithout a stable and transparent financial system. \r\n Lastly, the international community must next \r\ntake swift steps to mitigate climate change, starting \r\nwith a bold agreement in Copenhagen. Climate change \r\npresents the greatest threat for my country and many \r\nother small island developing States. Scientists warn \r\nthat, within our children’s lifetime, sea levels may rise \r\nby a metre or more. That would wipe out low-lying \r\ncoastal areas, and many Pacific islands would be a \r\ndistant memory. \r\n However, we do not need to wait for that \r\ncatastrophic scenario to see the impacts of climate \r\nchange. We live with them every day. Flooding and \r\ninundation are already eroding our shores and \r\ncontaminating our water supply. Higher water \r\ntemperatures and ocean acidification are damaging the \r\nmarine ecosystems that we depend on for food and our \r\neconomic livelihood. We pray that malaria does not \r\nfind its way to our doorstep. \r\n I applaud the commitment of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to addressing that issue and his efforts to build \r\nconsensus among world leaders this week at the high-\r\nlevel Summit on Climate Change. From Asia to Africa \r\nand the Arctic, he has visited affected regions to \r\nobserve the effects of climate change first hand, but not \r\nthe Pacific, one of the most vulnerable regions in the \r\nworld.  \r\n When the Secretary-General glances out the \r\nwindow of his aircraft while travelling between Asia \r\nand the Americas, I would ask that he remember that, \r\nin the vast expanse of water below, there is a whole \r\nregion of people living on small islands who are \r\nalready grappling with the consequences of climate \r\nchange. I encourage that his next trip be to the nations \r\nof the Pacific before they disappear. \r\n The science tells us that we must reduce the \r\nconcentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to \r\n350 parts per million or less in order to avoid the most \r\ndire climate change scenarios. However, most \r\ndeveloped countries have proposed emissions targets \r\nthat would result in concentrations far higher. \r\n That is not acceptable policy when human lives \r\nare at stake. If a doctor prescribes medicine to treat a \r\nserious illness, do we only give the patient half of what \r\nis needed? If an engineer says eight columns are \r\nnecessary to support a building, would any responsible \r\nperson recommend that we use only four? Then why \r\nare the most vulnerable countries asked to accept \r\nproposals that would surely lead to our extinction? \r\nThat is not good enough when the lives of real people \r\nfrom real places are being threatened. \r\n Developed countries must also provide the \r\nfinancial, technical and human resources necessary for \r\nus to address a problem that was not of our own \r\nmaking. Nauru joins the Alliance of Small Island States \r\nin calling for developed countries to provide the \r\nequivalent of 1 per cent of their gross domestic product \r\nfor urgent adaptation and mitigation efforts in \r\ndeveloping countries. That must be in addition to their \r\ncurrent commitments for development assistance. \r\n Climate change calls for the widest possible \r\ncooperation from every member of the international \r\ncommunity. Taiwan, as one of the world’s 20 largest \r\neconomies, can contribute in many ways and should be \r\ninvited to play a larger role in the United Nations \r\nsystem, particularly in the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change process. Taiwan has \r\nmuch to offer to vulnerable countries, especially in \r\nadaptation measures, technology transfer and \r\nfinancing. \r\nA/64/PV.7  \r\n \r\n09-52463 6 \r\n \r\n Climate change is an imminent threat to \r\ninternational security. It is therefore vital that the \r\nSecurity Council be seized of the issue and closely \r\nmonitor new developments. Special attention must be \r\npaid to the most vulnerable countries, including the \r\nsmall island developing States and least developed \r\ncountries, and also to vulnerable groups within \r\ncountries, including women and children, indigenous \r\npeople and the poor. \r\n The challenges of the new millennium can be \r\novercome only through multilateral cooperation and a \r\nrevitalized United Nations system. It is necessary for \r\nthe Security Council to be more representative in both \r\nthe permanent and non-permanent categories to reflect \r\ncurrent geopolitical realities, which is why Japan, \r\nIndia, Germany and Brazil should be made permanent \r\nmembers. I also call upon the General Assembly, as the \r\nworld’s most representative governance body, to accept \r\nTaiwan’s meaningful participation in its specialized \r\nagencies and other world forums. \r\n We have seen the power of multilateral \r\ncooperation around the world and close to home. My \r\ncountry was at the brink of economic collapse at the \r\nbeginning of this decade. In cooperation with Pacific \r\nIslands Forum member Governments, my country \r\noutlined a number of key governance and development \r\npriorities in the Pacific Regional Assistance for Nauru \r\n(PRAN) programme. It included a re-evaluation of \r\nfiscal policies and objectives, review of our \r\nConstitution, and reforms for our education and health \r\nsectors. I am proud that in just four years we have \r\nreached the goals laid out in PRAN, so much so that at \r\nthe fortieth Pacific Islands Forum Leaders’ Meeting, \r\nheld in Cairns, Australia just last month, leaders agreed \r\nthat Nauru had emerged from the crisis phase and was \r\non the path to sustainable economic recovery and \r\ndevelopment, and that PRAN was no longer required. \r\n PRAN was an excellent example of how country-\r\nfocused development aid can quickly lift a nation out \r\nof crisis and back onto the path towards sustainable \r\ndevelopment. PRAN was successful because it \r\nidentified concrete objectives and was backed by \r\nsufficient funds. Future programmes in the region \r\nshould likewise bring tangible benefits and be free \r\nfrom political influence. \r\n Here I must acknowledge and express Nauru’s \r\ndeepest appreciation to Australia, New Zealand, \r\nTaiwan, Japan and Forum island countries, our own \r\nregional organizations and others for their unwavering \r\nfunding and other forms of support to PRAN. The \r\npeople of Nauru will always remember their generosity \r\nduring our time of need. \r\n We are also grateful to the United Nations \r\nDemocracy Fund. With its assistance, Nauru recently \r\nadopted a number of important constitutional \r\namendments that will enhance good governance and \r\nbring increased stability and responsiveness to my \r\nGovernment. \r\n One of the founding fathers of the United Nations \r\nonce said, “The test of our progress is not whether we \r\nadd more to the abundance of those who have much; it \r\nis whether we provide enough for those who have too \r\nlittle”. President Roosevelt passed away before the \r\ninaugural session of the General Assembly, but those of \r\nus here today have the responsibility to see that his \r\nspirit lives on. \r\n The United Nations system of multilateral \r\ngovernance was born out of a time of great crisis and it \r\nushered in over half a century of peace and prosperity. \r\nHowever, the benefits were not shared equally, and two \r\nthirds of humanity was largely left behind. The time \r\nhas come to take up the project begun 64 years ago so \r\nthat future prosperity can be shared by all, including \r\nthe smallest and most vulnerable. The United Nations \r\ncontinues to be our best hope for creating a fairer and \r\nmore just world. \r\n God bless the Republic of Nauru, and God bless \r\nthe United Nations. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Nauru for the statement he has just made. \r\n The Honourable Marcus Stephen, President of the \r\nRepublic of Nauru, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Johnson Toribiong, President of the \r\nRepublic of Palau \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Palau. \r\n Mr. Johnson Toribiong, President of the Republic \r\nof Palau, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\n A/64/PV.7\r\n \r\n7 09-52463 \r\n \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Johnson Toribiong, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Palau, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly. \r\n President Toribiong: I am speaking for the first \r\ntime as Head of State. However, in 1977 I appeared \r\nwith my country’s delegation before the Trusteeship \r\nCouncil, seeking independence. In 1994, the \r\ntrusteeship ended and we took our place as a Member \r\nof the United Nations. Our independence is testament \r\nto the success of the International Trusteeship System, \r\nfor which we are grateful. The legacy of our experience \r\nis a Constitution that incorporates the rights and \r\nfreedoms enshrined in the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights: freedom, democracy, equal protection \r\nand the rule of law. \r\n We thank the permanent members of the Security \r\nCouncil, which recognized our sovereignty: the United \r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the \r\nFrench Republic, the Russian Federation, the People’s \r\nRepublic of China and the United States of America. \r\nThe United States was our Administering Authority, \r\nand we express our deep appreciation to it for \r\nbecoming our close partner under the Compact of Free \r\nAssociation, a relationship we cherish and one that we \r\nhope will endure. \r\n As a new and young Member, Palau has \r\nshouldered its responsibilities in the community of \r\nnations, including the deployment of peacekeepers to \r\nDarfur, Timor-Leste and the Solomon Islands. When \r\nsigning international conventions and meeting our \r\ncounter-terrorism obligations, as set forth by the \r\nSecurity Council, we remember and honour the legacy \r\nof the United Nations. \r\n While our political progress has been satisfactory \r\nsince independence, I must report to you that we are \r\nnow confronted with several looming threats to our \r\ncontinued peaceful way of life, and indeed to our very \r\nexistence. Climate change, environmental degradation \r\nand the world financial crisis are challenges that we \r\nwill only be able to overcome if we work with the \r\ninternational community. \r\n We associate ourselves with the statements of \r\nconcern on climate change which we heard in this Hall \r\nearlier this week. We applaud the commitments made \r\nand note that we must use our best efforts to stop this \r\nslow-moving tsunami that threatens to engulf us. To \r\nthis end, Palau and our neighbours in the Federated \r\nStates of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall \r\nIslands have adopted a joint policy, known as Green \r\nEnergy Micronesia (GEM) to move to renewable \r\nenergy as a pillar of our collective energy security. \r\nFurthermore, Palau has signed the Statute of the \r\nInternational Renewable Energy Agency, and we look \r\nforward to the exciting work that will emanate from the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates. We are hopeful that the \r\ncombined efforts of all our nations will lead to a \r\nfruitful outcome in Copenhagen. \r\n We note in particular the statement of the new \r\nPrime Minister of Japan, Mr. Yukio Hatoyama. Japan’s \r\nvision and commitment to save our planet are \r\ninspiring. This is one of the many reasons we support a \r\npermanent seat for Japan on the Security Council. \r\n We reiterate that climate change is indeed a \r\ncross-cutting issue and that all aspects of it, especially \r\nthe security impact of climate change, need to be \r\nexamined. This is why Palau and the Pacific Small \r\nIsland Developing States initiated General Assembly \r\nresolution 63/281, on “Climate change and its possible \r\nsecurity implications”. We look forward to meaningful \r\naction by the Security Council on that resolution. \r\n Palauans have lived throughout history in \r\nsymbiosis with the sea. Now, though, the sea, which \r\nhas long been the source of our sustenance, is \r\nsimultaneously rising in rage to destroy us and \r\nbecoming barren. This fury was caused by abuses by \r\nhumankind, and we therefore must take every \r\nnecessary action to allow the oceans to heal \r\nthemselves. In days gone by, the traditional chiefs of \r\nPalau would declare a bul — a moratorium to protect a \r\nresource that had become scarce. This traditional \r\nconcept, now popularly known as conservation, shows \r\nthe way for us to move forward. As Mahatma Gandhi \r\nsaid, “Earth provides enough to satisfy every man’s \r\nneed, but not every man’s greed”. \r\n This is why the world must declare a bul on \r\ndestructive fishing practices like deep-sea bottom \r\ntrawling, unsustainable harvesting of shark for their \r\nfins and overexploitation of tuna stocks. The odious \r\nfishing practice of bottom trawling, where a weighted \r\nnet is dragged along the sea floor, crushing nearly \r\neverything in its path, is contributing to the rapid loss \r\nof a critical ecosystem, our coral reefs. We have \r\noutlawed deep-sea bottom trawling in Palau, but, no \r\nmatter what we do in our own waters, there must be an \r\ninternational solution. For several years, we, along \r\nwith our Pacific neighbours, have advocated a \r\nA/64/PV.7  \r\n \r\n09-52463 8 \r\n \r\nmoratorium on this practice. The sustainable fisheries \r\nresolution adopted by the General Assembly in 2007 \r\n(resolution 62/177) urged nations and regional fishery \r\nmanagement organizations to stop trawling in sensitive \r\nareas by 2009. We have waited for compliance, which \r\nhas not come, and we now renew our call for a \r\nworldwide moratorium on this practice. \r\n An equally destructive fishing practice is shark-\r\nfinning. We have banned it in Palau and call upon the \r\nworld to address this issue in order to save sharks from \r\nextinction. The physical strength and beauty of sharks \r\nare a natural barometer of the health of our oceans. \r\nTherefore, I declare today that Palau will become the \r\nworld’s first national shark sanctuary, ending all \r\ncommercial shark fishing in our waters and giving a \r\nsanctuary for sharks to live and reproduce unmolested \r\nin our 237,000 square miles of ocean. We call upon all \r\nnations to join us. The need to save sharks and our \r\nenvironment far outweighs the need to enjoy a bowl of \r\nshark’s fin soup. \r\n It is anomalous that Palau is experiencing \r\neconomic difficulty while it sits in the middle of the \r\nrichest fishing grounds in the world, the Pacific Ocean. \r\nWe can no longer stand by while foreign vessels \r\nillicitly come to our waters to take our greatest \r\nresource, our tuna stocks, without regard for their \r\nconservation and without regard for adequate \r\ncompensation to the island States that own the fishing \r\ngrounds and rely on this resource. Palau believes that \r\nthe best model for a regional effort to conserve our \r\ntuna resources and maximize the benefits to us is the \r\nOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries \r\n(OPEC). I will therefore work for the establishment of \r\nOTEC, the Organization of Tuna Exporting Countries, \r\nand I now call on our friends in OPEC to come forward \r\nand help us to understand and obtain fair value from \r\nour threatened resource and to make tuna fishing \r\nsustainable. \r\n I come now to the economic crisis that my \r\ncountry is facing. As a developing nation, we are \r\ngrateful for the grants provided by our allies and \r\npartners to advance our development. They have been \r\nhelpful. \r\n Mr. Martínez Bonilla (El Salvador) Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair. \r\n But we must acknowledge that outright grants do \r\nnot always create meaningful employment. Jobs \r\ncreated are illusory and temporary. In the absence of a \r\nstrong local economy, our children, our most valuable \r\nresource, are leaving our shores for opportunities \r\nelsewhere. The continuing downward cycle created by \r\ntheir departure must be stopped, or else it will destroy \r\nthe very fabric of our society. Our allies and partners \r\ncan help us stop this cycle by promoting the \r\ndevelopment of private enterprise through investment \r\nin our country. We need capital and entrepreneurial \r\nexpertise. \r\n I implore our allies and partners to consider \r\nproviding incentives to their nationals to encourage \r\nthem to invest in our islands, to come to our islands \r\nand launch partnerships with our talented people to \r\ncreate a viable economy. Let us once and for all put \r\naside the fiction that we need handouts. What we need \r\nare partners and investment to help advance our \r\neconomy, put an end to the out-migration of our people \r\nand propel Palau towards economic self-sufficiency. \r\n We note with satisfaction the decision by the \r\nPeople’s Republic of China to invite Taiwan to attend \r\nthe World Health Assembly. The health and safety of \r\nthe world’s peoples are at the heart of the ideals of the \r\nUnited Nations. In order to further promote those \r\nideals, we recommend that Taiwan be invited to \r\nparticipate meaningfully in the International Civil \r\nAviation Organization (ICAO), the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change coming up \r\nin Copenhagen and other international organizations \r\nand forums. \r\n We have heard the voices of world leaders from \r\ncountries small and large, powerful and vulnerable. We \r\nhave heard the voice of science. Let us heed those \r\nvoices, fulfil our obligations to our people, now and in \r\nthe next generation, and work for a strong economy \r\nand a healthy planet. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly I would like to thank \r\nthe President of the Republic of Palau for the statement \r\nhe has just made. \r\n Mr. Johnson Toribiong, President of the Republic \r\nof Palau, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\n A/64/PV.7\r\n \r\n9 09-52463 \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Toomas Hendrik Ilves, President of \r\nthe Republic of Estonia \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Estonia.  \r\n Mr. Toomas Hendrik Ilves, President of the \r\nRepublic of Estonia, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Toomas Hendrik Ilves, President of the Republic of \r\nEstonia, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Ilves: Over the past year, I, like many \r\nothers in this Hall, have spoken about the effect of the \r\ncurrent global financial crisis on our people and the \r\nneed for an effective national or international response. \r\nAlthough the crisis is closely related to issues such as \r\npeace and security, human rights, development and \r\nmany other matters of common concern, we cannot let \r\nit cast a shadow over all the global challenges that we \r\ncurrently face. \r\n Today, a year after the collapse of the financial \r\nmarkets, cyclical indicators point to economic \r\nstabilization. The crisis is not over, however, and the \r\nneed to restore confidence and repair the financial \r\nsystem remains. Moreover, each of us should make an \r\neffort to refrain from raising new barriers and avoid \r\nlaying the foundations for new global imbalances in \r\nthe longer run. \r\n In combating climate change, we have finally \r\nunderstood the magnitude of our task and I would like \r\nto thank the Secretary-General for hosting the Summit \r\non Climate Change a few days ago. We are not running \r\na 100-metre sprint, but rather a marathon, where one \r\nmust maintain speed. If we manage to stay on track we \r\nall shall be winners in the end. But time is running out. \r\nMelting glaciers, frequent and abnormally large \r\nhurricanes, floods and heat waves — this is not the \r\nplanet that we want to leave to our children. \r\n Global and united efforts are needed to reach a \r\ncomprehensive and ambitious post-2012 climate \r\nagreement in Copenhagen this December. I call upon \r\nall countries to set binding goals to share the burden. \r\nResponsibility must be proportional to the harm that is \r\ncaused. I am convinced that applying the “polluter-\r\npays” principle would motivate the biggest polluters to \r\nmultiply their efforts and would therefore have the \r\ngreatest effect. \r\n Green energy production, renewable energy, \r\nenergy efficiency and diversification of energy \r\nsources — all these contribute not only to sustainable \r\nenvironmental and economic development but also to \r\nour security, as we will become less dependent on \r\nexhaustible fossil fuels. \r\n As an essential part of cutting greenhouse gas \r\nemissions, we foresee a wider use of renewable energy \r\nin Estonia, particularly biomass and wind energy. By \r\nthe end of the year, an Estonian Energy and Climate \r\nAgency will be established to help consumers cut \r\nenergy expenditures and support building energy-\r\nefficient homes. This is but one example of how an \r\nambitious climate policy can be used to trigger new \r\ngrowth in the economy. \r\n To uphold the core of the United Nations Charter, \r\nwe must remain committed to providing the United \r\nNations with sufficient resources to fulfil its unique \r\nrole in contributing to international security. \r\nCompliance with the basic principles enshrined in the \r\nCharter, including the obligation of all Members to \r\nrefrain from the threat or use of force against the \r\nterritorial integrity or political independence of any \r\nState, must remain the fundamental basis of the United \r\nNations agenda. The United Nations should remain \r\nengaged in areas of tension where it can make a \r\ncontribution. \r\n My delegation takes this opportunity to reiterate \r\nits firm support for the security and stability of \r\nGeorgia, based on full respect for the principles of \r\nindependence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. \r\n I follow with deep concern the situation in \r\nAfghanistan. It is essential that the election process \r\ndeliver results that are legitimate in the eyes of the \r\nAfghans. The future of Afghanistan lies in the hands of \r\nthe Afghan people; we, the international community, \r\ncan only help. By consolidating the efforts of the new \r\nGovernment and the international community, lasting \r\nprogress can and should be achieved. Estonia is one of \r\nthe countries that have steadily increased their military \r\nand civilian contribution to Afghanistan. \r\n I am convinced that the bolstered role and greater \r\nvisibility of the United Nations throughout the country \r\nhas a positive impact on the coordination of \r\ndevelopment activities that in turn will attract more \r\nA/64/PV.7  \r\n \r\n09-52463 10 \r\n \r\nnon-governmental organizations and other international \r\norganizations to the area. \r\n Besides conflicts between and inside States, new \r\nand asymmetrical cross-border threats have also \r\nemerged: the threat from the Internet, for example. \r\nCyber threats not only endanger vital information \r\ntechnology systems but they endanger entire \r\ncommunities. Concurrently with the rapid development \r\nof computer technology we are witnessing alarming \r\nsigns of more sinister developments: cyber attacks are \r\ngrowing more complex and are increasing in \r\nfrequency. Consequently, major cooperative efforts by \r\nboth the governmental and the private sectors are \r\nrequired to develop more effective response \r\ncapabilities. \r\n This growing global concern demands both a \r\nbetter coordinated international approach and an \r\nenhanced legal domestic framework, including steps to \r\ncriminalize malevolent cyber acts. Our long-term aim \r\nshould be the creation of a universal cyber culture — a \r\nuniversally accessible, secure and safe environment for \r\nall. \r\n Regarding humanitarian affairs, our task is \r\nequally challenging. Global ecological instability, \r\npolitical and military conflicts, combined with \r\neconomic instability and population growth, are \r\nexpected to increase humanitarian needs considerably \r\nand require that our efforts be multiplied in the future. \r\nWe must stand ready to provide a more predictable, \r\nequitable and consistently effective response to \r\nhumanitarian crises. The growing needs require an \r\nincrease in the amount of assistance, in coordination \r\nand in the range of donors. \r\n True, we all have economic concerns at the \r\nmoment, but it is vital to keep our commitments to \r\nproviding humanitarian relief. Today’s short-sighted \r\nfinancial decisions or fading political will may in the \r\nend become far more expensive and entail severe long-\r\nterm consequences. \r\n I would like to commend the excellent work done \r\nby the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian \r\nAffairs and Member States in making the coordination \r\namong humanitarian workers more efficient and \r\nimplementing the cluster system. The launch of the \r\nCentral Emergency Response Fund three years ago has \r\nalso proven a justified effort in providing more rapid \r\nand equitable response allocations to disaster-affected \r\nareas. As Estonia, together with Ireland, currently \r\nco-chairs the Good Humanitarian Donorship initiative, \r\nwe urge all donors to apply the principles of good \r\nhumanitarian donorship to make humanitarian aid more \r\nneeds-based and its financing more flexible. \r\n As a sign of the priority we give to global \r\nhumanitarian issues, Estonia this year holds a vice-\r\npresidency of the Economic and Social Council and \r\nhas been leading humanitarian discussions in that body. \r\nI am concerned that in many humanitarian situations, \r\nespecially in conflict situations, adherence to \r\nhumanitarian principles has become selective, \r\nhindering safe and timely access to victims. I fully \r\nconcur with Under-Secretary-General John Holmes \r\nthat this is not an ideological luxury but a practical \r\nnecessity to help ensure timely access as well as the \r\nsafety and security of humanitarian staff. \r\n It goes without saying that expectations are \r\nhigher during trying times, and therefore the United \r\nNations actions in carrying out its objectives have \r\nincreasingly come under scrutiny. Yet, how is the \r\nOrganization to live up to those high expectations \r\nwhen the United Nations is struggling to reform itself? \r\nOver the past years, Member States have undertaken \r\nconsiderable efforts to improve the United Nations \r\nsystem, while one important element, Security Council \r\nreform, still remains pending. While recognizing that \r\nthe reform process is complex, we must also realize \r\nthat there will be severe consequences if the process \r\nremains incomplete. \r\n Regarding another reform area — gender \r\nreform — considerable progress that is also relevant to \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals has been \r\nmade recently. No security, development or human \r\nrights-related goal can be achieved without the full \r\nparticipation of women. Estonia has been a dedicated \r\nsupporter of the United Nations funds and programmes \r\nthat foster gender equality. It is our common obligation \r\nto ensure that reform becomes a reality without delay. \r\n Facing the first financial crisis of the twenty-first \r\ncentury and the accelerating global warming process, \r\nwe see the necessity for a united response growing. \r\nThis is why we, the leaders of all nations, once again \r\nhave gathered here this week: to remind ourselves to \r\nkeep our eyes on the horizon of peace and prosperity \r\nand to make sure that we are in the same boat. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\n A/64/PV.7\r\n \r\n11 09-52463 \r\n \r\nPresident of the Republic of Estonia for the statement \r\nhe has just made. \r\n Mr. Toomas Hendrik Ilves, President of the \r\nRepublic of Estonia, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Laurent Gbagbo, President of the \r\nRepublic of Côte d’Ivoire \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Côte d’Ivoire. \r\n Mr. Laurent Gbagbo, President of the Republic of \r\nCôte d’Ivoire, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Laurent Gbagbo, President of the Republic of Côte \r\nd’Ivoire, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Gbagbo (spoke in French): As I take \r\nthe floor for the first time at the present session, allow \r\nme to join all of those who preceded me at this rostrum \r\nin congratulating Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki and telling \r\nhim how proud we are to see him presiding over the \r\nGeneral Assembly at the sixty-fourth session. His \r\nelection testifies to his personal qualities and is a \r\ntribute to the African Union.  \r\n I applaud our Secretary-General, Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon. He has kept the United Nations on track and \r\nstrengthened the United Nations in the context of the \r\nmultiple crises affecting the world. \r\n Two years ago, from this very rostrum, I updated \r\nthe Assembly on the crisis in my country, Côte \r\nd’Ivoire. At that time, I welcomed the important role \r\nplayed by regional organizations, such as the African \r\nUnion and the Economic Community of West African \r\nStates. I particularly dwelt on the internal processes \r\nthat brought us, the Government and former rebels, to \r\ncommit to a process of peace that ended the conflict \r\nand led to the current preparations for general \r\nelections. All through that process, we enjoyed from \r\nthe support of the United Nations, notably through the \r\nUnited Nations Operation in Côte d’Ivoire. We \r\nbenefited even more from the assistance of the \r\nPresident of Burkina Faso, Mr. Blaise Compaore. \r\n Thanks to the efforts of all, and particularly to the \r\nIvorians’ hard work and desire for peace, the process \r\nhas now entered into a irreversible phase. Today, there \r\nare no remaining political obstacles to the holding of \r\nthe elections. I take this opportunity to express once \r\nagain the gratitude of Côte d’Ivoire to the United \r\nNations and to all our friends for their commitment to \r\nthe restoration of peace. \r\n I would also like to share our desire to do our \r\nutmost to end the crisis via the ballot box. We are all \r\nthe more resolute given that the challenges facing \r\ntoday’s world require of all States, and in particular \r\nsmall States such as ours, a political strategy based on \r\ndemocracy. Thus armed, we will be able not only to \r\neffectively address our current difficulties, but also to \r\ncontribute to the understanding of and resolution of \r\ninternational crises. \r\n This is what President Treki has called on us to \r\ndo through the theme of this sixty-fourth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, “Effective responses to global \r\ncrises: strengthening multilateralism and dialogue \r\namong civilizations for international peace, security \r\nand development”. \r\n We note that, in addition to recurrent political \r\ncrises, the acute crises facing the world today affect the \r\nstability of nations and jeopardize our shared future. In \r\n2008, the energy crisis reached unprecedented \r\nproportions. The price of a barrel of oil, it will be \r\nrecalled, rose to nearly $150. That major crisis took \r\nplace alongside a food crisis and an unprecedented \r\nfinancial crisis that soon turned into a deep economic \r\ncrisis. The entire world woke up to the threat posed to \r\nsocial and political equilibrium by the three crises that \r\nstruck at the same time. These crises shook all our \r\ncertainties and caused a wave of panic. They showed \r\nus in no uncertain terms that nothing can ever be taken \r\nfor granted, even in big countries. \r\n The entire world mobilized to meet the challenge, \r\nboth within individual countries and within \r\ninternational institutions and organizations. We saw the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund provide assistance to \r\ncountries that are not usually the recipients of such aid, \r\nsuch as those of northern Europe. This exceptional \r\nmobilization points to the concern of the international \r\ncommunity at seeing the situation end in uncontrollable \r\nsocial and political crises. \r\n However, although the mobilization and \r\ncooperation were multilateral, the crisis resolution \r\nA/64/PV.7  \r\n \r\n09-52463 12 \r\n \r\nplans were not. Countries in North America, Europe \r\nand Asia adopted national plans. This shows that there \r\nare limits to multilateralism and that nation States \r\nprotect their prerogatives and shoulder their full \r\nresponsibilities at the economic level, when necessary. \r\n I note, moreover, that the mobilization in Africa \r\nand for Africa was quite diffident. It was as though the \r\nfinancial crisis was not also an African crisis, or as if \r\nthe financial sector in Africa was not sufficiently \r\nintegrated into the international financial system. \r\nPerhaps our continent did not grasp the full extent of \r\nthe crisis. And yet, the financial crisis has had \r\nconsequences on the African continent. In Africa, \r\nperhaps more than anywhere else, the financial crisis \r\nbecame an economic crisis that underscored the \r\neconomic and social fragility of our countries. \r\n The lesson we draw from that experience is that \r\nno country is immune to crisis. This requires the \r\ninternational community to enhance its vigilance by \r\nincreasing oversight of the financial system and its \r\ninstitutions at the international level. It would also be \r\ntimely for us to embark on a reform of the international \r\nmonetary and financial system. In this context, United \r\nNations reform, and above all reform of its organs, is \r\nessential if the United Nations is to play a solid leading \r\nrole in strengthening multilateralism.  \r\n Among the cross-cutting issues in which the \r\nUnited Nations must play a key role are the resurgence \r\nof extremism. The entrenchment and hardening of \r\npositions are prevailing over dialogue and deepening \r\nthe chasm between cultures that need to live together in \r\nharmony. Hence, the importance of the historic high-\r\nlevel meeting convened in this very Hall on 12 and \r\n13 November 2008 on the urgent need for genuine \r\ndialogue among religions with a view to creating a \r\nculture of peace. That initiative bolstered activities to \r\nraise the awareness of the international community to \r\nthe need for preventive diplomacy on this key topic, in \r\nparticular the World Conference on Dialogue, held in \r\nMadrid in July 2008, and the launching in July 2005 of \r\nthe Alliance of Civilizations, under the auspices of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n We therefore believe that all of these initiatives in \r\nfavour of dialogue among cultures, as well as those to \r\ncome, point to the need to establish a permanent forum \r\nfor dialogue among civilizations so as to draw peoples \r\ntogether. \r\n I now turn to world peace and security. The only \r\nsure way to attain lasting peace is the equitable \r\nsettlement of conflicts within a reformed, more \r\ndemocratic and more credible Security Council. \r\nTogether, we need to build a United Nations with a \r\nstronger mandate and greater representativity. \r\n In that regard, it would be preferable to entrust \r\nthe prevention, management and settlement of local \r\nconflicts to regional and even subregional \r\norganizations. That approach, which was enshrined in \r\nApril 2008 by the Security Council, should be \r\nstrengthened by an earnest updating of the mechanism \r\nfor cooperation with regional organizations, as \r\nprovided for in the United Nations Charter of 1945. \r\n In that regard, I would like to simply reiterate \r\nhere the position of my delegation, which is based on \r\nour experience of handling and settling the Ivorian \r\ncrisis. Direct dialogue, like that in Côte d’Ivoire, offers \r\navenues for thought that the United Nations could \r\nmake good use of. I think that the Burkina Faso \r\ndelegation can address that issue as well as, if not \r\nbetter than, we can.  \r\n Another topic of concern is world poverty. World \r\npeace and security are dependent on the eradication of \r\nextreme poverty and poverty reduction. That is why my \r\ndelegation welcomes the convening at the sixty-third \r\nsession of two high-level meetings on Africa’s \r\ndevelopment needs and the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. We welcome the outcomes and \r\nrecommendations of those meetings. \r\n Côte d’Ivoire is resolved to free itself of the \r\nburden of debt that is threatening its development \r\ngoals. There have been meetings on debt, but there \r\nneed to be more, and decisions must be taken on debt \r\nbecause the debts that were incurred in the 1960s, the \r\n1970s and the 1980s today hamper the development of \r\nAfrican countries. That must be considered. It is a law \r\nof nature that when a small, weak country is \r\noverburdened by debt, the original purpose of which is \r\noften not known even to its leaders, that country sinks, \r\nand drags the world down with it. Africa is part of the \r\nworld. If a decision is not taken on the issue of the debt \r\nof African countries, the entire global financial system \r\nwill be on course for disaster.  \r\n That is why I stress, alongside the problem of \r\ndebt, the issue of climate change. We talk of climate \r\nchange, and we are right to do so, but we need to take \r\ndecisions that are critical for most of our countries. I \r\n A/64/PV.7\r\n \r\n13 09-52463 \r\n \r\ndo not know the situation in West Africa very well, but \r\nit has been shown that, in Central and Southern Africa, \r\nthe deserts are advancing by two kilometres a year. \r\nWhat does that mean? It means that in 50 years the \r\ndeserts will have advanced by 100 kilometres and \r\nreached the coasts. We must decide. \r\n While the deserts advance, on the coasts villages \r\nand houses are disappearing into the sea. That is \r\nhappening in Nigeria, Benin, Togo, Ghana, Côte \r\nd’Ivoire and elsewhere. There are people living today \r\nwith the water at their feet. There are those who live \r\nnot knowing if tomorrow it will reach their houses or if \r\ntheir houses will, in fact, be in the sea. Urgent \r\nmeasures are needed. We need not only meetings, but \r\nalso decisions, and those decisions — on deserts, the \r\nsea and floods — must be implemented. Everywhere \r\ntoday — in Burkina Faso, Mali and Côte d’Ivoire — \r\nthe rains bring disaster, and those very rains that we \r\ncall for to water our farms have become a cause for \r\nalarm. We no longer know if the rains to come bring \r\ndeath or life.  \r\n Africa is fighting, and is doing so alone. It would \r\nprefer to fight with the rest of the world behind it. That \r\nis also why we have come to speak here. Africa no \r\nlonger wishes to feel abandoned or to fight alone. \r\nSoon, in 50 years according to the experts, it will be \r\neasier to find oil than clean drinking water, because we \r\nwill have to go a long way — too far for our \r\neconomies.  \r\n What are we going to do? The issue of clean \r\nwater has become a problem. Certainly, in some rich \r\noil-producing countries in the Arab world, we have \r\nseen our brothers working to make seawater drinkable, \r\nbut how many countries in the world have the means to \r\nturn seawater into drinking water? It is terribly \r\nexpensive. We need to convene a meeting here at the \r\nUnited Nations on that issue — and not only meetings, \r\nbut decisions followed by action.  \r\n Those are the problems that I came here to talk \r\nabout on behalf of the Ivorian delegation. Everyone \r\nknows that Africa is such that when one delegation \r\ntalks, it speaks for all delegations because we face the \r\nsame problems. I would hope that, as of today, we can \r\nlook beyond internal crises. We all know that Africa \r\nhas made great progress. It is up to us to strengthen \r\nourselves by daring to fight poverty, extreme poverty \r\nand catastrophic climate change. Climate change is \r\ndangerous throughout the world, but it is catastrophic \r\nfor us. We need the help of representatives to tackle \r\nthis difficult century before us. I pray that God may \r\nbless the United Nations. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Laurent Gbagbo, President of the Republic of \r\nCôte d’Ivoire, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Blaise Compaore, President of \r\nBurkina Faso \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nBurkina Faso. \r\n Mr. Blaise Compaore, President of Burkina Faso, \r\nwas escorted into the General Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Blaise Compaore, President of Burkina Faso, and \r\nto invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Compaore (spoke in French): The \r\nsixty-fourth session of the General Assembly is being \r\nheld at a time when the international community, faced \r\nwith numerous crises, is seeking ways to build a world \r\nof shared peace and development. However, although \r\nthe political and economic consequences of the current \r\nfinancial crisis affect the whole world, they are and \r\nwill continue to be more severe for African countries, \r\ngiven their fragility and the limited diversity of their \r\neconomies. \r\n Is it fair that those who have not caused this \r\ntremendous international upheaval should pay the \r\nhighest price? It certainly is not. That is why, in the \r\nface of the deep recession besetting the entire planet, it \r\nis important to bolster partnerships for development in \r\norder to correct the dysfunctions of the currently \r\nfailing global economic system. I welcome the incisive \r\nconclusions of the high-level Conference on the \r\nfinancial and economic crisis, which could lead to the \r\nestablishment of a more virtuous world government \r\nassuring sustainable development for all States. \r\n In order to relaunch growth, achieve full \r\nemployment and restore confidence, it is essential that \r\nA/64/PV.7  \r\n \r\n09-52463 14 \r\n \r\nwe adopt strict rules to regulate and manage the \r\ninternational financial system. At the same time, it will \r\nbe necessary to increase aid to developing countries in \r\norder to help achieve the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. \r\n On 1 September 2009, Burkina Faso experienced \r\nfloods that caused extensive loss of life and material \r\ndamage. I reiterate my deepest thanks to the friends \r\nand partners who have supported us in dealing with the \r\nconsequences of this natural disaster. The growing \r\nfrequency of such events all over the world is due to \r\nthe effects of climate change. We must therefore take \r\naction to address the pressing need to come up with \r\nappropriate solutions. In this regard, I welcome the \r\nmarked convergence of views and the mobilization of \r\nthe international community in connection with the \r\nissue of climate change. \r\n The fifteenth United Nations Conference on \r\nClimate Change, to be held from 7 to 18 December in \r\nCopenhagen, will offer countries a prime opportunity \r\nto take bold decisions to protect our generation and our \r\nplanet from the effects of global warming. It is to that \r\nend that Burkina Faso will host, from 9 to 11 October \r\nin Ouagadougou, the Seventh World Forum of \r\nSustainable Development in the context of climate \r\nchange. This event will allow Africa, a continent ill-\r\nequipped to resist and adapt to the consequences of \r\nclimate change, to amplify its contribution to the \r\nglobal debate on this issue. \r\n The recurring conflicts affecting the world are a \r\ngenuine threat to peace and international security, as \r\nwell as a serious obstacle to the economic and social \r\nprogress of nations. Burkina Faso wishes to express its \r\ndeep concern over the current situation in Darfur and \r\nsouthern Sudan, and reiterates its commitment to \r\nworking with the Sudanese people in their quest for \r\npeace. In that connection, Burkina Faso will dispatch a \r\nmilitary battalion to join the African Union-United \r\nNations Hybrid Operation in Darfur, as well as a \r\nformed police unit to assist in peacekeeping operations. \r\nThe support of the international community for the \r\nefforts of the Joint African Union-United Nations \r\nMediator to create conditions for productive dialogue \r\nand forge a lasting peace agreement between the \r\nprincipal parties is essential. \r\n The equally tragic situation in Somalia calls for \r\ngenuine support for the Transitional Federal \r\nGovernment so that it can definitively restore security \r\nthroughout the country and in Somali territorial waters. \r\nBurkina Faso is also following political developments \r\nin Guinea and Madagascar with particular interest. I \r\nurge the various political actors in those two countries \r\nto engage in constructive dialogue with all stakeholders \r\nto ensure a rapid return to the constitutional order. \r\n I congratulate the African Union and the \r\nsubregional organizations for the efforts they have \r\nmade to find satisfactory solutions to numerous \r\nhotspots of tension on the continent. The holding of \r\npresidential elections in Guinea-Bissau is an example \r\nof success on the part of the international community. \r\nIn particular, I encourage the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission to support the Government of Guinea-\r\nBissau in the reconstruction of the country. \r\n In Côte d’Ivoire and Togo, the political actors’ \r\ncommitment to ensuring the effective implementation \r\nof the accords to end the crises in those countries \r\naffords real reason to hope for the organization of \r\nregular and transparent presidential elections in future. \r\nI welcome the Security Council’s unflagging readiness \r\nto work with Côte d’Ivoire on implementing the \r\nOuagadougou Political Agreement, and I encourage it \r\nto continue to pursue its efforts to achieve peaceful \r\nsolutions to conflicts. \r\n In regard to the matter of Western Sahara, \r\nBurkina Faso reaffirms its endorsement of Security \r\nCouncil resolution 1813 (2008), supports the \r\nSecretary-General’s efforts to find a political solution, \r\nand considers the Moroccan initiative to negotiate \r\nautonomy for the Western Sahara to be an appropriate \r\nway to settle the disagreement.  \r\n In the Middle East, we welcome the successful \r\nconduct of elections in Lebanon and encourage that \r\ncountry to improve its relations with Syria and Israel. \r\nThe restoration of stability and prospects for \r\nnormalized relations with Lebanon’s neighbours \r\nrepresent an opportunity for calm consideration of a \r\nglobal settlement of the Palestinian question.  \r\n The contribution of the Republic of China on \r\nTaiwan to assisting the least developed countries \r\nshould be commended, and its participation in the \r\nprevious session of the World Health Assembly augurs \r\nwell for the positive evolution of this country’s \r\ncontribution to the life of the international community. \r\n For some years, the question of the proliferation \r\nof nuclear weapons, which pose an enormous threat, \r\n A/64/PV.7\r\n \r\n15 09-52463 \r\n \r\nhas divided the international community. I thank and \r\nencourage President Obama for his successful \r\norganization and leadership of the Security Council \r\nsummit on disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation. \r\nThe commitments made could lead to a denuclearized \r\nworld that is more ambitious in its exploitation of \r\nnuclear power for civil purposes and more vigilant in \r\npolicing illicit trafficking in nuclear materials. \r\n The reform of the United Nations, which has \r\nbeen on our agenda for more than a decade, calls for a \r\ncautious but determined approach, particular as regards \r\nthe Security Council. I express the hope that \r\nnegotiations will soon be undertaken regarding the fair \r\nand equitable representation of all regions of the world, \r\nthe strengthening of the effectiveness of the Council’s \r\nrole and the revitalization of the General Assembly. \r\nTrue to the ideals of the United Nations, Burkina Faso \r\nwill make its contribution to the various issues and \r\nactions under way to endow our global Organization \r\nwith the vitality and authority essential to taking on the \r\nnew challenges on the horizon. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of Burkina Faso for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n Mr. Blaise Compaore, President of Burkina Faso, \r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by General Michel Sleiman, President of the \r\nLebanese Republic \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Lebanese Republic. \r\n General Michel Sleiman, President of the \r\nLebanese Republic, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.  \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency General \r\nMichel Sleiman, President of the Lebanese Republic, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Sleiman (spoke in Arabic): I should \r\nlike at the outset to congratulate Mr. Ali Abdussalam \r\nTreki on his election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-fourth session and to express my \r\nappreciation to his predecessor, Father Miguel \r\nd’Escoto Brockmann, for his efforts. I should also like \r\nto thank in particular His Excellency the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his comprehensive \r\nannual report on the work of the Organization (A/64/1) \r\nand for the special attention that he has consistently \r\ndevoted to the concerns of Lebanon and its people. \r\n Lebanon closely follows all political, economic, \r\nsocial and legal issues on the agenda of the General \r\nAssembly, and we are hopeful and confident that we \r\nwill be elected as a non-permanent member of the \r\nSecurity Council for the period 2010-2011, with the \r\nfull support of brotherly and friendly nations in that \r\nregard. Lebanon looks forward to that election with \r\ngreat confidence, because we are a founding member \r\nof this universal international Organization and \r\ncontributed significantly to the drafting of the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights.  \r\n For thousands of years, the people of Lebanon \r\nhave made vital contributions to the development of \r\ncivilization, including innovations that have promoted \r\ncommunication, interaction and dialogue among \r\nnations and peoples. These are the same people who set \r\nsail in search of new horizons of cooperation and \r\ncommunication and have played a vital role in \r\nspreading the values of freedom and democracy, \r\nreinforcing the concept of Arab nationalism and \r\nestablishing the pillars of the intellectual and literary \r\nrenaissance of the Arab world. \r\n Today, from this rostrum, Lebanon reaffirms its \r\ncommitment to the Charter of the United Nations and \r\nto the resolutions of international legitimacy, in \r\nparticular Security Council resolution 1701 (2006), as \r\nwell as its willingness to contribute seriously and \r\nresponsibly to the deliberations and resolutions of the \r\nCouncil for the coming two years, especially those \r\naimed at ensuring peace and security in the Middle \r\nEast. Furthermore, Lebanon will give special \r\nconsideration to the deliberations on reform of the \r\nUnited Nations and its organs that will enable it to \r\nbecome more effective in addressing the challenges of \r\ntoday’s world. \r\n Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the \r\nLebanese Constitution, which was adopted in 1926, \r\ntwo decades before the United Nations was established, \r\nstipulates that “There shall be absolute freedom of \r\nconscience. The State ... shall respect all religions and \r\ncreeds and guarantees under its protection, and the free \r\nexercise of all religious rites”.  \r\nA/64/PV.7  \r\n \r\n09-52463 16 \r\n \r\n The model of coexistence embodied by Lebanon, \r\nwhich allows various confessional communities to \r\nparticipate actively in its political life in an \r\nenvironment of democracy and freedom of thought and \r\nexpression, runs counter to all trends towards ethnic or \r\nreligious cleansing and doctrines of the single-thought \r\ntheory. That is why, last year, I called for the \r\nestablishment of Lebanon as an internationally \r\nrecognized centre for dialogue among civilizations, \r\ncultures and religions, in keeping with our role as a \r\nbridge of communication between East and West and \r\nour message as a country in which 18 different \r\ncommunities interact in a unique and exemplary \r\nmanner. \r\n One of the primary tasks entrusted to the Security \r\nCouncil is to strive to maintain international peace and \r\nsecurity. Indeed, it is very unfortunate that the Arab \r\nMiddle East, a region that gave rise to the three \r\nmonotheistic religions, has been an area of tension, \r\nconflict and war ever since the Nakba, the tragedy that \r\nbefell Palestine in 1948 and displaced its people. \r\n Any settlement of the Middle East crisis must be \r\nbased on a predetermined and comprehensive plan \r\nwhose basic elements have been set out in the \r\nresolutions of international legitimacy, at the Madrid \r\nPeace Conference and in the Arab Peace Initiative. \r\nAbove all, such a settlement requires the genuine \r\npolitical will of the parties to commit themselves to \r\npeace and its obligations.  \r\n However, the Israeli side has not demonstrated \r\nsuch will, because the soundness and usefulness of a \r\njust peace are still being discussed both by the \r\nGovernment and at the grass-roots level in Israel. \r\nFurthermore, Israeli threats of attacks and wars \r\ncontinue as ways to exert control and hegemony and \r\nimpose a fait accompli, if not to bring about expansion, \r\ndisplacement and further encroachment on the rights of \r\nPalestinians and Arabs. Meanwhile, Arab countries \r\nhave together introduced a comprehensive Peace \r\nInitiative, which was unanimously adopted at the 2002 \r\nArab League Summit, held in Beirut.  \r\n It is thus essential that the international \r\ncommunity take appropriate measures to compel Israel \r\nto fulfil its international obligations under the peace \r\nprocess within a specific and reasonable time frame, in \r\naccordance with the Declaration of the recent Arab \r\nLeague Summit held in Doha, Qatar. How can we \r\npersuade our peoples that the international community \r\nis capable of achieving a just and comprehensive peace \r\nand thus of putting an end to the various aspects of the \r\nMiddle East conflict, including through an Israeli \r\nwithdrawal from all occupied Arab territories and the \r\nestablishment of an independent and sovereign \r\nPalestinian State with Al-Quds as its capital, if it \r\ncannot force Israel to halt its settlement construction, \r\nlift its unjust siege on Gaza and stop the Judaization of \r\nJerusalem? \r\n In that context, it is important to note that people \r\nhave the right to reclaim their occupied territories by \r\nall legitimate and available means, in accordance with \r\nthe provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and \r\nthe relevant United Nations resolutions. Everyone here \r\nknows how Lebanon was able to liberate most of its \r\nterritories occupied by Israel in the spring of 2000 after \r\nIsrael had refused to implement resolution 425 (1978), \r\nwhich called for its immediate and unconditional \r\nwithdrawal from all Lebanese territories. That \r\noccupation lasted 22 continuous years. \r\n Our meeting this year coincides with the sixtieth \r\nanniversary of the establishment of the United Nations \r\nRelief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the \r\nNear East (UNRWA). On this occasion, Lebanon would \r\nlike to stress that the Palestinian refugees’ solution is \r\nfirst and foremost a political solution. We fully support \r\nall efforts aimed at reinforcing the programmes and \r\ncapabilities of UNRWA, enabling it to improve the \r\nliving standards and human conditions of the refugees, \r\nin collaboration with the host countries, until a just and \r\nfinal solution to the tragedy of the Palestinians has \r\nbeen reached. \r\n Clearly, such a just and final solution for the \r\nPalestinian refugees cannot deny them their natural and \r\nlegitimate right of return to their lands and homes, nor \r\ncan it be achieved without the host countries’ \r\nparticipation or in violation of their sovereignty, their \r\nspecial circumstances and their national interests. This \r\nis why Lebanon rejects any form of settling Palestinian \r\nrefugees on its territories, for by such rejection it \r\nupholds the Palestinian refugees’ right of return, in \r\naccordance with Lebanon’s Constitution and national \r\npact. Let it be clear that such a position will not be \r\nreversed. Nor will it be subject to compromise or \r\nnegotiation. I take this opportunity to express our \r\ngratitude to the countries that have lent their support to \r\nthe Lebanese position on this issue and shown a \r\nwillingness to defend it. \r\n A/64/PV.7\r\n \r\n17 09-52463 \r\n \r\n Throughout last year, Lebanon was able to \r\nmaintain its internal stability and dismantle many \r\nIsraeli spy networks and terrorist cells while striving to \r\nimplement resolution 1701 (2006) and strengthen its \r\nrelations with brotherly and friendly countries. \r\nFurthermore, Lebanon was able to hold parliamentary \r\nelections. The world witnessed the transparency and \r\nintegrity of those elections, and the results were \r\naccepted by all competing parties. Lebanon has also \r\nbeen able to improve its credibility, avoid the aftermath \r\nof the global financial crisis, attract many tourists and \r\ninvestors, and raise its economic growth rate to almost \r\n6 per cent. It is now preparing to host the sixth \r\nFrancophone Games in a few days. \r\n While parliamentary consultations are taking \r\nplace in accordance with constitutional provisions and \r\nthe requirement to forge a national consensus, we are \r\nlooking forward to forming a national unity \r\ngovernment very soon. Such a government would \r\nreinstate government dynamics and launch the \r\npolitical, administrative and judicial reform process the \r\nLebanese people aspire to. The fruits of such a process \r\nwill serve the people and the authorities, thus ensuring \r\nits success and continuity. \r\n In parallel, and on the third anniversary of the \r\nadoption of resolution 1701 (2006), Lebanon stresses \r\nthat Israel should be forced to comply with all the \r\nprovisions of that resolution, especially its withdrawal \r\nfrom all the Lebanese occupied territories, including \r\nthe Shaba’a farms, the Kfarshouba hills and the \r\nnorthern part of the village of Ghajar, to stop its daily \r\nviolations of Lebanon’s sovereignty and its persistent \r\nthreats against Lebanon, its institutions and \r\ninfrastructure. \r\n In this context, Lebanon would like to commend \r\nthe United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) \r\nfor the role it is playing in the south of the country, in \r\naccordance with the rules of engagement agreed upon \r\nand in full coordination with the Lebanese Army. In \r\naddition, Lebanon would like to reaffirm that it \r\nremains keen to preserve the safety of this Force and \r\nreiterates its appreciation for the efforts deployed by its \r\ncommander and soldiers and for their sacrifices in the \r\nservice of peace and stability. \r\n Lebanon will pursue its international efforts to \r\nforce Israel to pay due compensation for the enormous \r\ndamage it caused through its repeated acts of \r\naggression against Lebanon, including the damage \r\ncaused by the oil slick resulting from the Israeli \r\nbombardment of the Jiyeh power plant in the summer \r\nof 2006. \r\n The experience acquired over the past 61 years \r\nhas confirmed a set of truths. First, the Palestinian \r\ncause is at the core of the Middle East conflict. \r\nSecondly, Israel’s resorting to force to impose a fait \r\naccompli is futile and will weaken neither the will nor \r\nthe determination of the Arab people to restore their \r\nrights. Thirdly, partial and unilateral solutions will not \r\nachieve genuine peace, and unjust solutions are short-\r\nlived. \r\n Since the middle of the last century, the world has \r\nwitnessed fundamental political, intellectual and \r\nideological shifts that have had a profound impact on \r\nnations and their interactions, along with a troubling \r\naccumulation of economic, social and environmental \r\npredicaments. No matter how local or regional some \r\nconflicts and crises have been in the past, in the current \r\nera of globalization they have become global in nature \r\nor acquired a global dimension. Such has been the case \r\nfor the phenomenon of international terrorism, the \r\nglobal financial crisis and the contagious diseases that \r\nare spreading across continents. \r\n In ancient times, and now in the modern world, as \r\ntold in the fiercest epic tales, wars beget tragic and \r\npainful events and give rise to costly and horrific \r\nexperiences where endless blood and countless tears \r\nare shed and disappointment and tragedies prevail. We \r\ntherefore hope that the United Nations, which from the \r\noutset was established to prevent wars and resolve \r\nconflicts through peaceful means, will persist in its \r\nendeavour to achieve righteousness and establish \r\njustice through active and unbiased international \r\nefforts. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Lebanese Republic for the statement \r\nhe has just made. \r\n General Michel Sleiman, President of the \r\nLebanese Republic, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.  \r\n \r\nA/64/PV.7  \r\n \r\n09-52463 18 \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, \r\nPresident of the Transitional Federal Government of \r\nthe Somali Republic  \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Transitional Federal Government of the Somali \r\nRepublic. \r\n Mr. Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, President of the \r\nTransitional Federal Government of the Somali \r\nRepublic, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, President of the \r\nTransitional Federal Government of the Somali \r\nRepublic, and to invite him to address the Assembly.  \r\n President Ahmed (spoke in Arabic): I would like \r\nto begin by congratulating Mr. Ali Treki on his election \r\nas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth \r\nsession. We are confident that the international \r\ncommunity will greatly benefit from his experience \r\nand wisdom on the political and human fronts, and at \r\nthe local and international levels. I also take this \r\nopportunity warmly to thank the Secretary-General and \r\nall Governments, international organizations and \r\npermanent members who have offered support and \r\nhave promoted peace and stability in Somalia, and who \r\nhave delivered to our country the aid necessary to \r\nprotect our sovereignty, territorial integrity and unity.  \r\n I wish to express our condolences to the families \r\nof those who have lost their lives in defence of peace \r\nand stability in Somalia. I would particularly like to \r\nthank the African Union, which has made tremendous \r\nsacrifices for the cause of peace in Somalia.  \r\n I would now like to talk about the efforts and \r\nprogress made by the Government of Somalia since it \r\ncame to power through the Djibouti peace process — \r\nprogress made despite the enormous difficulties and \r\nchallenges facing the Somali nation, particularly given \r\nthat it was established after 18 years of anarchy and \r\nchaos. My Government’s priorities include improving \r\nthe security situation, promoting efforts towards \r\nreconciliation and providing essential humanitarian \r\nassistance to the displaced and the suffering in our \r\ncountry.  \r\n Unfortunately, however, the rebels are \r\nendeavouring to overthrow the Somali Government, \r\nwhich is still taking its first steps in achieving security. \r\nThese rebel elements have conducted a violent \r\ninsurrection against the Government, fuelled by the \r\nnegative effects and consequences of the past 18 years, \r\nwhich are further compounded by prevailing high \r\nunemployment and our country’s weakness in the field \r\nof security. It is clear that extremist foreign elements \r\nhave joined the ranks of the insurgency and some of \r\nthese foreign extremists hold key rebel leadership \r\npositions. \r\n I would like to recall that we thwarted the \r\nattempted coup d’état perpetrated by the rebels against \r\nthe Government. We believe that we were able to \r\nprevail thanks, first and foremost, to God, and then \r\nthrough the efforts of our Government and people and \r\nthe help we received from the international community \r\nand the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM). \r\nWe are currently endeavouring to promote and bolster \r\nthe Somali security forces, to create new naval forces \r\nand a new coast guard to tackle the problem of piracy, \r\nwhich continues to threaten international shipping in \r\nthe Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean. However, \r\ndespite all our achievements we still have a long road \r\nto travel.  \r\n Rebellion in Somalia is a new form of insurgency \r\nthat is emerging in the world today. This rebellion is \r\nconducted by foreign and Somali extremists who are \r\nagainst Islam, against peace, against security and \r\nagainst stability. They are spoilers who sow destruction \r\nand take exploit the chaos and anarchy that have \r\nexisted in Somalia since 1991.  \r\n We suggest that what is happening in Somalia \r\nshould not be underestimated or taken lightly. The \r\ninternational community should take prompt and \r\ndecisive steps to ensure that our people are not held \r\nhostage by these extremist groups who are working \r\nagainst our freedom and our destiny. From this rostrum \r\nI would like to state that if the world does not \r\ncomprehend the gravity of what is happening in \r\nSomalia, then the consequences will be very harmful. \r\nThe troubles we are experiencing threaten to proliferate \r\ninto neighbouring countries and indeed throughout the \r\nworld.  \r\n The problem of international terrorism is not \r\nconfined to Somalia and this problem should be \r\naddressed at the international level.  \r\n A/64/PV.7\r\n \r\n19 09-52463 \r\n \r\n I turn now to the issue of piracy, which has \r\nrecently become a matter of major concern for the \r\ninternational community. The phenomenon of piracy is \r\nclosely linked to the current security situation in \r\nSomalia. As a result, as long as the security situation in \r\nSomalia remains unchanged, piracy will continue in \r\none way or another. We would like to say, however, \r\nthat there has of late been a reduction of piracy as a \r\nresult of collective international endeavours. Still, it \r\nremains essential to make additional efforts to combat \r\npiracy. \r\n Toxic waste sunk off the Somali coast, unlawful \r\nfishing and the pillaging of national wealth are a \r\nviolation of Somali sovereignty and cause considerable \r\ndamage, which has a negative effect on the \r\nenvironment through the pollution caused.  \r\n We are resolved to engage in a political dialogue \r\nthat is open to all Somali stakeholders, including the \r\narmed rebels.  \r\n We are determined to sit down at the negotiating \r\ntable with all parties, even those who are against the \r\nGovernment, any time and any place, in order to end \r\nthe conflict raging in our country. We will spare no \r\neffort to end the conflict and find a lasting political \r\nsolution. We will ensure the security of our people and \r\nprotect our sovereignty and territorial integrity. \r\nHowever, the extremists do not believe in the benefit of \r\nany manner of dialogue or negotiation; they believe \r\nonly in guns and cannons.  \r\n We are ready to establish a firm foundation for an \r\nopen, transparent and participatory democratic political \r\nsystem by creating sound democratic institutions that \r\nreflect the collective political will and the cultural \r\nvalues of the Somali people. That system will be based \r\non an institutional regime and constitutional \r\nmechanisms designed to protect human rights and the \r\nrule of law. \r\n Similarly, we will foster genuine Islamic \r\nprinciples that encourage tolerance, personal freedoms, \r\nrespect for individual rights and equal rights for all \r\nunder the law, without regard to gender, clan or ethnic \r\norigin. \r\n In addition, we will work tirelessly towards \r\nestablishing a free-market economic system to attract \r\nforeign direct investment and encourage private \r\nownership. The system we will introduce will have \r\nsound and effective financial institutions with strong \r\nbuilt-in anti-corruption mechanisms. \r\n We will use all available means to rebuild a \r\nnational Somali State that is at peace with itself, with \r\nits neighbours and with the international community. \r\nFurthermore, we intend to cooperate closely with the \r\ninternational community in the security sphere. \r\n At this trying moment in history, Somalia \r\nurgently needs the support and assistance of the \r\ninternational community, in particular in the form of \r\nsecurity and humanitarian aid. Since 1991, Somalia has \r\nnot enjoyed peace, stability or security. Thus, it has \r\nbeen difficult to achieve social and economic \r\ndevelopment and to protect human rights.  \r\n Security and stability may be established if \r\ncertain essential measures are taken, including \r\npromotion of the security and police components, the \r\njudiciary and administrative institutions. African Union \r\ntroops should be increased to a necessary level and \r\naugmented by other troops, provided that they are \r\nsufficiently funded, trained and equipped to carry out \r\ntheir task. In order to restore security in Somalia, those \r\nmeasures must be implemented decisively and as soon \r\nas possible. \r\n Mr. Sangqu (South Africa), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n In the context of humanitarian assistance, it must \r\nbe emphasized that the situation of refugees, both \r\nwithin Somalia and outside its borders, continues to \r\ndeteriorate. There are nearly 3.8 million people in the \r\ncountry requiring humanitarian assistance. Our people \r\nare experiencing a real humanitarian tragedy that is \r\ncompounded by several years of drought. Humanitarian \r\naccess to those in need is considerably hampered by \r\nthe security situation that has deteriorated as a result of \r\nthe conflict. \r\n In connection with Security Council resolutions \r\non the arms embargo, I urge the Council to reconsider \r\nthe matter and appeal to it to assist us in strengthening \r\nour security forces without which any endeavour to \r\nrebuild infrastructure and achieve security and stability \r\nin Somalia will be impossible. \r\n On the donors conference held in Brussels in \r\nApril 2009 pursuant to Security Council resolution \r\n1863 (2009), we wish to ask donor countries which \r\nhave made funds available to Somalia to speed up the \r\nallocation of additional funding. I also urge United \r\nA/64/PV.7  \r\n \r\n09-52463 20 \r\n \r\nNations Member States and Security Council members \r\nto take further measures to support the Republic of \r\nSomalia more effectively in order to end the \r\nintransigence of the extremists and to ensure that no \r\nfurther obstacles exist to rehabilitating Somalia and \r\nrebuilding its infrastructure so that we can bring an end \r\nto the genuine daily tragedy of the people in Somalia. \r\n We firmly believe that our progress on security is \r\nlikely to enable us to counter the negative economic \r\nand social impacts of the chaotic events of the past \r\n18 years. Somalia would be in a position to revive the \r\nentrepreneurial spirit of the people of Somalia. We \r\nhave already begun to make tangible progress with \r\nremittances from Somalis abroad. If Somalia enjoyed \r\nsome level of stability and security our economy could \r\nprogress reasonably in the coming years. In any event, \r\npeace, stability and development are all interlinked; \r\nthere can be no peace without development or \r\ndevelopment without peace and stability.  \r\n The worldwide economic decline has severely \r\naffected the people of Somalia and has placed an \r\nadditional burden on their shoulders. From this \r\nrostrum, we reiterate our appeal for joint, urgent action \r\nfor Somalia. I stand before the Assembly fully \r\nconfident in the future of Somalia. It is a country with \r\nvast natural and human resources. We believe and we \r\nare confident that, with support, we will be able to \r\nmake genuine and concrete progress. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the \r\nTransitional Federal Government of the Somali \r\nRepublic for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, President of the \r\nTransitional Federal Government of the Somali \r\nRepublic, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Gjorge Ivanov, President of the \r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia. \r\n Mr. Gjorge Ivanov, President of the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, was escorted \r\ninto the General Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Gjorge Ivanov, President \r\nof the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Ivanov (spoke in Macedonian; English \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): I have the \r\nspecial honour and privilege today to address this \r\nesteemed forum and to share with you the views of the \r\nRepublic of Macedonia regarding the topics of this \r\nsession, but also on other current issues that concern us \r\nall, directly or indirectly. \r\n At the outset, I would like to convey my \r\ncongratulations and to greet the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fourth session, Mr. Ali \r\nAbdussalam Treki. I would also like to extend to him \r\nour full readiness for cooperation in the course of his \r\nmandate. At the same time, I wish to congratulate the \r\nPresident of the Assembly at its sixty-third session, \r\nMr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann, for his successful \r\npresidency. Availing myself of this opportunity, I \r\nwould like to acknowledge the engagements and the \r\nefforts of the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \r\nwhich indisputably have contributed to the \r\nenhancement of the role and reputation of the \r\nOrganization. \r\n Before I refer to the key theme of this session, I \r\nwould like to remind the Assembly of the fear and \r\nuncertainty we all felt exactly one year ago, right here. \r\nIt was fear and uncertainty over the scope and the \r\nconsequences of the global financial and economic \r\ncrisis. I recall this in order to emphasize the urgent \r\nneed for the United Nations to use this opportunity to \r\ncontribute to processes that will facilitate the \r\novercoming of the effects of the crisis. It is even more \r\nimportant that we assist in preventing new such crises. \r\nIn this context the serious economic problems most of \r\nus have been facing should not shift our focus from the \r\nabsolute priority, which is the implementation of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. \r\n The issue of climate change, which today \r\nrepresents one of the biggest challenges facing \r\nhumanity, is extremely high on our national agenda, \r\nbut also on that of the United Nations. We owe it to our \r\nchildren and to the generations to come to preserve our \r\nplanet. If we do not establish, urgently and \r\nimmediately, the highest and most sustainable \r\nstandards for how we treat the environment, we will \r\npay the price in the future. Time is running out, and \r\nthere is no possibility for us to further postpone \r\n A/64/PV.7\r\n \r\n21 09-52463 \r\n \r\ncoordinated and serious measures to combat the \r\nnegative consequences of climate change. Climate \r\nchange and global warming have an increasingly \r\nserious impact on economic growth and on the quality, \r\nquantity and price of food. That exacerbates poverty. It \r\nis therefore imperative that we tackle this issue \r\nimmediately.  \r\n The Republic of Macedonia, as a party to the \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change for more \r\nthan a decade now, has been actively working on \r\nimplementing the goals set out in the Convention. We \r\nhave — including me personally — assigned special \r\nsignificance to the forthcoming United Nations Climate \r\nChange Conference in Copenhagen, and we all have \r\ngreat expectations for it. The Macedonian authorities \r\nare truly committed to undertaking numerous concrete \r\nactivities with a view to raising awareness in society \r\nregarding this issue. The Republic of Macedonia is \r\nfully prepared to make its contribution to the global \r\neffort. \r\n When we address issues related to peacekeeping \r\nand stability, a large majority of us, unfortunately, \r\nregularly expresses dissatisfaction regarding the \r\ncurrent state of affairs. Peace and security are \r\ncompromised on a daily basis in certain regions of the \r\nworld. We are faced with the continuation of old and \r\nfrozen conflicts, but also with a series of new tensions \r\nin many regions throughout the world. \r\n When it comes to the reasons for the constant \r\ncrises besetting our world, or certain parts of it, allow \r\nme to seize this opportunity to quote Martin Luther \r\nKing, who in 1967 uttered a recipe for overcoming \r\nbilateral, regional and global crises. He said:  \r\n “Let us be dissatisfied until from every city hall, \r\njustice will roll down like waters, and \r\nrighteousness like a mighty stream. Let us be \r\ndissatisfied until that day when the lion and the \r\nlamb shall lie down together, and every man will \r\nsit under his own vine and fig tree, and none shall \r\nbe afraid.” \r\n With reference to these words, I welcome the \r\ntopic of this session, which is meant to assist us in \r\nfinding effective responses to global crises. The \r\nresponses to most questions must take into \r\nconsideration not only the present and the reality of \r\ntoday’s world, but on top of that, we must anticipate \r\nthe future and take on board the objectives we have set \r\nourselves. \r\n Instead of paying lip service to multilateralism, \r\nwhich I do not believe will help, a real approach based \r\non meaningful multilateralism and action is required. \r\nThe Republic of Macedonia and I personally strongly \r\nbelieve in and strive towards effective multilateralism. \r\nWe believe that strengthening multilateralism is the \r\nonly way to advance towards and achieve our primary \r\ngoals of peace, democracy, human freedoms and rights \r\nand respect of international law and principles. \r\n The Republic of Macedonia strongly supports \r\njoint efforts to improve the overall coherence of the \r\nUnited Nations system. We need a United Nations that \r\nwill, in the best possible and most efficient manner, \r\nrealize the expectations and the objectives of its \r\nMember States. \r\n The Republic of Macedonia is a country that has \r\nimmense experience in nurturing and affirming \r\ndialogue and in advancing dialogue among \r\ncivilizations. It is a unique example of a successful \r\nmulti-ethnic and multi-faith country. \r\n The summit on Dialogue Among Civilizations \r\nthat was held in the Republic of Macedonia, in Ohrid \r\nin 2003, with assistance and support from the United \r\nNations, is an example of the kind of regular annual \r\nmeetings at the highest level that are being held in \r\nSouth-East Europe under the auspices of UNESCO. \r\nThis not only represents recognition for my country but \r\nalso demonstrates the value of dialogue in the \r\nadvancement of security and in development. \r\n Since its independence, the Republic of \r\nMacedonia has been unswervingly committed to the \r\npromotion of democracy and the improvement of the \r\nliving standards of its people, and to reform in all \r\nspheres of our economy. The Republic of Macedonia \r\npromotes a society founded upon the rule of law, \r\nrespect for human rights, multi-ethnic cohabitation, \r\ndialogue and mutual understanding.  \r\n Over the past number of years, the Republic of \r\nMacedonia has achieved impressive progress that has \r\nbeen recognized and acknowledged by all. My country \r\ntoday is looking forward to the initiation of the \r\naccession negotiations with the European Union. My \r\ncountry has fulfilled all of the conditions set for NATO \r\nmembership. It is an active and strong supporter of \r\nregional cooperation. It remains fully committed to \r\ngood-neighbourly relations and to dialogue as a key \r\ntool for overcoming all of the issues that continue to \r\nbeset the region. \r\nA/64/PV.7  \r\n \r\n09-52463 22 \r\n \r\n All of my country’s Governments have consistently \r\nfocused on the realization of the country’s two top \r\nstrategic priorities: accession to the European Union \r\nand accession to NATO. The Republic of Macedonia is \r\ndedicated to sharing and contributing to the \r\nEuro-Atlantic values in a common vision for the \r\nenlargement of the stability and security zone in South-\r\nEast Europe.  \r\n The actions of our southern neighbour that \r\nprevented the Republic of Macedonia from acceding to \r\nthe NATO alliance were contrary to the obligations \r\nundertaken in the 1995 interim agreement. That was \r\ndone in an attempt to influence the outcome of the \r\nnegotiations held under the auspices of the United \r\nNations and was completely opposite to the common \r\nvision. Nevertheless, I would like to stress before this \r\nforum that the Republic of Macedonia is sincerely \r\ndedicated to the process of resolving our differences \r\nwith our southern neighbour within the framework of \r\nthe mechanism set out in United Nations resolutions.  \r\n The Republic of Macedonia believes in law and \r\nin justice. The Republic of Macedonia believes in the \r\nInternational Court of Justice as a body of the United \r\nNations and as a protector and upholder of the law. \r\nBeyond the absurdity of the dispute with our southern \r\nneighbour, the Republic of Macedonia sincerely hopes \r\nthat soon the only obstacle that prevents us from taking \r\nour rightful place in the Euro-Atlantic family will be \r\nremoved.  \r\n In spite of the flagrant violation of international \r\nobligations by our southern neighbour — in respect \r\nwhereof the Republic of Macedonia has filed an appeal \r\nat the International Court of Justice — we are actively \r\nparticipating in the negotiation process with the \r\nRepublic of Greece. I would like to state clearly that \r\nwe are prepared to discuss only the issues foreseen in \r\nthe United Nations resolutions. The Republic of \r\nMacedonia is prepared to seek a solution that is a \r\nreasonable and fair compromise and that will not touch \r\nupon or deny our national, cultural or linguistic \r\nidentity in any way, a solution that would obtain the \r\nlegitimacy and the seal of approval of our citizens. \r\nThere is no more sovereign right than the right of self-\r\ndetermination and self-identification. That right has \r\nbeen cherished by many generations before us. \r\n I hope that the Republic of Greece will abandon \r\nits policy of taking action from a position of power in \r\norder to unfavourably influence the outcome of the \r\ndisputed issue. I expect that the political leadership \r\nwill look towards the wider interest in terms of \r\npermanent stabilization of the entire region. We believe \r\nthat with truthful and sincere willingness and \r\npreparedness we can reach a solution whereby there \r\nwill be neither winners nor losers. \r\n Allow me to take this opportunity to recall \r\nArticle 1, paragraph 2 of the Charter of the United \r\nNations:  \r\n “[t]o develop friendly relations among nations \r\nbased on respect for the principle of equal rights \r\nand self-determination of peoples, and to take \r\nother appropriate measures to strengthen \r\nuniversal peace”. \r\n Let not this Organization betray the expectations \r\nof the vast majority of people who set their hope on it, \r\nand let it not betray the ideals of its founders. The \r\nOrganization must prepare itself to come up with \r\nresponses to existing and emerging challenges posed \r\nby our times. When I say “the Organization”, I refer to \r\nall of us who support those processes. The Republic of \r\nMacedonia sees in the Organization the potential to \r\nmaintain stability in international affairs and a unique \r\nopportunity to tackle the numerous challenges posed to \r\nhumanity. The Republic of Macedonia, as has been the \r\ncase hitherto, shall continue to respect and support the \r\nvalues and principles enshrined in the Charter. \r\n Allow me to finish my address with the words of \r\nthe former Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan, who \r\nsaid that if the goal of humanity is progress in peace \r\nand freedom, the state of peace is not only a state free \r\nof conflict, it is a state of respecting human freedom \r\nand rights. We are still far from that goal. However, \r\nindisputably, huge and serious progress has been \r\nachieved. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia for the statement he \r\nhas just made. \r\n Mr. Gjorge Ivanov, President of the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, was escorted \r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\n A/64/PV.7\r\n \r\n23 09-52463 \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Nicholas Joseph Orville Liverpool, \r\nPresident of the Commonwealth of Dominica \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Commonwealth \r\nof Dominica. \r\n Mr. Nicholas Joseph Orville Liverpool, President \r\nof the Commonwealth of Dominica, was escorted \r\ninto the General Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Nicholas Joseph Orville \r\nLiverpool, President of the Commonwealth of \r\nDominica, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Liverpool: I begin by joining my \r\ncolleague Heads of State in congratulating Mr. Ali \r\nTreki on his well-deserved election as the President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. I \r\nwould also like to take this opportunity to thank His \r\nExcellency Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann for his \r\neffective stewardship of the sixty-third session and to \r\nsalute Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his tireless \r\nefforts to promote global peace, security and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n It is an internationally accepted fact that we are in \r\na period characterized by unprecedented crisis. Crises \r\nrelated to basic human needs such as food, water and \r\nenergy are contributing to great distress and hardship \r\nin every region of our world and precipitating an \r\nescalation in poverty, which we in the United Nations \r\nhad committed to halve at the beginning of this decade. \r\nThese crises have the potential to bring great social and \r\npolitical instability to many regions.  \r\n The sheer complexity of these matters and their \r\nconnectivity with human development make the task of \r\naddressing them very daunting. The progress made by \r\nthe international community in this respect must be \r\nnoted. However, we must all be mindful that whatever \r\nthe perceived impact or fallout experienced by the \r\neconomies of the world, the citizens of the small \r\nvulnerable States among us will be the worst hit, and \r\ntherefore they continue to warrant the special attention \r\nof this body. \r\n The United Nations Conference on the World \r\nFinancial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on \r\nDevelopment, which convened last June in this Hall, \r\nbrought renewed international attention to the \r\nmagnitude of this crisis. The outcome document \r\n(resolution 63/303, annex) confirmed, and further \r\nemphasizes, that the crisis has had a particularly \r\nnegative effect on developing countries such as \r\nDominica.  \r\n The irony is that though severely affected by the \r\ncrisis, our countries had absolutely no relationship or \r\ncontribution to its cause. It also threatens the \r\nrealization of the Millennium Development goals. In \r\nthe Caribbean it is estimated that the impact of the \r\ncrisis has created the worst set of economic \r\ncircumstances since the era of independence of the \r\ncountries of the region, bringing with it depressed \r\ncommodity prices, a decline in agricultural export \r\nearnings, contraction of tourism revenues, retreating \r\nforeign direct investment, decreased access to external \r\nfinancing and declining remittances, among others. \r\n At the regional level the Governments of the \r\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) are addressing the \r\nimpacts of the crisis through the establishment in July \r\nof a task force that will allow the member States, along \r\nwith the heads of our regional financial institutions, to \r\nfacilitate the mobilization of funds and present a core \r\nset of proposals for dealing with this crisis. Our Heads \r\nof Government have also agreed to the institution of a \r\nprogramme of collective enhancement of our financial \r\nservices sector through improved national regulatory \r\nand supervisory systems, and also through \r\nrationalization and consolidation to ensure safety, \r\nsoundness and stability in that sector.  \r\n We concur with the call for the strengthening of \r\ninstitutional arrangements for international cooperation \r\nin tax matters. Furthermore, we endorse the \r\nrecommendation of the Conference of the CARICOM \r\nHeads of State for consistent and non-discriminatory \r\nimplementation of transparency requirements and \r\ninternational standards for exchange of information. \r\n We believe that in order to adapt to the adverse \r\nimpact of the financial crisis it is crucial that small \r\nisland developing States and less developed countries \r\nreceive the following: one, speedy implementation of \r\nthe decisions of the Conference; two, assistance to \r\nfacilitate economic diversification while responding to \r\nthe crisis and the negative impact of climate change; \r\nthree, fiscal support in view of already high debt \r\nburdens; four, practical assistance from United Nations \r\nagencies through a compact framework; and five, \r\nstimulus funds to be made available by bilateral and \r\nmultilateral entities. \r\nA/64/PV.7  \r\n \r\n09-52463 24 \r\n \r\n With the onset of the financial crisis, there is now \r\na wrong perception that the food crisis is over. Food \r\ninsecurity continues unabated around the world, and it \r\nis estimated that more than a billion people go to bed \r\nhungry every night. This is both unacceptable and \r\nunsustainable. The creation of the United Nations \r\nsystem high-level Task Force on Global Food Security \r\nwas a timely and welcome initiative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the Director-General of the Food and \r\nAgriculture Organization. Increasing investments in \r\nagriculture in the developing nations is critical to \r\naddressing the food crisis. We therefore welcome the \r\nGroup of Eight pledge of $15 billion over the next \r\nthree years for enhancing food security, but we warn \r\nthat the desired objective may not be achieved if \r\nharmful subsidies in agriculture continue to prevail in \r\nthe developed countries. \r\n Completion of the Doha Development Agenda \r\nnegotiations at the World Trade Organization takes on \r\nrenewed importance as we seek solutions to the global \r\nfinancial crisis. An appropriate trade environment for a \r\nsustainable recovery for all is highly desirable. It is in \r\nthat spirit that we must renew our commitment to \r\nre-engage in the Doha negotiations with the declared \r\nobjective of concluding them in 2010.  \r\n The status quo has served only to further \r\nmarginalize small and vulnerable States and has led to \r\nthe almost total collapse of some of our major \r\nindustries, including sugar and bananas, which \r\nprovided the livelihoods of numerous farming families \r\nand communities. Our Governments continue the \r\nstruggle to develop their economies in the absence of \r\nthe much-needed foreign exchange that those industries \r\ngenerated. Increasing the competitiveness of \r\ndeveloping countries and their effective participation in \r\nworld trade underscores that Aid for Trade as a new \r\nand independent source of development financing must \r\nbe at the centre of the trade and development agenda. \r\n Climate change has emerged as one of the leading \r\nchallenges of our generation. If it is not arrested and \r\nsufficiently managed, its adverse impact has the \r\npotential to undermine human security and the social \r\nand economic stability of all nations. All around us we \r\nsee evidence of escalating climate change in the form \r\nof severe weather, floods, drought, devastating \r\nhurricanes and cyclones and rising sea levels.  \r\n Small island developing States are most \r\nvulnerable to the negative impact of climate change. As \r\na consequence, we find our countries in the front line \r\nof this monumental challenge to humanity. In \r\nDominica and several of the sister islands of the \r\nCaribbean, situated as we are in the hurricane belt, \r\nthere have been and will continue to be an almost \r\nannual cycle of considerable damage to houses, roads, \r\ncoastlines and other infrastructure. For many of our \r\ncountries there is a constant struggle to achieve \r\neconomic development and a higher quality of life for \r\nour people, only to find ourselves experiencing these \r\nheavy losses and having routinely to start all over \r\nagain.  \r\n As global preparations for the critical \r\nCopenhagen conference continue, the urgency to act to \r\naddress climate change has increased. What has long \r\nbeen pointed out by the scientists has now been \r\nconfirmed by those whose unsustainable production \r\nhas precipitated an Earth crisis, which must be \r\naddressed if our planet is to survive. The General \r\nAssembly, in its resolution 63/281 of 3 June this year, \r\nrecognized the security implications of climate change \r\nas an additional dimension of the crisis. That is clearly \r\nevident for many small island States whose viability \r\nand very existence are threatened by conditions such as \r\nthe rising sea levels. \r\n Dominica is at the forefront of nature \r\nconservation. Upon attaining political independence in \r\n1978, our country was aptly dubbed the “Nature Island \r\nof the Caribbean” in view of our unwavering \r\ncommitment to the management and conservation of \r\nour abundant biodiversity, extensive national parks \r\nsystem, rich forest resources, mountain ranges, fresh \r\nwater resources and a pure marine environment. At the \r\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development held in \r\nJohannesburg in September 2002, the then Prime \r\nMinister of Dominica, the Honourable Pierre Charles, \r\nproclaimed our country as the “Nature Island of the \r\nWorld”. Today in the presence of the world gathering \r\nin this body, I announce Dominica’s intention to make \r\nour country a model for sustainable development. A \r\ncordial invitation is extended to the international \r\ncommunity to contribute to this noble venture. \r\n Dominica continues to work closely within the \r\nframework of small island States to continue to bring \r\nour perspective, as climate change front-line States, to \r\nthe negotiating table. We are contributing to a solution \r\nto the effects of climate change by pursuing measures \r\nat the national level to promote energy efficiency, \r\nreduce the consumption of fossil fuels and develop our \r\n A/64/PV.7\r\n \r\n25 09-52463 \r\n \r\ngeothermal potential for national energy needs, as well \r\nas for the possible export of clean energy to our \r\nneighbours, in the first instance to the French overseas \r\nDepartments of Guadeloupe and Martinique.  \r\n Dominica is already generating 40 per cent of its \r\nelectricity by hydropower. We are at an advanced stage \r\nof geothermal energy development, which by 2015 \r\nshould enable us to reach the target of 100 per cent \r\nelectricity generation by renewable energy. We express \r\nour gratitude to France and the European Union for \r\ntheir commendable cooperation towards the shift to \r\nrenewable energy. \r\n Dominica is therefore encouraged by the many \r\nexpressions of support for a successful outcome of the \r\nCopenhagen meeting made by world leaders at the \r\nhigh-level Summit on Climate Change held a few days \r\nago in this Hall. There is an urgent need for a greater \r\ndemonstration of political will in this regard. I \r\ntherefore urge every Head of State or Government to \r\nseize the moment to reach an agreement that will \r\nprotect the inhabitants of this planet from one of the \r\nmost serious challenges ever to confront humanity. \r\n Dominica remains concerned about the current \r\neconomic situation in our sister island of Haiti. We \r\nrecognize the important role of the United Nations \r\nStabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) in \r\nensuring the stability of that country. We commend all \r\ntroop-contributing States for their engagement in Haiti, \r\nand we appreciate the support of the Security Council \r\nin extending the mandate of the Mission. Haiti needs \r\nconsiderable development assistance in order to \r\nconsolidate the stability that MINUSTAH’s presence \r\nhas fostered and to ensure the success of the \r\npeacebuilding process. In this regard, we endorse and \r\napplaud the decision of the Secretary-General to \r\nappoint former United States President Clinton as \r\nSpecial Envoy for Haiti. We hope that this appointment \r\nwill advance the cause of rebuilding that country. \r\nDominica, through its actions and also through \r\nCARICOM, will continue to do all in its power to \r\nadvance the quality of life of the Haitian people. \r\n Central to my country’s development thrust is a \r\nparticular focus on the advancement of our indigenous \r\npeople. Consistent with this priority of the United \r\nNations, we support the continued and expanded \r\nefforts of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues in \r\nthe implementation of the measures contained in its \r\nrecommendations. In this connection, we welcome the \r\nrecommendations of the eighth session of the \r\nPermanent Forum on indigenous women, the economic \r\ndevelopment and human rights of indigenous peoples, \r\nand specific actions in relation to the Arctic region. \r\nDominica has undertaken and continues to undertake \r\nimportant initiatives to improve the social development \r\nof our indigenous people. \r\n We come together every year in the general \r\ndebate in a true spirit of common resolve and \r\npartnership. This common resolve and partnership must \r\nassume greater meaning this year because the tasks \r\nbefore the international community are enormous and \r\nnecessitate collective action. However challenging may \r\nbe the efforts towards their solution, it seems evident \r\nthat only genuine global cooperation and concerted \r\nmultilateral action have the possibility of yielding \r\nfavourable results. But committed multilateral action in \r\nthe face of these crises has so far proved to be elusive. \r\nA greater demonstration of political will should ensure \r\nmultilateral action in confronting these crises, as it is \r\nan absolute necessity for the survival of this planet. \r\n I take this opportunity to recognize all the \r\ncountries and organizations that have assisted \r\nDominica and the more vulnerable States in our \r\ndevelopment thrust. Particular reference must be made \r\nto those developing countries which, while dealing \r\nwith their own domestic challenges, have extended a \r\ntrue fraternal hand of friendship. To all, we express our \r\nmost sincere gratitude. We also reiterate the call of this \r\nGeneral Assembly for an end of the United States \r\nembargo against the Republic of Cuba and look \r\nforward to an early date for its removal. \r\n Finally, as we chart a most progressive \r\ndevelopment course for our future, we should ensure \r\nthat it includes the full implementation of the \r\nrecommendations emanating from the Conference on \r\nthe World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its \r\nImpact on Development. We should also make every \r\neffort to leave Copenhagen with a framework for a firm \r\ncommitment and a sound climate agreement that will \r\nprotect the inhabitants of this planet, particularly the \r\nmost vulnerable, from one of the most serious \r\nchallenges ever to confront humanity. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the \r\nCommonwealth of Dominica for the statement he has \r\njust made. \r\nA/64/PV.7  \r\n \r\n09-52463 26 \r\n \r\n Mr. Nicholas Joseph Orville Liverpool, President \r\nof the Commonwealth of Dominica, was escorted \r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Anote Tong, President of the \r\nRepublic of Kiribati \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nKiribati. \r\n Mr. Anote Tong, President of the Republic of \r\nKiribati, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Anote Tong, President of \r\nthe Republic of Kiribati, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly. \r\n President Tong: I am indeed honoured to address \r\nthis body on behalf of the people of Kiribati, but let me \r\nstart by congratulating Mr. Ali Treki on his assumption \r\nof the presidency of the General Assembly at this \r\nsession. The tasks ahead of him and indeed ahead of us \r\nall are challenging. I am confident, however, that with \r\ncooperative efforts and commitment from all of us and \r\nwith the President’s able leadership of this session, we \r\nshould be able to rise to the challenge before us. I also \r\ntake the opportunity to thank the President’s \r\npredecessor, Mr. D’Escoto Brockmann, for his \r\ncommendable leadership during the previous session. \r\n Every year, we gather in this Hall to deliberate on \r\nthe daunting challenges that continue to confront us as \r\ncitizens of the international community. We gather as \r\nleaders to find solutions to these challenges that will \r\nensure the survival of humanity not just today but \r\ntomorrow and beyond. \r\n Climate change is indeed the greatest moral \r\nchallenge to humanity in our time, and I fear that our \r\nchildren and grandchildren will look back and ask us \r\nthe question: “How is it that they knew what they knew \r\nyet they did so little?” We simply cannot afford the \r\nconsequences of inaction. The people of my country \r\nare already feeling the impacts of climate change, \r\nwhich will only worsen over time. We, together with \r\nthose of other low-lying States, will become victims of \r\nclimate change. \r\n I have been advocating a combination of \r\npragmatic adaptation strategies for my people. It is our \r\noverwhelming desire to maintain our homeland and our \r\nsovereignty. However, with the inevitable decline in \r\nthe ability of our islands to support life — let alone \r\nincreasing populations — due to rising sea levels, we \r\nmust also provide opportunities for those of our people \r\nwho wish to migrate to be able to do so on merit and \r\nwith dignity. Our approaches will be time-relevant, \r\nresponding to the different levels of threat and impacts \r\nof climate change on our islands and our people as \r\ntime goes by.  \r\n We expect greenhouse gas emitters to take \r\nappropriate action to mitigate these negative effects. \r\nWe ask for assistance with our adaptation efforts and \r\nwe ask those who might need our labour to be able to \r\nopen their doors. It is important to stress that these \r\noptions are not mutually exclusive. \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n Our relocation strategy requires the support of the \r\ninternational community. On previous occasions, I \r\nhave referred to existing initiatives with our regional \r\ndevelopment partners, and I wish to say again that I am \r\ngrateful to the Governments of New Zealand and \r\nAustralia for their support through the Pacific Access \r\nCategory scheme, the Kiribati Australia Nursing \r\nInitiative and the Australia-Pacific Technical College \r\nprogramme. These are models that we believe can be \r\nimplemented more broadly as a win-win option for all \r\nconcerned. Pacific leaders have agreed to work \r\ntogether to address climate change through the 2008 \r\nNiue Declaration on Climate Change.  \r\n Internationally, the declaration adopted by \r\nAlliance of Small Island States leaders a few days ago \r\noutlines the issues of importance to small island \r\ndeveloping States and calls for action on climate \r\nchange, particularly leading up to Copenhagen. \r\nResolution 63/281 on climate change and its possible \r\nsecurity implications is a landmark decision of the \r\nGeneral Assembly that acknowledges the link between \r\nclimate change and security. I commend our Pacific \r\nambassadors in New York for initiating and driving \r\nthat resolution, and I thank the sponsors for their \r\nsupport. \r\n I appreciate that reaching consensus in \r\nCopenhagen will not be an easy task, but I do believe \r\nthat it is possible and that it is imperative that we do \r\nso. If we can mobilize trillions of dollars to address the \r\nchallenges of the global economic crisis, then we must \r\nbe equally capable of taking the action necessary to \r\n A/64/PV.7\r\n \r\n27 09-52463 \r\n \r\ndeal with the challenges of the global environment. \r\nOver the past few days, I have been deeply heartened \r\nto see leaders’ strong commitment to tackling this \r\ncommon challenge together, to hear leaders resolve to \r\nlook beyond national interests and focus on the global \r\ninterest, and by their understanding of the predicament \r\nof those on the front line of climate change.  \r\n To be able to see leaders’ strong determination to \r\nseal the deal in Copenhagen — a deal that, among \r\nother things, will address the plight of the most \r\nvulnerable — has given me hope and restored my faith \r\nin humanity and in the relevance of our global \r\ncommunity and our global leadership. I take this \r\nopportunity to strongly commend the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his initiative in organizing the high-level \r\nSummit on Climate Change. That Summit provided us \r\nwith the opportunity as leaders to talk face to face and \r\nto agree on a way forward for the climate change \r\nnegotiations. I also thank my fellow leaders for their \r\nunderstanding, compassion and political will \r\ncollectively to address this crisis and its impacts. \r\n It is now absolutely necessary that we capitalize \r\non this collective political will. We must direct our \r\nnegotiators to act accordingly to ensure that our \r\ncommon resolve as leaders is in fact given effect. I \r\nknow that we will not be able to agree on all issues, but \r\nat the same time I am sure there are some fundamental \r\nissues that we cannot afford not to agree on. Let us not \r\nwaste any more time on diplomatic talk, language, \r\ndrafting of amendments, posturing and empty \r\nplatitudes. We know what needs to be done. It has been \r\ncalled many things — a new world order, the grand \r\nbargain, a new green deal — but Copenhagen gives us \r\nthe opportunity to enter into a global compact for \r\naction on climate change between developed and \r\ndeveloping countries, North and South, East and West. \r\nThis might be our last chance. If we do not act now, \r\nwho the hell is going to do it? \r\n We have declared the Phoenix Islands Protected \r\nArea (PIPA), the largest marine protected area in the \r\nworld, covering more than 400,000 square kilometres \r\nof ocean area. It constitutes something like 11 per cent \r\nof our exclusive economic zone. PIPA is a collective \r\npartnership between my Government, Conservation \r\nInternational and New England Aquarium. The \r\npreservation of the Phoenix Islands and the \r\nsurrounding ocean is our gift, our statement to \r\nhumanity, in the face of climate change. It is our \r\ncontribution to international efforts to significantly \r\nreduce biodiversity loss by the year 2010. Even now as \r\nwe confront the possibility that our islands will become \r\nuninhabitable within this century due to rising sea \r\nlevels, we recognize the value of protecting something \r\nthat we firmly believe to be the common heritage of all \r\nmankind. \r\n We are indeed encouraged to see the emergence \r\nof ocean conservation and management initiatives in \r\nthe Pacific. Such initiatives include the Micronesia \r\nChallenge, the Coral Triangle Initiative and the Nauru \r\nAgreement. Kiribati and the Pacific are committed to \r\nthe sustainable conservation and management of its \r\noceans. At the Pacific Islands Forum in Australia last \r\nmonth, the leaders of the Pacific adopted the Pacific \r\nOceanscape initiative, aimed at promoting \r\ncollaboration and exchanges between marine protected \r\nareas in the region and with other partners. We call for \r\nsupport for this initiative from the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n The impacts of the climate crisis, the \r\ninternational financial crisis and the food and energy \r\ncrisis have ended our efforts to achieve sustainable \r\ndevelopment and our way forward towards achieving \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. The particular \r\neconomic and environment vulnerability of Kiribati as \r\na small island developing State should be taken into \r\naccount when considering us for graduation from least \r\ndeveloped country status. Assistance provided to the \r\nleast developed countries helps us at this point in time \r\nin our efforts to address challenges we face as a nation. \r\nTo lose that assistance would be detrimental to our \r\nefforts and to the livelihood of our people. We reiterate \r\nour call to the United Nations to reconsider the listing \r\nfor the graduation of Kiribati and other countries in the \r\nPacific. \r\n On the issue of global governance, the United \r\nNations is undergoing change to adapt to the realities \r\nof our time. It must maintain its relevance if it is to \r\naddress the security challenges that the world continues \r\nto face. We believe that the United Nations should be \r\nan inclusive Organization, particularly for States such \r\nas Taiwan that make a contribution to world harmony \r\nand have demonstrated time and again their willingness \r\nand ability to contribute positively to international \r\ncooperative efforts. Taiwan has demonstrated its \r\ncommitment to international peace and security \r\nthrough its contributions to national, regional and \r\ninternational development programmes. It is only fair \r\nand fitting, therefore, that Taiwan should be allowed to \r\nA/64/PV.7  \r\n \r\n09-52463 28 \r\n \r\nparticipate meaningfully in meetings and activities of \r\nthe United Nations organs. Given the impact of climate \r\nchange and the demands of aviation safety and security \r\non its development and the well-being of its people, we \r\nnow appeal for the meaningful participation of Taiwan \r\nin the work and activities of the International Civil \r\nAviation Organization and the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change. \r\n In concluding, in the face of the common \r\nchallenges facing the global community, it is \r\nencouraging to hear leaders call for a new global order \r\nin which our interests as fellow citizens of the planet \r\noverride our national interests, particularly where \r\nglobal human security and lives are under serious \r\nthreat. This goal reaffirms the principle of collective \r\nresponsibility for the common challenges that we face.  \r\n The United Nations will and must continue to \r\nplay a significant role in the new world order, \r\nparticularly in mobilizing the political will and the \r\nnecessary action and resources required to implement \r\nit. Copenhagen will be the test of the political will and \r\ncommitment that we have declared over the past few \r\ndays as leaders. It will determine the fate of the most \r\nvulnerable and eventually the whole of humanity.  \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Kiribati for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Anote Tong, President of the Republic of \r\nKiribati, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Asif Ali Zardari, President of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Pakistan \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Islamic Republic of \r\nPakistan. \r\n Mr. Asif Ali Zardari, President of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Pakistan, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Asif Ali Zardari, President \r\nof the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly. \r\n President Zardari: I am honoured to return to \r\nthis chamber of hope, peace and cooperation. I wish to \r\nconvey the warm greetings of the people of Pakistan. \r\nWe are delighted to see you, Mr. President, presiding \r\nover the General Assembly. The high ideals of the \r\nUnited Nations have inspired our vision of a global \r\nsociety that is based on peace and justice, freedom and \r\nhuman rights, equality and equal opportunity, freedom \r\nfrom want and hunger, tolerance and harmony — a \r\nglobal society that believes in the sovereign equality of \r\nnations large and small, and that promotes truth and \r\nreconciliation. \r\n On behalf of the people of Pakistan, I assure you, \r\nMr. President, of our cooperation in fashioning a safer \r\nand better world in which all children — yours and \r\nmine — shall live in peace and harmony. This is a \r\nworld in which we shall all depend on one another. It \r\ndemands a return to the path of the United Nations. It \r\ncalls for reforming the United Nations on the principles \r\nof equality and consensus building. \r\n In Pakistan, the will of the people has prevailed. \r\nOur people have witnessed a profound democratic \r\ntransformation. We have entered a new era of \r\ndemocracy, the rule of law and human rights. \r\nDemocracy in Pakistan is of great importance not only \r\nto our country, but also to our region and the world. \r\nPakistan has struggled hard for democracy. My late \r\nwife, Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, led the fight \r\nfor democracy and laid down her life for it. Following \r\nin the footsteps of her great father, Shaheed Zulfikar \r\nAli Bhutto, she made the ultimate sacrifice so that our \r\nnation might live in democracy. We are now following \r\nin her footsteps. I, my party, my people and Pakistan’s \r\ndemocracy are grateful to the international community \r\nand to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for constituting \r\nan international commission of investigation into her \r\nassassination. We are confident that the commission \r\nwill bring out all the dimensions of her life, work and \r\ntragic assassination. \r\n The world supports our struggle for democracy, \r\nand we are grateful for that support. Democracy in \r\nPakistan is beginning to achieve successes in the fight \r\nagainst militancy. The real challenge now is to make \r\ndemocracy sustainable, and indeed irreversible. This \r\nrequires that democracy should be able to deliver. It \r\nshould meet the aspirations of our people to progress \r\nand prosperity. It must give our people peace and \r\nstability. \r\n Unfortunately, our neighbourhood has witnessed \r\ndecades of conflict. Pakistan has suffered greatly from \r\n A/64/PV.7\r\n \r\n29 09-52463 \r\n \r\nterrorism and religious extremism. Terrorism and \r\nextremism were not previously known to our society \r\nand culture. Religious extremism entered our society \r\nand the region when we all in the free world decided to \r\nconfront a rival ideology. The policy was based on the \r\nexploitation of religion to motivate Muslims around the \r\nworld to wage jihad. It was a policy whereby jihadi \r\nleaders were referred to as the moral equivalents of \r\nGeorge Washington. It was a policy that allowed \r\nwarlords and criminals to destroy civilizations to come. \r\nThe virus multiplied and has affected the world.  \r\n To eliminate militancy we must strike at its roots. \r\nSurgery alone will not be enough. We need to address \r\nthe causes of deprivation, poverty and illiteracy. We \r\nneed to adopt dialogue, development and a wise use of \r\nforce as our strategy. \r\n Pakistan has firmly responded to the challenges \r\nof extremism and militancy. Democracy has given our \r\npeople ownership of the fight against terrorism. Today, \r\nour nation stands fully united in this struggle. Our law \r\nenforcement agencies have, within a short span of \r\ntime, cleared a large area in Malakand of militants. Of \r\nthe more than 2.5 million civilians who were forced to \r\nleave their homes, about 2 million were hosted by their \r\nrelatives and friends. I salute the host families. \r\nDemocracy and political ownership of the war have \r\nproved to be the chief weapons in the fight against \r\nmilitancy. In the short span of 10 weeks, most of the \r\ninternally dislocated have returned to their homes. We \r\nare now engaged in rebuilding their lives.  \r\n Pakistan appreciates the international community’s \r\nsupport and understanding of our efforts. We urge the \r\ninternational community to further reinforce this \r\nsupport. We are determined to eliminate terrorism and \r\nextremism from our territory. To that end, the early \r\nreturn of peace and stability in Afghanistan is critical. \r\nThe flow of weapons across the region must stop. The \r\nfunding and support to militants by drug barons and \r\nother elements must stop.  \r\n We also believe that regional cooperation against \r\nterrorism and extremism holds great promise. We \r\nemphasize regional efforts for peace and stability. \r\nPakistan will continue to work with Afghanistan and \r\nthe international community for the early restoration of \r\npeace and stability in that country. Pakistan has hosted \r\nalmost 3 million Afghan refugees for the past three \r\ndecades. We have been providing for them on our own. \r\nWe call upon the world to help in the safe return of the \r\nrefugees to their homes.  \r\n Pakistan’s democracy has begun to deliver. We \r\nare doing more in self-interest. We urge the world’s \r\ndemocracies to do more for the peace and development \r\nof the people affected by militancy and terror. We need \r\nto create economic opportunities for our people. We \r\nurge our friends and partners to help Pakistan by \r\nproviding market access for the economic revival and \r\nwell-being of their own people.  \r\n Pakistan desires friendly relations with India. We \r\nbelieve that dialogue is the only way forward. The \r\nabsence of dialogue leads to tensions that must be \r\navoided. We look forward to the resumption of the \r\ncomposite dialogue process. We seek a peaceful \r\nresolution of all outstanding issues with India. \r\nMeaningful progress towards a resolution of the \r\nKashmir dispute is necessary for durable peace and \r\nstability in South Asia. \r\n Pakistan also supports the rights of the \r\nPalestinian people as guaranteed in several United \r\nNations resolutions. Durable peace in the Middle East \r\nrequires that the issue of Palestine be addressed \r\nmeaningfully.  \r\n We also call for the immediate release of Aung \r\nSan Suu Kyi. \r\n All nations seek security. Peace and security are \r\nclosely linked. Equal security for all is important. We \r\nsupport all efforts for arms control, disarmament and \r\nnon-proliferation. The principle of equal security is of \r\nfundamental importance for achieving those objectives. \r\nImbalances in security, especially at the regional level, \r\nneed to be redressed. Pakistan will continue to play a \r\nconstructive role in promoting conflict resolution and \r\nrestraint in South Asia and in promoting initiatives on \r\nnuclear disarmament and non-proliferation on the basis \r\nof non-discrimination. \r\n Pakistan’s priority is economic development. We \r\nwish to build on our internal strengths. In this effort we \r\nseek partnerships. We seek to develop a win-win \r\nsituation. We are engaged in economic revival by \r\ndeveloping our agriculture, building mega-hydro \r\nprojects, initiating water conservation projects, \r\nundertaking infrastructure projects, promoting regional \r\ntrade and cooperation and encouraging, beyond \r\nGovernment, the corporate sector in development. We \r\nA/64/PV.7  \r\n \r\n09-52463 30 \r\n \r\nneed to develop a framework for cooperation that will \r\ndeliver quickly. \r\n In overcoming the challenges faced by the world, \r\nthe United Nations has a central role to play. Guided by \r\nits principles and the high ideals in its Charter, the \r\nUnited Nations is destined to succeed. A democratic \r\nPakistan will continue to uphold the ideals and values \r\nof the United Nations. Together we shall succeed. In \r\nthe words of my leader and martyred wife Shaheed \r\nMohtarma Benazir Bhutto, “time, justice and the forces \r\nof history are on our side”. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the statement he \r\nhas just made, and also to offer our condolences on the \r\ndemise of the late Ms. Benazir Bhutto. \r\n Mr. Asif Ali Zardari, President of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Pakistan, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear a statement by the Chairman of the \r\nExecutive Committee of the Palestine Liberation \r\nOrganization and President of the Palestinian \r\nAuthority. \r\n Mr. Abbas (Palestine) (spoke in Arabic): I \r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly. I wish you every \r\nsuccess in your noble mission and recognize your long \r\nexperience in international political affairs. I also \r\nextend our greetings and thanks to former President, \r\nHis Excellency Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann, \r\nwhose positions and active efforts reflected the spirit \r\nand principles of this international organization, which \r\nis headed by His Excellency Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon, whom I also salute. I express our \r\nappreciation for everything he has done personally and \r\nthrough the organs and agencies of the United Nations, \r\nnotably the United Nations Relief and Works Agency \r\nfor Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), to \r\nassist the Palestinian people and defend their rights.  \r\n During this session we have a full agenda before \r\nus. The peoples of the whole world are looking to this \r\nbody to determine what can be done to save our planet \r\nfrom the effects of climate change and global warming \r\nand to address the world financial crisis. Many \r\ncountries, including small and developing countries, \r\nsee the need to reform the United Nations, including \r\nthe Security Council, so as to reflect the reality of the \r\ncurrent international situation and to ensure more \r\ncomprehensive representation of the international \r\ncommunity.  \r\n These common concerns must not overshadow \r\nthe fact that serious problems face the Middle East \r\nregion in particular, first and foremost the lack of \r\ncommitment to the Charter of the United Nations and \r\nthe extent to which the resolutions of the General \r\nAssembly and the Security Council are actually being \r\nimplemented without the application of double \r\nstandards. Everyone agrees on the need to achieve \r\npeace in the Middle East, to counter extremism and \r\nviolence, and to establish the region as a zone free of \r\nnuclear weapons and other weapons of mass \r\ndestruction. Yet the larger wound and deeper tragedy \r\nremains the suffering of our Palestinian people since \r\nthe Nakba — the catastrophe — more than 60 years \r\nago, to which the United Nations is a living witness. Its \r\narchives contain not dozens but hundreds of resolutions \r\nthat have not been implemented. \r\n The suffering of the Palestinian people as a result \r\nof Israel’s settler occupation is crystal clear to the \r\nworld. Since the occupation of the West Bank and the \r\nGaza Strip, including East Jerusalem, in 1967, Israel \r\nhas continued with its settlement policy on all \r\nPalestinian land, especially in holy Jerusalem, where \r\nthat policy is being accelerated and escalated by many \r\nmeans, including the seizure of the homes of \r\nPalestinians in the city, the imposition of restrictions, \r\neven preventing Palestinians from building and \r\nsometimes from repairing their homes while new \r\nsettlement neighbourhoods are established. Jerusalem \r\nis becoming completely isolated from its surroundings \r\nbecause of the illegal settlements and the apartheid \r\nwall. \r\n We now face a unique situation. If international \r\nlaw stipulates the inadmissibility of the acquisition of \r\nthe territory of others by force, how can we then deal \r\nwith the current situation where Israeli settlement \r\npolicies are undermining the goal of establishing a \r\ngeographically contiguous Palestinian State in \r\nimplementation of the will of the international \r\nconsensus? That consensus is reflected in the many \r\nresolutions and principles, including the Road Map, \r\nwhich we all agreed upon and which is based on the \r\n A/64/PV.7\r\n \r\n31 09-52463 \r\n \r\nprinciple of land for peace and on an end to the \r\noccupation that began in 1967. \r\n Immense efforts have been exerted and many \r\nconferences have been held over the years, particularly \r\nsince the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993. Yet all \r\nof this has not led to an end to the conflict. President \r\nBarack Obama gave much hope to our people and the \r\npeoples of the region when he announced his vision for \r\na peace agreement on the basis of a two-State solution \r\nand the cessation of all settlement activities. We \r\nwelcomed the active American diplomacy to revive the \r\npeace process and all efforts of the international \r\nQuartet and its members: the United Nations, the \r\nEuropean Union, the Russian Federation and the \r\nUnited States.  \r\n All these active efforts and initiatives, which \r\nhave been welcomed and supported by us and by the \r\nArab States, are however confronted by the \r\nintransigence of Israel, which refuses to adhere to the \r\nrequirements for relaunching the peace process. How is \r\nit conceivable that negotiations can be held on the \r\nborders and on Jerusalem while Israeli bulldozers are \r\nworking to change the reality on the ground with the \r\naim of creating a new reality and imposing the borders \r\nthat Israel desires? How can one conceive of holding \r\nnegotiations without agreement on the terms of \r\nreference and the objective of those negotiations, \r\nwhich the whole world has unanimously agreed upon, \r\nnamely ending the Israeli occupation of the territories \r\noccupied in 1967, establishing the State of Palestine, \r\nwith Jerusalem as its capital, reaching a just and agreed \r\nupon solution to the question of Palestinian refugees on \r\nthe basis of resolution 194 (III) of 1948, and achieving \r\npeace on all the Palestinian, Syrian and Lebanese \r\ntracks, as affirmed in the Arab Peace Initiative, which \r\nprovides a precious opportunity that must be seized to \r\nachieve peace? \r\n In this regard, I should like to express our deep \r\nappreciation of the important speech delivered to the \r\nAssembly by President Obama two days ago (see \r\nA/64/PV.3), in which he affirmed the necessity of \r\nending the occupation that began in 1967 and the \r\nillegitimacy of the settlements. He also stressed the \r\nneed to establish an independent, sovereign and viable \r\nPalestinian State and to address all the final-status \r\nissues in the negotiations, foremost among these \r\nJerusalem, refugees, borders, water and settlements, \r\nalong with others. We reiterate that adherence to these \r\nprinciples, in addition to a complete freeze on all \r\nsettlement activities, can salvage the peace process and \r\nopen horizons for its success. \r\n I reaffirm the eagerness of the Palestine \r\nLiberation Organization to achieve a just, lasting and \r\ncomprehensive peace in accordance with the \r\nresolutions of international legitimacy. At the same \r\ntime, I caution that the settlement policy and the \r\nbuilding of the separation wall, which continue to be \r\npursued by the Israeli occupation, will abort \r\nopportunities to relaunch the peace process. Time is \r\nrunning out and the risks are becoming greater as a \r\nresult of the continued suffering of the Palestinian \r\npeople under the last remaining occupation in the \r\nworld.  \r\n We call upon the international community to \r\nuphold international law and international legitimacy \r\nand to exert pressure on Israel to cease its settlement \r\nactivities, to comply with the agreements it has signed, \r\nto cease its policies of occupation and colonial \r\nsettlement, to release the approximately 11,000 \r\nprisoners and detainees and to lift the unjust siege \r\nimposed on the Gaza Strip, which was subjected \r\nmonths ago to devastating aggression claiming \r\nthousands of civilian casualties among and causing \r\nunprecedented destruction of infrastructure and public \r\nfacilities, including hospitals, mosques, schools and \r\neven United Nations facilities. \r\n Our people, which continues to demand its rights \r\nand to be determined to remain in its homeland despite \r\nall of the suffering caused by the detentions, the \r\nblockade and the killings, is also keen to end internal \r\ndivision and to restore national unity. Our sister, Egypt, \r\nis making commendable efforts to achieve that goal.  \r\n In spite of all our suffering from the occupation \r\nand its practices, we continue to work to build and \r\ndevelop our national institutions. We have made \r\nsignificant progress in this regard both in upholding the \r\nrule of law and public order and in promoting \r\neconomic and social development, despite the harsh \r\nconditions of the occupation and the blockade. We \r\ncontinue to make every possible effort for the success \r\nof the efforts of our brothers in Egypt to end the \r\nongoing coup in the Gaza Strip and to restore our \r\nnational unity by resorting to the ballot box and \r\nholding presidential and legislative elections on their \r\nconstitutional date under the supervision and control of \r\nArab and Islamic countries, the United Nations and the \r\nA/64/PV.7  \r\n \r\n09-52463 32 \r\n \r\ninternational community. In that way, democracy will \r\nbe firmly institutionalized in our political life. \r\n Hope will remain alive in our souls and we will \r\nnot despair of regaining our rights on the basis of \r\nrelevant resolutions of the United Nations, the historic \r\nrole of which we reaffirm for attaining peace and \r\nupholding the principle of “might for right” and not \r\n“right for might”.  \r\n From this rostrum, I conclude by reaffirming our \r\ncommitment to the Road Map, the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative and to all terms of reference of the political \r\nprocess. We call upon all parties to respect and abide \r\nby them to provide the opportunity to launch a \r\nsuccessful and effective peace process. We are \r\nconfident that all our brothers in sisterly Arab countries \r\nwill adhere to the Arab Peace Initiative as a basis for \r\nsafeguarding our rights and opening the way towards \r\ngenuine peaceful relations with Israel once the \r\noccupation is ended and the independent State of \r\nPalestine is established. \r\n \r\nAddress by The Honourable Winston Baldwin \r\nSpencer, Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Antigua and Barbuda \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Antigua and Barbuda. \r\n The Honourable Winston Baldwin Spencer, Prime \r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nAntigua and Barbuda, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum. \r\n The President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Winston Baldwin \r\nSpencer, Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Antigua and Barbuda, and inviting him to \r\naddress the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Spencer (Antigua and Barbuda): On behalf \r\nof my Government and the people of Antigua and \r\nBarbuda, I congratulate you, Sir, on your election to \r\npreside over the sixty-fourth session of the General \r\nAssembly and wish you every success during your \r\ntenure. I also extend heartfelt congratulations to \r\nMr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann on his visionary and \r\ninspiring leadership over the past year. \r\n  “We are all members of one body. The \r\nwelfare of the weakest and the welfare of the \r\nmost powerful are inseparably bound together. \r\nIndustry cannot flourish if labour languish. \r\nTransportation cannot prosper if manufactures \r\ndecline. The general welfare cannot be provided \r\nfor in any one act, but it is well to remember that \r\nthe benefit of one is the benefit of all, and the \r\nneglect of one is the neglect of all.” \r\n Those words are taken from a 1914 speech by \r\nCalvin Coolidge. However, as we gather as a \r\ncommunity of nations almost a century later, they are \r\njust as timely. Our common humanity is being tested \r\nby the worst economic crisis since the Great \r\nDepression. Additional challenges that currently \r\nconfront us include the increased incidence and impact \r\nof pandemic diseases, worsening poverty and hunger \r\nthat trap millions around the globe, the adverse \r\nconsequences of climate change, tensions over peace \r\nand security, and increasing environmental \r\ndegradation. When history is recorded, our success as \r\nleaders will be determined by our stewardship during \r\nthese turbulent times. \r\n Years ago in much warmer and gentler climes, \r\nsmall island nations like our twin island nation of \r\nAntigua and Barbuda convened a global conference \r\nentitled “Small Islands, Big Issues”. Today, we remain \r\nsmall islands, but the issues with which we grapple are \r\ngargantuan. In many cases, they have been exacerbated \r\nby ill-conceived or ineffective interventions and \r\nstructures. None among us is immune to the financial \r\ninsecurity brought about by global banking \r\nmismanagement and fraud. At the same time, global \r\nclimate change threatens to overwhelm the very fabric \r\nof our small nations. \r\n It has been said that the rising tide of \r\nglobalization floats all boats on a sea of economic \r\nopportunities. What is now clear is that such tides can \r\nturn into an economic tsunami that, in one swift wave, \r\ncan wash away development gains that took decades to \r\nbe realized. That is the situation in which Antigua and \r\nBarbuda now finds itself. An unwelcome visitor in the \r\nform of this global economic crisis has thrust itself \r\nupon our pristine shores and is threatening to wreak \r\nuntold damage on our economies.  \r\n Thus, while some members of our community of \r\nnations have begun to tout faint but hopeful signs of \r\nrecovery, prudence dictates that we pay heed to the \r\nwords of Calvin Coolidge and acknowledge that it \r\nsimply is not an option to adopt an insular approach in \r\nresponding to this global crisis. The stronger \r\n A/64/PV.7\r\n \r\n33 09-52463 \r\n \r\neconomies must remain ever cognizant of the fact that \r\nthe welfare of the weakest and the welfare of the most \r\npowerful are inseparably bound together. \r\n In responding to the crisis, all parties must admit \r\nthat the old methodologies, as reflected in the \r\nWashington Consensus and similar models, are \r\nobsolete. As we actively pursue the creation of new \r\nstructures and strategies, Antigua and Barbuda \r\nencourages the community of nations to explore \r\nalternative models, such as that represented by the \r\nBolivarian Alternative for the Americas (ALBA). With \r\nits foundation principles of complementarity as an \r\nalternative to competition, solidarity as opposed to \r\ndomination, cooperation as a replacement for \r\nexploitation, and respect for sovereignty rather than \r\ncorporate rule, ALBA represents an innovative and \r\nviable model of integration and development. \r\n Antigua and Barbuda, along with many of our \r\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) brothers and \r\nsisters, welcomes the paradigm shift that now \r\ncharacterizes engagement with agencies such as the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund. The decision to limit \r\nconditionalities to those critical to achieving the \r\nobjectives of the country programme being supported, \r\nand the commitment to play a more supportive role and \r\nallow the objectives to be set by the borrowing country \r\nare welcome responses to earlier calls to recognize the \r\nabsolute necessity of using factors other than per capita \r\ngross domestic product as a criteria to access \r\nconcessionary financing. We maintain that therein lies \r\nthe key to mitigating a downward spiral into economic \r\nand social chaos. \r\n Decision-making on issues of international \r\nfinancial governance remains a privilege of the few \r\nwhen such decisions have great impact on the lives, \r\nlivelihood and basic well-being of millions of people \r\nthe world over. My Government calls on the developed \r\ncountries that are members of the Organization for \r\nEconomic Cooperation and Development to ensure that \r\ntheir response strategies involve better international \r\ncooperation on tax issues through inclusive and \r\ncooperative frameworks that ensure the involvement \r\nand equal treatment of small jurisdictions, as stipulated \r\nin the Outcome Document (resolution 63/303) of the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on the World Financial and \r\nEconomic Crisis and Its Impact on Development. The \r\nOutcome Document is a welcome one, and I applaud \r\nthe President of the General Assembly at its sixty-third \r\nsession for giving voice to the G-192, including the \r\ndeveloping and most vulnerable countries.  \r\n The genesis of the crisis lies in the capitals of the \r\ndeveloped world, but its effects are global and the \r\nresponse must be truly global. In this regard, I urge the \r\nAssembly, through the ad hoc working group to follow \r\nup on the outcome of the Conference, to take an \r\ninclusive approach to allow for the participation of \r\nthose that are not members of the exclusive Group of \r\nEight and Group of Twenty clubs.  \r\n Again, drawing on the words of Coolidge, I point \r\nout that the general welfare cannot be provided for in \r\nany one act or, I would add, by any single, small subset \r\nof the community of nations seeking unilaterally to \r\nreshape the global economic and financial architecture. \r\nIt is in our power to change the operating principles of \r\nglobal capitalism such that economic prosperity is \r\nshared equally among countries and within countries. \r\nDrastic change is needed, in theory and practice, in \r\neconomic assumptions and in the institutions of \r\ngovernance. It is the sustainable path to development \r\nand a challenge to which this assembly of nations and \r\nleaders must rise. \r\n Meeting transnational and global threats and \r\nchallenges to development requires international \r\ncooperation. As previously stated, traditional Western-\r\nbased modalities of development cooperation in which \r\npartners are not considered equals have failed us. A \r\nparadigm shift is not an option; it is an imperative. My \r\nGovernment firmly believes in promoting partnerships \r\nin support of sustainable development based on \r\nprinciples of mutual respect and understanding, \r\nequality and a genuine desire to effect the social and \r\neconomic development of all.  \r\n I have already alluded to my country’s \r\nmembership in ALBA and commended that innovative \r\nmodel of integration and development. Antigua and \r\nBarbuda also looks forward to fully playing its role in \r\nensuring that the various trade arrangements entered \r\ninto with the European Union, the United States of \r\nAmerica and Canada work in the interest of all our \r\nnations. My Government, however, will continue to \r\nplace a strong emphasis on the development \r\ncomponents, which should be central to ensuring that \r\nthese arrangements produce positive results for our \r\npeople.  \r\n At the same time, we have deepened our \r\nintegration efforts with our CARICOM brothers and \r\nA/64/PV.7  \r\n \r\n09-52463 34 \r\n \r\nsisters, focusing on fully implementing the CARICOM \r\nSingle Market and Economy as well as deepening the \r\nvarious subregional regulatory frameworks. As a part \r\nof the smaller Organization of Eastern Caribbean States \r\n(OECS) grouping, Antigua and Barbuda fully supports \r\nthe establishment of an OECS economic union in an \r\neffort to build on the shared tradition of our \r\nsubregional integration arrangements and to expand the \r\nareas of shared sovereignty in order to survive and \r\nultimately thrive. \r\n As a member of the CARICOM family, Antigua \r\nand Barbuda is proud of its long-standing relationship \r\nwith the Republic of Cuba. It is my Government’s firm \r\nbelief that the discriminatory and punitive policies and \r\npractices that serve to prevent Cuba from exercising its \r\nright freely to participate in the affairs of the \r\nhemisphere must be discontinued and with immediate \r\neffect. While the winds of change continue to move \r\nacross the United States of America, I call on the \r\nObama Administration to effect change in its dealings \r\nwith our sister nation of the Republic of Cuba. I call on \r\nthe United States of America to end the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed on our \r\nbrothers and sisters in Cuba. As a world leader and \r\ndefender of justice, the United States of America must \r\nembrace change fully in the interests of the men, \r\nwomen and children of Cuba. \r\n It is worth reiterating that the parallels between \r\nthe global economic crisis and the global climate \r\nchange crisis are both stark and dire for small island \r\ndeveloping States. Again, we are faced with the \r\nadverse impacts of a crisis that is not of our making but \r\nwhich is threatening — quite literally in the case of \r\nsome of our sister nations in the Pacific — to wipe us \r\noff the face of the Earth. It is a recognized fact, but it is \r\nworth repeating, that small island States contribute the \r\nleast to the causes of climate change, yet we suffer the \r\nmost from its effects.  \r\n At the summit of the Alliance of Small Island \r\nStates held earlier this week, my country joined with \r\nother island States in sending a strong message to the \r\ninternational community on the need for bold and \r\nambitious actions. Small island States have expressed \r\ntheir profound disappointment at the lack of tangible \r\naction within the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change negotiations to protect \r\nsmall island developing States and other vulnerable \r\ncountries, their peoples, culture, land and ecosystems.  \r\n The responsibility for mitigating climate change \r\nis a common responsibility of all nations, be they \r\ndeveloped or developing. However, developed \r\ncountries should shoulder their moral, ethical and \r\nhistorical responsibilities for emitting high levels of \r\nanthropogenic greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. It \r\nis those actions that have now put the planet in \r\njeopardy and compromised the well-being of present \r\nand future generations. Antigua and Barbuda therefore \r\nfully supports our sister nation of the People’s \r\nRepublic of China in its call for developed countries to \r\ntake up their responsibility to provide new, additional, \r\nadequate and predictable financial support to \r\ndeveloping countries, which, in effect, represents a \r\njoint investment in the future of humankind.  \r\n At this pivotal point of the climate change \r\nnegotiations that will culminate in December, Antigua \r\nand Barbuda also anxiously awaits an international \r\nagreement significantly to reduce greenhouse gas \r\nemissions. A small island nation like ours, which is \r\nhighly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate \r\nchange, including sea-level rise, coral bleaching and \r\nmore frequent and intense hurricanes, understands that \r\nour fate, our very existence, hangs on the outcome of \r\nsuch an agreement. We wait with bated breath and hope \r\nthat humanity will show itself worthy of this planet and \r\nthat nations will have the political will and integrity of \r\nleadership to solve the most confounding challenge of \r\nour era. \r\n The effects of climate change have forcibly \r\nbrought home the absolute necessity of better disaster \r\npreparedness management and risk reduction. That has \r\nbeen clearly illustrated by several very active hurricane \r\nseasons in recent history. Cognizant of this, my \r\nGovernment has upgraded our disaster management \r\ncapabilities, including strengthening the national \r\ndisaster office, constructing hurricane shelters and \r\nenhancing community resilience. In the spirit of \r\ncooperation and solidarity, we look forward to having \r\nour development partners make available the necessary \r\nresources to enable us to implement our national \r\nadaptation plans and programmes. By so doing, they \r\nwill help to address the adverse effects of climate \r\nchange that we, the most vulnerable countries, are \r\nalready experiencing. We urge them to view this as a \r\ntop-most priority and moral imperative. \r\n Gender equality and women’s empowerment \r\nremain centrepieces of the national development \r\nstrategy of Antigua and Barbuda. Having achieved \r\n A/64/PV.7\r\n \r\n35 09-52463 \r\n \r\nuniversal primary education, we are proud that our \r\nyoung males and females continue to enjoy equal \r\naccess and opportunity to education at the primary, \r\nsecondary and tertiary levels. Further, with a growing \r\nnumber of female parliamentarians and key high-level \r\npolitical positions occupied by women, we continue to \r\nimprove on our record of female empowerment. The \r\nadvocacy work of the United Nations system on gender \r\nissues has been instrumental in the progress we have \r\nmade thus far, and we look forward to continuing \r\nsupport as we continue to break down the traditional \r\nbarriers to the active participation of more than 50 per \r\ncent of our country’s human capital. \r\n Transnational crime has burdened our societies \r\nwith social and financial costs that we cannot afford to \r\nbear. Crime prevention and small arms control are \r\npriorities for my Government. Our geography has \r\nplaced us at a major trans-shipment point for \r\ntransnational organized crime networks trafficking in \r\narms and narcotics. \r\n In recent years, the level of gun violence and \r\ngun-related crime has escalated significantly, placing \r\nfurther pressure on an already fragile economy. This \r\nhas led to insecurity, fear and loss of life in our \r\nsocieties, hampering our development efforts and \r\nthreatening the general peace and stability of the \r\nregion. We need greater cooperation from countries, as \r\nwell as the support of the United Nations system, to \r\neliminate this threat to hemispheric and international \r\npeace and security. Antigua and Barbuda is in full \r\nsupport of a legally binding arms trade treaty that will \r\nprevent the illegal international transfer of arms and \r\nwill govern the trade in conventional arms according to \r\ncommon international standards. \r\n As a peace-loving nation, Antigua and Barbuda is \r\nalso concerned by the lack of progress in the field of \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation. We remain \r\nsteadfast in our commitment to a world free of nuclear \r\nweapons. The threat posed by non-State actors \r\nacquiring weapons of mass destruction is shared by all \r\ncountries, large and small. For this reason we support \r\nthe extension of the mandate of Security Council \r\nresolution 1540 (2004). Pursuant to our obligations \r\nunder that resolution we are pleased to have submitted \r\nthe relevant reports to the respective Security Council \r\ncommittees. \r\n The trans-shipment of nuclear waste through the \r\nwaters of the Caribbean also remains a critical issue. \r\nThe risk of an accident or a terrorist attack on one of \r\nthese shipments poses a grave threat to the \r\nenvironmental and economic sustainability of the \r\nregion. Heads of Government of CARICOM and of the \r\nwider Association of Caribbean States have \r\nconsistently called for a total cessation of these \r\nshipments in our waters, and we reiterate our strenuous \r\nand forceful rejection of the continued use of the \r\nCaribbean Sea for the trans-shipment of nuclear and \r\nother hazardous waste material. \r\n Finally, as Caribbean people of African descent, \r\nour past is clouded by the dark days of the transatlantic \r\nslave trade. However, with steady hands, committed \r\nminds and innovative plans, a bright future looms with \r\nthe sunrise. We must ensure that we develop \r\nprogrammes to educate and inculcate in future \r\ngenerations an understanding of the lessons, history \r\nand consequences of slavery and the slave trade. We \r\nmust not forget. We must encourage continued action \r\nin this regard. Antigua and Barbuda looks forward to \r\nthe erection of a permanent memorial to the victims of \r\nthe transatlantic slave trade and slavery, an initiative \r\nbeing championed by CARICOM. We look forward \r\nalso to the continuation of serious dialogue and \r\neventual consensus on the issue of reparations. \r\n In conclusion, it is very clear that the multiple \r\nand multifaceted nature of the global threats and \r\nchallenges we face will test the abilities of this \r\nassembly of nations and its leaders. Is the United \r\nNations up to the task? Will we, both individually and \r\ncollectively, heed the admonition of Calvin Coolidge \r\nand demonstrate in both word and deed a firm \r\nconviction that the welfare of the weakest and the \r\nwelfare of the most powerful are inseparably bound \r\ntogether? For us, a small island with big aspirations \r\nand dreams for the future of our people, we remain \r\nhopeful that we will all find the political will and the \r\nability to rise to the task. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Antigua and Barbuda \r\nfor the statement he has just made. \r\n The Honourable Winston Baldwin Spencer, Prime \r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nAntigua and Barbuda, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n \r\nA/64/PV.7  \r\n \r\n09-52463 36 \r\n \r\nAddress by His Highness Sheikh Nasser \r\nAl-Mohammad Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, Prime \r\nMinister of the State of Kuwait \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the Prime Minister of the \r\nState of Kuwait. \r\n His Highness Sheikh Nasser Al-Mohammad \r\nAl-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, Prime Minister of \r\nthe State of Kuwait, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I have great \r\npleasure in welcoming His Highness Sheikh Nasser \r\nAl-Mohammad Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, Prime \r\nMinister of the State of Kuwait, and inviting him to \r\naddress the General Assembly. \r\n Sheikh Al-Sabah (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): It \r\nis my pleasure, Sir, to convey to you on behalf of the \r\nState of Kuwait and on my own account our most \r\nsincere congratulations on your election as President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. \r\nUndoubtedly, your long regional and international \r\nexperience will be an important asset in achieving the \r\nsuccess we desire in the work of this important session \r\nof the General Assembly. I also wish to pay tribute to \r\nthe presidency of your predecessor, His Excellency \r\nFather Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann, former Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Nicaragua, during the sixty-third \r\nsession. \r\n Mr. Sangqu (South Africa), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.  \r\n I cannot fail to express also our appreciation for \r\nthe efforts and good offices of His Excellency \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon and of the entire \r\nSecretariat staff. We thank them for all their efforts in \r\nthe service of peace and security and in improving the \r\nperformance and the programmes of United Nations \r\nbodies with a view to enhancing and developing their \r\ncapacities to keep pace with new developments on the \r\ninternational scene and to respond effectively to the \r\nchallenges and dangers of today’s world. \r\n Never before has the world been in such need of a \r\nstrong, effective global organization. The diversity and \r\ncomplexity of the challenges, crises and new \r\ndevelopments which confront our world today, in \r\naddition to regional and international questions that \r\nhave remained unresolved for a long time, require \r\nMember States to shoulder their responsibilities in \r\nsupporting this Organization, providing it with the \r\nfinancial resources it needs to perform its duties and \r\ndischarge its responsibilities effectively and with \r\ninnovative methodology. Also, the United Nations \r\nitself has a responsibility to improve its own \r\nadministrative structure and its performance in the \r\nfield, and to enhance its capacity to detect and monitor \r\ndeveloping challenges. This must be commensurate \r\nwith the current dangers, which require bold initiatives, \r\nquick action and effective treatment.  \r\n Combating terrorism; eradicating poverty and \r\nhunger; combating dangerous diseases such as \r\nHIV/AIDS, malaria and the A (H1N1) influenza virus, \r\nwhich of late has spread in a frightful manner all over \r\nthe world; and dealing with the spread of the scourge \r\nof illegal drugs: these are all challenges that require \r\nfrom our Organization innovative joint action that \r\nrecognizes the dangers, diagnoses the crises, prepares \r\nthe resources and intervenes effectively in a radical and \r\ncollective fashion. Also, mobilizing specialized \r\nregional organizations to act in a concerted and \r\norganized effort is an important element in addressing \r\nthese challenges. \r\n Moreover, there are other challenges and threats \r\nfrom which the international community still suffers, \r\nthe most prominent being the financial and economic \r\ncrisis and the phenomenon of climate change. The \r\nfinancial crisis has had a negative impact on the \r\neconomies of the developing countries and has \r\nimpeded their efforts to attain the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). This has resulted in the \r\nemergence of economic and social problems such as a \r\nhigh rate of unemployment, deceleration in the rate of \r\neconomic growth, the collapse of financial markets and \r\nan obvious contraction in regional and world trade. \r\n In this regard, we welcome the Outcome \r\nDocument adopted by the high-level meeting convened \r\nby the President of the General Assembly last June (see \r\nresolution 63/303), where commitments were made to \r\nhelp developing countries overcome the effects of the \r\nfinancial crisis, through an increase in official \r\ndevelopment assistance, and to improve the \r\ninternational trade system. It also emphasized the need \r\nto continue the reform of the international financial \r\ninstitutions to ensure equitable representation on their \r\nexecutive boards and to enhance their oversight role, as \r\nwell as to improve the conditions for providing \r\nfinancial and technical assistance for the developing \r\nand least developed countries. \r\n A/64/PV.7\r\n \r\n37 09-52463 \r\n \r\n That effort, along with joint arrangements, led to \r\nthe emergence of signs of global economic recovery \r\nduring the last few weeks. It is our hope that such \r\naction will continue in order to address a no less \r\ndangerous crisis, that of climate change and the \r\ndegradation of the environment. This problem requires \r\nan urgent global response. In this regard, we look \r\nforward to the success of the important Climate \r\nChange Conference, to be held in December in \r\nCopenhagen, Denmark.  \r\n Kuwait will be honoured to host in \r\nmid-December their Majesties and Highnesses, the \r\nleaders of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States \r\nof the Gulf, at their thirtieth Summit Conference, \r\nwhere they will have a full agenda. Foremost of the \r\nmany issues before them will be a project of vital \r\nimportance: the electric grid linking their States. We \r\nhope that this strategic step will be the first of many, \r\nincluding the monetary unification project and the \r\nissuance of a unified Gulf currency. \r\n The State of Kuwait is proud to top the list of \r\nArab States, and to hold thirty-third position overall, in \r\nhuman development. As indicated in the Arab Human \r\nDevelopment Report 2009, “Challenges to Human \r\nSecurity in the Arab Countries”, issued by the United \r\nNations Development Programme, Kuwait scored the \r\nhighest marks among the Arab States in the fields of \r\neducation, health and general freedoms. Let there be no \r\ndoubt that the Government of Kuwait will continue its \r\nefforts to improve economic and social conditions, and \r\nto achieve all the Millennium Development Goals even \r\nbefore the target date, which will provide a better life \r\nfor its citizens and residents. \r\n Kuwait is proud, too, that the United Nations \r\nOffice on Drugs and Crime, located in Vienna, has \r\nlisted Kuwait as first among Arab States, and third \r\nglobally, in combating illegal drugs and drug \r\ntrafficking. That was possible only through a focused \r\nnational effort and broad regional cooperation, which \r\nachieved outstanding results. \r\n The State of Kuwait will continue steadily to \r\nmeet all its financial commitments to international and \r\nregional institutes, funds and programmes in the field \r\nof development assistance as well as to support \r\ninfrastructure projects in the developing and least \r\ndeveloped countries. Kuwait will also continue to \r\ncontribute to development projects through the Kuwait \r\nFund for Arab Economic Development, which since its \r\nestablishment in 1961 has provided assistance \r\namounting to more than $14.5 billion to more than a \r\nhundred countries.  \r\n The State of Kuwait has also taken initiatives to \r\nstimulate economic growth, raise living standards and \r\nreduce poverty in States suffering from the increase in \r\nprices of basic food commodities. For this purpose, \r\nKuwait has established the Decent Living Fund, with \r\n$100 million capital, and has allocated $300 million to \r\nfight poverty in Africa through the Islamic \r\nDevelopment Bank. \r\n Although Kuwait is a developing country, the \r\npercentage of humanitarian development aid that it \r\nprovides exceeds the target adopted at international \r\nconferences, reaching 1.31 per cent of its gross \r\nnational product, compared with 0.45 per cent of the \r\ngross national product of States members of the \r\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and \r\nDevelopment (OECD). \r\n Based on the State of Kuwait’s realization of the \r\nimportance of economic cooperation and trade in \r\nconsolidating relations between States, His Highness \r\nthe Emir of the State of Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah \r\nAl-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, convened the first Arab \r\nEconomic Summit, focusing on development, which \r\nKuwait hosted last January. The Conference adopted a \r\nnumber of important and ambitious economic projects \r\naimed at reaching new horizons of partnership and \r\ncooperation. Also adopted was the proposal by the \r\nState of Kuwait to establish a $1 billion fund, to which \r\nwe will contribute $500 million, to support and finance \r\nsmall and medium-size development projects, which \r\nwill help raise the standards of living of Arab citizens. \r\n The June parliamentary elections in my country \r\nrepresented a qualitative transformation in Kuwaiti \r\nparliamentary life, with four women obtaining the trust \r\nand support of the Kuwaiti voters. They now join their \r\nbrothers in representing the Kuwaiti people and \r\nexpressing their ambitions under the dome of the \r\nNational Assembly. This civilized accomplishment \r\ncomes after Kuwaiti women have achieved success in \r\nthe fields of private and public enterprise, as well as \r\ngovernment work, including holding ministerial \r\npositions in the Kuwaiti Cabinet. We express our pride \r\nin, and appreciation of, the significant achievements of \r\nKuwaiti women and will continue to support their role \r\nas active partners in the political, economic and social \r\nfields. \r\nA/64/PV.7  \r\n \r\n09-52463 38 \r\n \r\n We express much sorrow and pain that the \r\nquestion of Palestine has remained unresolved for over \r\nsix decades, despite numerous international efforts and \r\ninitiatives by a number of international and regional \r\nparties. A source of major concern is the deteriorating \r\npolitical, economic, social and humanitarian situation \r\nin the occupied Palestinian territories, including \r\nJerusalem, as a result of the continued exercise by \r\nIsrael, the occupying Power, of its illegal policies and \r\npractices, contrary to international law and relevant \r\nUnited Nations resolutions. \r\n In this regard, we renew our condemnation of \r\nrepeated Israeli aggression against the occupied \r\nterritories, in particular, the military aggression against \r\nGaza last December, in which more than \r\n1,400 Palestinians, among them women, children and \r\nthe elderly, were killed. That aggression also resulted \r\nin the unjustifiable destruction of homes, property and \r\ncivilian infrastructure.  \r\n We call upon the international community, the \r\nSecurity Council in particular, to assume its \r\nresponsibilities and take all necessary measures to stop \r\nIsrael’s violation of international humanitarian law and \r\nits settlement activities as well as the policy of \r\ncollective punishment it imposes on the Palestinian \r\npeople. That policy is applied through its blockade of \r\nGaza and its restriction of the freedom of access and \r\nmovement of persons in all areas, including in the \r\noccupied territories. We also call for an immediate halt \r\nto Israel’s settlement activities, which are carried out \r\nunder unacceptable pretexts. \r\n The State of Kuwait also wishes to refer to the \r\nreport (A/HRC/12/48) of the United Nations Fact \r\nFinding Mission on the Gaza Conflict, which clearly \r\nproves that the Israeli forces committed war crimes \r\nduring the brutal aggression against Gaza last year. \r\nThis represents a grave violation of international \r\nhumanitarian law. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the \r\nSecurity Council and the broader United Nations to \r\nassume their responsibility to stop these crimes against \r\nhumanity and to punish the perpetrators in accordance \r\nwith international law. \r\n Because of its moral and national responsibilities, \r\nas well as its steady support for the Palestinian cause, \r\nthe State of Kuwait, in addition to supporting \r\ninternational efforts to improve living conditions in \r\nGaza and to rebuild what the Israeli aggression against \r\nGaza destroyed, has voluntarily pledged to donate \r\n$500 million, $200 million of which is to rebuild Gaza. \r\nThis is a portion of its commitments within the context \r\nof the League of Arab States to support the Palestinian \r\nAuthority. \r\n Kuwait also took the initiative of responding to \r\nthe appeal that the United Nations Relief and Works \r\nAgency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East \r\n(UNRWA) launched last December by donating the \r\nentire amount sought, $34 million, to cover the cost of \r\nurgently needed relief aid. \r\n In this context, we believe that the suffering of \r\nthe Palestinian people will continue until there is a \r\npermanent, just and comprehensive peace, which must \r\nmean ending the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian \r\nterritories, the establishment of a Palestinian State, \r\nwith Jerusalem as its capital, and total Israeli \r\nwithdrawal from all Arab territories it has occupied \r\nsince 4 June 1967, in implementation of relevant \r\nSecurity Council resolutions, the Road Map and the \r\nArab Peace Initiative. \r\n As for Iraq, the State of Kuwait commends the \r\nspeedy efforts of the Iraqi Government to achieve \r\npeace, security, stability and prosperity for the Iraqi \r\npeople. Kuwait supports every action that will preserve \r\nthe sovereignty, national unity and territorial integrity \r\nof brotherly Iraq and ensure non-interference in its \r\ninternal affairs. The State of Kuwait also condemns all \r\nacts of terrorism in Iraq aimed at destabilizing its \r\nsecurity and stability and instigating detestable violent \r\nsectarianism. \r\n To put an end to the so-called sectarian violence, \r\nit is important to resume the policy of dialogue and \r\nnational reconciliation in order to ensure ample \r\nparticipation by all sectors of society in all phases of \r\nthe political process, including the parliamentary \r\nelections to be held next January. The State of Kuwait \r\nwill continue to support every effort to assist brotherly \r\nIraq to regain its standing and natural position in its \r\nregional and international environment, in order to \r\nbuild a democratic, unified and peaceful Iraq, living in \r\npeace internally and with its neighbours, committed to \r\nfulfil its obligations as laid down in resolutions of \r\ninternational legitimacy. \r\n The State of Kuwait hopes that the conflict over \r\nthe occupied United Arab Emirates islands will be \r\nresolved by peaceful means. It calls upon the friendly \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran to settle the question through \r\n A/64/PV.7\r\n \r\n39 09-52463 \r\n \r\ndirect brotherly negotiations or by recourse to the \r\nInternational Court of Justice. \r\n The resolution of conflicts and the settlement of \r\ndifferences between States, particularly in our region, \r\nmust depend on a set of firm principles, deeply rooted \r\nin international relations, and emanating from \r\nresolutions of international legitimacy and the rules of \r\ninternational law. If necessary, a decision of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice must be sought to \r\npreserve good-neighbourly relations. That basis and \r\nthose legal principles cannot be sidestepped to achieve \r\nthe self-interests of one side at the expense of the other. \r\nIn no case would that serve good-neighbourly relations \r\nor the building of mutual trust, and therefore it would \r\naffect the peace and stability of the parties, as well as \r\ninternational peace and security. \r\n We followed with great interest yesterday’s \r\nSecurity Council summit (see S/PV.6191) addressing \r\none of the most important matters affecting \r\ninternational peace and security, nuclear disarmament, \r\nin order to create a world free of nuclear weapons. We \r\nnoted with satisfaction the unanimous adoption of \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1887 (2009), which sets \r\nthe stage for a world free of nuclear weapons and \r\nweapons of mass destruction, a world that fulfils the \r\nhopes of humanity and ensures the safety and \r\nprosperity of the world’s peoples. \r\n While Kuwait supports the right of all States to \r\nuse nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, it reiterates \r\nits deep-rooted belief in the important need for \r\ndisarmament of all weapons of mass destruction and \r\nfor declaring the Middle East region a zone free from \r\nnuclear weapons. We renew our call to deal seriously \r\nwith Israel, the only country in the region that did not \r\nadhere to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and \r\ncall upon Israel to adhere to the Treaty and subject all \r\nits facilities to comprehensive International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA) safeguards. \r\n Kuwait also hopes that negotiations between the \r\nfriendly Islamic Republic of Iran, the IAEA and other \r\ncountries concerned will continue, with a view to \r\nreaching a peaceful solution to the Iranian nuclear \r\nissue in order to dispel the fears and doubts \r\nsurrounding the nature and purpose of its programme. \r\n In conclusion, it is our hope that joint political \r\nwill can be mustered to achieve the noble purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter and to confront the serious \r\nchallenges facing our world today.  \r\n There is also an urgent need to redouble our \r\nefforts to reject fanaticism and xenophobia, and to \r\ncontinue strengthening the dialogue between different \r\ncivilizations and religions as the ideal mode for \r\nachieving understanding between cultures. This will \r\ncreate an appropriate environment to consolidate the \r\nprinciple of mutual respect and build bridges between \r\nsocieties. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nState of Kuwait for the statement he has just made. \r\n His Highness Sheikh Nasser Al-Mohammad \r\nAl-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, Prime Minister of \r\nthe State of Kuwait, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Navinchandra Ramgoolam, Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Mauritius \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Mauritius. \r\n Mr. Navinchandra Ramgoolam, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Republic of Mauritius, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum. \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Navinchandra \r\nRamgoolam, Prime Minister of the Republic of \r\nMauritius, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Mr. Ramgoolam (Mauritius): On behalf of my \r\ndelegation, and in my own name, I extend to the \r\nPresident our warmest congratulations on his well-\r\ndeserved election to preside over the sixty-fourth \r\nsession of the Assembly. I also commend the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his tireless \r\nefforts at the helm of our Organization in the cause of \r\ninternational peace and security. \r\n In this globalized world, nations will increasingly \r\nface unconventional, emerging threats to their security. \r\nThe recent rapid spread of the A (H1N1) virus is a case \r\nin point. The commitment of the entire membership of \r\nour Organization is required to forge a consensus to \r\ndeal with the uncertainties of the times ahead. More \r\nthan ever before, multilateralism will be the way \r\nforward. \r\nA/64/PV.7  \r\n \r\n09-52463 40 \r\n \r\n As we confronted the severe food and energy \r\ncrises of a year ago, little did we realize that the world \r\nwas about to be engulfed in an unprecedented \r\neconomic crisis. The most severe meltdown since the \r\nGreat Depression has spared no country, precisely \r\nbecause we live in an interconnected world. Millions of \r\npeople all over the world have lost their jobs, their \r\nincomes and their savings. It is estimated that an \r\nadditional 50 million people have already been driven \r\ninto extreme poverty. Whatever modest progress \r\ndeveloping countries had achieved has been severely \r\nset back. \r\n The world may be witnessing the early signs of a \r\nslow recovery. However, the aftershocks of the crisis \r\nwill continue to be felt for much longer. Developing \r\ncountries have experienced declining capital flows, \r\nstagnating foreign aid and a fall in remittances and \r\nexport revenues. \r\n Mauritius, with a small open economy, has been \r\nexceptionally exposed to the adverse effects of the \r\ncrisis. Although both our manufacturing sector and our \r\ntourism industry have been negatively impacted, we \r\nhave registered positive economic growth. This is due \r\nto the reforms my Government has implemented since \r\n2005. Bold reforms have succeeded in making our \r\neconomy more resilient. In 2008, our gross domestic \r\nproduct (GDP) grew by 5.3 per cent and the \r\nunemployment rate dropped to 7.2 per cent. Mauritius \r\nattracted foreign direct investment amounting to almost \r\n5 per cent of GDP, and achieved the highest level of \r\njob creation in more than a decade. \r\n However, the global crisis has been a severe \r\nblow. Growth has been slowed; we expect growth of \r\naround 2.7 per cent this year. But our economy is now \r\nstructurally more sound, more competitive and \r\nresilient. We are concerned that a prolonged crisis \r\ncould drive our export-oriented economy into reverse \r\ngear, with further declines in trade and capital flows, \r\nexchange rate volatility, and further falls in tourist \r\narrivals. \r\n To mitigate the damage to our economy, we \r\nreacted as soon as the first signs of the subprime crisis \r\nstarted in the United States. We introduced an \r\nexpansionary budget with emphasis on infrastructural \r\nprojects, and as the crisis spread into a worldwide \r\nfinancial and economic crisis we put in place a \r\nstimulus package to save jobs, protect people and \r\nprepare for the recovery. We have, in other words, been \r\nahead of the curve. In this uncertain economic \r\nsituation, the priority of Mauritius is to safeguard the \r\nhard-earned gains from past reforms. \r\n We have been collateral victims of financial \r\nimbalances, over-leveraged financial institutions, \r\ninadequate regulation and deficient supervision. \r\nDeveloping countries benefit little from periods of \r\nboom, and pay an inordinately high price for the busts \r\nthat often follow. We hope that strengthening \r\nregulations and supervision will prevent the \r\naccumulation of high-risk, toxic assets that led to the \r\ncrisis in the first place. \r\n The crisis has also made it clear that the Bretton \r\nWoods institutions stand in need of fundamental \r\nreform. However, reforms will be effective only if they \r\ntake into account the long-term stability and \r\nsustainability of the global economy. Institutions that \r\nmake global decisions must reflect the changing nature \r\nof the global economic environment. \r\n For too long we have condoned a clear \r\ndemocratic deficit in global economic governance. We \r\nneed to reshape the global economy into a more \r\nequitable system, responsive to the needs of all \r\ncountries and reflecting the realities of the day. In this \r\nregard, we appreciate the convening of the United \r\nNations Conference on the World Financial and \r\nEconomic Crisis and Its Impact on Development, held \r\nlast June. The Conference provided a uniquely \r\ninclusive platform to address the urgent concerns of all \r\nnations. It has allowed the formulation of proposals to \r\nlessen the impact of the crisis, especially on vulnerable \r\npopulations. \r\n The implementation of the Conference’s \r\nrecommendations should avoid a further deterioration \r\nin the conditions of the world’s poor. And we look \r\nforward to the recommendations of the Group of 20 \r\n(G20) Summit, which starts today in Pittsburgh. \r\n In coping with the effects of the crisis, we have to \r\nresist the temptation to resort to trade protectionism. \r\nWe should not forget that international trade has been a \r\npowerful engine for development and has generated \r\nsubstantial economic growth. From our perspective as \r\na vulnerable small island developing State, it is vital \r\nthat markets remain open and that international trade \r\nflows are not impeded. \r\n It is essential that the Doha Round, with \r\ndevelopment at its core, be successfully concluded, \r\n A/64/PV.7\r\n \r\n41 09-52463 \r\n \r\nwithout, however, any unravelling of the July 2008 \r\nconvergence package. We look forward to significant \r\nprogress at the seventh session of the World Trade \r\nOrganization Ministerial Conference, scheduled for \r\nDecember in Geneva. \r\n The negative impact of the economic crisis on the \r\nmost vulnerable populations causes us great concern. \r\nThe global economic slowdown has further delayed the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). Confronted with this grave setback, the \r\ndeveloping world looks for a strong demonstration of \r\nsolidarity. \r\n We hope that the donor community will do more \r\nthan just honour its previous commitments. The \r\nMillennium Declaration, the Monterrey Consensus and \r\nthe Doha Declaration on Financing for Development \r\nhave been overtaken by the events of the past year. \r\n But I strongly believe that what we need now is a \r\nchange in our approach in the developing economies. \r\nWe need to urgently apply ourselves to making \r\npro-business policy reforms instead of just relying on \r\naid. That is the way to create wealth and prosperity. \r\nCharity is a noble endeavour, but relying on charity \r\nalone is not the answer to future prosperity and \r\nopportunity for all. \r\n We need to unleash the entrepreneurial drive of \r\nour people. That is the ultimate answer to the \r\neradication of poverty. We all know that it is better to \r\nshow a man how to fish than to give him a fish every \r\nday. And we need to coordinate our actions to bring \r\ndown trade barriers. In fact, what the developing \r\ncountries need is a Marshall Plan, with a single \r\ncoordinated programme. To qualify, countries need to \r\nmeet benchmarks for good governance, respect for \r\nhuman rights, accessible health care and education and \r\npredictable economic policies. \r\n Such a plan was successful in uplifting the \r\neconomies of Europe after the Second World War. I \r\nhave no doubt that it can be adapted to meet the same \r\nmeasure of success for developing countries. \r\n At the national level, my Government is \r\nmobilizing considerable resources to meet the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. In a relentless drive \r\nto fight poverty, we have introduced an eradication of \r\nabsolute poverty programme, which aims to break the \r\nvicious circle of poverty begetting poverty. And, to \r\nshow our commitment to eradicating poverty in our \r\nregion, Mauritius took the initiative to host the \r\nSouthern African Development Community (SADC) \r\nInternational Consultative Conference on Poverty and \r\nDevelopment last year so that we can develop a \r\ncommon pragmatic approach. We are committed to the \r\nattainment of the MDGs on schedule, and look forward \r\nto the high-level review meeting next year. \r\n Ensuring the fulfilment of the MDGs demands a \r\nstronger commitment by national Governments in the \r\nfight against HIV/AIDS. We are heartened in this \r\ninstance by the response of the international \r\ncommunity, which has been timely, generous and \r\neffective. Each and every nation must be fully engaged \r\nin this fight. \r\n In Mauritius, we treat HIV/AIDS as a national \r\npriority. I have set up a National AIDS Committee, \r\nwhich I chair. We have put in place a multisectoral \r\nstrategy to protect the population at large, with special \r\nemphasis on vulnerable groups. And yesterday I was \r\ndelighted to learn about the breakthrough of an \r\nHIV/AIDS vaccine which could be available in the not \r\ntoo distant future. \r\n Recently, the A (H1N1) pandemic has rapidly \r\ntaken on alarming proportions. Although we have taken \r\nall possible steps to effectively deal with this new \r\ninfluenza virus, the escalation of the outbreak could \r\nstretch our health resources and infrastructure. In this \r\nconnection, developing countries require early access \r\nto the vaccines that are in the pipeline, once their \r\nsafety is assured. \r\n Food security should have been an absolute \r\npriority of development strategies. It has for far too \r\nlong been neglected. Many countries struggle to \r\nguarantee adequate food for their people. The present \r\neconomic recession compounds an already difficult \r\nsituation. Over a billion people, mostly in developing \r\ncountries, do not have sufficient food to meet their \r\ndaily basic nutritional needs. One in six of the human \r\nfamily goes to bed hungry and angry. \r\n The present relative decline in food prices must \r\nnot make us lose sight of the structural long-term \r\ndeficit the world faces. This age-old problem is \r\ncomplicated by uncertainties linked to climate change \r\nand the diversion of food crops for bio-fuel production. \r\n We must strengthen measures to improve food \r\nsecurity globally. Existing funding mechanisms must \r\nA/64/PV.7  \r\n \r\n09-52463 42 \r\n \r\nbe improved to assist the World Food Programme to \r\neffectively avoid recurrent outbreaks of famine. \r\n Mauritius welcomes the initiative of the Food and \r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) \r\nto convene the World Summit on Food Security in \r\nRome in November. It is our earnest hope that it will \r\nnot be just another conference, but will propose \r\npractical measures to alleviate hunger and malnutrition. \r\n In Mauritius, we have adopted a comprehensive \r\nstrategy to achieve a reasonable level of food self-\r\nsufficiency. We are mobilizing technological, financial \r\nand human resources to produce locally as much food \r\nas is practically possible. To this end, we have set up a \r\none-billion-rupee Food Security Fund to optimize \r\nefficiency and boost agricultural production. \r\n To benefit from economies of scale, we are \r\nencouraging production in surplus of local \r\nconsumption for export. We are establishing \r\npartnerships regionally to jointly produce food crops, \r\nlivestock and marine products. The effective \r\nimplementation of this strategy will contribute to \r\nimproving our national food security. \r\n We are currently working with Mozambique on a \r\nrice production project which will contribute to \r\nimproving food availability in both countries, and \r\nprobably in the region. \r\n Climate change poses an existential challenge to \r\nmankind. Our profligacy puts at stake the very future \r\nof our planet and the forms of life it supports. This is \r\nan environmental threat with far-reaching social and \r\neconomic implications that we have yet to mainstream \r\ninto our national planning and decision-making \r\nprocesses. \r\n We cannot with impunity treat our home planet \r\nwith contempt. We can yet forestall bringing upon \r\nourselves the full wrath of nature. But time is running \r\nout. Divergences must be resolved at all costs, and \r\nquickly, at Copenhagen. To move forward in a \r\npragmatic manner, we need to break away from the \r\nfinger-pointing, recrimination and brinkmanship of the \r\npast. \r\n In Copenhagen, it is imperative that we agree to a \r\ntargeted reduction in greenhouse gas emissions that \r\nwill restrict global temperature rise to no more than \r\n1.5° C. But any action, to be fair, must be proportional. \r\nThose who have polluted the most should bear most of \r\nthe burden. Developing countries need extra help so \r\nthat their growth path is not thwarted. \r\n We must create a financial mechanism to assist \r\ndeveloping countries to adapt to and mitigate the \r\neffects of climate change. This mechanism has to be \r\ncredible and sustainable, and be managed according to \r\nthe principles of good governance. It should also be a \r\nchannel for the transfer of technology. \r\n I therefore make a strong appeal that we unite to \r\nact collectively and quickly in our own interest and \r\nthat of future generations. \r\n For its part, Mauritius is implementing the \r\n“Maurice île durable” project to respond to climate \r\nchange and the energy crisis. This is an ambitious \r\nprogramme focusing on the use of renewable energy \r\nand the emergence of small power producers. Its \r\nimplementation will reduce our dependence on fossil \r\nfuels considerably and facilitate the transition to a \r\nclean, energy-efficient economy. \r\n We have mobilized appropriate resources, with \r\nthe collaboration of the private sector and development \r\npartners, to build a green and ecological future for \r\nMauritius. We are doing our utmost to contribute, in \r\nfull measure, to the global effort required. \r\n The inherent constraints faced by small island \r\ndeveloping States (SIDS) — in particular limited \r\nresources, remoteness, small domestic markets and \r\nvulnerability to natural disasters — cannot be ignored. \r\nWe share a common future, and the welfare of one is \r\nunsustainable without the welfare of all. \r\n We appeal to the international community to be \r\nmore forthcoming in assisting SIDS in their efforts to \r\nbecome integrated into the global economy. A one-size-\r\nfits-all approach to development threatens to further \r\nmarginalize SIDS in an increasingly globalized world. \r\nIt is patently obvious that SIDS deserve special \r\ntreatment and need to be recognized as a group of \r\ncountries having specificities of their own. \r\n The promotion and protection of human rights is \r\na key priority of my Government. I wish to extend our \r\nappreciation to the United Nations membership for the \r\nre-election of Mauritius to the Human Rights Council. \r\nWe will continue to work with other members of the \r\nCouncil in a spirit of dialogue, cooperation and \r\nobjectivity to ensure that human rights violations are \r\neffectively addressed. \r\n A/64/PV.7\r\n \r\n43 09-52463 \r\n \r\n In line with our commitment to see that \r\nperpetrators of grave human rights violations are \r\nbrought to justice, we wish to reaffirm our unflinching \r\nsupport for the International Criminal Court (ICC). \r\n At the national level, we have adopted legislation \r\nsuch as the Equal Opportunities Act and the Truth and \r\nJustice Commission Act to further entrench human \r\nrights. Our achievements in the field of human rights \r\nwere widely acknowledged during the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review conducted earlier this year by the \r\nHuman Rights Council. We were gratified by the \r\nunique opportunity provided to us by the Review to \r\nmake a critical self-assessment of the situation in \r\nMauritius. \r\n When I addressed the Assembly in September \r\n2007 I called on the international community to do \r\nmore than just stand by the people of Burma. This \r\nappeal is more than ever relevant. We cannot condone \r\nthe condemnation of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi by a \r\nkangaroo court. We reaffirm our solidarity with and \r\nsupport for Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, an emblematic lady \r\nwho personifies the courage and dignity of her people, \r\na people battered and bruised but unbowed.  \r\n It is imperative that we convey a clear and strong \r\nsignal to the military junta that the international \r\ncommunity will not tolerate its confiscation of the \r\nBurmese people’s sovereignty. In this respect, I \r\nwelcome the recent decision of the EU to extend the \r\nsanctions imposed on Burma. \r\n For its part, Mauritius will continue to implement \r\nthe decision I took in 1997 to suspend importations of \r\nrice from Burma. This decision has a cost, but it is a \r\nprice we are prepared to pay in defence of principles \r\nwe hold dear. We must show the world that there will \r\nbe no double standards in our approach. I urge those \r\ncountries that give comfort and sustenance to the \r\nregime not to let their short-term, mercantile interests \r\nperpetuate the misery of this long-suffering people. \r\n The Arab-Israeli conflict, with the question of \r\nPalestine at its core, remains an issue of deep concern \r\nnot only to the region, but also to the world at large. \r\nWe take heart in the efforts of the Administration of \r\nPresident Obama to impart new impetus to the Middle \r\nEast peace process. And we could not agree more with \r\nPresident Obama that continuing to build new \r\nsettlements flies in the face of logic if lasting peace is \r\nto be achieved. \r\n As a long-time proponent of a two-State solution, \r\nMauritius welcomes the Quartet’s commitment, \r\nrenewed in Trieste in June, to actively and vigorously \r\nwork for a comprehensive solution of the Arab-Israeli \r\nconflict. \r\n The Arab League’s commitment to peace with \r\nIsrael and the Arab Peace Initiative have been \r\nencouraging developments. We hope that those most \r\ndirectly concerned will display the courage and \r\nmaturity to engage in meaningful dialogue in earnest. \r\n The United Nations is, more than ever, the \r\nultimate guardian of mankind’s aspiration to global \r\npeace and security. I salute its unceasing effort in \r\nresolving conflicts around the world, in particular on \r\nthe African continent. Conflicts and insecurity in \r\nAfrica have been a major cause of the continent’s \r\nunderdevelopment. A study carried out by Oxfam last \r\nyear indicates that between 1990 and 2005 conflict cost \r\nthe continent $300 billion, which is almost equivalent \r\nto all the international aid received by sub-Saharan \r\nAfrica during that period. \r\n The African Union has moved ahead with the \r\ncreation of an African Standby Force. Once fully \r\nestablished, the Force will, hopefully, help in the \r\nadvancement of peace and security at the continental \r\nlevel. The creation of the Mechanism for Conflict \r\nPrevention, Management and Resolution is also a \r\npositive step in improving the peace and security \r\narchitecture of Africa. \r\n I take this opportunity to commend the United \r\nNations and the European Union for helping Africa \r\nenhance its capacity to respond adequately and in a \r\ntimely manner to security threats on the continent. The \r\nEuropean Union deserves our appreciation for its \r\ncontribution, to the tune of €500 million under the \r\n10th European Development Fund, for the implementation \r\nof the Africa Peace Facility. \r\n Allow me also to highlight some of the progress \r\nthat has been achieved on the continent this year, \r\nincluding the formation of an all-inclusive Government \r\nin Zimbabwe and the holding of presidential elections \r\nin Mauritania. \r\n We welcome the Agreement of Goodwill and \r\nConfidence-Building for the Settlement of the Problem \r\nin Darfur reached in February by Sudan’s Government \r\nof National Unity and the Justice and Equality \r\nMovement.  \r\nA/64/PV.7  \r\n \r\n09-52463 44 \r\n \r\n We commend the role played by the African \r\nUnion-United Nations joint mediation team and \r\nparticularly the Government of Qatar, which has done \r\nso much to drive the process. We call on all the parties \r\nto the conflict to join in the search for peace in Darfur. \r\nWe hope that conditions will speedily be created for \r\nthe return of refugees and internally displaced persons. \r\n We have high expectations that the preliminary \r\nagreement reached in Maputo will provide the political \r\nframework for resolution of the troubled situation in \r\nMadagascar. We are heartened by the active \r\ninvolvement and solicitude of various international \r\nbodies in trying to return the country to constitutional \r\norder. We cannot and should not condone \r\nunconstitutional Governments anywhere, be it in \r\nHonduras or Madagascar. \r\n Somalia reminds us that we cannot with impunity \r\nwash our hands of any country, however remote it may \r\nbe or however unimportant it may seem. The \r\ninternational community’s neglect of the country and \r\nits indifference to the suffering of the Somali people \r\nhave resulted in a quintessential failed State. That \r\nneglect and indifference have come back to haunt us in \r\nthe form of piracy. Armed bands led by warlords have \r\nfilled the political vacuum left by the deliquescence of \r\nthe Somali State. Today the territory of Somalia \r\nprovides not only a haven for pirates, but also a base \r\nfor terrorist groups. The Transitional Federal \r\nGovernment has to be assisted to regain control of the \r\ncountry, to put an end to the suffering of the Somali \r\npeople and to deal with the problem of piracy. \r\n Terrorism is an insidious, tentacular \r\nmalignancy — a bane of our times. It is not only a \r\nsecurity threat. It is a moral challenge, the negation of \r\nthe fundamental values of civilization: the sanctity of \r\nhuman life and the intrinsic worth of the human \r\nperson. \r\n Every terrorist attack causes us pain, anguish and \r\nrevulsion. But the one in Mumbai last November took \r\non a special poignancy for the people of Mauritius. In \r\nthe blind and mindless carnage unleashed by the \r\nterrorists on that city, one of the victims was a \r\ncompatriot of ours. We have condemned in no \r\nuncertain terms this dastardly, cowardly act, and we \r\nexpect that everything will be done to ensure that the \r\nterrorist organization behind it is brought to justice. \r\nMy Government unreservedly supports all campaigns \r\nand initiatives against terrorism. \r\n Mauritius nurtures the hope of the complete \r\nelimination of all nuclear weapons one day. Pending its \r\nultimate realization, we support all measures aimed at \r\nhalting the further spread of such weapons. In this \r\nregard, we welcome the comprehensive agenda of \r\nPresident Obama to achieve the goal of a world \r\nwithout nuclear weapons. \r\n Multilateralism is the cornerstone of the United \r\nNations, and should be strengthened in the face of the \r\ncurrent global challenges. Global challenges need a \r\nglobal response. \r\n We follow with keen interest the process under \r\nway to revitalize the General Assembly and improve its \r\nworking methods, to bring more coherence to the \r\nUnited Nation system, and to reform the Security \r\nCouncil. \r\n We are particularly satisfied by the start of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform earlier this year in an informal plenary session \r\nof the General Assembly. The comity of nations should \r\nwork together, in a spirit of solidarity, to reach a \r\nunified position on the reform of this important body. \r\nThe reform of the Council should cover the categories \r\nof both permanent and non-permanent members, with a \r\nrevised set of working methods. \r\n We fully support India’s having a permanent seat \r\nin a reformed Security Council. And we once again \r\nexpress our unequivocal support for the Common \r\nAfrican Position. We also support permanent \r\nmembership of a Latin American and Caribbean \r\ncountry in a reformed Security Council. \r\n I take this opportunity to reaffirm the sovereignty \r\nof Mauritius over the Chagos Archipelago, including \r\nDiego Garcia, which was detached by the United \r\nKingdom from the territory of Mauritius prior to our \r\nindependence. The dismemberment of the territory of \r\nMauritius was in total disregard of General Assembly \r\nresolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960 and 2066 \r\n(XX) of 16 December 1965. \r\n As President Obama said two days ago from this \r\nvery rostrum, we must “demonstrate that international \r\nlaw is not an empty promise” (A/64/PV.3). We must all \r\nabide by it. \r\n We have consistently urged the United Kingdom \r\nto engage in a meaningful dialogue with Mauritius for \r\nthe early return of the Chagos Archipelago. We are \r\npleased to inform the Assembly that two rounds of \r\n A/64/PV.7\r\n \r\n45 09-52463 \r\n \r\ntalks have been held with the United Kingdom this \r\nyear. We look forward to those discussions coming to \r\nfruition, and hope that Mauritius will be able to \r\nexercise its sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago, \r\nincluding Diego Garcia, in the near future. \r\n My Government and the French authorities are \r\nalso in the process of addressing the issue of Tromelin. \r\nWe are discussing the modalities of co-management of \r\nthe island in a spirit of friendship and trust, pending the \r\nsettlement of the sovereignty issue, which has to be \r\nresolved and not left on the back burner. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n Nobody can deny the key role that the United \r\nNations is called upon to play in the concert of nations. \r\nAt the same time, we agree that the Organization needs \r\nto be reformed. The attendance at this session of the \r\nAssembly, where each year a number of points of view \r\nand perceptions converge, emphasizes our desire to act \r\nand build together.  \r\n The concerns and aspirations of our peoples are \r\nechoed and thus take on universal resonance. We are \r\nindeed becoming aware that, whatever latitude we \r\ndevelop in, we have a common destiny. \r\n I am one of a people steeped in several cultures, \r\nwhose men and women worship Shiva, Jesus, Allah \r\nand Buddha, in diverse languages. The history of the  \r\npopulating of our island and its geographical position \r\nhave made our country a true crossroads of cultures. \r\nWe have made the right to difference on the one hand \r\nand the right to equality on the other our watchwords. I \r\nam happy to remind my multi-ethnic people that each \r\nindividual shares with all other humans 99.9 per cent \r\nof the same genetic code. \r\n Those of us gathered here have much to learn \r\nfrom each other. Exchanging our experiences and \r\nknowledge enriches us and makes us stronger. \r\n The respect for plurality that this forum demands \r\nmust neither make us forget our differences nor \r\ncontribute to the emergence of a dominant discourse.  \r\n I commend the topic that the President has chosen \r\nfor this year. If the Assembly manages to foster cross-\r\npollenization of cultures and to highlight what human \r\nbeings have in common, we shall, to a large extent, \r\nhave achieved our goal. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Mauritius for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n Mr. Navinchandra Ramgoolam, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Republic of Mauritius, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\nThe meeting rose at 2.10 p.m. \r\n"
