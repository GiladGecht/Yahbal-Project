(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) \r\n \r\n \r\n In the absence of the President, Mr. Saudabayev \r\n(Kazakhstan), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.15 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Boris Tadić, President of the \r\nRepublic of Serbia \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Russian): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Serbia. \r\n Mr. Boris Tadić, President of the Republic of \r\nSerbia, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.  \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Russian): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Boris Tadić, President of the Republic of Serbia, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Tadić: The United Nations is the only \r\nuniversal institution that unites us all as a global \r\ncommunity of independent States. At the very heart of \r\nthis indispensable Organization stands the General \r\nAssembly, the only place in the world where the \r\nsovereign voices of all countries are given an equal, \r\nlegitimate say in the future course of mankind. \r\n Safeguarding the principles of the United Nations \r\nCharter remains much more important than the policies \r\nof any single nation, especially during transformative \r\nperiods such as this. The international system seems to \r\nbe undergoing a paradigm shift that, in many ways, is \r\ncomparable in scope to those that occurred in 1945 and \r\n1989. \r\n No one is yet able to reliably predict how deep \r\nthe change will turn out to be. What is becoming \r\nevident is that interrelated factors — the most recent of \r\nwhich is the global economic crisis — have caused the \r\narrival of a new set of circumstances on the world \r\nstage. A broad repositioning appears to be taking place. \r\nThe global balance of power is shifting as new \r\nfinancial models compete for primacy. All in all, \r\ninternational relations are becoming less predictable.  \r\n Achieving consensus on fundamental issues that \r\naffect us all has never been more important. As United \r\nNations Member States, it is incumbent upon us to \r\nwork more closely together to reaffirm the rules that \r\ngovern the international system, to reinforce the \r\nterritorial integrity of Member States, to entrench \r\ninterdependence and to complete the transition from \r\nthe old order, based on political and economic \r\ndomination, to one established on equitable \r\ncooperation among all nations. \r\n That is the only way to build a future of global \r\npeace, stability and prosperity. It is the only way to \r\nenhance the dialogue among civilizations, to make \r\nmultilateralism more effective and to provide for \r\nsustainable development and eradicate poverty \r\nthroughout the world. And it is the only way to \r\neffectively fight terrorism and cross-border organized \r\ncrime and to promote nuclear disarmament. \r\n We must also work more in concert with one \r\nanother to combat the effects of climate change. That \r\nA/64/PV.8  \r\n \r\n09-52470 2 \r\n \r\nwill continue to be strongly emphasized over the \r\ncourse of Serbia’s two-year presidency of the \r\nGoverning Council of the United Nations \r\nEnvironmental Programme. As part of our efforts, we \r\nhave proposed the establishment of a regional climate \r\nchange centre in Belgrade, Serbia. \r\n As a responsible global citizen, we have \r\nunderlined the necessity of agreeing on a fair and \r\nbalanced emissions reduction scheme and, in \r\nparticular, on a new comprehensive climate \r\nagreement — one that will secure eco-friendly \r\ninvestments, stimulate innovation and facilitate the \r\nglobal spread of technologies, knowledge and \r\nexperience.  \r\n In short, working towards a “green economy” \r\nwill decisively contribute to placing the whole world \r\nfirmly on the path towards a cleaner, more sustainable \r\npath. \r\n How we conduct ourselves at this time of great \r\ntransformation will constitute a precedent with far-\r\nreaching consequences for generations to come. Simply \r\nput, we are at a point of decision: will we choose a \r\nworld in which there are no rules as exceptions become \r\nthe new norms, devoid of any meaning except “might \r\nmakes right”? Or will we opt to solidify the great gains \r\nachieved when the principles of an equitable \r\ninternational order were embodied in the United \r\nNations Charter? \r\n I believe that only the latter alternative provides a \r\nfuture that all United Nations Member States can work \r\nin concert to bring about. The starting point remains \r\nuniversal respect for international law. No one should \r\nbe above it, no one should stand beyond its reach and \r\nno one should feel at liberty to declare an exception to \r\nits jurisdiction and scope. And yet that is precisely \r\nwhat was recently attempted. \r\n I come before the Assembly as the President of a \r\ncountry that is trapped at the centre of one of the most \r\ndangerous challenges to the universality of the \r\ninternational system since the founding of the United \r\nNations. I speak of UDI — the unilateral declaration of \r\nindependence by the ethnic Albanian authorities of \r\nSerbia’s southern province of Kosovo and Metohija. \r\nThis attempt at secession stands in direct violation of \r\nSerbia’s democratic Constitution, as well as the basic \r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter, the Helsinki \r\nFinal Act and Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). \r\n Some say Kosovo’s unilateral declaration of \r\nindependence is a unique case. But in truth it is an \r\nattempt to forcibly partition a Member State of the \r\nUnited Nations against its will and without regard for \r\nthe firm opposition of the Security Council. It is an \r\nattempt to impose a nineteenth-century outcome on a \r\ntwenty-first century challenge. Serbia will never, under \r\nany circumstances, implicitly or explicitly, recognize \r\nthe unilateral declaration of independence of the ethnic \r\nAlbanian authorities of our southern province. \r\n We will continue to vigorously defend our \r\nintegrity in a non-confrontational manner, using all \r\npeaceful means at our disposal. That is why, at the very \r\noutset of this grave crisis, Serbia ruled out the use of \r\nforce. We chose to respond to Kosovo with the utmost \r\nresponsibility and restraint. Serbia opted for a \r\ndiplomatic approach, the result of which is that a vast \r\nmajority of United Nations Member States have \r\nrefrained from recognizing the unilateral declaration of \r\nindependence in Kosovo and have continued to abide \r\nby their Charter obligation to respect the sovereignty \r\nand territorial integrity of my country. On behalf of the \r\nRepublic of Serbia, allow me once again to sincerely \r\nthank these countries for their adherence to the \r\nprinciples of international law. \r\n While categorically rejecting violence and \r\nunilateralism, Serbia has been equally emphatic in \r\ndemanding that justice be delivered through the proper \r\nlegal means at the disposal of any United Nations \r\nMember State. As part of our constructive approach, \r\nwe decided to contest the issue of Kosovo’s unilateral \r\ndeclaration of independence before the principal \r\njudicial organ of the United Nations, the International \r\nCourt of Justice, which was tasked by General \r\nAssembly resolution 63/3 with issuing an advisory \r\nopinion on whether that declaration is in accordance \r\nwith international law. I would like to take this \r\nopportunity to inform the Member States that the Court \r\nhas concluded the preliminary, written phase of its \r\nproceedings in the case. Public hearings are scheduled \r\nto begin on 1 December, with a decision by the Court \r\nexpected sometime next year. \r\n Let me express my sincere gratitude to all those \r\ncountries that have chosen to actively support Serbia’s \r\nstrategic choice to transfer the Kosovo issue to the \r\njudicial arena. The case marks the first time in the \r\nhistory of the Court that it has been asked to consider \r\nthe legality of an attempt at secession by an ethnic \r\ngroup from a United Nations Member State. There is \r\n A/64/PV.8\r\n \r\n3 09-52470 \r\n \r\nno doubt that the Court’s conclusions will constitute a \r\npowerful legal precedent, with overarching \r\nconsequences for the United Nations system. The \r\noutcome will either strongly deter other separatist \r\nmovements from attempting to secede, or produce a \r\nresult that could encourage them to act in a similar \r\nfashion. Plainly stated, should Kosovo’s unilateral \r\ndeclaration of independence be allowed to stand, a \r\ndoor would open for challenging the territorial \r\nintegrity of any United Nations Member State. \r\n The uniquely important nature of this case has \r\nbeen acknowledged by the international community. As \r\nwe know, all five permanent members of the Security \r\nCouncil have confirmed their participation in the \r\npublic hearings before the International Court of \r\nJustice. It is in this context that I appeal to all Member \r\nStates to respect the fact that the Court continues to be \r\nactively engaged on the issue. Its deliberations should \r\nnot be prejudged and its work should not be obstructed. \r\nThe Court’s proceedings have to be allowed to run \r\ntheir course without political pressure, such as any \r\nfurther recognition of Kosovo’s unilateral declaration \r\nof independence. On behalf of the Republic of Serbia, I \r\nencourage all non-recognizing Member States to stay \r\nthe course. By maintaining respect for my country’s \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity, together we will \r\nhelp ensure that international law continues to close in \r\non the issue of unilateral declarations of independence. \r\n Serbia’s decision to turn to the International \r\nCourt of Justice to contest the Kosovo issue has been \r\ncomplemented by a policy of constructive engagement \r\nwith all legitimate actors on the ground in Kosovo. We \r\nmaintain support for a reconfigured United Nations \r\nInterim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) \r\nand its continuing indispensability. We have also \r\nwelcomed a status-neutral European Union Rule of \r\nLaw Mission in Kosovo (EULEX), working in our \r\nsouthern province on the basis of Security Council \r\nresolution 1244 (1999), which continues to operate \r\nunder the overall authority of the United Nations. I call \r\non all responsible stakeholders invested in the future of \r\nKosovo to work more closely with the Government of \r\nSerbia on implementing in full the Secretary-General’s \r\nsix-point plan (S/2008/354, annex I), which was \r\nwelcomed by the Security Council in November 2008. \r\n This is a time for leadership and working \r\ntogether, not for increasing the divide. We all have our \r\nconstraints, and they should be respected. Let us create \r\nnew opportunities for achieving practical results, by \r\nengaging with one another on a host of concrete \r\nquestions for the benefit of all residents of Kosovo \r\nprovince, including the Serbs — the community most \r\nat risk in all of Europe. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n Democracy in Serbia is sound; our society rests \r\non a solid foundation and our values have been \r\nstrongly confirmed by law. The basis of our strategic \r\napproach to national development is the call for all \r\nEuropean nations to share their common destiny. On \r\nmany occasions our actions, in very difficult \r\ncircumstances, have proved our determination to \r\nbecome a member of the European Union (EU). \r\nDespite setbacks, our core strategic priority remains \r\nthat of attaining EU membership, not merely on \r\ngrounds of geography, heritage or economic prosperity, \r\nbut also because of the essential values that we share. \r\nThese are values that proclaim soft power in foreign \r\npolicy and the primacy of law in domestic affairs; \r\nachieving consensus in Brussels and standards of \r\nhuman rights throughout the EU. These are values that \r\nproclaim freedom of movement for all citizens of \r\nSerbia in the Schengen area, the tangible result of our \r\nprocess of entry into the EU, which we hope to see \r\nimplemented on 1 January 2010. This will bring us \r\ncloser to Europe, for the right to travel without a visa is \r\nto the citizens of Serbia the expression of what the EU \r\nmeans on a daily basis. \r\n But these are also values that have led us to \r\nmodernize our administration, to adopt exemplary \r\nlegislation in areas such as anti-discrimination and the \r\nprotection of minorities, and to redouble our efforts \r\ntowards regional reconciliation. That is an important \r\nreason why Serbia will shortly complete its full \r\ncooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal \r\nfor the Former Yugoslavia: it is a legal and moral \r\nobligation towards victims, towards ourselves and, \r\nabove all, towards future generations.  \r\n As the twentieth anniversary of the fall of the \r\nBerlin wall approaches, we must not forget that the \r\nobjective of uniting all the nations of Europe under the \r\nsame roof has not yet been attained. Much remains to \r\nbe done. Expansion fatigue must not emerge as a new \r\nreality in Europe. Solidarity must remain a high \r\npriority. It will never be time to consider an exit \r\nstrategy with regard to the Western Balkans. \r\n Permit me to stress that the facts are clear. All \r\nbenefit from expansion: old and new members, as well \r\nA/64/PV.8  \r\n \r\n09-52470 4 \r\n \r\nas potential members of the EU. This goes beyond our \r\nwildest dreams, even at a time of economic challenges \r\nand political demoralization. That is because the values \r\nthat unite us are strong and just. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n In that context, let me underline the necessity of \r\nstrengthening regional cooperation. In June, Serbia \r\nhosted 15 heads of State during the Central European \r\nSummit, whose main topic was the interdependence of \r\nthe economy, EU integration and energy. That \r\ndemonstrated our commitment to acting constructively \r\nand working closely together with neighbouring \r\ncountries to ensure that regional peace is consolidated. \r\n With regard to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia is \r\na guarantor of the Dayton Agreement. Let there be no \r\ndoubt that we will remain committed to the sovereignty \r\nand territorial integrity of that neighbouring country, as \r\nwe will to those of all other United Nations Member \r\nStates in the region and across the world. \r\n In short, as the strategic anchor of stability in the \r\nWestern Balkans, Serbia will invest even greater efforts \r\nin completing the democratic transformation of our \r\npart of Europe. \r\n Serbia’s robust European vision is complemented \r\nby our strong determination to pursue a carefully \r\nbalanced, artfully executed and active foreign policy \r\naimed at engagement with nations throughout the \r\nworld, near and far. That is in our long-term interest \r\nand will not change. Therefore, our engagement with \r\nBrussels, Moscow, Washington and Beijing — the four \r\nenduring pillars of Serbia’s foreign policy — will \r\ncontinue to be strengthened in the time ahead. \r\n In conclusion, I want to emphasize another \r\nimportant dimension of our foreign policy. Serbia will \r\ncontinue to deepen ties with proud nations across the \r\nglobe, many of which are members of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement (NAM). My country is the largest successor \r\nto a founding member of the Movement. Serbia’s \r\ncapital, Belgrade, was the site of the first NAM \r\nsummit, held in 1961. That is why I have proposed that \r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the Non-Aligned Movement \r\nbe celebrated in Belgrade with an extraordinary \r\nsummit under the auspices of the Egyptian \r\nchairmanship. \r\n Let me emphasize that Serbia will continue to \r\nengage with NAM countries, not only to honour a \r\nlegacy from the past and to renew traditional \r\nfriendships, but also because we believe that \r\ninternational stability and prosperity cannot be \r\nconsolidated without taking into account the views of \r\nthe majority in the global family of nations. \r\n I close by saying that the time for anyone to \r\nprocrastinate, to try half-measures or to delay and \r\ndiscourage is coming to a close. In its place, we are \r\nentering a period in which only results matter — a \r\nperiod of consequence and momentous choice. Now \r\ncomes our time of testing. \r\n Our vision is simple: the universal application of \r\nthe principles contained in the United Nations Charter, \r\nthe strengthening of international law and human rights \r\nin an increasingly interdependent world, the equitable \r\ndevelopment of the global economy and the sustainable \r\nmanagement of the environment throughout the world. \r\nLet us all have the courage to see that vision through to \r\nits rapid and noble completion.  \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Russian): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Serbia for the statement he \r\nhas just made. \r\n Mr. Boris Tadić, President of the Republic of \r\nSerbia, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Emanuel Mori, President of the \r\nFederated States of Micronesia \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Russian): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Federated States of Micronesia. \r\n Mr. Emanuel Mori, President of the Federated \r\nStates of Micronesia, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Russian): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Emanuel Mori, President of the Federated States of \r\nMicronesia, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Mori: I wish to offer my warm \r\ncongratulations to Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his \r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-fourth session. We are confident that he will \r\nlive up to the high standards set by his esteemed \r\npredecessor. \r\n Allow me to begin my remarks today by thanking \r\nmembers of the General Assembly for their positive \r\n A/64/PV.8\r\n \r\n5 09-52470 \r\n \r\naction this past June in adopting resolution 63/281, on \r\nclimate change and its possible security implications. \r\nDeveloped and developing countries alike worked \r\ntogether with the smallest and most vulnerable to do \r\nsomething that would have been unthinkable just a few \r\nyears ago. It is now becoming all the more compelling \r\nthat we work together, as we did in adopting that \r\nresolution, to act decisively in confronting this threat. \r\n The importance of this groundbreaking resolution \r\ncannot be overstated. Its message is clear: climate \r\nchange is a threat to international peace and security. \r\nThe resolution is a historic milestone for this body. \r\nClimate change, including its far-reaching effects and \r\nits security implications, is the defining issue for the \r\nworld today — an issue that should command the \r\nattention and support of everyone. \r\n When we met here last year, the world economy \r\nwas going through a time of unprecedented crisis. \r\nFearing that the global economy was heading for \r\ncollapse, the world stood together and, with strong \r\ndetermination and swiftness, adopted difficult but \r\nconcrete measures aimed at averting that global \r\ndisaster. In keeping with the spirit of cooperation, it is \r\nindispensable for the international community to be \r\nsteadfast and bold enough to take equally difficult \r\ndecisions to address the climate change crisis without \r\ndelay. Accelerating action by and cooperation among \r\nGovernments, the private sector and civil society is \r\nimperative in order to meet the challenge posed by \r\nclimate change.  \r\n Given the critical importance of climate change \r\nto my country, allow me to address that issue here \r\nagain. I thank the Secretary-General for bringing more \r\nattention to climate change and for convening the high-\r\nlevel Summit on Climate Change on 22 September \r\n2009. \r\n For us Micronesians and our fellow Pacific \r\nislanders, including those of other parts of the world, \r\nclimate change is a matter of survival as peoples, \r\ncultures and nations. For centuries, the people of \r\nMicronesia have lived on their small islands, many less \r\nthan a metre above sea level. They have enjoyed a life \r\ndependent on the bounties of the sea and the harvest \r\nfrom the land. They have developed a culture of \r\nrespect for nature and have lived in harmony with their \r\nnatural surroundings. They built outrigger canoes and \r\nrigged them with sails from pandanus leaves. Long \r\nbefore Magellan, they sailed the vast expanse of the \r\nPacific Ocean, aided only by an intimate understanding \r\nof the stars and ocean currents.  \r\n Sadly, today’s disregard for our planet is slowly \r\nmaking the ocean that has always nurtured us the very \r\ninstrument of our destruction. Micronesia is already \r\nexperiencing the brunt of the negative impacts of \r\nclimate change. The sea-level rise, changing weather \r\npatterns and an increase in the frequency and intensity \r\nof natural disasters, such as typhoons, are all \r\nundermining our development efforts. The years of El \r\nNiño have brought more droughts and increased \r\nrainfall, causing substantial damage to staple crops. \r\nOur taro patches and arable lands are limited to begin \r\nwith. Compounding the problem is the intrusion of salt \r\nwater, damaging basic crops, including taro and \r\ncoconut trees — our tree of life. What if the melting of \r\npolar ice sheets and glaciers were to reach an \r\nirreversible point? The outcome is crystal-clear: \r\nMicronesia and all low-lying islands would disappear \r\nfrom the face of the Earth. But the effects would go \r\nmuch further, endangering coastal cities and \r\ncommunities all over the world, including Manhattan. \r\n Our vulnerability compels us to take proactive \r\nconcerted action in seeking fast-track solutions. In that \r\nregard, I am pleased to share two specific mitigation \r\nmeasures taken by my Government. \r\n The first action taken by Micronesia is a proposal \r\nthat has been submitted to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change \r\n(UNFCCC). The aim of the proposal is to make a \r\nmodest beginning to evaluating rapid mitigation \r\nstrategies by establishing a four-year programme for \r\nexperts to report on ways to achieve rapid mitigation \r\nby dealing with short-lived non-carbon dioxide agents, \r\nincluding black carbon, under the auspices of \r\nUNFCCC. \r\n This year, Micronesia and Mauritius proposed a \r\ntwo-part amendment to the Montreal Protocol to phase \r\ndown the production and use of hydrofluorocarbons \r\n(HFCs). Secondly, our proposal would expand efforts \r\nto destroy so-called banks of discarded refrigerants that \r\nare harmful to climate. Our proposal, with additional \r\nsponsors, has started a global dialogue on the \r\ndemonstrated versatility of the Montreal Protocol as a \r\ntreaty for early climate protection. \r\n I want to commend the North American countries \r\nfor their strong support and action on HFCs. Recently, \r\nthe United States, Canada and Mexico added their \r\nA/64/PV.8  \r\n \r\n09-52470 6 \r\n \r\nsupport to the proposal to use the Montreal Protocol to \r\nphase down HFCs. That kind of cooperation, between \r\ndeveloped and developing countries, is what we need. \r\nWe therefore urge the North American countries and \r\nothers to support the second part of the amendment \r\nproposed by Micronesia and Mauritius. \r\n The bottom line is that Micronesia has already \r\nsuffered the effects of climate change. We therefore \r\nseek to draw the attention of the world to any and all \r\npossibilities for rapid mitigation action that could buy \r\nus more time while the long-term war against carbon \r\ndioxide proceeds. \r\n Allow me now to briefly focus on several other \r\nareas of priority to my country. To effectively manage \r\nand conserve our biodiversity and limited natural \r\nresources, Micronesia continues to work with other \r\nGovernments in our subregion to meet the \r\ncommitments of the Micronesia Challenge, which calls \r\nfor the conservation of at least 30 per cent of the area’s \r\nmarine resources and 20 per cent of its land resources \r\nby 2020. We acknowledge the support of our friends \r\nand development partners who have helped us \r\nimplement that initiative. \r\n As part of our national development agenda, \r\nespecially in the priority areas of health, education and \r\nprivate sector development, we are seeking to acquire \r\ncomprehensive broadband connectivity capacity \r\nthrough undersea fibre-optic cable. That will enable us \r\nto meet the objectives of the World Summit on the \r\nInformation Society and the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). We are also taking the necessary \r\nmeasures to liberalize the environment for \r\ntelecommunications services in order to promote \r\ncompetition and to put in place an appropriate national \r\ninformation and communications technology plan.  \r\n To achieve those objectives, we look to the United \r\nNations system, the International Telecommunication \r\nUnion and our development partners for their support \r\nand guidance.  \r\n Micronesia is indeed undertaking a wide variety \r\nof tasks as it strives to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. We recognize that some of the \r\nGoals can be especially difficult for us to sustain, even \r\nthough we may be on track to achieve them. Progress \r\ntowards the MDGs is inherently threatened by the \r\nnature of our vulnerability to climate change. \r\n As an island State with a large excusive economic \r\nzone abundant with marine and fisheries resources, we \r\nare naturally concerned about unsustainable fishing \r\npractices. We are also concerned about the unabated \r\nincidence of illegal, unreported unregulated fishing, \r\nwhich only robs the coastal island nations of their most \r\nprecious resource, which is fish. \r\n At a time when the world food market is deeply \r\naffected by the food crisis and economic turmoil, \r\nMicronesians are increasingly dependent on the \r\nbounties of the sea to provide their nourishment and \r\ntheir economic development. That is precisely why we \r\nremain concerned about the collateral catches and \r\ndiscards in commercial fisheries, as they deprive our \r\npeople of the critical resources that they depend upon \r\nfor their subsistence living and that are of cultural \r\nimportance. The international community must help us \r\nto find ways to minimize and eliminate that wasteful \r\nharvesting of resources. Economic resources are \r\ncritical to successfully implementing our nation-\r\nbuilding efforts. \r\n Micronesia has a genuine interest in the reform of \r\nthe Security Council — a Council that must embrace \r\nan expansion in both of its membership categories, to \r\nbe more inclusive and broadly representative and to \r\nreflect the present realities of the world in the new \r\ncentury. We urge the President of the Assembly to carry \r\nforward the intergovernmental negotiations that were \r\nbegun during its sixty-third session. I reiterate our \r\nsupport for the candidacies of Japan, India and \r\nGermany for permanent membership on the Council. \r\n December is around the corner and the world \r\nneeds to seal the deal in Copenhagen. The task will not \r\nbe easy, but we must not fail. Millions of lives are at \r\nrisk and our homelands are in peril. \r\n Micronesia is a member of the Alliance of Small \r\nIsland States and our position is well known. We have \r\nrepeatedly called for a strong agreement that must \r\nleave no island behind. Our collective failure to meet \r\nthis challenge now will lead us towards colossal and \r\nirreversible damage to our Mother Earth. \r\n When the health of our planet needs remedy and \r\nthe lives of millions depend on our action, we must \r\nrespond and take appropriate and swift action. I am \r\naware that different States have different ideas of what \r\na strong deal means, but mistrust between countries \r\ncannot become a reason for failure, nor can economic \r\nconsiderations become an excuse for inaction. \r\n A/64/PV.8\r\n \r\n7 09-52470 \r\n \r\n Throughout the history of humankind, there have \r\nbeen examples of nations that disagreed coming \r\ntogether for their own survival during a crisis, be it \r\nduring a time of war, economic hardship or epidemic. \r\nToday, that crisis is climate change. There is simply no \r\nmore time to waste, and I will therefore stop here. Talk \r\nis cheap; action speaks louder than words. And we \r\nneed action. Let us go to Copenhagen to seal the deal. \r\nWe will all meet again in Copenhagen. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Russian): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Federated States of Micronesia for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Emanuel Mori, President of the Federated \r\nStates of Micronesia, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Denis Sassou Nguesso, President of \r\nthe Republic of the Congo. \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Russian): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of the Congo.  \r\n Mr. Denis Sassou Nguesso, President of the \r\nRepublic of the Congo, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Russian): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Denis Sassou Nguesso, President of the Republic \r\nof the Congo, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\n President Sassou Nguesso (spoke in French): I \r\nwould like at the outset to welcome the election of \r\nMr. Ali Treki to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-fourth session, which is taking \r\nplace at a time when major challenges continue to test \r\nthe effectiveness of our Organization. From this \r\nrostrum, I would also like to pay tribute to his \r\npredecessor, Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann, and to \r\nhis courageous and energetic actions throughout his \r\nterm. I also thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for \r\nhis exceptional work at the head of our Organization at \r\na time in history when important reforms are being \r\nundertaken. \r\n I wish to emphasize the extent to which, now \r\nmore than ever, the United Nations symbolizes hope in \r\nthe face of the major challenges threatening our planet, \r\nwhich no nation can meet alone. People have never had \r\nsuch need of that hope.  \r\n The Summit on Climate Change, held recently at \r\nthe initiative of the Secretary-General, called once \r\nagain upon the collective conscience of all nations \r\nlarge and small, united and stirred by a common \r\nresolve to work to build the better world of which the \r\nfounding fathers of our Organization dreamed. In this \r\nvillage that our world has become, we Members of the \r\nUnited Nations are the guarantors of people’s liberties \r\nand rights, their security and their future, their dignity \r\nand the promise of world peace. \r\n Mr. Hackett (Barbados), Vice-President, took the \r\nchair. \r\n I know what solidarity owes to the dedication of \r\nthe United Nations, and what peace owes to its actions, \r\ncommitment and determination. And I foresee what the \r\nfuture will owe it. It is here that are forged freedom \r\nand human rights, solidarity and universal justice — in \r\na word, the destiny of humankind. The men and women \r\nhere know that more than a billion people still live on \r\nless than a dollar a day and that children die \r\nunnecessarily of hunger and disease. All of us here \r\nknow how climate change is abetting these scourges \r\nand how the countries least responsible for it suffer the \r\nmost from its effects. Producing only 3.8 per cent of \r\ngreenhouse gas emissions, our continent is the most \r\naffected by global warming. Poor populations are its \r\nmain victims. The agriculture, fauna and infrastructure \r\nof coastal regions are on the front line. \r\n The Brundtland report of the World Commission \r\non Environment and Development (A/42/427, annex), \r\nsubmitted to the General Assembly in 1987, gave us, \r\nmore than 20 years ago, the following definition of \r\nsustainable development: “development that meets the \r\nneeds of the present without compromising the ability \r\nof future generations to meet their own needs” \r\n(Ibid., p. 54).  \r\n Sustainable development is not a concept, as we \r\nhave all learned at our own expense; it is an issue \r\nfraught with genuine responsibilities. The balance of \r\necosystems has never been so threatened. Urgent \r\nmeasures are required in Africa and in all nations to \r\nguarantee food security, combat drought and \r\ndesertification, and restore natural ecosystems. Such \r\nmeasures require the mobilization of significant \r\nresources.  \r\n \r\nA/64/PV.8  \r\n \r\n09-52470 8 \r\n \r\n Mr. Hackett (Barbados), Vice-President took the \r\nchair.  \r\n When one’s main resource is the forest, one bears \r\nan immense responsibility. We represent the Earth’s \r\nsecond most important environmental lung, after the \r\nAmazon. Together with our Latin American brothers, \r\nwe are aware of our responsibility as guardians of \r\nforests that represent an essential treasure for all \r\nhumankind. \r\n Since the 1990s, the Congo has worked \r\ncontinuously with the international community to \r\ncombat global warming and to implement a policy of \r\nforest protection. Today, our action is more essential \r\nthan ever. Our forests represent vast carbon sinks of \r\nglobal importance for regulating the greenhouse-gas \r\neffect. They are our common salvation and home to \r\n400 species of mammals, more than 1,000 species of \r\nbirds and more than 10,000 species of plants, 3,000 of \r\nwhich are endemic. Gorillas, forest buffaloes, \r\nchimpanzees, bonobos and forest elephants — these \r\nare what must inspire our action, as they help to \r\nmaintain the ecological functions of natural systems. \r\n In 1999, the countries of the Congo basin \r\nlaunched a unique forestry experiment by proclaiming \r\ntheir common resolve to preserve their biodiversity and \r\npromote the sustainable and joint management of their \r\nforest ecosystems, as well as by ensuring the use of \r\nresources for Central Africa’s economic and social \r\ndevelopment. The resulting plan is one of the strategic \r\ncomponents of the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment. It represents a significant contribution \r\nby Central Africa to the effort to address the problems \r\nrelated to global warming. Unfortunately, the funds \r\nnecessary for the programme’s implementation are still \r\nlacking.  \r\n The countries of the region have nonetheless \r\nmade great progress in forest preservation. Today, \r\nAfrica requests that the forthcoming Copenhagen \r\nConference consider mechanisms for adaptation, \r\nmitigation, capacity-building, technology transfer and \r\nfinancing based on the principle of equity. In \r\nCopenhagen, we must take earnest account of the \r\nforests, which represent carbon sinks of global \r\nimportance for regulating and stabilizing our planet’s \r\nclimate.  \r\n The economic and financial crisis, whose effects \r\nwe continue to feel, is the most serious economic \r\nrecession that the world has experienced since the \r\nGreat Depression of the 1930s. This crisis should help \r\nto raise our awareness. It justifies an overhaul of the \r\ninternational financial architecture and can enable us, \r\nthrough new commitments, to realize the vision of a \r\nmore unified and equitable world. But time is running \r\nout, in Africa more than elsewhere, and the adoption of \r\ndecisive measures can wait no longer. \r\n Halfway towards the deadline for achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, our success will \r\ndepend on the international community’s new choices \r\nand on the effective implementation of announced \r\nmeasures. The commitments undertaken at the April \r\n2009 London summit of the Group of 20 must be \r\nhonoured, and we hope that the meeting to be held in \r\nPittsburgh will fulfil all our expectations.  \r\n In its capacity as African Union co-mediator, \r\ntogether with Libya, of the crisis between Chad and the \r\nSudan, the Republic of the Congo welcomes the \r\nwillingness, expressed by both parties at the African \r\nUnion summit, to relaunch negotiations based on the \r\nDoha Agreement of 3 May 2009. We also note with \r\nsatisfaction that the tripartite initiative aimed at a joint \r\nsettlement in the subregion, with the assistance of the \r\nUnited Nations Peacebuilding Support Office in the \r\nCentral African Republic, the General Secretariat of \r\nthe Economic Community of Central African States, \r\nthe Commission of the Central African Economic and \r\nMonetary Community and the General Secretariat of \r\nthe Community of Sahelo-Saharan States, should \r\nenable us to curb the insecurity on the borders of \r\nCameroon, the Central African Republic and Chad for \r\nthe long term.  \r\n We welcome the significant progress seen \r\nrecently in relations among the countries of the Great \r\nLakes region on our continent. The warming of \r\nrelations between the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo and Rwanda, the revitalization of the Economic \r\nCommunity of the Great Lakes Countries, and the \r\nnormalization of relations between Uganda and the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo reflect the common \r\nwill of the Great Lakes countries to work to \r\nconsolidate peace.  \r\n With respect to the Israeli-Palestinian crisis, we \r\nencourage any initiative to promote sustained dialogue \r\nbetween the parties in the quest for a definitive and \r\nequitable solution to the crisis. \r\n We welcome the unanimous adoption, on \r\n24 September 2009 at the historic Security Council \r\n A/64/PV.8\r\n \r\n9 09-52470 \r\n \r\nsummit (see S/PV.6191), of resolution 1887 (2009), \r\nwhich reflects the determination of the international \r\ncommunity to work towards disarmament and nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation for a safer world. \r\n In the light of these many challenges, we call for \r\nstrict compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \r\nTreaty in all its aspects, including the right of all \r\ncountries to develop nuclear technologies for civilian \r\npurposes. \r\n The Congolese people renewed their confidence \r\nin me last July. That confidence is based on the concept \r\nthat we call the “path of the future”. That path proposes \r\nopening the Congo to modernization and \r\nindustrialization, to the pursuit of peacebuilding, the \r\nstrengthening of democracy and the rule of law, to the \r\npromotion of good governance and to the protection of \r\nhuman rights. We have pledged to open a new path to \r\nthe future and to mark it with proper behaviour and \r\nclean technologies. We have pledged in my country to \r\nnever sit on our hands and watch the Earth suffer. That \r\nis a promise which I repeat here. \r\n Our African storytellers have often said that men \r\nwere the dream of the Earth. I solemnly promise that \r\nnot only will Africans do everything in their power to \r\nnever become its nightmare; they will, on the contrary, \r\nopen up a gateway to the future for all of us. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof the Congo for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Denis Sassou Nguesso, President of the \r\nRepublic of the Congo, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by King Mswati III, Head of State of the \r\nKingdom of Swaziland \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by King Mswati III, Head of State of \r\nthe Kingdom of Swaziland. \r\n King Mswati III, Head of State of the Kingdom of \r\nSwaziland, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Majesty King Mswati III, Head of State of \r\nthe Kingdom of Swaziland, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly. \r\n King Mswati III: It is a pleasure for me to \r\naddress the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth \r\nsession. Our coming here as leaders gives us the \r\nopportunity to debate global challenges as per our \r\nobjectives and goals as enshrined in the United Nations \r\nCharter. \r\n The United Nations is a forum where we all come \r\ntogether to share ideas, review progress and come up \r\nwith strategies to deal with world issues that need our \r\nattention and input. The founders of this Organization \r\nhad a noble idea of addressing world issues amicably \r\nwith a view to avoiding confrontation. Therefore, we \r\nare supposed to meet as equal partners to debate issues \r\nthat affect us as the world community, in a forum \r\nwhere we are guided by the principles of trust, respect \r\nand natural justice. The aim of the United Nations is to \r\nbring joy and peace to the nations of the world. Let us \r\nmake sure that people develop confidence in the United \r\nNations so that they can approach the Organization \r\nwhen they have problems. \r\n We note that Africa has multiple problems that \r\nseriously hinder its progress in the areas of health, the \r\neconomy, poverty and social welfare, which all come \r\nunder the Millennium Development Goals. It is our aim \r\nas the African continent to evolve from being third \r\nworld countries to a first world status. That calls on \r\nus — Africa in general and Swaziland in particular — \r\nto work harder and smarter in order to realize that goal \r\nand generate a strong economy for the betterment of \r\nthe lives of all our peoples. \r\n However, we realize that we cannot effectively \r\ndeal with the challenges confronting us alone, mainly \r\nbecause our resources are limited. It is through the \r\nUnited Nations that we continue to forge partnerships \r\nwith different countries so that we work together to \r\ngrow our economies. We appeal to the developed \r\nnations to recognize our hard work and to increase our \r\naccess to soft loans and grants to support development \r\nprogrammes and poverty-reduction strategies. We call \r\non the United Nations to continue supporting national \r\ninitiatives aimed at eventually transforming our \r\neconomies to first world economies. \r\n However, the global financial and economic crisis \r\nhas made the situation difficult, especially for \r\ndeveloping countries. It restrains us from achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. \r\n The secondary effects of the crisis are now hitting \r\nhard on developing economies, like that of the \r\nA/64/PV.8  \r\n \r\n09-52470 10 \r\n \r\nKingdom of Swaziland, whose export trade is largely \r\ndependent on performance in developed global \r\nmarkets. In our case, several Government interventions \r\nhave been undertaken to rescue sectors such as the pulp \r\nand textile industries. Added to this is the need to \r\nmobilize resources and promote financial inclusion in \r\norder to stimulate economic growth at the grassroots \r\nlevel. In that regard, financial inclusion remains an \r\nimportant stimulus for poverty alleviation programmes \r\nin developing countries like the Kingdom of \r\nSwaziland.  \r\n We are encouraged by signs of recovery from the \r\ncrisis, and we are confident that the United Nations \r\nwill continue to play its leading role in the efforts to \r\nfind a speedy resolution to the situation so that we may \r\nall focus on development issues for the benefit of all \r\nour peoples. \r\n It is most unfortunate that while we do our level \r\nbest to improve our economies, we continue to be \r\nconfronted by disturbances and conflicts that include \r\nwars and coups. We condemn those acts, as they lead to \r\nuntold suffering for millions of our peoples. As nations \r\nof the world, let us come together and make sure that \r\nsuch acts are not supported or encouraged. We call \r\nupon all nations of the world to isolate and discourage \r\nthe sympathizers and sponsors. Where there are \r\nproblems, the peoples of the world must know that they \r\ncan address the challenges that they encounter through \r\npeaceful engagement and dialogue.  \r\n If we want to achieve peace in the world, it is \r\nimportant that we reduce and eventually eradicate \r\nnuclear arms, which pose a threat to our planet. We \r\nneed to encourage nations that are at the stage of \r\ndeveloping, and those that already possess, nuclear \r\ncapability to utilize it for power generation that \r\nsupports and stimulates economic growth. Therefore, \r\nwe encourage the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\nto continue to monitor countries that are developing \r\nnuclear arms so that they may be stopped. It must also \r\nensure that countries that already have nuclear \r\ncapability reduce and eventually eradicate their nuclear \r\narms so that they become a thing of the past. In order \r\nto accelerate the eradication of nuclear arms, the \r\nUnited Nations must set targets and timelines for \r\ncompliance. \r\n Another issue of concern is the continuing delay \r\nof the reform of the Security Council. Many nations \r\nhave come to the conclusion that the Council \r\nmembership needs to be expanded so that it is more \r\nrepresentative, so that its decisions may be owned by \r\nall Member States. \r\n Africa has adopted firm and clear resolutions on \r\nthe Council composition they would like to see. Those \r\ndecisions were further affirmed at the recent summit of \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement. Regrettably, we still have \r\nnot seen meaningful progress on that matter. We \r\ntherefore would like to call on all members of the \r\nSecurity Council to address that issue with the urgency \r\nthat it deserves. \r\n We are encouraged by the call made by fellow \r\nleaders for us to open a new page in the work of the \r\nUnited Nations by approaching global matters \r\ncollectively. It is imperative that the United Nations \r\ntake the lead in all issues that affect mankind. The \r\nreform of the Security Council is one such area that \r\ncould clearly demonstrate the new approach to issues. \r\n The Kingdom of Swaziland reiterates its support \r\nfor the efforts deployed by the international community \r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations towards a \r\npolitical solution to the issue of Western Sahara. We \r\nreaffirm that the initiative by the Kingdom of Morocco \r\nfor considerable autonomy for Western Sahara is the \r\nbeginning of a realistic and credible move. The \r\nKingdom of Swaziland calls upon all parties to join the \r\nprocess in order to implement Security Council \r\nresolutions 1813 (2008) and 1871 (2009).  \r\n The Kingdom of Swaziland continues to support \r\nefforts to bring lasting peace to the situation in the \r\nDarfur region, Somalia, Madagascar and other parts of \r\nour continent.  \r\n I take this opportunity to express my appreciation \r\nfor the support and assistance being extended to the \r\nInclusive Government and the people of the Republic \r\nof Zimbabwe by the nations of the world and by \r\ninternational organizations. I also wish to echo the call \r\nand appeal of the Southern African Development \r\nCommunity for the immediate removal of all sanctions \r\nagainst Zimbabwe, in order to ensure the speedy \r\nrecovery of the economy of that country for the benefit \r\nof its long-suffering people. \r\n As we gather here, we also wait with anticipation \r\nfor the outcome of the Israeli and Palestinian peace \r\nefforts. We have seen the two parties enter into \r\npromising peace agreements in the past that, \r\nregrettably, faltered along the way. We call upon the \r\n A/64/PV.8\r\n \r\n11 09-52470 \r\n \r\ntwo parties to continue to pursue peace to avoid loss of \r\nlife and to live in harmony. \r\n We are happy to acknowledge the improvements \r\nin the relations between the Republic of China on \r\nTaiwan and the People’s Republic of China. That new \r\ndevelopment has resulted in the international \r\ncommunity responding positively to the request of \r\nTaiwan to be involved in United Nations agencies, as \r\nevidenced by the granting of observer status in the \r\nWorld Health Assembly. We look forward to seeing \r\nTaiwan being allowed to fully contribute to humanity \r\nby being given adequate participation in other United \r\nNations specialized agencies. \r\n It is encouraging that this year’s General \r\nAssembly was preceded by the Summit on Climate \r\nChange, where issues of environmental protection were \r\ngiven priority, as they are critical to all our \r\ndevelopment strategies. The Summit noted that some \r\ndeveloped countries pollute the environment, mainly \r\nthrough gas emissions, despite all the protocols in \r\nplace to protect it. \r\n I am confident that the Summit was able to \r\nmobilize adequate political support to guide the \r\nConference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, to be held \r\nin Copenhagen in December, where developed \r\ncountries will be able to share their experiences and the \r\nchallenges that they faced. This will inform the agenda \r\nthat will lead to the transfer of skills and technology so \r\nthat, as developing countries pursue their growth, they \r\ncan avoid the mistakes of the past.  \r\n We cannot overemphasize the need to protect the \r\nenvironment, as it is a precious gift from God to \r\nhumanity and must be preserved for generations to \r\ncome. We support the call for the establishment of a \r\nmajor fund to cater to all projects related to climate \r\nchange. We are hopeful that Copenhagen will come up \r\nwith solutions for funding climate-change projects that \r\nwill be predictable, accessible and incremental. The \r\nKingdom of Swaziland is determined to work harder to \r\nmeet the targets set by the United Nations. \r\n In conclusion let me say that the Kingdom of \r\nSwaziland appreciates the good work of the United \r\nNations and its related agencies, which remain the only \r\nhope for overcoming the many complex challenges \r\nfacing the world today. We therefore take pride in \r\nreaffirming our commitment to the principles and \r\nideals contained in the United Nations Charter.  \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the King of Swaziland for \r\nthe statement he has just made. \r\n His Majesty King Mswati III, Head of State of the \r\nKingdom of Swaziland, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Elbegdorj Tsakhia, President \r\nof Mongolia \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of Mongolia. \r\n Mr. Elbegdorj Tsakhia, President of Mongolia, \r\nwas escorted into the General Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Elbegdorj Tsakhia, \r\nPresident of Mongolia, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\n President Tsakhia: Let me join others in \r\nextending our sincere congratulations to Mr. Ali \r\nAbdussalam Treki on his unanimous election to preside \r\nover this session of the General Assembly. I am \r\nconfident that under his able stewardship this session \r\nwill mark an important milestone in meeting the \r\nformidable challenges of our times. \r\n And the challenges we face as a human family \r\nare unprecedented indeed. No nation, no country is \r\nimmune to the ruthless grip of the multitude of global \r\ncrises: economy and finance, fuel and food, flu \r\npandemics and climate change. These and other global \r\nchallenges require global solutions underpinned by a \r\nnew multilateralism. Multilateralism that is effective, \r\nproactive and commensurate with today’s demands. \r\nNever has the world needed an effective \r\nmultilateralism as much as we do now; as the \r\nSecretary-General has rightly put it, “This is the \r\nultimate multilateral moment” (A/64/1, para. 4). \r\n Mongolia highly commends the strong leadership \r\nof Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in the effort to \r\nmake this Organization the centre of the new \r\nmultilateralism. We also applaud his unwavering \r\ncommitment to mobilizing broad political support to \r\naddress today’s pressing challenges. Thanks to his \r\ninitiative, on the 22nd of this month we witnessed an \r\nunprecedented gathering of world leaders. That has \r\nprovided the necessary political impetus for \r\nCopenhagen, and I was both humbled and honoured to \r\nA/64/PV.8  \r\n \r\n09-52470 12 \r\n \r\nserve as one of the co-chairs of the round tables. As a \r\nresult, we have all agreed that in Copenhagen we must \r\nreach the long-awaited agreement. The political will \r\nwas clearly displayed. The deal must be within our \r\ngrasp. \r\n Climate change poses a truly existential threat to \r\nhumanity. As a country intimately affected by climate \r\nchange, Mongolia deems it important to complement \r\nglobal efforts with those at regional and subregional \r\nlevels. With that in mind, we have proposed a \r\nNorth-east Asia Summit on Climate Change. A series \r\nof preparatory meetings have been held over the last \r\ntwo years, including meetings with experts and young \r\npeople, and with senior officials and ministers, in \r\nMarch and May respectively. \r\n It has become increasingly evident that extensive \r\neffects of climate change have already appeared in \r\nmost parts of the subregion, which has become more \r\nexposed to drought; desertification; reduced water \r\nresources; land degradation; increased occurrence of \r\nnatural disasters and melting of permafrost, glaciers \r\nand snow cover. The resulting poverty, food shortages \r\nand spread of infectious disease will have an increasing \r\neffect on the sustainable development of the countries \r\nin the region. Hence the urgent need for joint efforts to \r\nredress the situation, mitigate risks and enhance those \r\ncountries’ adaptive capacity. We remain hopeful that \r\nthey will continue their active engagement in the \r\npreparations for the Summit next year. \r\n Allow me to share briefly our views on issues we \r\ndeem important as we collectively seek to identify \r\neffective responses to the global crises. First, my \r\ndelegation believes that the multiple nature of the \r\ncrises has to be taken into account in order to find an \r\nadequate response at the global level. This in itself is a \r\ndaunting task, requiring of us the courage to rise \r\nbeyond mere national or group interests in order to \r\nsurvive collectively in our one — global — human \r\nvillage. \r\n Secondly, in all our policies and actions we need \r\nto focus on people — on the human costs of \r\novercoming the dire consequences of multiple crises. \r\nAccording to the World Bank’s latest report, released \r\nlast week, the ongoing global economic, financial and \r\nfood crises have plunged hundreds of millions more \r\npeople into the iron grip of poverty, hunger, \r\nunemployment, illiteracy and ill-health. \r\n Despite this grim situation we are nonetheless \r\nencouraged by a broadly shared recognition that the \r\nvulnerable countries, including landlocked developing \r\ncountries (LLDCs) ought to be assisted to withstand \r\nthe harsh impact of the crises. In this regard, we look \r\nforward to the Group of 20 meeting in Pittsburgh to \r\nsubstantially increase support and assistance to \r\nvulnerable and low-income countries. \r\n Every sixth Member of the United Nations is a \r\nlandlocked developing country with inherent \r\ndevelopment handicaps. Indeed, lack of territorial \r\naccess to the sea, remoteness from world markets and \r\nthe consequent high transportation costs and undue \r\ndelays are major impediments for LLDCs. Hence, \r\nMongolia, together with other like-minded countries, \r\nhas endeavoured to promote the common position and \r\ninterests of the Group of LLDCs at both the United \r\nNations and the World Trade Organization. The recent \r\nestablishment of an international think tank for LLDCs \r\nin Ulaanbaatar will, in our view, enhance our \r\ncoordinated efforts for the effective implementation of \r\nthe Almaty Programme of Action and the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). \r\n Thirdly, the marginalization and inadequate \r\nrepresentation of the developing world in global \r\ndecision-making constitute another drawback to the \r\nstrength of the new multilateralism. Hence the need for \r\na reformed global governance structure. Mongolia \r\nbelieves that, with its impartiality and universal \r\nlegitimacy, the United Nations is uniquely placed to \r\nserve as the centre of the new multilateralism. Our \r\nworld Organization has embarked on a process of \r\nreform in order to better respond to multifaceted \r\nchallenges. Important progress has been made in \r\nseveral reform areas, yet more efforts are needed to \r\nadapt the United Nations to the realities of the twenty-\r\nfirst century. \r\n We expect the General Assembly negotiations on \r\nSecurity Council reform to make meaningful progress \r\nat this session by meeting the demand of the \r\noverwhelming majority of Member States to expand \r\nthe Council in both the permanent and the \r\nnon-permanent categories. A revitalized General \r\nAssembly, a greater role for the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil in global economic governance and enhanced \r\nUnited Nations capacity in building democracy and \r\npeacebuilding are also needed. Mongolia fully supports \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s efforts to improve \r\n A/64/PV.8\r\n \r\n13 09-52470 \r\n \r\nthe management, efficiency and internal cohesion of \r\nthe United Nations system.  \r\n With a view to making our humble contribution \r\nto promoting effective international cooperation in the \r\neconomic, social and related fields, Mongolia has \r\nproposed its candidature for consideration at the \r\nelection next month for membership of the Economic \r\nand Social Council for 2010-2012. We are deeply \r\ngrateful to our fellow members of the Asian Group for \r\ntheir endorsement of our candidature and look forward \r\nto the kind support of the broader membership of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n Fourthly, in order to find effective solutions to \r\nglobal crises we need to do away with the triple \r\ndeficit — a deficit of political will and commitment; a \r\ndeficit of implementation; and a deficit of resources — \r\nthat all too often has impeded the pursuit of our \r\ncommon efforts. Those are some of the issues that in \r\nour view warrant the consideration of the international \r\ncommunity in order to formulate our collective \r\napproach to the pressing challenges at hand. \r\n Mongolia has continuously based its foreign \r\npolicy on active participation in multilateral \r\ncooperation through the United Nations. Our \r\nengagement has ranged from non-proliferation and \r\ndisarmament to promoting democracy and literacy and \r\nfrom addressing the special needs of LLDCs to \r\nresponding to climate change and contributing to \r\npeacekeeping operations, programmes and funds. \r\n As a North-East Asian nation with an \r\ninternationally recognized nuclear-weapon-free status, \r\nMongolia stands for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean \r\npeninsula. Achieving a comprehensive solution to the \r\nnuclear issue through dialogue is of utmost importance. \r\nWe hope that all countries concerned will look to the \r\nfuture in the interest of peace and stability in the \r\nregion. We stand ready to contribute to this effort. \r\n Yesterday the international community witnessed \r\nanother strong signal of strengthened multilateralism, \r\nparticularly in the area of nuclear disarmament and \r\nnon-proliferation. The Security Council summit \r\nchaired by President Obama (see S/PV.6191) \r\nconfirmed the path towards a world free of nuclear \r\nweapons by adopting the historic resolution \r\n1887 (2009). \r\n Next year will mark the tenth anniversary of the \r\nrenowned Brahimi report (A/55/305), which charted a \r\nrenewed vision for United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations. We are proud that Mongolia has joined the \r\nranks of active members of the United Nations \r\npeacekeeping family. With its latest deployment of a \r\nbattalion to the United Nations Mission in the Central \r\nAfrican Republic and Chad, we have become one of \r\nthe top 20 troop contributors. Mongolia stands \r\ncommitted to enhancing its contribution, including \r\nthrough hosting training for civil police and medical \r\npersonnel at its peacekeeping operations training \r\ncentre. \r\n Later this year we will observe the twentieth \r\nanniversary of the start of the democratic evolution in \r\nmy home country. Mongolia is proud of its successful \r\ndemocratic transition and major gains in the political, \r\neconomic, social and spiritual areas of the life of our \r\nsociety. Yet, as a young democracy, my country is also \r\nintimately aware of the complex challenges faced by \r\ncountries in transition. Democracy and respect for \r\nhuman rights are, in our view, inherently woven into \r\nthe MDGs. Proceeding from this premise, Mongolia \r\nwas the first country to adopt, in 2005, its own ninth \r\nMDG, on strengthening human rights, fostering \r\ndemocratic governance and zero tolerance to \r\ncorruption. \r\n We believe in international cooperation and \r\nsupport for democratization efforts. In this regard, \r\nMongolia applauds the increased role of the United \r\nNations in fostering democracy and good governance. \r\nThe United Nations Democracy Fund is a notable \r\nexample and Mongolia is proud to serve on its \r\nAdvisory Board. The United Nations has also been an \r\nimportant stakeholder in the success of the new or \r\nrestored democracies process. \r\n Over the past nearly five decades of Mongolia’s \r\nmembership in the United Nations, our multifaceted \r\ncooperation has made a valuable contribution to our \r\ndevelopment. I am pleased to underscore that this \r\nreceived a considerable boost from the official visit to \r\nMongolia of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon last July. \r\nWe will closely work with the United Nations to ensure \r\neffective follow-up to the visit. \r\n In conclusion, I reiterate Mongolia’s strong \r\nresolve to continue its active participation in \r\nmultilateral cooperation. We will spare no effort to \r\nensure that the world Organization remains a centre for \r\ncoordination of the efforts of the community of nations \r\ntowards peace and development in the years to come. \r\nA/64/PV.8  \r\n \r\n09-52470 14 \r\n \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of Mongolia \r\nfor the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Elbegdorj Tsakhia, President of Mongolia, \r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Paul Biya, President of the Republic \r\nof Cameroon \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nCameroon. \r\n Mr. Paul Biya, President of the Republic of \r\nCameroon, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Paul Biya, President of the \r\nRepublic of Cameroon, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\n President Biya (spoke in French): I would like to \r\nbegin by extending my congratulations to Mr. Ali Treki \r\non his election to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at this sixty-fourth session and by wishing \r\nhim every success in the execution of his term of \r\noffice. Allow me also to pay tribute to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his tireless work and for the \r\nremarkable devotion that he has demonstrated at the \r\nhelm of our Organization. \r\n Like each year, we are asked during this session \r\nto look at the state of the world, to consider together \r\nthe current problems and to recommend appropriate \r\nsolutions to them. In that regard, as we know, the \r\ninternational community remains under the impact of a \r\nglobal financial and economic crisis that has spared no \r\ncountry. \r\n The extraordinary mobilization that it has aroused \r\nreflects its scope and extent, as well as the gravity of \r\nthe threat that it poses to the stability of the global \r\neconomy. We must welcome that strong mobilization, \r\nled by the major industrialized countries. It was \r\nprompt, resolute and consistent. Without doubt, it has \r\ndemonstrated the international community’s capacity to \r\nrespond fully when it is driven and underpinned by real \r\npolitical resolve. \r\n That is certainly a good example of solidarity, the \r\nkind of international solidarity that we seek and that \r\nwe would like also to see in the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, in our common \r\nconcern to narrow the gap between the North and the \r\nSouth, and in our daily struggle against poverty, hunger \r\nand pandemics. \r\n In other words, if we have been able to mobilize \r\nourselves so vigorously to contain the effects of the \r\nfinancial crisis, we can do the same to address the \r\nother challenges confronting us, namely the poverty \r\nand underdevelopment in which so many human beings \r\nthroughout the world still live. For, while the crisis has \r\nspared no continent, there is no doubt that its effects \r\nvary depending on the country, region and level of \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Africa, in particular, which in no way contributed \r\nto the unleashing of the crisis, today, paradoxically, \r\nfinds itself among the worst affected victims. Among \r\nthe most alarming effects, we therefore condemn the \r\ndecrease in remittances to our countries; the severe \r\ndrop in the prices of our products; the marked fall in \r\ninvestment; worsening budget deficits; and the \r\nslowdown in economic activity — all of which, among \r\nother things, also have severe social consequences, \r\nsuch as a rise in unemployment. Furthermore, there is \r\nreason to fear that the continuation of the crisis will \r\nonly increase the debt of developing countries. \r\n We find ourselves facing new difficulties just as \r\nwe are emerging from lengthy years of economic \r\nrecovery efforts under rigorous structural adjustment \r\nprogrammes, resolutely implemented by our States in \r\ncooperation with the international financial \r\ninstitutions. Neither our efforts nor our sacrifices have \r\nbeen in vain, and we believe that our gains, which are \r\nthe fruit of the commendable efforts of our peoples, \r\nmust unquestionably be preserved and supported. \r\n The President took the Chair. \r\n That is why we believe that, faced with the \r\nharmful effects of the crisis, it is important that we all \r\nwork together towards a global, coordinated and \r\nsignificant response for the benefit of the weakest \r\neconomies. In our view, that response should lead to \r\nthe provision of substantial financial resources free, as \r\nfar as possible, of conditionality and aimed at \r\nmitigating or even compensating for the consequences \r\nof a crisis that we could not avert. \r\n Without such support, our developing countries \r\nrun the risk of seeing their economic activity decrease \r\n A/64/PV.8\r\n \r\n15 09-52470 \r\n \r\nand the signs of the revival that they could reasonably \r\nhope for disappear. It is evident that, over and above \r\ndevelopment and improved living conditions, the peace \r\nand stability of our countries depend on it. That also \r\nholds true for international peace and security, \r\ninasmuch as the numerous problems confronting the \r\nworld today — be it, for example, illegal immigration \r\nor trafficking of every kind — arise partly from a real \r\nlack of cooperation and solidarity, and thus call for \r\ngreater justice in international relations. \r\n In that connection, I welcome the fortuitous \r\ndecision taken in London in April by the Group of 20 \r\nto recommend that the International Monetary Fund \r\n(IMF) support the weakest economies through more \r\nand softer loans, possibly with less conditionality. \r\nMoreover, in that context, my country, Cameroon, \r\nbenefited from substantial financial support from the \r\nIMF under the Exogenous Shocks Facility. I welcome \r\nthat support, and take this opportunity to thank \r\nInternational Monetary Fund officials. That timely \r\nsupport will strengthen the anticyclical measures that \r\nwe have adopted at the national and subregional levels, \r\nfully aware that foreign aid is merely a buttress that \r\nshould not replace our own efforts.  \r\n Accordingly, in Cameroon, we have, inter alia, \r\nstrengthened the productive sectors and taken action to \r\nreduce the prices of basic commodities and improve \r\nthe business climate. In the subregion, member \r\ncountries of the Central African Economic and \r\nMonetary Community have agreed to adopt tax \r\nincentives and to establish a support fund for the \r\nsectors most affected by the crisis. Thus, while \r\nwelcoming assistance from the international \r\ncommunity, we are aware that it can bear fruit only if \r\nbased on stringent management and good governance \r\ncentred on the primacy of the public interest.  \r\n Moreover, it was in that spirit that a few years \r\nback I recommended from this rostrum the \r\nestablishment within the United Nations of a global \r\nethics committee, for it is a combination of moral drift \r\nand serious ethical deviations that is at the root of the \r\ncurrent global financial crisis. We trust that, in the near \r\nfuture, we will surmount the crisis through collective \r\nawareness and mobilization.  \r\n However, alongside with the financial and \r\neconomic crisis, we are concerned about other \r\nimportant matters. The food crisis is still ravaging \r\nmany developing countries. The poverty reduction \r\nstruggle is far from being won. Global peace and \r\nsecurity are still threatened worldwide, particularly in \r\nAfrica. Climate change is each day becoming \r\nincreasingly worrisome, with visible consequences in \r\nevery country.  \r\n Regarding climate change in particular, Africa, \r\nlike other continents, has been hard hit despite its low \r\nlevel of greenhouse gas emissions. Global warming, its \r\nmost salient feature, affects many socio-economic \r\nsectors, including energy, health, agriculture, livestock \r\nproduction, ecosystems and rapid desertification. In \r\nthis regard, the spectacular drying up of Lake Chad, the \r\nsurface of which has shrunk from 26,000 square \r\nkilometres in the 1960s to 1,500 square kilometres \r\ntoday, clearly requires significant collective action of \r\nthe Central African States which, in our opinion, needs \r\nstrong support from the international community. One \r\nthing is certain: African countries are individually and \r\ncollectively pulling their full weight in the activity \r\nnecessary at the national, subregional and global levels \r\nto provide concrete solutions to the challenge of \r\nclimate change.  \r\n Such participation is significant. In Cameroon, it \r\nhas taken the form of numerous actions, including the \r\nestablishment of a national environmental management \r\nplan and the adoption at the subregional level of a \r\nconvergence plan for the sustainable management of \r\nthe Congo basin forest which, we are all aware, is the \r\nworld’s second largest. \r\n The implementation of all these measures is very \r\ncostly, especially in terms of acquiring adapted \r\ntechnologies, and requires our people to accept huge \r\nsacrifices. Furthermore, without denying the fact that \r\nthe fate and future of the planet are everyone’s \r\nbusiness, it seems legitimate, in my opinion, to ask that \r\nthe peoples of Africa be duly compensated by the \r\ninternational community for their efforts and sacrifices. \r\nIn this regard, we hope that the Copenhagen climate \r\nconference scheduled for December will provide \r\nsatisfactory answers to the particular case of Africa. \r\n Regarding world peace and security, we continue \r\nto deplore the persistence of numerous conflicts or \r\nhotbeds of tension, despite significant progress towards \r\na return to calm. I refer to the situations in the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Darfur and Somalia, \r\namong others. Cameroon is playing an active role, \r\nincluding by dispatching Cameroonian contingents, in \r\nA/64/PV.8  \r\n \r\n09-52470 16 \r\n \r\nthe efforts to find lasting solutions to these conflicts, \r\nwhich have lasted too long. \r\n In this respect, I wish to hail the role of the \r\nUnited Nations, which is making tireless efforts to \r\nstabilize all these situations. However, if it is to be \r\nmore effective, the United Nations requires \r\ncommensurate human, financial and material resources. \r\nFurthermore, the United Nations should be able to \r\nreflect the common will of all its Members, large and \r\nsmall, in order to ensure its effectiveness and \r\ncredibility. It must more clearly assert and further \r\nstrengthen its role as the crucible par excellence of \r\nmultilateralism, that is, a forum for the exchange of \r\nideas, solidarity, equity and equality where all the \r\nvoices and opinions of developed and developing \r\ncountries alike are expressed and taken into account. \r\n These values go hand in hand with the dialogue \r\nof civilizations proposed for our consideration at this \r\nsession. Such a dialogue should not ignore differences, \r\nbut rather promote diversity so as to foster knowledge \r\nand mutual understanding among peoples. From this \r\nperspective, the dialogue of civilizations or cultures \r\nadvocates tolerance and mutual respect and rejects all \r\nforms of fanaticism that threaten international peace \r\nand security. \r\n That is the dual role that the United Nations, a \r\nproving ground for multilateralism and crucible of the \r\ndialogue of civilizations, must assume if it seeks to \r\nembody the noblest and deepest aspirations of \r\nhumankind and satisfy our peoples’ expectations with \r\ncomprehensive and relevant solutions. \r\n But the question is, how can the United Nations \r\nfulfil this role if it does not adapt to the current trends \r\nand changes in international relations? That is the \r\npurpose of the recommendations we have been making \r\nfor the reform of the Security Council, the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly and the \r\nstrengthening of the means of action of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. We therefore need to fast-track the overhaul \r\nof an Organization that, through its universal nature, \r\nsymbolizes our common destiny and seeks to be our \r\ncommon abode. For only a renewed United Nations \r\nthat is more democratic, more credible and more \r\nefficient will be able to inspire peoples’ hopes and \r\ntrust. \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Republic of Cameroon for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n Mr. Paul Biya, President of the Republic of \r\nCameroon, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.  \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Nguyen Minh Triet, President of the \r\nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Socialist Republic of \r\nViet Nam. \r\n Mr. Nguyen Minh Triet, President of the Socialist \r\nRepublic of Viet Nam, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Nguyen Minh Triet, \r\nPresident of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.  \r\n President Nguyen Minh Triet (spoke in \r\nVietnamese; English interpretation provided by the \r\ndelegation): On behalf of the Vietnamese delegation, I \r\nwish to congratulate you, Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, on \r\nyour election as President of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-fourth session. I believe that with your rich \r\nexperience, you will lead the Assembly at this session \r\nto great success. Viet Nam commends you, Sir, for the \r\ntheme you proposed for this high-level general debate, \r\nnamely, effective responses to global crises — \r\nstrengthening multilateralism and dialogue among \r\ncivilizations for international peace, security and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n I further wish to express our high appreciation to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann for \r\nhis contributions to the work of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-third session. \r\n The year since the Assembly’s sixty-third session \r\nhas not been a long span of time, yet it has been \r\ncharacterized by the many challenges it brought to the \r\nentire international community. Every part of the world \r\nhas suffered from the negative and far-reaching \r\nimpacts of the global financial crisis and economic \r\ndownturn. That further aggravates the challenges in \r\nterms of food security, energy security and climate \r\nchange facing developing countries in particular. In the \r\nmeantime, tension and conflicts persist in various \r\nregions, and the threats of the proliferation of weapons \r\n A/64/PV.8\r\n \r\n17 09-52470 \r\n \r\nof mass destruction and of international terrorism \r\ncontinue to demand effective responses. \r\n Because of all this, the past year has also \r\nwitnessed enormous efforts on the part of the \r\ninternational community, both in thinking and in \r\naction, not only to address the immediate problems but \r\nalso to create a more sustainable foundation for \r\ncommon peace and prosperity. In due course, nations \r\nhave been able to draw valuable lessons on governance \r\nover domestic development and to gain a fuller \r\nunderstanding of the meaning of multilateral \r\ncooperation. It is evident that no single country could \r\nrespond to the financial and economic crisis and to the \r\nseries of current global challenges. It is equally evident \r\nthat policies and measures of imposition and unilateral \r\nuse of force to address international security and \r\npolitical issues would only result in more tension, \r\nconfrontation and impasse. \r\n Given the many difficulties at the present time, \r\nwe are encouraged by recent positive — although not \r\nsolid — signals from the world economy. The first \r\nsummit of the Security Council on nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation and nuclear disarmament has \r\nhighlighted the question of disarmament on the \r\ninternational agenda. Viet Nam recognizes the active \r\ncontributions of the United Nations and the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in the furtherance of discussions on and direct \r\nsupport for the implementation of concrete measures in \r\nrelation to issues of international concern. In this \r\nconnection, Viet Nam hopes that this Assembly will \r\nfocus its deliberations on the following issues. \r\n Respect for the fundamental principles of \r\ninternational law and the United Nations Charter in \r\ninternational relations is the determining factor for \r\npeace and security and a prerequisite for all the \r\nactivities undertaken by the international community. \r\nOn that basis, the United Nations should continue to \r\nmake active contributions to easing tension and \r\npeacefully resolving outstanding disputes and conflicts, \r\nincluding those relating to the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea and Iran.  \r\n It is Viet Nam’s hope that early progress will be \r\nmade in the negotiations for a peaceful, \r\ncomprehensive, just and lasting solution in the Middle \r\nEast on the basis of ensuring the fundamental national \r\nrights of the Palestinian people and the legitimate \r\ninterests of all parties concerned. We fully support the \r\nnational reconciliation and reconstruction process in \r\nAfghanistan and Iraq and strongly condemn terrorist \r\nacts against civilians in those countries and in other \r\nplaces in the world. We oppose the unilateral use of \r\neconomic sanctions against developing countries and \r\nsupport the General Assembly resolutions on the \r\nnecessity of immediately ending the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed against \r\nCuba. \r\n An effective and comprehensive response to \r\ntoday’s economic and financial crisis is the top concern \r\nof the international community. In the immediate term, \r\nthat includes urgent measures to curb the pace of the \r\ndownturn, encourage an early recovery of the world \r\neconomy and minimize the negative impacts of the \r\ncrisis, particularly on the realization of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals in developing countries.  \r\n In the long run, the response will embrace \r\nconsiderations of development paradigms suitable for \r\nindividual nations and reforms of the international \r\nsystem of economic relations, which has for quite a \r\nwhile shown many irrationalities. It is also imperative \r\nto promote the role of the United Nations in designing \r\ninternational strategies and mechanisms to address the \r\nenergy and food crisis, pandemics and climate change, \r\nincluding issues to be discussed at the Climate Change \r\nConference in Copenhagen this December. \r\n The United Nations reform process should also \r\ncontinue to meet the emerging, complex requirements. \r\nViet Nam shares the common view that reform should \r\nbe undertaken in all United Nations agencies, with \r\nSecurity Council reform conducted in such a way as to \r\nbroaden its representation and render its operational \r\nmethodology more democratic and transparent. Efforts \r\nto reform the machinery should go hand in hand with \r\nefforts to renew content and to pay due attention to the \r\nbalance among the fields of activity of the United \r\nNations. United Nations operations should also be \r\nprovided with sufficient resources. \r\n Next year, Member States will commemorate the \r\nsixty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations, while \r\nalso reviewing the Organization’s activities and the \r\n10-year implementation of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). To prepare the ground \r\nfor recommendations to be submitted to the leaders of \r\nMember States at the sixty-fifth session, we need to \r\ndiscuss what lessons can be drawn from United \r\nNations activities in all spheres, what activities should \r\nbe prioritized and what conditions are necessary for the \r\nA/64/PV.8  \r\n \r\n09-52470 18 \r\n \r\nOrganization fully to carry out its mandates and \r\nfunctions in the interest of all nations. \r\n In the recent past, Viet Nam has continued to \r\nrecord major achievements in the process of renewal, \r\nin general, and initial positive gains in response to the \r\nimpact of the global economic and financial crisis, in \r\nparticular. We have also been successful in our foreign \r\npolicy, which is based on openness and strives to \r\ndiversify and ensure the multilateral character of our \r\nexternal relations in the spirit of being a friend and \r\nreliable partner of all nations and an active, \r\nconstructive, cooperative and responsible member of \r\nthe international community. \r\n As a non-permanent member of the Security \r\nCouncil, we have been an active participant in and an \r\neffective and responsible contributor to the \r\nmaintenance of world peace and security. As a peace-\r\nloving nation, Viet Nam always strongly supports and \r\ncontributes to the peaceful settlement of international \r\ndisputes and conflicts, the fight against transnational \r\ncrime and international terrorism, and the promotion of \r\ndisarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of \r\nmass destruction. As a country that experienced \r\ndecades of war with devastating consequences, \r\nincluding the long-term effects of the Agent Orange \r\ntoxic chemical, and as a country that has made \r\nimportant achievements in development, Viet Nam has \r\nalways striven towards the effective Security Council \r\naction in supporting reconstruction efforts in countries \r\nemerging from conflict. \r\n In its work, Viet Nam sets high store by \r\nconsultation and cooperation with other members of \r\nthe Security Council and the United Nations, as shown \r\nby our initiative to consult Member States on the latest \r\nannual report of the Security Council. I would like to \r\ntake this opportunity to express our sincere gratitude \r\nand appreciation to all Member States for their \r\ncooperation, without which Viet Nam would not have \r\naccomplished this undertaking. \r\n In the future, Viet Nam will continue to work \r\nactively for world peace, stability, cooperation and \r\ndevelopment, thus contributing to efforts of the United \r\nNations and the international community in \r\naccelerating the resolution of social issues and global \r\nchallenges, as well as the implementation of \r\ndevelopment programmes and the Delivering as One \r\ninitiative. \r\n This session of the General Assembly is taking \r\nplace at a crucial juncture. During 2009, the world has \r\nwitnessed many significant changes, which have \r\ndemanded corresponding policy decisions from us. I \r\nbelieve that only by standing shoulder to shoulder to \r\nenhance multilateral cooperation can we, as \r\nresponsible leaders, meet the expectations and \r\naspirations of our peoples and map out a path for the \r\nlong-term development of the United Nations. Viet \r\nNam will always be a supportive, active and \r\nresponsible participant in this noble mission. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Socialist \r\nRepublic of Viet Nam for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n Mr. Nguyen Minh Triet, President of the Socialist \r\nRepublic of Viet Nam, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Andry Nirina Rajoelina, President \r\nof the High Transitional Authority of the Republic \r\nof Madagascar \r\n \r\n The President: The General Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by Mr. Andry Nirina Rajoelina, \r\nPresident of the High Transitional Authority of the \r\nRepublic of Madagascar. \r\n I give the floor to the Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo on a point of \r\norder. \r\n Mr. Mwamba (Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo) (spoke in French): I am taking the floor on \r\nbehalf of the Southern African Development \r\nCommunity (SADC), comprising Angola, Botswana, \r\nLesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, \r\nSeychelles, South Africa, Swaziland, the United \r\nRepublic of Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe and my \r\ncountry, the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The \r\nComoros associates itself with the present motion on a \r\npoint of order. \r\n Under rule 71 of the rules of procedure of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, SADC would like to express its \r\nstrong protest at the decision to invite Mr. Andry \r\nNirina Rajoelina to take the floor during the general \r\ndebate of the Assembly and to invite the Republic of \r\nMadagascar to participate in the work of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-fourth session. \r\n A/64/PV.8\r\n \r\n19 09-52470 \r\n \r\n With respect to Mr. Andry Nirina Rajoelina, I \r\nshould like to remind the Assembly of the decision of \r\nthe heads of State and Government of SADC, who met \r\nat a summit in Kinshasa on 8 September 2009. They, \r\nfirst, noted with concern the attempt to damage the \r\nagreements signed by all of the Malagasy political \r\nmovements in Maputo on 9 August 2009. Secondly, \r\nthey rejected and condemned in strong terms any \r\nunilateral decision which would violate the spirit of the \r\nMaputo Accords. The heads of State and Government \r\nalso reiterated their decision to suspend Madagascar \r\nfrom SADC until constitutional order is restored in the \r\ncountry. Thirdly, they further reiterated their support \r\nfor the ongoing political dialogue in Madagascar and \r\nurged all political actors to fully respect the Maputo \r\nAccords. \r\n SADC is making efforts to re-establish \r\nconstitutional order in that country. To achieve this \r\nend, it has placed its full trust in His Excellency \r\nPresident Joaquim Chissano, an eminent figure and \r\nmediator for political dialogue in Madagascar. \r\n With respect to the Republic of Madagascar as a \r\ncountry, I should like to recall that in March 2009, \r\nSADC decided not to recognize the self-proclaimed \r\nMalagasy Government. SADC rather began a \r\nmediation process aimed at returning constitutional \r\norder to the country. As long as that constitutional \r\norder is not re-established, SADC will never recognize \r\nthe current Government of Madagascar.  \r\n For the same reasons that motivated SADC’s \r\nposition, the African Union, which is chaired by your \r\ncountry, Mr. President, has suspended Madagascar \r\nfrom participation in the work of the African Union \r\nsince March 2009. This was done in accordance with \r\nthe relevant provisions of the Union’s Constitutive Act, \r\nwhich condemn and reject anti-constitutional changes \r\nof government. The African Union therefore called on \r\nthe international community as a whole to support the \r\napplication of this decision. It called for a return to \r\nconstitutional legality by means of subjecting the \r\nleaders of Madagascar, including Mr. Andry Nirina \r\nRajoelina, who is present here, to sanctions. Moreover, \r\nduring its most recent summit, held in Sharm \r\nel-Sheikh, the Non-Aligned Movement refused to give \r\nthe floor to Madagascar. \r\n Madagascar is represented at this session of the \r\nAssembly by persons who are without standing, who \r\ngained power through a coup. SADC therefore calls on \r\nthe Credentials Committee to meet at the earliest \r\nopportunity and take a decision on this matter. \r\n SADC calls on all members of the General \r\nAssembly who share our values to provide us their \r\ninvaluable support. We ask them to take a stand \r\nimmediately on the procedural motion which aims to \r\nprevent the Malagasy delegation led by Mr. Andry \r\nNirina Rajoelina from participating in the general \r\ndebate at the sixty-fourth session of the Assembly. But \r\nif the floor is nonetheless given to him, we would like \r\nto urge all Member States to continue to manifest their \r\nsupport for us by rising and exiting the room. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I should like to \r\ninform the Assembly of the following. I was contacted \r\nyesterday by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the \r\ncountries of the Southern African Development \r\nCommunity (SADC), who requested me to prohibit \r\nMr. Rajoelina from taking the floor. A representative of \r\nthe Legal Counsel was present at that meeting. The \r\nresponse of the representative of the Legal Counsel \r\nwas that as President I could defer giving \r\nMr. Rajoelina the floor for a time, but could not \r\nprohibit him from taking the floor altogether. \r\n There was certainly no contact with SADC. \r\nSADC did not contact the Secretariat in advance to \r\ndraw attention to the fact that Mr. Rajoelina was not \r\nrecognized by their organization. Because the African \r\nUnion had taken a decision to freeze Madagascar’s \r\nmembership and had not endorsed either the previous \r\nregime or the new regime, Madagascar’s seat in the \r\nAfrican Union had remained empty.  \r\n Following this discussion, there was a decision, \r\nand my brothers from SADC proposed a solution: to \r\ndefer Mr. Rajoelina’s statement to the end of the list of \r\nspeakers who are at the heads of State level, and that, \r\nbefore he took the floor, the Chairperson of SADC, the \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, or someone else, would raise a \r\npoint of order with respect to this subject. That is the \r\nagreement we came to.  \r\n In the light of this, I had three meetings with \r\nMr. Rajoelina, and for my part I tried to convince him \r\nto distribute the text of his address and perhaps not to \r\ntake the floor, because I did not want there to be any \r\nsplit among Africans or for African subjects to be dealt \r\nwith by others. A contact group was duly established. \r\nThe African Union supported SADC. The group has \r\nmet regularly and tried to find a solution to this \r\nA/64/PV.8  \r\n \r\n09-52470 20 \r\n \r\nproblem by inviting the concerned parties to meet and \r\nagree on a solution. We did the same thing with respect \r\nto both Mauritania and Guinea.  \r\n The position of the African Union with respect to \r\nmilitary coups is clear: we automatically freeze any \r\nregime that comes to power through a military coup. \r\nBut in the past we did not contact the United Nations to \r\nsuggest that it follow a similar course of action: \r\ndirectly prohibiting any delegation. Guinea is still \r\npresent with us, and Mauritania was with us at the time \r\nwhen Africa had stopped its contact with that country.  \r\n My brothers from SADC, the United Republic of \r\nTanzania and Zambia requested in an unsigned letter to \r\nthe President of the General Assembly that the \r\nCredentials Committee meet today, 25 September. I \r\nhave been informed by the Secretariat that the \r\nCredentials Committee may meet tomorrow to take a \r\ndecision on this request. In accordance with the \r\npractice followed in the United Nations, when the \r\nAssembly is meeting for the general debate, it usually \r\ndoes not consider other subjects. That means that the \r\nGeneral Assembly may not meet upon submission of \r\nthe report of the Credentials Committee unless this \r\noccurred after the end of the general debate.  \r\n Thus, any recommendation, be it positive or \r\nnegative, by the Credentials Committee would be \r\npresented for discussion in the General Assembly only \r\nfollowing the general debate.  The decision to be taken \r\nby the General Assembly will be carried out with \r\nrespect to Madagascar as a delegation as well as \r\nMadagascar’s presence within the United Nations for \r\nthe time being. That is the legal situation at the present \r\nmoment. \r\n The Office of Legal Affairs has made a \r\nrecommendation. Let me read out the notes submitted \r\nto me by the Legal Counsel of the United Nations: \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n  “During the discussion of any matter, a \r\nrepresentative may rise to a point of order, and \r\nthe point of order shall be immediately decided \r\nby the President in accordance with the rules of \r\nprocedure.” \r\n The notes then make reference to rules 29 and 35 \r\nof the rules of procedure. There are a number of other \r\nreferences here as well.  \r\n Following rule 29 of the rules of the procedure, it \r\nis my understanding that His Excellency Mr. Andry \r\nNirina Rajoelina may be given the floor. That is also \r\nmy ruling. If any Member State wishes to appeal that \r\nruling, then they should indicate that now and it will be \r\nput to the vote.  \r\n I give the floor to the Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo. \r\n Mr. Mwamba (Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo) (spoke in French): I had invoked rule 71 of the \r\nsame document, the rules of procedure of the General \r\nAssembly. I have taken note of your decision, \r\nMr. President, and the Southern African Development \r\nCommunity (SADC) has taken note of your decision. \r\nSADC continues to believe, for the reasons that we \r\noutlined, that the delegation led by Mr. Rajoelina \r\nshould not participate in the general debate. \r\n Also, in accordance with rule 71 of the rules of \r\nprocedure of the General Assembly, we appeal your \r\ndecision and ask that our motion to prevent the \r\ndelegation of Madagascar led by Mr. Rajoelina from \r\nparticipating in the general debate be put to the vote. I \r\ninvite members of SADC and those who support us to \r\nspeak out if you, Mr. President, maintain your intention \r\nto give the floor to Mr. Rajoelina. This approach is in \r\nline with the rules of procedure.  \r\n The President: I give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Guinea-Bissau on a point of order. \r\n Mr. Cabral (Guinea-Bissau) (spoke in French): I \r\nshould like to say with great emphasis that, without \r\nprejudice to the arguments presented by the \r\nrepresentative of the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo, I was astonished to hear rule 71 be invoked. \r\nWhat is the matter we are discussing here? Is the \r\nrepresentation of Madagascar on the agenda? That is \r\nthe question I pose. Rule 71 is very clear. Rule 71 \r\nstipulates that, I should like to recall, it comes into play \r\n“During the discussion of any matter”. Is the matter the \r\nrepresentation of Madagascar on the agenda? Are we \r\nnow considering the question of the representation of \r\nMadagascar? That is the first question that needs to be \r\ndealt with before any decision is taken. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I think the \r\nsituation is clear. We are presented with a problem. I \r\nhave explained our position very clearly. There has \r\nbeen a divergence of views, and we are now faced with \r\na situation.  \r\n A/64/PV.8\r\n \r\n21 09-52470 \r\n \r\n The United Nations invited the representative of \r\nMadagascar. The Legal Counsel holds the view that the \r\ndelegation of Madagascar should be given the floor, \r\nand I am of the view that what the Legal Counsel has \r\nsuggested is the preferable course of action. We are \r\nawaiting the view of the Credentials Committee. The \r\nGeneral Assembly will continue its work on this when \r\nit has received the recommendation of that Committee. \r\nBut for the time being, we must give the speaker the \r\nopportunity to proceed with his address.  \r\n I shall now put to the vote the question of \r\nwhether or not Mr. Rajoelina should proceed with his \r\naddress, now that we have heard the position of the \r\nSouthern African Development Community. \r\n I give the floor to the representative of the \r\nSecretariat. \r\n Mr. Shaaban (Under-Secretary-General for \r\nGeneral Assembly and Conference Management): The \r\nAssembly is now voting on the ruling by the President \r\nto give the floor to the representative of Madagascar. \r\n The President: I give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of Jamaica on a point of order.  \r\n Mr. Wolfe (Jamaica): Many of us were waiting to \r\nhear exactly how the motion would be put. There is \r\nusually a pause, when the motion is put very clearly, so \r\nthat we know what we are voting for, against or \r\nabstaining from. And I am afraid that my delegation \r\nwas waiting for the Secretariat to pause and repeat \r\nwhat the motion was. I am not sure what it is that we \r\nare voting on. I am totally confused, and I note that \r\nmany delegations have not yet voted. \r\n The President: As the representative of the \r\nSecretariat said, there is a challenge to the ruling by the \r\nPresident to give the floor to the representative of \r\nMadagascar. \r\n A recorded vote was taken.  \r\nIn favour:  \r\n Denmark, Ecuador, Madagascar, Malaysia. \r\nAgainst:  \r\nAngola, Argentina, Bolivia (Plurinational State \r\nof), Botswana, Brazil, Canada, Congo, \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, India, \r\nJamaica, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, \r\nNicaragua, Seychelles, South Africa, Suriname, \r\nSwaziland, United Republic of Tanzania, \r\nVenezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), Zambia, \r\nZimbabwe. \r\nAbstaining: \r\nCameroon, Lebanon, Liechtenstein, Mali, \r\nTrinidad and Tobago, Vanuatu. \r\n The ruling of the President was rejected by 23 \r\nvotes to 4, with 6 abstentions. \r\n [Subsequently, the delegation of Ecuador advised \r\nthe Secretariat that it had intended to vote \r\nagainst.] \r\n The President: The matter is now clear. The \r\nmajority is silent. \r\n I give the floor to the representative of Algeria. \r\n Mr. Benmehidi (Algeria) (spoke in French): My \r\ndelegation was awaiting clarification from the \r\nSecretariat with regard to the question that was put to \r\nus. Were delegations asked to cast a vote on your \r\ndecision or were they asked to decide on the proposal \r\nto oppose your decision, as put forward by the \r\nrepresentative of the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo on behalf of the Southern African Development \r\nCommunity? When this matter has been clarified, I \r\nthink Member States will be in a better position to \r\ndecide for one of these two options. I would ask you, \r\nMr. President, please to tell us exactly what we are to \r\ndecide upon or upon what we have actually missed the \r\nopportunity to give our opinion. \r\n The President: The ruling of the President was \r\nbased on a recommendation from the Secretariat Legal \r\nCounsel.  \r\n Members of the Assembly must pronounce \r\nthemselves on what we are going to do: are we going \r\nto start again, or are we going to accept the vote? The \r\nlegal officer will consult his Chief and come back to \r\nus, and that will take some time.  \r\n I give the floor to the Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  \r\n Mr. Mwamba (Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo) (spoke in French): All of us present in this Hall \r\nare jurists. The vote was very clear. There were 23 \r\nvotes cast against your proposal. That means that there \r\nare 23 countries that reject Madagascar taking the \r\nfloor. There are only four countries that accept that \r\nMadagascar should take the floor. And six countries \r\nabstained. The vote has ended, so let us accept the \r\nA/64/PV.8  \r\n \r\n09-52470 22 \r\n \r\nconclusion of the vote: Mr. Rajoelina may not speak, \r\nsince the majority has expressed its will that he not \r\nspeak. \r\n The President: I agree with the Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo. I think the decision has been made. I think we \r\nwill now close this discussion for today. \r\n The meeting was suspended at 6 p.m. and \r\nresumed at 6.05 p.m. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Ramdien Sardjoe, Vice-\r\nPresident of the Republic of Suriname \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Vice-President of the Republic of \r\nSuriname. \r\n Mr. Ramdien Sardjoe, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Suriname, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum. \r\n The President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Ramdien Sardjoe, Vice-\r\nPresident of the Republic of Suriname, and inviting \r\nhim to address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Sardjoe (Suriname): On behalf of my \r\ndelegation I congratulate Mr. Ali Treki on his election \r\nas President of the sixty-fourth session of the General \r\nAssembly. I am sure that his wisdom and experience \r\nwill guide us as we address the challenges on the \r\nglobal agenda. I would like to pay tribute to the \r\nimportant work of your predecessor Mr. Miguel \r\nd’Escoto Brockmann. He led the Assembly’s sixty-\r\nthird session through complex discussions and \r\nextensive investigations in a spirit of responsibility and \r\ngood faith. I also take this opportunity to commend the \r\nSecretary-General and his staff for their continued \r\ndedication in overseeing the ongoing efforts for \r\nimproving the working methods of the Organization \r\nand its interaction with Member States. \r\n The world continues to face many challenges, \r\nboth traditional and new. Whilst traditional challenges \r\nto international peace and security persist, we also \r\nhave to cope with non-traditional threats such as \r\npervasive poverty, deadly diseases, increased \r\nfrequency and intensity of natural disasters and \r\nenvironmental degradation. Added to those challenges \r\nare the energy, food, financial and economic crises, all \r\nof which are hampering the realization of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals by the target date of \r\n2015. \r\n Our growing interdependence in today’s world \r\nonly strengthens the understanding that current \r\nchallenges transcend national borders and therefore \r\nrequire concerted action and responses from the \r\ninternational community. The United Nations therefore \r\nremains the central forum for addressing global issues, \r\nand we continue to advocate effective multilateralism \r\nnot as an option but as a necessity. \r\n In this regard we deem it indispensable for the \r\nUnited Nations to continue its reform efforts. This \r\nshould include meaningful reform of the Security \r\nCouncil, to make it more effective and responsive to \r\ntoday’s challenging world. Of equal importance is \r\nstrengthened cooperation within and between regional \r\ngroups. We should continue to promote and pursue \r\nintensified channels of political dialogue between \r\nregional groups in reaffirming our shared commitment \r\nto multilateralism. \r\n In this spirit, my country participates in regional \r\nand interregional endeavours to strengthen political, \r\neconomic, cultural and social cooperation and \r\nintegration. I would like to highlight the importance of \r\nthe United Nations as an effective agent in advancing \r\nmultilateralism and emphasize the need for it to \r\nstrengthen its role of consultation and coordination \r\nwith regional organizations. \r\n The urgency of the threat posed by climate \r\nchange requires the same degree of multilateral \r\nengagement as has been demonstrated in areas ranging \r\nfrom the fight against the uncontrolled spread of illicit \r\nsmall arms and light weapons, the fight against \r\ninternational terrorism and the effort to control \r\nHIV/AIDS, on the one hand, and peacekeeping and \r\npeacebuilding, the advancement of women and the \r\nprotection of human rights, on the other. \r\n We express our appreciation to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for convening the recent Summit on Climate \r\nChange to garner the necessary political support to \r\n“seal the deal” in Copenhagen. Suriname expects an \r\nagreement in Copenhagen with ambitious mitigation \r\nand adaptation targets. We expect the commitments \r\nnecessary to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in \r\nappropriate quantities and to support adaptation in \r\ndeveloping countries. Countries that are historically \r\n A/64/PV.8\r\n \r\n23 09-52470 \r\n \r\nresponsible for the current emissions of greenhouse \r\ngases in the atmosphere should take the lead in this \r\narea. \r\n Mr. Shaheed (Maldives), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n In the spirit of common but differentiated \r\nresponsibilities, we look forward to appropriate \r\nmitigation efforts by developing countries. As a high-\r\nforest low-deforestation (HFLD) country, Suriname \r\nwill continue with its efforts to manage its forests \r\nsustainably. In this way we aim to keep and improve \r\nthe climate-stabilizing capacity of our standing forests. \r\nWe attach great importance to the establishment of a \r\nfuture forest carbon-mitigation regime providing \r\npositive incentives to HFLD countries. In this regard \r\nwe call your attention to the report of the Informal \r\nWorking Group on Interim Finance for Reducing \r\nEmissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation \r\n(REDD). This report estimates that, if financing of \r\n€15 billion to €25 billion is available for the 2010-\r\n2015 period, a 25 per cent reduction in annual global \r\ndeforestation rates will be achievable by 2015. In this \r\nregard we call upon institutions and fellow Member \r\nStates to support United Nations REDD+ efforts in \r\nrecognition of the beneficial potential of tropical \r\nforests in mitigating climate change. \r\n Suriname has emphasized its support for the \r\npromotion of dialogue among civilizations and the \r\nculture of peace in various international forums, \r\nespecially through the full implementation of the \r\nGlobal Agenda and Programme of Action for Dialogue \r\namong Civilizations, as well as the Declaration and \r\nProgramme of Action on a Culture of Peace \r\n(resolutions 56/6 and 53/243, respectively). \r\n Our democracy serves as an illustration of our \r\nquest for peace, security and development. Various \r\nethnic groups with different multicultural backgrounds \r\nand religious traditions have come a long way in \r\ncoexisting and cooperating in a harmonious and \r\npeaceful way. This engagement is reflected in the \r\npolitical representation of our administration. It is \r\nwithin this atmosphere of democratic values, of high \r\nlevels of religious and ethnic tolerance, that we are \r\nbuilding a society that can prosper and engage with the \r\nregion and the world beyond. In order to achieve \r\ninternational peace, security and development, \r\ncooperation should be based upon constructive and \r\nrespectful dialogue. This dialogue should be guided by \r\na spirit of tolerance, acceptance and trust among \r\nreligions, peoples and cultures. Only with mutual trust \r\nand understanding will we be able to overcome \r\ninternational tensions. \r\n The Secretary-General recently emphasized the \r\nimportance of education for development. Education \r\nhas always been the foundation of economic \r\nopportunity and prosperity. Knowledge and advanced \r\nskills are critical tools for enhancing every country’s \r\neconomic potential, growth and standard of living. This \r\nis why we have to join our efforts to improve the \r\ncapacity of countries to adopt, disseminate and \r\nmaximize technological advances. Improved \r\ninternational cooperation aimed at creating better \r\neducational systems will help developing countries \r\nprogress faster towards achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, particularly those related to all \r\nlevels of education, health and gender equality. \r\n The promotion and protection of human rights are \r\namong the most effective strategies for eliminating \r\ninequalities between social groups and within and \r\nbetween countries, and Suriname therefore remains \r\ncommitted to the promotion and protection of all \r\nhuman rights.  \r\n With regard to what is called the supreme \r\ninternational crime — namely, the crime of \r\naggression — Suriname expresses the hope that a \r\ndecision on the elements of crime will be taken very \r\nsoon. The upcoming Review Conference of the Rome \r\nStatute of the International Criminal Court, to be held in \r\nUganda next year, should therefore address this issue \r\nseriously. \r\n For more than 60 years the United Nations has \r\nbeen able to build confidence and understanding \r\nbetween Member States and help keep global peace. \r\nMy delegation reiterates its commitment to \r\ndevelopment, respect for human rights and \r\ninternational peace and security. We will continue to \r\nengage in constructive dialogue aimed at contributing \r\nto a better future for all. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Vice-President of \r\nSuriname for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Ramdien Sardjoe, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Suriname, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n \r\nA/64/PV.8  \r\n \r\n09-52470 24 \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Joseph Boakai, Vice-President \r\nof the Republic of Liberia \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Vice-President of the Republic \r\nof Liberia. \r\n Mr. Joseph Boakai, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Liberia, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Joseph Boakai, Vice-\r\nPresident of the Republic of Liberia, and inviting him \r\nto address the Assembly. \r\n Mr. Boakai (Liberia): My delegation and I are \r\nhonoured, for the second time, to address the General \r\nAssembly on behalf of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf \r\nand the Government and people of Liberia. We \r\ncongratulate Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki and his country, \r\nthe Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, on his \r\nelection as President of the Assembly at its sixty-fourth \r\nsession. We are convinced that, as a consummate \r\ndiplomat, Mr. Treki will bring his wealth of experience \r\ninto play as we tackle the complex issues on the \r\ncurrent session’s agenda, while entertaining hopes for a \r\nresounding success. In this context, my delegation and \r\nI assure the President of our full cooperation. \r\n Permit me, therefore, to seize the opportunity to \r\npay a well-deserved tribute to the preceding President, \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann of the \r\nRepublic of Nicaragua, for the very able and effective \r\nmanner in which he steered the affairs of the \r\nAssembly’s sixty-third session. His sound and shrewd \r\nleadership was critical in steadying the turbulence \r\noccasioned by the severe global economic and \r\nfinancial crisis. Likewise, we commend the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, a visionary \r\nstatesman, for the unfaltering efforts with which he \r\ncontinues to administer the affairs of this Organization. \r\nHis renewed dynamism and sense of purpose serve as \r\nan impetus to our collective aspirations for the \r\nattainment of global peace, security and development. \r\n Liberia continues to make steady progress under \r\nthe excellent, indefatigable leadership of Her \r\nExcellency President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. Since her \r\ninauguration in January 2006 as the first \r\ndemocratically elected woman head of State of an \r\nAfrican country, the Government has undertaken a \r\nnumber of important initiatives aimed at enhancing \r\nnational dialogue and reconciliation.  \r\n On 30 June 2009, the Truth and Reconciliation \r\nCommission submitted an unedited report, which did \r\nnot gain the unanimous consent of the Commission, \r\nsince two members issued dissenting views. \r\nNonetheless, since its release the report has spurred \r\nnational debate, and the President has committed \r\nherself to working with all stakeholders towards \r\nimplementation of the recommendations, which must \r\nbe in consonance with the Commission’s mandate, the \r\nwishes of the Liberian people and the laws of our \r\ncountry. \r\n In order to protect the fundamental rights of the \r\nLiberian people, the President has also nominated the \r\nmembers of the Independent Human Rights \r\nCommission, which will have the responsibility of \r\nmonitoring the implementation of the Truth and \r\nReconciliation Commission report. Under the Liberian \r\nConstitution, the nominees must meet the consent of \r\nthe Liberian Senate, and that process is currently under \r\nway. We have also established the Land Commission, \r\nand its Commissioners have been appointed to address \r\nthe explosive issues of land disputes and the need for \r\nland reform. \r\n We note with satisfaction the achievement of the \r\nnational disarmament, demobilization, rehabilitation \r\nand reintegration programme, carried out in \r\nconjunction with the United Nations Mission in Liberia \r\n(UNMIL). That programme was successfully \r\nconcluded in July of this year. However, high \r\nunemployment, especially among the youth, remains a \r\nmajor challenge.  \r\n Liberia is pleased with the progress being made \r\nin the reconstitution of its armed forces, which \r\nincludes the training of the 2,000-strong army with the \r\nassistance of our development partners, particularly the \r\nUnited States of America. We continue to encourage \r\ngender sensitivity in this important area of our national \r\nendeavours, considering that at present there are only \r\n58 women in the new force. \r\n Improvements have also been registered in the \r\nperformance of the reorganized Liberia National Police \r\nforce, with the establishment of an emergency unit. \r\nThe police, however, continue to face difficulties in \r\nachieving full operational capability in the areas of \r\ninfrastructure, equipment, logistics and other \r\nrequirements. Two weeks ago, successful partnership \r\nconsultations were held at United Nations \r\nHeadquarters here in New York on the strategic plan \r\n A/64/PV.8\r\n \r\n25 09-52470 \r\n \r\nfor the Liberia National Police. The responses of our \r\npartners, especially India, were encouraging. The \r\nobjective of the strategic plan is to introduce an \r\nintegrated programme that would ensure a consistent \r\ndoctrine and training philosophy to enhance continuity. \r\nA similar strategic plan is also required for the Bureau \r\nof Immigration and Naturalization to improve its \r\nefficiency and effectiveness in border control. \r\n We are pleased to report that Liberia has \r\ncontinued to make significant strides in the \r\nadministration of justice and rule of law, in spite of \r\ndaunting obstacles. We have established a special \r\nsexual and gender-based violent crimes court, which \r\nhas begun hearing cases and encouraging victims to \r\ncome forth and report on those crimes in the spirit of \r\nconfidentiality and justice. Concomitantly, the \r\nGovernment has further adopted several gender-\r\nsensitive policies and frameworks in pursuance of \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1325 (2000). \r\n Post-conflict reconstruction and development \r\nrequire all Liberians to participate in the ongoing \r\nrecovery and sustainable development efforts. The \r\nGovernment is therefore promoting and encouraging \r\nwomen’s involvement at the leadership level and in all \r\nother spectrums of society, with emphasis on the \r\neducation of the girl child.  \r\n In this connection, I wish to refer to the \r\nInternational Colloquium on Women’s Empowerment, \r\nLeadership Development, International Peace and \r\nSecurity, which was co-convened by the President of \r\nLiberia, Her Excellency Madam Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, \r\nand the President of Finland, Her Excellency Madam \r\nTarja Halonen, in Monrovia on 7 and 8 March 2009. At \r\nthat event, the Monrovia Declaration was adopted, \r\ncalling for action on resolution 1325 (2000) on women, \r\npeace and security, and on climate change and gender. \r\nWe want to thank all our partners and friends of the \r\ninternational community, including the institutions of \r\nthe United Nations system and UNMIL, who \r\ncontributed to the success of the programme. \r\n In that regard, we reaffirm that resolution 1325 \r\n(2000) on women, peace and security recognizes that \r\nwomen, as civilians in conflict situations, are not only \r\nvictims but also powerful agents for peace and the \r\nsecurity for their communities. \r\n We also recognize that Security Council \r\nresolution 1820 (2008) is an important component of \r\nresolution 1325 (2000) with regard to rape and sexual \r\nviolence against women and girls. Therefore, we \r\nrecommend that the Secretary-General appoint a \r\nspecial envoy on women, peace and security who \r\nwould galvanize Member States to implement \r\nresolution 1325 (2000) and ensure that the path \r\ntowards its tenth anniversary is well prepared in a \r\ncoherent manner. \r\n As a follow-up to the Monrovia extraordinary \r\nmeeting, a side event to this sixty-fourth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly was jointly hosted yesterday by \r\nthose two exemplary women leaders, here at United \r\nNations Headquarters, to focus on the implementation \r\nof resolution 1325 (2000) and climate change. In \r\ncommending them for their excellent work, we join in \r\ntheir appeal to all Member States, Governments and \r\nnon-governmental organizations to support the \r\nMonrovia Declaration. Liberia wishes to thank all the \r\nparticipants at that historic event for renewing their \r\nsupport of the Government of Liberia and for reform of \r\nthe United Nations system, including the urgent need \r\nfor gender equality in its organs and related agencies. \r\n Liberia’s economic revitalization is shaping up to \r\nbecome a post-conflict success story, due to the \r\ncombination of the disciplined leadership and prudent \r\npolicies of Her Excellency President Ellen Johnson-\r\nSirleaf and the very constructive partnership with the \r\ninternational community. We remain cognizant of the \r\nfact that no amount of foreign assistance can transform \r\na nation in the absence of sound moral leadership and \r\ntechnical competencies and of the commitment to \r\nimprove the well-being of its citizens. It is out of this \r\nrealization that we formulated the Government’s \r\npoverty reduction strategy and have cultivated a \r\nstrategic partnership with friendly countries and \r\norganizations within the international community. \r\n The country experienced 7 per cent growth in \r\n2008 and is expected to register 5 per cent this year, \r\nlargely as a result of the negative impact of the global \r\neconomic meltdown on demand for our major \r\ncommodities and decreased capital inflows. National \r\nrevenue collection rose by 25 per cent last year. We \r\nhave improved our business and investment climate by \r\nestablishing the “One Stop Shop” concept to spur \r\nprivate sector growth and create jobs.  \r\n We have rehabilitated a total of 674 miles of \r\nprimary and secondary roads to link communities that \r\nwere isolated from the central administration as a result \r\nof the 14-year civil crisis. A robust and comprehensive \r\nA/64/PV.8  \r\n \r\n09-52470 26 \r\n \r\ncivil service reform strategy has been instituted as a \r\ncritical component of the public sector reform. \r\nMoreover, the President has promulgated a policy of \r\nmandatory free and compulsory primary education, \r\nwith a special emphasis on girls, who are often victims \r\nof institutionalized bias and abuse. \r\n We have undertaken several economic reform \r\ninitiatives and have set up the Liberia Anti-Corruption \r\nCommission to create a transparent and predictable \r\nbusiness and investment climate as well as to \r\nencourage greater foreign direct investment. \r\n Liberia has also made noticeable progress \r\ntowards reaching the targets for relief under the \r\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative. \r\nQualifying under this process will open up the country \r\nto borrowing on the international financial markets and \r\naccepting loans. \r\n While Liberia has made and continues to make \r\nimpressive progress towards consolidating peace, the \r\ngains remain fragile. In post-conflict situations such as \r\nours, stability is linked to development. Weak \r\ninstitutional capacity in the area of the rule of law, \r\ncoupled with the absence of employment opportunities, \r\nespecially for the youth, continue to threaten sustained \r\nprogress.  \r\n As we expect to hold general elections in 2011, \r\nsuccessful conduct of these undertakings will set the \r\nnation firmly on the path of stability and democracy. It \r\nis therefore envisioned that continued, sustainable \r\nsocio-economic development will serve as the catalyst \r\nfor a smooth electoral process. \r\n The Mano River Union countries of Liberia, \r\nSierra Leone, Guinea and Côte d’Ivoire continue to \r\nhost significant numbers of each other’s refugees in the \r\nsubregion. For instance, more than 65,000 Liberian \r\nrefugees are reportedly spread throughout West Africa, \r\nposing humanitarian challenges that require urgent \r\naction for cross-border movements. This is why we \r\ncontinue to urge the fast-tracking and relaxation of the \r\nstringent conditions for development assistance, if \r\nLiberia is to truly remain a model for post-conflict \r\nreconstruction and democracy. \r\n In this connection, Liberia requires the empathy \r\nand support of the international community for its \r\nyoung democracy as it improves the human rights \r\nsituation, transparency, anti-corruption and good \r\ngovernance, which are important priorities of the \r\nGovernment. \r\n In this vein, we wish to express the heartfelt \r\ngratitude of the Government and people of Liberia to \r\nthe Security Council for extending the mandate of \r\nUNMIL for another year and further requesting it to \r\nprovide a conducive security environment for the \r\nholding of general and presidential elections in 2011. \r\nThe crucial nature of this democratic transition cannot \r\nbe overemphasized as we commend the gallant men \r\nand women of UNMIL for their courageous and \r\nsacrificial services in keeping the peace. \r\n The issue of cross-border movement mentioned \r\nabove demonstrates that the security and stability of \r\nthe countries of the Mano River Union subregion are \r\ninextricably linked and that progress in one country \r\ncannot be divorced from progress in any one of the \r\nmember States. Elections are soon to be held in \r\nCôte d’Ivoire and Guinea. As Chair of the Mano River \r\nUnion and a member of the International Contact \r\nGroup on Guinea, President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf is \r\nurging the United Nations and the international \r\ncommunity to stay constructively engaged with Guinea \r\nwhile urging adherence to the original agreement so as \r\nto ensure a smooth transition to democratic rule in that \r\ncountry. \r\n Cross-border movements among the Mano River \r\nUnion countries have become more complex and \r\nproblematic due to the growing number of cases \r\ninvolving illicit drug trafficking, human trafficking and \r\nother organized transnational crime in the West African \r\nsubregion and beyond. These problems necessitate the \r\nurgent need for collective international action to tackle \r\nthese criminal activities, which are a menace to \r\nregional peace and security. \r\n Liberia supports the decision of the leaders of the \r\nSouthern African Development Community on the \r\nlifting of United Nations sanctions against Zimbabwe. \r\nWe are encouraged that the power-sharing agreement \r\nbetween the parties continues to hold as the country \r\ntries to recover. \r\n As regards Somalia, we note with regret the \r\ncontinuing deterioration of the situation in that country. \r\nIn view of the unfortunate state of affairs there, Liberia \r\ncalls for renewed commitment by the international \r\ncommunity to provide logistical and financial support \r\nto the African Union peacekeeping initiatives to restore \r\npeace in that country. Liberia, as a beneficiary of \r\n A/64/PV.8\r\n \r\n27 09-52470 \r\n \r\npeacekeeping operations, registers its strong \r\ncondemnation of the recent barbaric killings of \r\n17 African Union peacekeepers in Somalia.  \r\n On Darfur, we are heartened by the expressed \r\nwillingness of all the parties to end armed hostilities \r\nand to find a political solution to the problem that will \r\nensure lasting peace for all people in that region. \r\n Liberia welcomes the just-ended Summit on \r\nClimate Change convened by the Secretary-General. \r\nWe firmly believe that urgent action is needed to \r\nreduce greenhouse gas emissions and to help all \r\nMember States, particularly developing countries, \r\nadequately respond to the harmful effects of this global \r\nphenomenon. \r\n Liberia continues to join in the call for a \r\ndemocratic Security Council that reflects the realities \r\nof the twenty-first century. The world today is far \r\ndifferent from and more complex than that of the \r\n1940s, when this Organization came into being. \r\n Liberia supports peacekeeping operations to put \r\nout the flames of war. However, we wish to underscore \r\nthe benefits of establishing an early warning \r\nmechanism that will deal with potentially explosive \r\nsituations before they escalate into full blown \r\nconflagrations that present only ghastly choices. \r\n Additionally, it is important that the international \r\ncommunity provides special assistance and \r\ndispensation to post-conflict countries to shield them \r\nfrom shocks in the worldwide system, such as the \r\ncurrent global financial crisis. These upsets often have \r\nthe effect of reversing the gains made in restoring \r\npeace to countries emerging from conflict. \r\n That is why Liberia welcomes the empathy and \r\nsupport of the international community in rebuilding its \r\ninstitutions destroyed by protracted civil conflict. The \r\ncurrent global financial crisis is impregnated with the \r\npotential to undermine donor support to our national \r\nrenewal agenda, thus threatening much needed foreign \r\ndirect investment and delivery of social services. \r\n The result of the Government’s inability to \r\nprovide these basic services to its people has the \r\npropensity to provide fertile ground for acts of \r\ndestabilization from internal and external sources. It is \r\ncheaper to prevent these risks than to have to mobilize \r\nalready diminishing resources at much higher cost, \r\nsometimes involving human lives and enormous \r\nresources, to react to them. \r\n In conclusion, we pledge our unstinting support \r\nto your leadership and entertain the hope that together, \r\nwe can advance the cause of humanity and make the \r\nworld truly a better place to live. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Liberia for the statement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Joseph Boakai, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Liberia, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n \r\nAddress by The Right Honourable Raila Amollo \r\nOdinga, Prime Minister of the Republic of Kenya \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Kenya. \r\n The Right Honourable Raila Amollo Odinga, \r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Kenya, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency The Right Honourable \r\nRaila Amollo Odinga, Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Kenya, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Mr. Odinga (Kenya): I should like to \r\ncongratulate the President on the singular honour of \r\nhaving been chosen for the presidency of the United \r\nNations General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. I \r\nwould like to assure him of my delegation’s fullest \r\nsupport as he undertakes his momentous responsibility \r\nto unite Member States in pursuing the common goal \r\nof a more humane, secure, united and prosperous \r\nworld. \r\n There was a time recently when that elusive goal \r\nfinally appeared within reach, but multiple new \r\nchallenges have coalesced to render the goal even more \r\ndistant. It is therefore most encouraging that the world \r\nis turning to the United Nations to find a common, \r\nglobal path to resolving the most intractable difficulties \r\nfacing humanity. There is a clear recognition emerging \r\nthat together we can all rise, but that separately, we can \r\nonly sink. \r\n There was a time when the powerful disdained \r\nthis institution’s ability to be a unifying player. That is \r\nnow changing, and in this regard, I would like to \r\ncommend the President of the United States, who holds \r\nA/64/PV.8  \r\n \r\n09-52470 28 \r\n \r\na very special place in the hearts of Africans, Kenyans \r\nin particular, for having on Wednesday so eloquently \r\nindicated the centrality of the United Nations in \r\ncharting common solutions. \r\n In order to better equip the United Nations for \r\nmeeting these challenges, we must continue to press \r\nfor reform in the Organization. The Security Council, \r\nin particular, must be enlarged and made more \r\ndemocratic and representative of current day reality. \r\nPart of the enlargement must include permanent, veto-\r\nbearing seats for Africa. \r\n The world can no longer continue to marginalize \r\na continent that is home to nearly one billion people. \r\nThat is wrong in principle, but even more, it is wrong \r\nin practice. We cannot find sustainable solutions to our \r\nchallenges when such a large part of humanity is given \r\nso little voice and role in that quest for peace. \r\n The world is now acutely aware that the quest for \r\npeace begins with ensuring the survival of the planet. \r\nI would, therefore, like to thank Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon for having convened the high-level \r\nmeeting on climate change, which has put that issue \r\nsquarely onto the world’s centre stage. There is no \r\nissue that so clearly unites the population of the entire \r\nworld as climate change does. \r\n Regrettably, the far-sighted decision at the 2005 \r\nUnited Nations World Summit to explore the \r\npossibility of a more coherent institutional framework \r\nfor international environmental governance has not \r\nborne any fruit. This is particularly unacceptable now \r\nwhen climate change is indeed the most pressing \r\nchallenge of our times. We therefore call for the \r\nupgrading of the United Nations Environmental \r\nProgramme (UNEP) in Nairobi, so that it can become \r\nthe central environmental institution handling the \r\nnumerous conventions. \r\n We have noted with regret the emergence of \r\nmultiple centres dealing with environmental issues. \r\nThat dissipates their impact and sometimes even leads \r\nto contradictory actions. The United Nations Office in \r\nNairobi should now be elevated to the same level \r\nUnited Nations Offices in Geneva and Vienna to enable \r\nit to provide comprehensive support to all Member \r\nStates and organizations struggling to adjust to a new \r\nparadigm of a sustainable and dynamic green economy. \r\n Without that, the lives of billions will be \r\nimperilled. Already, as the Secretary-General pointed \r\nout on Wednesday, another 100 million people may fall \r\nbelow the poverty line this year owing to climate \r\nchange setbacks. Markets may be bouncing back, but \r\nincomes and jobs are not. These developments do not \r\naugur well for the future. \r\n I regret to say that my own country is emblematic \r\nof the woes unleashed by years of rampant excesses in \r\nthe global and local mismanagement of our \r\nenvironment. The melting of the famed ice caps of \r\nMt. Kenya and nearby Mt. Kilimanjaro, the destruction \r\nof vast swathes of our once beautiful forests, the drying \r\nof fast-flowing rivers, the intensifying cycles of \r\ndrought and floods, the spread of malaria to highland \r\nregions as temperatures rise — these are all \r\nconsequences of human action within and outside our \r\nborders. And so the solution also must also entail \r\naction on both fronts. \r\n The greater challenge for us, I am afraid, is the \r\nexternal one. We, like the rest of Africa, produce only a \r\ntiny proportion of the emissions that are rapidly \r\nwarming the planet and wreaking havoc with our \r\ncapacity to produce adequate amounts of food and \r\nenergy and husband sustainable water supplies. Our \r\neconomies are in disarray. We are victims of the richer \r\nworld’s acts and omissions, and therefore we need \r\nlarge amounts of funds in assistance and private-sector \r\ninvestment to reverse the course of events. The world \r\ncommunity must agree on concrete actions in \r\nCopenhagen. \r\n But we in Kenya are not interested in playing the \r\nblame game or waiting for international action to \r\nmaterialize. We have already begun to make very tough \r\npolitical decisions to reverse the ravages. Our \r\nimmediate goal is to fully restore our largest water \r\ntower, the famed Mau Forest complex, as well as \r\nKenya’s other four water towers, and are embarking on \r\na huge reforestation drive to plant seven billion trees, \r\nwhich will restore the carbon-taming sinks that once \r\nmade us self-sufficient in food and energy. We are also \r\nundertaking a crash programme designed to rapidly \r\nshift energy production to green technologies that use \r\nassets in which we are naturally rich — wind and sun, \r\nbut most important of all, geothermal energy, which \r\ncould more than double our current energy production \r\nwithin the next four years. \r\n For all of these programmes, we are mobilizing \r\nlocal resources, but we will need significant assistance \r\nand investment to succeed in our goal of achieving \r\n A/64/PV.8\r\n \r\n29 09-52470 \r\n \r\nself-sufficiency in a green way. The rich nations have \r\nrecognized that their own self-interest is served in \r\npromoting such green commitments in developing \r\ncountries, but the existing mechanisms through which \r\nthey can support such programmes need to be refined \r\nand made more effective in quickly releasing \r\nresources. \r\n We therefore support British Prime Minister \r\nGordon Brown’s proposal for a $100 billion facility, \r\nand at the same time urge that the $20 billion pledged \r\nby the Group of Eight (G-8) for enhanced food \r\nproduction be speedily mobilized and disbursed. We \r\nneed immediate assistance in feeding the 10 million \r\nKenyans who are now living in hunger and will \r\notherwise face starvation shortly. Just last week we \r\ndeclared this situation a national disaster requiring \r\n$500 million to rectify, of which $250 million will be \r\nmobilized from our own resources, while we urgently \r\nappeal to our development partners to furnish the other \r\n$250 million. \r\n Tens of thousands of livestock animals have died. \r\nThis devastation is the result primarily of climate \r\nchange. We have had droughts before, but they now \r\nrecur much more frequently and with greater severity. \r\nOne drought year is difficult enough, but the rains have \r\nnow failed us for the past four consecutive seasons. \r\nI appeal to our well-wishers, who are many, to assist us \r\nin this dire emergency. To mitigate the suffering, we \r\nhave carried out a massive mobilization — including of \r\nthe military — in providing relief and in drilling \r\nboreholes and transporting water to areas in acute need. \r\n I am very proud to say that despite the terrible \r\npost-election violence and the subsequent multiple \r\nreverses that made reconciliation and reconstruction \r\neven more difficult, our people have shown an \r\nextraordinary maturity and resilience in rising to \r\nunprecedented challenges. We were able to overcome \r\nthe bitterness over the election with an accord that we \r\nsigned with the help of the African Union and the \r\nmediation of Kofi Annan, as well as with the support of \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who personally \r\nvisited Kenya at the height of the crisis — for which \r\nwe are deeply grateful. \r\n Let me now turn to an area where peace does not \r\nprevail and which is a source of immense concern to \r\nthe entire international community — and that is \r\nSomalia. As its immediate neighbour and with a large \r\npopulation of Kenyan Somalis, we have done more \r\nthan any other country to assist Somalia in overcoming \r\nits divisions and conflicts. No one is more eager than \r\nwe are to help defeat the forces of extremism in \r\nSomalia, which have so much sway because of the help \r\nof external elements. The continuing inflow of \r\nrefugees, small arms and light weapons from Somalia \r\nis the major source of insecurity in our country. \r\n The latest setback resulting from that insecurity is \r\ndisruption through piracy against international trade in \r\none of the busiest sea routes in the world. Despite the \r\nrisks incurred by doing so, Kenya has offered facilities \r\nfor the detention and prosecution of suspected pirates, \r\nas part of our international obligation to promote \r\npeace. We have also offered to host a United Nations-\r\norganized conference in Kenya on how to coordinate \r\nand more effectively deal with the scourge of piracy. In \r\nreturn, we ask the international community to \r\nrecognize our many sacrifices and assist us in dealing \r\nwith our major refugee and security burdens. \r\n The Intergovernmental Authority on Development \r\n(IGAD) and the African Union have recommended to \r\nthe United Nations Security Council that it impose a no-\r\nfly zone and a blockade of airports and seaports held by \r\ninsurgents so as to prevent the influx of arms. Kenya \r\nfully supports their position. It is now incumbent upon \r\nthe United Nations Security Council to take decisive \r\naction to forestall further anarchy in Somalia. \r\n To succeed in the quest for peace in Somalia, we \r\nmust recognize that the present focus primarily on the \r\nuse of force has not led to any curbing of extremism. \r\nIndeed, the security and humanitarian crises are worse \r\nthan ever. We must therefore take a more \r\ncomprehensive approach in tackling the extremists — \r\nan approach that includes encouraging the Transitional \r\nFederal Government to much more aggressively pursue \r\nits commitment to a more inclusive political process, \r\nby bringing into the Government all forces that eschew \r\nviolence. Such outreach to all moderates can succeed \r\nonly with much greater international support. It is \r\nregrettable that many pledges made at the Brussels \r\ndonors conference have yet to be honoured. I call upon \r\nall those who have not honoured their pledges to do so \r\nimmediately. \r\n Turning back to the global economic crisis, it is \r\nnow recognized that one of its principal causes is the \r\nweakness of the international financial system. We \r\nshould strengthen and promote effective multilateralism \r\nwith the United Nations at the centre. We need to reform \r\nA/64/PV.8  \r\n \r\n09-52470 30 \r\n \r\nthe international financial governance institutions, so \r\nthat they can prevent crises and develop more effective \r\nand equitable responses to them. \r\n The ideals and principles of the United Nations \r\nare, today more than ever, the surest hope for a more \r\nprosperous and equitable world. Multilateralism in this \r\nglobalized age is the only sure way to ensure that \r\npeace, development and unity prevail at a time when \r\nthe world is riven with so many divisions. We need a \r\ngenuine partnership among all nations and peoples, so \r\nthat everyone feels that he or she is a critical \r\nstakeholder in national and international decision-\r\nmaking. \r\n Mr. Martínez (El Salvador), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n Finally, within democratic nations, each person’s \r\nvote is equal to those of all others, regardless of their \r\npower or wealth. That is the principle that must finally \r\nbe applied to the workings of the entire international \r\nsystem. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I thank the Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Kenya for the statement he \r\nhas just made. \r\n The Right Honourable Raila Amollo Odinga, \r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Kenya, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\nAddress by The Honourable John Key, Prime \r\nMinister of New Zealand \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of New Zealand. \r\n The Honourable John Key, Prime Minister of \r\nNew Zealand, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency John Key, \r\nPrime Minister of New Zealand, and inviting him to \r\naddress the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Key (New Zealand) (spoke in Maori; English \r\ntext provided by the delegation): To the powers, to the \r\nvoices, to the four winds: I greet you all. \r\n \r\n \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n I have addressed the Assembly in Te Reo Maori, \r\nthe indigenous language of New Zealand, and I bring \r\nwarm Pacific greetings from all New Zealanders. \r\n I am deeply honoured to lead New Zealand’s \r\ndelegation to the General Assembly for the first time. \r\nLike every New Zealand Prime Minister since 1945, I \r\nstand here today to reaffirm my country’s commitment \r\nto the United Nations and the United Nations Charter. \r\n The founding Members of the United Nations \r\ngathered in San Francisco in 1945 to create this \r\nOrganization out of the ashes of the most destructive \r\nwar and the most debilitating depression in modern \r\nhistory. They believed in the larger freedom of a world \r\nwhere collective action might avert common crises. \r\nThey believed in the rule of law, by which all States \r\nwould be held to a universal standard, and in a world \r\nwhere all peoples, faiths and cultures could flourish. \r\nThey believed in a future in which every human being \r\nwould be free from want and free from fear. And they \r\nwanted an international Organization and architecture \r\nthat could deliver those benefits.  \r\n New Zealand was active among those founding \r\nMembers in San Francisco. And, as a small, \r\nindependent and diverse country in the Pacific, New \r\nZealand still has a stake in the United Nations — this \r\ngreat meeting place for all States. \r\n I have benefited personally from efforts to secure \r\nthose ideals. My family fled persecution in Europe, and \r\nI was privileged to grow up in a new world where a \r\nchild of immigrants is now accorded the extraordinary \r\nprivilege of leading his country and addressing this \r\nAssembly on its behalf. \r\n We meet at a time of many challenges. With \r\n130 heads of State and Government assembled here \r\nthis week, the present session of the General Assembly \r\nrepresents our greatest opportunity since the 2005 \r\nWorld Summit to reaffirm our collective resolve. New \r\nZealand embraces that opportunity. Today, I will focus \r\non some of the most pressing issues demanding \r\ncollective responses from us. \r\n The crisis in the global economy continues. We \r\nmust remain resolute in our efforts to stabilize the \r\nglobal economy in order to permit a return to \r\nsustainable growth. New Zealand welcomes the actions \r\nof the Group of 20 (G-20) over the past year. But, in \r\ncommending those efforts, we call on the G-20 to heed \r\n A/64/PV.8\r\n \r\n31 09-52470 \r\n \r\nthe voices of the world’s small economies and to \r\nensure that they are also heard in global decision-\r\nmaking. \r\n Free and fair trade will be the principal engine for \r\ndriving developing countries out of poverty and \r\nbringing greater prosperity to all. An essential \r\ncomponent in our response to the global economic \r\ncrisis must therefore be a balanced and ambitious \r\nconclusion to the Doha Round of world trade talks. A \r\ngenuinely global agreement that reduces tariffs, \r\neliminates export subsidies, reduces domestic subsidies \r\nand increases market access will see benefits flow to \r\nall States. At a time when all countries are suffering \r\nfrom the brunt of the current economic crisis, further \r\ndelay is inexcusable. \r\n As one of the world’s first truly open economies, \r\nNew Zealand has an unwavering commitment to trade \r\nliberalization and to the pursuit of bilateral, regional \r\nand global free trade agreements. We support the call \r\nof the Secretary-General for the immediate suspension \r\nof price controls and other agricultural trade \r\nrestrictions, in order to reduce soaring food prices and \r\nhelp millions cope with the highest food prices in \r\n30 years. \r\n Therefore, I call on all those States and groupings \r\nthat have broken their undertakings and reintroduced \r\nprotectionist measures to reconsider. Those actions are \r\nas harmful as they are unacceptable. Agriculture, which \r\nis so important for developing countries in particular, is \r\none of the sectors most affected. \r\n The escalation of poverty is a result of the \r\neconomic crisis. New Zealand is, naturally, proud of \r\nthe efforts of the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme to strengthen its focus as the largest United \r\nNations development agency on poverty and the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals.  \r\n For its part, New Zealand pledges to continue to \r\nincrease its official development assistance, with a \r\nclear focus on the Pacific Islands region. Aid \r\neffectiveness is just as important as the quantum of aid. \r\nThat is why, last month, we committed to the Cairns \r\nCompact, which will strengthen development \r\ncoordination in the Pacific islands. \r\n The major focus of the General Assembly this \r\nyear must be on the challenge of climate change. \r\nClimate change demands innovation and a global \r\nresponse. The world cannot afford to contemplate \r\nfailure at Copenhagen. Political leadership is needed, \r\nand it is on display.  \r\n At the Summit on climate change this week, the \r\nleaders of the world’s three biggest economies showed \r\ntheir determination both to make Copenhagen a success \r\nand to take action themselves. All countries must take \r\naction that reflects our individual circumstances, \r\nresponsibilities and capabilities. \r\n For our part, New Zealand is committed to \r\nsecuring a durable and meaningful agreement on \r\nclimate change — an agreement that is both \r\nenvironmentally effective and economically efficient. I \r\nhave set a target for New Zealand of reducing \r\ngreenhouse gas emissions by 10 to 20 per cent below \r\n1990 levels by 2020, if there is a comprehensive global \r\nagreement. That amounts to a per capita drop of 35 to \r\n42 per cent since 1990. \r\n New Zealand is acutely conscious that most of \r\nour greenhouse gas emissions come from livestock \r\nmethane emissions, which so far no technology can \r\nreduce. At the same time we are proud of our role as a \r\nfood producer to the world and the contribution we can \r\nmake to assuring food security for the world’s people. \r\n Our challenge is to find a way to balance growth \r\nin agricultural production with the need to reduce \r\nemissions and reach climate change targets.  \r\n That is not just a challenge for New Zealand, but \r\none for the world. Agricultural emissions make up \r\n14 per cent of all emissions worldwide. As demand for \r\nfood rises, so will those emissions. Yet so far the only \r\nknown way to achieve emission reductions from \r\nagriculture is through reductions in output, which is \r\nnot an acceptable response — not for New Zealand, \r\nand not for a growing world that seeks freedom from \r\nhunger. \r\n A better response to this challenge must be found. \r\nIn my view, the response must draw on the power and \r\npossibility of science. Just as New Zealand is proud of \r\nits agricultural producers, so are we proud of our role \r\nin agricultural research. This research has resulted in \r\nscientific and technological advances that have \r\nimproved production and fed virtually millions of \r\npeople. \r\n But advancing research in the area of emission \r\nreduction requires a commitment so broad that it is \r\nbeyond the capacity of any one individual country. \r\nA/64/PV.8  \r\n \r\n09-52470 32 \r\n \r\nThat is a challenge that requires collective action, and \r\nit is collective action that I call for today. \r\n New Zealand has developed a proposal for a \r\nglobal alliance on the reduction of agricultural \r\nemissions. This alliance would undertake international \r\nresearch and investment into new technologies and \r\npractices to help reduce agriculture-related emissions \r\nand would seek to achieve greater coordination of \r\nexisting efforts. \r\n Through a global alliance we can find solutions \r\nfaster, make better use of the money that is being spent \r\naround the world and encourage all countries and \r\ncompanies to do more. We have been delighted with \r\nthe interest that our proposal has received so far, and \r\nwe will continue working with others to explore the \r\nconcept. Today, my call to other agricultural producers \r\nof the world is to rise to this challenge and join New \r\nZealand in this research effort.  \r\n I now want to address some of the security crises \r\nthat we confront. Yesterday I had the honour to observe \r\nthe high-level Security Council meeting on \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation. As a country with a \r\nproud record of promoting nuclear disarmament and \r\nnon-proliferation, I was heartened by the expressions \r\nof support for a world free of nuclear weapons. We \r\nmust all take full advantage of this historic moment to \r\nadvance the nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation \r\nagenda. We owe it to our generation and to those who \r\nfollow us to move our vision for a world free from \r\nnuclear weapons forward. As a proudly nuclear-free \r\nnation and a country that has been at the forefront of \r\nthat debate since the 1970s, New Zealand stands ready \r\nto play its part.  \r\n We are optimistic about the prospects for \r\nprogress. Last week, New Zealand presided over the \r\nGeneral Conference of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency in Vienna, Austria. Preventing the spread of \r\nnuclear weapons through the implementation of \r\nsafeguards under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty \r\nis a fundamental pillar of the Agency’s work. Next year \r\nsees the quinquennial review conference of the Nuclear \r\nNon-Proliferation Treaty. \r\n New Zealand will actively work with our New \r\nAgenda Coalition partners for a meaningful outcome at \r\nthat conference to bring us closer to a truly secure \r\nworld.  \r\n We will also continue to address the humanitarian \r\nharm caused by conventional weapons. We will work \r\nfor a robust, action-oriented outcome later this year at \r\nthe second review conference of the Ottawa \r\nConvention on Landmines. \r\n Looking back, I am proud of the role that New \r\nZealand was able to play in the negotiation of the \r\nConvention on Cluster Munitions. The Government \r\nattaches priority to passing legislation to enable us to \r\nratify this very significant treaty. New Zealand also \r\ncontinues to play its part in maintaining and promoting \r\ninternational peace and security. \r\n Peacekeeping remains one of this Organization’s \r\nmost essential tasks and most solemn responsibilities to \r\nits Members. While United Nations peacekeeping has \r\nbeen significantly strengthened since the testing it \r\nunderwent in the 1990s, the demands now being placed \r\non it are severe. \r\n I want to express my profound gratitude to those \r\ncivilians and military personnel who place their lives at \r\nrisk to support peace and live up to the ideals of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. Ensuring that United \r\nNations peacekeeping is as effective and responsive as \r\npossible must therefore remain one of the \r\nOrganization’s most urgent priorities. \r\n The United Nations provides the legal mandate — \r\nand often the operational effectiveness — for our joint \r\nefforts to achieve and maintain peace and security. New \r\nZealand is firmly committed to supporting United \r\nNations peacekeeping — both its own operations and \r\nothers that it has mandated, such as those in which we \r\nare involved in Afghanistan, the Solomon Islands and \r\nTimor-Leste. \r\n All too often, however, the United Nations has \r\nfound itself unable to respond to emerging crises. New \r\nZealand therefore strongly supports the concept of \r\nresponsibility to protect. I am pleased at the solid \r\nfoundation that the General Assembly’s recent debate \r\non that responsibility has laid for its implementation. \r\n New Zealand also strongly supports the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC). It is a fundamental \r\ntenet of our domestic legal systems that wrongdoers \r\nmust be brought to justice. The ICC is the mechanism \r\nfor applying that same principle to persons accused of \r\nthe most serious international crimes. \r\n New Zealand takes very seriously its \r\nresponsibilities for creating and maintaining peace and \r\n A/64/PV.8\r\n \r\n33 09-52470 \r\n \r\nsecurity in its region and in the world. I am therefore \r\npleased to confirm New Zealand’s candidature for the \r\nUnited Nations Security Council for 2015-2016 in the \r\nelections to be held in 2014. In advancing its \r\ncandidature, New Zealand does so as a State committed \r\nto upholding the international rule of law and to \r\nproviding a strong and principled Pacific voice on \r\nbehalf of small States like ourselves with an interest in \r\na fairer and more secure world. \r\n We all have a stake in a world where peace and \r\nthe rule of law prevail, where all States are secure and \r\ncan prosper and where all people are guaranteed the \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms promised \r\nthem in the Charter.  \r\n But we also know that solutions to the problems \r\nwe collectively face do not lie with inspirational goals \r\nand promises that can be — and far too often are — \r\nquickly and quietly forgotten and ignored. Hard, \r\npragmatic decisions must be made. Enforceable \r\nsolutions must be implemented. \r\n We know that effective, collective action is in \r\nevery country’s long-term, national interest. That is \r\nwhat New Zealand believed in 1945, and I recommit \r\nnow to taking action to live up to the ideals of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter, here, in this great Hall, this \r\nevening. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister of New Zealand for the statement he \r\nhas just made. \r\n The Honourable John Key, Prime Minister of \r\nNew Zealand, was escorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Milo Dukanović, Prime Minister \r\nof Montenegro \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of Montenegro. \r\n The Honourable Milo Dukanović, Prime Minister \r\nof Montenegro, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Milo \r\nDukanović, Prime Minister of Montenegro, and \r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Dukanović (Montenegro) (spoke in \r\nMontenegrin; English interpretation provided by the \r\ndelegation): At the outset, please allow me to \r\ncongratulate Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his election \r\nas President of the United Nations General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-fourth session. We wish him success in his \r\nwork and assure him of Montenegro’s unwavering \r\nsupport. \r\n I would also like to thank the former President, \r\nMiguel d’Escoto Brockmann, for his endeavours and \r\npersonal contribution in discharging this challenging \r\npost. \r\n At the same time I would like to pay my tribute to \r\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his \r\noutstanding efforts in leading the Organization in these \r\ntrying times. \r\n As we have heard from the statements of previous \r\ndistinguished speakers, given the impact of the world \r\neconomic and financial crisis and related food and \r\nenergy crises, climate change and the flu pandemic on \r\nthe economic and social growth and development, \r\npolitics and global relations, including achievement of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and other \r\ninternationally agreed development goals, only a \r\ncoordinated and a concerted global effort can yield \r\npositive results. \r\n Response to current challenges requires, \r\ntherefore, that we pool all capacities and resources, as \r\nwell as a strong political will from us all. In this, the \r\nkey role belongs to the United Nations, the world’s \r\nmost important multilateral forum. \r\n Montenegro, as a country that advocates the \r\nequality of peoples and nations in international \r\nrelations, is fully committed to active participation in \r\nefforts to work out a global response to present-day \r\nchallenges. Preserving peace and security through \r\nactivities aimed at creating positive political, \r\neconomic, social and cultural environments for the \r\nimplementation and respect of international law, the \r\nrule of law and the protection and promotion of \r\nfundamental human rights and freedoms are the main \r\nprinciples and bases of the Montenegrin foreign policy \r\npriorities. \r\n In that regard, Montenegro remains strongly \r\ncommitted to the fundamental principles and purposes \r\nof the United Nations Charter, which imply peaceful \r\nresolution of disputes and non-interference in the \r\ninternal affairs of States. \r\nA/64/PV.8  \r\n \r\n09-52470 34 \r\n \r\n Strong cooperation with neighbouring countries \r\nand regional stability are the underlying principles of \r\nthe foreign policy of Montenegro and a precondition \r\nfor progress in its broader integration processes. Since \r\nthe previous General Assembly session, we have \r\nmoved to a new and more demanding phase of \r\nEuropean and Euro-Atlantic integration. We feel \r\nparticularly encouraged by the dynamic progress \r\nMontenegro has made towards membership in the \r\nEuropean Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty \r\nOrganization (NATO). We expect that in the near future \r\nthe European Commission will issue an opinion on \r\nMontenegro’s preparedness for EU membership, and \r\nwe also expect an invitation to join in the NATO \r\nMembership Action Plan, which will open additional \r\nopportunities for those two integration processes to \r\ngain momentum. \r\n Taking into consideration the strong impact of the \r\nworld economic and financial crisis on overall socio-\r\neconomic development, the most recent reports from \r\nthe global financial markets are encouraging, \r\nindicating an end to the global crisis even earlier than \r\nexpected. However, in order to ensure sustained \r\neconomic development, increased aid and \r\nimplementation of trade agreements and the \r\nachievement of international solidarity is imperative in \r\naddressing the needs of the world’s poorest and most \r\nvulnerable. \r\n Given that the recovery is going to be long and \r\ngradual, all countries, led by the United Nations, \r\nshould be committed to the implementation of policies \r\nand measures initiated in the various international \r\nforums, including the United Nations Conference on \r\nthe world economic and financial crisis and its impact \r\non development, the G-20, World Bank and the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund. \r\n Bearing in mind the nature of the Montenegrin \r\neconomy as a small and open system, we have not been \r\nable to remain immune to the turbulent global \r\ndevelopments. In that regard, the Government of \r\nMontenegro has adopted a package of economic policy \r\nmeasures aimed at maintaining macroeconomic \r\nstability, improving productivity and preserving a \r\nfavourable economic environment. \r\n The harmful consequences of climate change, \r\nincreasing energy consumption and growing \r\ndependence on imported fossil fuels, along with their \r\nnegative impacts on the environment and standards of \r\nliving, are issues causing profound concern among us \r\nall. The Summit on Climate Change held on the eve of \r\nthe general debate is, in our view, a significant step \r\nforward in Member States’ political support for the \r\nprocess of the implementation of the MDGs in this \r\nfield. \r\n We believe that both the character and the effects \r\nof climate change call for a comprehensive \r\ninternational response based on the principles of the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange (UNFCCC), which would facilitate sustainable \r\neconomic development of society in accordance with \r\nthe guidelines of the 2007 Bali Action Plan. \r\n I would like to take this opportunity to express \r\nMontenegro’s strong support for the negotiation \r\nprocess on a new post-2012 climate framework and for \r\ncalls to “seal the deal” in Copenhagen in December. \r\n We believe that further efforts need to be made to \r\npromote a green recovery and to build up national \r\ncapacities for adaptation and mitigation of the impact \r\nof climate change, while simultaneously stimulating \r\ninnovation and economic growth, contributing to \r\npoverty reduction and ensuring access to sustainable \r\nenergy sources. \r\n In that regard, we underline the importance of \r\nregional cooperation, which enables us to implement \r\nadaptation and mitigation measures in a regional \r\ncontext, which promotes political dialogue and leads to \r\nmore effective action by States in the talks within the \r\nUNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol frameworks. \r\n In order to contribute to the efforts being \r\nundertaken at the national and international levels in \r\naddressing the impact of climate change on the \r\nenvironment and economic development and in \r\nreaching a successful deal in Copenhagen, Montenegro \r\nwill organize a regional conference on climate change \r\nand sustainable development for the Mediterranean and \r\nSouth-East European countries in Budva, on 16 and \r\n17 October. \r\n The Millennium Development Goals require each \r\nand every one of us to redouble our efforts to reduce \r\npoverty, improve health and education, promote peace \r\nand human rights, and achieve sustainable \r\ndevelopment. We are aware that it is the primary \r\nresponsibility of States to take measures aimed at \r\nimproving the social security of the poor and \r\nvulnerable segments of society and alleviating the most \r\n A/64/PV.8\r\n \r\n35 09-52470 \r\n \r\nsevere consequences of poverty. In this context we \r\nstrongly welcome the convening of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) review summit in 2010. \r\n Montenegro strongly supports and is committed \r\nto fulfilment of the MDGs and implementation of all \r\nUnited Nations documents — including the \r\nMillennium Declaration — related to development \r\nissues and the special needs of Africa, as a pre-emptive \r\naction aimed at creating a safer world. As a country \r\nmoving towards European integration, we welcome the \r\nEuropean Union-Africa partnership and the efforts \r\ncurrently under way to find solutions to development \r\nneeds and to root out poverty on the African continent.  \r\n In this regard, we support the message of the \r\n2008 Yokohama Declaration aimed at giving \r\nmomentum to current development issues, including \r\neducation, health and sanitary measures within the \r\nframework of the MDGs, the development of \r\nagriculture to improve food security, measures to \r\ntackle climate change, as well as establishing and \r\nmaintaining peace as a prerequisite for economic \r\ngrowth. \r\n We emphasize the crucial importance of the \r\ndebate on the concept of the responsibility to protect, \r\nand we fully support the activities of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the assessments outlined in his latest \r\nreport. We believe that an upsurge of internal conflicts \r\nand serious violations of human rights in the 1990s has \r\nspurred a discussion on the need for the protection of \r\ncivilians in armed conflict, which has unquestionably \r\nled to further deliberations on and analyses of the \r\nprimary obligation of each State to protect its citizens \r\nfrom genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and \r\ncrimes against humanity, as well as to consideration of \r\nthe international community’s responsibility in the \r\nevent that countries fail to act. In this context, we \r\nunderline the importance of reaching an agreement on \r\nan appropriate concept and instruments within the \r\nframework of the United Nations and international law, \r\nbased on a broad consensus of all actors. \r\n In supporting peacekeeping missions as efficient \r\nand dynamic instruments for monitoring respect of \r\nhuman rights and building sustainable institutions in \r\nconflict areas, we have established legal prerequisites \r\nwithin our security policy in order to be able to \r\ncontribute our military and police troops to the United \r\nNations peacekeeping missions, including missions to \r\nLiberia, Afghanistan and Cyprus and the European \r\nUnion peace operation in Somalia.  \r\n Given the problems of the Balkan region, \r\nMontenegro attaches particular importance to a policy \r\nthat addresses the needs of refugees, asylum-seekers \r\nand internally displaced persons (IDPs) and is \r\nconducting extensive activities aimed at finding lasting \r\nsolutions for the refugees and IDPs from the territory \r\nof the former Yugoslavia. As part of those efforts, a \r\nrenewed registration procedure supported by the Office \r\nof the United Nations High Commissioner for \r\nRefugees (UNHCR) is under way for refugees and \r\nIDPs living in Montenegro to resolve their final status, \r\nin accordance with the highest international standards \r\nand international law instruments. \r\n In this regard we highlight the importance of a \r\ncomprehensive approach and the need for the \r\ncooperation of all actors, primarily UNHCR, the \r\nEuropean Commission and the Organization for \r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe. \r\n Montenegro stresses the importance of the \r\npromotion of and the respect for international law in \r\nthe development of international relations today. In this \r\ncontext, the rule of law and the protection of human \r\nrights have an irreplaceable role in the fight against \r\ninternational terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of \r\nmass destruction and organized crime. \r\n We are firmly convinced that only the \r\ncoordinated efforts of the global community can take \r\non international terrorism. Montenegro supports the \r\nimplementation of the United Nations Global Counter-\r\nTerrorism Strategy, as well as measures to fight \r\ncorruption, organized crime, drug trafficking and \r\nhuman trafficking, and we further underscore the need \r\nfor cooperation among all the bodies of the United \r\nNations system, in particular the committees of the \r\nSecurity Council and the Counter-Terrorism \r\nCommittee.  \r\n Montenegro attaches particular importance to the \r\nfulfilment of the obligations stipulated by the United \r\nNations Convention against Transnational Organized \r\nCrime and the United Nations Convention against \r\nIllicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic \r\nSubstances and it actively participates in projects of \r\nthe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, which \r\ncontribute to regional peace and stability, strengthening \r\nof the judiciary and a more efficient fight against all \r\nforms of organized crime. \r\nA/64/PV.8  \r\n \r\n09-52470 36 \r\n \r\n In view of all of the above, it is clear that the \r\nresponsibility of the United Nations is only increasing. \r\nWe therefore welcome the reform process of the world \r\nOrganization and hope that it will result in a more \r\ndemocratic and representative United Nations. We \r\nattach particular importance to strengthening the role \r\nand efficiency of the General Assembly and its main \r\nbodies, and fully support intergovernmental talks on \r\nSecurity Council reform. These negotiations offer an \r\nopportunity for small States to express their interests, \r\nin addition to providing a vision for an improved and \r\nmore transparent functioning of the most important \r\nUnited Nations organ. \r\n As the Assembly may know, this past June the \r\nUnited Nations Development Group identified \r\nMontenegro as a country eligible for implementation of \r\nthe Delivering as One pilot initiative launched within \r\nthe framework of the overall reform process aimed at \r\nimproving the efficiency, coherence and coordination \r\nof United Nations development programmes on the \r\nground. In our view, that decision recognizes \r\nMontenegro’s strong commitment to United Nations \r\nstandards and values and provides an endorsement of \r\nthe highly successful joint efforts of the United Nations \r\nteam and the Montenegrin Government. \r\n Given the myriad of challenges and their negative \r\neffects on the environment, as well as the potential \r\nincrease in social, religious and cultural tensions \r\nleading to political instability, only the coordinated and \r\ncomprehensive response of all international \r\nstakeholders, including civil society and the private \r\nsector, can create the preconditions for efficiently \r\naddressing the consequences of the ongoing crises. In \r\nthis regard, the United Nations has a decisive role to \r\nplay in coordinating efforts towards the achievement of \r\nconcrete results. \r\n Convinced of the great potential of the United \r\nNations, if supported by the active participation of \r\nMember States, we reiterate Montenegro’s commitment \r\nto building a responsible international community \r\nready to meet the needs of all of its members. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister of Montenegro for the statement he has \r\njust made. \r\n Mr. Milo Dukanović, Prime Minister of Montenegro, \r\nwas escorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Faustin Archange Touadera, Prime \r\nMinister of the Central African Republic \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the Central African Republic. \r\n Mr. Faustin Archange Touadera, Prime Minister \r\nof the Central African Republic, was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency \r\nMr. Faustin Archange Touadera, Prime Minister of the \r\nCentral African Republic, and inviting him to address \r\nthe General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Touadera (Central African Republic) (spoke \r\nin French): May I begin by congratulating Mr. Treki on \r\nhis unanimous election to preside over the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. His \r\nelection to that position is an honour to the entire \r\nAfrican continent and a worthy tribute to the Great \r\nSocialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, whose \r\ndevotion to the African cause goes without saying. \r\n Furthermore and on behalf of His Excellency \r\nGeneral François Bozizé, President of the Republic, \r\nwho wishes him every success in his work, I assure \r\nhim of the support of the Central African delegation in \r\nachieving the full success of his lofty task this year. \r\nHis demonstrated knowledge of the United Nations and \r\nof world problems will ensure the success of the \r\npresent session. I also wish to congratulate Mr. Miguel \r\nd’Escoto Brockmann of Nicaragua on his excellent \r\ncontribution to the previous session in his capacity as \r\nPresident. \r\n However, before delivering my assessment the \r\nstate of the world in the face of the new challenges of \r\nthe twenty-first century and my country’s perspective \r\non the main issues to be addressed at this session, I \r\nshould also like to commend the tireless work of the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, who spares no \r\neffort in promoting the principles and purposes of the \r\nUnited Nations. To him, I once again express the deep \r\ngratitude of the people of the Central African Republic \r\nfor his notable contributions with regard to the \r\nsituation in the Central African Republic and his \r\nsupport within the framework of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission.  \r\n In fact, in March this year, pursuant to my \r\nGovernment’s request, a country configuration of the \r\n A/64/PV.8\r\n \r\n37 09-52470 \r\n \r\nPeacebuilding Commission was established under the \r\nBelgian presidency. The Commission is working \r\ntogether with Central African authorities to strengthen \r\nthe achievements of peace and make it possible to \r\nimplement the recommendations resulting from the \r\ninclusive political dialogue held from 8 to \r\n20 December 2008, regarding in particular the \r\ndisarmament, demobilization and reintegration \r\nprogramme, security sector reform and the process \r\nleading up to the 2010 general elections. \r\n My country welcomes this session because of the \r\nitems on our agenda, which are true matters of global \r\nconcern. Indeed, it should be recalled that we have \r\nseveral challenges to meet: development, peace and \r\nsecurity, climate change and its effects, terrorism and \r\nnecessary United Nations reform. The choice of theme \r\nfor this debate — “Effective responses to global crises, \r\nstrengthening multilateralism and dialogue among \r\ncivilizations for international peace, security and \r\ndevelopment” — is inspired. In fact, the changes in the \r\nworld’s configuration have given rise to new \r\nchallenges that can be addressed only through \r\ninternational cooperation. Thus, multilateralism now \r\nappears to be the only way to resolve the world’s \r\nproblems. \r\n In this era of globalization and technological \r\nadvances, forums for cooperation — even the most \r\nfirmly established ones — must address new demands \r\ncalling for appropriate and united responses.  \r\n I am grateful for the honour shown to the Central \r\nAfrican Republic, and I should like to stress the \r\ncorrelation among some of the issues raised since the \r\nbeginning of this general debate. With regard to the \r\nworld situation, this session is being held in a \r\nparticularly worrisome context. This is a critical time \r\nfor addressing global political issues at all levels — a \r\ntime that requires us, as nations, to seek solutions in a \r\nspirit of dialogue, cooperation and openness. The \r\ncurrent world scene poses major challenges in the areas \r\nof peace and security, economic development and \r\nsocial progress, and human rights and the rule of law. \r\n As far as crucial development issues are \r\nconcerned, the world economic and financial crisis \r\nremains an unprecedented event in terms of its impact \r\nand the upheavals in the world’s economic and \r\nfinancial systems. It requires a reorganization leading \r\nto a new world order in this area. Besides that option, \r\nhowever, other ways to emerge from the present crisis \r\ncould be to develop production capacity, to strengthen \r\ntrade capacity for the benefit of developing countries \r\nand to implement strategic partnerships among the \r\nvarious regions to which the Organization’s Members \r\nbelong.  \r\n The food crisis, which was caused by rising \r\nprices and whose harmful effects continue to keep a \r\nlarge part of the world in conditions of famine and \r\nabject poverty, requires that we promote the \r\nagricultural sector, industry and the utilization of \r\nmining resources. The rise in food prices has caused a \r\nsignificant deterioration in the terms of trade among \r\ncountries in the most affected regions, including the \r\nAfrican continent generally and, in particular, the \r\nCentral African Republic. That situation could lead to \r\ngreater inflationary pressure and a deteriorating \r\nbalance of payments. The impact is being felt both at \r\nthe macroeconomic level and in terms of household \r\nincome and food security.  \r\n The contributions of regional economic \r\ncommunities and United Nations agencies such as the \r\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United \r\nNations, the World Food Programme, the International \r\nFund for Agricultural Development and the World \r\nBank, will be invaluable in the quest for a coordinated \r\nsolution to this crisis. Agricultural development should \r\nbe encouraged with a view to ensuring sustainable \r\ngrowth and improvements in people’s means of \r\nsubsistence, based on the sound management of \r\nenvironmental and natural resources.  \r\n Programmes and activities to promote long-term \r\ngrowth should, of course, be carried out in accordance \r\nwith the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In \r\n2000, when we committed ourselves to achieving the \r\nGoals by 2015, we aroused legitimate hopes \r\nthroughout the developing world. We do not have the \r\nright to dash those hopes, which would worsen the \r\nNorth-South fracture and further deepen the divisions \r\nwithin our own societies, with incalculable risks for the \r\ngovernance and stability of States.  \r\n A little more than nine years after the Millennium \r\nSummit, it is indisputable that significant progress has \r\nbeen made, but we must acknowledge that, in many \r\ncountries in Africa and elsewhere, a large majority of \r\nthe population lives in abject poverty. The Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals are the surest way to speed the \r\nprogress of African peoples towards well-being. The \r\ndevelopment projects in the MDG sectors need stable, \r\nA/64/PV.8  \r\n \r\n09-52470 38 \r\n \r\nsufficient and predictable long-term funding. We thus \r\nregard this session of the General Assembly as an \r\nopportunity to raise the awareness of all international \r\ndevelopment financing institutions, without exception, \r\nand lead them to effectively pledge to mobilize and \r\ntransfer the financial resources necessary to achieve \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals.  \r\n Likewise, the Programme of Action for the Least \r\nDeveloped Countries for the Decade 2001-2010, aimed \r\nat significantly improving the living conditions of the \r\nmore than 600 million people living in those countries, \r\nis concluding and thus should be reviewed in order to \r\naddress the marginalization and the new \r\nsocio-economic challenges facing least developed \r\ncountries.  \r\n Climate change joins the challenges confronting \r\nour world, because the economy, the environment and \r\nthe way of life of every nation represented here are \r\nthreatened.  \r\n At the United Nations Climate Change \r\nConference held in Bali, Indonesia, in 2007, world \r\nleaders decided to negotiate a new agreement on \r\nclimate change to succeed the Kyoto Protocol in 2012. \r\nIn the Bali Road Map, States defined spheres of action \r\nand agreed to take them into account during the post-\r\nKyoto negotiations. The working meeting of the heads \r\nof State of the G8+5 in L’Aquila on 9 July 2009 \r\nexamined the issue of reducing greenhouse gas \r\nemissions. \r\n My country is committed to the global fight \r\nagainst climate change, as demonstrated by its \r\nratification of several international instruments on \r\nclimate issues. I am referring to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change and the \r\nKyoto Protocol. \r\n For the Central African Republic, the challenge \r\nof climate change relates to not only mitigation, \r\nnamely reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, but \r\nalso to adaptation to the harmful effects of that change. \r\nHowever, for vulnerable States, with a weak economy \r\nlike ours, the cost of adaptation, calculated at several \r\ntens of billions of dollars a year, puts a still greater \r\nstrain on our limited resources and increases poverty. \r\nThis is an opportunity for me to express the wish that \r\nassistance in combating climate change not replace \r\nofficial development assistance. \r\n We have not come to this sixty-fourth session of \r\nthe General Assembly to point an accusing finger at the \r\nStates responsible for global warming, but rather, like \r\nthe brother countries of Africa, to convey a message to \r\nthe leaders of the world. Africa will continue its efforts \r\nto preserve its forest ecosystems, but the rich countries \r\nmust assume their responsibilities to reach concrete \r\nproposals for post-Kyoto. \r\n We support France’s proposal at the summit on \r\nclimate change, held on 22 September 2009, for the \r\nestablishment of a world environment organization, the \r\nimplementation of the Bali Road Map through \r\ntechnology transfers to developing countries, and the \r\nfinancing of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas \r\nemissions. However, we strongly hope that, in \r\nCopenhagen next December, the common position of \r\nthe countries of Central Africa, which share the forests \r\nof the Congo basin, will be taken into account. \r\n Allow me here to recall that the countries of \r\nCentral Africa, members of the Commission for the \r\nForests of Central Africa (COMIFAC), signed a \r\ndeclaration in Bangui on 11 September 2008 in which \r\nthey call on the institutions of the United Nations \r\nsystem, the European Union, the International \r\nOrganization of la Francophonie, the Secretariat of the \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development and the \r\nhigh-level panel of experts to support them in their \r\neffort, inter alia, to include issues relating to the \r\nmanagement of tropical forests in the post-Kyoto \r\narrangements.  \r\n The forests of the Congo basin, the second largest \r\nforest system in the world, play a key role in regulating \r\nthe global climate. The efforts to conserve and \r\nsustainably manage the forests of that natural space \r\nagreed to by the member countries of COMIFAC \r\nshould be encouraged as part of the process of reducing \r\nemissions from deforestation and forest degradation in \r\ndeveloping countries. In Copenhagen, we must reach a \r\nfair agreement, based on win-win partnerships that \r\nenable developing countries to reconcile the \r\npreservation of natural resources with economic \r\ndevelopment. \r\n The Central African Republic fully supports the \r\nstatement made by the Chairperson of the African \r\nUnion Commission at its recent special session on the \r\nconsideration and resolution of conflicts in Africa, held \r\nin Tripoli, Libya, on 31 August 2009. It shares the \r\nconviction that economic growth and sustainable \r\n A/64/PV.8\r\n \r\n39 09-52470 \r\n \r\ndevelopment are intertwined with the status of and \r\ntrends in world peace and security.  \r\n In view of the proliferation of arms of all kinds, \r\ndisarmament is a pressing issue. The United Nations \r\nDisarmament Commission must promote resolutions \r\nthat encourage multilateralism in the area of \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation, the reduction of \r\nmilitary budgets and respect for environmental \r\nstandards in the drawing up and implementation of \r\ndisarmament agreements. An effort is also needed to \r\novercome the current impasse and to achieve nuclear \r\ndisarmament and nuclear non-proliferation in all their \r\nforms. The strategic doctrine adopted by nuclear-\r\nweapon States that justifies the use of or threat of the \r\nuse of atomic weapons is as dangerous as uranium \r\nenrichment for weapons purposes and should simply be \r\ndiscarded.  \r\n On the other hand, a national security concept \r\nbased on the promotion and development of military \r\nalliances and nuclear deterrence policies seems better \r\nsuited to the ideals that we pursue. The Central African \r\nRepublic welcomes the initiative of United States \r\nPresident Obama in convening a meeting of the \r\nSecurity Council on nuclear non-proliferation and \r\nnuclear disarmament. \r\n Terrorism is the most flagrant violation of \r\ninternational law. It prevents people from enjoying \r\ntheir basic freedoms and destabilizes legitimately \r\nestablished Governments. For those reasons, it must \r\nnot be tolerated by or associated with any religion, \r\ncivilization, ethnic group or claim, however legitimate \r\nit may seem. My country resolutely condemns terrorist \r\nacts and aligns itself with the fight against terrorism \r\nbeing carried out by the committees established by the \r\nUnited Nations Security Council. \r\n The issue of the control of conventional weapons \r\nat the regional level is all the more relevant in view of \r\nthe fact that it is the most effective way to tackle the \r\nillegal proliferation of armed groups and transnational \r\ncrime. The peace and security of Central Africa are \r\nhampered by that recurrent problem. Armed groups \r\nthreaten the stability of the national institutions of \r\nsome of our States. Along those lines, the \r\ncomprehensive peace agreement signed at Libreville in \r\nneighbouring Gabon on 21 June 2008 enabled the \r\nCentral African Republic to thwart an ill-intentioned \r\nplot to seize power. \r\n However, its concern, like that of other States of \r\nAfrica’s Great Lakes region, such as the Sudan, the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda, is with \r\nthe criminal activities of the uprising of the so-called \r\nLord’s Resistance Army, which has become a \r\ntransnational criminal organization, causing death and \r\ndestruction as far as the Central African Republic. Its \r\ndestructive capacity goes beyond the territory of the \r\nRepublic of Uganda and is becoming a regional \r\nproblem, for which an agreed solution is essential. The \r\naffected States are striving to achieve that with the \r\nlimited resources that they have. \r\n I am convinced that the Charter of the United \r\nNations and international law continue to be essential \r\ninstruments and the pillars of the preservation and \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. \r\nRepresenting nearly the entire international \r\ncommunity, the United Nations has well-established \r\ninternational legitimacy and is the best forum for \r\nfinding a lasting solution to problems of that kind.  \r\n The United Nations remains the primary and \r\nfundamental forum for addressing world issues and \r\nseeking consensus. That is why we Member States \r\nattach great importance to strengthening its role and \r\nbelieve that reform is necessary in order to develop its \r\nfull potential. The reform must be comprehensive and \r\ncover all areas, while respecting its political nature and \r\nits intergovernmental and universal character. \r\n However, adjustments to two organs of our \r\nOrganization seem to be a priority in that reform: the \r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly. The \r\nGeneral Assembly must be invigorated by giving \r\ngreater weight to its role and to its authority as the \r\nmain deliberative and representative organ of the \r\nMember States. The General Assembly’s prerogatives \r\nas the chief oversight body of the United Nations, even \r\nin the area of peacekeeping, must be respected. \r\n As for reform of the Security Council, it must be \r\ndirected at achieving transparency and balance within \r\nthat body. Its enlargement will enable better \r\nrepresentation of all regions in order to allow us to \r\ndebate new approaches to the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. This is an African \r\nposition that has been advocated during this general \r\ndebate by the Leader of the Great Socialist People’s \r\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya (see A/64/PV.3), and it is one \r\nthat the Central African Republic supports. My country \r\nhopes that reform of the United Nations system will \r\nA/64/PV.8  \r\n \r\n09-52470 40 \r\n \r\nhave a positive impact on the development of \r\nmultilateral cooperation in our ever-changing world. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister of the Central African Republic for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Faustin Archange Touadera, Prime Minister \r\nof the Central African Republic, was escorted \r\nfrom the rostrum. \r\n \r\nAddress by The Honourable Edward Nipake \r\nNatapei, Prime Minister of the Republic of Vanuatu \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Vanuatu. \r\n The Honourable Edward Nipake Natapei, Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Vanuatu, was escorted \r\nto the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency The \r\nHonourable Edward Nipake Natapei, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Republic of Vanuatu, and inviting him to address \r\nthe General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Natapei (Vanuatu): I begin by joining others \r\nin congratulating Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on \r\nassuming the noble and high responsibility of the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth \r\nsession. Let me wish him well in his leadership as the \r\nUnited Nations makes its way through the myriad \r\nevolving challenges on the global agenda. I also take \r\nthis opportunity to commend the Secretary-General for \r\nhis vision and for the initiatives that he has resolutely \r\npursued in the interests of all humanity. \r\n The theme of the sixty-fourth General Assembly \r\nsession will serve to focus the attention of the \r\ninternational community on the critical importance of \r\nbuilding partnerships for more equitable and \r\nsustainable development. My delegation shares the \r\nbelief that sustainable development is the responsibility \r\nof everyone, and that its realization requires strong \r\npartnerships at all levels. I firmly believe that equity \r\nand sustainable development are mutually reinforcing \r\ngoals, for it would be difficult to support peace, \r\nsecurity and growth in any process of development that \r\nleft much of humanity behind.  \r\n One of the major goals of my country’s \r\ncomprehensive reform programme, introduced during \r\nthe mid-1990s, is to promote social equity, especially \r\nin terms of integrating the needs of our culturally \r\ndiverse people and geographically remote communities \r\ninto our national development priorities. I am glad to \r\nsay that we are still pursuing our nationwide policy \r\nconsultation processes, aimed at developing and \r\nmaintaining sound policies and frameworks for \r\ndelivering services to our people at the grass-roots \r\nlevel. \r\n We in the Pacific are grateful to all our \r\ndevelopment partners for their continuing support and \r\ntheir commitment to working closely with us in \r\ndeveloping mechanisms for strengthening development \r\ncoordination, improving development outcomes, using \r\navailable resources effectively and ensuring \r\ninclusiveness in our approach to development. \r\n We are very much aware of the fact that despite \r\ncontinued high levels of development assistance over \r\nmany years, the economic and development \r\nperformance of island States in the Pacific region \r\nremains weak. Many countries in our region, including \r\nVanuatu, are not on track to achieve all the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) by 2015. Vanuatu will \r\ntherefore remain firmly committed to the principles of \r\nthe Cairns Compact on Strengthening Development \r\nCoordination in the Pacific. We are committed to \r\nworking closely with the Pacific Islands Forum \r\nSecretariat and other multilateral agencies to ensure \r\nthat all resources made available to the region are \r\nfocused on the aim of achieving real progress towards \r\nthe MDGs. We are also committed to work with our \r\nindividual donor partners to ensure that they support \r\nour national development priorities that are linked to \r\nour overall efforts to achieve the MDGs. \r\n However, Vanuatu is aware that commitments to \r\nstrengthening development coordination in the Pacific \r\nregion are being made against the backdrop of the \r\nglobal economic crisis. My delegation therefore wishes \r\nto renew our call to international financial institutions \r\nto assist Pacific island countries in responding to the \r\ninternational economic crisis. Vanuatu is very \r\nconcerned that its recent high economic growth \r\nperformance, which rose above 6 per cent between \r\n2006 and 2007, will fall sharply as a result of the \r\nglobal economic recession. International Monetary \r\nFund and Asian Development Bank growth estimates \r\nforecast that Vanuatu’s economy will grow at a slower \r\n A/64/PV.8\r\n \r\n41 09-52470 \r\n \r\npace in 2008 and 2009, averaging between 3 and 4 per \r\ncent. Growth prospects for the future continue to be \r\nuncertain. Maintaining strong economic growth over \r\nthe next few years will be critical if Vanuatu is to \r\nsucceed in sustained delivery of such basic services as \r\neducation, health and infrastructure development to its \r\n80 scattered islands. \r\n In the light of these concerns Vanuatu is pleased \r\nthat in February 2010 it will be hosting a Pacific-\r\nUnited Nations Conference on The Human Face of the \r\nGlobal Economic Crisis in the Pacific. Discussions of \r\nthe organizational arrangements for this important \r\nevent are under way between my Government, United \r\nNations specialized agencies actively engaged in the \r\nPacific region and Pacific regional organizations. We \r\nall look forward to the outcome of the conference, \r\nespecially in terms of guidance and support for \r\nbuilding Pacific regional partnerships that can assist us \r\nin addressing the impacts of this and future global \r\neconomic crises on the livelihoods of our people. \r\n The complex and challenging circumstances in \r\nFiji have led to international condemnation and \r\npressure for early elections to be held. Further \r\ninternational pressure has been brought to bear on the \r\nGovernment of Fiji in view of more recent \r\ndevelopments. While Vanuatu is part of the Pacific-\r\nwide regional calls for an early return of democracy in \r\nFiji, my Government believes that continued \r\nengagement of the Fiji Government by the \r\ninternational community will be critical. Under \r\nVanuatu’s chairmanship, the Melanesian Spearhead \r\nGroup has continued to maintain high-level dialogue \r\nwith the Government of Fiji, primarily to ascertain that \r\nGovernment’s views and to put forward the concerns of \r\nneighbouring States. \r\n Vanuatu welcomes the recent establishment of a \r\nfull-fledged department to oversee the implementation \r\nof the framework for change that the Fiji Government \r\nintroduced recently and to facilitate a nationwide \r\nprocess of reconciliation and dialogue. As the closest \r\nneighbouring island State, Vanuatu continues to plead \r\nthat the process of returning Fiji to democracy and \r\nparliamentary legitimacy should be driven by peaceful \r\ndialogue and genuine concern for the socio-economic \r\nwell-being of the people of Fiji. Any punitive measures \r\nwould not be in the economic and social interest of the \r\ngood people of Fiji or the region of the Pacific as a \r\nwhole. We are all too aware of the unprecedented \r\nchallenges that small island developing States like \r\nVanuatu have come to be faced with today. Man-made \r\nor linked with such phenomena as climate change, \r\nthese challenges pose unacceptable implications for the \r\nsocial, economic and political structures of our small \r\nisland States and often have grave security \r\nimplications. \r\n Vanuatu would like at this juncture cordially to \r\napplaud the tireless and collective efforts of all the \r\nisland nations, large and small, in cooperating and \r\nworking together towards the adoption by the General \r\nAssembly this past June of resolution 63/281 on \r\nclimate change and its possible security implications. \r\nThis is indeed a historical milestone for Pacific small \r\nisland developing States, such as my own country, \r\nbecause for the first time the security implications of \r\nclimate change were brought to the attention of the \r\ninternational community. Over the years differing and \r\nconflicting views have stalled the strenuous efforts of \r\nthe small island countries in convincing the world that \r\nthe impact of climate change was irreversible. Inherent \r\nin many of the arguments that needed to be overcome \r\nwas the idea that there was still time. \r\n At this point I wish to reiterate that the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \r\nmust be the principal forum for addressing climate \r\nchange. Given our vulnerabilities and geographic \r\nrealities, we in the Pacific region have been among the \r\nfirst fully to accept the security implications of climate \r\nchange. I would like to stress here that no country, \r\nsmall or large, developed or developing, will be able to \r\navoid the security implications of climate change, \r\nwhich are already affecting the livelihoods of our \r\npeople, as the international community struggles to \r\ncome to terms with the idea that climate change poses \r\na real threat to the future survival of mankind. Unless \r\nall the relevant organs of the United Nations intensify \r\ntheir efforts to consider and address the issue of \r\nclimate change, no word will be more appropriate to \r\nthe global situation under this particular crisis than the \r\nword “doomed”. The momentum seen today forces \r\nupon us the realization that these threats are real and \r\ntherefore require urgent attention. \r\n In preparations for the coming conference in \r\nCopenhagen, leaders of the Alliance of Small Island \r\nStates have agreed this week that more action is \r\nrequired from members of the international community \r\nin living up to their commitments. While globalization \r\nand interdependency have brought with them both \r\nopportunities and challenges for the small island \r\nA/64/PV.8  \r\n \r\n09-52470 42 \r\n \r\nStates, the challenges predominate and are ominous. \r\nThe gathering of world leaders at the Summit on \r\nClimate Change at this year’s General Assembly was a \r\nreaffirmation that climate change presents a security \r\nthreat to all our nations and peoples. \r\n Consisting of volcanic and coral islands, Vanuatu \r\nis one of the smaller island nations in the South Pacific \r\nregion and in the world. Because of Vanuatu’s rapidly \r\ngrowing young population and low economic growth \r\nrate, the United Nations Development Programme \r\n(UNDP) assessment, until very recently, ranked it as \r\none of the poorest countries in the South Pacific \r\nregion. This degree of underdevelopment drastically \r\nlimits its capacity to effectively curb threats associated \r\nwith the adverse impacts of climate change. \r\n More than 80 per cent of the people of Vanuatu \r\nlive off the land through subsistence farming, which \r\nconstitutes their contribution to the national economy. \r\nVanuatuan traditional farming practices have been \r\nshaped by farmers’ subsistence needs and climatic \r\nconditions. Land has always been precious to the \r\nNi-Vanuatu; rights to its ownership and use form a \r\ncentral part of their culture and traditional governance. \r\nThe rapidly growing population of Vanuatu places \r\nincreasing pressure on access to a finite amount of \r\nfarmland. This issue is likely to be compounded by \r\nprobable losses of arable land owing to the adverse \r\neffects of climate change. Such possible losses raise \r\nserious economic, political and security implications \r\nfor Vanuatu. \r\n Not only is Vanuatu among the least developed \r\ncountries, but it remains one of the most disaster-prone \r\nnations among the small island States. It is highly \r\nsusceptible to cyclones, coastal erosion, river flooding, \r\nearthquakes, landslides, tsunamis and volcanic \r\neruptions. \r\n Without doubt these are challenging times. We \r\nfollowed with great interest the recent Conference on \r\nthe World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its \r\nImpact on Development. Vanuatu is deeply concerned \r\nthat the world financial crisis, like climate change, is \r\ncaused by external forces beyond our control, and yet \r\nits rippling effects are quickly reaching our nation’s \r\nmost vulnerable populations. Children, women, the \r\ndisabled and the working poor will be the hardest hit \r\nand the least able to cope with dramatic changes. \r\n Vanuatu is indeed being hurt by a variety of \r\neconomic realities, such as decreasing trade, erratic \r\ncommodity prices, increased borrowing costs and \r\nstrains on official development assistance. One of the \r\nreasons for this downturn is that we are quite \r\ndependent on external financing, in the form of both \r\naid and trade. Furthermore our foreign-exchange \r\nearnings and our Government revenue rely on a small \r\nnumber of commodities. However, we are confident \r\nthat we will be able to counteract those weaknesses in \r\nour economic situation by introducing progressive \r\nmicroeconomic policy mechanisms, improving \r\nGovernment structures and striving to maintain \r\npolitical stability. This plan is in line with working to \r\nimplement the Millennium Development Goals and to \r\nachieve country targets by the year 2015. \r\n Vanuatu emphatically concurs with the premise of \r\nthe upcoming Copenhagen conference that climate \r\nchange is one of the most fundamental challenges ever \r\nto confront humanity. No issue is more fundamental to \r\nlong-term global prosperity, and no issue is more \r\nessential to our survival as a species. I strongly feel \r\nthat a fair and comprehensive global deal in \r\nCopenhagen will represent a step forward for all us, for \r\nnations small or large, developing or developed. \r\nMutual cooperation, respect and trust will be the key \r\npolitical driving forces for a successful deal in \r\nCopenhagen. \r\n While we commend recent efforts to reform the \r\nUnited Nations, Vanuatu shares the view of many other \r\ncountries that to ensure a stronger and more effective \r\nOrganization we need to reconsider the membership of \r\nthe Security Council sooner rather than later. If the \r\nCouncil’s membership better reflected the world’s \r\ngeography and better represented currently \r\nunderrepresented groups, the United Nations would \r\nbuild a stronger sense of common responsibility and \r\ncollective responsiveness. A more representative \r\nCouncil would bring openness and transparency, create \r\nconfidence and ameliorate understanding and \r\ncooperation. \r\n Still, any reform must be implemented in a way \r\nthat does not affect the authority of the Council. Of \r\ncourse there are diverse vested interests among us. But \r\nour common interests and the United Nations role in \r\nfurthering them must continue to hold a central place to \r\nensure the continuity of the international legal \r\nframework. Negotiations must therefore be conducted \r\nin an atmosphere of inclusion and through constructive \r\ndialogue and positive engagement. Diatribes offer no \r\nsolutions. We must remain resolute in our defence of \r\n A/64/PV.8\r\n \r\n43 09-52470 \r\n \r\nthe United Nations; the necessity of this Organization \r\nis continuously made clear by the horrors that the \r\nscourges of armed conflict, disease and famine inflict \r\non people, especially women and children. \r\n On a more administrative level, the highly \r\nbureaucratic procedures and accession mechanisms \r\nestablished by the United Nations system for much \r\nneeded funds have placed unnecessary strain on local \r\ncapacities. As the burgeoning climate crisis looms on \r\nthe horizon we need to identify ways of simplifying \r\nprocedures, such as those for accessing climate change \r\nmitigation funds, and to consider revising delivery \r\nmodalities, including exploring direct access \r\npossibilities. The blueprint for international \r\ncooperation may be in place but it must be followed up \r\nby action. \r\n Finally, my delegation welcomes Security \r\nCouncil resolution 1887 (2009) on non-proliferation of \r\nnuclear weapons and disarmament. The presence of all \r\nthe leaders of the Permanent Five at the meeting (see \r\nS/PV.6191) demonstrates a commitment to control the \r\nspread of weapons of mass destruction. Maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security will always remain \r\nhumanity’s greatest challenge, and there is hope. \r\n Despite all our differences and diversities, human \r\nsecurity for all is our main objective. We recognize the \r\nefforts of the Secretary-General and commend the \r\nmanner in which he has pursued the mobilization of \r\npolitical momentum for Copenhagen with the relevant \r\nbodies of the United Nations. Saving the Earth and \r\nhumanity remains our ultimate goal. \r\n In conclusion, we go to Copenhagen with \r\noptimism. The future is in our hands. Let us not \r\ndeprive future generations of their right to live in a \r\nworld of peace and stability. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Vanuatu for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n The Honourable Edward Natapei, Prime Minister \r\nof the Republic of Vanuatu, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Jean Asselborn, Deputy \r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and \r\nImmigration of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. \r\n Mr. Asselborn (Luxembourg) (spoke in French): \r\nI believe it is fair to say that we have just come \r\nthrough an annus horribilis: a year marked by the \r\nworldwide financial and economic crisis, the worst \r\nsince the Great Depression of 1929; by an increase in \r\nhunger and poverty — we are speaking about some \r\n100 million more people sinking into hunger and \r\nchronic poverty due to the crisis, and more than \r\n1 billion people suffering from hunger in 2009; by the \r\ndramatic rise in unemployment — the International \r\nLabour Organization (ILO) indicates that 50 million \r\nworkers are at risk of losing or have already lost their \r\njobs; by set-backs in the hard-won progress towards \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals; and by the \r\noutbreak of a pandemic. It was also a year during \r\nwhich questions about the relevance of the United \r\nNations and calls for an overhaul of international \r\ngovernance grew ever louder. \r\n Accordingly, we see the need to take stock and \r\ndraw lessons, namely, to review the major challenges \r\nthe international community is confronting in terms of \r\ndevelopment, human rights and the rule of law, \r\npeacekeeping and security, disarmament and \r\nnon-proliferation and the fight against climate change. \r\nAnd what better forum to discuss these issues than the \r\nGeneral Assembly of the United Nations? \r\n The economic crisis that hit the world a year ago \r\nwas even more devastating, as it took place while we \r\nwere still struggling to cope with, without having \r\novercome them, the food and energy crises, as well as \r\nthe acceleration, obviously, of climate change. \r\n I have just mentioned the particularly negative \r\nimpact of the crisis on the poorest. To face those \r\nchallenges, we need concerted action, coherent action, \r\nglobal action, a true global partnership for \r\ndevelopment, based on the shared responsibilities of \r\ndonors and recipients. \r\n My country will continue to assume its share of \r\nresponsibility by maintaining its efforts in terms of \r\nofficial development assistance (ODA). Having spent \r\n0.95 per cent of its gross national income on ODA in \r\n2008, the Government that was elected in June 2009 \r\nhas not only confirmed that it maintains the \r\nquantitative target of 1 per cent of its gross national \r\nincome, but will also continue to insist on the \r\nqualitative improvement of Luxembourg’s cooperation \r\nin order to further increase efficiency, all of it in the \r\nA/64/PV.8  \r\n \r\n09-52470 44 \r\n \r\ncontext of sustainable development integrating \r\neconomic, social and environmental issues. \r\n Luxembourg calls on all Member States to make \r\nthe necessary efforts to keep all the commitments that \r\nwere made together in this forum and that we have \r\nreiterated at the Millennium Summit in Monterrey and \r\nmore recently in Doha. \r\n We must, however, learn the lessons provided by \r\nthis multidimensional crisis and contemplate a more \r\nsystemic reform of the existing multilateral system, \r\nincluding the financial and economic architecture, and \r\nadapt it to the current political and socio-economic \r\nrealities. \r\n As I stated in this forum in June at the \r\nConference on the World Financial and Economic \r\nCrisis and Its Impact on Development, the United \r\nNations and its principal organs must be at the centre \r\nof such a reflection. The Economic and Social Council, \r\nwhich is the central mechanism for coordination and \r\nthe principal organ of the United Nations responsible \r\nfor economic and social issues, will have a particularly \r\nimportant role to play in this regard. \r\n Luxembourg, which chairs the Economic and \r\nSocial Council this year, has assumed its \r\nresponsibilities in that regard and is working towards \r\nfull implementation of the various mandates entrusted \r\nto the Council by Member States in the framework of \r\nthe international Conference. \r\n All these actions require a strong multilateral \r\nframework based on sound legal rules that are binding \r\non all Member States. In times of crisis, unilateral \r\ntendencies unfortunately tend to recur. While it is \r\nimportant that representatives of the major economies \r\nof the world meet to discuss common problems, \r\nparticularly the economic and financial crisis we have \r\nexperienced in recent months, such forums should not \r\nand must not substitute for multilateral structures and \r\nexisting intergovernmental mandates. \r\n In order to retain the relevance of our multilateral \r\nstructures, they must be based on trust and cooperation: \r\ntrust between the citizen and the State, trust among \r\nStates themselves, whether they are from the North or \r\nthe South, rich or poor, and confidence of States in the \r\nUnited Nations, which is our common good. \r\n It lies in our hands to assume our responsibilities, \r\nto overcome our divisions, to move the thinking and \r\nthe decision-making forward, and to ensure \r\nconsistency. It lies in our hands to undertake the \r\nnecessary reform efforts required for a Security \r\nCouncil that reflects, at last, the geopolitical realities \r\nof today, and which is more representative, efficient \r\nand transparent; for a revitalized General Assembly, \r\nand for a stronger and more effective Economic and \r\nSocial Council. It lies in our hands to demonstrate the \r\ncontinued relevance of our Organization and its \r\ncapacity to act and to formulate joint responses, global \r\nresponses and legitimate responses. \r\n In our globalized world, there is no turning away. \r\n We are all concerned, and the challenges we are \r\nfacing are of an ever-increasing complexity, including \r\nin matters of peace and security. Yesterday, we \r\ncommemorated the sixtieth anniversary of the United \r\nNations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine \r\nRefugees in the Near East (UNRWA), an anniversary \r\nthat one would somehow have preferred not to have to \r\ncelebrate, for while it allowed us to express our \r\ngratitude for the outstanding work done by that United \r\nNations agency in the service of the Palestinian people \r\non a daily basis, it is true, it is also synonymous with \r\nfailure. Sixty years later, the situation in the Middle \r\nEast remains unresolved. \r\n While we welcome that the new Administration \r\nin the United States is determined to seek a solution \r\nbased on the coexistence of two States and a \r\ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East, and while we, \r\ntogether with our European Union partners, are \r\ncommitted to working actively with the United States \r\nand other Quartet members, including, obviously, the \r\nUnited Nations, to achieve this goal, at the same time \r\nwe deeply regret that Israel persists in its policy of \r\ncolonization.  \r\n Mr. Shaheed (Maldives), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n It cannot be repeated too often: the settlement \r\nactivity is not only illegal under international law, but \r\nit is also an obstacle to peace. To continue colonization \r\nis to persist in humiliating the Palestinians, in \r\ndominating the Palestinian people. Without the clear \r\nsignal of an end to this policy, it is unlikely that serious \r\nnegotiations can resume. \r\n We fully support the intention of the President of \r\nthe United States to engage in negotiations, and we \r\nwill support him in this endeavour. Annapolis showed \r\nthat Israelis and Palestinians, when they are alone \r\n A/64/PV.8\r\n \r\n45 09-52470 \r\n \r\naround the negotiating table, are not able to show a \r\nlevel of commitment commensurate with the \r\nfundamental problems, namely, Jerusalem, the question \r\nof refugees and their right to return, security and the \r\nissue of borders. \r\n We call on all parties to shoulder their \r\nresponsibilities and, through their actions, to establish \r\nan environment conducive to the resumption of \r\nnegotiations to resolve the conflict. The end of \r\ndivisions among Palestinians and the intra-Palestinian \r\nreconciliation that is centred on President Mahmoud \r\nAbbas, who has demonstrated in the West Bank that \r\nsubstantial progress in terms of security and \r\ngovernance is possible, are just as much a part of this \r\nas the adoption of confidence-building measures by \r\nIsrael and Arab countries or the simultaneous search \r\nfor solutions to the conflicts between, on the one hand, \r\nIsrael and the Syrian Arab Republic and, on the other \r\nhand, Israel and Lebanon. \r\n In that context, I would also like to stress just \r\nhow urgent it is to find a sustainable solution to the \r\ncrisis in Gaza through the full implementation of \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1860 (2009). An end must \r\nbe put to the untenable situation of 1.5 million \r\nPalestinians living in a prison. Giving hope and \r\nmotivation to the Palestinian people is a basic human \r\nobligation. Light must also be shed on the events in \r\nGaza, including the events following the release of the \r\nUnited Nations fact-finding mission’s report, which has \r\njust been published and which has brought shocking \r\nacts to light. The credibility of the United Nations is at \r\nstake in this matter. \r\n The credibility of the international community \r\ntoo is at stake in a number of respects with regard to \r\nthe situation in Afghanistan. It is at stake as far as the \r\nestablishment and maintenance of peace and security is \r\nconcerned, but also in terms of preserving the rule of \r\nlaw and respect for our fundamental values, ensuring \r\nthe economic and social development of the country \r\nand combating poverty. That was the mandate given to \r\nthe United Nations back in 2001. It has become clear \r\nthat, eight years after the adoption of that mandate, the \r\nprogress made is still not enough. In the light of the \r\nincreasing number of bloody attacks carried out across \r\nthe country, the events surrounding the recent \r\npresidential elections and the alarming figures in terms \r\nof development objectives, public opinion is beginning \r\nto wonder whether in fact we are not moving \r\nbackwards. \r\n There is no easy solution, but there is certainly no \r\nalternative to our continued engagement in the country. \r\nI would like to stress that, together with our European \r\nUnion and NATO partners, we will remain engaged \r\nalongside the authorities and the people of \r\nAfghanistan. There can be no question of abandoning \r\nthe people, who have been devastated by decades of \r\nconflict and violations of their most basic rights. The \r\ngoal must be a stable and democratic State where all \r\nforces, including the Taliban, recognize and respect the \r\nrule of law and basic human rights. \r\n Another conflict area that has long been a source \r\nof concern and where our hopes of lasting peace were \r\nonce again called into question in the past year is the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. Once again it is \r\ncivilians who must suffer the consequences. We are \r\nseriously concerned about the crimes committed \r\nagainst civilians, especially women and children. \r\n In that context I would like to welcome the draft \r\nSecurity Council resolution that provides for concrete \r\nfollow-up to resolution 1820 (2008), on women and \r\npeace and security. Luxembourg fully supports that \r\ntext. I also welcome the personal commitment of the \r\nSecretary-General in the fight against sexual violence. \r\nIt is important that the United Nations system as a \r\nwhole address the phenomenon of sexual violence, \r\nwhich is used increasingly as a weapon of war in \r\narmed conflict even after hostilities have ended. It is \r\nessential to strengthen efforts to prevent such acts from \r\nhappening and to bring to justice those who commit \r\nthose horrible crimes. \r\n While much remains to be said about the \r\nchallenges in terms of the maintenance of peace and \r\nsecurity, especially in the context of the current debate \r\non the future of peacekeeping operations — a debate \r\nthat I applaud — allow me to dwell for a moment on \r\nthe current encouraging developments in the field of \r\ndisarmament and nuclear non-proliferation. \r\n I welcome President Obama’s initiative to engage \r\nthe Security Council in a broader discussion of issues \r\npertaining to non-proliferation and disarmament, \r\nbeyond the specific area of issues related to sanctions. \r\nAs we are only a few months from the eighth Review \r\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), it is \r\nimportant that we demonstrate our determination to \r\ncarry out that task as regards the three pillars of the \r\nA/64/PV.8  \r\n \r\n09-52470 46 \r\n \r\nNPT, the ultimate goal being a world free of nuclear \r\nweapons. \r\n The same goes for the Comprehensive Nuclear-\r\nTest-Ban Treaty (CTBT), the other cornerstone of the \r\nnuclear non-proliferation regime. As I said yesterday \r\nduring the meeting of States that have ratified the \r\nCTBT, the call of the Security Council to sign and \r\nratify the CTBT and the commitment of President \r\nObama to do everything possible to ensure ratification \r\nin the United States are crucial. The Treaty must at last \r\nenter into force. We hope that those encouraging \r\ndevelopments will lead others to adopt a more \r\nconstructive attitude, with full respect for their \r\ninternational obligations. \r\n Beyond non-proliferation issues, however, we \r\nmust not overlook disarmament itself. In that regard, \r\nwe certainly welcome the decision of the United States \r\nand the Russian Federation to conduct negotiations to \r\nconclude a new comprehensive agreement following \r\nthe expiry of the START II Treaty next December. \r\n Allow me as well to say a few words about an \r\nissue that is also relevant in terms of security and \r\ndefence. I am referring to the welcome decision — in \r\nmy opinion, at least — by the United States \r\nAdministration to abandon the effort to put in place a \r\nmissile defence shield. It always seemed to me that the \r\nway forward in that regard was not to adopt unilateral \r\nmeasures, but to engage in discussion and cooperation \r\nwith our Russian partners with a view to ensuring our \r\ncommon security. \r\n I cannot conclude without saying a few words \r\nabout climate change, which is perhaps the greatest \r\nchallenge to world prosperity in the long term. I would \r\nlike to take this opportunity to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral once again for convening the summit of \r\n22 September. That resulted in political mobilization at \r\nthe highest level, which is crucial if we want to make \r\nthe Copenhagen Conference a success and set a new \r\ncourse towards sustainable development and green \r\ngrowth that reduces carbon emissions. \r\n The scientific evidence exists. It is now up to us \r\nto respond with determination in facing those facts. \r\nDeveloped countries will have to set the example by \r\nagreeing to ambitious and higher than average targets \r\nto reduce carbon dioxide by 2050. They must do so by \r\nentering into binding legal commitments, including for \r\nthe medium term, in the context of an effective and \r\nuniversal international regime to which countries \r\ncontribute on the basis of their capacity. \r\n Moreover, the issue of adaptation to climate \r\nchange — including also the financing of related \r\nefforts, which will necessarily constitute an additional \r\nexpense — should be treated as a priority at \r\nCopenhagen. Allow me to note in passing that the \r\ndisarmament efforts that I have just described should \r\nfree up financial resources that could be put to better \r\nuse in this regard. \r\n Meanwhile, together with its partners in the \r\nEuropean Union, Luxembourg has already committed \r\nitself to reach the so-called 20-20-20 goal of increasing \r\nenergy efficiency in the European Union by 20 per \r\ncent, increasing renewable energy by 20 per cent of \r\ntotal energy consumption and reducing greenhouse gas \r\nemissions by 20 per cent compared to 1990 levels. \r\nBeginning several years ago, Luxembourg began to \r\nsystematically incorporate the issue of adaptation to \r\nclimate change in its development programmes. \r\n Climate change, however, will have an impact not \r\nonly on development, but also on the full enjoyment of \r\nhuman rights and on the security of countries. I \r\ntherefore very much welcome the report produced by \r\nthe Secretary-General following the initiative taken in \r\nthat regard by Pacific small island developing States, \r\nwhich addresses the full scope of the problem. \r\n Luxembourg remains firmly convinced of the \r\nrelevance of a multilateral approach in which the \r\nUnited Nations is at the centre. We will continue to \r\nbase our policies and make our contributions with a \r\nview to creating a world that is more just, more \r\npeaceful and more prosperous, as enshrined in our \r\nfounding Charter. It is also because of this passionate \r\nmotivation to work towards a strong and effective \r\nmultilateralism that Luxembourg, a founding Member \r\nof the United Nations, aspires to become, for the first \r\ntime, a non-permanent member of the Security Council \r\nin 2013-2014. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Theodore Brent Symonette, Deputy \r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nBahamas. \r\n Mr. Symonette (Bahamas): On behalf of the \r\nGovernment and people of the Commonwealth of the \r\nBahamas, I convey my sincere congratulations on \r\nMr. Ali Abdussalam Treki’s election to preside over the \r\n A/64/PV.8\r\n \r\n47 09-52470 \r\n \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. My \r\ndelegation wishes to assure him of its full cooperation \r\nand support throughout this session. I would also like \r\nto take this opportunity to congratulate his predecessor, \r\nFather Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann, on his \r\nstewardship of the sixty-third session. \r\n The current global financial and economic crisis, \r\npossibly the worst since the Great Depression, \r\nthreatens to negate all that we have achieved thus far \r\non our development agenda, at both the national and \r\nthe international levels. This threat was acknowledged \r\nat the High-Level Event on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) in September 2008. The \r\nscenario is no better today. \r\n The fallout for the Bahamas has been \r\nconsiderable. Ours is a very small, open economy that \r\nis closely linked to the performance of most developed \r\neconomies. Tourism matters in the Bahamas; it is our \r\nprimary industry and it affects all aspects of economic \r\nlife in our country. We are in the midst of arguably one \r\nof the most difficult tourism seasons on record. Visitor \r\narrivals are down, hotel occupancies are down and \r\nrevenues earned from tourism are down. \r\nUnemployment has sharply increased. The continued \r\neconomic uncertainty means that unemployment will \r\npose a problem until the global economy is stabilized \r\nand returns to growth. In this regard, we are heartened \r\nby some of the signs of global economic recovery. \r\n The Government of the Bahamas acted quickly to \r\nsoften the impact of the international economic \r\ndownturn on our population. We took appropriate steps \r\nto ensure the continued integrity of our domestic fiscal \r\nand financial system; we accelerated planned capital \r\nworks to generate employment and economic activity; \r\nand we increased targeted social relief for those most \r\ndisadvantaged by the crisis. In implementing these \r\npolicies and programmes, the Government exercised \r\nappropriate fiscal restraint, so as to ensure \r\nsustainability in the long term as well as the medium \r\nterm and to encourage and ensure that the economy \r\nwould be well placed to respond swiftly to any upturn \r\nin the global economy. The Bahamas believes that it is \r\ncritically important to global financial health that \r\nactions taken at the national level be complemented by \r\nappropriate international responses. \r\n This year the General Assembly will consider the \r\nscale of assessments for the apportionment of the \r\nexpenses of the United Nations for the period 2010-\r\n2012, as well as the scale of assessments for the \r\napportionment of the expenses of United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations. The Bahamas takes this \r\nopportunity to reiterate its long-standing position that \r\nper capita gross national income (GNI) should not be \r\ngiven undue weight in determining capacity to pay, as \r\nit often leads to distortions. Nowhere is this distortion \r\nmore visible than in the case of the scale of \r\nassessments for peacekeeping operations. The current \r\nscales place the Bahamas, a small developing island \r\nnation, in the same category as the most developed \r\neconomies in the world, with the exception of the \r\npermanent members of the Security Council. This \r\nunjust formula creates an onerous burden, and we call \r\nupon this body to address the inequity, which seriously \r\nundermines the development objectives of the \r\nBahamas, as well as other developing countries. \r\n Clearly the GNI criterion does not properly \r\nreflect either the vulnerability of our economy or the \r\nextraordinary costs associated with the duplication of \r\ninfrastructure required by our archipelagic \r\nconfiguration. Yet, despite our vulnerabilities, we have \r\nnever wavered in our responsibilities as a fully fledged \r\nmember of the international community and will \r\ncontinue to meet our obligations to the United Nations \r\nin the manner prescribed and agreed. While my \r\nGovernment is committed to paying its assessed \r\ncontributions in a full and timely manner, we believe \r\nthat the proposed scale of assessments is unfair and \r\nunduly burdensome to countries such as the Bahamas, \r\nand should therefore be reconsidered and adjusted, \r\ntaking into account those considerations that reflect our \r\nvulnerabilities. \r\n Climate change presents acute challenges for \r\nsmall island developing States such as the Bahamas, \r\nand we are certainly vulnerable to its impact. One of \r\nthe major consequences of climate change for the \r\nBahamas has been the increase in the number, \r\nfrequency and ferocity of the hurricanes affecting our \r\ncountry and region over the last two decades. \r\nRestoration and recovery efforts required as a result of \r\nthese extreme events have taken a toll amounting to \r\nhundreds of millions of dollars over the past decade \r\nalone, diverting scarce resources from other critically \r\nimportant national development programmes and \r\ncompromising our efforts at sustainable development. \r\n Hence, we have a special interest not only in \r\nactions taken to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate \r\nchange but also in measures designed to slow — \r\nA/64/PV.8  \r\n \r\n09-52470 48 \r\n \r\nindeed, to reverse — actions that negatively affect \r\nclimate. As a founding member of the Alliance of \r\nSmall Island States, the Bahamas has joined with many \r\nlike-minded States in our region and around the world \r\nin calling for a global agreement in Copenhagen, with \r\nlegally binding targets, that will permit us to achieve \r\nthe ultimate objectives of the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change. \r\n The Bahamas is cognizant that the responsibility \r\nfor climate change does not rest with developed \r\ncountries alone. Within our limited capabilities, we \r\nhave undertaken a number of appropriate actions, \r\nhighlighted during the High-Level Event, in order to \r\nincrease our resistance to the adverse impacts of \r\nclimate change. But it is also important that initiatives \r\nundertaken in the quest for environmental protection \r\ndo not cause greater harm than good. For example, the \r\nintroduction of an air-passenger levy will damage our \r\nalready weakened tourism industry, the industry that is \r\nour economic lifeline. The proposed marine bunkering \r\nlevies or taxes are likely to have a similar negative \r\nimpact on our maritime registry’s cost competitiveness. \r\nSuch supposedly well-intentioned environmental \r\ninitiatives come at a time when resources available for \r\nadaptation are not readily available to small island \r\ndeveloping States like the Bahamas. \r\n As an archipelagic nation, the Bahamas faces \r\nparticular challenges in the area of maritime safety and \r\nsecurity. My Government has committed tremendous \r\nfinancial and technical resources to combat illicit \r\ntrafficking of drugs and weapons; illegal, unreported \r\nand unregulated fishing and human smuggling, and \r\nunderscores the need for effective cooperation and \r\ncoordination among States, as well as the development \r\nof innovative approaches to resolve those issues and \r\ncomplement national efforts. The Bahamas welcomes \r\nthe constructive engagement of the United Nations and \r\nthe International Maritime Organization in addressing \r\nthe issue of piracy. As the country with the world’s \r\nthird largest ship registry, the Bahamas will continue to \r\nengage with its partners in the international community \r\nto ensure the safety and security of international \r\nshipping. \r\n Haiti is a near neighbour and a member of our \r\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM). The Bahamas and \r\nthe Caribbean Community States are committed to \r\nHaiti’s stabilization and to its political and economic \r\ndevelopment in the short and long terms. This cannot \r\nbe achieved without sustained support from the \r\ninternational community. The Bahamas is therefore \r\nheartened by the United Nations active and sustained \r\nengagement in Haiti over the past four and a half years, \r\nthrough the work of the United Nations Stabilization \r\nMission in Haiti. We share the hope of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that Haiti is moving away from a history of \r\nconflict towards a future of peaceful and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\n We call on the Security Council to further extend \r\nthe mandate of the United Nations Stabilization \r\nMission in Haiti beyond 15 October 2009, as \r\nrecommended by the Secretary-General. We are also \r\nhopeful that the recent appointment of former United \r\nStates President Bill Clinton as the Secretary-General’s \r\nSpecial Envoy for Haiti will help to keep the issues \r\naffecting Haiti at the forefront of the agenda of the \r\nnational and international community. The Security \r\nCouncil meeting on Haiti earlier this month was \r\ncertainly most welcome in this regard. \r\n An increased level of criminal activity is creating \r\nnew challenges for the Bahamas — a phenomenon \r\nshared with other countries in our region. We continue \r\nto implement national and regional anti-crime \r\ninitiatives to combat this scourge, which undermines \r\nour economies and, indeed, affects our social stability. \r\n Illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and small arms \r\nand light weapons are major contributing factors to this \r\nphenomenon. The Bahamas — as many are aware — is \r\nnot a producer of illicit drugs; neither the Bahamas nor \r\nthe other States members of CARICOM are \r\nmanufacturers or suppliers of small arms and light \r\nweapons. Yet, illicit drugs and light weapons account \r\noverwhelmingly for the amount of crime in our \r\nsocieties. A disproportionate amount of our scarce \r\nbudgetary resources are dedicated to fighting illicit \r\ndrug and light arms trafficking through our territory \r\nand in dealing with the terrible fallout in our \r\ncommunities. \r\n The Bahamas is fully committed to enhancing \r\nregional and international cooperation in the area of \r\npeace and security. We are pleased that the United \r\nNations Office on Drugs and Crime has agreed to \r\nre-engage with the Caribbean region to support the \r\nfight against the crime and violence that today mar our \r\nsocieties. \r\n In closing, my delegation wishes to state that the \r\ncurrent economic crisis dramatically demonstrates the \r\ninterdependence of the economies of the world. This in \r\n A/64/PV.8\r\n \r\n49 09-52470 \r\n \r\nturn shows the critically important role which \r\norganizations like the United Nations can play in \r\nfacilitating dialogue and crafting creative solutions to \r\nglobal problems. As we continue to face these \r\nunprecedented global challenges, the Bahamas \r\nreaffirms its commitment to engaging fully and \r\nconstructively with its partners in the international \r\ncommunity to find collective solutions to the \r\nchallenges which confront all of us. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on \r\nHis Excellency The Honourable Fredrick Fono, Deputy \r\nPrime Minister of Solomon Islands. \r\n Mr. Fono (Solomon Islands): I bring warm \r\ngreetings to the Assembly from the happy isles and \r\nconvey my Government and people’s profound \r\ncongratulations to Mr. Treki on his assumption of the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth \r\nsession. We are confident that, under his leadership, we \r\nwill harvest the opportunities the global agenda has to \r\noffer. \r\n My delegation further takes this opportunity to \r\ncommend his predecessor, Mr. Miguel d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann. He indeed provided exemplary leadership \r\nand inspired us to realize our unique collective \r\nstrength. Throughout his tenure in office, he kept the \r\nmost vulnerable people at the front, centre and back of \r\nall of our engagements. We wish him God’s blessing in \r\nhis future endeavours. \r\n The global financial and economic crisis has \r\npresented immense challenges to the international \r\ncommunity. Simply put, the effects of the crisis are \r\nimpacting all members of the United Nations family. \r\nConsequently, Solomon Islands’ economy has been hit \r\nby low commodity prices, declining revenues and \r\nwidening budgetary deficits. My country has responded \r\nby freezing all Government recruitment and reducing \r\nnational recurrent and development expenditures by \r\n35 per cent. Between 2008 and 2009, our economic \r\ngrowth has taken a negative dive from 6 per cent to \r\n1 per cent, which is affecting the delivery of services to \r\nour people. \r\n The world has taken measures to address the \r\nsystematic fragilities of the international financial \r\nsystem. To this end, Solomon Islands welcomes the \r\noutcome of the June 2009 Conference on the financial \r\ncrisis, calling for greater cooperation by all, including \r\nthe reform of the Bretton Woods institutions. We \r\nremain hopeful that the stimulus packages dished out \r\nreach the poorest of the poor, as many will be under \r\nstress for a long time to come. \r\n Frequent natural disasters are threatening \r\ndevelopment across the world and climate change \r\ncontinues to affect the lives of our people, creating new \r\npockets of poverty while continuing to increase as \r\nthreats. Unless an ambitious outcome emanates from \r\nCopenhagen, we will find that we are fighting a losing \r\nbattle. I join the call for urgent action, particularly for \r\nsmall island developing States and least developed \r\ncountries. For us, climate change poses the most \r\nserious threat to our survival and viability, and \r\nundermines our efforts to achieve sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Solomon Islands fully subscribes to the \r\ndeclaration issued this week by the Alliance of Small \r\nIslands Developing States. The benchmark for the \r\nnegotiations must be founded on the vulnerability of \r\nthe small island developing States and the least \r\ndeveloped countries. Science tells us that the future of \r\nlow-lying islands is uncertain unless deep and \r\nambitious cuts to harmful greenhouse gas emissions \r\nare undertaken by Annex 1 countries at levels greater \r\nthan 45 per cent of 1990 levels by 2020 and more than \r\n95 per cent of 1990 levels by 2050. We call for the \r\nglobal average temperature to increase well below \r\n1.5 degrees Celsius if we are to prevent the \r\nacidification of our oceans from threatening our very \r\nexistence. \r\n Deforestation and forest degradation contribute \r\nnearly 20 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions. \r\nSolomon Islands agrees that this should be one of the \r\nmitigating solutions for protecting the health of our \r\nenvironment. We further urge that this be considered as \r\nan outcome in Copenhagen. My country is currently \r\ncarrying out an inventory of its forests and intends to \r\nparticipate in the carbon market. We also hope that \r\nmultilateral financial mechanisms will become \r\navailable to the most vulnerable States in ensuring that \r\nappropriate technology transfer for renewable energy \r\nreceives the attention it deserves. \r\n Solomon Islands is a peace-loving country and \r\nbelieves that we need to seriously seek a stable \r\ninternational system. This can be achieved by calling \r\nfor global restraint on all military spending and making \r\na firm commitment to begin holistic multilateral \r\ndisarmament negotiations. This is an issue that has \r\nbeen stalled for years on end and continues to be \r\nA/64/PV.8  \r\n \r\n09-52470 50 \r\n \r\nweakly addressed through piecemeal multilateral arms \r\nagreements. \r\n Solomon Islands emerged from a conflict \r\nsituation 11 years ago. This year marks the sixth \r\nanniversary of our partnership with the Regional \r\nAssistance Mission to the Solomon Islands, commonly \r\nreferred to as RAMSI. Under the partnership, State \r\ninstitutions have been strengthened and political \r\nstability has allowed our Parliament to enact some \r\n30 laws in less than 24 months. Public services are \r\nreaching out to the scattered populations on our \r\nhundreds of islands, indicating that change is \r\nhappening. \r\n This year, our relationship with RAMSI has \r\nprogressed from one of assistance to one of \r\npartnership, providing for a framework of cooperation \r\nbetween the two parties, with clearly defined joint \r\nstrategic goals, distinct roles and commitments, with \r\nthe overall objective of creating a secure, stable and \r\nself-sustaining socio-economic and political system for \r\nall Solomon Islanders. The Foreign Relations \r\nCommittee of our national Parliament has completed \r\nits review of the facilitation of the International \r\nAssistance Act and will submit its report to the national \r\nlegislature in November. I take this moment to thank \r\nmy Pacific neighbours for their continued support and \r\ncontribution to the Regional Mission. It is our fervent \r\nhope that this partnership can increase its international \r\nvisibility and interact more with the United Nations, as \r\nprovided for under the relevant chapter of the Charter. \r\n As part of our nation-building and healing \r\nprocess, Solomon Islands instituted its Truth and \r\nReconciliation Commission in April. Officiating at the \r\nlaunch of the Commission was Nobel laureate and \r\nArchbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu of South Africa. \r\nThe Commission allows Solomon Islands to revisit one \r\nof the darkest chapters of its history, and we do so with \r\ncourage, perseverance and a desire to seek a just and \r\npermanent peace within our growing nation. To this \r\nend, we thank the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme (UNDP) and all our partners for their \r\nsupport. \r\n The time frame for the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) is fast drawing to a close. The Solomon \r\nIslands supports the proposal to convene a review \r\nsummit next year, and hopes that the forthcoming \r\ngathering will reinvigorate our global partnership and \r\nenable it to realize the Millennium Development Goals \r\nwithin the given time frame. My country also \r\nwelcomes the decision of the General Assembly \r\n(resolution 63/227) to convene the Fourth United \r\nNations Conference on the Least Developed Countries \r\nin 2011. Similarly, we welcome the review of the \r\nMauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of \r\nthe Programme of Action for the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States, \r\nscheduled for next year. Both review processes should \r\nstrengthen the global partnerships and commitments \r\nundertaken within agreed international cooperative \r\nframeworks. \r\n Eighty five per cent of the population of Solomon \r\nIslands resides in rural areas. Therefore, we have \r\nadopted a rural-focused development approach in our \r\nefforts to meet the MDGs. Solomon Islands is poised to \r\nmake gains in achieving some of these goals through \r\nvarious partnerships. In this regard, I am pleased to \r\nacknowledge that, with the support of New Zealand \r\nand the Republic of China, the Solomon Islands is now \r\noffering free basic education for its children through \r\nthe third form. Work has also begun on eliminating \r\nmalaria, the number-one killer in the Solomon Islands, \r\nwith the launch of the programme in one of our nine \r\nprovinces. My Government thanks Australia for its \r\nsupport and contribution to that end. I also wish to \r\nthank the Republic of China, the European Union and \r\nother development partners for their contribution to the \r\nadvancement of the Government’s rural development \r\npolicy. \r\n Human development remains a key ingredient of \r\nour fight against poverty. Solomon Islands opened a \r\nschool of tourism this year. We have shifted resources \r\ntowards developing our tourism industry in order to \r\noffset the projected revenue loss resulting from the \r\nreduced harvesting of our natural forests. The same \r\npolicy also applies to the agriculture, fisheries and \r\nmining sectors. \r\n South-South cooperation continues to invest in \r\nour people; it has guaranteed the education of \r\n50 students studying in Cuba, and my country thanks \r\nCuba for the gesture. Solomon Islands also thanks its \r\nMelanesian neighbour Papua New Guinea for its \r\nongoing bilateral assistance by increasing our presence \r\nin Port Moresby and offering scholarships to our \r\nstudents studying in Papua New Guinea. \r\n Global dynamics have changed since the United \r\nNations was established 64 years ago. The membership \r\n A/64/PV.8\r\n \r\n51 09-52470 \r\n \r\nthen numbered only 51. Reform of the Security \r\nCouncil has eluded us for the past 15 years. We \r\ntherefore need to increase the legitimacy of our \r\nCouncil and strengthen its role in preserving \r\ninternational peace. In this regard, my delegation was \r\npleased to see the debate on Security Council reform \r\nprogress into informal intergovernmental negotiations \r\nat the previous session of the General Assembly. We \r\nare equally pleased to note that three rounds of \r\nnegotiations have occurred in the past eight months, \r\nsignifying that the multilateral seed of reform of our \r\ninstitutions has been sowed. We need to ensure that it \r\ntakes root at this session. \r\n The relations of the Secretariat with Member \r\nStates are important. The interaction of Solomon \r\nIslands with our Organization has grown and matured \r\nover time. Our Government is now finalizing the \r\nallocation of land to give the United Nations a \r\npermanent home in our capital. We hope that the \r\nSecretariat will reciprocate this gesture and seriously \r\nconsider maintaining a fully fledged country presence \r\nin Solomon Islands. Comparatively speaking, despite \r\nthe fact that my nation has one of the largest \r\nsubregional country programmes, relations continue to \r\nbe micromanaged from abroad. My delegation takes \r\nthis opportunity once again to renew our call to \r\nupgrade the UNDP country presence in Solomon \r\nIslands from Deputy Resident Representative level to \r\nResident Representative. \r\n Here it would be remiss of me not to welcome \r\nUNDP’s new Administrator, Ms. Helen Clark. We wish \r\nher every success in her tenure in office and are \r\nconfident that she will look at all issues with fresh \r\neyes. Development is, after all, one of the highest \r\ncallings of our Organization. Solomon Islands also \r\nencourages the Secretariat to ensure that its staff \r\nrepresents the diversity of its membership, in particular \r\nthat of States that have yet to fulfil their quota. \r\n Over the past couple of months, coastal States \r\nwith continental shelves have made submissions to \r\nextend their respective territorial claims beyond their \r\n200-mile exclusive economic zones. I am pleased to \r\ninform this Assembly that Solomon Islands has \r\nsubmitted a number of claims and looks forward to \r\nworking with the Commission on the Limits of the \r\nContinental Shelf. \r\n While extending an exclusive economic zone is a \r\nsovereign decision, we are mindful of our global \r\nenvironmental responsibilities. Solomon Islands is one \r\nof the six countries of the Coral Triangle Initiative. \r\nThree months ago, leaders from the Philippines, \r\nMalaysia, Indonesia, Timor-Leste, Papua New Guinea \r\nand Solomon Islands met in Indonesia and agreed to \r\nwork collaboratively across political boundaries to \r\nconserve 75 per cent of the world’s coral species, \r\n40 per cent of the world’s reef fish species and 51 per \r\ncent of the world’s mangrove species. Our populations \r\nrely on our marine resources for survival and income. \r\nWe hope to keep it that way for generations to come. \r\n Good information and data are vital to allowing \r\nnational and international systems to make informed \r\ndecisions. In this connection, we would like to see \r\nUnited Nations support for our national statistics office \r\nfor the collation of data in real time and its distribution \r\nto all decision makers. \r\n To foster a vibrant economy, investment in \r\ninfrastructure is needed. I am pleased to say that we \r\nhave finally enacted a law that will open up our \r\ntelecommunications industry to competition. \r\n On the issue of human rights, Solomon Islands \r\nrecognizes that all human rights are universal, \r\nindivisible, interrelated, interdependent and mutually \r\nreinforcing. All human rights must be treated in a fair \r\nand equal manner, on the same footing and with the \r\nsame emphasis. That is one of the principles of the \r\nnewly established Human Rights Council. \r\n Solomon Islands continues to support the \r\nCouncil’s internationally agreed principles. \r\nUnfortunately, within the Third Committee issues of \r\nhuman rights continue to be heavily politicized, \r\ndivisive and country-specific, in disregard of the \r\nuniversal principles of cooperation and dialogue. My \r\ndelegation would like to see the universal periodic \r\nreview be the reference point for assessing countries’ \r\nhuman rights situations. \r\n Before I say anything about Taiwan’s cross-Strait \r\nrelations, Solomon Islands conveys its sympathy and \r\nembraces the pain and suffering of all those impacted \r\nby typhoon Morakot. We also acknowledge the spirit \r\nand strength of the Government and people of the \r\nRepublic of China in rising above that tragedy with \r\nresilience to rebuild their lives and recover from the \r\nnatural catastrophe. \r\n My country continues to follow cross-Strait \r\ndevelopments with deep interest. A new era of relations \r\nA/64/PV.8  \r\n \r\n09-52470 52 \r\n \r\nis emerging between the Republic of China and the \r\nPeople’s Republic of China. Relations have been \r\nmarked by an increased series of engagements. Direct \r\nflights, shipping, postal cooperation and exchanges on \r\nfood safety, inter alia, have been initiated. This people-\r\ncentred approach continues to build bridges of trust, \r\ntolerance and confidence. We wish this positive \r\ninteraction every success. \r\n Earlier this year, my delegation was encouraged \r\nto witness Taiwan’s admission as an observer to the \r\nWorld Health Assembly. We hope with all sincerity that \r\nsimilar overtures will be accorded to Taiwan by other \r\nspecialized entities within the United Nations system. \r\n On the question of the Middle East, my \r\ndelegation associates itself with the statement of \r\nFinland’s former President, Nobel Peace Prize recipient \r\nMr. Martti Ahtisaari, when he said “All conflicts can be \r\nsettled, and there are no excuses for allowing them to \r\nbecome eternal”. To find a lasting and just peace in the \r\nregion, the determination of all Members is required. \r\nFor 62 years, the matter has been discussed within this \r\nAssembly. Solomon Islands believes that, in the right \r\nconditions, a politically negotiated two-State solution \r\ncan be reached. We support all international efforts in \r\nfinding a lasting and permanent solution. \r\n In our effort to create a better world, dialogue and \r\ncooperation between religions and cultures are needed. \r\nStereotypes created by a few must be overcome. \r\nExtremists thrive on mistrust, fear and suspicion and \r\nuse them to their advantage. They must be isolated. My \r\ndelegation acknowledges the initiative of Saudi Arabia \r\nto bring together leaders from the East and West in \r\npromoting a global culture of peace. This initiative \r\npresents a new beginning that we should all build \r\nupon. \r\n We must all work towards stabilizing the \r\ninternational system, which means that those with \r\npower must not victimize the weak by interfering with \r\nthe latter’s health and social needs, be it for \r\nideological, political or security reasons. Unilateral and \r\nregional economic blockades and punitive action by \r\nStates and intergovernmental institutions must and \r\nshould be replaced with genuine cooperation and \r\nsincere dialogue. In this regard, we call on the entire \r\ninternational community to fully engage with Fiji. As \r\nits Melanesian neighbour, Solomon Islands continues \r\nto do so at all political levels. \r\n In closing, in view of the many challenges we are \r\nconfronting today, the words of Abraham Lincoln in \r\n1862 still holds true:  \r\n “The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to \r\nthe stormy present. The occasion is piled high \r\nwith difficulty, and we must rise with the \r\noccasion. As our case is new, so we must think \r\nanew, and act anew”. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Kanat Saudabayev, Secretary of State \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of \r\nKazakhstan. \r\n Mr. Saudabayev (Kazakhstan) (spoke in \r\nRussian): At the outset, I would like to congratulate \r\nMr. Treki on his election to the high post of President \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session and \r\nwish him every success as he presides over the session.  \r\n Eight years ago, on 11 September, Ms. Zhannetta \r\nTsoy, a citizen of Kazakhstan, having kissed her \r\ndaughter and husband, left for her first day at a new job \r\nin New York’s tallest building. Two hours later, she \r\nperished, along with 3,000 Americans and citizens of \r\nother 91 countries. She was buried under the debris of \r\nwhat had once been the World Trade Centre’s Twin \r\nTowers. On that day, as Kazakhstan’s ambassador in \r\nWashington D.C., along with all Americans and others, \r\nI felt acutely how fragile, vulnerable and \r\ninterdependent our world had become. This terrorist act \r\nand the world’s unity in its strict condemnation showed \r\nthat only together can we make our present and our \r\nfuture safer and better. Indeed, the key to the \r\nsuccessful resolution of today’s most acute problems \r\nlies precisely in the world’s unity and understanding. \r\n President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan \r\nand our entire people have supported the global fight \r\nagainst terrorism from the start by assisting the efforts \r\nof the international coalition in Afghanistan. However, \r\nthere has never been and there will never be a purely \r\nmilitary solution to the Afghan problem. We note with \r\nsatisfaction that coalition members have begun to pay \r\nmore attention to non-military aspects of security. \r\n To the best of its ability, Kazakhstan is also \r\nassisting the international efforts to rehabilitate \r\nAfghanistan. We provide considerable humanitarian aid \r\nto that country. Moreover, we are developing a long-\r\nterm educational programme to train qualified Afghan \r\n A/64/PV.8\r\n \r\n53 09-52470 \r\n \r\nspecialists, and are also considering other forms of \r\nassistance to that country. \r\n Long-term stability in Afghanistan is impossible \r\nwithout effective measures to tackle illicit drug \r\ntrafficking. The Central Asia Regional Information and \r\nCoordination Centre has been established in Almaty, \r\nwith the support of the United Nations, to fight illicit \r\ndrug trafficking. As the Chairperson-in-Office of the \r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \r\n(OSCE) in 2010, I intend to make the stabilization of \r\nthe situation in Afghanistan — a regional neighbour of \r\nthe OSCE — one of the organization’s greatest \r\npriorities. \r\n The prospect of the proliferation of nuclear \r\nweapons, along with the risk of their acquisition and \r\nuse by terrorist organizations, remains one of the most \r\nserious threats to mankind. As a country that has \r\nexperienced the horrors of nuclear tests, shut down the \r\nworld’s second-largest nuclear testing site, at \r\nSemipalatinsk, and voluntarily renounced the world’s \r\nfourth-largest nuclear and missile arsenal, Kazakhstan \r\nhas an absolute moral right to call for more decisive \r\naction in the area of disarmament and for the radical \r\nstrengthening of the non-proliferation of weapons of \r\nmass destruction regime. In particular, Kazakhstan \r\ndeems it important to ensure the soonest possible entry \r\ninto force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban \r\nTreaty. We welcome the efforts of United States \r\nPresident Barack Obama to give new impetus to the \r\nnon-proliferation process and to eliminate the nuclear \r\nthreat. \r\n Kazakhstan is in favour of strengthening and \r\nensuring the universality of the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). We must \r\nrecognize that the Treaty is asymmetric in that it \r\nprovides for sanctions only against non-nuclear-\r\nweapon States, whereas the nuclear Powers themselves \r\nshould set the example of reducing and renouncing \r\ntheir nuclear arsenals. In this regard, Kazakhstan \r\nwelcomed the unanimous adoption yesterday of \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1887 (2009) and believes \r\nthat this historic decision opens a new era in \r\nhumankind’s efforts to create a world without nuclear \r\nweapons. It is gratifying that the measures being \r\nundertaken today by the international community \r\nreflects the principled position that President \r\nNazarbayev has expressed more than once from this \r\nrostrum and in bilateral meetings with heads of \r\nnuclear-weapon States and of States with nuclear \r\nambitions. \r\n It is necessary now more than ever to take even \r\nmore decisive actions. Our President has proposed the \r\ndevelopment of a new universal treaty on \r\ncomprehensive horizontal and vertical nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation. The configuration of the new treaty \r\nand its contents will largely depend on the proposals of \r\nall interested States. An effective measure to strengthen \r\nthe non-proliferation regime could be the establishment \r\nof an international nuclear fuel bank under the auspices \r\nof the International Atomic Energy Commission. \r\nKazakhstan is ready to consider the possibility of \r\nlocating it on our territory. \r\n One important contribution made by Kazakhstan \r\nand other States of Central Asia to the implementation \r\nof the NPT was the entry into force in March of the \r\nTreaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central \r\nAsia. The peculiarity of the Zone is that it is located \r\nbetween two of the world’s largest nuclear Powers. The \r\nZone could play a large practical role in preventing the \r\nuncontrolled proliferation of nuclear materials and in \r\ncountering nuclear terrorism. We count on support for \r\nthe Central Asian Zone, above all from the nuclear \r\nPowers, including their possible extension of negative \r\nsecurity guarantees. We support the United States of \r\nAmerica’s initiative to convene a global nuclear \r\nsecurity summit next year. \r\n I wish to draw the attention of the General \r\nAssembly to a proposal of the President of Kazakhstan \r\non declaring 29 August international day for a world \r\nfree of nuclear weapons. That date has deep symbolical \r\nmeaning. On that day in 1949, the Soviet Union \r\nconducted its first nuclear test at the Semipalatinsk test \r\nsite in Kazakhstan, and on the same day in 1991 the \r\ntest site was shut down forever by decree of our \r\nGovernment. We hope that the General Assembly will \r\nsupport this initiative. \r\n Today, humankind is experiencing the most \r\nserious global financial and economic crisis in decades. \r\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund, \r\napproximately 50 States have edged to the brink of an \r\neconomic catastrophe. At the same time, the present \r\ncrisis was largely inevitable. Unfortunately, the world’s \r\neconomic development and the great leap forward in \r\ntechnology over the past 60 years could not solve such \r\neternal problems as poverty and hunger. The gap \r\nbetween the rich and the poor continues to grow. More \r\nA/64/PV.8  \r\n \r\n09-52470 54 \r\n \r\nthan a billion people live on less than $1 a day. Despite \r\nour exceptional achievements in modern science and \r\nmedicine, almost 10 million children under five die \r\nevery year of curable diseases. More than 30 million \r\npeople worldwide live with HIV, while only 3 million \r\nof those have access to antiretroviral therapy. \r\n The economic crisis has forced us to rethink and \r\nrevisit many conceptual approaches that earlier seemed \r\netched in stone. It has demonstrated once again the \r\nurgency of unifying all States’ efforts in addressing \r\nmodern challenges. The leader of our country was \r\namong the first to share his vision for the world’s post-\r\ncrisis development. He proposed drafting an \r\ninternational law on a single world currency, and the \r\neventual establishment of a world emissions centre, a \r\nworld anti-monopoly currency committee and a world \r\ncommittee on market freedom. The United Nations \r\nwith its structural bodies and specialized agencies is \r\nthe only global organization capable of addressing such \r\nlarge-scale issues. \r\n At a time of acute social and economic \r\nbreakdowns, the danger of inter-ethnic and \r\ninter-religious conflicts increases considerably. \r\nLocated at the confluence of Asia and Europe and \r\nhaving maintained peace and harmony in a multi-ethnic \r\nand multireligious country throughout its years of \r\nindependence, Kazakhstan is ready to act as a bridge of \r\nmutual understanding and tolerance between the East \r\nand the West. \r\n As Chair of the OSCE in 2010 and of the 2011 \r\nministerial conference of the Organization of the \r\nIslamic Conference, Kazakhstan is eager fully to use \r\nthis unique opportunity to strengthen constructive \r\ncooperation between diverse cultures and civilizations \r\nand to take concrete measures on this issue. \r\nFurthermore, since 2003 our country has hosted three \r\nCongresses of Leaders of World and Traditional \r\nReligions, supported by the United Nations. \r\n At Kazakhstan’s initiative, the General Assembly \r\nadopted resolution 62/90 at its sixty-second session, \r\ndeclaring 2010 the International Year for the \r\nRapprochement of Cultures. We call on United Nations \r\nMember States to participate actively in celebrating the \r\nYear. Kazakhstan fully supports the goals of the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations and calls on all Member \r\nStates and agencies of the United Nations system to \r\ncontribute to strengthening tolerance and mutual \r\nunderstanding in the world. \r\n In the current circumstances, the regional aspect \r\nof solving global problems takes on added importance. \r\nOur country is firmly committed to the consistent \r\nstrengthening of regional cooperation for security and \r\ndevelopment in Central Asia. A unique security \r\narchitecture is being created in Eurasia, its most \r\nimportant elements being organizations such as the \r\nOSCE, the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-\r\nbuilding Measures in Asia (CICA), the Shanghai \r\nCooperation Organization, the Collective Security \r\nTreaty Organization and NATO. In that regard, CICA, \r\nconvened as a result of an initiative introduced by \r\nPresident Nazarbayev from this rostrum in 1992, has \r\nbecome an effective mechanism for strengthening \r\nregional security and cooperation. In 2010, as our \r\ncountry takes up the chairmanship of the OSCE, we \r\nintend to work for the good of all its member States to \r\nstrengthen the organization’s effectiveness in \r\naddressing new challenges and threats, as well as to \r\nfurther strengthen confidence-building and security \r\nmeasures in the Euro-Atlantic community. \r\n In today’s rapidly changing world, the adaptation \r\nof the United Nations to modern realities is an \r\nimportant task for all Member States. Kazakhstan \r\nsupports the reform process for the United Nations and \r\nits main bodies based on the principled position of the \r\nneed to increase the effectiveness, authority and \r\nrelevance of our global Organization. We are \r\nconvinced that there is no alternative to the United \r\nNations in the modern world, and there never will be. \r\nWe support reforms on three principal tracks: \r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly, \r\nreform of the Security Council and coherence of the \r\nUnited Nations system. \r\n Fifty years ago, Martin Luther King Junior said: \r\n “Men often hate each other because they fear \r\neach other; they fear each other because they do \r\nnot know each other; they do not know each other \r\nbecause they cannot communicate; they cannot \r\ncommunicate because they are separated.” \r\nRegrettably, those words are often true today, but they \r\nshould not be so tomorrow. In an age of globalization \r\nand unprecedented interdependence in the world, there \r\nshould no longer be mistrust, fear and hatred, but the \r\nprinciples of trust, understanding and cooperation \r\nshould triumph. Only together can we properly address \r\nthe difficult challenges facing humankind today and \r\nmake our world safer and better. \r\n A/64/PV.8\r\n \r\n55 09-52470 \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Jean-Marie Ehouzou, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Benin. \r\n Mr. Ehouzou (Benin) (spoke in French): I should \r\nlike at the outset to express my pleasure at seeing \r\nMr. Treki so brilliantly execute the lofty tasks of the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly on behalf of \r\nAfrica. I offer him my warmest congratulations and \r\nwish him every success in that office. I also take this \r\nopportunity to pay tribute to Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon for the sincere commitment that he has \r\nshown. \r\n The path laid down by the founding fathers of the \r\nUnited Nations for the achievement of its goals is that \r\nof dialogue and multilateralism. The United Nations \r\nwas created to harness the energies of the international \r\ncommunity to that end. Soon, we will have been at it \r\nfor seven decades. Where are we today? Painful \r\nfractures hinder humankind and threaten to \r\nconsiderably weaken our capacity for common action. \r\nThe multifaceted crises that have shaken the global \r\neconomy have been caused by its accelerated \r\nglobalization without agreed global governance. These \r\ncrises have mightily stricken the most vulnerable. \r\nFurthermore, they have exposed the planet to grave \r\ndangers, the signs of which are undeniably evident. \r\n We should accept the facts. The time for \r\nassumptions has passed. The time has come for \r\nproactive anticipation, as we now know the cost of \r\nindifference, inertia and passivity. We must restore the \r\ncapacity of the United Nations to fulfil its calling in the \r\npursuit of solutions to the global problems of \r\nhumankind. Through the dialogue of civilizations, we \r\nshould reconcile the specificities connected with the \r\ndiversity of our cultural heritage with the universal \r\nstandards that arise from the inviolability of human \r\ndignity. \r\n The dialogue of civilizations is without doubt an \r\nessential precondition for strengthening \r\nmultilateralism. It can help us return to the \r\nfundamental values of respect for life and for nature, \r\nawareness of our common destiny, the quest for mutual \r\nbenefit, and the sense of permanence, sharing and \r\nhonouring our responsibilities towards future \r\ngenerations. If we wish to reverse the dismal trends \r\nand outlook that scientists have described, we must \r\nconclude a new alliance between man and nature — a \r\nnew common agreement. That is how we can regain \r\ncontrol of the natural and anthropogenic phenomena \r\nthat affect our existence on Earth. The Copenhagen \r\nConference in December will be an excellent \r\nopportunity that we must not squander. \r\n Above all, we should create conditions to ensure \r\nthe responsible contribution of all to fully realizing the \r\npotential of humankind. To that end, we must eliminate \r\nall obstacles to its development. The State and public \r\nauthorities have a vital role to play in that regard. They \r\nmust at all times engage with social partners working \r\nin the service of freedom and progress. \r\n The independent Commission on Legal \r\nEmpowerment of the Poor has shown us the virtues of \r\ngradually eliminating old practices that violate the \r\nintegrity of the individual both as a living being and as \r\na legal and social entity. That is a fundamental \r\nprecondition to guaranteeing the responsible access of \r\nall to the benefits of modernity and shared prosperity. \r\nThat is why Benin has committed to organizing the \r\nregional conference on revitalizing the major \r\nrecommendations of the independent Commission. \r\n To that end also, my country has declared a \r\nresolute war on female genital mutilation through an \r\nawareness campaign, the retraining of practitioners and \r\nthe vigilant enforcement of unambiguous legislation, \r\nbolstered by a new family code that establishes the \r\nequal rights of men and women. That is also why \r\nBenin worked for the proclamation of 2009 as the \r\nInternational Year of Human Rights Learning. The \r\nmain objective of the Year is to promote the necessary \r\nchange in thinking to ensure that humankind moves \r\ntowards full and complete adherence to the universal \r\nvalues enshrined in the United Nations Charter. \r\n The United Nations must be more effective in \r\nsupporting national policies to achieve international \r\nstandards. The Beninese Government has decided to \r\nentrust the rationalization of its efforts in favour of \r\nwomen to a recently established women’s institute. To \r\nthat end, we are very pleased to welcome the imminent \r\nestablishment and operationalization of a composite \r\nentity within the United Nations system for the \r\nadvancement of gender equality. It will make it \r\npossible to ensure the coherent and efficient support of \r\nthe United Nations system for the efforts of Member \r\nStates. \r\n In the context of Africa’s resolute march towards \r\na new beginning, the Beninese Government has \r\nadopted strategic measures based on the elimination of \r\nA/64/PV.8  \r\n \r\n09-52470 56 \r\n \r\npoverty and on reinvigorated economic growth that \r\nwill make Benin an emerging country by 2025. The \r\nchallenges to be met are huge since nearly one third of \r\nthe population of Benin currently lives below the \r\npoverty line in a country vulnerable to the threats of \r\nnatural disasters and where food security is not fully \r\nguaranteed. \r\n The measures implemented in particular by the \r\nGovernment of Mr. Boni Yayi, in place since April \r\n2006 thanks to scrupulous respect for our Constitution, \r\nmark our resolve to move forward. Our economic \r\nperformance in 2006 and 2007 proved that our strategic \r\nchoices were correct. These measures included \r\npromoting microfinancing as an effective means of \r\nfighting poverty and social exclusion, especially that of \r\nwomen, by granting microcredit to the poorest — \r\nespecially women, who are the most important pillar of \r\nsociety although economically disadvantaged; \r\npromoting entrepreneurship and youth employment; \r\nand the launching of multiple training programmes in \r\norder to integrate young people into the fabric of our \r\nsocio-economic structure. We are also working on \r\nmechanizing agriculture, promoting education by \r\noffering free and mandatory primary education, and \r\nmaking free Caesarean sections available as a better \r\napproach to reproductive health. \r\n These social measures were implemented at the \r\nsame time that major work was begun on \r\ninfrastructure. However, the ongoing economic \r\nrecession and the worsening harmful consequences of \r\nclimate change threaten to seriously jeopardize the \r\nconsiderable progress made in implementing this \r\npivotal national project. \r\n Only one year ago, the International Monetary \r\nFund predicted that the gross domestic product of \r\nsub-Saharan African countries would increase by \r\n6.7 per cent on average in 2009. Those forecasts were \r\nrevised downward a few months later to 5.1 per cent, \r\nthen to 3.5 per cent and last March to 3.25 per cent, \r\nand nothing guarantees that the growth rate will not \r\ndecline further. \r\n This decline in the growth rate has aggravated the \r\ndanger of serious budgetary difficulties. We must \r\nmaintain our rate of progress despite being subjected to \r\nthe gruelling external shocks of the successive crises of \r\nthe world economy in full recession. We are making \r\nconsiderable efforts to mobilize our internal resources. \r\nWe welcome the good work done by the United \r\nNations to mobilize additional resources from \r\ndevelopment partners in order to help pilot countries, \r\nincluding Benin, to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. These decisions were taken in the \r\ncontext of implementing the commitments made by the \r\nGroup of Eight at Gleneagles, the Millennium \r\nDeclaration, the 2001 Brussels Declaration on least \r\ndeveloped countries, and all of the statements that we \r\nwarmly welcomed and applauded at the recent Summit \r\non Climate Change convened here by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. \r\n The consequences of climate change considerably \r\ncomplicate the deal. Benin is among the most \r\nvulnerable countries and those least equipped to \r\naddress climate change. In addition to torrential rains \r\nthat are concentrated in just a few weeks of the year, \r\ncoastal erosion due mainly to the rise in sea level has \r\nalready been observed in Benin and neighbouring \r\ncountries. We also have long and recurrent droughts \r\nand other natural disasters that are affecting our \r\npeoples. Scientists predict that, among other events, the \r\ncoastal areas of West Africa will be submerged due to \r\nthe rise in sea level of the Atlantic Ocean, whereas \r\nnorthern countries have already gained land along their \r\ncoastlines. \r\n We therefore need help to acquire the \r\ntechnologies and means necessary to combat coastal \r\nerosion because we cannot sit idly by while this \r\ndisaster unfolds. In order to counter the coastal erosion \r\nalready engulfing our cities and coastal lands, major \r\nwork on infrastructure is crucial. Actions to be taken \r\nwill be effective only if undertaken at the level of the \r\nentire subregion so as to ensure that all of the West \r\nAfrican coastline is protected. To that end, we must \r\nmobilize vast resources. Perhaps we should consider \r\nestablishing a multilateral investment fund, under the \r\nauspices of the United Nations and the African Union, \r\nto finance the major construction work that will be \r\nneeded. \r\n We need a United Nations able to coordinate the \r\nresponse to these major development challenges, raise \r\nthe necessary resources to respond to the financial \r\nneeds, and supervise the transfer of resources to be \r\nused by the international community to help the most \r\nvulnerable countries, including the least developed. We \r\nneed a United Nations with the moral authority to \r\ninvolve the affluent countries in thorough reform of the \r\narchitecture of governance and of economic and \r\nfinancial globalization in order to improve the capacity \r\n A/64/PV.8\r\n \r\n57 09-52470 \r\n \r\nof the international financial system to promote \r\nequitable development in all regions of the world. \r\n The initiatives of the Group of Twenty in this \r\narea are laudable and must continue to ensure a \r\nthorough reform of the international economic system \r\nthat will allow all countries to be integrated into the \r\nvirtuous cycle of economic growth and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. We need a United Nations able to help \r\nemerging countries fully to shoulder the international \r\ncommitments linked to their new status and to exploit \r\ntheir strengths to promote South-South and triangular \r\ncooperation in order to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and to better adapt to climate \r\nchange. Convinced that another name for peace is \r\ndevelopment and that peace and development are \r\nessential to our survival on Earth, we must find the \r\nessential means to promote peace through and for \r\ndevelopment. \r\n We need a United Nations able to assure the \r\neffective prevention of armed conflict, if necessary by \r\nfielding robust peace or development missions to \r\nconduct operations for economic stabilization and the \r\nelimination of extreme poverty. We need a United \r\nNations that makes full use of the opportunities for \r\ncooperation with regional organizations. In that \r\nconnection, Benin calls for consistent implementation \r\nof the proposals made in the Prodi report (S/2008/813, \r\nannex) on cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe African Union on modalities for support to African \r\nUnion peacekeeping operations. \r\n We need a United Nations with strengthened \r\ncapacities to contribute to the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes, inter alia, through mediation and the \r\npromotion of judicial settlements. We need a United \r\nNations capable of rising to the challenges involved in \r\nsettling the Palestinian question definitively; \r\npromoting disarmament and the regulation of the \r\nnon-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; \r\npromoting the rule of law at the national and \r\ninternational levels; promoting fair trade; countering \r\nterrorism and organized transnational crime; exercising \r\nthe responsibility to protect; fighting impunity by \r\nstrengthening international justice; and protecting \r\ncivilians, in particular children, women and the elderly \r\nin situations of armed conflict; and so on. \r\n United Nations reform must be undertaken \r\nwithout hesitation in order to strengthen its \r\neffectiveness, legitimacy and credibility. Security \r\nCouncil reform through expansion in both categories of \r\nmembership is, among other things, an unavoidable \r\nnecessity of our times, as the Chairman of the African \r\nUnion affirmed from this rostrum a few days ago. \r\n The time has come to grant all peoples of the \r\nEarth their due place in the concert of free and \r\nprosperous nations. Benin is ready to cooperate \r\nwithout reservation in finding the most appropriate \r\nways to redress the injustices of the past and to \r\nestablish a new world order in the Security Council. \r\nSuch an order must enable humankind to forge its \r\ncommon destiny in our common house, namely, the \r\nEarth. We have a sacred duty towards our planet, which \r\nincludes behaving in a manner that serves to preserve \r\nits habitability for current and future generations. Yes, \r\nwe need a United Nations that is more just and better \r\nable to respond to today’s urgent needs as well as to the \r\naspirations of the world’s most vulnerable people. \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Alberto Gatmaitan Romulo, Secretary \r\nof Foreign Affairs of the Philippines.  \r\n Mr. Romulo (Philippines) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nAllow me to warmly congratulate Mr. Ali Abdussalam \r\nTreki on his well-deserved election to preside over the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. I assure \r\nhim of the full cooperation of the Philippines as he \r\ndischarges the duties of his high office. \r\n We are gathered here today, in this parliament of \r\nnations, to find meaningful solutions to the conflicts \r\nand crises facing our world today. Although there are \r\nsigns of global recovery, now is neither the time for \r\ncomplacency nor for a return to business as usual. Our \r\ndrive to enhance global development has clearly \r\nslowed, while the challenges to peace remain starkly \r\nbefore us. \r\n Through globalization, we have witnessed \r\nunprecedented material progress and record poverty \r\nalleviation. Yet the poorest 40 per cent of the world’s \r\npopulation still live on less than $2 per day. Nor have \r\nwe resolved the climate change and food crises that \r\noppress hundreds of millions of human beings. \r\n A large part of global development has been the \r\nresult of labour, including that of migrant workers. \r\nHowever, despite their contributions to the global \r\neconomy, many migrants remain exposed to \r\nexploitation and abuse. Moreover, the peace dividend \r\nexpected from the end of the cold war never \r\nA/64/PV.8  \r\n \r\n09-52470 58 \r\n \r\nmaterialized, while we continue to confront nuclear \r\nproliferation and violent conflict. The shortage of aid \r\nresources and instability in trade and investment are \r\ngenerating a global development emergency. Many \r\nnations will not attain the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). Development gains are being tragically \r\nlost. \r\n Our march of progress must not stall — not on \r\nour watch and not while we have the will, the vision \r\nand the means to build a better world inspired by a \r\nshared commitment to justice, fairness, \r\nnon-discrimination, progress and peace. We should do \r\nso by focusing on the five great challenges of our time.  \r\n The first challenge pertains to promoting nuclear \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation. The second \r\ninvolves managing the global crisis to encourage \r\nequitable recovery, fairer globalization and faster \r\npoverty alleviation. The third entails protecting and \r\npromoting the rights of migrants, who continue to \r\ncontribute to global development and the well-being of \r\nour societies. The fourth has to do with the taking of \r\nurgent measures to effectively address the adverse \r\neffects of climate change without further delay. And \r\nthe fifth has to do with reducing the number of \r\nconflicts and expanding mutual understanding and \r\nrespect through greater interfaith and \r\ninter-civilizational dialogue. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n Nuclear weapons and their technology are a \r\nthreat to international peace and security, and the \r\nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) is our central \r\nmechanism to contain, and eventually eliminate, that \r\nthreat. The May 2010 NPT Review Conference, over \r\nwhich the Philippines will preside, will be the next \r\nopportunity for all of us to act on that matter in a \r\nconcerted manner. We can be encouraged by certain \r\nrecent developments on that front.  \r\n A constructive atmosphere prevailed during the \r\nmeetings of the Preparatory Committee for the Review \r\nConference. President Obama has announced that he \r\nwill lead the United States to ratify the Comprehensive \r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which is another key \r\npillar of the global disarmament and NPT system. In \r\naddition, the United States and Russia are making \r\nheadway, under the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, \r\nto reduce their deployed nuclear warheads and delivery \r\nsystems beyond the Treaty’s upcoming expiry in \r\nDecember. In addition, the South-East Asia Nuclear-\r\nWeapon-Free-Zone and other regional nuclear-weapon- \r\nfree zones are continuing to reinforce the NPT system. \r\nThose positive developments inspire the Philippines in \r\nsteering the Review Conference to conduct \r\nnegotiations and consultations in an open and \r\ntransparent manner. In that spirit, we reiterate our call \r\nfor the few remaining countries that have not yet done \r\nso to accede both to the CTBT and the NPT, in order to \r\ngive greater hope for lasting peace and security for our \r\nworld. \r\n The global financial and economic crisis is \r\nplacing intolerable strain on the poorest of the poor and \r\nundermining years of efforts to attain internationally \r\nagreed development goals, including the MDGs, and to \r\ncombat ill-health and hunger. The crisis has been \r\naccompanied by increases in unemployment, with \r\nconcomitant declining incomes and demand. The \r\nInternational Labour Organization estimates that \r\nunemployment could rise by 50 million by the end of \r\n2009, thereby bringing the global unemployment rate \r\nto more than 7 per cent. \r\n The Philippines and many other nations are \r\nimplementing stimulus packages, accelerated \r\nemployment-generation programmes and enhanced \r\nsocial safety nets. In the Philippines we have \r\nstrengthened our banking sector and fiscal position \r\nthrough tough reforms that have blunted the full force \r\nof the global crisis. The Philippines is one of the few \r\neconomies that continues to have positive growth in its \r\ngross domestic product. However, we cannot ignore the \r\nimpact of the global crisis elsewhere in our \r\ninterdependent world. The Philippines therefore joins \r\nother nations in the General Assembly in calling for a \r\nunited effort in the United Nations to act for the \r\ncommon good of all our peoples. \r\n The United Nations Conference on the World \r\nFinancial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on \r\nDevelopment, which was held in this very Hall last \r\nJune, presented Member States with lines of action that \r\nwe must take now to stimulate the global economy, \r\nimprove regulation and monitoring and reform \r\nprocesses and institutions to prevent any recurrence of \r\nthe crisis. \r\n We view the Global Jobs Pact put forward by the \r\nInternational Labour Organization, which was endorsed \r\nby the Economic and Social Council this past July, as \r\nanother important step towards recovering from the \r\ncrisis. We reiterate our call on all countries to resist \r\n A/64/PV.8\r\n \r\n59 09-52470 \r\n \r\nprotectionism in order to expand trade and investment \r\nflows. We also call on developed nations to maintain \r\ntheir commitments with regard to official development \r\nassistance. Furthermore, the voice of the developing \r\nworld must now be fully heard in reforming \r\ninternational financial and development institutions so \r\nthat we can forge a more equitable and stable global \r\neconomic system to avoid future crises. \r\n Global migrants are among the groups most \r\nadversely affected by the crisis. The international \r\ncommunity therefore has a shared responsibility to \r\nensure their protection, taking into full account the \r\nspecial vulnerabilities of the gender and family \r\ndimensions of the issue. The second Global Forum on \r\nMigration and Development, which the Philippines was \r\nprivileged to chair in Manila, reinforced that important \r\nmessage by focusing on the human face of migration \r\nand on the human rights and empowerment of \r\nmigrants. We urge all nations to accede to the \r\nInternational Convention on the Protection of the \r\nRights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their \r\nFamilies, and to avoid unfair restrictions on, and unfair \r\ntreatment of, migrants. \r\n We must carry the momentum of the Summit on \r\nClimate Change, held here in New York, forward into \r\nthe negotiations under the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change on the road to \r\nCopenhagen this December. The world expects nothing \r\nless from us. The Philippines therefore calls on the \r\ndeveloped countries concerned to present their firm \r\npost-Kyoto greenhouse gas emission targets, taking \r\ninto account the ideal levels suggested by the scientific \r\ncommunity. They must also assist developing countries \r\nto mitigate and adapt to worsening climate change by \r\nfulfilling their Framework Convention obligations to \r\nprovide technological and financial support. As a \r\ncoordinator of the G-77 in the talks, the Philippines \r\nwill continue to work with all parties to help to ensure \r\na positive outcome in Copenhagen. \r\n The Philippines is doing its part to advance that \r\nvital global agenda. We recently enacted a landmark \r\nlaw to promote the development and use of renewable \r\nenergy resources, especially biofuels. Earlier this \r\nmonth, the Philippines also hosted the International \r\nConference on Green Industry in Asia. The Manila \r\nDeclaration on Green Industry in Asia and the \r\nFramework of Action adopted at the Conference \r\npromote the integration of sustainable development \r\ninto industrial development processes for the transition \r\nto resource-efficient and low-carbon industries. We \r\nhope that elements of the Manila Declaration will \r\nprovide input for Copenhagen as well. \r\n The international community must also focus on \r\nthe urgent need to reduce tension and conflict fuelled \r\nby perceived differences between religions, faiths and \r\ncivilizations. If left unattended, such conflict can \r\nfester, causing greater tension and untold human \r\nsuffering and violence, which extremists can exploit. \r\nThe urgency of the matter has prompted the Philippines \r\nand many partner nations and organizations to promote \r\ngreater interfaith dialogue, both within the United \r\nNations system as well as at regional and national \r\nlevels. By building bridges of understanding, that \r\nglobal advocacy enhances peace and development. \r\n Every year, the Philippines has submitted to the \r\nUnited Nations a draft resolution calling for \r\ninterreligious and intercultural dialogue, understanding \r\nand cooperation for peace. The General Assembly has \r\nalways adopted it unanimously. Also at the United \r\nNations, we initiated the holding of the Ministerial \r\nMeeting on Interfaith Dialogue and Cooperation for \r\nPeace, which includes countries from every region of \r\nthe world. In 2006, we also launched the global \r\nTripartite Forum on Interfaith Cooperation for Peace, \r\nwhich is headquartered in New York and made up of 54 \r\nGovernments, 15 United Nations agencies and 110 \r\nreligious non-governmental organizations represented \r\nat the United Nations. To reinforce that effort, the \r\nPhilippines will host the first special Non-Aligned \r\nMovement (NAM) ministerial meeting on interfaith \r\ndialogue and cooperation for peace and development in \r\nManila this December. We are pleased to invite all \r\nUnited Nations Members and other interested nations \r\nto that important seminal meeting. \r\n(spoke in Spanish) \r\n The spirit of multilateralism and prudent realism \r\nalso requires that we support United Nations \r\npeacekeeping efforts. In crises and emergencies around \r\nthe world, we must do more collectively to alleviate \r\nsuffering and to help nations and communities to \r\nachieve self-sustaining peace. The Philippines will \r\ncontinue to be active in United Nations peacekeeping. \r\nIndeed, the Philippines has become one of the largest \r\ncontributors of individual police officers to United \r\nNations peacekeeping operations. More than 600 of our \r\npeacekeepers are serving with distinction around the \r\nworld. Next month, we will send a battalion in support \r\nA/64/PV.8  \r\n \r\n09-52470 60 \r\n \r\nof the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, \r\nin the Golan Heights. \r\n We stand on the cusp of history. It is in our hands, \r\nhere at the United Nations, to shape the changes and \r\ntrends necessary to bequeath to succeeding generations \r\na lasting legacy of a world of greater justice, \r\ncompassion and well-being. The Philippines is deeply \r\nhonoured to assist and cooperate with all nations in the \r\ntask of building a future where peace and prosperity \r\nreign unceasingly for the benefit of all humankind. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Elmar Maharram oglu \r\nMammadyarov, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nRepublic of Azerbaijan. \r\n Mr. Mammadyarov (Azerbaijan): I would like to \r\njoin previous speakers in congratulating His \r\nExcellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki of Libya on his \r\nelection to the post of President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-fourth session. I wish him every \r\nsuccess. I should also like to thank his predecessor, \r\nMr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann, for his work. I would \r\nlike to express my profound respect and appreciation to \r\nthe Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon, for his leadership in mobilizing the \r\ninternational community to make our world a better \r\nplace to live. \r\n We all recognize that the security of every State \r\nof the world can be better promoted and ensured with a \r\nmultilateral security system. That paradigm was a \r\nprincipal reason behind the creation of the collective \r\nsecurity system that has the United Nations at its core. \r\nYet, after more than 60 years since the founding of the \r\nUnited Nations, the question remains of whether the \r\ncontemporary international security architecture is \r\naddressing effectively and in a timely manner the \r\nmultifaceted and interconnected challenges and threats \r\nconfronting our world today.  \r\n The global character of today’s challenges and \r\nthreats makes geographic distance irrelevant when it \r\ncomes to the formulation of security policy, as threats \r\nas we know them today transcend national borders and \r\nentire continents. The indirect repercussions of these \r\nthreats may be as devastating and as costly as their \r\ndirect impact. The interconnected and intertwined \r\nnature of current threats requires that we reconsider the \r\nvery concept of security in broader terms that are not \r\nconfined to the traditional military aspect of security, \r\nbut also include its political, economic, energy, \r\ncultural, information and other dimensions. \r\n The security of each State and, more broadly, \r\ninternational peace and security will depend upon \r\nwhether States follow the norms and principles of \r\ninternational law and use them as a guiding tool for \r\nshaping their foreign and security policies. Following a \r\ncommon set of norms and rules on the international \r\narena contributes to the transparency and predictability \r\nof State behaviour and hence consolidates international \r\npeace and security. \r\n Unfortunately, the unlawful use of force has still \r\nnot been eliminated from international relations. \r\nCivilian populations are still suffering today in many \r\nplaces around the world due to the manifest failure of \r\nindividual States to fulfil their most basic and \r\ncompelling responsibilities. Armed conflict, military \r\naggression and foreign occupation involving the most \r\nserious international crimes are but a few vivid \r\nexamples from our recent history of the bitter \r\nconsequences of non-compliance by individual States \r\nwith the norms and principles of international law. \r\nGovernments that fail to obey the rules of international \r\nconduct will inevitably infringe upon individual \r\nliberties and freedoms at home, thus undermining \r\ndemocratic development. \r\n The most vivid example of misconduct when it \r\ncomes to the norms and principles of international law \r\nis the almost two-decades-long, and still unresolved, \r\nArmenia-Azerbaijan Nagorny-Karabakh conflict, \r\nwhich also stands out as a major threat to international \r\nand regional peace and security. As a result of the \r\naggression carried out by Armenia, almost one-fifth of \r\nthe territory of Azerbaijan has been occupied, \r\napproximately 1 million ethnically cleansed \r\nAzerbaijanis have become internally displaced persons \r\nor refugees and thousands of Azerbaijan’s historical \r\nand cultural heritage artifacts have been destroyed or \r\nlooted.  \r\n In its four resolutions on the conflict, the Security \r\nCouncil has reaffirmed the sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegrity of Azerbaijan and the inadmissibility of the \r\nuse of force to acquire the territory of the other States. \r\nIt has also recognized Nagorny-Karabakh as a part of \r\nAzerbaijan and called for an immediate, complete and \r\nunconditional withdrawal of the occupying forces from \r\nall occupied territories of Azerbaijan. The General \r\nAssembly — in resolution 62/243, which was adopted \r\n A/64/PV.8\r\n \r\n61 09-52470 \r\n \r\non 14 March 2008 and which is entitled “The situation \r\nin the occupied territories of Azerbaijan” — expressed \r\nrespect and support for the sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegrity of Azerbaijan within its internationally \r\nrecognized borders. \r\n As reflected in those resolutions, the approach of \r\nthe General Assembly and the Security Council is fully \r\nconsistent with the position of Azerbaijan, which from \r\nthe beginning advocated a step-by-step approach to \r\nsettling the conflict as the only viable option. A number \r\nof important steps have to be taken, starting with the \r\nwithdrawal of Armenian forces from all the occupied \r\nterritories, the rehabilitation of those territories, the \r\nreturn of internally displaced persons to their homes in \r\nand around the Nagorny-Karabakh region and the \r\nopening of all communications channels for mutual \r\nuse. That will make it possible to eliminate the \r\nconsequences of the conflict, and will pave the way for \r\nthe establishment of a durable peace and stability in the \r\nregion that is conducive to the establishment of the \r\nlegal status of the Nagorny-Karabakh region within \r\nAzerbaijan, with due account taken of, and an equal \r\nhearing for, the voices of the Azerbaijani and Armenian \r\ncommunities of the region. \r\n The current settlement process offers some hope \r\nof breaking the stalemate in the process of resolution \r\nof the conflict. The acceptance by Armenia of the step-\r\nby-step approach to a settlement to the conflict on the \r\nbasis of the principles and norms of international law \r\nand the decisions and documents adopted in that \r\nframework, as reflected in the joint declaration signed \r\nin Moscow in November 2008 by the Presidents of \r\nAzerbaijan, Armenia and the Russian Federation, is a \r\npositive sign. Azerbaijan is ready to continue talks with \r\nArmenia’s leadership for a secure and stable South \r\nCaucasus region and beyond, which will make it \r\npossible to take advantage of the existing ample \r\nregional opportunities for the benefit of all. \r\n Against the background of the negative \r\ndevelopments in the region to which I have referred, let \r\nme briefly share some information about the positive \r\neconomic performance of my country.  \r\n Azerbaijan has minimized the impact of the \r\nglobal economic downturn on its economy and \r\nmanaged to sustain growth. Having maintained its \r\ndynamism in 2009, as of today our gross domestic \r\nproduct (GDP) growth stands at almost 4 per cent. We \r\nhave recorded a drop in the poverty rate since 2003, \r\nfrom 44 per cent to 13 per cent. The Government of \r\nAzerbaijan has substantially improved trade and \r\ninvestment conditions in an effort to strengthen \r\nnational competitiveness and spur private-sector \r\ndevelopment, especially in the non-oil sector. Non-oil \r\nGDP growth is at almost 16 per cent, the highest rate in \r\n5 years. In recognition of its results-oriented reforms \r\nand thought-out economic policy, Azerbaijan was \r\nqualified by the World Bank as one of the world’s top \r\nreformers. \r\n Azerbaijan — a strategically located country with \r\na young and skilled population, great resources and a \r\ndynamic economy — is inevitably taking a leading role \r\nin the region and increasingly becoming a pivotal \r\nplayer and credible actor beyond the region. The \r\nsuccessful implementation of such infrastructure \r\nprojects as the Baku-Supsa and Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan \r\noil-exporting pipelines and the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum \r\ngas pipeline have not only boosted our economy, they \r\nhave also contributed to the development of \r\nneighbouring States. A modern energy infrastructure \r\ncoupled with vast energy resources have transformed \r\nAzerbaijan into an energy hub of international \r\nimportance. Azerbaijan has proven itself a reliable \r\npartner and an indispensable and secure energy source \r\nfor Europe and beyond. \r\n Azerbaijan’s location at the crossroads of major \r\nEast-West and North-South transport corridors and its \r\nrapidly developing national transportation \r\ninfrastructure, which is connected to regional highway \r\nand railroad networks, highlights the strategic \r\nimportance of my country. The completion of the \r\nconstruction of the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railroad and the \r\ncommissioning of the brand new seaport at Alat, on \r\nAzerbaijan’s coast on the Caspian Sea, will increase \r\nthe role of Azerbaijan as a communications hub linking \r\nEurope with Asia. \r\n Azerbaijan has also put forward an initiative to \r\nestablish a Trans-Eurasian information superhighway, \r\nwhich is expected to serve as a major element of the \r\nEast-West transport corridor and facilitate the \r\nprovision of Internet service, telecommunications \r\nsystems, e-information resources and e-economies to \r\n20 countries of the region. \r\n Today we are living at a time of heightened \r\nreligious and ethnic awareness, which in certain \r\ninstances has taken exaggerated forms and is \r\nsometimes maliciously exploited to fuel conflicts on \r\nA/64/PV.8  \r\n \r\n09-52470 62 \r\n \r\nethnic, religious or cultural grounds. The broad \r\nrecognition by the Member States of the United \r\nNations of the role of the dialogue among civilizations, \r\nand specifically of inter-cultural and inter-religious \r\nharmony in maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity, can only be praised. \r\n We fully support the recommendations of the \r\nSecretary-General on the importance of increasing \r\neducational efforts to eliminate hate messages, \r\ndistortion, prejudice and negative bias from textbooks \r\nand other educational media and to ensure a basic \r\nknowledge and understanding of the world’s main \r\ncultures, civilizations and religions. \r\n As a country where long-standing traditions of \r\ntolerance and peaceful coexistence of different \r\nreligions and ethnic groups over centuries have become \r\nan inseparable part of the culture, Azerbaijan has \r\nrepeatedly demonstrated its determination to act as a \r\nnatural bridge bringing together different continents, \r\ncultures and civilizations through the promotion of \r\ninter-religious and intercultural dialogue based on \r\nmutual respect and understanding among peoples of \r\ndifferent cultures and religions. \r\n Azerbaijan was among the first countries to join \r\nthe Alliance of Civilizations, an initiative by Turkey \r\nand Spain. Azerbaijan has hosted a number of \r\nimportant events in recent years, with a view to \r\ntranslating into concrete actions the recommendations \r\ncontained in the Alliance of Civilizations report of the \r\nHigh-level Group appointed by the Secretary-General. \r\nMost recently, we held the Baku International Forum \r\non Expanding the Role of Women in Cross-cultural \r\nDialogue, which we believe will raise awareness about \r\nthe role of women in that regard. In December 2008, \r\nwe hosted a conference of culture ministers from \r\nCouncil of Europe member States. For the first time in \r\nthe history of the Council of Europe, ministers from \r\nmember States of the Islamic Educational, Scientific \r\nand Cultural Organization and the Arab League \r\nEducational, Cultural and Scientific Organization \r\njoined the event. The Baku declaration adopted at the \r\nconference envisages, inter alia, an intercultural \r\ndialogue between European and neighbouring States. \r\n At the fifth Islamic Conference of Culture \r\nMinisters, Azerbaijan’s capital of Baku was declared \r\nthe Islamic culture capital for 2009. This autumn we \r\nwill be hosting the sixth Conference of Ministers of \r\nCulture of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, \r\nwhere we will continue discussions of our future \r\nactions in fostering dialogue among civilizations. \r\n The multilateral system, with the United Nations \r\nat its heart, is undergoing serious changes that will test \r\nits strength, viability and credibility. This requires \r\nmore dedicated efforts aimed at strengthening the \r\nUnited Nations and promoting the effectiveness of the \r\nOrganization through the implementation of its \r\ndecisions and resolutions. Azerbaijan believes that, as \r\nthe only truly global organization, the United Nations \r\nhas to be stronger and capable of engaging on a range \r\nof pressing global issues in every part of the world, as \r\nwell as addressing the aspirations and concerns of each \r\nMember State. We continue to support reform of the \r\nOrganization so that it may be renewed and revitalized \r\nand made more responsive. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Paul Toungui, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs, Cooperation, la Francophonie and Regional \r\nIntegration of Gabon.  \r\n Mr. Toungui (Gabon) (spoke in French): First, I \r\nwould like to warmly congratulate Mr. Ali Abdussalam \r\nTreki on his election to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-fourth session. I would also like \r\nto pay a well-deserved tribute to Father Miguel \r\nd’Escoto Brockmann, President of the Assembly at its \r\nsixty-third session, for the work he accomplished \r\nduring his mandate. And I reaffirm the confidence and \r\nsupport of my country for the Secretary-General as he \r\ncontinues his efforts as the leader of this Organization. \r\n Gabon has just gone through a critical phase in its \r\nhistory as a nation. With the loss of President Omar \r\nBongo Ondimba on 8 June, our country saw the start of \r\na delicate period of political transition, during which \r\nwe had to dig deep to find the strength necessary to \r\nconfront our destiny. Under the relevant provisions of \r\nour founding laws and the leadership of interim \r\nPresident Rose Francine Rogombé, we were able to \r\nbring our electoral process to a successful conclusion, \r\nculminating in a vote on 30 August. As a result of this \r\nunprecedented election, Mr. Ali Bongo Ondimba was \r\nofficially proclaimed the elected President of the \r\nRepublic by the Constitutional Court, which under the \r\nlaw has a month to examine claims or appeals resulting \r\nfrom the election before the elected President takes \r\noffice, given that nine unsuccessful candidates have \r\nappealed to the high court. \r\n A/64/PV.8\r\n \r\n63 09-52470 \r\n \r\n As members know, ensuring such an important \r\ndemocratic transition in the brief time allocated under \r\nthe law was very challenging for our country, and I am \r\nproud to say that we have met it, considering what was \r\nat stake and what we knew had to be done. I submit \r\nhere my own tribute to the people of Gabon, the \r\nmajority of whom have proclaimed their support for \r\nthe values of peace and democracy. I would also like to \r\nthank the peoples of Africa and of the entire world, as \r\nwell as the representatives of States and international \r\nand civil society organizations who came to observe \r\nthe elections in Gabon and to nourish our democratic \r\nprocess with their experience. As we open a new page \r\nin our march towards progress and development, we \r\nknow we can rely on the international community and \r\non the friends of Gabon all over the world to confront \r\nthe challenges of today and tomorrow. \r\n As regards those challenges, we are determined, \r\ntoday more than ever before, to spare no effort to \r\nestablish good political and economic governance and \r\nto consolidate our gains and our legacy in the areas of \r\nstability, peace and democracy. We are also motivated \r\nby our determination to pursue our endeavours in \r\nmaintaining regional and international peace, by \r\nstrengthening our links of solidarity and fraternity with \r\nall our neighbouring countries. \r\n The sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly \r\nis opening its deliberations in an international context \r\nmarked by a number of successive crises: economic \r\nand financial, food, energy and environmental. We \r\nmust bring urgent and lasting responses to these \r\nvarious crises by acting collectively to curb them and \r\nensuring that our peoples achieve the development they \r\ndesire with all their heart. The United Nations \r\nConference on the World Financial and Economic \r\nCrisis and Its Impact on Development, held in New \r\nYork from 24 to 30 June, was an important initiative, \r\nenabling us to express our concerns and declare our \r\ncommitment to fighting the crisis and its repercussions \r\nfor our countries. \r\n The unity we reached on measures to be taken to \r\ndeal with the crisis will require the complete and \r\nunified participation of our countries in developing \r\nappropriate solutions. Beyond the specifics relating to \r\neach country, we must make sure together that the \r\nmeasures and actions taken to fight the crisis be \r\nproportional in scope to its gravity and intensity. \r\n The food crisis was at the centre of our \r\ndiscussions during the sixty-third session of the \r\nAssembly and was the focus of two important \r\ndeclarations, one adopted at the High-level Conference \r\non World Food Security, held in Rome from 3 to 5 June \r\n2008, and one adopted at the thirteenth African Union \r\nConference of Heads of State and Government, held in \r\nSirte in July. We must now implement the declarations \r\nand measures adopted as a result of meetings held at \r\nthe international and regional levels. It is only through \r\nstrict adherence to our commitments that we will be \r\nable to identify the adverse effects of such crisis \r\nsituations on the development of our respective States. \r\n The challenge of feeding a planet whose \r\npopulation is growing is intimately linked to the \r\nquestions of the environment and climate change. The \r\nharmful effects of global warming on our ability to \r\nincrease agricultural production in such a way as to \r\nbring about a lasting solution to the food crisis are no \r\nlonger in doubt. I am pleased once again that this \r\nquestion was chosen as a theme for the recent high-\r\nlevel dialogue organized by the Secretary-General on \r\nthe sidelines of the current session, with a view to the \r\nforthcoming Copenhagen Climate Conference in \r\nDecember. In this regard, we reaffirm our support for \r\nAfrica’s common position on climate change, adopted \r\nin Addis Ababa in August by the heads of State or \r\nGovernment of the African Union. \r\n My country, Gabon, whose forests are among \r\nthose that make up the great Congo basin, has adhered \r\nunreservedly to the various international conventions \r\nconcerning the struggle against climate catastrophe and \r\nthe protection of biodiversity. We have resolved to \r\nassume our share of responsibility by dedicating 11 per \r\ncent of our territory to humanity, by creating, among \r\nother things, 13 national parks. \r\n The interdependence of the crises the \r\ninternational community faces highlights, now more \r\nthan ever before, the need to breathe new life into \r\nefforts to ensure international peace and security, but \r\nalso to conduct collective action at the global level. It \r\nis with this conviction that Gabon has submitted its \r\ncandidacy for a non-permanent seat in the Security \r\nCouncil for the period 2010-2011, for which it was \r\nendorsed by the African Union at its thirteenth \r\nConference of Heads of State and Government, held at \r\nSirte in July. \r\nA/64/PV.8  \r\n \r\n09-52470 64 \r\n \r\n My country is also convinced that this \r\nOrganization cannot remain frozen, but must evolve in \r\norder to enable it to adapt better to the current \r\ninternational context. It is for this reason that world \r\nleaders, through the Millennium Declaration \r\n(resolution 55/2) and the 2005 World Summit Outcome \r\n(resolution 60/1), reaffirmed the need to strengthen the \r\nUnited Nations to allow it to fulfil its principal \r\nmissions more effectively.  \r\n In that regard, my country welcomes the progress \r\nmade since the 2005 World Summit in implementing a \r\ngreat many of the important recommendations of the \r\nOutcome Document in the framework of the United \r\nNations reform process. While pleased with these \r\nmajor advances, we must continue our efforts to bring \r\nthese reforms to completion. Building a more just and \r\nsecure world capable of responding to its peoples’ \r\nprofound aspirations depends on it. \r\nThe meeting rose at 10.30 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n"
