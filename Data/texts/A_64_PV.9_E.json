(Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) \r\n \r\n \r\nThe meeting was called to order at 9.10 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Gabriel Ntisezerana, Second \r\nVice-President of the Republic of Burundi \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the Second Vice-President \r\nof the Republic of Burundi. \r\n Mr. Gabriel Ntisezerana, Second Vice-President \r\nof the Republic of Burundi, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I have great \r\npleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Gabriel \r\nNtisezerana, Second Vice-President of the Republic of \r\nBurundi, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Mr. Ntisezerana (Burundi) (spoke in French): It \r\nis an honour to take the floor at the sixty-fourth session \r\nof the General Assembly.  \r\n At the outset, on behalf of His Excellency \r\nMr. Pierre Nkurunziza, President of the Republic of \r\nBurundi, and our entire delegation, we join preceding \r\nspeakers in warmly congratulating you, Mr. Ali \r\nAbdussalam Treki, on your election to the presidency \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. \r\nYour election is a tribute to you and to your country. \r\nMy delegation and I personally wish you every success \r\nin your noble mission. Our congratulations go also to \r\nthe other members of the Bureau. We also take this \r\nopportunity to pay a well-deserved tribute to your \r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Miguel d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann, for his commitment and for the quality of \r\nthe work accomplished during his mandate.  \r\n Here, we wish to reaffirm our support for His \r\nExcellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Once \r\nagain, we wish him every success and assure him of \r\nthe full cooperation of the Republic of Burundi in \r\nseeking peaceful and courageous solutions to the \r\nproblems facing today’s world. We hail him in \r\nparticular for his devotion to the cause of peace and \r\ndevelopment, which he has continued to demonstrate \r\nfor the world in general and for Burundi in particular.  \r\n Finally, our gratitude goes to the international \r\ncommunity, the Peacebuilding Commission, the United \r\nNations Integrated Office in Burundi, the European \r\nUnion, the Regional Initiative for Burundi and the \r\nRepublic of South Africa for their efforts to restore \r\npeace, which is now a reality and which we hope will \r\nbe irreversible in Burundi. We urge all States in the \r\nGreat Lakes region to continue to engage in dialogue \r\nand cooperation to ensure comprehensive political \r\nstability and development in the region. We take this \r\nopportunity to request that consultative status in the \r\nGeneral Assembly be granted at this session to the \r\nInternational Conference on the Great Lakes Region. \r\n The present session of the General Assembly is \r\ntaking place at a time when the Burundian people are \r\nwelcoming the progress made on the path of peace. \r\nIndeed, the war in Burundi is now over. The last rebel \r\nA/64/PV.9  \r\n \r\n09-52586 2 \r\n \r\nmovement, the Forces nationales de liberation, has laid \r\ndown its weapons and has become a political party that \r\nis actively participating in the country’s democratic \r\nlife. The movement’s top leaders have been appointed \r\nto posts in the area of public administration. Some \r\nformer combatants have joined the army or the police, \r\nand the others have been demobilized and are \r\nbenefiting from the process of reintegrating into \r\nnormal socio-economic life. We wish to thank all our \r\npartners for their support for Burundi’s considerable \r\npeacebuilding and democratization efforts.  \r\n With the return of peace and democratically \r\nelected institutions, the Burundian people are \r\nbeginning to regain confidence in the institutions of the \r\nRepublic. Internally displaced persons (IDPs) are \r\nreturning to their former villages, and Burundian \r\nrefugees who were in neighbouring countries have \r\nreturned. However, the reintegration of former \r\ncombatants, IDPs and refugees is not taking place \r\nwithout difficulties or constraints.  \r\n Indeed, Burundi, as an African country with one \r\nof the highest population growth rates, has an acute \r\nland-shortage problem, which has given rise to \r\nproperty disputes. In order to preserve social harmony, \r\na commission for land and other assets has been \r\nestablished to resolve all disputes arising between \r\nrepatriated persons and their fellow citizens who have \r\nremained in the hills, where land is considered a \r\nunique treasure. \r\n Burundi is facing the problem of financing the \r\nprofessional reintegration of thousands of men, women \r\nand even children who have served as combatants. The \r\ninternational community’s support is thus essential to \r\nassist us in the process of socially reintegrating those \r\nsectors of the needy population so that the gains of \r\npeacebuilding will not be undermined.  \r\n Furthermore, the Burundian Government \r\nrecognizes that illegal firearms in the hands of the \r\ncivilian population constitute a serious threat to peace. \r\nIn order to address that problem, the Government has \r\nestablished a commission to encourage people to \r\nvoluntarily turn in their weapons. As the commission \r\nhas a time-bound mandate, the Government has \r\nlaunched a large-scale programme to recover all \r\nweapons and clamp down on crime linked to firearm \r\nuse. A decree regulating legal firearms possession has \r\njust been signed by the President.  \r\n Judicial reform is being carried out to ensure \r\nequitable justice and combat impunity. The \r\nGovernment welcomes the support of the international \r\ncommunity in this area. To further consolidate the \r\npeace dividend, we must meet the challenges of \r\nknowing the truth so that we can achieve national \r\nreconciliation. It is imperative that the Burundian \r\npeople succeed in the transitional justice process. That \r\nwill enable them to bury the hatchet of war and build \r\ntheir future on a solid foundation of peace and mutual \r\ntrust. \r\n Mindful of the fact that it would not enjoy peace \r\nfor long in a troubled Africa, our country has \r\nresponded positively to the international community’s \r\nappeal to contribute to peacekeeping in countries at \r\nwar. Thus, Burundi is participating in the United \r\nNations Operation in Côte d’Ivoire, to restore peace to \r\nCôte d’Ivoire; the United Nations Peacebuilding \r\nSupport Office in the Central African Republic, in \r\nChad and the Central African Republic; and the African \r\nUnion-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur, in \r\nDarfur and Somalia. Unfortunately, our contingent \r\ndeployed in Somalia as part of the African Union \r\nMission in Somalia (AMISOM) has, over a two-year \r\nperiod, been the target of three suicide attacks that \r\nhave claimed the lives of 25 soldiers and left 35 others \r\nwounded. To that grisly toll, we must add three victims \r\nof the crash of an Ilyushin aircraft into Lake Victoria in \r\nMarch this year. \r\n Those facts show that Burundi is paying a heavy \r\nprice in the international mission to contribute to the \r\nquest for peace in Somalia. Because of this loss of life, \r\nsome in Burundi are calling for a troop withdrawal. We \r\nbelieve that, in its current configuration, the Mission \r\ncan continue and be completed only with considerable \r\nefforts by the international community.  \r\n To that end, the Government of Burundi believes \r\nthat AMISOM’s mandate should be changed to allow \r\ncontingents to protect themselves against deadly \r\nattacks and to take the offensive or pursue aggressors, \r\nif necessary, in accordance with Chapter VII of the \r\nCharter. We believe that contingents must be equipped \r\nwith sufficient resources in terms of quality and \r\nquantity. We believe that strike helicopters and funds \r\nfor information-gathering on the ground must be \r\nprovided. We also believe that additional troops should \r\nbe deployed without delay in order to make the \r\nMission truly continental in character. And we believe \r\nthat the long-promised sanctions against countries, \r\n A/64/PV.9\r\n \r\n3 09-52586 \r\n \r\norganizations and individuals who support Islamist \r\ngroups should at last become a reality.  \r\n The Government of Burundi remains steadfast to \r\nits commitments vis-à-vis AMISOM. However, we \r\nwould like to see the international community respond \r\nas soon as possible to the concerns that I have \r\nexpressed here, which are well-known to all partners \r\nwho wish to see the return of peace in the Horn of \r\nAfrica.  \r\n This meeting is taking place a few months before \r\nthe holding of general elections in my country aimed at \r\nreinvigorating institutions at every level. I would like \r\nto underscore here that the Government is committed \r\nto making sure that those elections are transparent and \r\nthat they are held in an atmosphere of calm. An \r\nindependent national electoral commission has already \r\nbeen put in place, based on a political compromise \r\nbetween the various parties. In addition, a new \r\nelectoral law has just been promulgated. The Ministry \r\nof the Interior has also been strengthened in order to \r\nsupport the commission. The partnership between the \r\nelectoral commission, the Government and donors has \r\njust been formalized through an agreement between the \r\nUnited Nations Development Programme and the \r\nGovernment of Burundi on a project to provide support \r\nfor the elections.  \r\n In that regard, the Government will provide the \r\nindependent national electoral commission a $7 million \r\npackage for the entire endeavour. We are counting on \r\nthe varied support of the international community to \r\nmobilize all the necessary resources to make the \r\nelectoral process a success. We welcome the \r\nwillingness expressed by the Secretary-General to \r\nbring BINUB’s mandate in line with the electoral \r\nenvironment. I need not recall that BINUB’s mandate \r\nshould be agreed between now and the end of \r\nDecember of this year. A successful outcome to the \r\nelections will enable us, in coordination with the \r\nSecretary-General, to redefine the mission of the \r\nUnited Nations in Burundi by focusing major attention \r\non programmes aimed at lasting development. \r\n Burundi must make a success of its electoral \r\nprocess if it is to be able to pursue its economic \r\ndevelopment. Our strategic framework to combat \r\npoverty, which is the point of reference for all efforts \r\nin that regard, has been in the process of \r\nimplementation since 2007. An assessment of that \r\neffort over the past two years reveals satisfactory \r\nresults overall, despite the fact that the performance \r\nindicators we wanted to achieve with regard to certain \r\nmacroeconomic policies have not yet been realized. \r\n In an effort to improve the effectiveness of the \r\nassistance provided to Burundi, the Government, \r\nworking in partnership with donors, has put in place a \r\npartners’ coordination group that provides a forum for \r\ndiscussion in which development partners are \r\nconsulted on all technical and policy issues in \r\nconnection with the implementation of our national \r\nstrategy on development and peacebuilding. Today, \r\ngenuine dialogue and active partnership take place \r\nthroughout the process, from the planning to the results \r\nassessment stages. \r\n With the support of the World Bank, Burundi \r\nhopes to hold a meeting of the Ad Hoc Advisory Group \r\non Burundi next month in Paris, with a view to \r\nmobilizing funds destined for sectors that have been \r\nidentified as having the potential for quickly \r\ncontributing to economic growth and playing a \r\ncatalysing role — namely, those of the energy, \r\nagricultural, private sector, tourism, information \r\ntechnology and communication infrastructure sectors. \r\nWe count on the existing partnership to provide the \r\nnecessary financing. \r\n The Government has come to understand that, in \r\norder to fully restart economic growth, it needs to \r\npromote good governance in the management of public \r\naffairs and further improve the business environment. \r\nTo that end, the Government, with the support of its \r\npartners, has begun a series of reforms aimed at \r\nimproving public finance management and facilitating \r\nprivate domestic and foreign investment in our country. \r\nA new investment law has therefore been promulgated, \r\nwhich the Government has adapted to bring it in line \r\nwith the East African Community’s model. A value \r\nadded tax is already in place and an agency to promote \r\ninvestment will soon become operational.  \r\n Burundi aims to meet the challenge set at the \r\ninternational level to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, as underscored in the Outcome \r\nadopted at the September 2005 World Summit of heads \r\nof State or Government (resolution 60/1). We are \r\npleased to inform the Assembly that, thanks to our \r\npolicy of free primary education and health care for \r\nchildren under the age of five and pregnant women, \r\nBurundi is achieving results that merit support. For \r\ninstance, thanks to that policy, the number of pregnant \r\nA/64/PV.9  \r\n \r\n09-52586 4 \r\n \r\nwomen giving birth in hospitals or health centres \r\nincreased from 22.9 per cent in 2005 to 56.3 per cent in \r\n2008. \r\n In July 2009, the Government of Burundi decided \r\nto provide free malaria treatment and mosquito nets for \r\nits entire population. The Government has also decided \r\nto take responsibility for the medical treatment and \r\nfollow-up for women beginning in the first month of \r\npregnancy, with a view to better protecting the health \r\nof mothers and children. That policy includes an \r\ninformation campaign aimed at curbing the number of \r\nbirths. A national body will soon be established that \r\nwill be responsible for providing health insurance for \r\npeople living in rural areas or working in the informal \r\nsector.  \r\n Education for all is another of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals that the people of Burundi are \r\nworking to achieve. Thanks to community development \r\nefforts, our people built more than 700 schools and \r\nhealth centres in the course of 2008, so as to allow all \r\nschool-age children to benefit from free primary \r\neducation, as decided in 2005 by our country’s \r\nPresident. However, we still face the ongoing problem \r\nof providing the necessary financial resources to equip \r\nthose schools and health centres, provide them with \r\ndrinking water and pay their staff. I need not point out \r\nthat these exceptional steps have been taken to \r\ncontribute to our country’s progress in the run-up to \r\n2015. \r\n Moreover, the Government would like donors to \r\nmobilize additional resources to ensure the \r\nsustainability of our achievements. We would like to \r\ntake this opportunity to heartily thank partners that \r\nhave already supported the implementation of our \r\npolicy to provide free primary education and health \r\nservices for pregnant women and children under the \r\nage of five. We appeal to those who are still hesitant to \r\ncome to our assistance in order to help us to overcome \r\nthe numerous challenges to which I have referred here. \r\n The global financial crisis has not spared \r\nBurundi. While the cost of raw materials has dropped \r\nin general, the decrease has been especially sharp in \r\nthe price of coffee, which is our main export product. \r\nThe Assembly will of course understand that, when our \r\ngross domestic product and our economy’s \r\nmacroeconomic indicators perform poorly, they \r\nundermine the social protection efforts undertaken by \r\nthe Government.  \r\n The volatile market for petroleum products also \r\nhas a destabilizing impact on Burundi’s economy, as it \r\nproduces external shocks that are difficult to bear. \r\nDespite the economic policy interventions that have \r\nbeen taken to counteract the negative effects of \r\ndisturbances in international markets, the economies of \r\ndeveloping countries must nevertheless reiterate the \r\nappeal for restoring order with regard to such current \r\nissues as those pertaining to the stability of \r\ninternational financial markets, the implementation of \r\ntrade agreements, technology transfers and the need to \r\nincrease assistance and investment in Africa.  \r\n Given the situation, we would like once again to \r\ninvite developed countries and the Group of Eight in \r\nparticular to translate into action the commitment they \r\nundertook to raise official development assistance \r\ncontributions to 0.7 per cent of GDP by 2015, as well \r\nas to honour the promise made in Scotland to increase \r\ndevelopment aid by $50 billion per year starting in \r\n2010, with half of this sum allocated to Africa. \r\n Climate change constitutes a threat to peace and \r\nfood security in Africa and around the world. We \r\ntherefore call for the adoption of courageous measures \r\nto limit the production of greenhouse gases and for \r\nincentives to encourage reforestation policies, the \r\nprotection of equatorial forests, the responsible \r\nmanagement of water and energy resources, and the \r\nuse of clean and renewable energies. Burundi endorses \r\nthe common African Union position that was set out by \r\nthe Prime Minister of Ethiopia and will be reaffirmed \r\nat the Copenhagen Conference. We welcome measures \r\nannounced by President Barack Obama, the European \r\nUnion and Japan to considerably reduce greenhouse \r\ngas emissions, manage toxic waste responsibly and \r\nprovide financial and technological resources to least-\r\ndeveloped and landlocked countries. \r\n Burundi renews its pledge to the United Nations \r\nto continue working to ensure that the peoples of the \r\nentire world cooperate in peace and defend the values \r\nof freedom, solidarity and tolerance. These values must \r\nguide the international community in resolving the \r\nbloody conflicts that threaten some parts of Africa, the \r\nMiddle East, Iraq and Afghanistan, and will help us to \r\nfight terrorism and other forms of transnational crime \r\neffectively.  \r\n I cannot conclude my address without reaffirming \r\nthe commitment of my country to multilateralism, \r\n A/64/PV.9\r\n \r\n5 09-52586 \r\n \r\nwhich represents our single best hope for responding to \r\nall threats to peace and security in the world. \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the Second \r\nVice-President of the Republic of Burundi for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Gabriel Ntisezerana, Second Vice-President \r\nof the Republic of Burundi, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by His Excellency Mr. Abhisit \r\nVejjajiva, Prime Minister of the Kingdom  \r\nof Thailand \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of \r\nThailand. \r\n Mr. Abhisit Vejjajiva, Prime Minister of the \r\nKingdom of Thailand, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum. \r\n The President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Abhisit Vejjajiva, Prime \r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Thailand, and inviting him \r\nto address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Vejjajiva (Thailand): On behalf of the \r\ndelegation of the Kingdom of Thailand, I should like to \r\nextend to you, Mr. President, our sincere \r\ncongratulations on your election to the presidency of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. You \r\nmay rest assured of the full support and cooperation of \r\nmy delegation. \r\n We live in one of the most challenging times in \r\nour history. As in the period before the founding of the \r\nUnited Nations more than 60 years ago, the world is \r\nagain facing great challenges. Conflicts and tensions \r\nremain in many parts of the world; terrorists attack; \r\npoverty, disease and hunger still affect many; our \r\nsupply of traditional sources of energy is dwindling; \r\nand climate change is transforming the very \r\nenvironment in which we all live. Added to this set of \r\nissues, the current global financial crisis makes for a \r\nfuture that seems bleak. But, like our forebears more \r\nthan 60 years ago, we also live in hope for a better \r\nfuture. And a large part of this hope today rests upon \r\nthe United Nations. \r\n Despite criticism, we must never doubt the fact \r\nthat the world has been better off with the United \r\nNations than it would have been without it. I say this \r\nbecause overcoming the challenges we have faced and \r\nare facing demands multilateral cooperation. The \r\nUnited Nations has been the bedrock of such \r\nmultilateral cooperation, as well as what the great poet \r\nLord Tennyson termed a “parliament of man”. And it is \r\nthis parliament of man which provides a forum in \r\nwhich we can meet and discuss remedies to common \r\nchallenges, as well as respond to the concerns of our \r\nconstituents — the citizens of the world. \r\n In the interdependent and interconnected world, \r\nno one nation, not even the biggest and the most \r\npowerful, can go it alone. But at the same time, no \r\nsingle nation should be left behind in our pursuit of \r\npeace, prosperity and the protection of human rights. \r\nJust as we join hands to face common challenges, we \r\nmust also extend our hand to those less fortunate, pull \r\nthem towards a brighter future and give them the \r\nopportunity to enjoy the fruits of globalization.  \r\n Thailand stands ready to extend a helping hand. \r\nWe stand ready to share our experiences and the \r\nlessons we have learned from our own financial crisis \r\nin 1997. We believe that our nation’s remedies to our \r\nproblems can be shared and should contribute to the \r\nformulation of international remedies to common \r\nglobal challenges. Central to our belief is that peace, \r\nsecurity, development and human rights are intertwined \r\nand must reinforce each other so that all three pillars \r\nare sustainable. This view is also central to the United \r\nNations. \r\n Thailand believes that moderation is the key to \r\nsustainability. We want to see moderation instead of \r\nexcessive greed, which is the cause of the economic \r\ncrisis; we want to see moderation instead of \r\noverconsumption, which is the cause of environmental \r\ndegradation; and we want to see moderation instead of \r\nextremism and selfishness, which are the causes of \r\nconflicts around the world. We must therefore curb our \r\nexcesses, live within our means and use our resources \r\nwisely. \r\n This idea of moderation is an important pillar of \r\nthe “sufficiency economy” philosophy of His Majesty \r\nthe King. This philosophy should not be understood or \r\nmisunderstood as advocating an inward-looking \r\napproach. Rather, it teaches us that economic \r\ndevelopment and modernization must be better \r\nbalanced and take into account the well-being of the \r\npeople and their economic, social, political and \r\nA/64/PV.9  \r\n \r\n09-52586 6 \r\n \r\nenvironmental needs, so that the country is resilient \r\nand protected from both external and internal shocks. \r\n His Majesty himself has applied his philosophy in \r\npractice, initiating numerous royal projects for the \r\nbetterment of his people and country. His Majesty has \r\nbeen rightly regarded by the international community \r\nas the “development King”. His Majesty received the \r\nUnited Nations Development Programme Human \r\nDevelopment Lifetime Achievement Award in \r\nrecognition of his achievements as well as of his \r\nsufficiency economy philosophy, which has gained \r\nincreasing resonance worldwide. And many of His \r\nMajesty’s projects are being replicated in many parts of \r\nthe world. \r\n The recent global financial crisis has shown that \r\nsufficiency economy is not merely a philosophy, but \r\ncan also be translated into concrete action. Due to the \r\nlessons learned from the 1997 Asian financial crisis, \r\nmost of Thailand’s financial institutions have escaped \r\nthe direct impact of the current crisis, thanks to their \r\nmore prudent style of investment. Entrepreneurs have \r\nmanaged to weather the storm through rational \r\ndecision-making and more careful risk management, \r\ntwo of the key principles advocated by His Majesty’s \r\nphilosophy. \r\n My Government’s socio-economic policy is \r\nguided by His Majesty’s philosophy, which has been \r\nincorporated into our national economic and social \r\ndevelopment plan. Development for us is not just about \r\nthe rate of growth, but also about the quality of that \r\ngrowth. Not only have we boosted Government \r\nspending and investment to jumpstart the economy, but \r\nwe have also set up social safety nets, made \r\neducational reform a priority and upgraded our health \r\nand welfare services. \r\n We have prioritized investment programmes and \r\naction plan to increase strength and to provide greater \r\neconomic opportunities for people at grass-roots level. \r\nWe have also laid the foundation for long-term growth \r\nand competitiveness in Thailand’s various sectors, \r\nincluding agriculture, health care, education and \r\ntourism. In short, we have made Thailand’s \r\ndevelopment a people-centred approach and Thailand’s \r\neconomy more immune from external shocks. \r\n As the Chair of the Association of Southeast \r\nAsian Nations (ASEAN), Thailand has led regional \r\nefforts to address today’s financial crisis and to create \r\nimmunity for East Asia as a whole. We are expediting \r\nthe multilateralization process of the Chiang Mai \r\nInitiative, under the ASEAN+3 framework, comprising \r\nASEAN member States, China, Japan and the Republic \r\nof Korea. The aim of this exercise is to build regional \r\nfinancial stability through a region-wide self-help \r\nsubstantive reserve pooling arrangement. This will \r\ncome into effect very soon. As a region, we have also \r\ncontinued to liberalize trade and reject all forms of \r\nprotectionism. We believe that these efforts can serve \r\nas examples for other regions to follow. \r\n Today’s financial woes affect not only a nation’s \r\neconomy but also the development and welfare of its \r\npeople. This crisis exacerbates the problems that \r\nalready exist, such as poverty, hunger and energy \r\nshortages. Nowhere is this more strongly felt than in \r\nthe developing world, and Thailand is no exception. \r\nAlthough we have already attained the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals in hunger and poverty alleviation, \r\nmuch remains to be done. Thailand understands well \r\nthe challenges developing countries are facing and is \r\nprepared to share with others our experiences in \r\nmanaging and overcoming these challenges. \r\n As a major agricultural economy, Thailand stands \r\nready to contribute to the solution of the world food \r\nand energy crises. We are a major food exporter with \r\nstrong experience and capability in developing \r\nalternative energy, especially biodiesel and ethanol. We \r\naim to ensure a balance between growing energy and \r\nfood crops so that both needs are sufficiently \r\naddressed. \r\n Another pressing concern that can only be \r\nsuccessfully tackled through global cooperation is \r\nclimate change. My Government is convinced that the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange is the core for international negotiations and \r\ncooperation in this area, guided by the principles of \r\ncommon but differentiated responsibilities and \r\nrespective capabilities. \r\n In this connection, Thailand is honoured to host \r\nthe United Nations climate change talks which will \r\ntake place next week in Bangkok. We will spare no \r\neffort in ensuring that this round of negotiations will \r\nmake tangible progress towards a successful \r\nCopenhagen Climate Change Conference in December. \r\n Earlier this week, the Secretary-General \r\nconvened the Summit on Climate Change. We welcome \r\nthe commitments expressed by major economies during \r\nthe Summit, in particular in setting clear goals and \r\n A/64/PV.9\r\n \r\n7 09-52586 \r\n \r\ntargets for their action. I am also pleased to see the \r\nGroup of 20 pledging itself to spare no effort to \r\nachieve a successful outcome in Copenhagen. \r\n For its part, my Government has vigorously \r\npursued environmentally friendly growth. That is why \r\nwe have announced alternative energy as our national \r\nagenda and invested significantly to boost development \r\nin this field, including in energy crops. Moreover, one \r\nof Thailand’s hallmarks is its strong biodiversity, from \r\nwhich Thailand and its local communities have drawn \r\nbenefits through innovative economic activities and \r\nproducts. While we seek to benefit fully from our rich \r\nbiodiversity and natural resources, we also aim to \r\nensure that they are sustainable, regenerated and \r\nreplenished. \r\n It is not enough to ensure that the economic needs \r\nof the people are met. Their political needs are just as \r\nimportant. And there is no better political system than \r\ndemocracy to ensure the people’s freedoms and rights. \r\nIt is my Government’s clear policy to sow the seeds of \r\nsustainable democracy by strengthening our democratic \r\ninstitutions, engaging civil society, ensuring human \r\nrights and promoting good governance and the rule of \r\nlaw. Democracy is not just about majority rule, but also \r\nabout respect for minority rights. \r\n At the regional level, under Thailand’s \r\nchairmanship, ASEAN has made great strides towards \r\nmaking people the centre of the organization’s \r\ndevelopment, as enshrined in the ASEAN Charter. \r\nHuman rights issues are now at the forefront of \r\nASEAN’s agenda. Collectively, we have played an \r\nactive role to create the ASEAN Intergovernmental \r\nCommission on Human Rights, which becomes active \r\nthis October. We are committed to doing our utmost to \r\nensure that that body fully lives up to expectations. \r\n Promotion of gender equality and the \r\nempowerment of women are also important to \r\nThailand. Besides our national effort on this matter, I \r\nam pleased to add that ASEAN is also in the process of \r\nestablishing an ASEAN commission on the promotion \r\nand protection of the rights of women and children. \r\nThis mechanism will play an important part in \r\nenhancing and strengthening the ASEAN human rights \r\nframework as a whole. \r\n At the international level, Thailand is party to \r\ncore international human rights conventions, and we \r\nare strongly committed to the principles enshrined in \r\nthe 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. \r\nThailand’s candidature for a seat on the Human Rights \r\nCouncil for the 2010-2013 term is further testament to \r\nour commitment to enhance human rights \r\ninternationally. \r\n Thailand has consistently rendered humanitarian \r\nassistance to those in plight wherever they may be. We \r\nhave steadfastly contributed to the World Food \r\nProgramme. We have offered our helping hand to those \r\nin need. Our humanitarian commitment was clearly \r\nevident during Cyclone Nargis that befell Myanmar, as \r\nThailand became the logistics hub for the massive \r\ninternational relief effort for that country. \r\n Sustainable economic, political and social \r\ndevelopment is not a mere goal in itself. It ultimately \r\nensures long-lasting peace and security. That is why \r\nASEAN is moving towards becoming not only a \r\npolitical-security community but also an economic and \r\nsociocultural one by 2015. These three pillars reinforce \r\neach other. Within this political-security community, \r\nThailand and its fellow ASEAN members are ready to \r\nenhance cooperation, from dispute settlement to \r\nconflict resolution and from peacekeeping to post-\r\nconflict peacebuilding, especially with regard to \r\ncooperation on training for emergency preparedness \r\nand humanitarian assistance. We hope that our regional \r\nefforts will help contribute to peace and security not \r\nonly regionally, but also internationally. \r\n Thailand itself has played a significant role in \r\npeacekeeping operations worldwide. In the past two \r\ndecades, Thailand has provided nearly 20,000 military \r\ntroops, police officers and civilian staff in support of \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping missions on all \r\ncontinents around the globe, including Cambodia, \r\nTimor-Leste, Burundi and, soon, Darfur. We will \r\ncontinue to do so where our contributions can \r\nstrengthen the overall capacity of the United Nations. \r\n As a member of the Peacebuilding Commission, \r\nThailand also strongly believes in building the right \r\nsocio-economic and political conditions for sustainable \r\npeace in countries emerging from conflict and internal \r\nstrife. We can play a greater role in ensuring \r\ninternational peace and security. That is why Thailand \r\nhas presented its candidature for a non-permanent seat \r\non the Security Council for the period 2017-2018. As a \r\nmedium-sized developing country, we can represent the \r\ninterests and concerns of developing countries not only \r\nin Asia, but worldwide. \r\nA/64/PV.9  \r\n \r\n09-52586 8 \r\n \r\n Over the past four days, we have heard \r\nstatements, one after another, which seem to point \r\ntowards one conclusion, that is, that we are living in a \r\n“challenging period”. And perhaps it is a period in \r\nwhich multilateralism is once again being put to the \r\ntest. But we also have before us a historic opportunity \r\nto act together to right our past wrongs and to make the \r\nright decisions for the future. How we act today is \r\npurely our choice — a choice that will be judged by \r\nour children tomorrow and our grandchildren in years \r\nto come. \r\n Our forefathers chose to establish the United \r\nNations over six decades ago. We must now make sure \r\nthat the United Nations — a symbol of true \r\nmultilateralism — continues to be relevant, efficient \r\nand effective in responding to the evolving challenges \r\nas well as in ensuring development, freedom, human \r\nrights, and peace for all. In that regard, we support \r\nUnited Nations reform that will lead us towards those \r\ngoals. \r\n Let us use our gathering here to remind ourselves \r\nof what the United Nations stands for. And let us seize \r\nthis opportunity together to lay down a stronger \r\nfoundation for a new era of peace and prosperity for \r\nhumankind. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nKingdom of Thailand for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n Mr. Abhisit Vejjajiva, Prime Minister of the \r\nKingdom of Thailand, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Jan Peter Balkenende, Prime \r\nMinister and Minister for General Affairs of the \r\nKingdom of the Netherlands \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Prime Minister and Minister for General \r\nAffairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. \r\n Mr. Jan Peter Balkenende, Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for General Affairs of the Kingdom of \r\nthe Netherlands, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Jan Peter Balkenende, \r\nPrime Minister and Minister for General Affairs of the \r\nKingdom of the Netherlands, and inviting him to \r\naddress the General Assembly.  \r\n Mr. Balkenende (Netherlands): A few weeks \r\nago, the Empire State Building was lit up in orange, the \r\nnational colour of the Netherlands. The reason was \r\nthat, precisely 400 years ago, the Dutch East India \r\nCompany commissioned Henry Hudson to find a \r\nshorter sea route to Asia via the north. After a brutal \r\nvoyage filled with hardships, Hudson decided to \r\nchange course. He never found his shortcut to Asia, but \r\nhe did become the first person to map the area around \r\nthe river that would one day bear his name, including \r\nthe place where we are gathered today. Ever since then, \r\nthe origin of the great city of New York has been \r\nclosely linked with the courage and resolve of Henry \r\nHudson. Today more than ever before, we must make \r\nthose qualities our own.  \r\n In the past year, we have faced the harsh reality \r\nof a financial and economic system on the brink. The \r\ncrisis has been so severe and so rapid that courage and \r\nresolve are now required of us all — the courage to \r\nplace shared values and interests above narrow self-\r\ninterest, the resolve to adapt existing global \r\ngovernance structures to a new reality and the courage \r\nto make decisive choices that take account of all \r\ninterests, especially those of the world’s weakest and \r\npoorest people. That is my clear message to the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n The Dutch Government has no doubt that a \r\nstrong, decisive and efficient United Nations will be \r\nvital to that process. Only an integrated global \r\napproach will deliver the stability, solidarity and \r\nsustainability that the world needs so badly. The last \r\nfew days in New York and Pittsburgh have shown that \r\nthere is a clear realization that the world has changed \r\nand that we must work together more closely than ever \r\nbefore. Our interdependency gives us a shared \r\nresponsibility. We can see now that the problems we \r\nface are too big for any single nation.  \r\n There is therefore strong will to address the \r\nunderlying causes of the economic crisis, to work on \r\nsystemic imbalances and to once again make finance a \r\ntool for growth. The agreement we reached in \r\nPittsburgh on a framework for strong, sustainable and \r\nbalanced growth is a big step forward. It shows that \r\nthere is a widely shared conviction that we have much \r\nto gain from stability, solidarity and sustainability, both \r\nas individual countries and collectively. I would like to \r\nsay a few words about each of those core concepts. \r\n A/64/PV.9\r\n \r\n9 09-52586 \r\n \r\n The current crisis offers clear proof that in a \r\nglobalized world instability anywhere is a threat to \r\nstability everywhere. The international policy response \r\nhas shown that that is widely understood in the \r\nfinancial and economic context. That is a positive sign, \r\neven if there is still a long way to go. The Pittsburgh \r\nagreement on compensation systems should end a \r\nbonus culture that has grown out of control. We cannot \r\nallow the greed of a few to endanger the jobs of many. \r\nWe must therefore prevent that kind of crisis from ever \r\nhappening again. \r\n Mr. Valero Briceño (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n Institutional reform should not stop with the \r\nfinancial and economic sector. There is a clear need for \r\nnew arrangements that will allow us to manage a range \r\nof global governance issues at the same time. In the \r\nlong term, the greatest threat to a stable world order is \r\nto allow the crisis to push the world’s other great \r\nproblems into the background: climate change, for \r\nexample, the energy and food crisis or the pressing \r\nissues of peace and security, poverty and human rights. \r\nWe cannot let that happen. In some cases, we simply \r\nhave to honour commitments that we have already \r\nmade, such as the Millennium Development Goals. In \r\nothers, we need the courage to see beyond this crisis to \r\nthe world of tomorrow, as we must show at the climate \r\nsummit to be held in Copenhagen.  \r\n In any event, the current situation demands that \r\nwe place our common global values and interests \r\nabove our acute domestic problems, however serious \r\nthey may be. Therefore, now more than ever, we need a \r\nstrong, decisive and efficient United Nations. We need \r\nit here in New York, but we especially need it on the \r\nground. In that context, I would highlight the vital \r\nimportance of the One United Nations Initiative, which \r\nneeds follow-up, and soon. \r\n Stability cannot be achieved without respect for \r\nhuman rights. As friends of the Iranian people, we are \r\nconcerned about the worsening human rights situation \r\nand the violent crackdown on popular protests. The \r\nIranian nuclear issue represents a major challenge to \r\ninternational peace and security, to regional stability \r\nand to the non-proliferation regime. The recent \r\nrevelation of a nuclear facility that was long kept secret \r\nis additional reason for great concern. It calls for a \r\nstrong reaction by the international community and for \r\ntotal transparency by Iran. Iran must regain the trust of \r\nthe international community, comply with relevant \r\nSecurity Council resolutions and contribute to peace \r\nand stability in the Middle East. \r\n In June of this year, the United Nations showed \r\nleadership by holding a major conference here in New \r\nYork on the effects of the crisis for developing \r\ncountries. The Netherlands fully supported that \r\ninitiative, as there can be no stability without \r\nsolidarity. After all, there is nothing more destabilizing \r\nthan poverty, hunger and a future without hope. The \r\neconomic crisis and rising food prices are threatening \r\nto sweep away a great deal of hard-won progress. In \r\n2009 alone, the number of people forced to live on less \r\nthan $1.25 a day will grow by at least 55 million. \r\n There is a real danger that those who had no part \r\nin causing the crisis will be the people who suffer most \r\ndeeply. In rich countries the crisis means the loss of \r\njobs and assets. In developing countries it means rising \r\nchild mortality and rising hunger. Therefore, in rich \r\ncountries the crisis is serious; in poor countries it is a \r\nmatter of life and death. \r\n Let the donor countries honour an old promise \r\nand set aside at least 0.7 per cent of their national \r\nincome every year for development aid; and let the \r\ncurrent crisis also inspire recipient countries to use the \r\nfunds as effectively as possible. Now more than ever, \r\npublic support for development aid depends on \r\ntransparency, good governance and an effective fight \r\nagainst corruption.  \r\n I would also add that international solidarity is \r\nnot simply a question of development budgets. It also \r\nconcerns the private sector. More and more businesses \r\nnow recognize the importance of corporate social \r\nresponsibility. I believe there is still a world to be won \r\nin that regard, not only for society but also for \r\ncompanies themselves. Corporate social responsibility \r\nmakes good business sense. \r\n My third subject, sustainability, is essentially \r\nabout making choices and sacrifices, not for our own \r\nsake but for future generations. This session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly is our last major stop on the road to \r\nCopenhagen. We should be aware that the progress we \r\nmake there will affect the lives of our children, our \r\nchildren’s children and so on, down through the \r\ngenerations. That must be our main motive for seeking \r\na radical change in the way we live. \r\nA/64/PV.9  \r\n \r\n09-52586 10 \r\n \r\n In Copenhagen we must reach an ambitious, fair \r\nand comprehensive agreement. We must be ambitious \r\nand set our sights high. Therefore, at Copenhagen the \r\nNetherlands will call for worldwide carbon dioxide \r\nemissions to be halved from 1990 levels by 2050. We \r\nshould be fair to developing countries. Every country \r\nshould contribute to the common goal according to its \r\nmeans. Every country will be expected to play its part. \r\nBut those that need help in designing and \r\nimplementing sound adaptation policies must receive \r\nit. That is why the Netherlands has set aside \r\n€500 million to promote the use of renewable energy in \r\ndeveloping countries. \r\n Comprehensive also means that we should not \r\nsimply pave the road ahead with good intentions, but \r\nwith concrete agreements — for example, agreements \r\non developing the global carbon market, on sharing \r\nknowledge and on financial arrangements. We simply \r\ncannot fail at Copenhagen.  \r\n The world is much smaller than it was in the days \r\nof Henry Hudson, but it is far more complex as a \r\nresult. Any solution to the issues I have raised today \r\nstarts with recognizing our mutual dependence and \r\nresponsibility. Within the concepts of stability, \r\nsolidarity and sustainability we will find the shared \r\nvalues and interests that should guide us on the road \r\nahead. It is a road that requires courage. But to echo \r\nthe words I heard recently from the Italian Nobel Prize \r\nwinner and senator for life Rita Levi-Montalcini, on \r\nher one-hundredth birthday, “Don’t fear difficult \r\nmoments. The best comes from them.” Let us go \r\nforward in that spirit. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister and Minister for General Affairs of the \r\nKingdom of the Netherlands for the statement he has \r\njust made. \r\n Mr. Jan Peter Balkenende, Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for General Affairs of the Kingdom of \r\nthe Netherlands, was escorted from the rostrum. \r\n  Address by Mr. Igor V. Chudinov, Prime \r\nMinister of the Kyrgyz Republic \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the Kyrgyz Republic. \r\n Mr. Igor V. Chudinov, Prime Minister of the \r\nKyrgyz Republic, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Igor \r\nV. Chudinov, Prime Minister of the Kyrgyz Republic, \r\nand inviting him to address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Chudinov (Kyrgyz Republic) (spoke in \r\nRussian): At the outset, I should like to express our \r\ncongratulations to Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his \r\nelection to preside over the General Assembly. We \r\nwish him the best for his work in leading the Assembly \r\nat its sixty-fourth session. \r\n Given the sweeping changes occurring at all \r\nlevels of global development, the role of the United \r\nNations as a universal international forum is difficult to \r\noverstate. The contribution of all Member States to \r\nincreasing the effectiveness of the United Nations can \r\nconsiderably contribute to strengthening international \r\npeace and security, development, human rights, \r\nenvironmental protection and sustainable development. \r\n We believe continuing United Nations reform to \r\nestablish an efficient mechanism to address \r\ncontemporary challenges and threats is important for \r\nthe further strengthening of the Organization’s \r\ncapacities and credibility. We call for broader \r\nrepresentation in the Security Council and for \r\nimprovement in its working methods. We propose \r\nexpanding the number of permanent members of the \r\nCouncil by giving seats to Asia, Africa, Latin America \r\nand the Caribbean. \r\n I would like to confirm that my country, being \r\ncognizant of our full responsibilities, is for the first \r\ntime nominating itself as a candidate to become one of \r\nthe non-permanent members of the Security Council, \r\nfor the period 2012 to 2013. The Kyrgyz Republic, \r\nlocated in the heart of Central Asia, is taking an active \r\npart in maintaining peace and security, economic \r\ncooperation and environmental stability at both the \r\nglobal and regional levels. We are prepared to \r\ncontribute as much as we can to the work of that key \r\nbody of the United Nations. \r\n The election of the Kyrgyz Republic to the \r\nHuman Rights Council in 2009 illustrated the \r\ninternational community’s recognition of our \r\nachievements in building a developed society. I should \r\nlike to take this opportunity to thank Member States for \r\ntheir support of the candidacy of the Kyrgyz Republic. \r\nI assure them that Kyrgyzstan stands ready to make \r\nevery effort to promote issues related to the protection \r\nof human rights and respect for the rule of law and \r\n A/64/PV.9\r\n \r\n11 09-52586 \r\n \r\ninternational law, as well as other issues on the \r\nCouncil’s agenda. \r\n The Kyrgyz Republic welcomes the decision of \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon to visit the Central \r\nAsian countries. We look forward to great results from \r\nthat visit. \r\n The overall situation in Central Asia remains \r\ncomplicated. In many respects, it depends on \r\ndevelopments taking place in neighbouring \r\nAfghanistan. No one would today dispute the fact that \r\nthere is a need to work out and apply fundamentally \r\nnew comprehensive and viable approaches in the \r\nhumanitarian, politico-anthropological and \r\nsocio-economic sectors, which will ultimately \r\ncontribute to the building of a strong and prosperous \r\nAfghan State. It does not appear to be possible to \r\nachieve a final and complete stabilization of \r\nAfghanistan by military means alone. \r\n On 4 March 2009, President Kurmanbek Bakiev \r\nof the Kyrgyz Republic announced an initiative to \r\nestablish at Bishkek, capital of the Kyrgyz Republic, a \r\npermanent forum and centre for hosting international \r\nconferences on security and stability in Afghanistan \r\nand Central Asia. This was called the “Bishkek \r\ninitiative”. We are convinced that this “Bishkek \r\ninitiative” will become a forum of practical \r\ncooperation in the area of security, with priority on the \r\nproblems of jointly bringing about peace, security and \r\nstability in the region, combating terrorism, separatism \r\nand extremism and countering illegal drug trafficking \r\nand cross-border organized crime. \r\n Along with global challenges, every country \r\nfaces its own specific problems. Addressing them will \r\nensure that we move steadily towards the achievement \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals. \r\n At the same time, in this era of globalization, \r\nexisting problems have proven to be very closely \r\ninterrelated. The Kyrgyz Republic, as a landlocked \r\nmountainous country and one of the world’s \r\ndeveloping nations, believes that the world community, \r\nunder the leadership of the United Nations, can and \r\nmust more actively assist in using the foreign-debt-\r\nswap mechanism to achieve sustainable development. \r\n With respect to Kyrgyzstan, given the global \r\neconomic crisis, we propose considering several \r\noptions, namely, a swap of the Republic’s debt for \r\nproviding assistance to Afghanistan in pursuit of its \r\nsocio-economic development, and a debt swap for the \r\nsustainable development of poor mountainous \r\ncountries and the rehabilitation of uranium tailing \r\nponds. \r\n The Kyrgyz Republic calls for the active \r\ninvolvement in Afghanistan’s recovery of neighbouring \r\nStates that possess relevant scientific, industrial and \r\nagricultural capacities. Kyrgyzstan stands ready to take \r\npart in the restoration of communications, construction \r\nand the training of medical, educational and \r\nagricultural specialists. We are pleased to inform the \r\nAssembly that our country and the Organization for \r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) signed an \r\nagreement on the development of a customs centre in \r\nthe city of Bishkek for training Afghan specialists. \r\n The General Assembly has adopted a number of \r\nresolutions on mountainous countries that contain \r\nanalyses of their socio-economic situations and \r\nrecommendations to international financial institutions, \r\nrelevant United Nations agencies and Governments on \r\nhow to assist them in overcoming obstacles to their \r\nsustainable development. The delegation of the Kyrgyz \r\nRepublic, one of the initiators of a draft resolution on \r\nsustainable mountain development, would be grateful \r\nfor support for that draft at the sixty-fourth session of \r\nthe General Assembly. \r\n We discussed problems related to planetary \r\nclimate change at the high-level Summit of the General \r\nAssembly. Kyrgyzstan shares the opinion that \r\nenvironmental and ecological security problems are \r\nposing new challenges and risks in the twenty-first \r\ncentury. Kyrgyzstan will give highest priority to active \r\npreventive measures in the sphere of environmental \r\nprotection as a foundation of its sustainable \r\ndevelopment and to maintain the balance between \r\nhuman rights, society, nature and the preservation of \r\nunique natural sites for our descendants. \r\n The numerous uranium tailing dumps containing \r\nlarge volumes of the toxic waste of uranium production \r\nand other harmful technological wastes are of great \r\nconcern to our region. They pose a grave danger to the \r\nhealth of the people and to the cleanliness of \r\ntransboundary river basins and arable lands. \r\n Kyrgyzstan is working tirelessly with other \r\ncountries of Central Asia to draft international legal \r\ndocuments on the prevention of radiation pollution in \r\nCentral Asia. Two framework documents have been \r\nadopted within the framework of the Treaty on the \r\nA/64/PV.9  \r\n \r\n09-52586 12 \r\n \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons — one on the \r\nenvironmental danger of tailing dumps and the other on \r\nthe creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central \r\nAsia. I would like to inform the Assembly that the \r\nTreaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia \r\nentered into force on 21 March 2009, and we appeal to \r\nnuclear Powers to support this Central Asian initiative \r\nand to sign the protocol on negative security \r\nassurances. \r\n I am pleased to note that the High-Level \r\nInternational Forum held in Geneva on uranium \r\ntailings in Central Asia demonstrated a new model of \r\neffective regional cooperation aimed at practical \r\nresolution of this urgent issue. The great interest and \r\nconcern expressed by all participants — including \r\nrepresentatives of Central Asian and other States, \r\ninternational organizations and donors at the national, \r\nregional and international levels — give us cause for \r\noptimism. I take this opportunity once again to express \r\nmy gratitude to all our partners at the Forum, the \r\nUnited Nations system, the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme, the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency, the European Commission, the \r\nEurasian Economic Community, OSCE and the \r\nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development. \r\n In furtherance of the Forum agreement, the \r\ncountries of Central Asia shall submit a draft resolution \r\nfor consideration by the General Assembly on the role \r\nof the international community in the prevention of the \r\nradiation threat in Central Asia. We hope for timely \r\naction on the part of our international partners, donors \r\nand international organizations to address the problem \r\nof uranium tailing dumps and to provide sufficient \r\nfinancial, technical and other assistance to the region. \r\n The challenges facing the United Nations are \r\ncomplex and demand consolidated efforts from all \r\nStates. The representatives of the United Nations \r\nprovide broad assistance to countries on a wide variety \r\nof issues. We appreciate their constructive cooperation \r\non and support for Members’ initiatives. The United \r\nNations Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy for \r\nCentral Asia, established in Ashgabat in December \r\n2007, has already proven itself in a short period of \r\ntime. The issues raised by the Centre are relevant and \r\nrequire prompt responses. We support the intention of \r\nthe Centre to expand its representation in each country \r\nof Central Asia and request the appropriate committees \r\ntake our views into consideration. \r\n Central Asian countries pay considerable \r\nattention to water and energy problems. Despite the \r\nactivities to increase the effectiveness of water and \r\nenergy regulation in Central Asia, pursued within the \r\nframework of integration organizations and regional \r\nstructures, rallying countries around this issue remains \r\nthe most pressing problem in our region.  \r\n We believe that mutually beneficial cooperation \r\nis the basis for long-term intergovernmental \r\ncooperation in the water and energy spheres. It is \r\nessential to create conditions to improve incentives to \r\nstore water in reservoirs during the winter and then to \r\nmake it available for irrigating fields in the summer. If \r\nthis proposal were pursued, the largest reservoir in \r\nCentral Asia, on the Naryn and Syr Darya Rivers, the \r\nlargest watershed of the region, would have the \r\nrequired stocks of water in times of drought and be \r\nable to provide water at least to maintain food and \r\nenergy security for all the countries of Central Asia. \r\n If decisions are taken only for short-term benefit, \r\nand water is depleted and regulating capacities are lost, \r\nthat would inevitably have dangerous consequences for \r\nthe entire region. These strategic issues can be solved \r\nonly by merging the irrigation and energy schedules for \r\nsupplying water and providing compensation fuel \r\ndeliveries that should be the subject of \r\nintergovernmental cooperation among stakeholders. \r\nWater conservation technologies should also be \r\nexploited.  \r\n In conclusion, I would like to reaffirm the \r\nadherence of the Kyrgyz Republic to the goals and \r\nobjectives of the United Nations aimed at ensuring \r\npeace and security and the welfare of all nations and \r\npeoples on the Earth. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister of the Kyrgyz Republic for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Igor V. Chudinov, Prime Minister of the \r\nKyrgyz Republic, was escorted from the rostrum. \r\n  Address by The Honourable Apisai Ielemia, \r\nPrime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs \r\nand Labour of Tuvalu \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Labour of \r\nTuvalu. \r\n A/64/PV.9\r\n \r\n13 09-52586 \r\n \r\n The Honourable Apisai Ielemia, Prime Minister \r\nand Minister of Foreign Affairs and Labour of \r\nTuvalu, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Apisai \r\nIelemia, Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign \r\nAffairs and Labour of Tuvalu, and inviting him to \r\naddress the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Ielemia (Tuvalu): I am greatly honoured to \r\nhave this opportunity to speak in this body on behalf of \r\nthe people and the Government of Tuvalu, who wish \r\nme first of all to convey their warmest greetings and \r\nfelicitations to the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth \r\nsession. \r\n At the outset, let me associate myself with \r\nprevious speakers in extending our special \r\ncongratulations to Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki on his \r\nelection as President of the Assembly at its sixty-fourth \r\nsession, as well as to reassure him of our support \r\nduring his presidency. I also wish to highly commend \r\nhis predecessor for his exemplary leadership and \r\ndedication to the work of the Assembly during his \r\npresidency over the past year. \r\n As we begin the sixty-fourth session of the \r\nAssembly, the effects of the global financial and \r\neconomic crisis loom over our heads. For a small \r\nisland economy like Tuvalu’s, which is highly \r\ndependent on the import of products from overseas, the \r\nimpact of the global financial and economic crisis has \r\nbeen severe. The price of basic food items has risen \r\ndramatically. My people are suffering from events that \r\nare not of our making. The financial and economic \r\ncrisis and its impact on development and the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals is \r\na global crisis that requires the cooperation of all \r\ncountries. Unfortunately, as is always the case, it will \r\nbe poor small countries such as Tuvalu that will have \r\nto bear the burden. \r\n Globalization has also left its mark in the context \r\nof swine flu. Tuvalu has not been immune to that \r\npandemic. We are grateful that the World Health \r\nOrganization has issued a call to action to help poorer \r\ncountries respond to the outbreak of swine flu. \r\nOutbreaks such as this highlight the need for trade \r\nreforms with respect to access to medicines. In that \r\ncontext, the right to health and access to affordable \r\nmedicines should not be a right for rich nations only. \r\nEvery human being has the right to a healthy life. \r\n This year is a special one for the people and the \r\nGovernment of Tuvalu, not because of something that \r\nwe have achieved and are proud to celebrate but, \r\nstrangely enough, because of something that has \r\nhappened for the very first time in the history of my \r\ncountry and that we strongly condemn. This has to do \r\nwith the actions of pirates off the coast of Somalia. For \r\nfour long months, 12 Tuvaluan seafarers were held \r\ncaptive by Somali pirates aboard a German-registered \r\nship. Those brave Tuvaluan seamen were subject to \r\nvarious privations and will suffer the effects of that \r\nunlawful imprisonment for a long time. \r\n The international shipping community cannot be \r\nheld hostage to the demands of such thieves and \r\ncriminals. This scourge must end. We strongly \r\ncondemn that inhumane form of organized crime and \r\nstrongly urge the United Nations and the international \r\ncommunity to bring the pirates to justice through the \r\napplication of the principle of universal jurisdiction, as \r\nwell as to take immediate action to tackle the problem \r\nhead-on. We also call on the United Nations to \r\nestablish a special task force to address the issue of \r\npiracy. \r\n The year 2009 will hopefully be a watershed in \r\nthe global fight against climate change. In a few \r\nmonths, we will meet at Copenhagen to seal the deal \r\non climate change. As the leader of one of the countries \r\nof the world most vulnerable to the impacts of climate \r\nchange, I hold out great faith for that Conference. But \r\nmy faith will be diminished if key milestones are not \r\nachieved. Allow me to refer to some of those \r\nmilestones.  \r\n First, the international community must commit \r\nto a rapid course of action to reduce greenhouse gas \r\nemissions so that global temperatures do not increase \r\nby more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial \r\nlevels. Anything higher would be disastrous for Tuvalu. \r\nGlobal emissions must peak by 2015, and decline \r\ndramatically thereafter. \r\n Secondly, while we work to develop a new \r\nclimate change agreement in Copenhagen, we must not \r\nabandon the Kyoto Protocol, which is a cornerstone of \r\naction to address climate change. Let me repeat: we \r\nmust not abandon the Kyoto Protocol. I fear that some \r\ncountries are hoping that the Kyoto Protocol will \r\ndisappear so that they can make weaker emissions-\r\nreduction commitments. I hope that will not happen, as \r\nit would certainly be a significant step backwards. \r\nA/64/PV.9  \r\n \r\n09-52586 14 \r\n \r\n Thirdly, we need serious commitments from key \r\ngreenhouse-gas-producing countries. The United States \r\nmust take a leadership role and drastically reduce its \r\nemissions. I strongly appeal to President Obama to \r\ndeliver a significant commitment on emissions \r\nreductions. We also call on key developing countries to \r\ndramatically reduce their emissions. Since the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \r\nwas developed, in 1992, the economies of a number of \r\ndeveloping countries have grown rapidly. They must \r\nnow contribute their fair share to emissions reductions. \r\n Fourthly, we need a strong commitment in terms \r\nof financing and resources to help vulnerable countries \r\nbuild their resilience to the impacts of climate change. \r\nThat means that we need a commitment to new money. \r\nIt would be foolhardy to simply reshuffle existing \r\noverseas development assistance to support actions to \r\naddress climate change. This is a new threat, and we \r\nmust find new money to address it. \r\n Fifthly, we need to reduce emissions resulting \r\nfrom deforestation and forest degradation, but in a \r\ncoherent way. In that regard, carbon markets will not \r\ndeliver climate change outcomes. We must develop \r\nnew funds to carefully build the capacity of forested \r\ndeveloping countries to reduce their deforestation \r\nrates. Whatever actions we take, we must ensure that \r\nthe rights of indigenous peoples are properly protected. \r\n The possible security implications of climate \r\nchange on the livelihoods and well-being of the most \r\nvulnerable countries, especially small island \r\ndeveloping States such as my own country of Tuvalu, \r\ncannot be ignored. Instead, they should be recognized \r\nand addressed vigorously by the United Nations as part \r\nof the collective efforts by all its appropriate subsidiary \r\nbodies.  \r\n Despite the concerns expressed by some Member \r\nStates on the engagement of the Security Council on \r\nthe issue of the security implications of climate \r\nchange, I am pleased to note that the Assembly’s \r\nresolution on the possible security implications of \r\nclimate change (resolution 63/281), which was initiated \r\nby Pacific small island developing States more than a \r\nyear ago, was finally adopted by consensus at a plenary \r\nmeeting of the Assembly in June of this year. Tuvalu \r\nlooks forward to the Secretary-General’s report on the \r\npossible security implications of climate change, as \r\nrequired under that resolution. \r\n Globalization has made Tuvalu a very vulnerable \r\ncountry. It is vulnerable to global economic shocks, \r\nhighly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and, \r\nnot least, vulnerable to disease outbreaks. However, \r\ndespite the wide recognition given and reiterated with \r\nregard to our vulnerability in many different United \r\nNations forums, such as the Rio, Barbados, Mauritius \r\nand Johannesburg conferences and in several major \r\nUnited Nations events, including the Millennium \r\nSummit, the General Assembly and the Economic and \r\nSocial Council have not taken it seriously into \r\nconsideration when addressing the question of Tuvalu’s \r\ngraduation from least developed country (LDC) status. \r\n We strongly believe that Tuvalu’s economic and \r\nenvironmental vulnerability, like that of any other LDC \r\nand small island developing State (SIDS), cannot be \r\ntotally ignored, especially in view of the impact of the \r\ncurrent economic global crisis. Although we are \r\npleased to welcome the latest decision of the United \r\nNations Committee for Development Policy not to \r\nrecommend Tuvalu for graduation from LDC status for \r\nthe next three years, we continue to appeal to this \r\nAssembly, the Economic and Social Council and our \r\ndevelopment partners to carefully reconsider and \r\nreview the criteria and graduation rules for LDC \r\ngraduation. We strongly believe that no LDC that is \r\nrecognized as highly vulnerable should be forced to \r\nlose its LDC status. \r\n One of the priority areas highlighted in the \r\nPresident’s statement at the opening of the sixty-fourth \r\nsession of the General Assembly is United Nations \r\nreform and democratization. We could not agree more, \r\nespecially on the necessity and importance of the \r\nreform and revitalization of the General Assembly and \r\nthe Security Council to enable them to fulfil their roles \r\ncomprehensively. \r\n We commend the progress of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on the question of \r\nequitable representation on and increase in the \r\nmembership of the Security Council and other related \r\nmatters. We fully recognize the need to restructure and \r\nexpand the Security Council to reflect a fair and \r\nbalanced representation of all regions. In this context, \r\nwe believe that small island developing States should \r\nbe allocated a seat on the Security Council. \r\n As a full Member of the Organization, Tuvalu is \r\nproud to be part of the United Nations family and \r\nenjoys a sense of ownership through the establishment \r\n A/64/PV.9\r\n \r\n15 09-52586 \r\n \r\nof a long-overdue United Nations joint presence office \r\nin Tuvalu in May this year. Although we appreciate its \r\nestablishment, we hope that it will not create another \r\nlayer of bureaucracy among United Nations \r\nimplementing agencies, but that it will be more \r\nresponsive to the aspirations and needs of Tuvalu in a \r\nmore coherent, efficient and effective manner. More \r\nimportantly, it is crucial that the office focus on the \r\nestablishment of more concrete development projects \r\non the ground for the benefit of the people of Tuvalu \r\nrather than mostly on enabling activities. \r\n I am compelled again to draw the attention of \r\nUnited Nations Member States to the plight of the \r\npeople and Government of Taiwan. As a proud nation \r\nof 23 million people, Taiwan must be given the right to \r\nself-determination — a principle that must be upheld \r\nby the United Nations. Taiwan also has all of the \r\nhallmarks of nationhood. It has a democratic system of \r\nGovernment and it is certainly a responsible \r\ninternational player in world trade, development and \r\ndiplomatic relations; not least, Taiwan has a clearly \r\ndefined territory. \r\n Although Tuvalu appreciates the long-overdue \r\ncourtesy finally accorded to the Government of Taiwan \r\nto participate as an observer to the World Health \r\nOrganization’s (WHO) World Health Assembly this \r\nyear, Tuvalu strongly believes that Taiwan deserves to \r\nparticipate more fully as a member of WHO and other \r\nUnited Nations specialized agencies. Tuvalu therefore \r\nreiterates its strong appeal for Taiwan’s aspirations and \r\ndesire to participate meaningfully as a full member of \r\nthe specialized agencies of the United Nations to be \r\ngiven the proper and urgent attention they deserve. \r\n In conclusion, my Government acknowledges \r\nwith full confidence that globalization and its impact in \r\nevery corner of the globe cannot be denied. This makes \r\nthe role of the United Nations even more important. \r\nHowever, we need to conclude the long-overdue \r\nreforms of the United Nations, especially the Security \r\nCouncil and the General Assembly, to enable the \r\nOrganization to deliver its services in a more \r\ntransparent, coherent, efficient and effective manner. \r\n We must work together to rebuild the global \r\neconomy. We must work together to combat climate \r\nchange, with special recognition given to the plight of \r\nthe most vulnerable countries, especially the LDCs and \r\nSIDS. Not least, we must work together to ensure that \r\neveryone enjoys a healthy life. We will continue to \r\nsupport the United Nations and sincerely hope that it \r\nwill not abandon the concerns of a small island country \r\nlike Tuvalu.  \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs and \r\nLabour of Tuvalu for the statement he has just made. \r\n The Honourable Apisai Ielemia, Prime Minister \r\nand Minister of Foreign Affairs and Labour of \r\nTuvalu, was escorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by The Honourable Patrick Manning, \r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Trinidad  \r\nand Tobago \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. \r\n The Honourable Patrick Manning, Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, \r\nwas escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency \r\nMr. Patrick Manning, Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Trinidad and Tobago, and inviting him to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n Mr. Manning (Trinidad and Tobago): In \r\ncircumstances like these, I would normally speak for \r\nabout an hour, but I would like to assure you, Sir, and \r\nthe Assembly that the quality of mercy is not strained \r\nand that I will be considerably briefer than that. Today, \r\nI propose to stay within the time allotted to me. \r\n Trinidad and Tobago extends its sincerest \r\ncongratulations to the President on his ascension to the \r\nstewardship of this sixty-fourth session of the General \r\nAssembly. We know that his vast experience and \r\nleadership qualities will ensure very successful \r\ndeliberations. We also pay tribute to his predecessor, \r\nMr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann of Nicaragua, for his \r\nvision and fearless discharge of his responsibilities as \r\nPresident of the Assembly at its sixty-third session. \r\n We convey our very best wishes to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon, whom we welcomed to Port of \r\nSpain earlier this year when Trinidad and Tobago \r\nhosted the fifth Summit of the Americas. We assure \r\nhim of our continuing support as he pursues his \r\nA/64/PV.9  \r\n \r\n09-52586 16 \r\n \r\nmission to ensure that the United Nations meets the \r\nnew challenges of the twenty-first century. \r\n We meet at a time of very serious challenges for \r\nthe world economy. We are now beginning to emerge \r\nfrom a global recession caused by a near collapse of \r\nthe international financial system, but there is no room \r\nfor complacency. Unemployment continues to grow in \r\nalmost every country, credit remains contracted and \r\nconsumer confidence, that most critical factor, persists \r\nat very low levels. Additionally, there is no certainty of \r\na steady upward trajectory for the global economy. \r\nValued opinion on this matter points to the possibility \r\nof further recessionary trends before the present green \r\nshoots produce flourishing green fields. \r\n We clearly cannot take our eye off the ball. We \r\nmust not return to business as usual. We should not \r\ncountenance the resurfacing of discredited patterns on \r\nfinancial streets and capitals. We must be wary of the \r\nlevel of adventurousness in leading financial \r\ninstitutions that contributed very significantly to \r\ndriving the world to the edge of an economic precipice \r\nfrom which we are just starting to pull back. There is \r\njustification for concern about this situation in every \r\ncountry on this planet. In the globalized economy, we \r\nare all affected by policies or actions that direct the \r\ninternational financial system. \r\n We of the smaller countries and the developing \r\nworld have always been the most vulnerable and the \r\nworst affected. It is happening again. Especially in the \r\nsouthern hemisphere, the prospects have grown for \r\nincreased poverty, unemployment and general slippage \r\nin the development process. How much longer will this \r\nacute vulnerability of so many nations persist? How \r\nmany more dreams must now, once again, be deferred? \r\n The trust of the world in the totally unregulated \r\nmarket has been entirely misplaced. We must now \r\ncapitalize on the opportunity of this crisis and, without \r\ndelay, reform our international economic system. The \r\nglobal architecture must be transformed to take the \r\nnew realities into account. Among these are new and \r\nemerging centres of economic power and the now \r\nindispensable need to deliberately generate growth in \r\nthe developing world if the global economy is to \r\nachieve resurgence and sustainability. In this extremely \r\ninterconnected world, it is our collective resources, \r\ningenuity, productivity, markets and technology that \r\nwill keep all of us afloat. \r\n Let this General Assembly therefore play its part \r\nin ensuring that we leave behind the old approaches \r\nthat suffocated development of the many for the benefit \r\nof the few. Let it call for greater recognition of the \r\nabsolute need to bring into the global mainstream the \r\nentire productive and purchasing capacity of this \r\nplanet, our collective home. \r\n We are heartened by developments and decisions \r\namong the countries of the Group of 20, but we must \r\nensure that there is absolutely no reversal of the new \r\napproach; no dimming of the new light that the present \r\ncrisis has generated; and no diminution of the \r\nacceptance that we are all in this together and that \r\ndevelopment everywhere translates into prosperity for \r\nall. Let us therefore ensure that the reform of \r\ninternational financial institutions does indeed take \r\nplace; that we entrench greater sensitivity to the \r\nvarying needs of countries at differing levels of \r\ndevelopment; that new voices, respecting and \r\nrepresenting more of humanity, are in the decision-\r\nmaking process; and that resource flows for trade and \r\ninvestment are in fact realized and activated. \r\n The Caribbean Community (CARICOM) has not \r\nbeen spared the debilitating effects of the current \r\nglobal economic situation. Most CARICOM States are \r\nnow experiencing economic contraction and rising \r\nlevels of debt and unemployment, with their \r\nchallenging social consequences. It is therefore \r\nregrettable that some middle-income countries, such as \r\nmany in CARICOM, may not be eligible for funding \r\nunder some of the World Bank’s facilities for \r\ninternational development assistance.  \r\n Given their vulnerabilities, middle-income \r\ncountries’ need for access to concessionary financing \r\nmust not be underestimated. This was highlighted in \r\n2008 at the Third Ministerial Conference of Middle-\r\nIncome Countries in Namibia, which called for \r\nenhanced levels of international development \r\nassistance and noted that the current categorization \r\ndoes not accurately reflect the particularities and needs \r\nof these nations. This General Assembly must take \r\nsteps to advance the cause of middle-income countries \r\nin this matter. \r\n The situation in Haiti is one of grave concern. We \r\nare encouraged by the diverse United Nations-related \r\ninitiatives aimed at promoting peace and security in \r\nthat country, but greater attention is required by the \r\ninternational community. Arising out of the Fifth \r\n A/64/PV.9\r\n \r\n17 09-52586 \r\n \r\nSummit of the Americas, Trinidad and Tobago has \r\nadvanced a proposal for the establishment of a \r\nhemispheric development fund for Haiti, to which all \r\nwestern hemisphere countries would be expected to \r\ncontribute. Haiti is first and foremost a western \r\nhemisphere challenge, and we see this fund as essential \r\nto the re-establishment of proper standards of living in \r\nthat country. We bring this matter before the General \r\nAssembly for its support. \r\n One of the very significant problems facing the \r\nglobal community is transnational organized crime of \r\nincreasing strength, which includes terrorist activity as \r\nwell as the illegal traffic in drugs, arms and persons. \r\nThe Caribbean is particularly plagued by the illegal \r\ndrug trade, which uses our region as a trans-shipment \r\nroute for its pernicious cargo headed northwards. This \r\nactivity has a corrosive effect on our small societies, \r\nfuelling, for example, trafficking in small arms and \r\nlight weapons, with troubling consequences.  \r\n In CARICOM, we have been pooling our \r\nresources for this fight. There is now unprecedented \r\ncooperation among the legal and security systems of \r\nour countries, but we need more resources in our \r\nstruggle with this menace. We will continue to engage \r\nin the various processes of the United Nations aimed at \r\naddressing this problem. We encourage those Member \r\nStates that have not been supportive of the initiative \r\naimed at negotiating a legally binding arms trade treaty \r\nto join those States working to ensure that it becomes a \r\nreality. \r\n But the security situation has been aggravated by \r\nthe deteriorating economic situation in many of our \r\ncountries, weakened by the loss of preferential markets \r\nfor bananas and sugar. The situation is exacerbated by \r\nthe new paradigm of reciprocity in trade, and by the \r\nfact that both the tourism industry and the financial \r\nservices sector, to which many have turned to \r\nsupplement their economic development, have not \r\nproduced the anticipated returns. The economic \r\nsituation of these countries has therefore become even \r\nmore critical, with severe consequences for the security \r\nand prosperity of our region, given the inextricable link \r\nbetween security and socio-economic development. \r\n Climate change is one of the major challenges \r\nfacing our civilization today. The Secretary-General \r\nmust be highly commended for his commitment to \r\ndealing with this issue, which he declared as a priority \r\nat the start of his tenure. In this regard, we add our \r\nvoices to those that have praised highly the United \r\nNations Summit on Climate Change, which has just \r\nconcluded. This General Assembly must promote more \r\nmeaningful action directed towards an internationally \r\nacceptable formula for the reduction of carbon \r\nemissions. \r\n Trinidad and Tobago wishes to make it absolutely \r\nclear that we do not accept the per capita basis for the \r\ndetermination of levels of carbon emissions. It is \r\nmanifestly unfair to a small, energy-producing \r\ndeveloping country like ours with a small population. \r\nWe consider the method of absolute emissions to be a \r\nmore just method of determining a country’s \r\ncontribution to global warming, since it is affected not \r\nby per capita emissions, but by absolute levels. The \r\nquestion of population size, in this context, has nothing \r\nto do with the matter whatsoever. \r\n We also assure the Assembly that our country has \r\nalready voluntarily embarked on reducing emissions \r\nthrough a programme that includes the pursuit of \r\nrenewable sources of supply. We will also be hosting \r\nthe 53 Commonwealth heads of Government at a \r\nmeeting in Port of Spain in November of this year. This \r\nwill be the last major summit before the Copenhagen \r\nClimate Change Summit in December. We propose to \r\nuse the opportunity to attempt to forge a consensus that \r\nwould reflect the common views of the \r\nCommonwealth, comprising as it does both high \r\ngreenhouse-gas emitters and some of the countries \r\nmost threatened by climate change. We are determined \r\nto do all in our power to ensure agreement in \r\nCopenhagen. \r\n We are firmly of the view that non-communicable \r\ndiseases demand the heightened attention of the \r\ninternational community at this time. It has been \r\nforecast that by 2020 non-communicable diseases will \r\naccount for approximately 73 per cent of global deaths \r\nand 60 per cent of the global burden of disease. We \r\njoin the call for indicators on non-communicable \r\ndiseases and injuries to be integrated into the core \r\nmonitoring and evaluation system of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. We have taken this matter on \r\nboard at the level of the Caribbean Community. Indeed, \r\nwe held a special regional summit in Port of Spain on \r\nchronic non-communicable diseases in 2007. I now \r\npropose that this Assembly convene a special summit \r\nmeeting of the United Nations on non-communicable \r\ndiseases at the earliest opportunity. \r\nA/64/PV.9  \r\n \r\n09-52586 18 \r\n \r\n The year 2015 is fast approaching, but there has \r\nbeen, sadly, no encouraging progress towards our \r\nMillennium Development Goal of food security for all \r\nby that date. Indeed, we have fallen behind in our \r\nschedule, with an increase in deaths from hunger and \r\nmalnutrition in the developing world. A much greater \r\nsense of urgency is needed in our approach to this \r\nsituation. All countries must honour their commitments \r\nmade at the 2008 High-Level Conference on World \r\nFood Security. Trinidad and Tobago therefore looks \r\nforward to the next World Summit on Food Security, \r\nscheduled for November in Rome, with the expectation \r\nthat the results will aid the international community in \r\nachieving the revised target set by the Food and \r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations to \r\neradicate hunger by 2025. \r\n My country is committed to an international order \r\nbased on peace, security and the right to development \r\nof all countries. We believe that democracy and \r\nrepresentation are key to achieving meaningful and \r\neffective multilateralism. We therefore wish again to \r\nsupport efforts to reform the Security Council. Reform \r\nof that important organ of the United Nations, \r\nresponsible for the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security, must include efforts aimed at making its \r\ncomposition reflect more closely the global \r\ngeopolitical realities since the end of the Second World \r\nWar. \r\n In this new century, the United Nations must \r\nbecome an even more effective voice for all of \r\nmankind. We have very important work ahead of us at \r\na very challenging time in our history. Let us never \r\nlose sight of our main purpose, which is the security \r\nand development of the people of the world. Let us \r\nrenew our focus on this main objective. \r\n Let us therefore support the reign of fundamental \r\nfreedoms and human rights in every country. Let us \r\nstrive for the individual empowerment of citizens in \r\nevery nation; let there be opportunity and upward \r\nmobility for all; let none be marginalized on the \r\nperiphery; and let the abundant talent and potential of \r\nhumanity flower everywhere, serving as inspiration, \r\nguidance and example to present and future \r\ngenerations. \r\n Let us therefore join our strengths for the benefit \r\nof all. Let us indeed build a global community where \r\nthere is increasing and intensified cooperation and \r\ncommunication among our nations, where no country \r\nlags behind, and where all nations and their peoples are \r\non the international road to development. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I thank the Prime \r\nMinister of Trinidad and Tobago for the statement he \r\nhas just made. \r\n The Honourable Patrick Manning, Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, \r\nwas escorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by The Honourable Tuilaepa \r\nLupesoliai Sailele Malielegaoi, Prime Minister \r\nof the Independent State of Samoa \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the Independent State of Samoa. \r\n The Honourable Tuilaepa Lupesoliai Sailele \r\nMalielegaoi, Prime Minister of the Independent \r\nState of Samoa, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency \r\nMr. Tuilaepa Lupesoliai Sailele Malielegaoi, Prime \r\nMinister of the Independent State of Samoa, and \r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Malielegaoi (Samoa): The value of the \r\nUnited Nations to humanity has not diminished with \r\nthe passing of time. Our Organization remains as \r\nrelevant today as when it was established 64 years ago. \r\nIts status as the world’s pre-eminent body will be \r\ndiminished if we as leaders do not accord it the respect \r\nour Organization deserves and observe its etiquette. \r\n Recent crises have not only validated our global \r\nsustainability, but highlighted our interconnectedness \r\nand interdependence. These crises, from those in food \r\nand energy security to the global recession and \r\npandemic, have adversely affected all Member States \r\nto varying degrees. Although they have resulted from \r\nthe decisions and actions of a few, the crises have not \r\ndifferentiated in impact between developed and \r\ndeveloping countries or between the rich and the poor. \r\nThe costs of these crises in terms of human suffering \r\nand social upheaval have been considerable, and \r\njustifiably required the collective and concerted global \r\naction that now seems to be working with a good \r\ndegree of success. \r\n A/64/PV.9\r\n \r\n19 09-52586 \r\n \r\n These crises are eminently solvable and short-\r\nterm when compared to the great and grave threat the \r\nworld faces from environmental degradation and \r\nclimate change. This week’s summit of the Alliance of \r\nSmall Island States and the Secretary-General’s high-\r\nlevel meeting both underscored the predominance and \r\nurgency of the climate change challenge. Their core \r\nmessages were unambiguous. Climate change is not a \r\nfuture phenomenon; it is real and already occurring in \r\nPacific countries and low-lying islands elsewhere. It is \r\nno longer a question of when, but rather of how severe \r\nthe magnitude of its impact will be. The full cost \r\nsociety must bear is becoming a stark reality that we \r\ncan no longer ignore today. \r\n Climate change is not a concern of small island \r\ndeveloping States alone. Our vulnerability to climate \r\nchange should not absolve those responsible for its \r\ncauses in the past or now, nor should it be used to shift \r\nthe burden of leadership and responsibility away from \r\nthe main carbon emitters. Developed and emerging \r\neconomies will all be affected one way or another. \r\nSadly, the human and financial costs will be borne \r\ndisproportionately by small island developing States. \r\n A Copenhagen climate pact is therefore a must. It \r\nrequires a new brand of cooperation and a broad \r\noutlook. The narrow pursuit of self-interests and the \r\nuse of economic and political expediencies should be \r\nset aside and must not be allowed to derail the goal of \r\nconcluding an ambitious and binding agreement. \r\nClimate change is also everyone’s job. While \r\nacknowledging historical responsibility is legitimate, \r\nallowing it to get in the way of making decisions to \r\nreach a comprehensive agreement would be a grave \r\nmistake. Reaching a climate change agreement is \r\ntherefore a test of multilateral solidarity.  \r\n Time is running out. The impacts of climate \r\nchange are getting worse daily. Playing the blame-and-\r\nshame game, or waiting to be led but not being willing \r\nto lead, are no longer options. For no single nation, no \r\nsingle group of nations and no single organization can \r\nwin the war against climate change on its own. The \r\ndivergent yet inextricably linked interests of Member \r\nStates demand that we seal a deal in Copenhagen. \r\n The cost of adaptation and mitigation at the \r\nnational level can be prohibitive because most of our \r\npeople and infrastructure are found along the coastal \r\nareas. Relocating them inland would be costly due to \r\nour rough and rugged terrain and the number of people \r\ninvolved. However, that has not deterred us. Using our \r\nresources and by partnering with the international \r\ncommunity, we continue to support the global effort to \r\nbuild our resilience against climate change. Our \r\nplantation access roads programme is one such \r\ninitiative. It facilitates relocation and helps boost \r\nagricultural production as a response measure to \r\nclimate change and to food security. \r\n The shadow of the financial crisis envelops us \r\nstill. As with climate change, most developing nations \r\nare victims forcibly drawn into the maelstrom of the \r\ncrisis through its consequential impact on the global \r\neconomy. Although remote from the epicentres of the \r\ncrises, our small and vulnerable island economies have \r\nnot been spared. Indeed, it has been acknowledged by \r\nthe Group of 20 that the global recession impacts the \r\nvulnerable and poorest countries disproportionately. \r\nInternational acceptance of the collective responsibility \r\nto provide assistance to help those countries mitigate \r\nthe impact of the global recession has also been very \r\nimportant. \r\n That undertaking to provide assistance is simply \r\ncritical for small and open economies like that of my \r\ncountry. The global recession has contracted our small \r\neconomy, and our narrow Government revenue base \r\nhas taken some hard hits that have made it impossible \r\nto provide on our own the kind of stimulus package \r\nthat would meaningfully mitigate the impacts of the \r\nrecession, let alone reignite growth in the economy.  \r\n In the circumstances, the effective assistance \r\nneeded by our economy at this time is direct budgetary \r\nsupport, which should be necessary only for the short \r\nterm to sustain expenditure, allow us breathing space to \r\nrebalance our finances, and put the economy back onto \r\nthe path of growth. We acknowledge with appreciation \r\nthe readiness of our development partners and of \r\ninternational financial institutions, such as the World \r\nBank and the Asian Development Bank, to \r\nsympathetically consider our requests in that regard. \r\n Samoa will graduate from the list of least \r\ndeveloped countries in December 2010. The \r\nintervention of the financial crisis was unanticipated \r\nand not taken into account when the decision was made \r\nto advance our country to the transitional period. An \r\nextension of the transitional period is therefore both \r\nnecessary and justified. \r\n The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \r\nwill be reviewed next year. Our scorecard on all eight \r\nA/64/PV.9  \r\n \r\n09-52586 20 \r\n \r\nGoals gives us guarded optimism, although meeting \r\nevery one of them in the time frame allowed remains a \r\nchallenge. Our needs are not matched by the resources \r\nat our disposal. Hence, central to our efforts to realize \r\nthe MDGs is the implementation of Goal 8 on \r\nachieving durable global partnerships for development. \r\nBut some aid donors either take their time to respond \r\nor do not do so at all. That is cause for justifiable alarm \r\nbecause if they are not forthcoming with relatively \r\nmodest resources to help us achieve the MDGs, then \r\nthe prospects for an effective global response to \r\nclimate change will all but vanish. \r\n The Pacific is a region of relative peace. We have \r\nbeen spared the scars of war and conflict, and nature \r\nhas gifted us the sea and land for our livelihood. While \r\nwe have challenges and differences, they tend to be \r\nlocalized. Our development needs, individually and \r\nregionally, are modest by world standards. However, \r\nbelying that tranquillity is our acute economic \r\nvulnerability. \r\n Given our credentials as a region of relative \r\nstability with needs that are not as large as those of \r\nother parts of the world, one would expect the \r\ninternational donor community to be jostling for \r\nopportunities to assist our development efforts. On the \r\ncontrary, that has not been borne out in the general \r\nexperience of the region. Some development partners \r\nseem unconcerned as to where and how their \r\ndevelopment aid is spent; whether it is in war-torn, \r\ndevastated and unstable regions or as a front to support \r\nmilitary-related industries at home appears to be of no \r\nconsequence. Then, there are those who engage in \r\nposturing and rhetoric that are devoid of tangible or \r\nreal action on the ground. \r\n Sustainable partnership is based on mutual trust \r\nand respect. That has been the foundation of Samoa’s \r\nrelationship with our main development partners: \r\nAustralia, China, the European Union, Japan and New \r\nZealand. All have supported us and continue to do so at \r\nevery step of our development journey. Italy, Austria \r\nand Turkey are our newest partners, assisting in the \r\nrenewable energy field, and we would like to engage \r\ncountries at the cutting edge of renewable energy \r\ntechnology, such as China, Germany, Japan and the \r\nUnited States, to assist us in that key sector.  \r\n The One United Nations Initiative is a timely \r\nproject that reduces the costs and improves the \r\nefficiency and effectiveness of aid delivery by the \r\nUnited Nations system. Resources saved through that \r\nInitiative should flow back to benefit Member States. \r\n A permanent solution to the Israeli-Palestinian \r\nconflict continues to be an elusive goal, and seems a \r\nlost cause. President Obama’s relaunching afresh this \r\nweek of the stalled Middle East peace talks will \r\nhopefully be the catalyst that brings about renewed \r\nimpetus in achieving a secure State of Israel living \r\nalongside a Palestinian State. \r\n Mr. Christian (Ghana), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n International terrorism is a global menace. It \r\ncreates an atmosphere of collective fear and \r\nintolerance. It preys on the innocent, vulnerable and \r\ndefenceless and disrupts any progress towards peace \r\nand development. Terrorism in all its forms and \r\nmanifestations should always be condemned \r\nunreservedly. Individual actions by States cannot in \r\nand of themselves provide a solution. We must \r\nshoulder our responsibility to act together to meet the \r\nthreat through concerted multilateral action, which \r\nunderpins the spirit of our Organization. \r\n Wars are futile and serve no useful purpose. They \r\nwill not end unless disarmament, nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation and illicit small arms and light \r\nweapons are brought under effective control. The task \r\nof building peace lies with every nation. That is why \r\nwe welcome the decision by the United States to move \r\nforward with the ratification of the Comprehensive \r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We remain hopeful that the \r\nTreaty will enter into force soon. \r\n The United Nations cannot survive unless it \r\nconstantly adjusts and adapts to changing times. After \r\n18 years, Security Council reform has finally entered \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiating process. Samoa \r\ncontinues to support the expansion of the membership \r\nof the Council in both the permanent and \r\nnon-permanent categories. Countries such as Japan \r\nhave the credentials to assume permanent member \r\nstatus. \r\n United Nations peacekeeping operations around \r\nthe world have brought relief and hope to victims in \r\nconflict areas. Samoan civilian police officers are \r\ncurrently serving in three peacekeeping missions side \r\nby side with officers from other Member States. In our \r\nown region, Samoa is a contributor to the Regional \r\n A/64/PV.9\r\n \r\n21 09-52586 \r\n \r\nAssistance Mission to the Solomon Islands under the \r\numbrella of the Pacific Islands Forum. \r\n Let me conclude by wishing the President well in \r\nthe formidable challenges facing his presidency. When \r\nnations stand united and firm in pursuit of the goals of \r\nthe Organization’s Charter, the world can look to the \r\nfuture with confidence. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nIndependent State of Samoa for the statement he has \r\njust made. \r\n Mr. Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi, Prime Minister \r\nof the Independent State of Samoa, was escorted \r\nfrom the rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by The Honourable Sheikh Hasina, \r\nPrime Minister of the People’s Republic  \r\nof Bangladesh \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the People’s \r\nRepublic of Bangladesh. \r\n The Honourable Sheikh Hasina, Prime Minister \r\nof the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum. \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming Her Excellency Sheikh Hasina, Prime \r\nMinister of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, and \r\ninviting her to address the General Assembly. \r\n Sheikh Hasina (Bangladesh): With your \r\npermission, Sir, I would like to speak in Bangla, my \r\nmother tongue.  \r\n(spoke in Bangla; English text provided by the \r\ndelegation)  \r\n I would like to warmly congratulate the President \r\non his well-deserved election to preside over the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. I am \r\nconfident that his wise and able leadership will guide \r\nthe Assembly’s deliberations to a successful \r\nconclusion. I would also like to express my deep \r\nappreciation to His Excellency Mr. Miguel d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann, President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-third session, for his sound leadership in \r\nsuccessfully steering the Assembly’s work during his \r\ntenure. I should also like to pay tribute to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his tireless and dedicated \r\nefforts to reinvigorate the United Nations. \r\n Thirty-five years ago, the father of our nation and \r\nmy father, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, in \r\nhis first address to the General Assembly from this \r\nrostrum, expressed his gratitude to all who supported \r\nour struggle for independence. He also declared his \r\ncommitment to democracy, good governance, human \r\nrights and the rule of law. It is also my proud privilege \r\nand great honour to extend the same commitment here \r\ntoday on behalf of our country. \r\n As members may know, for many years following \r\nthe brutal assassination of Bangabandhu and 18 other \r\nmembers of our family, on 15 August 1975, by \r\nmisguided armed mutineers, Bangladesh was ruled by \r\ndictators and quasi-dictators. Aside from a period in \r\nthe 1990s, the country continued to suffer from \r\nunconstitutional rule, particularly in the most recent \r\nyears. Even I was sent into forced exile. But the will of \r\nthe people of Bangladesh and the good will of the \r\ninternational community permitted my return home and \r\nthe holding of nation-wide elections on 29 December \r\n2008. \r\n Universally acclaimed as free, fair and credible, \r\nand carried out under the supervision of United \r\nNations and international observers, the elections \r\nheralded democracy in Bangladesh. The resounding \r\nvictory of my party, the Awami League, reflected the \r\npeople’s preference for democratic ideals, secularism \r\nand an outright denial of all forms of extremism. The \r\nelections included record high participation by young \r\nvoters and women. \r\n The huge mandate given by the voters to my \r\nGovernment also entrusted it with an equally huge \r\nresponsibility for delivering on people’s expectations. \r\nConsequently, my Government has embarked on \r\nachieving a digital Bangladesh by implementing its \r\nVision 2021 election manifesto. Our goal is to \r\ntransform Bangladesh into “Sonar Bangla” or “Bengal \r\nof Gold”, as envisioned by Bangabandhu Sheikh \r\nMujibur Rahman. \r\n Despite all odds, Bangladesh is making great \r\nstrides in its socio-economic development. Education, \r\nparticularly for girls, is a priority of our Government, \r\nreceiving the largest single share of our annual budget. \r\nOur Government has pledged to ensure 100 per cent \r\nstudent enrolment at the primary level by 2010. \r\nAccordingly, primary education has been made free — \r\nA/64/PV.9  \r\n \r\n09-52586 22 \r\n \r\nwith free books — and compulsory for all children. \r\nProvision has been made for free education for girls up \r\nto the twelfth grade, and stipends are provided for girls \r\nin rural secondary schools.  \r\n As for the Millennium Development Goals, \r\nBangladesh has been successful in removing gender \r\ndisparities in the net enrolment of boys and girls in \r\nprimary and secondary schools. Our Government is \r\nnow planning to provide free tuition for girls up \r\nthrough the secondary level.  \r\n Since children are our future, our Government \r\nruns a food-for-education/cash-for-education programme \r\nproviding food rations to poor primary school children \r\nin rural areas. Our aim is to achieve full literacy by \r\n2014. \r\n Health is another major sector where our \r\nGovernment is striving to make progress. During our \r\nlast period in power, we formulated a national health \r\npolicy whose main thrust was to ensure basic health \r\ncare for all without discrimination. A national strategy \r\nfor maternal health has also been adopted, which \r\nprovides quality services for safe motherhood. \r\nRegarding infant mortality, our plan is to reduce the \r\ninfant mortality rate from 54 per thousand live births to \r\n15 per thousand. Our plan is also to extend child \r\nimmunization programmes to reach 100 per cent of the \r\npopulation during our present term.  \r\n During our last period in power, we initiated \r\nprogrammes to establish one community health-care \r\ncentre for every 6,000 people, in order to bring primary \r\nhealth-care services to people’s homes. Only 4,000 of \r\nthe first phase of 18,000 could be completed during the \r\nperiod we were in power prior to the changeover of \r\ngovernment, and the programme was terminated. We \r\nare now reactivating the programme. \r\n Bangladesh is often cited for its social safety \r\nprogrammes. A wide range of safety nets have been put \r\nin place, such as cash and food transfer programmes, \r\nmicro-credit and other special poverty alleviation \r\nprogrammes, and special programmes for minorities, \r\nthe marginalized, the disabled, the physically \r\nchallenged and the underprivileged. In our earlier \r\nperiod in power, I had introduced an old age pension, a \r\npension for distressed women, Shanti Nibash or old \r\npeople’s homes, a Karmasangsthan Bank to provide \r\nearnings to unemployed youth through productive job \r\ncreation, and Ashrayan or homes on Government-\r\nowned land for homeless people, as well as sustainable \r\njobs.  \r\n An innovative programme instituted by my \r\ncurrent Government seeks to provide employment to at \r\nleast one member of each family. Currently, over a half \r\nof our budgetary resources are allocated to reducing \r\nthe poverty level from 45 per cent to 15 per cent by \r\n2021. \r\n Food security has always been our Government’s \r\nprime concern. During our earlier term in power, my \r\nGovernment’s agricultural programmes made \r\nBangladesh self-sufficient in food, for which the \r\nUnited Nations Food and Agriculture Organization \r\npresented us with its prestigious Ceres Award. After the \r\nchange in government, Bangladesh returned to being in \r\nfood deficit. This time around, our Government has \r\nadopted a national food policy to ensure sustained food \r\nsecurity for all, enhance people’s access to food, \r\nparticularly for children, women and the elderly, \r\nreduce food prices, increase food production by \r\nreducing the price of fuel, fertilizer and irrigation, and \r\nensure supply of farm inputs. \r\n On the international level, at the World Summit \r\non Food Security to be held in Rome in November \r\n2009, Bangladesh will be seeking a global agreement \r\nfor the development of agriculture and the attainment \r\nof food self-sufficiency in developing countries, \r\nparticularly the least developed countries (LDCs). \r\nSubstantial financial contributions from developed \r\ncountries, an agreement on sustainable agricultural \r\npolicies, the transfer of technology, equitable and fair \r\ntrade rules for food and agricultural products with \r\nspecial preferential treatment for LDCs, and the \r\nremoval of agricultural subsidies in the developed \r\nworld will also be sought, in order to address the \r\nchallenges we face in ensuring the food security \r\ncritical for advancing our development agenda. \r\n For some time now, climate change has been \r\nadversely impacting our low-lying, deltaic, monsoonal \r\ncountry. Although Bangladesh’s own contribution to \r\nclimate change is negligible, it is one of its worst \r\nvictims. Erratic floods, cyclones, droughts and \r\nearthquakes have been disrupting our agriculture and \r\nchallenging our water resources, as well as our health, \r\nenergy and urban planning. In particular, cyclones \r\nbattering the coastal areas have taken countless lives, \r\nand sudden floods have uprooted families by the \r\nthousands and continue to do so every year. River bank \r\n A/64/PV.9\r\n \r\n23 09-52586 \r\n \r\nerosion, landslides, soil degradation and deforestation \r\nare causing millions of climate-change refugees. They \r\nalready greatly affect our densely populated cities. It is \r\nalarming that a metre’s rise in the sea level would \r\ninundate 18 per cent of our land mass, directly \r\nimpacting 11 per cent of our people. Scientific \r\nestimates indicate that, of the 1 billion people expected \r\nto be displaced worldwide by 2050 as a result of \r\nclimate-change factors, one in every 45 people in the \r\nworld and one in every seven in Bangladesh, would be \r\na victim. \r\n Bangladesh has therefore decided to take some \r\nmeasures immediately. Dredging all major rivers is at \r\nthe top of the agenda for adaptation to climate change. \r\nCapital dredging projects will keep rivers in their \r\nnatural course, deepen them to hold more water, \r\nrestrict flooding, reduce flood damage, reclaim \r\ninundated arable land and keep them navigable. \r\nMaintenance dredging would then ensure the sustained \r\nregulated flow of the rivers. With the rise in sea level, \r\nthe excavated silt could build, raise and fortify \r\nembankments, increase green belts and help create \r\nelevated flat ground for the homes of the displaced, \r\nthereby discouraging them from moving to cities. \r\nMeanwhile, 14,000 cyclone shelters have been \r\nconstructed, and more are on the way.  \r\n Those activities would obviously entail huge \r\ncosts. A climate-change trust fund has been established \r\nwith our own resources, but in order to implement the \r\nprojects the assistance of the international community \r\nis imperative. \r\n Rapid and unplanned urbanization, occupational \r\ndislocation and lack of food, water and land security \r\nare some of the consequences of climate change. The \r\naffected communities would not only lose their homes. \r\nThey would also stand to lose their identity, nationality \r\nand their very existence and, in some cases, their \r\ncountries. In December this year, we will meet in \r\nCopenhagen for the fifteenth session of the Conference \r\nof the Parties and, therefore, it is critical that the \r\noutcome of the Conference reflect a commitment to \r\nassured, adequate and easily accessible funding for \r\nadaptation and to affordable, eco-friendly technology \r\ntransfer to developing countries, particularly to the \r\nLDCs, as well as specific commitments to deeper cuts \r\nin greenhouse emissions. Bangladesh would, of course, \r\nmake a strong call at the Conference to consider a new \r\nlegal regime to protect climate migrants under the \r\nKyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change that ensures the social, \r\ncultural and economic rehabilitation of migrants \r\ndisplaced through climate change. \r\n On the vital issue of climate change, the recent \r\nbold and courageous proposal of Prime Minister \r\nGordon Brown of the United Kingdom has caught the \r\nimagination of States at the forefront of dealing with \r\nclimate change. Among his proposals, the proposed \r\nfund to support the adaptation and mitigation \r\nprogrammes of countries affected by climate change \r\nhas, in particular, won our support. It could be the \r\nbeginning of a systematic flow of funds towards \r\nimproving the adversely changing environmental \r\nconditions around the globe. The Copenhagen \r\nConference should seriously consider his proposal. The \r\nConference must also be aware that climate-change \r\nmitigation does not restrict the steps taken to alleviate \r\nenergy poverty, and that the post-2012 agreement \r\nshould incorporate predictable and legally binding \r\ncommitments to address the adaptation needs of low-\r\nlying coastal States, small island countries and LDCs. \r\n The world is caught in an economic recession, the \r\nlikes of which has not been seen since the Great \r\nDepression of the 1930s. The economically vulnerable \r\ncountries, such as the LDCs, which are not responsible \r\nfor the crisis, have become its worst victims. \r\nBangladesh is faced with a sharp reduction in exports, \r\nfalling prices for primary commodities, declining \r\nremittances and a severe credit crunch, leading to the \r\ncontraction of our economic growth, rising \r\nunemployment and poverty.  \r\n The crisis is due to years of neglect of equity and \r\njustice, including a fundamentally unfair international \r\nfinancial structure that never changed with the needs of \r\nthe times. The need of the hour is the immediate \r\nrestructuring of the global financial and economic \r\nsystem. The Bretton Woods institutions, namely, the \r\nWorld Bank and the International Monetary Fund, must \r\naccommodate a stronger presence of developing \r\ncountries, especially the LDCs. Indeed, a voting weight \r\nproportionate to share capital has proved unsuited to \r\nthe Bretton Woods system. \r\n Surely, fiscal stimulus packages would help \r\nsupport global demand and aid recovery. However, \r\nliberal trade concessions by developed countries, such \r\nas duty- and quota-free market access and trade \r\ncapacity-building for developing countries, particularly \r\nLDCs, would rescue them from dire straits. The early \r\nA/64/PV.9  \r\n \r\n09-52586 24 \r\n \r\nconclusion of the Doha Development Round of the \r\nWorld Trade Organization trade negotiations would be \r\nan important collective stimulus package for our \r\neconomies. \r\n It is also the time for the countries of the \r\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and \r\nDevelopment to fulfil their official development \r\nassistance commitments to contribute 0.7 per cent of \r\ntheir gross national income to developing countries and \r\n0.2 per cent specifically to the least developed \r\ncountries by 2010, as reaffirmed in the Brussels \r\nProgramme of Action. \r\n The economic turmoil has adversely affected \r\nemployment at the national level and worldwide. The \r\nworst affected are the LDCs, both domestically and in \r\nterms of employment abroad. Remittances constitute a \r\nsignificant part of their gross domestic income. \r\nHowever, recent restrictions on new admissions of \r\nmigrant workers and, even worse, their repatriation to \r\ntheir home countries have resulted in socio-economic \r\ninstability in many countries. Therefore, recovery \r\nmeasures should be designed in such a manner so as \r\nnot to adversely affect employment opportunities of \r\nimmigrant workers from developing countries. \r\n Bangladesh is proud of its outstanding role as a \r\nmajor troop-contributing country serving the United \r\nNations in maintaining peace and security worldwide. \r\nSince 1988, Bangladesh has been involved in \r\n32 United Nations peacekeeping operations in \r\n24 different countries, contributing approximately \r\n83,000 personnel. Today, Bangladesh is ranked second \r\nwith 9,567 peacekeepers serving in various United \r\nNations missions. \r\n With pride I say that, throughout the years, 84 of \r\nour valiant peacekeepers have laid down their lives for \r\nthe cause of peace under the auspices of the United \r\nNations. Sadly, despite our contributions and \r\nsacrifices, Bangladesh does not have proportionate \r\nrepresentation in the Department of Peacekeeping \r\nOperations, nor does it have a say in the planning and \r\nstrategy design of peacekeeping missions. Indeed, this \r\nsituation calls for rectification on the basis of \r\nproportional representation in all fairness.  \r\n As a peaceful nation involved in United Nations \r\npeacekeeping efforts, Bangladesh is naturally opposed \r\nto terrorism. Bangladesh is a party to all terrorism-\r\nrelated United Nations Conventions, which is a \r\ntestament to our commitment to fighting that scourge. \r\nWe categorically reject the claims of those who cloak \r\nthemselves in the rhetoric of Islam or any other faith to \r\njustify violence. Nationwide, we have taken stern \r\nmeasures against militant groups and their leaders. We \r\nare firmly opposed to violence and terrorism; instead, \r\nwe promote peace across the world. Bangladesh, in \r\nsessions of the General Assembly, has spearheaded the \r\nflagship resolution on the culture of peace. At last \r\nyear’s session of the General Assembly, the resolution \r\nwas sponsored by 124 nations.  \r\n The International Mother Language Day was \r\nadopted by UNESCO, at the initiative of Bangladesh, \r\nin recognition of 21 February 1952, when language \r\nmartyrs died for their mother tongue Bangla. Now \r\nevery year on that day UNESCO celebrates all \r\nlanguages of the world. The Bangla language is spoken \r\nby over 250 million people worldwide, primarily in \r\nBangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal. The \r\nBangladesh Parliament therefore recently adopted a \r\nresolution requesting the United Nations to declare \r\nBangla as one of its official languages. Given the rich \r\nheritage of the Bangla language and its singular place \r\nas a symbol of people’s faith in the power of languages \r\nto sustain cultures and indeed the identity of nations, I \r\nseek the support of the membership of the United \r\nNations General Assembly for its acceptance as an \r\nofficial language of the United Nations. \r\n At present we are witnessing a rapidly changing \r\nworld as a result of climate change, economic turmoil \r\nand terrorism. It is crystal clear to those who wish to \r\nopen their eyes that we all belong to a global village \r\nwhere we must live and work together. I therefore call \r\nupon all States to discard short-sighted discords and \r\nadopt a common resolve in facing today’s grim \r\nchallenges. Let us share each other’s responsibilities, \r\nburdens and prosperity. After all, at stake is our \r\ncommon and shared future. In reaching out to one \r\nanother, we will leave a harmonious world for our \r\nchildren and future generations thereafter. \r\n May Bangladesh live forever! Long live the \r\nUnited Nations! \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nPeople’s Republic of Bangladesh for the statement she \r\nhas just made. \r\n The Honourable Sheikh Hasina, Prime Minister \r\nof the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum. \r\n A/64/PV.9\r\n \r\n25 09-52586 \r\n \r\n  Address by The Honourable Denzil Douglas, \r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs, Minister of National Security and \r\nImmigration, Minister of Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and Minister of Tourism, Sports \r\nand Culture of Saint Kitts and Nevis \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister and Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs, Minister of National Security and \r\nImmigration, Minister of Sustainable Development and \r\nMinister of Tourism, Sports and Culture of Saint Kitts \r\nand Nevis. \r\n The Honourable Denzil Douglas, Prime Minister \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs, Minister of \r\nNational Security and Immigration, Minister of \r\nSustainable Development and Minister of \r\nTourism, Sports and Culture of Saint Kitts and \r\nNevis, was escorted to the rostrum.  \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Denzil Douglas, Prime \r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Minister of \r\nNational Security and Immigration, Minister of \r\nSustainable Development and Minister of Tourism, \r\nSports and Culture of Saint Kitts and Nevis, and \r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Douglas (Saint Kitts and Nevis): It is indeed \r\nan honour to address the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nfourth session. Today, we converge in this Hall to \r\noutline how, from the perspective of our respective \r\nnations, this esteemed body might uphold the rights of \r\nall mankind, secure world peace and indeed, ensure the \r\nvery survival of planet Earth. \r\n We converge here in order to arrive at some \r\ncollective insight regarding the interests of the world’s \r\nvarious peoples as well as the interests of humankind \r\nitself. We have come here not only to be heard, but \r\nmore importantly to listen and ultimately to commit \r\nourselves, both as a body and as independent, \r\nsovereign States, to constructive, ameliorative action. \r\n I congratulate the President on his election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth \r\nsession and assure him of my Government’s full \r\nsupport; and if I may, through him thank his \r\npredecessor, His Excellency Father Miguel d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann of Nicaragua for his leadership during his \r\npresidency of the sixty-third session. \r\n Our world is defined by issues of politics, the \r\nenvironment, trade and finance at the global level. Last \r\nyear’s financial crisis, which continues to reverberate \r\nthroughout the world, stands as a sobering reminder of \r\nthe interconnectedness of our economies and the \r\nknowledge that multilateralism is indispensable. \r\nWhether we are speaking about global trade, monetary \r\nand fiscal policies, human rights protection, health and \r\npublic security or protecting the environment, these \r\nissues have become interlinked. And their complexity \r\nmeans that no country can act alone. \r\n The circumstances that precipitated the virtual \r\ncollapse of several financial institutions were not \r\ncreated by small States such as St. Kitts and Nevis. Yet, \r\nas in the case of climate change, their consequences \r\nhave been forced upon us and we are left to fend for \r\nourselves. But, if we are to learn anything from the \r\ncrises we face today, it should be that collective action \r\nand partnership are necessary not only in the \r\nmanagement of conflicts but also in building effective, \r\ncomprehensive and sustainable infrastructure to protect \r\nour citizens’ future. The ever-changing global \r\nlandscape will require that Governments and \r\ninstitutions work to establish common regimes and \r\ninternational regulatory frameworks for some time to \r\ncome. \r\n To that end, my Government will support an \r\nenhanced role for political forums such as the United \r\nNations to strengthen multilateralism. We owe this \r\nmuch to the citizens around the world, who still look to \r\nthe United Nations for hope — rooted in the belief that \r\nthrough our efforts their aspirations will be realized.  \r\n We live in complex times, and unexpected \r\ndevelopments challenge our resolve daily. But we \r\ncannot and must not relent. We must double our efforts \r\nand use the convening power and political authority of \r\nthis Organization and others like it to find common \r\nground, even in the face of strident and sometimes \r\ndivergent views. That is how we build that \r\nindispensable architecture so as to create a legacy \r\nworthy of future generations. And that is no small feat; \r\nit is, in fact, a monumental task. But the Government \r\nof St. Kitts and Nevis is confident that the President’s \r\ncentral role in the coming year will help us to craft a \r\ntemplate for collective action. \r\n I would like this General Assembly to be able to \r\nsee the world from the perspective of a small middle-\r\nincome heavily indebted country. The country that I \r\nA/64/PV.9  \r\n \r\n09-52586 26 \r\n \r\nhave the honour of leading is a small one — the \r\nsmallest nation in the Western hemisphere. Despite the \r\nrecent downturn, small economies like ours continue to \r\ndisplay resilience and to make the sacrifices necessary \r\nto sustain ourselves.  \r\n As far as our access to capital is concerned, our \r\nhard work and sound management have had \r\nunexpected, harsh and destabilizing implications, with \r\nunwelcome restrictions vis-à-vis debt relief and other \r\nkey matters. The international economic crisis has \r\nmade clear the urgent need for the restructuring and \r\nrepair of the global economic system. As this moves \r\nforward, I urge that the very real vulnerabilities of \r\nsmall States that happen to have high per capita gross \r\ndomestic product be more clearly considered and \r\nreflected in multilateral policies, deliberations and \r\nprocedures.  \r\n We seek support for a new debt forgiveness \r\ninitiative within the framework of the reform of the \r\ninternational financial institutions and through the \r\nmaterialization of a concept of middle-income highly \r\nindebted countries, in which peculiarities and \r\nvulnerabilities no longer trigger punitive actions such \r\nas premature graduation from concessionary financing. \r\n In addition, the global economic crisis, which \r\nbegan far beyond our shores, has nonetheless made its \r\nway to us and made it necessary for my country to \r\ndevelop and introduce its own stimulus package, thus \r\nforcing us to sacrifice urgently needed tax revenues in \r\nthe interest of protecting employment and to find the \r\nmeans to shore up and advance the viability of our own \r\nprivate sector. \r\n Nevertheless, we are continuing to invest in our \r\npeople through education and retraining programmes \r\nand by working to attract international investments in \r\ncritical sectors to generate employment and other \r\nbusiness opportunities. By doing this, we hope to \r\nprepare for the future, when the global economy \r\neventually rebounds. \r\n It is no secret that our efforts can sometimes \r\namount to very little, because, through no fault of our \r\nown, it is a fact that when global crises occur, small \r\nvulnerable economies tend to pay a disproportionately \r\nhigh price. But under my leadership, Saint Kitts and \r\nNevis will not play victim or assign blame. We prefer \r\ninstead to work vigorously at the national level and to \r\ncollaborate actively internationally so as to introduce \r\nmeasures and systems that transform our economy and \r\nimprove the lives of our citizens. \r\n Going forward, we want our voices and ideas to \r\ninform whatever new architecture is developed, so as \r\nto avoid the mistakes of the past. Therefore, we will \r\nsupport the measures established to follow up on issues \r\npertaining to recovery from the global financial and \r\neconomic crises. And we intend to participate \r\nenthusiastically in the process to ensure that the \r\nrecovery is comprehensive. \r\n We have common challenges and a shared \r\nresponsibility to tackle them. We in the Caribbean have \r\nrepeatedly called on the international community to \r\nrecognize the special circumstances attending the \r\nrealities of small island developing States, not as a \r\nfavour to us, but as a practical way of addressing the \r\nmultifaceted and complex issues that we face. For \r\ninstance, on the issue of environmental protection, the \r\nGovernment of Saint Kitts and Nevis has always urged \r\na multilateral approach. \r\n The interconnectedness of our planet, then, is \r\nindeed real, and nowhere is it more so than on the issue \r\nof climate change. Whereas small countries such as \r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis have tiny carbon footprints with \r\nnegative environmental impact, global warming and \r\nclimate change, with their effects, do not discriminate. \r\nWe can all agree that the incidence of catastrophic \r\nclimatic events, such as hurricanes, floods and \r\nmudslides, continue to cause more destruction and \r\nclaim more and more lives each year. \r\n The geography of our small islands is changing. \r\nSea levels are rising, and the marine life on which \r\nmany of our citizens depend for their livelihoods is fast \r\ndiminishing. Our coastlines are being affected. Our \r\nreefs are paying a high price. The long-term \r\nimplications for food production are dire indeed. \r\nAgain, though those changes began far beyond our \r\nshores, climate change has been inflicting a massive \r\nand disproportionate blow on nations such as mine, \r\ncausing us now to urge, in the strongest possible terms, \r\ntimely and effective action. Saint Kitts and Nevis is not \r\ninterested in stale debates about blame; we are \r\ninterested in action, and we want to play our own part. \r\n In the interest of advancing global stability, \r\ntherefore, we urge unrelenting commitment to emission \r\ntargets by industrialized nations. We urge that the \r\nmajor global emitters take the lead in ensuring that the \r\nresources are in place so that small island developing \r\n A/64/PV.9\r\n \r\n27 09-52586 \r\n \r\nStates can meet our adaptation, mitigation, technology \r\ntransfer and capacity-building goals. And we urge that \r\nthe emitters embrace the measures needed to \r\ncompensate for the risks and the losses resulting from \r\nclimate change. \r\n We continue to collaborate regionally and to work \r\ntowards efforts in the areas of disaster preparedness, \r\nreduction and mitigation. We recognize that high \r\ndependence on fossil fuels is untenable. Therefore, \r\nwith support from the Organization of American States \r\nand private enterprise, we are exploring renewable \r\nsources of energy, including geothermal energy, in the \r\nFederation of Saint Kitts and Nevis. \r\n As the expiration of the Kyoto Protocol \r\napproaches, my Government welcomes the recent \r\ncommitments by some industrialized countries to do \r\nmore to address harmful emissions. I hope that that \r\nwill be translated into concrete results on the \r\nenvironment and climate change at the Copenhagen \r\nsummit later this year. \r\n I also wish to urge the United Nations to \r\nstrengthen the Small Island Developing States Unit \r\nwith additional resources to make it more effective in \r\naddressing the concerns of Member States. I look \r\nforward to the Unit’s assistance as we work towards \r\nthe five-year review of the Mauritius Strategy for the \r\nFurther Implementation of the Programme of Action \r\nfor the Sustainable Development of Small Island \r\nDeveloping States at the current sixty-fourth session. I \r\nurge Member States to ensure that the agreed goals of \r\nthe Mauritius Strategy and the commitments made are \r\nimplemented and to support initiatives proposed during \r\nthe review exercise. \r\n In multilateralism, constructive partnership is an \r\neffective strategy. In such an approach, we are forced \r\nto appreciate the value of belonging: the need for all \r\npeoples of the world to be embraced within the \r\nfraternity of nations and to be allowed to contribute to \r\nthe common good. The Republic of China on Taiwan, a \r\nconstructive partner to a range of countries around the \r\nworld for so long, has a great deal to contribute to \r\nspecialized agencies and programmes of the United \r\nNations, such as the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change and the International \r\nCivil Aviation Organization, given that climate change \r\nand aviation safety affect its own development, as well \r\nas the well-being of all mankind. \r\n The issue of security continues to be prominent \r\non the international agenda, and the global anti-crime \r\ncampaign intensifies, as concern heightens in the face \r\nof emerging threats to our citizens and to society. This \r\ndevelopment is the result of a new wave of crime and \r\nviolence, especially among the youth population. In the \r\nhemisphere, there is increased focus on human security \r\nin relation to the transnational nature of the categories \r\nof crime — especially illicit trafficking in drugs and \r\nfirearms — that are linked to anti-social behaviour, \r\nparticularly among our youth.  \r\n An emerging trend in the global analysis of crime \r\npoints to a new variable: young people as victims of \r\ncrime. Studies show that, in increasing numbers, the \r\nvictims and perpetrators of crime are young men. The \r\nreality of coexisting in a global village, the prevalence \r\nand sophistication of modern technology, the enhanced \r\ncommunication infrastructure and the free movement \r\nof capital and people have given rise to an \r\nunprecedented escalation in crime and violence. \r\n Youth alienation, youth rage and youth brutality \r\nare troubling global phenomena in urgent need of \r\nglobal analysis and action. And so, this moment \r\ndemands that this body, with its unique capacities and \r\ncapabilities and as part of its quest for international \r\nsocietal stability, marshal all available resources to \r\nbetter identify the underlying causative factors and \r\ncome to a clear agreement as to how, individually and \r\ncollectively, we can halt and reverse this destabilizing \r\ntrajectory. \r\n Violence is a multisectoral public-policy \r\nchallenge. It spans several areas, including public \r\nsecurity, governance, development and public health. \r\nThe human, social and financial costs of violence are \r\nunacceptably high. In addition to physical injury and \r\ndeath, violence has a serious and lifelong impact on \r\nmental and physical health, including \r\nnon-communicable diseases and HIV/AIDS, and \r\ndamages the social fabric, leading to unsafe \r\ncommunities. Ultimately, violence slows economic and \r\nsocial development in those countries that can least \r\nafford it. However, scientific evidence amassed in \r\nrecent years clearly demonstrates that violence and its \r\nconsequences can be successfully prevented. But, at \r\npresent, an integrated approach to violence prevention \r\nis lacking. \r\n An attempt to define a regional response to the \r\nproblem was made at a recent two-day regional \r\nA/64/PV.9  \r\n \r\n09-52586 28 \r\n \r\nsymposium, held on 22 and 23 June 2009 in Saint Kitts \r\nand Nevis, on the theme “Confronting the challenges \r\nof youth crime and violence: Defining a multisectoral \r\nresponse”. We would like to call upon Member States \r\nto join us today in submitting a draft resolution in \r\nsupport of an integrated approach and multisectoral \r\nresponse to violence prevention, which we would wish \r\nto place on the agenda of the sixty-fifth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n My Government strongly condemns all forms of \r\nviolence, including transnational organized crime and \r\nterrorism. And while we commend the United Nations \r\nfor its continued assistance to Member States in our \r\ncrime-fighting efforts, we urge that it extend its support \r\nby reopening, in the spirit of developing an effective \r\nmultilateral approach, the United Nations Office on \r\nDrugs and Crime regional office in the Caribbean. \r\n The challenges we must meet are vast. The \r\nnon-proliferation of nuclear weapons today and a \r\nworld free of nuclear weapons tomorrow should be the \r\ngoals of us all. \r\n Within the Pan-Caribbean Partnership, we \r\ncontinue to develop and expand regional responses to \r\nthe HIV/AIDS epidemic. The problems posed by the \r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic are a real and growing threat, not \r\nonly in terms of loss of life and livelihood, but also to \r\nthe extent that the disease eliminates the most \r\nproductive groups in our society and demands outlays \r\nof capital that would otherwise be allocated to \r\neconomic and social development. The Caribbean \r\nCommunity, through the Pan-Caribbean Partnership, \r\nhas made gains in tackling the medical aspects of the \r\ndisease. \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n But we need to do much more to fight stigma and \r\ndiscrimination and to increase access to inexpensive \r\nantiretroviral drugs and treatment for those infected \r\nwith the disease. With the help of the international \r\ncommunity, we can reconcile the objective need of \r\npharmaceutical companies to receive proper \r\ncompensation for their research, development and \r\ninvestment without prejudice to those who are in \r\nurgent need of care and without politicizing the issue. \r\n We, too, are very concerned about the challenges \r\nthat non-communicable chronic diseases pose to small \r\ncountries like ours and to mankind in general. In this \r\nregard, we join with the Prime Minister of Trinidad and \r\nTobago in calling on the United Nations to convene at \r\nthe earliest opportunity a special summit on \r\nnon-communicable chronic disease. \r\n In conclusion, Mr. President, my Government \r\napplauds your initiative to pursue effective responses \r\nto global crises and strengthen multilateralism. For \r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis, multilateralism is a sine qua non \r\nand the only effective approach to lasting peace, \r\neffective security and sustainable development. We \r\nhave seen the fallout from unilateral action. Many of us \r\nhave paid the price for the decisions and actions made \r\nin isolation by a few. \r\n I emphasize that it is the fundamental right of all \r\nhumankind to choose its own destiny. At the same \r\ntime, we have a collective duty to act responsibly and \r\nto work in the interest of the common good. That is the \r\npremise of multilateralism. That is the promise of my \r\nGovernment, and, Mr. President, my delegation stands \r\nprepared and willing to support you in this cause. \r\n I recall that it was Hubert H. Humphrey, former \r\nVice-President of the United States of America, who \r\nfelt it necessary to emphasize to individuals, like those \r\nof us in this Hall today, our responsibility to ensure \r\nthat the United Nations is a force for verifiable, \r\nconstructive change in the world. In reminding us and \r\nthose who will come after us of what is expected of us, \r\nhe said:  \r\n “The heroes of the world community are not \r\nthose who withdraw when difficulties ensue, not \r\nthose who can envision neither the prospect of \r\nsuccess nor the consequence of failure — but \r\nthose who stand the heat of battle, the fight for \r\nworld peace through the United Nations.” \r\n This we must do today and forever.  \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, Minister of National \r\nSecurity and Immigration, Minister of Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and Minister of Tourism, Sports and \r\nCulture of Saint Kitts and Nevis for the statement he \r\nhas just made. \r\n The Honourable Denzil Douglas, Prime Minister \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs, Minister of \r\nNational Security and Immigration, Minister of \r\nSustainable Development and Minister of \r\nTourism, Sports and Culture of Saint Kitts and \r\nNevis, was escorted from the rostrum. \r\n A/64/PV.9\r\n \r\n29 09-52586 \r\n \r\n  Address by The Right Honourable Pakalitha \r\nBethuel Mosisili, Prime Minister and Minister \r\nfor Defence and Public Service of the Kingdom \r\nof Lesotho \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Prime Minister and Minister for \r\nDefence and Public Service of the Kingdom of \r\nLesotho. \r\n The Right Honourable Pakalitha Bethuel \r\nMosisili, Prime Minister and Minister for \r\nDefence and Public Service of the Kingdom of \r\nLesotho, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Pakalitha Bethuel \r\nMosisili, Prime Minister and Minister for Defence and \r\nPublic Service of the Kingdom of Lesotho, and inviting \r\nhim to address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Mosisili (Lesotho): Mr. President, the theme \r\nthat you have chosen for this session of the General \r\nAssembly — “Effective responses to global crises: \r\nstrengthening multilateralism and dialogue among \r\ncivilizations for international peace, security and \r\ndevelopment” — is both timely and relevant.  \r\n We meet against the backdrop of some of the \r\nmost serious challenges mankind has confronted in a \r\nlong time. The financial and economic crisis, climate \r\nchange and issues of international peace and security \r\nare but some of these challenges. No other organization \r\nis better placed than the United Nations to find \r\nsolutions to them. \r\n In June, your predecessor, Mr. President, \r\nconvened a high-level Conference on the World \r\nFinancial and Economic Crisis. We all had the \r\nopportunity then to identify and agree on the causes \r\nand effects of and solutions to this crisis. I shall not \r\nrevisit the deliberations of that Conference. Suffice it \r\nto say that it seems obvious that Governments can no \r\nlonger abdicate their responsibility of oversight and \r\nregulation of the global financial systems to financial \r\ninstitutions. \r\n The least developed and developing countries \r\nhave been the hardest hit by the financial crisis. Their \r\nexports have been severely reduced and their capital \r\nflows choked. The impact of the crisis is felt in all \r\naspects of life, be it in the increase in unemployment, \r\nilliteracy or the incidence of HIV- and AIDS-related \r\ndeaths due to the unavailability or unaffordability of \r\ndrugs. \r\n Lesotho, as a small economy, is highly vulnerable \r\nto external shocks and is therefore one of those \r\nadversely affected by the financial crisis. Demand for \r\ntextile exports has dropped dramatically, resulting in \r\nunprecedented loss of livelihoods and erosion of the \r\ngains we had made in eradicating poverty. \r\n However, all is not lost. I note in this regard the \r\nefforts of the Group of Eight, which has pledged a \r\nstimulus package of $1.1 trillion, the major part of \r\nwhich will be made available to developing countries. \r\nMy concern is that this initiative seems to have stalled \r\nand it is unclear how the funds will be distributed. It \r\nwill be fair only if the disbursement is informed by the \r\nneeds of individual countries, and I hasten to add that \r\nthe disbursement should be free of quotas and \r\nconditions. While I remain optimistic that the pledge \r\nwill see the light of day, I appeal for the fulfilment of \r\ncommitments that have been made regarding overseas \r\ndevelopment aid. I further appeal for the requisite \r\npolitical will to complete the Doha Round of \r\nnegotiations as a matter of urgency. These negotiations \r\nare the anchor of our hope for the dawn of a fair and \r\nequitable international trade regime. \r\n I congratulate the Secretary-General on \r\nconvening the just-ended Summit on Climate Change, \r\nat which we were unanimous in our belief that the \r\nchallenges posed by climate change are beyond the \r\ncapacity of any individual country to deal with alone. \r\nResponse to the impact of climate change must be a top \r\npriority for the whole of mankind, for at stake here is \r\nthe preservation of the very elements responsible for \r\nthe sustenance of human life on our planet. \r\n Lesotho is hopeful that the Copenhagen \r\nConference will usher in a new global agreement that \r\nwill result in the reduction of greenhouse gas \r\nemissions. We must never forget that at the forefront of \r\nthose most affected by the impact of climate change \r\nare the poor and the innocent. Our call for the \r\nindustrialized nations to help improve developing \r\ncountries’ capacity for mitigation and adaptation is \r\ntherefore not misplaced. Those who are responsible for \r\ncausing pollution of the environment have the \r\nresponsibility to make cuts in harmful emissions and to \r\nhelp those adversely affected. We acknowledge that \r\nclimate change may not be our collective fault, but it is \r\nsurely our collective responsibility. \r\nA/64/PV.9  \r\n \r\n09-52586 30 \r\n \r\n Another challenge confronting us is that of \r\ninternational peace and security. This challenge is a \r\nmatter of utmost interest to my delegation, for it \r\nreminds Governments of their obligation to protect \r\ntheir peoples from mass atrocities, including genocide, \r\nethnic cleansing, war crimes and crimes against \r\nhumanity. I am referring here to the principle of the \r\nresponsibility to protect. \r\n The Rwanda genocide is still fresh in our minds. \r\nThough the wounds may have healed, the scars remain \r\npronounced and serve as a painful reminder of man’s \r\ninhumanity to man. They also serve as a sad reminder \r\nof how the international community can fail a people. \r\nBeyond Rwanda, and I dare say even post-Rwanda, we \r\nhave witnessed mass atrocities committed with \r\nimpunity against the most innocent and vulnerable \r\npopulations. And sadly, the Security Council, in whose \r\npurview the power to act is centralized, has failed to \r\nact, thereby incapacitating the international \r\ncommunity’s ability to act also. \r\n In our resolve never to fail any population again, \r\nwe adopted the principle of the responsibility to protect \r\nat our 2005 World Summit. This principle seeks to \r\nrestore the confidence of populations in the United \r\nNations system. In July, the General Assembly held a \r\ndebate on the Secretary-General’s report on \r\nimplementing the responsibility to protect (A/63/677). \r\nLesotho welcomes that balanced report, especially the \r\nproposed practical measures for its implementation. We \r\nview the report as a good basis for negotiations in the \r\nGeneral Assembly on how to implement the principle. \r\nIt is true that the scope of the principle is narrow and \r\nlimited to genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and \r\ncrimes against humanity. I would nonetheless \r\ndiscourage any reopening of the debates on paragraphs \r\n138 and 139 of the World Summit Outcome Document \r\n(resolution 60/1). \r\n I find a linkage between this principle and other \r\ncritical issues that continue to feature on our \r\ninternational agenda. Among these are reform of the \r\nUnited Nations, especially the Security Council, \r\ndisarmament and the International Criminal Court. \r\nNeedless to say, the principle of the responsibility to \r\nprotect is meaningful only if it is grounded in \r\nmultilateralism and collective action by the \r\ninternational community. The forums through which \r\nthe responsibility to protect may be achievable is the \r\nSecurity Council and, beyond that, the General \r\nAssembly. Unfortunately, the Council, as presently \r\ncomposed, is not capable of exercising effective \r\nleadership in this area. \r\n The Security Council reflects the situation that \r\nobtained 64 years ago. It is not a true reflection of the \r\ncurrent membership of the United Nations. Its \r\ncomposition is therefore irrelevant and undemocratic. \r\nFor all intents and purposes, the Council lacks \r\nlegitimacy. For as long as it remains undemocratic, it \r\nwill continue to fail the vulnerable and defenceless. It \r\nwill continue to use double standards and remain a tool \r\nof the foreign policies of certain States. The desired \r\nmultilateral path will continue to give way to the \r\nunilateral one. It is imperative, therefore, to hasten the \r\nUnited Nations reform process. The intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations that were held during the sixty-third \r\nsession of the General Assembly have advanced the \r\nreform process a step or two. However, more still \r\nneeds to be done and rather urgently. \r\n The United Nations was formed on the ashes of \r\nthe two World Wars. Its main purpose was and still is \r\nto save succeeding generations from the scourge of \r\nwar, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold \r\nmisery to mankind. But the continuing possession and \r\ndevelopment of nuclear weapons cast doubt on whether \r\nthis objective can indeed be realized. At a time when \r\nthe world is hungering for nuclear disarmament, why \r\nshould some countries be testing, modernizing and \r\nproducing new generations of nuclear weapons? \r\n It is our obligation as the international \r\ncommunity to strive for a world free of nuclear \r\nweapons. We remain disappointed in those countries \r\nthat are engaged in the testing of nuclear weapons. We \r\nmust, however, reiterate the right of every country to \r\nthe development and use of nuclear technology for \r\npeaceful purposes. The peaceful use of nuclear \r\ntechnology can be beneficial to all mankind. \r\n We are delighted that the third session of the \r\nPreparatory Committee for the 2010 Review \r\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons has adopted the \r\nagenda for the 2010 Review Conference. This historic \r\nachievement strengthens our optimism that our \r\ncommitment to the disarmament process will gain \r\nrenewed momentum and enthusiasm. \r\n In 1998, the Statute establishing the International \r\nCriminal Court was adopted in Rome. The Court is, \r\ninter alia, an answer to war crimes and crimes against \r\nhumanity. It safeguards the rule of law in the \r\n A/64/PV.9\r\n \r\n31 09-52586 \r\n \r\ninternational arena and is therefore well placed to \r\ncomplement the implementation of the principle of the \r\nresponsibility to protect. Consequently, we should, as \r\nthe international community, unconditionally extend \r\nour support to the Court. We must preserve its integrity \r\nand independence. There should be no State or organ of \r\nthe United Nations that interferes with the Court’s \r\nprocesses. Most importantly, the Court must uphold the \r\nhighest standards of impartiality, integrity and fairness. \r\nLesotho supports the principle of universal jurisdiction. \r\nHowever, we reject selective application of that noble \r\nprinciple because it erodes its acceptability and \r\ncredibility. \r\n During the past year, we witnessed a resurgence \r\nof piracy off the coast of Somalia. This development \r\nhas had a negative impact on maritime security and \r\nsafety. There is a need for the international community \r\nto adopt a comprehensive approach to tackling the \r\nphenomenon of piracy off the coast of Somalia and \r\nbeyond. In this regard, Lesotho joins the voices of the \r\nheads of State and Government of the African Union in \r\ncalling for the convening of an international conference \r\nto discuss the adoption of an international convention \r\non the phenomenon of maritime piracy and to eradicate \r\nits underlying causes. \r\n I would be remiss not to refer to the plight of the \r\npeoples of the State of Palestine, the Saharan Arab \r\nDemocratic Republic and the Republic of Cuba. These \r\nare peoples who continue to experience untold \r\nsuffering, ranging from war to political, economic and \r\nsocial injustices. We call on Israel to cease all \r\nsettlement activities, including the so-called natural \r\ngrowth in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. By the \r\nsame token, we call on both sides to cease all acts of \r\nhostility and attacks. In particular, Palestine must halt \r\nthe indiscriminate launching of rockets on Israeli \r\ncivilians, while Israel must desist from the use of \r\ndisproportionate force against Palestinian civilians.  \r\n We welcome the intensified efforts of the Quartet, \r\nthe Arab League and other members involved in \r\nbrokering peace in the Middle East. We are mindful of \r\nthe fact that the quest for peace in the Middle East \r\nshould be the responsibility of all of us. We express our \r\nsolidarity with the people of Palestine. At the same \r\ntime, we reiterate the inviolability and, indeed, the \r\nright to exist of the State of Israel. \r\n The struggle of the Saharan people is a struggle \r\nfor self-determination based on the principles of \r\ndecolonization and sovereignty of nations. Both the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council have \r\nrecognized the inalienable rights of the Saharan people \r\nto self-determination and independence. We urge the \r\nSaharan Arab Democratic Republic and the Kingdom \r\nof Morocco to continue with their negotiations on an \r\nequal footing and without any conditions. The \r\naspirations of the Saharan people to self-determination \r\nmust take paramount priority in these negotiations. \r\n We also hope that the positive signals of \r\nengagement between the Republic of Cuba and the \r\nUnited States of America will bring an end to the \r\nunfortunate financial and economic embargo imposed \r\non the Republic of Cuba. Lesotho shall continue to \r\nsupport the call for the lifting of the economic embargo \r\nagainst the people of Cuba as a matter of principle and \r\nof urgency. \r\n I wish to conclude by saying that no obstacle can \r\nbeat the might of the United Nations. We must continue \r\nto pursue and indeed to cherish the purposes that have \r\nbrought us together. The responsibility to secure the \r\nfuture of mankind relies heavily on our ability to use a \r\ncollective approach to resolving the challenges of the \r\nworld. We cannot ignore our responsibility to build a \r\nbetter and more united world, for the future \r\ngenerations. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Defence and Public Service of the \r\nKingdom of Lesotho for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n The Right Honourable Pakalitha Bethuel \r\nMosisili, Prime Minister and Minister for \r\nDefence and Public Service of the Kingdom of \r\nLesotho, was escorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by The Right Honourable Madhav \r\nKumar Nepal, Prime Minister of the Federal \r\nDemocratic Republic of Nepal \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Prime Minister of the Federal \r\nDemocratic Republic of Nepal. \r\n The Right Honourable Madhav Kumar Nepal, \r\nPrime Minister of the Federal Democratic \r\nRepublic of Nepal, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Madhav Kumar Nepal, \r\nA/64/PV.9  \r\n \r\n09-52586 32 \r\n \r\nPrime Minister of the Federal Democratic Republic of \r\nNepal, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Mr. Nepal (Nepal): I would like to begin by \r\nextending my warm congratulations to you, Sir, on \r\nyour election to the presidency of the Assembly at its \r\ncurrent session. As an incumbent Vice-President, I \r\nassure you of my delegation’s full cooperation in the \r\ndischarge of your responsibilities. I also take this \r\nopportunity to place on record our appreciation for \r\nMr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann, the outgoing President, \r\nfor his exemplary leadership during the sixty-third \r\nsession.  \r\n I thank the Secretary-General for his \r\ncomprehensive report on the work of the Organization \r\n(A/64/1). We appreciate his efficient stewardship on \r\nvarious issues of critical global significance and on the \r\nreform of the United Nations. He also deserves our \r\nthanks for supporting the nationally driven peace \r\nprocess of Nepal. \r\n I bring greetings and good wishes from the \r\npeople and Government of Nepal, a country that \r\nexpresses unswerving commitment to the ideals of the \r\nUnited Nations. We look to the Organization as a true \r\nadvocate and upholder of the universal values of peace, \r\njustice, equality, freedom and human dignity. As was \r\nso aptly recognized in the Millennium Declaration \r\n(resolution 55/2), the United Nations is indeed the \r\nindispensable common house of the entire human \r\nfamily. A more efficient and stronger United Nations is \r\nobviously in the interest of us all. \r\n Sovereign equality, territorial integrity, political \r\nindependence, non-interference and the peaceful \r\nsettlement of international disputes have become the \r\nbedrock of inter-State relations. These principles, \r\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter more than six \r\ndecades ago, represent the highest ideals of \r\ncontemporary international relations. They have stood \r\nthe test of time and proved to be timeless and \r\nuniversal. They provide the basis for the smooth and \r\nharmonious conduct of international relations among \r\nStates that are sovereign, independent and \r\ninterconnected. As we march towards increasing \r\ninterdependence through globalization, these well-\r\nestablished principles and norms of inter-State \r\nrelations assume even greater relevance for us. \r\n History stands testimony to the fact that human \r\ncivilization has no linear progression. We live in \r\nchanging times. Today, the nature, speed and scope of \r\nsuch changes are astounding. New opportunities and \r\nunforeseen challenges always await us along our way \r\nto peace, progress and prosperity. We often find \r\nourselves at the crossroads of stability and peace, on \r\nthe one hand, and conflict and domination, on the \r\nother. It is only with principled stands and \r\ndetermination that we have moved towards peace and \r\ndevelopment throughout history. Whenever we have \r\ndigressed from these principles, perils and catastrophes \r\nhave visited us. International solidarity and a true spirit \r\nof global partnership are therefore indispensable, and \r\nmultilateralism offers the best means and opportunity \r\nto address the global problems of our times. \r\n Nepal is currently in the midst of a great political \r\ntransition. With the signing of the Comprehensive \r\nPeace Accord in November 2006, our decade-long \r\narmed conflict ended and a nationally driven peace \r\nprocess is now in progress. The Constituent Assembly, \r\nconsisting of 601 members elected through a mixed-\r\nproportional system, has been writing a new, \r\ndemocratic and republican constitution. It is one of the \r\nmost inclusive and representative elected bodies in the \r\nhistory of Nepal. Almost one third of the Constituent \r\nAssembly members are women, and a fair number \r\nrepresent the country’s various ethnic minorities. \r\nThematic committees on various aspects of the new \r\nconstitution have been preparing their respective \r\nreports following a process of broad consultations with \r\nthe Nepali people. We are determined to take the peace \r\nprocess to a positive and meaningful conclusion, as \r\nenvisaged in the Comprehensive Peace Accord, by \r\nbuilding consensus among the political parties through \r\ndialogue and consultations. \r\n We are a multi-ethnic, multilingual and \r\nmultireligious country. As we have opted for a Federal \r\nDemocratic Republic, we are now restructuring the \r\nState by organizing it into federal units, as desired by \r\nthe people of Nepal. We believe democracy is more \r\nmeaningful when it is closer to the people. We believe \r\nthat reconfiguring the State into federal units is one \r\nsuch significant step towards deepening the roots of \r\ndemocracy in our country. \r\n My Government has four major tasks at hand: \r\ntaking the peace process to its positive and meaningful \r\nconclusion, writing a new democratic constitution \r\nthrough the Constituent Assembly within the stipulated \r\ntime frame, speeding up the country’s economic \r\ndevelopment to lift it up from poverty, and meeting the \r\n A/64/PV.9\r\n \r\n33 09-52586 \r\n \r\nrising expectations of our people in a new democratic \r\nenvironment. We have been doing our best to \r\naccomplish these tasks through dialogue, consultations \r\nand consensus among the country’s major political \r\nparties. \r\n Looking at the overall progress we have made \r\nover the past three years, there is reason to be forward-\r\nlooking and optimistic about Nepal’s peace process. \r\nWe have come a long way in terms of our transition \r\nfrom the decade-long violent conflict. As in every \r\npost-conflict situation, there have been ups and downs \r\nalong the way. Managing the legacy of the violent past \r\nwith justice and reconciliation and mainstreaming all \r\nthe forces involved into a democratic order are the \r\nmajor challenges before us. \r\n We are for democratic order, peace and stability. \r\nThere is no place either for extremism or for permanent \r\ninstability in Nepal. The Government is doing its best \r\nto ensure moderation in order to institutionalize \r\ndemocratic rules and ideals and to leave conflict \r\npermanently behind. I am sure that there is a common \r\nunderstanding on this issue within the country and \r\namong our friends in the international community. The \r\ndesire to avoid a relapse into conflict and to fulfil the \r\nhopes and aspirations of the people has constantly \r\nprodded us to move forward with dialogue, consensus \r\nand unity of purpose. We know that we still have far to \r\ngo, and we are determined to reach our destination — a \r\npeaceful, prosperous and stable Nepal. \r\n In achieving that, we know we must be alert to \r\nthe desire of our people for both freedom and \r\ndevelopment. Freedom rings hollow when there is no \r\ndevelopment. Development loses its soul if it is not \r\naccompanied by freedom. These are our twin goals, \r\nand my Government is committed to pursuing them \r\nwith clear vision and commitment. \r\n I am confident that we will have the continuous \r\nsupport and cooperation of the international \r\ncommunity in achieving these goals. Needless to say, \r\nany failure to address the rising expectations of our \r\npeople and to provide peace dividends to those affected \r\nby the conflict at the grass-roots level, may have \r\nunintended consequences that challenge the peace and \r\ndemocratization processes in Nepal and elsewhere. \r\nTherefore, to promote the positive conclusion of the \r\npeace process and to institutionalize our hard-won \r\ndemocracy, the Nepali people deserve support for \r\nrehabilitation, compensation and reconstruction arising \r\nfrom the damage that occurred during the conflict. I \r\nrequest special support from development partners in \r\naddressing our post-conflict development challenges. \r\n We are fully committed to the protection and \r\npromotion of human rights. Since the end of the \r\ndecade-long armed conflict and the beginning of the \r\npeace process in 2006, the human rights situation in the \r\ncountry has improved significantly. The Government is \r\ndetermined to establish a truth and reconciliation \r\ncommission and a disappearance commission as part of \r\nensuring transitional justice and restoring social \r\nharmony and peace. We already have our National \r\nHuman Rights Commission, which is a constitutional \r\nbody with full autonomy in its area of work. \r\n We appreciate the continued support of the \r\nUnited Nations to Nepal’s ongoing peace process \r\nthrough the United Nations Mission in Nepal. We are \r\ndetermined to bring the peace process to a positive and \r\nmeaningful conclusion as early as possible. As we \r\nourselves are now undergoing a post-conflict situation, \r\nwe understand the importance of peacebuilding in \r\npost-conflict societies. Nepal is pleased to contribute to \r\nthe work of the Peacebuilding Commission as a new \r\nmember of its Organizational Committee starting this \r\nyear. We understand that a review of the activities of \r\nthe Commission is slated for 2010. That would provide \r\nan opportunity to assess its activities and also to \r\nexplore ways to make peacebuilding a more effective \r\nand innovative mechanism. \r\n Whether it concerns issues of peace, conflict, \r\nterrorism, climate change, the financial crisis, food \r\nsecurity, development challenges or other vulnerabilities, \r\nwe are so interconnected that no country can escape \r\ntheir impacts. The global village has become a palpable \r\nreality before us. Global problems thus require global \r\nsolutions. In that context, I welcome the selection of \r\nthe theme “Effective responses to global crises: \r\nstrengthening multilateralism and dialogue among \r\ncivilizations for international peace, security and \r\ndevelopment” for this year’s general debate. \r\n The economic and financial crisis that swept the \r\nworld within a relatively short span of time is the most \r\nrecent reminder of the vulnerability inherent in the \r\nprocess of globalization and its global implications. If \r\nwe look around, we will see that climate change is \r\nanother issue staring at us. Regional conflicts are yet \r\nanother global issue of concern to us all. \r\nA/64/PV.9  \r\n \r\n09-52586 34 \r\n \r\n The least developed countries (LDCs) and \r\nlandlocked developing countries, among others, are the \r\nmost vulnerable with regard to all those issues. Their \r\nspecial needs call for more specific and an enhanced \r\nlevel of international support in terms of their concerns \r\nand challenges. At the same time, the outcome \r\ndocument of the United Nations Conference on the \r\nWorld Financial and Economic Crisis and its Impact on \r\nDevelopment (resolution 63/303, annex), held here in \r\nNew York in June this year, should be implemented in \r\nall earnestness. We also stress the early implementation \r\nof the outcome document of the International \r\nConference on Financing for Development (resolution \r\n63/239, annex), held in Doha last year. \r\n While the global financial and economic crisis \r\nwreaked havoc on the already fragile economic health \r\nof the least developed countries, that unanticipated \r\nshock has also brought into sharper relief the urgent \r\nneed for an enhanced level of understanding, resources \r\nand a policy space for the developing countries to \r\nmitigate its impact and to avoid its recurrence. \r\n The global crises have posed a serious challenge \r\nto the fight against poverty in the LDCs. The \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) can still be \r\nachieved if all of us in the international community act \r\ntogether, and act urgently. The proposed review of \r\nprogress in the implementation of the MDGs should \r\nprovide us a renewed opportunity to reinvigorate our \r\ndevelopment agenda. We urge the developed countries \r\nnot to let the economic and financial crisis become an \r\nexcuse for curtailing their aid commitments with \r\nregard to the MDGs and other internationally agreed \r\ndevelopment agendas. \r\n Indeed, as recognized at the Group of 20 Summit \r\nin London earlier this year and as so consistently \r\nemphasized by our Secretary-General, the people of \r\ndeveloping countries, especially the LDCs, need their \r\nown international financial rescue package to ensure \r\nthat we do not backtrack on programmes towards \r\nachievement of the MDGs. \r\n Nepal is a country with young mountains and a \r\nfragile ecosystem. Global warming, one of the most \r\nruthless signs of climate change, has led to \r\nunprecedented melting of the Himalayan snow. Nepal \r\nexperienced an annual temperature increase of \r\n0.06  Celsius degrees between 1977 and 2000. With \r\nthat, the threat of glacial lake outbursts has increased. \r\nFlash floods have become more frequent and more \r\ndestructive. Delayed and insufficient rainfall has \r\naffected crop production. The poorest of the poor \r\nfarmers have suffered the worst from all those effects. \r\nAgriculture, health, livelihoods and infrastructure are \r\nall being affected by them. \r\n Nepal recently hosted a high-level regional \r\nconference on climate change focusing on the \r\nHimalayan region in order to highlight the seriousness \r\nof the problem of global warming and its impacts on \r\nthe Himalayan range. The unprecedented snow melt in \r\nthe Himalayas could jeopardize the lives and \r\nlivelihoods of over 700 million people downstream and \r\nin the coastal regions. The conference produced a \r\n10-point understanding that emphasizes, among other \r\nfactors, the need to put into practice the principles of \r\ncommon but differentiated responsibilities and the \r\nrespective capabilities and historical responsibility of \r\nthe developed countries, as envisaged in the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, as \r\nwell as a financing mechanism on adaptation and \r\ntransfer of technologies to sufficiently meet the urgent \r\nand immediate financial needs of the region in a \r\npredictable, easy and direct manner. \r\n Concrete actions that match the level of the threat \r\nare needed. The other day, we had a fruitful discussion \r\nat the Summit on Climate Change, convened by the \r\nSecretary-General. While I thank the Secretary-General \r\nfor that important initiative, I urge all to continue that \r\nspirit of positive thinking and to work together to \r\nconverge all our efforts to find a just and effective \r\nsolution to the ever-increasing problem of climate \r\nchange. \r\n The Copenhagen Climate Change Conference \r\nshould be able to seal the deal and work out a new \r\nglobal compact to address the problem of climate \r\nchange beyond 2012 in keeping with the principle of \r\ncommon but differentiated responsibilities, with \r\nspecial consideration given to the characteristics, \r\nvulnerabilities and weaknesses of the least developed \r\nand other developing countries. \r\n The LDCs have particular vulnerabilities \r\nassociated with their structural constraints, systemic \r\ndeficiencies and historical socio-economic factors. The \r\nbottom half billion people face the daunting task of \r\nimproving their living standards despite persistent \r\nefforts and commitment. Their plight is further \r\nexacerbated by the global problems that affect them \r\ndisproportionately because they do not have cushions \r\n A/64/PV.9\r\n \r\n35 09-52586 \r\n \r\nor alternatives. Therefore, their plight deserves special \r\nconsideration by the international community. \r\n As we prepare for the fourth United Nations \r\nConference on the Least Developed Countries, we need \r\nto seriously consider the implementation status of the \r\nBrussels Programme of Action for the Least Developed \r\nCountries for the Decade 2001-2010, and endeavour to \r\ntackle all existing obstacles in our way through a \r\ncommitted and collaborative partnership. We would \r\nalso emphasize the need for full implementation of the \r\nAlmaty Programme of Action for landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries. \r\n Nuclear non-proliferation, nuclear disarmament \r\nand the proliferation of small arms are matters of \r\nglobal concern. We welcome Security Council \r\nresolution 1887 (2009), adopted on 24 September 2009, \r\nwhich seeks to contain proliferation, ban nuclear tests \r\nand bring about further cuts in nuclear weapons.  \r\n Disarmament being a comprehensive issue, we \r\nare of the view that promoting regional discourse on \r\ndisarmament would help build confidence and prepare \r\nthe groundwork necessary for realizing our eventual \r\ngoal of general and complete disarmament. In this \r\ncontext, we see an important role for the United \r\nNations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in \r\nAsia and the Pacific, which has been operating from \r\nKathmandu since last year. We urge Member States to \r\nbe generous in extending financial support to the \r\nCentre for conducting its programmes and activities. \r\n In spite of sustained and concerted efforts on the \r\npart of the international community, terrorism \r\ncontinues to pose a serious threat to international peace \r\nand security. Nepal strongly condemns terrorism in all \r\nits forms and calls for early conclusion of a \r\ncomprehensive convention against terrorism. We \r\nreiterate our commitment to combating international \r\nterrorism, including through the implementation of the \r\nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy (see resolution \r\n60/288) adopted on 8 September 2006 and of various \r\nSecurity Council resolutions, such as resolutions 1373 \r\n(2001) and 1540 (2004). \r\n After more than 60 years, there is no denying that \r\nthe United Nations needs institutional reform and \r\nreinvigoration to maintain continued relevance and \r\neffectiveness. In this context, we hope that the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations started by the General \r\nAssembly can lead to significant reform of the United \r\nNations system — including the Security Council, by \r\nadding new members in a fair and equitable manner in \r\nsuch a way as to reflect the current realities of the \r\ncontemporary world. \r\n In an increasingly globalized and interconnected \r\nworld, the issue of migrant workers has become \r\nprominent. Remittances have become one of the major \r\nsources of earned foreign currency for almost all the \r\nleast developed and other developing countries. We \r\ntherefore urge the international community to adopt a \r\ncomprehensive approach and policy towards migration, \r\nincluding regarding protection of the rights of migrant \r\nworkers in the face of the current economic crisis. \r\n We are concerned about the continued deadlock \r\nin the World Trade Organization’s Doha Development \r\nAgenda negotiations, as well as about the new waves \r\nof protectionism that are built into the inward-looking \r\nstimulus packages being adopted to deal with the \r\nglobal financial and economic crisis. Given the \r\nexceptional vulnerabilities of the least developed and \r\nlandlocked developing countries, developed countries, \r\nin accordance with international compacts and \r\ncommitments such as the 2002 Monterrey Consensus, \r\nshould immediately make available to them duty-free \r\nentry for their exports, debt-relief packages and other \r\ncapacity-building measures. Such resources are very \r\nimportant to the fight against poverty, hunger, illiteracy \r\nand disease in all the least developed countries, \r\nparticularly those affected by conflict, which encounter \r\nhuge development challenges in post-conflict recovery. \r\n While peacekeeping remains one of the core \r\nactivities of the United Nations, its multidimensional \r\nnature has posed new managerial and logistical \r\nchallenges in recent years. Peacekeeping evolved out \r\nof necessity, and it has to be adapted to match the new \r\nand emerging challenges inherent in today’s \r\nincreasingly complex peacekeeping missions. In this \r\ncontext, we appreciate the Secretariat’s “New Horizon” \r\nnon-paper, aimed at engaging and ensuring broader \r\nsupport from Member States and troop-contributing \r\ncountries. Let me recall here that Nepal has been one \r\nof the longest-standing continuing partners in United \r\nNations peacekeeping missions. Today, we are the fifth \r\nlargest troop-contributing country. Our commitment to \r\ninternational peace remains as strong as ever, and our \r\nsupport for the United Nations in its peacekeeping \r\nactivities will continue unabated. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to reiterate Nepal’s \r\nabiding faith in the principles and purposes of the \r\nA/64/PV.9  \r\n \r\n09-52586 36 \r\n \r\nUnited Nations Charter. We stress the need for \r\nintroducing timely reforms in the United Nations and \r\nits operational mechanisms, in order to enhance the \r\nOrganization’s role and relevance in the emerging new \r\nglobal order of the twenty-first century. Nepal is \r\nalways willing to contribute in whatever ways it can to \r\nthe attainment of the noble objectives of international \r\npeace, security, development and prosperity for all. \r\n As a least developed country, engaged in a peace \r\nprocess and in rebuilding post-conflict, Nepal has \r\nmany challenges to face. My Government is making \r\nevery effort to meet these challenges and appreciates \r\nthe support extended by the United Nations. At the \r\nsame time, we would like the international community \r\nto be more generous in assisting us in our national \r\nendeavour to institutionalize peace and democracy, \r\nrebuild our infrastructure and enhance our economic \r\ngrowth. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nFederal Democratic Republic of Nepal for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n The Right Honourable Madhav Kumar Nepal, \r\nPrime Minister of the Federal Democratic \r\nRepublic of Nepal, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by The Honourable Feleti Vaka’uta \r\nSevele, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Tonga \r\n \r\n The President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of \r\nTonga. \r\n The Honourable Feleti Vaka’uta Sevele, Prime \r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Tonga, was escorted \r\nto the rostrum. \r\n The President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Feleti Vaka’uta Sevele, \r\nPrime Minister of the Kingdom of Tonga, and inviting \r\nhim to address the Assembly. \r\n Mr. Sevele (Tonga): Like previous speakers, I \r\noffer you, Sir, my warmest congratulations on your \r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly for \r\nthis session. I also wish to pay tribute to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his excellent report on the work of the \r\nOrganization (A/64/1) and for his continuing \r\nleadership during these unprecedented and challenging \r\ntimes. A testament to the Secretary-General’s \r\nleadership has been his persistent efforts to convene \r\nthe Summit on Climate Change held earlier this week. \r\nFor those of us who are also members of the Alliance \r\nof Small Island States, our own Summit, held \r\nimmediately beforehand, was a timely exercise in \r\nfocusing on the critical issues at stake in the run-up to \r\nthe Copenhagen Climate Change Conference to be held \r\nin December. \r\n Climate change has taken its rightful place at the \r\nforefront of many of the statements we have heard this \r\nweek. In the case of small island developing States like \r\nours, we all need to reach beyond our narrow national \r\ninterests and embrace our collective responsibility to \r\none another as nation States and to those most \r\nvulnerable and least able to address the adverse effects \r\nof climate change. At the Pacific Islands Forum, the \r\nissue of climate change and the type of collective effort \r\nit requires has been at the forefront of the meetings of \r\nPacific leaders, most recently in Cairns under the \r\nchairmanship of Prime Minister Kevin Rudd of \r\nAustralia. Such efforts resulted, earlier this year, in the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s adoption by consensus of \r\nresolution 63/281, on climate change and its security \r\nimplications. \r\n It has been heartening to hear in this Hall words \r\nof action — a determination to move away from the \r\nrhetoric of climate change to the reality of action: \r\naction to mitigate the effects of climate change and \r\naction to stop the waste of our energy resources. But \r\nthe words of Presidents and Prime Ministers are not \r\nenough. They must be matched by action. Our \r\ndetermination and our understanding of the truth of \r\nclimate change must be propelled by honest efforts to \r\nmitigate and change the wasteful energy habits of a \r\nlifetime into the productive energy habits of the future. \r\n The lessons of the past year have reinforced our \r\nsupport for reform of the international financial \r\ninstitutions. In particular, we look forward to the \r\noutcome of the just-concluded meeting of the Group of \r\n20 in Pittsburgh as further crucial and concerted action \r\nfollowing the measures taken in Washington and \r\nLondon. \r\n Despite the uncertain global economic and \r\nfinancial climate, we remain committed to making \r\nfurther progress in achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), which remain a core \r\ncomponent of our national development planning. \r\nMuch of that progress has been reliant on our own \r\n A/64/PV.9\r\n \r\n37 09-52586 \r\n \r\ndomestic efforts, but it has also been assisted by our \r\ndevelopment partners. In that regard, we support the \r\nSecretary-General’s convening of a special summit on \r\nthe MDGs in 2010 as a final push towards 2015. \r\nFurther, the high-level review of the Mauritius Strategy \r\nfor the Further Implementation of the Programme of \r\nAction for the Sustainable Development of Small \r\nIsland Developing States, to be carried out the same \r\nyear, offers us, as small island developing States, a \r\nfresh opportunity to take stock of progress and areas \r\nfor improvement. We also welcome the renewed \r\ninterest and engagement of the United States of \r\nAmerica regarding the Pacific islands. \r\n Earlier this year, my country, the Kingdom of \r\nTonga, in compliance with its obligations under the \r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, \r\nlodged a partial submission for the consideration of the \r\nCommission on the Outer Limits of the Continental \r\nShelf. This was a significant exercise made possible \r\nthrough our own efforts, with the technical assistance \r\nof organizations such as the Commonwealth \r\nSecretariat. As we are an island nation, the living \r\nmarine resources of our maritime zones and the \r\npotential of non-living ones remain critical to our \r\nfuture.  \r\n We continue to follow the meandering course of \r\nthe discussions on reform of the Security Council. We \r\nmaintain our support for such reform and hold the view \r\nthat there should be an expansion in both the \r\npermanent and the non-permanent membership \r\ncategories. \r\n Since 100 per cent of our power generation is \r\nfuelled by imported fossil fuels, our economic potential \r\nhas been adversely affected by rising fuel prices, which \r\nhas forced us to investigate feasible renewable sources \r\nof energy. We thus have set the target of achieving \r\n50  per cent of our electricity generation utilizing \r\nrenewable energy sources by the year 2012. \r\n We have reviewed donor funding provided by our \r\ndevelopment partners to see how best we could achieve \r\nthat ambitious goal and also fulfil our wish to reduce \r\ngreenhouse gas emissions. At the conclusion of the \r\nregional Pacific Energy Ministers Meeting hosted in \r\nTonga earlier this year, we discussed those issues with \r\nour development partners. It very quickly became \r\napparent that a new model for doing business was \r\nneeded. And so it was that the concept for the Tonga \r\nRenewable Energy Road Map was born. \r\n The development partners all agreed to \r\ncollaborate, under the coordination of the World Bank, \r\nto assess the current infrastructure of on-grid and \r\noff-grid electrification throughout the Kingdom. The \r\nWorld Bank, the European Union, the Asian \r\nDevelopment Bank, Australia, New Zealand and Japan \r\nreadily accepted this opportunity to actively participate \r\nin the development of our Energy Road Map. Those \r\nefforts were recently boosted by strong support from \r\nthe Government of the United Arab Emirates and the \r\nInternational Renewable Energy Agency, which was \r\nreaffirmed at bilateral meetings held in New York this \r\nweek. \r\n Tonga’s cultural and constitutional roots are \r\ninnately enduring. We are proud of our 134-year-old \r\nwritten Constitution, which is one of the oldest in the \r\nworld and is still in force. Our Constitution enshrined \r\nbasic human rights and freedoms that today are the \r\nsubject of international treaties. The Tongan way of life \r\nis not based solely on the rights, responsibilities, \r\nfreedoms and obligations of the individual, but \r\nemphasizes rights, responsibilities, freedoms and \r\nobligations attaching to the extended family and the \r\nwhole community. While the values underlying human \r\nrights may be expressed differently from Tongan \r\ncustomary and traditional values, and while both \r\nreflect similar aspirations, Tonga’s strength lies in the \r\nbinding links of collective group values and individual \r\nobligations and responsibilities. \r\n Our parliament recently considered ratification of \r\nthe Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of \r\nDiscrimination against Women (CEDAW). Parliament \r\nvoted not to ratify CEDAW, because to do so would \r\nconflict with the cultural and social heritage that makes \r\nup the unique Tongan way of life. We take the \r\nratification of international treaties very seriously. We \r\ndid not want to ratify CEDAW as a matter of \r\ninternational convenience. We would rather be judged \r\nby our actions to empower women than by a \r\nratification of convenience. And we make no apologies \r\nfor our stance. We admit that there are issues to be \r\naddressed. But, rather than ratify CEDAW, we prefer to \r\naddress those specific areas of concern to women in \r\nour own way. We maintain that our women are among \r\nthe most highly cherished, elevated and respected in \r\nthe world. \r\n Finally, this month marks the tenth anniversary of \r\nTonga’s admission as a Member of the United Nations. \r\nWe reaffirm the rights and responsibilities bestowed \r\nA/64/PV.9  \r\n \r\n09-52586 38 \r\n \r\nupon us by the United Nations Charter, and we pledge \r\nto continue to participate constructively in addressing \r\nour common challenges. Those challenges will be \r\novercome by our action. Given that the United Nations \r\nis the forum for united action and given the \r\ncommitments made by leaders to such action, we may \r\njust awake to the fact that it is the good in the world, \r\nnot the evil, that surpasses all explanation. \r\n The President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nKingdom of Tonga for the statement he has just made. \r\n The Honourable Feleti Vaka’uta Sevele, Prime \r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Tonga, was escorted \r\nfrom the rostrum. \r\n The President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Thongloun Sisoulith, Deputy Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Lao People’s \r\nDemocratic Republic. \r\n Mr. Sisoulith (Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic) (spoke in Lao; English interpretation \r\nprovided by the delegation): At the outset, on behalf of \r\nthe Lao delegation, I would like to congratulate you, \r\nMr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, on your election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth \r\nsession. I trust that, under your able presidency, our \r\nsession will be guided to a successful outcome. Let me \r\nalso take this opportunity to express our deepest \r\nappreciation to His Excellency Mr. Miguel d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann, who presided over the sixty-third session \r\nwith dedication and distinction. By the same token, I \r\nconvey our great appreciation to Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon for his leadership and his commitment to \r\nthe work of the Organization at a time when our world \r\nis facing numerous grave challenges. \r\n In recent years, the international situation has \r\nundergone rapid changes and faced various challenges. \r\nThe United Nations, a unique world body, has been \r\nplaying an increasingly important role in maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security and promoting the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes and international \r\ncooperation for development. In this rapidly changing \r\nworld, it is our common duty and responsibility as \r\nMembers of the United Nations to ensure that the \r\nOrganization carry out its mandate effectively. To this \r\nend, United Nations reform is crucial and should be \r\ncomprehensive, transparent and balanced, while the \r\nOrganization should maintain its intergovernmental, \r\nuniversal and democratic character, consistent with the \r\nCharter. \r\n The revitalization of the General Assembly, \r\nreform of the Security Council and the strengthening of \r\nthe Economic and Social Council and specialized \r\nagencies should be guided by the principles of \r\ndemocracy, transparency and accountability with a \r\nview to making this universal Organization a body that \r\ntruly represents the interests of all Member States and \r\nseeks their benefit. In this context, the Lao People’s \r\nDemocratic Republic welcomes the launching of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform and will continue to contribute to these \r\nimportant efforts in this new phase of the Security \r\nCouncil reform process. \r\n The ongoing impasse within the multilateral \r\ndisarmament machinery continues to undermine \r\ninternational peace and security. The existence of \r\nnuclear weapons remains a grave threat to the existence \r\nof all humankind. It is therefore vital to reaffirm the \r\nimportance of States honouring their nuclear \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation obligations. The \r\nupcoming 2010 Review Conference will be a great \r\nopportunity for the States parties to the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to demonstrate \r\nstrong political commitment by making a collective \r\neffort to resolve the current stalemate on the \r\nnon-proliferation and disarmament agenda. In this \r\nregard, it is encouraging that the third session of the \r\nPreparatory Committee for the 2010 Review \r\nConference successfully adopted the agenda and all \r\nsignificant procedural decisions, which will \r\nundoubtedly lay an important foundation for a \r\nproductive and successful Review Conference in 2010. \r\n In conjunction with arms reduction and nuclear \r\ndisarmament, the issue of explosive remnants of war, \r\nincluding cluster munitions and unexploded ordnance \r\n(UXO), continues to threaten and pose serious \r\nobstacles to socio-economic development and poverty \r\neradication efforts in more than 80 countries across the \r\nworld. Among these, the Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic is the most affected. The victims of cluster \r\nmunitions in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic — \r\nwhere approximately 300 victims have been recorded \r\nevery year for the 30 years since the war ended — \r\naccount for 50 per cent of the global total of cluster \r\nmunitions victims. This is due to the fact that 37 per \r\ncent of national territory remains contaminated by \r\nUXO. Enormous financial resources would be needed \r\n A/64/PV.9\r\n \r\n39 09-52586 \r\n \r\nto resolve this problem, and it would take a great \r\nlength of time to clear UXOs from those areas needed \r\nmost for development and the everyday livelihoods of \r\ncommunities. However, a precise estimate has yet to be \r\nmade as to how many hundreds of years it would take \r\nto clear all UXO-contaminated areas across the \r\ncountry. \r\n In light of the adverse impact of cluster \r\nmunitions, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic \r\nattaches great importance to the Convention on \r\nbanning and eradicating cluster munitions. In this \r\ncontext, we welcome and commend those countries \r\nthat have signed and ratified the Convention, and hope \r\nthat other countries that have not done so will follow \r\nsuit so that Convention may enter into force as soon as \r\npossible. In order to prepare for the future \r\nimplementation of the Convention, the Lao \r\nGovernment has offered to host the first conference of \r\nStates parties to the Convention on Cluster Munitions \r\nafter it enters into force. We hope that our offer will \r\nreceive broad support from all countries and \r\ninternational organizations. \r\n Despite the fact that peace, development and \r\ncooperation are the lodestars of our times, tensions, \r\nconflicts, violence, terrorism and threats to security \r\npersist in various parts of the world. The Lao People’s \r\nDemocratic Republic is deeply dismayed by the \r\nprolonged conflict in the Middle East, which continues \r\nto inflict immense suffering on millions of people in \r\nthe region, in particular the Palestinian people, who \r\nhave been struggling to exercise their legitimate and \r\ninalienable rights to self-determination and statehood. \r\nAlthough we have heard in the course of our general \r\ndebate many expressions of encouragement and \r\nrenewed hope for addressing the Middle East problem, \r\nthis can be realized only if all parties concerned \r\ndemonstrate their commitment to addressing the \r\nimpasse with a view to realizing the vision of two \r\nStates, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace \r\nand security within recognized borders, in accordance \r\nwith the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. \r\n We also remain concerned over the decades-long \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed \r\non the Republic of Cuba. It is now time to end these \r\nsanctions. \r\n Climate change continues to be a pressing \r\nconcern and to pose enormous challenges to the \r\nsurvival of humankind. Against this backdrop, global \r\nmeasures that conform to the principle of common but \r\ndifferentiated responsibility are urgently required. To \r\nthis end, the integration of the three pillars of \r\nsustainable development — economic development, \r\nsocial development and environmental protection — \r\nshould be enhanced with a view to effectively \r\nimplementing the Bali Action Plan.  \r\n In this context, we highly commend the \r\nSecretary-General for his initiative to convene the \r\nhigh-level Summit on Climate Change on \r\n22 September 2009, at which world leaders had the \r\nopportunity to discuss concrete measures and potential \r\nsolutions to the consequences of climate change, as \r\nwell as to prepare for the Climate Change Conference \r\nto be held in Copenhagen, Denmark. Furthermore, \r\nworld leaders have made strong commitments to taking \r\nthe necessary action to reduce greenhouse gas \r\nemissions, promote the green economy, provide \r\nmitigation and adaptation assistance, and generate \r\nalternative energy, including through technology \r\ntransfer from developed to developing countries, in \r\norder to enable the latter to adapt to the consequences \r\nand impacts of climate change. \r\n The Lao People’s Democratic Republic welcomes \r\nand supports the recommendation to launch a new \r\nGlobal Compact entailing a green New Deal, which \r\nwould no doubt provide an excellent platform for \r\naddressing the current global challenges, promoting \r\ninvestment in the green economy, laying the \r\nfoundations to deal with the crucial long-term issues, \r\nand helping to create a future based on a low-carbon \r\neconomy, renewable energy and energy efficiency. \r\n The multiple global crises, especially the \r\nfinancial and economic crises, have had many adverse \r\neffects on developing countries, in particular on the \r\nmost vulnerable groups. This is due primarily to the \r\nlack of basic infrastructure, access to markets, \r\nresources and modern technology, and to the fact that \r\ncapacity to provide financing and investment remains \r\nlow. In response, various forms of consultation and \r\napproach have been undertaken in an attempt to \r\nmitigate the long-term impacts of the crisis. In this \r\nregard, we welcome the initiatives of the Group of \r\nEight, the Group of 20 and other international forums \r\nto build a mechanism that will help find solutions to \r\nthe crisis, including the recommendations of the high-\r\nlevel Conference on the World Financial and Economic \r\nCrisis held here in June this year. \r\nA/64/PV.9  \r\n \r\n09-52586 40 \r\n \r\n As one of the most vulnerable countries in the \r\nworld, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic is of the \r\nview that all initiatives and measures undertaken must \r\nbe implemented effectively and in a timely manner. In \r\nparticular, it is important to address the \r\nunpredictability and vulnerability of commodity \r\nmarkets, provide preferential treatment to goods from \r\ndeveloping countries, especially those from the most \r\nvulnerable ones, ensure the smooth resolution of debt \r\nissues, improve technology transfer mechanism and \r\nreform the international financial system.  \r\n The fourth United Nations Conference on the \r\nLeast Developed Countries, to be held in early 2011, \r\nwill provide a good opportunity for the international \r\ncommunity to review its responsibilities and \r\ncommitments pledged to the least developed countries, \r\nas well as to identify obstacles and constraints and seek \r\npossible solutions to them, particularly in the wake of \r\nsuch a profound economic and financial crisis. \r\n The solid political stability and social order in the \r\nLao People’s Democratic Republic have provided \r\nfavourable conditions for national economic \r\ndevelopment. Nevertheless, the Lao People’s \r\nDemocratic Republic has also been adversely affected \r\nat a certain level by the recent global economic and \r\nfinancial crisis. The crisis has caused a slowdown in \r\neconomic development, with growth of the main \r\neconomic sectors such as industry, services and \r\nagriculture decreasing by 2 to 3 per cent. The trade \r\nsector was also affected, with exports dropping by \r\n28 per cent.  \r\n Against this backdrop, the Lao Government has \r\nundertaken urgent action by identifying eight measures \r\nand 80 priority areas to address. As a result of such \r\naction, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic has been \r\nable to mitigate the adverse impact of the crisis to a \r\ncertain degree. However, owing to the uncertainty of \r\ntoday’s global economy, the Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic, like other developing countries, remains \r\nvulnerable and still needs the support and cooperation \r\nfrom the international community to respond to the \r\ncrisis, with a view to preventing long-term impacts, \r\nwhich may occur at any time, and to achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and our ultimate \r\nnational goal of being removed from the list of least \r\ndeveloped countries by 2020. \r\n Today, more than ever, the international \r\ncommunity has the responsibility, as well as the \r\nopportunity, to promote solidarity and strengthen \r\ninternational cooperation in jointly addressing these \r\nglobal problems, as no country can weather alone the \r\nthreats and challenges confronting it. In this spirit, the \r\nLao People’s Democratic Republic reiterates its \r\nunshakable commitment to continue full cooperation \r\nwith the international community in pursuit of a world \r\nfree from fear and want, rooted in a new, just and \r\nequitable order. I believe that, with great solidarity, we \r\nwill be able to achieve the aforementioned goals. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ahmed Aboul Gheit, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Arab Republic of Egypt. \r\n Mr. Aboul Gheit (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nMr. President, on behalf of the African continent, allow \r\nme at the outset to congratulate our sisterly country, \r\nLibya, and you personally, on your assumption of the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly, and to express our \r\nconfidence that your leadership will lead to achieving \r\nthe success to which we aspire. I would also like to \r\nreaffirm the full support of Egypt and the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement for you in the fulfilment of your mission. \r\n Our session this year convenes against the \r\nbackdrop of international crises unprecedented in their \r\nnature and scope. The list of global challenges we are \r\nfacing, such as climate change, the food crisis and the \r\ncrises in international peace, is supplemented by \r\nadditional emerging global challenges that make it \r\nessential for us to redouble our efforts in a coordinated \r\nand collective manner.  \r\n The global financial crisis, together with the \r\nspread of diseases, such as the H1N1 virus, threatens \r\npublic health worldwide. Meeting this challenge \r\nrequires a high degree of conscientious collective work \r\nand a shared awareness of the effect that such a crisis \r\ncould have in many of our countries on stability in the \r\neconomic, social, even political, and perhaps security \r\nspheres. \r\n With regard to collective work on the \r\ninternational level, we should not overlook the fact that \r\nthe current international structures designed to manage \r\nthe realities of the global economy must reflect a \r\nbalance between the present and future. Therefore, \r\nthose structures must be subject to change, so as to \r\nbecome more compatible with current reality.  \r\n The change I refer to here is a gradual and \r\nstrategic shift, one which would make membership in \r\n A/64/PV.9\r\n \r\n41 09-52586 \r\n \r\nsuch structures accessible to a larger number of \r\ndeveloping countries and would grant them a stronger \r\nand more effective voice in determining the course of \r\nthe world economic order and its future. \r\n A few days ago, we all took part in the climate \r\nchange summit, convened upon the initiative of the \r\nSecretary-General, and listened to all the pledges made \r\nand the concerns expressed. While Egypt is aware of \r\nthe seriousness of the phenomenon in question and the \r\ngravity of the challenges that climate change is \r\nimposing on all of us, we believe in the possibility that \r\ncollective work could provide new opportunities for \r\nadvancing development in developing societies in a \r\nmanner that would allow the agreed sustainable \r\ndevelopment principles to be fulfilled. In this respect, \r\nwe look forward, as was stated by President Mubarak \r\nat the L’Aquila summit in Italy in July 2009, to \r\narriving at a fair and balanced deal at the upcoming \r\nCopenhagen conference in December that would take \r\ninto consideration the aspirations and rights of \r\ndeveloping countries and, at the same time, address all \r\ncrucial issues, including mitigation, adaptation, \r\nfinancing and technology transfer.  \r\n A fair and balanced deal should further ensure the \r\nfulfilment of commitments by developed countries, and \r\nenable our developing countries to implement their \r\nvoluntary commitments within the framework of \r\nhonest application of the principle of common but \r\ndifferentiated responsibility. \r\n The world financial crisis did not originate in, nor \r\nwas it caused by, developing countries. However, they \r\nare all suffering from its consequences in different \r\nforms and at different levels as a result of the decrease \r\nin the volume of international trade, the tightening of \r\ninternational credit terms and the decline in tourist \r\ninflows and monetary remittances.  \r\n The current international economic recession has \r\nno doubt negatively affected most States. However, \r\nStates of the South remain the most affected, due to the \r\nnegative repercussions of the recession on public \r\nspending in health care, education and sustainable \r\ndevelopment in general. The parallel economic, \r\nfinancial and food crises that we are still confronting \r\nundoubtedly compound the hardships faced by the \r\ncountries of the South in particular, and place \r\nenormous burdens on us in terms of preserving \r\neconomic and social security in our countries.  \r\n To confront such challenges, serious and genuine \r\ninternational support and solidarity are required, based \r\non enhancing agricultural development with a view to \r\nincreasing production and productivity. Furthermore, \r\nthere is an urgent need to launch an international \r\ndialogue between exporting and importing countries in \r\nthe developing and developed worlds alike, in order to \r\nagree on an international strategy to confront the crisis, \r\nand to formulate an international code of conduct to \r\nreview the policies that govern the use of biofuels. In \r\naddition, we must reach an agreement under the \r\numbrella of the World Trade Organization that \r\neliminates agricultural subsidy programmes that are in \r\noperation in some developed countries. \r\n To confront the energy crisis, it is important to \r\nhave a genuine, broad dialogue among the relevant \r\nparties to identify the best available options. The \r\nsituation requires securing increased development \r\nassistance and further investments in the markets of \r\nenergy-producing developing countries, as well as \r\nconfronting irresponsible speculation on international \r\nmarkets. \r\n In this context, Egypt hopes that the 2010 high-\r\nlevel meeting to follow up on the implementation of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) will \r\nexpedite renewal of international commitment and \r\nsolidarity towards achieving the Goals. A \r\ncomprehensive assessment of what has been achieved \r\nthus far in the implementation of the MDGs must be \r\ncarried out and a mechanism established to follow up \r\non implementation. This should lead to full \r\nimplementation by 2015, particularly in Africa, which \r\nis witnessing low implementation rates, an issue which \r\nneeds to be effectively addressed. \r\n Undoubtedly, all of these challenges oblige the \r\ncountries of the South to strengthen mutual \r\ncooperation. As current Chair of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement, Egypt will work to enhance South-South \r\ncooperation in coordination with the Group of 77 and \r\nChina. We look forward to a successful United Nations \r\nconference on South-South cooperation, to be held in \r\nKenya later this year, aimed at further strengthening \r\nthis cooperation. \r\n Having spoken of the interlinked crises facing the \r\nworld today, I would like to address an important issue \r\nrelated to the human rights architecture of the United \r\nNations system. Despite the radical reform ushered in \r\nby the establishment of the Human Rights Council, \r\nA/64/PV.9  \r\n \r\n09-52586 42 \r\n \r\nEgypt is still dissatisfied with respect to the \r\npoliticization of human rights issues. This \r\npoliticization weakens the potential to reach consensus \r\non a variety of issues that should not be subject to \r\ndifferences as they are of concern to us all and affect \r\nthe credibility of the work of the United Nations in this \r\nvital field. Hence, Egypt is determined to exert its \r\nutmost effort to engage with other States in order to \r\nbring divergent views closer together and to establish \r\ncommon ground to restore the international consensus \r\nthat binds us all, which forms the basis for our actions \r\nin this important area in the Human Rights Council and \r\nin the General Assembly. \r\n In that context, we look forward to a greater role \r\nfor the Human Rights Council. Every one of us should \r\naddress the issue of the incitement of religious hatred \r\nand racism under the pretext of freedom of expression. \r\nWe look forward to, and in fact have already begun to \r\nseek, commonly agreed language for a draft resolution \r\non freedom of expression, to underscore the \r\nimportance of this freedom as an indispensable \r\ncornerstone of any democratic society, while avoiding \r\nthe depiction of acts of incitement to religious, racial \r\nand other forms of hatred as legitimate acts of freedom \r\nof expression. We categorically reject such a depiction. \r\n Turning to issues of international peace and \r\nsecurity, I will begin with disarmament. Egypt attaches \r\ngreat importance to a successful conclusion of the 2010 \r\nReview Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), in the \r\nhope that nuclear disarmament and the nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation regime will be put back on the right \r\ntrack. This will depend on dealing effectively with the \r\ndecisions and the resolutions of the 1995 and 2000 \r\nReview Conferences, in particular the resolution on the \r\nMiddle East.  \r\n It is crucial that the international community as a \r\nwhole support the current active momentum in the \r\ninternational arena with regard to disarmament issues, \r\nespecially in the light of developments in the positions \r\nof the main nuclear-weapon States, in particular the \r\nUnited States. We have listened to their statements, in \r\nparticular the address by President Obama to the \r\nAssembly on 23 September (see A/64/PV.3), and we \r\nhope that these evolving positions will provide an \r\nopportunity for making historic progress in this regard. \r\n In the same context, it is necessary to effectively \r\ndeal with the issues of regional stability and security, \r\nmainly through eliminating the incomprehensible and \r\nunjustified lassitude in dealing with the issue of Israeli \r\nnuclear capabilities and the persistent threat they pose \r\nto security and stability in the Middle East. This is \r\nespecially true in the context of intensified efforts to \r\nexpand the commitments of the non-nuclear States \r\nparties to the NPT, without due regard for the need to \r\nachieve the Treaty’s universality — and if there is no \r\ncommitment, there should be no universality — and to \r\nsubject all nuclear facilities in the Middle East to the \r\ncomprehensive safeguards regime of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Egypt will continue its \r\ndiligent work to address this situation in all relevant \r\ninternational forums and to highlight the risks, with the \r\naim of effecting changes in the situation. \r\n The situation in the Middle East region is still \r\ndominated by considerable tension, a tendency towards \r\nconfrontation and lack of stability. Notwithstanding the \r\ntireless efforts exerted to stabilize the situation, many \r\nparties still consider it beneficial to exacerbate that \r\ntension. \r\n The question of Palestine clearly remains far \r\nfrom being resolved, despite international concern and \r\nall the serious efforts, pressure, contacts, visits and \r\nmeetings. Since I questioned in this Assembly last year \r\n(see A/63/PV.13) the existence of genuine Israeli \r\ndetermination to achieve a just peace with the \r\nPalestinians, events have thus far justified our \r\nscepticism.  \r\n Throughout this year, Israel has shown a lack of \r\nthe political will necessary to engage in serious and \r\ncredible negotiations that aim at reaching a final \r\nsettlement to the conflict, a settlement which \r\nencompasses all the elements, tracks and topics and \r\nwhich leads to the establishment of an independent \r\nPalestinian State on the complete Palestinian national \r\nterritory, occupied since 1967, with East Jerusalem as \r\nits capital. \r\n In this respect, I would like to sum up the \r\nEgyptian view of the situation with the following \r\nelements, including what we hope to achieve.  \r\n First, intensive work during the coming period is \r\nnecessary in order to resume the negotiating process as \r\nsoon as possible. The international community should \r\nput forward a formula for a final settlement to the \r\nconflict — the so-called end game — cognizant of the \r\nneed to waste no more time in studying details that \r\n A/64/PV.9\r\n \r\n43 09-52586 \r\n \r\neveryone knows will not help to realize the desired \r\nsettlement. \r\n Secondly, Israel’s commitment to completely \r\nfreeze settlement activity in all occupied Palestinian \r\nterritories, including East Jerusalem, must be secured, \r\nnot only because such activity is contrary to \r\ninternational law and should be halted, but also in \r\norder to build a climate of trust between the two \r\nparties, thus allowing final-status negotiations to bear \r\nfruit. Such Israeli commitment would pave the way to \r\nrestoring lost credibility in efforts to achieve peace. On \r\nthe other hand, any retreat from that commitment \r\nwould inflict severe harm on the prospects for peace in \r\nthe coming period. \r\n Thirdly, the freeze of Israeli settlement activity \r\nshould occur simultaneously and in parallel with the \r\nnegotiations, in order to bolster Palestinian trust in \r\nIsraeli intentions.  \r\n Fourthly, if an agreement is reached on the final \r\nborders of the State to be established on the Palestinian \r\nnational soil occupied in 1967, on the understanding \r\nthat the State’s borders are essentially those of 1967, as \r\nhad been agreed by both parties during the 2008 \r\nnegotiations with the participation of the United States, \r\nthat agreement could be gradually implemented at a \r\npace to be agreed upon by both parties and within a \r\ntime-bound framework.  \r\n Fifthly, East Jerusalem is an integral part of the \r\noccupied Palestinian territories. As one of the issues to \r\nbe included in final status negotiations, it should under \r\nno circumstances be excluded from any future \r\nnegotiations. \r\n Sixthly, Israel’s engagement in a serious, \r\ncredible, clear and time-bound negotiating process \r\nwould restore the situation on other issues to that \r\nwhich prevailed in the 1990s in terms of Arab \r\ninteraction with Israel, with a view to enhancing \r\nmutual trust and thus boosting negotiating efforts as a \r\nwhole. \r\n Egypt is closely following the situation in sisterly \r\nSudan with the same high level of interest, not only \r\nbecause of the historical bonds between our two \r\npeoples and nations but also out of concern for the \r\nSudan’s future, stability and territorial integrity and our \r\nawareness of the numerous threats facing it. Egypt is \r\nworking earnestly with all Sudanese parties, foremost \r\namong which is the Sudanese Government, and in \r\ncoordination with influential regional and international \r\nstakeholders to resolve existing problems. Our sons \r\ntake part in the United Nations forces in South Sudan \r\nand in Darfur, and we contribute — out of our limited \r\nresources — to efforts to support development and \r\nprovide health care to our brothers and sisters in the \r\nsouth and west of the Sudan. We hope that the \r\nSudanese people, in their wisdom and with the support \r\nthey receive from their neighbours and international \r\npartners, will be able to weather the upcoming critical \r\nphase, so that the Sudan’s unity can withstand all \r\nfuture tests and so that unity becomes the first and the \r\nmost attractive option for all Sudanese. This is an \r\nimportant objective, which Egypt is working diligently \r\nto achieve. \r\n We cannot conclude our comments on the Middle \r\nEast without referring to security in the Arab Gulf \r\nregion, which is among Egypt’s main interests and at \r\nthe top of its foreign policy priorities. This focus is not \r\nonly based on the strong bonds that connect us with the \r\nmember States of the Gulf Cooperation Council \r\n(GCC), but also on our firm conviction that Egypt \r\nrepresents a strategic asset for its Arab brothers in the \r\nGulf area. For this reason, Egypt will work with GCC \r\ncountries to ensure Arab regional security and that any \r\nsecurity arrangements that are being contemplated by \r\ninternational or regional parties will correspond fully \r\nto the needs and concerns of the Arab Gulf States. \r\n In conclusion, the fifteenth Summit Conference \r\nof Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned \r\nCountries, held in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, on 15 and \r\n16 July 2009, adopted four main declarations. The first \r\nis the Sharm el-Sheikh Declaration, which contains our \r\nmember States’ clear vision on the most critical current \r\nissues that constitute a priority for our work within the \r\nUnited Nations. These include in particular the issues \r\nof disarmament and international security, \r\npeacekeeping and peacebuilding, human rights and \r\ndemocracy, the right of peoples to self-determination, \r\nthe situation in the Middle East and the Palestinian \r\nquestion, the reform of the United Nations, unilateral \r\nsanctions, the global financial and economic crisis, \r\ninternationally agreed development goals, food \r\nsecurity, Africa’s special needs, diseases and \r\npandemics, the role of civil society, climate change, \r\nenergy, human trafficking, international terrorism and \r\ndialogue among civilizations and religions. The second \r\ndeclaration is on the necessity of ending the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the \r\nA/64/PV.9  \r\n \r\n09-52586 44 \r\n \r\nUnited States of America against Cuba. The third is on \r\ndesignating 18 July as International Nelson Mandela \r\nDay. The fourth is a declaration on Palestine. These \r\ndeclarations will be issued as official documents of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n Last July, following the chairmanship of the \r\nfriendly country of Cuba, Egypt assumed leadership of \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement for the next three years. \r\nWe are determined to implement the provisions of the \r\nSummit’s final document according to the priorities set \r\nout in those declarations. We shall put forward at this \r\nsession the pertinent draft resolutions and decisions to \r\nimplement those documents. The delegation of Egypt \r\nwill be pleased to work with all Member States in a \r\nspirit of openness and determination to make this \r\nsession a success. We extend a hand to all States with \r\nan open mind and the resolve to achieve success on the \r\ninternational agenda before us. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I now give the \r\nfloor to Mr. Nasser Judeh, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. \r\n Mr. Judeh (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): First of \r\nall, I would like very warmly to congratulate you, Sir, \r\non your election to preside over the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-fourth session. I am certain that, thanks to \r\nyour recognized experience and wisdom, you will be \r\nable to enrich our discussions and provide an \r\nappropriate framework for our deliberations. That will \r\nensure that, through our joint efforts, this session is a \r\nproductive and special one that strengthens the role and \r\nimproves the work of the Organization as the principal \r\ninternational body for multilateral action and the \r\nfulcrum of our joint efforts. I should also like to \r\ncommend your predecessor, Mr. Miguel d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann, for his efforts during the previous session, \r\nwhich we appreciate. I also thank and commend His \r\nExcellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. \r\n We are pleased to see concrete trends towards \r\nenhancing multilateralism in the United Nations. We \r\nare convinced that such a course of action is the best \r\nand most effective way to reach agreement and take up \r\nthe complex international challenges we face. These \r\nchallenges cannot be confronted by one country on its \r\nown, because they are transnational and complex in \r\nnature and require concerted international action under \r\nthe auspices of a single international organization in \r\nwhich all participate. Although some have doubted the \r\neffectiveness of the United Nations and its ability to \r\naddress the challenges and problems of the twenty-first \r\ncentury, there is no doubt that, because of the \r\nuniversality of its membership, it remains the ideal \r\nforum to address the current challenges facing peoples \r\nand Governments, of which we are all aware. As we \r\nare all aware, the current tendency to marginalize \r\nmultilateral efforts — particularly those of the United \r\nNations — has negative effects that only make \r\nproblems more complex, instead of helping to \r\novercome or resolve them. \r\n The United Nations and its subsidiary organs \r\nrequire reform, including financial and administrative \r\nreform, so that the Organization can be fully effective \r\nin addressing present and future international \r\nchallenges. Such challenges have arisen as a result of \r\nstructural and systemic changes since the establishment \r\nof the Organization, as well as technological \r\nadvancements, such as the information and \r\ncommunications revolution, and the well-known \r\neffects of globalization. All of this has made the world \r\na global village in which everybody feels the negative \r\neffects of problems and challenges such as \r\ndesertification, climate change, terrorism, poverty, \r\npandemics and the proliferation of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction.  \r\n Among the major achievements of the United \r\nNations is its pioneering role in seeking to eliminate \r\ncolonization and occupation in order to ensure the right \r\nof all peoples to self-determination. Although the \r\nOrganization has assumed ongoing responsibility for \r\nthe question of Palestine, Israel has, unfortunately, \r\nbeen occupying Palestinian and Arab territories since \r\n1967 to prevent the Palestinian people from exercising \r\ntheir right to self-determination by creating an \r\nindependent State on their national soil in the West \r\nBank and Gaza, with East Jerusalem as its capital, on \r\nthe basis of the line of 4 June 1967. Israel continues \r\nalso to occupy the Syrian Golan and some Lebanese \r\nterritory. For their part, the Arabs adopted the Arab \r\nPeace Initiative at the 2002 Beirut Summit and have \r\nreaffirmed its principles at all subsequent Arab \r\nsummits, including that held in Doha last spring. \r\n Discussions continue on the two-State solution \r\nand on a comprehensive peace, which would permit the \r\nestablishment of an independent Palestinian State and \r\nenable Syria and Lebanon to recover their occupied \r\nterritories. That would provide a just and agreed \r\nsolution to the question of Palestinian refugees in \r\naccordance with the provisions of resolution 194 (III), \r\n A/64/PV.9\r\n \r\n45 09-52586 \r\n \r\nwhich would ensure peace and security, with \r\nrecognition of Israel by all Arab States. Israel \r\ncontinues to reject the Arab and international option of \r\na just and comprehensive peace and a two-State \r\nsolution under the international terms of reference and \r\nthe Arab Peace Initiative. Therefore, a good-faith \r\nresponse reflecting genuine and positive political will \r\nmust be forthcoming. \r\n There has been unprecedented support in the \r\ninternational community — including in the Arab \r\nworld and among the Palestinians — for the \r\nconsiderable and sincere efforts being made by United \r\nStates President Barack Obama and his Administration \r\nwith a view to the holding of serious negotiations \r\nleading to the two-State solution and the establishment \r\nof a comprehensive peace in the Middle East, which \r\nwould be in the interest of the United States, Palestine, \r\nthe Arabs, the Israelis and the entire world. We in \r\nJordan, under the auspices of His Majesty \r\nKing Abdullah Bin Al Hussein, son of His late Majesty \r\nKing Hussein, continue to strive tirelessly to attain that \r\nnoble objective, which our people deserve. \r\n The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan fully supports \r\nthe statement made by United States President Barack \r\nObama on 23 September (see A/64/PV.3). It provided a \r\nclear vision of a definitive solution and of terms of \r\nreference that would end the 1967 Israeli occupation in \r\norder to permit the establishment of a viable, \r\nindependent Palestinian State with contiguous territory, \r\nliving side by side in peace and security with Israel, \r\nand achieve peace among Syria, Lebanon and Israel. \r\nWith regard to the political terms of reference for \r\nnegotiations between the Palestinians and the Israelis, \r\nPresident Obama stated that the final-status issues of \r\nsecurity for Israelis and Palestinians, borders, refugees \r\nand Jerusalem were key to successful negotiations. We \r\nappreciate the importance of his comments regarding \r\nthe illegality of the settlements.  \r\n Thus, President Obama has demonstrated his firm \r\ncommitment to a two-State solution and a \r\ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East. Since his first \r\nday in office, he has continued to seek to create a \r\nconstructive atmosphere conducive to the swift \r\nresumption of serious negotiations, on all issues and on \r\nall tracks. \r\n The international community as a whole must \r\nalso shoulder its responsibility to ensure the swift \r\nresumption of negotiations and their success. In that \r\nconnection, I wish to express our appreciation and full \r\nsupport to His Excellency President Mahmoud Abbas \r\nfor his commitment to peace based on genuine \r\npartnership, fundamental Palestinian and Arab \r\nprinciples and the international framework, as well as \r\nhis sincere engagement on behalf of the Palestinian \r\nAuthority in all efforts to achieve a two-State solution, \r\nwhich was demonstrated once again at the tripartite \r\nmeeting organized by President Obama in New York at \r\nthe beginning of this week. \r\n This constructive and appropriate atmosphere has \r\nbeen marred by the actions of Israel, which refuses to \r\nhalt its settlement activities, including in occupied East \r\nJerusalem, where it continues to take unilateral action. \r\nIts excavations continue under and around the Al-Aqsa \r\nmosque and other areas that are part of the Islamic and \r\nChristian cultural heritage. It continues to demolish the \r\nhomes of Arabs and to expel them. Israel is doing this \r\nin order to alter the demographic character of East \r\nJerusalem, which has an Arab religious and historical \r\nidentity. It is at the heart of the occupied territories and \r\nis inextricable from them. The Security Council and \r\nthe General Assembly have declared those Israeli \r\nactions null and void.  \r\n From this rostrum today, we ask Israel to return \r\nto the peace process that everyone supports and to put \r\nan end to its illegal measures, including its settlement \r\nactivities, in order to create an atmosphere conducive \r\nto the resumption of serious and productive peace \r\nnegotiations on all tracks, in particular on such issues \r\nas monitoring mechanisms that include clear timetables \r\nand benchmarks for assessing the status of mutual \r\nimplementation once negotiations have ended.  \r\n There can be no doubt that the United Nations \r\nhas a direct role and an obligation in this regard, given \r\nits permanent responsibility for the question of \r\nPalestine, alongside the role of the Quartet, which we \r\nfully support. The Organization could also play a \r\nbigger part in the negotiations and verification \r\nmechanisms, as well as on other crucial issues.  \r\n We reaffirm the importance of the role of the \r\nmembers of the Quartet — the European Union, the \r\nRussian Federation, the United States and the United \r\nNations. The blockade on Gaza must be lifted. Every \r\nday, our people there are suffering tragically, and they \r\nlack basic commodities. It is unacceptable and \r\nunreasonable that the siege should continue and the \r\nA/64/PV.9  \r\n \r\n09-52586 46 \r\n \r\nsituation persist. The inhumane blockade must be \r\nended and Gaza must be rehabilitated.  \r\n We hope that Palestinian reconciliation efforts are \r\nsuccessful, and we fully support Egypt’s efforts in that \r\nregard. We should pay particular attention to the report \r\nof the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the \r\nGaza Conflict (A/HRC/12/48), and we hope that it will \r\npromote the necessary follow-up.  \r\n The United Nations has played a central role in \r\nestablishing an international human rights protection \r\nsystem and international mechanisms for promoting \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms. The \r\nHashemite Kingdom of Jordan is honoured to have \r\nbeen a member of the Human Rights Council twice \r\nsince its establishment. We appreciate the international \r\nrecognition of our policies on the protection of human \r\nrights and fundamental freedoms, adopted by my \r\ncountry under King Abdullah II.  \r\n In addition, the United Nations provided the \r\nimpetus for international efforts to establish the \r\nInternational Criminal Court as a permanent \r\ninternational judicial body to try cases of war crimes, \r\ncrimes against humanity and flagrant violations of \r\nhuman rights. Jordan actively participated in the Rome \r\nDiplomatic Conference that brought about the adoption \r\nof the Court’s Statute. We had the privilege of chairing \r\nthe first meeting of States members of the Court.  \r\n The United Nations has also played a significant \r\nrole in codifying international humanitarian law: its \r\nCharter prohibits recourse to the use or the threat of \r\nuse of force in international relations. The \r\nOrganization subsequently supported the adoption of \r\nthe major international conventions on that issue, in \r\nparticular the four Geneva Conventions, of which we \r\nare marking the sixtieth anniversary, as well as the \r\n1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural \r\nProperty in the Event of Armed Conflict.  \r\n The United Nations has made great progress on \r\nthe non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, \r\nin particular nuclear weapons, through the unlimited \r\nextension in 1995 of the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Here, \r\nwe call for compliance with the other decisions \r\naccompanying the decision to extend the NPT from \r\n1995 and for recognition of the Middle East region as a \r\nzone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of \r\nmass destruction. \r\n We affirm our country’s commitment to the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, \r\nwhile also reaffirming our legitimate right to the \r\npeaceful use of nuclear energy and to strengthening \r\ncontrol mechanisms that would prevent peaceful \r\nprogrammes from being used as a cover for military \r\nones. We are resolved to make peaceful use of nuclear \r\nenergy, and we have adopted all the agreements, \r\ndocuments and verification mechanisms of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency. \r\n The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan supports all \r\ninternational efforts to bring into force the \r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We encourage \r\ncountries to adopt and ratify the Treaty so that it may \r\nenter into force as soon as possible, which would be a \r\nstep forward towards nuclear disarmament. We call for \r\nadherence to Security Council resolution 1887 (2009), \r\nadopted on 24 September.  \r\n My country has always been and will remain at \r\nthe forefront in the fight against terrorism and \r\nextremism and in working to bring religions and \r\ncivilizations closer together, as well as in transmitting \r\nthe true and admirable essence of Islam and its noble \r\nhuman values. We have therefore adopted important \r\ninitiatives, including the Amman Message issued by \r\nHis Majesty the King, and its accompanying document, \r\nthe Good Word.  \r\n Jordan supports comprehensive national \r\nreconciliation in Iraq among all segments of the \r\npopulation, with no exception. It supports efforts to \r\nconsolidate peace and security in Iraq in all spheres so \r\nas to ensure civil peace, territorial integrity, political \r\nindependence and sovereignty and to stop all external \r\ninterference in its internal affairs so that that brother \r\ncountry can fully recover its place in the region and in \r\nthe world at large.  \r\n Finally, Jordan is committed to international \r\npeace and security. We participate actively in \r\npeacekeeping operations. The number of personnel that \r\nwe contribute to the various peacekeeping operations \r\nin which we are taking part is growing and becoming \r\ngeographically broader. This demonstrates that we are \r\ntruly playing an active role in the United Nations, \r\nbecause we are backing up our words with action. It \r\nalso shows our clear political resolve to contribute to \r\nserious multilateral action within the United Nations \r\nsystem. \r\n A/64/PV.9\r\n \r\n47 09-52586 \r\n \r\n I would like to reiterate that we will do what is \r\nnecessary, and more, to strengthen multilateral \r\ninternational action for efforts to implement a two-\r\nState solution and to achieve comprehensive peace in \r\nthe Middle East, and for anything that contributes to \r\ninternational cooperation and to bringing together \r\ndiverse civilizations, which would enrich the lives of \r\nour societies in the world that we share. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Miroslav Lajčak, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Slovak Republic. \r\n Mr. Lajčak (Slovakia): It is a great privilege and \r\nhonour for me to address the General Assembly, to \r\nwhich people of the world look with high hopes and \r\nexpectations to find effective solutions to the multitude \r\nof challenges and threats that spare no one.  \r\n First, let me congratulate you, Sir, on the \r\nassumption of your duties as President of the General \r\nAssembly at the sixty-fourth session and also express \r\nmy delegation’s appreciation to your predecessor, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann, for his \r\nwork during the sixty-third session. \r\n Slovakia fully associates itself with the statement \r\ndelivered earlier by the Prime Minister of Sweden on \r\nbehalf of the European Union. I would like to \r\ncontribute to this debate with some additional remarks. \r\n Slovakia is a keen believer in effective \r\nmultilateralism and the central role of the United \r\nNations in that regard. We therefore greatly welcome \r\nthe main theme of our deliberations during this general \r\ndebate, with a focus on achieving tangible results on \r\nthe three pillars of the work of the United Nations: \r\npeace and security, human rights and development. \r\n We welcome the attention that the Organization \r\nhas paid to the issue of climate change, as well as to \r\nincreasing food security and eliminating the negative \r\neffects of the financial and economic crisis, especially \r\nin the most vulnerable States and populations. Slovakia \r\ncalls for reaching an ambitious, balanced and \r\ncomprehensive agreement on climate change in \r\nCopenhagen at the end of 2009 that will replace the \r\nKyoto Protocol. Also, we need to elaborate an action \r\nplan and strengthen global strategies for food security \r\nin the world. It is essential not to lose sight of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and to maintain our \r\nefforts to achieve them by the year 2015. \r\n We have in recent years invested considerable \r\neffort in elaborating and implementing our own \r\nconcept of official development assistance, through a \r\nnumber of bilateral and multilateral projects. The \r\nwestern Balkans, Central Asia, Afghanistan and Africa \r\nhave been among our priority geographic areas in this \r\nregard. \r\n Slovakia’s commitment to the issues of economic \r\nand social development prompted us to present our \r\ncandidature for membership of the United Nations \r\nEconomic and Social Council at the elections to be \r\nheld in the General Assembly later this year. We \r\nappreciate the endorsement of our candidature by the \r\nGroup of Eastern European and other States and will \r\ndo our best to gain the trust and support of all of the \r\nOrganization’s Member States. Slovakia is committed \r\nto serving as an active and engaged member of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council, and would like to \r\ncontribute tangibly to making that important United \r\nNations organ as relevant and as effective as possible. \r\n The United Nations has achieved remarkable \r\nresults in peacekeeping over past decades. We \r\nrecognize its continued efforts to adapt peacekeeping \r\nso that it can respond better to current and future \r\nchallenges. More emphasis should be put on ensuring \r\nthat peacekeepers and other United Nations actors on \r\nthe ground are properly equipped and trained, \r\nincluding in the area of the so-called critical \r\ncapabilities. It is our belief that preventive diplomacy \r\nshould be used whenever possible in order to avoid \r\nconflicts in the first place. \r\n Slovakia continues to be actively engaged in \r\nnumerous peace and security endeavours of the \r\ninternational community. We are currently participating \r\nin international crisis-management operations under \r\nUnited Nations command or Security Council mandate \r\nin Afghanistan, Cyprus, Kosovo, Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina and the Middle East. We are doing our \r\nbest to contribute to peacekeeping, peacebuilding, \r\nstabilization and reconstruction efforts in those parts of \r\nthe world and will continue to do so in the future. \r\n In addition, Slovakia remains actively engaged in \r\nthe area of security sector reform, an issue that we \r\nbegan promoting within the United Nations during our \r\nnon-permanent membership in the Security Council. \r\nSlovakia, as the initiator and chair of the United \r\nNations Group of Friends of Security Sector Reform, \r\nwill continue working to ensure that the United \r\nA/64/PV.9  \r\n \r\n09-52586 48 \r\n \r\nNations system is able to react in an adequate, timely \r\nand systematic manner to the needs of Member States \r\nrelating to security sector reform. After a useful \r\nAfrican regional workshop, held in Cape Town as a \r\njoint South African and Slovak project, we have now \r\nteamed up with key partners, namely, Argentina and \r\nIndonesia, in two other important regions, Latin \r\nAmerica and South-East Asia. The Buenos Aires \r\nworkshop will be held just a few days from now. \r\n As I have already mentioned, we are glad to see \r\nthat significant progress has been achieved in \r\npreventive diplomacy, conflict prevention and \r\nmediation support. This has recently been \r\ndemonstrated, for example, in the role played by \r\nUnited Nations mediation teams in helping to find \r\npeaceful and negotiated solutions to crises in Kenya, \r\nZimbabwe, Madagascar and elsewhere. Slovakia will \r\ncontribute further to that work. We are, in this regard, \r\nvery pleased that the first United Nations Regional \r\nCentre for Preventive Diplomacy, located in Central \r\nAsia and led by a Slovak representative, has achieved \r\ngood results so far and has fully proved itself as a \r\nmeaningful and necessary project. We are convinced \r\nthat issues such as conflict prevention cannot be seen \r\nin isolation. They are connected with respect for \r\nhuman rights, protection of civilians, gender equality, \r\nprotection of children in armed conflict and so forth. \r\nAs a serving member of the United Nations Human \r\nRights Council, Slovakia works to promote universal \r\nrespect for the protection of human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms for all, at national and \r\ninternational levels. \r\n Among the key tools that the United Nations has \r\nat its disposal for protecting those who are most \r\nendangered and vulnerable is the concept of \r\nresponsibility to protect, one of the most important \r\nachievements of the 2005 World Summit. We believe \r\nthe international community should focus more on the \r\nprotection of civilian populations from genocide, war \r\ncrimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. \r\nNor can we forget our obligation, under international \r\nlaw, to prevent the incitement of those most serious \r\ncrimes, which should be referred to the International \r\nCriminal Court, established for the purpose of ending \r\nimpunity for perpetrators of such crimes. \r\n Much of the Organization’s ability to deal with \r\ncurrent threats and challenges depends on the existing \r\ninstitutional framework. The United Nations Security \r\nCouncil is at the centre of that framework. Slovakia is \r\na long-term advocate of enlarging the Security Council \r\nin both of its membership categories. The composition \r\nof an enlarged Security Council should better reflect \r\nnew global realities. Appropriate attention must also be \r\npaid to the Council’s working methods. We are pleased \r\nthat the intergovernmental negotiations have begun and \r\nbelieve that things will move forward in the interest of \r\nmaking the Security Council a truly relevant and \r\nefficient body. \r\n The old saying “If you seek peace, prepare for \r\nwar” has resulted in an unprecedented arms race, \r\nwhich in itself has become a source of fear and \r\ninsecurity. Slovakia is particularly concerned about the \r\nrisk of weapons of mass destruction and their means of \r\ndelivery falling into the hands of non-State actors, \r\nespecially terrorist groups. In this connection, Slovakia \r\nis ready to work with all partners towards the \r\nsuccessful outcome of the 2010 Review Conference of \r\nthe Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons, which should result in an enhanced \r\ninternational nuclear non-proliferation regime. Our \r\npriority is to outlaw nuclear testing and see the \r\nComprehensive Test-Ban Treaty come into force. \r\nSlovakia also calls for an early start to substantive \r\nnegotiations on an arms trade treaty, which is essential \r\nfor reducing the unacceptable human cost resulting \r\nfrom the proliferation of conventional arms. \r\n Slovakia, together with the other members of the \r\nEuropean Union, is deeply concerned about Iran’s \r\ncontinued defiance despite its international obligations, \r\nincluding the Security Council’s demands that it \r\nsuspend its nuclear activities. We note that Iran has \r\nagreed to continue talks with the P5+1 group of the \r\nfive permanent members of the Security Council plus \r\nGermany, and we call on Iran to commit to diplomatic \r\nnegotiations in order to restore the trust of the \r\ninternational community and make real and urgently \r\nneeded progress. The deteriorating human rights \r\nsituation and the violent suppression of the popular \r\nprotests that erupted in Iran after the elections in June \r\nis a cause of much concern to Slovakia. We have also \r\nrepeatedly and strongly condemned the nuclear test and \r\nmissile launches carried out by the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea. We call on North Korea to \r\nreverse its position on the Non-Proliferation Treaty and \r\njoin the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. \r\n Let me now turn to some regional issues that \r\nSlovakia pays particular attention to. As a matter of \r\npriority, Slovakia has been closely following \r\n A/64/PV.9\r\n \r\n49 09-52586 \r\n \r\ndevelopments in the western Balkans. We continue to \r\npromote full respect for international law, including the \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of States within \r\ntheir internationally recognized borders. At the same \r\ntime, we welcome and support a peaceful and \r\nconstructive approach to seeking solutions to disputes. \r\nWe believe that the future of the entire region and its \r\npeople lies in the European perspective and that there \r\nis no meaningful alternative to that. \r\n Promotion of full respect for international law \r\nand the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States \r\nwithin their internationally recognized borders is also \r\nthe principle that guides us in the case of Georgia. \r\nSlovakia was very disappointed when, earlier this year, \r\nthe Security Council was unable to agree on extending \r\nthe mandate of the United Nations Observer Mission in \r\nGeorgia. The termination of the Mission complicates \r\nthe already unstable situation in the region, as well as \r\nthe security conditions for civilians in the conflict \r\nzone. We firmly support a peaceful and lasting solution \r\nto the conflict in Georgia and hope that the Geneva \r\ntalks will yield positive results. \r\n In addition to participating in the United Nations \r\nPeacekeeping Force in Cyprus operation on a long-\r\nterm basis, Slovakia has been actively engaged for \r\nmore than 20 years in the confidence-building process \r\nbetween the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot \r\npolitical leaders, and we are committed to continuing \r\nour active engagement. A combination of military and \r\ndevelopment aid activities characterizes our long-term \r\nactive engagement in Afghanistan. Slovakia, as a \r\nmember of the International Security Assistance Force \r\noperation, is helping to establish a secure and stable \r\nenvironment in Afghanistan. \r\n In conclusion, Slovakia hopes that the last year of \r\nthe first decade of this millennium will bring all the \r\nStates of the international community closer together in \r\norder to overcome the negative consequences of the \r\nfinancial and economic crisis, among others. \r\n This represents a basic step towards the possible \r\nsettlement of many other conflicts and problems that \r\nthe international community is facing. In our view, we \r\nhave to intensify our efforts, in this regard, and adopt \r\nappropriate measures on the local, regional and global \r\nlevels in the spirit of solidarity and common \r\nresponsibility. We strongly believe that the United \r\nNations and its specialized agencies must be directly \r\nengaged in this process and guide the world for the \r\nwelfare of this generation and of those of the future. \r\n I should like once again to reaffirm Slovakia’s \r\nsupport for your work, which, through pursuing the \r\npriorities of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth \r\nsession, will address the main ills that pain the \r\ninternational community today. \r\n The President (spoke in Arabic): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Taib Fassi Fihri, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs and Cooperation of the Kingdom of \r\nMorocco. \r\n Mr. Fihri (spoke in Arabic): On behalf of the \r\nKingdom of Morocco, I should like to congratulate you \r\nwarmly, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the \r\nGeneral-Assembly of the United Nations at its sixty-\r\nfourth session. We are proud to see a son of a brotherly \r\ncountry from our region at the helm of this universal \r\nbody. You may rest assured that our delegation is \r\nprepared fully to support your endeavours aimed at \r\nensuring a greater role for our Organization in meeting \r\nthe challenges of today’s world. \r\n I wish also to seize this opportunity to express \r\nour appreciation and support to His Excellency \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his tireless efforts \r\nnot only to realize the objectives for which our \r\nOrganization was created, but also to enable the \r\nOrganization to fulfil the aspirations of the peoples of \r\nthe world in the course of this third millennium. \r\n The global crises, owing to their universal \r\nimpact, multifaceted nature and wide implications, \r\nhave given additional impetus to our collective action \r\nand strengthened coordination among the different \r\nconstituents of this universal body. Today, the world is \r\nfacing recurrent and unprecedented crises in the fields \r\nof economics, finance, food and energy that have \r\nshaken the foundations of universal governance. These \r\ncrises have also adversely affected the socio-economic \r\nand environmental systems of all States, especially in \r\ndeveloping countries. \r\n As the most representative Organization in the \r\nworld, the United Nations embodies the living \r\nconscience of the international community. As such, it \r\nis the most appropriate forum for coordinated joint \r\naction and for the reactivation of collective initiatives \r\nin order to analyse the root causes of such crises and \r\ncontain their impact through the adoption of agreed \r\nsolutions likely to mitigate their effects. Effective and \r\nA/64/PV.9  \r\n \r\n09-52586 50 \r\n \r\nfair economic governance is dependent on the \r\nrevitalization of the multilateral system based on \r\nrealism, efficiency and innovation as a means of \r\nfinding solutions that reflect the aspirations and hopes \r\nof present and future generations. \r\n The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \r\nwere adopted as a common platform for action with \r\nclear objectives and a time frame for their \r\nimplementation, with a view to achieving human \r\ndevelopment in the world. Much progress has been \r\nachieved in many States thanks to the efforts of the \r\ninternational community since the Millennium Summit. \r\nHowever, the progress made towards those goals has \r\nnot been consistent or steady within States or among \r\nStates in general. The negative implications of the \r\ncurrent economic crisis may exacerbate those \r\ndisparities, especially in Africa. The few years that \r\nremain before 2015 thus require us to adopt a \r\ncoordinated global approach and to build real \r\npartnerships in order to mobilize additional financial \r\nresources in line with the commitments made in the \r\nMonterrey Consensus and the Doha Declaration on \r\nFinancing for Development as well as in the \r\ndeclarations of the Group of Eight and the Group of 20. \r\n In this context, Morocco hopes that the fourth \r\nhigh-level meeting on financing for development, to be \r\nheld in November 2009 in New York, will yield results \r\ncommensurate with the expectations of the developing \r\ncountries, thus giving new impetus to efforts to attain \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, thus leading to the \r\nformation of an international alliance for African \r\ndevelopment in the framework of coordinated efforts \r\nand initiatives aimed at achieving the Goals within \r\nspecific time frames. We also hope that the United \r\nNations agencies that are active in the area of \r\ndevelopment will mainstream the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and use them as the main and \r\nappropriate framework for their action. In this context, \r\nthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) \r\nin particular should use the Millennium Development \r\nGoals as practical and comprehensively agreed upon \r\nindicators when drafting its report on human \r\ndevelopment. The MDGs provide a practical and \r\nqualitative, not only quantitative, way to measure \r\nliving that better reflects the ever-evolving concept of \r\ndevelopment. \r\n In keeping with this vision, the National Initiative \r\nfor Human Development, launched in May 2005 by His \r\nMajesty Mohammed VI, constitutes a pillar of \r\nMoroccan social policy. The initiative is based on an \r\nintegrated approach to development in all its aspects — \r\npolitical, economic, social, environmental and cultural. \r\nBy building roads, providing energy services and \r\nencouraging income-generating activities, the Initiative \r\nhas achieved concrete results in fighting poverty and \r\nexclusion, improving infrastructure and de-marginalizing \r\nrural areas. \r\n Collective efforts in the field of development will \r\nremain insufficient unless they are accompanied by \r\ndaring and effective policies for the protection of the \r\nenvironment and concrete measures to mitigate the \r\nimpact of climate change, which now more than ever is \r\nthreatening the future of mankind. In that connection, \r\nMorocco is convinced that the conference on climate \r\nchange to be held in Copenhagen in December will \r\nundoubtedly constitute an important step towards an \r\ninternational agreement on climate. In that regard, \r\nMorocco reiterates the proposal it made at the \r\nconference held at Poznan, Poland, in December 2008 \r\nfor the creation of a multilateral fund for the transfer of \r\ntechnology to the developing countries in order to \r\nenable them to deal with the grave implications of \r\nclimate change. \r\n Mindful of the necessity to operationalize \r\nconcrete measures to protect the environment and \r\ncontain the negative impact of climate change, His \r\nMajesty Mohammed VI instructed the Government to \r\ndraft swiftly a comprehensive national environmental \r\ncharter, with the aim of protecting national resources \r\nand reserves as part of a sustainable development \r\npolicy. The environment should be considered a shared \r\nnational heritage whose protection is the collective \r\nduty of current and future generations. Likewise, \r\nMorocco will reactivate its national energy strategy \r\naimed at the development of renewable energy sources \r\nand the recycling of waste water. \r\n Convinced that the peace process is the only \r\nviable option in the Middle East, the Kingdom of \r\nMorocco has participated constructively and \r\nresponsibly in all efforts of the international \r\ncommunity to relaunch the peace process on solid \r\nfoundations. That means that the process must be in \r\naccordance with resolutions of international legality, \r\nthe previous relevant agreements and commitments \r\namong the parties concerned, and the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative, which as a realistic option reflects the \r\ncollective Arab will to arrive at a just and \r\ncomprehensive solution that guarantees the right of the \r\n A/64/PV.9\r\n \r\n51 09-52586 \r\n \r\nPalestinian people to create their own independent \r\nState, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, an Israeli \r\nwithdrawal from all occupied Arab territories, \r\nincluding Syrian and Lebanese territories, and a stable, \r\nsecure and peaceful existence for all peoples of the \r\nregion. \r\n The Kingdom of Morocco expresses its \r\nappreciation to the United States Administration for its \r\nefforts and for the encouraging positions taken by \r\nPresident Obama. We hope that it will persevere in \r\norder to overcome obstacles to a resumption of \r\nnegotiations. We also commend all other international \r\nefforts, including European efforts, to that end.  \r\n Those efforts will be productive only if Israel \r\nhalts its illegal practices, which prevent the \r\nachievement of peace. Those practices, in particular the \r\nbuilding of settlements in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritories and the unjust blockade against our brotherly \r\nPalestinian people, run counter to the peace option. \r\nThe settlement activities and the expulsions taking \r\nplace in Al-Quds, aimed at altering the legal and \r\ndemographic status of that holy city, are flagrant \r\nviolations of international instruments and require \r\nurgent action on the part of all peace-loving countries.  \r\n In that regard, His Majesty Mohammed VI, in his \r\ncapacity as Chairman of the Al-Quds Committee, has \r\nalways warned the international community against the \r\nrisks associated with altering the legal status of \r\nAl-Quds. He has also been urging the influential \r\ninternational Powers to swiftly implement the \r\nrequirements of international legitimacy in order to \r\npreserve the religious, cultural and spiritual features of \r\nthe holy city in such a way as to create appropriate \r\nconditions conducive to the resumption of the peace \r\nprocess. \r\n The achievement of peace through the peaceful \r\nresolution of conflicts is the essence of the historical \r\nmandate of the United Nations. It should be based on \r\nthe principles of equality among States and respect for \r\ntheir independence and territorial integrity, in \r\naccordance with the Charter of the United Nations. In \r\naddition, there is a need to eliminate all weapons of \r\nmass destruction and to combat terrorism in all its \r\nforms and manifestations.  \r\n As a member of the Peacebuilding Commission, \r\nMorocco will continue its relevant activities, including \r\nby mobilizing efforts in support of African countries. \r\nSuch efforts are being made within the framework of \r\nSouth-South cooperation, with concrete projects, \r\ndefined goals and shared benefits and in keeping with \r\nthe priorities of Moroccan foreign policy as determined \r\nby His Majesty King Mohammed VI. As one of the \r\nfirst active participants in United Nations peacekeeping \r\nmissions, Morocco has always taken a keen interest in \r\nUnited Nations efforts to enhance such operations as \r\npart of the new partnership proposed to adapt to \r\ninternational developments and the requirements for \r\nlasting peace. \r\n Furthermore, recent developments in the area of \r\ndisarmament provide reason for optimism. The \r\npositions expressed and the statements made at the \r\nhighest levels augur well and maintain the momentum \r\nfor disarmament and non-proliferation efforts. We hope \r\nthat efforts will be made at the international and \r\nregional levels for the entry into force of the \r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, given the \r\noutcome of the meeting on article 14 of the Treaty, \r\nwhich I had the honour to co-chair last Thursday with \r\nmy colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nFrance.  \r\n Since its establishment, the United Nations has \r\nendeavoured to promote international and regional \r\ncooperation to uphold the principles of coexistence, \r\npeace, good-neighbourliness and consultation at a time \r\nwhen regional economic gatherings are playing a \r\npivotal role in addressing economic, security and \r\nenvironmental issues. Convinced of that role, Morocco \r\nhas taken a keen interest in promoting good-\r\nneighbourly relations in nearby African, Maghreb and \r\nMediterranean regions. Likewise, Morocco supports \r\nthe Mediterranean Union as a promising framework for \r\nincreasing dialogue and cooperation between the two \r\nsides of the Mediterranean. Moreover, on 4 August \r\n2009, mindful of the important role of the Atlantic \r\nOcean and the opportunities it provides for collective \r\naction, Morocco launched an initiative aimed at \r\ncooperation among African countries bordering the \r\nAtlantic as the basis for a broader partnership with \r\nother coastal countries in that geo-strategic region.  \r\n His Majesty King Mohammad VI has reaffirmed \r\nMorocco’s strong and enduring resolve to contribute in \r\ngood faith to the consolidation of the Arab Maghreb \r\nUnion, the reactivation of its structures and the \r\nstrengthening of relations among its members, \r\nincluding brotherly Algeria. Indeed, that regional body \r\ncould play a central role in building fruitful \r\npartnerships and in ensuring security and stability in \r\nA/64/PV.9  \r\n \r\n09-52586 52 \r\n \r\nAfrica, the Middle East and the Mediterranean. Our \r\nbelief that the Arab Maghreb project must be \r\nreactivated as an embodiment of our peoples’ hopes \r\nand aspirations is in keeping with our sincere desire to \r\nwork to remove all obstacles to the realization of our \r\npeoples’ expectations and the consolidation of \r\nbrotherly relations among its five members.  \r\n In that regard, Morocco has responded \r\nresponsibly and in good faith to the appeals of the \r\nSecurity Council for efforts to find a political, lasting \r\nand negotiated solution to the regional dispute over the \r\nMoroccan Sahara. A bold autonomy initiative, regarded \r\nas serious and credible by the international community, \r\nhas been proposed as a promising and realistic basis for \r\na lasting solution to that artificial conflict. \r\n With the same resolve and responsibility, \r\nMorocco, with the support of the Security Council, has \r\nbeen engaged in the new dynamic resulting from its \r\ninitiative aimed at negotiations under United Nations \r\nsupervision. In its resolutions 1813 (2008) and 1871 \r\n(2009), the Council called for serious and intense \r\nnegotiations in a spirit of compromise and realism with \r\na view to finding a political, lasting and negotiated \r\nsolution that is in keeping with the principle of \r\nself-determination and that cannot be monopolized by \r\nanyone or selectively interpreted to conceal undeclared \r\nobjectives and a hidden agenda. Morocco will continue \r\nits full cooperation with the Secretary-General and his  \r\nPersonal Envoy to find a definitive solution to this \r\nregional dispute that fully respects the sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity of the Kingdom of Morocco and \r\ngrants autonomous status to the population of the \r\nSahara provinces, which is likely to ensure their \r\nprogress and well-being and enable them to manage \r\ntheir domestic affairs in a democratic manner. \r\n The Kingdom of Morocco has always been at the \r\nforefront of international and regional initiatives aimed \r\nat promoting the values of dialogue, tolerance and \r\nopenness to others, especially as they relate to the \r\nnecessary dialogue between Islam and the West and to \r\nrespecting universal human rights standards, as \r\nprevalent as they are all over the world. \r\n Based on those convictions, Morocco will \r\ncontinue to promote its fruitful cooperation and \r\npositive dialogue at the bilateral, regional and global \r\nlevels. Motivated by the same spirit of commitment, \r\nthe Kingdom of Morocco will assume its responsibility \r\nand will play its role fully within the main United \r\nNations bodies, with a view to reinforcing the \r\nOrganization’s efficiency, credibility and contribution. \r\n May the blessings, peace and mercy of Allah be \r\nupon all participants. \r\nThe meeting rose at 2.55 p.m. \r\n"
