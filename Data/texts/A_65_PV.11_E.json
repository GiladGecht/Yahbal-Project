(Switzerland) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 9 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 108 \r\n \r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of the \r\nOrganization (A/65/1) \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): In accordance \r\nwith the decision taken at its 2nd plenary meeting, held \r\non 17 September 2010, the General Assembly will hear \r\na presentation by the Secretary-General of his annual \r\nreport on the work of the Organization, under agenda \r\nitem 108. I now give the floor to the Secretary-General. \r\n The Secretary-General (spoke in French): \r\nWelcome to New York in this beautiful autumn season, \r\nand welcome to the opening of this sixty-fifth general \r\ndebate. \r\n I congratulate you, Mr. President, and I look \r\nforward to working closely with you in the year ahead \r\nacross the full range of challenges facing the \r\ncommunity of nations. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n We, the peoples of the United Nations, are bound \r\nby certain sacred duties and obligations: to care for the \r\nwelfare of others, to resolve conflicts peacefully, to act \r\nin the world with empathy and understanding and to \r\npractise tolerance and mutual respect as a bedrock \r\nprinciple of civilization.  \r\n Today, we are being tested. Social inequalities are \r\ngrowing, among nations and within. Everywhere, \r\npeople live in fear of losing jobs and incomes. Too \r\nmany are caught in conflict; women and children are \r\nbearing the brunt. And we see a new politics at work — \r\na politics of polarization. We hear the language of hate, \r\nfalse divisions between “them” and “us”, those who \r\ninsist on their way or no way. Amid such uncertainty, \r\nso much confusion of purpose, we naturally seek a \r\nmoral compass. At the United Nations, we find the \r\nproper path in community, global cause, fair decisions \r\nand mutual responsibility for a destiny we share. \r\n This is the soul of global governance, the theme \r\nof this General Assembly: a collective stand, principled \r\nand pragmatic, against forces that would divide us. \r\nAnd that is why the United Nations remains the \r\nindispensable global institution for the twenty-first \r\ncentury. As we gather today, in solidarity, let us \r\nrecognize that this is a season for pulling together, for \r\nconsolidating progress and for putting our shoulder to \r\nthe wheel and delivering results — real results for \r\npeople most in need — as only the United Nations can \r\ndo. \r\n Together, over the past three years, we embraced \r\nan ambitious agenda, framed by three overarching \r\nideas for our time: a more prosperous world, free of the \r\ndeepest poverty; a cleaner, greener and more \r\nsustainable world for our children; and a safer world, \r\nfree of nuclear weapons. Those are the great challenges \r\nof our era. They are not dreams; they are opportunities \r\nwithin our power to grasp. \r\n Together, we have made progress. We will press \r\nahead with fresh thinking, fresh approaches, a strong \r\nsense of leadership and political will. The Millennium \r\nA/65/PV.11  \r\n \r\n10-54827 2 \r\n \r\nDevelopment Goals summit showed our collective \r\ndetermination. World leaders came together with \r\nconcrete national plans to meet the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals by 2015. They agreed on a \r\nresponsible and mutually accountable partnership, a \r\npartnership that will better the lives of billions of \r\npeople within our generation. Our challenge is to \r\ndeliver on this promise, to turn hopes into realities. \r\n We must draw on lessons learned over the past \r\ndecade: helping people to help themselves; investing \r\nresources where they have the greatest effect — smart \r\ninvestment in education, decent work, health, \r\nsmallholder agriculture, infrastructure and green \r\nenergy; realizing the importance of putting women at \r\nthe fore. \r\n That is why, at the summit, I welcomed the \r\nendorsement of our Global Strategy for Women and \r\nChildren’s Health. Backed by billions of dollars in new \r\ncommitments from Governments, business, \r\nnon-governmental organizations and philanthropic \r\norganizations, this was a tangible expression of global \r\nsolidarity. \r\n That is also why, last week, I named a dynamic \r\nnew head of the United Nations Entity for Gender \r\nEquality and the Empowerment of Women. In Michelle \r\nBachelet, the former President of Chile, we found a \r\nglobal leader who can inspire billions of women and \r\ngirls around the world. We must support her to the \r\nutmost, because by empowering women, we empower \r\nsocieties. \r\n Three years ago, we called climate change the \r\ndefining challenge of our era, and so it remains. \r\nClearly, the road towards a comprehensive binding \r\nagreement in Cancunand beyond will not be easy. And \r\nyet, we have made progress, and we can make more.  \r\n This is a year to build on important areas of \r\nagreement — on financing for adaptation and \r\nmitigation, on technology transfer, on capacity-\r\nbuilding and on preventing deforestation. In the longer \r\nterm, we face the 50-50-50 challenge. By 2050, the \r\nworld’s population will grow by 50 per cent. To keep \r\nclimate change in check, we will need to cut \r\ngreenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent by then.  \r\n The world looks to us for creative solutions. And \r\nthat is why, on Sunday, we hosted the first meeting of \r\nthe High-level Panel on Global Sustainability. I am \r\nconfident that it will stimulate new thinking as we \r\nwork towards Rio+20 in 2012. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n On nuclear disarmament as well, we see new \r\nmomentum, namely, a new START agreement, the \r\nSummit on Nuclear Security and a successful Review \r\nConference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons. Our role is to keep pushing to find a \r\npath to bring the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban \r\nTreaty into force and to realize agreements on fissile \r\nmaterials and on securing nuclear materials and \r\nfacilities. Tomorrow, we will host a High-level Meeting \r\non Revitalizing the Work of the Conference on \r\nDisarmament. I believe the next few years will be \r\ncritical. Will we advance our work on non-proliferation \r\nand disarmament, or will we slide back? It is up to us. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n As always, over the past year we were there for \r\nthose in urgent need: the people of Pakistan, coping \r\nwith epic floods and the monumental task of \r\nreconstruction; the people of Haiti, where the work of \r\nrebuilding goes on, and where so many lost their lives, \r\nincluding 101 of our colleagues; and the people of \r\nSomalia, the Sudan, the Niger and Gaza. \r\n As always, we continue to work for peace and \r\nsecurity. Three years ago, in partnership with the \r\nAfrican Union, we deployed the first peacekeeping \r\nforce in Darfur. During the coming year, the United \r\nNations will be critical to keeping a larger peace, as \r\nnorth and south Sudan decide their future. Tomorrow’s \r\nhigh-level meeting on the Sudan will help chart that \r\npath. \r\n In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we \r\nhave adapted our Mission to new and changing \r\ncircumstances.We have worked closely with the \r\nAfrican Union in Somalia.We have seen victories for \r\npreventive diplomacy, as well. In Iraq, we helped \r\nbroker the compromises that kept this year’s elections \r\non track. In Guinea, we stand with regional partners in \r\ninsisting on democracy. In Sierra Leone, we helped to \r\ndefuse confrontations and keep peace moving forward. \r\nQuick-footed diplomacy helped contain the troubles in \r\nKyrgyzstan. In Afghanistan, we carry on our work \r\ndespite exceptionally difficult security and \r\nhumanitarian conditions. We will seek to reduce \r\ntensions on the Korean peninsula and encourage the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea to return to the \r\n A/65/PV.11\r\n \r\n3 10-54827 \r\n \r\nSix-Party Talks. On Iran, we continue to urge the \r\nGovernment to engage constructively with the \r\ninternational community and comply fully with the \r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions.  \r\n In the Middle East, we see encouraging \r\nmovement towards a comprehensive peace. Working \r\nwith the Quartet, we will do everything possible to \r\nhelp bring negotiations to a successful conclusion. I \r\nstrongly discourage either side from any action that \r\nwould hold back progress. \r\n In all we do, human rights are at the core. There \r\ncan be no peace without justice. The global community \r\nhas worked hard and long to usher in a new age of \r\naccountability. In our modern era, let us send a clear \r\nmessage: no nation, large or small, can violate the \r\nrights of its citizens with impunity. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n Let me close on a theme that has defined our \r\nwork together: building a stronger United Nations for a \r\nbetter world. The renovation of the Secretariat is on \r\ntrack, on schedule and on budget. Organizational \r\nchanges introduced over the past few years are bearing \r\nfruit. Among them is the New Horizons Initiative to \r\nstreamline peacekeeping operations. In consultation \r\nwith the Member States and our staff, we will do all in \r\nour power to create a faster, more modern, flexible and \r\neffective United Nations work force by recruiting the \r\nbest talent of tomorrow. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n Today and in the months ahead, we will speak of \r\nmany things, important issues affecting all humankind. \r\nLet us remember, in these difficult times, that we are \r\nbeing tested. Let us remember the many lives lost in \r\nservice to our ideals. Let us remember that the world \r\nstill looks to the United Nations for moral and political \r\nleadership. The great goals are within reach. We can \r\nachieve them by looking forward, pulling together and \r\nuniting our strength as a community of nations in the \r\nname of the larger good. I count on your leadership and \r\ncommitment. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his presentation. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): For my \r\nintroductory remarks, I have chosen the theme “A \r\nstrong, inclusive and open United Nations as the \r\nguarantor of global governance”. \r\n As we open the general debate of the sixty-fifth \r\nsession, we already have a week of intensive work \r\nbehind us. I would like to thank the General Assembly \r\nfor its contribution to the success of the High-level \r\nPlenary Meeting on the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. By reaffirming its determination to overcome \r\npoverty and suffering throughout the world, the \r\ninternational community that you here represent has \r\nsent a strong message to the whole of humankind. \r\n Much remains to be done. We must reaffirm our \r\nresolve. We know that additional efforts are needed. \r\nWe have an action plan; now we must implement it. To \r\nsucceed, we need a genuine global partnership, born of \r\ninclusive global governance, in which all stakeholders \r\ncan make themselves heard.  \r\n But this global partnership is needed in many \r\nother areas too. Our world is now more interdependent \r\nand more interconnected, and it faces global challenges \r\nthat affect all countries and their citizens, whether they \r\nlike it or not and regardless of who is responsible.  \r\n Current realities provide all too many examples \r\nof this. Poverty, conflicts, global warming, the \r\neconomic and financial crisis, migration, pandemics, \r\nterrorism, international crime and a whole range of \r\nother issues have consequences that cannot be managed \r\nat an individual level, and which humankind can \r\naddress only through common global strategies. \r\n In establishing such a global partnership, we \r\ncome up against the difficulty of building consensus on \r\nthe action to be taken. It is for that reason that I have \r\nchosen global governance or, more specifically, \r\n“Reaffirming the central role of the United Nations in \r\nglobal governance”, as the suggested theme of our \r\ngeneral debate. \r\n The United Nations has unique legitimacy to play \r\na central role. With its 192 Member States, the General \r\nAssembly is a near-universal body and reflects the \r\ndiversity of the situations and interests at stake. It is \r\nthere to promote the rights of every woman and man on \r\nA/65/PV.11  \r\n \r\n10-54827 4 \r\n \r\nour planet. Any matters within the scope of the Charter \r\nmay be discussed by the General Assembly. \r\n The United Nations, as an operational entity, also \r\nhas the expertise and the presence on the ground to \r\nplay that central role. I am thinking in particular of its \r\npeacekeeping missions, humanitarian operations and \r\nnatural-disaster-response activities, as well as all the \r\nwork carried out far from the media spotlight. I would \r\nlike to take this opportunity to thank the thousands of \r\nUnited Nations staff members who, with great \r\ncommitment and often at risk to life and limb, work to \r\npromote peace and prosperity around the world. We \r\nowe them our sincere appreciation on behalf of all \r\nthose who enjoy a better life thanks to their \r\nendeavours. \r\n However, there is a danger that the United \r\nNations could be marginalized as other actors emerge \r\non the international scene. The United Nations has \r\nbeen criticized for not being effective or efficient \r\nenough. Determining urgent action through a more \r\nrestricted forum can seem easier and more expeditious. \r\nThis much should be clear: the point is not to deny the \r\nrole of such entities as the Group of 20. The economic \r\nand financial crisis has highlighted the importance of a \r\nrapid and coordinated response. However, there is a \r\nvital and pressing need to bridge the efforts of different \r\nactors. The mechanisms for communication, \r\nconsultation and cooperation between those entities \r\nand other States must be improved. Only the United \r\nNations and its General Assembly can do so. \r\n In order for the United Nations to \r\ncomprehensively fulfil its global governance role, we \r\nmust press for it to be strong, inclusive and open. A \r\nclose connection must be established between States \r\nand the private sector, civil society and regional actors. \r\nWe must listen to other key actors and interact with \r\nthem outside the Assembly. \r\n A strong United Nations requires a decisive effort \r\nto reform the Organization and, in particular, to \r\nrevitalize the General Assembly, reform the Security \r\nCouncil and review the work of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil and the Peacebuilding Commission. We must \r\nalso strengthen the economic organizations of the \r\nUnited Nations, enabling them fully to serve the \r\npurpose for which they were established. Lastly, it is \r\nup to Member States to make the United Nations a \r\nstrong instrument that can take centre stage in \r\nconfronting global challenges. \r\n In the course of the general debate, I invite \r\nmembers to share their views on inclusive global \r\ngovernance. Numerous issues await urgent action. \r\nNumerous wars, disasters and tragedies have persisted \r\nfor too long to allow any delay. The world expects us \r\nto be more effective in uniting around actions that \r\nenjoy universal endorsement and commitment. We \r\nmust develop the best possible linkage between \r\nlegitimacy and effectiveness. As President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, I intend to convene informal \r\nmeetings on this topic. \r\n Having suggested some avenues for discussion, I \r\nwish to listen to members. It is now up to you, the \r\nleaders of the world as a whole, to take a stand and \r\nproclaim that too many problems and scourges have \r\npersisted for too long, and together determine \r\nmilestones leading to a global partnership in which all \r\nforces will be united and all countries will feel \r\nincluded in joint effective action for a better world. We \r\nmust also have the courage to debate difficult \r\nquestions, but we must do so in a spirit of friendship \r\nand openness. \r\n Before giving the floor to the first speaker for this \r\nmorning, I would like to remind Member States that \r\nthe list of speakers for the general debate has been \r\nestablished on the agreed basis that statements should \r\nbe no longer than 15 minutes, so as to enable all \r\nspeakers to be heard at a given meeting. I should like \r\nto appeal to all speakers to deliver their statements at a \r\nnormal speed so that proper interpretation in the six \r\nofficial United Nations languages can be provided. \r\n I would also like to draw members’ attention to \r\nthe decision taken by the Assembly at previous \r\nsessions, namely, that the practice of expressing \r\ncongratulations inside the General Assembly Hall after \r\na speech has been delivered is strongly discouraged. In \r\nthat connection, I would like to remind members that, \r\nafter delivering their statements, speakers are kindly \r\ninvited to exit the General Assembly Hall through what \r\nis known as the Swiss Room, or GA-200, which is \r\nlocated behind the podium, before returning to their \r\nseats. \r\n May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to \r\nproceed in the same manner during the general debate \r\nof the sixth-fifth session? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n A/65/PV.11\r\n \r\n5 10-54827 \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): Finally, I \r\nshould like to draw the attention of members to the fact \r\nthat, during the general debate, official photographs of \r\nall speakers are taken by the Department of Public \r\nInformation. Members interested in obtaining these \r\nphotographs are kindly requested to contact the Photo \r\nLibrary of the United Nations. \r\n I now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Celso \r\nLuiz Nunes Amorim, Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nBrazil. \r\n Mr. Amorim (spoke in Portuguese; English text \r\nprovided by the delegation): It is a great honour for me \r\nto come to this rostrum to speak on behalf of the \r\npeople and Government of Brazil. I bring the greetings \r\nof President Lula.  \r\n Within days, over 130 million Brazilians will go \r\nto the polls and will write another important chapter in \r\nthe history of our democracy. During President Lula’s \r\ntwo terms, Brazil has changed. Sustained economic \r\ngrowth, financial stability, social inclusion and the full \r\nexercise of democracy have converged and reinforced \r\neach another. Over 20 million Brazilians rose out of \r\npoverty, and many others out of extreme poverty. \r\nNearly 30 million people joined the middle class. \r\n Strong and transparent public policies reduced \r\ninequalities in income, access and opportunities. \r\nMillions of Brazilians rose to dignity and real \r\ncitizenship. The strengthened domestic market \r\nprotected us from the worst effects of the global crisis \r\nset in motion by the financial casino in the richest \r\ncountries in the world. \r\n Brazil is proud to have achieved almost all of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and to be well on the \r\nway to meeting them all by 2015. The inability of any \r\ncountry to achieve those Goals must be seen as a \r\nfailure of the entire international community. The \r\npromotion of development is a collective responsibility. \r\nBrazil has been working to assist other countries to \r\nreplicate its successful experiences. In the past years \r\nBrazil’s actions on the international stage have been \r\ndriven by a sense of solidarity. We are convinced that it \r\nis possible to have a humanistic foreign policy without \r\nlosing sight of national interests. That policy is \r\nsupported by South-South cooperation. The IBSA \r\nFacility for Poverty and Hunger Alleviation, created by \r\nIndia, Brazil and South Africa, finances projects in \r\nHaiti, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, Palestine, \r\nCambodia, Burundi, Laos and Sierra Leone. Brazil has \r\nsubstantially increased its humanitarian aid and the \r\nnumber of its cooperation projects with poorer \r\ncountries.  \r\n Africa occupies a very special place in Brazilian \r\ndiplomacy. Since taking office, President Lula has been \r\nto Africa 11 times and visited over 20 countries in the \r\ncontinent. We have set up an agricultural research \r\noffice in Ghana, a model cotton farm in Mali, a \r\nmanufacturing plant for antiretroviral drugs in \r\nMozambique and professional training centres in five \r\nAfrican countries. Through trade and investment, we \r\nare helping the African continent to develop its \r\nenormous potential and reduce its dependency on a few \r\ncentres of political and economic power. \r\n Brazil is particularly concerned about Guinea-\r\nBissau. It is not by isolating or abandoning Guinea-\r\nBissau that the international community will help it \r\naddress the challenges it still faces. We need intelligent \r\nmodalities for cooperation, which can promote \r\ndevelopment and stability and encourage the necessary \r\nreforms, especially with regard to the armed forces. \r\n This year, in which a significant number of \r\nAfrican countries celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of \r\ntheir decolonization, Brazil renews its commitment to \r\nan independent, prosperous, just and democratic \r\nAfrica. \r\n There are few places where international \r\nsolidarity is more needed than Haiti. We joined the \r\nUnited Nations in mourning the tragedy that took the \r\nlives of hundreds of thousands of Haitians. We \r\nourselves lost great Brazilians, including Dr. Zilda \r\nArns — a woman who dedicated her life to the poor, \r\nespecially children — Mr. Luiz Carlos da Costa, \r\nDeputy Head of the United Nations Stabilization \r\nMission in Haiti, and 18 of our peacekeepers. \r\n We would like to express our compassion for the \r\nsuffering of the Haitian people and, above all, our \r\nadmiration for the stoicism and courage with which \r\nthey have been facing adversity. The Haitian people \r\nknow that they can count on Brazil to not only help \r\nthem maintain order and defend democracy, but also \r\nassist in their development. We are keeping our \r\npromises and will keep a watchful eye on the situation \r\nto ensure that the commitments of the international \r\ncommunity go beyond rhetorical statements. \r\nA/65/PV.11  \r\n \r\n10-54827 6 \r\n \r\n In recent years, the Brazilian Government has \r\ninvested heavily in South America’s integration and \r\npeace. We have strengthened our strategic partnership \r\nwith Argentina. We have reinforced MERCOSUR, \r\nincluding through financial mechanisms unique among \r\ndeveloping countries. \r\n The establishment of the Union of South \r\nAmerican Nations (UNASUR) aims at consolidating a \r\ngenuine zone of peace and prosperity. UNASUR has \r\nalready demonstrated its value in promoting \r\nunderstanding and the peaceful resolution of conflicts \r\namong and within countries in South America and has \r\nmade foreign interference in our region even more \r\nunwarranted. By creating the Community of Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean States, launched in Bahia, \r\nBrazil and confirmed in Cancún, Mexico, we have \r\nreaffirmed the region’s willingness to extend to Central \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean the integrationist ideals \r\nthat animate South Americans. \r\n Brazil reiterates its condemnation, shared by all \r\nin Latin America and the Caribbean, of the illegitimate \r\nembargo against Cuba. Its sole result has been to \r\nhamper the efforts of millions of Cubans in their \r\nstruggle for development. \r\n We condemn anti-democratic moves, such as the \r\ncoup d’état in Honduras. The return of former \r\nPresident Zelaya without threats to his freedom is \r\nindispensable for the full normalization of Honduras’ \r\nrelations with the region as a whole. \r\n When President Lula first spoke in this Hall, in \r\n2003, the world lived under the shadow of the invasion \r\nof Iraq. We hope we have learned the lessons of that \r\nepisode. Blind faith in intelligence reports tailored to \r\njustify political goals must be rejected. We must ban \r\nonce and for all the use of force that is inconsistent \r\nwith international law. Furthermore, it is fundamental \r\nto value and promote dialogue and the peaceful \r\nresolution of disputes. \r\n In order to achieve a truly secure world, the \r\npromise of the total elimination of nuclear weapons \r\nmust be fulfilled. Unilateral reductions are welcome \r\nbut insufficient, especially when they occur in tandem \r\nwith the modernization of nuclear arsenals. \r\n As President Lula has often stated, \r\nmultilateralism is the international face of democracy. \r\nThe United Nations must be the main center of \r\ndecision-making in international politics.  \r\n The changes that have occurred in the world over \r\nthe past few decades and the series of crises we have \r\nfaced in food security, climate change, the economic \r\nand financial sphere and peace and security make it \r\nurgent to redefine the rules that govern international \r\nrelations. \r\n The financial crisis of 2008 accelerated change in \r\nglobal economic governance. The Group of Twenty \r\n(G-20) replaced the Group of Eight as the primary \r\nforum for deliberation on economic issues. The G-20 \r\nwas a step forward, but it must be adjusted to ensure, \r\nfor instance, greater African participation. The \r\nrelevance and legitimacy of the G-20 can be preserved \r\nonly if it maintains frank and permanent dialogue with \r\nall the nations represented in this General Assembly. \r\n At the height of the crisis, we succeeded in \r\navoiding the worst-case scenario: a surge of \r\nuncontrolled protectionism, which would have thrown \r\nthe world into a deep depression. But the developed \r\ncountries have not demonstrated the necessary \r\ncommitment to global economic stability. They \r\ncontinue to let themselves be guided by parochial \r\ninterests. Nowhere is that more evident than in the \r\nDoha round of negotiations in the World Trade \r\nOrganization. A balanced solution to that negotiating \r\nprocess, which has lasted for almost 10 years, would \r\npromote economic expansion and the development of \r\nthe poorest countries, with the end of distorting \r\nsubsidies and protectionist barriers. After all, poor \r\ncountries are the greatest victims of the narrow and \r\nselfish view that still prevails in international trade. \r\n Reforms have also been insufficient in the \r\nfinancial sector. Unjustified resistance is preventing the \r\nimplementation of agreed-upon changes. Obstinacy in \r\nmaintaining anachronistic privileges perpetuates and \r\ndeepens the illegitimacy of institutions. \r\n Another major challenge we face is achieving a \r\nglobal, comprehensive and ambitious agreement on \r\nclimate change. In order to move forward on this \r\nmatter, countries must stop hiding behind each other. \r\nBrazil, like other developing countries, has done its \r\npart. But in Copenhagen, several delegations, \r\nespecially from the rich world, sought excuses to evade \r\ntheir moral and political obligations. They forgot that \r\none cannot negotiate with Nature. \r\n A positive outcome of the sixteenth Conference \r\nof the Parties to the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change, with real progress in \r\n A/65/PV.11\r\n \r\n7 10-54827 \r\n \r\nforests, financing for adaptation and mitigation and a \r\nreaffirmation of the Kyoto commitments, is \r\nindispensable. The Mexican presidency can count on \r\nBrazil’s engagement to achieve this objective. \r\n In 2012, we will host, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, \r\nthe Rio+20 Conference. On behalf of the Brazilian \r\nGovernment, I invite all delegations to fulfill the \r\npromise of truly sustainable development. \r\n The reform of global governance has not yet \r\nreached the field of international peace and security. In \r\nthe economic and environmental areas, the wealthiest \r\nnations have already understood that they cannot do \r\nwithout the cooperation of the poor and emerging \r\ncountries. When it comes to war and peace, however, \r\nthe traditional players are reluctant to share power. \r\n The Security Council must be reformed and \r\nexpanded to allow for greater participation by \r\ndeveloping countries, including as permanent \r\nmembers. We cannot continue with working methods \r\nthat lack transparency and that allow the permanent \r\nmembers to discuss behind closed doors and for as \r\nlong as they wish issues that concern all mankind. \r\n Brazil has sought to live up to what is expected \r\nfrom all Security Council members, including non-\r\npermanent ones — namely, that they contribute to \r\npeace. For this reason, we made a serious effort to find \r\nan instrument that could enable progress towards a \r\nsolution of the Iranian nuclear question. In so doing, \r\nwe relied on proposals that had been presented as a \r\nunique opportunity to build confidence between the \r\nparties. The Tehran Declaration of 17 May, signed by \r\nBrazil, Turkey and Iran, removed obstacles that, \r\naccording to the very authors of those proposals, had \r\npreviously prevented an agreement. \r\n The Tehran Declaration does not exhaust the \r\nissue and was never intended to do so. We are \r\nconvinced that, once back to the negotiating table, the \r\nparties will find ways to resolve other issues, such as \r\n20 per cent enrichment and the stock of enriched \r\nuranium accumulated since October 2009. In spite of \r\nthe sanctions, we still hope that the logic of dialogue \r\nand understanding will prevail. The world cannot run \r\nthe risk of a new conflict like the one in Iraq. We have \r\nbeen insisting, therefore, that the Iranian Government \r\nmaintain an attitude of flexibility and openness towards \r\nnegotiations, but it is necessary that all those \r\nconcerned also demonstrate such willingness. \r\n We are closely following developments in the \r\npeace process in the Middle East. We hope the direct \r\ntalks between Palestinians and Israelis launched earlier \r\nthis month will produce concrete results that lead to the \r\ncreation of a Palestinian State within the pre-1967 \r\nborders, a State that ensures for the Palestinian people \r\na dignified life, co-existing side by side and in peace \r\nwith the State of Israel. \r\n However, it is not the format of the dialogue that \r\nwill determine whether it will yield results. What \r\nmatters is the willingness of the parties to reach a just \r\nand lasting peace. That will be easier with the \r\ninvolvement of all those concerned. Freezing the \r\nconstruction of settlements in the occupied territories, \r\nlifting the Gaza blockade and ending attacks against \r\ncivilian populations are crucial elements in the process. \r\n In his visit to Israel, Palestine and Jordan in \r\nMarch, President Lula spoke with government leaders \r\nand representatives of civil society about those issues. \r\nWe frequently receive in Brasilia the leaders of various \r\ncountries of the region, who seek support in resolving \r\nproblems that have afflicted them for decades and have \r\nnot been solved through the traditional means and \r\nactors. Brazil, which has about 10 million people of \r\nArab descent and a sizeable Jewish community living \r\ntogether in harmony, will not shy away from making its \r\ncontribution to the peace that we all yearn for. \r\n Brazil’s commitment to the promotion of human \r\nrights is also unwavering. We favour a non-selective, \r\nobjective and multilateral treatment of human rights, \r\nwithout politicization or bias, in which everyone — the \r\nrich and the poor, the powerful and the weak — is \r\nsubject to the same scrutiny. In our view, the exercise \r\nof human rights is more effectively ensured by \r\ndialogue and cooperation than by arrogant attitudes \r\nderived from self-declared moral superiority. \r\n During his eight years in office, President Lula \r\nhas developed a foreign policy that is independent, free \r\nof any sort of submission, and respectful of Brazil’s \r\nneighbours and partners. It is an innovative foreign \r\npolicy, which does not distance itself from the \r\nfundamental values of the Brazilian nation: peace, \r\npluralism, tolerance and solidarity. \r\n Just as Brazil has changed and will continue to \r\nchange, the world is also changing. We must deepen \r\nand accelerate this process. With the technology and \r\nwealth at our disposal, there is no longer any \r\njustification for hunger, poverty and epidemics of \r\nA/65/PV.11  \r\n \r\n10-54827 8 \r\n \r\npreventable diseases. We can no longer live with \r\ndiscrimination, injustice and authoritarianism. We must \r\nface the challenges of nuclear disarmament, sustainable \r\ndevelopment and freer and fairer trade. Rest assured, \r\nBrazil will continue to fight to make these ideals a \r\nreality. \r\n \r\nAddress by Ms. Doris Leuthard, President of the \r\nSwiss Confederation \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the Swiss \r\nConfederation.  \r\n To be clear: Switzerland, in taking this time slot, \r\nis not presenting itself as a new world Power. The \r\nPresident of the United States of America is not yet \r\nable to arrive in the Assembly Hall, and Switzerland \r\nhas thus made itself available to fill the slot that is free \r\nas a result. \r\n Ms. Doris Leuthard, President of the Swiss \r\nConfederation, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations Her Excellency Ms. Doris \r\nLeuthard, President of the Swiss Confederation, and to \r\ninvite her to address the Assembly. \r\n President Leuthard (spoke in French): It is a \r\ngreat honour for me to address, on behalf of \r\nSwitzerland, the General Assembly, which this year is \r\npresided over by my compatriot, Mr. Joseph Deiss. I \r\nwould like to take this opportunity to congratulate the \r\nPresident on his election. His election is a great honour \r\nfor Switzerland and is not only a personal recognition \r\nof President Deiss and his work but also of our \r\ncountry’s commitment to the United Nations as a \r\nmember of the Organization and a defender of \r\nmultilateralism. \r\n We find ourselves today in a building that is \r\nundergoing renovations. The architectural makeover of \r\nthe United Nations prompts me to ask: what kind of \r\nUnited Nations are we building for the next 10, 20 or \r\n30 years? We need a United Nations that can face the \r\nchallenges of the future for the good of all. We need a \r\nUnited Nations that will contribute effectively to \r\nsolving the world’s problems. We need Member States \r\nthat are ready to take full responsibility for building a \r\nbetter world. \r\n The future of the United Nations must reflect the \r\nworld of tomorrow. Today, nearly one billion people \r\nare still malnourished. There will be many more people \r\nsharing this planet in the future, and no doubt we will \r\nhave to make do with fewer resources. Thanks to new \r\ndevelopments in technology and information, our \r\ncitizens participate more directly in the challenges \r\nfacing our societies. They are increasingly better \r\ninformed and feel that at least some of the legitimacy \r\nof this universal Organization depends on its ability to \r\nrespond effectively to those challenges. They demand \r\naccountability. \r\n In a more globalized world, we must treasure and \r\ndefend the principles of the United Nations Charter. We \r\nmust take care to ensure the proper functioning of this \r\ncommon structure in a spirit of solidarity, respect and \r\nresponsibility. \r\n A strong international community requires \r\nsolidarity. That means more than providing assistance \r\nto countries when they are unable to help their own \r\ncitizens. It also means reminding States of the \r\nresponsibilities they have towards their own people in \r\nareas such as security, the rule of law, human rights \r\nand democracy, and all that in respect for the United \r\nNations Charter. Every woman, every man, every \r\ncitizen must make his and her contribution to the \r\nstructure we are building together. At the same time \r\nevery Member State must be able to place its national \r\ninterests second to the common good. That is the only \r\nway we will be able to find solutions that are in \r\neveryone’s interest.  \r\n Every day we are reminded of the growing and \r\nincreasingly complex global challenges confronting us: \r\nthe economic and financial crisis, climate change, \r\nenergy and food security, development and poverty, \r\nand peace and security. The search for sustainable \r\nsolutions to those challenges calls for real governance, \r\ngovernance, moreover, that must reflect the new \r\nrealities in the world. The new-found prosperity of \r\nsome must go hand in hand with new responsibilities. \r\nStates whose economic success enables them to play a \r\nmore active role in the governance of the world must \r\naccept the new responsibilities that go with that active \r\nrole. \r\n The United Nations enjoys a unique legitimacy \r\nbecause of its universal membership. Its legitimacy \r\nalso derives from the issues it addresses, which \r\nconcern us all. This week’s agenda is the best possible \r\n A/65/PV.11\r\n \r\n9 10-54827 \r\n \r\nproof. But the legitimacy of an organization also \r\ndepends on its performance and its ability to respond to \r\nthe expectations placed on it.  \r\n By that standard the United Nations sometimes \r\ndelivers mixed results. At times it seems ill-equipped \r\nand hesitant to act. The power derived from universal \r\nmembership becomes a burden when we Member \r\nStates are divided. Our debates should not be limited to \r\nthe lowest common denominator. They must lead to \r\naction and to results in the interest of the common \r\ngood of humanity. \r\n If the United Nations fails to act, other groups \r\nrepresenting only a fraction of the countries of the \r\nworld will step in, zealous for effective action, and \r\nplay a central role in global governance. As far as \r\nSwitzerland is concerned, such groups lack legitimacy \r\nby virtue of their limited composition. It is therefore \r\ncrucial for the United Nations and its principal organs \r\nto remain at the centre of world governance. That is \r\nwhy we must take care to ensure that the legitimacy of \r\nthis universal body does not suffer from a lack of \r\nefficiency. To make progress in building a better world, \r\nit is our collective responsibility to meet a global \r\nchallenge with a global response. Switzerland wants to \r\ncontribute to this joint effort. \r\n Concerted global action is required in the \r\nfollowing areas.  \r\n The Millennium Development Goals must be \r\nimplemented rapidly and fully. We know that dropping \r\na sack of rice from a helicopter is not enough. We must \r\ninstead teach people how to grow rice. Still today, \r\n1.4 billion people around the world are living in \r\nextreme poverty. Every day too many mothers and \r\nchildren die of malnutrition and lack of care. We know \r\nthat huge financial means are needed after a disaster. \r\nMoney flows in emergency situations, but who is still \r\nconcerned three years later? Who is involved in the \r\nreconstruction? \r\n Binding objectives must be defined as quickly as \r\npossible for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. \r\nNowadays, we have knowledge and we have clean and \r\ngreen technology. We must take action, each nation \r\nwith measures aimed at its own targets. Waiting for the \r\nindustrialized countries to invest in the South will not \r\nlead anywhere. Here too, all must fulfil their own \r\nresponsibilities. This year in Mexico we still have an \r\nopportunity to make progress. The recent natural \r\ndisasters are unmistakable signs. Switzerland will \r\nreduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by \r\nthe year 2020.  \r\n Thirty years after the Cold War, the proliferation \r\nof weapons of mass destruction remains a grave threat \r\nto peace and security. But for civilian populations, the \r\nreal devastation is caused by small arms and light \r\nweapons. Terrorists benefit from that situation by \r\neasily supplying themselves in the arms market. \r\nSwitzerland, together with other countries, is \r\nsupporting the full implementation of the United \r\nNations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. That \r\ninitiative provides for the involvement of specialists in \r\nhumanitarian aid and education. \r\n Gender equality must at last become a reality. \r\nAccess to education and health for women and girls \r\nhas been restricted for decades. More than others, they \r\nhave been victims of poverty. They have also been the \r\ntargets of systematic violence in armed conflicts. It is \r\nhigh time to make full use of their potential in \r\nmediation and reconstruction in countries affected by \r\nconflict. In that context, Switzerland welcomes the \r\ncreation of the United Nations Entity for Gender \r\nEquality and the Empowerment of Women — UN \r\nWomen — which brings us closer to the fulfilment of \r\nthis vision. \r\n We must avoid making the United Nations an \r\nimmutable historic monument, but rather turn it into a \r\ndynamic organization. The United Nations is the only \r\norganization in the world with the legitimacy to \r\nrepresent all nations and all peoples. It is the only \r\nlegitimate organization in the world capable of \r\nnarrowing differences and restoring a balance between \r\nregions.  \r\n For that to happen, however, every Member State \r\nmust accept its responsibilities and start with the task \r\nof putting its own house in order. Discussion and \r\npreparing reports are not enough, however; we need to \r\nact. Each Member State must commit itself clearly \r\nwithin the Organization to respond to the urgent \r\nquestions facing the world of today and of tomorrow. \r\nSuch commitments will strengthen confidence in the \r\nUnited Nations and its credibility.  \r\n Switzerland remains firmly convinced of the \r\naptness of a multilateral approach, with the United \r\nNations at its centre. With the contributions of \r\neveryone in this Hall today we will be able to create a \r\nmore just, peaceful and prosperous world. I thank all \r\nwho are gathered here for their collective commitment. \r\nA/65/PV.11  \r\n \r\n10-54827 10 \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Swiss Confederation for the statement she has just \r\nmade. \r\n  Ms. Doris Leuthard, President of the Swiss \r\nConfederation, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Barack Obama, President of the \r\nUnited States of America \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the United \r\nStates of America. \r\n  Mr. Barack Obama, President of the United States \r\nof America, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Barack Obama, \r\nPresident of the United States of America, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly.  \r\n President Obama: It is a great honour to address \r\nthis Assembly for the second time, nearly two years \r\nafter my election as President of the United States. We \r\nknow this is no ordinary time for our people. We each \r\ncome here with our own problems and priorities. But \r\nthere are also challenges that we share in common as \r\nleaders and as nations. \r\n We meet within an institution built from the \r\nrubble of war, designed to unite the world in pursuit of \r\npeace. And we meet within a city that for centuries has \r\nwelcomed people from across the globe, demonstrating \r\nthat individuals of every colour, faith and station can \r\ncome together to pursue opportunity, build a \r\ncommunity and live with the blessing of human liberty. \r\n Outside the doors of this Hall, the blocks and \r\nneighbourhoods of this great city tell the story of a \r\ndifficult decade. Nine years ago, the destruction of the \r\nWorld Trade Center signalled a threat that respected no \r\nboundary of dignity or decency. Two years ago this \r\nmonth, a financial crisis on Wall Street devastated \r\nAmerican families on Main Street. These separate \r\nchallenges have affected people around the world. Men \r\nand women and children have been murdered by \r\nextremists from Casablanca to London, from Jalalabad \r\nto Jakarta. The global economy suffered an enormous \r\nblow during the financial crisis, crippling markets and \r\ndeferring the dreams of millions on every continent. \r\nUnderneath these challenges to our security and \r\nprosperity lie deeper fears: that ancient hatreds and \r\nreligious divides are once again ascendant; that a world \r\nwhich has grown more interconnected has somehow \r\nslipped beyond our control. \r\n These are some of the challenges that my \r\nAdministration has confronted since we came into \r\noffice. And today, I would like to talk to the Assembly \r\nabout what we have done over the last 20 months to \r\nmeet these challenges; what our responsibility is to \r\npursue peace in the Middle East; and what kind of \r\nworld we are trying to build in this twenty-first \r\ncentury. \r\n Let me begin with what we have done. I have had \r\nno greater focus as President than rescuing our \r\neconomy from potential catastrophe. And in an age \r\nwhen prosperity is shared, we could not do this alone. \r\nSo America has joined with nations around the world \r\nto spur growth and the renewed demand that could \r\nrestart job creation. \r\n We are reforming our system of global finance, \r\nbeginning with Wall Street reform here at home, so that \r\na crisis like this never happens again. And we made the \r\nGroup of 20 the focal point for international \r\ncoordination, because in a world where prosperity is \r\nmore diffuse, we must broaden our circle of \r\ncooperation to include emerging economies —\r\neconomies from every corner of the globe. \r\n There is much to show for our efforts, even as \r\nthere is much work to be done. The global economy \r\nhas been pulled back from the brink of a depression \r\nand is growing once more. We have resisted \r\nprotectionism and are exploring ways to expand trade \r\nand commerce among nations. But we cannot — and \r\nwill not — rest until these seeds of progress grow into \r\na broader prosperity, not only for all Americans but for \r\npeoples around the world. \r\n As for our common security, America is waging a \r\nmore effective fight against Al-Qaida’ while winding \r\ndown the war in Iraq. Since I took office, the United \r\nStates has removed nearly 100,000 troops from Iraq. \r\nWe have done so responsibly as Iraqis have \r\ntransitioned to lead responsibility for the security of \r\ntheir country. We are now focused on building a lasting \r\npartnership with the Iraqi people while keeping our \r\ncommitment to remove the rest of our troops by the \r\nend of next year. \r\n A/65/PV.11\r\n \r\n11 10-54827 \r\n \r\n While drawing down in Iraq, we have refocused \r\non defeating Al-Qaida and denying its affiliates safe \r\nhaven. In Afghanistan, the United States and our allies \r\nare pursuing a strategy to break the Taliban’s \r\nmomentum and build the capacity of Afghanistan’s \r\nGovernment and security forces so that a transition to \r\nAfghan responsibility can begin next July. And from \r\nSouth Asia to the Horn of Africa, we are moving \r\ntowards a more targeted approach — one that \r\nstrengthens our partners and dismantles terrorist \r\nnetworks without deploying large American armies. \r\n As we pursue the world’s most dangerous \r\nextremists, we are also denying them the world’s most \r\ndangerous weapons and pursuing the peace and \r\nsecurity of a world without nuclear weapons. \r\n Earlier this year, 47 nations embraced a work \r\nplan to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials within \r\nfour years. We have joined with Russia to sign the most \r\ncomprehensive arms control treaty in decades. We have \r\nreduced the role of nuclear weapons in our security \r\nstrategy. And here, at the United Nations, we came \r\ntogether to strengthen the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). \r\n As part of our effort on non-proliferation, I \r\noffered the Islamic Republic of Iran an extended hand \r\nlast year and underscored that it has both rights and \r\nresponsibilities as a member of the international \r\ncommunity. I also said — in this Hall — that Iran must \r\nbe held accountable if it failed to meet those \r\nresponsibilities. And that is what we have done. \r\n Iran is the only party to the NPT that cannot \r\ndemonstrate the peaceful intentions of its nuclear \r\nprogramme, and those actions have consequences. \r\nThrough Security Council resolution 1929 (2010), we \r\nmade it clear that international law is not an empty \r\npromise. \r\n Now let me be clear once more: the United States \r\nand the international community seek a resolution to \r\nour differences with Iran, and the door remains open to \r\ndiplomacy should Iran choose to walk through it. But \r\nthe Iranian Government must demonstrate a clear and \r\ncredible commitment and confirm to the world the \r\npeaceful intent of its nuclear programme.  \r\n As we combat the spread of deadly weapons, we \r\nare also confronting the spectre of climate change. \r\nAfter making historic investments in clean energy and \r\nefficiency at home, we helped forge an accord in \r\nCopenhagen that — for the first time — commits all \r\nmajor economies to reduce their emissions. We are \r\nkeenly aware this is just a first step. And going \r\nforward, we will support a process in which all major \r\neconomies meet our responsibilities to protect the \r\nplanet while unleashing the power of clean energy to \r\nserve as an engine of growth and development. \r\n America has also embraced unique \r\nresponsibilities that come with our power. Since the \r\nrains came and the floodwaters rose in Pakistan, we \r\nhave pledged our assistance, and we should all support \r\nthe Pakistani people as they recover and rebuild. And \r\nwhen the earth shook and Haiti was devastated by loss, \r\nwe joined a coalition of nations in response. Today, we \r\nhonour those from the United Nations family who lost \r\ntheir lives in the earthquake and commit ourselves to \r\nstand with the people of Haiti until they can stand on \r\ntheir own two feet. \r\n Amidst this upheaval, we have also been \r\npersistent in our pursuit of peace. Last year, I pledged \r\nmy best efforts to support the goal of two States, Israel \r\nand Palestine, living side by side in peace and security, \r\nas part of a comprehensive peace between Israel and all \r\nof its neighbours. We have travelled a winding road \r\nover the last 12 months, with few peaks and many \r\nvalleys. But this month I am pleased that we have \r\npursued direct negotiations between Israelis and \r\nPalestinians in Washington, Sharm el-Sheikh and \r\nJerusalem.  \r\n Now I recognize that many are pessimistic about \r\nthis process. The cynics say that Israelis and \r\nPalestinians are too distrustful of each other, and too \r\ndivided internally, to forge lasting peace. Rejectionists \r\non both sides will try to disrupt the process with bitter \r\nwords and with bombs and gunfire. Some say that the \r\ngaps between the parties are too big; the potential for \r\ntalks to break down is too great; and that after decades \r\nof failure peace is simply not possible.  \r\n I hear those voices of scepticism. But I ask the \r\nAssembly to consider the alternative. If an agreement \r\nis not reached, Palestinians will never know the pride \r\nand dignity that comes with their own State. Israelis \r\nwill never know the certainty and security that comes \r\nwith sovereign and stable neighbours who are \r\ncommitted to coexistence. The hard realities of \r\ndemography will take over. More blood will be shed. \r\nThis Holy Land will remain a symbol of our \r\ndifferences, instead of our common humanity.  \r\nA/65/PV.11  \r\n \r\n10-54827 12 \r\n \r\n I refuse to accept that future. We all have a choice \r\nto make. Each of us must choose the path of peace. Of \r\ncourse, that responsibility begins with the parties \r\nthemselves, who must answer the call of history. \r\nEarlier this month, at the White House, I was struck by \r\nthe words of both the Israeli and Palestinian leaders. \r\nPrime Minister Netanyahu said, “I came here today to \r\nfind an historic compromise that will enable both \r\npeoples to live in peace, security and dignity”. \r\nPresident Abbas said, “We will spare no effort and we \r\nwill work diligently and tirelessly to ensure these \r\nnegotiations achieve their cause”. \r\n These words must now be followed by action, \r\nand I believe that both leaders have the courage to do \r\nso. But the road that they have to travel is exceedingly \r\ndifficult, which is why I call upon Israelis and \r\nPalestinians — and the world — to rally behind the \r\ngoal that these leaders now share.  \r\n We know that there will be tests along the way, \r\nand that one test is fast approaching. Israel’s settlement \r\nmoratorium has made a difference on the ground and \r\nimproved the atmosphere for talks. \r\n And our position on this issue is well known. We \r\nbelieve that the moratorium should be extended. We \r\nalso believe that talks should press on until completed. \r\nNow is the time for the parties to help each other \r\novercome this obstacle. Now is the time to build the \r\ntrust — and provide the time — for substantial \r\nprogress to be made. Now is the time for this \r\nopportunity to be seized, so that it does not slip away.  \r\n Now, peace must be made by Israelis and \r\nPalestinians, but we each have a responsibility to do \r\nour part as well. Those of us who are friends of Israel \r\nmust understand that true security for the Jewish State \r\nrequires an independent Palestine — one that allows \r\nthe Palestinian people to live with dignity and \r\nopportunity. And those of us who are friends of the \r\nPalestinians must understand that the rights of the \r\nPalestinian people will be won only through peaceful \r\nmeans — including genuine reconciliation with a \r\nsecure Israel. \r\n I know many in this Hall count themselves as \r\nfriends of the Palestinians. These pledges of friendship \r\nmust now be supported by deeds. Those who have \r\nsigned on to the Arab Peace Initiative should seize this \r\nopportunity to make it real by taking tangible steps \r\ntowards the normalization that it promises Israel. \r\n And those who speak on behalf of Palestinian \r\nself-government should help the Palestinian Authority \r\npolitically and financially, and in doing so help the \r\nPalestinians build the institutions of their State. \r\n Those who long to see an independent Palestine \r\nmust also stop trying to tear down Israel. After \r\nthousands of years, Jews and Arabs are not strangers in \r\na strange land. After 60 years in the community of \r\nnations, Israel’s existence must not be a subject for \r\ndebate. \r\n Israel is a sovereign State, and the historic \r\nhomeland of the Jewish people. It should be clear to all \r\nthat efforts to chip away at Israel’s legitimacy will be \r\nmet by the unshakeable opposition of the United \r\nStates. Efforts to threaten or kill Israelis will do \r\nnothing to help the Palestinian people. The slaughter of \r\ninnocent Israelis is not resistance; it is injustice. And \r\nmake no mistake: the courage of a man like President \r\nAbbas, who stands up for his people in front of the \r\nworld under very difficult circumstances, is far greater \r\nthan those who fire rockets at innocent women and \r\nchildren. \r\n The conflict between Israelis and Arabs is as old \r\nas the United Nations. And we can come back here \r\nnext year, as we have for the last 60 years, and make \r\nlong speeches about it. We can read familiar lists of \r\ngrievances. We can table the same resolutions. We can \r\nfurther empower the forces of rejectionism and hate. \r\nAnd we can waste more time by carrying forward an \r\nargument that will not help a single Israeli or \r\nPalestinian child achieve a better life. We can do that. \r\n Or we can say that this time will be different — \r\nthat this time we will not let terror or turbulence or \r\nposturing or petty politics stand in the way. This time \r\nwe will think, not of ourselves, but of the young girl in \r\nGaza who wants to have no ceiling on her dreams or \r\nthe young boy in Sderot who wants to sleep without the \r\nnightmare of rocket fire. \r\n This time we should draw upon the teachings of \r\ntolerance that lie at the heart of the three great religions \r\nthat see Jerusalem’s soil as sacred. This time we should \r\nreach for what is best within ourselves. If we do, when \r\nwe come back here next year, we can have an \r\nagreement that will lead to a new State Member of the \r\nUnited Nations — an independent, sovereign State of \r\nPalestine living in peace with Israel. \r\n A/65/PV.11\r\n \r\n13 10-54827 \r\n \r\n It is our destiny to bear the burdens of the \r\nchallenges that I have addressed — recession and war \r\nand conflict. And there is always a sense of urgency, \r\neven emergency, that drives most of our foreign \r\npolicies. Indeed, after millennia marked by wars, this \r\nvery institution reflects the desire of human beings to \r\ncreate a forum to deal with emergencies that will \r\ninevitably come. \r\n But even as we confront immediate challenges, \r\nwe must also summon the foresight to look beyond \r\nthem and consider what we are trying to build over the \r\nlong term. What is the world that awaits us when \r\ntoday’s battles are brought to an end? And, that is what \r\nI would like to talk about with the remainder of my \r\ntime today. \r\n One of the first actions of the General Assembly \r\nwas to adopt the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights in 1948. This Declaration begins by stating that, \r\n“recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal \r\nand inalienable rights of all members of the human \r\nfamily is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace \r\nin the world”.  \r\n The idea is a simple one — that freedom, justice \r\nand peace for the world must begin with freedom, \r\njustice and peace in the lives of individual human \r\nbeings. For the United States, this is a matter of moral \r\nand pragmatic assessment. As Robert Kennedy said, \r\n“the individual man, the child of God, is the touchstone \r\nof value, and all society, groups, the state exist for his \r\nbenefit”.  \r\n So we stand up for universal values because it is \r\nthe right thing to do. But we also know from \r\nexperience that those who defend these values for their \r\npeople have been our closest friends and allies, while \r\nthose who have denied those rights — whether terrorist \r\ngroups or tyrannical Governments — have chosen to be \r\nour adversaries. \r\n Human rights have never gone unchallenged — \r\nnot in any of our nations, not in our world. Tyranny is \r\nstill with us — whether it manifests itself in the \r\nTaliban killing girls who try to go to school, a North \r\nKorean regime that enslaves its own people, or an \r\narmed group in Congo-Kinshasa that use rape as a \r\nweapon of war. \r\n In times of economic unease, there can also be an \r\nanxiety about human rights. Today, as in past times of \r\neconomic downturn, some put human rights aside for \r\nthe promise of short-term stability or the false notion \r\nthat economic growth can come at the expense of \r\nfreedom. We see leaders abolishing term limits, we see \r\ncrackdowns on civil society, we see corruption \r\nsmothering entrepreneurship and good governance, we \r\nsee democratic reforms deferred indefinitely. \r\n As I said last year, each country will pursue a \r\npath rooted in the culture of its own people. Yet \r\nexperience shows us that history is on the side of \r\nliberty; that the strongest foundation lies in open \r\neconomies, open societies, and open Governments. To \r\nput it simply, democracy, more than any other form of \r\ngovernment, delivers for our citizens. And I believe \r\nthat truth will only grow stronger in a world where the \r\nborders between nations are blurred. \r\n America is working to shape a world that fosters \r\nthis openness. For the rot of a closed or corrupt \r\neconomy must never eclipse the energy and innovation \r\nof human beings.All of us want the right to educate our \r\nchildren, to make a decent wage, to care for the sick, \r\nand to be carried as far as our dreams and deeds will \r\ntake us. But that depends upon economies that tap the \r\npower of our people, including the potential of women \r\nand girls. That means letting entrepreneurs start a \r\nbusiness without paying a bribe and Governments that \r\nsupport opportunity instead of stealing from their \r\npeople. And that means rewarding hard work, instead \r\nof reckless risk-taking. \r\n Yesterday, I put forward a new development \r\npolicy that will pursue these goals, recognizing that \r\ndignity is a human right and global development is in \r\nour common interest. America will partner with nations \r\nthat offer their people a path out of poverty. And \r\ntogether, we must unleash growth that powers by \r\nindividuals and merging markets in all parts of the \r\nglobe. \r\n There is no reason why Africa should not be an \r\nexporter of agriculture, which is why our food security \r\ninitiative is empowering farmers. There is no reason \r\nwhy entrepreneurs should not be able to build new \r\nmarkets in every society, which is why I hosted a \r\nsummit on entrepreneurship earlier this spring, because \r\nthe obligation of Government is to empower \r\nindividuals, not to impede them. \r\n The same holds true for civil society. The arc of \r\nhuman progress has been shaped by individuals with \r\nthe freedom to assemble and by organizations outside \r\nof government that insisted upon democratic change \r\nA/65/PV.11  \r\n \r\n10-54827 14 \r\n \r\nand by free media that held the powerful accountable. \r\nWe have seen that from the South Africans who stood \r\nup to apartheid, to the Poles of Solidarity, to the \r\nmothers of the disappeared who spoke out against the \r\nDirty War, to Americans who marched for the rights of \r\nall races, including my own. \r\n Civil society is the conscience of our \r\ncommunities and America will always extend our \r\nengagement abroad with citizens beyond the halls of \r\nGovernment. And we will call out those who suppress \r\nideas and serve as a voice for those who are voiceless. \r\nWe will promote new tools of communication so \r\npeople are empowered to connect with one another \r\nand, in repressive societies, to do so with security. We \r\nwill support a free and open Internet, so individuals \r\nhave the information to make up their own minds. And \r\nit is time to embrace and effectively monitor norms \r\nthat advance the rights of civil society and guarantee \r\nits expansion within and across borders. \r\n Open society supports open government, but it \r\ncannot substitute for it. There is no right more \r\nfundamental than the right to choose your leaders and \r\ndetermine your destiny. Now, make no mistake: the \r\nultimate success of democracy in the world will not \r\ncome because the United States dictates it; it will come \r\nbecause individual citizens demand a say in how they \r\nare governed. \r\n There is no soil where this cannot take root, just \r\nas every democracy reflects the uniqueness of a nation. \r\nLater this fall, I will travel to Asia. And I will visit \r\nIndia, which peacefully threw off colonialism and \r\nestablished a thriving democracy of over a billion \r\npeople. \r\n I will continue to Indonesia, the world’s largest \r\nMuslim-majority country, which binds together \r\nthousands of islands through the glue of representative \r\ngovernment and civil society. I will join the Group-of-\r\n20 meeting on the Korean peninsula, which provides \r\nthe world’s clearest contrast between a society that is \r\ndynamic and open and free, and one that is imprisoned \r\nand closed. And I will conclude my trip in Japan, an \r\nancient culture that found peace and extraordinary \r\ndevelopment through democracy. \r\n Each of these countries gives life to democratic \r\nprinciples in its own way. And even as some \r\nGovernments roll back reform, we also celebrate the \r\ncourage of a President in Colombia who willingly \r\nstepped aside, or the promise of a new constitution in \r\nKenya.  \r\n The common thread of progress is the principle \r\nthat government is accountable to its citizens. And the \r\ndiversity in this Hall makes clear — no one country \r\nhas all the answers, but all of us must answer to our \r\nown people. \r\n In all parts of the world, we see the promise of \r\ninnovation to make government more open and \r\naccountable. And now we must build on that progress. \r\nAnd when we gather back here next year, we should \r\nbring specific commitments to promote transparency; \r\nto fight corruption; to energize civic engagement; to \r\nleverage new technology so that we strengthen the \r\nfoundations of freedom in our own countries, while \r\nliving up to the ideals that can light the world. \r\n This institution can still play an indispensable \r\nrole in the advance of human rights. It is time to \r\nwelcome the efforts of UN Women to protect the rights \r\nof women around the world. \r\n It is time for every Member State to open its \r\nelections to international monitors and increase the \r\nUnited Nations Democracy Fund. It is time to \r\ninvigorate United Nations peacekeeping, so that \r\nmissions have the resources necessary to succeed, and \r\nso atrocities like sexual violence are prevented and \r\njustice is enforced — because neither dignity nor \r\ndemocracy can thrive without basic security.  \r\n It is time to make this institution more \r\naccountable as well, because the challenges of the new \r\ncentury demand new ways of serving our common \r\ninterests. \r\n The world that America seeks is not one we can \r\nbuild on our own. For human rights to reach those who \r\nsuffer the boot of oppression, we need your voices to \r\nspeak out. In particular, I appeal to those nations that \r\nemerged from tyranny and inspired the world in the \r\nsecond half of the last century — from South Africa to \r\nSouth Asia; from Eastern Europe to South America. Do \r\nnot stand idly by, do not be silent, when dissidents \r\nelsewhere are imprisoned and protesters are beaten, \r\nrecall your own history. Because part of the price of \r\nour own freedom is standing up for the freedom of \r\nothers.  \r\n That belief will guide America’s leadership in \r\nthis twenty-first century. It is a belief that has seen us \r\nthrough more than two centuries of trial, and it will see \r\n A/65/PV.11\r\n \r\n15 10-54827 \r\n \r\nus through the challenges we face today — be they war \r\nor recession; conflict or division. \r\n So even as we have come through a difficult \r\ndecade, I stand here before you confident in the \r\nfuture — a future where Iraq is governed by neither a \r\ntyrant nor a foreign Power, and Afghanistan is freed \r\nfrom the turmoil of war; a future where the children of \r\nIsrael and Palestine can build the peace that was not \r\npossible for their parents; a world where the promise of \r\ndevelopment reaches into the prisons of poverty and \r\ndisease; a future where the cloud of recession gives \r\nway to the light of renewal, and the dream of \r\nopportunity is available to all.  \r\n This future will not be easy to reach. It will not \r\ncome without setbacks, nor will it be quickly claimed. \r\nBut the founding of the United Nations itself is a \r\ntestament to human progress. Remember, in times that \r\nwere far more trying than our own, our predecessors \r\nchose the hope of unity over the ease of division and \r\nmade a promise to future generations that the dignity \r\nand equality of human beings would be our common \r\ncause. \r\n It falls to us to fulfil that promise. And though we \r\nwill be met by dark forces that will test our resolve, \r\nAmericans have always had cause to believe that we \r\ncan choose a better history; that we need only to look \r\noutside the walls around us. For through the citizens of \r\nevery conceivable ancestry who make this city their \r\nown, we see living proof that opportunity can be \r\naccessed by all, that what unites us as human beings is \r\nfar greater than what divides us, and that people from \r\nevery part of this world can live together in peace. \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe United States of America for the statement he has \r\njust made. \r\n  Mr. Barack Obama, President of the United States \r\nof America, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Bingu Wa Mutharika, President of \r\nthe Republic of Malawi \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Bingu \r\nWa Mutharika, President of the Republic of Malawi.  \r\n  Mr. Bingu Wa Mutharika, President of the \r\nRepublic of Malawi, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Bingu Wa \r\nMutharika, President of the Republic of Malawi, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Mutharika: I am delighted to address \r\nthe sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly as \r\nChairman of the African Union.  \r\n I offer my personal congratulations and those of \r\nthe African Union to you, Sir, on your election as \r\nPresident of the United Nations General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-fifth session. I assure you, Sir, of Africa’s \r\nsupport in your work. \r\n I pay tribute to His Excellency Mr. Ali \r\nAbdussalam Treki, President of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-fourth session for his leadership during his \r\ntenure of office. \r\n I also commend our Secretary-General, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his exemplary \r\nleadership of our Organization and the excellent \r\nmanner in which he continues to discharge his \r\nresponsibilities. Africa is particularly grateful for his \r\ncontinued support of Africa’s development agenda. \r\n I am happy to say that Africa welcomes the theme \r\nfor the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly that \r\nreaffirms the role of the United Nations in global \r\ngovernance. African leaders believe that the United \r\nNations, with its universal membership, is well placed \r\nto build political consensus for global governance. \r\nThey hold the view that the United Nations has the \r\npotential to bring about solutions to common \r\ngovernance problems that our global village continues \r\nto encounter, such as managing diversity and \r\ncombating terrorism and conflict. I believe that now, \r\nmore than ever before, the United Nations needs to \r\nstrengthen its institutions to enable it to promote peace \r\nand stability and facilitate balanced growth and \r\nprosperity between developed and developing \r\ncountries. \r\n Africa also wishes to remind the United Nations \r\nnot to lose sight of its commitment to fight poverty. \r\nPoverty reduction must remain the central focus of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\nA/65/PV.11  \r\n \r\n10-54827 16 \r\n \r\n As we reflect on this year’s theme, the central \r\nrole of the United Nations in global governance, I am \r\nfully aware that the Africa the world hears about is that \r\nof incessant calamities and natural disasters. \r\nInternational media report on the Africa of extreme \r\npoverty, widespread endemic diseases and human \r\nsuffering. They constantly portray the Africa of civil \r\nwars, genocide, terrorism and piracy. They glorify the \r\nAfrica of underdevelopment and hopelessness. \r\n But in their reports we do not hear about the \r\nsuccess stories of a number of African Governments. \r\nWe do not hear about the successes in participatory \r\ndemocracy and good governance. We do not hear about \r\nthe peaceful multiparty general elections. We do not \r\nhear about the high rates of macroeconomic growth in \r\nsome African countries. We do not hear about the \r\nsuccesses in food security in some of them. \r\n That is why I now want to present another Africa \r\nto the General Assembly. It is the Africa of new hopes \r\nand new possibilities, the Africa of industrial, mineral, \r\nand agro-processing opportunities, the Africa with new \r\njob creation prospects, and the Africa that can produce \r\nenough food for all. \r\n Yes, this is the Africa I want the Assembly to \r\nknow. This is the Africa of the new beginning. \r\n I want the world to know that we African leaders \r\nhave a clear vision of a new Africa free of hunger, \r\ndisease and poverty. We have the vision of a new \r\nAfrica that is prosperous and full of hope. We have the \r\nvision of African nations determined to contribute \r\nmore to global economic prosperity, peace and \r\nstability. \r\n I want to inform the world that the leaders of the \r\nAfrican Union have decided to unlock Africa’s \r\ncombined huge natural resources and human capital to \r\nestablish new industries to create new wealth for our \r\npeople. That is why this year I have chosen to address \r\nthe Assembly on the subject of “Africa of the new \r\nbeginning”. I want the United Nations to share our \r\nbelief that Africa is not a poor continent; rather, it is its \r\npeople that are poor. \r\n This year, I have come to inform this world body \r\nthat Africa has decided to shift from Afro-pessimism to \r\nAfro-optimism. We are going to make Africa better. \r\n Now, turning to global issues, I want to say that \r\nthe world today faces the challenge of producing \r\nenough food to feed the over nine billion people living \r\non this earth, and it must do this against the backdrop \r\nof rising food prices, global warming, climate change \r\nand environmental degradation. I am pleased to inform \r\nthis world body that African leaders fully recognize \r\nthese problems and have unanimously agreed to \r\ninstitute new measures to ensure that five years from \r\nnow, Africa will be able to produce enough food to \r\nfeed its people. They have also decided that, five years \r\nfrom now, no child in Africa will die of hunger or \r\nmalnutrition. \r\n In order to meet these targets, the African Union \r\ndecided to turn the continent into an African food \r\nbasket whose main aim is to encourage allocation of \r\nincreased budgetary resources and private sector \r\ninvestment to agriculture and food production. For that \r\nto happen, African leaders have agreed to redesign \r\ntheir policy efforts to focus on three priority areas, \r\nnamely, agriculture and food security, transport and \r\nenergy development, and climate change. It is \r\nenvisaged that effective transport structures and \r\nadequate energy supply will enhance agricultural \r\nproduction and food processing as well as improve \r\nhuman mobility and the marketing of food and \r\nagricultural products from surplus countries to deficit \r\ncountries across the African continent. \r\n The African food basket concept envisages full \r\ncooperation between Africa and Governments of the \r\nGroup of Eight. The United Nations, the Food and \r\nAgriculture Organization, the World Bank, the \r\nEuropean Union and other multilateral institutions will \r\nalso cooperate in this effort. \r\n I now want to briefly raise some issues of major \r\nconcern to Africa: the adverse effects of climate \r\nchange, fragile peace and security, terrorism and \r\npiracy, maternal, infant and child mortality, and slow \r\nreform of the United Nations.  \r\n African leaders recognize that climate change and \r\nenvironmental degradation are among the most serious \r\nglobal challenges that affect Africa negatively. All \r\ncountries in the world share the adverse effects of \r\nclimate change. All countries in the world are, to \r\nvarying degrees, experiencing the adverse impacts of \r\nclimate change such as severe cyclones, hurricanes, \r\nrising sea levels and water salinization, prolonged \r\nsevere droughts and overall global warming. \r\n There is enough evidence to show that most \r\ncountries in Africa, Asia and Latin America are the \r\nleast able and equipped to cope with those challenges. \r\n A/65/PV.11\r\n \r\n17 10-54827 \r\n \r\nThe global nature of climate change therefore calls for \r\nan effective, immediate and appropriate international \r\nresponse. We need to act, and act now. \r\n The international community has acknowledged \r\nthat climate change is a real threat to humanity, and yet \r\nthe performance of the major players at the United \r\nNations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen \r\ndisappointed Africa and developing nations elsewhere \r\nby their intransigency. The leaders of Africa therefore \r\nwould like to see the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol \r\nbe urgently implemented as essential interventions to \r\naddress climate change. Those conventions spell out in \r\ndetail what is to be done to mitigate climate change. \r\nOn behalf of Africa, I call for immediate \r\nimplementation of those decisions in order to avert \r\nimpending human catastrophe. \r\n I am glad to note that maternal, infant and child \r\nhealth and welfare are among the underlying issues of \r\nthe theme of the General Assembly this year. That calls \r\nfor concerted action for the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals.  \r\n I am pleased to say that the African Union has \r\nreaffirmed its commitments to the reduction of \r\nmaternal, infant and child mortality in Africa. African \r\nGovernments have undertaken to launch the four-year \r\nCampaign for Accelerated Reduction of Maternal \r\nMortality in Africa. We also agreed to call on the \r\nGlobal Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria \r\nto create a new window to fund maternal, newborn and \r\nchild health. Let me, therefore, take advantage of the \r\nGeneral Assembly to appeal on behalf of Africa to our \r\ndevelopment partners and donors to replenish the \r\nGlobal Fund during next month’s meeting and to \r\nincrease resources for maternal, newborn and child \r\nhealth. \r\n Another global governance issue of major \r\nconcern to Africa is the lack of movement on \r\ninternational trade under the Doha Round multilateral \r\ntrade negotiations. Members of the United Nations \r\nagree that trade is a conduit to development in every \r\ncountry. Therefore we in Africa appeal for an urgent \r\nconclusion of the Doha Round, for we believe that that \r\nis essential to revive global trade and to aid in global \r\neconomic recovery. Any outcome of the Doha Round \r\nnegotiations must lead to clear benefits for farmers, \r\nproducers, exporters and consumers in developing \r\ncountries, including in Africa. Nations of the world \r\nmust redouble efforts to resolve all impediments to the \r\nsuccessful outcome of the trade negotiations. \r\n The advancement of women and gender equality \r\ncontinues to be the cornerstone of the Africa of the new \r\nbeginning. Women have played and continue to play a \r\ndecisive role in the global, continental and national \r\nagendas for democracy, transition and development. I \r\nam happy to inform the General Assembly that African \r\nGovernments have intensified the fight against gender-\r\nbased violence, sexual abuse, discrimination and \r\ntrafficking in women and girls. The ultimate objective \r\nis to have more coherent and meaningful interventions \r\nthat will adequately increase the number of women in \r\nhigh decision-making positions in the advancement of \r\ngrowth and development. \r\n On peace and security, I wish to underscore that \r\nthe African Union considers that democracy, good \r\ngovernance and development cannot be sustainable \r\nwithout peace and security. African countries have \r\nmade significant progress in ensuring that peace and \r\nsecurity prevail on the African continent. Several \r\ncountries have conducted peaceful elections, and there \r\nis growing tolerance and accommodation between the \r\nruling and opposition parties in many countries. That is \r\nencouraging. \r\n However, Africa has of late witnessed the re-\r\nemergence of coups d’état and other unconstitutional \r\nchanges of government. The African Union has taken a \r\nstrong collective decision that those negative trends \r\nwill not be allowed to continue. \r\n The African Union is also gravely concerned that \r\nSomalia has had no stable or functioning Government \r\nfor a long time. That continuing volatile situation is \r\nbeing compounded by increasing organized piracy in \r\nthe Indian Ocean. That negatively affects not only \r\nSomalia and her immediate neighbours, but the entire \r\nAfrican continent and the rest of the world. I believe \r\nthe situation calls for a new approach and new \r\nintervention. More countries should be directly \r\ninvolved in seeking a lasting solution to the Somalia \r\ncrisis. \r\n The situation in the Sudan presents a special \r\nchallenge to the African Union and to the United \r\nNations. Although some progress has been achieved \r\ntowards the implementation of the Comprehensive \r\nPeace Agreement, the African Union eagerly awaits the \r\nholding of the referendum in January 2011 and the \r\npost-referendum structure of relations in the Sudan. \r\nA/65/PV.11  \r\n \r\n10-54827 18 \r\n \r\n One of the most immediate options in the Sudan \r\nis to consolidate the prevailing peace and stability \r\nthere. The African countries are concerned that while \r\nefforts to secure lasting peace in the Sudan are \r\nongoing, the International Criminal Court seems to \r\npush for a pound of flesh by insisting on arresting \r\nPresident Omer Hassan Al-Bashir. There is general \r\nconsensus in Africa that that would have a negative \r\neffect, polarizing the different positions of the \r\nstakeholders and thereby driving them away from a \r\npeaceful settlement. The African Union therefore \r\nstrongly appeals to the General Assembly to amend \r\nArticle 16 of the Rome Statute to enable it to assume \r\nthe powers of the Security Council to defer the case \r\nagainst President Al-Bashir for one year to allow \r\nongoing negotiations and dialogue to succeed. \r\n On behalf of the African Union, I wish to express \r\nappreciation for the contribution of the United Nations \r\nto the promotion of peace, security and stability in \r\nAfrican countries. The United Nations has performed \r\nvery well in many parts of Africa, including the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, the Sudan, Chad \r\nand West African countries. Those efforts in the search \r\nfor solutions to the ongoing conflicts on the continent \r\nare highly commendable. \r\n The sanctions against some members of the \r\nAfrican Union and the Non-Aligned Movement have \r\ncaused great economic hardship, especially to the poor \r\nand more vulnerable people in those countries. The \r\nAfrican Union feels that the ideological justifications, \r\nif there ever were any, have outlived their time. \r\nSanctions are also inconsistent with the emerging \r\ndialogue for the reform of the United Nations. \r\nSanctions are also inconsistent with the obligations of \r\nUnited Nations Member States to promote social \r\nprogress and better standards of life, as promulgated in \r\nthe Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations. \r\n The African Union therefore appeals for the \r\nimmediate lifting of sanctions against the Republic of \r\nZimbabwe and the Republic of Cuba. We believe that \r\nwould enable ordinary poor Zimbabweans and Cubans \r\nto begin a life of new hope and new prospects.  \r\n As to the development of nuclear energy for \r\npeaceful purposes, the African Union supports the \r\nposition taken by the Non-Aligned Movement calling \r\nfor justice and equal treatment for all nations \r\nconcerned. \r\n  Mr. Asselborn (Luxembourg), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n \r\n With regard to the reforms of the United Nations \r\nand the Security Council, the African Union believes \r\nthat for the Organization to be effective in fulfilling its \r\nmandate as an honest broker, the proposed reforms \r\nmust be implemented in the spirit of equity and \r\nfairness. In this regard I would like to reiterate the \r\nAfrican Union’s request for two permanent seats with \r\nfull veto powers and five non-permanent seats. The \r\nAfrican Union should also have the right to determine \r\nthe selection of Africa’s representatives on the Council. \r\nOnce implemented, that would enable Africa to \r\neffectively participate in the global governance that the \r\nUnited Nations is now propagating. \r\n In conclusion, I wish to reaffirm Africa’s strong \r\nbelief that a reformed United Nations and specialized \r\nagencies are likely to play a more effective role in \r\nglobal governance and in a more equitable global \r\ntrading and financial system. I believe that the United \r\nNations in its new governance role should support the \r\nAfrica of the new beginning. A strong Africa — \r\nindustrially, economically and politically — is a better \r\ntrading partner for the G8 countries and the rest of the \r\nworld than a weaker one. I also believe that the Africa \r\nof the new beginning with its combined vast mineral, \r\nagricultural and human resources will provide the \r\nsafety valve for a boiling international monetary and \r\nfinancial system. Think about these things. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Malawi for the statement \r\nhe has just made. \r\n  Mr. Bingu Wa Mutharika, President of the \r\nRepublic of Malawi, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Ms. Laura Chinchilla Miranda, President \r\nof the Republic of Costa Rica \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Costa Rica. \r\n  Ms. Laura Chinchilla Miranda, President of the \r\nRepublic of Costa Rica, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\n A/65/PV.11\r\n \r\n19 10-54827 \r\n \r\nwelcome to the United Nations Her Excellency Ms. \r\nLaura Chinchilla Miranda, President of the Republic of \r\nCosta Rica, and to invite her to address the Assembly. \r\n President Chinchilla Miranda (spoke in \r\nSpanish): From this universal podium I convey a warm \r\ngreeting to the Assembly and the whole of humanity. I \r\nespecially commend my fellow Costa Rican citizens \r\nfor their free and sovereign decision, which has given \r\nme the great honour to represent them before you all. \r\n I begin my remarks with renewed support for the \r\nUnited Nations, for its contributions to human rights, \r\npeace, security, comprehensive sustainable development, \r\ntolerance, solidarity and respect for diversity and for \r\ninternational law. It is without doubt an organization of \r\nStates, but more, it is an organization of peoples, who \r\nfrom their differences embrace and take shelter in the \r\nhumanistic and universal values that support the United \r\nNations.  \r\n At this moment, around the world those values \r\nand their implied commitments are flourishing, but \r\nthey are also suffering. \r\n We can congratulate ourselves on the children \r\nwho are receiving a good education and on the parents \r\nwho see them grow up without fear that they will be \r\nconsumed by war. We are inspired by young people, \r\nworkers and peasants with opportunities for a worthy \r\nlife, and by the women who benefit from full equality. \r\nIn that context, we welcome the appointment of \r\nMs. Michelle Bachelet as Under-Secretary-General for \r\nGender Equality and the Empowerment of Women.  \r\n However, at the same time we also are concerned \r\nabout those women who as heads of households can \r\nbarely feed their children. We are worried about the \r\nadults who grow old in poverty and loneliness and \r\nabout children whose lives lack affection and \r\nstimulation. The catastrophic effects of climate change \r\ndemand our immediate and determined attention. And \r\nit offends us that even today, there are women awaiting \r\nexecution by stoning, populations stifled by brutal \r\ngenocide, and nuclear weapons that are being \r\nstockpiled while granaries are being depleted. \r\n When we refer to the United Nations and global \r\ngovernance, we must remember that such governance \r\nstarts with good national government. But at the same \r\ntime, the success of our domestic administrations \r\ndepends upon an international system that is fair, \r\nefficient, open and responsible and that is capable of \r\ndealing with the great challenges of our time. \r\n As President, I am subject to the constant \r\nscrutiny of my people, from whom I came and to \r\nwhom I am accountable. I am aware that the best \r\nsermon comes from example. Thus my Government \r\nstrives to represent the values, promote the \r\ndevelopment and increase the integral welfare of all \r\nCosta Ricans. We are promoting economic growth, the \r\nopening of trade, solidarity, environmental \r\nresponsibility and political transparency in the \r\nframework of civil liberties. That course of action is \r\nrooted in our history. It is why we introduced free \r\ncompulsory primary education in 1870, abolished the \r\ndeath penalty in 1877, disbanded the army in 1949, \r\npreserved 25 per cent of our land in the 1960s and \r\ncreated universal access to health in the mid-1970s. \r\n My Government stands on that legacy in order to \r\nact in the present and to construct the future. We strive \r\nfor attention to and early stimulation of our children \r\nand for care of adults and the elderly. We fight \r\ninequality, strive to improve education and health, and \r\nfoster economic development increasingly based on \r\nclean energy, a sustainable economy and creative \r\nintelligence. I mention all these things as humble \r\nnational experience, not as a pretentious global lesson. \r\n History, geography and circumstances frequently \r\nshape us — but only up to a point, because individual \r\nand collective will, responsibility, and constructive \r\nleadership can break down the obstacles and trace \r\nbetter paths. Thus we must pull back the curtains of \r\nprejudice that dim reality, exchange the echoes of the \r\npast for the sounds of the future, and bury \r\nrecrimination of others as an excuse to avoid our \r\nduties.  \r\n Beyond the national sphere, good governance \r\nmeans that there are responsibilities incumbent on all \r\nworld leaders with regard to the peoples of the United \r\nNations. The starting point must be respect for \r\ninternational law and multilateral organizations. For an \r\nunarmed and peaceful country such as Costa Rica, \r\nthose are the main instruments for our security, the \r\nindispensable requirement for living in peace and \r\nfostering development. \r\n Last Tuesday we celebrated, with profound \r\npersonal and national conviction, the International Day \r\nof Peace, in whose creation our country played a key \r\nrole. It is significant that, through the initiative of \r\nA/65/PV.11  \r\n \r\n10-54827 20 \r\n \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon, its theme was “Youth \r\nfor Peace and Development”. That triad — youth as \r\nincentive, peace as a framework, and development as a \r\ngoal — is critical to building a better world. But that \r\ntriad would be truncated without freedom as \r\nopportunity, human dignity as an inescapable \r\ncommitment and tolerance as a habit of coexistence.  \r\n For the countries and leaders committed to those \r\nfundamental values, the main question is how to \r\nadvance them in today’s world. I propose to empower \r\neven further the concepts, organisms and instruments \r\nfor the promotion and protection of human rights. It is \r\nin our interest to participate constructively as members \r\nin the activities of the Human Rights Council. Here \r\nalso lies our adherence to the main covenants and \r\nprotocols on the subject, our insistence on the \r\nresponsibility to protect civilians and our commitment \r\nto human security. \r\n Costa Rica, besides hosting the conference that \r\napproved the American Convention on Human Rights \r\nin 1969, was the first country to ratify it. Today it is \r\nhome to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. I \r\nam convinced that respect for human rights depends to \r\na great extent upon international justice. Its most recent \r\nand innovative manifestation, thanks to the Treaty of \r\nRome, is the International Criminal Court, for which \r\nwe reaffirm our support after a decade of contributions. \r\nTo use the weapons of the law actively is another \r\nunavoidable responsibility of global governance. \r\n In the area of peace and security, Costa Rica \r\nadheres to the five points on arms control advocated by \r\nthe Secretary-General. In particular, we insist on the \r\nnecessity for starting negotiations for an arms transfer \r\ntreaty, while at the same time progressing with the \r\nmodel convention for the prohibition of nuclear \r\nweapons and completing ratification of the \r\nComprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. The \r\naccumulation and transfer of weapons, especially \r\nnuclear, chemical and bacteriological weapons, is not \r\nonly a threat to humanity’s peace and survival; it is \r\nalso an assault on development. Every soldier who \r\nenlists, every missile that is activated, every isotope \r\nenriched for military purposes means fewer schools \r\nand hospitals, fewer food programmes, fewer roads, \r\nfewer wireless networks, fewer seeds for farmers and \r\nfewer good judges to administer justice. \r\n But peace must go beyond action; it should \r\nbecome embedded in the minds and imaginations of \r\nhuman beings. To educate for peace is to vaccinate \r\nagainst war. Thirty years ago, our country launched, \r\nand the United Nations supported, a pioneer and \r\nvisionary institution for this area: the University for \r\nPeace. Today its contribution reaches every continent \r\nof the world, and our commitment to it increases day \r\nby day. For this reason we proudly celebrate its \r\nanniversary. \r\n It is a paradox that while many countries waste \r\nresources on weapons, the international community has \r\nbeen incapable of dealing effectively with the scourges \r\nof drug trafficking, organized crime, terrorism, arms \r\ntrafficking, and the perverted exploitation and \r\ntrafficking of human beings. My country and Central \r\nAmerica suffer increasingly from the aggressions of \r\nthe drug cartels. We risk being virtually taken over by \r\ntheir gangs, with consequences that will go beyond our \r\nborders and become a clear threat to international \r\nsecurity. \r\n My Government has made its citizens’ security \r\none of its chief goals. Our people demand it, and we \r\nwill never fail them. We are fighting crime with energy \r\nand determination, as well as with full respect for \r\nhuman rights, intelligent policies and the supremacy of \r\nlaw.  \r\n But the great battle against transnational crime \r\ndemands much more from us all. Today drug-related \r\nactivity is endangering the improvements in \r\ndevelopment achieved in Central American countries. \r\nFrom being merely a transit zone, due to our \r\ngeographic location between the great drug producers \r\nto the south and the great consumers to the north, our \r\ncountries have, to different degrees, been becoming \r\nproducers, traffickers and consumers of drugs.  \r\n Today we are free of none of the manifestations \r\nof the drug trade, which has extended its tentacles into \r\nmany areas of our social life. Young people in their \r\nschools and neighbourhoods see their future menaced \r\nby the easy offer of drugs, our health-care systems are \r\nalmost overwhelmed by the problem of addiction, the \r\nintegrity of our institutions is menaced by corruption \r\nand coercion, and violence is reaching levels never \r\nseen before. \r\n The battle against the drug trade can be won only \r\nwith coordination, global cooperation and a major \r\nrevision of the strategies pursued so far, many of them \r\nincomplete or failed. From this rostrum I call on the \r\ncountries with the highest rates of drug consumption to \r\n A/65/PV.11\r\n \r\n21 10-54827 \r\n \r\ntake more effective action against this enormous \r\nproblem, and to cooperate with the countries suffering \r\nfrom a problem we did not create. I also call urgently \r\nfor global solidarity in this task, and for multilateral \r\norganizations to increase their activity by developing \r\nan agenda with more comprehensive strategies, with a \r\nbetter balance of resources and responsibilities, and \r\nwith more focused goals. If new and good efforts are \r\nnot vigorously initiated, we will soon regret our \r\ninaction. \r\n If Costa Rica, a middle-income country, has \r\nachieved human development rates comparable to \r\nthose of high-income countries, it is because, among \r\nother things, our social investment has replaced \r\nmilitary spending. That is why we insist that \r\ninternational aid should not ignore the ethical \r\ndimension of development. We support preferential \r\nallocation of such aid to countries in the most \r\nprecarious situations. But countries like mine that, \r\nthanks to good investments and astute political \r\ndecisions, have improved our conditions of life, should \r\nbenefit from innovative technical cooperation schemes, \r\nproductive financing and public-private alliances. \r\nAbove all, we must successfully complete the Doha \r\nRound of international trade negotiations, an essential \r\nengine for economic growth. \r\n We must also establish peace with the \r\nenvironment and development. Organizing the \r\neconomy in a sustainable manner in order to produce \r\nmaterial and social well-being is a task we cannot \r\navoid. Today we have high hopes for the next \r\nConference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, to be held \r\nin Cancun. We hope that all countries, but in particular \r\nthe big polluters and generators of carbon emissions, \r\nwill shoulder their responsibility towards humanity. In \r\nCosta Rica, we have shouldered ours by setting the \r\ngoal of becoming one of the first carbon-neutral \r\ncountries in the world. We are also advancing in the \r\napplication and development of clean energies and the \r\nprotection of our watersheds and biodiversity.  \r\n Let us not forget, however, that sustainability, \r\nabove all, must be human; hence the importance of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. Attaining them in five \r\nyears’ time is an unavoidable goal for this \r\nOrganization. \r\n The challenges of global governance are many, \r\nand they are overwhelming, but the possibilities to \r\nconfront them exist. Their promotion is part of our \r\nresponsibility as leaders. This also requires that the \r\nUnited Nations improve its own governance. If it does \r\nnot respond to new realities and if its Member States \r\ndo not help with the task, the Organization runs the risk \r\nof sinking into irrelevance. The adaptation of the \r\nUnited Nations to the challenges of global governance \r\ndemands greater effectiveness, efficiency and \r\ntransparency in its administration, its decision-making \r\nprocesses and its field operations.  \r\n In this universal Organization, we must also \r\npreach through example. That is why Costa Rica has \r\nstrived to collaborate in an active and constructive way \r\nin the reform process. And, like many other countries, \r\nwe still need the help of the world. The world needs \r\nthe help of all countries. That is the only way to \r\nadvance the causes of our peoples. Costa Rica \r\nmodestly offers its contribution, its effort and its voice. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Costa Rica for the \r\nstatement she has just made. \r\n  Ms. Laura Chinchilla Miranda, President of the \r\nRepublic of Costa Rica, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa, President of the \r\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. \r\n  Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa, President of the \r\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Mahinda Rajapaksa, President of the Democratic \r\nSocialist Republic of Sri Lanka, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly. \r\n President Rajapaksa: I have great pleasure in \r\ncongratulating His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss on his \r\nassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-fifth session. I also take this opportunity to \r\nextend our appreciation to the President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-fourth session, His Excellency \r\nA/65/PV.11  \r\n \r\n10-54827 22 \r\n \r\nMr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, for his effective stewardship \r\nof the General Assembly. \r\n That the United Nations is now in its sixty-fifth \r\nyear serves to underline the durability of this \r\nOrganization. It is an important mechanism in ensuring \r\ncooperation between States and a forum for discussion \r\nbetween sovereign nations. We must never \r\nunderestimate the importance of this Organization, \r\nbased as it is on the principle of equal treatment of \r\ncountries big and small. \r\n It is in this spirit that I address the Assembly at a \r\ncrucial juncture in the history of my own country. In \r\ntwo months, I will be assuming office for my second \r\nterm. My mandate will be very different from my last \r\none. For my second term as President, my promise to \r\nmy people is to deliver sustainable peace and \r\nprosperity to all and to ensure that terrorism will not be \r\nable to raise its ugly head again. \r\n In 2005, I was elected by my people on a promise \r\nto rid my country of the menace of terrorism. I say that \r\nSri Lanka is now at peace: peace that was only a dream \r\na few years ago. Over the past year, much has been \r\nreported and much has been said regarding my \r\ncountry’s liberation from terrorism. However, far less \r\nhas been said of the suffering we had to undergo and \r\nthe true nature of the enemy we have overcome. \r\n The rapidly forgotten truth is that we had to face \r\none of the most brutal, highly organized, well funded \r\nand most effective of terrorist organizations, one that \r\ncould even spread its tentacles to other countries. Many \r\nof the atrocities of terrorism that the West has come to \r\nexperience in recent times, the people of Sri Lanka \r\nwere themselves the victims of for nearly 30 years, \r\nlosing almost 100,000 lives, among them a President of \r\nSri Lanka, a visionary leader of India and scores of \r\nintellectuals and politicians. The Liberation Tigers of \r\nTamil Eelam (LTTE) was an organization so brutal that \r\neven those it claimed to represent, the Tamil \r\ncommunity of Sri Lanka, were as much victims of its \r\nterror as the rest of the population of our country. \r\nThose who observed from afar and suggested that the \r\nSri Lankan Government should have conceded to the \r\ndemands of the terrorists need to be reminded that \r\nterror is terror, whatever mask it wears and however it \r\nis packaged. To all those, I say this: My responsibility \r\nis to the entire nation. My responsibility is to the lives \r\nof millions of men, women and children, and those yet \r\nto be born. My responsibility is to the peace and \r\nprosperity of the nation and the right to a peaceful life \r\nfor all who live there. \r\n In this context, it is worth examining the capacity \r\nof current international humanitarian law to meet \r\ncontemporary needs. It must be remembered that such \r\nlaw evolved essentially in response to conflicts waged \r\nby the forces of legally constituted States, and not \r\nterrorist groups. The asymmetrical nature of conflicts \r\ninitiated by non-State actors gives rise to serious \r\nproblems which need to be considered in earnest by the \r\ninternational community. \r\n As we close a sad chapter in our country’s \r\nhistory, I would like to remind the Assembly that we, \r\nalong with many others, made repeated attempts to \r\nengage the LTTE in constructive dialogue. I still \r\nbelieve that dialogue is the best way to resolve any \r\nconflict. It is much to be regretted that all these \r\nattempts were rejected with reckless arrogance and \r\ncontempt. It was in those circumstances that we were \r\ncompelled to mount a humanitarian operation, with the \r\nblessing of many international friends, to neutralize \r\nacts of terrorism and restore peace and security. \r\n The entire focus of our nation is now on building \r\na lasting peace, healing wounds, ensuring economic \r\nprosperity and guaranteeing the right of the whole \r\nnation to live in harmony. We are mindful that in order \r\nto fulfil these aspirations, economic development and \r\npolitical reconciliation must go hand in hand. Towards \r\nthis end, constitutional changes which appropriately \r\nreflect the aspirations of our people will be evolved \r\nwith the full participation of all stakeholders. \r\n We are pursuing a nationwide agenda of renewal. \r\nSri Lanka has already returned over 90 per cent of the \r\ninternally displaced persons to their original villages, \r\nwhich were previously riddled with landmines, and has \r\nprovided the essential infrastructure necessary for them \r\nto resume normal life. We have helped bring back the \r\nvitality of youth to former child soldiers. We have \r\nrebuilt the eastern province and have begun the same \r\ntask in the north. Sri Lanka’s armed forces now have \r\nthe role of delivering essential services, rebuilding \r\nhomes, clearing mines and restoring vital infrastructure \r\nto whole tracts of formerly decimated land. \r\n Despite the lingering dangers that have remained, \r\nSri Lanka has nevertheless repealed a substantial part \r\nof the emergency regulations that were so necessary \r\nduring our conflict situation and plans to repeal a good \r\npart of the remainder in the coming months. \r\n A/65/PV.11\r\n \r\n23 10-54827 \r\n \r\n A great deal has been said by those beyond our \r\nborders about our Tamil community. Let me be clear: \r\nno nation on Earth can wish Sri Lanka’s Tamil \r\ncommunity more good fortune than Sri Lanka itself. To \r\nthe misguided few, I say do not allow yourselves to \r\nbecome an instrument of division, hate and violence, to \r\nbe used as an enabler for hatred to be reborn in another \r\nform. Rather, come, let us join together and break the \r\nbonds of mistrust to rise to meet new horizons. \r\n Sri Lanka recognizes the challenges we face, \r\namong the greatest of which is healing the wounds of \r\nthe recent past. To that end, earlier this year, a lessons \r\nlearned and reconciliation commission was established, \r\nwhich gives full expression to the principles of \r\naccountability. This independent commission, comprising \r\neight Sri Lankans of eminence and stature, has already \r\nbegun its work. Recently, the commission handed over \r\nto me an interim communication recommending certain \r\nadministrative steps that may need to be taken in the \r\nreconciliation process. \r\n We believe that for the rebuilding and healing of \r\nour nation to succeed, the process must evolve from \r\nwithin. If history has taught us one thing, it is that \r\nimposed external solutions breed resentment and \r\nultimately fail. Ours, by contrast, is a home-grown \r\nprocess which reflects the culture and traditions of our \r\npeople. \r\n We certainly welcome the support of the \r\ninternational community as we rebuild our land and our \r\neconomy. We sincerely hope that its members will be \r\nprepared to take a practical approach to developing \r\npartnerships with Sri Lanka through international trade, \r\ninvestment and capacity- building. \r\n Our economy is well on the way to realizing the \r\ndividend of peace. We are experiencing steady and \r\nsustained growth, including during the last quarter, of \r\nover 8 per cent, moderate inflation and low interest \r\nrates. During the past five years, we saw our per capita \r\nincome double. It is our ambition to take this further, to \r\ndouble yet again the present per capita income by 2016 \r\nand also to become one of the top 30 countries in \r\nwhich to do business by 2014. \r\n “Mahinda Chinthana — Vision for the Future”, \r\nmy election manifesto, articulates my vision of having \r\nsound infrastructure at the national, provincial and \r\nrural levels, which is vital for the inclusive growth that \r\nwill make development meaningful to the whole of \r\nsociety. I can also proudly claim that my country, \r\nthrough this economic strategy, is comfortably \r\nrealizing the Millennium Development Goals well in \r\nadvance of the target set by the United Nations. We are \r\nat present strongly focusing on putting in place the \r\nnecessary public infrastructure while strengthening the \r\nenabling policy environment for the private sector to \r\ninvest even more in my country. \r\n In order to achieve the full realization of our \r\npotential, we desire a supportive external environment. \r\nTo that end, we will always seek constructive \r\nengagement and partnerships. For our part, we will \r\ncontinue to contribute, as we have always done, to the \r\ncause of multilateralism and a principled global order. \r\nIn this regard, I am happy to note that 2010 marks the \r\nfiftieth anniversary of our first contribution to a United \r\nNations peacekeeping mission. Our armed forces and \r\npolice are today combat-tested, with the capacity to \r\ncarry out their duties in the most challenging of \r\nconditions.  \r\n The world as never before in the past has become \r\nseverely vulnerable to natural disasters. Almost every \r\nday we see millions of people becoming victims of \r\nsevere floods, landslides, volcanoes, cyclones, \r\nearthquakes and the like. It has become increasingly \r\ndifficult for affected countries to manage post-disaster \r\nrecovery programmes unassisted. The recent natural \r\ncalamities in our region underline the crucial need for \r\neffective action in which there is collective \r\nparticipation to reduce human suffering. Without \r\ndoubt, climate change and global warming are today \r\nissues which demand the urgent attention of all nations. \r\n Among the political issues that have continued to \r\nfester for too long is the continued denial of the right \r\nof the Palestinian people to a State of their own within \r\nrecognized and secure borders. It is the fervent hope of \r\nthe people of Sri Lanka that this most tragic of \r\nsituations will be resolved without delay and in a \r\nsustainable manner. We also hope that Palestine will be \r\na Member of the Organization by this time next year. \r\n Our guiding principle must always be that of \r\nmutual respect in international discourse, even as we \r\ndisapprove of and condemn measures such as unilateral \r\nembargoes. Experience in the recent past amply \r\ndemonstrates that these embargoes have an impact not \r\non Governments, but rather on the most vulnerable \r\nsectors of the community. In the same spirit, I would \r\ncall for the empathy of the international community \r\ntowards the aspirations of the Cuban people. \r\nA/65/PV.11  \r\n \r\n10-54827 24 \r\n \r\n I also wish to urge with all the emphasis at my \r\ncommand the need for greater concern and \r\ninvolvement on the part of the international community \r\nto assist the people of Africa in their efforts to raise the \r\nquality of life on their continent. \r\n Leaders who have been chosen by their people \r\noften face difficult decisions. They must be entitled to \r\nthe good will and confidence of the international \r\ncommunity with regard to the heavy burdens they are \r\nrequired to shoulder. The results of their decisions must \r\nbe evaluated objectively and they must be allowed to \r\nspeak for themselves. \r\n That is not to say countries should operate in \r\nisolation. In this globally interdependent world, we \r\nmust work together where we can and constructively \r\ncounsel each other where appropriate. The United \r\nNations forms the bedrock of this interaction, and in \r\nthat role it will always receive the support of Sri \r\nLanka. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri \r\nLanka for the statement he has just made.  \r\n  Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa, President of the \r\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Abdullah Gül, President of the \r\nRepublic of Turkey \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Turkey. \r\n  Mr. Abdullah Gül, President of the Republic of \r\nTurkey, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Abdullah Gül, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Turkey, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly. \r\n President Gül: The mission of the United \r\nNations is to protect the dignity, security and well-\r\nbeing of all human beings. Therefor, peace, security, \r\nstability and general welfare constitute the tenets of \r\nTurkey’s work and action in the United Nations. Since \r\nthis Assembly gave us an overwhelming mandate for \r\nTurkey’s non–permanent seat on the Security Council, \r\nwe have worked hard, sincerely, objectively and \r\neffectively to contribute to peace, security and the \r\nwelfare of the international community. \r\n In these two years, we have tried to offer added \r\nvalue, in a fair and principled manner, in addressing \r\nvarious global and regional issues. We have sought to \r\nadvance the discussions within the Council on an issue \r\nto which we have always accorded high priority: \r\npeacekeeping and peacebuilding. Indeed, this \r\nafternoon, we will be holding a Security Council \r\nsummit to exchange views and ideas on this matter at \r\nthe highest political level. Furthermore, next Monday, \r\nwe will hold a thematic debate of the Security Council \r\non counter-terrorism. \r\n Terrorism is indeed a leading and most pressing \r\nchallenge for the international community on the \r\nglobal scale. It cannot be countered without sincere, \r\neffective, cohesive and concrete international \r\ncooperation. I would like to recall that our struggle \r\nagainst terrorism is bound to fail unless we fight all \r\nterrorist organizations, irrespective of their supposed \r\npolitical, ideological, ethnic or religious aims. \r\n The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \r\nis one of the risks of our contemporary world. We \r\ncannot overcome that menace unless all Member \r\nStates, including nuclear States, adopt a just and \r\nprincipled approach to their respective policies. \r\nEstablishing a credible global non-proliferation regime \r\nwill not be possible if we ignore the de facto existence \r\nof nuclear weapons in certain countries at the heart of \r\nsome of the world’s most delicate regions. \r\n In this context, I would like to call on all Member \r\nStates to intensify their efforts to create a zone free of \r\nweapons of mass destruction in the Middle East, as was \r\nenvisaged in Security Council resolution 687 (1991), \r\nand as has been repeatedly called for by the General \r\nAssembly. We also support the calls made in May at \r\nthe Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on \r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons for \r\nconvening a conference on a zone free of weapons of \r\nmass destruction in the Middle East in 2012. I believe \r\nthat such an initial step would be a sine qua non for all \r\nnon-proliferation initiatives in the rest of the world. \r\n In responding to those security challenges, we \r\nshould keep in mind that global problems cannot be \r\nsolved unilaterally, bilaterally or within a small circle \r\nof like-minded nations. Therefore, it is more important \r\n A/65/PV.11\r\n \r\n25 10-54827 \r\n \r\ntoday than ever for us to adopt a multilateral approach \r\nto global problems.  \r\n One such problem is the current global economic \r\ncrisis. Though we are in a slow recovery, the impact of \r\nthe crisis is still being felt today. We must draw the \r\nproper lessons from it in order to avoid a recurrence of \r\nsimilar shocks in the future. That crisis was caused by \r\nthe irresponsible acts of some financial institutions in \r\nthe most developed markets. Ordinary people have \r\npaid the highest price for the mistakes of a few in \r\ndeveloped nations. The current economic crisis \r\nrevealed once again the weakness and deficiencies of \r\nthe existing global and national financial and economic \r\narchitectures, which lack effective governance and \r\nregulations to oversee reckless financial institutions. \r\n The Turkish economy, however, has managed to \r\nstay on course in spite of the world economic crisis, \r\nthanks to previously undertaken comprehensive \r\neconomic and financial measures. Within the Group of \r\n20 (G-20), we strongly support the efforts of \r\ninternational forums aimed at restoring global growth \r\nand streamlining financial practices. We believe that \r\nthe G-20 should continue to play a central role in \r\nputting together the right policies and measures to \r\nthose ends. \r\n The situation of the least developed countries has \r\nworsened in the aftermath of the global crisis. Every \r\neffort should therefore be made to integrate those \r\ncountries into the global economy. In that endeavour, \r\nwe should act according to the principles of free and \r\nfair trade and avoid protectionist tendencies. It is with \r\nthese thoughts that we look forward to the Fourth \r\nUnited Nations Conference on the Least Developed \r\nCountries, to be organized next year in Istanbul. \r\n During the past decade, Turkey’s economic \r\nindicators improved, as did its development assistance. \r\nOur relatively greater means have enabled us to \r\ncontribute more to the development of others. Turkey \r\nhas now evolved into an emerging donor. With the \r\ncontribution of Turkish-based non-governmental \r\norganizations, our overall development assistance \r\nexceeds $1.5 billion annually. Through the Turkish \r\nInternational Cooperation and Development Agency, \r\nwe allocate that amount to diverse capacity-building \r\nprojects, in fields such as health, education, agriculture \r\nand infrastructure. \r\n Developing nations are also more exposed than \r\nothers to the gravest threats of four interconnected \r\nproblems: global warming, climate change, epidemics \r\nand food security. In recent years, tragedy has struck \r\nmany nations because of the adverse impact of climate \r\nchange around the world. Some parts of our planet are \r\nexperiencing severe drought, while others have been \r\nhit by devastating floods. The current plight of \r\nPakistan is a reminder that this has become a pressing \r\nissue that calls for urgent remedial action. We must \r\nacknowledge that a sustainable environment is an \r\nindivisible global public good for humankind. We must \r\ntherefore assume collective responsibility for \r\npreserving it. Billions of lives, not just today but also \r\nof future generations, will depend on the actions we \r\ntake now. \r\n The global food crisis is another urgent concern. \r\nIt poses a worrying challenge to coming generations. \r\nThese compelling economic, demographic, ecological \r\nand biological challenges oblige us to redefine the \r\nnotion of security. Such issues no longer fall into the \r\ncategory of soft risks, but rather pose a clear and \r\npresent threat to humankind.  \r\n In the face of such overwhelming threats, it is \r\ntime to take global action within the United Nations \r\nframework. To that end, I call on Member States to \r\nexplore the possibility of establishing a global rapid-\r\nreaction capability to effectively tackle natural and \r\necological disasters, food shortages and epidemics. \r\nThis would also help to maintain international peace \r\nand security by mitigating threats that arise from weak \r\ngovernance, the collapse of public order and domestic \r\nor inter-State conflict over diminishing natural \r\nresources. \r\n If we allocate a small fraction of our defence \r\nexpenditures to financing and establishing a \r\npeacekeeping capability, we will have more cost-\r\nefficient results in maintaining peace and stability in \r\nthe world. Moreover, if we could pool some of our \r\ndefence equipment — equipment that has lost its \r\neffective utility in military terms but is still relevant for \r\ndisaster-relief operations — we could swiftly improve \r\nsuch rapid-reaction capability. Of course, existing \r\nregional capacities could be instrumental in this global \r\nendeavour. All such resources should be channeled \r\ndirectly to those in need, and not eroded by excessive \r\nadministrative costs. \r\n On the political side of our agenda, there is no \r\nshortage of enduring regional issues. Because of time \r\nA/65/PV.11  \r\n \r\n10-54827 26 \r\n \r\nconstraints, I will touch only briefly on some of them \r\nhere.  \r\n Permanent peace in the Middle East is the key to \r\na peaceful and stable future for the world. \r\nUnfortunately, the absence of peace there has had \r\nserious and adverse strategic consequences for the rest \r\nof the world. Turkey has therefore always supported \r\nevery effort aimed at reaching a comprehensive peace \r\nin the Middle East. In this understanding, we \r\nappreciate President Obama’s efforts and welcome the \r\ndirect negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. \r\nWe hope that this new engagement can take us closer \r\nto a viable and fair settlement. \r\n On the other hand, it will be very difficult to \r\nmake progress towards permanent peace unless we put \r\nan end to the humanitarian tragedy in Gaza. In this \r\ncontext, the attack in May of the Israeli armed forces \r\non the international humanitarian aid convoy on the \r\nhigh seas resulted in grave civilian casualties and was \r\nan unacceptable act, in clear violation of international \r\nlaw. In the light of international law, Turkey expects a \r\nformal apology and compensation for the aggrieved \r\nfamilies of the victims and the injured people. \r\n Therefore, we attach particular importance to the \r\nwork of the panel of inquiry and the fact-finding \r\nmission. We are pleased to have received the report \r\n(A/HRC/15/21) of the fact-finding mission established \r\nby the United Nations Human Rights Council. The \r\nreport offers a solid legal framework for establishing \r\nthe facts of the incident. We also look forward to the \r\nsuccessful completion of the work of the panel. \r\n As for Iraq, the elections of 7 March marked a \r\nnew period for the people of that country. \r\nNevertheless, the post-election political stalemate is \r\naggravating the security situation and hindering the \r\nlaunch of a comprehensive reconstruction programme. \r\nWe sincerely hope that the new Government in Iraq \r\nwill reflect the balance that emerged at the elections. \r\nThe new Government must be inclusive, effective and \r\ndemocratic. In the aftermath of the withdrawal of \r\nforeign combat troops, we also urge all neighbours of \r\nIraq to act responsibly and support the territorial \r\nintegrity, political unity and sovereignty of Iraq. We \r\nmust all help the Iraqi people in their quest for a better \r\nfuture. \r\n Our contributions to international efforts in the \r\nsearch for an urgent and peaceful settlement of the \r\nIranian nuclear issue will also continue. This \r\ncontroversy can be resolved only in conformity with \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency norms and \r\nobligation under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons, and in respect for the right to the \r\npeaceful use of nuclear energy. In this vein, the Tehran \r\nDeclaration and the July gathering in Istanbul provide \r\na window of opportunity to be seized. We believe that \r\nthere is no alternative to diplomacy. \r\n As a Balkan country, Turkey attaches cardinal \r\npriority to the peace, stability and economic \r\ndevelopment of the Balkans. In recent years, we have \r\nactively engaged in result-oriented initiatives in the \r\nBalkans by intensifying our high-level bilateral visits \r\nto Belgrade and Sarajevo. Moreover, the launching of \r\ntrilateral cooperation mechanisms with Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina and Serbia, on the one hand, and with \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia, on the other, was \r\nof historic significance. Through these mechanisms, we \r\nare trying to create a new atmosphere of mutual \r\nunderstanding and cooperation among those nations. I \r\nbelieve that the integration of the western Balkan \r\ncountries into the European and Euro-Atlantic \r\nstructures would be a decisive final step for the \r\nresolution of conflicts in the region.  \r\n As for the Caucasus, we remain committed to \r\npursuing our efforts in search of a comprehensive and \r\nsustainable peace in the region, while respecting the \r\nprinciple of territorial integrity. In recent years, we \r\nhave all seen how frozen conflict can easily turn into \r\nactive clashes in the region. Given this context, we \r\nattach particular importance to the peaceful resolution \r\nto the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. \r\n Any failure in Afghanistan will certainly have \r\nunpredictable consequences for the international \r\ncommunity. Therefore, Afghanistan deserves our close \r\nattention and sincere commitment. Afghanistan is \r\ngoing through a historic process of transformation. As \r\nmilitary operations continue, there must be a \r\nsimultaneous and growing emphasis on civilian efforts \r\nto win the hearts and minds of the Afghan people. \r\nTurkey’s commitment to Afghanistan is open-ended. \r\nWe will continue our assistance as long as the Afghans \r\nrequire it.  \r\n Supporting Pakistan’s democracy is also of \r\nsingular importance, not only in and of itself, but also \r\nto the stability of the region as a whole. In the wake of \r\nthe terrible disaster caused by the floods, it is critically \r\n A/65/PV.11\r\n \r\n27 10-54827 \r\n \r\nimportant to support the people and the democratic \r\nGovernment of Pakistan in healing their wounds. \r\n Africa is another region that requires the \r\ninternational community’s collective responsibility and \r\naction. The burden of resolving the overwhelming \r\nproblems of that continent cannot be placed on the \r\nshoulders of Africans alone. It is in this understanding \r\nthat Turkey has devised a comprehensive policy that \r\nincludes effective political, social and economic \r\nmeasures to help address the challenges that Africa \r\nfaces. \r\n On the Cyprus issue, our long-standing \r\ncommitment and full support of a just and lasting \r\nsettlement remains unchanged. We share the vision of \r\nthe Secretary-General that a settlement will be within \r\nreach before the end of this year, but this process \r\nshould not be open-ended. A positive outcome \r\nemerging from these negotiations would rapidly \r\ntransform the eastern Mediterranean into a pillar of \r\npeace, stability, cooperation and welfare in the \r\nEuropean Union. \r\n The Turkish Cypriots have shown that they are in \r\nfavour of a settlement, as clearly manifested in the \r\n2004 referendum, but they continue to suffer unjustly \r\nfrom the absence of a settlement. I would like to repeat \r\nthe call made by the Secretary-General to the \r\ninternational community to take the necessary steps to \r\neliminate the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots and \r\nenable their integration into the greater world.  \r\n In conclusion, I wish to reiterate our view that the \r\nUnited Nations can and should play an even larger role \r\nin chartering a better future for humankind. It is up to \r\nus, the Member States, to provide the United Nations \r\nwith the necessary political support and concrete tools \r\nso that it can fulfil that role. I assure the Assembly that \r\nTurkey, for its part, will continue to lend its full \r\nsupport and cooperation to the United Nations in our \r\nquest to leave a much safer, more prosperous, cleaner \r\nand healthier world to our children. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Turkey for the statement \r\nhe has just made.  \r\n  Mr. Abdullah Gül, President of the Republic of \r\nTurkey, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\nAddress by His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa \r\nAl-Thani, Amir of the State of Qatar \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Amir of the \r\nState of Qatar. \r\n  His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, \r\nAmir of the State of Qatar, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Highness Sheikh \r\nHamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, Amir of the State of \r\nQatar, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n Sheikh Al-Thani (spoke in Arabic): When I \r\nstood on this platform in September last year, I \r\naddressed the issue of the threats that beset our world. \r\nUnfortunately, these threats are still present and have \r\neven increased and diversified, and we are not any \r\ncloser to achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals, which we set for ourselves ten years ago during \r\nthe Millennium Summit. We believe that the \r\nmalfunction that our world suffers from is due, not to a \r\nlack of resources, but to mismanagement and lack of \r\njustice and equity. \r\n The global economic, financial and food crisis \r\nand the persistence of hunger, poverty and other \r\nchallenges facing humanity today prompt us to rebuild \r\nour institutions and formulate our strategies to better \r\nrespond to the challenges and crises facing the \r\ninternational community. The time has come to \r\nreformulate the global economic system in order for it \r\nto achieve justice and equal opportunities for all. \r\nAmong the important international conferences and \r\nforums that Doha hosted this year was the World \r\nEconomic Forum Global Redesign Summit, which \r\nresulted in many proposals for improving the existing \r\ninternational structures and cooperative arrangements, \r\nin order to create an international system conducive to \r\nmeeting the challenges of the twenty-first century. I \r\ncall on decision makers to discuss the proposals and \r\nadopt those that are appropriate. \r\n You may all know that our region is still \r\nexperiencing the highest degree of tension in the world. \r\nThe question of Palestine has been awaiting a just \r\nsolution for decades, the situation remains precarious \r\nin Somalia, Afghanistan and Iraq, and the Iranian \r\nnuclear crisis requires a solution. We have repeatedly \r\nA/65/PV.11  \r\n \r\n10-54827 28 \r\n \r\nstressed the importance of reaching a solution through \r\npeaceful and diplomatic means, and, in our view, a \r\nfruitful, direct dialogue between the United States of \r\nAmerica and the Islamic Republic of Iran would \r\ncontribute to the resolution of this crisis. \r\n The strategic importance of the Arabian Gulf \r\nregion stems from its geostrategic position and the fact \r\nthat it is sitting on half of the world’s oil and natural \r\ngas reserves and is the source of one quarter of the \r\nworld’s production of these two primary driving forces \r\nof the global economy. Let this be yet another \r\nconsideration that prompts the international community \r\nto recognize the importance of achieving political \r\nstability and security in the Middle East. This is a \r\ndifficult goal that can only be achieved by renouncing \r\nthe use of force, freeing the region of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction, without exception, and settling bilateral \r\ndisputes and regional conflicts on the basis of \r\ninternational law, the United Nations Charter, the \r\nresolutions of international legitimacy and the \r\nprinciples of justice and equity. \r\n Israel’s persistence in violating international law \r\nand humanitarian values was reflected in the acts of \r\npiracy committed against peace activists who tried to \r\nbreak the unjust and inhuman siege imposed on the \r\nPalestinian people in the Gaza Strip. This prompts us \r\nagain to call upon the international community to stand \r\nas one in demanding that Israel lift the blockade \r\nimmediately and fully. \r\n We are now at a historic juncture in the process \r\nof the settlement of the question of Palestine. For \r\neveryone should realize that the Arab countries will not \r\naccept the peace that Israel wants to impose as it \r\npleases and outside international legitimacy. A lasting, \r\nacceptable and secure peace must guarantee the rights \r\nof the Palestinian people, especially the establishment \r\nof a Palestinian State, with Jerusalem as its capital. \r\n For reasons some of which we can understand \r\nand some of which we fail to understand, this first \r\ndecade of the twenty-first century has been blighted by \r\nthe blind attack that has come to be known as the war \r\non terrorism. Thus the fresh start of a new century has \r\nbeen hamstrung by a quagmire of distortions and \r\ndamage, some, if not all, of which could have been \r\navoided. We recognize the existence of certain \r\npractices that clearly fall within the scope of terrorism, \r\nbut in this regard we emphasize two premises. \r\n First, we disagree with the attribution of this so-\r\ncalled terrorism to the Islamic religion, because — in \r\naddition to being incorrect — that ascription is \r\nhistorically unjust and is refuted by evidence from \r\nrecent history. In the twentieth century, including the \r\nsecond half thereof, unjustifiably violent actions \r\noccurred in the United States of America, Europe and \r\nAsia, but no one has characterized those acts of \r\nterrorism as American, European or Asian. Rather, \r\nthose acts of violence are attributed to their underlying \r\npolitical, economic, social and even ideological causes, \r\nwithout reference to any religion, country or idea. By \r\ncontrast, what we have seen and suffered in the first \r\ndecade of this century — what is called the war on \r\nterror — is a phenomenon unprecedented in \r\ninternational politics. It has plunged us into a kind of \r\nwar with no limits, end, logic or legal or moral \r\nconditions. Some of this is still happening and, \r\nalthough we note that the current United States \r\nAdministration has discontinued the use of the term \r\n“war on terror”, we are still looking forward to clearer \r\nand bolder initiatives. \r\n The other premise that we disagree with is that \r\nwe believe that even though the phenomenon of \r\nterrorism does exist it should not be addressed by \r\nwaging wars. That approach has not achieved security, \r\npeace or prosperity. On the contrary, it has spread \r\ndestruction everywhere, deprived millions of people of \r\ntheir livelihoods, spread fear, caused the displacing and \r\nkilling of millions of people as well as economic and \r\nfinancial crises that have shaken the stability of the \r\nworld, and undermined efforts aimed at dialogue \r\namong cultures. \r\n I do not want to take up too much of the \r\nAssembly’s time, but we believe that the situation in \r\nwhich we find ourselves after the first decade of this \r\nintriguing century should not be allowed to continue, \r\nand its corrosive ramifications should not go \r\nunchecked. What we fear is that the war on terrorism \r\nmay turn into a series of financial transactions \r\nconcluded with armies of mercenaries who are given \r\nfree rein to kill outside of any international or human \r\nlegitimacy. That is a very dangerous prospect. \r\n In this first decade, we have faced major \r\nchallenges. We should resolve that war is not the way \r\nto deal with such challenges. Rather, we should come \r\nto terms with ourselves, with this era and with its \r\nconcomitant progress, and determine to turn the new \r\ndecade and the decades that follow into an era in which \r\n A/65/PV.11\r\n \r\n29 10-54827 \r\n \r\nmajor challenges are addressed with more in-depth \r\nunderstanding and knowledge. \r\n Proceeding from our belief that dialogue is the \r\nmost effective way to resolve conflicts, we have set out \r\nto seek a resolution to several political crises in our \r\nregion by promoting dialogue between the concerned \r\nparties, whether in Lebanon, Yemen, the Horn of Africa \r\nor the Sudan. \r\n At the national level in the State of Qatar, we \r\npursue human-centred development policies based on a \r\nholistic approach in dealing with human development. \r\nWe have set ourselves the goals of modernization, \r\nreform and development in order to build a modern \r\nconstitutional State of law-based institutions that \r\nguarantee citizens their freedoms, rights and \r\nresponsibilities. We have taken concrete steps towards \r\nenhancing our development capabilities, including our \r\nhealth, educational and cultural institutions, which we \r\nhope will reach international standards, as well as \r\nenhancing national industrial enterprises to utilize \r\nnatural resources in our country. \r\n  Mr. Ndong Mba (Equatorial Guinea), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n God has granted our country an abundance of \r\nhydrocarbon fuel reserves. We have endeavoured to \r\nmake the best use of this wealth, employ its revenues \r\nin the service of Qatari citizens and improve our \r\nvarious human development indicators because we, \r\nlike other inhabitants of planet Earth, are anxious to \r\naddress the impact of climate change. Our interest in \r\nclean energy, particularly natural gas, is on our list of \r\npriorities. And to contribute to the reduction of carbon \r\nemissions, we have developed policies that aim to \r\nbenefit from clean and renewable energy sources. \r\n Through this approach, we hope to contribute \r\nnationally, regionally and internationally to the \r\nestablishment of peace, stability and security, as well \r\nas to the development that comes with them. Thus, we \r\nhope to assume our part of the collective responsibility \r\nfor the common good. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Amir of the State of \r\nQatar for the statement he has just made. \r\n  Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, Amir of the \r\nState of Qatar, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Mwai Kibaki, President of the \r\nRepublic of Kenya \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nKenya. \r\n  Mr. Mwai Kibaki, President of the Republic of \r\nKenya, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Mwai Kibaki, President of \r\nthe Republic of Kenya, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\n President Kibaki: The theme of the sixty-fifth \r\nsession of the General Assembly, “Reaffirming the \r\ncentral role of the United Nations in global \r\ngovernance”, is appropriate and timely. Today’s \r\ntransnational challenges, including issues of peace and \r\nsecurity, development, human rights, the environment \r\nand health require genuine global governance that \r\nencompasses all United Nations Member States. \r\n In this regard, Kenya fully reaffirms the central \r\nrole of the United Nations in global governance, \r\nconsistent with its Charter and international law. It is, \r\ntherefore, imperative that the ongoing United Nations \r\nreforms be accelerated in order to ensure that this \r\ninstitution of multilateral engagement is representative \r\nand transparent, is accountable to its 192 members and \r\noptimally achieves the aspirations of today’s world. \r\n When I last addressed the General Assembly two \r\nyears ago, I briefed this august body on the major steps \r\ntaken by my country to resolve the political difficulties \r\nfollowing our general elections in December 2007. \r\nSince then, we have made tremendous progress in \r\nimplementing far-reaching reforms that will entrench \r\ndemocracy and secure our peace and stability. Top on \r\nthe reform agenda has been the enactment of a new \r\nconstitution, which was promulgated on 27 August \r\n2010 following a successful national referendum. \r\n The new Constitution greatly improves the \r\nstructures of governance and lays a firm foundation for \r\npolitical stability and economic prosperity. It has \r\ncreated new vitality and a sense of renewal. We believe \r\nthat this step will go a long way in contributing \r\ntowards the pursuit of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. It is also our hope that this historic development \r\nA/65/PV.11  \r\n \r\n10-54827 30 \r\n \r\nwill contribute to the continued consolidation of \r\ndemocratic governance in our region. \r\n Ten years ago, world leaders meeting here in New \r\nYork committed themselves to pursue the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals in response to the world’s main \r\ndevelopment challenges of poverty, ignorance and ill-\r\nhealth. Two thirds of the time allotted for the \r\nattainment of these Goals has lapsed. With only five \r\nyears left to the targeted year 2015, the urgency of \r\nbridging the remaining gap is a reality we must now \r\nconfront. \r\n As I indicated in my statement to this Assembly \r\nthree years ago, Kenya has invested significant \r\nresources in the pursuit of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. We have recorded substantial \r\nprogress in poverty reduction and education, in \r\nreducing maternal and child mortality, in the fight \r\nagainst HIV/AIDS and malaria, and in promoting \r\ngender equality and the empowerment of women. \r\n Climate change continues to hamper our \r\ndevelopment aspirations. In recognition of this \r\nchallenge, my country has taken major steps to \r\nenhance environmental sustainability, such as \r\nreclaiming and protecting our five major water towers; \r\nundertaking investments in wind, solar and geothermal \r\nenergy; and making comprehensive commitments to \r\ngreen our economy. \r\n Despite these efforts, Kenya is facing many \r\nnegative consequences of climate change. Our crop- \r\nand livestock-based agriculture, on which the vast \r\nmajority of Kenyans depend, is now at the mercy of \r\nunpredictable weather patterns. It is with a deep \r\nconcern, therefore, that we note the international \r\ncommunity’s inability to make headway in the critical \r\nnegotiations on climate change. It is Kenya’s hope that \r\nthe world will recognize the urgency of concluding \r\nthese negotiations in the interest of the survival of \r\nhumanity. I look forward to positive outcomes from the \r\nupcoming meetings on climate change in Mexico and \r\nSouth Africa. \r\n I now wish to turn to one of the major obstacles \r\nto the pursuit of peace and development, including the \r\nattainment of the Millennium Development Goals, in \r\nour subregion, namely, the continuing political \r\ninstability in Somalia that is festering beyond that \r\ncountry.  \r\n Since the early 1990s, Kenya has borne the full \r\nweight of insecurity in Somalia. Today, as this \r\nAssembly meets, the security situation in Somalia \r\ncontinues to deteriorate and threaten peace and \r\nstability across the entire region and beyond. Needless \r\nto say, the threat posed by today’s Somalia to \r\ninternational peace and security is greater than that of \r\nany other conflict in the region. Yet Somalia continues \r\nto suffer benign neglect from the international \r\ncommunity, leading to many lost opportunities to \r\nresolve the crisis. The perceived reluctance of the \r\nSecurity Council to engage with Somalia has been a \r\nmatter of great concern for those of us who suffer the \r\nworst consequences of the conflict. Today, I wish to \r\ndraw the attention of this Assembly to yet another \r\nopportunity that should not be lost. \r\n In July of this year, the Intergovernmental \r\nAuthority on Development (IGAD) Summit identified \r\ncritical elements of engagement and took a number of \r\ndecisions on the way forward. These decisions were \r\nendorsed by the African Union summit in Kampala in \r\nJuly 2010. Unfortunately, the support needed to \r\nimplement these decisions by the international \r\ncommunity has not been forthcoming. \r\n It is against this background that Kenya urges the \r\nUnited Nations and the entire international community \r\nto seize the opportunity created by the African regional \r\ninitiative and lend support to the proposed measures, \r\nwhich include the appointment of an eminent high-\r\nlevel personality for Somalia, the effective deployment \r\nof the proposed 2,000 troops, a review of the current \r\nmandate of the African Union Mission in Somalia to \r\nenhance its peace enforcement capacity, and the \r\nextension of support to the Transitional Federal \r\nGovernment to bolster its effectiveness countrywide. \r\n As the Chair of the IGAD Committee on the \r\nSudan, I have remained actively engaged with the \r\nimplementation of the Comprehensive Peace \r\nAgreement (CPA). I have done so because we in the \r\nIGAD region believe that the CPA holds the key to \r\npeace and stability in the Sudan and the region.  \r\n I wish to inform this Assembly that I have \r\nreceived assurances from both President Omer \r\nAl-Bashir and First Vice-President Salva Kiir to remain \r\non course with respect to the preparations for the \r\nreferendum. I am pleased to further inform the \r\nAssembly that both reaffirmed their commitment to \r\nresolve all the outstanding issues, to hold the \r\n A/65/PV.11\r\n \r\n31 10-54827 \r\n \r\nreferendum on 9 January 2011, and to accept the \r\noutcome of the vote. We in the region are looking \r\nforward to the holding of a successful and peaceful \r\nreferendum that promotes regional peace and stability. \r\n These efforts by the neighbours of the Sudan and \r\nthe African Union have created a momentum that is \r\ncritical to the full implementation of the CPA. It is \r\ncrucial that the world stand in support of these \r\ninitiatives as Sudan takes vital steps in relation to its \r\nfuture governance. I believe that continued engagement \r\nwith the leadership of both the National Congress Party \r\nand the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement is the \r\nonly way towards the peaceful resolution of the \r\nchallenges facing the Sudan.  \r\n In view of this perspective, I wish to inform this \r\nAssembly that I will convene the second IGAD Special \r\nSummit on the Sudan in November 2010, in order to \r\ntake stock of progress, ensure the process remains on \r\ncourse and support efforts relating to the post-\r\nreferendum arrangements. \r\n In conclusion, I wish to express my hope that \r\nthrough our unity, solidarity, cooperation and \r\ncommitment, the challenges facing the international \r\ncommunity will be overcome. Let us rise to the \r\noccasion and demonstrate our political will and ability \r\nto work together for the good of all humankind. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Kenya for the statement he has just made. \r\n  Mr. Mwai Kibaki, President of the Republic of \r\nKenya, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Emomali Rahmon, President of the \r\nRepublic of Tajikistan \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nTajikistan. \r\n  Mr. Emomali Rahmon, President of the Republic \r\nof Tajikistan, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Emomali Rahmon, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Tajikistan, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly. \r\n President Rahmon (spoke in Tajik; interpretation \r\nprovided by the delegation): I would like to \r\ncongratulate Mr. Joseph Deiss on his election to the \r\nprestigious post of President of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-fifth session and to wish him every success. \r\n Yesterday, the High-level Plenary Meeting of the \r\nGeneral Assembly finished its work. At the Meeting, \r\nworld leaders not only reaffirmed their strong \r\ncommitment to the implementation of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) laid down in the \r\nMillennium Declaration (resolution 55/2), but also \r\nannounced specific new decisions on their practical \r\nimplementation.  \r\n The leaders who demonstrated their renewed \r\npolitical will availed themselves of a very important \r\nand timely opportunity for accelerating the \r\nenhancement of concerted efforts at ensuring \r\nsustainable progress in the implementation of the \r\nMDGs. Further advancement in this area depends on \r\nconcerted, coordinated and consistent actions by the \r\nentire international community, with the United \r\nNations playing a central and coordinating role. \r\n We believe that this firm commitment must be \r\nbuttressed in every possible way by specific practical \r\nmeasures that will contribute to the full and timely \r\nachievement of all MDGs without exception. Against \r\nthe backdrop of the energy and financial and economic \r\ncrisis of recent years and the ever-growing impact of \r\nclimate change, our actions should be supported with \r\nadequate financial resources. In this regard, the appeal \r\nto double official development assistance, an important \r\ncomponent of financing for development, remains \r\nurgent. Allocation of additional external funds for \r\ndevelopment should not aggravate the burden of debt \r\nof developing countries whose financial situation has \r\nbeen exacerbated by the world economic crisis.  \r\n Strengthening the global partnership is essential \r\nif we are to provide an environment conducive to \r\nsustainable economic growth and job creation. First \r\nand foremost, it is necessary to revitalize global trade \r\nand investment, which are the driving force behind \r\nindustrial growth. Such an approach is of vital \r\nimportance for landlocked countries, whose \r\nparticipation in global trade is hampered by their \r\ngeographical location and existing barriers to \r\nexpanding trade relations, which, in turn, affect \r\nindustrial growth and the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals in these countries. \r\nA/65/PV.11  \r\n \r\n10-54827 32 \r\n \r\nEfforts should be focused on creating new international \r\ntransport systems and corridors as well as promoting \r\nthe efficient use of existing ones, as this will help to \r\nend the marginalization of landlocked countries in \r\nglobal trade.  \r\n Tajikistan advocates the speedy completion of the \r\nDoha Round of multilateral trade negotiations, which \r\nwill contribute to the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. Our view is that the international \r\ntrade system must remain open, equitable, predictable, \r\nnon-discriminatory and based on agreed rules, \r\nespecially in a time of crisis.  \r\n Our current stage of development is characterized \r\nmost notably by the fact that we have attained \r\nmaximum quantitative growth, which must now be \r\nfollowed by new qualitative development. Such a \r\ntransformation requires an entirely new conceptual \r\napproach to development which takes into account the \r\ninterests of both the present and future generations.  \r\n Governed by the principles of sustainable \r\neconomic development, the Government of Tajikistan \r\nhas identified three strategic goals, namely, freeing the \r\ncountry from communications isolation, ensuring \r\nenergy security, and ensuring food security.  \r\n In order to achieve the Millennium Development \r\nGoals, my country adopted and has been implementing \r\nthe National Development Strategy of the Republic of \r\nTajikistan for the period up to 2015 and the Poverty \r\nReduction Strategy. As the country’s major strategic \r\ndocument, the National Development Strategy \r\nidentifies priorities and the principal lines of \r\nGovernment policy aimed at achieving sustainable \r\neconomic growth, improving access of the population \r\nto basic social services and reducing poverty.  \r\n Despite enormous difficulties associated with the \r\nglobal financial and economic crisis and natural \r\ndisasters, the aforementioned strategies have in the last \r\nfive years contributed to progress in the achievement \r\nof the MDGs.  \r\n To accelerate progress towards the \r\naforementioned strategic targets, the Government of \r\nTajikistan intends to address sustainable \r\nmacroeconomic growth issues, improve the system of \r\ngovernment management, develop real sectors of the \r\neconomy, and rehabilitate and diversify industries, as \r\nwell as to strengthen the country’s export capacity, \r\nimprove the investment climate, support trade renewal \r\nactivities, ensure social protection of the population, \r\ndevelop the labour market and strengthen human \r\nresources.  \r\n We need to make the transition to sustainable \r\ndevelopment in order to address such long-term issues \r\nas climate change, preservation of biodiversity and \r\nprevention of desertification. Finding solutions \r\nrequires comprehensive and concerted actions. Our \r\nefforts to address global climate change need to \r\nexamined critically, especially in light of last year’s \r\nUnited Nations Climate Change Conference in \r\nCopenhagen.  \r\n The lessons drawn from that meeting should \r\nencourage us to take more resolute measures towards \r\nmitigation of harmful gas emissions, adaptation to \r\nreduce the adverse impact of climate change, and the \r\ntransfer of technologies that promote transition to a \r\nlow carbon economy. We are convinced that at the \r\nforthcoming meeting in Cancún the parties to the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange will be able to agree upon those and other \r\ndimensions of a new global agreement that will \r\nbecome an important milestone in the post-Kyoto \r\nperiod.  \r\n It is known that climate change affects freshwater \r\nresources and increases the probability of floods, \r\nmudflows, landslides, droughts and other water-related \r\nnatural disasters. Furthermore, climate change \r\naggravates an acute scarcity of freshwater in certain \r\nregions of our planet. For example, in Tajikistan, which \r\nis the source of about 60 per cent of the water \r\nresources for the entire region, during the last 30 years \r\nover a thousand glaciers disappeared, out of a total of \r\n13,000. I will add that Tajikistan’s share of gas \r\nemissions is very low. All the electricity in Tajikistan is \r\ngenerated by hydropower stations.  \r\n The depletion of groundwater in the world \r\nremains a serious problem. According to the available \r\nforecast, by 2025 more than one third of the Earth’s \r\npopulation will experience water shortages, and by \r\n2050 the planet will not be able to fully meet its water \r\nneeds. \r\n Tajikistan, as the initiator of the International \r\nYear of Freshwater 2003 and the International Decade \r\nfor Action, “Water for Life”, 2005 to 2015, actively \r\npromotes the water agenda in the United Nations. We \r\nact not only as the initiator of discussions on water \r\nissues in the international arena but also as the initiator \r\n A/65/PV.11\r\n \r\n33 10-54827 \r\n \r\nin adapting specific measures on the sustainable use of \r\nthis vital resource. All these steps are aimed at an in-\r\ndepth study of water issues and the development of \r\nrelevant coordinated actions by the international \r\ncommunity.  \r\n In that context, the high-level international \r\nconference on the midterm comprehensive review of \r\nthe implementation of the International Decade for \r\nAction, held in Dushanbe and organized in cooperation \r\nwith the United Nations and in compliance with the \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 64/198, has made an \r\nimportant contribution. The conference confirmed once \r\nagain that further strategies for water use, irrespective \r\nof the level at which they are developed, should be \r\nbased on the principles of sustainable management of \r\nfreshwater resources. The universal introduction of \r\nsustainable development is important for achieving \r\nprogress in all fields of economic growth and the \r\nstrengthening of human potential. Those and other \r\nrecommendations are highlighted in the Dushanbe \r\nDeclaration on Water (A/65/88, annex), the outcome \r\ndocument of the conference.  \r\n The efforts of Tajikistan in matters of water are \r\naimed at the sustainable and efficient use of the \r\ncountry’s potential and at strengthening mutually \r\nadvantageous and equitable regional cooperation. We \r\nbelieve that water cooperation should strengthen rather \r\nthan undermine interaction in other areas. It should \r\nincreasingly build confidence among all water users \r\nand contribute to the introduction of integrated \r\nmanagement of water resources at the local, national \r\nand regional levels.  \r\n With that in mind, we proposed proclaiming the \r\nyear 2012 as the International Year of Water \r\nDiplomacy. We are convinced that the adoption of a \r\nrelevant resolution by the General Assembly will \r\ncontribute to overcoming competing interests in the \r\nmanagement of freshwater resources through such \r\ndiplomatic means as early warning, preventive \r\ndiplomacy and confidence-building measures, mutually \r\nadvantageous and mutually acceptable regional \r\ncooperation, and a dialogue on these issues. \r\n A worldwide move towards the development and \r\nuse of renewable energy, which considerably reduces \r\nharmful gas emissions, is an important component of \r\nefforts to address climate change. It is essential to \r\nencourage and support in every possible way projects \r\naimed at increasing the proportion of renewable energy \r\nused globally, the transfer of new and advanced \r\ntechnologies and enhancing the efficiency of energy \r\nsupply and energy conservation.  \r\n Tajikistan fully supports the initiative on ensuring \r\nuniversal access to advanced energy services and \r\nconsiders it a prerequisite for the successful \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nFor this reason, Tajikistan has been developing its \r\nenergy potential in a consistent and planned manner on \r\nthe basis of the integrated development of renewable \r\nenergy sources. Alongside the construction of small \r\nand medium-scale hydropower stations, we are \r\nconsidering the implementation of large-scale projects \r\nof regional significance and exploring the possibility of \r\nusing solar and wind energy. \r\n Effective regional cooperation plays a significant \r\nrole in establishing a global partnership for sustainable \r\ndevelopment. The specific feature of our region is that \r\ndevelopment of comprehensive cooperation depends in \r\nmany respects on the success of the process of \r\nstrengthening peace and overall stability in \r\nAfghanistan. \r\n Counteracting terrorism is a long-term objective \r\nbecause of the multifaceted nature of this phenomenon, \r\nwhich is alien to humanity, and because of its deep \r\nroots. It is essential to intensify the concerted struggle \r\nfor uprooting terrorism by applying the entire range of \r\npolitical, economic, financial and humanitarian \r\nmeasures. We consider it important to speed up the \r\nagreement on and adoption of a comprehensive \r\nconvention on combating international terrorism. \r\n While combating terrorism, one should take into \r\naccount that terrorism cannot exist without financial \r\nand logistical support. It is no secret that today illegal \r\ndrug trafficking has become one of the major sources \r\nof financing for international terrorism. The urgency \r\nand magnitude of problems related to drugs and illicit \r\ndrug trafficking are clear evidence of the global \r\nmenace that threatens international stability and \r\nsecurity at large. \r\n Currently, Tajikistan finds itself between the \r\nmajor world producer of opium and heroin and the \r\ncountries that consume those drugs. Given that our \r\nborder with Afghanistan, with a very complex \r\nmountain terrain, is almost 1,500 kilometres long, we \r\nhave to act as a buffer blocking the ever-increasing \r\nflow of this “white death”. \r\nA/65/PV.11  \r\n \r\n10-54827 34 \r\n \r\n We are absolutely confident that the success in \r\ncombating narcotics aggression, which yields \r\nmultimillion-dollar profits to the countries far from \r\nTajikistan, can be achieved only through consolidated \r\nand collective efforts. We consider it necessary to get \r\nAfghanistan involved in the processes of multifaceted \r\nregional cooperation.  \r\nIn that regard, I would like to underline the efforts by \r\nthe Quadripartite Group — comprising Afghanistan, \r\nPakistan, Russia and Tajikistan — which is gaining in \r\nstrength. Within that new format of multilateral \r\ncooperation our efforts are aimed at counteracting the \r\nterrorist and narcotics threats, which are difficult to \r\nuproot unless the problems of poverty, unemployment \r\nand other urgent social issues are dealt with. All those \r\nefforts will help to strengthen specific global measures \r\nto reinforce the peace process. We hope that objectives \r\nand goals recently voiced at the Kabul Conference will \r\nbe put into practice.  \r\n Intellectual and creative efforts over recent \r\ndecades have brought about new principles and norms \r\nfor sustainable development, set out in Agenda 21, the \r\nProgramme for the Further Implementation of \r\nAgenda 21 and the Johannesburg Plan of \r\nImplementation. Those historic documents laid down a \r\nsound foundation for transition from existing patterns \r\nof production and consumption to a sustainable \r\npattern — the paradigm of today.  \r\n The whole range of long-term objectives that we \r\nconfront today demands a clear and sound \r\nreconsideration of the actions by the international \r\ncommunity in favour of sustainable development. We \r\nare convinced that the United Nations should remain \r\nthe centre for coordination and harmonization of the \r\nefforts in this area. At the same time the consolidating \r\nrole of the United Nations itself should be enhanced by \r\nstrengthening its capacity to respond to problems in an \r\nefficient and appropriate way and to efficiently meet \r\nnumerous global challenges and the threats of the new \r\nmillennium. Tajikistan confirms its willingness and \r\ncommitment to contribute to this process as far as it \r\ncan. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Tajikistan for the statement he has just made. \r\n  Mr. Emomali Rahmon, President of the Republic \r\nof Tajikistan, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Alan García Pérez, President of the \r\nRepublic of Peru \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nPeru. \r\n  Mr. Alan García Pérez, President of the Republic \r\nof Peru, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Alan García Pérez, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Peru, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly. \r\n President García Pérez (spoke in Spanish): This \r\nis the second time in 25 years that I have come to this \r\npodium as head of State of Peru to address the \r\nrepresentatives of all the countries of the world.  \r\n First of all, I would like to begin by \r\ncongratulating the President of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-fifth session. Peru will constructively \r\nsupport his actions because we are sure that his \r\nexperience will help us to achieve the results we hope \r\nfor. \r\n The first decade of this century has already been \r\nmarked by the bloody attack of 11 September 2001 and \r\nagain by the greatest economic crisis of the last \r\n80 years. That shows that we face enormous challenges \r\nthat know no borders and require a joint, united \r\nresponse from the entire international community. \r\nHence, in this most important forum on our globe, Peru \r\nreaffirms its resolve to cooperate with the United \r\nNations and other States to tackle the challenges of \r\nclimate change, terrorism, extreme poverty, the \r\neconomic crisis, drug trafficking, weaponization and \r\nxenophobia, which is rearing its head again.  \r\n For Latin America, the first decade of the twenty-\r\nfirst century has also meant confronting a choice \r\nbetween two different models of social and economic \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n The first is social democracy exercised through \r\ninstitutions. This is a democracy that recognizes \r\nmarket policy and that attracts global investment with \r\nclear rules, but which also has public policies for \r\n A/65/PV.11\r\n \r\n35 10-54827 \r\n \r\nproductive infrastructure. This is a democracy that \r\ndoes not just wait for a trickle-down effect to reach the \r\npoorest, but neither does it resort to the facile approach \r\nof subsidizing everything or raising wages in the public \r\nsector. This is a democracy that is open to the world \r\nand that acknowledges the immense power of \r\ncybernetics and communications and that, therefore, \r\nembraces a global market policy and aims to reach \r\noutward in the world through fairly negotiated free-\r\ntrade treaties that preserve the rights of workers and \r\nthe environment. But this is also a democracy of \r\neducation, teaching people that the path to \r\ndevelopment is one of effort and of individual and \r\ncollective merit. \r\n In the face of that model of social democracy, \r\nanother path was proposed in America at dawn of the \r\ntwenty-first century. That was a model of State \r\nownership, advocated by countries with great natural \r\nresources, who trust their development to administer \r\ntheir resources and reject global investment. That \r\nmodel aims to control the political direction of the \r\neconomy and rejects global reality. It suggests growing \r\nthe domestic market, administering international trade \r\nby State authority, using subsidies and wages in the \r\npublic sector instead of promoting productive \r\ninfrastructure and assuring the peoples’ future. \r\nMoreover, instead of affirming democratic institutions, \r\nthis alternative path affirms the politic will and \r\npersonal agenda of leaders, which always culminate in \r\nan aggressive downward spiral, destroying freedom of \r\nthe press and expression and taking people down the \r\npath of weaponization.  \r\n That second path does not seem to us a \r\nresponsible one, because it avoids reality and offers no \r\nsustainable solution to social problems, nor does it \r\ncreate jobs that people need, because poverty cannot be \r\ndiminished and true employment created without \r\nmodern technology and integration into the global \r\neconomy. Therefore Peru opts for a realistic and global \r\napproach.  \r\n After four years, I am proud to share the progress \r\nand successes that we have achieved in our social \r\nagenda and in the Millennium Development Goals that \r\nthe United Nations has put forward. I can say that Peru \r\nis today a more stable, independent and egalitarian \r\ncountry than it was years ago; and all this means that \r\nwe are better able to contribute to the defence of world \r\nfreedom and democracy and to play a stronger role in \r\nfostering regional and international peace and stability. \r\n Peru has been one of the proving grounds for \r\nrealistic, global development, for modern, democratic \r\ndevelopment that follows a global markets policy for \r\nsustained development while pursuing social policies \r\nthat ensure increasing stability and equity for our \r\ncitizens. In the past five years we have achieved annual \r\ngrowth of 6.5 per cent, and even in the year of the great \r\ncrisis we maintained employment growth and poverty \r\nreduction. All the forecasts for this year indicate \r\neconomic growth of 8 per cent, which will enable us to \r\nreduce further the poverty that still exists in our \r\ncountry. \r\n We have given priority to public spending on \r\ninfrastructure projects in the areas of health, education, \r\nwater and sanitation, electrification of thousands of \r\ntowns and roads, in accordance with the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) established by the \r\nAssembly. \r\n As a middle-income country, over the past four \r\nyears Peru has achieved an annual rate of public \r\ninvestment of 6 per cent of output, double previous \r\nrates, and has invested $24 billion in more than \r\n130,000 specific projects aimed at raising the living \r\nstandards of our poorest populations and improve their \r\nparticipation in the economy. However, besides public \r\nefforts, and thanks to the stability of our economy and \r\nto the rules we follow, the private sector has invested \r\nand reinvested $72 billion over four years, creating \r\n2.1 million new jobs. All international projections \r\nindicate that we will continue to grow at an annual rate \r\nof 6 per cent for the next six years, since we are \r\nalready assured of $38 billion in investments to be \r\nmade, in addition to investments in the agricultural and \r\nmanufacturing sectors. \r\n Peru has succeeded in reducing its poverty rate \r\nfrom 48 to 34 per cent of the population, and we shall \r\nreach our goal of lowering it to 30 per cent next year. \r\nWe feel sure that when Peru celebrates the bicentenary \r\nof its independence, in 2021, the rate will have fallen \r\nto 10 per cent. \r\n As I remarked yesterday at the High-level \r\nPlenary Meeting on the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (see A/65/PV.9), Peru has achieved many of the \r\nMDGs ahead of schedule and will continue to work to \r\nmeet all the goals of poverty reduction, improved \r\nnutrition, literacy, health and education, among others, \r\nwhich are the true objectives that every good \r\nGovernment must aim for. Suffice it to say that our \r\nA/65/PV.11  \r\n \r\n10-54827 36 \r\n \r\ninfant mortality rate has already been cut to half of \r\nwhat it was at the beginning of the MDG period, and \r\nby a third compared with five years ago. \r\n All this has been achieved thanks to a stable \r\neconomic policy and an increase in basic services and \r\nemployment. Moreover, our currency reserves have \r\ntripled in the last five years and now stand at \r\n$42 billion. Peru’s financial system is one of the most \r\nsound in the world, without debt or credit exposure that \r\nmight put it at risk. But the most important thing is that \r\nthe political discourse of politicians that constitutes an \r\nessential element in driving and guiding our countries \r\nhas consistently advocated democracy and investment, \r\nand has been fully in line with a broad path of \r\nexpanded trade and global investment. I believe that it \r\nis this alignment that has granted us the results that we \r\ncan illustrate today. \r\n As opposed to this, some countries in the \r\nAmericas which chose the second route — that of State \r\nownership, political management of the economy, \r\ninward-looking growth and State administration of \r\ntrade or confrontation rather than productive \r\ncooperation with other countries of the world — cannot \r\nshow similar results. Thus, we can now say that Peru \r\nhas laboured on the progressive path of history in \r\nmoving towards the purposes of the United Nations. \r\nMoreover, the crisis has shown us that the free market \r\ndoes not mean an absent State, and that we who govern \r\nmust not wait for wealth to expand without knowing \r\nwhen and how to steer it in order to benefit those who \r\nneed it most. \r\n Besides doubling our exports over four years and \r\ntripling our reserves, we have also signed trade \r\nagreements with most of the world’s countries — the \r\nUnited States, China, the European Union, Canada, \r\nKorea and many others — providing us with the \r\nnecessary base to maintain and drive growth and \r\nimprove our competitiveness, thus providing jobs for \r\nthe people. In this way Peru will be greater and will be \r\nable to better contribute to international cooperation — \r\nand cooperation, along with maintaining peace, is the \r\ngreat purpose of our Organization. \r\n We are aware, however, that we live in a \r\nmultipolar and interdependent system, and that none of \r\nPeru’s achievements will be sustainable in the long \r\nterm unless we unite our efforts to combat common \r\nthreats. Peace, security and cooperation are inseparable \r\nparts of globalization, and we must promote them \r\nthrough coordinated strategies. \r\n Twenty-five years ago I spoke from this rostrum \r\nfor the first time, and I see that, 20 years after the end \r\nof the cold war, we have still not built the stability that \r\nis a new multilateralism, based on the power of \r\ninternational law. We are still in a situation of \r\nuncertainty, where instability encroaches on peace and \r\nnew threats arise, testing the agility, creativity and \r\npolitical determination of this Organization and the \r\ncountries it comprises. \r\n Peru believes that in this globalized world, \r\nsecurity is the result of the interaction of internal and \r\nexternal factors. We are thus deeply concerned about \r\nthe proliferation of nuclear arms, which must be halted \r\nat all costs. There is also, however, the issue of \r\nconventional weapons, since in practice it is they that \r\nproduce the death and destruction suffered in many \r\nparts of the world. Moreover, arms and the arms trade \r\nlimit social development, foster poverty and inequality \r\nand feed the threat of instability. Peru has therefore \r\nproposed to all countries of South America, the \r\nadoption of a protocol on peace, security and \r\ncooperation to bring about permanent peace and \r\nreduced arms expenditures. \r\n In our view — and this has been said a thousand \r\ntimes here — it is not possible that, since the \r\nestablishment of the integrated, reliable Union of South \r\nAmerican Nations, its 10 member countries have \r\ninvested $25 billion in new weapons and spent another \r\n$150 billion on maintaining military operating \r\nexpenditures. This is shameful, because with that sum, \r\nmore than 50 million people in South America could \r\nhave ceased to live in poverty. Over the next five years, \r\nif we do not halt this absurd arms race, we will have \r\nspent another $35 billion on new weapons and $200 \r\nbillion on regular military expenditure, thus fueling an \r\nirrational race which will always find justification to \r\ncontinue. \r\n But the absurdity we see in South America is \r\neven more serious on the global scale. It is not possible \r\nfor our countries to continue to allocate so much \r\nmoney to the buying of weapons when there are so \r\nmany poor people in the world. It is as though the cold \r\nwar had not ended and was continuing to the benefit of \r\narms traders. \r\n We say once again, as we did in the Union of \r\nSouth American Nations and the Organization of \r\n A/65/PV.11\r\n \r\n37 10-54827 \r\n \r\nAmerican States, and as we say in all international \r\nforums in which we participate, let us allocate less to \r\nthe buying of weapons and more to combating poverty. \r\nLet us raise the flag of the martyr of pacifism Jean \r\nJaurès or our great friend, the Olof Palme of Sweden.  \r\n Let us demand that multilateral financial \r\ninstitutions include anti-armament clauses in their \r\ncontracts and conditions, just as they do environmental \r\nprovisions. Why should they lend belonging to all the \r\ncitizens of the world to countries that use them in a \r\nrace to death? It is a serious matter to produce and \r\nconsume harmful drugs, but it is also a serious matter \r\nfor the richest countries of the world to produce \r\nweapons for poor countries to buy, curbing their \r\ndevelopment and road towards justice. We appeal to \r\nthe leaders of the world: stop buying and producing \r\narms; feed the disadvantaged; develop land; and create \r\nemployment. \r\n Real strength, real leadership of nations and \r\npeoples is found in intelligence and the ability to help \r\nthe least developed, not in the capacity for arms \r\nproduction or its nuclear power. We know it is difficult \r\nto make this appeal over and over again, but we shall \r\nkeep doing it because one day clarity and acceptance of \r\nthese ideas will prevail among world opinion and \r\namong the world’s peoples. \r\n For all those reasons, we call for this world forum \r\nto act. It is important for us also to think of regional \r\nintegration, because we are not a cluster of asteroids. \r\nBut we believe in a modern, different integration. In \r\nthis world of computers, satellite communication, trade \r\nwithout borders and human rights without national \r\nrestrictions, this new integration does not mean just \r\njoining those who are already geographically joined, \r\nbut also using the tools of technology to ensure that the \r\nfurthest off are also integrated. This is the new space of \r\nfreedom that science and technology are creating for \r\nhuman beings and nations. \r\n We must get beyond the primitive idea that there \r\nis not enough to go around and realize that when the \r\nwealth of information is distributed, those who \r\ndistribute it are no poorer for having done so. Rather, \r\nthey have lost nothing by sharing with others. \r\nSimilarly, integration is a form of wealth which sooner \r\nor later will reach all united peoples. \r\n Here, I can provide a fine example of the path \r\nfollowed by Ecuador and Peru after two centuries of \r\nconfrontation, hatred and war. Thanks to the \r\ndetermination and political will of the Government of \r\nEcuador headed by President Rafeal Correa, and its \r\nagreement with the Peruvian Government, we have \r\ntaken a quantum leap forward in fraternity, integration \r\nand development. \r\n Barely 15 years ago, we were divided by war, but \r\nnow we have a permanent joint binational Cabinet \r\nthanks to which we have built bridges and thousands of \r\nkilometres of roads, improved our agricultural systems \r\nand integrated our social security systems for workers \r\nin our two countries. We have binational consulates \r\nand embassies, representing both our countries in many \r\nparts of the world. Ours is an example we would like to \r\nshow to the United Nations as proof of our genuine and \r\nactive devotion to integration; we believe in integration \r\nand in fraternity among peoples. \r\n The need for greater integration was tested when \r\nthe worst international crisis of the past 80 years broke \r\nout. This financial crisis, which began in developing \r\ncountries, has had consequences that we still cannot \r\npredict. Our understanding of this crisis is the \r\nfollowing: the beginning of globalization and the \r\nincrease in world trade were possible only with the \r\nnew information and communications technologies \r\nwhich, at the infrastructure level, have developed new \r\nforms of production and policy. \r\n Information is now the fundamental fuel driving \r\nthe economy and political change. It is gradually \r\ndisplacing fossil fuels as the essential form of energy. \r\nSo we see the structure of world trade becoming \r\nincreasingly dematerialized, but information and \r\ncommunication, by means of e-money and computers, \r\nare able to work at such speeds that they have \r\noutstripped the human capacity of our banks, our \r\nfinancial wizards and existing institutions to manage \r\nthe new economy. \r\n This is the dawn of a new, much swifter, \r\ndigitalized economy in crisis. But if this speed brings \r\ncrisis and chaos, the same speed of technology will \r\nalso bring solutions to problems engendered by the \r\ncrisis. We must trust in human beings and their creative \r\nabilities. Never in human history have we had so many \r\nmeans of payment and so much capacity to consume; \r\nnever have we had so much technological creation and \r\ntransformation; never have we had such an interactive \r\ndigital market that allows people, even the poorest, \r\nfrom their homes to instantly stimulate production in \r\nother parts of the world. \r\nA/65/PV.11  \r\n \r\n10-54827 38 \r\n \r\n This enables us to look with human optimism to \r\nthe future of the world and to believe that after a slight \r\nrise in inflation in 2012, which will come about \r\nbecause of the expansion of the means of payment to \r\novercome the crisis, world trade will accelerate and \r\nhelp us emerge from the present circumstances. \r\n However, we must be prepared for this greater \r\nspeed brought about by digitalization and by creativity. \r\nWe must strengthen our peoples’ and communities’ \r\nability to integrate, strengthen exchanges among our \r\ncountries through transportation, communications and \r\nelectronic interconnection, strengthen education and \r\neradicate weaponization. \r\n Our message is one of optimism about the world \r\nsituation. Despite ourselves, we are building a better \r\nworld, without borders, without tyranny, with more \r\nfreedom. We must act, employing policies which are \r\nsuccessful against the crisis. We must employ \r\ndemocracy, sound institutions and realism, using \r\ncapital and international technology and mobilizing \r\ninvestment in small and micro businesses. \r\n Of course, our response to the crisis must always \r\nbe a collective one. The Group of 20 (G-20) is now the \r\nprime forum of international financial cooperation and \r\ncoordination, and we must support its role to support \r\nits role in reforming the system. We need a greater \r\nregulation given the growing speed with which \r\nfinancial and economic instruments can be \r\nmanipulated. Peru commends the efforts that have been \r\nmade, but proposes that the work of the G-20 gain in \r\nlegitimacy by establishing fluid lines of \r\ncommunication with the International Monetary Fund \r\nand the World Bank, and by involving other countries \r\nin this work. \r\n But just as in the financial crisis, all nations must \r\ncoordinate our efforts to properly confront terrorism, \r\ndrugs, the illicit arms trade, money laundering, \r\ntrafficking of persons, xenophobia and climate change.  \r\n With respect to this last theme, I must note that \r\nPeru is vulnerable to the environment and is at very \r\nserious risk due to climate change. But at the same \r\ntime, my country is strategically placed to mitigate and \r\nadapt to the effects of global climate change because it \r\nranks fourth in terms of the quantities of tropical \r\nforests.  \r\n We want to change our discourse. We have not \r\ncome with hand extended to demand cooperation from \r\nthe rich of the world but to demand that they fulfil their \r\ncommitments in their own countries. We have come to \r\nsay that we will do the same in our own countries.  \r\n In Peru, our forest sequesters 21 billion tons of \r\ncarbon per year. We have 84 biospheres and are one of \r\n17 megadiverse countries on the planet.  \r\n I offer — if necessary, with hand extended to the \r\ninsensitive world of the rich countries — our budgetary \r\nand humane commitment to protect, unscathed, Peru’s \r\n54 million hectares of forest, thus controlling climate \r\nchange at the global level. As a tropical glacier country \r\nin danger, we appeal to the world to implement specific \r\ngoals for cooperation and technology transfer and to \r\nprovide resources to develop programmes to combat \r\nthe effects of climate change.  \r\n We want an agreement that is comprehensive, \r\nbinding, fast and effective, and I reiterate to the \r\nAssembly my country’s desire to strengthen joint \r\naction through development of a clean and sustainable \r\ngrowth economy with low carbon emissions. With that \r\nintention we will voluntarily reduce to zero the \r\ndeforestation of the primordial natural forests and will \r\nalter our present energy matrix so that by 2021 \r\nrenewable non-conventional energy, hydropower and \r\nbiofuels will account for at least 40 per cent of the \r\nenergy consumed in the country. And we will make \r\nannual reports to the Assembly. \r\n However, we must not forget that much of the \r\npollution is still produced by poverty. Hundreds of \r\nmillions of households in the world continue to use \r\nwood-burning stoves, thus driving deforestation and at \r\nthe same time polluting the environment and causing \r\nserious bronchiopulmonary and nutritional problems \r\namong children. We propose to reduce the number of \r\nwood-burning stoves in Peru by 20 per cent by 2021 \r\nand to replace them with better stoves, and we want \r\nthat issue to become part of the Millennium Goals. \r\n A final point is something of particular interest to \r\nPeru — the situation of migrants. The globalization of \r\ncapital, services and products cannot be accepted \r\nwithout also accepting the free movement of people or \r\nfacilitating their mobility. Peru actively promotes the \r\ndefense of the human rights of migrants and their \r\nfamilies, because it is a country built by European \r\nmigrants, as is the United States and many other rich \r\ncountries today — which they forget when they expel \r\ntoday’s migrants and deport them by plane.  \r\n A/65/PV.11\r\n \r\n39 10-54827 \r\n \r\n Peru believes that migration is a development \r\ntool that has enriched and continues to enrich universal \r\nculture and the social life of countries. That is why we \r\ncondemn any type of regulation, whether in Arizona or \r\nelsewhere, or any kind of xenophobic or discriminatory \r\nexpressions. It is a paradox that the countries governed \r\nby the children of migrants are today those that most \r\nvigorously deport migrants, unwittingly creating a new \r\nform of domestic violence that could have very serious \r\nconsequences in the short term. \r\n We reiterate that the best way to avoid \r\nunregulated migration is by means of unhampered free \r\ntrade and investment from the most developed \r\ncountries that helps to generate employment and \r\nimprove the quality of life of people in the developing \r\ncountries.  \r\n Peru has an ongoing commitment with the United \r\nNations, a commitment with humankind without races, \r\ncolours or distinctions. We would like, as we proposed \r\na few years ago, to strengthen the entire system in \r\norder to consolidate ourselves as a modern, strong and \r\nfree organization, free of the contradictions or delays \r\nof the past, one that can ensure peace with less \r\nbureaucracy and with greater resolve and stronger \r\npolitical fortitude.  \r\n Let there be peace and well-being for all peoples \r\nof the Earth; let there be bread with freedom for all \r\nhuman beings. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Peru for the statement he has just made. \r\n  Mr. Alan García Pérez, President of the Republic \r\nof Peru, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Viktor Yanukovych, President of \r\nUkraine \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of Ukraine. \r\n  Mr. Viktor Yanukovych, President of Ukraine, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Viktor Yanukovych, \r\nPresident of Ukraine, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\n President Yanukovych (spoke in Ukrainian; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): On behalf of \r\nUkraine, I sincerely congratulate His Excellency \r\nMr. Joseph Deiss on his election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. I am \r\nconvinced that his rich experience will contribute to \r\nthe achievement of significant results in our joint work. \r\n We have started our work in New York on a high \r\nnote. The Millennium Development Goals summit has \r\njust successfully concluded. The summit outcome \r\ndocument (resolution 65/1), the Millennium \r\nDeclaration (resolution 55/2) and the 2005 World \r\nSummit Outcome (resolution 60/1) have become our \r\nroad map for sustainable development and a better \r\nfuture. Their rigorous and coherent implementation is a \r\ncommon task for all Member States. Ukraine is ready \r\nto work actively to this end. \r\n Ukraine approaches with full responsibility the \r\nissues of poverty eradication, providing high-quality \r\neducation, developing proper conditions for preserving \r\nthe environment, improving maternal health and \r\nreducing child mortality, curbing HIV/AIDS and \r\ntuberculosis, and ensuring gender equality. Our \r\nachievements as well as the problems we face are set \r\nout in the national report on implementation of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, which we presented \r\nat the summit. \r\n Today my country is undergoing profound \r\ninternal changes. We have finally achieved political \r\nstability and have launched comprehensive economic \r\nand social reforms. In short, Ukraine has been given a \r\nnew progressive impetus, allowing us to take real \r\npractical steps towards transformations that are long \r\noverdue. I am confident that it will enable us to \r\nparticipate more actively in the implementation of the \r\nprinciples of the United Nations, to which Ukraine has \r\nbeen committed all along. \r\n The world economic crisis has become a major \r\nproblem that has slowed progress in Ukraine as well as \r\nin other countries. Global challenges require a global \r\nresponse. The world must develop a new financial and \r\neconomic system of relations. Further trade \r\nliberalization, prevention of protectionist measures, \r\nnew solutions and transparent tools for safeguarding \r\nglobal competition can contribute to the economic \r\nrecovery. \r\n We believe it is necessary to support further \r\nglobal processes that expand the free movement of \r\nA/65/PV.11  \r\n \r\n10-54827 40 \r\n \r\npeople, goods, services and capital. New free-trade \r\nareas and visa-free travel regimes are an important \r\ncomponent of the appropriate response to the global \r\nchallenges of today. \r\n We all know that sustainable development is \r\nimpossible without security and that security is \r\nimpossible without development. Ukraine has always \r\nbeen an active contributor to peace and security \r\nworldwide. I believe that our contribution in that \r\nregard is beyond doubt. \r\n This year Ukraine declared its non-bloc status. \r\nThat helped to significantly reduce tension in the \r\nregion and to establish a zone of stability and strategic \r\nbalance around Ukraine.  \r\n In 1994 we were the first in the world to \r\nvoluntarily give up our nuclear arsenal, the third most \r\npowerful in the world. Sixteen years have passed, but \r\nthat decision by Ukraine has not diminished in \r\nimportance. In April of this year, Ukraine took the next \r\nstep at the Nuclear Security Summit, held in \r\nWashington, D. C., by announcing its decision to get \r\nrid of all its stocks of highly enriched uranium.  \r\n The experience of recent decades shows that \r\nnuclear weapons do not always increase security. \r\nMoreover, countries that try to acquire nuclear \r\nweapons may be exposed to the impact of new risks \r\nand become more vulnerable. The best way to counter \r\nthe proliferation of nuclear weapons is to gradually \r\neliminate them completely. We welcome the signing of \r\na new START treaty between the United States and \r\nRussia and further reductions of their national nuclear \r\narsenals. \r\n Today there is also an urgent need for concrete \r\nsteps to reduce the risks related to the proliferation of \r\nnuclear materials and technology. We encourage all \r\nMember States to follow our example in the area of \r\nglobal nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. \r\n In view of the steps I have just mentioned, \r\nUkraine hopes to see our international partners \r\nunswervingly comply with their obligations concerning \r\nsecurity guarantees for my country, that is, primarily, \r\nthe Budapest Memorandum of 1994. Ukraine insists \r\nthat security guarantees for States that have disposed of \r\ntheir nuclear arsenals and for countries that do not \r\nbelong to any military alliance should be reflected in a \r\nlegally binding international instrument. That is the \r\nbest way to discourage regional nuclear ambitions. \r\n The principles of peaceful coexistence, respect \r\nfor the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Member \r\nStates, good neighbourly relations and equality have \r\nalways been the cornerstone of Ukraine’s foreign \r\npolicy. We believe that the spirit and letter of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter are the foundation for any \r\nregional agreements and arrangements in the area of \r\nsecurity architecture. Yet our Organization can make \r\ngreater use of the potential of existing regional security \r\nmechanisms so as to strengthen global security. \r\n We have never distinguished between our own \r\nwoes and those of others. From the very first years of \r\nits independence, Ukraine has actively participated in \r\nUnited Nations efforts to maintain international peace \r\nand security. We strongly support the strengthening of \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping capabilities. Ukraine also \r\nintends to keep working to improve legal protection for \r\nthe Blue Helmets. We welcome support for our \r\ninitiatives by the Member States. \r\n In our opinion, we also need to develop \r\nmechanisms to respond to new or changing challenges \r\nto international peace and security. One of these is \r\npiracy and armed robbery at sea. I am convinced that \r\nthat threat can no longer be underestimated. Without \r\neffective and decisive intervention by the international \r\ncommunity, that evil will only gain force. The United \r\nNations should play a key role in the fight against \r\nmaritime piracy. Ukraine is determined to continue its \r\nefforts to increase international maritime security and \r\nthe protection of sailors’ social rights, and we call upon \r\nall Member States to cooperate to that end. \r\n Today, humanity is increasingly confronted with \r\nso-called soft security challenges. The word “soft” \r\nshould not mislead us, though. Climate change \r\nconstitutes a global threat to the very future of \r\nmankind. The experts are saying today that some of \r\nthose changes are irreversible. That is why the \r\ninternational community should immediately make all \r\npossible efforts to avoid the worst-case scenario. The \r\npolitical will of all Member States should be \r\nmobilized. By signing the Copenhagen Accord, \r\nUkraine has taken a step in that direction. \r\n The Earth is our common ship, and it should not \r\nbecome a Titanic. We believe there should be an \r\neffective international mechanism to protect the \r\nenvironment of the Earth as our only planet. The world \r\nneeds a standing global environmental organization \r\nwith universal membership. \r\n A/65/PV.11\r\n \r\n41 10-54827 \r\n \r\n Against the backdrop of environmental, financial, \r\neconomic and energy challenges, the peaceful use of \r\nnuclear energy is becoming increasingly crucial. States \r\nthat possess nuclear technologies bear a huge \r\nresponsibility towards their own people, their \r\nneighbours and all mankind. \r\n Next year, the world will commemorate a sad \r\ndate — the twenty-fifth anniversary of the accident at \r\nthe Chernobyl nuclear power plant. That tragedy is still \r\nan open wound for us. Overcoming its consequences \r\nremains a serious challenge for the international \r\ncommunity, as the scale of the problem requires a \r\ncoordinated effort involving all of our international \r\npartners. \r\n Ukraine plans to host a high-level international \r\nconference on the theme “Twenty-five years after the \r\nChernobyl disaster: security for the future”. We intend \r\nto hold it in Kiev in April 2011, with United Nations \r\nparticipation. The forum should assess the progress \r\nmade in the restoration and normalization of life in the \r\naffected regions and discuss nuclear safety issues. I \r\ninvite all Members to take part in the conference. \r\n Today’s world is changing at an ever-increasing \r\npace, and our Organization has to change along with it. \r\nThe United Nations should be not an observer but an \r\narchitect of events. For that to happen, it urgently \r\nneeds to undergo comprehensive reform. Ukraine \r\nwelcomes the progress we see in the organizational \r\nconsolidation of the United Nations, in particular in the \r\nareas of gender equality, protection of women’s rights \r\nand peacebuilding.  \r\n However, far-reaching changes are impossible \r\nwithout modernization of the core of the United \r\nNations: the Security Council. The transformation of \r\nthe Security Council into an entity that is more \r\nrepresentative and balanced in composition, with \r\nimproved working methods and higher transparency, is \r\nan essential precondition for increasing its \r\neffectiveness and for adapting the United Nations to \r\nthe world’s current practices and procedures. \r\n Ukraine stands ready to discuss all progressive \r\nconcepts relating to Security Council reform. We \r\nbelieve that the key to success is to take into account \r\nthe interests of all the underrepresented regional \r\ngroups, including the Eastern European States. I would \r\nlike to take this opportunity to confirm Ukraine’s \r\nintention to obtain membership in the Security Council \r\nfor the period of 2016-2017. \r\n I am confident that the work of the sixty-fifth \r\nsession of the General Assembly session will be an \r\nimportant step on the road towards a peaceful, safe and \r\nprosperous world — a world of freedom, democracy \r\nand effective international cooperation. To achieve \r\nthose ends, we have strong political will, a clear \r\nunderstanding of the challenges and a common vision \r\nof the problems. I believe in our success. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of Ukraine for \r\nthe statement he has just made. \r\n  Mr. Viktor Yanukovych, President of Ukraine, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Wen Jiabao, Premier of the \r\nState Council of the People’s Republic of China \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Premier of the State Council of \r\nthe People’s Republic of China. \r\n  Mr. Wen Jiabao, Premier of the State Council of \r\nthe People’s Republic of China, was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum. \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Wen Jiabao, Premier of \r\nthe State Council of the People’s Republic of China, \r\nand inviting him to address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Wen Jiabao (China) (spoke in Chinese): \r\nChina is a member of the big family of the United \r\nNations, and China’s development and changes have \r\nattracted worldwide attention. I wish to take this \r\nopportunity to share with the Assembly my \r\nobservations on how one should get to know the real \r\nChina. \r\n Since the founding of the People’s Republic, and \r\nespecially since the start of reform and opening up \r\nmore than 30 years ago, profound changes have taken \r\nplace in China, a big, ancient country in the East. Its \r\neconomic and overall national strength has \r\nsubstantially increased. The lives of its people have \r\nmarkedly improved. Its social and cultural programmes \r\nhave made considerable progress, and its exchanges \r\nand cooperation with the outside world have continued \r\nto expand. In sum, my country has made an historic \r\nleap from mere subsistence to moderate prosperity. \r\nA/65/PV.11  \r\n \r\n10-54827 42 \r\n \r\n We in China are proud of our achievements, \r\nwhich were made through strenuous efforts. At the \r\nsame time, we are clear-headed about our place and \r\nrole in today’s world. \r\n China’s gross domestic product is the third largest \r\nin the world, but in per capita terms it is only one tenth \r\nof that of developed countries. China has enjoyed more \r\nthan 30 years of rapid growth, but its further \r\ndevelopment faces energy, resources and \r\nenvironmental constraints. It is a leading producer of \r\nmany important products, but it remains at the lower \r\nend of the global industrial chain. China is a big \r\ntrading nation, but its exports are low in technology \r\ncontent and value added. In many cases, we have to \r\nrely on imports to meet the demand for core \r\ntechnologies.  \r\n China’s coastal areas and some of the large and \r\nmedium-sized cities are thriving after modernizing, but \r\nmany places in the central and western regions and the \r\nvast rural areas are still rather backward. Moreover, we \r\nhave 150 million people living below the poverty line \r\nset by the United Nations.  \r\n The life of the Chinese people has improved \r\nsignificantly, but we do not yet have a full-fledged \r\nsocial security system. Moreover, we are confronted \r\nwith high employment pressure. Our people are more \r\nand more actively engaged in the country’s social and \r\npolitical development, and citizens’ basic rights and \r\ninterests are better protected, yet our democracy and \r\nlegal system still have room for improvement and such \r\nsocial ills as inequity and corruption still exist. \r\n China has come a long way in modernization. It \r\nis fairly advanced in some areas of development but \r\nremains backward in others. And it faces \r\nunprecedented challenges brought by problems both \r\nold and new.  \r\n Taken as a whole, China is still in the primary \r\nstage of socialism and remains a developing country. \r\nThose are our basic national conditions. That is the real \r\nChina. \r\n China has set the strategic goal of achieving \r\nmodernization by the middle of this century. As they \r\nlook to the coming decades, the Chinese people will \r\ncontinue to advance along the path of reform, opening \r\nup and peaceful development. That path has changed \r\nChina’s destiny and has benefited people throughout \r\nthe country. We must stay on that path and make \r\nfurther improvements. There is no reason whatsoever \r\nfor us to deviate from it. \r\n China will continue to focus on developing the \r\neconomy. Development is our top priority, as it \r\nconstitutes the basis for addressing all issues. We will \r\nrely mainly on our own efforts in pursuing \r\ndevelopment. \r\n As China’s industrialization and urbanization \r\nprogress, hundreds of millions of farmers will move to \r\ntowns and cities, which will create more domestic \r\ndemand than ever, open up broad market and \r\ndevelopment space and serve as a powerful engine for \r\nsustaining the growth of the Chinese economy as well \r\nas the world economy at large. We will work hard to \r\ntransform the economic development pattern, \r\nrestructure the economy and set out on a path of \r\nbalanced and sustainable development. \r\n China will continue to deepen institutional \r\nreform. We will make consistent efforts to improve the \r\nsocialist market economy. We will unswervingly \r\nstrengthen and develop the public sector side of the \r\neconomy and also unswervingly encourage, support \r\nand guide the development of the non-public sector. \r\nWe will pay greater attention to ensuring and \r\nimproving people’s well-being. We will further reform \r\nthe income distribution system and improve the social \r\nsecurity system, including old-age support, medical \r\ncare and unemployment benefit programmes. We will \r\nendeavour to narrow the gap between urban and rural \r\nareas, between different regions and between the rich \r\nand the poor. We want to ensure that each and every \r\ncitizen shares the benefit of China’s reform, opening up \r\nand development.  \r\n While deepening economic restructuring, we will \r\nalso push forward with political restructuring. \r\nOtherwise, we cannot achieve the ultimate goal of \r\neconomic reform and we will lose what we have gained \r\nfrom our modernization drive. We respect and protect \r\nhuman rights, uphold social equity and justice and \r\nstrive to achieve free and all-around development for \r\nour people. That is the important hallmark of a \r\ndemocratic country under the rule of law and a basic \r\nguarantee for any country’s lasting peace and stability. \r\n China will be even more open to the world. \r\nMutually beneficial cooperation for win-win progress \r\nis a long-term strategy that we will stick to in opening \r\nup to the world. We will follow established \r\ninternational rules in expanding business ties with \r\n A/65/PV.11\r\n \r\n43 10-54827 \r\n \r\nother countries. We will continue to improve the \r\nenvironment for foreign investors, optimize the \r\nstructure of foreign capital utilization and explore new \r\nways for overseas investment and cooperation.  \r\n We are committed to promoting the establishment \r\nof a fair, equitable, inclusive and well-managed new \r\ninternational financial order and an open and free \r\ninternational trading regime. We are against \r\nprotectionism in all its manifestations. In the course of \r\nmodernization, we will not only continue to bring in \r\nand utilize advanced achievements from the rest of the \r\nworld in the economic, scientific and technological \r\nfields, but also boldly draw upon the achievements of \r\nhuman civilization in the fields of social management \r\nand cultural development. \r\n China will continue to develop education, science \r\nand technology. How can China narrow the \r\ndevelopment gap with the advanced countries and \r\nenhance the sustainability of its strong growth? I \r\nbelieve two things are of fundamental importance: first \r\nis education, and second is science and technology. \r\nChina has formulated medium- and long-term \r\ndevelopment programmes on education and on science \r\nand technology. Going forward, we will focus our \r\nefforts on implementing those two programmes and \r\nbuilding China into a country strong in human \r\nresources and innovation by 2020. \r\n China will continue to carry forward its fine \r\nculture. The development of a country and rejuvenation \r\nof a nation require not only great economic strength, \r\nbut, more importantly, great cultural strength. The \r\nmoral values and wisdom drawn from the 5,000-year-\r\nold Chinese civilization do not belong to China alone \r\nbut also to the world. We will vigorously develop \r\ncultural programmes and accelerate the development of \r\na moral and ethical code that is commensurate with our \r\nsocialist modernization drive and consistent with the \r\ntraditional virtues of our nation.  \r\n We respect the diversity of civilizations and will \r\nincrease dialogue and exchanges with other \r\ncivilizations to forge a common cultural bond for \r\nhumanity. The Chinese nation, which has created an \r\neconomic miracle, will create a new cultural splendor \r\nas well. \r\n The world of the twenty-first century is far from \r\ntranquil, but gone are the days when problems were \r\nultimately settled by war. Peace and development \r\nremain the defining features of our time.  \r\n China will stay firmly committed to peaceful \r\ndevelopment. One may ask what the essence of \r\npeaceful development is. It is to foster a peaceful \r\ninternational environment for our development and, at \r\nthe same time, contribute to world peace through our \r\ndevelopment. That is something inherent in the concept \r\nof socialism with Chinese characteristics. \r\n In the course of development, China will continue \r\nto take upon itself the duty of promoting the common \r\nprogress and prosperity of mankind. We will seek and \r\nexpand converging interests with other countries. \r\nChina’s development will not harm anyone or pose a \r\nthreat to anyone. There have been Powers who sought \r\nhegemony once they grew strong. China will never \r\nfollow in their footsteps. \r\n China values friendship and also adheres to its \r\nprinciples. It firmly upholds its core interests. When it \r\ncomes to sovereignty, national unity and territorial \r\nintegrity, China will not yield or compromise. \r\n China will continue to firmly support the leading \r\nrole of the United Nations in international affairs. We \r\nwill, as always, abide by the United Nations Charter \r\nand fulfil in good faith our obligations under \r\ninternational conventions. We will intensify \r\ncooperation with fellow developing countries and \r\nsupport their having a greater say in international \r\naffairs. We will remain forever a good partner of and \r\nbrother to developing countries. \r\n China’s stability and development is conducive to \r\na more peaceful international environment, a more \r\ndemocratic international order, a more prosperous \r\nglobal economy and a more harmonious and civilized \r\nworld. China’s development is an opportunity for the \r\nworld, and the world stands to gain from a China that \r\nis better off. History will continue to prove that. \r\n A China that develops peacefully, a China that is \r\nfull of vigour and vitality and a China that is willing \r\nand ready to fulfil its responsibilities will always move \r\nforward together with the world. Let us join hands to \r\nwork for a world of enduring peace and prosperity. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Premier of the State \r\nCouncil of the People’s Republic of China for the \r\nstatement he has just made.  \r\nA/65/PV.11  \r\n \r\n10-54827 44 \r\n \r\n  Mr. Wen Jiabao, Premier of the State Council of \r\nthe People’s Republic of China, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Stephen Harper, Prime Minister \r\nof Canada \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of Canada. \r\n  Mr. Stephen Harper, Prime Minister of Canada, \r\nwas escorted to the rostrum. \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Stephen Harper, Prime \r\nMinister of Canada, and inviting him to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n Mr. Harper (Canada) (spoke in French): It has \r\nnow been more than 65 years since the nations of the \r\nworld, exhausted, and in some cases devastated, by \r\nyears of war, established the United Nations. Canada \r\nwas one of those nations — one of the many, in fact, \r\nwhose fresh experience of conflict had persuaded their \r\npeoples that the possibility of a better world, one in \r\nwhich nations resolved their differences peacefully, \r\nwas an objective worthy of their every effort. \r\n Today, the Canadian people continue to believe in \r\nthat purpose and will continue to strive to live by the \r\nprinciples that would make it possible.  \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n Such principles are enshrined in the Charter of \r\nthis Organization; that same United Nations Charter \r\nendorsed with happiness and hope by a former \r\nCanadian Government on that auspicious June day in \r\nSan Francisco in 1945. \r\n Those foundational beliefs recognize the \r\nsovereign equality of countries. They remind us of the \r\nobligation to settle disputes peacefully, and they \r\ndemand we seek justice and uphold the human rights of \r\nall people. Those are values that Canadians hold dear, \r\nand, as the universal membership of this body implies, \r\nso do peoples the world over. That widespread \r\nconsensus continues to convince the idealist in all of us \r\nthat so much more is possible in this world of ours. \r\n At the same time, it makes the gap between \r\naspiration and achievement so disappointing. It calls us \r\nonward to do more, as successive Canadian \r\nGovernments have worked diligently to do for almost a \r\nlifetime. \r\n Those ideals, as well as an acute awareness of the \r\nbroad concerns of the international community, \r\nespecially those of the developing countries, continue \r\nto animate the Government of Canada, the Government \r\nthat I lead today. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n Those ideals have the enthusiastic support of the \r\nCanadian people, and I do not foresee any day or \r\nmotivation that would lead us to cease in our \r\nendeavours in this regard.  \r\n The question, as always, is how this is to be done. \r\nOur preference is to take meaningful action, action that \r\nproduces real results, action that helps people in their \r\nstruggle with oppression, disaster and poverty. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n Let me just run through some of those actions. As \r\na founding member of the United Nations and the \r\nseventh-largest contributor to its finances, Canada has \r\nbeen a consistently reliable and responsible participant \r\nin United Nations initiatives around the world. This \r\nwas so in the earliest days of the United Nations. It was \r\nso during the difficult days of the cold war, \r\ndecolonization and the struggle against apartheid, and \r\nit remains so today. Canada continues to pay, for \r\ninstance, a heavy price to fulfil our United Nations \r\nobligation to support the lawful Government of \r\nAfghanistan. We pay it with the resources of Canadian \r\ntaxpayers, but more profoundly in sorrow for the \r\npriceless lives of our young men and women who serve \r\nthere in the Canadian forces, as well as, sadly, civilians \r\nwho have also given their sweat and their lives in the \r\nservice of both our country and the people of \r\nAfghanistan. \r\n In Afghanistan, our military efforts have gone \r\nhand in hand with our reconstruction and development \r\nprogrammes. In particular, Canada supports those such \r\nas the Dahla Dam, which will have enduring economic \r\nbenefit. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\nWe have also invested heavily in other programmes \r\nwhich will improve the lives of that country’s most \r\nvulnerable citizens, and we will continue to do so. \r\n Our international engagement is by no means \r\nrestricted to Afghanistan. In fact, elsewhere in the \r\nworld, we have also expanded our efforts. We pledge to \r\n A/65/PV.11\r\n \r\n45 10-54827 \r\n \r\ndouble our aid to Africa,thereby making Canada a \r\nleader in the Group of Eight (G-8). \r\n(spoke in English) \r\nAnd we are on track to double our overall development \r\nassistance by March of next year. Furthermore, we \r\nhave untied food aid, and all Canadian aid will be \r\nuntied by 2013. Such measures significantly extend the \r\npurchasing power of Canadian aid funds. \r\n Canada was also among the first last year at the \r\nG-8 Summit at L’Aquila to double support for \r\nagricultural development. During the economic crisis \r\nas well, we acted, in concert with our Group of Twenty \r\n(G-20) partners, to increase the lending capacity of \r\ndevelopment organizations like the Inter-American \r\nDevelopment Bank and the African Development \r\nBank. In particular, we have made a significant \r\ncontribution to peace and security in Africa, including \r\nto peace initiatives, humanitarian assistance and \r\nreconstruction in the Sudan, since taking office in \r\nJanuary 2006. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\nWe have also provided leadership in peacebuilding in \r\nSierra Leone.  \r\n Canada welcomes the resumption of direct talks \r\nbetween Israel and the Palestinian Authority. We \r\nsincerely hope that the discussions will be successful, \r\nand we will continue to assist the Palestinian Authority \r\nin building its institutions.  \r\n As members know, we have also engaged very \r\nextensively in Haiti, both before and since the terrible \r\nearthquake earlier this year. Canada was among the \r\nfirst nations to provide tangible relief in various forms, \r\nand it has made a long-term commitment to assist the \r\npeople of Haiti in rebuilding their severely damaged \r\ncountry. \r\n Most recently, Pakistan has faced devastating \r\nfloods, and Canada has again responded swiftly. All \r\nthese actions are born from Canadian ideals. \r\n So allow me to say one thing. This Assembly \r\nshould know that Canada is eligible to serve on the \r\nSecurity Council. And if we are elected, we will be \r\nready to serve.  \r\n(spoke in English) \r\nAnd if called upon to serve on the Security Council, we \r\nshall be informed by these ideals and strive to further \r\nthem, just as we have striven to implement Security \r\nCouncil resolutions. \r\n I should also mention Canada’s role this year as \r\nChair of the G-8 and host of the most recent meeting of \r\nthe G-20. We have tried to ensure that these gatherings \r\nserve the broader interests of the entire global \r\ncommunity. In preparation for the G-20, we conducted \r\nwide-ranging outreach sessions, including with the \r\nSecretaries-General of the Commonwealth, la \r\nFrancophonie and, of course, this Organization. We \r\nused our chairmanship of the G-8 to reach out to \r\nleaders from Africa and the Americas and to secure an \r\nagreement to enact the Muskoka Initiative for \r\nmaternal, newborn and child health. \r\n(spoke in French)  \r\nSuch progress is literally vital in meeting the most \r\nachievable of the United Nations Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals — to reduce the appalling \r\nmortality among mothers and children in developing \r\ncountries. \r\n We are mobilizing support from donor nations \r\nand private foundations. Together, we should be able to \r\nmobilize more than $10 billion over five years. This \r\nwill contribute in a major way to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s \r\nHealth. Likewise, we announced here two day ago that \r\nCanadian taxpayers would make an enhanced \r\nreplenishment of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \r\nTuberculosis and Malaria. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n We did these things for one simple reason: to \r\nalleviate the suffering and, indeed, save the lives of \r\npeople all over the world who are among the millions \r\nafflicted with these grave and debilitating diseases. \r\nActions such as these are a moral imperative. It is \r\nessential that we strive to make a significant, actual \r\ndifference in the lives of the world’s most \r\ndisadvantaged people. Who, seeing his neighbour \r\ndistressed, will pass by on the other side of the road? \r\n That is why we have also used our chairmanship \r\nof the G-8 to further the essential ethic of \r\naccountability. We published the first accountability \r\nreport to ensure that, as donor countries, we fulfil the \r\npledges that we make. Our words must be translated \r\ninto action and we must make a real difference to those \r\nwho need our help. And to that end, as many of you \r\nalso know, Canadian taxpayers have forgiven debts \r\nA/65/PV.11  \r\n \r\n10-54827 46 \r\n \r\ntotalling $1 billion owed by the world’s poorest \r\ncountries. \r\n However, let us not limit our horizons by looking \r\njust at the least we can do. Much higher goals are \r\nwithin our capacity if we will but reach for them. In the \r\nshort time that I have here today, there is one thought \r\nabove all others that I wish to share. \r\n(spoke in French)  \r\n It is the pressing need in the twenty-first century \r\nfor all the States of the world to adopt an enlightened \r\nview of sovereignty. As I said earlier, respect for \r\nsovereignty is a fundamental principle of the United \r\nNations. However, the global recession of the past two \r\nyears has taught us, we hope, a painful lesson. We have \r\nbeen forcefully reminded that, in this shrinking world, \r\nwe all travel together in a single boat, not as solo \r\nvoyagers, and that how we travel together matters. This \r\nis because our interests are all interconnected: from \r\nclimate change to health and pandemic threats and to, \r\nof course, the economy. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n For example, nations that do not consider the \r\neffects of their economic choices on others may hurt \r\nnot only their trading partners, but themselves as well. \r\nThose who succumb to the lure of protectionism soon \r\nfind that trading partners denied a market also lack the \r\nmeans to be a customer. To recognize that is to \r\nunderstand the need for enlightened sovereignty, the \r\nidea that what is good for others may well be the best \r\nway to pursue one’s own interests. In business, it is \r\ncalled win-win, and it is good for business. In \r\ninternational affairs, it is good for development and for \r\njustice, and it is in the spirit of the United Nations \r\nCharter. It is therefore of the highest importance, in a \r\npassionate world of competing interests and principles, \r\nwhere every person left to himself does what is right in \r\nhis own sight. In such a world, the need for an \r\nenlightened, expansive view of sovereignty is as great \r\nnow as it ever was. \r\n At the outset of these remarks, I referred to the \r\norigins of the United Nations. It was founded at the end \r\nof the greatest and most destructive war that had ever \r\ndisturbed the ocean of humanity. That war was \r\ncertainly attributable in part to an extreme and \r\npernicious nationalism. But we should never forget that \r\nappeasement and expediency also allowed fascism to \r\ngather such strength that it required the whole and \r\nundivided effort of the world’s free peoples to subdue \r\nit. \r\n The United Nations mission has grown over time, \r\nbut its core job remains the same: through peace and \r\ndevelopment, to build a better world, to prevent war \r\nand conflict, yet at the same time, to uphold what is \r\nright and to protect the weak and the poor from those \r\nwho prey upon them. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n The Government of Canada has always been \r\ndeeply committed to these objectives and to the \r\nOrganization that nurtures them. It remains so today. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n As we attend to our own affairs, in, for example, \r\nthe protection of Canada’s Arctic or the promotion of \r\nour trade or the pursuit of our values, Canada will be \r\nguided by the same advice we prescribe for others. We \r\nwill listen to their concerns, we will speak the truth, \r\nand we will act with vigour. We will do all these things \r\never mindful that peace and opportunity for all remain, \r\nalways, our ultimate purpose.  \r\n I know it has been a long meeting this morning, \r\nand I thank members for their attention. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of \r\nCanada for the statement he has just made.  \r\n \r\n  Mr. Stephen Harper, Prime Minister of Canada, \r\nwas escorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\n  The meeting rose at 2.25 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\n"
