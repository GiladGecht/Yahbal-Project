(Switzerland) \r\n \r\n \r\n  In the absence of the President, Mr. Kleib \r\n(Indonesia), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Mikheil Saakashvili, President of \r\nGeorgia \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of Georgia. \r\nMr. Mikheil Saakashvili, President of Georgia, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Mikheil Saakashvili, \r\nPresident of Georgia, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\n President Saakashvili: It is always a great \r\nhonour for me to address the annual gathering of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n In uncertain times such as ours, cooperation is \r\nmore necessary than ever. Unless we stand together \r\nand invent new approaches to the global challenges we \r\nall face, we shall be torn apart by fear and self-\r\ndestructive interests. Gatherings such as this, therefore, \r\nare valuable only if they allow us to shape a common \r\nvision for concrete action towards peace, development, \r\nsolidarity and justice. \r\n This month, thanks to the coordinated efforts of \r\nthe international community and the leadership of \r\nPresident Obama and Secretary of State Clinton, direct \r\npeace talks have resumed between Israelis and \r\nPalestinians. This is a very important moment, because \r\nthey resume precisely when many people had given up \r\nhope for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. \r\n The road to peace, security, and justice is still a \r\nlong one. The remaining obstacles are enormous. But \r\nthe goal is so noble and necessary that no effort should \r\nbe spared. That is why today I would like to pay tribute \r\nto all those who are taking risks for peace. Yes, risks. \r\nBecause peace is never obvious, never easy. That is \r\ncertainly true in the Middle East, and it is true in my \r\nregion as well. \r\n One of our common goals, then, must be to \r\nenable those risk-takers who have the courage to defy \r\nconventional wisdom and forge new paths to peace. \r\nPeace is not an easy way. But peace is the only way. \r\n As the President of a young democracy that \r\nrecently suffered from war and invasion and is still \r\nunder partial occupation of an important part of its \r\nterritory by a nuclear super-Power, I can say this: peace \r\nis our most precious common goal and, at the same \r\ntime, our only path towards the other goals we share. \r\n To those here and in my own country who see no \r\nway to reverse the armed occupation or reduce regional \r\ntensions, I say: peace is not only the goal, it is also the \r\nmeans to any goal. \r\n Today my region is at a crossroads. For too long, \r\nit has suffered from division, injustice, conflict, \r\ncolonization and violence. Today, however, change is \r\npossible. In fact, change is already taking place. I came \r\nA/65/PV.12  \r\n \r\n10-54833 2 \r\n \r\nhere to speak about this change and to promote a \r\nspecific vision — a vision of a free, stable and united \r\nCaucasus. \r\n From the times of Pushkin, Lermontov or Tolstoy \r\nto the present day, the Caucasian mountains have been \r\na symbol of wilderness and paradoxes, a region where \r\nindividuals and souls were fundamentally free, but \r\nwhere citizens were brutally oppressed; where people \r\nand cultures were deeply tolerant, but where \r\nGovernments and authorities created artificial \r\ndivisions; where shepherds would cross 5,000-metres-\r\nhigh mountains, but where rulers erected walls nobody \r\ncould cross. I have come here today to tell the \r\nAssembly that those times are vanishing, that the \r\ndream of unity and peace is possible. \r\n When I addressed the Assembly two years ago — \r\nin the aftermath of a full-scale invasion, and when the \r\nRussian Foreign Minister was openly discussing with \r\nforeign diplomats and the international community the \r\npossibility of Georgia’s total annihilation — few \r\npeople believed that our country would survive as an \r\nindependent and democratic State. Few people thought \r\nthat our Government would endure, that our economy \r\nwould survive the war and the global crisis, that our \r\nreforms could continue with renewed vigour, or that we \r\nwould make steady progress towards the European \r\nUnion and Euro-Atlantic structures. \r\n Well, I am proud to tell the Assembly, two years \r\nlater, that we have succeeded against all the odds, \r\nthanks to the commitment of the Georgian people and \r\nto the support of friends and allies. Today, Georgia is \r\nback. \r\n Georgia is back, first, as a laboratory for political \r\nreform and social transformation. \r\n More than ever, we are committed to the promise \r\nat the heart of the Rose Revolution to turn a failed \r\nState into a modern European one. Our local elections \r\nlast May were proof of that transformation and a \r\nmilestone for our democracy, the result of seven years \r\nof patient, constant, tireless reform. \r\n Our objective is clear: to create a more \r\ninstitutionalized system of liberal democratic \r\ngovernance. \r\n My term as President ends in 2013. These \r\nchanges will survive my presidency and the current \r\nGovernment, because we are not speaking only about \r\nchanges of leadership or reforms of institutions; we are \r\nspeaking about something deeper and stronger — \r\nsomething that The Economist of London recently \r\nbranded as Georgia’s “mental revolution”. \r\n The Georgian people have tasted freedom, the \r\nabsence of corruption, the fruits of economic \r\ndevelopment, the emergence of a true meritocracy. \r\nThey have changed their behaviour, their vision of the \r\nworld, their dreams even, and they will mightily resist \r\nany attempts to reverse those changes — no matter \r\nwhether those attempts come from inside or from \r\nabroad. \r\n This is our great victory: we helped to create \r\nsomething that goes far beyond the leaders and parties \r\nthat led the Rose Revolution. We helped to create a \r\nrevolution of the heart and the mind. \r\n Once one of the most corrupt countries of the \r\npost-Soviet world, Georgia has made greater gains in \r\nthe fight against corruption, as witnessed by \r\nTransparency International, than any other country \r\nover the past five years. Once a place where foreign \r\ninvestors were kidnapped by gangs and mafias, \r\nGeorgia is now ranked by the World Bank as number \r\n11 for ease of doing business in the world — a ranking \r\nwe hope to further improve this year — and the \r\nnumber 1 in Eastern and Central Europe. These \r\nrankings make clear why Georgia’s only interest is a \r\npeaceful resolution of conflicts: Georgia is winning the \r\npeace — Georgia is winning through peace. \r\n Our northern neighbour expected us to change \r\nour path when it imposed on us a full embargo in 2006, \r\ninvaded us in 2008, ethnically cleansed Georgian \r\nregions and illegally occupied 20 per cent of our \r\nterritory, an occupation that continues to this day. All \r\nthese actions had one objective: to destroy the \r\nGeorgian laboratory of political, economic and social \r\nreform — to prevent the region from changing. \r\n We answered those relentless attacks by \r\nreinvigorating our reforms, opening our economy even \r\nmore, and accelerating our social transformation. This \r\nis our policy, and no provocation will ever make us \r\nchange it. Thanks to this commitment to reform, \r\nGeorgia is now a responsible international player. \r\n I am proud that my nation is fighting \r\ninternational terrorism in Afghanistan. I pay tribute \r\nhere to our nearly 1,000 soldiers who are risking their \r\nlives every day in the south of Afghanistan to help the \r\nAfghan people secure a stable, terror-free future. I pay \r\n A/65/PV.12\r\n \r\n3 10-54833 \r\n \r\na special tribute today to company commander First \r\nLieutenant Mukhran Shukvani, who died earlier this \r\nmonth. Mukhran was killed in the cause of peace, \r\nwhile serving alongside NATO forces in the dangerous \r\nHelmand province of Afghanistan. \r\n We are fighting other common scourges, now \r\nfocusing especially on the terrible danger of nuclear \r\ntrafficking. Many times over the past seven years we \r\nhave intercepted criminals who had in their possession \r\nthe essential ingredients for nuclear devices. Every step \r\nof the way, we have cooperated with our allies in the \r\ninternational community to ensure that Georgia is \r\ndoing everything possible to confront this global \r\ndanger. \r\n Here I must pause to draw attention to a grave \r\nproblem that resulted from the partial occupation of my \r\ncountry — a problem that everybody should worry \r\nabout, even those who overlook and do not care too \r\nmuch about violations of international law, who forget \r\n500,000 internally displaced persons and refugees; \r\neven those who dismiss repeated assaults on basic \r\nhuman rights, civil liberties and the environment. \r\n I am speaking of the lawlessness bred by the \r\nRussian occupation. Our two occupied regions exist in \r\na black hole of governance. Today, in those lands, \r\ncriminals act with impunity. The most elemental human \r\nrights are abused. Drugs and weapons are smuggled. \r\nPeople are trafficked. And potential weapons of mass \r\ndestruction are moved in and out of the territories, \r\nposing a threat to us all. \r\n Three days ago, we met in this very place to \r\ndiscuss the Millennium Development Goals and our \r\nprogress in meeting them over the past decade. I shall \r\nnot tire the Assembly with a recitation of our efforts to \r\nachieve the Goals, the strides we have made in halving \r\nour poverty rate and decreasing by two thirds our \r\nextreme poverty, reforming our educational system and \r\nimproving health care. \r\n But I will tell the Assembly that all those \r\nsuccesses remain bittersweet for me, because they \r\ncannot be savoured by all the people of Georgia — not \r\nby those who live in fear for their basic rights in the \r\noccupied territories, nor fully by the 500,000 internally \r\ndisplaced persons and refugees who were expelled \r\nfrom their homes and cannot go back and regain their \r\nproperty. \r\n For the last two years the Russian Federation has \r\nbeen violating the ceasefire agreement brokered in \r\nAugust 2008 by my good friend French President \r\nNicolas Sarkozy, who was acting at the time on behalf \r\nof the European Union. The Russian army has not \r\nwithdrawn as required by the ceasefire. European \r\nUnion monitors cannot enter Russian-occupied areas of \r\nGeorgia, where a constant military build-up is taking \r\nplace. Hundreds of thousands of internally displaced \r\npersons, victims of the ethnic cleansing campaign led \r\nby the Russian forces, are still prevented from entering \r\ntheir homes. \r\n How did Georgia respond to those violations of \r\ninternational law and human rights? We answered with \r\npatience and calm. We implemented — fully — the \r\nceasefire agreement and went beyond our obligations, \r\nwithout ever using as a pretext Russia’s refusal to \r\ncomply. Last month, the head of the European Union \r\nMonitoring Mission in Georgia, Ambassador Haber, \r\npublicly praised Georgian policy as “constructive \r\nunilateralism”. \r\n What does constructive unilateralism mean? It \r\nrefers, for instance, to our calm when militias \r\nsupported by Russia’s federal security service (FSB) \r\nkilled our policemen at the occupation line, or to our \r\nwillingness to free criminals working for the \r\noccupation regime when the other side was kidnapping \r\nteenagers who wanted to visit their empty house just \r\nafter their school time. \r\n Constructive unilateralism means that we behave \r\nin a civilized and patient way, even when our enemy \r\nuses barbaric methods or implements an impulsive and \r\nirrational policy. It means that — even if peace \r\nrequires both sides to come to the negotiating table — \r\none can pave the way to peace on one’s own, without \r\nthe other side’s cooperating. \r\n This constructive unilateralism is based on the \r\nidea that peace is in the supreme interest of Georgia, \r\nthat peace is the only path to the de-occupation of our \r\ncountry. It forms the substance of the strategy on \r\noccupied territories that my Government has put in \r\nmotion to engage the populations held hostage by the \r\nRussian occupiers, on the other side of the new Iron \r\nCurtain that illegally divides our country. \r\n Like the Berlin Wall, walls like the one dividing \r\nGeorgia will be brought down not by bombs, but by the \r\ncommitment of citizens to build a free, united \r\ncountry — and by the commitment of the world \r\nA/65/PV.12  \r\n \r\n10-54833 4 \r\n \r\ncommunity to enforce international law and the \r\nprinciples of the Charter. \r\n This commitment is expressed in the refusal of \r\nnearly the entire world to legitimize the Russian \r\noccupation and the result of ethnic cleansing by \r\nrecognizing the so-called independence of Abkhazia \r\nand the Tskhinvali region, a de facto annexation of \r\nGeorgian territories by the Russian Federation. \r\n It is noticeable that, despite enormous pressure \r\nand multiple threats from Moscow, not a single former \r\nSoviet republic has recognized this dismemberment of \r\nGeorgia. It shows — to the great surprise of those who \r\ndescribe the fall of the Soviet empire as the worst \r\ncatastrophe of the twentieth century — that the old \r\ntimes are definitely over. It shows that the change I \r\nevoked earlier has already taken root. It shows that all \r\nthe former captive nations of Soviet times are now \r\nindependent States that can determine their own \r\npolicies. It is noticeable — and it is noticed in \r\nMoscow. \r\n I solemnly call today on those three, isolated \r\nMember States that recognized Russia’s de facto \r\nannexation of our territories and legitimized the \r\nRussian-led ethnic cleansing of around 500,000 \r\ncitizens, to acknowledge that it is never too late to \r\nreverse a bad policy. The dismemberment of Georgia \r\nhas failed categorically — and even the Russian \r\nFederation will one day need to reverse its disastrous \r\npolicy. Imagine how uncomfortable those leaders from \r\nfaraway countries will be when Moscow itself chooses \r\nto comply with international law and withdraw its \r\ntroops. Because that day will come. \r\n Those who claimed a military victory in 2008 \r\nnow face a diplomatic and political defeat. And in \r\nMoscow the occupation and annexation will soon be \r\ndebated. They are in fact already debated in the \r\ncorridors of the Kremlin, because this situation is not \r\nsustainable, even for the Russian leadership. \r\n We have now in our country Russian soldiers \r\ndeserting their units and fleeing to the Georgian side \r\nthrough the wall erected by their superiors, just as \r\nSoviet soldiers did in Berlin during the cold war. In \r\nwhich direction is history moving? Certainly not in the \r\ndirection of those who can deploy thousands of tanks \r\nin a very short time, but who cannot even take care of \r\ntheir soldiers or prevent them from fleeing. \r\n Those who refuse to modernize their society and \r\nto open their political system may have an interest in \r\nwar and instability. But in Georgia we know, and we \r\nhave always known, that peace is our interest — the \r\nvery precondition of our survival and our success. \r\n I have three calls to make today. \r\n My first call is addressed to my fellow citizens, \r\nethnic Abkhaz and Ossetian, who live behind the new \r\nIron Curtain that divides our common nation. I want to \r\ntell them once again: We will protect your rights, your \r\nculture, your history — we will work with you, we will \r\nwork for you. You are part of a common history, a \r\ncommon culture and a common future. Your \r\ndifferences enrich our proud national tapestry. Rather \r\nthan see you succumb to annexation by the emerging \r\nRussian empire, we invite you to build together with us \r\na multicultural and multi-ethnic society that will be a \r\nregional model for tolerance and respect. \r\n I dream about the day when — as has happened \r\nseveral times in our common history — an Abkhaz or \r\nOssetian citizen of Georgia becomes President and \r\nleader of a democratic and European Georgia. And this \r\ndream will become possible in a reunited and free \r\nGeorgia, a Georgia that will build positive relations \r\nand even intense cooperation with the Russian \r\nFederation, a Russian Federation acting as a rational \r\ninternational player and not as a revisionist or \r\nrevanchist Power; a Russian Federation that will have \r\nchosen cooperation instead of confrontation and has \r\ndropped the politics of embargoes and intolerance, and \r\ninstead of imposing crackdowns will be a good partner \r\nto cooperate with. \r\n My second call is, therefore, to the Russian \r\nleadership, to whom I say: You face a choice. Either \r\nyou take a major part in the ongoing transformation of \r\nour common region, accepting that other countries are \r\nyour partners and not vassals, or this transformation \r\nwill happen without you. We all want — I personally \r\nwant — Russia as a great partner and not as an enemy. \r\nThat is why the Georgian Government supports the \r\nreset policy of the United States and the European \r\nUnion’s engagement with Russia. Nobody has a greater \r\nstake than we have in seeing Russia turn into a country \r\nthat truly operates within the concert of nations, \r\nrespects international law and — this is often \r\nconnected — upholds basic human rights. \r\n I want to tell the Russian people that they will \r\nalways be welcome in Georgia, as tourists, as students, \r\n A/65/PV.12\r\n \r\n5 10-54833 \r\n \r\nas businessmen, as journalists or simply as friends, but \r\nnever as occupation forces. And I want to tell the \r\nRussian leaders that they should care more about their \r\ncitizens and less about our diplomatic orientation, more \r\nabout developing the Northern Caucasus — a region \r\nthat is exploding as I speak — than about undermining \r\nour development. They are welcome to come too if \r\nthey want, in order to understand how a post-Soviet \r\nsociety can turn into a European one.  We invite them \r\nto come, with notebooks rather than with missiles, with \r\niPads rather than Kalashnikovs. \r\n I was pleased to note that some of our reforms \r\ninspired a few recent presidential speeches in Moscow. \r\nInstead of fighting each other, we should excel together \r\nin modernizing our common region. And instead of \r\nsecretly copying or envying our reforms, they should \r\ncooperate with us in building a stable and free region, \r\nbuilding stable and free countries. Because by looking \r\nover the best pupil’s shoulder one might not get the full \r\npicture of what modernization means. The complete \r\npicture is rather simple: lasting stability and prosperity \r\ncannot be achieved without respecting some basic \r\nprinciples. \r\n Modernization without freedom is not sustainable. \r\nOne cannot hope to diversify and develop one’s \r\neconomy when one sends one’s most talented and \r\nsuccessful businessmen to the Gulag, as happened to \r\nMikhail Khodorkovsky. Computers are not enough \r\nwithout free minds to use them. So let us free our \r\nminds from our common Soviet past in order to build a \r\ncommon future. \r\n My third and final call is to every member of the \r\ninternational community: help us to secure peace — in \r\nGeorgia, but also in our broader region. We Georgians \r\nhave learned tragically how a so-called frozen conflict \r\ncan very quickly become a hot one. \r\n If there is clear support from the international \r\ncommunity, I am convinced that a lasting peace can be \r\nsecured in the Caucasus. I am convinced that if the \r\nworld shows the same commitment to a peaceful \r\nresolution of conflicts in my region as in other parts of \r\nthe world we can accomplish wonders. It is in \r\neverybody’s interest to see this strategic region, this \r\ncrossroads of civilizations, become more stable, \r\nprosperous and open. \r\n History has taught us that wars can erupt \r\nquickly — but also that brave leaders can secure peace \r\nwhere nobody would ever believe that conflicts could \r\nbe resolved. History has taught us that regions that \r\nwere torn apart by armed conflicts and contaminated \r\nby hate — starting with Europe — can achieve lasting \r\npeace through cooperation, interdependence and unity. \r\nHistory has taught us that dreams are often more \r\nrealistic than resignation. \r\n I strongly believe that a common market, shared \r\ninterests and political and economic interdependence \r\nwill one day give birth to a united Caucasus. That is \r\nwhat I call for today. \r\n We share a similar history of oppression, but we \r\nhave also in common a deep, essential and undefeated \r\naspiration for freedom. Let us capitalize on this \r\naspiration. Our region will never be truly free if it is \r\nnot united. \r\n It will of course require a long and difficult series \r\nof efforts and gestures, from all of us, but the objective \r\nis worth every sacrifice. As happened a long time ago \r\nwith the European Union — that amazing geopolitical \r\nrevolution we aspire to join one day — the historic \r\nmove towards Caucasian unity will start with concrete \r\nprojects, in the energy sector, in the education and the \r\ncultural fields and in the civil society sphere. \r\n We should begin with more people-to-people \r\nexchanges. It is time we got to know each other and \r\nforged links that will bring us together without \r\nchanging existing inter-State borders. \r\n My birth town and our capital, Tbilisi, is \r\ninhabited by Caucasians of every religion and every \r\nethnicity. Together they form a living example of \r\ntolerance and cooperation. So it is possible. We leaders \r\nhave to learn from this cohabitation of peoples and \r\ntranslate it into geopolitics. \r\n Our unity would not be directed against anyone. \r\nOnce again, we will not aspire to change any borders. \r\nThat needs to be emphasized. \r\n We may belong to different States and ethnic \r\ngroups, and live on different sides of the mountains, \r\nbut in terms of human and cultural space there is no \r\nNorth and South Caucasus; there is only one Caucasus, \r\nwhich belongs to world civilization and Europe and \r\nwill one day join the big European family of free \r\nnations, following the Georgian path. \r\n We, the Caucasians, driven by legitimate or \r\nimaginary threats of assimilation or attacks from other \r\nPowers, or from each other, hoped too often to be \r\nA/65/PV.12  \r\n \r\n10-54833 6 \r\n \r\nprotected by neighbouring empires. This anxious \r\nsearch for foreign shelter led us to subjugation, \r\nassimilation, annexation and historical tragedy. It \r\nauthorized foreign leaders to artificially emphasize and \r\nmanipulate our divisions. \r\n We — Caucasian people — all made the same \r\nmistake through history. It is time to change. It is time \r\nto stick together, to help each other to survive and \r\nprogress. It is time to understand that our region has \r\nsufficient resources and potential for all of us. It is time \r\nto rely on ourselves, on the human potential of our \r\ncitizens, on development of our own education system, \r\nand time to organize our own development. \r\n The Caucasus is one of the birthplaces of world \r\ncivilization. It is time to show that the energy of our \r\nancestors does not belong only to an iconic past, and \r\nthat we have something to give to our children and to \r\nthe world. It is time to stop fighting and weakening \r\neach other and to realize that our strength consists in \r\nunity. It is time for unity and peace. It is time to stop \r\nbeing prisoners of the past and to move towards our \r\ncommon future. \r\n In the past, Georgian citizens perceived our \r\nborder with the Ottoman Empire as an absolute threat. \r\nToday, we have passport-free customs; we can enter \r\neach other’s country without passports and visas. We \r\nhave a joint airport and free trade with Turkey, and \r\nvery friendly relations. Tomorrow, the citizens of \r\nArmenia and Azerbaijan will be able to cross our \r\nborders without passports. Even today there is a very \r\nsimplified procedure; they do not even have to leave \r\ntheir cars. \r\n Recently, a foreign diplomat told me that after \r\ncrossing our only legal crossing point with Russia he \r\nencountered dozens of roadblocks where dangerous-\r\nlooking, unshaven local militiamen and FSB agents \r\nkept blocking the passage from one valley to another, \r\nfrom one village to another, aggressively preventing \r\nindividuals from circulating in their own country. \r\nThere is also talk about the eventuality of, and \r\npreparation for, a new war with Georgia. \r\n It is time to replace those people, barbed wire and \r\nroadblocks by open borders and passport-free customs, \r\nto replace camps for internally displaced persons by \r\njoint schools and universities, to replace the \r\nKalashnikov by computers, and to replace missiles by \r\nbooks or television sets. \r\n In 2008, thousands and thousands of tanks, \r\narmoured vehicles, artillery platforms, troops and \r\nmilitias crossed the Caucasian mountains, bringing \r\ndestruction, death and hatred. Now it is time for \r\nideas — the ideas of freedom and unity that we all \r\ncherish — to cross the same mountains, bringing hope, \r\nlife and even love. \r\n As I speak, thousands of tanks, armoured vehicles \r\nand missile platforms are entrenched or moving all \r\nacross the Caucasus. If we remain on our own, isolated \r\nfrom each other, they surely will prevail. But if \r\neverybody holds his neighbour’s hand, if tens of \r\nmillions of unarmed people peacefully stand together, \r\nshoulder to shoulder, being the continuation of each \r\nother, just like the Caucasian mountains, then no brutal \r\nforce will ever break through this chain of awakened \r\nhuman spirits and this irresistible thirst for freedom. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of Georgia for \r\nthe statement he has just made. \r\n  Mr. Mikheil Saakashvili, President of Georgia, \r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, President \r\nof the Islamic Republic of Iran \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will hear \r\nan address by the President of the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran. \r\n  Mr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, President of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, \r\nPresident of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly. \r\n President Ahmadinejad (spoke in Farsi; English \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): I am \r\ngrateful to the Almighty God who has granted me the \r\nopportunity to appear before this world Assembly once \r\nagain. \r\n I wish to begin by commemorating those who lost \r\ntheir lives in the horrible flood in Pakistan and \r\nexpressing my heartfelt sympathy with the families \r\nwho lost their loved ones, as well as with the people \r\n A/65/PV.12\r\n \r\n7 10-54833 \r\n \r\nand the Government of Pakistan. I urge everyone to \r\nassist their fellow men and women as a humane duty. \r\n Let me thank Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, who \r\npresided over the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth \r\nsession, for all his efforts during his tenure. I also \r\ncongratulate Mr. Joseph Deiss on being elected to \r\npreside over the current session, and wish him every \r\nsuccess. \r\n In past years, I have spoken to the Assembly \r\nabout some hopes and concerns; some concerns \r\ninvolve family crises, the security challenge, disrespect \r\nfor human dignity, the deterioration of the world \r\neconomy, climate change and disregard for human \r\naspirations to achieve justice and lasting peace. \r\n After about a hundred years of domination, the \r\ncapitalist system and the existing world order have \r\nproved to be unable to provide appropriate solutions to \r\nthe problems of societies; thus their demise has come \r\nabout. I shall try to examine several causes of this \r\nfailure and picture features of an ideal order. \r\n The first cause of failure relates to our attitudes \r\nand beliefs. As the Assembly is well aware, the divine \r\nprophets had the mission to call everyone to \r\nmonotheism, love and justice and to show mankind the \r\npath to prosperity. They invite men to contemplation \r\nand to seek knowledge in order to better appreciate the \r\ntruth and to refrain from atheism and egoism. \r\n The essence of the message of all prophets is one \r\nand the same. Every messenger endorsed the \r\nmessenger before him, and gave glad tidings about the \r\nprophet to come, who presented a more complete \r\nversion of the religion in accordance with man’s \r\ncapacity at the time. This trend continued until the last \r\nmessenger of God, who presented the perfection of an \r\nall-inclusive religion. \r\n In opposition to the call by the prophets, the \r\negoist and the greedy stood up against their clear call, \r\nrevolting against their messages. Nimrod countered \r\nHazrat Abraham, Pharaoh countered Hazrat Moses, and \r\nthe greedy countered Hazrat Jesus Christ and Hazrat \r\nMuhammad — may peace be upon all our prophets. \r\n In recent centuries, human ethics and values have \r\nbeen rejected as a cause of backwardness. They were \r\neven portrayed as opposing wisdom and science, \r\nbecause the proclaimers of religion in the dark ages of \r\nthe West inflicted man with backwardness. Therefore, \r\nman’s disconnection from heaven has detached him \r\nfrom his true self. \r\n Man — with his potential to understand the \r\nsecrets of the universe, his instinct to seek truth, his \r\naspirations for justice and perfection, his quest for \r\nbeauty and purity, and his capacity to represent God on \r\nEarth — has been reduced to a creature restricted by \r\nthe materialistic world with a mission to maximize \r\nindividualistic pleasures. Human instinct, then, \r\nreplaced true human nature. \r\n Human beings and nations are considered rivals, \r\nand the happiness of an individual or a nation is upheld \r\nat the cost of others, to the point of even eliminating or \r\nsuppressing others; rather than developing a \r\nconstructive and evolutionary method of cooperation, it \r\nwas replaced by a destructive struggle for survival. The \r\nlust for capital and domination replaced monotheism, \r\nwhich is the gateway to love and unity. \r\n This widespread clash of the egoist with the \r\ndivine values gave way to slavery and colonialism. A \r\nlarge part of the world came under the domination of a \r\nfew Western States. Tens of millions of people were \r\ntaken into slavery, and tens of millions of families were \r\nshattered as a result. All the resources, the rights and \r\nthe cultures of the colonized nations were plundered. \r\nLands were occupied and the indigenous people were \r\nhumiliated and mass-murdered. \r\n Yet, nations rose up, colonialism was alienated, \r\nand the independence of nations was recognized. Thus, \r\nthe hope for respect, prosperity and security was \r\nrevived among nations. In the beginning of the past \r\ncentury beautiful motives of freedom, human rights \r\nand democracy created hopes for healing the deep \r\nwounds of the past. Today, however, not only are those \r\ndreams not realized, but memories, even at times more \r\nbitter than before, have been recorded in our history. \r\n As a result of the two World Wars, the occupation \r\nof Palestine, the Korean and Viet Nam wars, the Iraq \r\nwar against Iran, the occupation of Afghanistan and \r\nIraq, as well as many wars in Africa, hundreds of \r\nmillions of people were killed, wounded or displaced. \r\nTerrorism, illicit drug production, poverty and social \r\ngaps have increased. The dictatorial and coups d’état \r\nGovernments in Latin America committed \r\nunprecedented crimes, with the support of the West. \r\n Instead of disarmament, the proliferation and \r\nstockpiling of nuclear, biological and chemical \r\nA/65/PV.12  \r\n \r\n10-54833 8 \r\n \r\nweapons expanded, putting the world under a bigger \r\nthreat. As a result, the very same old goals of \r\ncolonialists and the slave masters were pursued, but \r\nthis time around with a new façade. \r\n The second cause of the failure of the existing \r\nworld order and capitalism has to do with the current \r\nglobal management and its ruling structures. The \r\nLeague of Nations and then the United Nations were \r\nestablished with the promise of bringing about peace, \r\nsecurity and the realization of human rights, which in \r\nfact meant a global management. \r\n One can analyse the current system for \r\ngovernance of world affairs by examining three events. \r\n The first event is that of 11 September 2001, \r\nwhich has affected the whole world for almost a \r\ndecade. We recall that at the time suddenly the news of \r\nan attack on the Twin Towers was broadcast using \r\nnumerous footages of the incident. Almost all \r\nGovernments and important figures strongly \r\ncondemned this incident. But then a propaganda \r\nmachine came into full force; it was implied that the \r\nwhole world was now exposed to a huge danger — \r\nterrorism — and that the only way to save the world \r\nwas to deploy forces into Afghanistan. Eventually \r\nAfghanistan and shortly thereafter Iraq were occupied. \r\n I ask the Assembly please to take note: It was \r\nsaid that some 3,000 people were killed on \r\n11 September, for which we are all very saddened. Yet \r\nso far in Afghanistan and Iraq hundreds of thousands of \r\npeople have been killed, while millions have been \r\nwounded and displaced, and the conflict is still going \r\non and expanding. \r\n In identifying those responsible for the \r\n11 September attack, there were three viewpoints. The \r\nfirst was that a very powerful and complex terrorist \r\ngroup, able to successfully cross all layers of American \r\nintelligence and security, carried out the attack. That is \r\nthe prevalent viewpoint advocated by American \r\nstatesmen. \r\n The second viewpoint was that some segments \r\nwithin the United States Government orchestrated the \r\nattack to reverse the declining American economy and \r\nits grip on the Middle East in order also to save the \r\nZionist regime. The majority of the American people as \r\nwell as other nations and politicians around the world \r\nagree with this view. \r\n The third viewpoint was that the attack was \r\ncarried out by a terrorist group, but that the American \r\nGovernment supported and took advantage of the \r\nsituation. Apparently, this viewpoint has fewer \r\nproponents. \r\n The main evidence for that viewpoint links the \r\nincident to a few passports found in the huge volume \r\nof rubble and a video of an individual whose place of \r\ndomicile was unknown, but it was announced that he \r\nhad been involved in oil deals with some American \r\nofficials. It was also covered up and said that due to the \r\nexplosion and fire no trace of suicide attackers was \r\nfound. \r\n Regardless of each of those three viewpoints, \r\nthere remain a few questions to be answered. \r\n First, would it not have been sensible that first a \r\nthorough investigation should have been conducted by \r\nindependent groups to conclusively identify the \r\nelements involved in the attack and then map out a \r\nrational plan to take measures against them? \r\n Secondly, assuming the viewpoint of the \r\nAmerican Government, is it rational to launch a classic \r\nwar through widespread deployment of troops that led \r\nto the death of hundreds of thousands of people to \r\ncounter a terrorist group? \r\n Thirdly, was it not possible to act in the way in \r\nwhich Iran conducted the operations fighting the Riggi \r\nterrorist group, who killed and wounded 400 innocent \r\npeople? In the Iranian operation no innocent person \r\nwas harmed. \r\n It is proposed that the United Nations set up an \r\nindependent fact-finding group in regard to the event \r\nof 11 September to ensure that the different views \r\nabout it are not banned from future discussions. \r\n I wish to announce here that next year the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran will host a conference to study \r\nterrorism and the means to confront it. I invite \r\nofficials, scholars, thinkers, researchers and research \r\ninstitutes of all countries to attend the conference. \r\n The second cause of the demise of the existing \r\nworld order is the occupation of the Palestinian \r\nterritories. The oppressed people of Palestine have \r\nlived under the rule of an occupying regime for \r\n60 years, and have been deprived of freedom, security \r\nand the right to self-determination, while the occupiers \r\nare given recognition. On a daily basis, houses are \r\n A/65/PV.12\r\n \r\n9 10-54833 \r\n \r\nbeing destroyed over the heads of innocent women and \r\nchildren. People are deprived of water, food and \r\nmedicine in their own homeland. \r\n The Zionists have imposed five all-out wars on \r\nthe neighbouring countries and on the Palestinian \r\npeople. The Zionists committed the most horrible \r\ncrimes against defenceless people in the wars against \r\nLebanon and Gaza. The Zionist regime attacked a \r\nhumanitarian flotilla in a blatant defiance of all \r\ninternational norms and killed civilians. This regime, \r\nwhich enjoys the absolute support of some Western \r\ncountries, regularly threatens the countries in the \r\nregion and continues publicly to announce the \r\nassassination of Palestinian figures, while Palestinian \r\ndefenders and those opposing the regime are pressured, \r\nlabelled as terrorists and called anti-Semites. All \r\nvalues, even the freedom of expression, which seem to \r\nmatter so much in Europe and in the United States, and \r\nto be so important, have been sacrificed at the altar of \r\nZionism. \r\n Solutions are doomed to fail because the right of \r\nthe Palestinian people is not taken into account. Would \r\nwe have witnessed such horrendous crimes if instead of \r\nthe occupation being recognized, the sovereign right of \r\nthe Palestinian people had been recognized? \r\n Our unambiguous proposition favours the return \r\nof the Palestinian refugees to their home land and a \r\nvote by the people of Palestine, all Palestinians, to \r\nexercise their sovereignty and decide on their type of \r\ngovernance. \r\n The third cause of the demise of the existing \r\norder has to do with the outlook on nuclear energy. \r\nNuclear energy is clean and cheap and a heavenly gift \r\nwhich is among the most suitable alternatives to cut \r\npollution emanating from fossil fuels. The \r\nNon-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) allows all States \r\nparties to use nuclear energy without limits, and the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is \r\nmandated to provide such States with technical and \r\nlegal support. \r\n The nuclear bomb is the worst inhumane weapon, \r\nand must be totally eliminated. The NPT prohibits its \r\ndevelopment and stockpiling, and calls for nuclear \r\ndisarmament. Nonetheless, some permanent members \r\nof the Security Council and other nuclear Powers — \r\nthose that possess the nuclear bomb — have resorted to \r\nthe following measure. They have equated nuclear \r\nenergy with the nuclear bomb, and have removed such \r\nenergy from the reach of most nations by establishing \r\nmonopolies and pressuring IAEA. At the same time, \r\nthey have continued to maintain, expand and upgrade \r\ntheir own nuclear arsenals. The Assembly may have \r\nheard that in the current year the United States \r\nAdministration has asked for $80 billion to maintain its \r\nnuclear bombs. \r\n The situation that I have described has entailed \r\nthe following: Not only has nuclear disarmament not \r\nbeen realized, but also nuclear bombs have proliferated \r\nin some regions, including by the occupying and \r\nintimidating Zionist regime. Here I would like to \r\npropose that 2011 be proclaimed the year of nuclear \r\ndisarmament and nuclear energy for all, nuclear \r\nweapons for none. \r\n In all the cases to which I have referred, I admit, \r\nthe United Nations has been unable to take any \r\neffective, viable course of action. Unfortunately, in the \r\ndecade proclaimed as the “International Decade for the \r\nCulture of Peace” hundreds of thousands have been \r\nkilled and injured as a result of war, aggression and \r\noccupation, and hostilities and antagonism have \r\nincreased. \r\n Very recently the world witnessed an abhorrent \r\nand inhumane act of burning the Holy Koran. The Holy \r\nKoran is the Divine Book and the eternal miracle of the \r\nProphet of Islam. It calls for worshipping the One God, \r\njustice, compassion towards people, development and \r\nprogress, reflection and thought, defence of the \r\noppressed and resistance against oppressors; and it \r\nnames with respect the previous Messengers of God, \r\nsuch as Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Joseph, Moses and \r\nJesus Christ — may peace be upon all the prophets — \r\nand endorses them. The Koran was burned to burn all \r\nthose truths and good judgements. \r\n However, the truth cannot be burned. The Koran \r\nis eternal, because God and truth are everlasting. This \r\nact and any other act that widens the gap and distances \r\nbetween nations is evil. We should wisely avoid \r\nplaying into the hands of Satan. On behalf of the \r\nIranian nation, I pay respect to all divine books and \r\ntheir followers. In one hand I hold up the Koran and in \r\nthe other the Bible. We pay respect to both books, as \r\nboth are dear to us. \r\n For years the inefficiency of capitalism and the \r\nexisting world management structures have been \r\nexposed enough for us to understand what they mean. \r\nThe majority of States and peoples have begun a quest \r\nA/65/PV.12  \r\n \r\n10-54833 10 \r\n \r\nfor fundamental changes and to allow justice in global \r\nrelations to prevail. \r\n The cause of the United Nations ineptitude is its \r\nunjust structure. Major Powers have monopolized the \r\nSecurity Council, due to their veto privilege, and \r\nsidelined the General Assembly, which is the main \r\npillar of the Organization. \r\n In the past several decades, at least one \r\npermanent member of the Security Council has always \r\nbeen a party to a conflict. When both the judge and the \r\nprosecutor are on the same side of a conflict, how can \r\none expect justice? They feel immune in aggression \r\nowing to the structure of the United Nations. For \r\nexample, if Iran enjoyed the veto privilege, would the \r\nSecurity Council and the IAEA Director General have \r\ntaken the same position on the nuclear issue? \r\n The United Nations is the key centre for \r\ncoordinating common global management. Its structure \r\nneeds to be reformed in such a manner that all \r\nindependent States and nations may participate actively \r\nand constructively in global governance. \r\n The veto privilege should be revoked. The \r\nGeneral Assembly should be the highest body, and the \r\nSecretary-General should be the most independent \r\nofficial and all his positions and activities should be \r\ntaken with the approval of the General Assembly and \r\nshould be directed towards promoting justice and \r\neliminating discrimination in the world order. \r\n The Secretary-General should not come under \r\npressure from Powers and/or the country hosting the \r\nOrganization for stating the truth and administering \r\njustice. It is proposed that the General Assembly \r\nshould, within a year and in the framework of an \r\nextraordinary session, finalize the reformation of the \r\nOrganization’s structure. The Islamic Republic of Iran \r\nhas clear suggestions in this regard and stands ready to \r\nparticipate actively and constructively in the process. \r\n I announce clearly that the occupation of other \r\ncountries under the pretext of freedom and democracy \r\nis an unforgivable crime. The world needs the logic of \r\ncompassion and justice and inclusive participation \r\ninstead of the logic of force, domination, unilateralism, \r\nwar and humiliation. The world needs to be governed \r\nby virtuous people like the Divine Prophets. \r\n The two vast geographical spheres of Africa and \r\nLatin America have experienced historic developments \r\nduring past decades, developments that have changed \r\ntheir face. The new approaches in these two continents, \r\nbased on an increasing level of integration and unity, as \r\nwell as on localizing the growth and development \r\nmodels, have borne considerable fruits for the peoples \r\nof those regions. The awareness and wisdom of the \r\nleaders of the two continents have overcome the \r\nregional problems and crises, free of the domineering \r\ninterference of non-regional Powers. \r\n The Islamic Republic of Iran has expanded its \r\nrelations with Latin America and Africa in all aspects \r\nin recent years. \r\n And now I speak about the glorious Iran. The \r\nTehran Declaration was a hugely constructive step in \r\nconfidence-building efforts, a step made possible \r\nthrough the admirable good will of the Governments of \r\nBrazil and Turkey, along with the close, sincere and \r\nhonest cooperation of the Iranian Government. \r\nAlthough there was an inappropriate reaction to the \r\nDeclaration by some Western Powers, and it was \r\nfollowed by an unlawful resolution, it is still valid. \r\n We have observed the IAEA regulations beyond \r\nthe requirements of our commitments, yet we have \r\nnever submitted to illegally imposed pressures, nor will \r\nwe ever do so. \r\n It has been said that there is a desire to pressure \r\nIran into a dialogue. Well, first, Iran has always been \r\nready for a dialogue based on respect and justice. \r\nSecondly, methods based on disrespecting nations have \r\nlong been ineffective. Those who have used \r\nintimidation and sanctions in response to the clear \r\nlogic of the Iranian nation are in real terms destroying \r\nthe remaining credibility of the Security Council and \r\nthe trust of nations in it, proving once again how unjust \r\nis the Council’s function. \r\n When those concerned threaten a great nation, a \r\ngreat people, such as Iran, which has been known \r\nthroughout history for its scientists, poets, artists and \r\nphilosophers, and whose culture and civilization are \r\nsynonymous with purity, submission to God and \r\nseeking justice, how can they ever expect other nations \r\nto have confidence in them? \r\n It goes without saying that domineering \r\nmethods — and mainly capitalism — in managing the \r\nworld have failed. Not only has the era of slavery and \r\ncolonialism and dominating the world passed, the path \r\nto reviving old Empires is blocked, too. \r\n A/65/PV.12\r\n \r\n11 10-54833 \r\n \r\n We have announced that we stand ready for a \r\nserious and free debate with the American statesmen in \r\nthis very venue to express our transparent views on \r\nissues of importance to the world. It is proposed here \r\nthat in order to have a constructive dialogue, an annual \r\nfree debate be organized within the General Assembly. \r\n In conclusion, the Iranian nation and the majority \r\nof the world’s nations and Governments are opposed to \r\nthe current discriminatory management of the world. \r\nThe inhumane nature of that management has led it to a \r\ndead end, and it requires a major overhaul. \r\n Reforming the world’s affairs and bringing about \r\ntranquillity and prosperity requires the participation of \r\nall, pure thoughts and the divine and humane \r\nmanagement that we have been given. We are all of the \r\nview that justice is the basic element for peace, durable \r\nsecurity and the spread of love among peoples and \r\nnations. It is in justice that mankind seeks the \r\nrealization of his aspirations, rights and dignity, since \r\nhe is wary of oppression, humiliation and ill-treatment. \r\n The true nature of mankind is manifested in love \r\nfor fellow humans and love for all the good in the \r\nworld. Love is the best foundation for establishing \r\nrelations among people and among nations. As Vahshi \r\nBafgi, the great Iranian poet, says, “From the fountain \r\nof youth, drink a thousand sips/You’ll still die if you \r\ndon’t have love’s grip”. In making a world full of \r\npurity, safety and prosperity, people are not rivals, but \r\ncompanions. Those who see their happiness only in the \r\nsorrow of others and their welfare and safety only in \r\nothers’ insecurity, those who see themselves as superior \r\nto others, are out of the path of humanity and are in \r\nevil’s course. \r\n Economy and materialistic means are only some \r\ntools to serve others, to create friendship and \r\nstrengthen human connections for spiritual perfection. \r\nThey are not tools for showing off or means of \r\ndominating others. \r\n Men and women complement each other, and the \r\nfamily unit, with pure, loving and long-lasting relations \r\nof the spouses, becomes the centre and the guarantee of \r\nthe continuity and bringing up of generations, for true \r\npleasures, for spreading true love and for reforming \r\nsociety. \r\n Woman is a reflection of God’s beauty and the \r\nsource of love and care. She is the guardian of purity \r\nand exquisiteness of society. The tendency to toughen \r\nthe souls and behaviours of women deprives them of \r\ntheir very basic right of being a loving mother and a \r\ncaring wife. It will result in a more violent society with \r\nirreversible defects. \r\n Freedom is a divine right that should serve peace \r\nand human perfection. Pure thoughts and the will of \r\nthe righteous are keys to the gates of a pure life full of \r\nhope, liveliness and beauty. This is the promise of \r\nGod — that the Earth will be inherited by the pure and \r\nthe righteous. And the people free from selfishness will \r\ntake up the management of the world. Then there will \r\nbe no trace of sorrow, discrimination, poverty, \r\ninsecurity and aggression. The time for true happiness \r\nand the blossoming of the true nature of humankind, \r\nthe way God has intended, will arrive. \r\n All those seeking justice and all the free spirits \r\nhave been waiting for this moment and have been \r\npromised such a glorious time. The complete human, \r\nthe true servant of God and the true friend of mankind, \r\nwhose father was from the generation of the beloved \r\nProphet of Islam and whose mother was from the true \r\nbelievers of Jesus Christ, shall wait along with Jesus, \r\nthe son of Mary, and the other righteous to appear on \r\nthose brilliant days and assist humanity. In welcoming \r\nthem, we should join ranks and seek justice, as would \r\nbe befitting of man. \r\n Praise to love and worship, praise to justice and \r\nfreedom, praise to true humanity, the complete human, \r\nthe true companion of humankind. I say to all those \r\nlistening: “Peace be upon you and all the righteous and \r\nthe pure.” \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran for the statement he has just made. \r\nMr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, President of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Ivan Gašparovič, \r\nPresident of the Slovak Republic \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Slovak \r\nRepublic. \r\nMr. Ivan Gašparovič, President of the Slovak \r\nRepublic, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\nA/65/PV.12  \r\n \r\n10-54833 12 \r\n \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Ivan Gašparovič, President \r\nof the Slovak Republic, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\n President Gašparovič (spoke in Slovak; English \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): Let me \r\ncongratulate Mr. Joseph Deiss on his election to \r\npreside over the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth \r\nsession. May the United Nations, under his leadership, \r\nconfirm its central role in global events. Slovakia \r\nstands prepared to support him. I also appreciate the \r\nwork done by his predecessor at the previous session. \r\n The Slovak Republic fully aligns itself with the \r\nEuropean Union’s statements. We are pleased that 27 \r\nEuropean member States, plus other associated \r\ncountries, speak in one voice at this universal \r\ninternational forum. This is a good prerequisite to clear \r\nthe way for widely anticipated effective cooperation \r\nbetween the Union and the United Nations. \r\n Let me now share with the Assembly several \r\nremarks on certain global and regional issues from the \r\nperspective of the Slovak foreign policy priorities. \r\n The foreign policy of Slovakia, as a United \r\nNations member, is based on respect for the core \r\ndemocratic values, international law and effective \r\nmultilateralism. We therefore welcome and support the \r\nmain theme of the sixty-fifth session: “Reaffirming the \r\ncentral role of the United Nations in global \r\ngovernance”. This topic is all the more important since \r\nwe often witness failure to respect binding decisions \r\ntaken by United Nations bodies, and from time to time \r\neven among the various United Nations institutions. \r\n One of the most important missions of the United \r\nNations is to act as a guarantor of the formulation, \r\nprotection and implementation of the principle of \r\ncollective security of States. Hence, the preservation of \r\ninternational peace and security at a global level and \r\nwithin the bounds of international law must remain at \r\nthe core of United Nations activities. For peace and \r\nsecurity become particularly vulnerable in times of \r\nglobal financial and economic crises. They require \r\nincreased attention on our part in order to remain under \r\nthe control of States and the international community. \r\n The process of arms control and disarmament \r\nrepresents the most important instrument for the \r\nprevention of war and other conflict. The progress \r\nachieved in the area of non-proliferation of weapons of \r\nmass destruction gives us reason for cautious \r\noptimism. Our duty is to continue the effort and to \r\nstrengthen the global system of non-proliferation of \r\nweapons of mass destruction. Yet the risk of such \r\nweapons falling into the hands of terrorists remains \r\nhigh. We are also prepared to cooperate with our \r\npartners on a number of priorities, such as the entry \r\ninto force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban \r\nTreaty. \r\n We appreciate the new post-START Treaty \r\nbetween the Russian Federation and the United States. \r\nWe believe that the Treaty will invigorate the process \r\nof disarmament, which is getting off the ground, and \r\nincrease pressure on certain States to desist from their \r\nambitions to own nuclear weapons. In particular, I wish \r\nto underscore the important role played by the \r\nConference on Disarmament, which is described as the \r\nsole multilateral disarmament negotiating forum. \r\n In the area of conventional weapons, it is \r\nnecessary to continue negotiations leading to the \r\nadoption of a new, effective arms trade treaty. \r\nAdequate attention must also be paid to small arms, the \r\nuncontrolled spread of which may have devastating \r\nconsequences for the maintenance of peace and \r\nsecurity, particularly in conflict areas. \r\n United Nations peacekeeping operations \r\nrepresent one of the most visible activities of the \r\nUnited Nations in its efforts to preserve peace and \r\nsecurity in the world. Slovakia, as an active contributor \r\nto United Nations missions and other international \r\ncrisis management operations based on a United \r\nNations mandate, welcomes the steps towards reviving \r\nthe reform of peacekeeping operations as described in \r\nthe document “ A New Partnership Agenda: Charting a \r\nNew Horizon for UN Peacekeeping”. \r\n I believe that the new Global Field Support \r\nStrategy will contribute, in real terms, towards a more \r\nrapid deployment of peacekeeping missions and, at the \r\nsame time, ensure a more efficient utilization of human \r\nand financial resources. \r\n Proper coordination between the United Nations \r\nand regional organizations plays an important role. \r\nThere is room for improvement, for example, when it \r\ncomes to cooperation between the EU and NATO at the \r\noperational level, but also for a more effective \r\ncoordination at strategic level. \r\n A/65/PV.12\r\n \r\n13 10-54833 \r\n \r\n The United Nations must also play a key role in \r\nthe prevention of conflicts. Slovakia supports the \r\nprevention and mediation role of the United Nations \r\nand its capacity-building. It is, however, necessary to \r\nexert synergic efforts taking due account of the \r\ninterests of all stakeholders at the local, regional and \r\nglobal levels in order to eliminate sources of conflict \r\nand proceed directly with establishing peace. \r\n The establishment of the United Nations Regional \r\nCentre for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia, \r\nwhich is headed by a Slovak diplomat, was a step in \r\nthe right direction. The recent events in Kyrgyzstan \r\nconfirmed the usefulness of this instrument and \r\nunderscored the need to support it further. \r\n Slovakia takes an active part in peace processes. \r\nSince our non-permanent membership in the Security \r\nCouncil in 2006 and 2007, we have continued our \r\ninvolvement in security sector reform. We are glad that \r\nsince then several strategic papers have been produced \r\nand that progress has been made in building the \r\nrequisite capacities, particularly in cooperation with \r\nAfrican countries. \r\n As the chair of the Group of Friends of security \r\nsector reform, we continue to actively work towards \r\nstrengthening the relations in this matter between \r\nMember States and the Secretariat. In the course of the \r\nsixty-fourth session of the General Assembly, we \r\nteamed up with our partners from Argentina and \r\nIndonesia to hold regional workshops dealing with \r\nsecurity sector reform in the broader context of \r\npreserving and building peace and, at the same time, \r\nestablishing a link between its global and regional \r\naspects. We are determined to uphold this effort in \r\ncooperation with the Inter-agency Task Force on \r\nSecurity Sector Reform, as well as with other Member \r\nStates and subregional organizations. \r\n Under the Charter, the primary responsibility for \r\ninternational peace and security lies with the Security \r\nCouncil. The process of its reform could almost be \r\ncalled a never-ending story. We are therefore pleased \r\nthat the intergovernmental negotiations on Security \r\nCouncil reform were given a clearer shape. It must \r\nstand on the following pillars: representativeness, \r\neffectiveness in fulfilling its mission and transparency \r\nof its working methods, while allowing for possible \r\nenforcement of its decisions by sanctions. \r\n The global financial and economic crisis laid bare \r\nthe weak spots in the existing structures of the world \r\neconomic order. The key role of the United Nations \r\nand its Member States must also be confirmed in this \r\nfinancial and economic dimension at the global level. \r\n At the High-level Plenary Meeting on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, we shared the view \r\nthat since our efforts in achieving these Goals started \r\nsome 10 years ago they had not become less topical or \r\nless important. Eradicating poverty and hunger, \r\nimproving the quality of education, adequate \r\nemployment, improving health-care services and \r\nhousing, improving maternal health, gender equality \r\nand environmental sustainability remain among the \r\ncentral concerns of United Nations programmes, funds \r\nand specialized agencies. \r\n Everyday life also shows us that creating \r\nconditions for equitable and sustainable development \r\nmust go hand in hand with respect for nature and its \r\nrules. There is an inherent link between the two, and \r\nboth have an impact on the life of individuals, who are \r\npart of the universal system. \r\n The people of Slovakia had the misfortune to \r\nwitness nature’s power as floods of an unprecedented \r\nscale ravaged our country earlier this summer. A proper \r\nbalance must be struck between development and \r\nrespect for nature, based on well-reasoned arguments \r\nsupported by proper analysis, and without giving way \r\nto the influence sought by certain narrowly focused \r\ntransnational organizations that call themselves \r\nenvironmentalists. \r\n For the first time this year, Slovakia took part in \r\nthe Economic and Social Council meetings as a \r\nmember. Our experience shows that we need to \r\nstrengthen the links between the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil and other organizations of the United Nations \r\nsystem and beyond, provided they work towards the \r\nsame objectives. \r\n Slovakia welcomes the establishment of \r\nUN Women — the United Nations Entity for Gender \r\nEquality and Empowerment of Women. We believe that \r\nthis entity will help curb all forms of violence against \r\nwomen. We also extend our good wishes for a \r\nsuccessful mandate to the Secretary-General’s Special \r\nRepresentative on Sexual Violence in Conflict. \r\n Slovakia rejects any and all forms of intolerance, \r\nxenophobia, discrimination, racism and extreme \r\nnationalism. We are devoted to the protection of and \r\nsupport for human rights at both the national and \r\nA/65/PV.12  \r\n \r\n10-54833 14 \r\n \r\ninternational level. We play a leading role in the \r\ninterregional initiative aimed at the adoption of a new \r\noptional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of \r\nthe Child. \r\n Slovakia fully supports the fight to end impunity \r\nfor the perpetrators of the most serious crimes under \r\ninternational law, such as genocide, war crimes and \r\ncrimes against humanity. As a facilitator for the \r\nuniversality and implementation of the Rome Statute of \r\nthe International Criminal Court, we actively work \r\ntowards increasing the number of States Parties to the \r\nRome Statute and towards its proper implementation. \r\n Slovakia closely watches the situation and \r\nproblems in individual regions of the world. \r\n The long-term effort to reach lasting peace in the \r\nMiddle East has failed to yield the expected results. At \r\nthis stage, we appreciate the contributions of all \r\nfacilitators involved in reconciling the demands of both \r\nsides by way of direct Israeli-Palestinian talks that \r\nwere launched recently. We are hopeful that the \r\nPalestinian and Israeli leaders will find a way of \r\ncoming to an agreement that will lay down the final \r\narrangement of their mutual relations. This is necessary \r\nfor world peace. \r\n Africa, as the most troubled continent, continues \r\nto call for special attention by the international \r\ncommunity. We need to address the origin and the \r\nessence of the problems, not only their consequences. \r\nOn the other hand, we are pleased to see the progress \r\nmade in the stabilization and development of countries \r\nsuch as Ghana, Benin, Togo, Mauritius and others. \r\n As members of the United Nations, we all have to \r\nsupport respect for the binding nature of Security \r\nCouncil resolutions — particularly when it comes to \r\npreserving peace around the globe. For this reason, we \r\nsupport diplomatic negotiations on the Iran issue, as \r\nwell as on the situation on the Korean peninsula, which \r\nis a matter of concern. \r\n Slovakia welcomed the conclusions of the Kabul \r\nInternational Conference on Afghanistan. The \r\nConference marked a new phase of partnership \r\nbetween the Afghan Government and the international \r\ncommunity, based on the principle of a gradual \r\nAfghanistanization of the country, that is, the transition \r\nto full Afghan leadership and responsibility to be \r\nachieved in the Kabul Process. Slovakia will continue \r\nto participate in the stabilization and development of \r\nAfghanistan by contributing to NATO- and EU-led \r\nstabilization and training operations and by \r\nimplementing humanitarian and development aid \r\nprojects. \r\n Slovakia remains a staunch supporter of a \r\npeaceful and just settlement of the Cyprus issue under \r\nthe auspices of the Secretary-General. More than \r\n20 years of our support for negotiations and the \r\ncontinued involvement, since 2001, of the largest \r\ncontingent of the Slovak armed forces in the United \r\nNations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus within the \r\nUnited Nations crisis management operations, bear \r\nwitness to our engagement in this respect. \r\n As for the Western Balkans, we are looking to \r\nstrengthen stability and support democratic processes. \r\nWe wish for the European integration processes of the \r\nWestern Balkan countries to move forward. We also \r\nwish for the Balkans to see peace agreements and not \r\nimposed solutions. \r\n The United Nations must be able to effectively \r\nrespond to the current challenges of the twenty-first \r\ncentury. This calls for synergies across all United \r\nNations bodies, programmes, funds and specialized \r\nagencies. But, more importantly, since Member States \r\ndetermine their activities and their direction, we need \r\nto build synergies among us. The people of our \r\ncountries are looking to see positive results. \r\n I am confident that, under the Assembly \r\nPresident’s leadership, the United Nations will make \r\ngreat strides in advancing its cause. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Slovak \r\nRepublic for the statement he has just made. \r\n  Mr. Ivan Gašparovič, President of the Slovak \r\nRepublic, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\n \r\nAddress by His Majesty King Abdullah II Bin \r\nAl Hussein, Head of State of the Hashemite Kingdom \r\nof Jordan \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will hear \r\nan address by the Head of State of the Hashemite \r\nKingdom of Jordan. \r\n A/65/PV.12\r\n \r\n15 10-54833 \r\n \r\n  His Majesty King Abdullah II Bin Al Hussein, \r\nHead of State of the Hashemite Kingdom of \r\nJordan, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Majesty King Abdullah II Bin Al Hussein, \r\nHead of State of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n King Abdullah: More than ever before, our \r\nworld is confronting multiple global crises which \r\ncannot be effectively addressed without a coordinated, \r\nmultilateral action. No country can face these crises \r\nand provide for its future in isolation. The threats are \r\nglobal, and so are the solutions. A strong, central role \r\nfor the United Nations is essential. \r\n It is also essential to resist forces of division that \r\nspread misunderstanding and mistrust, especially \r\namong peoples of different religions. The fact is that \r\nhumanity everywhere is bound together, not only by \r\nmutual interests, but by shared commandments: to love \r\nGod and neighbour; to love the good and neighbour. \r\n This week, my delegation, with the support of our \r\nfriends on every continent, will introduce a draft \r\nresolution for an annual World Interfaith Harmony \r\nWeek. What we propose is a special week during which \r\nthe world’s people, in their own places of worship, \r\ncould express the teachings of their own faith about \r\ntolerance, respect for the other, and peace. I hope that \r\nthe draft resolution will have the Assembly’s support. \r\n Another critical area for United Nations \r\nleadership is peace — and one peace hangs in the \r\nbalance today. With direct negotiations between the \r\nPalestinians and the Israelis, a door opens to a final, \r\ntwo-State settlement of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. \r\nAnd the establishment of an independent, viable and \r\nsovereign Palestinian State, living side by side with \r\nIsrael, will pave the way for a comprehensive regional \r\npeace. An end to this conflict is long overdue. \r\n No regional crisis has had a longer or broader \r\nimpact on global security and stability. No such crisis \r\nhas been longer on the United Nations agenda, or has \r\nfrustrated peacemakers more. Every resource spent in \r\nthis conflict is a resource lost for investing in progress \r\nand prosperity. Every day spent is a day lost to forces \r\nof violence and extremism that threaten all of us in the \r\nregion and beyond. \r\n People are wary of disappointment, and spoilers \r\nare doing everything they can to make us fail. We \r\ncannot underestimate the importance of success, or the \r\npainful cost of failure. All of us need to support swift \r\naction, hard choices and real results. The alternative is \r\nmore suffering and deeper frustrations, with spreading, \r\nmore-vicious warfare. Such a catastrophic scenario will \r\ncontinue to drag in the whole world, threatening \r\nsecurity and stability far beyond the borders of the \r\nMiddle East. To prevent that, the talks must be \r\napproached with commitment, sincerity and courage. \r\n There should be no provocative or unilateral \r\nactions that can derail the negotiations. Instead, the \r\nparties must work hard to produce results, and quickly. \r\nThat means addressing all final-status issues, with a \r\nview to ending the occupation and reaching the two-\r\nState solution, the only solution that can work, as soon \r\nas possible. The status quo is simply unacceptable — \r\nenough injustice, enough bloodshed. \r\n Jordan and the rest of the Arab and Muslim world \r\nare committed. In the Arab Peace Initiative, we reach \r\nout to Israel with an unprecedented opportunity for a \r\ncomprehensive settlement, a settlement that will enable \r\nIsrael to have normal relations with 57 Arab and \r\nMuslim States, one third of the United Nations. Now \r\nwe reach out to our fellow members of this United \r\nNations. All stand to lose if the talks fail; all gain when \r\npeace is achieved. Our global and collective influence \r\nis key. Together we must tip the balance towards peace. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Head of State of the \r\nHashemite Kingdom of Jordan for the statement he has \r\njust made. \r\n  His Majesty King Abdullah II Bin Al Hussein, \r\nHead of State of the Hashemite Kingdom of \r\nJordan, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Joseph Kabila Kabange, President of \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will hear \r\nan address by the President of the Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo. \r\n  Mr. Joseph Kabila Kabange, President of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, was escorted \r\ninto the General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nA/65/PV.12  \r\n \r\n10-54833 16 \r\n \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Joseph Kabila Kabange, \r\nPresident of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Kabila Kabange (spoke in French): I \r\nbegin by congratulating Mr. Joseph Deiss on his \r\nelection to preside over the sixty-fifth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, and I also congratulate his entire \r\nBureau on their election. I also congratulate the \r\nPresident’s predecessor, Mr. Ali Treki, on the devotion \r\nand skill with which he carried out his mandate, to \r\ngreat general satisfaction. \r\n Finally, I pay a heartfelt tribute to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his praiseworthy, tireless \r\nefforts to uphold and promote the purposes and principles \r\nof the Charter. The Democratic Republic of the Congo \r\nthanks him for having agreed to be present in Kinshasa \r\nduring the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of our \r\naccession to independence. This is proof of his \r\ncommitment and that of the United Nations, together with \r\nthe Congolese people, in the search for peace, stability \r\nand development. My country reaffirms its determination \r\nto support him in his efforts to bring about a world that is \r\nsafer for all of us. \r\n The President took the Chair. \r\n This session is being held at a time of particular \r\ndifficulty for all humanity, which is in crisis, marked \r\nby challenges to the basic principles of international \r\nrelations, worsened by the self-interest of nations. The \r\noutcome document adopted yesterday on accelerating \r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals, \r\nwhile being a message of hope, nevertheless gives a \r\nsense of the gap separating the wealthy countries from \r\nthe poor countries as we seek better living conditions \r\nfor our peoples. \r\n The food crisis and famine afflict many peoples \r\nof the planet. Endemic diseases that had almost \r\ndisappeared are now resurfacing, and new scourges are \r\nappearing. In particular, we see a plethora of natural \r\ndisasters in the wake of climate change, which is \r\nproving to be even more devastating. \r\n The grim picture that I have just painted should \r\nmotivate us to be more united in mobilizing our efforts \r\nin a spirit of constructive solidarity in order to find \r\nagreed, comprehensive solutions measuring up to the \r\nvast challenges that we must meet. \r\n The Democratic Republic of the Congo makes a \r\npressing appeal to all States to work together at long \r\nlast for a better world, while tirelessly trying to bring \r\npeace wherever areas of tension persist. \r\n The Democratic Republic of the Congo also \r\ncommends all the efforts made by a number of States \r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations to restore \r\npeace, security, democracy and development to certain \r\nregions of the Middle East, the Balkans, the Horn of \r\nAfrica, Central Africa and other regions of the world. \r\n My country is emerging from a multifaceted \r\ncrisis worsened by the various wars that ravaged it \r\nuntil recently. Like many other African nations, it also \r\nsuffers from the harmful consequences of the global \r\neconomic and financial crisis. As I told my people on \r\n30 June, on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of \r\nour independence, poverty and a precarious situation \r\nare neither inevitable nor irreversible. \r\n The Democratic Republic of the Congo wants the \r\nnext 50 years to be much brighter and more promising. \r\nIt undertakes, to that end, to make its contribution to \r\nthe forward march of humankind towards a better \r\nworld. \r\n With respect to the global challenges of \r\npreserving the planet, my country, wondrously \r\nendowed and blessed by nature, reaffirms its solemn \r\ncommitment to defend its biodiversity in its policies \r\nand its national development plan. \r\n The Government of my country, whose forests \r\nprovide the world with its second set of “lungs”, \r\nbelieves that the issue of climate change and the \r\nenvironment will require the establishment of a global \r\nenvironment authority, which should involve both \r\npublic and private institutions, civil society and \r\nscientific circles. \r\n With respect to establishing and consolidating \r\npeace, my country welcomes the Secretary-General’s \r\nacceptance of our request to establish in Libreville in \r\nthe Republic of Gabon a United Nations office for \r\nCentral Africa, which clearly will help bring the United \r\nNations closer and ensure better coordination between \r\nit and the countries of the region. Issues of peace, \r\nsecurity, humanitarian assistance and development will \r\nbe considered speedily, and implementation of \r\nmeasures adopted will receive the necessary urgency. \r\n It is up to us to consolidate peace everywhere, \r\nthrough international and regional mechanisms and \r\n A/65/PV.12\r\n \r\n17 10-54833 \r\n \r\ninstruments for the maintenance of peace and the \r\nprevention and settlement of conflict. \r\n The Democratic Republic of the Congo is \r\nresolved to eradicate the phenomenon of foreign armed \r\ngroups in its national territory. This is the framework in \r\nwhich should be understood the military operations \r\nthat we have carried out systematically since 2009 to \r\nforce such groups to lay down their arms for good. Due \r\nto military pressures and awareness-raising and \r\noutreach campaigns, and also because the were \r\ndisplace far from their own borders of origin, the \r\nvolunteer repatriations have intensified and will \r\ncontinue to do so. \r\n The question of the Lord’s Resistance Army is no \r\nlonger a matter of defence; rather, it is now a matter of \r\npublic order. Nevertheless, given the crimes and \r\natrocities that it still commits against our civilian \r\npopulations, we shall remain mobilized and vigilant. \r\nThe ultimate aim is to put that group in a situation in \r\nwhich it can no longer do any harm. \r\n Together with our efforts to eradicate the \r\ninsecurity in the eastern part of our national territory, \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo is working to \r\nstrengthen the rule of law, democracy and good \r\ngovernance. \r\n With respect to justice in particular, I should like \r\nto dwell a little on the ordeal of Congolese women in \r\nthe Provinces of North and South Kivu. The lack of \r\nsecurity is the primary cause of the tragedy. Armed \r\ngroups, which benefit from the illegal exploitation of \r\nraw materials, are at the very root of the scourge. We \r\nhave decided upon appropriate measures to address this \r\nunacceptable situation. \r\n The Democratic Republic of the Congo is now \r\naddressing the causes of the violence against women \r\nand the causes of recurrent conflict. At the same time, \r\nit is enhancing its judiciary in order to address together \r\npeace, justice and security. The fight against impunity \r\ncontinues to be of prime importance in Government \r\nactions. \r\n My Government is working within the framework \r\nof achieving the Millennium Development Goals to do \r\nits utmost to meet the basic needs of our people: \r\nhealth, education, food self-sufficiency, basic \r\ninfrastructures, electricity and drinking water for all, \r\nnot to mention fighting malaria, HIV/AIDS and \r\npoverty. I appreciate the commitment of our partners \r\nwho are supporting us in achieving my country’s \r\ndevelopment priorities. \r\n Because of the complex nature of the various \r\ntasks that need to be carried out on our territory of \r\nmore than several million square kilometres, the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo is a vast building \r\nsite, requiring multiple contributions for reconstruction \r\nand modernization. Such contributions are welcome, \r\nparticularly in the framework of a partnership that we \r\nwant to be respectful and proactive with the private \r\nsector. \r\n Today the economic indicators are changing in a \r\npositive manner. Several key actions have been \r\nsuccessfully taken. The credit for this success, which \r\ngives us the means for a new start, lies above all with \r\nthe Congolese people. It also stems from the valuable \r\ncontributions and cooperation of our partners. \r\n With regard to political and administrative \r\nmanagement, we plan to hold presidential and \r\nlegislative elections in 2011. My Government is \r\nmaking it a point of honour to consolidate democracy \r\nby respecting electoral time frames, ensuring \r\naccountability of the highest order and completing the \r\nestablishment of the institutions provided for by the \r\nConstitution within the framework of the \r\ndecentralization process. \r\n My country supports the process of reforming our \r\nuniversal Organization. The Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo reaffirms that the Member States should \r\nwork resolutely within that trend. United Nations \r\nreform, including Security Council reform, should \r\ntherefore be undertaken without delay, because that \r\nwould support the achievement of our dreams, given \r\nthe new challenges and changes that affect our planet. \r\n Expansion of the Security Council is a democratic \r\nrequirement. This vision needs to be strengthened by \r\naffirming the authority of the General Assembly, in order \r\nto enable its President to play a key role in the quest for \r\nsolutions to the problems of our time. \r\n It is said that nature will give man only those \r\nchallenges that are within the reach of his creative \r\npotential, which has produced tremendous inventions. \r\nDespite our diversity, the time has now come to put our \r\nhuman resources at the service of our collective \r\ncreativity. \r\n We should not leave the controls of the global \r\neconomy to unbridled capitalism, which recognizes no \r\nA/65/PV.12  \r\n \r\n10-54833 18 \r\n \r\nregulation of movements of capital, and is motivated \r\nonly by the profit motive. It is our duty also to \r\nglobalize the universal values of justice, solidarity and \r\naltruism that contribute to international peace and \r\nsecurity. \r\n Together we can give humanity better times, if \r\nday after day we work to achieve the ideals of our \r\nOrganization. \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n  Mr. Joseph Kabila Kabange, President of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, was escorted \r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Ilham Heydar oglu Aliyev, President \r\nof the Republic of Azerbaijan \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nRepublic of Azerbaijan. \r\n  Mr. Ilham Heydar oglu Aliyev, President of the \r\nRepublic of Azerbaijan, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Ilham Heydar \r\noglu Aliyev, President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Aliyev: I have the honour to join \r\nprevious speakers in congratulating you, Sir, on your \r\nelection to the post of President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-fifth session; I wish you every \r\nsuccess in that highly responsible post. I would like as \r\nwell to thank your predecessor, Mr. Ali Abdussalam \r\nTreki, for his productive work. I also express my \r\nprofound respect and gratitude to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his \r\nleadership and dedication in reviving the Organization. \r\n Azerbaijan recognizes the central role of the \r\nUnited Nations in maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity, promoting sustainable development and \r\nadvocating fundamental freedoms for the people of the \r\nworld. Azerbaijan believes that the United Nations has \r\nto be stronger and more capable in engaging in a range \r\nof global issues in every part of the world, as well as in \r\naddressing the aspirations and concerns of each \r\nMember State. \r\n As a country suffering from the devastation of \r\nwar and occupation, Azerbaijan strongly believes that \r\nfaithful observance of universally accepted norms and \r\nprinciples of international law concerning good-\r\nneighbourliness, friendly relations, cooperation among \r\nStates and the fulfilment in good faith of the \r\nobligations assumed by States are of the greatest \r\nimportance for the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security. The ongoing armed conflict between \r\nArmenia and Azerbaijan still represents a major threat \r\nto international and regional peace and security. The \r\nconflict has resulted in the occupation of one fifth of \r\nthe territory of Azerbaijan and has made approximately \r\none out of every nine people in my country an \r\ninternally displaced person or a refugee. \r\n It has been internationally recognized that the \r\nRepublic of Armenia bears the primary responsibility \r\nfor occupying Azerbaijan’s territories, committing the \r\nmost serious international crimes during the conflict, \r\ncarrying out ethnic cleansing and trying to create a \r\nmono-ethnic culture in the captured Azerbaijani \r\nterritories. The Security Council has adopted four \r\nresolutions and has expressed its full support for the \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and \r\nthe inadmissibility of the use of force for the \r\nacquisition of territories. It has also recognized that \r\nNagorny Karabakh is part of Azerbaijan and has called \r\nfor the immediate, full and unconditional withdrawal \r\nof the occupying forces from all occupied territories of \r\nAzerbaijan. The General Assembly and other \r\ninternational organizations, including the Organization \r\nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the \r\nCouncil of Europe, the European Parliament and the \r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, have adopted \r\nsimilar positions. Unfortunately, despite the \r\nconsolidated position of the international community, \r\nAzerbaijani territories continue to remain under \r\noccupation. \r\n Armenia so far, instead of negotiating in good \r\nfaith with a view to finding a durable solution to the \r\nconflict as soon as possible, has preferred escalation, \r\nwith unpredictable consequences. Despite ongoing \r\npolitical efforts towards the earliest possible resolution \r\nof the conflict, activities in the occupied areas of \r\nAzerbaijan are in gross violation of international law \r\nand serve to further consolidate the current status quo \r\nof the occupation, securing the results of ethnic \r\n A/65/PV.12\r\n \r\n19 10-54833 \r\n \r\ncleansing and colonization of the captured territories, \r\nand causing serious obstruction to the peaceful \r\nresolution of the conflict. \r\n Thus, over the period since the beginning of the \r\nconflict, significant numbers of settlers have been \r\nencouraged to move into the occupied areas \r\ndepopulated of their Azerbaijani inhabitants. In 2005 \r\nOSCE dispatched a fact-finding mission to the \r\noccupied territories of Azerbaijan, which found \r\nevidence of the presence of settlers there and made a \r\ncall to discourage any further settlement of the \r\noccupied territory of Azerbaijan. Measures are also \r\nbeing consistently undertaken by Armenia with the \r\npurpose of altering the historical and cultural features \r\nof the occupied areas in an attempt to remove any signs \r\ntestifying to their original Azerbaijani cultural and \r\nhistorical roots. As a result, not a single Azerbaijani \r\nhistoric or cultural monument has been left undamaged \r\nand no sacred site has escaped vandalism in the \r\noccupied territories. Implantation of settlers as well as \r\ndestruction and appropriation of the historical and \r\ncultural heritage in the occupied areas, along with \r\nvarious other forms of illegal activity there, directly \r\naffect the property rights of internally displaced \r\npersons. \r\n The lack of agreement on political issues, the \r\nprotracted nature of the conflict and prolonged \r\nnegotiations should not be used as pretexts for not \r\naddressing other problems deriving from continued and \r\ndeliberate disrespect for international humanitarian law \r\nand international human rights law in connection with \r\nthe conflict. \r\n The earliest possible resolution of the armed \r\nconflict in and around the Nagorny Karabakh region of \r\nAzerbaijan remains a primary task for us. The OSCE \r\nMinsk Group Co-Chair countries are engaged in efforts \r\nto bring peace and stability to the region. Resolution of \r\nthe conflict envisages the withdrawal of Armenian \r\nforces from the occupied Azerbaijani territories within \r\na fixed time framework, restoration of all \r\ncommunications, return of all refugees and internally \r\ndisplaced persons to their places of origin, international \r\nsecurity guarantees, including peacekeeping forces, and \r\ninterim status for Nagorny Karabakh. We are ready to \r\ncontinue the talks in good faith for finalizing the status \r\nof Nagorny Karabakh within the Republic of \r\nAzerbaijan. \r\n The step-by-step approach introduced to Armenia \r\nand Azerbaijan in December 2009 by the OSCE Minsk \r\nGroup Co-Chairs is accepted by Azerbaijan in principle \r\nas a basis for achieving a lasting resolution of the \r\nArmenia-Azerbaijan Nagorny Karabakh conflict. \r\nUnfortunately, Armenia is still delaying a definite \r\nanswer to the Co-Chairs’ proposal. \r\n Azerbaijan highly appreciates the principled \r\nstand of Member States on issues of vital importance \r\nfor Azerbaijan pertaining to its sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity. We rely on the continued solidarity \r\nof the international community with the just position of \r\nAzerbaijan and on valuable support for our initiatives \r\nwithin the United Nations, aimed at addressing the \r\nexisting challenges in an impartial, open and \r\ncomprehensive manner. \r\n Despite the unresolved conflict over Nagorny \r\nKarabakh and occupied territories, the Government of \r\nAzerbaijan has succeeded in guaranteeing political \r\nstability, democratic development, economic prosperity \r\nand social welfare in the country. Today, Azerbaijan is \r\none of the most rapidly developing economies in the \r\nworld. Within the last five years alone, Azerbaijan has \r\nnearly tripled its gross domestic product. The strategic \r\ngeographic location of Azerbaijan at the intersection of \r\nmajor trade routes along the emerging East-West and \r\nNorth-South transport and energy corridors provides an \r\nimportant asset to turn the country into an energy and \r\ninfrastructure hub. \r\n Azerbaijan possesses considerable proven oil and \r\nnatural gas reserves and has good prospects for new \r\ndiscoveries. Modern infrastructure for transporting \r\nhydrocarbons to international markets has already been \r\ncreated in Azerbaijan and has been used for exporting \r\noil and natural gas, which can diversify supply sources \r\nand strengthen international energy security. This is \r\nparticularly crucial for gas supplies. With proven \r\nreserves of 2 trillion cubic metres of natural gas and a \r\npotential of up to 5 trillion cubic metres or, and \r\nperhaps even more, Azerbaijan is ready to provide its \r\nown contribution to ensure the stable development of \r\nthe world natural gas market. \r\n Another globally important project, on which \r\nAzerbaijan is working very intensively with its \r\nneighbours is building and enhancing the regional \r\nrailroad infrastructure. This railroad connection will \r\nopen an enormous opportunity for transporting all \r\nkinds of cargo between Asia and Europe. \r\nA/65/PV.12  \r\n \r\n10-54833 20 \r\n \r\n As a very active member of the Extractive \r\nIndustries Transparency Initiative, Azerbaijan, in an \r\nopen and transparent manner, uses its energy revenues \r\nfor the development of the country, particularly in \r\nbuilding human capital and working to eradicate \r\nreducing poverty. Thus, we were able to achieve a \r\ndramatic poverty reduction, from 49 per cent in 2003 \r\nto 11 per cent in 2009. And I strongly believe that \r\nthrough sustainable development Azerbaijan will attain \r\neven more in this field in upcoming years. \r\n Azerbaijan has always been a place of \r\ncoexistence and tolerance among different faiths, \r\nethnic groups and philosophies. As an active member \r\nof the Group of Friends of the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations, Azerbaijan contributes to the promotion \r\nof inter-religious and intercultural dialogue based on \r\nmutual respect and understanding. Azerbaijan hosted \r\nthe World Summit of Religious Leaders, with \r\nparticipants from 32 States, in the spring of this year \r\nand has put forward an initiative to host a world forum \r\nfor intercultural dialogue in April 2011. \r\n One of the most serious and long-term challenges \r\nthat can affect every part of the globe is climate \r\nchange. We in Azerbaijan proclaimed 2010 a year of \r\necology and adopted various special programmes in the \r\nfield of environmental protection. \r\n Azerbaijan demonstrates full support and \r\nundertakes ceaseless efforts for the promotion of \r\nsustainable development and global prosperity for all, \r\npaying particular attention to addressing the special \r\nneeds and vulnerabilities of the developing and least \r\ndeveloped countries, as well as of those who are \r\nrecovering from natural disasters. Azerbaijan will \r\ncontinue to contribute to the realization of the \r\nMillennium development goals and objectives agreed \r\nwithin the United Nations. \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly I would like to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Azerbaijan for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n  Mr. Ilham Heydar oglu Aliyev, President of the \r\nRepublic of Azerbaijan, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\n  \r\nAddress by Mr. Ricardo Martinelli Berrocal, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Panama \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nRepublic of Panama. \r\n  Mr. Ricardo Martinelli Berrocal, President of the \r\nRepublic of Panama, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Ricardo \r\nMartinelli Berrocal, President of the Republic of \r\nPanama, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Martinelli Berrocal (spoke in \r\nSpanish): I congratulate you, Sir, on your election to \r\npreside over the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth \r\nsession. We fully endorse your proposal to analyse the \r\ncentral role of the United Nations in global \r\ngovernance. The United Nations is the international \r\nforum in which to exchange ideas and adopt measures \r\nthat strengthen the pillars upon which our governance \r\nstands. \r\n Panama’s geography has allowed my country to \r\nserve as a bridge between and meeting point of the \r\nmost diverse cultures and civilizations. Thanks to the \r\ndiscovery of our special privileged position in 1513 \r\nand the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914, today \r\nwe connect Europe, the Americas and the East. That is \r\nhow our story has been written. Five hundred years \r\nlater, we are still working for the benefit of the world’s \r\nmaritime commerce. \r\n Our ethnic diversity is a symbol and example of \r\nour national unity. Panama is committed to promoting \r\neconomic growth and social justice. We make possible \r\nthe peaceful coexistence of all ethnicities and creeds. \r\nWe Panamanians love peace, and we manage our canal \r\nwith scrupulous careful neutrality. Our foreign policy \r\nis defined by respect, the defence and promotion of \r\ndemocracy, human rights, and international peace and \r\ninternational security, all within the framework of the \r\ndoctrine of human security. \r\n Panama has played an active role in favour of the \r\ninternational community at important United Nations \r\nforums. Among these are the Security Council, the \r\nCommission on Human Rights, the Human Rights \r\nCommittee, and the Committee on the Elimination of \r\nDiscrimination against Women. Our pacifism does not \r\n A/65/PV.12\r\n \r\n21 10-54833 \r\n \r\nimply passivity in the face of situations that affect \r\ninternational security and the governance of peoples. \r\nChange is in the air all over the globe. People demand \r\neven more of their public servants. Our political and \r\ndiplomatic activities are founded on the principles of \r\ninternational cooperation and the strengthening of \r\nglobal multilateralism. \r\n Trafficking in drugs, weapons, human organs and \r\npersons — associated with illegal migration — as well \r\nas money-laundering, banditryism and terrorism are the \r\nwork of criminal organizations that seek to destabilize \r\nour democracies. The trafficking and illegal possession \r\nof weapons have a devastating effect on human \r\nsecurity and governance in our countries. \r\n For Panama and the Central American region, \r\ndrugs are our weapons of mass destruction and are a \r\nvital issue. Drug traffickers filter through our land and \r\nsea borders, polluting our young people with their \r\npoison. Additionally, our region is being used by \r\nnetworks of human traffickers that steer mixed \r\nmigratory flows of persons from other continents \r\nthrough our borders. \r\n In the face of these challenges, my country and \r\nthe other members of the Central American Integration \r\nSystem have decided to create a regional security \r\ncoordination centre. These regional efforts to fight \r\ntransnational organized crime, based in my country, are \r\nalready yielding encouraging results. \r\n We understand that it is vital to work jointly to \r\nimprove the functioning of international institutions, \r\nfor the benefit of humanity. In this regard, I find it a \r\nvery positive sign for the region that President Porfirio \r\nLobo of Honduras is participating fully in this \r\nAssembly. In order to count on a world that is more \r\nstable and secure, we must set aside our differences. \r\nStability requires us to work together to strengthen \r\nhuman security, both regionally and globally. \r\n Globalization has entered a period of \r\nconvergence among the diverse various economies; this  \r\nwill continue for some years. While the previous stage \r\nof globalization lasted some 60 years, we believe that \r\nthe one that began in 1990 will conclude its \r\nreadjustments by mid-century. It is also necessary to \r\nnote that as a result of this process of convergence, we \r\nhave suffered during the past two years the effects of a \r\nsignificant crisis. \r\n This global crisis demands newer and better \r\nforms of government for our societies. This global \r\ncrisis demands the expansion of our markets and better \r\nmanagement of our intergovernmental relations. In this \r\ncontext, we appreciate the efforts towards developing \r\nthe exchange of goods, workers, tourists and \r\ninvestments across the China Straits, which offer a new \r\nthrust to achieving the full potential of our trade \r\nrelations with that region. \r\n For its part, Panama is also expanding its trade \r\nrelations through the negotiation of free trade \r\nagreements with Peru and Colombia. We are also \r\nactively pursuing free trade agreements negotiated with \r\nCanada, and the United States of America and an \r\nassociation agreement between Central America and \r\nthe European Union. Accordingly, I wish to take this \r\nopportunity to ask for the support of all Governments \r\ninvolved, with a view toward their approval and \r\nratification of all these treaties. \r\n We are on the threshold of an era of economic \r\ngrowth and opportunity in Latin America. Thus, we \r\nrenew our commitment to a more just and inclusive \r\nfree trade that offers economic opportunities and \r\nprosperity to all our peoples. With change and reform \r\nsweeping the region, we have more than enough \r\nreasons to promote a new age of cooperation and \r\nworking together. Together, we can seize this \r\nopportunity and successfully face our common \r\nchallenges. \r\n Panama enjoys very healthy and strong relations \r\nwith its main partner, the United States of America — a \r\npartner that is committed to our region’s success. Such \r\nan engaged partner is crucial for the region’s success. \r\nOn both trade and security issues, the United States is \r\nand always has been an ally and a willing friend. \r\n Additionally, we understand that for the \r\ncomprehensive development of trade relations and the \r\nstrengthening of our economies, more measures are \r\nrequired to ensure effective tax collection. To this end, \r\nPanama has signed agreements to avoid double \r\ntaxation and prevent tax evasion. This is part of a \r\nnational strategy that seeks to strengthen transparency \r\nand the competitiveness of our country’s international \r\nservices. We have already signed agreements with \r\nMexico, Barbados and Portugal, and a while ago with \r\nthe State of Qatar. We have also concluded negotiations \r\nwith Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, France, \r\nLuxembourg, the Republic of Korea and Singapore. \r\nA/65/PV.12  \r\n \r\n10-54833 22 \r\n \r\n We want to offer the Panamanian experience as \r\nan example to the world. It is an economic story of \r\nreform at home along with strong international trade \r\nand business relations across the region; these have had \r\nexcellent results and have proved fruitful. \r\n The Government of Panama welcomes the \r\nadoption of resolution 65/1, entitled “Keeping the \r\npromise: — united to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals”, and, at the same time, we \r\nreaffirm our commitment to that document. \r\n In a little less than a year in Government, we \r\nhave developed structural reforms and programmes to \r\nmeet the needs of our people, focusing particularly on \r\nsociety’s most vulnerable groups. Among these \r\nprogrammes, allow me to highlight one that consists of \r\ngrants to elderly people who lack retirement funds or \r\npensions. Additionally, we have established a system of \r\nuniversal scholarships to support our young people \r\nwith a monthly stipend from the first to the twelfth \r\ngrades. Whether the student attends a public school or \r\na private school with modest tuition fees, the State is \r\nreducing the dropout rate and strengthening \r\nrelationships among teachers, parents and students. \r\n Moreover, in December 2009, we decreed the \r\nhighest largest minimum wage increase in the past \r\n50 years. We are thus helping workers in the private \r\nand public sectors who were earning very low wages. \r\nAdditionally, we established a solidarity fund to assist \r\nPanamanians of limited means in buying their first \r\nhome. \r\n Panama will invest more than $13 billion in \r\npublic infrastructure over the next five years. This \r\neffort will include the building of hospitals, the \r\ndevelopment of roads, the expansion of Tocumen \r\nInternational Airport, the building of other airports, and \r\nthe establishment of the MetroBus, as well as the \r\nconstruction of a modern subway system in Panama \r\nCity. That first subway line will raise the quality of life \r\nfor Panamanian families, who will thus have more time \r\nto share and strengthen family values. \r\n These projects, together with the expansion of the \r\nCanal and the responsible and sustainable exploitation \r\nof our natural resources, will cost more than $20 \r\nbillion in the coming years and will generate thousands \r\nof jobs that the country so sorely needs. All of these \r\npublic works projects will be developed with the \r\nhighest environmental standards and will contribute to \r\na more dynamic economy for Panama and the region as \r\na whole. \r\n The theme chosen for this debate could not be \r\nmore appropriate; we concur that the United Nations \r\nhas a calling to play a central role in global \r\ngovernance. To that end, we need to deepen the process \r\nof reforms begun within the Organization. Panama is \r\ncommitted to making its contribution to this process, \r\nplacing its geographical position and its logistics \r\ninfrastructure at the service of the Organization. \r\n In this regard, my Government has two key \r\nprojects, namely, the establishment of a United Nations \r\ninter-agency centre for Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean and the creation of a regional logistics \r\ncentre for humanitarian assistance, both to be located \r\nin Panama. The first will promote more coherence and \r\nsynergy between all regional offices, with greater \r\nefficiency in the use of resources. The second will \r\nimprove the regional capacity to respond to natural \r\ndisasters and humanitarian crises, and will be the site \r\nof warehouses for the United Nations, and the Red \r\nCross and Red Crescent. \r\n We reaffirm our conviction that the United \r\nNations is the international forum for the exchange of \r\nideas and for adopting measures that strengthen the \r\npillars upon which world governance rests. The United \r\nNations is also a forum of goodwill where nations can \r\nwork together on shared goals. In our region that \r\nmeans jobs, opportunity and security for our peoples. It \r\nalso means modernizing economies, reforming the \r\nGovernment, and ensuring social well-being. \r\n Panama is a good example of this success. Today, \r\nmy country reaffirms its belief in and solidarity with \r\nthe United Nations system. I say this unambiguously \r\nand with great certainty. We are fully prepared and \r\nwilling to offer all the peoples of the planet the best \r\npossible service and utility and, as a product of that, to \r\ndevelop our citizens. That is Panama’s mission, and we \r\nwill accomplish it. \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Republic of Panama for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n  Mr. Ricardo Martinelli Berrocal, President of the \r\nRepublic of Panama, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\n A/65/PV.12\r\n \r\n23 10-54833 \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Paul Biya, President of the Republic \r\nof Cameroon \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by His Excellency Mr. Paul \r\nBiya, President of the Republic of Cameroon. \r\n  Mr. Paul Biya, President of the Republic of \r\nCameroon, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Paul Biya, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Cameroon, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly. \r\n President Biya (spoke in French): I would like \r\nfirst to extend my hearty congratulations to you, Sir, on \r\nyour unanimous election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-fifth session. With your rich \r\nexperience in international affairs, we believe you will \r\nsucceed in your task. I would also like to pay tribute to \r\nyour predecessor, Mr. Ali Abdussalem Treki, for his \r\ncommitment and skill in discharging his challenging \r\nfunctions during the previous session, and I convey to \r\nhim my special thanks. \r\n I also wish to thank Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon and his aides for their untiring efforts in the \r\nservice of peace and development throughout the \r\nworld, particularly in the least developed countries. \r\n As the first decade of the twenty-first century \r\ndraws to a close, it is certainly worthwhile to review \r\nthe ground covered since we proclaimed, some \r\n10 years ago in this very Hall, our common resolve to \r\ncut poverty in half by 2015, worldwide. We all recall \r\nthe enthusiasm engendered by that solemn \r\ncommitment. \r\n Today, we are forced to note that we are still \r\nquite far off the track. More than one billion people are \r\nstill living in extreme poverty. The development gap \r\nbetween the countries of the North and those of the \r\nSouth continues to widen instead of narrowing. \r\nInternational assistance is stagnating and remains \r\nbelow the level of commitment made by developed \r\ncountries to devote 0.7 per cent of their gross national \r\nproduct to it. The results in the eight priority areas of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals are disappointing, \r\neven unsatisfactory, while the deadline of 2015 is just \r\naround the corner. \r\n So what happened? The economic crisis caused \r\nby the recent upheavals in financial markets is \r\ncertainly to blame. The slowdown in activity \r\nworldwide — and, in some cases, recession — \r\nmonopolized the attention of the countries of the \r\nNorth. They gave priority to reviving their own \r\neconomies and solving their own social problems. \r\nHowever, even though we can understand that, it does \r\nnot explain everything. \r\n In fact, the awareness shown at the turn of the \r\ncentury of the disastrous consequences of deepening \r\npoverty in the third world seems to have waned \r\nsignificantly. Yet the situation has not only failed to \r\nimprove, it continues to deteriorate. On several \r\noccasions, from this rostrum and elsewhere, I have \r\ndrawn the attention of the international community to \r\nthe problem posed by the growth in poverty worldwide. \r\nI have pointed out that, for ethical reasons, it behooves \r\nus all to express solidarity with the most \r\nunderprivileged. I have further indicated that this is, of \r\ncourse, in everyone’s interests, for the ever-widening \r\ngap between the rich and the poor can only exacerbate \r\ntensions and jeopardize international peace and \r\nsecurity. \r\n I will be pardoned, I am sure, if I dwell a little on \r\nthe case of Africa. It is undeniably the continent most \r\naffected by extreme poverty, which is generally \r\naccompanied by food shortages, epidemics, population \r\nmovements and insecurity. Is it any wonder, then, that \r\nsuch profound misery sometimes explodes, as was the \r\ncase two years ago during what were dubbed the food \r\nriots? The international community cannot remain \r\nindifferent to such a threat, which could undermine our \r\nefforts to advance democracy and ensure our \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Let me make myself clear. It is not a matter of \r\nengaging in recriminations for the sake of any \r\nideology, of ascribing motives to this or that country or \r\ngroup of countries, or of sermonizing. I am the first to \r\nacknowledge that the United Nations and its agencies \r\nhave provided assistance and guidance to our continent \r\nsince independence; that most countries of the North \r\nhave, through their cooperation, financial assistance \r\nand debt cancellation, lent and continue to lend \r\nirreplaceable support to Africa; and that emerging \r\ncountries have taken over. We are, of course, grateful \r\nto all of them. \r\nA/65/PV.12  \r\n \r\n10-54833 24 \r\n \r\n However, that obviously is not enough. I am not \r\ntrying to apportion blame for this state of affairs. I \r\nmerely want to say that the solutions applied were \r\nperhaps not the best. I would add that from the African \r\nperspective, we have been burdened with too many \r\nhistorical handicaps — slavery, colonization, economic \r\ndependence and internal and external conflicts — and, \r\nof course, that we have lacked toughness and \r\nsteadiness of mind. \r\n For reasons of mutual interest mentioned earlier, I \r\nthink we should review the issue thoroughly, without \r\nulterior ideological motives or political or economic \r\nprejudices. No matter what is said, Africa has changed \r\nsignificantly over the past 50 years and seems to me to \r\nbe ready for a wide-ranging ideological debate on the \r\nissue, provided that it is conducted in a true spirit of \r\npartnership. Through this approach we can realize the \r\nfamous Marshall Plan for Africa, which is often \r\nmentioned but has yet to see the light of day. \r\n That concern led Cameroon to organize an \r\ninternational conference — Africa 21 — in Yaoundé on \r\nthe occasion of the celebration of the fiftieth \r\nanniversary of its achieving sovereignty. At that \r\nconference the 50 years of African independence were \r\nobjectively assessed and the future opportunities for \r\nour continent were evaluated. The conference was \r\nattended by several Heads of State and Government, \r\nformer Prime Ministers, high-level representatives of \r\ninternational organizations, experts of world renown, \r\nmajor corporate executives and Nobel Peace Prize \r\nwinners. \r\n The final declaration of the conference, which my \r\ndelegation has made available, can serve as a kind of \r\nguide for the rehabilitation of Africa, with regard to \r\nboth its economic recovery and its participation in \r\ninternational life. That is what it is all about — \r\nensuring that our continent does not remain forever \r\naid-dependent and that it plays its rightful role in \r\ninternational affairs. \r\n Allow me, in this Hall, to emphasize the second \r\npoint. How can we today explain why Africa is the \r\nonly continent without a permanent member on the \r\nSecurity Council? How can we explain that Africa is \r\nunable to make its voice heard when its problems are \r\nexamined in global economic and financial bodies \r\nwhile the decisions made there will be imposed on it? \r\nAt a time when emerging countries are rightly calling \r\nfor a seat on the Security Council commensurate with \r\ntheir economic and political weight, Africa as a whole \r\nshould not be forgotten. \r\n For a long time our continent has been treated, I \r\ndare say, as an object of international relations. Yet, it \r\nis directly affected by most of the major problems \r\nconfronting humanity today, be they migratory flows, \r\nglobal warming, economic and financial regulation, \r\nterrorism, et cetera. In short, it is sometimes the victim \r\nof phenomena for which it is not responsible. From \r\nthat standpoint also, there is a need to get out of the rut \r\nin which major negotiations appear to be bogged down. \r\n Africans seek more understanding and sympathy \r\nin the true sense of the words. The delayed \r\ndevelopment from which they suffer cannot be reduced \r\nto the Millennium Goals. Admittedly, they want to be \r\nless poor and to eat their fill, but above all, to be \r\nprotected from fear and want, to be freer and to \r\nimagine a future without anxiety. In short, they want to \r\nlive in a society that guarantees them those minimum \r\nconditions for existence and well-being. \r\n Most African countries have embarked on this \r\npath. For its part, over the last decades Cameroon has \r\nset up representative institutions, established the rule \r\nof law and ensured respect for human rights. On the \r\neconomic and social front, significant progress has \r\nbeen made in the areas of public finance, education and \r\nhealth. Should this trend continue, our country can \r\nexpect, in the medium term, to attain the status of an \r\nemerging country. \r\n That to me seems to be the mindset of most \r\nAfrican countries. Certainly, the international \r\ncommunity has a role to play in supporting them in \r\ntheir effort to join the global society. To that end, the \r\ninternational community needs to show more \r\nunderstanding, solidarity and, of course, more \r\nfraternity. \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Republic of Cameroon for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n  Mr. Paul Biya, President of the Republic of \r\nCameroon, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\n A/65/PV.12\r\n \r\n25 10-54833 \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Sebastian Piñera Echeñique, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Chile \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nRepublic of Chile. \r\n  Mr. Sebastian Piñera Echeñique, President of the \r\nRepublic of Chile, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Sebastian \r\nPiñera Echeñique, President of the Republic of Chile, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Piñera Echeñique (spoke in Spanish): \r\nI wish to begin by conveying our heartfelt \r\ncongratulations to you, Mr. President, on your election \r\nto guide the work of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nfifth session. Your human and professional qualities are \r\na guarantee of success in the Assembly’s important \r\ntasks. \r\n I come to this rostrum as the representative of \r\nChile, a country that is far away on the map but that is \r\ninhabited by a people that is close and that is in \r\nsolidarity and brotherhood; a country geographically \r\nnarrow but with a big and generous heart; a country \r\nphysically surrounded by an arid desert to the north, \r\nmajestic mountains to the east, a huge sea to the west \r\nand the magnificent Antarctica to the south. Despite \r\nthat, it is a people with a permanent and steadfast \r\ncommitment and calling to integration in the world. It \r\nis a country that like many others has experienced \r\ndivision and discord among its children but that is \r\ntoday fully united and reconciled; a country with a \r\nfearless and earthy character but possessing \r\nindomitable determination and valour; a country of \r\nwarriors and heroes but that has enjoyed uninterrupted \r\npeace for 130 years. It is a young country but with age-\r\nold institutions, and it views the present with \r\nconfidence and the future with optimism. \r\n Chile is a country that today is living through \r\ntimes that are historic and dramatic and offer enormous \r\nopportunities. I say historic times because only five \r\ndays ago we commemorated our two-hundredth \r\nanniversary of independence and opened the doors to \r\nour third century of republican life. We did so as one \r\nbig family saluting the same flag, honouring the same \r\nheroes and singing the same national anthem \r\nirrespective of our political ideas, religious beliefs, \r\nethnic origin or economic situation. \r\n But Chile is also living through dramatic times of \r\nadversity and sadness. A few months ago our country \r\nsuffered one of the five worst earthquakes in human \r\nhistory, followed by tidal waves on our coastlines. Five \r\nhundred and twenty-one of our fellow citizens lost \r\ntheir lives and many are still missing. More than \r\n2 million Chileans were affected. Entire cities and \r\nvillages were demolished. Hundreds of hospitals, \r\nclinics, bridges and ports are still unusable. One of \r\nevery three children — 1.25 million — were unable to \r\nreturn to school because the schools had been \r\ndestroyed or badly damaged. Total losses amounted to \r\nabout $30 billion, equivalent to about 18 per cent of \r\nour national product. Without doubt, it was the largest \r\ncatastrophe with the biggest damage ever suffered by \r\nour country in the history of its 200 years of \r\nindependence. \r\n But from those ruins rose a people united in \r\nsolidarity. After a mere 45 days all children and young \r\npeople had returned to school. In only 60 days we were \r\nable to restore proper health-care services in the \r\naffected areas. In only 90 days we had built more \r\nemergency housing than we had built throughout our \r\ncountry’s prior history. In 100 days we had entirely \r\nrestored connections, providing full or partial services \r\nto airports, ports, roads, bridges — everything the \r\nearthquake had destroyed. In 120 days our economy \r\nhad recovered the capacity to grow and create \r\nemployment with greater strength than ever. \r\n Certainly, reconstruction has only just begun and \r\nwill require years of effort. But to that end we will \r\ncontinue to work tirelessly until we have rebuilt the \r\nlast school, the last hospital or the last home that had \r\nbeen destroyed. Because for a country such as Chile, \r\nwhich has been shaped by adversity, determination and \r\nhard work, however difficult a crisis may be or how \r\npainful its consequences, it always represents an \r\nopportunity — the opportunity to build a better country \r\ntogether. \r\n In addition to being historic and dramatic, these \r\nare times of enormous opportunities. That is because \r\nthis generation of Chileans — the bicentennial \r\ngeneration — is in position to fulfil the dream our \r\nparents and grandparents had always cherished but \r\nnever achieved. That dream is to succeed in making \r\nChile, before the end of this decade, a country able to \r\nA/65/PV.12  \r\n \r\n10-54833 26 \r\n \r\ndefeat poverty, to defeat underdevelopment and to \r\ncreate opportunities for material and spiritual \r\ndevelopment for all of its children, which Chile has \r\nnever before known. \r\n How will we do this? First, by strengthening the \r\nthree basic pillars so that development germinates and \r\nopportunities flourish. At the political level that \r\nrequires a stable, participatory, transparent and vital \r\ndemocracy; at the economic level, a social market \r\neconomy open to the world and trusting unreservedly \r\nin the economic entrepreneurship and creativity of its \r\ncitizens; and at the social level, a State that is strong \r\nand effective in the fight against poverty and in \r\npromoting greater equality of opportunities. \r\n But we will build upon rock, and not upon sand. \r\nWhat was done before is insufficient. We must \r\nstrengthen the pillars of society, knowledge and \r\ninformation. I am thinking about the development of \r\nour human capital, which is the greatest wealth we \r\npossess. We must encourage innovation and \r\nentrepreneurship, which are the only truly renewable \r\nand inexhaustible natural resources that we have. We \r\nmust invest in science and technology, which will \r\ncreate unimaginable opportunities for the future we all \r\nface, and we must promote more dynamic and flexible \r\nmarkets and institutions in order to confront the \r\nchanges and opportunities that have become the \r\nchallenges of the modern world. \r\n For those reasons, almost 65 years ago, Chile, \r\ntogether with 50 other countries, attended the \r\nformation of this United Nations, whose goal was to \r\nmaintain peace, security and international cooperation. \r\nThat was the post-war period, when our planet was \r\ncrossed and divided by two walls. One was the iron \r\ncurtain running from north to south, dividing the world \r\nfor a long time into two irreconcilable blocs, each with \r\nsufficient war-making capacity to annihilate our planet \r\nseveral times over. But there was another wall, the one \r\nrunning from east to west, which separated the rich and \r\nprosperous countries of the North from the poor and \r\nunderdeveloped nations of the South. \r\n Both walls fell before our eyes as the sun set on \r\nthe twentieth century. The first wall was in Berlin, in \r\nCentral Europe, and the second one in Silicon Valley, \r\nBangalore, Singapore, New Zealand and in the main \r\ntechnological centres throughout the world. But the fall \r\nof these walls uncovered a third wall, less visible than \r\nthe previous ones but equally or more harmful and \r\ndamaging. That wall has existed in our countries and \r\npeoples forever, separating the older souls who live in \r\nnostalgia and fear the future from the young souls who \r\nare creative and entrepreneurial and embrace the future \r\nfearlessly and always believe that the best is still to \r\ncome. \r\n That wall prevented many of our nations from \r\njoining the Industrial Revolution in the nineteenth \r\ncentury. That explains why there are still \r\nunderdeveloped countries while others, fewer in \r\nnumber, managed to demolish that wall in time and to \r\njoin that revolution. \r\n But today we are confronted by a new revolution, \r\nmore powerful and more significant than the Industrial \r\nRevolution: the revolution of knowledge, technology \r\nand the information society. It has been knocking at \r\nour doors for several years. It will be very generous to \r\nthe countries that want to embrace it, but tremendously \r\nindifferent and even cruel to those that ignore it or \r\nsimply let it pass. And in order to deepen our \r\nintegration and to govern globalization better — lest \r\nglobalization should end up governing us — the crisis \r\nmust be addressed differently. \r\n The financial crisis has ceased to be a national \r\nproblem and has acquired regional and often global \r\nimplications. The evils of modern society such as \r\nterrorism, drug trafficking and organized crime know \r\nno frontiers or territories or jurisdictions. And any \r\nattempts to effectively tackle global warming, natural \r\ndisasters, health emergencies, hunger or extreme \r\npoverty are going to require action that is much more \r\nattentive, concerted and effective on the part of the \r\ncommunity of nations. \r\n So the United Nations and other institutions \r\nderiving from the Bretton Woods consensus, such as \r\nthe World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, \r\nurgently need to modernize and adapt to the new times \r\nif they want to play a leading role and not be mere \r\nspectators of events to which we will be witnesses and \r\nprincipal actors. Those new times are the changes \r\nalready taking place in this new century. \r\n As in 1945, when Chile participated in the \r\ncreation of this Organization, and with the authority \r\nconferred on us by the fact of having actively \r\nparticipated in each one of its forums — peacekeeping \r\noperations and humanitarian missions — today we also \r\nwant to participate in encouraging and promoting the \r\ngreat reform and modernization that the United Nations \r\n A/65/PV.12\r\n \r\n27 10-54833 \r\n \r\nand the international order require. That must be done \r\nby creating a much more demanding and efficient \r\ninstitution in terms of goals and expectations, one more \r\nflexible and effective in structure and more determined \r\nand committed in the defence of the ideals for which it \r\nwas created. \r\n In other words, we need a United Nations able to \r\nmeet the challenges and needs of the twenty-first \r\ncentury, which we all know are genuine peace, \r\nsustainable progress and respect for the dignity of all \r\nthose who inhabit our planet. Such reforms require \r\nmodernizing the Security Council so that it is more \r\npluralistic and representative of the new global reality. \r\nIn this regard, we reiterate our appeal for the \r\nincorporation of other emerging countries, such as \r\nBrazil, on our own continent. \r\n I should also like to take this opportunity to offer \r\nmy very sincere congratulations to my predecessor as \r\nPresident of Chile, Michelle Bachelet, on her recent \r\nappointment as Under-Secretary-General for Gender \r\nEquality and the Empowerment of Women, and to \r\nexpress my pride and that of my whole nation at the \r\nfact that a compatriot will be head of a global effort to \r\nachieve greater equality between men and women. I am \r\nsure that, given her human and professional qualities, \r\nshe will lead the new gender entity brilliantly and \r\neffectively. \r\n I also wish to reaffirm our commitment to the \r\nprinciples that have always governed and guided our \r\nforeign policy, including full respect for international \r\nlaw, the inviolability of treaties, the juridical equality \r\nof States, the peaceful settlement of disputes and the \r\nself-determination of peoples, which are unquestionably \r\nessential foundations of international stability and \r\npeaceful coexistence among nations. \r\n I also stress the importance of the promotion of \r\ndemocracy and respect for human rights at all times, in \r\nall places and in all circumstances, and our lasting \r\ncommitment to multilateralism and open regionalism \r\nthat promote constructive and more cooperative \r\neconomic practices among the countries of the world \r\nand of our region. Chile will never cease to raise its \r\nvoice in all international gatherings and forums to \r\ndefend these principles. \r\n Here at the United Nations today, I also wish to \r\nsincerely recognize the aboriginal peoples who \r\ninhabited our lands thousands of years before the \r\nEuropean explorers and conquistadors arrived. We are \r\nvery proud to be a multicultural nation, but we \r\nrecognize that we failed for centuries to give our \r\naboriginal peoples the opportunities they deserved and \r\nneeded. That is why we in Chile are promoting the \r\nconstitutional recognition of all our aboriginal peoples, \r\nabandoning the strategy of assimilation and moving \r\ntowards that of integration. Such a strategy respects, \r\nvalues and protects their languages, culture and \r\ntraditions, which are part of our deepest national \r\nwealth. Along with this constitutional recognition, we \r\nhave established a dialogue involving the Government, \r\ncivil society and our aboriginal peoples, in particular \r\nthe Mapuche, to strengthen the agenda for historic \r\nrediscovery with the most powerful initiative ever \r\nlaunched in Chile on this subject — the Araucanía \r\nPlan. \r\n I would also like to recall that only weeks ago my \r\ncountry was shaken by an event heard around the \r\nworld. A rockslide of more than 100 million tons left \r\n33 miners trapped deep under a mountain in the \r\nAtacama desert. From that moment, our Government \r\nand country committed themselves body and soul and \r\nmade their very best efforts to launch a search-and-\r\nrescue operation. Seventeen anguishing days later, we \r\nwere able to reach the trapped miners. They sent up a  \r\nmessage that filled all my compatriots’ hearts with joy: \r\n“We are okay, we are safe, the 33”. This represents the \r\nwhole paradox of our country. We have struggled so \r\nhard to save the lives of the 33 miners, and yet at the \r\nsame time we have 34 Mapuche herders who are on a \r\nhunger strike that is killing them. \r\n I wish to conclude by telling those assembled \r\nhere that the example of courage and perseverance set \r\nby our 33 miners will light the path to the future. The \r\nfuture is always an adventure. For pessimists, it means \r\nfear; for sceptics, it means doubt; but for all men and \r\nwomen of good will, it always means challenges and \r\nopportunities that we must meet together in order to \r\nbuild a better world than the one we inherited from our \r\nparents, and which we have a duty to bequeath to our \r\nchildren. That challenge, my friends, is for us, and it is \r\nnow, because if it is not now, when, and if not for us, \r\nthen for whom? \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Republic of Chile for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\nA/65/PV.12  \r\n \r\n10-54833 28 \r\n \r\n  Mr. Sebastian Piñera Echeñique, President of the \r\nRepublic of Chile, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\n  Mr. Tanin (Afghanistan), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Bamir Topi, President of the \r\nRepublic of Albania \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nAlbania. \r\n  Mr. Bamir Topi, President of the Republic of \r\nAlbania, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Bamir Topi, President of \r\nthe Republic of Albania, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly. \r\n President Topi (spoke in Albanian; English \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): It is a \r\nspecial honour for me to address the sixty-fifth session \r\nof the General Assembly. I would like to congratulate \r\nthe President on his election to this important position. \r\nHis experience and continuing commitment strengthen \r\nmy conviction that he will take the achievements of his \r\npredecessor even further. Albania will fully support \r\nhim as he fulfils his mandate. I take this opportunity to \r\nexpress our special appreciation to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his continuing efforts to revitalize the \r\nglobal role of the United Nations, as well as to reform \r\nthe Organization. \r\n Albania is of the view that the role of the United \r\nNations remains powerful, coherent and irreplaceable \r\nas the centre of effective global action. It must \r\ncontinue to be encouraged and supported in its efforts \r\nto overcome the challenges of achieving open \r\ninternational cooperation, sustainable peace and \r\nsecurity, ongoing development and greater respect for \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms. \r\n We live in a global world, interconnected and \r\ninterdependent, where States and nations must assist \r\nand support each other in the search for a \r\ncomprehensive answer to the common problems and \r\nnew challenges that we face. Multilateralism remains a \r\npriority for the entire international community. In this \r\ncontext, a reformed United Nations — revitalized, \r\ndynamic, powerful and effective — is crucial to the \r\ncomplicated process of global governance. In this path \r\nof cooperation around the world, the role of the United \r\nNations is irreplaceable, especially in regard to how we \r\nmake use of our human and material resources. \r\n Rapidly evolving issues throughout the world, \r\neach with positive and negative consequences that \r\nmust inevitably influence the challenges the future will \r\nbring, must be given special priority and approached \r\nwith special care. The United Nations challenging \r\nagenda must focus on strengthening peace and security, \r\nfighting terrorism, and the issues of stable \r\ndevelopment, climate change, poverty reduction, the \r\nnon-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, \r\nnatural disasters, human rights, migration, and others. \r\nAlbania remains committed to contributing to this \r\nagenda. \r\n The lead role of the Organization and its agencies \r\nin administering its budgetary and human resources \r\nshould be responsive to the requests of Member States. \r\nThe establishment of the United Nations Entity for \r\nGender Equality and the Empowerment of Women is \r\nthe most recent example of tangible success in United \r\nNations reform. Strengthening the role of women in \r\nsociety will not only enhance political life but also help \r\ntheir emancipation and harmonious development. \r\n The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are \r\na priority in our work. Following the adoption of the \r\nMillennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) a decade ago, \r\nAlbania has advanced towards meeting the MDGs in \r\nall areas and with respect to all indicators. It has also \r\nmade great efforts to incorporate the MDGs into its \r\nnational development strategy. \r\n We are fully committed to reaching the goals set \r\nforth in the acquis communautaire of the European \r\nUnion (EU), which requires increasing investment in \r\nsocial issues, establishing local and central governance \r\nsystems, and enhancing development capacity in order \r\nto guarantee the ongoing improvement of the well-\r\nbeing of the Albanian people. However, as a full-\r\nfledged member of NATO and in the light of its \r\ninternal democratic stability, Albania is now seeking \r\ngreater standing in the world as a way to bolster its \r\ndevelopment in the long term. \r\n Delivering as one is a crucial factor in the reform \r\ndesigned to assist in development around the world. \r\nUnited Nations efforts to establish system-wide \r\ncoherence offer a real possibility to make the United \r\n A/65/PV.12\r\n \r\n29 10-54833 \r\n \r\nNations more effective. As a pilot country, Albania is a \r\nsuccess story, having committed itself fully from the \r\nonset. The One United Nations concept in Albania is \r\nbeing developed in complete harmony with national \r\nsovereignty and national ownership of development, \r\nwhile responding to the specific needs of the country. \r\nThe responsibility of being a pilot country further \r\nencourages us to make this initiative a success. It is \r\nalso an opportunity for us to contribute to the overall \r\nreform of the United Nations. \r\n Albania has signed a memorandum of \r\nunderstanding with the United Nations Department of \r\nPeacekeeping Operations. As a NATO member, \r\nAlbania is a force for peace and stability in the region. \r\nNot only does Albania follow a policy of good-\r\nneighbourly relations and strive for the preservation \r\nand strengthening of stability in its own region, it also \r\nhas shown its interest in and commitment to stability \r\nand peace in other parts of the world by contributing \r\nmilitary and civilian personnel to the peacekeeping \r\nmissions of various international security organizations \r\nand of the United Nations, including the United \r\nNations Mission in the Central African Republic and \r\nChad and missions in Afghanistan and Iraq. We are \r\nthus willing to contribute peacekeeping troops \r\nanywhere in the world under the auspices of the United \r\nNations and regional security organizations like NATO. \r\n Terrorism remains a major threat to peace, \r\ninternational security and world order. The fight \r\nagainst terrorism remains a priority that requires great \r\ndetermination resolve. This global threat may be \r\nprevented and addressed through collective action, \r\nstrong responses and the mobilization of all States \r\nMembers of the United Nations. We must show our \r\nnations that, as a part of our responsibility, we shall \r\nstand resolute and united against terrorism. Together, \r\nwe must define a collective platform and strategy for \r\nvictory in the war against terror by strengthening the \r\ninternational system and order. \r\n We praise and appreciate the work of the Security \r\nCouncil and its committees for their engagement with \r\nand active support for Member States through their \r\neffective implementation of the Council’s counter-\r\nterrorism resolutions, in particular resolutions 1269 \r\n(1999), 1373 (2001), 1540 (2004) and 1624 (2005). \r\nAlbania remains fully committed to cooperating with \r\nthe Security Council in this regard. \r\n Albania appreciates the Secretary-General’s \r\ncontributions to addressing the issue of the Middle \r\nEast, particularly in the discussions aimed at achieving \r\na sustainable solution acceptable to all parties. All \r\npeoples share the desire to live in peace, and \r\nGovernments have an obligation to guarantee it. We \r\nsupport the relaunched dialogue process and hope that, \r\nwith the commitment of the international community, \r\nthe Palestinians and Israelis will take the steps \r\nnecessary to achieving stable peace in that important \r\nregion. \r\n Albania believes that the Alliance of Civilizations \r\nis a political means for the United Nations to promote \r\npeace and harmony among civilizations and to build an \r\ninclusive society through education, understanding and \r\nmutual knowledge. As a member of the Group of \r\nFriends, we shall take active part because we believe in \r\ndialogue and contacts among different cultures, in the \r\nneed to know and respect each other, and in the \r\nnecessity of defending the unique as part of the \r\nrichness of the whole. Our approved national strategy \r\nfor intercultural dialogue and the holding of the \r\nInter-Religious Forum in Tirana in January have served \r\nto enrich our experience. However, our participation in \r\nthe Third Global Forum of the Alliance of Civilizations \r\nled us to believe that a better job of fighting \r\nstereotypes and prejudice is still needed, as are greater \r\nefforts to make modern multicultural societies more \r\ncohesive. \r\n Albania’s integration into and membership of the \r\nEuropean Union is a key priority of our foreign policy, \r\nwhere there has rarely been a broader political and \r\nsocial consensus. The important steps taken by Albania \r\ntowards EU membership and the phases of cooperation \r\nunder the framework of the integration process have \r\nshown a great deal of potential. \r\n The end of this year promises to be decisive as \r\nwe approach two decisions of great importance: the \r\ncompletion of the visa liberalization process with the \r\nEU and the achievement of candidate status for EU \r\nmembership. Albanians will finally be able to enjoy the \r\nreal freedom for which they fought and sacrificed \r\nlonger and more deeply than any other European \r\nnation. The near-unanimous decision of the European \r\nParliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs to remove \r\nthe requirement that Albanians obtain visas to enter the \r\nEU not only gives us great joy, but also confers greater \r\nresponsibility on us to fulfil our commitments as we \r\nprepare for EU membership. \r\nA/65/PV.12  \r\n \r\n10-54833 30 \r\n \r\n We guarantee that the seriousness with which we \r\ncompleted the EU questionnaire and our responsible \r\napproach to our relations with all European Union \r\ninstitutions and member countries will remain the \r\nhallmarks of our efforts to earn the status of candidate \r\ncountry at the earliest possible date. \r\n Albania’s membership in NATO and its \r\nintegration into the European Union are important \r\nregional processes inseparable from the full integration \r\nof the region. We believe that every Western Balkan \r\ncountry is entitled to play a role in contributing to and \r\nassuming responsibility for the integration and \r\nemancipation of the region. I am happy to acknowledge \r\nthat the high level of regional cooperation and political \r\nawareness show that the only way forward is through \r\nEuro-Atlantic integration. \r\n These are hopeful and promising times, now that \r\nthe bitter past of that part of Europe has been \r\nconsigned to history. Albania and Albanians will \r\ncontinue to contribute to stability, security, long-term \r\npeace and economic growth by encouraging integration \r\npolicies related not just to security and economic \r\ndevelopment, but also to coexistence among countries, \r\npeoples and nations, cultures, traditions and history. \r\n A few days ago, a rare occurrence took place in \r\nthis very Hall with the adoption by consensus of \r\nresolution 64/298 on the international legitimacy of the \r\ndeclaration of Kosovo’s independence. That was a very \r\nimportant event for Kosovo, Serbia, the Western \r\nBalkans, a united Europe and the United Nations. I \r\nwould like to express my gratitude for the commitment \r\nand engagement of all international actors, especially \r\nthe European Union, which imbued the resolution with \r\nthe contemporary philosophy and openness of Europe. \r\nThe European Union showed its cohesiveness and \r\nproved that the integration policies of our region are \r\nunstoppable and full of hope, and that the only way to \r\nunite with Europe is through dialogue and cooperation \r\namong neighbouring countries. \r\n Now that the matter of the status of Kosovo and \r\nits borders has been settled definitively, it is time to \r\nbegin a dialogue on practical issues. We hope that the \r\nmessage enshrined in the resolution will immediately \r\nbe put into practice by the two independent countries. \r\nWe support the immediate launch of dialogue between \r\nKosovo and Serbia. We support sincere and \r\nconstructive dialogue to resolve practical issues of \r\ninterest to the daily concerns of their citizens, to help \r\nthem and to facilitate and even calm the situation of the \r\nrespective Albanian and Serbian minorities. It is time \r\nto resolve the problems and issues concerning \r\nrepresentation, language and education, among others, \r\nin the spirit and vision of a common European future. \r\n Albania considers the consensus adoption of \r\nresolution 64/298 to be an important step not only in \r\nrespect of the advisory opinion of the International \r\nCourt of Justice and the authority of the United \r\nNations, but also for the consolidation of the State of \r\nKosovo and its democratic and European institutions, \r\nits independence and integrity, and its future as a \r\nMember of the United Nations. \r\n Albania appreciates the work of the Security \r\nCouncil in its engagement towards the implementation \r\nof the United Nations Charter and international law, \r\nwhich are essential to peaceful coexistence and \r\ncooperation among Member States in addressing \r\ncommon challenges and contributing to international \r\npeace and security. \r\n The advisory opinion of the International Court \r\nof Justice legally confirmed that the independence of \r\nKosovo remains a sui generis case that does not set a \r\nprecedent for situations in other countries. Now is the \r\ntime to prove with concrete facts that we respect the \r\nUnited Nations and the values that have united us here \r\ntoday. Today is the day to testify that we support its \r\nauthority and its independent institutions. Today is a \r\ngolden opportunity to accept the truth and to declare it \r\nloudly. \r\n Today, we have a responsibility towards a country \r\nand a people that rightly wish to be among us and have \r\ngiven ample evidence that they truly deserve it. I take \r\nthis opportunity to appeal to my colleagues, whose \r\ncountries have not yet recognized the independence of \r\nKosovo, to recognize it now, by assuring them that this \r\nis the only way to contribute to long-term stability and \r\npeace, not just in the region but also globally. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to confirm once again \r\nthat Albania is determined to continue to support the \r\nUnited Nations agenda and the stronger functioning of \r\nthe Organization at all levels. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Albania for the statement he has just made. \r\n A/65/PV.12\r\n \r\n31 10-54833 \r\n \r\n  Mr. Bamir Topi, President of the Republic of \r\nAlbania, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Leonel Fernández Reyna, President \r\nof the Dominican Republic \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly with now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Dominican \r\nRepublic. \r\n  Mr. Leonel Fernández Reyna, President of the \r\nDominican Republic, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Leonel Fernández Reyna, \r\nPresident of the Dominican Republic, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly. \r\n President Fernández Reyna (spoke in Spanish): \r\nEight years after Switzerland became a full Member of \r\nthe United Nations, we are delighted to see that the \r\npresidency of this General Assembly at its sixty-fifth \r\nsession fell to the 2004 President of the Swiss \r\nConfederation, Mr. Joseph Deiss, to whom we wish the \r\ngreatest success in his tenure. \r\n In 1998, the twentieth special session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly was held to contribute to the \r\nelimination or substantial reduction of the illegal \r\nproduction of drugs and drug abuse by 2008. Ten years \r\nlater, at a follow-up review meeting supported by this \r\nprestigious world body, the conclusion was reached \r\nthat little progress had been made regarding the \r\nproposed goals and that there were therefore plenty of \r\nreasons for the international community to be \r\nconcerned about the growing threat posed by the global \r\ndrug problem. It was determined that a new 10-year \r\nplan was needed to cover the period until 2019, when \r\nthe General Assembly will have once again to convene \r\nMember States in order to assess the outcome of \r\nmeasures implemented to eliminate the most serious \r\nthreat to our citizens’ safety at the dawn of the twenty-\r\nfirst century: transnational organized crime and illegal \r\ndrug trafficking. \r\n Today, almost 250 million people between the \r\nages of 15 and 64 consume drugs worldwide. Although \r\nthat consumption extends to many regions around the \r\nworld, the highest concentration of users is found in \r\nareas with the most pronounced economic and social \r\ndevelopment, such as the United States, Western \r\nEurope and Central Asia. \r\n Drug consumption is harmful to health, causing \r\npersonality disorders that often lead to loss of will, \r\napathy and the development of pathological behaviour. \r\nFurthermore, tens of thousands of people die every \r\nyear as a direct result of drug consumption, while \r\nothers, depending on the way these toxic substances \r\nare consumed, are affected by diseases such as \r\nHIV/AIDS and hepatitis C. \r\n Today, illegal drug trafficking constitutes a global \r\nblack market, a kind of underground or hidden \r\neconomy for the growth, manufacture, distribution and \r\nsale of this merchandise in the form of marijuana, \r\nopium, heroin, cocaine, methamphetamines and other \r\nvarieties of such substances and others. That market, \r\nwhich is ruled like any other by the laws of supply and \r\ndemand, now amounts to the astronomical sum of \r\napproximately $400 billion a year. That astronomical \r\nsum means that the global drug trade is worth more \r\nthan the gross domestic product of 122 of the \r\n184 countries that appear on the annual World Bank \r\neconomic index. Every year, the global drug market \r\ngenerates more wealth than countries such as Chile, \r\nDenmark, Egypt, Finland, Israel, South Africa and \r\nPortugal. But, at the same time, it is more \r\neconomically powerful than many of the world’s \r\nleading petroleum producing countries such as Kuwait, \r\nQatar, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates and the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela. \r\n In pursuit of its goals of conquering markets and \r\naccumulating wealth, transnational organized crime has \r\nbegun availing itself of a new type of unprecedented, \r\ninhumane and cruel violence. Drug trafficking uses \r\nkidnapping, contract killings, torture and beheadings \r\nboth in battles between drug trafficking groups and \r\nagainst the people and institutions that confront them. \r\nDrug trafficking sows fear and terror. It executes public \r\nservants as well as ordinary citizens. It murders \r\njournalists, teachers, doctors, students and housewives. \r\nDrug trafficking knows no limits or borders; it knows \r\nonly horror, barbarism, bloodshed and crime. \r\n It is so powerful that it influences and interferes \r\nin vital areas of government, such as the armed forces, \r\nthe police, intelligence services and the justice system, \r\nin its attempt to make State institutions serve its \r\nmacabre and sinister interests. \r\nA/65/PV.12  \r\n \r\n10-54833 32 \r\n \r\n In the face of all of this, some people are right to \r\nwonder whether transnational organized crime and \r\nillegal international drug trafficking can be defeated. Is \r\nit really possible to tackle and defeat all that this form \r\nof international crime entails? \r\n Our response is: yes, it is possible. It is possible \r\nto take it on and to defeat it. It is possible to reduce it \r\nand to mitigate its harmful effects. However, to do so, \r\nseveral elements need to be in place. First, we need \r\ngenuine commitment at the global level and authentic \r\nand genuine political will at the level of national \r\nGovernment. \r\n We also need a paradigm change or a new \r\nstrategic vision that will focus our efforts to fight the \r\nproblem, not only on the supply side, as has \r\nfundamentally been the case so far, but also on the \r\ndemand and consumption side.  \r\n It is imperative that we curb indiscriminate gun \r\nsales and human trafficking. We need to implement \r\nexchange and cooperation policies among the narcotics \r\nproducer, transit and consumer countries. We need to \r\nintroduce new technologies, strengthen intelligence \r\nsystems, better train and enhance the professionalism \r\nof those in charge of ensuring public safety, design \r\nprevention mechanisms, generate educational \r\nopportunities, reduce poverty and create jobs, and get \r\ncommunities involved in building protective networks \r\nagainst crime. \r\n We hope that, in 2019, when the General \r\nAssembly convenes its member States to evaluate the \r\noutcome of its new 10-year Plan of Action on \r\nInternational Cooperation towards an Integrated and \r\nBalanced Strategy to Counter the World Drug Problem \r\n(see resolution 64/182), we will be in a position to say, \r\nfor the sake of our families, our young people, our \r\nsocieties and, ultimately, of humanity as a whole, “We \r\nhave prevailed. We have defeated the leading threat to \r\nthe security our peoples at the beginning of the twenty-\r\nfirst century. We have beaten drugs.” \r\n It is important also to note that the human and \r\nmaterial losses experienced as a result of natural \r\ndisasters in 2010 are a great cause for concern. To date, \r\nwe have seen 47 floods and landslides, affecting \r\ncountries as far apart as India and Brazil, China and \r\nColombia, Russia and Congo, Kazakhstan and \r\ncountries of East Africa, Mexico and Central America, \r\nPakistan, Yemen and the Sudan. \r\n To date, there have been 12 hurricanes, cyclones \r\nand typhoons, affecting countries such as Mexico, \r\nIndia, the Solomon Islands and Madagascar. To date, \r\nwe have suffered eight serious droughts, followed by \r\nfires, in Bolivia, California, the Caribbean, China, \r\nSpain and Russia. To date, there have been seven \r\nearthquakes, from the tragedy in Haiti to China, from \r\nTajikistan to Chile, and from Afghanistan to Mexico. \r\n That does not include the volcanic eruptions — \r\nthese too made no distinction between rich and poor. In \r\nthe case of Iceland, the volcano led to the most serious \r\ninterruption of air traffic since the Second World War. \r\nIn addition, we need to take into account the numerous \r\ncold snaps, avalanches and storms that have occurred \r\nand their resultant epidemics — foremost among them, \r\ncholera in Africa and dengue fever in Latin America \r\nand the Caribbean. \r\n As we can see, vulnerability to natural disasters \r\naround the world is on the rise, and development levels \r\nare falling quickly as a result. Most of these natural \r\ndisasters are caused by climate change or global \r\nwarming. It is therefore imperative that this world body \r\nadopt, as soon as possible, guidelines to regulate the \r\nemission of carbon dioxide and to protect the planet’s \r\nbiodiversity. \r\n There is much work to be done around the world \r\nto draw up and adopt policies and practices that will \r\nenable us to prevent the impact of natural disasters. In \r\nthis context, it is crucial to incorporate risk \r\nmanagement into development and land-use planning. \r\nWe need to design and implement early warning \r\nsystems in coastal areas, cities at risk, schools and \r\nhospitals. And we need urgently to re-equip critical \r\ninfrastructure to ensure that it is adequate to withstand \r\nfuture catastrophes and to minimize human loss. Faced \r\nwith this situation, the Dominican Republic intends to \r\nparticipate actively in the work of the Global Platform \r\nfor Disaster Risk Reduction, whose next meeting will \r\ntake place in Geneva, Switzerland, in May 2011. \r\n Likewise, with advisory assistance from the \r\nUnited Nations Development Programme and New \r\nYork’s Columbia University, in October we will be \r\nmeeting with the ministers responsible for social policy \r\nas well as the mayors of cities at greatest risk in order \r\nto review ongoing activities in the integration and \r\nplanning of natural disaster risk management. \r\n Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to \r\nsuggest, as we did during a visit to L’Aquila, Italy, that \r\n A/65/PV.12\r\n \r\n33 10-54833 \r\n \r\nthe United Nations system create a world alliance of \r\ncountries at risk in order to exchange experiences, \r\nknowledge and ideas, and to pass along best practices \r\nlearned during catastrophes. We are convinced that this \r\nwould be a major contribution to the design and \r\nimplementation of measures that will help save lives \r\nand minimize material damage. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly I would like to thank the President of the \r\nDominican Republic for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n  Mr. Leonel Fernández Reyna, President of the \r\nDominican Republic, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\n \r\nAddress by Ms. Dalia Grybauskaitė, President of the \r\nRepublic of Lithuania \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nLithuania. \r\n  Ms. Dalia Grybauskaitė, President of the Republic \r\nof Lithuania, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations Her Excellency Ms. Dalia Grybauskaitė, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Lithuania, and to invite \r\nher to address the Assembly. \r\n President Grybauskaitė: I am delighted and \r\nprivileged to address this Assembly. I believe that this \r\nis the right place to discuss the issues of greatest \r\nconcern to the international community. Recent years \r\nhave been marked by many challenges. All countries, \r\nlarge and small, had to tackle the financial and \r\neconomic downturn. They also had to deal with the \r\npainful consequences of natural and man-created \r\ndisasters. In a global world, all our countries must \r\nshare responsibility for the future. The scale of our \r\ndeeds and the openness of our hearts will make the \r\ndifference, not the size of our countries and territories. \r\nHere, I would like to share some views of my country, \r\nLithuania. \r\n Let me start with our proposals in the fields of \r\nsecurity and the environment. Lithuania has launched \r\nan initiative to introduce in the General Assembly a \r\ndraft resolution on sea-dumped chemical weapons. \r\nLithuania wants to strengthen international efforts in \r\nraising public awareness about dangerous munitions \r\nburied in the sea. It is in every country’s interest to \r\nsupport a voluntary information exchange in order to \r\nstrengthen common security. Everyone must be aware \r\nhow lethally dangerous these dumped chemicals still \r\nare. We need to have guidelines on how to behave in \r\ncase of disaster. That is why United Nations \r\ninvolvement and an eventual resolution on this issue \r\nare so indispensable. That is why I call on the United \r\nNations to take a much more active role in very \r\nconcrete projects, even if they may not seem big \r\nenough for global attention. \r\n Gender equality is another topic of vital \r\nimportance for the nations of the world. We decided to \r\npromote it in the framework of the Community of \r\nDemocracies. That is another example of precisely \r\nfocused action. Gender equality issues are rarely \r\nassociated with issues like overcoming the economic \r\ncrisis or stopping climate change. However, it has been \r\nestimated that the elimination of gender discrimination \r\nin the labour market in Europe, for example, could \r\nincrease gross domestic product by as much as 30 per \r\ncent. \r\n It seems that the Lithuanian people have decided \r\nto test this estimate in practice, and I can give an \r\nexample. It is no surprise to us that women in \r\nLithuania hold a number of top positions in politics and \r\nbusiness. It is only natural that Lithuanian women have \r\nmade their own the famous saying: When the going \r\ngets tough, the tough get going. But we still need much \r\nmore coordinated effort. Gender equality on a global \r\nscale will become possible only when a certain level of \r\nsecurity and economic development is achieved. Let us \r\nall put all our efforts together to eradicate intolerance \r\nand discrimination, which so often are the main \r\nreasons for the many conflicts in the world. By doing \r\nthis we also pave the road to achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals that we all aspire to. European \r\nUnion activities such as the European Institute for \r\nGender Equality, based in Lithuania, can serve to lead \r\nother regions. I strongly hope that the high-level \r\nmeeting on gender equality issues which will be held \r\nwithin the framework of the Community of \r\nDemocracies in Vilnius, Lithuania, on 30 June next \r\nyear will explore many more new ideas and good \r\npractices. \r\n Security, the environment and gender equality: all \r\nare interdependent, and all need to be adequately \r\naddressed on the international agenda. That is a \r\nA/65/PV.12  \r\n \r\n10-54833 34 \r\n \r\nprerequisite for ensuring sustainable development. The \r\nEuropean Union has been for years the largest and \r\nmost responsible donor worldwide, the best example \r\nfor any country willing to contribute. These European \r\nvalues are very dear to my country, which has been a \r\nmember of the European Union since 2004. Lithuania \r\nhas limited resources, but we have provided \r\nhumanitarian aid to Haiti, Pakistan, Moldova, Ukraine, \r\nRussia and other countries. \r\n We have engaged in such difficult initiatives as \r\nthe training of the national security forces of \r\nAfghanistan. Working together with the people of Ghor \r\nprovince in Afghanistan, Lithuania has funded a \r\nnumber of community-based education programmes, \r\nbuilt 19 schools which have opened up their doors also \r\nfor girls, founded the first public library in the \r\nprovince’s capital of Chaghcharan. That is our modest \r\ncontribution, but it works. I am sure that each time we \r\nimplement a concrete project we move closer to \r\nachieving our global objectives all together. \r\n I invite all the leaders gathered here to contribute. \r\nWe should welcome, support and multiply any and \r\nevery constructive effort, however small it may seem \r\nto us. Only joint efforts and concrete deeds will bring \r\npositive change to international politics. Let us develop \r\ninitiatives, let us implement them, let us implement the \r\nbest practices and let us work together. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Lithuania for the statement she has just made. \r\n  Ms. Dalia Grybauskaitė, President of the Republic \r\nof Lithuania, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Evo Morales Ayma, President of the \r\nPlurinational State of Bolivia \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Plurinational \r\nState of Bolivia. \r\n  Mr. Evo Morales Ayma, President of the \r\nPlurinational State of Bolivia, was escorted into \r\nthe General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Evo Morales Ayma, \r\nPresident of the Plurinational State of Bolivia, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Morales Ayma (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThis is the first time I have participated in the general \r\ndebate since the declaration of the Plurinational State \r\nof Bolivia and my fifth as President — since I took on \r\nenormous responsibilities towards my people, acting \r\nthrough social movements. \r\n I would like to quickly say that in four and a half \r\nyears in government, we have begun to bring profound \r\nstructural and social change to Bolivia. Fortunately, \r\ntwo weeks ago, the United Nations recognized that \r\nextreme poverty had decreased from 41 to 32 per cent. \r\nIn four and a half years, our small country of \r\n10 million inhabitants has seen its national reserves \r\ngrow from $1.7 billion to $9 billion. The rate of \r\neconomic growth is currently 5 per cent, while before I \r\narrived it was barely 3 per cent. \r\n There has been a democratization of the national \r\neconomy, with grants and subsidies that have allowed \r\nfor the improvement of the economic situation of the \r\npoorest and most abandoned — in particular those of \r\nthe rural and indigenous movement, but also our \r\nbrothers and sisters the workers, and our brothers and \r\nsisters from the barrios of Bolivia’s big cities. \r\n However, the improvement of our economy has \r\nbasically come with the recovery of our oil and gas \r\nreserves, and with the nationalization of these natural \r\nresources. Let me say that earlier, and unfortunately, \r\nunder instructions from the International Monetary \r\nFund (IMF), our natural resources were privatized. \r\nMoreover, the IMF contracts stated that the owner, the \r\ntransnational oil company, would have the rights from \r\nthe wellhead. The Fund Governors were telling us that \r\nas long as the oil or gas was underground, it belonged \r\nto the Bolivian State and the Bolivian people, but that \r\nonce it was taken out and reached the wellhead, it was \r\nthe property of the transnationals. From these \r\nmega-fields the oil transnationals received 82 per cent \r\nof the gas and oil revenue, while the Bolivian people \r\nwere left with only 18 per cent. \r\n It is a matter of responsibility. Countries that \r\ninvest have the right to recover their investment and \r\nthey have the right to make profits, but not 82 per cent \r\nof all of the profits from our oil and gas resources. On \r\n1 May 2006, the Government decreed, first, that the \r\nState would take control of all oil fields. We \r\nnationalized them. Secondly, so that the investing \r\ncompany, seeking to recover their investment, could do \r\nso and make a profit. We looked at the numbers \r\n A/65/PV.12\r\n \r\n35 10-54833 \r\n \r\ncarefully in order to ensure that the company would not \r\nbe harmed. Our data showed that with 18 per cent of \r\nthe profit, they would recover their investment and \r\nthey would even have access to profits. \r\n What I did with our supreme decree, after taking \r\ntotal State control of gas and oil, was to ensure that the \r\nState, the Bolivian people, received 82 per cent of the \r\nprofits and the investing oil company, 18 per cent. \r\nThese companies continue to be present in our country \r\nand continue to invest in Bolivia. We had discovered \r\nthat there was an ongoing sacking of our natural \r\nresources and this alone has brought changes to our \r\neconomy. For example, since 1940, Bolivia had never \r\nhad a budget surplus, only deficits. But once we had \r\nnationalized oil and gas, in 2006, the first year of my \r\nadministration, we had a surplus. With this surplus, we \r\nwere able to provide grants and subsidies for some of \r\nthe most vulnerable sectors of the population, namely, \r\nyoung people and the elderly. \r\n In February 2003, when I was a union leader and \r\nNational Deputy, the International Monetary Fund \r\ninstructed the then Government to institute an income \r\ntax or to increase fuel prices in order to decrease the \r\nbudget deficit — not to eliminate it, but to decrease it. \r\nThe Government decided to institute an income tax. \r\nThere was an uprising by those affected by this tax, \r\nand in two days of confrontation there were 15 dead. \r\n I would like to say from here at the United \r\nNations to the world and to the Bolivian people that, \r\nwithout income taxes and without increasing fuel \r\nprices, we had a surplus in the first year of our \r\nadministration. It was so important to have recovered \r\nour natural resources and to have recovered our \r\ncompanies providing basic services. \r\n Sooner or later the International Monetary Fund \r\nhas to redress the damage it has done to Bolivia and to \r\nLatin America. But it appears that the International \r\nMonetary Fund, under the pretext of structural \r\nadjustment, is continuing to impose policies on some \r\ncountries — policies of pillaging natural resources. It \r\ndid us great harm. I am demanding officially that the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund pay for the economic \r\ndamage and the damage to human beings that resulted \r\nfrom these impositions which, in Bolivia, resulted in \r\ndeath, injury and hunger. \r\n  Ms. Lucas (Luxembourg), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n \r\n So I am very pleased that we have begun to \r\nchange Bolivia. Of course, it is impossible to meet all \r\nthe demands that our indigenous brethren have been \r\nmaking for 500 years, or that other brethren or regions \r\nhave been making for hundreds of years — or indeed \r\nthe demands which have arisen from 20 years of \r\nneoliberal Government in our country. \r\n We are living in times of deep and sweeping \r\nchanges. We have an enormous responsibility to future \r\ngenerations. The fate of Planet Earth depends on what \r\nwe do or do not do. \r\n We know ourselves. We have many ideological \r\ndifferences. We have many differences in our \r\nprogrammes, our cultures and our societies. We have \r\nmany differences from one continent to another. The \r\neconomic asymmetries are profound. But despite these \r\ndifferences we at the United Nations must work \r\ntogether, united. Why united? We must be united so \r\nthat human rights will be well and truly protected \r\naround the world. I come here to propose an alliance of \r\nall presidents and Governments so that we can save \r\nhumankind and save Planet Earth — or save \r\nhumankind by saving Planet Earth. \r\n There are four main objectives, the first being the \r\nprotection of human rights. I commend the many \r\nGovernments that last week adopted a proposal from \r\nthe Government of the Plurinational State of Bolivia \r\nthat water be recognized as a human right. Next will be \r\nenergy and after that communication. We must move \r\nforward and respond to the needs of the most \r\nvulnerable — the poor, the disenfranchised, the \r\nmigrants. All basic services in Bolivia are a human \r\nright under the Constitution. And we are currently \r\ntranslating that concept into practice, so that all these \r\nbasic services will truly be a human right. That is why \r\nI think it important to have an alliance now, in this new \r\nmillennium, to see that human rights are guaranteed for \r\nall. \r\n I should also like to say that it is indefensible in \r\nthe twenty-first century to continue to persecute and \r\nexpel migrants — whether they are migrants because \r\nof economic problems or because of climate change or \r\na natural disaster. I would like to take this opportunity \r\nto say that I learned from the media that President \r\nObama is rejecting the Arizona law. We must recognize \r\nthe need to put an end to policies — wherever they \r\noriginate, including the return policies of Europe — \r\nthat have the effect of expelling migrants. When our \r\nA/65/PV.12  \r\n \r\n10-54833 36 \r\n \r\nancestors migrated because of war or famine from \r\nEurope to Latin America there was no expulsion of \r\nmigrants. Those European migrants took over \r\nthousands of hectares and pillaged natural resources, \r\nand no one said anything. But now that our brothers \r\nand sisters, driven by lack of work, emigrate in search \r\nof jobs in the United States or Europe, they suffer \r\npersecution, discrimination and expulsion. This has to \r\nstop. Our alliance must also examine the fate of these \r\nbrothers and sisters. \r\n I have also heard it said that walls or fences are \r\nbeing built in, for example, Mexico and Palestine. As \r\nfar as I know, fences are only built to keep in cattle, \r\nsheep and cows. We cannot confuse human beings with \r\nanimals and build fences to keep them in. It makes no \r\nsense. But I also want to say: how can we prevent \r\nhuman beings from going from one continent to \r\nanother? We have heard much opinion in this debate on \r\nthe subject of free-market policies. Are commodities to \r\ncirculate freely around the world but not human \r\nbeings? What type of discriminatory policies do we \r\nhave? Those walls of shame must disappear. I listened \r\ncarefully to the address by the Secretary-General. He \r\nwants the United Nations to be strong in the interests \r\nof good governance. I share that opinion but believe \r\nthat we can only achieve this when we resolve the \r\nproblems of the world’s most defenceless people, who \r\nare migrants in this case. And that is why it is \r\nimportant for us to be rid of these walls. \r\n But there is something else that is unthinkable in \r\nthe twenty-first century: the economic blockade of \r\nCuba. Everyone calls for the lifting of this embargo, \r\nimposed because Cuba was a Communist or socialist \r\ncountry. I want you to know that I too preside over a \r\nGovernment that is anti-capitalist, which, I think, is \r\nwhy the United States Department of State tries to \r\nmarginalize and exclude us. That is not a solution. \r\nPeople will continue to rebel against systems and \r\neconomic models that do not resolve the problems of \r\nthe majority in all our countries. I respectfully ask \r\nPresident Obama to put an end to the economic \r\nblockade of Cuba and the economic blockade of the \r\nGaza Strip in Palestine. If the United States is — and \r\nwe all know this to be the case — the supreme world \r\nPower, it has the authority to end this injustice and this \r\nviolation of the human rights of millions around the \r\nworld. \r\n The second objective of this alliance of \r\nGovernments to save humanity is its most important \r\nresponsibility: determining how to save Mother Earth. \r\nWhat concerns me greatly is that some countries, \r\ninstead of conserving Nature, are looking at how to \r\nmake a business out of climate change, putting a price \r\non Nature. We must not privatize our forests; we must \r\nnot sell carbon bonds as if the forest’s only role were to \r\nabsorb carbon dioxide. Any country that does so is \r\nmaking a grave mistake. \r\n I want to share something from our culture and \r\nour experience in the indigenous world. We indigenous \r\npeoples live in harmony with Mother Earth, in \r\nharmony with Nature. Why do we live in harmony with \r\nNature? We came from the Earth, we live on the Earth \r\nand to earth we will return. The Earth, Planet Earth, \r\nNature, “Pachamama”, Mother Earth — this is our \r\nhome, this is our mother. The Earth gives us life: water, \r\nnatural resources, the abundance of Nature. How can \r\nwe turn Mother Nature into a business? \r\n Because of the discussion I have with social \r\nmovements around the world, particularly with \r\nindigenous movements, I am convinced that the planet \r\ncan exist without human beings, but human beings \r\ncannot exist without the planet. As human beings have \r\nrights, like the right to life, so too does the planet, \r\nMother Nature, have the right to life. Just as we human \r\nbeings reproduce, biodiversity has a right to \r\nregenerate. For these and many other reasons besides, \r\nwe have the obligation to save Planet Earth. \r\n Within that context, our proposal is quite simple. \r\nHere at the United Nations we must develop a project \r\nto protect the rights of Mother Earth. This morning \r\nPresident Obama referred to the adoption in 1948 of \r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights at the \r\nUnited Nations. That was 62 years ago; before that we \r\ndid not have rights. Later civil, economic and political \r\nrights were adopted. Three years ago the rights of \r\nindigenous peoples were adopted here. Now in this \r\nmillennium we should adopt the rights of Mother \r\nEarth. And if we do not do this, we will be responsible \r\nfor a world disaster. \r\n To take an example: in a plane some people travel \r\nin first class, others in business class, while the \r\nmajority travel in coach, economy class. If the plane \r\ncrashes, no one survives — neither the first-class \r\npassenger nor the economy-class passenger. Is that \r\nwhat we want? It will be the same if we do not save \r\nMother Earth. The transnational company with lots of \r\nmoney, the millionaire — all of us will be equally \r\n A/65/PV.12\r\n \r\n37 10-54833 \r\n \r\naffected by the environmental problems that come with \r\nclimate change. \r\n That is why I want to tell you how important it is \r\nthat we prepare for Cancún, where we will have a great \r\nopportunity. I will propose there that we have an \r\nalliance of all the presidents and heads of government \r\nof the world, headed by the Secretary-General of the \r\nUnited Nations. What will the alliance be for? So that \r\ntogether we can determine how to cool the planet. We \r\nare talking about global warming. How can we cool the \r\nplanet? We, as peoples and Governments, are \r\nresponsible for humankind. The people, at a summit in \r\nCochabamba, Bolivia, said that we must stabilize the \r\ntemperature increase at 1 degree Celsius. The \r\ndeveloped countries, which are primarily responsible \r\nfor global warming, must commit to reducing their \r\ngreenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent during the \r\nsecond period of the Kyoto Protocol. Let us assume our \r\nresponsibilities to cool Planet Earth. \r\n I would like to discuss the serious situation in \r\nwhich my country finds itself. We sometimes buy drills \r\nto deal with droughts, and yet even by drilling we \r\ncannot find water. And if we do find it, it is buried ever \r\ndeeper and occurs in ever-smaller quantities. Soon, \r\ndespite all our drilling to obtain water, we will not find \r\nit. So what use will the drills be then? Our mountains \r\nare losing their snow fields. This is extremely serious. I \r\ntherefore find it extremely important that we stabilize \r\nthe temperature increase at 1 degree Celsius, as the \r\npeople of the world have said. \r\n The third objective, so frequently mentioned in \r\nstatements, is peace. We are all fighting for peace. We \r\nare all fighting for freedom, but the basis of freedom is \r\nequality and justice for all peoples. There will not be \r\npeace without social justice. Moreover, peace is not \r\nmade with military bases; peace is not ensured by \r\nmilitary interventions undertaken on the pretext of \r\nfighting against drug trafficking and terrorism but \r\nreally aimed at developing geopolitical interests — \r\naims I do not share. Yes, we must combat drug \r\ntrafficking. The best way to do so, I would say, is to \r\nput an end to banking secrecy. It is not right that the \r\nUnited States Government should decertify countries \r\nthat are not following the capitalist line. The Bolivian \r\nGovernment is making an effort to reduce coca crops. \r\nBut while the major cocaine-producing countries are \r\ncertified, the country that makes a real effort against \r\ndrug trafficking, a small country, is decertified. \r\n These are, of course, political decisions, and that \r\nis why I draw the conclusion that anti-imperialist, \r\nanti-capitalist countries will never be certified by the \r\nUnited States Government. In the end, this does not \r\nconcern or affect my Government. We are convinced \r\nthat there will be this type of scare tactic, harassment \r\nand intimidation. That has always existed. But there \r\nare contradictions here as well. The United Nations \r\ntells us that coca cultivation has increased by 1 per \r\ncent, while the United States Department of State says \r\nthat coca crops have increased by 9.4 per cent. Whom \r\nare we to believe — the United States or the United \r\nNations? Imagine the spin that is put on this to penalize \r\na Government or a country. The reports recognize the \r\nstrong efforts undertaken by the national Government \r\nin the fight against drug trafficking. For example, dried \r\ncoca is down to 43,000 tons from 43,500. But even this \r\neffort is not recognized, which is why we are \r\nconvinced that this is clearly a political problem. \r\n I believe that it is important to put an end to the \r\nacts of aggression, to the interventions in such \r\ncountries as Afghanistan and Iraq, and to the threats to \r\nIran. Let us put an end to the entire nuclear arsenal, \r\nbecause the nuclear arsenal is a threat to life. Let us \r\nbegin with the United States and then continue with all \r\nthe other countries. And this is not merely an attempt \r\nto punish a country that may wish to implement other \r\npolicies. Instead of spending so much money allegedly \r\non defence and security, in the end it is for war. If we \r\nare responsible to humankind, we must change \r\neveryone’s mindset. \r\n The last objective of this alliance would be to \r\nwork together to strengthen the United Nations, but we \r\nalso have to begin to democratize the United Nations. \r\nThis is a very difficult task, of course. We have heard \r\nstatements made by heads of government and by \r\npresidents. Some anti-capitalist presidents are accused \r\nof being authoritarian or totalitarian, of being dictators. \r\nDelegations know, and the world knows, how a coup \r\nd’état in a country such as Honduras can be ensured \r\nhere. This morning President Obama talked about \r\nworking with countries that fight against poverty. In \r\nBolivia we have greatly reduced poverty, and yet \r\ninvestments are cut. He has said that he will work with \r\ndemocratic Governments. In Bolivia, in five years I \r\nhave won two referendums and three elections, all with \r\nmore than 50 or 60 per cent of the vote. Where is the \r\ndictatorship? Where is the authoritarianism? The \r\nauthoritarianism is here at the United Nations. Some \r\nA/65/PV.12  \r\n \r\n10-54833 38 \r\n \r\nGovernments, some countries have permanent seats \r\nwith the right to veto. That is authoritarianism, and that \r\nis why we must begin to democratize the United \r\nNations if we want to move ahead with a democratic \r\nmindset or focus. We must start by practising \r\ndemocracy here. But, above all, I want to tell you, \r\nbrothers and sisters present here, that we must work \r\ntogether to ensure that, sooner or later, the United \r\nNations becomes an anti-capitalist Organization, if we \r\nare to save humankind. If we do not do that, we will be \r\nheld responsible. And I assume my responsibility by \r\ntelling you this in a direct and straightforward way. I \r\nam not at all scared because I know what the \r\nconsequences of capitalism are — in particular, with \r\nregard to the destruction of Mother Earth. \r\n I was thinking that our United Nations — and as \r\na President I feel part of the United Nations — should \r\nhave a slogan, a war cry for the effort to save \r\nhumankind. I propose to the Assembly and its \r\nPresident that our war cry should be “The planet or \r\ndeath; we shall win!” And I wish to say that, from what \r\nI have learned in my four and a half years as President \r\nof my country, if there is the political will to serve the \r\npeople of the world, the people of the world can be \r\nsaved. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Plurinational State of Bolivia for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n  Mr. Evo Morales Ayma, President of the \r\nPlurinational State of Bolivia, was escorted from \r\nthe General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Ernest Bai Koroma, President of the \r\nRepublic of Sierra Leone \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Sierra Leone. \r\n  Mr. Ernest Bai Koroma, President of the Republic \r\nof Sierra Leone, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Ernest Bai Koroma, President of the Republic of \r\nSierra Leone. \r\n President Koroma: Once again, it is a great \r\nhonour and pleasure for me to address this \r\ndistinguished Assembly. Let me start by congratulating \r\nMr. Joseph Deiss on his assumption of the presidency \r\nat the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly and \r\nassuring him of my delegation’s full support and \r\ncooperation. I would also like to convey my sincere \r\nappreciation to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Ali \r\nAbdussalam Treki, for his efficient and effective \r\nconduct of the previous session. My gratitude also goes \r\nto the Secretary-General for his comprehensive account \r\nof the work of the United Nations and his analysis of \r\nthe challenges facing our global community. \r\n In my statement I would like to talk both about \r\nthe successes that my country has achieved with the \r\nhelp of the international community and about the \r\nreforms we now need to make in the way we interact \r\nand govern ourselves globally. My Government is \r\nsincerely grateful for the international community’s \r\nengagement with Sierra Leone’s efforts to put the \r\ncountry on a path to sustained economic growth and \r\ndevelopment. Building on this engagement, our \r\ncountry has significantly improved our international \r\nstanding in many areas. \r\n The Global Peace Index now ranks Sierra Leone \r\nas the fifty-third most peaceful country in the world. \r\nThe Mo Ibrahim Index records that we are one of the \r\nfive crisis-affected countries that have made a \r\nsignificant leap forward in democratic governance. A \r\nrecent International Monetary Fund review shows \r\nimprovement in our public finances, with our 4 per \r\ncent annual economic growth rate higher than the \r\naverage rate of 2 per cent for sub-Saharan Africa. We \r\nhave also made steady progress in our rankings on \r\ndoing business, corruption perception and democracy. \r\nIn addition, earlier this year I was the proud recipient \r\non behalf of the people of Sierra Leone of a peace prize \r\nawarded by ACCORD, the African Centre for the \r\nConstructive Resolution of Disputes. And only last \r\nweek my country received a Millennium Development \r\nGoal Award for showing outstanding leadership in the \r\nfight against HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases. \r\n My Government has also continued to emphasize \r\nthe protection of the basic rights of the people of Sierra \r\nLeone. We have put in place comprehensive justice \r\nsector reforms in response to both national and global \r\ndemands, to ensure that the rights of citizens are \r\npreserved, and that they have access to justice for all. \r\nAnd the Human Rights Commission of Sierra Leone \r\n A/65/PV.12\r\n \r\n39 10-54833 \r\n \r\nhas assumed a lead role in advising my Government on \r\nbuilding a culture of human rights. It ensures that the \r\nGovernment ratifies international treaties and protocols \r\nand fulfils its reporting obligations. A case in point is \r\nour recent validation of the common core document \r\nthat forms the basis for all reporting on international \r\ntreaties. \r\n Sierra Leone is among the few countries \r\nemerging from conflict that have formulated a \r\ncomprehensive action plan for Security Council \r\nresolutions 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008). My \r\nGovernment is determined to ensure effective \r\nimplementation of the action plan, particularly in \r\naddressing gender-based violence as well as enhancing \r\nwomen’s participation in politics and the public sector. \r\n My Government’s commitment to free media is \r\nequally strong. No journalist has been imprisoned in \r\nmy country since I assumed office. We have transformed \r\nthe Government-owned broadcasting services into what is \r\nonly the second independent public service broadcaster in \r\nAfrica, the Sierra Leone Broadcasting Corporation. \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon witnessed the launch of \r\nthis historic, groundbreaking initiative in June. It is the \r\nbeginning of a new era of access to independent, unbiased \r\nand impartial information in our country. \r\n My Government is also delivering results on the \r\nkey priorities in my Agenda for Change to improve the \r\nlives of all Sierra Leoneans. We have launched free \r\nhealth care for pregnant and lactating women, as well \r\nas children under five, for the first time in our history, \r\nimproving access to around 300,000 women and more \r\nthan a million children. We have also begun the serious \r\ncommercialization of agriculture, the mainstay of our \r\neconomy, particularly through smallholder farmers, for \r\nwhom we are facilitating improved mechanization, \r\nirrigation and the establishment of farming \r\ncooperatives. We have successfully made significant \r\nprogress on road construction and the rehabilitation of \r\nelectricity supply in key provincial cities and towns, to \r\ngenerate economic activity across the country. We have \r\nmade great strides in attracting large-scale private \r\nsector investors from international companies, \r\nfollowing the Sierra Leone Trade and Investment \r\nForum in London last year. Furthermore, to maintain \r\nmacroeconomic stability and make those achievements \r\nsustainable, my Government also remains firmly \r\ncommitted to the fight against corruption. \r\n Despite that progress, many challenges remain. I \r\nam proud of what Sierra Leone has achieved so far. But \r\nwe need to further enhance our capacity to promote \r\nand protect human rights, establish good governance \r\nand managerial capacity across the whole public sector \r\nand fight corruption and trafficking in narcotic drugs. \r\nFor all that, our country will need further technical \r\nassistance and cooperation, private capital investments \r\nand technology transfer. \r\n Most importantly, we are not oblivious to the \r\nimperative of consolidating peace through enhanced \r\npolitical dialogue, tolerance and ensuring a free and \r\nfair electoral process. With those elements and our \r\npolitical resolve, we will make further progress \r\ntowards peace, security and a stable and open \r\ndemocracy. \r\n I shall now turn to the theme of the Assembly’s \r\nsixty-fifth session: reaffirming the central role of the \r\nUnited Nations in global governance. It could not have \r\nbeen better timed, at a moment when the global \r\ncommunity is grappling with myriad challenges facing \r\nthe international system. The end of the cold war, \r\ntogether with an explosion in information and \r\ncommunication technologies, gave rise to a new \r\nparadigm of flexible or loose functional coalitions \r\ninvolving State and non-State actors. A new \r\nconfiguration of interdependent relationships, \r\neconomic, social, political and ethnic in nature, has \r\nemerged from those historic circumstances. \r\n There are fears that globalization nurtures the \r\ndominance of power politics, a growing disparity \r\nbetween the North and the South, intolerance of \r\ndifferent values, a tendency to resort to force to solve \r\ninternational conflicts, and neglect of the environment. \r\nAt the same time, globalization has led to a multilevel \r\nsystem of governance that is beginning to address \r\nglobal issues ranging from economic interdependence, \r\nmigration, financial crises and drug trafficking to the \r\npandemics of tuberculosis, avian flu, HIV/AIDS and \r\nmalaria. \r\n It is in recognition of the imperative to promote \r\nmultilateralism and build synergies with both State and \r\nnon-State actors that I commend the choice of theme. \r\nWe support the United Nations more than any other \r\norganization as a centre of global governance. It has \r\nthe unique characteristics of a global mandate and \r\nuniversal membership. Those characteristics make it an \r\nindispensable and neutral catalyst for the achievement \r\nA/65/PV.12  \r\n \r\n10-54833 40 \r\n \r\nof international cooperation in solving international \r\nproblems of an economic, social, cultural or \r\nhumanitarian character. The centrality of the role of the \r\nUnited Nations in global governance cannot be \r\noveremphasized. \r\n The recently concluded High-level Meeting on \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals revealed that \r\nprogress has been uneven and that developing \r\ncountries, particularly those in Africa, continue to be \r\nmost vulnerable to the effects of globalization. The \r\nprevailing global recession resulting from the \r\neconomic and financial crisis that struck developed \r\neconomies has further compounded that challenge. In \r\nthis context, my Government believes that the United \r\nNations remains the crucial hub for norm-setting and \r\nharmonizing the actions of nations for the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security and for the \r\nattainment of our development goals. \r\n The Assembly, meeting at the turn of the \r\nmillennium, decided that reforming the Security \r\nCouncil and making it more accessible, transparent, \r\nequitably representative and accountable was long \r\noverdue. That brings me to the crucial issue that has \r\nled us in Africa to consistently reiterate that there can \r\nbe no meaningful reform of the Council without \r\nallocating permanent seats to the continent. \r\n No one continent should have an exclusive \r\nmonopoly over membership of the Security Council. \r\nThere is no justification for a discriminatory allocation \r\nof seats, nor can we debate endlessly and ignore the \r\nrealities of our rapidly changing global circumstances. \r\n While the fifth round of talks has not truly led to \r\na compromise-oriented solution, distilling all positions \r\ninto a single negotiating document has been a \r\nsignificant step in the right direction. We in Africa look \r\nforward to and support a process that will allow the \r\ntext to evolve during the next session of the General \r\nAssembly in an open, inclusive and balanced manner, \r\ntowards a solution that can garner the widest possible \r\npolitical acceptance by Member States. We urge all \r\ndelegations to muster the political will required for \r\nprogress. \r\n I wish to conclude my statement by saying that \r\nthe moment has come for us to address the historical \r\ninjustice inflicted on Africa by allocating the continent \r\nno less than two seats, with all their attributes and \r\nprivileges, and two additional seats in both the \r\nnon-permanent and permanent categories of the \r\nCouncil. I do not need to emphasize that at the \r\ninception of the United Nations, most of Africa was not \r\nrepresented and that as a result Africa remains to this \r\nday the only continent without a permanent seat in the \r\nCouncil. To ensure greater relevance of the Security \r\nCouncil within a revamped United Nations system, \r\nAfrica demands permanent representation on the \r\nSecurity Council, with all the requisite attributes. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Sierra Leone for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n  Mr. Ernest Bai Koroma, President of the Republic \r\nof Sierra Leone, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Jalal Talabani, President of the \r\nRepublic of Iraq \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Iraq. \r\n  Mr. Jalal Talabani, President of the Republic of \r\nIraq, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Jalal Talabani, President of the Republic of Iraq, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Talabani (spoke in Arabic): Allow me \r\nat the outset to congratulate the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fifth session, and the \r\nfriendly people of Switzerland, on his election. Our \r\ndelegation will cooperate with him to its fullest extent \r\nin the performance of his task. We are confident that \r\nhis experience and wisdom will be important factors in \r\nthe success of the Assembly’s work and in the \r\nachievement of the purposes of the United Nations. I \r\nalso thank his predecessor, my close friend Mr. Ali \r\nAbdussalam Treki, for presiding over the Assembly at \r\nits last session. \r\n The political process in Iraq since the collapse of \r\nthe dictatorial regime in 2003 has resulted in radical \r\npolitical change, as well as in the building of a federal, \r\ndemocratic, independent and united Iraq with respected \r\nconstitutional institutions and a Government elected in \r\naccordance with the Constitution. Achieving that goal \r\n A/65/PV.12\r\n \r\n41 10-54833 \r\n \r\nwas neither easy nor simple. Iraq faced many \r\nchallenges, foremost of which was confronting \r\nextremist, sectarian and factional forces and countering \r\nterrorist groups and groups of the former dictatorial \r\nregime that are attempting to take Iraq back to the dark \r\nera of mass graves and fruitless wars. \r\n Those groups have used various means, including \r\nthe most heinous crimes, and have allied themselves \r\nwith organized crime and transnational terrorist \r\nnetworks in order to destabilize the security situation \r\nin Iraq. The main task of the Government of Iraq was \r\nto provide security throughout the country and to \r\nstrengthen national unity and the rule of law. \r\n There have been significant developments in Iraq \r\nsince I stood before the Assembly last year. This year \r\nand last have witnessed a significant decrease in \r\nviolence and a marked improvement in security in Iraq. \r\nAlthough there were some terrorist acts targeting \r\ninnocent civilians in different places in the country, the \r\noverall security situation has improved, and that paved \r\nthe way for the withdrawal of United States combat \r\nforces operating in Iraq. The complete pullout of those \r\nforces on 31 August 2010 was based on the Agreement \r\nBetween the United States of America and the \r\nRepublic of Iraq On the Withdrawal of United States \r\nForces from Iraq and the Organization of Their \r\nActivities during Their Temporary Presence in Iraq, \r\nsigned by both parties on 17 November 2008. \r\n This year has also seen successful legislative \r\nelections, which were held on 7 March with \r\nconsiderable Arab, regional and international interest. \r\nThe United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq and the \r\nobservers from the Organization of the Islamic \r\nConference, the League of Arab States, the \r\ninternational community and civil society organizations \r\nall expressed their belief that the elections were \r\ntransparent, free and fair. \r\n The principal political parties have been in \r\ncontinuous communication with the aim of holding a \r\nfruitful session of the newly elected Iraqi Council of \r\nRepresentatives to elect a Speaker for the new \r\nparliament and the President of the Republic of Iraq, \r\nafter which, according to the provisions of the Iraqi \r\nConstitution, the elected President will ask a new \r\nPrime Minister to form a Government. It is our hope \r\nthat that new Government will be formed as soon as \r\npossible, as any delay will negatively affect the \r\nsecurity situation, reconstruction and prosperity. \r\n The improved security situation in Iraq has \r\nencouraged many Arab and other countries to reopen \r\ntheir diplomatic missions and has helped to develop \r\nIraqi relations regionally and internationally. The \r\nappointment of new Iraqi ambassadors to various \r\ncountries around the world has also helped to promote \r\nand broaden the horizons of those relations. Iraq’s \r\nassuming the presidency of the current session of the \r\nArab League and of the Arab Summit Conference in \r\nMarch of next year will promote Iraq’s regional role \r\nand will be considered an important step in its efforts \r\nto regain its global standing as an effective and \r\nresponsible member of the international community. \r\nThe Government of Iraq will continue to move in that \r\ndirection through strengthening its friendships, \r\ncooperation and good-neighbourly efforts, thus creating \r\ngreater opportunity for stability and security in the region. \r\n In the development arena, on 4 April 2010 the \r\nGovernment of Iraq initiated a national development \r\nplan for the five-year period from 2010 to 2014. It \r\ncontains around 2,700 strategic projects in various \r\nsectors at a total cost of $186 billion. That plan will \r\nhelp to develop the Iraqi economy and enhance the \r\nquality of services provided to Iraqis. It will also create \r\n4 million jobs, thus helping the unemployment problem \r\nin Iraq. \r\n The national development plan will also help \r\nIraqi refugees return to their homes. The Government \r\nof Iraq believes that the real solution for the problem \r\nof Iraqi refugees and displaced persons lies in their \r\nreturn to their homeland and their residences. Iraq \r\nneeds the experience of all its citizens to help build the \r\ncountry’s future. We therefore call upon countries \r\nhosting Iraqi refugees, international organizations and \r\ncivil society organizations to promote awareness of the \r\nculture of voluntary return. \r\n Iraqi women enjoy important status in the new \r\nfederal and united Iraq and enjoy political rights equal \r\nto those of men. Women have been granted 25 per cent \r\nof the seats in the Iraqi Council of Representatives. \r\nAdditionally, for the first time in many decades, the \r\nwomen of Iraq have assumed many important \r\nministerial positions and have represented their country \r\nas ambassadors, this after having been deprived of \r\nthose rights for more than 30 years. The Constitution \r\nalso guarantees that women grant their nationality to \r\ntheir children. \r\nA/65/PV.12  \r\n \r\n10-54833 42 \r\n \r\n The Constitution formulated the basic principles \r\nof Iraq’s foreign policy, which focuses on observing \r\ngood-neighbourliness and non-interference in the \r\ninternal affairs of other States, the resolution of \r\ndisputes by peaceful means and the establishment of \r\ninternational relations based on shared interests and \r\nrespect for Iraq’s international obligations. On that \r\nbasis, we seek to establish the best relations with \r\nsisterly Arab and Islamic countries and are committed \r\nto the resolutions of the Arab League and the \r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference. \r\n In this spirit we support the Palestinian people’s \r\njust struggle to secure their inalienable rights, \r\nincluding the establishment of a Palestinian State on \r\nthe land of Palestine, as we work to implement the \r\ninternationally legitimate resolutions aimed at \r\nreturning the occupied Arab territories. We consider the \r\nArab Peace Initiative to be a practical step towards \r\nresolving the Arab-Israeli conflict and achieving \r\nsecurity, peace and stability in the Middle East. \r\n We also call for making the Middle East a zone \r\nfree of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass \r\ndestruction, which would enhance the prospects for \r\npeace and security in the region. We call on all States \r\nthat have not yet done so to accede to the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and \r\ncomply with its provisions. \r\n With regard to the Iranian nuclear issue, Iraq \r\nbelieves in the legitimate right of States to use nuclear \r\nenergy for peaceful purposes. That is a right \r\nguaranteed by international conventions, including the \r\nNPT. We stress the importance of reaching a peaceful \r\nsolution to that issue, and that dialogue and quiet \r\ndiplomacy are the most effective ways to achieve that \r\ngoal. Any escalation would harm the interests of all \r\nparties and would endanger regional security. \r\n The most important issue Iraq continues to face is \r\nthe removal of the burden created by Security Council \r\nresolutions adopted against it under Chapter VII of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter. By reviewing those \r\nresolutions, in accordance with Council resolution \r\n1859 (2008) and in response to the report of the \r\nSecretary-General in document S/2009/385, we have \r\nbeen working diligently with our friends and members \r\nof the Council to settle all the outstanding issues \r\nconcerning the situation in Iraq. \r\n At the forefront of those issues are the remaining \r\nrestrictions on Iraq in the field of disarmament, the \r\nconclusion of the remaining contracts under the Oil-\r\nfor-Food programme and finding the right mechanism \r\nfor guaranteeing Iraqi funds following the replacement \r\nof the Development Fund for Iraq and the International \r\nAdvisory and Monitoring Board for Iraq. Iraq would \r\nlike to see those dossiers closed by the end of this year. \r\n The newly elected Iraqi Government will also \r\ndeal with the situation between Iraq and sisterly \r\nKuwait and related issues, such as the maintenance of \r\nborder pillars, compensation and missing Kuwaiti \r\npersons and properties. We will work seriously with \r\nour Kuwaiti brothers, other stakeholders and United \r\nNations organs to reach a settlement that satisfies all \r\nparties without prejudice to our obligations under \r\nSecurity Council resolutions, concerning which we \r\nemphasize our respect and commitment. \r\n The situation in Iraq has changed as a result of \r\nthe important positive developments since the collapse \r\nof the former regime and the end of the dictatorship. It \r\nis drastically different from the situation at the time the \r\nSecurity Council adopted resolution 661 (1990). For \r\nthat reason, and following the adoption of resolution \r\n1859 (2008) and the publication of the report of the \r\nSecretary-General pursuant to paragraph 5 of that \r\nresolution (S/2009/385), we believe that the time is \r\nripe for the Council to act in accordance with the \r\nSecretary-General’s report and the mandate set out in \r\nresolution 1859 (2008). Also, in keeping with its \r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security, it is time for the Council to review \r\nresolutions pertaining specifically to Iraq, beginning \r\nwith resolution 661 (1990), with a view to helping Iraq \r\nachieve the international standing it enjoyed before \r\nthose resolutions were adopted. \r\n The current political process in Iraq aims at \r\nbuilding a federal, democratic, independent and united \r\nIraq, where citizens work within a constitutional \r\nframework that guarantees the rule of law, where \r\nhuman rights are protected and where all segments of \r\nthe Iraqi people are treated with full respect. We have \r\ngreat faith in our ability and potential, as a country rich \r\nin natural and human resources, to achieve those \r\nobjectives. \r\n However, at this important stage in the life of the \r\nIraqi people, we continue to need the political and \r\neconomic support of and cooperation from the \r\ninternational community in order to stand on a firm \r\nfoundation — one that will enable us to advance \r\n A/65/PV.12\r\n \r\n43 10-54833 \r\n \r\ntowards a future in which not only can we promote our \r\ncountry’s and our people’s stability, progress and \r\nprosperity, but also contribute fully as a member of the \r\ninternational community to the achievement of peace, \r\nsecurity and sustainable development for all nations. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Iraq for the statement he \r\nhas just made. \r\n  Mr. Jalal Talabani, President of the Republic of \r\nIraq, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Lieutenant-General Salou Djibo, \r\nPresident of the Supreme Council for Restoration of \r\nDemocracy, Chief of State, President of the Council \r\nof Ministers of the Republic of the Niger \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Supreme Council for Restoration of Democracy, \r\nChief of State and President of the Council of \r\nMinisters of the Republic of the Niger. \r\n  Lieutenant-General Salou Djibo, President of the \r\nSupreme Council for Restoration of Democracy, \r\nChief of State, President of the Council of \r\nMinisters of the Republic of the Niger, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations Lieutenant-General \r\nSalou Djibo, President of the Supreme Council for \r\nRestoration of Democracy, Chief of State and President \r\nof the Council of Ministers of the Republic of the \r\nNiger, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Djibo (spoke in French): At the outset, \r\non behalf of the Republic of the Niger, I would like to \r\nextend to Mr. Joseph Deiss my sincere congratulations \r\non his outstanding election as the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. His \r\ncountry, the Swiss Confederation, is known for its long \r\ntradition in the area of international relations, and his \r\nown career reveals proven skill and a wealth of \r\npersonal experience. Because of that, we believe that \r\nunder his leadership the work of this session will be \r\ncrowned with success. I can assure him of the full \r\nsupport and complete cooperation of my delegation in \r\ncarrying out his noble and lofty mission. \r\n To his predecessor, Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, \r\nrepresentative of the great Socialist People’s Libyan \r\nArab Jamahiriya, I would like to pay particular and \r\nfully merited tribute to him for the exemplary way and \r\nthe talent with which he led the work at the Assembly’s \r\nlast session. \r\n Finally, with consideration and admiration, I \r\ncommend the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, a \r\npromoter of peace, for his tireless investment in the \r\nsearch for the most appropriate solutions to the many \r\nchallenges that assail the world today and cry out daily \r\nto the individual and collective consciences of its \r\nleaders. The particular attention he gives to the \r\nsituation of the most vulnerable countries, his constant \r\nadvocacy for achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals and his recent journey to Africa deserve to be \r\ncommended. \r\n The world will recall that on 18 February 2010, \r\nin the face of an anti-constitutional drift imposed on \r\ndemocratic and republican institutions of my country \r\nby the Government in place, and the grave and certain \r\nrisk of the disintegration of national cohesiveness, the \r\ndefence and security forces of the Niger were obligated \r\nto intervene on the political scene. \r\n This was not the intervention of an army hungry \r\nfor power, but that of officers who were concerned \r\nwith safeguarding the unity and integrity of their \r\ncountry, which had been endangered by the Head of \r\nState at the time, who, through sheer self-interest, had \r\ndecided to ignore, by undertaking a civilian coup \r\nd’état, all of the laws of the Republic, beginning with \r\nthe Constitution itself, which was replaced with \r\nanother that would have generously extended the \r\npresidential mandate for three years, which was to have \r\nended on 22 December 2009. It was therefore for good \r\nreason that our arrival was welcomed by national and \r\ninternational opinion. \r\n Having headed the country since 18 February \r\n2010, the Supreme Council for the Restoration of \r\nDemocracy, over which we have the great honour to \r\npreside, immediately set itself the primary goal of \r\ntaking all decisions necessary to bringing peace to the \r\nsocio-political life of the country. It was precisely to \r\nthat end that it drew up its programme for governing \r\non the basis of three pillars: the restoration of \r\ndemocracy; cleaning up the country’s political and \r\neconomic situation by fighting against impunity, \r\nA/65/PV.12  \r\n \r\n10-54833 44 \r\n \r\ncorruption and bribery; and the reconciliation of the \r\npeople of the Niger. \r\n With a view to restoring a normal constitutional \r\nregime, the National Independent Electoral Commission, \r\nwhich was created to that end, drew up and proposed a \r\nschedule for general elections and a draft budget for \r\norganizing seven planned elections to the Government \r\nand the Supreme Council for the Restoration of \r\nDemocracy, which accepted them after slight \r\nmodifications. According to that timetable, the electoral \r\nprocess will take place from 31 October 2010 to 6 April \r\n2011 and will include a constitutional referendum as well \r\nas local, legislative and presidential elections. \r\n I am pleased to recall here that, by an ordinance \r\nof 11 March 2010, we decided to make ineligible \r\nmembers of the defence and security forces, as well as \r\nmembers of the transitional Government. I should \r\ntherefore like to take this opportunity to make an \r\nurgent appeal to the international community to \r\ncontinue to assist the Niger and its National \r\nIndependent Electoral Commission in the organization \r\nof the programme of elections that I have just \r\nelaborated. This assistance is crucial if we are to \r\nachieve within the established time frame the core goal \r\nof the Supreme Council and the transitional \r\nGovernment of restoring constitutional order in the \r\nNiger, following the outcome of the electoral process. \r\n Moreover, with a view to guaranteeing free, fair, \r\ntransparent and credible elections, the Supreme \r\nCouncil for the Restoration of Democracy and the \r\nGovernment of the Niger, solemnly request through me \r\nthe participation of the United Nations and all \r\ninterested international institutions in observing the \r\nvarious elections. \r\n I was determined to make this trip to New York, \r\ndespite the many urgent needs and constraints \r\nassociated with the transitional agenda under way in \r\nthe Niger, to solemnly reaffirm before this august and \r\nhonourable Assembly that the commitments we made \r\nfollowing the events of 18 February 2010 are now at a \r\nvery advanced stage of implementation and that, God \r\nwilling, they will be upheld within the established time \r\nframe and with international support. In this respect, I \r\nnote and welcome the fact that, in the report he \r\nrepresented to the Security Council on 13 July 2010 \r\n(S/2010/324), the Special Representative of the \r\nSecretary-General for West Africa stressed that the \r\ntransitional authorities in the Niger have fully \r\nrespected their commitments. \r\n In accordance with the second commitment made \r\nby the Supreme Council for the Restoration of \r\nDemocracy, on 11 May 2010 we established a \r\ncommission to combat economic, financial and fiscal \r\ncrime and to promote good governance, which is \r\ncurrently implementing a programme to restore the rule \r\nof law in the Niger. In parallel, a high authority for \r\nreconciliation and consolidation of democracy has been \r\ncreated. This new institution is working with all the \r\nnecessary care to achieve the third goal, which is to \r\nconsolidate our national unity. \r\n Finally, at the international level, since \r\n18 February we have clearly reaffirmed the Niger’s \r\ncommitment to the universal values of peace, security, \r\ngood-neighbourliness, human rights, the rule of law, \r\ndemocracy, international solidarity, strict compliance \r\nwith the Charter of the United Nations, the Charter of \r\nthe African Union, the statutes of the Economic \r\nCommunity of West African States and all other \r\nrelevant international legal instruments. \r\n Poor economic and financial governance and the \r\npolitical and institutional crisis were, unfortunately, not \r\nthe only threats facing the Niger. Sadly, there was \r\nanother scourge that was even more dangerous and \r\ncalled for urgent countermeasures, but whose existence \r\nwas long concealed by the authorities of the time. I \r\nrefer to the very serious situation of food insecurity in \r\nwhich my country finds itself. \r\n On 10 March, an urgent appeal was made to the \r\nentire national and international community for major \r\nsupport to be given to our country in its efforts to \r\naddress this disaster. With the prompt and concrete \r\nsupport of the Niger’s development partners and \r\nthrough the national mechanism for the prevention and \r\nmanagement of food crises, action to mitigate the crisis \r\nhas been diligently undertaken. Of particular note \r\namong these efforts are the cash-for-work operations, \r\nthe sale of reasonably priced grain, the free distribution \r\nof food, seed and livestock feed assistance, and care \r\nfor malnourished children. \r\n I take this opportunity to convey to all our \r\ngenerous donors the profound gratitude of the people \r\nof the Niger, the Supreme Council and the transitional \r\nGovernment for that commendable and unforgettable \r\nshow of solidarity. We hope to see it continue so that \r\nwe can address the emerging situation resulting from \r\n A/65/PV.12\r\n \r\n45 10-54833 \r\n \r\nfloods wreaking havoc in several regions of our \r\ncountry. We are also pleased to see that food security is \r\nhigh on the list of issues on which the General \r\nAssembly will focus during its current session and \r\namong the priorities set for the Organization in 2010 \r\nby the Secretary-General. \r\n At this stage, I welcome the initiative of Under-\r\nSecretary-General John Holmes to come to the Niger \r\nand visit isolated rural areas in order to see for himself \r\nthe desperate situation into which the people and their \r\nlivestock have been plunged. During his visit, he was \r\nable to assess the scale of the crisis and its impact on \r\npeople — in particular on children — and livestock. \r\nThe appeal he made to the international community, \r\nadvocating the mobilization of $130 million to provide \r\nurgent assistance to the populations affected, remains \r\nhighly urgent. We know, however, that we can count on \r\nthe understanding and ongoing concern of our \r\ndevelopment partners, which have already been \r\nreflected in the gradual resumption of their cooperation \r\nwith the Niger. \r\n It is obvious that my country has serious \r\nsocio-economic problems, but the people of the Niger \r\nare determined to overcome them with the support of \r\nthe international community. My country is young. It \r\nhas just celebrated its fiftieth year of independence \r\nwithout fanfare because of the food crisis. Its people \r\nare young, but they are also dynamic and resolved to \r\nbegin their march on the path to development. \r\n This sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly \r\nis taking place in an international context of strong \r\ncontrasts. Indeed, while tangible progress continues to \r\nbe made daily in many areas of concern, we face many \r\nnumerous and varied challenges in many other areas. \r\n In Africa, positive developments have been \r\nrecorded. I welcome the holding of free, transparent and \r\nfair elections, in particular in the Sudan and Burundi. I \r\nwelcome the decision of the authorities of Côte d’Ivoire \r\nto organize presidential elections very soon. It is my hope \r\nthat the electoral process under way will be a success. \r\nIndeed, that is the only way that Côte d’Ivoire will restore \r\nthe stability and calm that will allow it to fully play its \r\nrole as a driving force in West Africa. \r\n Finally, I note that the peace and security \r\narchitecture of our continental organization is being \r\nstrengthened with the support of our partners, such as \r\nthe European Union and the United Nations, in \r\nparticular with imminent operationalization of the \r\nAfrican peace force and the early warning mechanism. \r\nIt is my ardent hope that significant progress shall soon \r\nbe made on the political front in other friendly \r\ncountries, such as the Central African Republic, the \r\nComoros, Somalia and Madagascar, in the Great Lakes \r\nregion and Darfur. \r\n In the Middle East, the launch of direct bilateral \r\nnegotiations should, we hope, lead to comprehensive \r\npeace based on the two-State solution, with an \r\nindependent and viable Palestine living side by side in \r\npeace and security with Israel and other neighbouring \r\ncountries. From this rostrum, I wish full success to the \r\ndirect negotiation process among officials of those two \r\ncountries, sponsored by President Barack Obama of the \r\nUnited States of America. \r\n Other threats to international peace and security \r\ncontinue to confront us on a daily basis. I refer above \r\nall to terrorism, drug trafficking and the proliferation \r\nof small arms and light weapons. West Africa — and in \r\nparticular the Sahelo-Saharan region, of which the \r\nNiger is an integral part — is currently suffering the \r\nbitter nexus of terrorism and trafficking of all types. In \r\nspite of the efforts made, it must be recognized that \r\nnational and regional authorities continue to have \r\ndifficulty neutralizing these armed groups. The \r\nabduction last week of foreign nationals in northern \r\nNiger reminds us of the gravity of the situation and of \r\nthe urgent need for the measures necessary to deal \r\neffectively with this threat to peace, security and \r\ndevelopment in our country. \r\n Indeed, with each passing day, terrorism grows in \r\nscale in our subregion and threatens to tarnish the \r\nimage of the Sahel countries, compromise tourist \r\nrevenues and exacerbate our people’s poverty and \r\ninsecurity. We all know that poverty and desolation are \r\nfertile grounds for terrorists. We must therefore \r\nrecognize the urgent need to promptly strengthen \r\ninternational cooperation and economic and social \r\ndevelopment programmes in these areas in order to \r\neradicate these scourges. The response to all these evils \r\nmust be coordinated. That is why the countries \r\nconcerned created a mechanism to coordinate counter-\r\nterrorism activities following a ministerial meeting \r\nheld in Algiers on 16 March. With respect to drug \r\ntrafficking, the Economic Community of West African \r\nStates has adopted a plan of action to combat it, and \r\nurgently appeals to the international community to \r\nassist in its implementation. \r\nA/65/PV.12  \r\n \r\n10-54833 46 \r\n \r\n It has been widely understood since the 2005 \r\nWorld Summit that peace, security, development and \r\nhuman rights are interdependent and mutually \r\nreinforcing. In other words, peace, security and human \r\nrights cannot be effective in a context of \r\nunderdevelopment and poverty. It is clear that the \r\nSecretary-General fully shares this view because he has \r\nmade sustainable development one of his highest \r\npriorities throughout 2010 through the achievement of \r\ninternationally agreed development goals. In this \r\nrespect, the High-level Plenary Meeting on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), held from 20 \r\nto 22 September, was a real opportunity for the \r\ninternational community to address many subjects of \r\nmajor concern more thoroughly. \r\n As the participants in the High-level Meeting \r\nfirmly highlighted and I would note, there is a clear \r\nlink between the availability of resources and the \r\nachievement of the MDGs. From my point of view, the \r\nachievement of the MDGs remains possible for the \r\nNiger, as I emphasized at the Meeting, but only to the \r\nextent that substantial financial resources are made \r\navailable, in particular through an expanded and \r\nenhanced partnership with the international \r\ncommunity. That is why I appeal for the mobilization \r\nof the resources necessary through compliance with \r\ncommitments made in the Millennium Declaration \r\n(resolution 55/2), the Monterrey Consensus \r\n(A/CONF.198/11), and in the Outcome Document of \r\nthe Doha International Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment (A/CONF.212/L.1/Rev.1*). \r\n The terrible earthquake that struck Haiti with \r\nsuch force on 12 January; the deadly floods that \r\ncontinue to affect Pakistan, India and the People’s \r\nRepublic of China; the terrible droughts and floods in \r\nthe Sahel; and the heatwave in Russia have all made us \r\naware of our collective vulnerability to natural \r\ndisasters and their underlying causes, such as \r\nenvironmental degradation and climate change. \r\n In this respect, as highlighted by the participants \r\nat the 20 September high-level meeting on the \r\nInternational Year of Biodiversity, the protection of the \r\nenvironment should be everyone’s priority. It is \r\nnecessary to follow up on the voluntary commitments \r\nmade in the Copenhagen Declaration, in particular with \r\nrespect to financing adaptation and mitigation \r\nmeasures. \r\n With respect to United Nations reform, it is \r\nencouraging to note the significant progress made in \r\nthe empowerment of women, governance and financing \r\nactivities to operationalize development. Let us not \r\nforget that, on 30 June, the General Assembly \r\nestablished the composite Entity for Gender Equality \r\nand the Empowerment of Women, which, as of \r\n1 January 2011, will be responsible for addressing \r\ngender issues in place of the four institutions that have \r\nhitherto worked to promote gender equality and the \r\nempowerment of women. This is an important act \r\nwhich we dare to hope will lead Member States to \r\nadvance in other sectors of United Nations reform, in \r\nparticular reform of the Security Council. \r\n I am convinced that this will strengthen the \r\nOrganization’s legitimacy and capacity for action in the \r\nservice of international peace and security. Indeed, if it \r\nis to be up to this immense and delicate task, the \r\nUnited Nations must be just, representative and \r\ndemocratic. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Supreme Council for the Restoration \r\nof Democracy, Chief of State, President of the Council \r\nof Ministers of the Republic of the Niger for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n  Lieutenant-General Salou Djibo, President of the \r\nSupreme Council for the Restoration of \r\nDemocracy, Chief of State, President of the \r\nCouncil of Ministers of the Republic of the Niger, \r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Steven Vanackere, Deputy Prime \r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and \r\nInstitutional Reform of Belgium. \r\n Mr. Vanackere (Belgium) (spoke in French): \r\nHistory has shown us that words can change the face of \r\nthe world. It has proven that the spoken word can \r\ninfluence the future, but only when they go beyond \r\nrhetoric. What is our global governance worth if it does \r\nnot go beyond the expression of ambitions and \r\nintentions? Words remain ineffectual if they are not \r\nfollowed up with action. We must therefore act. I say \r\n“we”, the nations united, because no country, no matter \r\n A/65/PV.12\r\n \r\n47 10-54833 \r\n \r\nhow large, can respond alone to the great challenges \r\nfacing humanity. I say “we” because no large-scale \r\nproblem is limited to a single country, leaving \r\nuntouched the lives of those who live elsewhere. The \r\nobligation to act is a shared, global responsibility. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n That is why today my message is about \r\nresponsibility and increased accountability. \r\n At the heart of any form of governance lies \r\nresponsibility, be it global or local, national or \r\ninternational. But this is not enough. Indeed, \r\ngovernance is not only about behaving responsibly; it \r\nis also about being accountable. This applies not only \r\nat the level of the single State, but also at the level of \r\nour United Nations. \r\n Human rights, security and development are at \r\nthe core of the mandate of the United Nations. Former \r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan pointed out the fact that \r\nthe three are inextricably linked when he said: \r\n “There will be no development without security \r\nand no security without development. And both \r\ndevelopment and security also depend on respect \r\nfor human rights and the rule of law.” \r\n(A/59/2005, annex, para. 2) \r\nIt has indeed become common knowledge that human \r\nrights are unlikely to be protected in an insecure and \r\nunderdeveloped environment and that economic \r\ndevelopment cannot be durably sustained in a society \r\nwhere there is no rule of law. \r\n Accountability in international affairs is about \r\nrespecting international law — the rules that govern \r\nrelations among States. Without a solid legal basis, \r\ninternational cooperation remains optional and falls \r\nshort of the necessary transparency and long-term \r\nsustainability. Important steps have been taken to \r\nuphold the rule of law at the international level over \r\nthe past decades. \r\n Belgium pleads for the universal acceptance of \r\nthe competence of the International Court of Justice \r\nand the International Criminal Court. If all countries \r\nwere willing to follow up on this appeal, we would be \r\na step closer to having an effective and accountable \r\ninternational system. \r\n Meeting our responsibilities in the field of human \r\nrights means ensuring efficient means and mechanisms \r\nto ensure their protection. We need to instil more \r\ncoherence to our action. Unfortunately, today we focus \r\nour attention all too often on how to react to human \r\nrights violations while we should focus more on \r\nprevention and on the root causes of those violations. \r\n Human rights are universal. My country strongly \r\nopposes any form of relativism in this respect. \r\n International and regional human rights \r\ninstruments need to be strengthened. The evaluation \r\nwithin the Human Rights Council in 2011 should give \r\nimportant momentum to that strengthening. \r\n There is also a need for increased accountability \r\nin the field of security, another pillar of the United \r\nNations. Over the past year, important progress has \r\nbeen made. The Review Conference of the Parties to \r\nthe Non-Proliferation Treaty came to a substantial and \r\nbalanced result. Respect for Non-Proliferation Treaty \r\nprovisions and cooperation with the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency are accountability in practice. \r\nUnfortunately, the non-acceptance or non-respect of \r\nthese provisions by countries like North Korea and Iran \r\nthreatens the international non-proliferation regime. \r\n In particular, Belgium welcomes the entry into \r\nforce earlier this year of the Convention on Cluster \r\nMunitions. The prohibition of the production and use \r\nof cluster munitions has become the international \r\nstandard. I am pleased and proud to announce that \r\nBelgium has recently destroyed its entire stock of \r\ncluster munitions. \r\n The Millennium Development Goals and climate \r\nnegotiations are at the top of our twenty-first century \r\nagenda, and rightly so. We are all responsible for our \r\nplanet. In fact, we are all accountable to current and \r\nfuture generations, especially in the field of poverty \r\nreduction and environmental protection. Let us not \r\nforget the ancient Native American saying: “We do not \r\ninherit the Earth from our ancestors; we borrow it from \r\nour children”. \r\n Creating a world that is equitable, a world that \r\nwill last, is our common responsibility. Belgium is \r\ndoing so by spending 0.7 per cent of its gross domestic \r\nproduct on development cooperation. \r\n If we indeed accept the need to be accountable \r\nfor the results we do or do not obtain, we should have \r\nthe courage to evaluate and adapt the institutions and \r\ninstruments at our disposal. In that respect, Belgium \r\nfully supports the efforts of the European Union to \r\nA/65/PV.12  \r\n \r\n10-54833 48 \r\n \r\nparticipate in a timely and effective manner in the work \r\nof the General Assembly. \r\n If it is to contribute effectively to global \r\ngovernance and to take up its global responsibility, the \r\nUnited Nations needs to continue its efforts to become \r\nmore representative and more efficient. The creation of \r\nUN Women was a welcome development, and it has \r\nmy country’s full support. Of course, gender will need \r\nto remain a mainstream theme influencing the actions \r\nof each and every United Nations institution. \r\n Important discussions on the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council have been ongoing for quite some \r\ntime. Belgium hopes that the negotiations will soon \r\nlead to concrete results. \r\n I have talked about institutions, and concerns \r\nabout institutions are, of course, legitimate. But they \r\nshould never lead us to forget that the first \r\naccountability of humankind is not created by \r\nabstractions or institutions, but by the face of a person \r\nin dire need; of the man, woman or child who is the \r\nvictim of violence; of those who suffer the violence of \r\nnature, or from violence perpetrated by other men. \r\n When it comes to humanitarian protection and \r\naid, responsibility and accountability have never been \r\nmore necessary. That is why United Nations \r\npeacekeeping missions with strong mandates, \r\nespecially in the field of the protection of civilians, are \r\nimportant and should be given the necessary \r\ninstruments, not least in the context of the fight against \r\nsexual violence. In this context, Belgium strongly \r\nsupports Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) and \r\nits goals of ensuring the participation, protection and \r\npromotion of women in peace and security. \r\n The concept of sovereignty cannot be used as a \r\njustification for human rights violations against the \r\ncitizens of any country. On the contrary, sovereignty \r\nimplies the responsibility to protect, and we support \r\nthe efforts of the Secretary-General to further put this \r\nprinciple into practice. \r\n My key message of increased responsibility and \r\naccountability also applies to certain situations in the \r\nworld that I would like to address briefly: the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Afghanistan and \r\nPakistan. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n The fiftieth anniversary of the independence of \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo has been an \r\nopportunity to measure the unquestionable progress \r\nmade over recent years. What is important as we move \r\nforward is the consolidation of peace and democracy in \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo. Belgium is \r\npleased that the mandate of the United Nations \r\nOrganization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo has incorporated the element of \r\npeacebuilding alongside that of peacekeeping. \r\n The elections in 2006 allowed the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo to choose the path of \r\ndemocratization. The Congolese authorities have \r\nexpressed their determination to persevere on this path \r\nin confirming their intention to hold elections in 2011. \r\nThat deserves our full support. \r\n Despite all this progress, it is clear that many \r\nchallenges remain. In spite of the rapprochement \r\namong its neighbours, the situation in the East of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo remains worrisome. \r\nWe were reminded of this by the shocking reports of \r\nwidespread rape in Luvungi. \r\n The fight against impunity, which is crucial to my \r\ncountry, hinges first and foremost on the strengthening \r\nof the rule of law. It is one of the primary \r\nresponsibilities of the authorities, but here, too, the \r\nsupport of the United Nations and the international \r\ncommunity is crucial. Belgium calls on the \r\ninternational community to continue to assume its \r\nresponsibility. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n Like in every country, the Afghan Government is \r\nheld accountable by the Afghan people. We hope that \r\nlast weekend’s elections contributed to this. However, \r\nthe Afghan authorities do not stand alone. The \r\ninternational community, with a central role for the \r\nUnited Nations, assists the Afghan Government in \r\nenhancing the level of accountability to its population. \r\nGradually, the Afghan authorities need to take on more \r\nresponsibility, especially in the field of security. This \r\ntransfer is welcome, but rather than being calendar-\r\ndriven, it should be results-driven. \r\n The Belgian Government has decided to extend \r\nits current military and civilian presence until the end \r\nof 2011. We believe that 2011 will be of crucial \r\nimportance in transferring further security \r\n A/65/PV.12\r\n \r\n49 10-54833 \r\n \r\nresponsibilities. The focus of the Belgian presence \r\nbeyond 2011 will therefore likely be more and more on \r\ncivilian assistance. \r\n Nobody can remain untouched by the devastation \r\nand human suffering caused by the floods in Pakistan. \r\nAs members of the international community, we have \r\nto take on our responsibility. This “slow-motion \r\ntsunami”, as the Secretary-General called it, demands a \r\nlong-term and strategic answer. Belgium therefore \r\nwelcomes the three-step approach — the meeting last \r\nSunday in New York, the meeting in Brussels next \r\nmonth of the Friends of Democratic Pakistan, and the \r\ndonor event in November — which clearly sets out the \r\nframework for reconstruction. \r\n We have to move beyond the stage of emergency \r\naid. In this respect, I am glad to say that the European \r\nUnion last week took the firm commitment to improve \r\nmarket access for Pakistan as a concrete measure to \r\nreinvigorate Pakistan’s economy. \r\n Allow me to conclude by recalling John F. \r\nKennedy’s observation that the only reward for a \r\npolitician is a good conscience. It may be true that not \r\nmany other rewards should be expected for politicians. \r\nBut even so, the conscience of a politician cannot free \r\nhim from the obligation of being accountable to those \r\nhe wants to serve, to the people he wants to represent \r\nand to the country he wants to lead. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Jean-Marie Ehouzou, Special \r\nEnvoy of the Republic of Benin. \r\n Mr. Ehouzou (Benin) (spoke in French): I bring \r\na message on behalf of the President of the Republic of \r\nBenin, His Excellency Mr. Boni Yayi, who was not \r\nable to come to New York because of scheduling \r\nconflicts. He shares the ambition of the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at the sixty-fifth session to build a \r\nUnited Nations that is strong, inclusive and open as a \r\nguarantor of global governance. I am convinced that \r\nthe productive experience of the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at the head of the Swiss \r\nGovernment, which enabled his beautiful country to \r\nenter the United Nations, will be a valuable asset to us. \r\nFrom this perspective, Benin will make its contribution \r\nto the work of this session and, in so doing, will strive \r\nto promote the ideals of the Charter, to which my \r\ncountry reiterates here its full support. \r\n I would also like to express to Mr. Deiss my \r\nwarm congratulations on his election as President of \r\nthe General Assembly at the sixty-fifth session. His \r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Ali Treki, who \r\nbrilliantly led the work of the General Assembly with \r\nrespect to Africa, strove to find appropriate solutions to \r\nthe great challenges facing humankind with skill and \r\ntact throughout his mandate. We pay tribute to him for \r\nhis good and loyal service to the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n I would also like to welcome the courageous and \r\ndetermined action of His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, and commend \r\nhim for having taken the measure of the grave crises \r\naffecting the world and for his ongoing commitment to \r\nthe achievement of the Millennium Development Goals \r\nby 2015. Thanks to his bold initiatives to promote \r\ninternational cooperation, he has been able to revive \r\nthe virtues of multilateralism as the optimum way to \r\nmanage world affairs in an inclusive and participatory \r\nframework that stresses the uniqueness of our world \r\nand the common responsibility of human beings to \r\nmaintain the fundamental balances on which human \r\nsurvival on Earth depends and the sustainability of the \r\nbiosphere. \r\n The trail blazed by the founding fathers of the \r\nUnited Nations in the areas of international peace and \r\nsecurity, the promotion of human rights and \r\ndevelopment is that of dialogue, cooperation and a \r\nglobal partnership to promote the common good of \r\nhumankind. \r\n The raison d’être of the United Nations is not \r\nonly to provide a framework of reference and universal \r\nconvergence to coordinate national policies, but also \r\nand above all to address interests with respect to the \r\nparameters that define areas of tension between \r\naspirations and the demands of our peoples and States \r\nin all their diversity. \r\n If the United Nations did not exist it would have \r\nto be created, because we cannot imagine a world \r\ntoday without the United Nations. I would therefore \r\nlike to express Benin’s commitment to the \r\nirreplaceable role of the United Nations and its funds, \r\nagencies, programmes and various specialized \r\ninstitutions, which provide an invaluable service to \r\nhumankind as a secular extension of our collective \r\nconscience. \r\nA/65/PV.12  \r\n \r\n10-54833 50 \r\n \r\n The High-level Plenary Meeting on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) convened by \r\nthe Secretary-General defined a programme of action \r\nto achieve the Goals by 2015. In implementing these \r\nmeasures, it is important to take continuously into \r\naccount the deadlines set for the achievement of the \r\nMDGs in the light of the additional difficulties related \r\nto the current crises of the financial and economic \r\nsystem and to previous crises. \r\n It is the duty of the international community to \r\nmobilize the resources necessary to address the grave \r\ndistortions that caused these crises. Vulnerable \r\ncountries must make investments to relaunch \r\nsustainable agricultural production and maintain \r\nsustained growth capable of generating long-term \r\nprosperity and sustainable human development, \r\nbecause the achievements of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals must be guaranteed in perpetuity. \r\n The United Nations must now, and with a sense \r\nof urgency, use its full influence to provide the means \r\nto help countries in difficulty ensure the survival of \r\nthreatened populations and vulnerable groups that \r\ncould be decimated by famine and disease if nothing is \r\ndone to help them. The time has come to give \r\nsubstance to the right to food because it is \r\nunacceptable that hunger should persist among the \r\ncauses of human suffering in the twenty-first century. \r\nIn the short term, priority focus should be on \r\nstrengthening social protection systems in low-income \r\ncountries and on reactivating dormant local production \r\ncapacity by promoting small and medium-sized \r\nagricultural businesses in order to avoid a drastic \r\nincrease in the number of people living in extreme \r\npoverty. \r\n In the medium and long terms, it is necessary to \r\nrethink policies to promote investments in agriculture \r\nin order to re-establish the balance between cash crops \r\nand food products and thus ensure food security in \r\ncountries, taking their cultural specificities into \r\naccount. \r\n The international community must begin to \r\nevaluate the effectiveness of its strategic monitoring \r\nmechanisms in order to strengthen their ability to \r\nforesee systemic shocks. What is predictable should be \r\npredicted in order to define a long-term approach and \r\nto build, on the basis of available scientific data, a \r\ndesirable future for our countries and peoples, who \r\nmust cooperate to that end. \r\n In this respect, the proposal to increase the \r\nagricultural share of official development assistance from \r\n3 per cent to 10 per cent is a strategic approach that \r\nshould be implemented with common political will \r\ncommensurate to the challenge. Here, I pay tribute to \r\ncountries that have already made concrete commitments \r\nto providing additional resources to that end. \r\n Benin is an agricultural country, and agriculture \r\nmust serve as a springboard for its development. In that \r\nregard, the Government of Benin is working to promote \r\nsynergistic growth and the fight against poverty in order \r\nto align democracy and new-found freedoms with shared \r\nprosperity by carrying out the social transformations \r\nnecessary to ensure the effective participation of all \r\nsectors in national development efforts. \r\n The Government of Benin is working to promote \r\nagricultural mechanization, but given that the latter \r\ncannot have the desired impact without water \r\nmanagement, we are also planning for rational \r\nmanagement of that resource in order to maximize its \r\nuse and ensure its sustainability. These investments \r\nwill allow us to make the work of farmers less difficult \r\nand to limit post-harvest losses in order to ensure that \r\nagricultural production covers national needs and \r\ngenerates surplus for export. \r\n In the framework of efforts to diversify \r\nagricultural production, the Government of Benin is \r\nalso working to promote crops for marginal farming \r\nland to produce biofuel. The goal is to reduce \r\ndependence on and the rising cost of hydrocarbons, \r\nwhich have been exacerbated by the drastic drop in \r\nhydroelectric power caused by climate change, which \r\nhas also seriously affected the country’s economic \r\nactivity in recent years. \r\n West Africa has been deeply affected by soil \r\ndegradation, coastal erosion and the effects of frequent \r\nfloods due to climate change. Here, we express our \r\nappreciation for the awareness-raising undertaken by \r\nthe secretariat of the United Nations Convention to \r\nCombat Desertification. It is important to devote more \r\nresources to implementing the Convention in the \r\nframework of fighting climate change. \r\n Adaptation and mitigation measures should be \r\nimplemented with a sense of heightened urgency in \r\norder to help regions affected. Financial and \r\ndevelopment institutions should pay special attention \r\nto programmes to revitalize soil and to promote \r\nirrigation farming and reforestation, using species that \r\n A/65/PV.12\r\n \r\n51 10-54833 \r\n \r\ncan increase food availability. We reaffirm our \r\nsympathy for countries that have been struck this year \r\nby natural disasters, in particular earthquakes, and \r\nHaiti in particular, with which we share close lineage \r\nand cultural ties. \r\n My country, Benin, will hold presidential and \r\nlegislative elections in March 2011. After 20 years of \r\ndemocracy during which elections have been organized \r\non the basis of manually recorded lists, my country’s \r\nGovernment, in collaboration with the United Nations \r\nand its development partners, has finally decided to \r\ncreate a computerized permanent electoral list that will \r\nensure transparent elections and significantly reduce \r\ncomplaints and other post-electoral difficulties. The \r\npolitical class of Benin agrees unanimously on the \r\nneed for such a computerized list, but differences \r\nremain with respect to the process, the timing of its \r\nimplementation and its use for the presidential and \r\nlegislative elections in March 2011. \r\n I am confident that, through dialogue and Benin’s \r\ncreative genius, which ensured the outstanding success \r\nof the national conference of political stakeholders in \r\nFebruary 1990, Benin will be able to meet this \r\nchallenge and once again surprise the world. I call on \r\nthe United Nations and the international community to \r\ncontinue to support the efforts of the Government of \r\nBenin to work successfully to address the major \r\nchallenges of today and the future. \r\n We must maintain international peace and \r\nsecurity. This is the first of the major tasks assigned to \r\nthe United Nations. In spite of the tireless efforts of the \r\nOrganization alongside regional organizations, \r\nhumankind continues to suffer as a result of ongoing \r\narmed conflicts, the destructiveness of which leads to \r\nunimaginable suffering for affected populations. \r\n Terrorism, which we condemn without \r\nreservation in all its forms and manifestations, also \r\ncontinues to indiscriminately afflict innocent civilian \r\npopulations, including humanitarian workers and \r\nUnited Nations personnel despite the specific \r\ninternational protection they enjoy. \r\n We are concerned by these serious infringements \r\nof the humanitarian principles relevant to conflict \r\nsituations. We must work to strengthen the authority of \r\ninternational humanitarian law and the multilateral \r\ninternational justice institutions in order to increase \r\ntheir deterrence capacity with respect to serious crimes. \r\n Here my country reiterates the importance it \r\nassigns to the responsibility to protect, and we will \r\nspare no effort to ensure its operationalization in \r\naccordance with the fundamental principles of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. \r\n We appeal to all peoples and to all citizens of the \r\nworld to respect the value of human life and to work in \r\na spirit of peaceful coexistence and good-neighbourliness \r\nto resolve their disputes through cooperation, exchange \r\nand seeking mutual understanding, promoting a culture of \r\npeace and dialogue among religions for the common good \r\nof all humankind, at peace with itself. \r\n To this end, we must pay greater attention to \r\nefforts to eradicate the underlying causes of conflict \r\nand in particular to put an end to the illicit trade in \r\nsmall arms and light weapons that leads to their \r\nproliferation and thus to lawlessness and insecurity in \r\nour towns and countryside. \r\n Respect for human rights and civil liberties \r\nmeans that human beings must be placed at the centre \r\nof sustainable development efforts, and it is the duty of \r\nthe international community to ensure this. It is \r\nessential that respecting human rights become a way of \r\nlife and the essential standard that validates human \r\nbehaviour on a daily basis so as to promote mutual \r\nrespect, equal opportunities in life and the full \r\nrealization of the potential of every individual. \r\n In this context, I would like to highlight the \r\nimportant role young people and women have to play \r\nin the development of our countries. In declaring the \r\nyear that began 12 August 2010 as the International \r\nYear of Youth, the General Assembly highlighted the \r\ncontribution that young people make to society. We \r\nurge all Member States to give concrete substance to \r\nthe International Year of Youth, in line with the \r\nsituation in their countries. \r\n The theme of the Year, “Dialogue and Mutual \r\nUnderstanding”, aims, moreover, to foster alliances \r\namong the generations. The Government of Benin is \r\ndetermined to make its modest contribution by \r\nsupporting the effective holding of the United Nations \r\nConference on Youth, which is currently being \r\nprepared, to mark the Year. \r\n With a view to ensuring that the potential of \r\nwomen, who represent more than half of the population \r\nof my country, is fully realized, the Government has set \r\nup a National Institute for the Promotion of Women. A \r\nA/65/PV.12  \r\n \r\n10-54833 52 \r\n \r\nmicrocredit programme for the poorest women was also \r\nlaunched to ensure the promotion of their economic \r\nactivities. To date, this programme has helped to \r\nempower almost 600,000 women by providing income-\r\ngenerating activities. The programme should be \r\nexpanded, which will require additional financial support \r\nfrom the international community and, in particular, from \r\ntechnical and financial partners. \r\n Promoting the rule of law at the international \r\nlevel requires the effective participation of all peoples \r\nin the management of world affairs in the interest of \r\ncurrent and future generations. In particular, the \r\nrepresentation of developing countries should be \r\nstrengthened in the decision-making bodies of the \r\ninternational financial institutions, as should their \r\naccountability. Their institutional mandates should be \r\nredefined so that they better help to mobilize resources \r\nin support of the development of the least developed \r\ncountries, while ensuring the stability of the \r\ninternational financial system. \r\n The Security Council is an essential instrument \r\nfor global governance. Its long-awaited reform cannot \r\nbe postponed indefinitely. Reform efforts are being \r\nheld hostage by the inherent contradictions in today’s \r\ninternational relations and remain hopelessly at a \r\nstandstill despite the crucial importance we all \r\nrecognize them to have for the effectiveness of the \r\nOrganization. The ongoing negotiations towards reform \r\nmust be carried out in good faith and with a keen sense \r\nof responsibility in order to preserve the credibility of \r\nthe Organization, which has been beset by heavy \r\nliabilities. \r\n Let us avoid trite formulations that evade the very \r\nessence of reform, which is to ensure the equitable \r\nrepresentation of States in both categories of membership \r\nand to guarantee that the Council’s decisions have the \r\ntransparency, legitimacy and authority necessary for it \r\nmore effectively to uphold its primary responsibility for \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. \r\n In this respect, Benin reaffirms, from this \r\nrostrum, Africa’s legitimate aspirations. The \r\ndemocratization of the United Nations also means a \r\nstronger commitment to respect for national and \r\ninternational law on the part of Member States. \r\n Here Benin renews its firm commitment to \r\ncontinuing to contribute to the ongoing adaptation \r\nefforts of the Organization, which is solidly anchored \r\nin its main principles of the sovereign equality of \r\nStates, respect for human dignity, the promotion of \r\ndevelopment cooperation and the search for the best \r\nsolutions to the world’s problems. \r\n In this spirit, I should like to conclude by making \r\nan urgent appeal for the strengthening of international \r\ncooperation. International cooperation is neither a form \r\nof social assistance nor an organized hybrid system of \r\nbegging and deception. It should be based on \r\nlegitimate mutual interests — a joint effort towards a \r\ncontract of solidarity, which would enable us together \r\nto attain the means to forge conditions for humanity to \r\nlive in greater dignity and with ever-greater creativity. \r\nThis is the thought that inspires us in this year when \r\nwe celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the \r\nindependence of 17 African countries. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): We \r\nhave heard the last speaker in the general debate for \r\nthis meeting. \r\n Two representatives have asked to speak in \r\nexercise of the right of reply. May I remind members \r\nthat statements made in exercise of the right of reply \r\nare limited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and \r\n5 minutes for the second and should be made by \r\ndelegations from their seats. \r\n Mr. Salsabili (Islamic Republic of Iran): This \r\nevening, the delegation of Belgium made baseless \r\nallegations against the peaceful Iranian nuclear \r\nprogramme by considering it as a threat to the \r\ninternational non-proliferation regime. In this regard \r\nand in exercise of right of reply, I should like to state \r\nthe following. \r\n First, these allegations are without any foundation. \r\nIran’s nuclear activities are and always have been for \r\npeaceful purposes, and the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (IAEA) has repeatedly confirmed the peaceful \r\nnature of Iran’s nuclear programme. \r\n Secondly, according to the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), the \r\ndevelopment of peaceful nuclear energy is an \r\ninalienable right of every Member State, and my \r\ncountry is no exception in this regard. In exercising \r\nthis right, Iran takes its responsibilities seriously. Our \r\ncommitment to non-proliferation remains intact. \r\n And, finally, unwarranted focus on the peaceful, \r\nsafeguarded nuclear facilities of the Islamic Republic \r\nof Iran, rather than addressing the existing proliferation \r\nthreat posed by the secret, non-safeguarded nuclear-\r\n A/65/PV.12\r\n \r\n53 10-54833 \r\n \r\nweapon installations of the Zionist regime, is \r\ncounterproductive and constitutes a dangerous \r\ndistraction. We urge Belgium to refrain from turning a \r\nblind eye to that genuine proliferation threat and, in \r\nthis context, to abandon its inconsistent approach to \r\nnon-proliferation. \r\n Mr. Grauls (Belgium): I would like to remind the \r\nrepresentative of Iran that Belgium, as a member of the \r\nEuropean Union, fully adheres to the position \r\nrepeatedly expressed by the European Union with \r\nregard to the Iranian nuclear issue. \r\n The meeting rose at 3.10 p.m. \r\n"
