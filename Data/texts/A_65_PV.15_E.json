(Switzerland) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 3.25 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAddress by Ms. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, President of \r\nthe Republic of Liberia \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nRepublic of Liberia. \r\n  Ms. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, President of the \r\nRepublic of Liberia, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations Her Excellency Ms. Ellen Johnson-\r\nSirleaf, President of the Republic of Liberia, and to \r\ninvite her to address the Assembly. \r\n President Johnson-Sirleaf: I am honoured to \r\naddress this sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly \r\non behalf of the people of Liberia. I congratulate you, \r\nMr. President, on your election to lead this Assembly \r\nand am convinced that you will bring to the office your \r\nwealth of experience as a former President and Foreign \r\nMinister of the Swiss Confederation. \r\n Let me express appreciation to your predecessor, \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, for the \r\ncapable manner in which he conducted the affairs of \r\nthe sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly. \r\n Allow me also to extend highest commendation \r\nto Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his unwavering \r\ncommitment to the Organization and his efficient \r\nmanagement of its affairs.  \r\n I wish to congratulate President Jacob Zuma and \r\nthe Government and people of South Africa on having \r\nsuccessfully hosted the 2010 World Cup for the first \r\ntime on our African continent. They made Africa \r\nproud, and we in turn are proud of them. \r\n Some four years ago, I stood at this rostrum and \r\ntold the story of a country exhibiting the symptoms of \r\ntwo decades of self-destruction: a criminalized and \r\ncollapsed economy, a suffocating external debt overhang, \r\ndysfunctional institutions, destroyed infrastructure, a \r\npariah nation in a state of decay, and a people in a state \r\nof despair. All of this translated into hundreds of \r\nthousands in refugee camps, equal numbers of the \r\ntalented in the diaspora, and thousands of women, \r\nyoung people and children struggling for survival. \r\n Today, I stand here to report on the progress that \r\ncan be made from the collective effort of a resilient \r\npeople, a responsive partnership, and effective \r\nleadership. We have come to report with confidence \r\nthat Liberia is well on the way to recovery. In less than \r\nfive years, our economy has experienced an average \r\nannual growth rate of 6.5 per cent, despite the drag on \r\nthe two-digit potential occasioned by the 2009 global \r\neconomic crisis. \r\n I can say with pride that, having successfully \r\ncarried out the reforms required under the Heavily \r\nIndebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative, on \r\n17 September, at the Paris Club, the final segment of \r\nLiberia’s $4.9-billion external debt was written off the \r\nbooks. I can report that we have opened the economy \r\nto put the private sector at the centre of our \r\nA/65/PV.15  \r\n \r\n10-54965 2 \r\n \r\ndevelopment effort and thereby have attracted some \r\n$16 billion in private investment in the reactivation of \r\nour mining, agriculture and forestry sectors. In \r\naddition, a new potential was recently discovered in oil \r\nexploration. \r\n The results of reform in our security sector, \r\nenhanced by the continued deployment of the United \r\nNations peacekeeping force, have stabilized the \r\nsecurity situation in the country, where people move \r\nfreely around. Experience in this regard shows that \r\npeacekeeping and peacebuilding can and should take \r\nplace concurrently, and we are pleased that Liberia is \r\nnow formally placed on the agenda of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission to enable us to chart the \r\nway for a smooth transition from peacekeeping and \r\npeacebuilding to recovery. \r\n Moreover, we have encouraged a vibrant \r\nenvironment in which people have exercised their \r\ninalienable rights to free expression, association, \r\nreligion and access to the press without hindrance. \r\nNobody has been molested on account of views \r\nexpressed. Liberia has no prisoners of conscience in \r\ndetention, nor does anyone have cause to flee in fear \r\nfor their life or safety on account of their political \r\nbeliefs or association. \r\n Thus, in promoting a liberal environment in \r\nwhich freedom, equity and equality are exercised as the \r\nbest guarantees of peace, security and stability, we can \r\nboast of being counted among the Governments that \r\nhave demonstrated commitment to good governance \r\nand proven respect for human rights. \r\n Regionally, Liberia continues to demonstrate its \r\ncommitment to good-neighbourliness, peaceful \r\ncoexistence and respect for the sovereign integrity of \r\nother nations. We actively participate in subregional \r\nand regional affairs through the African Union, the \r\nEconomic Community of West African States, the \r\nCommunity of Sahel-Saharan States, and the Mano \r\nRiver Union. The Mano River Union is currently under \r\nLiberia’s chairmanship, and this has allowed us to stay \r\nengaged with our members, Guinea and Côte d’Ivoire, \r\nas they embark upon their political transitions. \r\n We hail the recent breakthrough by President \r\nBarack Obama in bringing the Palestinians and Israelis \r\nback to the negotiating table and holding their leaders \r\nto their words to fulfil their promise to remain engaged \r\nand conduct direct talks aimed at ending that long-\r\nrunning crisis. \r\n Because we live in a global village, a continued \r\ncrisis in any Member State or region should warrant \r\nour concern. Moreover, an unending crisis contradicts \r\nthe cardinal objective of the United Nations, which is \r\nthe promotion of international peace and security. In \r\nthat regard, we suggest that the situation in Somalia \r\nwarrants a Chapter VII intervention. In a country that \r\nhas gone many years without a stable constitutional \r\nGovernment, the presence of pirates, extremists and \r\nother terrorist elements there should sound the alarm. \r\nThe world needs to act promptly, as we cannot afford \r\nto see Somalia remain a haven for anarchists and \r\nextremists. \r\n That is why our Government supports the role of \r\nthe African Union in fielding troops in Somalia. We \r\ncall for more troop deployment from other countries, \r\nand we strongly support action to put an end to the \r\nSomali quagmire. We also call on the Somalis \r\nthemselves to accept dialogue and go to the negotiating \r\ntable to thrash out their differences and restore their \r\ncountry to rightful peace and dignity. While we \r\nacknowledge the right of States to self-defence and the \r\npromotion of programmes in support of national \r\ninterests, we call on them to do so responsibly, with \r\nrespect for international public opinion and the \r\nprotocols and conventions surrounding such \r\ndevelopments. \r\n At this week’s Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) summit, we reaffirmed Liberia’s commitment \r\nto continuing to work for the achievement of all eight \r\nGoals, although we are implementing those Goals \r\nunder a more challenging context. Our national \r\ndevelopment agenda and programmes for ensuring \r\nnational reconciliation, good governance and the rule \r\nof law, national security, food security, and the \r\nimplementation of our poverty reduction strategy are \r\nconsistent with the objectives of the MDGs. Our \r\nprogress bears the fruits of this commitment. \r\n We are pleased to note the progress the world has \r\nmade in the advancement of women. Today, there is \r\ngreater representation of women in Government, in \r\npolitical life, business and civil society. Liberia’s own \r\neffort was recognized on Sunday when we received an \r\naward for our progress on MDG 3, on the \r\nempowerment of women. We also commend this body \r\nand the Secretary-General for their work in \r\nestablishing the United Nations Entity for Gender \r\nEquality and the Empowerment of Women, and we \r\n A/65/PV.15\r\n \r\n3 10-54965 \r\n \r\napplaud the appointment of the former President of \r\nChile, Michelle Bachelet, to take on this responsibility. \r\n We have five years left to go to achieve the \r\nMDGs. For us, it is not the target date that matters; \r\nrather, it is the commitment to achieving the Goals that \r\nis important. We therefore call upon our partner \r\ncountries to support the realization of the Goals \r\nthrough strong global partnership, as recommended in \r\nMDG 8. We believe in the partnerships we have \r\nenjoyed with the bilateral and multilateral institutions \r\nthat have made our progress possible. We call upon all \r\nin this Hall to secure the strength of this partnership, \r\nwhich benefits all of our countries, by supporting the \r\nreplenishment of the resources of the World Bank and \r\nthe African Development Bank. \r\n Liberia’s progress is not without challenges. The \r\nsatisfactory security environment of which I speak is \r\nstill fragile, and made more so by the political \r\nuncertainties in our subregion. We also continue to face \r\nthe tensions associated with the thousands of our \r\nyoung people who, lacking skills, are still unemployed. \r\nMoreover, we continue to manage the raised \r\nexpectations expressed in the demand from villages \r\nand communities across the country for essential \r\ninfrastructure such as roads, schools and clinics. \r\nPerhaps the greatest challenge we face is to go beyond \r\nthe measures we have taken in formulating a public \r\nservice code of conduct, in introducing new \r\nprocurement and financial management systems, and in \r\nestablishing and strengthening the pillars of \r\nintegrity — all aimed at addressing long-standing \r\ncorruption. Reform of the judicial system and efforts to \r\nchange an inherited value system are additional \r\nmeasures that are under way. \r\n Another challenge is Liberia’s vulnerability to \r\norganized cross-border crime, including drug and \r\nhuman trafficking, as the result of porous borders and \r\nlimited law-enforcement capacity, with weak national \r\nsecurity organizations. Against this background, we \r\nrecently signed the Freetown Commitment on \r\nCombating Illicit Trafficking of Drugs and \r\nTransnational Organized Crime in West Africa, which \r\nshould assist us in promoting capacity-building in the \r\nregion to combat transnational crime. \r\n The root cause of civil crisis in Liberia was the \r\nconsistent failure of democratic transitions that would \r\nusher in Governments elected by the people. With the \r\nsupport of the United Nations, multiparty democratic \r\nelections were held in 2005, following the end of the \r\ncivil crisis. In keeping with our Constitution, the \r\nLiberian people will once again exercise the right of \r\nchoice when we hold elections in 2011. \r\n The 2011 elections will mark a groundbreaking \r\nturning point. They will complete Liberia’s transition \r\nto full constitutional rule and participatory democracy. \r\nThis will be the true test of Liberia’s progress on the \r\nroad to development and its defining moment, which, if \r\nsuccessful, will serve as proof that we can truly stay on \r\nan irreversible course towards peace and development. \r\nIt is absolutely essential that everything be done to \r\nensure a peaceful, legitimate and transparent process. I \r\nwish to state categorically that my Government is \r\ncompletely and fully committed to this objective, and \r\nwe call on the international community to stay with \r\nLiberia on this last stretch. Already, the process leading \r\nto the holding of elections in 2011 has begun with the \r\nrelease of the election timetable. \r\n As a founding Member of this Organization, \r\nLiberia remains inspired by the noble objectives of the \r\nUnited Nations in meeting enormous global challenges. \r\nWe believe in its ability to formulate and implement \r\nprogrammes, particularly those aimed at raising the \r\nstandard of living of people, forging global cooperation \r\nand solidarity, and encouraging dialogue to reduce \r\ntension and conflicts. \r\n In closing, we say again that Liberia is on the \r\nway to recovery. We have thrown off the label of a \r\npariah State. We have restored hope to our people, \r\ncredibility and honour to our national integrity, and \r\nwon international creditworthiness and respect. Our \r\nconfidence in the future of our country is firm. Our \r\nnew vision of a rising Liberia seeks to move us to a \r\nmiddle-income country by the year 2030. This is an \r\naggressive goal, but we are determined, and through \r\nefficiency in the allocation and use of our natural \r\nresources, we will succeed. We thank you, Sir, and all \r\nthe members of this noble institution for the support \r\nthat has brought Liberia to this point of progress. \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Republic of Liberia for the statement she has just \r\nmade. \r\n  Ms. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, President of the \r\nRepublic of Liberia, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nA/65/PV.15  \r\n \r\n10-54965 4 \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Juan Manuel Santos Calderón, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Colombia \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nRepublic of Colombia. \r\n  Mr. Juan Manuel Santos Calderón, President of \r\nthe Republic of Colombia, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Juan Manuel \r\nSantos Calderón, President of the Republic of \r\nColombia, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Santos Calderón (spoke in Spanish): \r\nWith reverence and an immense sense of responsibility, \r\nI come to this historic forum for the first time to \r\nreiterate the commitment of my country and more than \r\n45 million Colombians to the fulfilment and success of \r\nthe founding principles of the United Nations. As this \r\nOrganization proceeds in its reform process, we \r\nsupport its adoption of the criteria of good governance, \r\nefficiency and transparency in order to realize those \r\nprinciples and to achieve a more effective international \r\nsystem of cooperation. \r\n We believe that the United Nations should focus \r\non achieving concrete results that transform realities \r\nrather than deepen conditions of dependency or \r\nperpetuate assistance programmes that often do more \r\nharm than good in developing countries. It is in this \r\nbelief and with faith in the future of the Organization \r\nthat I express today before this Assembly my country’s \r\naspiration to become a member of the Security Council \r\nfor the period 2011-2012. We seek that position on the \r\nbasis of respect for the principles of the United Nations \r\nCharter and with the commitment to providing our \r\nfullest cooperation to the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security. \r\n Colombia — which, along with other Latin \r\nAmerican nations, commemorates its two-hundredth \r\nyear of independence this year — has a long and \r\nsuccessful democratic and institutional tradition. Our \r\nRepublic has suffered the attacks of terrorism and the \r\nravages of international crime, but we have always \r\nfaced them within the framework of our Constitution \r\nand laws, following the most rigorous democratic \r\nprocedures. We are confident that our long and painful \r\nexperience can be very useful to all States Members of \r\nthe Organization in matters in which we have \r\ndeveloped a strong technical and operational capacity, \r\nsuch as security, the struggle against terrorism and \r\ndrug trafficking, the fight against the illicit trade in \r\nsmall arms and light weapons, the progressive \r\neradication of anti-personnel mines, humanitarian \r\nassistance, the disarmament, demobilization and \r\nreintegration of illegal armed groups, and — of \r\nparticular importance — how to do so while always \r\nprotecting human rights. \r\n As advocates of peaceful coexistence, we \r\nColombians are proud to participate in peacekeeping \r\nand peacebuilding operations, such as the United \r\nNations Stabilization Mission in Haiti, the \r\nMultinational Force and Observers in Sinai, and the \r\nUnited Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in \r\nSierra Leone. This participation reflects our \r\ncommitment to peace anywhere in the world, which we \r\nreaffirm today. \r\n That is why we want to be the voice of Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean in the Security Council at \r\nthis very special moment for our region. Latin America \r\nand the Caribbean, a region of some 600 million \r\ninhabitants, is our area of natural interaction. The \r\nregion includes countries with multiple political \r\nvisions and diverse positions on many specific topics. \r\nBut we are united in the interest of overcoming \r\npoverty, improving the living standards of our people, \r\nintegrating ourselves successfully into the global \r\nmarket, and protecting our environment. \r\n Latin American nations are beginning to assume a \r\nglobal leadership role on economic, environmental, \r\nsecurity and development issues. In my inaugural \r\nspeech on 7 August, I said that, given the significant \r\nprogress achieved by my country, the time for \r\nColombia had come. Today, in this global forum, I \r\nwish to go further and state with absolute conviction \r\nthat the time has come for Latin America. \r\n We Latin Americans have assumed the \r\nmanagement of our economies with responsibility. As a \r\nresult, we were one of the regions least affected by the \r\nglobal economic crisis. Today, our countries are \r\ngrowing on the basis of economic, social and \r\ntechnological pillars that are stronger than ever and \r\nattracting investors from throughout the world. We are \r\na subcontinent where the majority of the population is \r\nyoung, with immense talents and ability to work, with \r\ncities and natural wonders that attract tourists and \r\n A/65/PV.15\r\n \r\n5 10-54965 \r\n \r\ninvestors from all over the world, and with \r\nunparalleled environmental wealth. \r\n In these times, when the world demands food, \r\nwater, biofuels and natural lungs for the Earth such as \r\nthe tropical forests, Latin America has millions of \r\nhectares ready for cultivation without affecting the \r\necological balance, and all the willingness necessary to \r\nbecome a supplier of all the goods that humanity needs \r\nfor its own survival. \r\n More than 925 million people living with hunger \r\nand malnutrition are a challenge that cannot be \r\npostponed. Latin America can and wants to be part of \r\nthe solution. Ours is the region richest in biodiversity \r\non the planet, with the most megadiverse country in the \r\nworld, namely Brazil, and the country with the greatest \r\nbiodiversity per square kilometre, namely our country, \r\nColombia. The Amazon region alone holds 20 per cent \r\nof the global supply of fresh water and 50 per cent of \r\nthe planet’s biodiversity. \r\n Colombia is not a country with high levels of \r\npolluting emissions, but we want to assume our \r\nresponsibility to the planet and its future. We therefore \r\nsupport the international initiative known as Reducing \r\nEmissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation, \r\nwhich seeks to generate and allocate the resources \r\nnecessary to reduce tropical forest loss and associated \r\nemissions. We Colombians want to be a model country \r\nfor the world in monitoring its forests, carbon \r\nemissions and the state of its biodiversity. \r\n Latin America as a whole must be a key region in \r\nsaving the planet. We call for a new agreement to \r\nreplace the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012, to \r\nensure the commitment of all — starting with the big \r\nindustrial Powers  to emissions reduction. With \r\nappropriate economic compensation, we have an \r\nenormous capacity to reduce deforestation and plant \r\nnew forests, changing the history not only of the region \r\nbut of the world as a whole. \r\n When the twenty-first century began, Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean were just starting their \r\nmarch towards integration into the global economy. \r\nToday, 10 years later, in the light of our political and \r\neconomic stability and agricultural, energy and \r\nenvironmental potential, I want to send a message to \r\nthe other nations of our region. The world’s eyes are \r\nupon us. Now is the time for us to open our own eyes, \r\nto overcome any persisting differences among us, and \r\nto think big. If we do so, and given everything I have \r\njust said, we can declare with one voice, as I do today \r\nat the dawn of the second decade of the third \r\nmillennium: This is Latin America’s decade. It will be \r\na decade in which we can grow and advance, and first \r\nand foremost in which we can serve our peoples and \r\nthe well-being of humankind. \r\n Two days ago, I had the opportunity to present \r\nColombia’s results in its progress towards the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals. I \r\nam not now going to repeat our achievements — which \r\nhave been many — or our remaining challenges, which \r\nare many more. I simply want to underline that, more \r\nthan any other problem, poverty, with all its related \r\nconsequences, is the greatest calamity in our world.  \r\n I want to call attention in particular to the twofold \r\ntragedy faced by a brother Caribbean country, which, \r\nalong with its endemic poverty, is coping with the \r\neffects of a devastating natural disaster. I was in Haiti a \r\ncouple of months ago and I must say, before this \r\nAssembly of the nations of the world and with a \r\nsaddened heart, that its unbearable reality surpasses the \r\nworst nightmare. The pledged international aid is yet to \r\narrive in its entirety, or at least it is not visible. \r\nHaitians are still fighting and surviving with dignity \r\nand courage, but without the due attention we must \r\ngive to their situation, which can bear no delay. I call \r\non the Security Council to consider transforming the \r\nUnited Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti into a \r\ntrue development operation that responds to Haiti’s \r\nneeds and achieves concrete results. \r\n In these difficult economic times, especially for \r\nindustrialized nations, with high unemployment and \r\nstagnation, global solidarity tends to vanish from \r\namong our priorities. That is a mistake. Turning one’s \r\nback on international cooperation and trade helps no \r\none, and we are convinced that selfishness harms \r\neveryone, and the industrialized world more than any. \r\nWhere else are consumers going to come from if not \r\nfrom the millions of poor who have until now been left \r\nat the margins of progress? Who, other than societies \r\nfilled with enthusiastic young people, can contribute to \r\nthe dynamism  that mature nations need? What \r\neconomic space, other than the developing world, is \r\navailable to satisfy the needs of humankind in the \r\ncoming decades? Collective prosperity has advanced \r\nthe most precisely when millions have been involved in \r\ndevelopment, and the darkest moments of our planet’s \r\neconomy have been those of exclusion and barriers. \r\nA/65/PV.15  \r\n \r\n10-54965 6 \r\n \r\n I cannot close without referring to two global \r\nscourges — terrorism and drug trafficking — that feed \r\noff each other, because it is often the money from illicit \r\ndrugs that finances terrorists acts and groups. Perhaps \r\nmore than any other country, Colombia has been a \r\nvictim of these phenomena, but it has also been a \r\nmodel in the fight against them and a champion of the \r\nneed to act together with the international community, \r\nunder the principle of shared responsibility. \r\n Our democratic security policy — a policy of \r\nsecurity for all with respect for the law — is also a \r\nhuman rights policy because we have been able to \r\ndramatically reduce the crimes and behaviours that \r\nmost threaten the lives and fundamental rights of our \r\npeople, such as homicide, kidnapping and \r\ndisplacement. We were the first country to \r\ncomprehensively apply the principles of truth, justice \r\nand reparation in the demobilization of illegal armed \r\ngroups. The Colombian State and society are \r\ncommitted to defending and promoting human rights. \r\nWe do so out of conviction — deep conviction — and \r\nnot by imposition. \r\n We have achieved great results in the fight \r\nagainst drug trafficking. There has been a substantial \r\nreduction in hectares where coca is grown, and we are \r\ncommitted to pursuing this task until those crops are \r\ncompletely eradicated. We have hit hard the mafias that \r\ncontrol this business, including guerrilla groups that \r\nhave become veritable drug cartels. We will continue to \r\nfight them relentlessly and without quarter. We will \r\nspare no effort. Just yesterday, from this very city, I \r\nannounced to the world the news of the death of the \r\nhighest-ranking military leader of the Revolutionary \r\nArmed Forces of Colombia in an operation impeccably \r\nconducted by our armed forces. This is the most \r\nimportant and decisive blow against that terrorist group \r\nin its history, and we hope it will bring us closer to \r\npeace. \r\n We want to achieve peace either by reason or by \r\nforce, and we will achieve it so that we can dedicate \r\nand focus all our energies on achieving development \r\nand prosperity for our people. In the fight against drug \r\ntrafficking, we have lost many of our best soldiers, \r\npolicemen, leaders, judges and journalists. Still, their \r\nblood has not been shed in vain. From a failed State in \r\nwhich violent actors, financed by drug trafficking, had \r\ndistorted our democracy, today we look at the world \r\nfrom a thriving democracy rising towards democratic \r\nprosperity for all. We defeated the big drug cartels, but \r\nthis business has not come to an end yet. That is why \r\nwe will keep on fighting it, because for us it is a matter \r\nof national security. \r\n We are concerned and distressed that our relative \r\nsuccess has led to other countries of the region \r\nsuffering the growing presence and activities of drug \r\ntrafficking in their territories. The world needs to open \r\nits eyes, because to be in denial with respect to this \r\nproblem could be fatal. It happened to us at a very high \r\ncost. \r\n We Colombians are more than willing to \r\ncooperate with States that need it, and we are already \r\ndoing so with several countries in Central America and \r\nthe Caribbean, with Mexico and even in Afghanistan. \r\nBut, it is very important that we be consistent on this \r\nissue. I say this as representative of the country with \r\nthe highest moral authority to speak of this scourge, \r\nbecause no other nation has suffered like ours the \r\ndisastrous consequences of drug trafficking. \r\n We note with concern the contradictory stance of \r\nsome countries that, on the one hand, demand a head-\r\non fight against drug trafficking and, on the other, \r\nlegalize consumption or study the possibility of \r\nlegalizing the production and trade of certain illicit \r\ndrugs. How can I or anyone tell a peasant in my \r\ncountry that he or she will be prosecuted and punished \r\nfor growing crops for drug production, while in other \r\ncountries such activity is being legalized? These \r\ncontradictions make it urgent — and on this matter we \r\njoin the call by President Leonel Fernández Reyna of \r\nthe Dominican Republic — that we agree to review the \r\nglobal strategy against illicit drugs in order to draft a \r\nsingle global policy that is more effective and within \r\nwhich all countries will contribute equally to this \r\neffort. \r\n Thanks to the significant security, economic and \r\nsocial achievements accomplished in recent years \r\nthrough the efforts of many Colombians and the \r\nleadership of my predecessor, President Álvaro Uribe, \r\ntoday Colombia finds itself at the dawn of a new \r\nmorning. I came to office with the commitment to fight \r\npoverty and unemployment and to lead my country \r\ntowards not only economic but also social prosperity \r\nthat reaches everyone, above all the poorest. I have \r\nproposed a Government of national unity in which all \r\nColombians are united to create jobs and greater \r\nwelfare. I foresee with great optimism our future as a \r\nnation. \r\n A/65/PV.15\r\n \r\n7 10-54965 \r\n \r\n Today, I present myself before this global forum \r\nwith respect, humility, a sense of history and an \r\nawareness of our own limitations to say that we can do \r\nnothing alone, neither in my country nor in the world. \r\nOnly united and only with respect, solidarity and \r\ntolerance will humankind be able to know a better \r\ntomorrow.  \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Republic of Colombia for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n  Mr. Juan Manuel Santos Calderón, President of \r\nthe Republic of Colombia, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Robert G. Mugabe, President of the \r\nRepublic of Zimbabwe \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nRepublic of Zimbabwe. \r\n  Mr. Robert G. Mugabe, President of the Republic \r\nof Zimbabwe, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Robert G. \r\nMugabe, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, and \r\nto invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Mugabe: Allow me once again to \r\nextend to you, Sir, our warmest congratulations on \r\nyour election as President of General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-fifth session. I would, at the same time, like to \r\nassure you of Zimbabwe’s support and cooperation \r\nduring your presidency. \r\n We are meeting today to reaffirm our \r\ncommitment to the United Nations and, in particular, to \r\nits comprehensive agenda for the promotion of peace \r\nand security, sustainable development and human \r\nrights. We are, however, concerned that the world \r\ntoday continues to witness unbridled acts of \r\naggression, wars, conflicts, terrorism and rising levels \r\nof poverty. We are also alarmed that powerful States, \r\nwhich daily preach peace and good governance, \r\ncontinue to trample with impunity upon the \r\nsovereignty of poor and weak nations. Zimbabwe \r\nyearns for a community of nations that recognizes and \r\nrespects the sovereign equality of all nations, big and \r\nsmall, in accordance with the Charter of the United \r\nNations. We all have positive roles to play in \r\npromoting peace and development for the benefit of \r\npresent and future generations. \r\n As Members of the United Nations, we have \r\nrecognized the pressing need to reform our \r\nOrganization to make it better able to carry out its \r\nvarious mandates. Zimbabwe stands ready to work \r\nclosely with you, Sir, as well as with other Member \r\nStates, to ensure that the reform process is speeded up \r\nand carried out on the basis of consensus and \r\ndemocratic participation.  \r\n Most immediately, we must find ways and means \r\nto re-establish and assert the pre-eminent role of the \r\nUnited Nations in advancing peace and security, \r\ndevelopment and the achievement of internationally \r\nagreed goals, particularly the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). Why are the developed Western \r\ncountries, especially those permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council with the veto, resisting the \r\ndemocratization of the United Nations organs, \r\nespecially the Security Council? Are they not the ones \r\nwho talk glibly about democracy in regard to our \r\ndeveloping countries? Or are they sanctimonious \r\nhypocrites whose actions contradict their sermons to \r\nus? \r\n As we all know, the General Assembly is the \r\nmost representative organ of the United Nations. Its \r\nposition as the chief deliberative policymaking organ \r\nof the United Nations should therefore be respected. \r\nWe need to move with haste and find common ground \r\non how to revitalize the Assembly to enable it to fulfil \r\nits mandate as the most important body of the \r\nOrganization. Most important, this process of \r\nrevitalization must redress the continued encroachment \r\nby the Security Council on issues that fall within the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s purview and competence. \r\n Our position on the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil is well known. It is completely unacceptable \r\nthat Africa remains the only continent without \r\npermanent representation on the Council. That \r\nhistorical injustice must be corrected. We therefore \r\nurge Member States, including those that have vested \r\ninterests in maintaining the status quo, to give due and \r\nfair consideration to Africa’s legitimate demand for \r\ntwo permanent seats, with full powers of veto, plus two \r\nadditional non-permanent seats. Africa’s plea for \r\njustice cannot continue to be ignored. We all have an \r\nA/65/PV.15  \r\n \r\n10-54965 8 \r\n \r\nobligation to make the Council more representative, \r\nmore democratic and more accountable. \r\n Zimbabwe continues to advocate greater equality \r\nin international economic relations and decision-\r\nmaking structures. We therefore recognize the \r\ncentrality of the United Nations in setting the global \r\ndevelopment agenda and believe that it is only a more \r\ncoherent United Nations system which can better \r\nsupport the realization of all the internationally agreed \r\ndevelopment goals. \r\n The developing world, particularly Africa, \r\ncontinues to suffer from the effects of the global \r\neconomic and financial crises. It is important to \r\nunderstand that the critical issues we face today cannot \r\nbe addressed effectively when so many countries and \r\nregions are left out of the key decision-making \r\nprocesses of the institutions of global governance. \r\n We need to participate in the making of policies \r\nand decisions that affect our very livelihoods. It is for \r\nthis reason that we have called, and continue to call, \r\nfor the reform of multilateral financial institutions, \r\nincluding the Bretton Woods institutions. \r\n It is clear that climate change is now one of the \r\nmost pressing global issues of our time. Copenhagen \r\nfailed to produce a successor to the Kyoto Protocol, an \r\noutcome that many of us had hoped for. Yet that \r\nConference was significant in its own way. It \r\ndemonstrated the futility of attempts by the rich and \r\npowerful to impose their views and policies on the \r\npoor and weak. \r\n What we need is not an imposition of solutions \r\nbased on self-interest, but a consensus on the reduction \r\nof harmful emissions and a climate-change regime that \r\nbalances adaptation and mitigation backed by the \r\ntransfer of technology and resources. \r\n We need to pay special attention to the three \r\npillars of sustainable development, namely, economic \r\ngrowth, social development and environmental \r\nprotection. In doing so, we should implement the \r\nprinciple of common but differentiated responsibilities. \r\nIt is our hope that when our negotiators meet in \r\nCancún, Mexico, this December, they will produce an \r\noutcome that addresses the needs of those most \r\naffected by the effects of climate change. \r\n Global food security continues to be a matter of \r\ngreat concern, particularly in the light of increased \r\ndrought and flooding. We reiterate our call for an \r\nurgent and substantial increase in investment in \r\nagriculture in developing countries. Global efforts to \r\naddress the food crisis, the impact of climate change, \r\nand the drive to achieve the MDGs must go hand in \r\nhand. \r\n It is disappointing that the Doha Development \r\nRound has stalled, despite nine years of negotiations, \r\nmainly due to the intransigence of some countries. The \r\nDoha Round of trade must not be allowed to die but \r\nmust, instead, remain focused on development, as was \r\noriginally envisaged. \r\n We also call on the developed world to show \r\ncommitment to global food security by increasing trade \r\nand access to their markets. Developing countries need \r\nto break away from the unending cycle of humanitarian \r\nassistance, and this can be achieved if they have \r\nincreased access to developed- country markets. \r\n Zimbabwe strongly condemns the use of \r\nunilateral economic sanctions and other coercive \r\nmeasures in international relations. Such measures are \r\ncompletely at cross purposes with the principles of \r\ninternational cooperation as enshrined in the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations. I say this because my country \r\ncontinues to be a victim of illegal sanctions imposed by \r\nthe European Union and the United States without any \r\nreference to the United Nations and with the evil \r\nintention of causing regime change. These illegal \r\nsanctions have caused untold suffering among \r\nZimbabweans, who alone should be the deciders of \r\nregime change. \r\n Our Inclusive Government is united against these \r\nillegal sanctions and has made repeated appeals \r\nwithout success for their immediate and unconditional \r\nremoval. The rest of the international community, \r\nincluding the Southern African Development \r\nCommunity, the Common Market for Eastern and \r\nSouthern Africa and the African Union, has similarly \r\ncalled for the removal of the sanctions, but these calls \r\nhave gone unheeded. \r\n We urge those who imposed these iniquitous \r\nsanctions to heed the call by the international \r\ncommunity to unconditionally remove them. The \r\npeople of Zimbabwe should, like people of every other \r\nsovereign State, be left to freely chart their own \r\ndestiny. \r\n Every year, this body adopts a resolution on \r\nending the economic, commercial and financial \r\n A/65/PV.15\r\n \r\n9 10-54965 \r\n \r\nembargo imposed by the United States on Cuba. To this \r\ndate, those resolutions have gone unheeded by the \r\nUnited States and the result has been the continued \r\nsuffering of the people of Cuba. Zimbabwe joins the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement and other well-meaning \r\ncountries which call for the immediate lifting of the \r\nruinous embargo. \r\n Zimbabwe has expressed its concerns with regard \r\nto the continued stalemate in the Middle East peace \r\nprocess. It is unacceptable that, decades on, peace \r\ncontinues to elude that part of the world. We call upon \r\nall parties involved, particularly Israel, to respect the \r\nrelevant resolutions passed by the United Nations. It is \r\nour sincere hope that the current negotiations under \r\nway will be inclusive and eventually lead to the \r\ncherished goal of a sovereign State of Palestine, thus \r\nending decades of suffering for the Palestinian people. \r\n Since its inception in February 2009, our \r\nInclusive Government has fostered an environment of \r\npeace and stability. Several reforms have been \r\nimplemented, and the Government has created and \r\ninstituted constitutional bodies agreed to in the Global \r\nPolitical Agreement (GPA). The constitutional outreach \r\nprogramme is currently under way and upon its \r\nconclusion a new draft constitution will be formulated \r\nas precursor to a referendum next year, hopefully to be \r\nfollowed by an election. \r\n Achievements in the economic area include the \r\nrevitalization of capacity utilization in industries, the \r\ncontainment of inflation, improvement of service \r\ndelivery in health and education, as well as the \r\nrehabilitation of basic infrastructure such as roads, \r\nwater and sanitation facilities. \r\n  Mr. Askarov (Uzbekistan), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n \r\n The three parties to our GPA have worked hard to \r\nimplement most of the issues that we agreed on. To \r\nmaintain the momentum, we need the support of the \r\nregion and that of the international community. In this \r\nregard we commend the Southern African \r\nDevelopment Community, the African Union, the Non-\r\nAligned Movement and indeed like-minded members \r\nof the international community for giving us their \r\nsupport. We believe that constructive engagement, and \r\nnot isolation and punishment, will bring the necessary \r\nimpetus to the efforts of our inclusive Government. \r\nOur great country is indeed marching forward in peace \r\nand unity. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Zimbabwe for the statement he has just made. \r\n  Mr. Robert G. Mugabe, President of the Republic \r\nof Zimbabwe, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. René Garcia Préval, President of the \r\nRepublic of Haiti \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nHaiti. \r\n  Mr. René Garcia Préval, President of the Republic \r\nof Haiti, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. René Garcia Préval, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Haiti, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly. \r\n President Préval (spoke in French): My first \r\nwords will be to pay tribute to the memory of hundreds \r\nof thousands of Haitians and those who came to \r\nhelp — including about 100 United Nations staff, in \r\nparticular Mr. Hédi Annabi, Special Representative of \r\nthe Secretary-General — who all lost their lives during \r\nthe earthquake that struck Haiti on 12 January.  \r\n But every tragedy offers some solace in terms of \r\nhuman solidarity. Therefore once again on behalf of the \r\nHaitian people and on my personal behalf I would like \r\nto thank all the people and Governments across the \r\nworld, ranging from the Dominican Republic, our \r\nclosely attached neighbour, to those at the far corners \r\nof the globe, that rushed to our assistance. That \r\nassistance was crucially important to us, in particular \r\nduring the first few weeks when the need was so \r\nurgent. \r\n Allow me to also thank those Haitians living \r\nabroad, in New York, Miami, Chicago, Montreal, Paris, \r\nSanto Domingo, the French West Indies and many \r\nother parts of the world, who joined the great \r\ninternational solidarity movement and, in their \r\ncommitment, endeavoured for the most part to \r\nestablish structures that would help our country \r\nrebuild.  \r\n I would be remiss were I not to pay special \r\ntribute here, publicly, to the people of Haiti \r\nA/65/PV.15  \r\n \r\n10-54965 10 \r\n \r\nthemselves, a people who have been deprived of \r\neverything and yet who have demonstrated the \r\nimmeasurable wealth of their humanity. Towns that had \r\nbeen destroyed did not become the scenes of \r\nwidespread looting. The people showed such dignity \r\nand kindness, such exemplary stamina in their \r\nsuffering, such boldness,  devotion and courage, such \r\nsolidarity, spirit of self-sacrifice and love for others. \r\nThose are the words that come to mind and I think that \r\nis how we must describe the acts of heroism of the \r\nHaitian people. Let us show our respect for them. \r\n My country has lived a unique history since its \r\nbirth immediately after a war of independence that \r\ntook the lives of one third of its people and caused \r\nunimaginable destruction. And in the wake of the \r\nAmerican and French revolutions of the eighteenth \r\ncentury, that war of independence challenged the \r\nhuman race to  recognize the universal character of the \r\nproclamation of humankind’s right to freedom, dignity \r\nand equality by making the men and women of Haiti \r\nfree. \r\n Our nation was born in 1804 and, although poor \r\nand  since then deprived of resources, it has never \r\nhesitated to extend material support to peoples \r\nstruggling for freedom, including in greater Colombia, \r\nwhich is today Venezuela, Ecuador, Colombia and \r\nPanama, under the leadership of Francisco Miranda \r\nand then Simón Bolívar. \r\n Despite our limited resources, Haiti has always \r\ndemonstrated its firm belief in one human race. And \r\ntherefore we fully appreciate that immense movement \r\nof solidarity and compassion of the international \r\ncommunity for our country, from the moments \r\nimmediately after the earthquake right up to the \r\ncommitment on 31 March at the New York conference \r\nby which it agreed to participate in rebuilding Haiti on \r\nthe basis of the plan of action prepared by the Haitian \r\nGovernment. \r\n Since then, with the assistance of the \r\ninternational community and support from the United \r\nNations, we have set up a commission to coordinate \r\nresources for rebuilding. This commission is an \r\nimportant strategic mechanism for helping the country \r\nmanage transparently and with discipline the resources \r\nmobilized within the international community to \r\nsupport our country as it rebuilds. The commission has \r\nalready adopted over 30 projects, on education, health, \r\ninfrastructure and so forth, costing over $1 billion. \r\n May I extend my thanks to those countries and \r\nagencies that have followed up on their commitments \r\nto make financial contributions. I trust that a similar \r\neffort will be made by others as well so as to help us \r\nrespond quickly to the over one million Haitians who \r\nare still living in tent cities and temporary shelter.  \r\n We have just held an important high-level \r\nmeeting on the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). Ten years ago, when 189 countries met here \r\nto make the collective commitment to achieving the \r\neight Millennium Development Goals by the year \r\n2015, the international community was actually in \r\nagreement on what the world should look like in \r\n2015 — a world well on the way to reducing extreme \r\npoverty, where children and mothers would not have to \r\ndie because of lack of health care, where all children \r\nwould be able to go to school, where millions of people \r\nwould no longer die of hunger every year, where \r\nwomen would be able to fulfil their potential in a \r\nsociety without any gender-based discrimination.  \r\n That vision was the right one, because it placed \r\nhuman dignity at the very heart of all development \r\nprogrammes and the international cooperation agenda. \r\nAnd that vision also had the advantage of providing \r\ncountries and their partners in the international \r\ncommunity with a clear, straightforward structure for \r\nplanning development and organizing cooperation with \r\nthe countries that were committed to help achieve the \r\nGoals.  \r\n While significant progress has been made in the \r\nright direction, five years from 2015 there is still a long \r\nroad to travel because the developed countries have not \r\nfully lived up to the commitments made with respect to \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, particularly their \r\nfinancial commitments. \r\n What shall I say about the trillions of dollars that \r\nhave been swallowed up over the last 10 years in wars \r\nthat have been as bloody as they were unjustified? \r\n What shall I say about the defence budgets which \r\nevery year exceed by far what would be needed to \r\nattain the Millennium Development Goals? \r\n And what shall I say about the incalculable \r\nwealth that has simply evaporated in speculation, in the \r\narrogant supremacy of the virtual economy over the \r\nreal economy? \r\n A/65/PV.15\r\n \r\n11 10-54965 \r\n \r\n Are we going to continue sacrificing the well-\r\nbeing and lives of millions of human beings, the future \r\nof planet Earth, to this culture of fear and greed? \r\n What shall I say about the fact that official \r\ndevelopment assistance continues to fall, when in 2005 \r\nthe developed countries committed to doubling the \r\namount by 2010? \r\n What happened to the decision to encourage a \r\nmore open trading system, when assistance to farmers \r\nin developed countries is over three times the amount \r\nof official development assistance? \r\n In truth, the globalization that began centuries \r\nago, with the colonization and the importation of \r\nAfrican captives to work as slaves on sugar-cane and \r\ncoffee plantations, whose products would then be \r\nexported to the West or the North, needs to be \r\nreinvented.  \r\n The time has come for us to invent a new kind of \r\nglobalization, one that is based on the simple concept \r\nof our common humanity, on trust, cooperation and \r\nmutual respect, on respect for our environment and all \r\nforms of life in it. We must, as a matter of urgency, do \r\naway with a vision that sees profit as a veritable god, \r\nreduces citizens to the level of simple consumers, and \r\nregards planet Earth as a colony that we can destroy. \r\nThe global village will not be able to maintain forever \r\nits fashionable neighbourhoods side by side with \r\nwretched slums where humanity is dissolving: a socio-\r\neconomic North and South — not a geographic one.  \r\n In Haiti, living on an island in a part of the world \r\nthat has always been swept by hurricanes, we are \r\nparticularly worried about global warming and the \r\nclimatic disturbances that come with it: more frequent \r\nand more devastating cyclones and a rising sea-level.  \r\n Must the poor continue to pay for the waste, the \r\nunbridled appetite for energy of their wealthier \r\nbrethren? Must they renounce their efforts to improve \r\ntheir standard of living in order to feed the consumer \r\nfrenzy of the industrialized countries? \r\n The so-called war against drugs consists of a few \r\nlittle skirmishes in the consumer countries but full-\r\nscale bloody battles in the production and transit \r\ncountries, whose very existence is sometimes \r\njeopardized. \r\n Are the countries of the South still to be pilloried \r\nas responsible for the production and transit of illegal \r\ndrugs even though the engine for this lucrative \r\ntrafficking is demand for drugs in countries of the \r\nNorth? \r\n What shall I say about the arms trafficking, which \r\nflows from the North to the South and supports the \r\ndrug trafficking? \r\n It is for us to provide the answer to those \r\nquestions, and we cannot sidestep them much longer \r\nwithout rushing to our common doom. The only hope \r\nlies in a renewed humanism, clear-sighted, embracing \r\nof all life and the environment, on which we are \r\ndependent and for which we are responsible. In that \r\nsense, South-South cooperation affords new promise, \r\nand I invite the leaders of the countries of the South to \r\nstrengthen those channels for the well-being of our \r\nrespective peoples.  \r\n Some of the statements I have heard in this \r\nsession of the General Assembly seem to presage a new \r\nand different consciousness, which may be what is \r\nrequired for our vision of a new humanity. Still, as \r\nalways, we must be mindful to that commitments and \r\naction match the expansive rhetoric.  \r\n This is the moment for Haiti to renew its call for \r\nthe lifting of the embargo against Cuba. Besides having \r\nbeen condemned in many Assembly resolutions, an \r\nembargo of this kind is absolutely contrary to the \r\nvalues we advocate in matters of international \r\ncommerce.  \r\n I would be remiss if I were not to convey, on \r\nbehalf of the Haitian people, our condolences to the \r\nmany peoples who have suffered lately from natural \r\ndisasters in Chile, China, Pakistan, Guatemala and \r\nMexico. \r\n I shall conclude by referring to the presidential \r\nand legislative elections that will mark the end of my \r\nterm and the end of a particularly difficult year for the \r\npeople of Haiti. It is important that that difficult \r\nprocess be conducted with rigour, fairness and \r\ntransparency, so as to consolidate our young \r\ndemocracy. Therefore I appeal to all national actors \r\nand our international friends, so that together we can \r\nmake our way through that electoral crossroads \r\nsuccessfully. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Haiti for the statement he has just made. \r\n \r\nA/65/PV.15  \r\n \r\n10-54965 12 \r\n \r\n  Mr. René Garcia Préval, President of the Republic \r\nof Haiti, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Paul Kagame, President of the \r\nRepublic of Rwanda \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nRwanda. \r\n  Mr. Paul Kagame, President of the Republic of \r\nRwanda, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Paul Kagame, President of \r\nthe Republic of Rwanda, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly. \r\n President Kagame: At this sixty-fifth session of \r\nthe General Assembly, it is right that we re-examine \r\nthe role of the United Nations in global governance, as \r\nwe strive to help it adapt as fast as our times are \r\nchanging, so that it serves all its Members equally.  \r\n In my understanding, global governance \r\nrecognizes the inevitable and welcome \r\ninterconnectedness of nations, the unique \r\ncircumstances and contributions of each and the \r\nprinciple of mutual respect. I say “welcome” because, \r\nas we have seen, major threats of a global scale — like \r\nthe financial crisis, climate change, terrorism, poverty \r\nand other challenges to world peace — need the \r\nconcerted efforts of all nations if they are to be \r\naddressed effectively. \r\n The just-concluded High-level Plenary Meeting \r\non the Millennium Development Goals has provided us \r\nanother opportunity to assess the role of the United \r\nNations, measure the progress we have made and \r\nconsider the hurdles that remain in meeting the various \r\nGoals we set for ourselves. It is evident that the United \r\nNations is uniquely placed to play a crucial role in \r\nmobilizing and galvanizing all nations for the common \r\ngood, driving forward our collective initiatives and \r\ncoordinating actions that foster the social and \r\neconomic development of all. \r\n Still, the United Nations is the sum total of \r\nMember States, and it can only be as good as the \r\nconstituent Members want it to be. If there were a \r\ncommon understanding and shared values among all \r\nMember States, the Organization would deliver more \r\nefficiently on its mandate. But it has become clear that \r\nthe United Nations has evolved into a two-tier \r\norganization, reflecting a world that seems to be \r\ndivided into two major categories: one considered to \r\nhave inherent, laudable values, rights and liberties, and \r\nanother that needs to be taught and coached on those \r\nvalues. \r\n My country and many in the developing world \r\nseem to fall into that second category. Not only \r\nmarginalized and disenfranchised, we are also \r\nconsidered chronic violators of our own human rights. \r\nThe implication is that the United Nations holds a \r\ncertain standard for some countries, and another for \r\nothers, especially on international issues concerning \r\nwhich every single Member should be treated equally \r\nunder the law.  \r\n In my view, a debate between those two \r\ncategories is urgently needed within the United Nations \r\nmembership so as to regain the noble founding ideals \r\nof the Organization. No entity is better placed than our \r\ncommon United Nations to bring equality and respect, \r\ndespite disparities in economic status. \r\n The same situation pertains in the realm of \r\ninternational justice and the rule of law. Rwanda \r\nsubscribes to the principle that everyone and every \r\nState is accountable to laws and that the rule of law \r\nshould govern us all. But these laws must truly be \r\nequally enforced and independently adjudicated. \r\n Reaffirming the role of the United Nations in \r\nglobal governance presupposes strengthening and \r\nreforming it to make it more effective and efficient in \r\nits response to global challenges. The impetus to \r\nreform our global governance structures, however, is \r\nthe desire to ensure that they are equipped to deal with \r\nthose challenges and secure a brighter future for all the \r\ncitizens of the world. \r\n When there are no avenues for appealing \r\ninternational rulings, when there is an accountability \r\ndeficit in key global institutions and when ordinary \r\ncitizens feel that the United Nations cannot deal \r\nadequately with the issues affecting their daily lives, \r\nthe United Nations cannot be seen as credible, relevant \r\nand democratic. We should make sure the Organization \r\ndoes not become a tool for the powerful to protect their \r\ninterests and enhance their influence or use it in \r\nsubjugating others. \r\n A/65/PV.15\r\n \r\n13 10-54965 \r\n \r\n Rwanda believes in multilateralism and \r\nunderstands that global challenges can be effectively \r\nresolved only through international cooperation. The \r\nUnited Nations must continue to be at the centre of that \r\nagenda and play its role without bias or prejudice. \r\n As we in Rwanda continue to rebuild our country, \r\nwe have become acutely aware of the need for lasting \r\npeace and security in our region and have worked hard \r\nto achieve it. We know that stability is the key \r\nprerequisite for our development and the improved \r\nlives of our citizens and our neighbours, and we have \r\nunreservedly committed ourselves to attaining it. We \r\nwill continue to work in partnership with our \r\nneighbours, international and regional organizations \r\nand the African Union to ensure that peace and security \r\nprevail and that Africa fully realizes its potential. \r\n Lastly, let me say that each of our countries, \r\nseparately and collectively, has a duty to the people of \r\nthe entire world, especially the most vulnerable. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Rwanda for the statement he has just made. \r\n  Mr. Paul Kagame, President of the Republic of \r\nRwanda, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Hifikepunye Pohamba, President of \r\nthe Republic of Namibia \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nNamibia. \r\n  Mr. Hifikepunye Pohamba, President of the \r\nRepublic of Namibia, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Hifikepunye Pohamba, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Namibia, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly. \r\n President Pohamba: I wish to congratulate \r\nMr. Deiss on his election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-fifth session. We are confident \r\nthat he will discharge the responsibilities of his high \r\noffice with wisdom. I assure him of Namibia’s \r\ncooperation and support. I would also like to commend \r\nhis predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam  \r\nTreki, for the able manner in which he presided over \r\nthe sixty-fourth session. \r\n The Secretary-General of the Organization, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, and his staff have done a \r\ncommendable job in overseeing the ongoing efforts to \r\nimprove the working methods of the Organization and \r\nfor better interaction with Member States. We \r\ncommend them for their dedication and hard work. \r\n The theme for this year’s session, “Reaffirming \r\nthe central role of the United Nations in global \r\ngovernance”, is both timely and appropriate. In that \r\nspirit, Member States should reaffirm the central role \r\nof the United Nations in global governance. Namibia \r\nshares the views expressed in the outcome document of \r\nthe Conference on the World Financial and Economic \r\nCrisis and Its Impact on Development (resolution \r\n63/303, annex). \r\n We believe that because of its universal \r\nmembership and legitimacy, the United Nations is well \r\npositioned to participate in the reform processes to \r\nimprove and strengthen the effective functioning of the \r\ninternational financial system. In that regard, we must \r\nreaffirm our commitment to a universal, rules-based, \r\nopen, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral \r\ntrading system and also work together for a speedy and \r\nequitable conclusion to the Doha Round. \r\n Although Namibia is currently classified as a \r\nhigh middle-income country, it still bears the scars of \r\nsocial and economic inequalities inherited from its \r\ncolonial past. As a result, we carry the unenviable \r\ndistinction as the country with the most unequal \r\ndistribution of income and economic resources in the \r\nworld. Ironically, our country also faces declining \r\ninternational development assistance due to that very \r\nclassification, which has negatively impacted our \r\nability to mobilize resources for national development \r\nefforts. \r\n In that light, I appeal to the international financial \r\ninstitutions to create special mechanisms to enable \r\nmiddle-income countries to access financial resources \r\nfor development on concessional terms, as called for \r\nby the 2008 Windhoek Declaration on Development \r\nCooperation with Middle-Income Countries. \r\n Our recently concluded High-level Plenary \r\nMeeting on the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) gave world leaders and other stakeholders a \r\nunique opportunity to review progress made towards \r\nA/65/PV.15  \r\n \r\n10-54965 14 \r\n \r\nthe achievement of the MDGs and to share valuable \r\nexperiences. It is also evident that more work remains \r\nto be done. The challenges encountered should \r\nencourage us, and the successes recorded should \r\ninspire us all to work relentlessly for the noble and \r\ncommon objectives of achieving all of the MDGs. \r\n At the global level, climate change is one of the \r\nmajor challenges facing humanity today. The \r\ndevastating impact of natural disasters around the \r\nworld has affected most of our countries. Although \r\nNamibia does not significantly contribute to the \r\nemission of greenhouse gases, it is one of the countries \r\nmost vulnerable to the effects of climate change. In \r\nrecent years, we have experienced increasingly severe \r\nfloods and droughts that have destroyed crops, \r\nlivestock and wild animals. We thus call upon \r\nindustrialized countries to take practical steps and \r\ndemonstrate greater political will to bring about drastic \r\nreductions in greenhouse gas emissions. We also urge \r\nthem to give meaningful support to the efforts of \r\ndeveloping countries to mitigate and adapt to the \r\nadverse effects of climate change. \r\n It is our hope that the industrialized countries will \r\nmeet their commitments to provide adequate resources, \r\nin line with the undertakings made at Copenhagen in \r\n2009. Namibia looks forward to a successful outcome \r\nof the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, to be held \r\nin Mexico later this year. \r\n In 2000, while serving as a member of the \r\nSecurity Council, Namibia initiated and introduced a \r\ntheme on women, peace and security, which resulted in \r\nthe adoption of the  resolution 1325 (2000). Our \r\nobjective was to highlight the plight of women in \r\nconflict situations and to recognize the vital role that \r\nthey can play in peacemaking efforts for the effective \r\nresolution of conflicts. As we commemorate the first \r\ndecade of that resolution, let us recommit ourselves to \r\nthe protection of women and girls in conflict situations \r\nin all parts of the world. \r\n We welcome the Assembly resolution on system-\r\nwide coherence and the establishment of UN Women as \r\nan entity dedicated to dealing with gender-related \r\nissues (resolution 64/289). We hope that that new \r\nentity will strengthen the institutional capacity of the \r\nUnited Nations for the support of gender equality and \r\nthe empowerment of women. My delegation wishes to \r\ncongratulate Ms. Michelle Bachelet on her appointment \r\nas UN Women’s first head. \r\n In August, Namibia assumed the chairmanship of \r\nthe Southern African Development Community \r\n(SADC). In that capacity, we will work to promote \r\ncooperation with other regional economic communities \r\nin Africa, as the building blocks for intracontinental \r\nintegration. SADC strives for political stability in the \r\nregion as a prerequisite for sustainable development. In \r\nthat connection, we have taken proactive steps to \r\nresolve the political crisis in Madagascar, through the \r\nfacilitation efforts of former President Joachim \r\nChissano of Mozambique. \r\n The recent African Union (AU) summit, held in \r\nKampala in July, focused on maternal, infant and child \r\nhealth and development in Africa. African leaders \r\nreaffirmed their commitment to mobilize and direct \r\nresources to check the deaths of women and children \r\nfrom preventable diseases. \r\n Namibia has consistently urged the international \r\ncommunity to fulfil its obligation to help the people of \r\nWestern Sahara in their quest for self-determination. \r\nWe therefore call for immediate and unconditional \r\nimplementation of the United Nations Settlement Plan \r\nfor Western Sahara and for the holding of a free and \r\nfair referendum, based on the terms of the relevant \r\nresolutions of the Security Council and the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Namibia is deeply concerned about the ongoing \r\nsuffering and humiliation of the Palestinian people \r\nunder Israeli occupation and the denial of their \r\nfundamental right to self-determination. It is \r\nencouraging, however, that direct negotiations have \r\nbeen resumed between the parties. We hope that a \r\ndurable solution will be found without further delay \r\nand on the basis of the relevant United Nations \r\nresolutions. \r\n Namibia is also concerned about the prolonged \r\nand extraterritorial economic embargo imposed on the \r\npeople of Cuba. We fully support the decision of the \r\nAU summit in Kampala calling for the embargo’s \r\nremoval. We believe that the economic blockade is \r\nunjustifiable and unfair and should therefore be lifted.  \r\n Similarly, Namibia calls for lifting the economic \r\nsanctions imposed, directly or indirectly, on the \r\nRepublic of Zimbabwe by some Western countries. \r\nThose sanctions have caused enormous suffering, not \r\n A/65/PV.15\r\n \r\n15 10-54965 \r\n \r\nonly to the people of Zimbabwe, but also to other \r\ncountries in the SADC region. \r\n For many years now, we have been calling for \r\ncomprehensive reform of the United Nations system, \r\nparticularly the Security Council. The process must be \r\nfinalized to render the Council more representative, \r\ndemocratic and accountable. It is unjust that Africa \r\nremains the only region of the world without \r\npermanent representation on the Security Council. In \r\nthat connection, we reiterate our support for the \r\nAfrican common position on Security Council reform, \r\nas articulated in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte \r\nDeclaration. \r\n The maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity is our collective responsibility. Namibia \r\nbelieves that peace, security and stability are the \r\ncornerstones of sustainable development, and thus we \r\nwill continue to participate in United Nations and AU \r\npeacekeeping missions. We urge the international \r\ncommunity to support conflict prevention and \r\npeacebuilding efforts around the world.  \r\n Recently, States parties to the Nuclear Non-\r\nProliferation Treaty reaffirmed their commitment to \r\nnuclear disarmament, non-proliferation and the \r\npeaceful use of nuclear energy. We welcome that \r\npositive step, in the belief that multilateralism is the \r\nmost viable option for achieving a world free from the \r\ndanger of nuclear weapons. \r\n Namibia believes in the effectiveness of \r\ncollective action under the auspices of the United \r\nNations to resolve conflicts by peaceful means and to \r\naddress the challenges facing the world. My delegation \r\nis optimistic that together we can successfully work for \r\nthe common good of all humanity. Let us join hands to \r\nachieve our common objective of building a better \r\nworld for present and future generations. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Namibia for the statement he has just made. \r\n  Mr. Hifikepunye Pohamba, President of the \r\nRepublic of Namibia, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Bharrat Jagdeo, President of the \r\nRepublic of Guyana \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nGuyana. \r\n  Mr. Bharrat Jagdeo, President of the Republic of \r\nGuyana, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Bharrat Jagdeo, President \r\nof the Republic of Guyana, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly. \r\n President Jagdeo: I bring to all delegates at this \r\nsixty-fifth session of the General Assembly the warm \r\ngreetings of my Government and people. \r\n The United Nations was founded out of the ashes \r\nof war and violence. Its noble ambitions, grounded in \r\nthe timeless values of peace, equality and justice, seek \r\nto create a better world for this and future generations. \r\nBut if those values are to mean anything, the United \r\nNations must not be merely about a statement of \r\naspiration. Instead, we must strive until the United \r\nNations provides the framework where the timeless \r\nvalues I speak of can be given life through meaningful \r\nand practical responses to the contemporary challenges \r\nour peoples face. \r\n The challenges are many, but this week has drawn \r\nthree of them into particularly sharp focus: first, our \r\nglobal efforts to halve poverty and achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals by 2015; secondly, a \r\nglobal financial crisis that threatens to undo much of \r\nthe progress we have made in lifting people out of \r\npoverty; and thirdly, a climate crisis that carries the \r\nrisk of planet-wide disruption that endangers entire \r\nnations and the continuation of much of what we take \r\nfor granted today. \r\n Those challenges are all a function of the \r\ndominant characteristic of the modern world: our \r\ninterconnectedness as a global community. And we will \r\nmeet the challenges only if we adopt an interconnected \r\nresponse. The notion that we can protect our national \r\nand global interests through inward-looking national \r\nresponses is no longer valid. Instead, it is in all of our \r\ninterests for the United Nations to provide the platform \r\nthat facilitates global, interconnected responses. \r\nA/65/PV.15  \r\n \r\n10-54965 16 \r\n \r\n But I think we have some way to go if that \r\nplatform is to be created. When it comes to the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), although \r\nprogress has been made, we have not connected the \r\nrhetorical support for their achievement to actual \r\ndelivery. When it comes to the financial crisis, we have \r\nnot connected the benefits of globally open financial \r\nsystems to measures that protect against the risks that \r\nthose systems create. And when it comes to the climate \r\ncrisis, we have not connected the scientific evidence to \r\nglobal policy responses that mitigate the worst \r\nextremes of climate change. \r\n We could choose to continue in this vein, but it is \r\nclear where that would lead us. Or we could choose to \r\nask ourselves if we are prepared to be held accountable \r\nfor carrying our share of the responsibility.  \r\n My country recognizes that we must deliver our \r\npart. We are on track to meet most of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, especially in the areas of \r\neducation and health. We are doing all we can to \r\nweather the financial crisis with the minimum suffering \r\nfor our people. And we recognize that we must do more \r\nthan just complain about climate change. We have \r\ncreated our Low Carbon Development Strategy, which \r\nsets out a long-term path to protect our 16-million-\r\nhectare rainforest and move our entire economy onto a \r\nlow carbon trajectory. \r\n But there are times when it feels as though the \r\ninternational system sets out to put hurdles on the path \r\nto overcoming the challenges. Inconsistencies and a \r\nlack of coherence among aid, trade and climate policies \r\nin the developed world, to name just three areas, often \r\ncreate difficulties for developing countries who seek to \r\nmake progress. \r\n The United Nations can help to change those \r\nrealities, and provide the framework for global \r\nresponses that match the ambition of the institution. \r\nBut at the core of that framework must be an enhanced \r\nunderstanding of the concept of accountability. \r\n As countries like mine fully embrace our need to \r\nbe accountable for the actions we take to support a \r\nglobal response to the MDGs, financial instability and \r\nclimate change, so too developed countries must \r\nrecognize their responsibilities and the need to take a \r\nholistic approach to their dealings with the rest of the \r\nworld. Aid flows are appreciated and valuable, but they \r\nsometimes pale into insignificance when those \r\ncountries that promote how their aid is helping the \r\nachievement of, for example, the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals are also pursuing unjust, narrow-\r\nminded trade or climate policies. \r\n I therefore call on the United Nations to establish \r\na set of global accountability indicators with which we \r\ncan transparently monitor whether the members of the \r\ninternational community are pursuing policies that, in a \r\nholistic sense, help them discharge their global \r\nresponsibilities, not just through the provision of aid \r\nbut also through the avoidance of unfair trade and \r\nclimate policies. Through the Millennium Development \r\nGoals, we have started to develop some of the \r\nindicators we need. As we enhance them further, I \r\nbelieve we will see that better accountability, properly \r\nunderstood, can help us rise to the challenges we face. \r\n I would like to highlight the centrality of the need \r\nto protect and preserve our environment. While each of \r\nthe issues I have mentioned is a global one requiring a \r\nglobal response, the environmental challenges we face \r\nmock those who think we still live in a world where \r\nglobal collective action is somehow a matter of choice. \r\n The destruction of a natural habitat anywhere in \r\nthe world removes life forms that could have been the \r\nbedrock of future medical advances for citizens \r\neverywhere. A ton of carbon emitted in Africa or Asia \r\nthreatens the citizens of the smallest village in North \r\nAmerica. When those who seek to represent their \r\ncitizens deny that that is true, or fail to understand its \r\nconsequences, they threaten their own national \r\ninterests and the wealth and security of their nation. \r\n Therefore, failure to appreciate the need for an \r\ninterconnected, global response to climate change and \r\nloss of biodiversity is not just an abdication of \r\nresponsibility to some intangible global good or to \r\npeople on the other side of the world. It is a very real, \r\nmeasurable threat to citizens in every village, hamlet \r\nand city in the world. History will not judge kindly \r\nthose who were too blinkered or ignorant to realize \r\nthat. So a step change in our efforts to avoid \r\ncatastrophic climate change and protect biodiversity is \r\nneeded. \r\n When we met here last year, many hoped that the \r\nUnited Nations would facilitate agreement on global \r\naction to stabilize our planet’s climate at the meeting of \r\nmost of the world’s leaders in Copenhagen in \r\nDecember. Not only did the global community fail to \r\naccomplish that, we are now in real danger of suffering \r\nfrom a catastrophic drift in ambition, where we no \r\n A/65/PV.15\r\n \r\n17 10-54965 \r\n \r\nlonger even try to connect the scientific evidence on \r\nclimate change with the necessary global action to \r\navert it. \r\n This drift in ambition must be stopped. It is a \r\nconsequence of choices we make; it is not \r\npredetermined. So we must rededicate ourselves to \r\ncrafting a shared response to shared climate threats. \r\nMost progressive countries now realize this, and are \r\ncommitted to temperature rises of a maximum of 2° \r\ndegrees C or lower. They feel that this will require \r\nglobal economic growth powered by efficient and clean \r\nenergy, new green industries, and a new, less carbon-\r\nintensive approach to forestry and agriculture. \r\n But despite knowing this, the international \r\ncommunity continues to fail to put in place the \r\nmeasures that will enable the economic transformation \r\nthat we claim we want. This is in large part due to the \r\nabsence of a global agreement that puts a price on \r\nhigh-carbon activity and rewards low-carbon \r\ninnovation. We need this to change. To that end, \r\nGuyana continues to hold that the international \r\ncommunity needs a legally binding global climate \r\ntreaty that would first facilitate the emission cuts \r\nneeded to stabilize the planet’s climate, and then \r\nenable us to move on from seeing climate change \r\npurely in terms of its costs, while also allowing us to \r\nsee how it can catalyse a once-in-a-lifetime global \r\neconomic transformation that can benefit people \r\neverywhere. This cannot happen without deep, binding \r\nemission cuts in today’s developed world, which could \r\nstimulate the financial flows that can address \r\nmitigation and adaptation across the developing world. \r\n We recognize that such a global treaty may not be \r\nachievable this year, but we are not powerless to act \r\nnow. The international community can do three things \r\neven in the absence of a treaty, and we can achieve \r\nbreakthroughs in each when we meet in Cancún. \r\n First, we can hold the developed countries \r\naccountable for the commitments they have made to \r\nthe immediate short-term ramping-up of financing for \r\nclimate action in the developing world. The existing \r\ncommitments of a total of $30 billion by 2012 and \r\n$100 billion per year by 2020 can be agreed to in \r\nCancún. Secondly, we can solve the vexed issue of an \r\neffective financial transfer mechanism to ensure that \r\nthe funds flow both to adaptation and mitigation \r\nactions. Thirdly, we should look at ramping up \r\nmeaningful sectoral responses that work in the short \r\nterm. Specifically, in Guyana we believe that action on \r\ndeforestation and forest degradation is one of the \r\nefforts that can be made quickly and with maximum \r\nimpact. I want to emphasize that none of this is about \r\nasking the developed world to provide us with aid. \r\nInstead, it is about ensuring that the capital for \r\naddressing climate change is allocated where it can \r\nhave the biggest impact. \r\n In addressing these matters, I want to raise a \r\nsensitive subject: the Copenhagen Accord, which was \r\nthe only tangible outcome of last year’s climate \r\nSummit. I know that many countries here today \r\nassociated themselves with the Accord reluctantly, and \r\nthat some did not associate themselves with it at all. \r\nBut I believe that reluctant or no association with the \r\nCopenhagen Accord, and strong support for some of its \r\nprovisions, are not mutually exclusive. Even countries \r\nthat did not associate themselves with the Accord \r\nshould hold the developed world accountable for its \r\ncommitments. \r\n We have long said in Guyana that if the \r\ninternational community is prepared to be held \r\naccountable, we will not be found lacking. Three years \r\nago, we said that notwithstanding the immense climate \r\nchallenges in our country — in 2005 floods caused \r\ndamage equivalent to 60 per cent of our gross domestic \r\nproduct — we were prepared to do our bit. We have \r\ndetermined that, as a country more than 80 per cent of \r\nwhose territory is rainforest, we can make a \r\ndisproportionate contribution to solving climate \r\nchange. So we have looked at the contribution we can \r\nmake in two ways: first, by creating a financial \r\nmechanism whereby we can put our entire rainforest \r\nunder protection; and secondly, by using the resources \r\nwe receive for the climate services we provide from \r\nour protected forest to reorient our economy on a low-\r\ncarbon trajectory. \r\n As a consequence, after one of the most \r\ncomprehensive national consultations on climate \r\nchange anywhere in the world, we have started to \r\nimplement our low-carbon development strategy. We \r\nhave identified how we can cumulatively save forest-\r\nbased emissions of 1.5 gigatons by 2020. We have a \r\ndeal in place with Norway on reducing emissions from \r\ndeforestation and forest degradation, and because of \r\nthis we are in the process of creating a climate finance \r\nfund that will amount to between $300 million and \r\n$500 million between this year and 2015. We have also \r\nidentified how we can use this climate financing to \r\nA/65/PV.15  \r\n \r\n10-54965 18 \r\n \r\ninvest in education and health care; to catalyse private \r\nfinance to move virtually our entire economy to clean \r\nenergy; to open up non-forested land for new economic \r\nactivities; to invest in climate adaptation needs and to \r\nsupport our indigenous people in the economic and \r\nsocial transformation of their communities. We \r\ntherefore hope that we are demonstrating the value of \r\naction on the three interlinked financing commitments \r\nI spoke of, and I hope that we are starting to show how \r\ninterconnected global responses can deliver globally \r\nvaluable results. \r\n The United Nations is, despite its many \r\nlimitations, our best hope for the advancement of \r\nhumanity. Its universality allows the Organization to \r\nplay a central and catalytic role in balancing the \r\ndiffering interests of Member States and in generating \r\nconsensus on the issues that divide us. We must \r\ntherefore commit fully to the principles and purposes \r\nof its Charter and to the improvement of its structure. \r\nOn behalf of my country and people, I wish to assure \r\nthe Assembly of our full support for the Organization \r\nand for strengthening its capacity to better fulfil the \r\nmany mandates entrusted to it. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Guyana for the statement he has just made. \r\n  Mr. Bharrat Jagdeo, President of the Republic of \r\nGuyana, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Ahmed Abdallah Sambi, President of \r\nthe Union of the Comoros \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Union of the \r\nComoros. \r\n  Mr. Ahmed Abdallah Sambi, President of the \r\nUnion of the Comoros, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Ahmed Abdallah Sambi, \r\nPresident of the Union of the Comoros, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly. \r\n President Sambi (spoke in French): This year I \r\nshould like to devote most of my statement once again \r\nto the important matter of the Comorian island of \r\nMayotte. This has been a dispute between us and \r\nFrance for more than three decades. It is our hope that \r\nthere will be greater understanding and more active \r\nsolidarity on this matter on the part of this Assembly. \r\n It is my belief that the future of my country, the \r\nUnion of the Comoros, depends on peace and stability. \r\nBut there can be no lasting stability in my country \r\nwithout a final solution to this problem. Accordingly, \r\nthis year we have once again requested that an item on \r\nthe Comorian island of Mayotte be included on the \r\nagenda of the sixty-fifth session of the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n I also take this opportunity to express the deep \r\ngratitude of the Comorian people for the valuable and \r\nunwavering support of the African Union, the League \r\nof Arab States and the Organization of the Islamic \r\nConference on this issue.  \r\n I would like to begin by recalling that, pursuant \r\nto recommendations of the United Nations, the highest \r\nFrench authorities have themselves affirmed that the \r\nComoros should accede to independence within \r\ninviolable borders. Thus, former French President Mr. \r\nValéry Giscard d’Estaing declared, inter alia, that the \r\nComoros are and always have been an entity and that it \r\nis natural that they have a common destiny.  \r\n I also deem it vital and timely to recall today \r\ncertain resolutions of our Organization confirming the \r\nlegitimacy of the Comorian claim to the island of \r\nMayotte. These include resolution 1514 (XV), of \r\n14 December 1960, on the granting of independence to \r\ncolonial countries and peoples, which guarantees the \r\nnational unity and territorial integrity of such countries \r\non regaining their sovereignty. Resolution 3291 \r\n(XXIX), of 13 December 1974, reaffirms the integrity \r\nand unity of the Comoro Archipelago. In addition, \r\nresolution 3385 (XXX), of 12 November 1975, adopted \r\na few months after the independence of the Comoros, \r\naffirms the admission of the Comoro Archipelago, \r\ncomposed of the islands of Mayotte, Anjouan, Mohéli \r\nand Grande-Comore, to the United Nations. \r\n Lastly, the historic resolution 31/4, of 21 October \r\n1976, underscores the right of the Comoros and the \r\nduties of France with regard to that independent \r\ncountry. Allow me to read out the provisions of that \r\nresolution that is of paramount importance to my \r\ncountry and which will remain forever etched in the \r\nmemory of my Comorian compatriots. \r\n A/65/PV.15\r\n \r\n19 10-54965 \r\n \r\n  “Considering that the occupation by France \r\nof the Comorian island of Mayotte constitutes a \r\nflagrant encroachment on the national unity of the \r\nComorian State, a Member of the United Nations, \r\n  “Considering that such an attitude on the \r\npart of France constitutes a violation of the \r\nprinciples of the relevant resolutions of the \r\nUnited Nations, in particular of General \r\nAssembly resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December \r\n1960 concerning the granting of independence to \r\ncolonial countries and peoples, which guarantees \r\nthe national unity and territorial integrity of such \r\ncountries, \r\n  “1. Condemns and considers null and void \r\nthe referendums of 8 February and 11 April 1976 \r\norganized in the Comorian island of Mayotte by \r\nthe Government of France, and rejects: \r\n  “(a) Any other form of referendum or \r\nconsultation which may hereafter be organized on \r\nComorian territory in Mayotte by France; \r\n  “(b) Any foreign legislation purporting to \r\nlegalize any French colonial presence on \r\nComorian territory in Mayotte; \r\n  “2. Strongly condemns the presence of \r\nFrance in Mayotte, which constitutes a violation \r\nof the national unity, territorial integrity and \r\nsovereignty of the independent Republic of the \r\nComoros;” (resolution 31/4, third and fourth \r\npreambular paragraphs and paras. 1 and 2). \r\n France refuses to comply with all those relevant \r\nresolutions adopted by the General Assembly relating \r\nto the Comorian island of Mayotte and continues to \r\nviolate the principle of the inviolability of colonial \r\nborders. It must be recalled that the principle of the \r\ninviolability of borders became a rule of customary \r\ninternational law, codified under paragraph 6 of \r\nresolution 1514 (XV), which stipulates that:  \r\n  “Any attempt aimed at the partial or total \r\ndisruption of the national unity and the territorial \r\nintegrity of a country is incompatible with the \r\npurposes and principles of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations.”  \r\nThat same resolution recalls in its paragraph 7 that:  \r\n  “All States shall observe faithfully and \r\nstrictly the provisions of the Charter of the United \r\nNations, the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights and the present Declaration on the basis of \r\nequality, non-interference in the internal affairs of \r\nall States, and respect for the sovereign rights of \r\nall peoples and their territorial integrity.”  \r\n International jurisprudence fully recognizes that \r\nprinciple of the indivisibility of colonial entities. In the \r\njudgment handed down on 11 September 1992 in a \r\ndispute between Honduras and El Salvador, the \r\nInternational Court of Justice in The Hague declared \r\nthat the principle of the inviolability of colonial \r\nborders is a retroactive principle that changes \r\nadministrative boundaries originally designed for other \r\npurposes into international borders. \r\n For many years, my country has called the \r\ninternational community to witness and has made \r\nknown its readiness to seek a fair and just solution \r\nbilaterally. The response to our position was crushing. \r\nFrance not only took unilateral steps in 1994 to hinder \r\nthe free circulation of persons by introducing a visa for \r\nall Comorians wishing to visit Mayotte, part of \r\nComorian territory, but also, in 2000, it began the \r\nprocess of making the island a department, which is \r\nillegal under international law. \r\n I wish to stress that the imposition of a visa \r\nrequirement in 1994 had truly tragic human \r\nconsequences. The small slice of the sea of \r\napproximately 70 kilometres separating Anjouan from \r\nthe sister island of Mayotte has now become the largest \r\nmaritime cemetery in the world. To date, nearly 7,000 \r\npeople have been killed. \r\n Moreover, while we had agreed to establish a \r\nhigh-level working group to relaunch the dialogue in \r\norder to consider together equitable and just solutions, \r\non 29 May 2009 France organized another referendum \r\naimed at changing the status of the island of Mayotte \r\ninto an overseas department. \r\n We are surprised that, despite all the good will \r\ndemonstrated by the Comorian side — and in particular \r\nthe innovative proposal on Mayotte known as “one \r\ncountry, two systems” or two administrations, which I \r\nmyself introduced at an earlier session of this \r\nAssembly — there has been no positive response from \r\nFrance to that outstretched hand. The dual system \r\nwould be a compromise that would finally ensure \r\nrespect for international law, while enabling France to \r\ncontinue to legally administer the Comorian island of \r\nMayotte during a period to be mutually agreed. It \r\nwould also enable our Mahorais brothers and sisters, \r\nA/65/PV.15  \r\n \r\n10-54965 20 \r\n \r\nwhom I love dearly, to preserve their social status and \r\nstandard of living, and the three other islands to finally \r\ntake up the many challenges of development in peace \r\nand stability. \r\n But France wants to know nothing about this \r\ncompromise. Faced with such an attitude, we find \r\nourselves obliged to request our dear Organization to \r\nrequire France to respect and comply with international \r\nlaw, implement the various relevant United Nations \r\nresolutions on the Comorian island of Mayotte, and to \r\nreconsider its position on our offer, which clearly \r\nrepresents a huge sacrifice on the part of my country, \r\nwhich in fact is within its rights. \r\n What is at stake is the future of the Comoros, a \r\nsmall sovereign country Member of the United \r\nNations. Also at stake is the honour of France, a great \r\ncountry whose ideals of liberty, equality and fraternity \r\nso strongly and profoundly inspired the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights and the principles \r\nunderpinning our Charter. Ultimately, what is at stake \r\nis the honour of our Organization, whose very \r\ncredibility would be sorely challenged should \r\ninternational law and legality continue to be \r\ndisregarded and the territorial integrity of the Comoros \r\ncontinue to be violated.  \r\n The United Nations is the guarantor of respect for \r\ninternational law. It is duty-bound to require that its \r\nMembers’ legislation complies fully with the relevant \r\nresolutions. I can only endorse the statement of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly, His Excellency Mr. \r\nJoseph Deiss, who said at the opening of this session \r\nthat the United Nations is the guarantor of global \r\ngovernance and enjoys a global legitimacy. \r\n I cannot end my statement without reiterating that \r\nthe Comoros supports the efforts of the international \r\ncommunity, and more specifically the personal efforts \r\nof His Excellency President Barack Hussein Obama, to \r\nestablish a just and lasting peace in the Middle East \r\nenabling the Palestinian people to live freely and safely \r\nin an independent State and to enjoy fully all their \r\nlegitimate rights. \r\n My country also pays tribute to efforts to bring an \r\nend to the fratricidal conflicts that are ripping apart the \r\nSudan, Afghanistan, Somalia, the Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo and the Great Lakes region.  \r\n We also reiterate our strong support for the \r\nterritorial integrity of the brotherly Kingdom of \r\nMorocco and our full backing for the Moroccan \r\nautonomy proposal as a definitive political compromise \r\nsolution to the regional dispute over the Moroccan \r\nSahara. \r\n We also reiterate our unwavering support for the \r\nlegitimate demands of the People’s Republic of China \r\nfor the return of Taiwan to China’s fold. \r\n It is through peace, stability and security and \r\nrespect for international law that our nations will be \r\nable to attain the development goals they have set \r\nthemselves to help our peoples. I therefore have full \r\ntrust that our Organization shall continue to make these \r\nideals its main focus. \r\n(spoke in Arabic) \r\n We must, as soon as possible, implement the \r\nagreements and resolutions that we have agreed in \r\norder to find peaceful and definitive solutions to all \r\noutstanding issues, because any delay in or suspension \r\nof our search for such solutions would create \r\nadditional, similar issues and crises in other countries \r\nand spark the flames of extremism and terrorism \r\nthroughout the world. We hope that we shall find \r\nsolutions that will lead to the happiness and well-being \r\nof all our peoples. \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Union of \r\nthe Comoros for the statement he has just made. \r\n  Mr. Ahmed Abdallah Sambi, President of the \r\nUnion of the Comoros, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Carlos Mauricio Funes Cartagena, \r\nPresident of the Republic of El Salvador \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of El \r\nSalvador. \r\n  Mr. Carlos Mauricio Funes Cartagena, President \r\nof the Republic of El Salvador, was escorted into \r\nthe General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Carlos Mauricio Funes \r\nCartagena, President of the Republic of El Salvador, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Funes Cartagena (spoke in Spanish): \r\nIt is an honour and a great responsibility to address the \r\n A/65/PV.15\r\n \r\n21 10-54965 \r\n \r\nAssembly today. It is a responsibility because we need \r\nto make the right analysis of the serious problems we \r\nface and, in my particular case, of the difficult reality \r\nin my country. El Salvador is one of many nations on \r\nthis planet beset by the problems of poverty, \r\nbackwardness and, above all, injustice. The more a \r\nleader is weighed down by the tragedy of his people, \r\nthe greater the responsibility, as we know well. \r\n When the Assembly reviews the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and the struggle against \r\npoverty in the world, and we look at the reality in \r\nCentral America, we can say that the efforts made have \r\nnot yet yielded the expected results. It is not easy for \r\nme to be so blunt in my assessment, but that is the \r\nreality and the international community must be \r\nsensitive to the plight of the vast majority of the \r\nworld’s population. For many years now, the agenda of \r\nthe United Nations and other multilateral forums has \r\nincluded the struggle against poverty. The hoped-for \r\nimprovements, however, cannot be discerned. As far as \r\nsocial justice is concerned, far from achieving the \r\ndesired progress, the gap between rich and poor \r\ncountries, and between the rich and poor within \r\nindividual countries, has widened. Injustice has \r\nprevailed over our good intentions. That is the truth. \r\n The recent massacre in the Mexican state of \r\nTamaulipas of 72 migrants, of whom 14 have been \r\nidentified as Salvadorans — and we continue to try to \r\nidentify others — reveals the magnitude of the tragedy \r\nthat, while centred on Mexico and Central America, \r\naffects the whole world. Those 72 murdered desperate \r\nyoung men and women, who lost their lives trying to \r\nfind a future in the United States or Canada, are an \r\nexpression of the tragedy in the region, as well as a \r\nmetaphor for global injustice. This tragedy was not the \r\nresult of a plane crash or climate change. It was the \r\nresult, essentially, of three factors that point to the lack \r\nof positive results in the fight against poverty and \r\ninjustice. \r\n I am referring first to the lack of opportunities, \r\nexclusion, backwardness and widespread injustice that \r\naffect Central American societies and account for the \r\nmass emigration of their young people. The second is \r\nthat of migration, a consequence of the first. The third \r\nis violence, crime and the shadow business of \r\norganized crime, which exploits the breeding ground of \r\npoverty and the transit of dispossessed migrants for its \r\nillicit purposes.  \r\n El Salvador has 6 million inhabitants in its \r\nterritory and 3 million more living elsewhere, mainly \r\nin the United States. Migration has grown year by year \r\nin the wake of Governments’ lack of response to the \r\naforementioned problems. Our migrants — indeed, the \r\nmigrants of the entire world — leave their civil rights \r\nbehind when they leave their country and arrive in new \r\nlands that do not recognize those rights. As experts on \r\nmigration have said, the migrant is a pariah, a human \r\nbeing without rights. For the more than 200 million \r\nmigrants around the world, mostly young people, \r\nhuman and social rights, such as those embodied in the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, are not \r\nguaranteed. Another reality in our region is the very \r\nhigh incidence of violence against women, which also \r\ncalls for our special attention. \r\n We note the close relationship between poverty, \r\ninjustice and migration. Furthermore, another, closely \r\nrelated factor in our region is the strong presence of \r\norganized crime and the extremely high incidence of \r\nviolence and criminality. We can say without \r\nexaggeration that the map of poverty and injustice is \r\nthe same as the map of migration; of the traffic in \r\ndrugs, humans and weapons; civic insecurity; money-\r\nlaundering and crime on a major scale. \r\n I mentioned the lack of positive results in fighting \r\npoverty and injustice on a global scale, especially in \r\nCentral America. I will now offer an example of the \r\nfailure of policies implemented in my country over the \r\npast decade. According to a report of the United \r\nNations Development Programme, the wealthiest \r\nsegment of the population in El Salvador received \r\n23 per cent of the State’s social spending. The lowest \r\nsegment — the poor and marginal population — \r\nreceived only 18 per cent of that social spending. The \r\nState actually promoted and expanded injustice and \r\ncontributed to greater poverty. It is obvious that the \r\nneoliberal policies implemented in recent decades have \r\nrun counter to the desire of the international \r\ncommunity to reduce poverty, as expressed in the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. \r\n Let us therefore keep in mind the wise words of \r\nAlbert Einstein, who said that an insane person is he \r\nwho does the same thing over and over again and \r\nexpects different results. I am not speaking of my \r\ncountry alone. I believe that everyone has to undertake \r\nprofound changes in the way social policies are \r\ndesigned in order not to perpetuate failure. It would be \r\nnaïve, for example, to think that a coercive, repressive \r\nA/65/PV.15  \r\n \r\n10-54965 22 \r\n \r\nState that invests more and more in its security forces \r\nor that mobilizes its army to support the police to \r\ncombat crime — as I have ordered done in El Salvador, \r\ngiven the rise in crime that I inherited upon assuming \r\noffice — can in and of itself resolve the problem of \r\ninsecurity. We would be making a historic mistake if \r\nwe did not address the root causes of violence and \r\ncrime. The indolent State that has prevailed in recent \r\ntimes must be transformed into a social State that \r\nwages as its chief battle the reduction of poverty and \r\ninjustice. \r\n In this regard, I would like to lay out some \r\nthoughts based on that reality. First, the righteous \r\nbattle against organized crime and on behalf of the \r\nhuman rights of migrants does not fall exclusively to \r\nMexico and Central America. Here, I would like to say \r\nthat we must not leave it to Mexico or to Central \r\nAmerica alone. Our region is not the main consumer of \r\ndrugs. Our countries are not the major recipients of the \r\nuninterrupted flow of laundered drug money, the \r\nproduct of the failure of stricter controls. It is not only \r\nour people who will be hurt if the drug cartels continue \r\nto grow stronger and to endanger our countries’ \r\nsurvival. This battle is not irrelevant to anyone. It \r\nwould be a mistake to believe that Mexico and Central \r\nAmerica can defeat crime alone. The territory of \r\ncriminal violence today is the border between the \r\nUnited States and our small countries, but tomorrow it \r\nwill be in the major cities of the developed world, the \r\ncapitals of America, Europe, Africa and Asia. So let us \r\nnot leave it to Mexico alone, and let us not leave it to \r\nCentral America alone. \r\n This is my appeal to the international community. \r\nThe help our countries need is economic; it is \r\nintelligence; it is support for training and equipping \r\nour law-and-order forces to combat crime and control \r\nmoney-laundering. But we also need help with the new \r\nsocial and regional policies that the Central American \r\nIntegration System has prepared, because those \r\ninvestments will address the causes of our tragedies.  \r\n For these reasons, I wish to bring two proposals \r\nto the General Assembly. First, we should establish, \r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations, a Central \r\nAmerican commission to investigate organized crime. \r\nThe establishment of such a body would be based on \r\nthe good experience of the International Commission \r\nagainst Impunity in Guatemala known as CICIG, which \r\nwas established with the support of the United Nations, \r\nthe United States, Canada and Spain. Such a \r\ncommission would no doubt contribute to \r\nstrengthening institutions. We must recognize that State \r\norganizations have been infiltrated by organized crime \r\nand that all means must be made available to recover \r\nthem and to wage the war against crime. \r\n My proposal is based on an implicit \r\nacknowledgement of the obvious truth that organized \r\ncrime does not recognize borders or respect States. Our \r\nresponse must therefore also transcend these \r\nboundaries; our response must be integration. Until the \r\nestablishment of such a commission, my country shall \r\nwork along these lines and has launched dialogue and \r\naction with neighbouring countries with a view to \r\ncoordinating policies to prevent and punish crime.  \r\n My second proposal concerns the establishment \r\nof an international alliance to support the priorities of \r\nregional integration, which are the fight against \r\npoverty and inequality and the creation of opportunities \r\nthat will allow our populations to stay in their \r\ncommunities of origin. \r\n Central Americans understand this, and are \r\nwilling to give battle to poverty, exclusion, and \r\norganized crime. To that end, we have started joint \r\nwork by relaunching our integration organization, the \r\nCentral American Integration System. Central \r\nAmericans are striving to create strong, democratic and \r\njust societies. In the specific case of El Salvador, my \r\nGovernment is moving forward with the building of a \r\nsocial State that reformulates social policy, taking into \r\naccount the failure of past mechanisms that I \r\nmentioned earlier. \r\n Gangs have become veritable criminal \r\norganizations coordinated with organized crime. We \r\nshall not overcome this reality with mere assistance \r\npolicies or improvements in the standards of living. \r\nThis phenomenon is found among young people who, \r\nfrom earliest childhood and adolescence, join gangs, \r\nand is so widespread that gangs have become a \r\ncomplex subculture. Our response must be equally so. \r\n Within the framework of a social State, we must \r\ndeepen democracy and strengthen republican \r\ninstitutions. We know that corruption is one of the \r\nworst enemies of the democratic system; therefore, \r\nworking for transparency has become a fundamental \r\naspect of our national and regional strategies.  \r\n Throughout Central America, this struggle is a \r\nmatter not only of ethics, but also of democratic \r\n A/65/PV.15\r\n \r\n23 10-54965 \r\n \r\nsurvival. In other words, we must oppose the potential \r\nemergence of a drug State by building strongly \r\ndemocratic and transparent States. It has been proven \r\nthat the more corruption there is, the less economic \r\ndevelopment there is. Corruption poisons public \r\npolicies, especially those that assist the poor; it reduces \r\ncitizens’ trust in their system and makes markets \r\ninefficient. \r\n My Government has created a specialized body to \r\nfight corruption. The Under Secretariat of \r\nTransparency and Anti-Corruption is the first body in \r\nAmerica to submit itself to the in situ control by the \r\nInter-American Program of Cooperation to Fight \r\nCorruption of the Organization of American States, and \r\nhas been commended as such. According to the \r\nGovernment of the United States, El Salvador is also \r\nthe Central American country with the best \r\nperformance in fighting organized crime and drug \r\ntrafficking. Thus, it is not on the high-risk map which \r\nthat Government has just published. Without \r\ntransparent institutions, strong and independent \r\ninstitutions and without a true vocation to fighting \r\norganized crime, it will not be possible to meet the \r\ngreat challenges before us.  \r\n We are waging a war. It is a new war unlike those \r\nof the past. We are not waging it against another nation \r\nor standing army. We are facing a powerful, \r\nsophisticated, diffuse enemy that has blended in with \r\nour society, and we must fight it with new weapons, \r\ncreativity, intelligence, and the cooperation of our \r\nsocieties and the global community. Only thus will our \r\nefforts be commensurate with the circumstances. Only \r\nthus will we be able to meet today’s challenges. Only \r\nthus will we provide sound responses to the needs of \r\nthe majority of our peoples, who await opportunities to \r\nbelieve once again in democracy, institutions and \r\npolitics.  \r\n Once again, I appeal to the conscience and \r\nsensibility of the international community. In \r\nconclusion, I wish to do so by quoting President John \r\nF. Kennedy’s 1961 inaugural speech, which reflects \r\nwhat I have tried to convey today. He said that “if a \r\nfree society cannot help the many who are poor, it \r\ncannot save the few who are rich”.  \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof El Salvador for the statement he has just made. \r\n  Mr. Carlos Mauricio Funes Cartagena, President \r\nof the Republic of El Salvador, was escorted from \r\nthe General Assembly Hall.  \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Toomas Hendrik Ilves, President of \r\nthe Republic of Estonia \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nEstonia. \r\n  Mr. Toomas Hendrik Ilves, President of the \r\nRepublic of Estonia, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\n The Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Toomas Hendrik Ilves, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Estonia, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly. \r\n President Ilves: I am pleased to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly. This year, I shall focus on three \r\npressing global matters: the progress in achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), promoting \r\npeace and security, and humanitarian affairs. \r\n During the first decade of this millennium, the \r\nMDGs have triggered a level of global commitment \r\nand wide-ranging partnership that the world has never \r\nseen before. Along the way, there have been setbacks, \r\nof course. One thing, however, is certain — achieving \r\nthe MDGs is an attainable reality with concrete targets \r\nand deadlines. \r\n We have set a clear goal, but we must keep in \r\nmind that we shall reach our objective only if we share \r\nthe weight of responsibility and all of us pull in the \r\nsame direction. The political will expressed by a \r\nmajority of stakeholders at the recent MDG summit \r\nand in its outcome document (resolution 65/1) needs to \r\nbe implemented promptly, in accordance with the \r\nagreed action agenda. Only five years, after all, remain. \r\nEstonia is ready to provide continuous contributions to \r\nthe success of our common endeavour. \r\n Estonia contributes towards the achievement of \r\nthe MDGs through focused development cooperation \r\npolicy and respective activities in our main partner \r\ncountries, one of which is Afghanistan. Alongside with \r\nproviding security through the International Security \r\nAssistance Force (ISAF), we are carrying out long-\r\nterm health care and education projects in Helmand \r\nprovince. We also offer our best practices in \r\nA/65/PV.15  \r\n \r\n10-54965 24 \r\n \r\nestablishing standards of good governance, including \r\nthe creation of an electronic voting system for the \r\nnewly elected Parliament. \r\n Estonia supports the transition process, including \r\nthe gradual transfer of security responsibilities to the \r\nAfghan authorities. This process should be term-based \r\nand irreversible, and carried out according to the \r\nagreement reached at the ISAF meeting in Tallinn last \r\nApril. Ownership of the process on the part of the \r\nAfghan Government is crucial in taking forward the \r\npledge it made at the Kabul Conference with regard to \r\nstrengthening the electoral framework. This, along with \r\nthe endorsed reform agenda, demonstrates the Afghans’ \r\ndesire to develop their nation. \r\n For my country, Estonia, the development of \r\ninformation and communications technology has been \r\na crucial engine of economic development and \r\nmodernization throughout the past 20 years. This is \r\nwhy our experts advise Governments on information \r\nand communications technology solutions in many \r\nparts of the world. In cooperation with the United \r\nNations Development Programme and the Open \r\nSociety Institute, we have established a special \r\nacademy to assist Governments in developing countries \r\nwith advice and training in electronic governance and \r\nthe use of information and communications technology \r\nin public services. I am convinced that the more \r\nsuccessful we are in reducing the digital divide, the \r\nmore accelerated and more sustainable overall \r\neconomic progress will be. \r\n I commend United Nations efforts in paving the \r\nway towards a more efficient operational system, \r\nespecially the long-awaited outcome of the four-year \r\nsystem-wide coherence negotiations. As the \r\nimplications of gender inequality affect all the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, the consensus \r\nagreement on establishing the United Nations Entity \r\nfor Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women \r\n(UN Women) will serve as an extra boost for meeting \r\nthose Goals. \r\n Estonia contributes to the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Goals through the respective United \r\nNations agencies, funds and programmes, and we \r\npledge our support to UN Women as well. \r\n Ever since the United Nations Charter was \r\nsigned, 65 years ago, the United Nations has stood for \r\nglobal peace and security. The United Nations \r\npeacekeeping budget has increased more than 15-fold \r\nsince 1991. It is difficult to imagine the situation in \r\nmajor crisis areas, such as the Sudan and the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, without the active, \r\nmultifaceted engagement of the United Nations. With \r\nits 15 military and 12 political operations, however, the \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping force is clearly stretched \r\nthin. We need further reforms in order to enhance the \r\neffectiveness of peacekeeping operations and to \r\nencourage regional actors to assume a stronger role. \r\nEstonia contributes to the United Nations peacekeeping \r\nbudget at a voluntarily enhanced rate. We have done \r\nthis for 10 years now and will continue to do so. \r\n The credibility of the United Nations in the \r\npromotion of peace and security depends on the \r\ncommitment of all Member States. We all share equally \r\nthe responsibility to apply the principles enshrined in \r\nthe Charter, including the duty to refrain from any \r\nthreat or use of force against the territorial integrity or \r\npolitical independence of any State. \r\n Estonia reiterates its firm support for the \r\nsovereignty, territorial integrity, security and stability \r\nof Georgia, on the basis of full adherence to \r\ninternational law. For the peaceful resolution of that \r\ndrawn-out conflict, it is necessary to continue the \r\nGeneva talks in their initial format. Humanitarian \r\nissues, in particular ensuring the safe and dignified \r\nreturn of refugees and internally displaced persons, and \r\nthe question of increased access to the conflict zone, \r\nespecially for humanitarian workers and international \r\nobservers, need to be seriously addressed now. \r\nFurthermore, the free movement of people living \r\nwithin the internationally recognized borders of \r\nGeorgia must be ensured. \r\n Without justice, efforts to ensure sustainable \r\npeace might easily be wiped out. I would like, \r\ntherefore, to emphasize the importance of the adoption \r\nby consensus of a package of amendments on the crime \r\nof aggression by the Review Conference of the Rome \r\nStatute of the International Criminal Court, held in \r\nJune 2010. Estonia strongly supports an international \r\ncriminal justice system in which an independent and \r\neffective International Criminal Court plays a central \r\nrole. \r\n It is also of crucial importance to support the \r\nactivities of the International Criminal Tribunal for the \r\nFormer Yugoslavia during its final years of existence. \r\nEstonia is doing its share with respect to the \r\nenforcement of sentences. \r\n A/65/PV.15\r\n \r\n25 10-54965 \r\n \r\n Success in confronting the security challenges of \r\nthe twenty-first century, including cyberthreats, \r\ndepends on close cooperation among all States and \r\ninternational and regional organizations. Estonia urges \r\nbroad cross-border and cross-sector capacity-building \r\nin protecting critical information infrastructure, the \r\nimportance of which was highlighted in the report of \r\nthe high-level panel of experts on information and \r\ncommunication technology (A/55/75). The necessity of \r\ncloser cooperation among States, between the private \r\nsector and civil society, is critical, since during a cyber \r\nattack all traditional security measures may be \r\nrendered useless. I can assure you that all-\r\nencompassing preparedness will pay off when a real \r\ncrisis strikes. \r\n Estonia remains actively engaged in areas where \r\nour contribution can make a difference, particularly in \r\nhumanitarian affairs and human rights issues. In this \r\ncontext, I would like to draw attention to the tenth \r\nanniversary of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) \r\non women, peace and security, which must be a \r\nstepping stone towards further action at the United \r\nNations, regional and national levels. Establishing \r\noperational guidelines for the protection of women and \r\ngirls, strengthening accountability mechanisms and \r\nenhancing women’s participation in peace negotiations \r\nand post-conflict peacebuilding should be part of these \r\nefforts. To this end, Estonia is finalizing a national \r\naction plan to enhance our activities. \r\n  Mr. Al-Jarman (United Arab Emirates), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n Estonia is a strong and principled advocate of \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms, including the \r\nfreedom of expression. Estonia supports the \r\nstrengthening of the Human Rights Council and its \r\ncapacity to promote and protect human rights around \r\nthe world. We aspire to join the Human Rights Council \r\nin 2012. \r\n Estonia has also continuously increased its \r\ncontribution to United Nations humanitarian activities, \r\nboth through work in the field and financially. The \r\nUnited Nations coordination capability was crucial \r\nmost recently in Pakistan and at the beginning of the \r\nyear in Haiti, where it saved lives, and where Estonian \r\nlogistics experts have been supporting United Nations \r\nactivities on the ground for more than six months now. \r\nOur experience has made clear the need for more \r\ncombined efforts in securing the link between relief \r\nefforts and development work. \r\n Estonia is concerned about increasingly frequent \r\nviolations of humanitarian principles in conflict zones. \r\nAlas, humanitarian emblems and flags no longer \r\nprovide the shield of protection they used to. We must \r\nstep up our efforts and press for increased security for \r\nhumanitarian aid workers. After all, it is the \r\nresponsibility of Governments to ensure the safety and \r\nsecurity of humanitarian personnel working on their \r\nterritory. \r\n The effectiveness of humanitarian aid and \r\nupholding good humanitarian principles are other \r\nconcerns of ours. Advocating these principles was one \r\nof the activities Estonia pursued during our recent co-\r\nchairmanship of the Good Humanitarian Donorship \r\ninitiative. \r\n Finally, I would like to underline one simple \r\ntruth. The United Nations, like any other organization, \r\nis only as strong and effective as the political will and \r\ncommitment of its members. Big or small, we all bear \r\nresponsibility. As a member of the European Union, \r\nEstonia firmly believes that the Treaty of Lisbon \r\nfundamentally enhances the ability of the Union to be a \r\nsignificant global actor, securing peace, stability and \r\nprosperity for all. With our shared commitment, I \r\nexpect the vital and prominent role of the United \r\nNations in the global arena to be further reinforced. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Estonia for the statement \r\nhe has just made. \r\n  Mr. Toomas Hendrik Ilves, President of the \r\nRepublic of Estonia, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Benigno Simeon C. Aquino III, \r\nPresident of the Republic of the Philippines \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of the Philippines. \r\n  Mr. Benigno Simeon C. Aquino III, President of \r\nthe Republic of the Philippines, was escorted into \r\nthe General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nA/65/PV.15  \r\n \r\n10-54965 26 \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Benigno Simeon C. Aquino III, President of the \r\nRepublic of the Philippines, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly. \r\n President Aquino: Allow me to convey the \r\ngreetings of the Filipino people to the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the representatives gathered \r\nhere for the sixty-fifth session of the Assembly. \r\n The United Nations was founded on the belief \r\nthat in collective action lies collective security. It is \r\nwhen nations reach across their borders that the \r\nimmense problems of our age begin to be manageable. \r\nIn a world that has become increasingly globalized, the \r\nchallenges that we face have become globalized as \r\nwell. Climate change; pandemics; terrorism and \r\nweapons of mass destruction; transnational organized \r\ncrime such as human trafficking and the illicit drug \r\ntrade; the continuing vulnerability of migrants, women, \r\npersons with disabilities and the poor; and the \r\nchallenges posed by increasingly interconnected \r\neconomies — all call for a further strengthening of \r\ninternational cooperation. \r\n All of us here, representing our respective \r\nnations, are stewards entrusted with the well-being of \r\nour respective peoples. We are also required to be \r\nresponsible and responsive members of the community \r\nof nations. Clearly, we are already aware that the \r\nproblem of one poses a problem for all. Any solution, \r\nthen, depends on us recognizing that each one of our \r\nnations exists, not in a vacuum, but rather in an \r\nincreasingly interdependent global milieu. \r\n The central revelation here is that for humanity to \r\nprogress, all nations must progress as one. The quest \r\nfor universal human dignity should not be defined by \r\ngeographical, racial or cultural boundaries, nor should \r\nit be set back by our desires to move our own nations \r\nforward. Global progress means equitable progress. \r\nThe industrialized nations of the world can look with \r\npride on the living standards their peoples enjoy. But, \r\nas one of my distinguished predecessors once said: \r\n“Those who have less in life should have more in law”.  \r\n This basic principle of social justice is also the \r\nmost basic humanitarian challenge of our times. The \r\nwealth of nations must become an instrument to move \r\nthe world further along the straight and righteous path \r\nof compassion and communal responsibility. The \r\nmessage is clear: there are those who need help, and \r\nacting with compassion towards those who need help is \r\na response that is both humane and necessary. This idea \r\nhas been trumpeted for decades, and yet combating \r\ninequality remains one of the greatest challenges of our \r\ntimes. The chasm between the powerful and the \r\npowerless, the haves and the have-nots remains to be \r\nbridged. The past century has demonstrated, in terms \r\nso stark that it inspired the creation of this \r\nOrganization, that when the mighty clash, those who \r\nhave less end up trampled. This is true where conflict \r\nexists and true where markets exist; true in our nation \r\nand true in an international context.  \r\n The concept of vulnerability and inequality is all \r\ntoo clear in the global effort to address climate change. \r\nThose who stand to lose much, if not everything, from \r\nthe effects of man-induced climatic conditions are \r\nthose who did little to cause it. There is an enormous \r\nneed to ensure, as a matter of justice, that countries, \r\nparticularly those that are vulnerable, are assisted in \r\ntheir adaptation and disaster risk-reduction efforts and \r\nare provided the necessary resources to build climate-\r\nresilient communities. This should go hand in hand \r\nwith ambitious commitments by major economies to \r\nsignificantly reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. \r\n Many of you may say that you have already given \r\nmightily of your resources. But surely we do not need \r\nflood and famine to remind us that there is so much \r\nmore that must be given, because there are so many \r\nmore who deserve the hope of a better life. \r\n The most immediate focus of cooperation \r\ndemanded of us today is to collectively ensure that the \r\neight Millennium Development Goals will be achieved \r\nby all in the remaining five years. That is a daunting \r\ntask, and we are all aware that national resolve has to \r\nbe complemented by bilateral, regional and multilateral \r\ncooperation. \r\n Rising to the challenges of our era requires, \r\nwithin each of our countries, a strengthened regulatory \r\nsystem. This does not mean a cumbersome, intrusive \r\nGovernment, but rather a Government that allows \r\nprivate enterprise to thrive, while ensuring that it \r\nremains cognizant of its social responsibilities and \r\nempowers it, in turn, to fulfil those responsibilities. \r\nMany Governments are tackling this challenge, \r\nincluding the Government of the Philippines. Our \r\nAdministration pledges to channel any gains we reap \r\n A/65/PV.15\r\n \r\n27 10-54965 \r\n \r\nfrom public-private partnerships into social services, \r\nlike those in health, education and poverty alleviation. \r\n Across boundaries, the battle against inequality \r\nrequires a balanced approach from those in authority. \r\nWe should be conscious of our responsibilities to our \r\nown people and of our duties to regions and the globe. \r\nAlready we are witnessing a rethinking of traditional \r\nparadigms, a shifting of our focus towards ensuring \r\nthat the global system does not leave anyone behind. \r\n And while my nation continues to benefit from \r\nthe compassion of those who are able to help, this does \r\nnot mean that we or our friends in the developing \r\nworld will be entirely dependent on the largesse of the \r\ndeveloped world. We will not be passive players in our \r\nquest for development. My nation remains active in the \r\nGroup of 77 and in other efforts aimed at enhancing \r\nSouth-South cooperation and articulating and \r\npromoting our collective economic interests. \r\n This is what our people put us in power for. This \r\nis what the world expects of us as leaders — to be \r\nexemplars of what it is to be compassionate human \r\nbeings and vanguards of hope for our common \r\nhumanity. For is not this hope also the hope that unites \r\nus as human beings? It is the same hope that allows us \r\nto break down walls of mistrust, which may take the \r\nform of intolerance, fear or violence. It is the same \r\nhope that leads us to gather in this Hall as our \r\npredecessors did. It is the same hope that will give our \r\ngeneration of leaders the strength to elevate this global \r\nAssembly to a place where, collectively, the nations of \r\nthe world are able to find ways to make a better life \r\npossible for all. \r\n There have been many times in our history when \r\nmy people have shown that, united, nothing is \r\nimpossible. We call it “people power”. It is my earnest \r\nhope and in the greatest interests of humanity that we \r\nharness the energies of dialogue, solidarity and \r\ncommunal responsibility so that a global “people \r\npower” towards equitable progress may be achieved. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly I would like to thank \r\nthe President of the Republic of the Philippines for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n  Mr. Benigno Simeon C. Aquino III, President of \r\nthe Republic of the Philippines, was escorted from \r\nthe General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Filip Vujanović, President of \r\nMontenegro \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nMontenegro.  \r\n  Mr. Filip Vujanović, President of Montenegro, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Filip Vujanović, President of Montenegro, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Vujanović: It is a great pleasure for me \r\nto address this distinctive forum, which continues to \r\nbring together the most responsible people, committed \r\nto achieving and protecting the common good, peace \r\nand stability. This meeting also confirms the \r\nirreplaceable role of the United Nations in the \r\ninternational community and the respect in which it is \r\nheld. \r\n Following the valuable contribution made by the \r\nprevious President of the General Assembly, Mr. Ali \r\nAbdussalam Treki, I would like to welcome the \r\nelection of Joseph Deiss as the President of the \r\nAssembly at its sixty-fifth session, and to wish him \r\nevery success. I also pay special tribute to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his consistent reaffirmation \r\nof the United Nations as an indispensable player in \r\nsolving crucial issues that have long been on the \r\ninternational agenda, which has become more complex \r\nand demanding than ever. \r\n As the youngest Member of the United Nations, \r\nMontenegro has proved itself a reliable partner in the \r\nUnited Nations mission to strive for a world of peace, \r\nsecurity and prosperity for everyone. At the same time, \r\nthanks to United Nations support, Montenegro has \r\nsignificantly enhanced its standing in international \r\norganizations, while ensuring the quality of reforms in \r\nits own State and society. The current improvement in \r\nglobal finances, albeit slight, shows that, in addition to \r\nthe crucial role of the largest and richest countries, \r\nespecially the Group of Eight and the Group of 20, the \r\nUnited Nations is essential to actions undertaken for \r\nthe stabilization of the global economy. \r\n Montenegro supports the pragmatic reform of the \r\nUnited Nations. We also welcome the recent adoption \r\nof General Assembly resolution 64/289 on system-wide \r\nA/65/PV.15  \r\n \r\n10-54965 28 \r\n \r\ncoherence and the timely initiative of Assembly \r\nPresident Joseph Deiss to make the theme of this year’s \r\ngeneral debate the reaffirmation of the central role of \r\nthe United Nations in global governance. \r\n The protection of international peace and stability \r\ncontinues to be a focus of the General Assembly \r\nagenda. Convinced that no progress or stability can be \r\nensured without peace and security, Montenegro \r\nsupports and contributes to the efforts of the United \r\nNations in this regard, affirming the basic principles of \r\nthe United Nations Charter relating to the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes through diplomatic channels. \r\n Mindful of our foreign policy priorities of \r\nEuropean and Euro-Atlantic integration, when \r\nconsidering and taking any concrete action concerning \r\nconflict zones in the framework of the United Nations, \r\nMontenegro harmonizes its policy with European \r\nUnion foreign policy, taking due account of specific \r\nnational interests. We are best able to contribute by \r\ncontinuing to play a constructive role as a stabilizing \r\nfactor in the international community, especially in the \r\nWestern Balkans and South-East Europe. \r\n We strongly support United Nations efforts in \r\nimplementation of the Global Counter-Terrorism \r\nStrategy, and we welcome the idea of more intensive \r\nactivities in the preparation and drafting of a United \r\nNations convention on international terrorism. \r\nMontenegro is of the opinion that only through the \r\ncoordinated efforts of the international community can \r\nglobal terrorism be defeated. We support the various \r\nUnited Nations documents on the fight against \r\ncorruption, organized crime, illicit traffic in narcotic \r\ndrugs and trafficking in human beings. \r\n Montenegro has fully committed itself to \r\nimplementing all international legal instruments \r\nfostering disarmament and arms control. We support \r\nany new constructive initiative aimed at strengthening \r\ninternational cooperation for the reduction and \r\nelimination of all types of arms and lethal weapons. \r\n Montenegro deeply appreciates the importance \r\nand role of the United Nations peacekeeping mission as \r\na unique instrument for the creation and maintenance \r\nof peace and peacebuilding in conflict zones. Decades-\r\nlong experience in peacekeeping operations confirms \r\nthe validity of this concept and the strategic policy of \r\nthe United Nations. Peacekeeping operations have been \r\nsuccessful in reducing the negative effects of conflicts \r\nand preventing their further escalation and disruption \r\nof regional and international peace, stability and \r\nsecurity. \r\n Although a small country — and the youngest \r\nMember of the United Nations — Montenegro fully \r\nassumes its responsibility to contribute to the \r\nmaintenance of peace and stability, as is demonstrated \r\nby our continuously enhanced participation. We will \r\nmake further contributions in line with international \r\nefforts and in keeping with our tradition, the \r\nPrincipality of Montenegro having, as a sovereign \r\nState, participated in the international peacekeeping \r\nmission back in 1897. \r\n Montenegro believes in the crucial importance of \r\nthe Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) and of \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). We are sure that this aim will be furthered by \r\nthe exchange of views and recommendations at the \r\nrecent High-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, and Montenegro supports the \r\nimplementation of all relevant strategies, programmes \r\nand initiatives of the United Nations in this regard. The \r\ncrisis has also brought home to us the necessity of \r\nfurther realizing the sustainable development concept, \r\nwhich requires a balance between economic and social \r\ndevelopment and environmental protection. To this \r\nend, we remain committed to the resolutions of the \r\nUnited Nations and the Commission on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, which have also been fully reflected in \r\nthe Millennium Declaration of 2000. \r\n Montenegro supports the ongoing efforts and \r\nattention of the United Nations to the current \r\nchallenges in Africa. To this end, the fulfilment of the \r\nMDGs and the implementation of all United Nations \r\ndocuments, including the Millennium summit \r\ndecisions, is of crucial importance.  \r\n As a country engaged in the process of European \r\nintegration, Montenegro supports partnership \r\nrelationships between the European Union and Africa, \r\nas well as efforts undertaken to solve development \r\nchallenges and eradicate poverty on the African \r\ncontinent. \r\n In the context of climate change and its adverse \r\neffects, we are fully committed to finding a common \r\nresponse in accordance with the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change. We are \r\ndeeply committed to this end, in view of the effects of \r\nthe natural disasters that occurred in the past year \r\ncausing heavy loss of life and enormous material \r\n A/65/PV.15\r\n \r\n29 10-54965 \r\n \r\ndamage, in particular the earthquake in Haiti and the \r\nfloods in Pakistan. Therefore, a global response and \r\naction is required, and not only at the humanitarian \r\nlevel. Efforts aimed at reducing the effects of natural \r\ndisasters and at the rebuilding and further development \r\nof affected regions and countries are also necessary. \r\n In order to act responsibly with respect to the \r\ncomplex issue of climate change, we have established, \r\ntogether with neighbouring countries and countries \r\nfrom the region, a regional forum in Montenegro which \r\ndeals with the prevention of climate change and related \r\nchallenges at the national and regional levels. \r\n Montenegro is fully dedicated to the promotion \r\nand universal protection of human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms for everyone. We strongly \r\nsupport the activities of the Human Rights Council and \r\nthe Office of the High Commissioner for Human \r\nRights, including their more intensive functional \r\ninteraction with the General Assembly and relevant \r\nCommittees. \r\n We believe in the potential and capacities of the \r\nUnited Nations, especially when strengthened by the \r\nactive participation and robust contributions of each \r\nMember State, to find adequate responses and take \r\nactions aimed at resolving the ever-increasing global \r\nchallenges. As an institution dedicated to individuals \r\nand humankind collectively, which continues to affirm \r\npeace and prosperity, the United Nations remains of \r\nirreplaceable global value, and Montenegro is proud to \r\nbelong to it.  \r\n I assure the Assembly that Montenegro will \r\ncontinue to give its strong support to strengthening and \r\nupholding the United Nations, so that the latter may \r\nimprove its efficiency, responsibility and readiness to \r\nmeet the needs of each Member State. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of Montenegro for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n  Mr. Filip Vujanović, President of Montenegro, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall.  \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, President \r\nof the Republic of Uganda \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Uganda. \r\n  Mr. Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, President of the \r\nRepublic of Uganda, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, President of the \r\nRepublic of Uganda, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\n President Museveni: I did not attend the High-\r\nlevel Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs), as I was not yet in New York. Nevertheless, I \r\nwould like to inform the General Assembly that \r\nUganda will definitely achieve the following MDGs: \r\nGoal 1, on the eradication of extreme poverty and \r\nhunger; Goal 2, on achieving universal primary \r\neducation; Goal 3, on the empowerment of women and \r\nthe promotion of gender equality; Goal 7, on ensuring \r\nenvironmental sustainability; and Goal 8, on creating a \r\nglobal partnership for development. \r\n It is only in the areas of maternal and child health \r\nthat we may not achieve by 2015 the targets set. \r\nHowever, in Uganda, we have developed a national \r\nroad map to accelerate the reduction of maternal and \r\nchild mortality and morbidity, which is a \r\ncomprehensive strategy that clearly spells out our \r\nnational priorities in this area. In this strategy, we have \r\ngiven priority to four key intervention types, namely \r\neffective antenatal care, skilled attendance at birth, \r\nemergency care for women who experience \r\ncomplications in childbirth and family planning. We \r\nhave also given priority to creating infrastructure that \r\nsupports and strengthens the health-care system.  \r\n Regarding MDG 6, Uganda has made tremendous \r\nefforts with respect to HIV/AIDS prevention and \r\ncontrol. We are now renewing our efforts to deal with \r\nthe challenges of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. \r\n It is noteworthy that, overall, Uganda was \r\nrecently ranked among the middle performing \r\ncountries according to the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme’s Human Development \r\nIndex. However, in Uganda, we have never believed in \r\ndonor-anchored responses to the MDGs as a \r\nsustainable solution. Responses to the MDGs should be \r\nanchored in the growth and transformation of the \r\neconomies of the target countries. I am therefore glad \r\nthat the cloud of Afro-pessimism is dispersing. The \r\nopinions of the Afro-pessimists are being consigned to \r\nA/65/PV.15  \r\n \r\n10-54965 30 \r\n \r\nwhere they have always belonged — to the dung-heap \r\nof history.  \r\n Some groups in the West, where Afro-pessimism \r\nabounded in the past, have now started talking of the \r\nAfrican lions, no doubt equating in their minds the \r\nperformance of the African economies with the Asian \r\ntigers of yesteryear. Groups like the McKinsey Global \r\nInstitute are beginning to group the African \r\neconomies — which collectively recorded a growth \r\nrate of 4.9 per cent of gross domestic product in the \r\ngloomy years of the recent global depression, \r\ncompared with the mere 2 per cent of gross domestic \r\nproduct that the countries of the Organization for \r\nEconomic Cooperation and Development recorded in \r\nthe same period — into four categories. Those \r\ncategories are: diversified economies, oil-exporting \r\neconomies, economies in transition and pre-transition \r\neconomies. Uganda was put in the group of transition \r\neconomies.  \r\n Although the McKinsey group needs to improve \r\ntheir statistical base and some of their insights, they are \r\namong the first Western groups to recognize what \r\nwe — who have been working on African issues for a \r\nlong time, on goals we set out to achieve in the years \r\nafter independence — long knew was possible: to make \r\nAfrica move from Third World to First World, in the \r\nwords of Lee Kuan Yew, the former Prime Minister of \r\nSingapore. \r\n Although there are 53 economies of Africa being \r\nmanaged by the respective national authorities, reform \r\ntrends and ideas are sometimes shared. The McKinsey \r\ngroup estimates that the consumption level of Africa, \r\nwhich stood at $860 billion in 2008, will grow to \r\n$1.4 trillion by 2020.  \r\n What one needs to add is the fact that those \r\neconomies have become roaring lions, underdeveloped \r\ninfrastructure notwithstanding. What will happen when \r\nthe infrastructure bottlenecks are resolved? That is the \r\nquestion that one should ask oneself. What will happen \r\nwhen there is cheap and abundant electricity, cheap \r\nroad transport and cheap rail transport? Those areas \r\nhad been neglected for a long time. The study by the \r\nMcKinsey Global Institute revealed that there are now \r\n316 million new mobile phone subscribers since the \r\nyear 2000 in Africa, more than the entire population of \r\nthe United States. In other words, there are now more \r\nmobile phones in Africa than there are American \r\npeople living in the United States.  \r\n There are 600 million hectares of uncultivated \r\narable land in Africa. If our partners could concentrate \r\non assisting infrastructure development, Africa’s \r\ntransition would be that much faster. All the same, a \r\ncountry like Uganda is transitioning. Aid in relevant \r\nsectors is welcome, but even without aid we are \r\nmoving forward. \r\n I know the theme of the general debate is \r\n“Reaffirming the central role of the United Nations in \r\nglobal governance”. In my short address I have not \r\ntalked directly about this. I have instead spoken about \r\nAfrica’s economic reawakening as a roaring lion. Was I \r\nirrelevant? I do not think so. It is those strong building \r\nblocks that will strengthen the United Nations.  \r\n Africa has been a weak link in the chain of the \r\nstruggle for improved governance in the world over the \r\nlast 50 years. Improved economic performance in \r\nAfrica is, therefore, good for the continent and also \r\ngood for the rest of the world. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Uganda for the statement \r\nhe has just made. \r\n  Mr. Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, President of the \r\nRepublic of Uganda, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Choummaly Sayasone, President of \r\nthe Lao People’s Democratic Republic \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Lao People’s Democratic Republic. \r\n  Mr. Choummaly Sayasone, President of the Lao \r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic, was escorted into \r\nthe General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Choummaly Sayasone, President of the Lao \r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly. \r\n President Sayasone (spoke in Lao; interpretation \r\nprovided by the delegation): At the outset, I would like \r\nto extend my sincere congratulations to His Excellency \r\nMr. Joseph Deiss on his election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. I am fully \r\nconfident that with his vast experience he will be able \r\n A/65/PV.15\r\n \r\n31 10-54965 \r\n \r\nto lead this session to great success. May I also \r\ncommend His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdulssalam Treki, \r\nPresident of the Assembly at its sixty-fourth session, \r\nfor his effective leadership. I would also like to \r\napplaud Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \r\nleadership in fulfilling effectively the various duties \r\nand tasks mandated to address the current emerging \r\nchallenges and constraints. \r\n The global state of affairs today has undergone \r\nrapid change and become more complex, offering both \r\nopportunities and challenges. Global and regional \r\npeace and security are threatened by conflicts and \r\narmed confrontation. Severe and unprecedented natural \r\ndisasters have become a regular phenomenon that we \r\nhave to live with. The tragedies caused by natural \r\ncatastrophes, such as in Haiti, China, Pakistan and \r\nelsewhere, have intensified and are coupled with the \r\neconomic crisis that we are already facing. \r\n No one can deny that those calamities and \r\nchallenges are mostly the result of our own human \r\naction. National challenges have gone beyond national \r\nboundaries and become matters of international \r\nconcern, matters that a single country or even a group \r\nof countries cannot overcome alone. Therefore it is the \r\nfull responsibility of the international community as a \r\nwhole to tackle them. \r\n Against that backdrop, it is time for us to fully \r\nrealize all the promises and commitments that we have \r\nmade. The United Nations reform process, which has \r\nbeen pending through past decades, should continue in \r\na more concrete manner with a view to ensuring mutual \r\nbenefits for all Member States. The reform should also \r\nseek to ensure a relevant and effective role for the \r\nUnited Nations as the only universal body addressing \r\nglobal challenges. To achieve those objectives, it is \r\ncritical that all Member States enhance cooperation in \r\na sincere and trustworthy manner and avoid taking \r\nadvantage of one another. \r\n Peace and stability are still threatened by \r\nweapons of mass destruction, especially nuclear \r\nweapons. The results of the Review Conference of the \r\nParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons held in May this year did not by any \r\nmeans meet our expectations in addressing the non-\r\nproliferation of nuclear weapons and making our world \r\nfree of nuclear weapons. Consensus is far from being \r\nreached due to manifest suspicion and distrust. \r\nTherefore it is time to build trust and confidence in \r\norder to create an enabling international environment \r\nfor a nuclear-free world. \r\n The use and proliferation of weapons of all forms \r\nundoubtedly have a long-term impact on the lives of \r\npeople and impede national socio-economic \r\ndevelopment efforts. The Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic is still badly suffering the consequences of \r\nwars that ended several decades ago. \r\n The legacies of the Indochina war include a huge \r\namount of remnants and unexploded ordnance, which \r\nhave continued to kill and injure innocent people. That \r\nis a major obstacle to the possibility of an ordinary \r\ndaily life for the Lao people. Over 30 per cent of Lao \r\nsoil is heavily contaminated by unexploded ordnance, \r\nand that is a major constraint and challenge in the \r\ncountry’s efforts to achieve its national socio-economic \r\nobjectives and to attain the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). \r\n The Convention on Cluster Munitions, which \r\nentered into force on 1 August 2010, is a result of the \r\nclose cooperation and shared commitment of the \r\ninternational community to put an end to the serious \r\nimpact of cluster bombs and to thus free people from \r\nthat danger. As the country most affected by \r\nunexploded ordnance, especially cluster munitions, it is \r\na great source of pride for the Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic to have played an active part in the Oslo \r\nprocess, which led to the adoption of this Convention. \r\nWe will continue to cooperate closely with the \r\ninternational community to ensure that it is fully \r\nimplemented. \r\n In that context, it is a great honour for the Lao \r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic to host the First Meeting \r\nof States Parties to the Convention on Cluster \r\nMunitions in Vientiane from 8 to 12 November 2010. \r\nThat event that will be an important milestone for the \r\nOslo process and provide an opportunity for the \r\ninternational community to reaffirm its strong \r\ndetermination to address the challenges caused by \r\ncluster munitions. The First Meeting of States Parties \r\nwill offer us an excellent occasion to chart a clear \r\nvision and adopt appropriate mechanisms to ensure the \r\neffective implementation of the Convention. On that \r\nnote, once again I would like to extend my \r\nGovernment’s cordial invitation to all United Nations \r\nMember States, international organizations and \r\nnon-governmental organizations to participate and play \r\nA/65/PV.15  \r\n \r\n10-54965 32 \r\n \r\nan active part in the discussions and ensure the \r\nsuccessful outcome of the Meeting. \r\n Regional peace and security remain critical for \r\nensuring global peace. We share a common concern \r\nover the situation in the Middle East, which has caused \r\ngreat suffering and immense loss of lives and property \r\nin the region, especially for the Palestinian people. It is \r\nmy fervent hope that the resumption of peace talks \r\nbetween Israel and Palestine, with the participation of \r\nthe United States, will lead to a solution and the \r\nrealization of the vision of two States, Israel and \r\nPalestine, living side by side in peace and security and \r\nwithin internationally recognized borders, as stipulated \r\nin the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. \r\n The Republic of Cuba is a sovereign and \r\npolitically stable State that has enjoyed peace and \r\nsecurity for several decades. Nevertheless, for over \r\nhalf of a century, the people of Cuba have been \r\naffected by the economic, trade and financial embargo \r\nimposed on them by the United States. Indeed, such an \r\nembargo constitutes a clear violation of the United \r\nNations Charter and international law. Therefore, in \r\norder to respond to the legitimate interests of the two \r\ncountries and peoples — Cuba and the United States — \r\nthe embargo should now be lifted. \r\n The cooperation among South-East Asian \r\ncountries has been steadily expanding. The Association \r\nof Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has set the \r\nobjective for 2015 of building our community with \r\nthree pillars, namely, the ASEAN Political-Security \r\nCommunity, the ASEAN Economic Community and \r\nASEAN Socio-Cultural Community. To attain that \r\nobjective, ASEAN has laid an important socio-\r\neconomic foundation, including the Free Trade Area \r\namong ASEAN countries as well as Free Trade Areas \r\nbetween ASEAN and China, ASEAN and the Republic \r\nof Korea, ASEAN and Japan, and ASEAN and \r\nAustralia-New Zealand. \r\n Furthermore, the ASEAN Master Plan on \r\nconnectivity will be adopted at the Seventeenth \r\nASEAN Summit, to be held in Hanoi in October 2010 \r\nto support the ASEAN Free Trade Area. The successful \r\ncooperation within ASEAN has contributed to the \r\neffort to narrow the development gap within ASEAN as \r\nwell as between ASEAN and other countries. It also \r\nhelps the ASEAN countries attain the MDGs. \r\n While the world is facing a financial and \r\neconomic crisis, coupled with various natural \r\ncalamities, the most impacted are the least developed \r\ncountries (LDCs), the poor and the vulnerable in the \r\nsociety. The international community’s main objective \r\nin attaining the MDGs is to ensure that the lives of the \r\npoor and disadvantaged are improved and that the \r\nnumber of LDCs is reduced. That would demonstrate \r\nthat we can achieve the MDGs.  \r\n In that context, the ten-year review of the \r\nimplementation of the Brussels Programme of Action \r\nfor LDCs, to be held in 2011, is crucial. We will assess \r\nwhether the seven commitments that we endorsed \r\ntogether in 2001 have been fulfilled. In that \r\nconnection, I commend the Secretary-General for \r\nsetting up a group of eminent persons on least \r\ndeveloped countries to advise on support for LDCs. \r\n The year 2010 is of great significance for the Lao \r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic. Our country has \r\ncompleted the implementation of the Sixth Five Year \r\nSocio-Economic Development Plan and has already \r\nstarted the preparation for the Seventh Plan, for 2011-\r\n2015. Over the past years, our socio-economic \r\ndevelopment has been steadily progressing. The \r\neconomy has grown at an average rate of seven per \r\ncent annually, poverty has continuously declined, and \r\nthe living standard of the multi-ethnic Lao people has \r\ngradually improved. All that success has been due to \r\nthe right policy and the timely measures undertaken by \r\nthe Government. The decisive factor in creating an \r\nenabling environment for socio-economic development \r\nin the Lao People’s Democratic Republic is political \r\nstability and social order that our nation has enjoyed \r\nover the past three decades. \r\n Nevertheless, to a certain extent, the Lao People’s \r\nDemocratic Republic remains challenged by the global \r\nfinancial and economic crisis, and that is contributing \r\nto the decline of our economic growth. Against that \r\nbackdrop, the Government has adopted immediate \r\nmeasures that have helped to alleviate the impact of the \r\ncrisis. \r\n However, due to the uncertainty of the state of \r\ntoday’s global economy, like other developing \r\ncountries, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic is \r\nstill vulnerable, and thus requires the assistance and \r\nsupport of the international community in addressing \r\nthe impact of the crisis over the long term. Such \r\nassistance will help the country overcome any future \r\nproblem resulting from the current crisis, enable us to \r\n A/65/PV.15\r\n \r\n33 10-54965 \r\n \r\nachieve the MDGs and, ultimately, leave the status of \r\nleast developed country by 2020. \r\n The Lao People’s Democratic Republic reiterates \r\nonce again its firm commitment and willingness to \r\nwork closely with the international community to build \r\na peaceful world under a just and more democratic new \r\norder, based on cooperation with all countries, in \r\ntackling the various global challenges facing us. I am \r\nconvinced that only through genuine partnership will \r\nwe be able to ensure that the world is secure, peaceful \r\nand prosperous. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic for \r\nthe statement he has just made. \r\n  Mr. Choummaly Sayasone, President of the Lao \r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic, was escorted from \r\nthe General Assembly Hall.  \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Marcus Stephen, President of the \r\nRepublic of Nauru \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly with now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Nauru. \r\n  Mr. Marcus Stephen, President of the Republic of \r\nNauru, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency Mr. \r\nMarcus Stephen, President of the Republic of Nauru, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.  \r\n President Stephen: I would like to offer my \r\nheartfelt congratulations to the President of the \r\nAssembly on his assumption of the presidency of this \r\nbody at its sixty-fifth session. Also, allow me to \r\ncommend his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Ali \r\nAbdussalam Treki, for his capable leadership during \r\nthe sixty-fourth session. \r\n This week is vitally important for my island \r\nnation of Nauru and for small island developing States \r\ngenerally. This week we will complete the high-level \r\nreviews of the Millennium Development Goals and the \r\nMauritius Strategy, two programmes that are central to \r\nthe sustainable development prospects of my country.  \r\n We gather here on this occasion to reaffirm the \r\ncentral role of the United Nations in global \r\ngovernance. However, the centrality of the United \r\nNations system must derive from its ability to help \r\nbring about positive outcomes for all of its \r\nmembership. In that regard, the United Nations report \r\ncard is mixed. \r\n While this body and others have brought attention \r\nto the unique and particular vulnerabilities of small \r\nisland developing States, they have not always \r\nsucceeded in delivering concrete benefits. There is a \r\nproliferation of global action plans but a paucity of \r\naction. For this reason, Nauru has relied more on its \r\ndomestic institutions and bilateral partners than on \r\nmultilateral governance solutions. \r\n Nauru turned a corner in 2005 when it adopted its \r\nNational Sustainable Development Strategy, commonly \r\nknown to us as our NSDS. Under that plan we have \r\nmade significant progress across most sectors. Our \r\nfinancial system is now more transparent and \r\nGovernment more accountable. Most importantly, we \r\nhave restored some measures of security for our \r\ncitizens: expanded public health programmes, new and \r\nrefurbished schools, updated curriculum and more \r\nteachers. Power is more reliable and its usage more \r\nefficient. Regular air and maritime travel has been \r\nrestored, and we have seen major improvements in our \r\ncommunications system. \r\n Most of the gains in the past five years have been \r\nthe result of our own efforts, largely supported by \r\nbilateral development partners targeting our national \r\nplans. However, our journey is far from over. Our \r\nNSDS lays out a clear path forward to aid \r\nindependence based on our national circumstances and \r\ncapacity. Its medium- and long-term milestones are \r\nfully consistent with, and complementary to, the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and Mauritius Strategy \r\nprogrammes. It is my hope that the United Nations can \r\nplay a more significant role in this next phase of our \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n Five years after our initial request, I am pleased \r\nthat the United Nations has opened its joint presence \r\noffice in Nauru. It is my hope that that will enable \r\nUnited Nations agencies to be more familiar with, and \r\nresponsive to, our unique development challenges. \r\n The future of all my people depends on an \r\neffective United Nations system, but none more so than \r\nthe future of our youth. Not long ago, my country \r\nA/65/PV.15  \r\n \r\n10-54965 34 \r\n \r\nsuffered a devastating economic crisis. It was followed \r\nby the explosion in global fuel and food prices and \r\nthen by the global economic downturn, which many of \r\nus are still grappling with today. Those crises were \r\nexacerbated by virtue of Nauru being a small and \r\nisolated island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. As a \r\ncountry, we will overcome. However, some impacts \r\nwill be felt longer than others. \r\n Perhaps the cruellest legacy of our economic \r\ncrisis is the impact it had on the youth who grew up \r\nduring that trying time. Advantages that my generation \r\ntook for granted — a good education, basic health care \r\nand abundant job opportunities — were simply not \r\navailable for many of our youth during a critical period \r\nin their lives. In the absence of such advantages, \r\nsubstance abuse, illiteracy, delinquency and lifestyle-\r\nrelated illnesses became commonplace. As we progress \r\nas a nation, we must ensure that we do not leave one \r\nsegment of our community behind. Our collective \r\nfuture will not be secure unless we invest in the \r\ncommunity and business leaders of tomorrow. \r\n It is for this reason that Nauru appreciates the \r\nimportance of the International Year of Youth, which \r\ncommenced in August 2010. This United Nations \r\ntradition began 25 years ago when this body \r\nrecognized the profoundly important role that youth \r\nshould have in shaping a new international economic \r\norder based on equity and justice. \r\n My Government has made investing in our youth \r\na top priority. Nauru is on track to reach our \r\nMillennium Development Goal of universal primary \r\neducation by 2015. We have been successful despite \r\nthe significant shortage of quality Nauruan teachers.  \r\n Of equal importance to the development of our \r\nprimary and secondary education systems is the need to \r\ndevelop technical and vocational training, recognizing \r\nand certifying skills and job-oriented training. Only by \r\ncontinued investment in human resource development \r\nwill the next generation of Nauruans be prepared for \r\nthe challenges of the twenty-first century. \r\n Our health sector, too, has made gains in curative \r\nservices and preventative health programmes. \r\nHowever, around 75 per cent of people in the Pacific \r\nsuffer from non-communicable diseases. That is not \r\nsustainable. Investments in public health must be \r\naccompanied by investments in improving food \r\nsecurity. It will be difficult to change that alarming \r\nstatistic for the better unless my people have a reliable \r\nsupply of affordable and nutritious food. Health \r\neducation must also receive more emphasis in our \r\neducational programmes. \r\n Education and public health are obviously two \r\nareas that are fundamental for the well-being of our \r\nyouth, but alone they are not enough. Our youth must \r\nalso be given the opportunity to use their skills in \r\nproductive ways, lest those skills wither on the vine. \r\nFor that we need a growing economy, and for a \r\ngrowing economy we must look to our development \r\npartners and multilateral institutions for assistance. \r\n Aid should be deployed so as to build a \r\nfoundation for sustainable development in all economic \r\nsectors, including basic infrastructure, in which to date \r\nthere has been less progress than in health and \r\neducation. The re-establishment of banking and \r\nfinancial services continues to elude us despite all our \r\nurgent efforts to obtain assistance. Nation-building and \r\nyouth development must run parallel to each other if \r\neither is to succeed. Investments in basic infrastructure \r\nwill enable us to expand our economic base, increase \r\nexports and also reduce the costs of imports. \r\n The United Nations system must also be \r\nenhanced in order to avoid the mistakes of the past. \r\nThat is why we are joining others in calling for the \r\ncreation of a formal small island developing States \r\n(SIDS) category within the United Nations system.  \r\n The international community has consistently \r\nrecognized the unique vulnerabilities of the small \r\nisland developing States, yet that recognition has not \r\nbeen translated into effective action. The preparatory \r\nwork for the five-year review of the Mauritius Strategy \r\nfor the Further Implementation of the Programme of \r\nAction for the Sustainable Development of Small \r\nIsland Developing States found that the vulnerabilities \r\nof SIDS remain and that progress towards sustainable \r\ndevelopment is far below expectations. It is clear that \r\nbusiness as usual is not working and that a new \r\napproach is long overdue. \r\n The creation of a new SIDS category would make \r\nthe United Nations more responsive to the particular \r\nneeds of small islands. This new category should be \r\naccompanied by structural support mechanisms in the \r\nareas of development assistance, financial support and \r\ntrade. Only by dealing with the vulnerabilities of SIDS \r\ncan there be any realistic prospect of SIDS attaining \r\nsustainable economic growth. \r\n A/65/PV.15\r\n \r\n35 10-54965 \r\n \r\n The most important test of our commitment to \r\nour youth is the state of the world that we leave to \r\nthem. We have long been aware of the environmental \r\ncrises currently facing our oceans and our climate, but \r\nwe have done precious little to address them. Without \r\nimmediate and aggressive international action on both \r\nfronts, we will bequeath to our children a world that is \r\nfar poorer than the one we ourselves inhabited. \r\n Nauru takes these threats very seriously, which is \r\nwhy my country, along with other island countries in \r\nthe Pacific, recently strengthened the Nauru \r\nAgreement. That multilateral agreement on oceans \r\ngovernance is a major step in strengthening an \r\neffective regime for managing and protecting regional \r\ntuna stocks. The preservation of that resource is \r\nessential to our region’s food security and to our \r\neconomic development. Regrettably, the sustainability \r\nof the tuna stocks and other marine resources that we \r\nrely on is threatened by actions beyond our control. \r\nIllegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and \r\noverfishing by large fishing nations is rife in the \r\nPacific, and we lack sufficient resources to respond to \r\nthat criminal activity. One of the pillars of our \r\neconomic future is literally being stolen from our \r\nchildren. \r\n With regard to climate change, my island and \r\nmany others like it face an existential threat far beyond \r\nour capacity to adapt. Rising sea levels and extreme \r\nweather may one day render my home uninhabitable. \r\nBut an island can die long before it has disappeared \r\nbeneath the sea. All that is required is to deprive its \r\nyouth of hope. What incentive will they have to invest \r\nin their home if it will not be there for when they are \r\nolder? We have an opportunity to change course later \r\nthis year at the United Nations Climate Change \r\nConference to be held in Cancún. We must act as if our \r\nchildren’s future depended on the decisions we make. \r\n Climate change is a global issue and demands the \r\nfull participation of all. We therefore call on the \r\nimmediate inclusion of Taiwan in the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) \r\nprocess. We must also recognize that climate change \r\nposes many threats — security threats — that are not \r\naddressed under the UNFCCC process. That is why the \r\nPacific small island developing States introduced in the \r\nGeneral Assembly a resolution on climate change and \r\nits possible security implications (resolution 63/281). \r\nThe Security Council, as the primary body of the \r\nUnited Nations entrusted with preserving international \r\npeace and security, must also play its role. \r\n Lastly, we must ensure that the views and \r\nperspectives of all nations and peoples are incorporated \r\ninto the decision-making of the United Nations system \r\nand its specialized agencies. In that context, Nauru \r\nstrongly supports Taiwan’s campaign for meaningful \r\nparticipation in the International Civil Aviation \r\nOrganization. \r\n I would like to conclude by thanking our \r\ndevelopment partners for their long-standing \r\ncommitment to Nauru, particularly our major \r\npartners — Australia, Taiwan, the Russia Federation, \r\nNew Zealand, the European Union and Japan — as \r\nwell as our many other active partners, including Cuba, \r\nItaly, India, the Republic of Korea and Israel. We \r\nfurther recognize the international and regional \r\norganizations that have continued to stand by our side \r\nduring a difficult period in our history, and I look \r\nforward to our continuing cooperation. \r\n I would also like to commend the United Nations \r\nfor beginning a difficult process of reflection and \r\nreform so as to be able to more effectively respond to \r\nthe global challenges we all face. Nauru looks forward \r\nto participating in this important discussion so that the \r\nUnited Nations can continue to play a central role in \r\nglobal governance. \r\n May God bless the Republic of Nauru and may \r\nGod bless the United Nations.  \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Nauru for the statement he \r\nhas just made. \r\n  Mr. Marcus Stephen, President of Republic of \r\nNauru, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.  \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Valdis Zatlers, President of the \r\nRepublic of Latvia \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Latvia. \r\n  Mr. Valdis Zatlers, President of the Republic of \r\nLatvia, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\nA/65/PV.15  \r\n \r\n10-54965 36 \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Valdis Zatlers, President of the Republic of Latvia, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Zatlers: Allow me at the outset to \r\ncongratulate Mr. Deiss on assuming the post of \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at the current \r\nsession. I pledge him Latvia’s full support. \r\n Sixty-five years ago, the United Nations was \r\ncreated on the ashes of the bloodiest war in the history \r\nof mankind as an international forum where all nations \r\nmeet as equals, willing to address international \r\nchallenges and to prevent the scourge of war. Since \r\nthen it has become the most broadly representative \r\nbody of nations focused on promoting security, peace \r\nand prosperity all over the world. \r\n This year also marks the twentieth anniversary of \r\nLatvia’s freedom, regained after 50 years of Soviet \r\noccupation, oppression and injustice. Latvia’s story \r\nshows that the values enshrined in the Charter are \r\nuniversal and, with the people’s persistence and \r\ncommon vision, can come alive, even if it takes \r\ndecades. It also shows that it is possible to overcome \r\neven the deepest of divisions. It shows that, while \r\nhonouring our history, we can extend a hand of \r\ncooperation and look into the future with hope. \r\n There are many global issues that need our real \r\nattention and require urgent action. Just a few days ago \r\nwe renewed our commitment to development at the \r\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). While important \r\nimprovements have been made globally, progress \r\ntowards achieving the MDGs by 2015 has not been \r\nsufficient. If we are serious about achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, we need to show \r\ncommitment and action. \r\n A new consciousness is emerging from the \r\nawareness of the negative impact of climate change. \r\nClimate change is a fact. We are witnessing a rising \r\nnumber of storms, excessive rainfall and atypical \r\ntemperatures, which lead to flooding, forest fires and \r\ncrop failures. All those disasters have an immense \r\nmaterial cost and claim people’s lives, and therefore \r\nthey should be treated as a serious security threat. The \r\nresponse must be twofold. We have to adapt to the \r\nchanges already in place and to those we will face in \r\nthe coming decades. And most importantly, we have to \r\nwork on preventive measures, such as the reduction of \r\nemissions. \r\n We have a road ahead of us on the issue of \r\nclimate change, and every country has to contribute if \r\nour actions on it are to be successful. Within the \r\nframework of the Copenhagen Accord, Latvia, among \r\nother European Union member States, is providing \r\nassistance that, along with financial contributions from \r\nother key players, helps developing countries fight \r\nclimate change. We must make the next step in \r\nCancún. We have to agree on global action to address \r\nclimate change. The future of the next generation is at \r\nstake. \r\n While we are working for long-term goals, we \r\nalso have to address immediate crises wherever they \r\noccur. The international community, with the United \r\nNations in the leading role, has been addressing \r\nhumanitarian needs following the devastating flooding \r\nin Pakistan, which has affected more than 14 million \r\npeople. This year we also witnessed a terrible \r\nearthquake in Haiti. Latvia, despite its economic \r\nchallenges, was able to respond to those international \r\nemergency humanitarian needs, both through the \r\nUnited Nations Central Emergency Response Fund and \r\nthrough additional pledges of €150,000 for Haiti’s \r\nrecovery. We will continue to help countries affected \r\nby such tragic disasters. \r\n Latvia has always supported the strengthening of \r\nthe United Nations as the only truly global \r\ninternational organization. However, in a time of \r\nglobalization and rapid development, the need for \r\nreform is an inevitable reality. We must therefore \r\ncontinuously seek maximum effectiveness and \r\nefficiency in the work of the United Nations in order to \r\ndeliver results worthy of this Organization. A Security \r\nCouncil that reflects the realities of the twenty-first \r\ncentury would be a significant step towards a more \r\neffective United Nations. We sincerely hope for a faster \r\npace for the reform process. \r\n We commend the work of the United Nations in \r\nthe promotion of gender equality and welcome the \r\ncreation of a unified gender entity. I would like to \r\ncongratulate the new head of the United Nations Entity \r\nfor Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women, \r\nthe former Chilean President Mrs. Michelle Bachelet, \r\non her appointment and to wish her every success in \r\nthat highly important post.  \r\n A/65/PV.15\r\n \r\n37 10-54965 \r\n \r\n This fall we also mark the tenth anniversary of \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women and \r\npeace and security. We see it as an opportunity to \r\nreview implementation of the resolution with a view to \r\nidentifying best practices and challenges, particularly \r\nregarding equal participation of women in decision-\r\nmaking and the eradication of all types of gender-based \r\nviolence, especially in conflict situations. \r\n At this session we have a very important task \r\nahead of us: reviewing the work of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. The Council has already shown itself capable \r\nof addressing many human rights situations and of \r\nadvancing human rights. I particularly wish to \r\nhighlight the independent work of the special \r\nprocedures and the establishment of the universal \r\nperiodic review mechanism. However, improvements \r\nare still necessary. I am confident that with goodwill, \r\nand with participation and input from all of us, the \r\nreview process will lead to a strengthened institution \r\nwith increased credibility and greater impact on the \r\nimprovement of human rights.  \r\n Latvia has always placed the promotion of human \r\nrights among its top priorities. We have therefore put \r\nforward our candidacy for the Human Rights Council \r\nfor the year 2014. \r\n The role of the United Nations in maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security is irreplaceable. We \r\nmust continue to work with all the means at our \r\ndisposal to create a more stable world. Latvia \r\nappreciates the positive momentum that was created at \r\nthe Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference \r\nearlier this year. Stabilizing and strengthening a \r\nnuclear non-proliferation regime is a shared \r\nresponsibility of all United Nations Members. As a \r\nmember of the international community, Latvia \r\nexpresses the hope that every diplomatic opportunity \r\nwill be used to find a comprehensive long-term \r\nsolution to the Iranian and North Korean nuclear \r\nissues. \r\n The New START treaty between the United \r\nStates and Russian Federation sets a powerful and \r\nremarkable example of real steps to reduce the threat of \r\nstrategic arms and to engage other Powers in fulfilling \r\nthe goals of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Latvia firmly \r\nsupports the nuclear security discussion initiated by \r\nPresident Obama. Promising signs on the international \r\nagenda have positively influenced European security \r\nand fostered the debate on conventional regimes in \r\nEurope. An ambitious road map is before us, and \r\ntogether we should all move forward to strengthen \r\nsecurity around the world. \r\n Stability and security in a number of regions \r\nremain on the international agenda. In the Middle East, \r\nthe international community must encourage the parties \r\nto move towards real compromises leading to a \r\ncomprehensive settlement of the conflict. Common \r\nefforts of the international community, including the \r\nQuartet, and the unity of Arab States are decisive to \r\nensure continuation of the peace process with a very \r\nclear final aim of establishing an independent, \r\ndemocratic and viable Palestinian State living side by \r\nside in peace with the State of Israel. \r\n We welcome the launch of direct negotiations \r\nbetween Israel and the Palestinian Authority and \r\ncommend all involved partners for their efforts. \r\nSustainable and durable solutions for Gaza, Palestinian \r\nreconciliation, and extension of the settlement \r\nmoratorium are crucial for the Palestinian State-\r\nbuilding process. We sincerely hope that the talks will \r\ncontinue in a constructive manner and be supplemented \r\nby negotiations on the Israel-Syria and Israel-Lebanon \r\ntracks towards comprehensive peace and stability in \r\nthe Middle East. \r\n A week ago the people of Afghanistan voted for \r\ntheir new parliament. The elections showed that the \r\nAfghanis are determined to build a peaceful and \r\nprosperous country that is at peace with its neighbours. \r\nWe commend the work done by the Independent \r\nElectoral Commission. The elections were conducted \r\nin a difficult security and political environment. It is of \r\nthe highest importance that the Government of \r\nAfghanistan corrects the irregularities caused by the \r\nharsh environment.  \r\n The international community plays a substantial \r\nrole in coordinating civilian efforts in Afghanistan. The \r\nwork of the Secretary-General’s Special Representative \r\nmust be commended. The recently released Mid Year \r\nReport 2010 Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict \r\nis worrisome and shows how much work remains to be \r\ndone to improve the situation.  \r\n To be successful in Afghanistan, one should not \r\nforget the regional aspect of the issue. Stability in \r\nCentral Asia is an important factor for success in \r\nAfghanistan.  \r\nA/65/PV.15  \r\n \r\n10-54965 38 \r\n \r\n We are satisfied to see that the Kabul process is \r\nunder way and that the Government of Afghanistan is \r\nresolved to act in order to regain the trust of the \r\nAfghan people and to align the support of the \r\ninternational community behind the goals of national \r\ndevelopment. A well-coordinated effort is necessary to \r\nfollow up the Kabul commitments so that in 2014 the \r\nGovernment of Afghanistan will be able to take full \r\nresponsibility for the governance of the country. Latvia \r\nis therefore putting more emphasis on training Afghan \r\nsecurity forces, both army and police. In June, Latvia \r\ncarried out a training project for Afghan police officers \r\nin the field of criminal investigation.  \r\n Another important task is to foster Afghanistan’s \r\neconomic and social development. Regional \r\ncooperation can be very useful in that effort, especially \r\nwith regard to energy and transport infrastructure. \r\nLatvia envisions multiple transport corridors \r\nconnecting Afghanistan to the neighbouring region, as \r\nwell as to Europe. \r\n I would like to refer to the European Union as an \r\nimportant partner of the United Nations. The United \r\nNations and the European Union share the same \r\nfundamental values — freedom, democracy, rule of \r\nlaw, human rights, equality and tolerance. It is our duty \r\nto work together to ensure that those values are not just \r\nwords but something to be enjoyed daily by everybody. \r\n The European Union has been changed through \r\nthe Lisbon Treaty. We hope that that change will give \r\nthe European Union a clearer voice in relations with \r\nour partners, including the United Nations. I hope that \r\nagreement will soon be reached to ensure the European \r\nUnion’s effective participation in the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n Finally, I would like to touch on the economic \r\nslowdown in the global economy during the past \r\ncouple of years. Latvia was one of the countries hit \r\nhardest by the crisis. Now Latvia’s economy is \r\nshowing signs of recovery. We have seen positive \r\ntrends in macroeconomic indicators since the \r\nbeginning of the year. We are on the way up. \r\n The reason for our recovery is the tough fiscal \r\nadjustment that Latvia has demonstrated since 2008. I \r\nam certain that other countries will need to go through \r\nconsiderable budgetary consolidation soon. Our \r\nexperience shows that it is possible, but only with the \r\nfull understanding and support of the population. \r\nLatvia has carried out large-scale reforms, and we are \r\nready to share our experience. That is one of the \r\nreasons why Latvia has put forward its candidature in \r\nthis year’s elections to the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil. \r\n Prudence will be a key element to prevent future \r\neconomic crises, but not the only one. Global financial \r\ngovernance will be another such element. Latvia \r\ncommends the role and leadership shown by the Group \r\nof Twenty (G-20) countries. Financial governance \r\nshould be global, and we highly value the initiatives \r\nput forward towards that end by the G-20, international \r\nfinancial institutions and other forums. \r\n The world is entering the second decade of the \r\ntwenty-first century, and there are challenges to \r\nsecurity, peace and prosperity. They can be met only by \r\na common effort and the unity of mankind. I wish us \r\nall the wisdom and courage to maintain the higher \r\ninterest in the common good. Latvia looks forward to a \r\nfruitful sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Latvia for the statement he \r\nhas just made. \r\n  Mr. Valdis Zatlers, President of the Republic of \r\nLatvia, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Gjorge Ivanov, President of the \r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. \r\n  Mr. Gjorge Ivanov, President of the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, was escorted \r\ninto the General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Gjorge Ivanov, President of the former Yugoslav \r\nRepublic of Macedonia, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly. \r\n President Ivanov (spoke in Macedonian; English \r\ntext provided by the delegation): It is a privilege and a \r\ngreat honour for me today to address this unique forum \r\nwhere great and small, powerful and less powerful \r\nnations speak with one voice; a forum we undoubtedly \r\nexpect to result in dialogue and leadership in order to \r\n A/65/PV.15\r\n \r\n39 10-54965 \r\n \r\ndeal with the challenges to peace and security, hunger \r\nand development, human rights and climate change. \r\nSuccess will be possible only by overcoming \r\nindividual interests. I am convinced that today more \r\nthan ever, each of us individually and all of us together \r\nhave reasons to turn our words into actions. \r\n Let me first congratulate Mr. Joseph Deiss on his \r\nelection as the President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-fifth session and assure him of my delegation’s \r\nreadiness to cooperate during his term. I also \r\ncongratulate the former President, Mr. Treki, on \r\nsuccessfully presiding over the Assembly at its sixty-\r\nfourth session. At the same time I would like to take \r\nthis opportunity to acknowledge the engagement and \r\nthe efforts made by the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon, to strengthen the role of our Organization. \r\n At the outset, I would like to say a few words on \r\nthe consequences of the global financial and economic \r\ncrisis, and I will refer in particular to the role of the \r\nUnited Nations in this context. \r\n The global economic and financial crisis \r\nthreatened to reverse the progress made in achieving \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and \r\nefforts to attain peace in all regions. I think that all we \r\nMember States and the United Nations system in \r\ngeneral successfully dealt with it. Timely, joint and \r\nadequate solutions were found to many of the \r\nproblems. Processes were initiated to mitigate the \r\neffects of the crisis and to face possible future crises. \r\nActions were taken to help the most affected, \r\naccording to the agreed action plans and with \r\nappropriate support and cooperation, often resulting in \r\nsuccessful outcomes. Let us not forget that economic, \r\nfinancial and social security is a foundation on which \r\nsustainable development, national and global security \r\nand prosperity rest. \r\n Five years remain before the deadline for the \r\nimplementation and realization of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. That objective is still before us — \r\nan objective we must not give up on achieving now, \r\ndespite the decelerated pace of implementation. We are \r\nall aware of the high stakes and potential benefits. I \r\nwelcome the outcome of the High-level Plenary \r\nMeeting on the Millennium Development Goals held \r\nlast week, when we all pledged to strengthen our \r\nefforts to attain the ultimate goal. \r\n The Republic of Macedonia, as before, remains \r\nstrongly committed to achieving the Goals, as reflected \r\nat the national level in the Government’s strategy for \r\neconomic and sustainable development and in national \r\nlegislation, which is adapted to the current obligations \r\nderiving from international treaties and agreements. \r\n On the other hand, global climate change is both \r\na serious threat to our planet and survival. Frequent \r\nnatural disasters and humanitarian catastrophes have \r\nmade it clear that nature reacts to the irresponsible \r\nattitude that humankind has adopted towards it. \r\nHowever, the struggle to preserve nature must not only \r\nbe a matter of declarations; it must enjoy global \r\nleadership and be visible in every small town, every \r\nState, and the strict observance and development of \r\nnational strategies. Successful formulas must be \r\ntransformed into in a common global struggle to \r\npreserve our way of life, side by side with the needs of \r\nthe planet. \r\n The Republic of Macedonia stands ready to \r\ncontribute adequately to the global efforts. Many \r\ninitiatives have been undertaken. We are truly focused \r\non the best possible weapons in this struggle: \r\nawareness-raising and education on and a culture of \r\nreducing the use of electricity by using alternative \r\nenergy sources and reductions in harmful emissions. As \r\na party to the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change for over a decade, my country has \r\nworked actively to achieve the Convention’s \r\nobjectives. \r\n Unfortunately, the world still does not live in the \r\ndesired peace and prosperity. Unfortunately, every day \r\nwe continue to witness disturbances to peace and \r\nsecurity in certain regions in the world, both in old and \r\nfrozen conflicts and in the emergence of new tensions \r\nin several regions in the world. If the fundamental \r\ninstitutional goal and essential objective of this \r\nOrganization is to spare humanity from suffering, wars \r\nand conflicts, then we should ask ourselves whether \r\nour efforts have been sufficient to secure peace and \r\nprosperity. The answer is no, neither globally nor \r\nregionally. \r\n The consequences of the global financial and \r\neconomic crisis and the slow pace of implementation \r\nof the MDGs have had a serious impact on the essence \r\nof conflicts, often because of a lack of democratic \r\nprocesses and rule of law in certain areas. Only by \r\npromoting peace, human rights and the rule of law \r\nthrough dialogue and tolerance can we make the world \r\na just and fair place to live in. \r\nA/65/PV.15  \r\n \r\n10-54965 40 \r\n \r\n In the context of what I have just said, I welcome \r\nthe relevance of this session’s theme, which should \r\nhelp create effective responses to global crises and \r\nrestore the role of the United Nations in global \r\ngovernance. The genuine vision of the founders of the \r\nUnited Nations should be restored. They have left us a \r\nlegacy. \r\n The Republic of Macedonia strongly supports the \r\njoint efforts to improve the overall coherence of the \r\nUnited Nations system. I believe that we all agree that \r\nit was and remains necessary to redefine the \r\nfunctioning of the United Nations system in order to \r\nrespond to the demands and priorities of the Member \r\nStates in the best and most effective manner possible. \r\nWe should create a highly functional global governance \r\norganization that has no overlapping of mandates, but \r\nachieves maximal effect through an appropriate and \r\ntransparent use of existing resources. \r\n Since gaining independence, the Republic of \r\nMacedonia has been fully committed to substantial \r\nreforms in all areas aimed at promoting democracy and \r\nimproving the standards of living of its citizens, based \r\non historical traditions of respect for multiethnic \r\ncoexistence, dialogue and mutual understanding. \r\n Our achievements in this context have been \r\nvalidated and internationally recognized. Therefore, the \r\nRepublic of Macedonia rightfully expects a date to be \r\nset to begin negotiations on its accession to the \r\nEuropean Union (EU) and an invitation to join NATO. \r\nWe have enforced the necessary reforms to join NATO, \r\nwe have been an EU membership candidate country for \r\nfive years, and last year we received a positive \r\nrecommendation to start negotiations with the EU. \r\nUnfortunately, our citizens have not yet felt the full \r\nbenefits of that. And yet, the reforms that brought us to \r\nthe front doors of these organizations were not at all \r\neasy. In addition, my country is actively committed to \r\nregional cooperation and to building good-neighbourly \r\nrelations. Macedonia accepts and promotes dialogue as \r\nthe only mechanism for overcoming all outstanding \r\nissues in the region. \r\n The Republic of Macedonia has directed all its \r\navailable capacities and resources towards \r\nimplementing our top strategic foreign policy goals: \r\nintegration into the EU and NATO membership. I \r\nwould like to remind the Assembly that, 15 years ago \r\nhere in New York, the Interim Accord was signed with \r\nour southern neighbour, whereby Greece agreed not to \r\nobstruct my country’s membership of and integration \r\ninto international and regional organizations. \r\nNevertheless, I must note that my country is still \r\nwaiting at the doors of these two organizations due to \r\nthe actions of our southern neighbour, which are \r\ncontrary to the obligations under the 1995 Interim \r\nAccord. \r\n The Republic of Macedonia is fully committed to \r\nthe process of resolving its differences with Greece \r\nwithin the framework of the mechanism established by \r\nUnited Nations resolutions. Our name is at stake, as is \r\nour right to self-identification and human dignity. We \r\nhave done our utmost to nurture close and friendly \r\nrelations with our neighbour Greece and its people. A \r\nsolution will be reached only if the United Nations \r\nCharter, the relevant resolutions and international law \r\nand its principles, on which the international order \r\nrests, are respected. \r\n The Republic of Macedonia and its citizens \r\ndeserve to enjoy the benefits of NATO membership and \r\nto start EU accession negotiations. \r\n Yesterday, here at the United Nations, I had a \r\nmeeting with the Greek Prime Minister, which sought \r\nto build a climate of mutual trust and understanding. I \r\nhope that, as two neighbouring countries that have \r\nlived and will live with one another, we will be able to \r\nfind a mutually acceptable solution. It will be a big \r\nstep not only for us but also towards fulfilling our \r\ncommon vision for the whole region.  \r\n I must say that I am encouraged by the situation \r\nin our region. The more intensive communication and \r\ncooperation efforts are, the better understanding and \r\nrespect will be. By accepting dialogue as the only way \r\nto overcome inherited problems and open issues, we \r\ncreate a new climate. Proof of this was the second \r\nBalkan Leaders Forum, which was held here in New \r\nYork City a couple of days ago. Slowly but surely, the \r\nBalkans is restoring its impaired dignity. The Balkans \r\nagain aspires to become part of the European space, \r\nwhere European values, European criteria and \r\nEuropean principles will be respected. The Balkans has \r\nbeen, is and will be Europe. \r\n Let me conclude with the statement that the \r\nRepublic of Macedonia believes in the United Nations \r\nand the postulates upon which it rests. I believe that the \r\nUnited Nations can maintain the stability of \r\ninternational order and relations and successfully meet \r\ncurrent and future global challenges. The Republic of \r\n A/65/PV.15\r\n \r\n41 10-54965 \r\n \r\nMacedonia stands ready to further provide its \r\nconstructive contribution to the implementation and \r\nrealization of these goals. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia for the statement he has just made. \r\n  Mr. Gjorge Ivanov, President of the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, was escorted \r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Gilbert Fossoun Houngbo, \r\nPrime Minister of the Togolese Republic \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the Togolese Republic. \r\n  Mr. Gilbert Fossoun Houngbo, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Togolese Republic, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum. \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency \r\nMr. Gilbert Fossoun Houngbo, Prime Minister of the \r\nTogolese Republic, and inviting him to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n Mr. Houngbo (Togo) (spoke in French): At the \r\noutset, allow me to extend my congratulations and \r\nthose of the Togolese people to Mr. Joseph Deiss on his \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-fifth session and to wish him every success in the \r\naccomplishment of his great task. My delegation will \r\nspare no effort in working at his side towards the \r\nsuccessful achievement of his mandate. Like him, we \r\nare firmly convinced that the values that lie at the heart \r\nof the United Nations remain very relevant today to \r\nsuccessfully meeting the challenges facing humankind.  \r\n I also congratulate his predecessor for his \r\ninvaluable efforts during his term of office to advance \r\nthe agenda of the General Assembly in many diverse \r\nand different areas, in particular those of peace and \r\nsecurity, human rights and the development of our \r\nnations. \r\n I would like to renew my personal support and \r\nthat of my country to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \r\nfor the dynamism he has shown over the course of the \r\npast four years at the head of the United Nations. I also \r\ntake this opportunity to congratulate him on the \r\nimportant report that he introduced to us yesterday on \r\nthe work of the Organization (A/65/1). \r\n The theme that the President of the General \r\nAssembly has proposed for the current session, \r\n“Reaffirming the central role of the United Nations in \r\nglobal governance”, eloquently translates the \r\naspirations of our States, particularly the developing \r\ncountries. The theme implies that the United Nations \r\nmust remain at the heart of multilateralism and that the \r\ninstitutions of our Organization must therefore be \r\nreconsidered, beginning with the long-awaited reform \r\nof the Security Council, in order to bring greater \r\ndemocracy and equity and, above all, to respond more \r\neffectively to the many challenges to our world.  \r\n In its own search for better governance and the \r\nwell-being of its people, my country, Togo, has \r\ntirelessly and irreversibly continued its march towards \r\ngreater democracy, freedom and justice in an \r\nenvironment of peace and stability. Seeking to turn the \r\npage once and for all on the dark years of our \r\ndemocratic deficit, the Head of State has established a \r\nnew policy of openness. In August 2006, this \r\ncommendable initiative led to the signing of the \r\nComprehensive Political Agreement among the main \r\npolitical actors in Togo and to the establishment of a \r\nGovernment of national unity and the holding in \r\nOctober 2007 of legislative elections that were \r\nuniversally recognized as free and transparent and, for \r\nthe first time, without violence. These elections, which \r\nestablished a pluralist National Assembly, are without a \r\ndoubt the emblem of our democratic renaissance.  \r\n The Government has since initiated political and \r\neconomic reforms leading to the adoption of a statute \r\nof the opposition and of a law on the financing of \r\npolitical parties; the consensus appointment of \r\nmembers of the National Independent Electoral \r\nCommission; and the creation of a security force for \r\nthe presidential elections, the members of which are \r\ntrained according to universally recognized standards \r\nand have maintained security throughout the electoral \r\nprocess in an exemplary fashion. All of these efforts \r\nnaturally allowed Togo to hold, on 4 March 2010, a \r\npresidential election that was democratic, peaceful and \r\nwidely praised by the international community.  \r\n I reiterate here the profound gratitude of the \r\nGovernment and people of Togo to all of our partners, \r\nA/65/PV.15  \r\n \r\n10-54965 42 \r\n \r\nto regional and international institutions, and to the \r\nfriendly countries that supported us throughout the \r\nelectoral process, making it a success and a good \r\nexample. Our gratitude goes to the United Nations for \r\nits many forms of support throughout the process of \r\ndemocratization and consolidation.  \r\n I would also encourage the United Nations to \r\ninvest even more in preventive democracy by, \r\ninter alia, beginning to envision mechanisms that could \r\nlead all parties to accept the results of elections that are \r\nrecognized as credible and transparent by the \r\ninternational community. That is a challenge we have \r\nto take up, particularly in our young democracies, and \r\nespecially the African democracies, so that the post-\r\nelectoral period is no longer a nightmare or a source of \r\ndivision among our peaceful populations. \r\n Notwithstanding his outstanding victory, and \r\nfaithful to his policy of reaching out to his opponents, \r\nPresident Faure Gnassingbé appealed to all persons of \r\ngood will to take part in the building of the Togolese \r\nnation. It was in this vein that an historic political \r\nagreement was concluded in May between the \r\npresidential majority and the Union des Forces de \r\nChangement, the main opposition party in Togo, which, \r\nwith seven ministerial posts, has for the first time \r\njoined a Government after 40 years of political \r\nfighting.  \r\n Moreover, the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation \r\nCommission, which seeks to promote reconciliation \r\namong the Togolese people by shedding light on the \r\npolitical violence that took place in Togo between 1958 \r\nand 2005, is currently in the depositions phase. My \r\ncountry will work tirelessly to consolidate the \r\nachievements of democracy and peace, while devoting \r\nincreasing efforts and energy to the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) in order to \r\nbring human and sustainable development to the entire \r\npopulation. Now that Togo has reconciled with itself, I \r\nhave faith in our capacity to fully renew our relations \r\nwith all of our bilateral and multilateral partners and to \r\nopen up new horizons in the vast field of solidarity that \r\nis international cooperation. \r\n Although there are some positive signs of the \r\nrecovery of the world economy, it is no exaggeration to \r\nsay that the path to stabilization and the suppression of \r\nthe disturbing effects of the crisis is still long, perilous \r\nand uncertain.  \r\n The new problem of climate change has brought \r\nin its wake catastrophes linked to rainfall phenomena, \r\nsuch as floods, drought and landslides. Without a \r\ndoubt, all of these phenomena will have a negative \r\nimpact on global economic growth in general and, \r\nmore specifically, a tragic effect on the least developed \r\ncountries in particular. Despite this threat, we still \r\nhesitate to reach agreement, as was demonstrated \r\nrecently by the Copenhagen Conference on innovative \r\nand proactive strategies to significantly reduce \r\ngreenhouse gas emissions, on the one hand, and, on the \r\nother hand, to pursue discussions to adopt as soon as \r\npossible a schedule for concluding a new agreement to \r\nsucceed the Kyoto Protocol. The time for speeches is \r\nover; the time to act is now. \r\n The High-level Plenary Meeting that we have just \r\nheld here on the implementation of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals revealed once again the intrinsic \r\nlink between aid and development, on the one hand, \r\nand development and political will, on the other, at the \r\nnational and international levels. The modest results \r\nmy country has achieved with respect to the MDGs \r\ncould have been better, and we would have been closer \r\nto attaining them within the deadlines set if we had not \r\nbeen deprived for far too many years of the precious \r\nhelp afforded by development aid.  \r\n The peaceful political climate being enjoyed by \r\nmy country will also enable us to effectively pursue the \r\nimprovement of the management of our public finances \r\nso that we are able to devote more domestic resources \r\nto achieving the MDGs. However, the efforts \r\nundertaken by poor countries to consolidate the bases \r\nof sustainable development will be a genuine success \r\nonly if developed countries provide them with their \r\nvarious forms of assistance and if they honour their \r\ncommitments. Let us not close our eyes to this fact. We \r\nneed better aid in terms of quantity and quality.  \r\n Although the international community can \r\nwelcome the fact that the number of armed conflicts in \r\nthe world has fallen, we cannot forget that several \r\npeacekeeping operations of the United Nations are still \r\nunder way. That is undeniable proof that we are still far \r\nfrom the ideal of international peace and security that \r\nthe founding fathers of the United Nations envisaged. \r\nCivil wars and terrorism continue to plunge many \r\nfamilies into mourning throughout the world. More \r\nthan wars, terrorism today is the most murderous form \r\nof violence inflicted upon people because it attacks \r\nindiscriminately, killing children, men, women and the \r\n A/65/PV.15\r\n \r\n43 10-54965 \r\n \r\nelderly. The eradication of terrorism in all its forms is a \r\nlong-term task and the responsibility above all of \r\nStates and the international community acting in \r\nsolidarity. They are obligated to find the best way to \r\nfight this phenomenon. In this regard, prevention, \r\nprotection, prosecution and punishment, as well as \r\ninternational cooperation, must remain the main focus \r\nof State action. \r\n While Member States struggle to find a definition \r\nof terrorism in order to better fight it, the scourge is \r\naffecting an increasing number of countries because of \r\nthe support that terrorists receive, particularly from \r\ndrug trafficking networks. In West Africa, all leaders \r\nhave become aware of the threat posed by drug \r\ntrafficking and are engaged in a fight to the death \r\nagainst the phenomenon. I call on wealthy countries to \r\nhelp fight drug trafficking in my subregion in order to \r\nprevent it from becoming an unstable zone of \r\nunrestrained violence. \r\n The purposes and principles for which the United \r\nNations Organization was created are noble, but \r\n65 years after its birth the work that remains to be done \r\nis immense because the social situation of the \r\ninhabitants of the planet does not always follow the \r\ndevelopment that our world has achieved. Poverty and \r\ndestitution are not mere words; they are oppressive \r\nrealities experienced day by day. They lead to violence, \r\ninstability, conflicts and other scourges that we, today, \r\nare not fighting successfully. Only international \r\nsolidarity will allow us to overcome the evils of this \r\nworld. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister of the Togolese Republic for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n  Mr. Gilbert Fossoun Houngbo, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Togolese Republic, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Emil Boc, Prime Minister of \r\nRomania \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of Romania.  \r\n  Mr. Emil Boc, Prime Minister of Romania, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum. \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Emil \r\nBoc, Prime Minister of Romania, and inviting him to \r\naddress the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Boc (Romania) (spoke in French): It is my \r\nhonour to speak here and to participate for the first \r\ntime in the Assembly’s general debate. The moment is \r\nall the more significant for us because Romania is \r\ncelebrating 55 years of membership in the United \r\nNations. My country and its people have always been \r\nfirm believers in the ideal of countries working \r\ntogether for peace, prosperity and a better life for \r\nhumankind. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n Nicolae Titulescu, one of the great Romanians of \r\nthe twentieth century, once said that hardship creates \r\nthe true brotherhood of nations. He said those words in \r\nSeptember 1931, as President of the League of Nations, \r\nin a time of crisis. Today we are burdened again by \r\nimmense challenges and have to live up to great \r\nresponsibilities placed upon us by present and future \r\ngenerations. Communities all over the planet face \r\nmounting threats, which are often interrelated. Climate \r\nchange exacerbates food and energy insecurity, health \r\nand population issues increase migration, while \r\npoverty puts pressure on regional security and stability. \r\n At the same time, we are heartened to see an ever \r\nincreasing commitment on the part of the world’s \r\nnations to act collectively and to share vision and \r\nwillpower to overcome difficulties.  \r\n Climate change must be our next mobilizing \r\nissue. We must not let differences and the enormous \r\ncomplexity of interests define our drive. Negotiations \r\nin Cancún and thereafter, building upon the \r\nCopenhagen Accord, must pave the way for the timely \r\nadoption of a comprehensive and legally binding post-\r\nKyoto agreement. Romania, including in its capacity as \r\nChair of the Commission for Sustainable Development, \r\nwill provide its unrestrained support and attention to \r\ninternational efforts to alleviate our planet’s \r\nenvironmental perils. \r\n While climate change will hit us ever harder, a \r\nglobal recession has just battered us. The crisis \r\nrevealed the flaws of our national and international \r\nfinancial and economic systems. It has become obvious \r\nthat the world’s financial system is no longer \r\ncompatible with the realities of global competition, nor \r\nA/65/PV.15  \r\n \r\n10-54965 44 \r\n \r\ncan it handle the misuse of free market principles. \r\nIndeed, the system needs to be revised. \r\n Sometimes, with sufficient resources, \r\ndevelopment can be achieved quickly. But \r\ndevelopment without good governance is less likely to \r\nbe lasting. A country whose citizens do not enjoy \r\nequality and dignity can never be wealthy. From its \r\nown past Romania knows very well the negative \r\nimpact that the lack of genuine democracy, human \r\nrights and freedom has on long-term development \r\nprospects. That is why we must never lose track of a \r\nmilestone document — the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights — adopted by this very Assembly, \r\n62 years ago, in Paris. The principles, the values and \r\nthe generous ideals enshrined in that Declaration must \r\nremain the underlying foundation of our governance \r\nefforts. Romania plays an active role in promoting \r\nthose fundamental values in our part of Europe and \r\nwherever its experience can prove useful and needed. \r\n One must not forget that democracy starts with a \r\nbasic step: free and fair elections. Electoral processes \r\ncan be improved, including in the most advanced \r\ncountries. States must be ready to accept that \r\nimprovements are sometimes needed and be able to \r\nlisten to and understand the calls for change, from \r\nwithin our societies or from outside. \r\n Out-of-country voting is a sensitive and \r\nchallenging issue, including in my country. Romania \r\nworks in cooperation with the United Nations Electoral \r\nAssistance Division, European institutions and the \r\nCommunity of Democracies to develop knowledge and \r\ncodify best practices in the field of out-of-country \r\nvoting. We hope that the results of a first seminar on \r\nthis topic, hosted by Romania this summer, will be \r\nmultiplied and shared by many countries and regions. \r\n Conflict prevention and peacebuilding are \r\npriorities in today’s world. Neither of them can be \r\nisolated from efforts to stabilize and reconstruct areas \r\nand societies affected by conflicts. To be successfully \r\nput into practice, that conceptual framework needs the \r\ncomplement of a consolidated United Nations \r\noperational instrument to which all Member States \r\nmust contribute to the best of their ability. For this \r\nreason my country has taken a keen interest in, and \r\noffered substantial contributions to, civilian and \r\nmilitary missions under the United Nations mandate \r\nand has started to develop dedicated capacities, of \r\nessentially civilian nature, in the area of stabilization \r\nand post-conflict reconstruction. \r\n Just a couple of weeks ago, Bucharest hosted an \r\ninternational conference to officially open the \r\nRomanian Training Centre for Post-Conflict \r\nReconstruction. The Centre will be open to \r\ninternational participation, and we hope to develop \r\nenhanced cooperation with the United Nations Office \r\nfor Partnerships. \r\n Today, Romania is honoured and proud to have \r\nconsistently contributed to the management, through \r\ninternational cooperation, of a number of conflict \r\nsituations and areas of instability. I pay my deepest \r\nrespect to the men and women of Romania who have \r\nlost their lives and those who are risking their lives in \r\nconflict areas, as well as to all the military, police, \r\ngendarmes and civilian personnel serving all over the \r\nworld to bring peace and security.  \r\n We must reaffirm our determination to \r\naccomplish the commitments made at the outset of the \r\nUnited Nations-mandated international mission in \r\nAfghanistan. While we welcome the results of the \r\nlatest conferences in London and Kabul and note the \r\nprogress in ensuring the stability, security and \r\ndevelopment of that sorely tried nation, we look \r\nforward to the moment when the Afghan authorities \r\nwill be ready to assume the entire spectrum of \r\nresponsibilities incumbent upon them. \r\n Romania firmly supports the continued \r\ninvolvement of the United Nations and the \r\ninternational community in the reconstruction of Iraq \r\nand is ready to carry on helping. The success of the \r\nsovereign development of Iraq depends on national \r\nreconciliation and the development of harmonious \r\nrelations with its neighbours. \r\n As regards the issue of Kosovo, Romania \r\ncontinues to uphold politically and practically the \r\nessential United Nations mandate there, as well as the \r\nroles of the European Union and NATO in ensuring the \r\nprogress, stability and security of the area. While \r\nrespecting the advisory opinion of the International \r\nCourt of Justice, Romania considers that the opinion \r\ndoes not examine the core of the issue, which is the \r\nlegality of the creation of an alleged new State. \r\nRomania maintains the view that unilateral secession is \r\nnot possible under international law. Accordingly, \r\nRomania will maintain its position of non-recognition \r\nof Kosovo’s unilateral declaration of independence. \r\n A/65/PV.15\r\n \r\n45 10-54965 \r\n \r\n We continue to be concerned with the protracted \r\nconflicts in the extended Black Sea area and South \r\nCaucasus. While solutions to these conflicts continue \r\nto be explored in the agreed formats, they must also be \r\nmonitored by the larger United Nations membership, as \r\na way to encourage dialogue and to ensure that \r\ndevelopments remain within the boundaries of \r\ninternational law and United Nations resolutions. \r\n In Georgia, which is among Romania’s top \r\npriorities, the United Nations must continue to play an \r\nimportant role, along with other actors such as the \r\nEuropean Union, which through its Monitoring \r\nMission contributes immensely to the stability of the \r\narea. \r\n Furthermore, we support the Middle East peace \r\nprocess on the basis of the principles and provisions of \r\nthe relevant Security Council resolutions and of the \r\nroad map. We express our hope that the current direct \r\ndiscussions will lead to the goal of two States living \r\nside by side in peace and security. We also hope that \r\nIsrael and Syria and Israel and Lebanon can identify \r\nthe means needed to find solutions to improve their \r\nrespective relations. \r\n Concerning the crucial role of the United Nations \r\nin the area of disarmament, non-proliferation and arms \r\ncontrol, I would like to underline the need to both \r\nstrengthen the relevance of international law and to \r\nfully implement it. \r\n Romania welcomes the new United States-\r\nRussian Federation treaty on nuclear arms reduction \r\nand the adoption of the Final Document of the 2010 \r\nReview Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which contains \r\nconcrete actions to advance international cooperation \r\nin the field of nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation \r\nand peaceful use of nuclear energy. The entry into \r\nforce of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty \r\nand future negotiations for a fissile material cut-off \r\ntreaty continue to be issues of high interest for my \r\ncountry. \r\n The efforts evoked in my address require a \r\nvibrant multilateralism with a strong United Nations at \r\nits core. That premise demands, in turn, improved \r\nfunctional relations between the United Nations and \r\nother international organizations with a global or \r\nregional vocation. \r\n The roles of the European Union, NATO, the \r\nAfrican Union, the International Organization of la \r\nFrancophonie and others in working jointly with the \r\nUnited Nations in the field and at Headquarters must \r\nbe supported and reinforced by all Member States. At \r\nthe same time, the wide-ranging process of realignment \r\nand reform of the United Nations and its bodies must \r\nmaintain the same pace. \r\n In that context, I would like to warmly welcome \r\nthe creation of the United Nations Entity for Gender \r\nEquality and the Empowerment of Women as a \r\nsignificant step in United Nations reform. We \r\ncongratulate Madame Michelle Bachelet, former \r\nPresident of Chile, for her appointment as head of that \r\nentity and wish her every success. At the same time, I \r\nwould like to commend Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon and the entire Organization for their \r\nexceptional dedication and commitment to the \r\nadvancement of women. \r\n The sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly \r\ngives us another year in which we must accelerate the \r\nAssembly’s renewal and work out historic decisions on \r\nSecurity Council reform. Romania shares the view that \r\nthe overarching goal of Security Council reform must \r\nbe to create a more effective, transparent and \r\nrepresentative body, and my country will join any \r\npragmatic move in this direction. We strongly believe \r\nthat the Eastern European Group deserves better \r\nrepresentation on the Security Council in any \r\nenlargement format. \r\n Let me conclude by saying that our role and \r\nposition in the world’s affairs are not defined by our \r\ngreatest achievements, but by how we use those \r\nachievements to strengthen the most vulnerable among \r\nus. That has been and still is the noblest mission and \r\nvocation of the United Nations, and of us all. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister of Romania for the statement he has \r\njust made. \r\n  Mr. Emil Boc, Prime Minister of Romania, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\nA/65/PV.15  \r\n \r\n10-54965 46 \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Stephenson King, Prime \r\nMinister of Saint Lucia \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear as address by the Prime \r\nMinister of Saint Lucia. \r\n  Mr. Stephenson King, Prime Minister of Saint \r\nLucia, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency \r\nMr. Stephenson King, Prime Minister of Saint Lucia, \r\nand inviting him to address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. King (Saint Lucia): In my address on the \r\naccomplishments and shortfalls of Saint Lucia towards \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals, I \r\nstressed that all of our gains would be useless if we \r\ncould not address the threatening saga of adverse \r\nclimate change. Many other nations highlighted that \r\nurgent issue, and I hope that our collective voices will \r\nreceive the attention of those most capable of acting. \r\n I will therefore focus on two of the most critical \r\nfactors in our development as small island developing \r\nStates (SIDS): first, the effects of global climate \r\nchange, and second, the uncertain economic and \r\nfinancial crisis. \r\n Saint Lucia notes the ongoing negotiations in \r\nadvance of the sixteenth Conference of the Parties to \r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange, to be held in Cancún, Mexico, later this year. \r\nFollowing the fifteenth Conference of the Parties, \r\nwhich failed to achieve consensus on a legally binding \r\nframework for addressing climate change, Saint Lucia \r\nrecognizes the critical importance of the current talks \r\nin laying a solid foundation for a more favourable \r\noutcome in Cancún, one that will truly fulfil the \r\npurpose of the Convention and help to ensure the \r\ncontinued existence of humankind. \r\n We have long since moved past the debate over \r\nthe existence of climate change to a discussion about \r\nthe severity of its impacts on the nations and regions of \r\nthe world. The small island developing States of the \r\nworld, Saint Lucia included, are recognized as being \r\namong the most vulnerable to climate change, with that \r\nphenomenon threatening the very existence of some of \r\nour island nations. That is so despite the fact that, \r\njointly, the SIDS contribute a fraction of one per cent \r\nof global greenhouse gas emissions. \r\n We began this year with news that a cataclysmic \r\nearthquake had hit Haiti. The United Nations came \r\ntogether in solidarity with our sister island and pledged \r\n$1.5 billion in assistance. To date, Haiti’s officials \r\nreport that only 10 per cent of the pledges have been \r\nfunded. The same seems to be true for most appeals for \r\nhumanitarian causes. We trust that the pledging \r\nconference for Pakistan, the most recent country to be \r\nhit by a catastrophe, will be more successful.  \r\n Addressing the humanitarian consequences of \r\ntoday’s disasters and emergencies remains a United \r\nNations priority. We thank those who have kept their \r\npledges, while we encourage those who have shown \r\ngood intentions but have not yet matched words with \r\naction to do so with some urgency. \r\n For those reasons, for the good of all humankind \r\nand indeed, for the good of all creation, Saint Lucia, \r\nlike all member States of the Caribbean Community \r\n(CARICOM) is committed to lending its efforts to \r\nachieving an ambitious, just and legally binding \r\nagreement that will realize our goal of timely and \r\nsuccessfully addressing climate change. \r\n Speaking of justice, climate change can be \r\nsuccessfully addressed only if countries most \r\nresponsible take the necessary steps to reduce carbon \r\ndioxide emissions and provide adequate financial \r\nresources for the development and transfer of \r\ntechnology for both adaptation and mitigation to those \r\nwho have been most seriously affected. \r\n Few developing countries possess sufficient \r\nfinancial and human resources to address adequately \r\nthe ongoing and anticipated impacts of global climate \r\nchange. According to World Bank estimates, the total \r\nannual impact of potential climate change on all \r\nCARICOM countries could be, in 2007 dollar prices, \r\n$9.9 billion of our total gross national product (GDP), \r\nor about 11.3 per cent of total GDP. That means that we \r\nhave no choice but to divert critical funding from our \r\npoverty alleviation programmes to trying to protect our \r\ncountries from that formidable threat.  \r\n There is no doubt that stable long-term funding is \r\nof critical importance to developing countries and \r\ncannot be underestimated. We urgently need to scale up \r\nnew and additional resources and sources of funding to \r\nsupport mitigation efforts. We cannot rely on \r\nhumanitarian assistance alone, which only addresses \r\nthe consequences of such events. \r\n A/65/PV.15\r\n \r\n47 10-54965 \r\n \r\n We know that our development partners are \r\nserious about implementing meaningful mitigation \r\naction, so we call for a firm collective commitment to \r\nproviding new and additional resources. Let us not \r\ncontinue to renege on promises made, as developing \r\nStates cannot go it alone and should not be penalized \r\nfor the actions of industrialized countries. We call for \r\nan understanding partnership in tackling the pressing \r\nissues that threaten to engulf our world. \r\n Despite our geographic distribution, small island \r\ndeveloping States (SIDs) are working diligently \r\ntogether on shared concerns through regional and \r\ninternational networks, the most notable of which is the \r\nAlliance of Small Island States. We recognize that \r\ntraditional hydrocarbon fuel usage is unsustainable and \r\nare therefore looking to make use of the alternate \r\nenergy sources that are available to us. The use of \r\nhydropower, wind, solar and geothermal sources and \r\nconverting waste into energy are means by which we \r\ncould reduce our energy reliance, lower trade deficits \r\nand generate employment. However, those require \r\ninvestment in research, development and infrastructure. \r\n The other most critical factor in our development \r\nis the speed of the global economy’s return to sustained \r\ngrowth. Recent news of deteriorating economic \r\nconditions and a fall in house sales in the United States \r\nhas fanned the flame of fears of a double-dip recession. \r\nOver the past few weeks, the short-term growth \r\nprospects of the United States, Europe and Japan have \r\nbeen downgraded on the back of recently released \r\neconomic data, which is below expectations. \r\n The prospects for economic recovery in Europe \r\nwere dampened by the crisis in some countries earlier \r\nthis year, but renewed confidence has recently \r\nemerged, spurred by the stronger-than-expected \r\nperformance of the German economy in the second \r\nquarter of 2010. However, the growth prospects for \r\nEurope remain uncertain, given that fiscal \r\nretrenchment measures could pose a risk to growth and \r\nthe pace of recovery. The weakened growth prospects \r\nfor the United States and Europe could impede growth \r\nin emerging markets, with a slowdown in the growth of \r\nexports and investment flows. The uneven pace of the \r\nglobal economic recovery in countries and regions has \r\nled to differences in approach in policy responses. \r\n I have made these points because the economies \r\nof the United States, Europe and the European Union \r\nare our major sources of tourism, agricultural trade, \r\nofficial development assistance, foreign direct \r\ninvestment (FDI) and remittances, which constitute the \r\nmainstays of our economy. We therefore urge the focus \r\non global economic recovery to be maintained for the \r\nbenefit of the global community. \r\n As a small island developing State with a highly \r\nopen economy, Saint Lucia has been hard hit by the \r\neffects of the global financial and economic crisis. As \r\nwith most small developing countries, the crisis led to \r\na deterioration in Saint Lucia’s economy, resulting in a \r\ncontraction in GDP, a rise in the level of \r\nunemployment and a weakening of the Government’s \r\nfiscal position. \r\n The decline in economic activity was driven \r\nmainly by a fall in stay-over tourist arrivals, lower \r\nproduction in the agricultural sector and a sharp \r\ndownturn in construction. The decline in activity in the \r\nconstruction sector was attributable to a fall in FDI \r\ninflows as the freeze in international credit adversely \r\naffected the financing of a number of hotel \r\nconstruction projects in Saint Lucia. It was also \r\nattributable to a decline in remittances, which have \r\nhelped sustain the local housing sector. \r\n Notwithstanding the decline in revenue \r\ncollection, expenditure outlays increased, resulting in a \r\ndeteriorating fiscal position. That outcome led to a \r\nwidening of the central Government’s overall fiscal \r\ndeficit to 4.8 per cent of GDP in the financial year \r\n2009-2010, compared to a deficit of 1.9 per cent of \r\nGDP in the previous year. Public debt as a percentage \r\nof GDP rose from 66 per cent in 2008 to 71 per cent in \r\n2009 as a result of increases in borrowing to finance \r\nthe budget deficit. \r\n The adverse impacts of the combination of global \r\nand regional shocks have prompted the Government of \r\nSaint Lucia to implement a number of measures \r\ndesigned to mitigate the social, fiscal and regulatory \r\nchallenges of the crisis. In order to mitigate the \r\nimpacts of the price shocks, the Government \r\nimplemented a number of measures to protect the most \r\nvulnerable in our population.  \r\n Such measures included the creation of short-\r\nterm employment programmes, the suspension of \r\nimport duties and other taxes on basic consumer items, \r\nthe establishment of controls on retail markups and \r\nprofit margins on some basic food items, and the \r\nprovision of limited price subsidies on basic \r\ncommodities to vulnerable groups. \r\nA/65/PV.15  \r\n \r\n10-54965 48 \r\n \r\n In its strategic response to the crisis and in laying \r\nthe foundation for growth, the Government of Saint \r\nLucia has undertaken the development of a medium-\r\nterm development strategy plan for the period 2011-\r\n2016. The plan will lay the blueprint for the \r\ndevelopment of emerging new sources of growth, such \r\nas offshore education, health and wellness tourism, and \r\nhigh–end information and communications technology, \r\nand for expanding existing critical sectors, such as \r\ntourism, agriculture and manufacturing. \r\n The signing of the economic partnership \r\nagreement with the European Union in 2008, the \r\nimplementation of the CARICOM Single Market and \r\nEconomy and the Economic Union of the Organization \r\nof Eastern Caribbean States will bring new sets of \r\nchallenges and opportunities for Saint Lucia. The \r\nGovernment’s strategic priority is to develop \r\nmeaningful partnerships with the private sector to meet \r\nthe challenges and take advantage of the opportunities \r\nprovided. The capacity of the private sector will be \r\nstrengthened to take advantage of the opportunities \r\npresented by such trading arrangements.  \r\n However, the Government recognizes that this \r\nwill require a host of general improvements in the \r\nbusiness environment, including strengthening the \r\ninvestment climate, expanding the skills base, \r\npromoting innovation and technology adoption, and \r\nimproving international transport services and other \r\ninfrastructure. All those will require large capital \r\noutlays. \r\n While the Government has responded to the \r\nchallenges by developing specific programmes and \r\nprojects to improve the business climate in Saint Lucia, \r\nthe role of international financial institutions and \r\nbodies like the Group of 20 in stabilizing the global \r\neconomy and restoring growth is crucial to small \r\ndeveloping countries like Saint Lucia. As the focus of \r\nthe global recovery efforts is aimed at laying the \r\nfoundation for sustainable and balanced growth, Saint \r\nLucia, through its new policy directives and \r\nprogrammes, is positioning itself to benefit from the \r\ngrowth prospects for the global economy. \r\n In that respect, we call for a review of the United \r\nNations delivery to SIDS, and particularly for \r\nstrengthened support measures to address the \r\nvulnerabilities of all SIDS and for support within the \r\nUnited Nations system for a special category. Most \r\nSIDS do not get our fair share of assistance because we \r\nfall into the middle-income country category. However, \r\nbeing middle-income does not reduce vulnerability. \r\nThere is a greater need for advocacy and a resource-\r\nmobilization role for SIDS under the Mauritius \r\nStrategy for the further implementation of the \r\nBarbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States. \r\n The support of the international community is \r\ntherefore necessary if Saint Lucia and all other SIDS \r\nare to fulfil the goal of sustainable development and \r\nthereby improve the standards of living of their \r\npopulations and meet all of the MDGs by the year \r\n2015. \r\n Let me now touch briefly on our moral \r\nenvironment. Among all the disasters we face today, \r\nwe can accept some as natural occurrences, yet others \r\nare of our own making. Conflicts brought about by \r\ndifferences in ideology, political persuasion, religion \r\nand economic circumstance have presented challenges \r\nto global peace and security, including the many mass \r\natrocities that the world has witnessed. Even with \r\nnumerous advances in technology, education and health \r\nand an increase in material progress, the world seems \r\nto suffer from mental restlessness and discontent. We \r\nseem not to have found the formula for peacekeeping \r\nand peacemaking within nations, even after 60 years of \r\nsearching. \r\n Keeping the peace and building peace are critical \r\ncomponents of sustainable development worldwide. \r\nBut peacekeeping goes far beyond civilian conflict. We \r\nare pleased to note that there is now acceptance of the \r\nrelationship between such non-traditional security \r\nissues as poverty and health, on the one hand, and \r\nconflict on the other. Maybe with that new \r\nunderstanding we will help find a solution. \r\n We understand that the United Nations is \r\nincapable of solving all the world’s discordant issues \r\nand that the best solutions for conflict are home-grown. \r\nHowever, there are identified areas where the United \r\nNations can realistically make a difference. Where this \r\nis the case, we need to strengthen the role of the United \r\nNations in the promotion of peace and economic \r\ndevelopment. In this regard, and while keeping our \r\ngoals realistic, we look forward to Security Council \r\nreform. We need an equitable international system and \r\na more balanced approach to international security. \r\n We acknowledge that States remain the principal \r\nduty-bearers and cannot abrogate their responsibility to \r\n A/65/PV.15\r\n \r\n49 10-54965 \r\n \r\nimplement policies, enact national legislation and \r\nfoster an enabling environment in which human rights \r\ncan be enjoyed by all. When these rights go \r\nunexercised, economic growth is stunted and \r\ndevelopment is paralysed. A key role of the United \r\nNations is to help ensure that economic growth \r\ntranslates into wider enjoyment of human rights for all. \r\nWithout human rights, we cannot achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals; we cannot achieve the \r\nadvancement of humankind. When we expect the \r\nUnited Nations to protect human rights, we hold the \r\nsame expectations of ourselves. After all, we are the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n Also integrated within the issue of human rights \r\nis human security. As Members of the United Nations, \r\nwe are concerned with human life, education, longevity \r\nand social inclusion. There would be no United Nations \r\nif there were no universal concern for the well-being of \r\nthe collective. Respect for human rights and the \r\nprotection of human security are therefore mutually \r\nreinforcing. \r\n Most people want peace, democracy and social \r\nequity, and we recognize the State’s inherent \r\nresponsibility to provide these for its citizens. If \r\nGovernments are to be successful, people must \r\nparticipate in formulating and implementing strategies \r\nto enhance their national authorities’ capacity to \r\nachieve these goals. However, with globalization, the \r\never-evolving threats that arise when one country falls \r\nto maintain the social order ricochet to affect the rest \r\nof the world. Every State requires international \r\ncooperation to preserve its own security. \r\n We Caribbean countries take the issue of security \r\nvery seriously. We suffer from an increasing incidence \r\nof crime and violence, which is compounded by \r\nrelatively easy access to and use of illegal firearms. \r\nThe number of gun-related homicides has jumped to \r\nunacceptable levels, and this has been aggravated by a \r\nworsened economic situation. \r\n Another great tragedy of our times is the \r\nuncontrolled illicit drug trade. We must find solutions \r\nto both problems. We are perplexed, therefore, to see \r\nthe closure of the Caribbean office of the United \r\nNations Office on Drugs and Crime. We call for a \r\nreassessment of that decision. We also call for a \r\ncomprehensive treaty on small arms and light weapons, \r\nalongside the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons. Small arms and light weapons are \r\nresponsible for more deaths than natural causes in \r\nsome parts of the world. \r\n In attempting to fulfil our commitments on the \r\nMDGs, we have engaged many partners, including the \r\nUnited States, the European Union, Canada, our Latin \r\nAmerican neighbours, India, Japan and South Korea, to \r\nname but a few. I wish, though, to make a special \r\nappeal to this body to support the aspirations of the \r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan to make its contribution \r\nto the world collaboration through membership and \r\neffective participation in the air transport and health \r\nbodies and climate change discussions, including the \r\nInternational Civil Aviation Organization, the World \r\nHealth Organization, the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change and other organizations \r\nof a universal nature.  \r\n The contribution of Taiwan to countries that have \r\nsought its assistance in these areas matches that of any \r\nother, and it has helped without asking for much in \r\nreturn. No country should be prevented from making \r\nits contribution to humankind, for they do share the \r\nworld with us and their contribution to health and \r\nenvironmental issues know no boundaries.  \r\n Increased concern for air safety also remains a \r\nglobal priority. We therefore hope that ongoing cross-\r\nStrait talks will lead to a peaceful solution. This is a \r\nlong-standing problem that deserves an urgent \r\nresolution that is acceptable to all and in keeping with \r\nthe Charter and principles of the United Nations, as \r\nwell as the aspirations of peoples to self-development \r\nand progress. \r\n There are some anachronisms that still persist in \r\nthis world, and one is the embargo against Cuba. We \r\nhave moved into a world where political uncertainty \r\nhas been replaced by economic uncertainty. Yet a \r\nmechanism that was put in place to deal with a political \r\nissue remains today and is being used for economic \r\nstrangulation, even as we appeal to everyone else for \r\ncooperation and understanding in other areas. We must \r\nrespect the freely expressed wishes of the people of our \r\nregion as well as their right to shape and chart their \r\ndestiny. Our region is diverse, but our aspirations are \r\nshared. Only mutual respect will foster the relationship \r\nthat is so necessary and vital to the development of our \r\nregion. \r\n Here again, permit me to make another point \r\nregarding respect. When the World Trade Organization \r\n(WTO) ruled against our preferential regime on \r\nA/65/PV.15  \r\n \r\n10-54965 50 \r\n \r\nbananas, we were told that we had to comply. Now that \r\nthe WTO has ruled in favour of our efforts in the \r\nservices sector — I am speaking here of the favourable \r\nruling we received on the gaming dispute referred to \r\nthe WTO by Antigua and Barbuda — there is \r\nreluctance to comply. We cannot have double \r\nstandards. We therefore urge all parties to agree on \r\nmutually agreed principles that govern the conduct of \r\nrelations among States, large or small, in order for \r\neveryone to be treated fairly. \r\n Our world is in crisis. We face a growing, more \r\naggressive realm where the insatiable appetite for the \r\nworld’s resources has led to the subversion of justice \r\nand humanity. The tumultuous times that we live in can \r\nbe weathered only through continued and increased \r\ncommitment to human development. Let us all work \r\ntowards that goal and the sustainability of biodiversity \r\nand humankind. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister of Saint Lucia for the statement he has \r\njust made.  \r\n  Mr. Stephenson King, Prime Minister of Saint \r\nLucia, was escorted from the rostrum.  \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): In view \r\nof the late hour, I would ask all speakers to limit their \r\nstatements insofar as possible to a total of 15 minutes \r\nso that everyone will be able to take the floor.  \r\n I now call on His Excellency Mr. Murray \r\nMcCully, Minister for Foreign Affairs of New Zealand. \r\n Mr. McCully (New Zealand): It is an honour to \r\nlead New Zealand’s delegation this year. The opening \r\nof the General Assembly’s new session is the best \r\nexample there is of the capacity of the United Nations \r\nto bring us all together. Our discussions here will be \r\nwide-ranging, but inevitably settle on two main issues: \r\nglobal security and sustainable economic development.  \r\n We want to make our world safer, more secure \r\nand more prosperous. These goals will require strong \r\ncollective action with a focus on practical outcomes. \r\nNew Zealand is seeking every opportunity to \r\ncontribute. We are a young, small and fair-minded \r\ncountry. We depend upon a United Nations that is \r\neffective and credible. \r\n New Zealand takes pride in its diversity. In \r\naddition to our indigenous Maori population, we are a \r\nmix of people from Europe, Asia and the Pacific. Our \r\nlinks with Europe are built on history and tradition. \r\nWithin Asia, we are developing ever-stronger economic \r\nand security relationships. Our future is closely tied to \r\nboth of these regions. We have an equally strong focus \r\non our closest neighbours in the South Pacific. New \r\nZealand is a Pacific country. Auckland is the largest \r\nPasifika city in the world, and a number of Pacific \r\ncountries have more citizens living in New Zealand \r\nthan at home. \r\n The security and development of the region is \r\nNew Zealand’s constant preoccupation. It is a matter of \r\ngrave concern that the South Pacific is second only to \r\nsub-Saharan Africa in terms of lack of progress \r\ntowards the achievement of some of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). We want to see the \r\nMDGs achieved, and we want to see the wider Pacific \r\nprosper through good governance and sustainable \r\neconomic development. That is why New Zealand is \r\nincreasingly deploying our development resources \r\nwithin its region, since that is where they are most \r\nneeded and where they can be most effective. \r\n The development challenges in the Pacific are \r\nextremely complex, with vulnerable economies and \r\nchallenging environmental circumstances. New \r\nZealand has increased and will continue to increase our \r\noverall level of development assistance, despite \r\nchallenging times for our domestic economy. A higher \r\npercentage of that larger budget will be focused on our \r\nregion. \r\n But money alone is not enough; aid effectiveness \r\nand donor coordination are vital. Progress will also \r\ndepend on good governance within the region. \r\n Next year we will mark the fortieth anniversary \r\nof the Pacific Islands Forum, the central body for \r\nregional engagement in the Pacific, which held its first \r\nmeeting in New Zealand in 1971. We will welcome \r\nleaders from around the region back to New Zealand \r\nnext September to celebrate our achievements over \r\n40 years and to take stock of the challenges we must \r\nface in the future. \r\n The past year has reinforced the need for better \r\ndisaster management. Just three weeks ago, residents in \r\nChristchurch woke to the most destructive earthquake \r\nin New Zealand in 80 years. Miraculously, there was \r\nno loss of life, but the damage runs into billions of \r\ndollars and people’s lives and livelihoods were \r\naffected. Significant aftershocks are still affecting the \r\n A/65/PV.15\r\n \r\n51 10-54965 \r\n \r\npopulation. But less than a month after the earthquake \r\nhit, roads and buildings have been repaired, tourism \r\ninfrastructure is at almost full capacity, and people’s \r\nlives are being rebuilt. \r\n Others have not been so lucky. The earthquakes \r\nin Haiti and Chile and the recent flooding in Pakistan \r\nare reminders of the devastating scale of such disasters. \r\nThe Pacific has been hit hard, too. This month will \r\nmark the first anniversary of the Pacific tsunami that \r\ntook the lives of 184 people in Samoa, American \r\nSamoa and Tonga. \r\n These events and others demonstrate the \r\nimportance of disaster preparedness, management and \r\nrecovery. New Zealand’s experience with major \r\nearthquakes has taught us how to mitigate risks, \r\nenforce strong building codes, and implement effective \r\nrecovery plans. But there will be lessons we should \r\nlearn from this recent experience. We will work with \r\nthe United Nations system, non-governmental \r\norganizations and other international agencies to \r\nensure that those lessons are shared and help others to \r\nprepare. \r\n While development and disaster management are \r\ncrucial to our quest for a safer world, underpinning \r\nboth is security. Peacekeeping is a key responsibility of \r\nthe Organization. Indeed, it is its peacekeeping \r\noperations that shape perceptions of the United Nations \r\nfor many people around the world. \r\n New Zealand is committed to supporting global \r\nsecurity and United Nations peacekeeping. That is why \r\nwe have been engaged in peacekeeping and peace \r\nsupport operations since the 1940s. New Zealand’s \r\nsoldiers, police, engineers, corrections and customs \r\nofficers, doctors and other personnel are today \r\ninvolved in 12 operations that span the globe from \r\nAfrica, Afghanistan and the Middle East to Asia and \r\nthe Pacific. \r\n One of the clearest examples of New Zealand’s \r\ncommitment to the principles of collective \r\nresponsibility is through the United Nations effort in \r\nTimor-Leste. Since 1999, New Zealand has been a part \r\nof every United Nations mission that has served in \r\nTimor-Leste. We have played a major role in the \r\nUnited Nations-sanctioned international military \r\noperations that restored order there in 1999 and again \r\nin 2006. Over 6,000 New Zealanders have served in \r\nTimor in the past decade — a significant undertaking \r\nfor a country of only 4.4 million people. \r\n Of course, helping ensure peace and stability in \r\nour region alone is not enough. New Zealanders are \r\namong those who have been affected by terrorism, \r\nkilled in the attacks that took place just a few blocks \r\naway from here in September 2001, and more recently \r\nin Bali, in London and in Jakarta. \r\n The need to respond decisively to those who \r\nperpetrate such atrocities is a key reason why New \r\nZealand has led the provincial reconstruction team in \r\nBamyan, Afghanistan, since 2003. We have redeployed \r\nour special forces to work alongside the Government of \r\nAfghanistan and the international community to ensure \r\nthat that country does not return to being a safe haven \r\nfor Al-Qaida. We must address the conditions in which \r\nterrorism thrives. We are increasing our development \r\nspending in Bamyan and recently placed the Provincial \r\nReconstruction Team under civilian leadership for the \r\nfirst time. \r\n New Zealand is also strongly supportive of \r\npeacekeeping reform. The expansion in peacekeeping \r\nsince 1990 has been dramatic. Never before has this \r\nOrganization deployed so many missions to such \r\ncomplex environments. This expansion has opened up \r\ndiscussion of the way the United Nations conducts its \r\npeacekeeping operations. Clear and achievable \r\nmandates are needed, progress needs to be better \r\nmonitored, and efficiency needs to be improved. \r\n We are also contributing to United Nations efforts \r\nto strengthen peacebuilding in practice, including the \r\nneed for better participation of women in \r\npeacebuilding. Of course, the response of the United \r\nNations to crises has not always been successful. It is \r\nfor this reason that New Zealand has strongly \r\nsupported the responsibility to protect (R2P). We were \r\npleased to contribute to the proposed joint Special \r\nAdviser on the Prevention of Genocide/R2P office and \r\nlook forward to the more comprehensive \r\nimplementation of R2P throughout the United Nations \r\nsystem. \r\n Effective pursuit of these goals — countering \r\nterrorism and maintaining peace and security — \r\ndemands coordinated, collective action. The United \r\nNations is the best vehicle for that action. New Zealand \r\nhas been, and remains, proud to be a part of that \r\ncommunity of collective action. In line with that \r\ncommitment, New Zealand is seeking a seat on the \r\nSecurity Council for the 2015-2016 term. In doing so, \r\nA/65/PV.15  \r\n \r\n10-54965 52 \r\n \r\nwe will work with others here who want the world to \r\nbe a safer and more prosperous place. \r\n This year significant gains have been made in \r\nglobal disarmament. New Zealand welcomes the action \r\nplan adopted at this year’s Non-Proliferation Treaty \r\nReview Conference, the groundbreaking nuclear \r\nsecurity summit, and the entry into force of the \r\nConvention on Cluster Munitions. These are tangible \r\nand practical successes. But we still face some \r\nsignificant challenges. New Zealand is concerned by \r\nthe continuing inertia of the Conference on \r\nDisarmament. The Secretary-General’s High-level \r\nMeeting on disarmament this morning was a valuable \r\nstep in acknowledging this problem and trying to find a \r\nway forward. \r\n As a country that prides itself on sustainable \r\ndevelopment, New Zealand is also greatly concerned \r\nabout global environmental issues. As well as working \r\ntowards an outcome in Cancún, we are involved in \r\npractical projects for addressing climate change. One \r\nsuch project is the Global Research Alliance on \r\nAgricultural Greenhouse Gases. Fourteen per cent of \r\nworldwide greenhouse-gas emissions come from \r\nagriculture. At the same time, there are projections that \r\nworld food production needs to increase by 50 per cent \r\nin the next 20 years, and to double in the next 40 years, \r\nto feed a growing world. \r\n Clearly, we need a scientific breakthrough to help \r\nmeet the challenge of producing more food while \r\nreducing emissions. New Zealand formed the Alliance, \r\nwhich now includes more than 30 agricultural nations, \r\nto find ways to address this problem. Scientists and \r\nresearchers are now linking up across the world to try \r\nto balance the need for increased agricultural \r\nproduction with the need to address climate change. \r\nThis is just one example of how countries can come \r\ntogether to address climate change in a very real way. \r\n When I was here a year ago, we were watching to \r\nsee whether the world would be able to climb out of \r\nthe global economic recession. Much progress has been \r\nmade and key economic indicators are generally \r\npointing in the right direction. The rapid and \r\ncoordinated international response, including by the \r\nGroup of 20, has been effective. The World Trade \r\nOrganization’s rules-based trading system has held up \r\nwell. But, like many countries, New Zealand is \r\nfrustrated that the conclusion of the Doha Development \r\nRound still eludes us. \r\n Over these last few days, especially in the context \r\nof discussion of progress towards the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, I have heard many fine words \r\nspoken in support of the world’s disadvantaged. I take \r\nthis opportunity to remind those speakers and countries \r\nthat the single most effective step that could be taken \r\nto advance the position of the world’s disadvantaged \r\nwould be to create a framework within which they can \r\ntrade themselves to a better future. \r\n I want to strongly endorse President Obama’s \r\nstatement, made yesterday, that there is no viable \r\nalternative to the resolution of conflict in the Middle \r\nEast other than two States, Israel and Palestine, living \r\nside by side in peace and security. We believe that \r\ndirect negotiations, with both parties at the table, are \r\nthe only way to resolve the conflict. We congratulate \r\nPresident Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu on \r\nhaving the courage to negotiate in very difficult \r\ncircumstances. We ask that Israel heed the international \r\ncommunity’s unanimous call to extend the moratorium \r\non settlements and create the enabling atmosphere that \r\nwill allow direct negotiations to continue. \r\n We also agree with President Obama that \r\nresolution of the Middle East conflict is not just the \r\nresponsibility of Israel and Palestine. Countries in the \r\nregion especially, but also countries elsewhere, must \r\nwork towards Middle East peace. New Zealand, as a \r\nfriend of both Israel and Palestine, will play its part. I \r\nrecently visited the Sinai, where a New Zealand officer \r\nhas command of the Multinational Force and \r\nObservers. I was reminded that there has been peace \r\nbetween Israel and Egypt for more than 30 years, a \r\nprospect once unthinkable. With the commitment of the \r\ntwo parties and the support of the international \r\ncommunity, Israel and Palestine can enjoy the same \r\nfreedom from conflict. We all have a huge stake in \r\nachieving that objective. Resolution of the Palestinian \r\nquestion would tear out the fuse that threatens to ignite \r\nconflict in the Middle East and beyond. \r\n So today we add our voice to that of President \r\nObama and of others who believe that this dispute can, \r\nand must, be solved. And we call on all Members of \r\nthe United Nations to lend their support to this process \r\nin the critical weeks ahead. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Össur Skarphéðinsson, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and External Trade of the \r\nRepublic of Iceland. \r\n A/65/PV.15\r\n \r\n53 10-54965 \r\n \r\n Mr. Skarphéðinsson (Iceland): Let me start by \r\ncongratulating His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss on his \r\nelection to the presidency at the sixty-fifth session of \r\nthe General Assembly, and assuring him of the fullest \r\ncooperation of the Icelandic delegation. \r\n When I spoke for the first time from this \r\ndistinguished rostrum last year, my country was \r\nravaged by financial crisis. It left Iceland with a total \r\ncollapse of the entire banking system. Our financial \r\ncrisis was exacerbated by the worldwide recession, but \r\nI have to tell you, honestly, that to a large extent it was \r\nmade in Iceland. It was the product of a system that \r\nembraced the neo-liberalistic view of rampant \r\ncapitalism with lax regulations. Economic emergency \r\nlaws had to be passed. And we needed the helping hand \r\nof our close family in the North, the Nordic nations, \r\nnot least the Faroese, and our friends the Poles, in the \r\nform of currency loans, just to prevent our society from \r\nmelting down. \r\n Now we have swallowed the bitter medicine of \r\nfiscal cuts and radical financial reforms. We have \r\nembarked on close cooperation with the International \r\nMonetary Fund. And Iceland has now applied for \r\nmembership of the European Union, on which the \r\nIcelandic people will decide in a referendum in due \r\ncourse. \r\n A specially appointed prosecutor is now handling \r\nthe cases of bankers who allegedly broke the law, and \r\nthis week, parliament in Iceland is debating whether to \r\nprosecute former ministers. So we took firm, decisive \r\naction. \r\n Well, I can tell you, the medicine worked. Iceland \r\nis pulling through. We are finally on the road to \r\nrecovery. We are blessed with ample resources in the \r\nform of fish in the ocean, the fierce power of our \r\nwaterfalls and geothermal geysers and a pristine \r\nnatural environment that supports a flourishing tourism \r\nsector. Economic growth is, finally, returning to \r\nIceland. \r\n I am therefore very happy to inform the Assembly \r\nthat, this summer, the International Monetary Fund \r\ndeclared that, technically, the recession in Iceland is \r\nover. I want to use this opportunity to thank Member \r\nStates for their support and their understanding. \r\n The crisis turned our eyes back to what really \r\nmatters in life, the core values of democracy and \r\nhuman rights. At home, we have taken important steps \r\nto change the Constitution to increase the people’s \r\npower. We are also proud of having legally ensured full \r\nequality for same-sex partnerships, and we strongly \r\nurge other nations to remove all discrimination based \r\non sexual orientation. \r\n As the Assembly knows, our foreign policy has \r\nalways reflected the high priority we place on gender \r\nequality. This year, we celebrate 95 years since women \r\nfirst gained the right to vote and 30 years ago since a \r\nwoman was first elected President in Iceland. As \r\nmembers saw for themselves, with their own eyes, \r\nwhen the Icelandic Prime Minister spoke here this \r\nweek, the Icelandic Government is now led by a \r\nwoman. \r\n In New York, we also have cause to celebrate. \r\nIceland for years has supported a new and consolidated \r\nUnited Nations gender entity, and, look, today it is a \r\nreality. Well done, United Nations, you deserve a big \r\npile of thanks for your vision and for your courage. I \r\ncan state that Iceland will be a strong supporter of UN \r\nWomen, just as we have been through the transitional \r\nphase. \r\n There is also, I believe, another cause for this \r\nAssembly to celebrate, and that is the fact that next \r\nmonth we will celebrate the 10-year anniversary of \r\nresolution 1325 (2000). This has been a priority of the \r\nforeign policy of Iceland. Let the nations of the United \r\nNations come together to celebrate by increasing the \r\nparticipation of women in peace negotiations. \r\nEmpowering women is empowering society. \r\n But it is exactly with reference to women’s rights \r\nthat we have learned with utter sadness about the \r\ndecision of Iranian courts to stone to death an Iranian \r\nwoman, Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani. President \r\nAhmadinejad, on behalf of the Icelandic people, I ask \r\nyou to spare Ashtiani. \r\n When we address the looming dangers of climate \r\nchange, human rights are also at stake. Climate change \r\nwill wreak havoc on the lives of a great number of \r\npeople. It will erode what we as an international \r\ncommunity have defined as their basic human rights. \r\n Let me take three different examples. The small \r\nisland nations in the Pacific are threatened by rising \r\nsea levels to such an extent that whole nations might be \r\nforced to leave the land of their forebears — Kiribati, \r\nfor instance. The floods in Pakistan caused death to \r\nmany and devastation to tens of millions of people. The \r\nA/65/PV.15  \r\n \r\n10-54965 54 \r\n \r\nmelting of the Arctic ice may prevent my neighbours, \r\nthe Inuits, from pursuing their traditional lifestyle \r\nbased on hunting on the ice. \r\n All this is aggravated by the limitless use of fossil \r\nfuels that is literally tipping the delicate balance of \r\nnature. We, the wealthy nations of the world, are \r\ntherefore paying for the quality of our good life with \r\nthe human rights of others. If we do not take drastic \r\naction, more radical action than what was agreed in \r\nCopenhagen, future generations will see ours as serial \r\noffenders against the human rights of peoples in need. \r\n At the same time, millions of people lack access \r\nto safe drinking water and sanitation. It is a firm \r\nposition of my Government that the right to safe \r\ndrinking water and basic sanitation should be \r\nrecognized as a human right, essential for the real and \r\nfull enjoyment of life and all other human rights. \r\n In the fight against climate change, Iceland tries \r\nto lead by example. We already meet 80 per cent of our \r\nenergy needs through renewables, and that is far higher \r\nthan any other nation can claim. We have campaigned \r\nfor a new global climate fund with the goal of \r\nfinancing the transfer of green technologies to \r\ndeveloping countries. \r\n But we in Iceland also want to contribute in \r\nanother way. As the Assembly knows, we have not \r\nbeen able to stop the volcanoes in Iceland from \r\nerupting with huge clouds of ash, but we have learned \r\nto harness the fierce power of the fire beneath, and put \r\nit to use as geothermal energy. Geothermal by itself, of \r\ncourse, will not solve all the climate problems, but in \r\nsome parts of the world it could make a huge \r\ndifference. \r\n In East Africa, the utilization of geothermal \r\npotential could free the people of several nations from \r\nthe bondage of energy poverty. They do, however, lack \r\nthe geothermal expertise and the finances for the \r\ninfrastructure. \r\n Iceland, therefore, has formally engaged in \r\ndiscussions with some of the big nations operating, for \r\nexample, in East Africa to form a partnership for a \r\ngeothermal drive in countries with unused potential. \r\nIceland would put up the expertise, the partners the \r\nnecessary financing. This initiative could enable some \r\ncountries to escape from energy poverty, industrialize \r\nwithout undue emissions and embark on the road to \r\nprosperity. \r\n I have spent almost this entire speech of mine \r\ntonight talking about human rights in one form or \r\nanother, and human rights cannot be debated without \r\ndiscussing the plight of the Palestinians and the people \r\nof Gaza. We now have the results of the experts, \r\nmandated by the Human Rights Council, who \r\nconcluded that Israel broke international law by \r\nattacking the flotilla bringing humanitarian assistance \r\nto Gaza last spring. \r\n Iceland has strongly condemned the raid. It drew \r\na strong reaction from Icelandic society at large. I can \r\ntell the Assembly that the Icelandic nation is deeply \r\nsympathetic to the plight of the Palestinians, held in \r\noccupation by an oppressing Power. As I speak, we \r\nhave Icelandic humanitarian workers being held up in \r\nIsrael, trying to bring prosthetic feet to people in Gaza \r\nwho have lost their limbs, people that urgently need \r\nassistance. This is not acceptable to Iceland. This is not \r\nacceptable to the world. This is inhuman and unjust, \r\nand we urge Israel not to prevent humanitarian \r\nassistance from reaching the needy in Gaza. \r\n Yesterday, we heard President Obama urge \r\npatience, but we also heard a hidden hope in his words. \r\nWell, we know that sometimes dreams come true. \r\nSometimes the unexpected happens. Sometimes we \r\neven have miracles. We in Iceland will, of course, \r\nstrongly support the resumed direct talks, and let us all \r\nhope and pray for a solution that will allow us, as soon \r\nas possible, to welcome the independent State of \r\nPalestine as the 193rd member of the United Nations \r\nfamily. \r\n In the meantime, all of us should use every \r\npossible, sensible way to demonstrate our solidarity \r\nwith the people of Palestine. My country, Iceland, was \r\nnot afraid to stand up and be counted on behalf of the \r\npeople in the Baltic States almost 20 years ago, when \r\nIceland was the first country to break the ice and \r\nrecognize their independence. The same happened with \r\nregard to Croatia, Slovenia and later Montenegro. And \r\ntoday Iceland is not afraid to stand up for the \r\nPalestinian people either. Every nation has a duty to \r\ndefend human rights. Every nation has a duty to speak \r\nup. That is no less true for Palestine, where human \r\nrights are broken — especially in Gaza — every day. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Basile Ikouebe, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs and Cooperation of the Republic of the \r\nCongo. \r\n A/65/PV.15\r\n \r\n55 10-54965 \r\n \r\n Mr. Ikouebe (Congo) (spoke in French): As we \r\nopen this session of the General Assembly the world is \r\nstill facing problems of peace and security, crises, \r\nconflicts, inequality among States, poverty, hunger and \r\ndisease. To those recurrent problems are added new \r\nchallenges, such as climate change, natural disasters, \r\nterrorism, piracy, transnational organized crime, human \r\ntrafficking, nuclear proliferation and the world \r\neconomic and financial crisis. All these many issues by \r\ntheir very nature call out to the whole of the \r\ninternational community and demand global, \r\ncollective, coordinated solutions. \r\n The United Nations because of its global nature \r\noffers now more than ever the best framework for \r\nfinding lasting solutions. To do that, we need a strong, \r\nreformed Organization that can respond to the new \r\ndemands of our time. In this connection, my delegation \r\nwelcomes the new entity UN Women and the \r\nappointment at its head of the former President of \r\nChile, Michelle Bachelet — a brilliant woman, to \r\nwhom I wish every success. \r\n We will need to work with determination to bring \r\nabout the reforms necessary to restore to the United \r\nNations its operation as a global Organization and to \r\nmake it a real instrument of world governance. The \r\nprocess must continue with reform of the Security \r\nCouncil, both in its membership and its working \r\nmethods. Also we should continue to deal with the \r\nmatter of how to strengthen the General Assembly and \r\nits role. \r\n The High-level Plenary Meeting on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) that ended \r\n22 September culminated in the adoption of an \r\noutcome document (resolution 65/1) that exhorts us to \r\nkeep our promises. We welcome it. Indeed, we must \r\nunite to attain these Goals. As I said at that time, just \r\ntwo days ago, Congo’s commitment to reaching the \r\nMDGs remains firm. \r\n While ten years after the Goals were announced \r\nthe overall results in achieving them are mixed, \r\nespecially in Africa, it is nevertheless undeniable that \r\nmajor advances have been made in Africa during that \r\nsame period in such other essential areas as peace, \r\nsecurity and democracy. Africa as a whole is \r\nincreasingly emerging from a cycle of armed conflicts \r\nthat have greatly worked against its forward progress \r\ntowards development and prosperity. Today, thanks to \r\nthe efforts of the African Union, the backing of the \r\ninternational community and the involvement of \r\nAfrican leaders themselves, many conflicts have been \r\nor are being resolved. With that in mind, 2010 has been \r\nnamed a year of peace and security in Africa. \r\n Despite difficulties encountered here and there in \r\ncarrying out electoral processes, in a general way \r\ndemocracy is undeniably making a home in Africa. In \r\nGabon and Burundi, to mention only those two \r\ncountries, the popular will has expressed itself freely. \r\nWe nurture the hope that the elections upcoming in the \r\nnext months, notably in Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, the \r\nNiger, Nigeria, the Central African Republic and the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, will play out in a \r\nclimate of calm. That is likewise our hope for the \r\nreferendum to be held in South Sudan, as called for in \r\nthe Comprehensive Peace Agreement. In this \r\nconnection we call on the international community to \r\ncontinue supporting that process until it is completed. \r\n On the subject of Central Africa, the United \r\nNations Office about to open will provide an additional \r\ntool, besides existing mechanisms, to promote good \r\ngovernance and build peace, cooperation and \r\ndevelopment. In the same vein of building confidence \r\nand peace in our subregion, from 15-19 November \r\nBrazzaville will be hosting the thirty-first meeting of \r\nthe United Nations Standing Advisory Committee on \r\nSecurity Questions in Central Africa. On that occasion \r\nthe States of the subregion will seal their commitment \r\nto fight the traffic in small arms and light weapons, by \r\nsigning the Kinshasa Convention. \r\n Since the tragic events that brought such \r\nsuffering to my country in the 1990s and early 2000s, \r\nthe Congolese Government has invested in the quest \r\nfor peace and national reconciliation, and works to \r\npreserve that precious accomplishment. Moreover, our \r\ngood neighbour policy — a policy we have always \r\nadvocated — is one of the pillars of our foreign policy. \r\nIt is evident today in the way in which we are handling \r\nthe humanitarian crisis resulting from the arrival in our \r\nterritory of over 100,000 nationals from Équateur \r\nProvince in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. \r\nThe signing this past 10 June of the tripartite accord \r\namong the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo and the Office of the United \r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees should make \r\npossible an imminent resolution of the problem and \r\ncontribute to stabilizing the situation in our brother \r\ncountry so in need of peace and security, especially on \r\nthe eve of its elections. \r\nA/65/PV.15  \r\n \r\n10-54965 56 \r\n \r\n Here I would like to thank the all the bilateral and \r\nmultilateral partners, namely France, Italy, the United \r\nStates of America, the World Food Programme and the \r\nOffice of the High Commissioner for Refugees, for all \r\nthe assistance they have graciously given us. \r\n We have just dedicated a high-level segment to \r\nbiodiversity in this year 2010, which has been \r\nproclaimed the International Year of Biodiversity. Yet \r\nanother new challenge of our age, biodiversity is \r\ncrucial to life on earth and holds especial interest for \r\nthe Congo, since we are one of the countries that \r\nhouses the Congo Basin, a major carbon sink. We have \r\nno doubt that the results of this segment will resonate \r\ninto the upcoming meetings in Nagoya, Japan, in \r\nOctober and in Cancún, Mexico, in November and \r\nDecember. \r\n The President of our Republic, Denis Sassou \r\nNguesso, holds the question of biodiversity to be of \r\ncritical global importance, because tropical forests play \r\na vital role in regulating and stabilizing the global \r\nclimate and generally in providing environmental \r\nservices. In this context, the Copenhagen Agreement, \r\nwhich took into account the process of reducing \r\nemissions from deforestation and degradation, known \r\nas REDD-plus, represented the culmination of major \r\nefforts deployed by the three forest basins, the Amazon \r\nBasin in South and Central America, the Congo Basin \r\nin Central Africa and the Mekong Basin in South-East \r\nAsia.  \r\n With our partners in dialogue and cooperation of \r\nthe Forest eleven tropical rainforest countries, the \r\nRepublic of the Congo reaffirms its will and \r\ndetermination to meet the challenges of conservation \r\nand the promotion of biodiversity. Such an effort can \r\nbring about lasting results only if it is supported by \r\nadditional financing that is sustainable and predictable. \r\n The question of human rights is also on the \r\nagenda for this session. My Government promotes \r\nhuman rights because they are so closely related to \r\npeace and development. With regard to human rights, \r\nthe Congo has always acted within the process of \r\ninternational legitimacy. That is evident in the \r\nphilosophy underpinning our Constitution, in what we \r\ndo on a day-to-day basis and in our extensive \r\nparticipation in the relevant international instruments.  \r\n Domestically, besides promulgating a law on the \r\nprotection of the child in the Republic of the Congo, \r\nour Parliament will shortly adopt a bill on promoting \r\nand protecting the rights of indigenous peoples, which \r\nthe Government has just submitted to it. The Republic \r\nof the Congo has undertaken a number of initiatives in \r\nthis field, thus taking an important step towards \r\nrecognizing, defending and protecting the rights of \r\nminorities. Next November, the Special Rapporteur on \r\nthe situation of human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms of indigenous people will visit Brazzaville. \r\nThat will be an opportune moment for dialogue and \r\nconsultations on matters related to indigenous peoples. \r\nIt should also help us speed up the implementation of \r\nrecommendations of the universal periodic review, a \r\nHuman Rights Council mechanism of which my \r\ncountry was the subject from 6 to 8 May 2009 in \r\nGeneva.  \r\n My country is a candidate for membership in the \r\nHuman Rights Council for the period from 2011 to \r\n2014, and we thus reaffirm our commitment to \r\nfulfilling our international commitments and to \r\nsupporting efforts of the international community to \r\nstrengthening those rights. I therefore take this \r\nopportunity to appeal for the Assembly’s support for \r\nour candidacy in the elections, which will be held in \r\nMay 2011. \r\n On 15 August 2010, my country celebrated the \r\nfiftieth anniversary of its independence. The day was \r\ndevoted to the theme of remembering, but also and \r\nabove all, of responsibilities and action. On that \r\noccasion, the Government announced a number of \r\nsocio-economic measures to benefit our people. Those \r\nmeasures were made possible by the release of \r\nadditional financial resources following the significant \r\nforeign debt relief because of Congo’s accession to the \r\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. \r\nThose measures are part of the Government’s resolve \r\nto move towards attaining the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals.  \r\n Such an enabling situation will allow my country \r\nto lay the foundations for an emerging economy. \r\nIndeed, it is President Denis Sassou Nguesso’s \r\nambition to make Congo a modern and prosperous \r\nState that plays its part in the family of free modern \r\nnations. But that ambition, however legitimate, can be \r\nachieved only in a world that is safer, more just and \r\nwith more solidarity.  \r\n More than ever before, we must return to the \r\nideals that inspired the founding fathers of the League \r\nof Nations and the United Nations. We must place the \r\n A/65/PV.15\r\n \r\n57 10-54965 \r\n \r\nmoral values and the deep aspirations of our peoples at \r\nthe heart of our work. This is the world that we all \r\naspire to. This is the world that we should strive to \r\nbuild in this Hall. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mario Canahuati, Secretary of \r\nState, Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Honduras. \r\n Mr. Canahuati (Honduras) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nOn behalf of the people and Government of Honduras, \r\nI wish to recognize Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki for his \r\nleadership during the previous session. I also \r\ncongratulate President Joseph Deiss on his election to \r\nthe Assembly presidency and the Secretary-General, \r\nBan Ki-moon, on his wise leadership of our \r\nOrganization. \r\n In this same house of the peoples of the United \r\nNations, at the world summit on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), our President, Porfirio \r\nLobo Sosa, highlighted the faith that our country has in \r\nthis Organization and in its Charter for achieving a \r\nworld that is more peaceful, prosperous and fair (see \r\nA/65/PV.3). As a founding Member of the United \r\nNations and a peace-loving country, we reaffirm our \r\nobligations. As we have been working, ceaselessly and \r\ntogether with many other Member States, since the \r\nbirth of the Organization, we will continue to work to \r\nfully realize the ideals enshrined in the San Francisco \r\nCharter.  \r\n Honduras — which is geographically small but \r\ngreat of spirit and generous in its democratic and \r\npeaceful vocation — has involved itself in the world, \r\nbasing itself on the principles of equal rights, self-\r\ndetermination for peoples and non-interference in \r\ninternal affairs.  \r\n The imperative of promoting economic and social \r\nprogress for all nations moves us to acknowledge that \r\nthe MDGs have been a first step in the right direction. \r\nWe agree with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon that the \r\nMillennium Goals are not easy, but they are achievable. \r\nHowever, the struggle against poverty requires \r\nadditional efforts that recognize the fact that we have a \r\ncollective responsibility to protect and share what the \r\nPresident of Honduras has called global common \r\ngoods, including solidarity.  \r\n Another global good should be the prudent \r\nmanagement of our economies. The financial crises \r\nhave proven that that responsibility does not fall just to \r\nthe developing countries. It is so important that, \r\naccording to the World Bank, the recent crises in food, \r\nfuel and finances have sunk an additional 64 million \r\nhuman beings into poverty. Such crises can make our \r\nefforts to fight poverty more difficult or even \r\nimpossible.  \r\n The opening of trade and of financial systems is \r\nanother global good. Access to international markets is \r\nas important as official development assistance itself, \r\nalthough it does not replace it. We must add efforts to \r\nenable foreign direct investment in our developing \r\nnations; access to technology, in particular technology \r\nhaving to do with medications; the reduction of \r\ngreenhouse gases; and the non-proliferation of nuclear \r\nweapons. \r\n The challenge of achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals before 2015 in a manner as \r\nresponsible as possible lies with our Government. \r\nGiven the results already achieved and what remains to \r\nbe done, President Lobo Sosa has launched an appeal \r\nto start talks as soon as possible on a new global \r\nagreement that will guide our actions and goals after \r\n2015.  \r\n We firmly believe that poverty is not only the \r\nshortage of material goods, but also the lack of \r\nopportunities. That is why we are committed to respect \r\nfor human dignity, the common good, support and \r\nhuman solidarity. Those four principles are not just a \r\nmoral imperative; in the case of Honduras, they are a \r\nnational imperative. \r\n In that regard, with broad consultation with civil \r\nsociety, the political parties and other independent \r\nsectors, we adopted a country vision and national plan \r\nthat sets out four focal points for achieving our \r\nnational goals, inspired by the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals: a Honduras without poverty, \r\neducated and healthy, with robust social welfare \r\nsystems; a Honduras that is developing in democracy, \r\nwith security and without violence, with absolute \r\nrespect for human rights; a productive Honduras that \r\ngenerates opportunities and decent jobs, that \r\nsustainably exploits its resources and that reduces \r\nenvironmental vulnerability; and a modern, \r\ntransparent, responsible, efficient and competitive \r\nState, with fully independent branches of government.  \r\n The cohesion of our society, unity, reconciliation, \r\ngovernance, coexistence and peace all depend on \r\nachieving that. That is why we are engaged in building \r\nA/65/PV.15  \r\n \r\n10-54965 58 \r\n \r\nan inclusive society, since no country is so poor that it \r\ncannot show solidarity with those that are even poorer.  \r\n Our first commitment is to helping people in \r\nextreme poverty through the “Bono 10,000” \r\nprogramme. Bono 10,000 is a credit programme that \r\nwill greatly strengthen family economics and, \r\nfurthermore, is conditional on steps to improve the \r\naccess of the most vulnerable Hondurans to education, \r\nhealth care and nutrition through the broad \r\ndissemination of the School Snack scheme and other \r\nfood security programmes. \r\n We are strengthening the decentralization \r\nprocesses and improving citizen participation in the \r\nmaking, implementation, monitoring and assessment of \r\npublic policies. We are also addressing social \r\ninequality by creating economic opportunities at the \r\nlocal level. \r\n Productive programmes, such as the United States \r\nMillennium Challenge Corporation in Honduras, have \r\nhad a huge impact on the recipients, resulting in a very \r\nsignificant increase in the income of the farmers \r\nparticipating in the programme. With the same aim of \r\ngenerating greater income for families, we have \r\nlaunched a programme to finance microbusinesses and \r\nsmall enterprises, thanks to the cooperation \r\nprogrammes of the European Union, Japan and Taiwan, \r\nas well as all those countries that are extending the \r\nhand of solidarity to our people.  \r\n In all those programmes, women are a particular \r\ntarget of our Government’s efforts because we know \r\nthat, along with the fight against poverty, we must \r\ncombat gender inequality. \r\n While we work at the local and community \r\nlevels, we are also promoting private investment. The \r\npurpose is to create decent jobs for more than 200,000 \r\nyoung people who join the labour market annually. The \r\nGovernment of Honduras bases the successful \r\nimplementation of its social agenda on a social market \r\neconomy. \r\n With those premises in mind, our Government \r\nhas drawn up a national programme to promote \r\ninvestment for the period 2010 to 2014 in six main \r\nsectors: industries generating more and better jobs, \r\nagro-food and forestry production, clean generation of \r\nenergy, tourism development, infrastructure to support \r\nmanufacturing, and water and sanitation. We will \r\ndevelop those programmes within the new framework \r\nof the law on public-private partnerships, the law on \r\nrural and marginal urban employment, a new law on \r\nclean energy and the law on promoting and protecting \r\ninvestments.  \r\n With such efforts, a new era is opening in \r\nHonduras with the creation of conditions so that \r\nprivate business can boost sustained economic growth \r\nwith social responsibility and the country is guided \r\ntowards prosperity and stability. \r\n Honduras is ready to better address the challenges \r\nof reducing its vulnerability to natural disasters and \r\nclimate change. The law on land management makes it \r\npossible to utilize and protect the land properly, with \r\nresponsible management of the natural resources. At \r\nthe same time, we have launched a national risk \r\nmanagement system. \r\n Efforts to improve the social situation and to \r\nboost economic growth must be based on a legal and \r\ninstitutional foundation. There is a strong link between \r\nindividual freedom and political stability with \r\neconomic growth and social justice. Higher rates of \r\neconomic growth that are sustainable over time also \r\nhelp to create the social conditions for governance, \r\nconfidence and smaller political threats. \r\n For 30 years, we Hondurans have strived to \r\ndevelop our democratic institutions. The international \r\ncommunity has supported us throughout that process. \r\nAt the end of the third decade of our democracy, we \r\nhad an institutional system that had ceased to be the \r\nmonopoly of the executive branch and that shared \r\npower more evenly among the judicial, legislative and \r\nexecutive organs. \r\n Despite that progress, we underwent a political \r\ncrisis, from which we emerged when the Honduran \r\npeople turned out in huge numbers on 29 November \r\n2009 to vote in the election with the greatest turnout \r\nand transparency in our electoral history. We \r\nHondurans exercised our popular sovereignty and our \r\nright to self-determination. We sent an unequivocal \r\nmessage: we love democracy and our institutions, and \r\nwe prefer dialogue to conflict. That is our message, \r\nwhich has been understood and respected by the great \r\nmajority of the nations represented here. We wish it to \r\nbe acknowledged by all Governments in the world. \r\n In that spirit, President Porfirio Lobo Sosa \r\nendorsed a broad amnesty for political crimes and \r\nformed a Government of national unity, with the \r\n A/65/PV.15\r\n \r\n59 10-54965 \r\n \r\nparticipation of all the country’s political parties. \r\nFurthermore, the President decreed the creation of the \r\nTruth and Reconciliation Commission — a totally \r\nindependent body that will ensure that the critical \r\nevents of 2009 will never happen again. The work of \r\nthe Commission is already under way, and its report is \r\nexpected during the first quarter of next year. Its \r\nconclusions will be broadly disseminated and its \r\nrecommendations will be implemented.  \r\n We are convinced that national reconciliation and \r\nunity are based on respect for all sectors of society \r\nirrespective of political or ideological position. \r\nTolerance is and must be the foundation of democracy.  \r\n  We are also convinced that the human rights \r\nand fundamental freedoms of citizens must be \r\nrespected without restriction. The President of the \r\nHonduras has proposed to the National Congress the \r\ncreation a Secretary of State for Justice to promote and \r\ntake charge of designing, implementing, supervising \r\nand evaluating all public policies and ensuring that \r\nthey are based squarely on human rights principles.  \r\n Inspired by our respect for human dignity, our \r\nGovernment condemns all forms of racial \r\ndiscrimination and enthusiastically welcomes the \r\nforthcoming launch of the International Year for People \r\nof African Descent. To implement our commitment \r\nagainst racial discrimination, Honduras is creating an \r\nentity for the development of indigenous peoples and \r\nAfro-Honduran people and a policy of racial equality. \r\n In the context of those commitments any person \r\ndeprived of liberty must be treated with the respect \r\ninherent in his human dignity. To that end, the \r\nPresident approved an executive decree aimed at \r\nreducing overcrowding in the penal institutions \r\nthrough renovation of their infrastructure and \r\nequipment. \r\n Along that same line, the Government of \r\nHonduras has energetically condemned and continues \r\nto condemn human rights violations, especially \r\nviolation of the right to life. We are firmly committed \r\nto the fight against impunity and will continue to make \r\nevery possible effort to bring to justice those who \r\nviolate that essential right of the human person. \r\n We are thankful for the cooperation we have \r\nreceived so far in overcoming difficulties in \r\nguaranteeing security for our citizens. President Lobo \r\nSosa has also asked Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to \r\nhave the United Nations consider support for setting up \r\na commission to fight impunity, in order to support \r\nnational institutions and strengthen their capacities as \r\nthey carry out their tasks in investigating and \r\nprosecuting crime. At the same time, we reiterate our \r\nGovernment’s invitation to the agencies that make up \r\nthe United Nations human rights system to follow up \r\non the situation in Honduras.  \r\n I wish to convey the ongoing appreciation of \r\nHondurans to the United Nations system and its \r\nSecretary-General for all the cooperation and \r\nassistance given our country. We thank all of those who \r\nhave firmly supported Honduras, because that has \r\nbenefited our people directly. \r\n I want to highlight the solidarity and friendship \r\nthat exist among the brothers of the Central American \r\nregion. Within the Central American Integration \r\nSystem we will continue to go forward until our \r\ncommon homeland becomes one great nation, beyond \r\nthe limits of the historic Central America. \r\n Our Government is aware of the difficulties and \r\nchallenges of the moment in history in which we are \r\nliving, and we are taking decisions based on that \r\nawareness. Today I can state with conviction that we \r\nare moving along the path to prosperity, because I \r\nbelieve in the determination of the people of Honduras, \r\ntheir ability to deal with adversity, their hard work, \r\ntheir strength of heart and their sprit and hope. We \r\nhave an unbreakable will; we have the human capital.  \r\n The time has come to reaffirm our commitment \r\nand to act in favour of the poorest members of society. \r\nThe time has come to act in solidarity and with \r\ndetermination so that all human beings may be \r\nprotected from discrimination and need. It is time to \r\ncreate a world with tolerance, with harmony and with \r\nfreedom and security for all. The time to globalize \r\nsocial justice with freedom and democracy is now. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Arabic): We \r\nhave heard the last speaker in the general debate for \r\nthis meeting. One delegation has requested the right to \r\nreply. \r\n Before giving the floor to the representatives who \r\nhave asked to speak in exercise of the right of reply, I \r\nremind members that statements in exercise of the right \r\nof reply should be limited to 10 minutes for the first \r\nstatement and 5 minutes for the second, and should be \r\nmade by delegations from their seats. \r\nA/65/PV.15  \r\n \r\n10-54965 60 \r\n \r\n I give the floor to the representative of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran. \r\n Mr. Salsabili (Islamic Republic of Iran): I have \r\ntwo points to clarify in exercise of the right of reply.  \r\n First, this morning the Prime Minister of the \r\nfriendly State of Kuwait referred in his remarks to \r\nthose Iranian islands located in the Persian Gulf. My \r\ndelegation would like to make clear that there is no \r\nconflict whatsoever over those islands, as they are an \r\neternal part of the Iranian territory and are under the \r\nsovereignty of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Therefore, \r\nwe regret the use of inappropriate qualifications for \r\nthese Iranian islands in the Persian Gulf. \r\n It goes without saying that the Islamic Republic \r\nof Iran continues to spare no efforts in strengthening its \r\ngood-neighbourly and brotherly relations with all \r\nneighbouring countries, including the Persian Gulf \r\nlittoral States.  \r\n As a second point, my delegation would like to \r\ncomment on the remarks of the Deputy Prime Minister \r\nof the United Kingdom, which was delivered this \r\nmorning (see A/65/PV.14). The United Kingdom  \r\n \r\ndelegate made bizarre comments on a part of the \r\naddress made by the President of the Islamic Republic \r\nof Iran to the General Assembly yesterday (see \r\nA/65/PV.12). President Ahmadinejad simply raised a \r\nnumber of questions concerning one of the main events \r\nof the past decade, which has affected all international \r\nrelations and which has entailed wide consequences all \r\nover the world, including in my region. \r\n We would submit that such a hasty and weird \r\nreaction only indicates the increasing level of \r\nintolerance and disregard for the freedom of expression \r\nand opinion as values for which, ironically, he regards \r\nhimself as the sole advocate.  \r\n My delegation would like to assure the \r\nrepresentative of the United Kingdom that the time has \r\nlong passed when less than a handful of power centres \r\ndictated to world public opinion on how to think. I \r\nwould also like to recall that the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran was among the first nations that expressed a clear \r\nposition that the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 \r\nconstituted a cowardly and atrocious crime.  \r\n  The meeting rose at 10.15 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
