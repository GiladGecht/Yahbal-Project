(Switzerland) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. José Ramos-Horta, \r\nPresident of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste. \r\n  Mr. José Ramos-Horta, President of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste, was escorted \r\ninto the General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. José Ramos-\r\nHorta, President of the Democratic Republic of Timor-\r\nLeste, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Ramos-Horta: I have been given such \r\na bad spot on the speaking list that I feel as if I am in a \r\nFellini movie, speaking to an empty Hall. Still, because \r\nI believe in ghosts, I believe that the friendly ghosts of \r\nthose who are not present are here to listen, and I \r\nprofusely thank those who bothered to come on this \r\nSaturday afternoon. \r\n Mr. President, in compensation for my having the \r\nworst possible time slot in the general debate, when I \r\nsee you this afternoon I hope you will have a nice box \r\nof Swiss chocolates to give to me. \r\n We will not distribute the written version of my \r\nspeech because no one reads them anyway and it is a \r\nwaste of paper and money. However, anyone who is \r\ncurious enough about my speech will be able to find it \r\non the General Assembly’s website. It is a lengthy \r\nspeech — although I will not compete with Presidents \r\nObama, Ahmadinejad or Chávez — so I will skip \r\nthrough much of it, out of respect for the \r\nrepresentatives who have been here for a week \r\nlistening to many speeches. \r\n Still, I would fail my upbringing if I were not to \r\nthank the Mayor of New York and New Yorkers for \r\nwelcoming us to their city. We sympathize with the \r\nresidents of this city for the inconveniences we cause \r\nthem by our presence, even if most people would agree \r\nthat the United Nations and the numerous meetings \r\nheld here throughout the year bring enormous tangible \r\nand non-quantifiable benefits to the city. I also would \r\nlike thank the United States federal authorities for their \r\nexceptional efforts and professionalism in providing us \r\nwith a secure and friendly environment. \r\n I have never met Mayor Bloomberg, but he has \r\ngone up in our esteem and respect because of his \r\nintellectual clarity and moral courage in standing up \r\nfor the rights of American Muslims in building a \r\ncultural centre and a sacred place of worship in lower \r\nManhattan as a venue for reflection, learning and \r\nfraternity among cultures and religions. What better \r\nplace is there than lower Manhattan, near the World \r\nTrade Center, to signal the revulsion of American \r\nMuslims and moderate Muslims all over the world at \r\nthe actions of some extremists? I congratulate Mayor \r\nBloomberg for his moral courage and integrity. \r\n I was not present in this Hall when President \r\nAhmadinejad of the Islamic Republic of Iran addressed \r\nA/65/PV.17  \r\n \r\n10-55109 2 \r\n \r\nthis Assembly a few days ago. I was at Columbia \r\nUniversity, addressing an equally important gathering \r\nof young students and academics from many countries, \r\ncultures and religions. So I did not hear President \r\nAhmadinejad’s latest intellectual concoctions in this \r\nAssembly. I will not question the right of anyone to \r\nspeak his mind. President Ahmadinejad is entitled to \r\nbelieve in and regurgitate whatever intellectual, \r\nphilosophical or theological concoctions his unique \r\nmind may fabricate. However, I do not agree that any \r\nof us should disregard the basic rules and practices of \r\nconduct among leaders by uttering obscenities in this \r\nAssembly. What President Ahmadinejad said in this \r\nforum in regard to the terrorist attacks on the World \r\nTrade Center was an obscenity. He went too far, as he \r\nhas done many times before in this Assembly and in \r\nother forums, as when he has questioned the facts of \r\nthe Holocaust. \r\n Otherwise, we fully subscribe to Iran’s legitimate \r\nright to develop nuclear technology for peaceful \r\npurposes, and we caution the Powers that be not to \r\nhasten in reaching conclusions that may lead to \r\nirreversible, catastrophic decisions. We do have serious \r\ndoubts, however, about the reliability and safety of \r\nnuclear energy. Let us not forget the lessons of the \r\nThree Mile Island accident, which occurred at 4 a.m. \r\non 28 March 1979 in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, or the \r\neven worse Chernobyl nuclear meltdown of April 1986. \r\nThe recent catastrophic oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico \r\nwould pale by comparison with the blow-up of a \r\nnuclear energy facility. We do not know whether \r\nIranian rulers do or do not have the desire to be an \r\narmed nuclear Power. What we do know, however, is \r\nthat the possession of nuclear weapons is not a shortcut \r\nto super-Power status, as some in Asia seem to think, \r\nand does not insure anyone against twenty-first century \r\nconventional and non–conventional security threats. \r\n Nuclear weapons were developed as a result of \r\nthe tragic experiences of the Second World War and of \r\nmutual suspicion and fears pervasive among the \r\nPowers at that time. They have become obsolete. That \r\nis proven by the fact that the mighty Soviet nuclear and \r\nconventional arsenals were not able to prevent the \r\nimplosion of its Empire, the liberation of hundreds of \r\nmillions of people or the reunification of Germany. \r\nNuclear weapons are not going to be of much help in \r\nthe ongoing ethnic, religious and border disputes in \r\nAsia. We pray to God the Almighty and the Merciful \r\nthat these weapons and others, chemical and biological, \r\ndo not ever fall into the hands of extremist non-State \r\nentities. \r\n We gathered here from 20 to 22 September to \r\nreview the progress — or lack of it — on the pledges \r\nwe solemnly made before our peoples in 2000 to \r\neliminate or at least halve poverty by 2015. In Timor-\r\nLeste, we regained independence in 2002, and in the \r\nfirst years of our independence we set out to rebuild \r\nour country from the ashes of the violence of the past, \r\nlay the foundations of a functioning democratic State, \r\nheal our wounds, reconcile our divided communities \r\nand normalize relations with past external adversaries. \r\nIn only eight years and in spite of the overwhelming \r\nchallenges facing us, we have navigated out of the \r\nstorms to a new period of peace, stability and \r\neconomic growth. \r\n Timor-Leste is a least developed country, affected \r\nby pervasive poverty. We are still a fragile country, \r\npartly because we are only eight years old, and being \r\nan infant country, all the institutions of the State are \r\nyoung and fragile. However, the Almighty and the \r\nMerciful has blessed us with generous natural \r\nresources, such as oil and gas, enabling us to accelerate \r\nour overall development. \r\n Timor-Leste was not yet independent in 2000, \r\nand it was not until our first Millennium Development \r\nGoal report was issued in 2004 that the first targets \r\nwere set. For the past three years, Timor-Leste has \r\nenjoyed real peace and a robust economic growth of \r\nover 12 per cent. In the past two years, poverty levels \r\nhave decreased by as much as 9 per cent. Infant \r\nmortality and under-five mortality rates have been \r\nreduced and have already reached the 2015 target. \r\nSchool enrolment has increased from 65 per cent in \r\n2007 to 83 per cent in 2009-2010. Adult illiteracy is \r\nbeing gradually eliminated thanks to a joint programme \r\nbetween Timor-Leste and Cuba. We anticipate that, \r\nwithin two to three years, Timor-Leste will be \r\ncompletely free of illiteracy. About 30 per cent of our \r\ngeneral State budget is allocated to public health and \r\neducation. This turn-around is due largely thanks to \r\naggressive public financing of social such programmes \r\nas direct cash transfers to the elderly, widows, the \r\nhandicapped and veterans, and to determined efforts to \r\nexpand cultivated areas and increase food production. \r\n The first of the 800 Timorese medical students \r\nstudying in Cuba have returned home. In addition to \r\nthose studying medicine in Cuba, there are 200 more \r\n A/65/PV.17\r\n \r\n3 10-55109 \r\n \r\nenrolled in the medical school of our national \r\nuniversity. In addition, more than 200 Cuban doctors \r\nhave been assigned to Timor-Leste since 2004, \r\nworking side by side with Timorese doctors and nurses \r\ndelivering services to the remotest corners of the \r\ncountry and training our medical and health personnel. \r\nThe members of the famous Cuban Medical Brigade \r\nare true missionaries, as deserving of the Nobel Peace \r\nPrize as Mother Teresa. \r\n In Timor-Leste, this year we will finalize our own \r\nroad map, the 2011-2030 Strategic Development Plan, \r\nwhich will lift our people from centuries of poverty to \r\nthe level of an upper-middle-income country by 2030. \r\n With regard to the management of our petroleum \r\nresources, we are pleased to note that the Extractive \r\nIndustries Transparency Initiative in its most recent \r\nreport of 1 July, rated Timor-Leste number one in Asia \r\nand number three in the world for sound, transparent \r\nand effective management of our oil and gas revenues. \r\n Women make up almost 30 per cent of the \r\ndeputies in our national Parliament. Key cabinet \r\npositions in the executive branch — finance, justice, \r\nsocial solidarity, prosecutor-general and so on — are \r\nheld by women. A youth parliament, comprising \r\n130 youth parliamentarians ranging in ages from 12 to \r\n17 years, has been elected and will have its first formal \r\nsitting in November. I am pleased that our expectations \r\non balanced gender representation were in fact \r\nexceeded. The youth parliament counts 68 girl and \r\n62 boy deputies. \r\n Timor-Leste is proud to have one of the most \r\nhumanist Constitutions in the world. It prohibits the \r\ndeath penalty and its maximum prison sentence is \r\n25 years. We have also ratified all core international \r\nhuman rights treaties. Our Constitution gives primacy \r\nto international law over domestic law, such that all our \r\nlaws must conform to international law. \r\n As the Head of State guided by humanist beliefs \r\nand the relevant provisions of our Constitution, I have \r\nissued pardons to individuals who have been tried and \r\nfound guilty by the courts and have served a number of \r\nyears with good behaviour. We believe that the pursuit \r\nof justice cannot be dissociated from other \r\noverwhelming values, such as compassion and \r\nunderstanding of mitigating circumstances. \r\n I wish now to turn to some international issues. \r\nWe appeal to President Barack Obama to sign an \r\nexecutive order releasing five Cuban citizens who have \r\nlanguished in United States jails for over 10 years and \r\ndenied family visits. Even visits by the International \r\nCommittee of the Red Cross have not been authorized. \r\nThe United States should likewise lift the draconian \r\nfinancial and economic sanctions and trade embargo \r\nagainst Cuba. The Cuban people are among the few in \r\nthe world who are still suffering the inequities of the \r\ncold-war era. It would seem that, for some in the \r\nUnited States and in particular in the State of Florida, \r\nthe cold war is not over. \r\n The situation in Myanmar is an immensely \r\ncomplex one. It is a vast country fragmented along \r\nethnic lines and plagued by numerous armed groups \r\nfighting with different agendas. Based on our own \r\nexperience, we believe that in order to manage such \r\ncomplex challenges, be it in our own country, \r\nMyanmar or anywhere else, we must all show wisdom \r\nand engage in patient dialogue with those who do not \r\nagree with us so that together we can end conflict and \r\npull our countries out of poverty. \r\n With respect to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, we \r\ncommend the Israeli and Palestinian leaders for their \r\nrenewed dialogue under the auspices of the United \r\nStates Administration. To those in Palestine who, in \r\nspite of decades of suffering and humiliation, have \r\nresisted the temptation of extremism and violence, I \r\nbow. To those in Israel who have championed the cause \r\nof peace and the rights of the Palestinian people, I will \r\nsay that they represent the very best of the Jewish \r\npeople — a people who more than anyone else on \r\nEarth should understand the suffering and desire of \r\nothers for freedom. \r\n We urge Hamas to show statesmanship by \r\nrecognizing the State of Israel. Extremism, fanaticism \r\nand indiscriminate violence do harm to the noble \r\nPalestinian quest for dignity and freedom. At the same \r\ntime, we submit that Hamas and Hezbollah are genuine \r\npopular movements deeply rooted in the plight of \r\nmillions of poor, dispossessed, alienated and angry in \r\nthe Middle East. Labelling them terrorists and refusing \r\nto engage and build bridges with such groups is, in our \r\nview, not a sound policy. \r\n We urge Israel, a country founded on 5,000 years \r\nof history and born of centuries of persecution and war, \r\nto show the wisdom and generosity of the Jews by \r\nending the Gaza blockade, allowing unhindered access \r\nA/65/PV.17  \r\n \r\n10-55109 4 \r\n \r\nfor humanitarian assistance, and ending the land-\r\ngrabbing and colonization of the West Bank. \r\n On the question of Western Sahara, the aborted \r\ndecolonization of that territory and the endless plight \r\nof hundreds of thousands of Saharans in camps in \r\nAlgeria constitute an indictment of the international \r\ncommunity. This is not an issue as complex as \r\nAfghanistan or Palestine. How can we believe that \r\nthere will be an early resolution of these other \r\nseemingly intractable problems when there seems to be \r\nlittle political will to solve the Western Sahara \r\nproblem? \r\n I believe that I have already exceeded the time \r\nallocated to me by one minute and 35 seconds. I have a \r\nfew more words to say about foreign aid and climate \r\nchange, but I will skip that in order to respect \r\neverybody else, particularly those following me. Allow \r\nme only to say two words about United Nations \r\nreform. \r\n More than 60 years after its founding, the United \r\nNations has yet to undertake meaningful reform to \r\nmake it more representative of the world of the twenty-\r\nfirst century and to become more effective. And we are \r\nnot talking only about an expanded and more \r\nrepresentative Security Council. We are talking about \r\nmaking the United Nations and its many agencies and \r\nprogrammes less bureaucratic and more efficient in \r\ntheir internal management and service delivery. \r\n In regard to the Security Council, we restate our \r\nview that it has to be expanded to accommodate the \r\nnew demographic and economic realities of the twenty-\r\nfirst century. Major regional Powers like India and \r\nBrazil must be granted permanent member status in the \r\nSecurity Council. \r\n In concluding, on behalf of our people I thank the \r\ninternational community for the steady and generous \r\nassistance provided to us in our years of need. We \r\nwould not have been able to achieve the progress of the \r\npast years without the understanding of our friends and \r\npartners. \r\n We can all do better in Timor-Leste and \r\nelsewhere, and we must. With humility we \r\nacknowledge our failings and limitations. We are \r\ndetermined to live up to the expectations of our people \r\nand to lead them towards a peaceful and prosperous \r\nfuture. \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n  Mr. José Ramos-Horta, President of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste, was escorted \r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Václav Klaus, President  \r\nof the Czech Republic \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President of the Czech \r\nRepublic. \r\n  Mr. Václav Klaus, President of the Czech \r\nRepublic, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Václav Klaus, \r\nPresident of the Czech Republic, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly. \r\n President Klaus: First, I would like to \r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election to the very \r\nresponsible post of President of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-fifth session. \r\n I have the privilege of representing the Czech \r\nRepublic, a country in the very heart of Europe that has \r\nbeen actively involved in United Nations activities \r\nfrom the very beginning and will continue to be so. We \r\nare actively involved in a number of United Nations \r\nbodies, and Czech soldiers and experts have \r\nparticipated in United Nations peacekeeping missions \r\nfor many decades. It is in our interests for this \r\nOrganization to remain a respected high-level forum, \r\ncontributing to prosperity, stability and peaceful \r\nsolutions to conflicts around the world. \r\n It has been said here many times in the past few \r\ndays that today’s world is very different from that of \r\n1945, when this Organization was founded by \r\n51 States. It now consists of 192. That is not merely a \r\nquantitative change; it is much more. My country is \r\ntherefore deeply convinced that the structure of the \r\nUnited Nations also needs to be different, especially \r\nthat of the Security Council, which should be reformed \r\nto reflect the geopolitical, economic and demographic \r\nreality of the twenty-first century. It is frustrating that \r\ndiscussions of such reform have gone on for the past \r\n A/65/PV.17\r\n \r\n5 10-55109 \r\n \r\n16 years without results. It is time to come up with \r\nconcrete results, and my country is ready to support \r\nthem. \r\n Changes of this kind are necessary; on the other \r\nhand, some things must continue unchanged. I do not \r\nbelieve that the United Nations needs to search for a \r\nnew mission. Its goals should remain those defined in \r\nthe original Charter: to maintain international peace \r\nand security, to develop friendly relations among \r\nnations, and to achieve international cooperation in \r\nsolving international problems. The United Nations \r\nshould not diverge from these principles. It should not \r\nsearch for alternative or substitute projects to replace \r\nthose that enhance peace, freedom and democracy. It \r\nshould remain an intergovernmental platform, based on \r\nthe plurality of views of its Member States and on \r\nmutual respect for their sometimes differing positions. \r\n Let me briefly touch on two issues that form part \r\nof the current United Nations agenda. The first is the \r\nworldwide economic crisis and the methods used to \r\novercome it. I am afraid that we are moving in the \r\nwrong direction. The anti-crisis measures that have \r\nbeen proposed and already partly implemented follow \r\nfrom the assumption that the crisis was a failure of \r\nmarkets and that the right way out is more regulation \r\nof markets. This is a mistaken assumption. It will not \r\nbe possible to prevent any future crises by implementing \r\nsubstantial, market-damaging macroeconomic and regulatory \r\nGovernment interventions, as is being done now. That \r\nwill only destroy markets, and with them the chances \r\nfor economic growth and prosperity in developed and \r\ndeveloping countries alike. \r\n The solution to this or any other crisis does not \r\nlie in increasing protectionism, and it is a positive \r\nfactor that most Governments have behaved quite \r\nrationally in this respect. Nor does the solution lie in \r\nmore bureaucracy, in creating new governmental or \r\nsupranational agencies, or in aiming at global \r\ngovernance of the world’s economy. On the contrary, \r\nthis is the time for international organizations, \r\nincluding the United Nations, to reduce their spending, \r\nslim down their administrations and leave the solutions \r\nto the Governments of the Member States, which are \r\ndirectly accountable to the citizens of their countries. \r\n Developing countries should not be prevented \r\nfrom growing economically. They need access to \r\nforeign markets and they need free trade. It was in this \r\nforum last year that I emphasized that we must pay \r\nattention to the costs and benefits of our decisions. \r\nDeveloping countries must not be forced into \r\nagreements on ever more ambitious targets in the fight \r\nagainst climate change, particularly at a time when the \r\ndeveloped countries themselves are far from meeting \r\nthose targets. The United Nations should not have an \r\nall-encompassing agenda. It should not turn away from \r\npolitical topics towards scientific ones. It is here not to \r\ndetermine what science is, but to engage its Member \r\nStates in rational and reasoned debate about political \r\nissues. The most harmful political debate we have \r\nwitnessed in the past couple of years is about the \r\nclimate and global warming. \r\n We should not give up on elemental values and \r\nprinciples that most of us share, and this brings me to \r\nthe second issue I wish to mention here today — \r\nnuclear non proliferation. In April, my country hosted \r\nan important event during which the President of \r\nRussia and the President of the United States signed \r\nthe Treaty on Measures for the Further Reduction and \r\nLimitation of Strategic Offensive Arms. We see the \r\nTreaty as an important step forward and as a visible \r\nsign of our efforts to make our complicated world \r\nsafer. Let us hope that it will be taken further in the \r\nforeseeable future. \r\n We do not dispute the right of any country to use \r\natomic energy for peaceful purposes, but it must do so \r\nin a responsible way. It is not possible for some \r\ncountries to ignore agreed and respected international \r\nstandards, to threaten stability in their regions and to \r\nincrease the dangers of proliferation. \r\n The United Nations is a unique forum at which \r\nsmall and big countries alike are represented. They are \r\ncountries with different political, economic and social \r\nsystems; different neighbours; different historical \r\nexperiences and geopolitical positions; and, more \r\nimportantly, different levels of income, wealth and \r\ndevelopment. This is precisely what makes the United \r\nNations unique and irreplaceable. Instead of \r\nincreasingly becoming a source of funds for various, \r\nsometimes very dubious non-governmental \r\norganizations that — without any accountability or \r\ncontrol — seek to profit from United Nations activities, \r\nthe United Nations should strive to be an efficient body \r\nin which States and their peoples are represented. Its \r\ntask is not to push for global governance and play the \r\ncentral role in it. The United Nations exists primarily \r\nto enhance friendly relations among its Members and \r\nA/65/PV.17  \r\n \r\n10-55109 6 \r\n \r\nto look for solutions to problems that cannot be \r\nconfined to national boundaries. \r\n I wish you every success in your office, \r\nMr. President, and I would like to assure you that the \r\nCzech Republic will continue to be an active Member \r\nof the United Nations. \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Czech Republic for the statement he has just made. \r\n  Mr. Václav Klaus, President of the Czech \r\nRepublic, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\n \r\nAddress by Mr. Anote Tong, President, Head of \r\nGovernment and Minister for Foreign Affairs  \r\nof the Republic of Kiribati \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the President, Head of \r\nGovernment and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nRepublic of Kiribati. \r\n  Mr. Anote Tong, President, Head of Government \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of \r\nKiribati, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to \r\nthe United Nations His Excellency Mr. Anote Tong, \r\nPresident, Head of Government and Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Kiribati, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly. \r\n President Tong: Every year, we gather in this \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall to take stock of our \r\nachievements in the pursuit of a more peaceful, more \r\nsecure and a better world for all citizens of the global \r\ncommunity. \r\n As it emerged from the ashes of devastating \r\nworld wars, the United Nations heralded a new era and \r\na new world order of international cooperation in the \r\npursuit of international peace and security. It is \r\npremised on the principles of sovereign equality and \r\npeaceful coexistence. \r\n Taking stock of what we have achieved since \r\nthen, we can say today that we have been successful in \r\npreventing many of the scourges that have challenged \r\nhumanity, including world wars and widespread \r\ndisease. But as we rid our global society of those \r\ninjustices, new and emerging forms of injustices now \r\nthreaten our global security. \r\n I believe that climate change remains the greatest \r\nmoral challenge of our time. While it affects all nations \r\nof this planet, the irony is that it is the poorest and \r\nsmallest countries, which have made the least \r\ncontribution to greenhouse gas emissions, that are \r\npaying the ultimate price in order that the lifestyles and \r\ndevelopment agenda of some countries may be \r\nmaintained. Where is the justice in that? \r\n The Copenhagen Conference failed to meet the \r\nexpectations of many, but especially of those countries \r\non the front line for which the threat of climate change \r\nis no longer a matter of speculation but one of survival, \r\nand therefore of great urgency. There is a tendency in \r\nmuch of the world to view climate change as a distant \r\nand gradual process whose harmful effects are remote \r\npossible and not worthy of much attention. I have said \r\nin various forums that, for low-lying island countries \r\nlike Kiribati, Tuvalu, the Maldives and the Marshall \r\nIslands, among other similarly vulnerable countries, \r\nclimate change is a matter of survival and of increasing \r\nurgency. \r\n Already we are witnessing major damage to \r\ninfrastructure and property as a consequence of higher-\r\nthan-normal tides and storm surges. Coastal erosion in \r\nheavily populated areas is occurring at a rate that \r\nexceeds the Governments’ capacity to respond. Lack of \r\nresources is exacerbating the situation. Coastlines \r\ncontinue to be eroded and homes and properties \r\ncontinue to be damaged. \r\n Long before our islands are inundated by the \r\nrising seas, they will become uninhabitable as \r\nfreshwater aquifers are contaminated by saltwater \r\nintrusion from rising tides. Increasing demand for \r\nresources to undertake effective responses to climate \r\nchange impacts will become a dominant feature of our \r\ndevelopment agenda. I truly hope, therefore, that I can \r\nduring this session communicate the deep sense of \r\nurgency and growing sense of despair besetting our \r\npeople in the face of this oncoming catastrophe. \r\n On the basis of current scientific projections, the \r\nCopenhagen Accord does not provide the means to \r\nguarantee our future survival, and therefore we did not \r\nsign it in Copenhagen. We have subsequently \r\nassociated ourselves with the Accord, essentially for \r\nthe following reasons. First, we are of the belief that \r\nthe Accord at least represents a positive step towards \r\n A/65/PV.17\r\n \r\n7 10-55109 \r\n \r\nan international governance system on climate change. \r\nSecondly, we have the expectation that further, \r\nforthcoming scientific evidence will unequivocally \r\ndetermine the targets to be agreed upon. Finally and \r\nmost importantly, we believe that our support for the \r\nAccord will ensure the flow of urgently needed \r\nadaptation funds. I regret to say that, to date, we have \r\nnot been able to access any of the fast-start funds \r\npledged. \r\n I acknowledge that many elements of any \r\ninternational regime on climate change will take \r\nseveral years to conclude, but I also believe that there \r\nis common ground on which there is no real debate. \r\nThe urgent need for the flow of adaptation funds to \r\naddress the more urgent adaptation needs of the most \r\nvulnerable countries is a matter over which there is \r\ngeneral consensus. It is not a matter to negotiate or \r\nprocrastinate over; if we do, it will be too late for some \r\ncountries and any subsequent agreement will be \r\nmeaningless. It is also important that adaptation funds \r\nnot be regarded as additional development funds by \r\neither development partners or recipient countries, but \r\nbe provided and applied for the sole purpose of \r\nadaptation to climate change. \r\n I believe that we need to modify our approach to \r\nMexico if we are to succeed. I believe that we have a \r\nmoral obligation to reach agreement on a legally \r\nbinding framework that regulates our ability to pursue \r\npolicies that harm others. For very obvious reasons, I \r\ndo not believe that any country should have the right to \r\nexercise sovereignty over its greenhouse gas emissions. \r\nIn my view, any alternative to a legally binding \r\nframework is simply unacceptable and would have \r\npotentially destabilizing consequences. \r\n The experience at Copenhagen taught us that if \r\nwe are to make any progress, we must acknowledge \r\nour differences and discuss ways around them rather \r\nthan allow them to dominate the international agenda \r\nbehind the process. In this regard, we believe that trust \r\nand mutual respect are indispensable to the process. \r\n Climate change offers the international \r\ncommunity an opportunity to reflect upon the future \r\ndirection of our relations as sovereign nations. I \r\nbelieve that the climate change challenge provides us \r\nwith the opportunity to be more innovative in our \r\nconcept of international governance. Our current \r\narrangement is similar to that of State Governments not \r\naccepting federal authority within a federal system. \r\nOne can imagine the chaos. \r\n While other countries are focusing their efforts \r\nand resources on their sustainable development, we, \r\nthe most vulnerable countries, continue to spend the \r\nlimited resources we have on fighting the continuous \r\nonslaught of the rising seas and storm surges on our \r\nhomes and livelihoods. It is no surprise therefore that \r\nwe are off-track to achieve most of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and the implementation of our \r\nsustainable development agenda under our national \r\ndevelopment plan, the Pacific Plan and the Mauritius \r\nStrategy. For every step we take forward, we are \r\nknocked back two or three due to the challenges we \r\nface, which are exacerbated by climate change. \r\n In this regard, it is imperative that the pledges \r\nmade at Copenhagen for fast-start funds to assist \r\nvulnerable countries like Kiribati to adapt to the impact \r\nof climate change and sea-level rise be mobilized at the \r\nearliest possible opportunity. This is a matter of great \r\nand increasing urgency. \r\n We acknowledge the critical role of our \r\nenvironment as the pillar of sustainable development. \r\nMaintaining the health of our biodiversity within our \r\noceans and ecosystems faces the very same challenges \r\nthat we have so far failed to address in respect of our \r\natmosphere. It is imperative, therefore, that we \r\nundertake the commitment to put in place now the \r\nmeasures needed in order to avoid the mistakes we \r\nhave made with climate change. In pursuit of this, we \r\nin Kiribati have designated the largest marine protected \r\narea and marine World Heritage Site, the Phoenix \r\nIslands Protected Area. It covers an area of more than \r\n400,000 square kilometres, representing some 11 per \r\ncent of our exclusive economic zone. The Protected \r\nArea is the result of a collaborative partnership with \r\nConservation International and the New England \r\nAquarium. It provides a natural breeding ground for \r\ntropical fisheries and ocean ecosystems. It is a natural \r\nlaboratory for the study of such ecosystems and the \r\nimpact of climate change in a pristine area virtually \r\nuntouched by human activity. \r\n The preservation of that Area is our gift to \r\nhumanity and our contribution to international \r\nbiodiversity conservation efforts to significantly reduce \r\nbiodiversity loss in this International Year of \r\nBiodiversity. Even now, as we confront the possibility \r\nthat our islands will become uninhabitable within the \r\nA/65/PV.17  \r\n \r\n10-55109 8 \r\n \r\ncentury due to the rising sea level, we recognize the \r\nvalue of protecting something that is the common \r\nheritage of humanity. \r\n Kiribati and the Pacific are committed to the \r\nsustainable conservation and management of their \r\nocean ecosystem through the Micronesia Challenge, \r\nthe Coral Triangle Initiative, the Nauru Agreement and \r\nthe many other national efforts throughout the region \r\nto conserve biodiversity and ecosystems. At its meeting \r\nlast month in Vanuatu, the Pacific Islands Forum \r\nendorsed the Pacific Oceanscape Framework, which \r\npromotes collaboration and cooperation among marine \r\nprotected areas in the Pacific region. Initiatives such as \r\nthe Pacific 2020 Challenge and a novel Pangaea World \r\nconcept of green development through knowledge \r\neconomies link those initiatives to the countries of the \r\nPacific Rim and beyond. \r\n Our message to the international community is \r\nthat the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystems in \r\nthe Pacific is not important only to the sustainable \r\ndevelopment of Pacific peoples. It is also of vital \r\nsignificance to the rest of the world. Support from the \r\ninternational community in protecting ecosystems in \r\nthe Pacific, and indeed elsewhere, should not be \r\nviewed as a handout, but as an investment for future \r\ngenerations of this planet. \r\n Last year, we all called for a new world order. We \r\nall acknowledged that our great Organization must \r\nevolve to reflect the realities of our time — a time in \r\nwhich new and emerging security threats and injustices \r\nsuch as climate change are challenging the credibility \r\nof our international system of governance; a time in \r\nwhich the future survival of some nations is seriously \r\nin question; a time when all those countries with the \r\nability to do so must contribute to the prevention of \r\nthat calamity or be forever judged in history. \r\n We note that tensions remain high in certain \r\nregions, notably in the Middle East and the Korean \r\npeninsula. For the sake of those of us on the front line \r\nof the major global challenges, let us pray that great \r\nunderstanding and stability will prevail. For while we, \r\nas small nations, may seem not to be affected by such \r\nevents, they serve to distract the focus of attention \r\naway from the real challenges facing the international \r\ncommunity and our planet today. \r\n It is gratifying to note the easing of tensions and \r\nimprovement of relations across the Taiwan Straits — \r\nno doubt, a most welcome development for all in that \r\nregion. We also welcome the inclusion of Taiwan in the \r\nWorld Health Assembly, and we hope that similar \r\nunderstanding will prevail in respect of other \r\ninternational institutions in which Taiwan can \r\nparticipate and contribute meaningfully for the good of \r\nhumanity. \r\n As we chart the path towards a new world order, \r\nwe must address the fundamental threats to the very \r\nexistence of the units that make up our Organization. \r\nAs the so called community of nations, we must be \r\nable to guarantee the survival of members of our \r\ncommunity by addressing this defining challenge of \r\nour era. Climate change must be addressed before it is \r\ntoo late for those nations on the front line and for the \r\nwhole of humanity. \r\n At this time, we need compassionate, visionary \r\nand responsible leadership to direct our path towards a \r\nmore secure and more just world. We need to share the \r\nsolution, and we need to act as one in Mexico. We owe \r\nit to our future generations to act, and to act now. \r\nMaintaining the status quo is simply not an option. \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Republic of Kiribati for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n  Mr. Anote Tong, President, Head of Government \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of \r\nKiribati, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Gervais Rufyikiri, Second Vice-\r\nPresident of the Republic of Burundi \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the Second Vice-President \r\nof the Republic of Burundi. \r\n  Mr. Gervais Rufyikiri, Second Vice-President of \r\nthe Republic of Burundi, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum. \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): I have great \r\npleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Gervais \r\nRufyikiri, Second Vice-President of the Republic of \r\nBurundi, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n A/65/PV.17\r\n \r\n9 10-55109 \r\n \r\n Mr. Rufyikiri (Burundi) (spoke in French): \r\nAllow me first of all to convey to the Assembly the \r\nwarm and fraternal greetings of His Excellency \r\nMr. Pierre Nkurunziza, who has just been re-elected for \r\na second term of five years. He had planned to take \r\npart in these meetings himself, but the Unity \r\nInternational Foundation insisted on awarding him the \r\nRising Star of Africa prize for his role in building and \r\npromoting peace, and that led him to delegate attending \r\nthe High-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and the general debate of the \r\nAssembly’s sixty-fifth session to me. \r\n We wish to congratulate the President of the \r\nAssembly at its sixty-fifth session and to reiterate the \r\nthanks of the Burundi delegation to his predecessor for \r\nhis remarkable work. We also pay due tribute to our \r\nSecretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \r\nfor his involvement in the follow-up to Assembly \r\nresolutions and for the important guidance that he \r\ncontinues to give our Organization. His visit to \r\nBurundi on 9 June 2010 is a clear sign of his \r\ncommitment to peacebuilding and to strengthening the \r\ndemocracy regained in our country at great cost. \r\n Burundi is participating in the sixty-fifth session \r\nfollowing the top-to-bottom renewal of national \r\ninstitutions. For the first time in Burundi’s history, the \r\ndemocratically elected institutions have completed \r\ntheir term of office. That powerfully demonstrates the \r\npolitical maturity and resolve of the people of Burundi \r\nto break with the turbulent past in order to invest in the \r\npeace, stability and reconciliation that are prerequisites \r\nto sustainable development. \r\n We take this opportunity to reiterate the thanks of \r\nthe Government and people of Burundi for the role of \r\nthe international community, the United Nations, the \r\nEuropean Union, the African Union, the European \r\nParliament, the East African Community, the ACP-EU \r\nJoint Parliamentary Assembly, the Common Market for \r\nEastern and Southern Africa, the Economic \r\nCommunity of Central African States, friendly \r\ncountries and various organizations in participating in \r\nthe funding and observation of the aforementioned \r\nelections, which were peaceful, transparent and fair \r\nand in accordance with international standards. \r\n For its part, the party that won the elections is \r\naware of the absolute need to promote national \r\nreconciliation and political tolerance as much as it can. \r\nFrom the day after the first round of the election and \r\nthen in his inaugural speech, the President of the \r\nRepublic himself expressed his resolve and that of the \r\nwinning party to govern Burundi for and with all the \r\npeople of Burundi. Furthermore, Burundi’s \r\nConstitution also provides for political inclusion \r\nmechanisms in managing the State’s affairs. \r\n During the new Parliament, the Government of \r\nBurundi is committed to following its peacebuilding \r\nprogramme and strengthening security for all, in \r\nparticular by completing disarmament of the civilian \r\npopulation and the socio-economic reinsertion of \r\ndemobilized individuals and returnees. Furthermore, \r\nthe Government of Burundi will particularly emphasize \r\nregional cooperation and integration, as well as \r\nenhancing security in its geographical area, together \r\nwith neighbouring countries. \r\n  Ms. Lucas (Luxembourg), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n \r\n Promoting good governance in its various \r\ndimensions is also one of the main concerns of \r\nBurundi’s Government. With regard to political \r\ngovernance, it will continue to promote the rights of \r\npolitical parties, including by strengthening the spirit \r\nof dialogue between political partners. \r\n With respect to economic governance, there will \r\nbe efforts to improve business conditions to encourage \r\nboth national and foreign investment. The Government \r\nof Burundi reaffirms its determination and zero-\r\ntolerance commitment to combat financial corruption \r\nand fraud. \r\n In the area of the judiciary, every possible effort \r\nwill be made to combat impunity with respect to any \r\ntype of crime, and transitional justice will be promoted \r\nduring this Parliament. \r\n Concerning socio-economic development, the \r\nGovernment of Burundi will focus every effort possible \r\non combating poverty, in particular through \r\ndevelopment of priority production sectors, namely, \r\nagriculture and livestock, energy, social infrastructure, \r\ntourism, environmental renewal and new information \r\nand communication technologies. We will give special \r\nattention to developing public-private partnerships with \r\na view to sustained economic growth. \r\n In the social domain, the Government of Burundi \r\nwill concentrate on the education and health sectors to \r\ncombat ignorance and disease. To meet crucial needs in \r\nthose areas, many schools and clinics will be built \r\nA/65/PV.17  \r\n \r\n10-55109 10 \r\n \r\nthroughout the country. Furthermore, the services in \r\nthese two sectors will also be improved. \r\n Relaunching and promoting the Burundian \r\neconomy depends also on consolidating regional \r\ngroups and developing projects and programmes that \r\nintegrate common interests. In that framework, the \r\nGovernment of Burundi will play a larger role in the \r\npromotion of regional organizations of which it is a \r\nmember, such as the Economic Community of the \r\nGreat Lake Countries, the International Conference on \r\nthe Great Lakes Region, whose Executive Secretariat \r\nwe host, the East African Community, the Common \r\nMarket for Eastern and Southern Africa, and others. \r\nThat ambitious programme requires consistent support \r\nfor its implementation. Thus Burundi clearly requires \r\nvarious forms of support. \r\n To that end, we take the opportunity of this forum \r\nto make a strong appeal to the international \r\ncommunity, to the United Nations system and to the \r\ncountries represented here and to charitable \r\norganizations to continue their tireless support to the \r\nGovernment of Burundi with the ultimate aim of \r\nallowing it to lay the foundations for long-term \r\ndevelopment and for solidifying the achievements \r\nmade in terms of peace, democracy, stability and \r\nreconciliation. \r\n In the context of international relations and \r\nrelations between States, Burundi is convinced that the \r\nissue of global governance in general and economic \r\ngovernance in particular remains a major concern of \r\nmost of our countries. Thus promotion of equity must \r\nbecome the leitmotif and the warhorse of the \r\norganizations of which our respective States are full \r\nmembers. \r\n Burundi desires additional efforts to allow \r\ndeveloping countries sufficient representation in the \r\ninternational financial institutions such as the World \r\nBank, the International Monetary Fund and others. We \r\nbelieve that is the way to promote a fairer and more \r\ngeographically balanced world. \r\n Burundi is committed to the African Union’s \r\nposition on Security Council reform, in particular that \r\nthe African continent should have two permanent seats \r\nwith all of the privileges held by the five permanent \r\nmembers. \r\n Today the entire world is confronting a number of \r\nchallenges and natural disasters, some of which are \r\nlinked to climate change. Developing countries in \r\ngeneral and African countries in particular are the most \r\nharshly affected, because of a lack of resources to deal \r\nwith such challenges. \r\n It is high time that countries agree to take more \r\naudacious measures in order to provide the financing \r\nnecessary to combat the negative effects of climate \r\nchange, by stimulating and promoting in particular \r\ntechnology transfer and without forgetting capacity-\r\nbuilding in the poorest and thus the most vulnerable \r\ncountries. By effectively combating the effects of \r\nclimate change, our countries will inevitably resolve in \r\npart the problem of food insecurity, which is also a \r\nsignificant threat to sustainable development. \r\n In that light, we call upon the wealthy countries \r\nto act in favour of developing countries, particularly \r\npost-conflict countries such as Burundi, through \r\nmultiple, ongoing and significant support to key social \r\nand economic sectors. It is urgent that all development \r\npartners respect the promises they have made to \r\ndeveloping countries in general and those countries in \r\nAfrica in particular by increasing official development \r\nassistance. \r\n Burundi — whose stability has benefited from the \r\nexcellent attention and considerable support of United \r\nNations entities, the international community and \r\nfriendly countries — remains very concerned by the \r\nissue of the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity. It reaffirms its commitment to cooperate with \r\nthe United Nations in consolidating the achievements \r\nmade with regard to peace and stability and in handling \r\nthe finances necessary for its socio-economic \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Furthermore, in terms of international solidarity, \r\nall countries must combine efforts to make this world a \r\nharbour of peace. For that reason, Burundi is taking an \r\nactive part in the United Nations Operation in Côte \r\nd’Ivoire to bring peace to that country, the United \r\nNations Mission in the Central African Republic and \r\nChad, the African Union-United Nations Hybrid \r\nOperation in Darfur and the African Union Mission in \r\nSomalia (AMISOM). \r\n With respect to Somalia, Burundi is committed on \r\nthe ground despite the many problems its troops are \r\nencountering. We reiterate our request to the United \r\nNations with regard to improving the living and \r\nworking conditions of the AMISOM forces. We take \r\nthis opportunity to recall the promises made in that \r\n A/65/PV.17\r\n \r\n11 10-55109 \r\n \r\nregard by the Secretary-General when he visited \r\nBurundi on 9 June. We also call on other countries to \r\ndeploy additional troops so that AMISOM can become \r\na truly continental mission able to fulfil its mandate. \r\n In closing, Burundi welcomes the determination \r\nand commitment of the United Nations to make our \r\nworld one of peace, democracy, tolerance and \r\ndevelopment, where individual and collective rights \r\nand freedoms are clearly protected. Therefore, we \r\nencourage everyone to go forward towards that noble \r\nmission. Our wish is that the next session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly may take place in a context where \r\nmost of the conflicts currently threatening some \r\ncountries and the world as a whole will have been \r\nresolved. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nSecond Vice-President of Burundi for the statement he \r\nhas just made. \r\n  Mr. Gervais Rufyikiri, Second Vice-President of \r\nthe Republic of Burundi, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Alik L. Alik, Vice-President of \r\nthe Federated States of Micronesia \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Vice-\r\nPresident of the Federated States of Micronesia. \r\n  Mr. Alik L. Alik, Vice-President of the Federated \r\nStates of Micronesia, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Alik \r\nL. Alik, Vice-President of the Federated States of \r\nMicronesia, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Mr. Alik (Federated States of Micronesia): Allow \r\nme to congratulate Mr. Deiss on his election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth \r\nsession. He has taken on that formidable task at a \r\ncrucial period for our United Nations. I assure him of \r\nMicronesia’s full support. I would also like to pay \r\ntribute to his esteemed predecessor for his \r\ndistinguished leadership. \r\n Sadly, I wish to begin my statement by \r\nexpressing the sincere sympathy of the people and \r\nGovernment of the Federated States of Micronesia for \r\nthe many victims of recent natural disasters \r\neverywhere. Having been victims of natural disasters \r\nourselves, our hearts go out to the victims of the recent \r\nhurricanes, earthquakes, mudslides and floods that are \r\nnow occurring on an unprecedented scale and with \r\nincreasing frequency and devastating intensity all over \r\nour planet. Overwhelming evidence points to one \r\ncommon denominator in all those events, and that is \r\nglobal climate change. \r\n I am deeply honoured to address the General \r\nAssembly, at its sixty-fifth session, for the first time on \r\nbehalf of the Federated States of Micronesia. This \r\nAssembly accords Micronesia and the small island \r\ndeveloping States an extraordinary privilege to bring to \r\nthe whole world the most pressing issues affecting us \r\nthat demand our collective response. \r\n Despite the many years of negotiations to curb its \r\ndevastating effects, the climate change crisis continues \r\nto haunt us. The negotiating process has moved along \r\nvery slowly, while in stark contrast the rapid increases \r\nin the incidence and severity of environmental hazards \r\ncontinue to take their toll, with devastating results. I \r\ncannot help but think of the needless human suffering \r\neverywhere, and what the future holds for my country \r\nand the small island developing States if business \r\ncontinues as usual. \r\n As a small island developing State, Micronesia’s \r\nfuture is intrinsically linked to the global climate. That \r\nis why we are gravely concerned by the acute \r\nenvironmental problems related to the extreme \r\nvulnerability of our islands to sea-level rise and \r\nclimate change. Those threats are indisputable, and \r\ndelays in adopting a comprehensive and legally \r\nbinding agreement to avert this global disaster are \r\nwithout excuse. \r\n In Micronesia, we are deeply disappointed at the \r\nglacial progress in the negotiating sessions and climate \r\nchange meetings of the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change. At the same time, we \r\nare growing increasingly alarmed by the prospect of \r\nshrinking ambitions for the meeting in Cancún, \r\nMexico, later this year. That is not an acceptable \r\nresponse to a crisis of enormous proportions, certainly \r\nnot for Micronesia and not for any of the small island \r\ndeveloping States, who need fast action. This is an \r\nissue of survival for us. \r\n We must find a better response — a genuine \r\nresponse that supports mitigation and adaptation \r\nmeasures that will achieve significant reductions in \r\nA/65/PV.17  \r\n \r\n10-55109 12 \r\n \r\ngreenhouse gas emissions and thus preserve the \r\nintegrity of our Earth’s environment and also the \r\nlivelihoods of its inhabitants. My island nation and the \r\nsmall island developing States, for that matter, are not \r\nmajor contributors to the causes of climate change. All \r\npresent know that. But we are nevertheless determined \r\nin our efforts to contribute to finding solutions. \r\n For its part, Micronesia continues to take the lead \r\nto combat climate change by utilizing the opportunities \r\nunder the Montreal Protocol on Substances that \r\nDeplete the Ozone Layer. Through the Montreal \r\nProtocol we can solve a big part of the climate change \r\nproblem. That is why Micronesia has developed a \r\nproposal with the support of Mauritius, the Marshall \r\nIslands, Seychelles and the Philippines that calls for \r\nthe phasing down of the production and use of \r\nhydrofluorocarbons. Under our proposal we will be \r\nable to eliminate one of the greenhouse gases listed \r\nunder the Kyoto Protocol, and we are encouraged that \r\nother countries, such as Canada, the United States and \r\nMexico, already have come forward with similar \r\nproposals. \r\n Frankly, we have been delighted by the interest \r\nshown in our proposal so far, and I commend it to the \r\nAssembly’s attention. Today, I encourage all \r\ndelegations to consider supporting it. Our collective \r\naction is imperative if we are to effectively curb and \r\nreverse global warming. That is the kind of \r\ncollaboration that I encourage here. \r\n Just as we are delighted by our Montreal Protocol \r\nproposal, we are equally proud of an initiative within \r\nour Pacific region, launched in August by the \r\nGovernments of the Republics of the Marshall Islands \r\nand Palau and my own Government at the margins of \r\nthe forty-first Pacific Islands Forum meeting in \r\nVanuatu. This is the Green Energy Micronesia \r\nInitiative, which calls for a 20 per cent improvement in \r\nenergy efficiency by suppliers in areas such as \r\ntransportation and electric power generation, a 30 per \r\ncent improvement in energy use by end users and a \r\n20 per cent electricity generation through renewable \r\nenergy by 2020. As island countries with a total \r\ndependence on fossil fuels for our energy generation, it \r\nis no longer economically, financially and \r\nenvironmentally sustainable to continue down that \r\npath. We must look towards developing, utilizing and \r\nembracing our renewable sources of energy. \r\n Our prospect for success will remain grim with \r\nour limited capacity and available financial resources. \r\nWe encourage and call upon our development partners \r\nand the international community to support our efforts, \r\nincluding through increased financial support, transfer \r\nof technology and capacity-building. \r\n In our seemingly idyllic settings as island \r\nnations, it may seem to many around the world that we \r\nlive an easy life and demand action only from others. \r\nHowever, the reality is that our island nations are \r\nactively playing our part in maintaining, and promoting \r\nthe protection of, our Planet Earth. We accept our \r\nresponsibility for conserving the biodiversity of our \r\nislands and waters and for using resources in a \r\nsustainable manner. \r\n That is why Micronesia and our Micronesian \r\nsister nations the Republics of the Marshall Islands and \r\nof Palau, as well as the Territory of Guam and the \r\nCommonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, \r\ncontinue to promote the Micronesia Challenge to \r\nconserve at least 30 per cent of the near-shore marine \r\nresources and 20 per cent of terrestrial resources across \r\nour Micronesian region by 2020. \r\n Given our individual limitations, we can confront \r\nthese challenges only through regional collective \r\nactions. I want to express our utmost gratitude to those \r\ncountries and international organizations that continue \r\nto support the Micronesia Challenge and help us \r\nachieve our goals. Being small island countries with \r\nlimited resources, we see realistic success in \r\ncollaborative partnership with the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n Micronesia will continue to address the \r\nprotection of the ocean and its resources. As a Pacific \r\nisland country with one of the largest exclusive \r\neconomic zones in the Western and Central Pacific \r\nOcean, we ascribe particular importance to the ocean \r\nand its resources. The ocean has a fundamental and \r\ncritical bearing on our food security and economic \r\nfuture. However, human activities on the planet are \r\nsignificantly affecting our ocean and can bring about \r\ndisastrous consequences for our food security and \r\nsustainable development. \r\n Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in our \r\nzone remains of great concern, as that abhorrent \r\npractice continues with its sophistication and \r\nmultinational criminal operations. We do maintain high \r\nexpectations that through the support of the \r\n A/65/PV.17\r\n \r\n13 10-55109 \r\n \r\ninternational community we can combat that illegal \r\nactivity, which threatens the sustainability of our fish \r\nstocks and deprives our people of potential economic \r\nbenefits. \r\n To reverse already discernable trends towards the \r\ndisappearance of key tuna species that were once \r\nthought inexhaustible, early this year the leaders of the \r\nPacific countries that are parties to the Nauru \r\nAgreement signed the Koror Declaration, agreeing to \r\nintroduce further conservation measures to protect key \r\ntuna stocks. One of the measures agreed to is to close \r\noff additional high-seas areas to purse seine fishing by \r\nvessels licensed to fish our Nauru Agreement waters. \r\n Micronesia is fully committed and will work with \r\nits fellow parties to the Nauru Agreement and the wider \r\ninternational community to ensure the sustainability of \r\nour tuna resources. We will hold violators accountable \r\nthrough internationally agreed mechanisms to prevent, \r\ndeter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated \r\nfishing in our waters and the Western and Central \r\nPacific Ocean region. \r\n Our oceans and our exclusive economic zones are \r\ngetting a great deal of international attention because \r\nof the potential for economic exploitation. We assign \r\nthe highest priority to greater economic participation in \r\nall aspects of that exploitation. Increased economic \r\nparticipation is a major goal for all countries in the \r\nPacific having considerable marine resources — not \r\njust Micronesia. \r\n However, our participation in the exploitation of \r\nour own marine resources for economic development is \r\nheld back by a lack of experience and because much of \r\nour basic infrastructure still needs to be supported and \r\ndeveloped. On the overall scoreboard, the Pacific small \r\nisland developing States have not claimed their rightful \r\nshare of their own fisheries resources. International \r\nsupport has to be given to help us build our capacities \r\nnot only in negotiating agreements and developing our \r\nfisheries industries but in realizing a greater share of \r\nthe benefits from the catch of fish stocks from our own \r\nexclusive economic zone. \r\n In this review year for both the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and the Mauritius Strategy for \r\nSmall Island Developing States, we must take full \r\nadvantage of both occasions and rise to the challenge \r\nto meet our world’s new and emerging needs. \r\n One of the major preoccupations of the General \r\nAssembly over the last 15 years has been the reform of \r\nthe United Nations. I do not need to belabour the issue, \r\nas all present are aware of Micronesia’s long-standing \r\nposition, especially in regard to the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council. For permanent membership, we \r\nreiterate our support for Japan and India from our Asia \r\nand Pacific region. From other regions, Germany and \r\nBrazil also deserve equal consideration. We call for \r\naccelerated efforts to bring the negotiations to a \r\nsuccessful conclusion. \r\n Peace in the Middle East remains elusive, but we \r\nhave high hopes that the resumption of direct talks \r\nrecently in Washington, D.C., and elsewhere between \r\nthe Israelis and the Palestinians will pave the way to a \r\nlasting peace and a final settlement with a two-State \r\nsolution. The whole world has a stake in the Middle \r\nEast peace process. Micronesia fully supports the peace \r\nprocess and urges all members of this Assembly to play \r\na constructive role and work towards an outcome that \r\nbrings permanent peace and security to the Middle \r\nEast. I want to express my profound gratitude to the \r\nUnited States, Egypt, Jordan and the Quartet for their \r\ncritical roles and leadership in finding a solution to this \r\nformidable challenge. For it to be met, we must \r\nrespond with our collective action and support. \r\n I have been most privileged to have this \r\nopportunity to address the Assembly on behalf of my \r\nsmall island country. As I close my statement, I want to \r\nreassure this Assembly that Micronesia will continue to \r\ndo its part as a responsible Member of this \r\nOrganization. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly I wish to thank the \r\nVice-President of the Federated States of Micronesia \r\nfor the statement he has just made. \r\n  Mr. Alik L. Alik, Vice-President of the Federated \r\nStates of Micronesia, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Sheikh Hasina, Prime Minister  \r\nof the People’s Republic of Bangladesh \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh. \r\nA/65/PV.17  \r\n \r\n10-55109 14 \r\n \r\n  Sheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of the People’s \r\nRepublic of Bangladesh, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum. \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming Her Excellency Sheikh \r\nHasina, Prime Minister of the People’s Republic of \r\nBangladesh, and inviting her to address the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Sheikh Hasina (Bangladesh) (spoke in Bangla; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): I warmly \r\ncongratulate Mr. Deiss on his well-deserved election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth \r\nsession. I believe his wise and experienced leadership \r\nwill bring great success to the Assembly’s proceedings. \r\nI also congratulate Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki for his \r\nlaudable contribution as Assembly President in its \r\nsixty-fourth session. I also thank Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon for his tireless service to the United \r\nNations and to world peace. \r\n Bangladesh is a secular, progressive nation \r\nfulfilling the promise of democracy, good governance, \r\nhuman rights and the rule of law that were made by my \r\nfather — the Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu \r\nSheikh Mujibur Rahman, the greatest Bengali of all \r\ntimes — from this podium 36 years ago (see \r\nA/PV.2243). That has also been in consonance with the \r\nobjectives of the United Nations, which remains the \r\nlast abode where the hopes and aspirations of the \r\nhapless people of the world can be fulfilled. \r\n Bangladesh has also been supporting United \r\nNations efforts to establish democracy, human rights, \r\npeace and security, as well as taking effective steps to \r\ncombat terrorism and external threats worldwide. I, \r\ntoo, am committed to ensuring this continuity. \r\n Bangladesh has established an international \r\ncrimes tribunal to try persons responsible for war \r\ncrimes and crimes against humanity, including \r\ngenocide, arson and rape, committed during our war of \r\nliberation in 1971 and immediately thereafter. That \r\naction is in accord with the rule of law as reflected in \r\nthe Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, \r\nwhich we have ratified and which is aimed at bringing \r\nperpetrators of war crimes, genocide and crimes \r\nagainst humanity to justice. I believe that only justice \r\ncan heal the unforgivable, deadly wrongs of the past. \r\n Here, I sadly recall the evil act of terror on \r\n15 August 1975 that took the life of my father and the \r\nFather of the Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur \r\nRahman, and 18 members of my family, including my \r\nmother, sisters-in-law and my three brothers, one of \r\nwhom was only 10 years old. Even I have been a target \r\nof a series of assassination attempts ever since my \r\nreturn home from exile in 1981. \r\n The most horrendous period was when our \r\nsecular democratic party, the Awami League, was in \r\nopposition, from 2001 to 2006. At that time thousands \r\nof our party workers, supporters and followers of the \r\nreligious minority who voted for our secular party were \r\nmercilessly killed in systematic terrorist acts of the \r\nBNP/Jamaat-e-Islami alliance Government. The most \r\naudacious act was the dastardly open grenade attack on \r\n21 August 2004 directed against me at a public rally \r\nbeing held to protest those terrorist attacks and killings. \r\nBy the time a dozen grenades had taken their toll, \r\n24 innocent people, including our party’s Secretary for \r\nWomen’s Affairs, Mrs. Ivy Rahman — the wife of our \r\ncurrent President — lay dead, and over 500 people \r\nwere seriously injured. \r\n There have also been attempts on members of my \r\nfamily, but never have we bowed before the forces of \r\nterror. As victims of repeated terrorist attacks, my \r\nfamily and I know this menace well. Clearly, our \r\nrejection of terrorism is total, as is our determination to \r\neliminate it in all its forms. I want to unequivocally \r\nstate that terrorism will not be allowed on the soil of \r\nBangladesh, and that is precisely why we are a party to \r\nall terrorism-related United Nations conventions and \r\naccord them our full support. \r\n Our firm policy against terrorism and our love for \r\npeace led me to negotiate the 1997 Chittagong Hill \r\nTracts Peace Accord, thus ending decades of internal \r\nconflict, and a peaceful resolution of the violent \r\nuprising of our paramilitary border forces in 2009. In \r\nthe international sphere, our commitment to peace, \r\nwhich is essential for development, is reflected in our \r\nunflinching support for United Nations peacekeeping \r\nmissions. Since 1988 Bangladesh has sent 97,000 \r\ntroops to 24 countries as part of 32 such missions. In \r\nthat period we have lost the precious lives of 92 valiant \r\nsoldiers. \r\n Our present troop contribution has made \r\nBangladesh number one among countries contributing \r\ntroops to United Nations peacekeeping operations. \r\nSadly, despite that involvement, our presence in the \r\nDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) \r\n A/65/PV.17\r\n \r\n15 10-55109 \r\n \r\nremains negligible, as is our voice in planning \r\nstrategies of peacekeeping missions. In all fairness, we \r\nshould have proportionate representation in DPKO. \r\n Bangladesh has been adversely affected by global \r\nwarming, food insecurity, population displacement and \r\ndiminished biodiversity, among other problems, and is \r\nfaced with serious threats caused by climate change \r\nand global warming. Although our share of carbon gas \r\nemissions is negligible, we are their worst victim. The \r\nincreasing frequency and ferocity of floods, cyclones, \r\ndroughts and other natural disasters caused by that \r\nphenomenon continue to create havoc through the lives \r\nlost and the resources destroyed. \r\n Consequently, attaining the Millennium Development \r\nGoals is becoming a more difficult challenge. Climate \r\nmigrants are already overcrowding our cities, putting \r\ngreat stress on our limited infrastructure facilities and \r\ncausing social disorder. The situation could become \r\ncatastrophic with a one-metre rise in the sea level due \r\nto global warming. That would inundate one quarter of \r\nBangladesh, impacting 11 per cent of our population \r\nand leading to mass migration. \r\n To meet those challenges, we have adopted a \r\n134-point adaptation and mitigation action plan. Those \r\npoints include dredging major rivers to restrict \r\nflooding, recovering cultivable lands for settling \r\ndisplaced people and increasing capacity to produce \r\nmore grain foods. Other plans include afforesting \r\n20 per cent of the land area by 2015, creating a huge \r\ncarbon sink; protecting biodiversity; strengthening \r\ncoasts and river banks with green belts; modernizing \r\ndisaster management with community participation; \r\ndeveloping crop varieties attuned to climate change; \r\nchanging agricultural practices; using clean coal \r\ntechnology; and adopting nuclear power and renewable \r\nenergy. Meanwhile, over 14,000 shelters for cyclone \r\nvictims have been strategically located to cope with \r\ncyclonic disasters. \r\n Implementing the action plan requires enormous \r\nfunds. An immediate measure has been the \r\nestablishment of a Climate Change Trust Fund with our \r\nown resources, and a Climate Change Resilience Fund \r\nwith assistance from development partners. At the \r\ninternational level, at the fifteenth Climate Change \r\nConference of Parties — COP 15 — last year, we \r\nworked hard for a legally binding agreement and for an \r\ninternational climate fund to assist countries most \r\nvulnerable to climate change. The compromise was the \r\nCopenhagen Accord, which has so far failed to deliver \r\nits promises. \r\n Therefore, I urge the world leaders at the \r\nsixteenth Conference — COP 16 — this year to \r\nconclude, in their wisdom, a positive agreement based \r\non the Bali Plan of Action, with agreed cuts in \r\ngreenhouse gas emissions and real contributions to the \r\ninternational climate fund. I also urge them to adopt, at \r\nCOP 16, measures to ameliorate the adverse impacts of \r\nclimate change on the most vulnerable countries, like \r\nBangladesh, small island developing States like the \r\nMaldives, and landlocked countries like Bhutan and \r\nNepal, among other least developed countries (LDCs). \r\n The world is yet to recover from the world \r\neconomic crisis, and LDCs as well as developed \r\ncountries are suffering from reduced exports. Those \r\ncrises are due to inequity and injustice resulting from \r\nan unfair international structure, which remains mostly \r\nunchanged. The Bretton Woods institutions must now \r\naccommodate a greater presence of developing \r\ncountries, especially least developed countries. While \r\nthe Bretton Woods institutions can deal with long-term \r\ndevelopment assistance, Bangladesh proposes the \r\nestablishment of a special fund under United Nations \r\nauspices to deal exclusively with Special Drawing \r\nRights and grants. We also propose that all \r\nstakeholders respect country-led ownership of all \r\ndevelopment projects, as enshrined in the Accra \r\nAgenda for Action. \r\n The least developed countries surely welcome the \r\ndevelopment assistance they receive from developed \r\ncountries. They would, however, benefit more through \r\nreceiving liberal trade concessions such as duty and \r\nquota-free market access, trade capacity-building, et \r\ncetera. Least developed countries also seek a speedy \r\nend to the World Trade Organization’s Doha Round of \r\nthe World Trade Organization trade negotiations and \r\nfulfilment of the commitments by the countries of the \r\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and \r\nDevelopment to provide 0.7 per cent of gross national \r\nincome to official development assistance, of which \r\n0.2 per cent will be directed at least developed \r\ncountries, as affirmed in the Brussels Programme of \r\nAction. \r\n The least developed countries have also been \r\naffected by unemployment at home and by obstacles to \r\nmigration for jobs abroad. Since remittances form a \r\nsignificant part of their gross domestic product, \r\nA/65/PV.17  \r\n \r\n10-55109 16 \r\n \r\neconomic recovery measures should assure \r\nemployment opportunities and all rights of migrant \r\nworkers, especially those from least developed \r\ncountries. \r\n However, amid the travails of the past years, \r\nBangladesh has fared reasonably well in maintaining \r\nan annual GDP growth rate of 6 per cent. That was \r\npossible due to our pragmatic policies on food \r\nproduction, agriculture, rural development, inflation \r\ncontrol and keeping food and essentials prices within \r\nreach of the poor. During our previous Government, \r\nfrom 1996 to 2001, our policies on food security made \r\nBangladesh self-sufficient in food, which led to our \r\nwinning the Food and Agriculture Organization of the \r\nUnited Nations Ceres Award. This time around, with \r\nthe implementation of the national food policy, aimed \r\nat stable prices of fuel, fertilizer, seeds and other farm \r\ninputs, our Government has succeeded again in \r\nensuring sustained food supply to all. \r\n Our Government’s aim is also to use information \r\nand communications technology (ICT) to accelerate \r\nour socio-economic development. Therefore, we are \r\nimplementing ICT Act 2009 and ICT Policy 2009 to \r\nbuild the requisite infrastructure and extend ICT to \r\nevery nook and corner of Bangladesh. Already, \r\neducational institutions, local government institutions \r\nand rural communities are being connected to Internet \r\nservices. The process includes an e-centre for rural \r\ncommunities, connecting 8,500 post offices; a high-\r\ntech park; a network of e governance; and efforts to \r\nstrengthen the telecommunication network and satellite \r\ncommunication. \r\n Our e-services are now focused on improving \r\nagricultural information delivery, market access, \r\neducation, health care, early warning systems for \r\ndisasters, law and order, and social safety net \r\npayments. Also being implemented is an aggressive \r\ne-leadership programme among members of \r\nParliament, top policymakers, field administrators and \r\nlocal administrators. We had already transformed \r\n100 Union Parishads to host e-centres in 2009, and we \r\nare now expediting the process to cover all 4,500 \r\nUnion Parishads by the end of this year. In short, our \r\nGovernment is determined to achieve a digital \r\nBangladesh and transform it into a middle-income \r\ncountry by 2021, the golden jubilee year of our \r\nnation’s independence. \r\n Simultaneously, our Government’s aim is to \r\nattain 100 per cent primary school enrolment by 2011 \r\nand 100 per cent literacy rate by 2014. Our highest \r\nbudget allocation goes to education. Tuition and books \r\nare now free for students up to grade 12. Computer and \r\nInternet facilities are being provided free of charge to \r\nschools in order to familiarize students with their use. \r\nTo encourage school attendance, we have started \r\nproviding lunch to students and cash incentives to \r\nparents. \r\n Though Bangladesh has achieved the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goal target of gender equality at the \r\nsecondary level, our plan is to provide free tuition to \r\ngirls up to the undergraduate level. This is because we \r\nfirmly believe that women’s equal involvement is vital \r\nfor a nation’s development. Gender equity and human \r\ndevelopment are our top priority concerns. \r\n Our Government has revived the national \r\nwomen’s development policy, adopted during our last \r\ntenure of office, that is, 1996 to 2001. At present, \r\nbesides the Prime Minister, the leader of the \r\nopposition, the deputy leader and a whip, there are five \r\nother women Cabinet ministers and 45 members of \r\nParliament in reserved seats. Moreover, 19 women \r\nmembers of Parliament have been directly elected. \r\nWomen also occupy 30 per cent of reserved seats in all \r\nlocal governments. They are encouraged to participate \r\nin politics and administration, and are recruited in all \r\nprofessions, including the armed services. They are \r\nalso serving in United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations. \r\n We have made arrangements to provide pensions \r\nto distressed and widowed women, as well as \r\nresidential accommodation for both men and women in \r\nold peoples’ homes. Our social safety nets also include \r\nprogrammes for minorities, the marginalized, the \r\ndisabled and the mentally challenged; ashrayan, or \r\nhomes for the homeless; the “one home, one farm” \r\npolicy to alleviate poverty; and cash and food transfer \r\nprogrammes. \r\n A new policy provides for the employment of one \r\nmember from every poor family. Another new initiative \r\nis the national services policy for providing youth and \r\nwomen with employment and skills development. \r\nMoreover, research opportunities have led to new \r\ndiscoveries, particularly with respect to climate-\r\nchange-resilient crops. A recent success is genome \r\nsequencing of the jute fibre, ensuring improved quality \r\n A/65/PV.17\r\n \r\n17 10-55109 \r\n \r\nof jute products, a biodegradable option to hazardous \r\nsynthetic products. \r\n Health is another area receiving special attention, \r\nwith the implementation of the national health policy \r\nadopted during our previous term of office. This policy \r\nprovides for the establishment of one community clinic \r\nfor every 6,000 people. Our plan is to locate 18,000 \r\nsuch clinics in the first phase, to extend basic health \r\nservices into people’s homes. For safe motherhood, a \r\nnational strategy for maternal health has been adopted, \r\nwith a programme to reduce the infant mortality rate to \r\n15 from the current 54 per 1,000 live births. \r\n Our target is to complete 100 per cent \r\nimmunization by the end of our present tenure of \r\nGovernment. Since my Government assumed office, \r\nthe maternal mortality rate has been reduced from 2.9 \r\nto 2.6 and infant mortality to such a significant extent \r\nthat our successes have been recognized with an award \r\nby the United Nations. \r\n Indeed, despite the recent world food, energy, \r\neconomic and climate change crises, Bangladesh, with \r\nthe support of United Nations agencies and bilateral \r\nand multilateral partners, has made satisfactory \r\nprogress. In fact, our achievement with respect to \r\nMDG 1, on poverty alleviation, MDG 2, on universal \r\nprimary education, and MDG 3, on gender equality and \r\nwomen’s empowerment, are encouraging and on track. \r\nOur Government, through its sincere efforts, intends to \r\nraise 12 million people out of poverty, which would \r\nhalve the number of people now living in that sad state \r\nby the MDG deadline of 2015. \r\n Our unflinching commitment to peace finds \r\nexpression in our annual flagship Assembly resolution \r\non the culture of peace (see resolution 64/80). Recent \r\nyears have shown an extraordinary record of \r\nsponsorships because of the reference to the \r\nInternational Mother Language Day. Ever since the \r\nDay was adopted by UNESCO in recognition of the \r\nlanguage martyrs who gave their lives in 1952 for \r\nBangla, their mother tongue, it has been celebrated \r\nthroughout the world with growing fervour every year. \r\nSince Bangla is spoken by nearly 300 million people \r\nworldwide and has a rich heritage in literature, history \r\nand other fields, our Parliament adopted a resolution \r\nrequesting the United Nations to declare Bangla as one \r\nof its official languages. I fervently appeal to Member \r\nStates for acceptance of our very legitimate request. \r\n Every passing day, the peoples of the world are \r\nbeing drawn closer together, as one village, with \r\nquickly developing technologies and new challenges \r\nsuch as climate change, terrorism and economic \r\ninterdependence. Indeed, our destiny is now one, as are \r\nour burdens and responsibilities. It is now obvious that \r\nonly by mobilizing and optimizing our synergies will it \r\nbe possible for us to create a world of shared peace and \r\nprosperity. We have no alternative but to discard our \r\nself-centred, short-sighted interests and work in unison \r\nfor a world that our children, and theirs, will inherit, so \r\nthat they will remember us with fondness and in \r\ngratitude. \r\n May Bangladesh live forever. Long live the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh \r\nfor the statement she has just made. \r\n  Sheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of the People’s \r\nRepublic of Bangladesh, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Franco Frattini, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Italy. \r\n Mr. Frattini (Italy): Italy is about to celebrate \r\nthe one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of its \r\nunification. We are a young country, but a people with \r\ndeep roots and ancient traditions. By our history, \r\ngeographic location and age-old international outlook, \r\nwe are proud of our illustrious legacy. By necessity and \r\nvocation, we are dedicated to dialogue, respect for \r\ndiversity and mutual understanding. \r\n There is no alternative to this inclusive approach, \r\neven when it requires compromises or concessions. I \r\nprefer to call it idealistic pragmatism, since our \r\nultimate goal is to spread peace, freedom and \r\nprosperity, an ambition that is best achieved through \r\ncooperation. This propensity for dialogue is one of \r\nItaly’s greatest contributions to the United Nations. \r\n Italy is a strong supporter of the central role of \r\nthe United Nations in global governance and in the \r\nmanagement of international crises. By virtue of its \r\nuniversality and impartiality, the Organization has the \r\nlegitimacy to intervene in crisis situations. Italy \r\nparticipates in peacekeeping missions not only by \r\ncontributing large numbers of highly qualified troops, \r\nA/65/PV.17  \r\n \r\n10-55109 18 \r\n \r\nbut also by drafting strategic plans and protocol, and \r\nby providing training and logistic support. We are the \r\nsixth largest contributor to the United Nations regular \r\nand peacekeeping operations budgets and, since 2006, \r\nthe top troop contributor to the United Nations among \r\nthe members of the European Union (EU) and Group \r\nof Western European and Other States. \r\n Approximately 8,000 Italian troops are assigned \r\nto operations under the aegis or the mandate of the \r\nUnited Nations. Our presence is spread across \r\n22 missions throughout the world: from Lebanon to \r\nHaiti, the Balkans to Afghanistan. Through its \r\nexperiences in these difficult areas, Italy has learned \r\nimportant lessons. In particular, our comprehensive \r\napproach provides valuable insight into how to \r\nintegrate the military aspects of a mission with the \r\ncommitment to economic, institutional and civil \r\nreconstruction. \r\n We are convinced that to meet the challenges of \r\nthe twenty-first century, the United Nations system \r\nmust be strengthened, starting with its capacity to \r\ncontribute to the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security. The United Nations must be empowered \r\nto fulfil its role as a “producer” of security and \r\nstability, a role designed to foster reconciliation, \r\nstrengthen democracy and, ultimately, help to create a \r\nmore stable world. \r\n This is why we support the Secretary-General’s \r\nNew Horizon and Global Field Support Strategy \r\ninitiatives. We must also continue to foster synergies \r\nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations \r\nthat play a key role in bringing peace to crisis areas. I \r\nrefer to the African Union and, above all, to the \r\nEuropean Union. The Treaty of Lisbon includes new \r\narrangements for the EU’s international representation. \r\nOnce the resolution on EU participation in the work of \r\nthe United Nations has finally been approved, I \r\nsincerely hope the European Union will be able to \r\nmake a greater contribution to General Assembly \r\nresponsibilities and to enhance the Assembly’s capacity \r\nfor providing political guidance. \r\n In the field of security, a commitment to \r\ndisarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of \r\nmass destruction has always been a feature of Italian \r\nforeign policy. Proliferation is a growing threat that \r\ncan only be countered through international \r\ncooperation and, in this regard, the Italian Government \r\nhas just put forth some concrete proposals. We need to \r\nset the goal of a zero-nuclear option in an appropriate \r\ntime frame, but without conveying the impression that \r\nit is an unrealistic aspiration. \r\n The year 2010 is a key date on the road to \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals. In this \r\nendeavour, our collective responsibility and credibility \r\nare at stake. Italy is a strong proponent of a holistic \r\napproach to development. For the sake of true \r\ndemocratic ownership, the donor community, in \r\ncollaboration with the private sector and civil society, \r\nmust work in a partnership that makes the beneficiary \r\ncountries the protagonists of development. \r\n The time has come for the international \r\ncommunity and the United Nations to increase their \r\ncommitment to two regional crises. Somalia is the most \r\nserious and urgent situation on the African continent \r\ntoday. In the past two years, the Italian Government \r\nhas contributed considerable financing to the African \r\nUnion Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and the Somali \r\nsecurity forces, but this is not enough. International \r\nsupport for AMISOM must be stepped up. \r\n The second crisis is in Pakistan, where the recent \r\nfloods have devastated the lives of 20 million people. \r\nThe Italian Government is disbursing an additional aid \r\npackage of €80 million to bring relief to the Pakistani \r\npopulation. \r\n But in addition to providing aid, we need to act \r\nwisely. This is why Italy has called for new trade \r\nmeasures to increase market access for Pakistani goods \r\nand bolster Pakistan’s economic recovery. A natural \r\ndisaster of this magnitude also demonstrates the urgent \r\nneed to address the effects of climate change through \r\ncollective and shared measures. \r\n Globalization has generated a new demand for \r\nbelonging and identity. But a fruitful dialogue among \r\ncultures cannot take place without universal values. It \r\nis imperative to defend the universal validity of \r\nfundamental rights and avoid the risks of relativism. \r\nGiven the strength of its humanistic heritage that \r\naffirms the human being as the measure of all things, \r\nItaly is well-equipped to play an important part in this \r\ndialectic. \r\n True to this heritage, the Italian Government has \r\npromoted a campaign for a moratorium on the death \r\npenalty. We welcome the strengthening international \r\ntrend towards achieving this objective, and hope it will \r\nbe confirmed when Italy and a broad alliance of \r\n A/65/PV.17\r\n \r\n19 10-55109 \r\n \r\ncountries present a resolution on the moratorium in the \r\nupcoming months. \r\n Religious tolerance is a prerequisite for peace and \r\na founding principle of our civilization. The right to \r\nsearch for truth through the word of God is the \r\nfreedom of freedoms, but in some areas of the world \r\npeople are afraid to freely and openly profess their \r\nfaith because they face persecution by extremists. Italy \r\nis strongly committed to protecting freedom of religion \r\nand will always oppose discrimination against religious \r\nminorities. In fact, Italy together with its EU partners is \r\nactively involved in the preparation and presentation of \r\nthe annual resolution on religious intolerance. \r\n Another target of our fight against discrimination \r\nis the international initiative to ban female genital \r\nmutilation. Since September 2009, Italy, together with \r\na group of African countries, has promoted such an \r\ninitiative, which, hopefully, will lead to the \r\npresentation here in the Assembly of a resolution that \r\nfully respects African ownership. \r\n Female genital mutilations, which violate a \r\nwoman’s physical integrity, affect millions of women \r\nand girls throughout the world, including in my \r\ncountry, where 35,000 such cases have been reported. \r\nWomen’s rights and national progress go hand in hand, \r\nbut, nevertheless, women are still suffering in many \r\ncountries throughout the world. \r\n By pooling together our efforts we can ensure the \r\nnecessary consensus for resolutions that safeguard our \r\nown and future generations from prejudice and \r\nintolerance. In this spirit, we very warmly welcome the \r\ncreation of UN Women within the Secretariat and hope \r\nthat it quickly becomes operative. \r\n Reaffirming the central role of the United Nations \r\nin global governance requires a constant commitment \r\nto the comprehensive reform of the Organization. Such \r\nreform should affect the Secretariat, the various funds, \r\nagencies and programmes of the United Nations and, \r\nobviously, its decision-making bodies. \r\n In regard to reform of the Security Council, we \r\nseek realistic compromise solutions that garner the \r\nbroadest possible consensus and ensure an adequate \r\nrepresentation of African, Arab and other \r\nunderrepresented groups of countries. More than \r\n15 years of negotiations have demonstrated that the \r\nmembership is profoundly divided. It is now time to \r\nsearch for genuine and far-reaching compromise. Italy \r\nand its Uniting for Consensus partners are ready to \r\nparticipate constructively in the reform process and \r\nhave already demonstrated their flexibility. We look \r\nforward to engaging with the rest of the membership \r\nduring the current session of the General Assembly. \r\n The process of revitalizing the General Assembly \r\nshould strive to restore its central role. The Assembly’s \r\nuniversal character gives it potential for providing \r\npolitical guidance that should be realized. The \r\nAssembly is the place where we could jointly identify \r\nthe main problems that threaten the security, stability \r\nand development of all Member States and draft \r\ncommon strategies to address them effectively. \r\n In conclusion, the vision for the future to which \r\nmy country, Italy, aspires — a future of peaceful \r\ncoexistence and mutual enrichment between values and \r\ncultures — can only be ensured through the successful \r\ncompletion of the many reform processes under way. \r\nWe can achieve this future if we build our actions on \r\ndialogue and mutual understanding. And when we do \r\nachieve peaceful coexistence and mutual enrichment, \r\nthe United Nations system will be equipped with the \r\ntools it needs to fulfil the main principles and values of \r\nthe Charter. One of these stands above all the others in \r\nimportance: each and every individual throughout the \r\nworld is endowed with inalienable and absolute rights \r\nconcerning which no kind of compromise can ever be \r\ntolerated. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Miguel Ángel Moratinos \r\nCuyaubé, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation \r\nof the Kingdom of Spain. \r\n Mr. Moratinos Cuyaubé (Spain) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): May my first words be to congratulate the \r\nnewly appointed President of the Assembly, Mr. Joseph \r\nDeiss, to whom I wish great success in his conduct of \r\nthe sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly. \r\n September is an important month in the agenda of \r\ninternational politics since the middle of the last \r\ncentury because it marks the beginning of the new \r\nsession of the United Nations General Assembly, which \r\nhas the city of New York as its backdrop. \r\n Far removed is the San Francisco Conference, \r\nwhich turned the page on global conflicts and opened \r\nthe way for international cooperation by establishing a \r\nnew Organization, the United Nations, an Organization \r\ngeared towards promoting peace, justice and a better \r\nA/65/PV.17  \r\n \r\n10-55109 20 \r\n \r\nlife for all humankind. Far removed, as well, are the \r\ntimes of the Bretton Woods Agreements, which \r\nestablished free trade rules for commercial and \r\nfinancial relations among the most industrialized \r\nnations of the world in order to achieve peace. \r\n In the first decade of this century we witnessed \r\nevents that have shaped the future of international \r\nrelations and caused a new world to emerge, as we saw \r\nin New York in the month of September. On \r\n11 September 2001, the cities of New York and \r\nWashington suffered terrorist attacks that stunned the \r\nworld and were among the most traumatic in the \r\nhistory of the West. In September 2008, New York was \r\nthe centre and focus of a panic created by the \r\nbankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, while just a few \r\nweeks ago, our host city experienced tensions related \r\nto intercultural coexistence and saw the relaunching of \r\nthe most ambitious programme of international \r\ncooperation in history, the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. \r\n These events mark the true beginning of the \r\ntwenty-first century, which is unfolding in an \r\nenvironment of accelerated global and interdependent \r\ntransformation. We are at a historic crossroads where \r\nwe must promote awareness of the reform of the \r\nUnited Nations system and the establishment of new \r\nmechanisms for global governance that modernize the \r\nsystem of international relations, consolidate \r\nmultilateralism and security, and strengthen global \r\neconomic recovery, while providing accountable \r\nmanagement of growing interculturalism. \r\n Effective multilateralism is the method that will \r\nenable us to tackle the challenges of the twenty-first \r\ncentury. It is a method that stems from the efforts of \r\nthe General Assembly and from the commitment and \r\nwork of the leaders of the States represented here. It is \r\na method based on respect and understanding in order \r\nto build new alliances and common strategies and \r\npolicies. \r\n On many occasions, we hear speeches that \r\nemphasize the incapacities and weaknesses of the \r\nUnited Nations system. But I prefer not to preach \r\nclassic doom and gloom here; rather, I would \r\nacknowledge the work and success of the United \r\nNations as well as its capacity to respond, as seen in its \r\nresponse to the natural disasters suffered by Haiti and \r\nPakistan. The capacity to take action and effectively \r\ncoordinate the efforts of all countries through a \r\nmultilateral approach is a path that the international \r\nsystem should continue to follow at this time of great \r\nchallenges before us. \r\n On 11 September, the concept of security was \r\ntransformed and expanded. In September 2006, the \r\nMember States approved the United Nations Global \r\nCounter-Terrorism Strategy, a resolution and annexed \r\nPlan of Action (resolution 60/288) which presumed for \r\nthe first time to define a common strategic approach \r\nagreed by all States Members of the United Nations. \r\nThis strategy was presented by Secretary-General Kofi \r\nAnnan one year after the brutal and traumatic attacks \r\nof 11 March 2004 in Madrid. Since that time, the \r\nintensity and number of terrorist attacks have \r\ndecreased, and we have improved security, although we \r\nare far from having won the war against international \r\nterrorism. \r\n This year we have also seen very significant \r\nadvances in the area of security, disarmament and \r\nnuclear non proliferation. The new Strategic Arms \r\nReduction Treaty makes it possible to reduce by 30 per \r\ncent of the nuclear warheads in the United States and \r\nRussia and represents the greatest nuclear agreement in \r\n20 years. Last May, 189 countries signatories of the \r\nTreaty on the Non Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \r\napproved the convening of a conference in 2012 to \r\ntransform the Middle East into a zone free of weapons \r\nof mass destruction. \r\n We are beginning to come out of the worst \r\nfinancial and economic crisis since the 1930s. The \r\nnegative fallout of this crisis will be felt through time \r\nby millions of people, especially in terms of decent \r\nemployment. Since the collapse of Lehman Brothers on \r\n15 September 2008, the international financial system \r\nhas required States and international institutions, such \r\nas the International Monetary Fund and the World \r\nBank, to intervene at an unprecedented level in order to \r\nmaintain worldwide demand and financial markets. \r\n The lack of international regulation helped to \r\nbring about the crisis of the financial entities and has \r\nrequired strengthened coordination, making the Group \r\nof 20 a new forum for economic governance. The \r\nlesson of the crisis is that, for their development, \r\ninternational markets need not only the invisible hand, \r\nbut also a global regulatory system. That is what we \r\nhave understood in Europe, where we have adopted \r\nmeasures to harmonize the legislation of member \r\nStates, so that regulatory authorities would be able to \r\n A/65/PV.17\r\n \r\n21 10-55109 \r\n \r\nexercise both executive and disciplinary powers. Since \r\nthe adoption of the Lisbon Treaty, Europe is now on a \r\npath to cohesiveness in the area of foreign policy and \r\nshould be seen as a single interlocutor with its own \r\nvoice in the international community. It should \r\ntherefore enjoy an appropriate status in the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n My Government, the Government of Spain, is in \r\nthe vanguard of the fight against hunger and poverty. It \r\nhas proposed in the United Nations, together with other \r\nMember States, the creation of a tax on international \r\ncurrency transactions whose proceeds would be used \r\nfor the achievement of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. While the Food and Agriculture Organization \r\nhas provided us with encouraging data — we have seen \r\nhunger decrease in the world for the first time — the \r\nfigure of 925 million hungry people in the world is \r\nmorally and politically unacceptable. \r\n Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon knows that he \r\ncan count on Spain for the mobilization of efforts to \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals. Indeed, \r\nfighting poverty cannot be a casualty of the economic \r\nrecession because, despite the crisis, it is not material \r\nconditions but political will that will be the key to the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals by \r\n2015. \r\n The time has come to take responsibility for \r\ncombating climate change. To face this challenge, we \r\nneed to change the way in which we perceive \r\ndevelopment and economic growth. A greater effort is \r\nrequired to limit and reduce greenhouse gas emissions \r\nand dependency on fossil fuels, and to commit to \r\nrenewable energy and efficient and responsible \r\nconsumption. The United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change has created a point of \r\nreference to provide us with a regime that defines \r\nrealistic solutions and responds to our concerns and \r\npriorities. \r\n In a few months, we will attend the Climate \r\nChange Conference and should be aware of the effort \r\nnecessary to pave the way to the meeting in Cancún, \r\nwhere the very credibility of the multilateral system \r\nwill be at stake. The Conference will be successful if \r\nwe take a realistic approach demonstrating solidarity \r\nand generosity towards the most vulnerable States. It \r\nshould lead us to an ambitious agreement by which \r\nStates represented in the General Assembly can take \r\nownership of the objectives and verifiable \r\ncommitments contained therein. \r\n To bring these objectives to fruition, we need the \r\nequitable integration of almost half the world’s \r\npopulation — women. The tenth anniversary of the \r\nadoption of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), \r\non women and peace and security, should provide us \r\nwith an opportunity to enhance gender equality in the \r\npublic arena, in institutions and in the economic, social \r\nand cultural spheres. We can and should move ahead \r\nwith these reforms because there are positive \r\nindications that this mandate is dynamic, such as the \r\nrecent creation of UN Women, led by former President \r\nof Chile Michelle Bachelet, whom I congratulate on \r\nher appointment as Director of the new entity. \r\n With regard to human rights, Spain is firmly \r\ncommitted to abolishing the death penalty and \r\nintroduced an initiative to the General Assembly two \r\nyears ago to that end. The International Commission \r\nagainst the Death Penalty, proposed by Spanish Prime \r\nMinister José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, will soon be \r\nestablished and begin its work. We believe that capital \r\npunishment is an absolute violation of human rights \r\ndue to its irreversibility, which also makes it the most \r\nextreme case of cruel, inhuman and degrading \r\ntreatment. \r\n My country unequivocally supports peaceful and \r\nnegotiated solutions to all international conflicts, in \r\naccordance with United Nations resolutions. Achieving \r\npeace in the Middle East remains a strategic priority \r\nfor Spain. That is why, on the eve of the twentieth \r\nanniversary of the Madrid Conference, we continue to \r\nwork resolutely to ensure that the process of direct \r\ntalks between Israelis and Palestinians will finally lead \r\nto the two-State solution. The Israeli and Palestinian \r\npeoples know they can count on all our support at this \r\ntime, when various thorny issues related to the conflict \r\nare being addressed. \r\n In this regard, I add my voice to the appeal made \r\nfrom this very rostrum by the President of the United \r\nStates for the moratorium on building in the \r\nsettlements to be maintained. In order to achieve a \r\nlasting, fair and comprehensive peace, it is vital to \r\nresolve the issues that relate to Syria and Lebanon and \r\nto work within a multilateral framework that creates a \r\ngenuine global coalition for peace in the Middle East. \r\n We all know that stability in the Western Balkans \r\nand the full integration of its countries into the \r\nA/65/PV.17  \r\n \r\n10-55109 22 \r\n \r\nEuropean Union is a basic priority for Europe. In 2010, \r\nwe commemorated the tenth anniversary of the Zagreb \r\nConference. Spain, which held the European Union \r\npresidency at the time, convened a high-level meeting \r\nin Sarajevo in May that was attended by all actors \r\ninvolved and at which the European Union reaffirmed \r\nits commitment to the region’s stability and European \r\nfuture. Recently, the consensus adoption by the \r\nGeneral Assembly of resolution 64/298, sponsored by \r\nthe 27 members of the European Union and Serbia on \r\none of the region’s pending issues showed the \r\nwillingness of all actors in the international community \r\nto achieve the aforementioned objectives. \r\n Spain reiterates its support for the mediation \r\nefforts undertaken by the Personal Envoy of the \r\nSecretary-General for Western Sahara, Mr. Christopher \r\nRoss. The conflict in that territory must be resolved by \r\nmutual agreement among the parties and pursuant to \r\nthe United Nations resolutions calling for the self-\r\ndetermination of the Saharans. \r\n In our view, Ibero-America is undergoing \r\nunprecedented social and political change. At the start \r\nof the bicentennial commemorations of the \r\nindependence of these republics, Spain wishes to join \r\nthe celebrations by attending the Ibero-American \r\nsummits and by strengthening its bilateral relations and \r\nrelations between the European Union and Latin \r\nAmerica. \r\n Cuba deserves special mention following the \r\nrecent decisions taken by Cuban authorities. Embargos \r\nand unilateral attitudes that only disappoint new \r\nexpectations are useless and make no sense. \r\n Africa is clearly one of the most important future \r\nchallenges to the international community and the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nProgress achieved in the areas of good governance and \r\ndemocratization on the continent are cause for \r\noptimism and should allow it, with international \r\ncooperation, to overcome the crises in the Sahel, \r\nSomalia or the Great Lakes region. Spain reiterates its \r\nfirm commitment to Africa. \r\n Coexistence in a globalized world should \r\nmotivate us to strengthen the instruments for good \r\ngovernance and promote cultural and intercultural \r\ndiversity, which are among the most pressing \r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century. International \r\nconsolidation of the Alliance of Civilizations, as a tool \r\nof preventive diplomacy, is now a fact and a resource \r\nwe must use. More than 100 States, along with \r\n23 international organizations, now belong to the \r\nGroup of Friends of the Alliance of Civilizations. I take \r\nthis opportunity to invite those countries that have not \r\nyet joined to do so. \r\n In a landscape of international economic crisis, \r\nintercultural tensions run the risk of exacerbation. This \r\nshould impel us to continue working for the respect \r\nand understanding of cultures and civilizations in order \r\nto counter expressions of hatred, fanaticism, division \r\nand confrontation. \r\n The new world requires us to adapt and enlarge \r\nthe international institutional architecture. As the \r\nSpanish philosopher, José Ortega y Gasset said, “men \r\ndo not live together just because; they do so for the \r\npurpose of great undertakings”. Today the United \r\nNations has a great undertaking: to complete the \r\nreform of our institutions and lay the foundations for \r\nglobal governance. Together, we can face the \r\nchallenges and global crises of the twenty-first century \r\nand construct an international system that is fairer, \r\nmore balanced and more sustainable. \r\n Bretton Woods in 1944 and the San Francisco \r\nConference in 1945 were the results of half a century \r\nof crises and two world wars. Believe me, we are not \r\ndoomed to wait another half century to reform and \r\nestablish new institutions for the twenty-first century. \r\nWe have already waited a decade, but we cannot \r\ncontinue to wait much longer, because we can feel \r\nhistory breathing down our necks. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Michael Spindelegger, \r\nFederal Minister for European and International Affairs \r\nof Austria. \r\n Mr. Spindelegger (Austria): The tragic \r\nearthquake in Haiti, the devastating floods in Pakistan \r\nand the financial crisis have reminded us that the \r\nglobal challenges of the twenty-first century require \r\nconcerted action. The United Nations needs to be at the \r\ncentre of our activities. It is the forum of today’s \r\nmultilateral system that enjoys the highest degree of \r\nlegitimacy. Inclusiveness is its key comparative \r\nadvantage. \r\n However, this moral authority must be matched \r\nby mechanisms and resources to ensure its \r\neffectiveness. Adherence to the rule of law is \r\nfundamental. All multilateral efforts and activities need \r\n A/65/PV.17\r\n \r\n23 10-55109 \r\n \r\nto operate on the basis of clear and predictable rules \r\nthat apply equally to all Member States. Member \r\nStates, as well as men and women around the globe, \r\nmust be able to trust in the United Nations capacity to \r\nturn the promises of the Charter into reality. \r\n Cooperation with other international actors is \r\nindispensable to the United Nations efforts to deal with \r\nthe complex challenges of today. Austria and the \r\nEuropean Union (EU) stand ready as reliable partners \r\nfor the United Nations in areas ranging from \r\ndevelopment cooperation and humanitarian aid to the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security and to \r\npromoting the respect for the rule of law and human \r\nrights. In this context, we hope that our initiative to \r\nobtain modalities for the EU’s participation in the \r\nGeneral Assembly, reflecting the changes provided for \r\nin the Treaty of Lisbon, will soon be adopted. This \r\nwould greatly help to reinforce the productive \r\npartnership of the United Nations with an organization \r\nthat is fully committed to the principles and objectives \r\nenshrined in the Charter. Austria is proud to contribute \r\nto the work of the United Nations by hosting the \r\nUnited Nations Office at Vienna. We will continue to \r\noffer Vienna as a platform for dialogue and \r\ncooperation. \r\n In our view, good governance is an inherent \r\nelement of global governance. The Vienna-based \r\nUnited Nations Office on Drugs and Crime is central to \r\nthe United Nations efforts to combat corruption and \r\norganized crime by supporting Member States in \r\nimplementing international standards, including the \r\nUnited Nations Convention against Corruption. \r\nCorruption presents one of the major challenges with \r\ndire consequences for the international community’s \r\nefforts to reduce poverty. The recent founding of the \r\nInternational Anti-Corruption Academy in Austria is an \r\nimportant step towards addressing this challenge. That \r\ninstitution aims to provide a tool for research, \r\neducation and training for professionals from all fields, \r\nincluding law enforcement officials, judges and \r\nprosecutors. \r\n The fight against climate change is one of the \r\ncentral issues of the twenty-first century. Climate \r\nchange has a far-reaching impact on the economic and \r\nsocial development of the entire international \r\ncommunity. We need global consensus now if we want \r\nto achieve the goal to limit global warming to 2°C and \r\nto reverse the trend of rising greenhouse gas emissions \r\nby 2020. Nobody should underestimate the difficulty of \r\nthis task. However, the fight against climate change is \r\nalso an opportunity. We have the chance to create a \r\nframework for sustainable, qualitative growth at the \r\nglobal level. Austria is committed to contributing to \r\nthis endeavour. \r\n This week, leaders agreed on concrete actions to \r\nget the Millennium Development Goals back on track \r\nin the fight against world poverty. We now need to \r\nmobilize all our efforts to live up to this renewed \r\ncommitment, particularly in addressing the special \r\nneeds of Africa in this regard. The Governments of \r\ndeveloping and developed countries, as well as the \r\nprivate sector and civil society, need to work together \r\nto achieve our ambitious goals by 2015. \r\n Let me now turn to one of the most urgent threats \r\nto peace and security. These days, our attention is \r\nfocused on the recently initiated direct talks between \r\nPrime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas. We \r\nwelcome the leadership and commitment of President \r\nObama, who made this development possible. These \r\ntalks offer the first concrete prospects for a sustainable \r\npeace in the Middle East in many years. An agreement \r\nbetween Israel and Palestine would not only radically \r\nimprove the lives of the peoples concerned, but would \r\nalso provide the key to a more stable region and a more \r\npeaceful world. We hope that both sides are aware of \r\ntheir enormous responsibilities. \r\n The process is still fragile. We believe that the \r\nextension of the settlement moratorium is fundamental \r\nto keeping the talks on track and creating an \r\nenvironment in which the core issues can be tackled \r\nsuccessfully. It is equally important that the efforts of \r\nthe Palestinian authorities to build up functioning \r\ninstitutions for a future Palestinian State move forward \r\ndynamically. It is ultimately up to the parties to bring \r\nthe peace process to a positive conclusion. However, \r\ninternational actors, in particular the members of the \r\nQuartet, have an important role to play. As a member \r\nof the European Union, Austria is ready to fully play \r\nits part. \r\n In order to ensure that the United Nations \r\ncontinues to play a central role in global governance, \r\nwe must continue with our efforts towards internal \r\nreform of the United Nations, including the reform of \r\nthe Security Council. Both an enlargement of the \r\nSecurity Council that reflects today’s political, \r\neconomic and social realities and a reform of the \r\nCouncil’s working methods will enhance the Council’s \r\nA/65/PV.17  \r\n \r\n10-55109 24 \r\n \r\nlegitimacy and the acceptance of its decisions. As an \r\nelected member of the Security Council, we participate \r\nin its work with great commitment and are doing our \r\nbest to promote effectiveness and transparency. \r\n Significant efforts are under way to ensure and \r\nsustain United Nations peacekeeping as an essential \r\ntool for achieving the goals of the United Nations. \r\nConfronted with limited financial and human resources \r\nand the increasing complexity of peacekeeping \r\noperations, the United Nations has started a review of \r\nthe whole United Nations peacekeeping system with a \r\nview to adjusting it to the needs of the twenty-first \r\ncentury. It is of vital importance for the Council to \r\neffectively monitor and oversee the implementation of \r\npeacekeeping mandates, in close cooperation with \r\ntroop and police contributors, the Secretariat and \r\nUnited Nations missions. Austria fully supports the \r\nongoing peacekeeping reform and stands ready to play \r\nits part in a renewed global peacekeeping partnership. \r\n We also have to work on making peace \r\nconsolidation irreversible. The United Nations \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, together with integrated \r\npeacebuilding support offices, has a key role in \r\nfostering sustainable peace. If we use the \r\npeacebuilding architecture optimally, lasting peace can \r\nbe achieved with determination and the political will of \r\nthe country concerned, as well as the support of the \r\ninternational community. Since peacekeeping and \r\npeacebuilding must be approached in an integrated \r\nmanner, we strongly support the enhanced interaction \r\nof the Security Council with the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission throughout the conflict cycle, as was \r\naffirmed at the Security Council summit this week. \r\n Due to the changing nature of conflict and an \r\nincrease in the activities of non-State actors, the \r\nprotection of civilians in armed conflict constitutes a \r\ncore task of a large number of United Nations \r\npeacekeeping missions. The effective protection of \r\nthose affected by hostilities and violence has become a \r\nyardstick for the success and credibility of United \r\nNations missions in the field and the United Nations at \r\nlarge. Security Council resolution 1894 (2009), \r\nunanimously adopted in November last year, was a \r\nmajor step forward in the Council’s efforts to better \r\nprotect civilians from physical violence, displacement \r\nand violations of their rights. \r\n However, resolution 1894 (2009) has not yet had \r\nits full impact on the ground. Violations of \r\ninternational humanitarian and human rights law and \r\nimpunity for such crimes continue to pose a major \r\nthreat to the rule of law and lasting peace in post-\r\nconflict situations. \r\n Austria acknowledges the primary responsibility \r\nof States to ensure the protection of civilians, including \r\nthe credible prosecution of those responsible for war \r\ncrimes, genocide, crimes against humanity or other \r\nserious violations of international law. We support the \r\nuse and promotion of mechanisms such as the \r\nInternational Criminal Court, commissions of inquiry \r\nor panels of experts. Such tools should be seen as a \r\nviable complement and reinforcement of steps taken at \r\nthe national level to ensure accountability. The \r\nSecurity Council has a central role in this endeavour. \r\nEnsuring the implementation of resolution 1894 (2009) \r\nwill be one of the key priorities of Austria during the \r\nremainder of its term on the Council. \r\n Austria also attaches utmost importance to \r\nenhancing the role of women in conflict and post-\r\nconflict situations. Even 10 years after the adoption of \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1325 (2000), on women \r\nand peace and security, we can still witness major gaps. \r\nWomen continue to be largely absent from peace \r\nprocesses and conflict-resolution efforts, and crimes \r\nagainst them all too often remain unpunished. The \r\nlatest, shocking mass rapes in the Eastern Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo demonstrate more than ever that \r\nthere is urgent need for action. We cannot afford to \r\nignore those gaps. The occasion of the tenth \r\nanniversary of the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000) \r\nwill therefore provide a crucial opportunity to work \r\ntowards more consistent implementation in promoting \r\nwomen’s issues in all aspects of international peace \r\nefforts. Those efforts are fully supported by our \r\ndevelopment cooperation. \r\n Austria warmly welcomes the milestone decision \r\nof the General Assembly to establish UN Women, \r\nwhich will make the United Nations a stronger and \r\nmore effective partner in the advancement of women \r\nworldwide. We look forward to working with Michelle \r\nBachelet towards our common goals. \r\n Children in armed conflict deserve special \r\nprotection. I am very satisfied that the United Nations \r\nsystem has made concrete progress in combating \r\nserious child rights violations and in fighting the \r\nrecruitment and enlisting of child soldiers. \r\n A/65/PV.17\r\n \r\n25 10-55109 \r\n \r\n Austria reiterates the pivotal role of the United \r\nNations at the centre of our counter-terrorism efforts. \r\nRespect for human rights and the rule of law is a \r\nfundamental basis of the fight against terrorism. As \r\nChair of the Security Council Committee established \r\npursuant to resolution 1267 (1999) concerning Al-\r\nQaida and the Taliban, Austria is committed to \r\nenhancing due process in the Council’s sanctions \r\nregimes. We therefore welcome the substantial \r\nimprovements of the listing and de-listing procedures \r\nand the recent appointment of Ms. Kimberly Prost as \r\nOmbudsperson. \r\n The Austrian candidature for the Human Rights \r\nCouncil for the period 2011-2014 is a logical \r\ncontinuation of our long-term work and engagement in \r\nensuring the respect for human rights, including in the \r\nSecurity Council. Dialogue and partnerships are crucial \r\nfor turning the promises of the Universal Declaration \r\nof Human Rights into a reality for all people around \r\nthe globe. Austria has consistently worked with all \r\nactors towards narrowing the gap between standards \r\nand their implementation at the national and \r\ninternational levels. \r\n To end on a positive note, this past year saw the \r\nmost positive developments towards nuclear \r\ndisarmament in a decade. Security Council resolution \r\n1887 (2009), adopted just a year ago, provided a \r\npowerful impetus. Although many issues are still \r\nunresolved and require our close attention, the Review \r\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in May \r\nproduced an outcome that restored confidence in the \r\nTreaty. For the first time, a comprehensive action plan \r\ndealing with all three pillars of the Treaty was agreed. \r\nLet me stress here that Austria is honoured to have \r\ncontributed to that success. For the first time, a world \r\nwithout nuclear weapons was accepted as the goal of \r\nall parties, who pledged to ultimately eliminate all \r\ntypes of nuclear weapons. For the first time, the \r\ncatastrophic humanitarian consequences of the use of \r\nsuch weapons were recognized — an important step \r\ntowards the eventual legal ban of nuclear weapons by \r\nmeans of a nuclear weapons convention or framework \r\nof legal instruments. \r\n Although the results of the Conference are \r\npositive, much remains to be done. The action plan \r\nneeds to be implemented. The nuclear-weapon \r\nStates — which promised to engage among themselves \r\non a number of vital issues and report by 2014 — must \r\nlead by example. The international disarmament \r\nstructures must be reformed. I am grateful for \r\nSecretary-General Ban’s initiative in this respect. \r\n Finally, we must learn from successful \r\ndisarmament initiatives. Let me underline that Austria \r\nis delighted that the Convention on Cluster Munitions \r\nentered into force last month. The Convention is a \r\npositive example of how committed Governments, \r\ninternational organizations and civil society can work \r\ntogether to achieve real progress. In order to promote \r\ninteraction in this respect in the nuclear field as well, \r\nAustria supports the establishment of a competence \r\ncentre for nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation in \r\nVienna early next year. Conceived as a platform for \r\nopen discussion and independent expertise, monitoring \r\nand advocacy, the centre shall facilitate understanding \r\nand cooperation among all entities involved. I hope \r\nthat it will contribute to further progress in nuclear \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation. \r\n We, the United Nations, have shared \r\nresponsibility to move forward jointly in order to reach \r\nour common goal of international peace, security and \r\ndevelopment for all. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on Her Excellency Ms. Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, \r\nMinister for International Relations and Cooperation of \r\nSouth Africa. \r\n Ms. Nkoana-Mashabane (South Africa): My \r\ndelegation joins previous speakers in expressing our \r\ncongratulations to Mr. Joseph Deiss on his election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth \r\nsession. We want to take this opportunity to assure him \r\nof our full cooperation and to wish him a very \r\nsuccessful and rewarding term. I also take this \r\nopportunity to thank Mr. Ali Treki for the excellent \r\nwork he did in steering this Assembly during his tenure \r\nas President during its sixty-fourth session. \r\n The theme of the sixty-fifth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly — “Reaffirming the central role of \r\nthe United Nations in global governance” — resonates \r\nwith what our global citizen, Nelson Rolihlahla \r\nMandela, said about this body on the occasion of its \r\nfiftieth anniversary: \r\n “The United Nations has to reassess its role, \r\nredefine its profile and reshape its structures. It \r\nshould truly reflect the diversity of our universe \r\nand ensure equity among the nations in the \r\nA/65/PV.17  \r\n \r\n10-55109 26 \r\n \r\nexercise of power within the system of \r\ninternational relations, in general, and the \r\nSecurity Council, in particular.” (A/50/PV.37, \r\np. 6) \r\nMy delegation supports the choice of this theme, and \r\nwe wish to reiterate our belief in the centrality of the \r\nUnited Nations and the system of multilateralism. \r\n Despite the challenges that face humanity in the \r\ntwenty-first century, the relevance of the United \r\nNations as a multilateral mechanism through which a \r\nmyriad of complex world affairs can be administered \r\nand resolved cannot be overemphasized. Those \r\nchallenges compel us more than ever before to \r\nstrengthen the United Nations. South Africa is \r\ncommitted to working with other Member States to \r\nachieve the full potential of the United Nations to \r\naddress the urgent challenges facing the international \r\ncommunity by making it more relevant, more \r\nresponsive to the diversity of humankind and more \r\nrepresentative. \r\n The creation of the United Nations was one of the \r\nnotable successes of the twentieth century, and thanks \r\nto its existence the world has been spared another war \r\non the scale and magnitude of the First and Second \r\nWorld Wars. The exponential growth in the \r\nmembership of the Organization over the years, from \r\n51 Members in 1945 to 192 today, clearly demonstrates \r\nthe confidence that the peoples of the world have \r\nplaced in the United Nations and the ideals contained \r\nin its Charter. \r\n The universal membership of the United Nations \r\ngives it the legitimacy to be at the centre of efforts to \r\naddress global challenges. However, the question is \r\nwhether the United Nations has leveraged that diversity \r\nof its membership as a source of strength and acted \r\ndecisively against any tendency that runs contrary to its \r\nfundamental values and founding principles. \r\n The answer to this is yes because, in the past, the \r\nUnited Nations played an invaluable role in the \r\nworldwide process of decolonization, transforming the \r\npolitical landscape of the world and bringing much-\r\ncherished freedom and independence to the peoples of \r\nAfrica, Asia and Latin America. The Organization was \r\ninstrumental in bringing about the demise of the \r\nuniversally despised apartheid system in our own \r\ncountry, South Africa. \r\n When the Organization recognized the right to \r\ndevelopment as a human right, it gave voice and hope \r\nto those who know the face of poverty. When the \r\nOrganization has sent its troops to far-flung places to \r\nkeep peace among neighbours who should be living \r\ntogether, it has again underscored the reason for which \r\nit was established. Amid all the challenges, the United \r\nNations has been relevant and responsive to our \r\ndiverse interests. \r\n Five years ago, at the World Summit, we agreed \r\nthat, if the Organization were to continue to play its \r\ncentral role in global governance effectively, there was \r\na need to strengthen and reposition it to deal with the \r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century.  We believe that \r\nthe revitalization of the General Assembly remains one \r\nof the cornerstones of the United Nations reform \r\nagenda. The General Assembly is the chief \r\ndeliberative, policymaking and representative organ of \r\nthe United Nations and plays a critical role in the \r\nprocess of standard-setting and the codification of \r\ninternational law. Its decisions are taken by a collective \r\namong equals for the common good. \r\n We will support measures that are aimed at \r\nenhancing the effectiveness of the General Assembly, \r\nespecially regarding its role in the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. Indeed, we witnessed \r\nwith satisfaction how, on several occasions, the \r\nGeneral Assembly acted promptly when the Security \r\nCouncil was unwilling or unable to respond to grave \r\ndevelopments in the aftermath of the conflict in Gaza \r\nin 2009. \r\n Indeed, no transformation of the United Nations \r\ncould be complete without the fundamental reform of \r\nthe Security Council. South Africa believes that the \r\nobjective of the reform should be to create a Security \r\nCouncil that is truly representative of the membership \r\nand effectively responsive to international crises, as \r\nmandated by the Charter of the United Nations. Indeed, \r\nit remains a travesty of justice that Africa, which \r\naccounts for a large portion of the work of the Council, \r\nis not represented in the permanent category. Thus, \r\ndeliberations about us carry on without us. \r\n The world should be free of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction, in accordance with our undertakings on \r\ntotal disarmament. In that regard, South Africa \r\nwelcomes the recently agreed programme of work of \r\nthe Conference on Disarmament. \r\n A/65/PV.17\r\n \r\n27 10-55109 \r\n \r\n While the right to development and freedom from \r\nwant are central to the work of the United Nations, we \r\nhave just ended the High-level Plenary Meeting to \r\nreview our performance in achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and agreed that more needs to be \r\ndone to act on commitments already made by the \r\ninternational community in that regard. \r\n The people of Haiti have a story to tell about how \r\nbest the international community can respond in unison \r\nand effectively to a nation in distress. \r\n A speedy and satisfactory conclusion of the Doha \r\nRound of the World Trade Organization, which \r\npromised so much for the developing South, \r\nunfortunately remains a dream yet to be fulfilled. At \r\nthe same time, the global economic crisis has \r\nhighlighted the point that many of us have always \r\nmade about the need to work for an international \r\nfinancial architecture that is sensitive to the \r\ndevelopment needs of the South. \r\n The contribution of the Group of 20 (G-20) is a \r\nwelcome development in that regard, and we believe \r\nthat the Group should complement and reinforce the \r\ngood work of the United Nations and not act as an \r\nalternative. In its composition, the G-20 will also need \r\nto mirror the rich diversity of humankind by making \r\nsure that all regions of the world, in particular Africa, \r\nare well represented. We look forward to the full \r\nimplementation of the undertakings made to transform \r\nthe international financial architecture, including the \r\nreform of the Bretton Woods institutions, as a step \r\ntowards building a world system founded on equity and \r\nsocial justice. \r\n Environmental issues, including climate change, \r\nhave also become high on the priorities of the \r\ninternational agenda. South Africa is fully committed \r\nto a multilateral outcome on the basis of the Bali Plan \r\nof Action, with a two-track negotiated and legally \r\nbinding outcome. We are convinced that the \r\nCopenhagen Accord provides political guidance for \r\nfuture negotiations. \r\n Accordingly, we should work together to ensure \r\nthat the forthcoming meeting of the sixteenth session \r\nof the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change in Mexico \r\ntakes bold and concrete steps to address climate change \r\nand its effects. For our part, South Africa will have the \r\nopportunity to host the seventeenth session of the \r\nConference of the Parties in December 2011, on the \r\neve of the end of the first commitment period of the \r\nKyoto Protocol. \r\n Peace and stability are one of the preconditions \r\nfor bringing about an Africa of the new beginning that \r\nthe Chairperson of the African Union, His Excellency \r\nPresident Wa Mutharika of Malawi, spoke of on the \r\nfirst day of the general debate (see A/65/PV.11). The \r\nUnited Nations has been an important partner to Africa, \r\nworking with us through the African Union, whether in \r\nSomalia, the Sudan or the Democratic Republic of \r\nCongo. South Africa is encouraged by the commitment \r\nshown by the international community in trying to \r\nassist the both the Government of the Sudan and \r\nSouthern Sudan as they prepare for the upcoming \r\nreferendum in January 2011. \r\n The people of Zimbabwe also need the helping \r\nhand of the international community in implementing \r\ntheir Global Political Agreement. The African Union \r\nand the Southern African Development Community \r\nspeak for us, too, in calling for the lifting of sanctions \r\nagainst Zimbabwe. We will continue to work with the \r\npeoples of Zimbabwe, Madagascar and Burundi, \r\namong others, in their efforts to build and consolidate \r\npeace and democracy in their respective countries. \r\n In the case of Western Sahara, South Africa \r\nremains concerned about the continuing impasse, \r\nwhich stands in the way of a solution that will result in \r\nthe people of Western Sahara exercising their \r\ninalienable right to self-determination. We count on the \r\nUnited Nations, especially the Security Council, to \r\ncontinue to make decisions that enable us to decisively \r\ndeal with the challenges of peace and security on our \r\ncontinent. \r\n The United Nations should see Africa as a partner \r\nin the maintenance of international peace and the \r\nmanagement of conflicts, and accordingly do more to \r\nstrengthen the working relationship between the \r\nSecurity Council and the African Union Peace and \r\nSecurity Council. In this respect, South Africa will \r\ncontinue to support all international efforts to help the \r\npeople of Palestine and Israel in their endeavour to find \r\nlasting peace, leading to the establishment of a viable \r\nPalestinian State, on the basis of the 1967 borders and \r\nwith East Jerusalem as its capital, existing side by side \r\nin peace and security with Israel. \r\n We are at one with the call made by several \r\ndelegations for the lifting of the embargo on the \r\nRepublic of Cuba. \r\nA/65/PV.17  \r\n \r\n10-55109 28 \r\n \r\n We have converged here year after year to make \r\nstrong statements on Palestine, the embargo on Cuba \r\nand the independence of the Western Sahara. The \r\nultimate test of the relevance of the United Nations \r\nwill therefore be in bringing closure to all these long \r\noutstanding issues in a manner that is consistent with \r\nour decisions and the collective will of nations \r\nrepresented in this Organization. \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n In conclusion, we were also privileged recently to \r\nbe the stage, and Africa the theatre, of the 2010 \r\nFédération internationale de football association World \r\nCup tournament. Our people spoke for us during that \r\nsoccer event in how they embraced each other and in \r\ntheir diversity of many nations, consistent with the \r\nspirit of ubuntu, which simply means “I am because \r\nyou are”. They gave us hope and confirmed the faith \r\nwe have in our belief that a better world is possible. \r\nThe role of sport in development and in advancing \r\npeace can never be underestimated. As States, we can \r\nbest respond to this message from our people by \r\nmaking sure that the United Nations, in playing its role \r\nin the global system, is more relevant, more inclusive \r\nand more representative. \r\n Looking ahead, South Africa is honoured to have \r\nbeen endorsed by the African Union as a candidate for \r\nthe Security Council non-permanent membership for \r\nthe period 2011-2012. We stand ready to continue to \r\ncontribute to the achievement of peace and security in \r\nthe world. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Edward Nalbandyan, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Armenia. \r\n Mr. Nalbandyan (Armenia) (spoke in French): \r\nEach year, the great family of nations comes together \r\nto assess what the Organization has achieved and to \r\nconsider together ways to respond to the problems \r\nfacing the world and to acknowledge what unites our \r\nnations and what still divides them. \r\n For 65 years, the General Assembly has carried \r\nout this both difficult and noble mission. That mission \r\nwas summarized very well by the first speaker at the \r\nfirst session of the General Assembly, on 10 January \r\n1946, as the maintenance of peace and security and the \r\nestablishment, through cooperation, of those conditions \r\nof stability and well-being which will ensure peaceful \r\nand friendly relations, based on the principle of equal \r\nrights and self-determination among the nations of the \r\nworld. \r\n Since then, the General Assembly has changed. \r\nThe number of Members has almost quadrupled, major \r\ndecisions have been made, historic documents have \r\nbeen adopted, old problems have given way to new, \r\nand the scope of responsibilities of the General \r\nAssembly has greatly increased as it has opened itself \r\nto new challenges in international security, \r\nnon-proliferation, disarmament, respect for human \r\nrights, poverty, terrorism, global warming, the financial \r\ncrisis and many other issues. \r\n In short, many things have changed, including the \r\ncentury. \r\n Nevertheless and despite the developments that \r\nhave marked recent decades, the situation in the region \r\nwhere Armenia is situated prompts me to return to that \r\nday, 10 January 1946, which is so distant yet so close, \r\ngiven the objectives that were put forward then and \r\nwhich continue more than ever to underpin our actions. \r\n How is it possible to maintain peace, security and \r\nstability when we keep raising defence spending and \r\nregularly threaten to use force and to start wars? How \r\ncan we promote friendly and peaceful relations \r\nbetween peoples when we promote intolerance and \r\nhatred and impose blockades and closed borders? How \r\ncan we assure the principle of the equal rights of \r\npeoples and their right to make their own decisions \r\nwhen we reject the fundamental principle of \r\ninternational law — the right of peoples to self-\r\ndetermination? \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n I would like to hereby touch upon the conflict \r\nbetween Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh. The \r\npeople of Nagorno-Karabakh exercised their right to \r\nself-determination two decades ago. They fought for \r\ntheir right to freedom, withstanding the brutal war \r\nunleashed by Azerbaijan, which had suppressed them \r\nfor 70 years and attempted to cleanse them from their \r\nancestral home. For that purpose, it even resorted to \r\nthe use of mercenaries closely linked to international \r\nterrorist organizations. The people of Nagorno-\r\nKarabakh had to pursue their right to self-\r\ndetermination as they were being denied their right to \r\nexistence. \r\n The right of peoples to self-determination is a \r\nfundamental and indispensable right enshrined in the \r\n A/65/PV.17\r\n \r\n29 10-55109 \r\n \r\nCharter of the United Nations. The advisory opinion \r\nissued by the International Court of Justice in July \r\nreaffirmed the wisdom of the founders of this \r\nOrganization, who made sure that one of the \r\nfundamental principles for maintaining peace and \r\nstability in the world — the right of peoples to self-\r\ndetermination — could not be underrated in any way \r\ncompared with the other principles of international law. \r\n Let us be realistic. One cannot say each and every \r\ntime that this is the last self-determination case. No \r\none is able to stop the progress of history; otherwise, \r\nthere would not be 192 Member States in this \r\nOrganization instead of 51, as there were at the time of \r\nits founding. \r\n The Nagorno-Karabakh peace process moves \r\nforward with the internationally mandated mediation of \r\nthe Co-Chairs of the Organization for Security and \r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) Minsk Group, who \r\ncontinue their persistent efforts aimed at the peaceful \r\nsettlement of the conflict based on the fundamental \r\nprinciples of international law: the non-use of force or \r\nthreat of force, the equal rights and self-determination \r\nof peoples and territorial integrity. \r\n On 17 July, at the margins of the OSCE informal \r\nministerial meeting in Almaty, the Minsk Group \r\nCo-Chairs issued a statement in which they reiterated \r\nthat the proposed principles and elements have been \r\nconceived as an integrated whole and that any attempt \r\nto select some of them over others would make it \r\nimpossible to achieve a balanced solution. Armenia \r\nfully shares this vision and will continue the \r\nnegotiations on that basis in search of a peaceful \r\nsettlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. \r\n Unfortunately, Azerbaijan rejects two of the three \r\nprinciples mentioned and is attempting not only to turn \r\nupside down the essence of the negotiation process, but \r\nalso to distort the nature of the conflict in various \r\ninternational forums, including the General Assembly, \r\nas happened here about two weeks ago and again two \r\ndays ago. That country is attempting to mislead the \r\ninternational community, presenting the consequences \r\nof the conflict as its causes. \r\n Azerbaijan’s unabated war rhetoric, growing \r\nviolations of the ceasefire regime, and unprecedented \r\nmilitary budget increases only exacerbate the situation, \r\nraising concerns about the already fragile stability in \r\nthe region. Azerbaijan continues to reject proposals to \r\ncome to an agreement on the non-use of force or threat \r\nof force, as well as calls for the consolidation of the \r\nceasefire. Azerbaijan’s attitude thus represents a threat \r\nto regional peace and security. The money it derives \r\nfrom oil revenues is being directed at funding new \r\nmilitary ventures. We all know the potential results of \r\nsuch adventurism. \r\n Azerbaijan should refrain from its continuing \r\nattempts to remove the settlement process from the \r\nMinsk Group format and framework and from making \r\nprovocative and bellicose statements and actions, in \r\norder that the negotiation process may proceed more \r\nconstructively and effectively. \r\n In an era when the protection and promotion of \r\nhuman rights are considered essential in the civilized \r\nworld, intolerance for the values of others and acts that \r\nintentionally, consistently and repeatedly damage or \r\ndestroy the cultural or religious heritage of other \r\ncivilizations must be condemned with the same resolve \r\nand determination as violence against people. \r\n The destruction by Azerbaijanis between 1998 \r\nand 2005 in Nakhichevan of thousands of cross-stones \r\ndelicately carved by Armenian masters in the ninth to \r\nthe sixteenth centuries is a vivid example of such a \r\ncrime. Under the Azerbaijani Government’s watchful \r\neye, thousands of these gigantic medieval sculptures \r\nwere bulldozed and the area turned into a military zone \r\nin a Government-sanctioned operation. A resolution at \r\nthe sixteenth General Assembly of the International \r\nCouncil on Monuments and Sites stated regretfully \r\nwith regard to this act of vandalism: “… this heritage \r\nthat once enjoyed its worthy place among the treasures \r\nof the world’s heritage can no longer be transmitted \r\ntoday to future generations”. \r\n Armenia’s initiative for the normalization of \r\nrelations with Turkey without any preconditions was \r\nfully supported by the international community. Last \r\nyear, after intensive negotiations, we achieved \r\nagreement and finally signed the Armenian-Turkish \r\nprotocols. We made a confident investment in a durable \r\nrapprochement, while Turkey, unfortunately, \r\nbacktracked from its commitments and not only \r\nrefrained from ratifying the signed protocols, but \r\nreturned to its initial language of preconditions. \r\nConsequently, the Armenian-Turkish border continues \r\nto remain the only closed border in Europe. Good \r\nintentions must be proved in deeds, not just words. \r\nArmenia is ready to move forward when Turkey will \r\nA/65/PV.17  \r\n \r\n10-55109 30 \r\n \r\nonce again be prepared to normalize relations without \r\npreconditions. \r\n While we are discussing all possible ways to \r\ncreate a more prosperous and safer world for our \r\npeoples, we would be remiss if we did not speak about \r\nthe responsibility to protect. As a nation we survived \r\nthe most heinous crime against humanity, genocide, \r\n95 years ago. We attach the utmost importance to \r\nfurthering all international efforts aimed at the \r\nprevention of genocide and crimes against humanity. It \r\nis encouraging that further discussions of the \r\nSecretary-General’s report on early warning, \r\nassessment and the responsibility to protect (A/64/864) \r\nare being held in the General Assembly. This will \r\nenable us come up with a formula that will allow us to \r\nact in a timely and coherent manner, utilizing all the \r\nUnited Nations system resources and capabilities for \r\nearly warning, assessment and prevention of situations \r\nthat could lead to genocide, war crimes or crimes \r\nagainst humanity. \r\n To bolster United Nations capacity to deal with \r\ncurrent challenges and those ahead, we need to \r\nincrease our efforts to further the process of United \r\nNations reform, making more efficient and effective \r\nuse of existing resources, making the “One United \r\nNations” policy work, and better utilizing regional \r\ncapacities to complement our global actions. \r\n Today, the world is evolving faster than ever. To \r\nmeet security, political, economic, social, \r\nenvironmental and other challenges we simply have to \r\nput our efforts, resources, and political determination \r\ntogether to deal with them and move the international \r\ndevelopment agenda forward. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Shin Kak-soo, Acting \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic \r\nof Korea. \r\n Mr. Shin Kak-soo (Republic of Korea): I would \r\nlike to begin by extending my warmest congratulations \r\nto you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency at the \r\nsixty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I have \r\nevery confidence that under your distinguished \r\nleadership this session will indeed yield fruitful results. \r\nMay I also take this opportunity to pay tribute to \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki moon. We deeply appreciate \r\nhis wholehearted commitment and selfless dedication \r\nto the noble and lofty goals of this august \r\nOrganization. \r\n Since their launch in 2000, we have made \r\nheadway towards achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). Yet progress varies \r\ngreatly across regions and countries and is uneven in \r\nterms of targets. Among other things, maternal and \r\nchild health warrants our special attention as the most \r\noff-track goal in most regions. Indeed, improving \r\nmaternal and child health is the best investment we can \r\nmake to carry momentum over to all other closely \r\nrelated goals. In view of the importance it attaches to \r\nthis goal, the Republic of Korea has joined the Group \r\nof 8 Muskoka Initiative for Maternal, Newborn and \r\nChild Health. Furthermore, Korea fully supports the \r\nSecretary-General’s pursuit of the Global Strategy for \r\nWomen’s and Children’s Health, and it welcomes the \r\nenthusiasm of all stakeholders for this important \r\ninitiative, as was demonstrated at this week’s meeting. \r\n With only five years remaining until 2015, the \r\nprospects for meeting the MDGs are not altogether \r\nencouraging. It is high time for the international \r\ncommunity to renew its resolve and galvanize global \r\nefforts to achieve these vast and meaningful goals. I \r\nearnestly hope that, when we gather again in 2013 to \r\nreview progress, we will find that implementation of \r\nthe commitments at the High-level Meeting held earlier \r\nthis week exceeds our most optimistic expectations. \r\n We must bear in mind that the success of the \r\nMDGs hinges on honouring development commitments \r\nand redoubling efforts to strengthen global partnership. \r\nIn full recognition of this, the Republic of Korea has \r\nembarked on a midterm plan to triple its official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) budget over the next \r\nfive years to 0.25 per cent of gross national income, \r\ndespite tight financial constraints. \r\n As a new Member of the Organization for \r\nEconomic Cooperation and Development Assistance \r\nCommittee, Korea is seeking to improve the quality of \r\nits development assistance by undertaking far-reaching \r\nreforms in its ODA system. Last year, basic laws on \r\nODA were enacted as the first step forward. Korea will \r\nalso align its development policy to reflect the actual \r\nneeds of the recipient countries and encourage their \r\ntaking ownership. With its unique experience of fast \r\neconomic and social development, Korea will do its \r\nutmost to play a bridging role between the donor and \r\nrecipient countries. \r\n Next year, Korea will host the Fourth High-Level \r\nForum on Aid Effectiveness in Busan. The Korean \r\n A/65/PV.17\r\n \r\n31 10-55109 \r\n \r\nGovernment will make every possible effort to ensure \r\nthat this forum serves to map out a new direction for \r\ninternational development cooperation that can address \r\nevolving global needs. \r\n It is indeed our common belief that development \r\ncooperation is an investment for all. A sustainable and \r\nbalanced world economy requires us to narrow down \r\nthe persistent development gap. This is the shared goal \r\nof the Group of 20 (G-20) and the United Nations. The \r\nG-20 leaders have agreed to place development as a \r\ncrucial new item on the agenda for the upcoming G-20 \r\nsummit in Seoul this November. The G-20 \r\ndevelopment agenda will concentrate on building \r\ncapacity to promote economic growth in the \r\ndeveloping world. In this way, the Group of 20 is \r\nexpected to complement the ongoing development \r\nagenda, including the MDGs. \r\n Global financial safety nets will be another new \r\nagenda item at the Seoul summit. Robust and reliable \r\nglobal financial safety nets are vital, especially for \r\ndeveloping countries, which are most vulnerable to \r\nvolatile global capital flows. The Seoul summit will \r\nfocus on faithful implementation of the previous \r\nagreements, which will help to bring back the stability \r\nof the global market at an early date. Leaders will \r\ncontinue to coordinate their policies for a strong, \r\nsustainable and balanced growth of the world economy. \r\nReforms of international financial institutions and \r\nfinancial regulations will also be central to the \r\ndiscussion at the G-20 summit. \r\n As the G-20 President this year, Korea is \r\ncommitted to ensuring a successful outcome for the \r\nsummit, one that will contribute to overcoming the \r\ncurrent crisis and to working out the post-crisis \r\nmanagement of the world economy. \r\n In discussing economic growth, particular \r\nemphasis must be placed on green growth. Indeed, this \r\nlies at the heart of sustainable development. In an \r\neffort to curb greenhouse gas emissions, Korea has set \r\na voluntary reduction target of 30 per cent against the \r\nbusiness-as-usual levels by 2020. Together, we will \r\ngradually shift the growth paradigm from an energy-\r\nintensive to a green growth economy. \r\n As part of the efforts to promote the green growth \r\nstrategy in the international community, we launched \r\nthe Global Green Growth Institute last June. We hope \r\nthat this institute will become an integral part of the \r\nglobal endeavour to move towards sustainable \r\ndevelopment as Korea strives to share green growth \r\nvision and assistance with developing countries. \r\n On the peace and security front, peacekeeping \r\noperations have become the most visible and defining \r\nfeature of the United Nations. The increasing demand \r\nand growing complexity of peacekeeping operations \r\ncall for continuous improvement in the operation of the \r\nmissions. \r\n Strategic goals should be set more clearly. The \r\ntroops should be deployed more swiftly. Operations \r\nshould be conducted in a more professional and \r\ndisciplined way. To this end, all stakeholders, including \r\ntroop-contributing countries and financial contributors, \r\nshould focus on close coordination and cooperation. \r\n The Republic of Korea has been a committed \r\ncontributor to United Nations peacekeeping efforts. \r\nKorea dispatched 240 contingent troops this year alone \r\nto the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti to \r\nhelp rebuild the country shaken by a tragic earthquake. \r\nCurrently, some 650 Korean soldiers are serving in \r\n11 peacekeeping missions, including the United \r\nNations Interim Force in Lebanon. We believe that our \r\nnewly enacted law on participation in peacekeeping \r\noperations will further enhance our response capacity \r\nin United Nations peacekeeping and peacebuilding \r\noperations. \r\n One of the most urgent security challenges today \r\nis the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and \r\ntheir means of delivery. It is imperative to further \r\nstrengthen international disarmament and \r\nnon-proliferation regimes built around the Nuclear \r\nNon-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). \r\n In this regard, Korea welcomes the adoption of \r\nthe Final Document at the 2010 NPT Review \r\nConference in May. We trust that this hard-won \r\nachievement will lay the groundwork for future \r\nprogress in nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. \r\n The nexus between weapons of mass destruction \r\nand terrorism also poses a grave risk to global security. \r\nWith this shared understanding, the leaders at the \r\nNuclear Security Summit held in Washington, D.C., \r\nlast April recognized the potentially catastrophic \r\nconsequences of nuclear terrorism and committed to \r\nstrengthening nuclear security. It was agreed that \r\nconcrete steps for securing nuclear materials should be \r\ntaken to prevent them from falling into the hands of \r\nterrorists. We look forward to follow-up discussions on \r\nA/65/PV.17  \r\n \r\n10-55109 32 \r\n \r\nnuclear security at the second Nuclear Security \r\nSummit, which is to be held in Korea in 2012. \r\n In August, President Lee Myung-bak of the \r\nRepublic of Korea proposed a new vision of the \r\npeaceful reunification of Korea, which will serve to \r\nstabilize inter-Korean relations and ultimately bring \r\nabout a reunified Korea. To make this vision reality, we \r\nwill work earnestly to build three communities: a peace \r\ncommunity to ensure security and peace on the Korean \r\npeninsula; an economic community to develop North \r\nKorea’s economy and eventually achieve inter-Korean \r\neconomic integration; and a community of the Korean \r\nnation which will ensure the dignity, freedom and \r\nhuman rights of all individuals. \r\n However, this vision for peaceful reunification is \r\nnot without obstacles. Sixty years after the outbreak of \r\nthe Korean War in 1950, there still remain threats to \r\npeace on the Korean peninsula. A case in point is the \r\nsinking of the Republic of Korea’s naval vessel, the \r\nCheonan, by a North Korean torpedo attack on \r\n26 March this year. The international community sent a \r\nfirm and unified message to North Korea by adopting \r\nthe Security Council presidential statement of 9 July. \r\nNorth Korea must take responsibility for its \r\nunprovoked attack and refrain from any further \r\nprovocations. \r\n The biggest obstacle in our path towards a peace \r\ncommunity is the resolution of the North Korean \r\nnuclear issue. Unless North Korea forgoes its nuclear \r\nweapons programme, no sustainable peace can be \r\nachieved on the Korean peninsula and beyond. \r\n Through the adoption of Security Council \r\nresolutions 1718 (2006) and 1874 (2009), the \r\ninternational community urged North Korea to abandon \r\nall nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programmes \r\nin a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner. In \r\norder to secure the lifting of sanctions and the ending \r\nof isolation, North Korea should make the strategic \r\ndecision to live up to its commitments to \r\ndenuclearization. A nuclear-free North Korea would \r\nalso open the way to saving its people from the current \r\nmiserable human rights and humanitarian situation. \r\n Last year, on this very occasion, President Lee \r\nproposed the “grand bargain” initiative: a single \r\ncomprehensive agreement that encompasses all steps \r\nfor North Korea’s denuclearization and the five parties’ \r\ncorresponding measures. Together with the \r\ninternational community, we will work tirelessly to \r\npersuade North Korea to make the right choice — a \r\nchoice that will ensure a better future for both its \r\ncountry and its people. Once North Korea demonstrates \r\ngenuine change in its behaviour and attitude, my \r\nGovernment is prepared to engage in meaningful \r\ndialogue and cooperation with North Korea. \r\n We are witnessing many global challenges that \r\nare testing the international community. These \r\nchallenges cannot be addressed by one country alone or \r\neven by a group of countries. They summon us as \r\nglobal citizens to fulfil a common purpose. They call \r\non the United Nations to assume the mantle of global \r\nleadership. In order to effectively address the \r\nincreasingly diverse and interconnected challenges, the \r\nUnited Nations should heighten its reform efforts \r\naimed at broadening its operational response capacity. \r\n The launch of UN Women is a clear testimony to \r\nthe world community’s efforts towards this end. Korea \r\ncommends that historic move to step up progress in \r\nmeeting the needs of women and girls worldwide. UN \r\nWomen will greatly contribute to enhancing system-\r\nwide coherence, bringing together resources and \r\nmandates for greater impact. We also welcome the \r\nrecent appointment of Michelle Bachelet at its helm. \r\n Furthermore, the upcoming review of the Human \r\nRights Council represents an excellent opportunity to \r\nmuster our collective efforts to make the Council more \r\neffective and efficient at fulfilling the promises we \r\nmade at its establishment. The Republic of Korea looks \r\nforward to working closely with the international \r\ncommunity in this joint effort. \r\n No reform of the United Nations can be complete \r\nwithout Security Council reform. It is crucial that the \r\nCouncil be more representative, effective and \r\naccountable. To this end, the Republic of Korea will \r\ncontinue to play a constructive role in finding the \r\nwidest possible agreement on the major issues relating \r\nto Council reform. \r\n The challenges facing the United Nations are \r\nformidable. We may succeed in some endeavours and \r\nnot in others, but we should not forget that the United \r\nNations is the best source of hope for many who are \r\nsuffering from armed conflicts, extreme poverty and \r\nhuman rights abuses across the globe. The Republic of \r\nKorea remains fully committed to playing its due part \r\nin the efforts of the United Nations to translate those \r\nhopes into reality. \r\n A/65/PV.17\r\n \r\n33 10-55109 \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): We have heard \r\nthe last speaker in the general debate for this meeting.  \r\n The representative of the Sudan has asked to \r\nspeak in exercise of the right of reply. \r\n I wish to remind him that statements made in \r\nexercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes \r\nfor the first intervention and five minutes for the \r\nsecond one and must be made by delegations from their \r\nseats. \r\n I now give the floor to the representative of the \r\nSudan. \r\n Mr. Elshareef (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): At this \r\nmorning’s meeting we heard the representative of the \r\nNetherlands express in his statement the refusal of his \r\nGovernment to accept that the President of my country, \r\nthe Sudan, be permitted to travel to his country. He \r\nsaid that: \r\n “it is unacceptable to the Dutch Government that \r\nsomeone like President Al-Bashir of the Sudan, \r\nagainst whom an arrest warrant is outstanding, \r\nshould be allowed to move freely in a country \r\nthat is an ICC partner”. (A/65/PV.16) \r\n I would like to tell the representative of the \r\nNetherlands that we are surprised by such a statement, \r\nwhich demonstrates an ignorance of the Rome Statute \r\nof the International Criminal Court, because my  \r\n \r\n \r\ncountry, the Sudan, is not a signatory of that Statute. It \r\nalso shows a blatant ignorance of a principle of \r\ninternational law known even to junior law students — \r\nI repeat, junior students of the law. I am referring to the \r\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which \r\nstipulates that a State that is not a party to a treaty is \r\nnot bound by that treaty’s provisions.  \r\n I wish to call attention in the same context to a \r\nresolution issued by the African Union following the \r\nvisit of the President of the Republic of the Sudan to \r\nKenya and Chad and its affirmation of the commitment \r\nof all States members of the African Union to the \r\ndecisions of the African Union in this matter. That \r\nstatement expressed appreciation of the courageous \r\nstands of Kenya and Chad and their commitment to the \r\ndecisions of the African Union. \r\n Furthermore, we tell the representative of the \r\nNetherlands that what he has said is unacceptable. It is \r\nan audacious interference in the internal affairs of our \r\ncountry, because it is the right of any country to host \r\nwhomever it wants to host. However, it seems that \r\nsome countries are still moved by memories of past \r\ncolonialism, the same heinous colonialism whereby \r\nsuch countries usurped the freedom and wealth of other \r\nnations and peoples. \r\n  The meeting rose at 6.30 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n"
