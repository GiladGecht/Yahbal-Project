I would like to welcome, once \r\nagain, all of our guests who have joined us today. We \r\nhave had two full days of rich discussions. \r\n I now give the floor to the Deputy Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Her Excellency Ms. Asha-Rose Migiro, who \r\nwill present a summary of the round tables and \r\ninteractive dialogue that took place over the past two \r\ndays. \r\n The Deputy Secretary-General: On behalf of \r\nthe Secretary-General, I am pleased to address the \r\nclosing plenary of this High-level Review Meeting on \r\nthe Mauritius Strategy. \r\n I congratulate all participants on the productive \r\nand thought-provoking discussions they held during the \r\nmulti-stakeholder round tables and interactive dialogue \r\nof the past two days. The discussions reflect the \r\nrenewed commitment of small island developing States \r\n(SIDS) to address their vulnerabilities and build \r\nresilience through sustainable development.  \r\n I also commend the international community for \r\nits continuing determination to support SIDS in this \r\nendeavour. I am very encouraged by the action-\r\noriented suggestions we have heard. It is now my \r\npleasure to provide a brief overview of the key issues \r\nthat were discussed during these past two days. \r\n The Review Meeting reaffirmed the need for the \r\ninternational community to continue to address and \r\nsupport the unique and particular vulnerabilities of \r\nSIDS, which were recognized at the Rio Earth Summit \r\nin 1992 and underscored in Barbados in 1994 and again \r\nin Mauritius five years ago. \r\n Substantial progress has been made in \r\nimplementing the Mauritius Strategy, which is directly \r\nlinked to achieving the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). However, renewed efforts are needed to live \r\nup to promises and commitments made in the recent \r\npast. Economic, environmental and social vulnerabilities \r\nhave further worsened in the past 10 years. As a result, \r\nthe economic development and progress of SIDS in \r\nachieving the MDGs are threatened by external shocks, \r\nincluding the adverse impacts of the global financial, \r\nA/65/PV.18  \r\n \r\n10-55116 2 \r\n \r\nfood and fuel crises. Climate change further exacerbates \r\nthese vulnerabilities, leaving the viability and very \r\nphysical existence of some SIDS at stake. \r\n SIDS have demonstrated strong political \r\ncommitment to continuing to do their part in building \r\nresilience to their special vulnerabilities. However, \r\nthere is a clear need to bridge gaps in implementation \r\nwith coordinated and sustainable support from the \r\ninternational community. \r\n Discussions during this High-level Review \r\nMeeting highlighted a number of priorities, including \r\ndefining measurable goals and indicators for monitoring \r\nand evaluation, and strengthening capacities for data \r\ncollection and analysis; scaling up resources made \r\navailable to SIDS, including for meeting new \r\nchallenges; enhancing strategic partnerships and \r\nmonitoring and coordination mechanisms, especially at \r\nthe regional level and within the United Nations system, \r\nthrough, for example, the United Nations Development \r\nAssistance Framework and the Commission on \r\nSustainable Development; strengthening South-South \r\ncooperation, including among SIDS; and placing a \r\nspecial focus on a number of sub-areas, including \r\nclimate change mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity, \r\nnatural disasters, sustainable energy, transport and trade, \r\nmarine and coastal resources, fisheries, tourism, finance \r\nand debt sustainability. \r\n Highly vulnerable SIDS face a number of \r\npractical challenges, and yet are often not eligible for \r\nspecial financing or other resources. In this respect, the \r\ndiscussion today highlighted the need to develop a \r\nSIDS vulnerability index. Middle-income SIDS face \r\nspecial challenges in the absence of international \r\nsupport measures commensurate with their high \r\nvulnerability. In this context, it was felt by many \r\ndiscussants that consideration should be given to \r\nexploring formal United Nations recognition of SIDS \r\nas a special category, to be tied to preferential \r\ntreatment and access to concessionary financing, debt \r\nrelief, trade, special programmes and development \r\nassistance, without prejudice to the needs of other \r\nvulnerable economies. \r\n The review also highlighted shortcomings in \r\ninstitutional support for SIDS and constraints to the \r\nimplementation of the Mauritius Strategy and the \r\nBarbados Programme of Action. A comprehensive \r\nreview of the Strategy and concrete recommendations \r\nfor action are needed. \r\n Participants have demonstrated their commitment \r\nto advancing the implementation of the Mauritius \r\nStrategy towards the sustainable development of SIDS. \r\nThey have agreed on key priorities for action and \r\nproposed suggestions on the way forward. \r\n The United Nations, in partnership with the \r\nmembers of the Inter-agency Consultative Group on \r\nSmall Island Developing States, which includes all \r\nUnited Nations agencies and other intergovernmental \r\nand regional organizations, is committed to providing \r\nstrong, coherent and coordinated support to these \r\nefforts. \r\n The issues facing SIDS are truly global issues \r\nthat affect us all. Let us work together to make small \r\nisland developing States a model for sustainable \r\ndevelopment with lessons and benefits for all. The \r\nSecretary-General and I look forward to seeing \r\nparticipants’ continuing commitment and leadership in \r\naction. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I thank the \r\nDeputy Secretary-General for her statement. \r\n The Assembly will now take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/65/L.2, entitled “Outcome document of the \r\nHigh-level Review Meeting on the implementation of \r\nthe Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation \r\nof the Programme of Action for the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States”. \r\n May I take it that the Assembly wishes to adopt \r\ndraft resolution A/65/L.2? \r\n Draft resolution A/65/L.2 was adopted (resolution \r\n65/2). \r\n The President (spoke in French): I am personally \r\nvery happy that this Meeting has enabled Member \r\nStates to reconfirm their political and financial \r\ncommitment to addressing the special vulnerabilities of \r\nthe small island developing States. The sustainable \r\ndevelopment of those States is inextricably linked to \r\nthe sustainable development of all Member States. We \r\nhave only one planet, and we must be united to \r\npreserve it and to live in harmony. It is my hope that, in \r\nthe months and years to come, States Members of \r\nUnited Nations will work together to this end. We will \r\nthus show that we all share a common vision of a \r\nworld where the well-being of each and every one of us \r\ndepends on the well-being of all.  \r\n A/65/PV.18\r\n \r\n3 10-55116 \r\n \r\n I would like to express sincere appreciation to \r\nMs. Sylvie Lucas, Permanent Representative of \r\nLuxembourg, and Mr. Vanu Gopala Menon, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Singapore, who effectively and \r\npatiently conducted the discussions and complex \r\nnegotiations in the consultations on resolution 65/2. I \r\nalso thank all Member States for their valuable \r\ncontributions, without which the outcome document \r\ncould not have been successfully completed. \r\n I now declare closed the High-level Review \r\nMeeting on the implementation of the Mauritius \r\nStrategy for the Further Implementation of the \r\nProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development \r\nof Small Island Developing States. \r\n The Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of sub-item (b) of agenda item 20. \r\n The meeting rose at 6.40 p.m. \r\n"
