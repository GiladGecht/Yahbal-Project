(Switzerland) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 9 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Lenín Moreno Garcés, \r\nVice-President of the Republic of Ecuador \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Ecuador. \r\n Mr. Lenín Moreno Garcés, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Ecuador, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I have great \r\npleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Lenín \r\nMoreno Garcés, Vice-President of the Republic of \r\nEcuador, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Mr. Moreno Garcés (Ecuador) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): I would like to commend the election of His \r\nExcellency Mr. Joseph Deiss as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fifth session and to \r\nwelcome his excellent proposal for the main subject of \r\nthe general debate, “Reaffirming the central role of the \r\nUnited Nations in global governance”. This is also part \r\nof Ecuador’s policy of strengthening multilateralism. \r\nTo that end, we have continuously encouraged regional \r\nintegration as the logical response to an ancestral \r\nheritage that never kept or defended borders between \r\nfriendly countries. \r\n The wish for a united South America came to \r\nfruition with the establishment of the Union of South \r\nAmerican Nations (UNASUR) as an area for genuine \r\nintegration aimed, inter alia, at eliminating inequality \r\nand strengthening democracy. On 26 November, \r\nEcuador will hand over the pro tempore presidency, \r\nwhich it has held since August of 2009, to our sister \r\ncountry of Guyana. In the same vein, Ecuador has \r\nfostered South-South cooperation as a mechanism for \r\ndevelopment, encouraging cooperation among the \r\nlegitimate representatives of States parties. We believe \r\nthat countries must be heard and their requirements and \r\nrealities addressed, and that cooperation should be a \r\nreality over the medium term. \r\n I should stress that one of the most important \r\nendeavours developed within this space was the \r\nsolidarity extended to the sister country of Haiti and its \r\nlegitimate Government for its reconstruction, to attain \r\nthe development it yearns for and to strengthen its \r\ninstitutions as it deserves. \r\n I wish to place special emphasis on the \r\nimportance we accord to the issue of climate change. \r\nEcuador is one of world’s 19 megadiverse countries. Its \r\nAmazon forest boasts the Yasuní Park, declared by \r\nUNESCO as a world biosphere reserve in 1989. \r\nScientists agree on the unique value of this park, for its \r\nextraordinary biodiversity and state of conservation \r\nand for the cultural heritage it holds. The park \r\nconcentrates Amazonia’s highest densities of \r\namphibian, mammal, bird and plant species. Yasuní is \r\nalso a Pleistocene reserve. There, species were not \r\nA/65/PV.19  \r\n \r\n10-55122 2 \r\n \r\naffected by glaciation, which preserved a process of \r\ndifferentiated evolution of new species. Moreover, the \r\nYasuní National Park is the home of two indigenous \r\npeoples that have opted to live in voluntary isolation \r\nwith respect to Western culture: the Tagaeri and the \r\nTaromenane. Both belong to the Huaorani culture, \r\npossessing age-old wisdom and cultural heritage. \r\n The wealth of the park also extends underground. \r\nIn Yasuní there are oil resources from which Ecuador \r\ncould obtain 846 million barrels of heavy crude. Three \r\nyears ago, the President of Ecuador, the economist \r\nRafael Correa, launched the Yasuní-ITT Initiative \r\nbefore this forum (see A/62/PV.7), which proposed \r\nkeeping that oil underground, unexploited. If we fulfil \r\nthis aspiration, we will prevent the emission of \r\n407 million tons of carbon, the main cause of climate \r\nchange, and we will leave intact the planet’s richest \r\nworld biosphere reserve. To do this, we need to raise \r\nglobal awareness and gain the relevant international \r\ncontribution, equivalent to at least half of the total \r\nrevenue of $3.6 billion that the State of Ecuador would \r\nearn if it were to exploit the oil reserves. \r\n Ecuador is a country that is making major efforts \r\nto achieve development. But, as an act of generosity, \r\nthe people of Ecuador have decided not to receive \r\n50 per cent of the income that this oil would generate, \r\nso long as the international community makes the same \r\neffort. \r\n The Yasuní Initiative, as President Correa himself \r\nhas said, is not just symbolic. It is the most important \r\ninitiative for our country and for the entire planet. It \r\nwould protect one of the areas richest in biodiversity — \r\nperhaps the richest in the world — and there is no \r\ndoubt that it would contribute to mitigating climate \r\nchange. The world will be able to assess the way of life \r\nof Amazon peoples, in particular that of the most \r\nvulnerable among them: the indigenous peoples in \r\nvoluntary isolation. \r\n We have already created a capital fund \r\nadministered by the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme with the participation of the Ecuadorian \r\nState, our civil society, and representatives of our \r\nfellow contributing countries. \r\n I call upon our brother countries throughout the \r\nworld, especially the industrialized countries, to \r\nsupport the Yasuní Initiative and, acknowledging the \r\nresponsibility we all share for climate change, to seek \r\noriginal solutions to a problem that threatens the very \r\nsurvival of the human species. Ancestral Amerindian \r\nwisdom teaches us that the Earth was not inherited \r\nfrom our parents; rather, this magical creation is lent to \r\nus by our children. \r\n Ecuador has reached its targets related to the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, and it continues to \r\npromote them, including by setting an example for the \r\ninternational community. However, I wish to state very \r\nfirmly that the Millennium Development Goals left out \r\na very significant segment of the population and that, \r\nsoon, they will reveal deficiencies in the social policies \r\nof countries. I am speaking here of the excluded among \r\nthe excluded, the forgotten among the forgotten. I am \r\nreferring to people with disabilities. \r\n Let us be clear: disability is not incapacity, but \r\nrather diversity. As there is geographical, cultural or \r\nbioclimatic diversity, there are also diverse capacities, \r\nand that is where talent, heart, dedication, perseverance \r\nand willingness lie. Ecuador has undertaken a \r\nbio-psychosocial, clinical and genetic study of all \r\npersons with disabilities in the country. We never in \r\nour wildest dreams imagined what we would find in \r\nthat study: human beings left in holes in the ground, in \r\ncages, with silence as their only company and death as \r\ntheir only hope, human beings ashamed and shaming \r\nothers. \r\n That situation no longer exists in Ecuador. \r\nAlthough much remains to be done, we have already \r\naccomplished much. As of now, we can locate via \r\nsatellite every person with disabilities in Ecuador who \r\nneeds help and provide them with the technical \r\nassistance they need, accessible and dignified housing, \r\nmedical care, rehabilitation and integration in the \r\nworkforce and the education system. In addition, we \r\nhave created a subsidy, equivalent to a minimal living \r\nwage, to acknowledge the work and the dedication of \r\nthose who care for persons with severe physical or \r\nmental disabilities. \r\n The expertise of the sister Republic of Cuba \r\nplayed a significant role in the execution of this \r\ndetailed study. Cuba is perhaps the country that shows \r\nthe greatest solidarity in Latin America because, when \r\nthe time to help comes, they do not take into account \r\nthe fact that they still suffer under the most infamous, \r\nillegal and illegitimate blockade in human memory, \r\nand which Ecuador condemns with all the energy of a \r\ngrateful people. \r\n A/65/PV.19\r\n \r\n3 10-55122 \r\n \r\n I must highlight the inescapable urgency of \r\naddressing the subject of human migration. Allow me \r\nto make an appeal to all countries, especially \r\ndeveloped ones, to sign the International Convention \r\non the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers \r\nand Members of Their Families, which was opened for \r\nsignature 20 years ago: 20 years ago. What, I ask \r\nmyself, are we not one single race? Have we not \r\nsimilar problems? \r\n I also ask myself: do we not share the same \r\nevolution? Do we not have the same hopes for the \r\nfuture? Let us share the realization of the dream of \r\nuniversal citizenship. Let human beings travel \r\nwherever they want, whenever they want, as they do \r\nwhen they are at home and among family, and as \r\nshould be the case around the world. \r\n I want to reiterate the Ecuadorian position \r\ncondemning all forms of colonialism and occupation of \r\nterritories by foreign forces. We reaffirm that dialogue \r\nmust always be the mechanism of choice for the \r\nsettlement of conflicts. \r\n We believe in the sovereign right of all countries \r\nto development and to the peaceful use of nuclear \r\nenergy. We want a world without nuclear weapons. We \r\ntherefore recommend preaching by example. I will \r\nrepeat that: we want a world without nuclear weapons, \r\nbut our approach is to preach by example, so that that \r\nwhich we demand from others also becomes first and \r\nforemost a requirement for ourselves. I call for a \r\ndefinitive decision. Let us dismantle nuclear arsenals, \r\nso that just as we criminalize the manufacturing and \r\nmarketing of illegal drugs, we would also criminalize \r\nthe manufacturing and marketing of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction — and if only that could be done for all \r\nweapons. \r\n There can be no world governance without peace. \r\nNature is the best teacher of peace. I was born in the \r\nEcuadorian Amazon basin. We call Earth our Pacha \r\nMama. She and we are the same. The travelling poet \r\nWalt Whitman said, referring to all human beings, to \r\nall other beings on Earth and to the Earth itself, “every \r\natom belonging to me as good belongs to you” (Song of \r\nMyself). We are made of the same atoms, which we \r\nshare. We come from dust, we whirl around for some \r\ntime and then we return to dust, to our Pacha Mama, to \r\nMother Nature. But she has been abused and \r\ndisrespected. Even so, in her agony, she is still \r\ngenerous. Rabindranath Tagore said that the Earth has \r\nbeen insulted and reviled, but in return offers her \r\nflowers and her fruits. \r\n I call on Member States, our brother countries, to \r\nshare this revolutionary vision, to find peace and to \r\nmake it everlasting, to change the history of the \r\ninvaded, the polluted, the humiliated and the forgotten \r\nof the Earth. \r\n Let us create an army of warriors that carry no \r\nweapons on their shoulders or ammunition in their \r\npacks, but whose weapons are ecology, medicine, the \r\ndefence of human rights and human solidarity, an army \r\nthat fights the only disability that truly exists, which is \r\nthe human disability. The only disability that exists is \r\nthat of the heart. The enemy is inequality, which, \r\nalthough fierce, will be defeated. We will succeed, of \r\ncourse. Of course we will succeed. \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the Vice-\r\nPresident of the Republic of Ecuador for the statement \r\nhe has just made. \r\n Mr. Lenín Moreno Garcés, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Ecuador, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Lieutenant-General Mompati \r\nMerafhe, Vice-President of the Republic  \r\nof Botswana \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Botswana. \r\n Lieutenant-General Mompati Merafhe, Vice-\r\nPresident of the Republic of Botswana, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I have great \r\npleasure in welcoming His Excellency Lieutenant-\r\nGeneral Mompati Merafhe, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Botswana, and inviting him to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n Mr. Merafhe (Botswana): It is my singular \r\nhonour to extend my congratulations to you, Sir, on \r\nyour assumption of the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly. I wish to assure you of the full support and \r\ncooperation of my delegation in the discharge of your \r\nonerous responsibilities. My commendation also goes \r\nto the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, and his \r\nA/65/PV.19  \r\n \r\n10-55122 4 \r\n \r\nstaff for their commitment to the advancement of the \r\nwork of this noble Organization. \r\n As Member States, we continue to find refuge in \r\nthe provisions of the United Nations Charter and the \r\nfull assurance that, when we are individually faced \r\nwith insurmountable challenges and difficulties, we \r\ndraw from the collective strength of the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n Working together for a common purpose, for the \r\ncommon good is actually the sacredness of this, our \r\ngrand institution. In this regard, we must all remain \r\nsteadfast in our partnership on the agenda for poverty \r\neradication, the pursuit of international peace and \r\nsecurity, the combating of disease, the promotion of \r\nyouth empowerment and gender equality, the \r\npromotion and protection of democracy, the rule of law \r\nand human rights, personal advancement through \r\neducation, better health for all and harnessing \r\ntechnology for sustainable development. It is on \r\naccount of this abiding faith and belief in the viability \r\nand primacy of the United Nations that, in spite of our \r\nresource limitations, we have over the years faithfully \r\nfulfilled our obligations to this Organization. \r\n The deliberations of the recently concluded High-\r\nlevel Plenary Meeting on the review of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), our global blueprint for \r\nmonitoring universal progress towards shared \r\ndevelopment goals, clearly cast light on our strengths, \r\nweaknesses and vulnerabilities, individually and \r\ncollectively. For this reason we need to redouble our \r\nefforts to accelerate the implementation of the MDGs \r\nin the remaining five years. \r\n Botswana is classified as an upper-middle-income \r\ncountry. However, despite having enjoyed stability and \r\nsteady economic growth over a sustained period of \r\ntime, the country still has to contend with a plethora of \r\ndevelopment challenges — ironically, in an \r\nenvironment of diminished international development \r\nassistance and support. The vulnerability of economies \r\nsuch as that of my country became evident during the \r\ntriple global crises of food, energy and, most recently, \r\nthe world economic and financial meltdown. To this \r\nend, we call for continued development assistance for \r\nmiddle-income countries, lest their hard-earned gains \r\nbe reversed. \r\n In this era of growing and complex global \r\nchallenges, the need for a more dynamic and proactive \r\nglobal financial, economic and political architecture is \r\nfar more apparent than ever before. More specifically, \r\nthe recent crises point to an international monetary and \r\nfinancial architecture that needs profound reform in \r\norder to enhance its early-warning capabilities and \r\nresistance to external shocks, as well as to facilitate the \r\nintegration of poorer countries into the global \r\neconomy. \r\n Botswana welcomes the important milestones \r\nachieved in strengthening United Nations operational \r\nactivities for development and improvements in \r\nfunding for development-related activities, as well as \r\nin strengthening the institutional framework for the \r\ngender architecture through the creation of the United \r\nNations Entity for Gender Equality and the \r\nEmpowerment of Women — UN Women. The creation \r\nof the Entity constitutes an important step in fulfilling \r\nthe commitments undertaken at the 1995 Beijing World \r\nConference on Women, whose main objective was the \r\npromotion of gender equality and the empowerment of \r\nwomen. \r\n Botswana fully supports the strengthening of the \r\ninstitutional capacity of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission. We believe that the role of the \r\nCommission should be properly defined by a robust \r\nmandate, through the amendment of the founding \r\nresolutions and the provision of adequate resources in \r\norder to enable it to effectively discharge its mandate. \r\n On a related subject, we fully concur that \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation are essential for the \r\npromotion of international peace and security. To this \r\nend, my delegation welcomes the progress made in \r\nsome areas but remains deeply concerned that the \r\nConference on Disarmament continues to be \r\ndeadlocked. \r\n I wish to seize this opportunity to reaffirm \r\nBotswana’s commitment to the objectives of the Treaty \r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which \r\nwe continue to demonstrate through effective \r\nimplementation of its provisions as well as compliance \r\nwith the decisions of the successive Review \r\nConferences. Consequently, Botswana associates itself \r\nwith the outcome of the 2010 Review Conference of \r\nthe States Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons. We fully support the call by \r\ndeveloping countries for the peaceful use of nuclear \r\ntechnology in areas such as agriculture, the \r\nenvironment, water management and medicine. \r\nHowever, countries that intend to embark on such use \r\n A/65/PV.19\r\n \r\n5 10-55122 \r\n \r\nof nuclear technology should do so in a transparent \r\nfashion and in full cooperation with the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA). We therefore call for \r\nincreased financial support for the IAEA Technical \r\nCooperation Programme as well as for the Agency’s \r\ncapacity-building, in order to share technology \r\nutilization in the relevant areas. \r\n Botswana continues to be deeply concerned about \r\nincreasing threats to international peace and security. \r\nAs a peace-loving nation, we believe in the peaceful \r\nresolution of conflicts. It is because of this strong \r\nbelief that we condemn, without reservation, all acts of \r\nterrorism, including the 9/11 terrorist attacks, on which \r\nour well-known position remains unchanged. My \r\ndelegation does not believe that the 9/11 attack was \r\norchestrated by the United States of America. \r\n One issue of deep concern to my delegation is the \r\nerosion of democracy, respect for human rights and the \r\nrule of law in some parts of the world. There is \r\ntherefore an urgent need for us to reverse this trend, \r\nespecially because it undermines all the efforts we \r\nhave made to date to launch our countries on a path of \r\npeace, stability and sustainable development. To this \r\nend, we commend the various civil society \r\norganizations that have consistently sounded alarm \r\nbells regarding incidents of human rights violations \r\nwhenever and wherever they occur. \r\n My country is of the view that the International \r\nCriminal Court needs to be supported in its efforts to \r\nresolve outstanding cases of arrest warrants that have \r\nbeen issued against persons indicted for the \r\ncommission of serious crimes. It is in this context that \r\nBotswana remains resolute and steadfast in its support \r\nfor the work of the International Criminal Court. We \r\nwelcome the landmark decision of the Rome Statute \r\nReview Conference held recently in Kampala, Uganda, \r\nto extend the jurisdiction of the Court to cover the \r\ncrime of aggression. \r\n Nowhere is our shared responsibility as members \r\nof the international community more critical than in \r\nprotecting and nurturing our shared environment and \r\nour planet, Earth. To this end, it is pertinent to point \r\nout that climate change has increasingly become one of \r\nhumanity’s most daunting challenges. The devastating \r\nnatural disasters recently experienced in certain \r\nquarters of our globe amply demonstrate our \r\nvulnerability as inhabitants of the Earth. \r\n I wish to seize this opportunity, on behalf of the \r\nGovernment and the people of Botswana, and indeed \r\non my own account, to express our sympathy and \r\nsolidarity with all the countries that have been victims \r\nof such disasters. We would like to extend our \r\ncondolences to all the families who lost their loved \r\nones and those whose property and livelihoods were \r\ndestroyed. We extend our profound appreciation to the \r\nGovernments as well as private sector and civil society \r\norganizations that responded positively to the \r\ninternational humanitarian appeal launched by the \r\nUnited Nations on behalf of the affected countries. In \r\nparticular, we would like to recognize the countries \r\nthat led humanitarian interventions. We remain \r\noptimistic that the next Conference of Parties to the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange will achieve a successful outcome, one that \r\nfully addresses the interests and concerns of both \r\ndeveloping and developed countries. \r\n In conclusion, we pray that this sixty-fifth session \r\nof the General Assembly will go down in history as \r\nmarking a milestone in efforts aimed at addressing the \r\nmost pressing global challenges of our time, as well as \r\nbringing hope and inspiration to the billions in despair \r\nthroughout the world. \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the Vice-\r\nPresident of the Republic of Botswana for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n Lieutenant-General Mompati Merafhe, Vice-\r\nPresident of the Republic of Botswana, was \r\nescorted form the rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Mohamed Waheed, Vice-\r\nPresident of the Republic of Maldives \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Maldives. \r\n Mr. Mohamed Waheed, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Maldives, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I have great \r\npleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Mohamed \r\nWaheed, Vice-President of the Republic of Maldives, \r\nand inviting him to address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Waheed (Maldives): I would first like to \r\ncongratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to \r\nA/65/PV.19  \r\n \r\n10-55122 6 \r\n \r\npreside over the sixty-fifth session of the General \r\nAssembly. Please be assured of my delegation’s full \r\nsupport and cooperation. I would also like to take this \r\nopportunity to offer our appreciation to both your \r\npredecessor, Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, for the \r\nexemplary manner in which he guided the work of the \r\nsixty-fourth session, and to Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon for his leadership of the United Nations over \r\nthe past four years. \r\n Last week, I had the opportunity to report on the \r\nMaldives’ progress towards attainment of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). My report \r\ndemonstrated that while we have achieved five of the \r\neight MDGs — namely, Goals 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 — \r\nseveral others remain challenges, and some \r\nachievements are increasingly becoming threatened. \r\nFor example, the Maldives has made great strides in \r\neliminating poverty, in education and in improving \r\nmortality rates among mothers and infants. However, \r\nwe have yet to make significant gains in the area of the \r\nempowerment of women. We are also still struggling to \r\nprovide for our environmental and development needs. \r\nMoreover, religious extremism runs counter to notions \r\nof equality and social justice and endangers our \r\nachievements in gender parity. All the while, \r\nenvironmental and economic vulnerabilities threaten to \r\ndiminish our gains. \r\n Those gains, among others, have improved the \r\nlives of the Maldivian people and contributed to a \r\nsituation that has led to our imminent graduation from \r\nthe United Nations list of least developed countries \r\n(LDCs) this year. While we look forward to our \r\ngraduation, we are also concerned about the sudden \r\nwithdrawal of some of the benefits afforded to LDCs \r\nthat have helped sustain our development efforts for \r\nthe past four decades. Those include preferential \r\nmarket access and concessionary financing. While we \r\nwere very encouraged by the pledges made by our \r\npartners at the donors conference held in the Maldives \r\nin March this year to invest in urgent development \r\nprojects, we anxiously await the speedy disbursement \r\nof the promised aid. \r\n Furthermore, we look forward to working with \r\nour development partners to achieve consensus on a \r\ntransitional model that provides for a gradual reduction \r\nof benefits to avoid the disruption of our development \r\nefforts, as stipulated in resolution 59/209. As a country \r\non the verge of LDC graduation, we look forward to \r\nadopting a development strategy that places emphasis \r\non greater independence and economic stability \r\nthrough private investment and public-private \r\npartnerships. Our Government’s policies on \r\nprivatization and our employment of commercial \r\ndiplomacy are designed to achieve this transition. \r\nHowever, like many other small island States, our \r\ngeopolitical and socio-economic circumstances will \r\ncontinue to render the Maldives vulnerable. \r\n The impact of the recent global recession clearly \r\ndemonstrates those vulnerabilities. As a country \r\nprimarily dependent on tourism and fishing, the \r\nMaldives was severely affected by decreases in \r\nconsumption in our traditional markets. As a result, the \r\nGovernment was compelled to implement severe \r\nausterity measures that cut public spending and \r\nundertook massive economic reforms. Nevertheless, \r\nour people continue to face formidable development \r\nchallenges, and thus the Maldives will continue to push \r\nfor greater recognition within the United Nations for \r\nthe plight of small island developing States. \r\n The economic transition in the Maldives \r\ncomplements an ambitious political transition from \r\nautocracy to democracy. Although this is a daunting \r\ntask, we have been successful in achieving important \r\nmilestones over the course of these past two years. In \r\nfact, the two-year period of transition stipulated in our \r\nnew Constitution concluded in August. This process \r\nresulted in the establishment of our Supreme Court and \r\nthe creation of other relevant institutions. While our \r\ntransition process was accompanied by some political \r\ndiscord, it was largely peaceful. \r\n Our friends in the international community \r\nhelped us find peaceful solutions during this somewhat \r\ntumultuous period in our politics. I would like to thank \r\nall members of the international community for their \r\ncontinued engagement and assistance, and especially \r\nPresident Mahinda Rajapaksa of Sri Lanka for his \r\nconstructive contributions. \r\n The Maldives’ transition to democracy has been \r\naccompanied by our evolution from an abuser of \r\nhuman rights to a staunch advocate for them. We are \r\nproud of what we have achieved, but are the first to \r\nrecognize that there is no shortage of challenges that \r\nrequire our immediate attention. These include the \r\nneed to abrogate the use of torture, the need to \r\nsafeguard the rights of women, children and the \r\ndisabled, and the need to improve our capacity to deal \r\nwith human trafficking in our region.  \r\n A/65/PV.19\r\n \r\n7 10-55122 \r\n \r\n The Maldives is proud to have been elected to the \r\nHuman Rights Council in May, and we are cognizant of \r\nthe trust and responsibility conferred upon us by the \r\noverwhelming support demonstrated by United Nations \r\nMembers across all regions. We will continue to \r\nuphold our pledge to use our membership to promote \r\nhuman rights through positive engagement and to \r\naddress sensitivities in our collective quest to protect \r\nthe most vulnerable. Moreover, the Maldives is \r\nundergoing its own universal periodic review this year, \r\nand we consider this exercise to be an opportunity to \r\nfurther strengthen human rights protections at home. \r\n While our interest in human rights is rooted in \r\nour ambition to improve the lives of our own citizens, \r\nit also emerges from our rising concerns about life in \r\nour now interconnected global village, where the need \r\nto compel tolerance, understanding and respect for \r\nhuman dignity is greater than ever before. We support \r\nthe initiatives for a culture of peace, dialogue among \r\ncivilizations and tolerance among different faiths. \r\n As a Muslim country, we lament the rising tide of \r\nIslamophobia in non-Muslim States. The people of the \r\nMaldives certainly appreciate the difference between \r\nGovernment-sanctioned incidents and those anti-Muslim \r\nactivities that can be attributed to marginal segments of \r\nnon-Muslim societies. However, we believe that \r\nreligious intolerance, negative stereotyping, racial \r\nprofiling and discrimination thwart this institution’s \r\nmission for peace and prosperity among all societies. \r\nTherefore, we must intensify our efforts to promote a \r\nculture of tolerance and understanding while pursuing an \r\neffective dialogue to expand the scope of rational \r\ndiscourse between the Islamic world and other \r\ncivilizations. \r\n Some of the gravest threats facing humankind \r\ntoday do not occupy their rightful places in the \r\nheadlines, nor do they gain the significant attention \r\nthey require. We believe that climate change is such a \r\nthreat. For the Maldives, the effects of global warming \r\npose an overwhelming threat to our infrastructure, our \r\neconomy and our very existence. \r\n In an attempt to implement adaptation measures, \r\nthe Maldives has invested in water and sanitation \r\nprojects and coastal defences and is attempting to \r\ndevelop voluntary resettlement programmes to more \r\nviable islands within the country. We are also investing \r\nin a low-carbon future that emphasizes renewable \r\nenergy and other green projects to achieve our goal of \r\nbecoming carbon neutral by 2020. \r\n It is obvious that our actions alone cannot save \r\nus. The global community must act. Regional \r\ninitiatives that complement United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) processes \r\nmust be pursued. Weeks before Copenhagen, the \r\nMaldives convened a group of countries and formed \r\nthe Climate Vulnerable Forum to declare our concerns \r\nwith a united voice. I am pleased to report today that \r\nKiribati will take over the leadership of this group \r\nahead of the sixteenth session of the Conference of the \r\nParties to the UNFCCC in Cancún this year, and that \r\nBangladesh will steer it to the seventeenth session in \r\nSouth Africa next year. \r\n The Asian region is one of the most vulnerable to \r\nclimate change. We recognize that failure to extend \r\nemissions targets beyond 2012 will leave 60 per cent of \r\nthe world’s population without durable solutions for \r\nthe global warming effects already being felt. Threats \r\nto food and water security for the world’s most \r\nsusceptible populations will undoubtedly perpetuate \r\ndisease, exacerbate conflicts and threaten to erode \r\ndecades of hard-won successes achieved by countries \r\nthroughout the region. \r\n While we have high hopes for the ensuing \r\nsixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth sessions of the \r\nConference, we believe that alternative solutions that \r\nharmonize the development needs of industrial States \r\nwith the human and economic rights of vulnerable \r\npeoples should exist. Therefore, the people of the \r\nMaldives and Timor-Leste call for an Asian initiative \r\nthat would forge a consortium of Asian countries and \r\nregional partnerships. This will aim to enable our \r\nregion to aid the world’s most vulnerable States. \r\n The Maldives believes that it is time to let go of \r\nthe mistrust and blame that has plagued the UNFCCC \r\nprocess. We welcome the recent voluntary initiative of \r\nIndia to curb its emissions and its commitment to \r\npromoting green energy without waiting for others to \r\nfollow suit. We call upon all nations large and small to \r\ncome together in a cooperative spirit in Cancún so that \r\nwe may effectively establish and promote mitigation \r\nactivities that will restore our native carbon sinks, \r\nincrease energy efficiency, reduce emissions and \r\npreserve our ecosystems. \r\n The Maldives would also like to state its support \r\nof the Group of Four position for reform of the \r\nA/65/PV.19  \r\n \r\n10-55122 8 \r\n \r\nSecurity Council. We believe that an expansion of \r\npermanent membership to reflect the realities of our \r\ncontemporary international system will improve \r\nrepresentation in the Council and better serve to \r\naddress a panoply of concerns facing nations in all five \r\nregions today. \r\n The Maldives also continues to grapple with \r\ntraditional security threats. The scourge of terrorism \r\nand the growing menace of piracy threaten national, \r\neconomic and maritime security throughout our region \r\nand around the world. Yet deficits in the capacity to \r\nattribute criminal accountability to the perpetrators of \r\nterrorism persist. Our failure is marked by the advances \r\nin the modus operandi of terrorists, the proliferation of \r\nillegal technology transfer, and the surge in the trade of \r\nillicit weapons. The Maldives cannot stress enough the \r\nimportance of this Assembly’s finalizing the draft \r\nconvention on terrorism. \r\n Our geographical location in the Indian Ocean \r\nmakes the Maldives particularly vulnerable to threats \r\nto its maritime security, as our vast open waters \r\ncontinue to prove difficult to police. We are deeply \r\nconcerned over the surge in piracy that has moved \r\nbeyond the Gulf of Aden into the Indian Ocean. If the \r\ninternational community does not increase its efforts, \r\nwe fear that piracy may end up turning into an \r\nuncontrolled threat to security in the region. Thus, we \r\nwere particularly encouraged by the adoption of \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1897 (2009) and are \r\npleased with the work of the Contact Group on Piracy \r\noff the Coast of Somalia. We feel, however, that it is \r\nimportant for the Group to urgently establish an easily \r\naccessible legal toolkit for States that enables them to \r\nfill the vacuums in their national legal systems and \r\naddress piracy in a comprehensive manner. \r\n The continued suffering of the Palestinian people \r\ndeeply saddens the Maldives. They have been denied \r\ntheir right to self-determination and their right to live \r\nin peace and freedom in their own independent State \r\nfor far too long. While recognizing the rights of the \r\nPalestinians, we also appreciate and support the right \r\nof the people of Israel to live in peace and security \r\nalongside an independent and sovereign State of \r\nPalestine. We continue our call for all sides to use the \r\nongoing peace talks as an opportunity to resolve their \r\ndifferences, and are therefore heartened by the new \r\ninitiatives being pursued by the United States in its \r\npursuit of a Middle East peace treaty. Furthermore, we \r\ncall for continued support for the Governments of \r\nJordan and Egypt in their work on the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative, which we believe may provide an enduring \r\nsolution to the conflict for the people of the region. \r\n Additionally, our pursuit of a more secure and \r\njust world and our respect for international law were \r\nthe basis of the Maldives’ recognition of the \r\nindependence of Kosovo, declared on 17 February \r\n2008. The Maldives believes that the declaration of \r\nindependence by the people of Kosovo reflects a last-\r\nresort remedy that embodies the best prospects for \r\npeace and stability in the region. The Maldives also \r\nwelcomes the advisory opinion of the International \r\nCourt of Justice on the unilateral declaration of \r\nindependence in respect of Kosovo, issued on 22 July \r\n2010, which concluded that that declaration of the \r\nindependence of Kosovo did not violate international \r\nlaw. While we have been disappointed by recent efforts \r\nto reverse this judgment, the Maldives welcomes the \r\nalternative solution, contained in the unanimously \r\nadopted European Union-sponsored resolution 64/298, \r\nas a positive step towards Kosovo’s assumption of full \r\nUnited Nations membership. \r\n Closer to home, the Maldives has borne witness \r\nto advances in democracy, sustainable development, \r\nand peacebuilding throughout the region of the South \r\nAsian Association for Regional Cooperation. Notably, \r\nwe praise the progress made by the Islamic Republic of \r\nAfghanistan, including the development of democratic \r\ninstitutions, as well as improvements in the areas of \r\nhealth, education and the status of women. We wish the \r\nAfghans continued success in their efforts to rebuild \r\ntheir long-suffering nation, and implore the \r\ninternational community to maintain their support of \r\nthe Afghan people. \r\n Furthermore, the Maldives welcomes Sri Lanka’s \r\nsuccess in its ongoing consolidation of peace and \r\ndemocracy, and we call upon the international \r\ncommunity to support that country in its reconciliation \r\nefforts, as well as in its efforts to rebuild a nation torn \r\napart by 25 years of sustained conflict. \r\n We are a small nation with big dreams. Our \r\ndreams are rooted in the vision of the Charter that \r\nbinds the membership of this Assembly together here \r\ntoday. Our hopes are inextricably linked to the fears of \r\nthe past that inspired this body and to the hopes of \r\nthose who dream of a future grounded in justice, \r\nequity, opportunity and peace for peoples of the North \r\nand South, in nations large and small. Our humanity \r\n A/65/PV.19\r\n \r\n9 10-55122 \r\n \r\ndefines our obstacles, but we believe that our dreams \r\nfor a better future defy our limitations. \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the Vice-\r\nPresident of the Republic of Maldives for the statement \r\nhe has just made. \r\n Mr. Mohamed Waheed, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Maldives, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Mizengo Pinda, Prime Minister \r\nof the United Republic of Tanzania \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the Prime Minister of the \r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania. \r\n Mr. Mizengo Pinda, Prime Minister of the United \r\nRepublic of Tanzania, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I have great \r\npleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Mizengo \r\nPinda, Prime Minister of the United Republic of \r\nTanzania, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Mr. Pinda (United Republic of Tanzania): Let me \r\nbegin by congratulating you, Sir, on your well-deserved \r\nelection to preside over the sixty-fifth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. I assure you of Tanzania’s full \r\nsupport and cooperation. I also thank and congratulate \r\nyour predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Abdussalam Treki, \r\nfor his leadership and accomplishments. \r\n Having just concluded a successful summit on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), I would like \r\nto congratulate the Secretary-General, His Excellency \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon, for his leadership, dedication and \r\ncommitment to the work of the Organization and for \r\nthe new momentum that he is bringing towards the \r\nachievement of the MDGs. Once again, we welcome \r\nhis Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s Health \r\nand urge the international community to render the \r\nnecessary support for its implementation. \r\n We emphasize the importance of national \r\nleadership and global partnership in meeting the \r\nMDGs. Tanzania will do its part. We call on all \r\npartners to do their part, as stipulated under MDG 8. \r\nOne such successful partnership is the collective efforts \r\nof the African leadership through the African Leaders \r\nMalaria Alliance (ALMA), chaired by His Excellency \r\nMr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, President of the United \r\nRepublic of Tanzania. Our focus within ALMA is on \r\nensuring that we attain the 2010 targets for universal \r\ncoverage of appropriate malaria prevention, diagnosis \r\nand treatment interventions. We are confident that, if \r\nthe requested support is realized, we can attain that \r\ntarget. For that reason, we ask for the full and timely \r\nreplenishment of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \r\nTuberculosis and Malaria. \r\n We all know that the Millennium Development \r\nGoals will not be attained without sustained economic \r\ngrowth and sustainable development. For Tanzania, \r\nwhere the vast majority of the people depend on \r\nagriculture for their incomes and livelihoods, poverty \r\ncannot be alleviated without addressing the challenges \r\nof production, productivity and markets in the \r\nagricultural sector. \r\n Recognizing that, Tanzania has developed a \r\nprogramme known as Kilimo Kwanza, which translates \r\nas “Agriculture First”, aimed at transforming and \r\nmodernizing the agricultural sector. A key component \r\nof the programme is the improvement of infrastructure, \r\nespecially irrigation systems, transport and energy. \r\nHowever, the major challenge for us remains how to \r\nfinance the huge investment gap in infrastructure. That \r\ngap cannot be filled by the public sector alone. For that \r\nreason, the participation of the private sector is \r\nimperative. \r\n Tanzania has undertaken a number of reforms to \r\ncreate an environment conducive to private sector \r\ninvestment. We have created the requisite legal, \r\nregulatory and institutional framework to attract both \r\nlocal and foreign private investment in infrastructure \r\ndevelopment. We now have a public-private \r\npartnership policy in place, and Parliament enacted a \r\nbill on such partnerships in June. \r\n Through a presidential circular, Tanzania also \r\nestablished the Tanzania National Business Council as \r\nan institution to provide a forum for public-private \r\nsector dialogue. The Business Council brings together \r\npublic and private sectors with a view to reaching \r\nconsensus and mutual understanding on strategic issues \r\nrelating to the efficient management of resources in the \r\npromotion of socio-economic development in \r\nTanzania. The Council’s Chairperson is the President \r\nof the United Republic of Tanzania. \r\nA/65/PV.19  \r\n \r\n10-55122 10 \r\n \r\n The Government of the United Republic of \r\nTanzania would like to reaffirm its commitment to \r\ndemocratic good governance, the rule of law and \r\nrespect for human rights. The recent peaceful \r\nreferendum in Zanzibar produced a new political \r\ndispensation that provides for a Government of \r\nnational unity whichever party wins the elections. That \r\nshould now stabilize Zanzibar and strengthen the \r\ndemocratic ideals that we all aspire to as Tanzania \r\nprepares for its general elections, scheduled for \r\n31 October. As in previous elections, we will do \r\neverything in our power to ensure that these are \r\npeaceful, free and fair. We thank all partners that, \r\nbilaterally or through the United Nations system, are \r\nstrengthening our capacity to realize that goal. \r\n Tanzania is pleased that Africa has continued to \r\nplay a leading role in conflict prevention, management \r\nand resolution, as well as in entrenching principles of \r\ngood governance. Increasingly, more and more African \r\ncountries are holding free, fair and peaceful elections, \r\nfollowed by smooth transitions. The peaceful \r\nreferendum in Kenya that paved the way for a new \r\nConstitution demonstrates the will of African countries \r\nto take charge of their own destinies. That is a matter \r\nof great satisfaction to us, and we commend the people \r\nand leadership of Kenya for that important \r\nachievement. \r\n We thank and commend all who continue to work \r\nhard for a political solution to the situation in Darfur \r\nthat will lead to durable peace and address the \r\nhumanitarian situation. We are concerned about \r\nperiodic eruptions of violence, and we call on all sides \r\nin Darfur to join the peace process. In the meantime, \r\nwe commend the African Union-United Nations Hybrid \r\nOperation in Darfur (UNAMID) for the good work that \r\nit continues to do under very difficult conditions. We \r\ntherefore urge the international community to give \r\nUNAMID all the support that it needs. \r\n We note the preparations and progress towards \r\nthe holding of a referendum in Southern Sudan early \r\nnext year. We call on all parties to do everything in \r\ntheir power to keep to the timetable for that \r\nreferendum. The referendum must be peaceful, free and \r\nfair, and the wishes of the people of Southern Sudan \r\nmust be respected. We commend the Secretary-General \r\nfor his initiatives to facilitate that process, including \r\nhis decision to appoint a panel of eminent persons, \r\nheaded by His Excellency Mr. Benjamin Mkapa, the \r\nformer President of the United Republic of Tanzania, to \r\nmonitor the process. We pledge Tanzania’s full support \r\nto Mr. Mkapa and his team for the successful \r\naccomplishment of the task ahead of them. We urge all \r\nparties to cooperate with the team, and we call upon \r\nthe international community to provide the requisite \r\nsupport for the successful holding of the referendum \r\nand the peaceful management of its outcome. \r\n Tanzania will continue to play its role in ensuring \r\nlasting peace and stability in Africa and elsewhere. \r\nThat includes contributing to United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations and missions in Africa and \r\nelsewhere, including those we have deployed in Darfur \r\nand Lebanon. \r\n We are concerned about the worsening political, \r\nhumanitarian, social and security situation in Somalia, \r\nwhich threatens the whole region and, ultimately, the \r\nworld. Recently, we witnessed terrorist bombings in \r\nUganda by the group Al-Shabaab, which caused the \r\nloss of many innocent lives and the destruction of \r\nproperty. Having been victim to similar attacks in  \r\nDar es Salaam in 1998, Tanzania condemns that \r\nbarbaric attack in the strongest terms and expresses \r\nsolidarity with and support for Uganda and other \r\nneighbours in tracking down and prosecuting those \r\ninvolved. \r\n We highly commend Uganda and Burundi for \r\ncontributing peacekeeping troops in Somalia under the \r\nAfrican Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM). We \r\nfurther thank all those African countries that have \r\ncommitted to providing additional troops to AMISOM. \r\nWe ask the international community to provide the \r\nsupport needed to make that deployment possible and \r\ntimely. However, the problem of Somalia cannot be left \r\nto Africans alone. In that regard, the Security Council \r\nmust be more engaged and supportive in finding a \r\nlasting solution to Somalia. \r\n Tanzania is concerned about the continued \r\nincrease in piracy activities in the Gulf of Aden and the \r\nIndian Ocean, which are now spreading beyond the \r\ncoast of Somalia. The piracy issue cannot be resolved \r\non the seas alone or without addressing the causal \r\nfactors on land. A coordinated, coherent, \r\ncomprehensive and integrated response that includes \r\npolitical, military, financial and legal support is \r\nneeded. The United Nations and the international \r\ncommunity should work closely with the African \r\nUnion, members of the Intergovernmental Authority on \r\nDevelopment and other neighbouring States to \r\n A/65/PV.19\r\n \r\n11 10-55122 \r\n \r\nsuppress acts of piracy, as well as to apprehend and \r\nprosecute those who commit that crime. \r\n In the United Republic of Tanzania, we recently \r\namended the criminal code to allow our courts to \r\nprosecute suspected pirates under universal \r\njurisdiction. We call on the international community to \r\nenhance the prosecution and custodial capacities of \r\ncountries, such as ours, that apprehend and prosecute \r\npirates. The international community must also agree \r\nto share post-prosecution custodial responsibilities \r\nwith the affected States. Tanzania has also offered to \r\ntrain 1,000 Somali soldiers in Tanzania in the firm \r\nbelief that, in the final analysis, peace and security in \r\nSomalia lie in the hands of the Somalis themselves. \r\n Over the years, Tanzania has been a home for \r\nmany refugees. The current stability in our \r\nneighbouring countries has enabled voluntary \r\nrepatriation of many refugees, in addition to those who \r\nhave been naturalized. As a result, the population of \r\nrefugees in Tanzania declined from 1.2 million in 1994 \r\nto 108,426 by 31 July this year. This has enabled the \r\nclosure of 12 refugee camps. \r\n Tanzania has also continued its tradition since \r\nindependence of granting citizenship to refugees who \r\nhave been in our country for many years. In April this \r\nyear, we naturalized 162,254 refugees who entered the \r\ncountry in 1972. The Government is now in the process \r\nof integrating these naturalized persons into Tanzanian \r\nsociety. \r\n This, however, is a costly exercise. It is estimated \r\nthat the naturalization and local integration programme \r\nwill cost over $146 million. This is a huge burden to a \r\npoor country like Tanzania. We call upon the \r\ninternational community to support this integration \r\nprogramme under the principle of equitable \r\nresponsibility and burden-sharing. \r\n We join others in welcoming the adoption of \r\nresolution 64/289 on system-wide coherence, which, \r\namong other things, established UN Women. It is our \r\nhope that UN Women will receive the required support \r\nfrom the international community and the entire United \r\nNations system to deliver on its mandate. Tanzania \r\ncongratulates Ms. Michelle Bachelet on her \r\nappointment to head UN Women and assures her of \r\nTanzania’s unwavering support as she discharges her \r\nduties. \r\n Tanzania’s experience as a pilot country in the \r\ndelivering as one reform initiative has convinced us \r\nthat this, indeed, was a good decision and has \r\nstrengthened national ownership and leadership. I am \r\npleased that Tanzania will, in January 2011, be the first \r\ncountry to present a common country programme. \r\n Tanzania fully supports the priorities that you, \r\nSir, have set for the sixty-fifth session of the General \r\nAssembly. Inclusive and democratic governance is as \r\nimportant at the national level as it is at the global \r\nlevel. It has, sadly, taken too long to give this issue the \r\npriority it deserves at all levels. We believe that the \r\ninclusive global governance agenda will ensure \r\naccountability and equitable participation in \r\ninternational trade and financial institutions, and open \r\ndoors for fair and equitable participation of developing \r\ncountries in the World Trade Organization, the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank. \r\n Tanzania emphasizes and reaffirms the \r\ninclusiveness of the General Assembly as opposed to \r\nthe Security Council. We thus call upon all Member \r\nStates to press for the expeditious reform of the \r\nSecurity Council. Africa has the largest number of \r\nMember States. It cannot continue to be denied fair \r\nrepresentation in that important organ of the United \r\nNations. We urge all Member States to support Africa \r\nin its rightful pursuit of permanent representation on \r\nthe Security Council. \r\n In this regard, Tanzania reiterates the decision of \r\nthe African Union, as contained in the Ezulwini \r\nConsensus, which demands not less than two \r\npermanent seats with all the prerogatives and privileges \r\nof permanent membership, including the right of veto, \r\nas well as five non-permanent seats. \r\n On the issues of the Middle East and Western \r\nSahara, let me reiterate what His Excellency President \r\nJakaya Mrisho Kikwete said during the sixth-fourth \r\nsession of the General Assembly in 2009 (see \r\nA/64/PV.6). Tanzania supports a two-State solution \r\nwhereby Israel and Palestine would live together side \r\nby side and at peace with each other. Tanzania strongly \r\nmaintains that this is the best way to sustainable peace \r\nin the Middle East. \r\n Regarding Western Sahara, the President also \r\ncalled upon the Security Council to expedite the \r\nprocess of giving the people of Western Sahara the \r\nopportunity to decide their future status. This matter \r\nA/65/PV.19  \r\n \r\n10-55122 12 \r\n \r\nhas dragged on since 1975 — in other words, for too \r\nlong. The time has come to end the impasse. \r\n Let me conclude by once again reaffirming \r\nTanzania’s belief and confidence in the United Nations \r\nas the Organization and forum for global governance \r\nand the pursuit of the letter and spirit of its Charter: a \r\nworld free from wars and dehumanizing poverty; a \r\nworld of sustainable economic and social progress, as \r\nwell as freedom, human rights and justice for all. We \r\nreaffirm our commitment to doing our part in pursuit of \r\nthat world. \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime \r\nMinister of the United Republic of Tanzania for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Mizengo Pinda, Prime Minister of the United \r\nRepublic of Tanzania, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Ali Osman Mohamed Taha, \r\nVice-President of the Republic of the Sudan \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of the Sudan. \r\n Mr. Ali Osman Mohamed Taha, Vice-President of \r\nthe Republic of the Sudan, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I have great \r\npleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Ali Osman \r\nMohamed Taha, Vice-President of the Republic of the \r\nSudan, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Mr. Taha (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): It gives me \r\ngreat pleasure at the outset to extend warm \r\ncongratulations to you, Sir, on your election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth \r\nsession. I am confident that your election was the right \r\nchoice. \r\n I would also like to commend the outstanding \r\nmanner in which Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki conducted \r\nthe meetings of the previous session. His statesmanship \r\nand experience reflected positively on the work of the \r\nsession. \r\n We would also like to extend our thanks and \r\nappreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and \r\nthe Secretariat for their ongoing and appreciated \r\nefforts. \r\n We followed with keen interest and actively \r\nparticipated in the preparations for the High-level \r\nPlenary Meeting on the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). We have reviewed our achievements \r\nand identified obstacles and challenges in a way that \r\nwill enable us to meet our obligations. There is no \r\ndoubt that the success attained and the constructive \r\nrecommendations submitted will encourage Member \r\nStates to make further progress in this respect. \r\n We would like to underscore the great importance \r\nof development aid in achieving the MDGs and of the \r\nneed to maintain such assistance even in the current \r\nsituation of successive global crises and in the context \r\nof the increasing burden of foreign debt on the \r\neconomies of the developing countries and their ability \r\nto achieve the MDGs. \r\n I would like to take this opportunity to give the \r\nAssembly a brief review of the recent political \r\ndevelopments in my country, especially regarding the \r\nimplementation of the Comprehensive Peace \r\nAgreement (CPA) signed in 2005, which was the \r\nsubject of a high-level meeting on the Sudan held three \r\ndays ago at the invitation of the Secretary-General and \r\nattended by a number of leaders and Heads of State. I \r\nnote the concluding communiqué citing positive \r\ndevelopments in the implementation of the CPA and \r\nthe steps to establish peace in Darfur. It also \r\ncommended the holding of public elections in the \r\nSudan last April in an atmosphere of tranquillity and \r\npeace. International observers were witness to the \r\ncredibility and integrity of the voting process. \r\n Arrangements are now under way for the holding \r\nof the referendum in Southern Sudan on schedule \r\nconcerning the options of unity or separation. For our \r\npart, we are determined that our fellow citizens in the \r\nSouth shall have their say without coercion and in an \r\natmosphere of freedom, integrity and transparency. We \r\nalso hope that unity will be the voluntary choice of the \r\ncitizens of Southern Sudan. We therefore call on all \r\npeople to support and consolidate the unity of the \r\nSudan and to participate in observing the referendum. \r\nWe also welcome the Secretary-General’s decision to \r\nask former Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa to \r\nchair the United Nations panel mandated to observe the \r\nreferendum. \r\n A/65/PV.19\r\n \r\n13 10-55122 \r\n \r\n We also recall my Government’s efforts to \r\nconsolidate peace in Darfur, which has undergone \r\nseveral positive changes that continue to promote the \r\nnormalization of the situation. Lasting peace would \r\nrestore to Darfur the vitality that has faltered in the \r\npast years due to conflicts fuelled by the proliferation \r\nof arms and by regional and international interventions. \r\nThe recent positive developments have enabled the \r\nholding of elections throughout Darfur, helped to \r\nconsolidate democratic legitimacy and led to the \r\nestablishment of new elected institutions. \r\n These positive transformations, which have \r\ncreated new conditions on the ground, have encouraged \r\nthe Government to develop a new strategy for Darfur, \r\nconcerning which we have conducted broad \r\ndiscussions with the people of Darfur at the individual, \r\ncollective and institutional levels, and with all the \r\nnational political forces. We have also conducted \r\nconsultations on Darfur with our partners in the peace \r\nprocess, first and foremost the African Union-United \r\nNations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) and \r\nthe African Union High-Level Implementation Panel \r\nably and skilfully led by President Thabo Mbeke. \r\n Many of our partners in the peace process and the \r\ninternational community have also supported and \r\nencouraged this strategy. The new strategy is based on \r\nfive key components: the establishment of security; the \r\nconsolidation of development; the resettlement of \r\ninternally displaced persons and people affected by the \r\nwar so they can lead a life of dignity; the \r\nencouragement of internal reconciliation that would \r\npromote social peace; and the pursuit of negotiations \r\nwith a view to drafting a settlement document agreed \r\nby the people of Darfur. The strategy envisages the \r\ncompletion of the negotiations currently under way in \r\nDoha through the sincere efforts and under the auspices \r\nof the sister State of Qatar. \r\n With a view to achieving the strategy’s \r\ndevelopment goals, the Government has appropriated \r\nfrom its own resources the sum of $1.9 billion over the \r\nnext four years to cover the costs of development \r\nprojects, in addition to what it hopes to raise from \r\npartners and donors. \r\n The strategy is designed to work closely with \r\nUNAMID, the Joint African Union-United Nations \r\nChief Mediator for Darfur, and the African Union \r\nExecutive Council in order to facilitate and arrange \r\nconsultations with the people of Darfur so as to \r\nuniversalize reconciliation and establish justice for all \r\nthrough national mechanisms and in close consultation \r\nwith all sectors of Darfurian society. \r\n It is worth noting that the strategy adopts a \r\npractical approach to implementation based on two \r\npillars. The first is the adoption of the idea of \r\npartnership. In that context, the Government has \r\nendeavoured to establish partnerships with all States \r\nand organizations that wish to engage with it on the \r\nbasis of the strategy. Foremost among those partners \r\nare UNAMID, the United Nations and its agencies and \r\norganizations, the African Union Executive Council, \r\nthe African Union itself and its institutions, the League \r\nof Arab States and the Organization of the Islamic \r\nConference. \r\n The second pillar is the exertion of special efforts to \r\ninvolve the citizens of Darfur — particularly at the grass-\r\nroots level and including elected representatives, civil \r\nsociety organizations and the internally displaced — so \r\nthat the centre of gravity of the peace process will not be \r\nfar removed from Darfurian society. Thus, the \r\nprescriptions for peace will be entrenched in the \r\nconscience of the people, which will facilitate their \r\nacceptance of them. This vision of peace has gathered \r\npowerful momentum from the positive changes in our \r\nrelationship with Chad, in addition to our vigorous efforts \r\nto strengthen our regional relations in the interest of \r\npromoting peace in the Sudan. \r\n With a view to bolstering stability in the various \r\nregions of the Sudan and eliminating the causes of \r\npotential armed conflicts, in October 2006 the \r\nGovernment concluded, in the Eritrean capital, \r\nAsmara, an agreement with the Eastern Front. The \r\nagreement provided for security arrangements that led \r\nto peace and security throughout the territory. In order \r\nto reinforce our efforts to implement the agreement, it \r\nwas agreed to convene an international conference on \r\nthe development and reconstruction of Eastern Sudan \r\non 1 December 2010, which the State of Kuwait has \r\ngraciously agreed to host. Preparations for the \r\nconference have been jointly undertaken by the United \r\nNations Development Programme, the Islamic \r\nDevelopment Bank in Jeddah, the Kuwaiti Fund for \r\nArab Economic Development and the Arab \r\nDevelopment Bank, in addition to the Sudanese \r\nGovernment. The conference will focus on three \r\ntopics: infrastructure, services and investment. From \r\nthis rostrum, I appeal to Member States to participate \r\nA/65/PV.19  \r\n \r\n10-55122 14 \r\n \r\nactively in that important forum in order to establish \r\nstability in that part of the Sudan. \r\n We are committed to combating impunity, which \r\nis part and parcel of the principle of international \r\njustice and does not admit politicization, \r\ndiscrimination or selectivity. However, selectivity and \r\npoliticization are prevalent in what is known as the \r\nInternational Criminal Court, which has become a tool \r\nto break the will of the people of the third world and to \r\nimpose hegemony over them. We have all witnessed \r\nthe hasty steps taken to subject a State non-party to the \r\nRome Statute of the International Criminal Court to its \r\npowers and jurisdiction, as a result of which the \r\nestablished principles of international law fell victim to \r\ncrude and unjust political intervention. \r\n Over the past six years, the Sudan has made \r\nprogress towards negotiated political settlements with \r\narmed movements in the South, East and West. The \r\ninvolvement of the International Criminal Court, in this \r\ncontext, directly jeopardizes the peaceful settlement \r\nprocess that the country seeks. Therefore, we \r\ncompletely reject this intervention, which has no place \r\nin international law, logic or policy, and is wholly \r\nunjustified. \r\n We appreciate and commend the position of the \r\nAfrican Union and other regional organizations to \r\nwhich the Sudan belongs, and of countries committed \r\nto the rule of international law that have condemned \r\nand strongly rejected the claims of the Court. \r\nTherefore, we call on the Security Council to \r\nreconsider its decision and to withdraw the file \r\ncompletely from the Court. In the light of the high-\r\nlevel meeting attended by representatives of all \r\nmembers of the Security Council and many other \r\ncountries, and of the Secretary-General’s communiqué \r\nof 24 September commending the efforts of the \r\nSudanese Government to fight impunity (see SG/2165), \r\nthe Council should refer the entire file to the Sudanese \r\njustice system so that it can deliver justice pursuant to \r\nthe established rules of international law and national \r\nlegislation. \r\n After the signing of the Comprehensive Peace \r\nAgreement, we hoped that the international community \r\nwould show cooperation commensurate with the \r\nSudan’s many accomplishments. We hoped to be \r\nincluded in the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries \r\n(HIPC) Debt Initiative and to resume receiving much-\r\nneeded development aid, like other States emerging \r\nfrom conflict, as reflected in relevant international \r\nrecommendations and resolutions. That should be in \r\naddition to the special treatment that the Sudan should \r\nenjoy as a least developed country. \r\n Similarly, we believe that the announcement by \r\ncreditors of their intention to cancel the Sudan’s \r\nforeign debts would dispel concerns about the \r\nreferendum on Southern Sudan and the negotiations \r\nbetween the two parties regarding the post-referendum \r\narrangements. We therefore call for cancellation of the \r\nSudan’s debts, on the basis of the same standards \r\napplied to other least developed African countries. That \r\nwould help fight trends that lead to confrontations and \r\ninstability and the deterioration of development in \r\ndeveloping countries. \r\n The African continent has continued to suffer \r\nfrom the repercussions of the global economic and \r\nfinancial crisis, as well as from the adverse effects of \r\nclimate change, including their impact on the prices of \r\nfood and energy. That has widened the scope of \r\npoverty and hunger and has increased social tensions, \r\nmigration, displacement, armed conflict and the \r\ninability of African States, especially the developing \r\ncountries, to cope with the humanitarian consequences \r\nof natural disasters. \r\n In that regard, we would like to draw attention to \r\nthe need to accord priority, through the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development, to questions \r\npertaining to the continent on the United Nations \r\ndevelopment agenda; to build the capacity of African \r\nand African Union institutions to maintain peace; to \r\ntake affirmative action in financing the continent’s \r\nplans for combating poverty, the AIDS pandemic and \r\nmalaria; and to provide humanitarian assistance and \r\nupgrade the capacities of African States in order to \r\nstrengthen their efforts in realizing the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. \r\n The question of Palestine has been inscribed on \r\nthe United Nations agenda for many decades, while the \r\nPalestinian people have continued to suffer. They are \r\ndeported, displaced, killed, and driven away from their \r\nhomeland, despite the fact that the United Nations has \r\nadopted numerous resolutions that Israel has refused to \r\nimplement, in clear defiance of the will of the \r\ninternational community. We call upon Israel to \r\nimplement all international resolutions and return all \r\noccupied Arab lands in Palestine, the Golan Heights \r\nand Lebanon. An independent Palestine is a noble \r\n A/65/PV.19\r\n \r\n15 10-55122 \r\n \r\ndemand and is the legitimate right of the people of \r\nPalestine, supported by the calls of all peace-loving \r\npeoples and countries. \r\n We call for a Middle East free of nuclear weapons \r\nand weapons of mass destruction. We underline the \r\nright of States to acquire nuclear technology for \r\npeaceful uses and to settle disputes through dialogue \r\nand negotiation. We also stress the need to renounce \r\nharmful propaganda and the sowing of fear, panic and \r\ntension in the region. \r\n We pinned great hopes on the success of an \r\ninternational consensus on the issues of the \r\nenvironment and climate, in view of the direct and \r\nsevere effect of climate change on the life of people in \r\nmy country and in many others, as confirmed by \r\nstudies prepared by experts in this Organization and its \r\nspecialized agencies. That has prompted the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to draw attention to the close link between \r\nclimate change and a number of armed conflicts on the \r\nAfrican continent and elsewhere, in particular over \r\nDarfur. \r\n We therefore hoped that the efforts to address \r\nclimate change would be crowned with success at the \r\nCopenhagen Conference and that the developed \r\ncountries would pledge, on the basis of their historical \r\nresponsibilities, to adopt strategies and programmes \r\nwith clearly defined goals and principles aimed at \r\naddressing the root causes of climate change. We \r\nhoped they would pledge to provide the necessary \r\nfinancial resources for sharing responsibility for the \r\npreservation of this planet, while fully respecting the \r\nprinciples agreed on in the 1992 Earth Summit \r\nDeclaration in Rio de Janeiro. \r\n Mr. Samuel Santos López (Nicaragua), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair. \r\n I am pleased to recall the laudable attention my \r\ncountry has given to the problem of mitigating the \r\neffects of climate change through numerous \r\nprogrammes, plans and institutions, as well as by \r\npromoting the necessary awareness of the gravity of \r\nthe problem among wide sectors of the population. \r\nHowever, that remains a moral obligation and a \r\nhumanitarian mission and responsibility that demands \r\njoint international efforts. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nVice-President of the Republic of the Sudan for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Ali Osman Mohammad Taha, Vice-President \r\nof the Republic of the Sudan, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by The Honourable Orette Bruce \r\nGolding, Prime Minister of Jamaica \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of Jamaica. \r\n The Honourable Orette Bruce Golding, Prime \r\nMinister of Jamaica, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming to the United Nations His \r\nExcellency The Honourable Orette Bruce Golding, \r\nPrime Minister of Jamaica, and inviting him to address \r\nthe General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Golding (Jamaica): I would like to \r\ncongratulate Mr. Deiss again on his assumption of the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at the sixty-fifth \r\nsession and, on behalf of the Jamaican delegation, to \r\nassure him of our full cooperation in the ambitious \r\nundertaking on which he has embarked. I extend \r\nJamaica’s appreciation to his predecessor, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Ali Treki, for so ably guiding the \r\nproceedings of the sixty-fourth session of the \r\nAssembly. \r\n We come to the Hall of this great institution as \r\npartners. It is the only organization of its kind, where \r\ncountries of the world, no matter how rich or poor, big \r\nor small, powerful or weak, sit at the same table, joined \r\ntogether by the principle of the sovereign equality of \r\nall its Members. \r\n As leaders, we are privileged to be the custodians \r\nof the world, mandated to secure for its people a just \r\nand peaceful existence and to enable them to achieve \r\nhappiness and prosperity. We come with differing \r\nperspectives, shaped by our own experiences and the \r\npeculiar challenges we face. But we have long \r\nrecognized that however unique our individual \r\ncircumstances may appear, they are all affected by our \r\ninterdependence. \r\n The impact of climate change shows that we all \r\nlive under the same canopy. Diseases that can devastate \r\nwhole populations know no boundaries and require no \r\nA/65/PV.19  \r\n \r\n10-55122 16 \r\n \r\nentry permit. Natural disasters are indiscriminate in the \r\nselection of their targets. The financial crisis on Wall \r\nStreet did not disrupt just the American economy; it \r\nricocheted across the world, affecting millions of \r\npeople who do not even know where Wall Street is. \r\nCommunications technology has rendered us \r\nneighbours in the same village, for no matter how vast \r\nthe oceans that separate us or the continents over which \r\nwe are scattered, we are affected or influenced for good \r\nor bad by each other. \r\n It is in that in mutuality, that interconnectedness \r\nand interdependency, with all our commonality and \r\ndiversity, that we find both our strengths and our \r\nweaknesses. We have seen those strengths at work and \r\nwhat they can accomplish, the positive difference we \r\ncan make when we surmount our differences and find \r\ncommon purpose in preventing wars and securing \r\npeace, in safeguarding human rights and promoting \r\nhuman development. And we recognize our \r\nweaknesses, our failure so often to raise our lowest \r\ncommon denominator to a level where consensus can \r\nmore readily be found and action galvanized. \r\n We cannot afford to ignore the cynics who feel \r\nthat we should have done more, for there is more that \r\nneeds to be done. Some age-old problems still remain, \r\nand new challenges have emerged that threaten to \r\nundermine the achievements we have already made. \r\nWe refuse to accept that after 65 years of our existence, \r\n1.5 billion people — 1.5 billion — should have to live \r\nin poverty and more than 1 billion suffer the pangs of \r\nhunger. \r\n The playing field of the world is still not level, \r\nbecause the equality of our sovereignty has not been \r\nmatched by the equality of opportunity. Now global \r\nwarming, terrorism and transnational organized crime \r\npose new threats to the peace, security and progress of \r\nthe world. \r\n The heavy agenda set for the sixty-fifth session \r\nreflects the scope and complexity of the issues that \r\nconfront us. Each of us approaches that agenda with a \r\ndifferent set of priorities. Yet there are some issues that \r\nare so broad in their implications that they demand \r\nfrom us special and urgent attention. They manifest \r\nthemselves in the stark reality of our existence: 20 per \r\ncent of the world’s population enjoys 75 per cent of the \r\nworld’s income, and 15 per cent of the world’s \r\npopulation lives on less than 1 per cent of the world’s \r\nincome. We come here as equals, but when we go back \r\nhome some are vastly more equal than others. \r\n It is easy to blame that on the injustices of the \r\ndistant past, the neo-colonialism of the more recent \r\npast or the Washington consensus of the present. That \r\nis only part of the story. \r\n Developing countries struggling with poverty and \r\nunderdevelopment must accept our share of the blame. \r\nWe must recognize that there is a lot that we can and \r\nmust do for ourselves. Each of us must adopt and \r\npursue with fixity of purpose the appropriate economic \r\nand social policies and good governance practices. We \r\nmust be prepared to take the tough decisions that are so \r\noften necessary to secure the advancement of our \r\npeople, and we must never squander the sacrifices we \r\ncall on them to make. President Obama was right when \r\nhe declared at the High-level Plenary Meeting last \r\nWednesday (see A/65/PV.9) that each of us must \r\nassume leadership of our own transformation even \r\nwhile requiring the support of the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n The existing international financial system and \r\nmultilateral trading arrangements will not enable us to \r\nredress those imbalances. They have not done so up to \r\nnow, and they are unlikely to do so in the future. \r\nMarket forces and competitiveness are indispensable \r\nfor economic development, but the new millennium \r\ncannot be defined by the survival of the fittest. We \r\nmust make it our business to assist the weak to become \r\nfit in order not just to survive but to prosper. \r\n For almost a decade we have been trying to \r\nconclude the Doha Round in order to put in place a \r\nregime that facilitates the expansion of trade, which is \r\nso vital to increasing global prosperity. Redressing the \r\nlopsidedness in international trade is necessary if we \r\nare to restore and sustain global economic growth. It is \r\njust common sense that if one part of the world is not \r\nable to export more to the rest of the world, it will not \r\nbe able to import more from that other part of the \r\nworld. It may do so for a time by borrowing from that \r\nother part of the world in order to pay for its imports, \r\nbut that is a bubble that will eventually burst. Many \r\ncountries have seen that bubble burst in the recent \r\nglobal crisis. \r\n We insist that Doha must include a development \r\ndimension to build competitiveness and capacity in \r\nweak exporting countries, as well as special and \r\ndifferential treatment calibrated to our differing levels \r\n A/65/PV.19\r\n \r\n17 10-55122 \r\n \r\nof development, economic size and vulnerabilities. \r\nThat offers a win-win situation: more exports from \r\ndeveloping countries mean that there will be more jobs \r\nfor their people and more demand for imports from \r\nother countries. \r\n We urge that every effort be made to conclude the \r\nDoha Round in that spirit, and we urge, further, that the \r\ngains already accrued to developing countries in earlier \r\nnegotiations not be unravelled. The global financial \r\ncrisis exposed weaknesses in governance of the \r\ninternational financial system, weaknesses that have \r\nbecome more acute with changes in the global \r\nlandscape and shifts in the centre of gravity of the \r\nworld’s economy. \r\n We endorse the need for reform of the \r\ninternational financial institutions, in order to improve \r\nstandards of efficiency and accountability, and the \r\ncreation of a more democratic structure, one that will \r\nallow developing countries a greater voice. \r\n In the same vein, while we welcome the \r\nestablishment of the Group of 20 as the locus of global \r\neconomic policymaking, we urge that it institute a \r\nmechanism to engage the views of the wider, \r\ndeveloping world. It is also important to establish a \r\nclose working relationship with the United Nations to \r\nensure complementarity with the role of the United \r\nNations in economic development as mandated under \r\nits Charter. \r\n We urge also that the multilateral agencies move \r\nbeyond what is now the paramount objective: to ensure \r\nthat the international payments system is secure. The \r\nfinancial assistance provided to many countries during \r\nthis time of stress, necessary and welcome though it is, \r\nis rooted in policies that are contractionary, designed to \r\nconsolidate and stabilize even at the cost of increasing \r\npoverty and social dislocation. \r\n We have hardly learned from the experiences of \r\nthe past. The gains made towards achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals are being eroded and \r\nour ability to recover from the global shocks is being \r\nstymied. Bold new thinking is required, thinking that \r\nplaces development as the primary focus of multilateral \r\nintervention. We know we must make sacrifices, but let \r\nthose sacrifices be an investment for our future, not \r\njust a tourniquet for our immediate dilemma. \r\n We too are disappointed that the climate change \r\nsummit in Copenhagen failed to reach consensus on \r\nmitigation and adaptation strategies. While the \r\nCopenhagen Accord did not deliver the comprehensive \r\nagreement we had hoped for, it nonetheless provided \r\npolitical impetus for negotiations towards a binding \r\nagreement for the second commitment period under the \r\nKyoto Protocol. We are hopeful that the Cancún \r\nmeeting in November and December will further \r\nadvance the process that will eventually lead to a \r\nlegally binding and comprehensive agreement under \r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange and the Bali Road Map. \r\n With member countries that are among the most \r\nvulnerable to global warming, the Caribbean \r\nCommunity (CARICOM) and its partners in the \r\nAlliance of Small Island States will continue to defend \r\nthe long-term stabilization of greenhouse gas \r\nconcentrations with a cap of 1.5°C above pre-industrial \r\nlevels. The 2°C threshold being advanced by some \r\nwould be catastrophic for countries in our region and \r\nlow-lying small island States in general, and we appeal \r\nto all our partners to coalesce around a temperature \r\nthreshold that would preserve the viability of the most \r\nvulnerable countries — as was underscored a few days \r\nago during the high-level five-year review of the \r\nMauritius Strategy. The commitment by developed \r\ncountries to provide $30 billion in new funding to \r\nassist developing countries to improve mitigation and \r\nadaptation strategies over the next two years offers an \r\nopportunity to prove the cynics wrong, to demonstrate \r\nthat when we speak, we say what we mean and mean \r\nwhat we say. \r\n The catastrophic earthquake in Haiti in January of \r\nthis year and the recent disastrous floods in Pakistan \r\nare stark reminders of the increasing vulnerability of \r\nmany countries and regions to natural disasters. We \r\nwere shocked by the immensity of the impact of those \r\ndisasters and saddened by the loss of life, the suffering \r\nand the destruction of property and infrastructure. We \r\nexpress our solidarity with the Governments and \r\npeople of both Haiti and Pakistan. \r\n The reconstruction of Haiti is CARICOM’s most \r\nurgent priority. We commend the international \r\ncommunity for committing almost $10 billion from 57 \r\ndonor countries and organizations. However, we \r\nimpress upon them the urgency with which actions \r\nmust follow those commitments, especially in \r\nstrengthening the institutional capacity of Haiti to \r\nundertake the mammoth task at hand. The Haitian \r\npeople have suffered too much for too long. We have a \r\nA/65/PV.19  \r\n \r\n10-55122 18 \r\n \r\nduty to help them to make a fresh start and to embark \r\non the journey of lasting progress and development. \r\nWe underscore the important role of the United Nations \r\nStabilization Mission in Haiti in helping to foster the \r\nenvironment necessary to ensure a sustainable future \r\nfor the Haitian people. \r\n The danger to international peace and security of \r\nnuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism must remain \r\nat the top of the international security agenda. We are \r\nencouraged by the 2010 Review Conference of the \r\nNon-Proliferation Treaty in June, which elaborated on \r\nmeasures toward a nuclear-weapon-free world and the \r\nstrengthening of the nuclear non-proliferation regime. \r\nWe have no doubt that the new START treaty, signed \r\nbetween Russia and the United States of America in \r\nApril of this year, was a contributing factor. We look \r\nforward to the ratification and entry into force of that \r\ntreaty between those two States, which together \r\npossess more than 90 per cent of the world’s nuclear \r\narsenal. Their faithful compliance with the treaty and \r\ntheir commitment to greater transparency in achieving \r\nfurther reductions will secure our hope for eventual \r\nnuclear disarmament. \r\n We are also encouraged by the resumption of \r\ntalks between Israel and Palestine. It offers renewed \r\nhope for a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in the \r\nMiddle East, one that guarantees the security of Israel \r\nand the unquestioned recognition of a Palestinian State. \r\nWe urge both sides to ensure that this renewed hope \r\ndoes not turn into despair. \r\n Latin America and the Caribbean are faced with \r\nthe twin menace of the illicit trade in narcotic drugs \r\nand small arms. The open borders in the Caribbean \r\nmake us an easy conduit for trans-shipment between \r\nthe major sources and destinations of illicit drugs. The \r\nattendant crime and violence constitute a major threat \r\nto national development because they create instability \r\nand compel us to divert scarce resources to tackle this \r\nscourge. \r\n Jamaica has adopted a multifaceted approach to \r\ntackle crime and violence, relying not only on law \r\nenforcement but on strategic social intervention and \r\nsocial transformation initiatives to create new \r\nopportunities and inspire hope, especially among our \r\nyoung people, who are vulnerable to being recruited or \r\nconscripted into criminal enterprises. \r\n However, we cannot do it alone. The \r\ntransnational nature of organized crime requires cross-\r\nborder collaboration at the bilateral, regional and \r\ninternational levels if we are to combat the illegal trade \r\nand to tackle with equal vigour the supply, transit and \r\ndemand sides of the international drug trade. The \r\nrecent high-level meeting on transnational organized \r\ncrime and the Fourth Biennial Meeting of States on \r\nSmall Arms and Light Weapons were instrumental in \r\nreinforcing the need for the implementation of \r\nmeasures to curtail the growing threat. Those efforts \r\nwould be strengthened by the conclusion of a legally \r\nbinding instrument to curtail the illicit trade in small \r\narms and light weapons and ammunition, and we urge \r\nthe United Nations to approach this troubling issue \r\nwith the urgency that it deserves. \r\n International institutions cannot retain their \r\nlegitimacy if they do not adapt to changing times and \r\nthe new configuration of the international community. \r\nThe United Nations Security Council cannot be exempt \r\nfrom that process. Fundamental reform is required to \r\naddress the existing imbalances in the current power \r\nstructure of the Council and to secure expansion in \r\nboth categories of membership in order to correctly \r\nreflect the contemporary global realities. \r\n In advancing the discussions on system-wide \r\ncoherence, we support the need to improve the \r\noperations of the United Nations at the country level to \r\nensure that the system can appropriately respond to the \r\nneeds of recipient countries and to prevent the \r\nunnecessary imposition of undue conditionalities. In \r\nthis context, we laud the establishment of the United \r\nNations Entity for Gender Equality and the \r\nEmpowerment of Women (UN Women), and we \r\ncongratulate former President of Chile Mrs. Michelle \r\nBachelet on her appointment as head of UN Women. I \r\nam confident that under her leadership significant \r\nprogress will be made to achieve the goals of gender \r\nequality and to meet the special needs of women and \r\ngirls worldwide. \r\n We must not allow ourselves to be imprisoned by \r\nour past but even as we look to the future we dare not \r\nignore the experiences that have shaped our present \r\ncondition. The transatlantic slave trade to which \r\nmillions of Africans fell victim was one such epoch. \r\nCARICOM States are therefore pleased that our \r\ninitiative to have erected a permanent memorial to \r\nhonour the victims of slavery has won the support of \r\nthe United Nations community, in keeping with the \r\nmandate of the 2001 World Conference against \r\nRacism. We commend UNESCO for its decision to \r\n A/65/PV.19\r\n \r\n19 10-55122 \r\n \r\nlaunch an international competition for the design of \r\nthis monument. \r\n Jamaica reaffirms its confidence in the United \r\nNations as the indispensable forum for our collective \r\ndeliberations aimed at addressing the major challenges \r\nconfronting our world. We must take pride in our \r\nachievements, but we must always be mindful that our \r\nmission is not yet accomplished. We must never tire, \r\neven when burdened with frustration. Our impatience \r\nmust be turned into renewed energy. Into our hands has \r\nbeen entrusted the responsibility to make this world a \r\nbetter place for all of mankind to live, prosper and \r\nenjoy happiness. That is what they expect of us. That is \r\nwhat they deserve, and that is what we must do \r\neverything in our power to deliver. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister of Jamaica for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n Mr. Orette Bruce Golding, Prime Minister of \r\nJamaica, was escorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Dato’ Sri Mohd Najib bin Tun Haji \r\nAbdul Razak, Prime Minister of Malaysia \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of Malaysia. \r\n Dato’ Sri Mohd Najib bin Tun Haji Abdul Razak, \r\nPrime Minister of Malaysia, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Dato’ Sri \r\nMohd Najib bin Tun Haji Abdul Razak, Prime Minister \r\nof Malaysia, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Mr. Razak (Malaysia): Allow me at the outset to \r\ncongratulate Mr. Deiss on his election as the President \r\nof the Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. I am \r\nconfident that under his very able and astute \r\nleadership, the sixty-fifth session will be able to \r\ncomplete its proceedings successfully. Let me assure \r\nhim of Malaysia’s full support for his presidency. \r\n Let me reaffirm Malaysia’s unwavering and \r\ncontinuing support for the United Nations and the \r\nmultilateral principles, based on international law, that \r\nit embodies. Let me also reiterate Malaysia’s \r\ncommitment to doing our part in our collective \r\nendeavour. We do so in the strong belief that all \r\nnations, no matter how large or small, rich or poor, \r\nstrong or weak, have a common responsibility towards \r\ncreating a better world for tomorrow. \r\n It is my firm belief that in order to create a better \r\nworld for our future generations, we need to take into \r\naccount today’s realities and learn from the lessons of \r\nyesterday. \r\n Among the most important challenges \r\nconfronting the international community today that \r\nneed to be addressed collectively is that of ensuring a \r\njust, equitable and durable peace — peace not just \r\nduring our time, but peace for all times. It is imperative \r\nthat we achieve peace based on a covenant of the \r\nwilling, and not one enforced by way of hegemony \r\nthrough fear and coercion. Such peace can be achieved \r\nonly if we are willing to constructively engage with \r\neach other through dialogue. Such discussions would \r\nhelp in creating a deeper understanding as well as \r\nappreciation of and respect for each other in our \r\ndetermination to create a better future for all citizens of \r\nthe world. \r\n As a trade organization, the World Trade \r\nOrganization remains relevant in today’s economic \r\nclimate. Malaysia believes that the Doha Round must \r\nreturn to its original objective of ensuring free, fair and \r\nequitable trade. Let us join efforts and focus on moving \r\nthe process forward and building on the progress and \r\nachievements to date. It is urgent that we conclude this \r\nmatter as soon as possible. \r\n Since the adoption of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals a decade ago, which galvanized \r\nthe world into collective action, there has been a lack \r\nof efforts on joint endeavours towards the betterment \r\nof humanity. The missed opportunity at last year’s \r\nclimate change meeting in Copenhagen is a wake-up \r\ncall for all of us. We need to bridge the gaps in \r\nresolving and addressing the issue of climate change, \r\nwhich affects the lives and livelihoods of the peoples \r\nof the world and our future generations. \r\n On 7 June 2010, the Malaysian Parliament \r\nunanimously passed a resolution condemning the brutal \r\nIsraeli attack on the humanitarian convoy in \r\ninternational waters. That resolution was based on \r\nhumanitarian grounds and demanded that the \r\nPalestinians be given their basic rights, and that was \r\nwhy the members of the Parliament, regardless of their \r\nA/65/PV.19  \r\n \r\n10-55122 20 \r\n \r\npolitical alignment, stood together in full support of it. \r\nWe reaffirm today our solidarity and sympathy with the \r\npeople of Turkey and the families of the victims for \r\ntheir tragic loss. \r\n Malaysia understood the necessity of letting the \r\nmultilateral system work. We were happy to see the \r\nestablishment of the United Nations panel of inquiry \r\nand the international fact-finding mission of the \r\nHuman Rights Council. We are pleased with the \r\nfindings of the fact-finding mission, whose report \r\n(A/HRC/15/21) has found that the conduct of the \r\nIsraeli military and other personnel towards the flotilla \r\npassengers was not only disproportionate but also \r\ndemonstrated levels of totally unnecessary and \r\nincredible violence. That inhuman attack constituted a \r\ngrave violation of human rights law and international \r\nhumanitarian law. The Malaysian Parliament feels \r\nvindicated by those findings. \r\n We are now waiting for the panel of inquiry to \r\ncomplete its work. We want to see the perpetrators of \r\nthe attacks brought to justice and adequate \r\ncompensation provided to the innocent victims of the \r\nattacks. We want the United Nations to act justly and \r\ndecisively, without fear or favour, in a manner that \r\nwould ensure that transgressions of blatant \r\ninternational laws are dealt with and that justice is \r\ndone and seen to be done. \r\n On the Middle East peace process, Malaysia is \r\nencouraged by the recent developments, especially the \r\nactive role by the Obama Administration and the \r\nQuartet in seeking a comprehensive and lasting \r\nsolution, a solution not only to the problem between \r\nPalestine and Israel, but also in the wider region. We \r\nwelcome the recent initiative by the United States to \r\nhost direct peace talks between Palestine and Israel. \r\nWe also call on all parties to support, and not to be \r\ndistracted from, these efforts to achieve the aspiration \r\nof creating two sovereign States, living side by side in \r\npeace, within secure and recognized borders. For this \r\nto happen, the following prerequisites should be \r\naddressed. \r\n First, Israel must heed the high expectations of \r\nthe international community to end this long-standing \r\nconflict. We call on the United States and other \r\nmembers of the Quartet to persuade Israel to end the \r\nconstruction of new settlements in the West Bank and \r\nJerusalem. \r\n Secondly, reconciliation efforts must bear fruit. \r\nThe achievement of political unity among the \r\nPalestinians is vital in moving the peace process \r\nforward and in the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip. \r\n Thirdly, both parties must eschew violence and \r\nensure the protection of civilians and respect for \r\ninternational humanitarian and human rights law. \r\n While harnessing our efforts to promote \r\ninternational peace and harmony, we are concerned \r\nabout the growing trend in some parts of the world to \r\nperpetuate or even fuel Islamophobia. Attempts to \r\ndemonize Islam offend the one and a half billion \r\nadherents of the religion. It widens the divide between \r\nthe Muslim world and the West. \r\n The real issue is not between Muslims and \r\nnon-Muslims, but between the moderates and the \r\nextremists of all religions, be it Islam, Christianity or \r\nJudaism. In all religions, we have inadvertently \r\nallowed the ugly voices of the periphery to drown out \r\nthe many voices of reason and common sense. I \r\ntherefore urge us to embark on building a global \r\nmovement of moderates from all faiths, moderates \r\ncommitted to working together to combat and \r\nmarginalize the extremists who have held the world \r\nhostage with their bigotry and bias. We must — I \r\nrepeat, must — urgently reclaim the centre and the \r\nmoral high ground that has been usurped from us. We \r\nmust choose moderation over extremism. We must \r\nchoose negotiation over confrontation. We must choose \r\nto work together and not against each other, and we \r\nmust give this effort top priority, for time is not on our \r\nside. \r\n In this regard, we are heartened to note that a \r\ngroup of American evangelical Christians worked \r\ntirelessly to prevent the threatened burning of the \r\nKoran, with the compelling argument that it is in fact \r\nun-Christian to burn the Koran. This is a clear example \r\nof what can be achieved when moderates in each faith \r\nstand up to the extremists who are trying to hijack the \r\nuniversal values of our religions. \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n We commend President Obama and Mayor \r\nBloomberg for rising to the challenge by affirming the \r\nrights of supporters of the Cordoba House to be located \r\nnear the site of the World Trade Center. This project \r\nwill include a mosque and a multi-faith community \r\ncentre open to all. We support the objectives of the \r\n A/65/PV.19\r\n \r\n21 10-55122 \r\n \r\nCordoba Initiative, an organization that focuses on \r\npromoting peace, understanding and moderation, both \r\nbetween Muslims and non-Muslims and within the \r\nMuslim community. \r\n All countries should encourage and support \r\ninitiatives that promote mutual respect and peaceful \r\ncoexistence and reject the extremists who divide us all \r\nwith issues that have in the past brought about untold \r\nmisery and hatred. \r\n Allow me to share my own country’s experience \r\nin managing issues of diversity. Malaysia is a \r\nmultiracial, multi-religious, multicultural and \r\ndemocratic society that has benefited from positive \r\ninteraction and synergy between the various \r\ncommunities. Mosques, temples, churches and other \r\nplaces of worship coexist in harmony. Although Islam \r\nis the official religion, we honour other religions — \r\nBuddhism, Christianity and Hinduism — by making \r\ntheir religious and cultural celebrations national \r\nholidays and celebrating them as national events. It is \r\nthis equilibrium that leads to moderation or what is \r\ncalled wasatiyyah in the Islamic tradition of mutual \r\njustice. \r\n Malaysia stands at the geographical crossroads of \r\nthe major civilizations and religions of the world. We \r\nare therefore well poised to play our part in promoting \r\nreligious understanding, harmony and tolerance. To \r\nfurther strengthen our process of national unity, I have \r\nintroduced a philosophy known as One Malaysia. One \r\nMalaysia is a vision that seeks renewal and \r\nrejuvenation to bring all our people together in a just \r\nand harmonious relationship. One Malaysia calls for \r\nthe acceptance of diversity as a source of greater unity. \r\nWe seek to celebrate our multiethnic and \r\nmulti-religious society for strategic strength and \r\nharmony. \r\n It is time for the moderates in all countries and in \r\nall religions to take back the centre, to reclaim the \r\nagenda for peace and pragmatism and to marginalize \r\nthe extremists. This global movement of the moderates \r\nwill save us from sinking into the abyss of despair and \r\ndepravation. This is an opportunity for us to provide \r\nmuch-needed leadership, to bring hope and to restore \r\ndignity for all. With greater will and collective \r\ndetermination, we will build a more peaceful, secure \r\nand equitable world. \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime \r\nMinister of Malaysia for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n Dato’ Sri Mohd Najib bin Tun Haji Abdul Razak, \r\nPrime Minister of Malaysia, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Josaia V. Bainimarama, Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of the Fiji Islands \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of the Fiji Islands. \r\n Mr. Josaia V. Bainimarama, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of the Fiji Islands, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I have great \r\npleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Josaia V. \r\nBainimarama, Prime Minister of the Republic of the \r\nFiji Islands, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Mr. Bainimarama (Fiji): I extend to you, Sir, \r\nand to this august Assembly warm greetings from the \r\nGovernment and people of Fiji. May I take this \r\nopportunity to congratulate you on your election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly’s sixty-fifth \r\nsession and to pay tribute to your predecessor, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Treki. \r\n As I highlighted last year in my address (see \r\nA/64/PV.10), Fiji and her people, through the Strategic \r\nFramework for Change, have embarked on a path of \r\nstructural reform to modernize and liberalize our \r\neconomy in line with today’s global environment. As \r\npart of this agenda, the Fiji Government has revamped \r\nits foreign policy. Our new foreign policy direction \r\nstems from the philosophical basis that, while we \r\ndetermine our own destinies as sovereign States, we \r\nmust at the same time work in collaboration with all \r\nMember States towards sustainable world peace, \r\nsubstantive justice, dignity and respect for all. \r\n However, we cannot achieve these objectives or \r\nactually implement these noble principles if we simply \r\nrely on predetermined political influences or \r\npredetermined alignments. We must be prepared to \r\nexpand the range of our international relationships and \r\nnot simply subscribe to bloc voting. We must assess \r\nand decide each issue on its merits. We must decide \r\neach matter based on equality, substantive justice and \r\ninternational law. We must keep an open mind. This \r\nA/65/PV.19  \r\n \r\n10-55122 22 \r\n \r\napproach will result in the manifestation of a fairer and \r\nmore just system for all Fiji’s citizens. \r\n This significant shift in foreign policy direction \r\nheralds Fiji’s globalization and maturity and \r\ndemonstrates Fiji’s intention to become a good and \r\nengaged global citizen. Accordingly, over the past year \r\nFiji has formalized diplomatic relations with many \r\ncountries with which no ties previously existed. In \r\naddition, Fiji has sought membership of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement. The broadening of our \r\nengagement with the rest of the world was given \r\nfurther impetus in Abu Dhabi in June, when, at the \r\nArab League’s invitation, a summit was held between \r\nthe Pacific small island developing States and the \r\nmember countries of the League which was hosted by \r\nthe United Arab Emirates. \r\n This commitment to be a good global citizen is \r\nfurther expressed through Fiji’s ongoing engagement \r\nwith the United Nations and its associated agencies and \r\nsecretariats. There is no better example of this \r\nengagement than Fiji’s long-term contribution to the \r\ncause of United Nations peacekeeping and \r\npeacebuilding. Fijian servicemen and women currently \r\nserve in peacekeeping missions in Iraq, southern \r\nSudan, Liberia, Darfur and Timor-Leste. I offer my \r\ncountry’s tribute to the selfless service given by United \r\nNations peacekeepers and peacebuilders, past and \r\npresent, in the troubled regions of our world. We pay \r\nspecial tribute to those who have made the ultimate \r\nsacrifice to the cause of peacekeeping. \r\n On the subject of peace and security, Fiji is proud \r\nto have been among the Member States that in 2006 \r\nvoted in favour of preparations for a robust and legally \r\nbinding arms trade treaty in 2012. We remain \r\ncommitted to the work of the United Nations to curb \r\nthe illicit trade in small arms and light weapons. Fiji \r\nhas ratified the Convention on Cluster Munitions and \r\nregards this instrument as a welcome development for \r\nhumanitarianism and international disarmament. It also \r\nremains fully committed to international efforts against \r\nterrorism. \r\n With respect to resolving the world’s territorial \r\nand sovereignty disputes, Fiji stands firm with all \r\ninternational efforts aimed at peaceful resolution \r\nthrough a process of genuine dialogue. It welcomes the \r\nrecent resumption of direct negotiations between the \r\nleaders of Israel and Palestine and hopes for a \r\nsuccessful outcome. \r\n Fiji is an active member of the Special Political \r\nand Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee). \r\nFollowing our participation in the ministerial mission \r\nof the Melanesian Spearhead Group to New Caledonia \r\nthis year, Fiji sponsored the Fourth Committee’s 2010 \r\nresolution on New Caledonia. We urge all concerned \r\nparties to accelerate the progress of the provisions of \r\nthe Nouméa Accord. \r\n Over the past year, the Fiji Government has \r\nimplemented a number of legal changes that have not \r\nonly modernized our laws and brought about gender \r\nand social parity, but have also ensured compliance \r\nwith international conventions. These changes include \r\nthe Crimes Decree, which eliminated the archaic rules \r\nin respect of rape trials. We have implemented for the \r\nfirst time a comprehensive law against domestic \r\nviolence to comply with our international obligation to \r\nprotect the welfare of women and children. We now \r\nhave child welfare laws which require the reporting of \r\nviolence against children or suspicion of abuse of \r\nminors. These and other new laws assist in our \r\ncompliance with the Rome Statute by recognizing \r\ncrimes against humanity and incorporating them into \r\nour domestic laws. Fiji was also present in June at the \r\nReview Conference of the Rome Statute held in \r\nUganda and is of course supportive of the work of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. Reforms in our laws and \r\noutlook have helped us comply with the Convention on \r\nthe Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against \r\nWomen and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. \r\nThey also support our efforts to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\n I would like to reaffirm the critical points made at \r\nlast week’s MDG Summit and at the high-level review \r\nof the Mauritius Strategy for the Further \r\nImplementation of the Programme of Action for the \r\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing \r\nStates. I make these points as one of the United \r\nNations Members classified as a small island \r\ndeveloping State. In spite of their considerable \r\ndomestic efforts in cooperation with the international \r\ncommunity, the small island developing States (SIDS) \r\nhave had very mixed results in achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. Going forward, we \r\nand our development partners must examine where \r\ngains have been made and where efforts have been \r\nunsuccessful and identify country-specific priorities in \r\norder to achieve the MDGs. \r\n A/65/PV.19\r\n \r\n23 10-55122 \r\n \r\n The threat of climate change, particularly sea-\r\nlevel rise, continues to hang over us all. While some of \r\nus are more vulnerable than others, we must work in \r\nconcert as a responsible international family to \r\nmitigate the adverse effects of this global phenomenon. \r\nIn this context, I reiterate the common call of the small \r\nisland developing States: that the promised fast-track \r\nfunding from the international community to finance \r\nclimate change adaptation and mitigation measures be \r\ndelivered without delay. \r\n Through the Pacific small island developing \r\nStates, Fiji pledges to assist in securing increased \r\nrepresentation of the Pacific island countries in the \r\nUnited Nations system. The aim is to also increase \r\nemployment of Pacific Island nationals within the \r\nUnited Nations Secretariat and its affiliated bodies. \r\n Here, I should add that Fiji is playing a prominent \r\nrole in the International Telecommunication Union \r\n(ITU). I note that only a few days ago the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, accepted a report on \r\ndigitalization, including accessibility to broadband. In \r\nthis area Fiji has also embarked on its own initiative \r\nfor accessibility to and improvement in, \r\ntelecommunications and information technology. This \r\nincludes the process of finalizing a national policy on \r\nbroadband and spectrum management. We therefore \r\nappreciate the Secretary-General’s initiative in this \r\nrespect and urge him to carefully consider the report \r\nand provide impetus at the global level through the \r\nUnited Nations. Improved technology and e-access will \r\nprovide that trajectory in meeting the MDGs and \r\nimproving the lives of all our peoples. \r\n As one of the founding signatories of the United \r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea, Fiji has \r\nkept its oceanic obligations at the core of its foreign \r\npolicy. Fiji therefore follows, and also expects fellow \r\nMember States to adhere to, the legal regime of the \r\nexclusive economic zone that encompasses sovereign \r\nrights. \r\n Since it is the Year of Biodiversity, we call on the \r\nInternational Seabed Authority to be vigilant in \r\nsafeguarding the environmental integrity of the world’s \r\nseabed. Within this context, one of the great challenges \r\nfor Pacific small island developing States is to be \r\neffective in conserving the Pacific Ocean’s fish stocks. \r\nThey are critical to our livelihoods, our economies. \r\nCountries that overexploit these fish stocks must be \r\ninformed that the practice is unsustainable. As owners, \r\ninvestors and harvesters, we should follow and adhere \r\nto international law and chart a path to sustain stocks \r\nfor the benefit of all. \r\n What I say today is that we must recognize that \r\nmeaningful dialogue is essential — within our \r\nrespective countries, within our respective regions and \r\nin the world as a whole. Seeking to achieve resolutions \r\nand solutions through dialogue is the way forward. In \r\nthe true spirit of international cooperation, we must at \r\nall times, as sovereign States in our community of \r\nnations, develop and maintain relationships based on \r\nrespect, dignity and equality. We must also decide on \r\nissues and matters before this august Assembly based \r\non merit, justice and international law. \r\n Once again, I congratulate you, Mr. President, on \r\nyour election and offer my best wishes for a productive \r\nsixty-fifth session of the General Assembly. \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of the Fiji Islands for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Josaia V. Bainimarama, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of the Fiji Islands, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by His Excellency Mr. Pakalitha \r\nBethuel Mosisili, Prime Minister and Minister \r\nfor Defense and Public Service of the Kingdom \r\nof Lesotho \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Defense and Public Service of the \r\nKingdom of Lesotho. \r\n Mr. Pakalitha Bethuel Mosisili, Prime Minister \r\nand Minister for Defense and Public Service of \r\nthe Kingdom of Lesotho, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I have great \r\npleasure in welcoming to the United Nations His \r\nExcellency Mr. Pakalitha Bethuel Mosisili, Prime \r\nMinister and Minister for Defense and Public Service \r\nof the Kingdom of Lesotho, and inviting him to address \r\nthe General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Mosisili (Lesotho): Allow me, Sir, to \r\ncongratulate you on your well-deserved election to the \r\noffice of President at the sixty-fifth session of the \r\nA/65/PV.19  \r\n \r\n10-55122 24 \r\n \r\nGeneral Assembly. Your career as a leader and \r\ndiplomat speaks for itself. I assure you of my \r\ndelegation’s support during your tenure of office. I \r\nshould also commend your predecessor, His Excellency \r\nMr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, for a job well done. \r\n The choice of theme for this session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, namely, reaffirming the central role \r\nof the United Nations in global governance, is not only \r\napt but inspired. The founding of the United Nations \r\nwas propelled by the determination to save future \r\ngenerations from the scourge of war. It was driven by \r\nthe desire to reaffirm faith in fundamental human \r\nrights, the rule of law and, not least, to promote social \r\nprogress and better standards of life in larger freedom. \r\n For the past 65 years, this Assembly of nations \r\nhas been convening here every year in pursuit of the \r\nlofty ideals of the United Nations. Yet for 65 years, the \r\nachievement of these ideals has eluded us. \r\nUnilateralism and war remain the order of the day. \r\nDisrespect for international law, vast economic \r\ninequities, injustice and suppression of basic freedoms \r\nare the challenges we face today, just as we did 65 \r\nyears ago. In addition, we have climate change, \r\nfinancial and economic crises, terrorism and religious \r\nintolerance to contend with. Needless to mention, such \r\nchallenges have heightened threats to world stability \r\nand international peace and security. \r\n Let the events of the first decade of this \r\nmillennium be a lesson for all of us to learn and \r\ntreasure. We have learned a lesson in the futility of \r\nunilateralism, intolerance and war; that selfishness in \r\nworld relations is suicidal. We have learned a lesson in \r\nthe value of collective decision-making and inclusive \r\ndevelopment, if our planet and its inhabitants are to \r\nsurvive. These lessons say to us that mankind must turn \r\naway from the path of self-destruction. The route to \r\npeace and stability is clear to all of us, yet we continue \r\nto lose ourselves in the wilderness of instability and \r\npoverty, because we are blinded by ulterior motives. \r\n If we value the lessons of the past decade, we \r\nmust accept that war is brutal, destructive and \r\nunacceptable. The founding fathers of the United \r\nNations were right when they affirmed the centrality of \r\nthe United Nations in global decision-making and \r\ngovernance. We must admit that great injustices are \r\nbeing committed during our times and that human \r\nrights are being trampled upon as we stand by silently. \r\n In this regard, for decades now, the people of \r\nWestern Sahara, Cuba and Palestine have been calling \r\non this august body for help in reversing the injustices, \r\nhumiliation and atrocities that are visited upon them by \r\ncolonialism, unilateral economic blockades and brutal \r\noccupation. Even today, the people of these territories \r\nare still calling. They are calling to you. Will you listen \r\nand respond, or will you look or walk away? Surely we \r\ncannot condone injustice and yet hope for peace. \r\nSustainable peace can only be based on justice and the \r\nprotection of basic freedoms for all. \r\n By the same token, Zimbabwe must be freed from \r\nunilateral sanctions, as her people work together under \r\nthe unity Government to determine their own future \r\nunder the leadership of their own choice. In addition, \r\nexternal interests must not be allowed to take \r\nprecedence over the desire of the people of Madagascar \r\nfor democracy and stability in their country. \r\n Somalia is a festering wound on the African \r\ncontinent. Let us rise to the appeal that was made by \r\nthe President of the Transitional Federal Government \r\nof Somalia to the Assembly a few days ago. He urged \r\nus to assist the people of Somalia to join the \r\ninternational movement for the achievement of peace, \r\nthe rule of law and the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(see A/65/PV.16). \r\n Planet Earth is the only world in which we can \r\nlive in shared prosperity and peace. In the wake of the \r\ndevastating effects of climate change, we all converged \r\nin Copenhagen with optimism, but left with mixed \r\nfeelings following lack of international consensus and \r\nthe necessary political will. In the meantime, climate \r\nchange continues to wreak havoc, particularly in those \r\nvulnerable developing countries that do not have the \r\nmeans to adapt to or mitigate the impacts of global \r\nwarming. Lesotho signed the Copenhagen Accord \r\nbecause we believed that it represented a step forward, \r\neven though it did not fully satisfy our aspirations. It is \r\nour hope that, the forthcoming Conference in Cancún, \r\nMexico, will achieve international consensus, leading \r\nto a legally binding regime on the management of \r\nclimate change. \r\n The just-ended High-level Meeting on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals confirmed to us that \r\nthe recent economic and financial downturn has \r\ndisrupted our strategies for achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals by 2015. Despite this fact, we \r\nappeal to our development partners to fulfil their \r\n A/65/PV.19\r\n \r\n25 10-55122 \r\n \r\nofficial development assistance commitments to help \r\naccelerate our progress in the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. \r\n The world is still grappling with terrorism. For as \r\nlong as this menace exists, there will not be peace on \r\nEarth. Terrorism knows no boundaries and does not \r\nrespect human life. There is neither a country nor an \r\nindividual who can claim immunity from terrorism. \r\nTerrorist groups are benefiting from globalization by \r\ndecentralizing their operations, building new \r\npartnerships with armed groups, and using advanced \r\ntechnology to further their cause. This menace will not \r\nbe eradicated until we address the root causes, not the \r\nsymptoms, of terrorism. \r\n Religious intolerance is closely related to \r\nterrorism. We must acknowledge that religious \r\ntolerance is a prerequisite to international peace and \r\nstability, and that the world’s diversity of cultures and \r\nreligions must be respected and tolerated, as it \r\nrepresents the strength and collective heritage of \r\nhumankind. Cultivation of the culture of religious \r\ntolerance must be inscribed high on the agenda of the \r\ninternational community. \r\n One of the fundamental conditions for \r\nmaintaining international peace and security is our \r\ncommitment to the disarmament and non-proliferation \r\nagenda. More than six decades after the founding of the \r\nUnited Nations, disarmament sadly remains a major \r\nchallenge for the international community. Today we \r\nsee a steadily growing list of de facto nuclear-weapon \r\nStates. Proliferation of the weapons of mass \r\ndestruction must stop. So must the development of new \r\ngenerations of nuclear weapons by nuclear-capable \r\nStates. We must strive for a nuclear-weapon-free \r\nworld. It is the responsibility of those States to stop \r\nthreatening the use of nuclear weapons as an option in \r\nthe pursuit of their foreign policy interests. Lesotho \r\nwill continue to join hands with all peace-loving \r\nnations to support international disarmament and \r\nnon-proliferation regimes. \r\n While the international community has registered \r\nsome successes in consolidating peace in some parts of \r\nthe world, a significantly large number of conflicts \r\nremain unresolved. Some of these conflicts are in \r\nAfrica. As African leaders, we purposefully declared \r\n2010 as the Year of Peace and Security in Africa. We \r\nresolved to find African solutions to African problems. \r\nHowever, we have acknowledged our shortcomings in \r\nterms of capacity in peacekeeping and peacebuilding. \r\nConsequently, we look to the international community \r\nto complement our efforts and resources in this regard. \r\nConflict-affected countries must also have the \r\nnecessary political will to accommodate and facilitate \r\nlegitimate external intervention that is intended to \r\nresolve conflict. At the same time, they must not \r\nabandon their primary responsibility as Governments \r\nto protect all their citizens. \r\n In conclusion, it is my considered view that all \r\nthese challenges can be overcome, if we accept that the \r\nUnited Nations is a place where a better and more \r\nsecure life for humankind must be championed. But its \r\nstructures should be reformed to efficiently fulfil this \r\nnoble mandate. Multilateral diplomacy should supplant \r\nthe traditional unilateral path in the resolution of \r\ndisputes. The United Nations must not be held hostage \r\nto the desires of any single country or group of States. \r\nIts actions should reflect as wide a consensus of \r\nMember States as possible. \r\n Let us continue to reaffirm the central role of the \r\nUnited Nations in global governance. Let us remember \r\nthat might can never be right and can never defeat \r\ncollective resolve. It is only then that collectively we \r\nshall be able to promote progress and better standards \r\nof life in larger freedom. \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime \r\nMinister and Minister for Defense and Public Service \r\nof the Kingdom of Lesotho for the statement he has \r\njust made. \r\n Mr. Pakalitha Bethuel Mosisili, Prime Minister \r\nand Minister for Defence and Public Service of \r\nthe Kingdom of Lesotho, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi, \r\nPrime Minister, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nand Minister for Finance of the Independent \r\nState of Samoa \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the Prime Minister, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Finance \r\nof the Independent State of Samoa. \r\nA/65/PV.19  \r\n \r\n10-55122 26 \r\n \r\n Mr. Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi, Prime Minister, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for \r\nFinance of the Independent State of Samoa, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I have great \r\npleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Tuilaepa \r\nSailele Malielegaoi, Prime Minister, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs and Minister for Finance of the \r\nIndependent State of Samoa, and inviting him to \r\naddress the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Malielegaoi (Samoa): Our world continues \r\nto change in profound ways. Technological advances \r\nhave accelerated globalization, bringing diverse \r\nchallenges and new agendas. The magnitude of today’s \r\nthreats requires holistic solutions with a multilateral \r\napproach. No one country, however powerful, can meet \r\nthem on its own. Nations of the world need to work \r\ntogether to forge a coordinated approach. It is a shared \r\nresponsibility, and the problems will be solved \r\nsuccessfully only through effective collaboration. \r\n To meet the challenges, a vibrant institution that \r\nis up to the task and responds to the imperatives of our \r\ntime is required. Sixty-five years ago, the world \r\ncreated the United Nations as the legitimate authority \r\nfor our collective peace and security. International \r\ncooperation and solidarity formed the bedrock of its \r\nexistence. To this day, the United Nations provides the \r\nonly viable framework and legitimate authority for \r\nacting globally to address issues that transcend national \r\nborders. \r\n As a world institution, the United Nations needs \r\nto pay attention to its ability to offer itself as a safe \r\nplace, not just for its traditional stakeholders — the \r\nMember States — but also for international \r\norganizations, the business community and civil \r\nsociety. Partnerships with those sectors of society are \r\nan important vehicle through which the United Nations \r\nhelps the development of individual countries, and they \r\nallow our Organization to achieve, in large measure, \r\nthe key objectives of its mission. \r\n Our Organization is not without shortcomings, \r\nand that is why we must constantly redefine its role \r\nand adapt it to respond to the needs of the world that it \r\nexists to serve. That is why, with regard to Security \r\nCouncil reform, Samoa has not wavered over the years \r\nfrom its principled support for an expanded Council in \r\nboth the permanent and non-permanent memberships. \r\nThe economic and political liberalization has changed \r\nthe contemporary geopolitical realities and landscape, \r\nand the therefore enlargement of the Security Council \r\nin both categories is essential for true multilateralism \r\nand for the Council’s integrity and credibility. \r\n Equally vital is the ongoing reform to give \r\nprominence to the General Assembly as the truly \r\ndeliberative and representative body in the global \r\ndecision-making process, giving voice and \r\nrepresentation to all Member States, irrespective of a \r\ncountry’s wealth and might. That was the basis for \r\nSamoa becoming a Member of this world body over \r\n30 years ago. \r\n The threat of climate change is grave, having dire \r\nimplications for global peace and security. It threatens \r\nto intensify existing drivers of conflict in a way that \r\ncould roll back development across many countries. \r\nThe causes of climate change and those responsible for \r\nthem, the multifaceted threats it poses and the solutions \r\nto mitigate and adapt against its negative impacts are \r\nwell documented and duly validated by science and \r\nreal life experiences. \r\n A new climate change instrument is currently \r\nunder negotiation. Progress has been painfully slow, \r\nwhich contradicts the gravity and urgency of the \r\nproblem. Sadly, vested national interests are taking \r\nprecedence over concern for a global and just solution. \r\nIntransigent positions are being advanced to force \r\nconcessions and to frustrate progress. For a privileged \r\nfew, their fortunate geographies and resource \r\nendowments may persuade them to feel that climate \r\nchange is not an urgent priority and that they can \r\nafford to wait out the negotiation of a legally binding \r\nclimate change agreement for as long as it takes. \r\n There is no such luxury for island nations, which \r\nparadoxically are at the front line of the destructive \r\nimpacts of climate change but are least responsible for \r\nits causes and often least able to respond and adapt. \r\nIndeed, for some island nations, climate change \r\nthreatens their very existence and survival as sovereign \r\nStates. \r\n With the stakes so high, climate change is \r\nunquestionably an immediate and urgent priority for \r\nthe world. It would be a big mistake for any country to \r\nthink otherwise. Similarly, it would be unhelpful to \r\nview climate change simply as an environmental issue. \r\nClimate change is cross-cutting and endangers \r\neconomic and social development, with serious \r\nimplications for the peace and security of our \r\n A/65/PV.19\r\n \r\n27 10-55122 \r\n \r\ncommunities, whether its impact is national or \r\ntransborder. \r\n Any new climate change treaty, no matter how \r\nambitious, comprehensive and binding, will be \r\nineffectual without full membership and the \r\nparticipation of all United Nations Member States, \r\nespecially those with the obligation to participate. \r\nInaction should not be blamed on the absence of \r\nsolutions to reverse the impacts of climate change but \r\nrather on the unwillingness of some countries to be part \r\nof a unified global solution. \r\n The much publicized fast-track funding \r\nannounced in Copenhagen to meet the adaptation needs \r\nof the most vulnerable countries has become a best-\r\nkept secret. Information on how much of the pledges \r\nhave been honoured and disbursed, and to whom, has \r\nbeen scarce. When available, the information is vague \r\nand seems bereft of coordination. Yet the fast-track \r\nresources were commitments made at the highest \r\npolitical level, in recognition at Copenhagen of the \r\npressing need for an interim measure to help the most \r\nvulnerable countries avert further harmful effects of \r\nclimate change, pending the conclusion of a negotiated \r\nagreement. \r\n The uncertainty as to the legal form, content and \r\ncompletion date of a new treaty makes it a moral \r\nimperative for the promised fast-track resources to be \r\nmade available without delay and with clear, simplified \r\nguidelines to ensure that the intended recipients do \r\nindeed secure assistance. \r\n Between now and the conference in Cancún, \r\nStates parties should move beyond rhetoric and commit \r\nto reaching an agreement, as a minimum, on those \r\nbuilding blocks of the Bali Action Plan where \r\nnegotiations have reached a level of maturity and \r\nconvergence on agreed compromises. We cannot \r\ncontinue to defer making the hard decisions. We need \r\nto reclaim the credibility of the process. Every day of \r\nindecisiveness disproportionately increases the risks to \r\nvulnerable countries that are experiencing more \r\nfrequent and severe climate change impacts. \r\n We cannot afford to leave Cancún empty-handed. \r\nConcrete results must be achieved, not only to give our \r\npeople confidence that there are substantive responses \r\nto protect against climate change, but at the same time \r\nto strengthen our belief that our United Nations can \r\ndeliver a legally binding agreement. \r\n Our global security is at risk. Terrorism \r\ntranscends international borders in its attack on \r\nuniversal values. Like other international threats, \r\nterrorism is an area of mutual concern that demands a \r\ncollective response. Terrorist acts committed under \r\nwhatever pretext are deeply deplorable and should be \r\nstrongly condemned. Those who find self-glorification \r\nin the atrocious crimes that they commit should not \r\nexpect any sympathy or be provided safe havens to \r\nhide. \r\n The non-proliferation of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction and the risk of their acquisition by \r\nterrorists, criminals and others should continue to be a \r\ntop priority of the United Nations. Nuclear terrorism is \r\none of the most challenging threats to international \r\npeace and security. A world without nuclear weapons is \r\na safer, more secure and prosperous place to live. \r\n We have heard from this podium of the renewed \r\nefforts of the major nuclear-weapons Powers to restart \r\nthe reduction of their nuclear arsenals. That is \r\nencouraging, but we believe that the only absolute \r\nguarantee against the use and threat of use of nuclear \r\nweapons is through their total elimination. In that \r\nconnection, we are comforted by the announcement of \r\nthe United States Government earlier in the year that it \r\nwas moving towards ratification of the Pacific region’s \r\nnuclear-free-zone treaty. \r\n The peacekeeping work of the United Nations \r\ncontributes, in large measure, to the stability of \r\ncountries and regions where it has a presence. It is one \r\nof the Organization’s growing and most visible \r\nmandates and has the full support of my Government. \r\nSamoa’s policewomen and policemen are serving side \r\nby side with officers of other contributing countries in \r\npeacekeeping missions in Timor-Leste, the Sudan and \r\nDarfur. In our Pacific region, we continue to honour \r\nour commitment to the Regional Assistance Mission to \r\nSolomon Islands, under the aegis of the Pacific Islands \r\nForum, through our police contingents. \r\n Samoa welcomes the recent initiative, brokered \r\nby the United States, for direct negotiations between \r\nthe leaders of Israel and Palestine to advance the two-\r\nState solution, with the nations of Israel and Palestine \r\nliving alongside each other in peace and security. We \r\nremain hopeful that with the genuine support and \r\nunderstanding of other leaders in the region, this will \r\nnot be another missed opportunity. \r\nA/65/PV.19  \r\n \r\n10-55122 28 \r\n \r\n This Wednesday marks the first anniversary of \r\nthe tsunami that devastated my country, resulting in a \r\nheavy loss of life, injury and destruction of property. \r\nLife will never be the same for the survivors and those \r\nwho lost loved ones. However, a sense of normalcy has \r\nreturned and stability has been re-established. \r\n With the generous support of our development \r\npartners, the reconstruction phase is progressing well \r\nand the families and villages affected have been \r\nresettled on higher ground inland, away from the coast. \r\nThe necessary infrastructure and utilities for the new \r\nsettlements are well on their way towards completion. \r\nThe progress achieved would not have been possible \r\nwithout the kindness and understanding of Samoa’s \r\ndevelopment partners and the international community. \r\n Of significant importance to Samoa in its efforts \r\nto reinvigorate the economy following the dual impacts \r\nof the tsunami devastation and the financial crisis is the \r\nrecent Assembly resolution (resolution 64/295) \r\ngranting Samoa three more years, to 2014, to put in \r\nplace a transition strategy to guarantee the \r\nsustainability of its economic performance after its \r\ngraduation from least developed country (LDC) status \r\nin that year. Samoa’s post-tsunami experience and the \r\npassage of the consensus LDC resolution are important \r\ndemonstrations of the close and warm relations that my \r\ncountry enjoys with United Nations Members. \r\n At the bilateral and personal level, my \r\nGovernment has already acknowledged the timely and \r\ntremendous support of all who contributed during the \r\nemergency and in the recovery and rebuilding phases \r\nin the aftermath of the tsunami. The United Nations \r\nmembership was similarly thanked when our LDC \r\nresolution was adopted. Nevertheless, on behalf of the \r\npeople and Government of Samoa, I would like here in \r\nthe General Assembly to again convey our sincere \r\nappreciation to all our development partners, including \r\nAustralia, New Zealand, Japan, the People’s Republic \r\nof China, the European Union, the United States of \r\nAmerica, our Pacific neighbours, the United Nations \r\nand its related and specialized agencies, and others too \r\nmany to mention for their generosity and kindness to \r\nSamoa. We are very grateful. \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime \r\nMinister, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for \r\nFinance of the Independent State of Samoa for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi, Prime Minister, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for \r\nFinance of the Independent State of Samoa, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Ms. Antonella Mularoni, Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of San Marino \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of San Marino. \r\n Ms. Antonella Mularoni, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of San Marino, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I have great \r\npleasure in welcoming Her Excellency Ms. Antonella \r\nMularoni, Prime Minister of the Republic of San \r\nMarino, and inviting her to address the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Ms. Mularoni (San Marino): I wish to \r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. We are \r\nconfident that your considerable expertise in the field \r\nof foreign policy and economics will be decisive for \r\nthe success of all sectors of United Nations activity. I \r\nalso wish to thank the outgoing President, His \r\nExcellency Ali Abdussalam Treki, for the excellent \r\nwork carried out during the Assembly’s sixty-fourth \r\nsession. \r\n I would like to express special thanks to the \r\nSecretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \r\nfor his energy and extraordinary determination in \r\nleading this Organization. In particular, San Marino \r\nappreciates the interest he has shown towards all \r\nMember countries, without any distinction, regardless \r\nof their size. My Government has particularly \r\nappreciated the Secretary-General’s commitment in the \r\nfield of reforms and his constant presence in all \r\ninternational politically relevant situations and in \r\nemergency situations. His presence in Haiti and \r\nPakistan in the days following the terrible events that \r\nwe all witnessed demonstrates not only the \r\ndetermination to affirm United Nations presence during \r\ncrises, but also a personal and particular sensitivity \r\ntowards tragedies deeply affecting people. \r\n At a time characterized by major global \r\nchallenges that the international community is called \r\nupon to face, the United Nations reform process \r\n A/65/PV.19\r\n \r\n29 10-55122 \r\n \r\nbecomes fundamental for future world stability and \r\nmust remain the target of all our efforts. We have the \r\nduty to guarantee the full effectiveness of the \r\nOrganization’s activities, with a view to preserving and \r\nstrengthening its essential value as a point of reference \r\nfor the international community and for any individual. \r\nWe cannot afford to see the role of the United Nations \r\nweakened through inability to reach agreement on the \r\nmeasures to be taken to improve its functioning. \r\n I have the pleasure to reiterate again this year the \r\nsupport San Marino grants to the revitalization process \r\nof the General Assembly. In that regard, I wish to thank \r\nArgentina and Slovenia, Co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group on the revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly, for the Group’s recently approved report \r\n(A/64/903), which is the outcome of considerable \r\nefforts and many informal meetings with the States \r\nMembers of the United Nations. \r\n This reform is particularly important for my \r\ncountry, since the General Assembly is the most \r\ndemocratic body of the United Nations and, as such, \r\nthe most effective and sometimes the only forum where \r\na small State can express its opinions. San Marino \r\ntherefore hopes that through this reform, the Assembly \r\nmay work more efficiently and improve its relations \r\nwith the other main bodies of the United Nations to \r\navoid duplication of activities and effectively \r\nimplement its resolutions. \r\n The Republic of San Marino has been following \r\nwith interest the Security Council reform process since \r\n1994, and it is grateful to the Afghan Chair of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Council reform for \r\nthe important work he has carried out this year and for \r\nthe wisdom and impartiality with which he has \r\npresided over negotiations aimed at reaching the \r\nbroadest possible agreement. San Marino believes that \r\nthe reform should lead to a more democratic, \r\nresponsible, transparent and efficient Security Council. \r\nThe reform should also bring about a more balanced \r\nrelationship between the Security Council and the \r\nGeneral Assembly, as well as more effective \r\ncooperation with the Secretariat. Those objectives can \r\nbe achieved only through a permanent dialogue among \r\nStates and increased flexibility in the respective \r\npositions. \r\n I wish to congratulate you, Mr. President, on the \r\nchoice of the theme for this year’s session — the role \r\nof the United Nations in global governance. That is a \r\nparticularly complex subject, since it concerns the \r\nglobal threats that affect the destinies of our peoples in \r\nan increasingly direct way: climate change and \r\nbiodiversity, the economic, financial and employment \r\ncrises, food security, public health, disarmament and \r\nthe proliferation of weapons, and the fight against \r\nterrorism. \r\n Today, the theme of global governance is \r\ninevitably linked to a new way of conceiving \r\nmultilateralism and to a new form of international \r\ncooperation, one that acknowledges the interdependence \r\nof the problems we face at the international, national and \r\nregional levels. We have learned from the crises of the \r\nlast few years that it is necessary to adopt an integrated \r\nand comprehensive approach, more efficient \r\nmechanisms for coordinating our policies, and a global \r\nand coordinated course of action. \r\n San Marino believes that the United Nations has a \r\nduty to be at the core of that process and to play a \r\nleading role in managing global governance, not only \r\nbecause of its deeply democratic nature, with universal \r\nparticipation and undisputed legitimacy, but also \r\nbecause — thanks to the richness and diversity of \r\ncultures and traditions represented here — it can adopt \r\nan approach that harmonizes the interests of the entire \r\ninternational community and aims at sustainable \r\ndevelopment for all peoples. \r\n Last year, the world economy suffered a \r\ndevastating financial crisis, the consequences of which \r\nare still evident to all. Today, unemployment has \r\nreached extremely high levels in many countries. \r\nIncreases in the prices of food products and persistent \r\ninequalities contribute to higher poverty rates and \r\ncause high social tensions and violence. The global \r\neconomic and financial crisis has severely hit every \r\ncountry in the world, with no distinctions, thus \r\nbecoming one of today’s major challenges for our \r\nOrganization as well. Some have been able to \r\nwithstand the crisis, while for many others it is \r\nunfortunately still a very immediate problem, \r\ninfluencing all decisions. \r\n Despite the gradual recovery of the global \r\neconomy this year, it is fundamental that we always \r\ncoordinate policies, and coordinate them effectively, \r\nwith a view to guaranteeing balanced, inclusive and \r\nsubstantial growth. In that regard, San Marino \r\nrecognizes the essential role played by the Group of 20 \r\n(G-20), which in 2009 was able to prevent a global \r\nA/65/PV.19  \r\n \r\n10-55122 30 \r\n \r\neconomic depression by taking coordinated and timely \r\naction. However, the G-20 decision-making process \r\nshould be even more inclusive and transparent, so that \r\nits decisions can translate into effective action at the \r\nglobal level. That requires developing specific \r\nmechanisms through which the interests, concerns and \r\naspirations of countries outside the G-20 can be taken \r\ninto account, with particular reference to developing \r\ncountries, in order to favour G-20 actions \r\ncomplementary to those of the United Nations. \r\n Over the last two years, the Republic of San \r\nMarino, well aware of the interconnectedness of global \r\neconomic and financial policies, has intensified its \r\nefforts to make its legislative instruments and practices \r\nrelating to transparency and international cooperation \r\ncompliant with international standards established by \r\nthe Organization for Economic Cooperation and \r\nDevelopment and MONEYVAL. Within a short period, \r\nlaws to combat money-laundering and terrorist \r\nfinancing were adopted, banking and financial \r\nsupervision services were reorganized and amendments \r\nwere made to company legislation, eliminating \r\nanonymous companies. \r\n The San Marino Government expresses its \r\nsatisfaction with resolution 64/289, on United Nations \r\nsystem-wide coherence, which the General Assembly \r\nunanimously adopted on 2 July. That resolution, the \r\nresult of year-long negotiations, is an historic \r\nachievement for the reform process of the United \r\nNations, in particular for strengthening the entire \r\nsystem. It provides for a higher degree of coordination, \r\nefficiency and transparency, while avoiding \r\nfragmentation, waste, duplication of tasks and effort. \r\n A fundamental element of that resolution is the \r\nestablishment of the new United Nations Entity for \r\nGender Equality and the Empowerment of Women, to be \r\nknown as UN Women, which will become operational \r\non 1 January 2011. The mandates of four existing bodies \r\nconcerned with the promotion of women’s rights will be \r\ntransferred to this new entity, which will strengthen, in \r\nterms of capability, efficiency and responsibility, the \r\nUnited Nations system in the field of gender equality \r\nand the empowerment of women. \r\n The Republic of San Marino pays special \r\nattention to this subject and over the last few years has \r\npromoted several national initiatives making women in \r\nSan Marino aware of their rights and of the State \r\nprotection mechanisms available to them. At the \r\ninternational level, San Marino has joined several \r\ncampaigns aimed at raising awareness of women’s \r\nrights among the public and national authorities, such \r\nas the Unite to End Violence Against Women \r\ncampaign, launched by the Secretary-General in 2008. \r\n I would like to underline on this occasion the \r\nfundamental importance of the efforts of the \r\ninternational community, as well as pressure exerted by \r\ncivil society, to achieve higher standards of human \r\nrights protection. Moreover, we cannot forget that \r\nwomen and children are always the most vulnerable \r\nsection of society in situations where rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms are violated. In several \r\ncountries, women have to face very difficult situations: \r\nmany of their rights are often violated and the authors \r\nof the violations go unpunished. The international \r\ncommunity must spare no effort to ensure that the \r\ndignity, rights and fundamental freedoms of all human \r\nbeings are duly protected. \r\n San Marino also believes that the international \r\ncommunity should be responsible for working as \r\neffectively as possible to combat human trafficking. \r\nToday that modern form of slavery still affects millions \r\nof people, the majority of whom are also women and \r\nchildren. The Republic of San Marino attaches the \r\nutmost importance to the adoption last July of \r\nresolution 64/293, which contains the United Nations \r\nGlobal Plan of Action against Trafficking in Persons. \r\n The collective commitment to combating \r\ntrafficking in persons led to the adoption of that \r\nresolution, the result of long consultations and complex \r\nnegotiations. San Marino guarantees its support for this \r\ninitiative and will cooperate with all Member States in \r\norder to implement the Plan of Action. This initiative is \r\nparticularly important to us, since this year we ratified \r\nthe United Nations Convention against Transnational \r\nOrganized Crime, its Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and \r\nPunish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and \r\nChildren, and its Protocol against the Smuggling of \r\nMigrants by Land, Sea and Air. \r\n As underlined in the Secretary-General’s report \r\n“Keeping the promise” (A/64/665), the Millennium \r\nDeclaration and the Millennium Development Goals \r\nhave brought about a slow but progressive \r\nimprovement in the fight against extreme poverty, \r\nhunger and disease and in the promotion of gender \r\nequality, education and environmental sustainability. \r\n A/65/PV.19\r\n \r\n31 10-55122 \r\n \r\nHowever, the report outlines that progress has been \r\ndiscontinuous and uneven from one region to another. \r\n We have recently witnessed a series of severe and \r\nunprecedented crises, including the world economic \r\nand financial crisis, the food and energy crisis, the one \r\nrelated to climate change, humanitarian crises — \r\nincluding the recent earthquake in Haiti and the huge \r\nfloods in Pakistan — and those caused by the increased \r\nnumber of conflicts. After having obtained good \r\nresults, we are now experiencing a severe setback, and \r\nan even more structured commitment will be necessary \r\nto overcome those obstacles and achieve the Goals by \r\n2015. \r\n The Republic of San Marino expresses its \r\nsatisfaction with the General Assembly’s High-level \r\nPlenary Meeting on the Millennium Development \r\nGoals, which recently concluded. The outcome \r\ndocument of that meeting (resolution 65/1) aims at \r\ndeveloping effective strategies for action and, most of \r\nall, at renewing the commitment and responsibility of \r\neach country to achieving the Goals set. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to reiterate the strong \r\ncommitment of the Republic of San Marino in favour \r\nof the implementation of the ideals of the United \r\nNations and of the principles enshrined in its Charter. \r\nWe will guarantee our support to all initiatives \r\nnecessary to reach such an aim. \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of San Marino for the \r\nstatement she has just made. \r\n Ms. Antonella Mularoni, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of San Marino, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Abbas El Fassi, Prime Minister \r\nof the Kingdom of Morocco \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the Prime Minister of the \r\nKingdom of Morocco. \r\n Mr. Abbas El Fassi, Prime Minister of the \r\nKingdom of Morocco, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I have great \r\npleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Abbas \r\nEl Fassi, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Morocco, \r\nand inviting him to address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. El Fassi (Morocco) (spoke in Arabic): His \r\nMajesty Mohammed VI, the King of Morocco, has \r\nhonoured me by asking me to deliver his statement to \r\nthe General Assembly. \r\n  “Allow me, at the outset, to congratulate \r\nyou, Mr. President, on being elected to preside \r\nover the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth \r\nsession, and to commend your predecessor, \r\nMr. Ali Treki, on having given fresh dynamism to \r\nthe proceedings of the Assembly. I would also \r\nlike to express my deep appreciation to His \r\nExcellency the Secretary-General, who spares no \r\neffort to enhance the role of the United Nations. \r\n  “This session, which is being held 10 years \r\nafter the Millennium Summit, is a great \r\nopportunity for us to agree on a consensual vision \r\nto steer our joint action for the years to come and \r\nto reiterate our commitment to the three basic \r\naxes underlying that vision, namely, security and \r\nstability, development and prosperity, and \r\nadvancement of human rights and human dignity. \r\nThose priorities form the bedrock of the new \r\ninternational agenda. This important meeting \r\ntherefore provides us a good opportunity to \r\nreassert our commitment to tackling those \r\npriorities and to reiterate our determination to \r\npromote international cooperation and lay solid \r\ngroundwork for a new world where safety and \r\nsolidarity prevail. \r\n  “Morocco, which firmly believes in the \r\nimportant position of the United Nations as the \r\nsymbol of universal values and international \r\nlegitimacy, has worked tirelessly to give the \r\nOrganization active and concrete support, to \r\npromote its principles and to contribute to the \r\nachievement of its objectives. Indeed, my country \r\nhas also actively sought to ensure that its national \r\npriorities are in line with issues on the \r\ninternational agenda. \r\n  “Peacekeeping was the main objective \r\nbehind the creation of the United Nations, which \r\nis playing a key role for all mankind. From this \r\nrostrum, the Kingdom of Morocco calls on the \r\ninternational community to increase its \r\ninvolvement and work for the settlement of all \r\ndisputes — whether overt or covert — that strain \r\nA/65/PV.19  \r\n \r\n10-55122 32 \r\n \r\nrelations between neighbouring States and \r\nhamper the indispensable integration of their \r\neconomies, particularly in Africa. \r\n  “To foster healthier relations in our \r\nMaghreb region, we submitted an autonomy \r\ninitiative to the United Nations in 2007 with a \r\nview to bringing an end to the artificial dispute \r\nover the recovery by Morocco of its southern \r\nprovinces. That bold, innovative initiative has \r\nreceived the support of the international \r\ncommunity and the Security Council, which have \r\nrepeatedly described the efforts underlying it as \r\nserious and credible. They have also commended \r\nMorocco’s active steps to facilitate the settlement \r\nof this dispute, which seriously jeopardizes the \r\nintegration of the Arab Maghreb and the \r\nprosperity of the peoples of its five countries. \r\n  “In that context, the Kingdom of Morocco \r\ncalls on the other partners to seize this historic \r\nopportunity and engage in substantive and serious \r\nnegotiations under the auspices of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and his Personal Envoy, to whom we \r\nreiterate our sincere willingness to cooperate. \r\n  “The need to free our region from the yoke \r\nof this dispute, which hampers our joint action, \r\nhas never been greater, not only for us, but also \r\nfor our strategic partners. We must therefore \r\nsettle this dispute, given the numerous pressing \r\nchallenges facing us, especially with respect to \r\nsecurity in the Sahara and Sahel regions and in \r\nthe Mediterranean basin. \r\n  “Achieving peace in the Middle East is not \r\nan impossible goal, nor is the persistence of the \r\nconflict inevitable. The only solution to the \r\nconflict remains that of two States, living side by \r\nside in peace and security. \r\n  “The international community is therefore \r\ncalled upon to support the direct negotiation \r\nprocess taking place under the commendable \r\nauspices of the United States Administration. \r\nThis is a good opportunity to strive to achieve a \r\nfinal settlement, in compliance with international \r\nlegitimacy and the relevant United Nations \r\nresolutions and on the basis of a clear frame of \r\nreference, a comprehensive agenda and a specific \r\ntimetable. \r\n  “As an active player in the peace process, \r\nMorocco is aware that such negotiations must \r\naddress the issue of establishing a fully sovereign \r\nPalestinian State, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its \r\ncapital, as well as the related and complex issues, \r\nand that for negotiations to succeed, unilateral \r\nactions must be avoided and settlement building \r\nmust end, especially in Al-Quds Al-Sharif. \r\n  “As Chair of the Al-Quds Committee, I \r\nhave consistently drawn the attention of the \r\nUnited Nations and of the international \r\ncommunity to the sensitive nature of the issue of \r\nAl-Quds Al-Sharif and to attempts to Judaize that \r\nHoly City and obliterate its character. Al-Quds \r\nmust remain a symbol of coexistence and concord \r\nbetween the monotheistic religions, a city of \r\npeace and of coexistence between the Palestinian \r\nand the Israeli peoples. \r\n “Two days ago, we took stock of the \r\nprogress that has thus far been made in achieving \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. We agreed \r\nthat a combination of crises, including the \r\nadverse effects of climate change, has clearly \r\ndelayed the attainment of most of these Goals in \r\nmany developing countries, particularly on our \r\nAfrican continent. \r\n “With a population of more than 900 \r\nmillion people and natural resources abundant \r\nenough to ensure the continent’s self-sufficiency, \r\nAfrica is indeed capable of enjoying steady \r\ngrowth and development. This potential \r\nnotwithstanding, Africa largely remains on the \r\nsidelines when it comes to foreign direct \r\ninvestment flows, a trend which has been \r\ncompounded further by the global economic and \r\nfinancial crisis. The Kingdom of Morocco \r\ntherefore proposes that the General Assembly \r\nhold a high-level dialogue on investment in \r\nAfrica. \r\n “Similarly, the magnitude of the challenges \r\nposed by globalization requires from the \r\ninternational community urgent, substantial \r\nreforms of the existing international economic \r\ngovernance institutions as well as further \r\nmobilization to lay the foundations for a new, \r\nequitable, balanced and efficient international \r\nenvironmental order that will enable us to \r\n A/65/PV.19\r\n \r\n33 10-55122 \r\n \r\nsafeguard our planet for the sake of current and \r\nfuture generations. \r\n “The Kingdom of Morocco has committed \r\nitself irreversibly to protect and promote human \r\nrights. To this end, it will implement a \r\ncomprehensive strategy based on a participatory \r\napproach which places special emphasis on \r\nhuman resources development and the promise of \r\na dignified life, these being the key elements in \r\nour endeavour to build a democratic society \r\ndedicated to development. \r\n “Accordingly, Morocco has launched a \r\nprogramme of major workshops and reforms. \r\nSubstantial progress has been made towards \r\nexpanding the scope of individual and collective \r\nfreedoms, safeguarding human dignity and \r\npromoting and protecting the rights of its citizens, \r\nespecially those of women, children and people \r\nwith special needs. \r\n “Internationally, Morocco has manifested a \r\ndeep commitment to protecting human rights \r\nsince the establishment of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil and its operational mechanisms. This \r\ncommitment was recognized in March 2010, \r\nwhen Morocco was chosen by the General \r\nAssembly to be a co-facilitator of the review \r\nprocess aimed at charting a renewed vision for \r\nthe Council by putting human capital at the heart \r\nof human resources development and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\n “Morocco will spare no effort to achieve \r\nthis goal and to help develop a shared, \r\nresponsible vision of the true values of human \r\nrights, a vision which excludes empty slogans and \r\nthe tendentious manipulation of lofty objectives. \r\n “The world still has a long way to go before \r\nStates and peoples learn to accept diversity and \r\nmake it a genuine source of spiritual, social and \r\ncultural enrichment. More than a necessity, \r\ndialogue among civilizations has become an \r\nurgent priority. \r\n “Indeed, it is of the utmost importance that \r\nthe United Nations become the standard-bearer of \r\na culture of peace, tolerance and mutual \r\nunderstanding and that it serve as a catalyst for a \r\nnew form of cooperation based on solidarity and \r\ndedicated to achieving dignity, prosperity, well-\r\nbeing and peace for all people everywhere.” \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime \r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Morocco for the statement \r\nhe has just made. \r\n Mr. Abbas El Fassi, Prime Minister of the \r\nKingdom of Morocco, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Sam Condor, Deputy Prime \r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, National \r\nSecurity, Labour, Immigration and Social Security of \r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis. \r\n Mr. Condor (Saint Kitts and Nevis): The \r\nGovernment of Saint Kitts and Nevis has looked \r\nforward to this sixty-fifth session of the General \r\nAssembly with much anticipation. We welcome the \r\nopportunity to share in the usual rich general debate, to \r\nstrengthen existing relationships and to build new ones. \r\n This environment, we believe, facilitates the \r\nexchange of views on issues of common interest. We \r\nlook forward, particularly, to the views on the work \r\nstill ahead in tackling the insidious global challenges. \r\n The tasks I have in mind are: mitigating the \r\nnegative impact of the ongoing economic crisis on our \r\ncountries and peoples, and dealing with its many \r\nimplications for vulnerable small economies like ours; \r\ntackling the prolonged tightening of credit markets; \r\nprotecting the environment from degradation; \r\npromoting human security; and redressing the global \r\nepidemic of interpersonal violence. \r\n These are but a few of the problems with which \r\nGovernments across the globe must grapple. And we \r\nmust do this against a backdrop of uncertainty, while \r\nestablished centres of power are shifting. Governments \r\nmust now reconcile the pursuit of statecraft and \r\nnational interests with rapidly changing and less \r\npredictable relations among States. \r\n Additionally, the 2008 economic and financial \r\ncrises, whose effects are still very real today, have \r\nundermined confidence in our financial market systems \r\nand in what we had hitherto hailed as sound economic \r\nmodels. \r\n Similarly, since the global recession, poverty \r\nranks across the world have been swelling. The \r\nA/65/PV.19  \r\n \r\n10-55122 34 \r\n \r\npercentage of working poor has reached unprecedented \r\nlevels, and millions more, now unemployed, see little \r\nprospect for hope or relief. As a consequence, many \r\nhave lost faith in governance methods and in our long-\r\nestablished financial systems. \r\n We have all become painfully aware that \r\nenvironmental degradation is not country-specific and \r\nthat the actions of individuals and enterprises in one \r\ncountry ultimately harm ecosystems and threaten \r\nlivelihoods in others. Hence, as countries pursue \r\nnational agendas, we need to be mindful of the \r\ncommon interests and ties that connect our societies \r\nand peoples, and we must use every opportunity to \r\nwork towards a realistic convergence of our respective \r\ninterests. \r\n There can be little doubt that we have established \r\na solid foundation that allows us to envision new and \r\nexciting horizons. Reaching these horizons, however, \r\nrequires that, as we contemplate bold initiatives \r\nappropriate for the challenges confronting us, the \r\nUnited Nations must itself be prepared to further \r\ndeepen its engagement with Member States, regional \r\nand national systems, and international financial \r\ninstitutions.  \r\n My delegation believes that this is one way to \r\nhelp provide new opportunities, to facilitate greater \r\naccess to the resources needed to implement national \r\npolicies and meet international obligations. \r\n The United Nations, created out of the ruins of \r\nwar, has over the past six and a half decades, been \r\nprovidentially guided by an unfaltering spirit of \r\npartnership and prevailing common sense. Despite \r\ncountless challenges, that spirit is alive and well today. \r\nWe must therefore work even harder to fulfil the dream \r\nof its architects and to live out their vision. The United \r\nNations, then, must remain that vital nexus, fostering \r\nthe necessary partnerships for the greater good. \r\nPerhaps that would provide us with a more visible \r\npresence on the global stage, furthering the effort to \r\nbuild a better future for us all. We have seen this \r\npartnership in action on the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). We saw it as we worked to address the \r\nglobal financial crisis, which threatened large \r\neconomies and almost crippled the economies of small \r\nisland States. We saw it when Governments and \r\npeoples across the globe came to the assistance of our \r\nbrothers and sisters in disaster-stricken Haiti, the \r\nmagnitude of whose tragedy we had not experienced \r\nbefore in this hemisphere. \r\n In the context of repositioning the United \r\nNations, we began, earlier this month, a process of \r\nreview. It is through improved partnerships that the \r\nUnited Nations has an opportunity to bring \r\ninternational business communities and civil society \r\ntogether with Member States in a more structured way, \r\nallowing for the practical exchange of ideas, the \r\nsharing of expertise and best practices, and the \r\npromotion of development and prosperity. Saint Kitts \r\nand Nevis welcomes such a dialogue and partnership \r\nand recognizes the extent and reach of the United \r\nNations in helping to build capacity, in the face of \r\nchallenges such as the brain drain, which robs \r\ndeveloping countries of their invaluable human \r\nresources. Through such advocacy, the United Nations \r\ncan help also to safeguard gains in social and economic \r\ndevelopment. Saint Kitts and Nevis encourages \r\nMember States to embrace this idea of a multipronged \r\npartnership as a way to bolster development processes \r\nand strengthen global governance and accountability. \r\n Cognizant of the spirit of cooperation, the \r\nGovernment of Saint Kitts and Nevis thanks the \r\nGovernment and people of Taiwan for their continued \r\noutstanding support, international cooperation and \r\ndevelopment assistance over several decades. I \r\nwelcome the recent passage in that country’s \r\nParliament of their international cooperation and \r\ndevelopment law, which incorporates the essence and \r\nprinciples of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness \r\nand the United Nations MDGs. We owe them a debt of \r\ngratitude for their efforts and for sharing their \r\ndevelopment experience through public projects and \r\nsocial, agricultural and private sector development. \r\n We note that, despite being successful before the \r\nWorld Trade Organization dispute settlement body, \r\nAntigua and Barbuda, a fellow CARICOM member \r\nState, has yet to benefit therefrom. In the spirit of \r\ncooperation, we urge the parties involved to seek \r\nquickly to resolve the situation and to arrive at a \r\nnegotiation settlement that is fair and just to Antigua \r\nand Barbuda and its nationals. \r\n 2010 has so far been a year of epic global natural \r\ndisasters. The regularity and ferocity of floods, \r\nhurricanes, typhoons, sea-level rises and other \r\ncatastrophic events are stark reminders of the \r\nconsequences of climate change. This is of particular \r\n A/65/PV.19\r\n \r\n35 10-55122 \r\n \r\nconcern to us, as small island developing States are \r\nhardest hit by the consequences of climate change. In \r\nthe light of the facts, it should be a matter of some \r\nimportance to develop a proactive coordinated \r\napproach, in collaboration with financial institutions, \r\ninsurance companies and other catastrophic-event-\r\nmitigation stakeholders. It is clear that the disaster \r\npreparedness, mitigation and response paradigms \r\nincorporated into our national development strategies \r\nare in need of urgent strengthening. Indeed, my country \r\nis committed to a comprehensive approach in disaster-\r\nrisk abatement and mitigation, through capacity-\r\nbuilding and through the creation of internal \r\nmechanisms that would ensure more effective \r\nresponses. I urge Member States to continue exploiting \r\nand exploring technology and best practices, as we \r\nwork in partnership to find sustainable solutions to this \r\nproblem. \r\n We believe that stronger political commitment, \r\ngreater cooperation and less apportioning of blame are \r\nrequired if we are to succeed in this endeavour. \r\nTherefore we hope that the global partnership and \r\nsolidarity evidenced in the aftermath of this year’s \r\nmany disasters will continue to prevail. \r\n Four months ago, in May 2010, the General \r\nAssembly adopted resolution 64/265 on the prevention \r\nand control of non-communicable diseases. That \r\nresolution seeks to halt the growing trend of premature \r\ndeaths from these diseases — mainly, diabetes, \r\ncardiovascular diseases, cancers and chronic respiratory \r\ndiseases. Saint Kitts and Nevis applauds that resolution. \r\nAt the same time, however, we seize the opportunity to \r\nremind this Assembly of another public health and \r\npublic security issue that begs attention and resolution. \r\nMany will recall our efforts last year to focus attention \r\non the issue of the global epidemic of interpersonal \r\nviolence and its implications for development, health, \r\nsecurity and governance. The data reveal that \r\ninterpersonal violence accounts for about 4,300 deaths \r\nper day, one every 20 seconds, one half of them being \r\ndue to homicide. In some countries homicide rates are as \r\nhigh as 60 to 70 per 100,000. The human, social and \r\nfinancial costs of violence are unacceptably high and are \r\nescalating. \r\n The World Health Organization has been playing \r\na key role in this field through its Milestones of a \r\nGlobal Campaign for Violence Prevention programme, \r\nand the General Assembly has adopted individual \r\nresolutions on violence against children, violence \r\nagainst women and armed violence. There is still, \r\nhowever, no General Assembly resolution that calls for \r\nan integrated approach to all forms of interpersonal \r\nviolence; there is no resolution that speaks to youth \r\nviolence, one of the major contributors to high murder \r\nrates and social breakdown; and there is no resolution \r\nthat emphasizes the necessity of a multisectoral \r\nresponse to this problem. Saint Kitts and Nevis is \r\ntherefore once again soliciting your support for such a \r\nresolution. We are calling for an integrated and \r\nmultisectoral response to all forms of interpersonal \r\nviolence and recognition of the causes, with a view to \r\nits placement on the General Assembly agenda for \r\ndebate next year, 2011. As we celebrate the \r\nInternational Year of Youth, I can think of no better \r\ntime to introduce such a resolution. \r\n Saint Kitts and Nevis guards zealously the \r\neffective management and care of our resources. Our \r\nprimary resource is our people, particularly our youth — \r\nour future. In preparing them for the promises and the \r\npotential perils of tomorrow, we have been investing \r\nstrategically in education — education with relevance. \r\n I applaud the establishment of the United Nations \r\nEntity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of \r\nWomen (UN Women). The occupying of high office \r\nand decision-making roles by women has been the \r\nnorm in Saint Kitts and Nevis, and we remain \r\ncommitted to gender-equal opportunities at home and \r\nabroad. We look forward to participating actively in \r\nUN Women in the coming years and would be most \r\npleased to share our experiences. \r\n As we move forward through this sixty-fifth \r\nsession of the General Assembly, I encourage us to \r\nremain committed to the ideals that have brought us to \r\nthis point. Let us marshal the courage to do the things \r\nthat ought to be done if this indispensable global \r\ninstitution is to be able to deliver at its very best. \r\n In conclusion, permit me to congratulate you, \r\nMr. President, and the Government of Switzerland, on \r\nyour election to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-fifth session. I thank you, Sir, for \r\nyour readiness to preside over this General Assembly \r\nat a time of great challenge. We feel confident that you \r\nwill rise to the occasion with great fortitude and \r\ndetermination. \r\n Permit me also to thank Mr. Ali Abdussalam \r\nTreki, President of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nA/65/PV.19  \r\n \r\n10-55122 36 \r\n \r\nfourth session, for his leadership and commitment \r\nduring the past year. \r\n I trust that under your leadership, Mr. President, \r\nwe will seize the moment for change — this \r\ncompelling moment for reform and one that is reflected \r\nin the deliberations of the recent Meeting on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals — as we draw closer \r\nto the 2015 target. I assure you, Sir, of my \r\nGovernment’s full support for your stewardship. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Bernard Kouchner, Minister for \r\nForeign and European Affairs of the French Republic. \r\n Mr. Kouchner (France) (spoke in French): I \r\ncome to this rostrum on behalf of France to express my \r\nsincere and fervent faith in the United Nations. \r\nFrance’s ambition is to be a major actor in building a \r\nsystem of global governance that is more just, more \r\ncohesive, more social, and a global order that is \r\norganized and regulated around a stronger, more \r\nrepresentative and more effective United Nations — a \r\nUnited Nations capable of meeting the great challenges \r\nof our century. \r\n I look out upon the Assembly. I know many of \r\nthose present here today. For 25 years now — even \r\nmore — I have been going up and down the corridors \r\nof the United Nations because I like the United \r\nNations, because I believe in the United Nations, and \r\nbecause I know it to be indispensable. \r\n I would like to speak to the Assembly candidly. I \r\nam going to talk about men and women, suffering and \r\nhope. I am going to talk about responsibility, because \r\nwe have responsibilities as citizens, diplomats and \r\npolitical leaders to meet these sufferings, hopes and \r\nexpectations. \r\n Of course, all of us would have an infinite \r\nnumber of reasons to present a litany of generous \r\nintentions, only to go home, our conscience clear, for \r\nwhat we had said a little while before to the Assembly \r\nand then go back to our day-to-day problems at home. \r\nOf course, after the terrible economic crisis from which \r\nwe have barely emerged, we have to live with reduced \r\nbudgets and tense socio-economic situations. The times \r\nare difficult and our fellow citizens are worried. The \r\ntemptation to retreat exists. Of course, to correct the \r\nlarge imbalances and injustices that undermine our \r\nsociety and to fight for the planet’s security and \r\ndevelopment, we can always count on others. But \r\nwhich others? There are no “others”. We are all here, \r\nthe nations of the world, represented in the General \r\nAssembly, and we only have to decide together to act. \r\n Not acting today would be to resign ourselves to \r\ndisorder, injustice and chaos. That choice will never be \r\nFrance’s because it is not in keeping with our history, \r\nor our values, or our interests. Faced with disorder in \r\nthe world, the greatest risk today would be to lapse into \r\nroutine. Please do not tell me that we cannot move \r\nforward, that the situation is at an impasse. No, in the \r\npast, we have been able together, collectively, to be \r\nrevolutionary on fundamental subjects, even at the \r\nexpense of the national sovereignties which we all \r\nrepresent here. \r\n Recall our boldness here in 1988, General \r\nAssembly resolution 43/131, and then two years later, \r\nresolution 45/100, on humanitarian assistance to \r\nvictims of natural disasters and similar emergency \r\nsituations. These resolutions allowed us for the first \r\ntime to guarantee free access of humanitarian workers \r\nto the affected regions. Then there was Security \r\nCouncil 688 (1991) (5 April 1991) on the situation in \r\nKurdistan, where, for the first time, the door was \r\nopened to a military operation to protect civilian \r\npopulations against an oppressor State. \r\n These were two historic moments which laid the \r\nfirst markers of the right to intervene. This became the \r\nresponsibility to protect, which this Assembly adopted \r\nby consensus at the 2005 World Summit (see resolution \r\n60/1). Who could have imagined that such an upending \r\nof international law would be possible? The fight was \r\nlong and difficult; it is not over — far from it. To speak \r\ncandidly to the Assembly, the results are not \r\ncompletely what I had expected. But we must note that, \r\ntogether, we were able to overcome some obstacles \r\nwhich were supposed to be insurmountable. Let \r\nnothing stop us from taking up subjects which we \r\ndecide on together. \r\n Our first shared responsibility is development — \r\nto make sure that all men and women, including the \r\nmost impoverished, have decent living conditions. The \r\nwidening gap of inequalities is not only morally \r\nunacceptable, it is politically dangerous. Of course, it \r\nis costly to act, but the cost of inaction is even greater. \r\n The conclusions of the High-level Meeting on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) that we just \r\nheld place our responsibilities squarely before us. This \r\n A/65/PV.19\r\n \r\n37 10-55122 \r\n \r\nis an urgent matter. We can no longer ask suffering \r\npopulations to continue to wait. \r\n The President of the French Republic, Nicolas \r\nSarkozy, reminded the Assembly of this fact, that France \r\nis the second largest global donor of official \r\ndevelopment assistance — €9 billion per annum — \r\ntargeted to education, health, food security, sanitation \r\nand infrastructure. France’s commitment to development \r\nwill not slacken, but figures do not make a policy. Our \r\nassistance must be judged according to its results. We \r\nneed to go further and move faster for children dying of \r\nmalaria — one every 30 seconds — for entire families \r\nstricken by AIDS, and for all those who are hungry or \r\ncannot go to school. \r\n I ask the Assembly: what planet do we wish to \r\nleave as a legacy to our children? Will we be able to \r\nmake an ambitious decision to combat climate change \r\nand preserve our environment? This is a subject that \r\nconcerns us all and requires a global partnership, one \r\nwhere we aspire to find an agreement on both reducing \r\nemissions and measures to be taken in order to adapt. \r\nAnd we must, first and foremost, ensure that the \r\ncommitments undertaken will be implemented and that \r\nfollow-up mechanisms and effective institutions will be \r\nput in place. \r\n For all of this, we must find a great deal of \r\nmoney — several tens of billions of dollars per year — \r\nfor us and our planet. Let us provide the means to \r\nrealize our ambitions. The solutions are here, within \r\nreach; they have proved to be effective and await only \r\nour political will and our courage. They are called \r\ninnovative financing. The tax on airline tickets was a \r\nstep forward, a long time in coming. Today we should \r\ngo farther by adopting an international tax on financial \r\ntransactions which would permanently change matters \r\nfor development. It is an idea that I have been \r\ndefending for more than 20 years. It is a priority for \r\nFrance now. The President alluded to it here a few days \r\nago. \r\n Bear in mind that a minute tax of 0.005 per cent, \r\nthat is five cents on a transaction of €1,000, could raise \r\n€30 billion to €40 billion per year, almost one quarter \r\nof official development assistance. Who could deny \r\nthat this is a stable and predictable way of raising a \r\nmassive amount for development? Even with half of \r\nthat amount, it would be possible to send every child to \r\nschool in the low-income countries. Everyone agrees \r\ntoday that it is technically and economically feasible to \r\nestablish such a mechanism. \r\n And, make no mistake; we are not talking about \r\ndiminishing official development assistance or dodging \r\nour responsibilities. No, on the contrary, this amount \r\nwould come as an addition. And so we must not waste \r\ntime, we are together, this is what we established this \r\ninstitution for, this institution, unparalleled in history, \r\ncalled the United Nations. \r\n It is now a universally recognized principle that \r\ndevelopment cannot occur without peace and security, \r\nwhich are the basic raison d’être of the United Nations. \r\nHere, the challenges remain considerable. Afghanistan, \r\nSomalia, the Sudan, the Middle East — so many \r\nconflicts continue to feed chaos throughout the world. \r\n How many missed opportunities, how many \r\ndashed hopes, how many misunderstandings have for \r\nmore than 60 years — I repeat, 60 years — marked this \r\nprocess, peaceful in name only, in the Middle East? \r\nThe Arab-Israeli conflict concerns us all. I say Arab-\r\nIsraeli because, besides the Palestinian track, France \r\nconsiders it just as important to work on the Lebanese \r\nand Syrian tracks. Today we have before us a historic \r\nopportunity. We cannot let it slip. \r\n The process almost stopped yesterday evening. I \r\nam not sure that it will continue in an orderly way and \r\nwith unanimous support. I hope it will. We have \r\nlimited time remaining. Palestine, the new State \r\nMember of the United Nations which many of us have \r\nbeen calling for, will be, I hope, the best guarantee of \r\nsecurity for Israel. \r\n All States in the region have a critical role to \r\nplay. All of that is important, but what is necessary is \r\nthat the Israelis and Palestinians make a strategic \r\ndecision to put an end to this conflict in their own \r\ninterests. I would therefore call on the sense of \r\nresponsibility of President Abbas and Prime Minister \r\nNetanyahu; together they must make the painful \r\ncompromises on the road to peace. \r\n I have said that I have faith in the United Nations. \r\nI served the United Nations, as perhaps you know, in \r\nKosovo and in a number of other places. I know, \r\nrespect and deeply love the men and women who give \r\nlife to the United Nations. From this rostrum, I wish to \r\npay tribute with emotion, affection and respect, to all \r\nthose who, in serving the United Nations, take risks \r\nevery day for our shared ideal of peace and \r\nA/65/PV.19  \r\n \r\n10-55122 38 \r\n \r\ndevelopment. I think of all the friends we have lost — \r\nand the friends we may still lose — year after year, \r\nand, of course, of those who take their place. \r\n The fight is noble. Respect for the values and \r\nuniversal principles of human rights constitutes the \r\nindispensable foundation on which United Nations \r\naction must be built. The ambition to build a world \r\norder founded on universal respect for human dignity \r\nhas been and will always be at the heart of French \r\ndiplomacy. \r\n Have we collectively progressed in our service of \r\nthese values? Not enough. How long will we continue \r\nto accept — now that we live in a so-called \r\ninformation society, a world where people can know \r\nwhat is happening in other places — that, in terms of \r\nhuman rights, there are so many blind spots, so many \r\nforgotten tragedies and so much suffering that remain \r\nhidden? As I asked at the beginning, what has become \r\nof the responsibility to protect? \r\n Today the success of the United Nations must \r\nfirst of all be assessed in terms of its contribution to \r\nthe protection of civilians. That is the first area in \r\nwhich our requirements should be upheld. Every day \r\nmassacres and rapes are committed throughout the \r\nworld, in Somalia, in Darfur and in the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, including in regions where \r\npeacekeeping operations are deployed. \r\n We can no longer simply count the victims when \r\nmass crimes are committed. Our courage must not be \r\nless than that of those who die from risks that we no \r\nlonger know how to take. \r\n France believes that the International Criminal \r\nCourt is one of the most important advances made in \r\nthe history of a humankind conscious of the dangers to \r\nwhich it is exposed by its own demons. France \r\nunderstands the criticism of those that believe that the \r\nCourt is too slow or that it goes too far. Let us be clear, \r\nFrance will always support the idea of international \r\ncriminal justice that is impartial and universal, for it is \r\nthe only way of fulfilling the imperative dictated by \r\nour history, namely, combating impunity. To all who \r\nare shocked by the boldness of some of the Court’s \r\nprosecutions, I say that, on the contrary, it would be \r\nappalling if the victims were deprived of their right to \r\njustice. \r\n Human rights, the protection of civilians, \r\ninternational justice — these are not hollow concepts \r\nor empty principles for us. For France, they are first \r\nand foremost principles of action, and the only valid \r\ncriterion for judgement is the impact of our actions on \r\nthe actual situation. \r\n In Guinea, after the killings in the Conakry \r\nstadium, on 28 September 2009, we came together to \r\ndenounce the human rights violations and to assist the \r\nvictims of the atrocities committed. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral dispatched an International Commission of \r\nInquiry to the field one month after the fact, and I \r\nwould like to once again thank him sincerely for that. \r\nThe Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court \r\ninstituted proceedings. That pressure enabled Guinean \r\ncivil society in the field to make the difference. Today \r\nthe junta has been replaced by a transitional executive. \r\nNothing has been won. There will be a second round of \r\nelections in two weeks. But I wanted to recall this \r\nsuccess of the United Nations since at the beginning I \r\nsaid that the responsibility to protect was threatened. I \r\nthink we can all agree that there is a movement \r\nforming in civil society throughout the world and that \r\nwe can still take action. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Mourad Medelci, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Algeria. \r\n Mr. Medelci (Algeria) (spoke in Arabic): First of \r\nall, I would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your \r\nassumption of the presidency of this session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. Your character, distinguished career \r\nand knowledge of current international affairs will \r\nsurely contribute to the management and success of our \r\nwork. I would like to convey Algeria’s full support for \r\nyour efforts in the course of your term of office. I also \r\npay tribute to your predecessor, my brother Ali \r\nAbdussalam Treki, for his efforts and commitment to \r\nthe principles of multilateralism and respect for the \r\nfounding values of the Charter. Additionally, I wish to \r\nexpress our satisfaction and gratitude to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for the breadth and quality of \r\nthe efforts which he has tirelessly exerted to add to the \r\nrole of the Organization in our joint quest to achieve \r\nand strengthen its ideals. \r\n Despite the recent emergence of some \r\nencouraging signs of economic recovery, the world \r\ncontinues to suffer from the aftermath of the financial \r\nand economic crisis. The steps taken thus far to address \r\nits most devastating effects and to relaunch the global \r\neconomic engine lead us to believe even more firmly \r\n A/65/PV.19\r\n \r\n39 10-55122 \r\n \r\nthat the best way to prevent worse crises from \r\noccurring is to rethink global financial and economic \r\ngovernance in a rational manner that leaves no room \r\nfor speculation and the vagaries of the market and that \r\nserves as a fair model for developing countries. \r\n The main trends in the world since the last \r\nsession have led us to examine the depth of the \r\neconomic crisis in the poorest countries, especially in \r\nAfrica. Crises such as this hamper progress in the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs), notably in the areas of maternal and child \r\nhealth and in combating poverty. It is important that \r\nthe international community respect its commitments \r\nin the area of official development assistance and \r\nprovide recipient countries with additional assistance \r\nso that they can achieve the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. Several options could be explored in that \r\nregard, some of which seem very promising to us. They \r\ninclude debt moratoriums for developing countries that \r\nhave difficulty in paying their debts and easier access \r\nto the markets of developed countries. \r\n The fact that a high-level meeting on biodiversity \r\nwill take place in a few weeks’ time in Nagoya, Japan, \r\nprovides us with a valuable opportunity to launch an \r\nurgent appeal requesting the international community \r\nto mobilize to preserve the biological resources of our \r\nplanet, which are being threatened by unbridled \r\neconomic development that does not take future \r\ngenerations into account. In that context, I would like \r\nto stress the need to strengthen the role of the United \r\nNations in protecting biodiversity in developing \r\ncountries and in promoting North-South cooperation \r\nthat is mutually beneficial. \r\n The issue of climate change presents another \r\nconsiderable challenge for the international \r\ncommunity, given the manifold threats it poses to \r\necosystems and economies. The limited and modest \r\nresults achieved in Copenhagen should serve to \r\nencourage all States to redouble their efforts to make \r\nprogress at the next meeting of the Conference of the \r\nParties, to be held in Cancún, towards establishing a \r\nlegally binding agreement based on the Kyoto \r\nProtocol’s Framework Convention. \r\n No doubt due to climate change, the extreme \r\ngravity of the natural phenomena that have lately \r\nplunged Pakistan, Russia, China, India and other \r\ncountries into disaster means that we need to \r\nrestructure international mechanisms to respond to \r\nnatural disasters of this kind. On the basis of humanism \r\nand solidarity, Algeria launches an appeal for a joint \r\ninternational reflection on the best way to achieve \r\ngenuine comprehensive natural disaster management. \r\n Countries that do not possess nuclear weapons, \r\nsuch as Algeria, have the right to ask nuclear States to \r\ntruly embrace nuclear disarmament. The results of the \r\n2010 eighth Review Conference of the Parties to the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \r\nconstitute a positive step in that regard, thanks in \r\nparticular to the launching of a process that should give \r\nrise to a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East. \r\n In order to rise to the multiple challenges \r\nconfronting international peace and security, the \r\nConference on Disarmament should make the most of \r\nthe favourable international circumstances and the \r\npositive momentum generated by the results of the \r\n2010 Review Conference to restart its work and \r\ncomply with its mandate. To that end, Algeria \r\ncontinues to be committed to the effective relaunching \r\nof the work of the Conference on Disarmament. \r\nAlgeria believes that the goals and contents of the \r\nprogramme adopted in 2009 continue to be valid today \r\nand could be the basis for the work of future sessions. \r\n The issue of peace and security is also linked to \r\nthe exacerbation of terrorism and its links with \r\ntransnational organized crime, the taking of hostages \r\nand trafficking in arms, drugs and human beings. My \r\ncountry welcomes the adoption of resolution 1904 \r\n(2009), on criminalizing the payment of ransoms to \r\narmed groups based on the principle that this \r\ncondemnable practice is a significant source of \r\nfinancing for terrorism. Nevertheless, the international \r\ncommunity must still make considerable efforts to \r\neradicate this transnational threat, not just in the \r\ncontext of comprehensive and systematic \r\nimplementation but also in the light of the increase in \r\nhostage-taking by terrorists and the payment of \r\nransoms to them. This is an issue that must be \r\naddressed with determination, strength and \r\nresponsibility. \r\n Algeria calls on the international community to \r\nact to prevent the criminal use of international satellite \r\nimages via the Internet. We believe that the \r\ncomprehensive treaty to combat terrorism, which \r\nAlgeria fully supports, will be a main factor in \r\nchecking piracy, once it has been adopted. \r\nA/65/PV.19  \r\n \r\n10-55122 40 \r\n \r\n With regard to respect for the principles \r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, Algeria \r\nfully participates in regional integration attempts as a \r\ncrucial element in combating international terrorism. \r\nAlgeria has launched several recent initiatives, \r\nincluding an initiative to strengthen bilateral and \r\nregional cooperation among States in our region in \r\norder to bolster peace, security and development. It is \r\ncommitted to pursuing common efforts to build the \r\nArab Maghreb union and endow it with dynamic \r\ninstitutions to ensure that the project comes into being \r\nas the ideal framework for economic cooperation and \r\ncomplementarity in the region. It has also launched \r\nMaghreb-wide economic and social programmes and \r\ndevelopment projects to encourage regional \r\nintegration. \r\n The Palestinian people, who continue to aspire to \r\nbuild a viable State, are still held hostage by the \r\nindecision of certain parties. That is being aggravated \r\nby policies of aggression and unjust siege. We reiterate \r\nour call to the international community to show resolve \r\nand unity with regard to this conflict by bringing \r\npressure to bear on the occupation forces. We believe \r\nthat a definitive, comprehensive and just solution \r\nrequires the implementation of the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative. In that context, on behalf of the Algerian \r\npeople and Government, I should like to express our \r\nfriendship and support to our Palestinian brothers. \r\n Algeria would like to see an immediate halt to \r\nsettlements, the return of Palestinian refugees, the \r\nreturn of East Jerusalem to the Palestinians as the \r\ncapital of a Palestinian State and a return to the borders \r\nof 4 June 1967. The other occupied Arab territories in \r\nLebanon and the Golan should also be returned. \r\n As we mark the fiftieth anniversary of the \r\nadoption of resolution 1514 (XV), which enshrined the \r\nprinciple of freeing oppressed people from the yoke of \r\ncolonialism, we unfortunately continue to see that there \r\nstill exist Non-Self-Governing Territories whose \r\npopulations continue to aspire to self-determination. To \r\nthat end, and in keeping with our duties and \r\nresponsibilities, Algeria is willing to extend its full \r\nsupport to the efforts of the United Nations and of \r\nSpecial Envoy of the Secretary-General Christopher \r\nRoss in order to resolve the Western Sahara conflict. \r\nWe express our adherence to the human rights \r\ndimension of the issue and the need for it to be taken \r\ninto account by the Human Rights Council and other \r\ninternational mechanisms in that area, in line with the \r\nrelevant provisions of the United Nations Charter, so as \r\nto reach a just political solution that allows the people \r\nof Western Sahara to exercise their right to self-\r\ndetermination through a referendum. I reiterate my \r\ncountry’s belief, in line with the view of the African \r\nUnion Summit held in Kampala, that there cannot be \r\nan international justice system that operates at two \r\ndifferent speeds and focuses on a single region of the \r\nworld, for this issue poses a threat to regional peace \r\nand security. \r\n Algeria also rejects the imposition of \r\nextraterritorial laws and rules and all forms of coercive \r\neconomic measures, including unilateral sanctions \r\nagainst developing countries. In that regard, Algeria \r\nreiterates the need to end the economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo that has been imposed against \r\nthe Cuban Government and people for more than half a \r\ncentury. \r\n The African Union has proclaimed 2010 the Year \r\nof Peace and Security in Africa, as an expression of the \r\nwill of its member States to make every peaceful effort \r\nto resolve all ongoing and new conflicts and crises on \r\nour continent. We encourage the African Union to \r\nintegrate economically and politically so that it can \r\nbecome a partner to reckon with in international \r\naffairs. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ruslan Kazakbaev, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Kyrgyz Republic. \r\n Mr. Kazakbaev (Kyrgyzstan) (spoke in Russian): \r\nI would first like to congratulate you, President Deiss, \r\non your election to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at it sixty-fifth session. I wish you every \r\nsuccess. \r\n For Kyrgyzstan, 2010 has been a year of \r\nprofound changes and serious challenges to our \r\ncontinued existence, unity and statehood. In April, \r\nhaving overthrown the authoritarian system of State \r\ngovernance, with its flagrant corruption and illegality, \r\nthe Kyrgyz people resolutely chose a path to renewal \r\nand genuine democratic development. \r\n Nevertheless, in May and June, the world \r\nwitnessed acutely destabilizing situations in the south \r\nof Kyrgyzstan, where radical forces of the former \r\nGovernment and criminal and extremist groups sought \r\nrevenge. Accordingly, they provoked bloody clashes \r\n A/65/PV.19\r\n \r\n41 10-55122 \r\n \r\nbetween Kyrgyz and Uzbek communities, who have \r\nlived and worked in peace side by side for centuries. \r\n Those extremist forces insidiously played the \r\nethnic card by knowingly exploiting the precariousness \r\nof such socio-economic problems as poverty, high \r\nunemployment — especially among youth — corruption \r\nand unequal access to economic and financial resources, \r\nwhich were ignored by the former Government. \r\n Mr. Ndong Mba (Equatorial Guinea), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair. \r\n In that difficult period, the interim Government \r\nsucceeded in consolidating all positive and patriotic \r\nforces among the people. With the assistance of the \r\ninternational community, the interim Government was \r\nable to stabilize the situation and thereby prevent a \r\nreturn to the past. \r\n On 27 June, a new Constitution was adopted by \r\nnational referendum that provided the basis for \r\nparliamentary Government in the country. Today, we \r\ncan in good conscience declare that all the necessary \r\npolitical, economic and organizational conditions have \r\nbeen established for the holding of transparent \r\nparliamentary elections in Kyrgyzstan on 10 October \r\n2010. Kyrgyzstan has a unique opportunity to build a \r\ntruly democratic parliamentary State based on the rule \r\nof law and human rights. I am confident that the people \r\nof Kyrgyzstan will show wisdom and a high level of \r\npolitical involvement and not miss this chance. \r\n In order to move successfully along the path of \r\ndemocratic development and prevent future political \r\nand socio-economic disturbances, we intend to \r\nthoroughly analyse the origins and reasons behind the \r\napparent conflicts that took place in our country in the \r\npast year, and more specifically over the past six \r\nmonths. \r\n At present a State commission to investigate the \r\nreasons for the conflict is at work. The commission \r\nconsists of prominent political activists, scientists and \r\nexperts, of Kyrgyz, Uzbek and other nationalities that \r\nmake up multinational Kyrgyzstan. An international \r\nindependent commission has also begun its work, \r\nsupported by the United Nations, the European Union, \r\nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in \r\nEurope (OSCE) and Nordic countries. We should \r\nidentify the organizers of the bloody clashes, seek what \r\nlessons can be learned, try to comprehend and \r\neradicate the causes of friction and seek ways to reach \r\ninter-ethnic accord in the society. \r\n But most important, the realization of the tragic \r\nand futile nature of the results of extremist actions \r\nmust become established in the minds of the peoples of \r\nthe various ethnic communities living in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nAn unshakable commitment to national unity and \r\nnationhood must become the cohesive element and \r\nuniting force in the country. \r\n We are expanding the various forms of \r\ncooperation with regional international organizations in \r\norder to further stabilize the situation in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nThus, with a view to rendering assistance to law \r\nenforcement staff and restoring confidence between \r\npeople and local administrations, the negotiations on \r\nengaging the OSCE police advisory group are \r\nconcluding. In line with agreements reached, the \r\npartner countries of the Collective Security Treaty \r\nOrganization render procurement and advisory \r\nassistance. \r\n The Kyrgyz Republic highly appreciates the \r\nposition and actions of the leadership of the Republic \r\nof Uzbekistan, and of President Islam Karimov \r\npersonally, in stabilizing the situation in the south of \r\nour country, especially in the first days of the unrest. \r\nWe are also grateful for the support and invaluable \r\nassistance rendered by the Government of that \r\nbrotherly country to citizens of Kyrgyzstan displaced \r\ninto Uzbekistan, and for facilitating their return. \r\n We are sincerely grateful to all those who \r\nresponded to the call for help and assistance in the \r\nframework of the flash appeal for Kyrgyzstan launched \r\nby the United Nations, and also for comprehensive \r\nsupport provided on a bilateral basis. \r\n The immediate humanitarian assistance from \r\nfriendly countries, international organizations and \r\nagencies and United Nations institutions has been vital \r\nin stabilizing the crisis situation and overcoming the \r\ndestructive consequences of a humanitarian \r\ncatastrophe. As of today we have received 40 per cent \r\nof the required help within the framework of the \r\nappeal. It is obviously not sufficient, given the urgent \r\nneed of the population on the streets of the affected \r\ncities and settlements. People still need housing, the \r\nwounded need medical care, and schools and social \r\nservice buildings need to be rebuilt. \r\nA/65/PV.19  \r\n \r\n10-55122 42 \r\n \r\n At present our Government is focusing its basic \r\nefforts on post-conflict reconstruction of the country’s \r\nsocial and economic infrastructure, especially in the \r\nsouthern regions. Therefore, timely and practical \r\nimplementation of commitments made at the donor \r\nconference on Kyrgyzstan held in Bishkek this July is \r\nextremely important. \r\n Kyrgyzstan supports the position of Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon, stated on 23 September at the \r\nSecurity Council Summit (see S/PV.6389), on \r\nstrengthening the role of the United Nations in \r\nresponding to humanitarian catastrophes and resolving \r\ncrisis situations. \r\n The establishment of the United Nations Regional \r\nCentre for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia was \r\nan important and necessary step on the part of the \r\nUnited Nations. We consider it essential to expand and \r\nstrengthen its operations, which will allow it to \r\nimplement a package of preventive measures and to \r\nactivate mediation services. We also welcome the \r\nlaunch of a counter-terrorism strategy for the Central \r\nAsian region and are ready to strengthen cooperation \r\naimed at adoption of a joint action plan by 2011. \r\n The Security Council summit prompts us to \r\nconsider more seriously the problem of terrorism. The \r\nevents of June of this year in the Kyrgyz Republic — \r\nwhen various terrorists groups attempted to enter the \r\nterritory of Kyrgyzstan by mountain paths from \r\nneighbouring countries — testify to the presence of \r\nreal threats of terrorism to the peace and security of the \r\nStates bordering Afghanistan. \r\n Terrorist groups joining forces with drug barons \r\nand other criminal elements is a great concern. Such \r\ncombustible hybrids should be eliminated by the most \r\ndrastic measures. Therefore, the Kyrgyz State drug \r\ncontrol agency, which was liquidated a year ago, has \r\nrecently been restored. As we intensify our efforts in \r\nthe fight against illegal drug trafficking, we are \r\nextremely interested in furthering a strategic \r\nprogramme for the countries of Central Asia to oppose \r\nillegal drug trafficking and fighting international \r\ncrime. We must further strengthen the activity of the \r\nCentral Asian Regional Information and Coordination \r\nCentre in fighting illegal trafficking of psychotropic \r\nsubstances and their precursors under the aegis of the \r\nUnited Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. \r\n The action plan of the European Union and the \r\nCentral Asian countries for 2009-2013 should become \r\nan important part of international efforts to fight illegal \r\ndrug trafficking, along with coordinated actions within \r\nthe framework of the Commonwealth of Independent \r\nStates and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. We \r\ncontinually call upon the United Nations to improve \r\ncoordination of the fights against drug trafficking and \r\ntransnational organized crime. \r\n In Afghanistan, the fragile process of \r\npeacekeeping and reconciliation and the development \r\nof the institutional structures are points of special \r\nconcern. The recent parliamentary elections in that \r\ncountry inspire some optimism about strengthening \r\ncivil society and creating a parliament of national \r\nunity. The construction of a stable economy and \r\neffective support of Afghanistan’s State institutions \r\nwill serve as the basis for a durable peace in that \r\ncountry and will reduce the threat to security in the \r\nCentral Asian region. Kyrgyzstan supports \r\ninternational programmes for Afghanistan’s economic \r\nreconstruction and is ready to contribute material and \r\npersonnel and to work closely with the anti-terrorist \r\ncoalition. \r\n The Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference \r\nlast May demonstrated the possibility of achieving an \r\nunderstanding in the critical sphere of nuclear \r\ndisarmament. My country is also contributing to that \r\neffort. Kyrgyzstan has been designated as the \r\ndepositary of the Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free \r\nZone in Central Asia. Thus it promotes regional \r\nsecurity while broadening collaboration with other \r\nnuclear-weapon-free zones. \r\n The ecological dimension is a special feature of \r\nthe Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central \r\nAsia. That is because there remains a large quantity of \r\nuranium tailings in Kyrgyzstan, which poses a serious \r\nrisk to human life and to the environment in general. \r\nOn this matter, we are grateful to the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme for its increased attention to \r\nthose zones of high ecological risk and for conducting \r\nan international meeting in 2009. \r\n We would like to call delegates’ attention to item \r\n97 (i) on the Assembly’s agenda for this session, \r\nentitled “Establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone \r\nin Central Asia”, and we ask them to support it. \r\n United Nations peacekeeping operations are a key \r\ntool in preserving and maintaining peace on our planet. \r\nKyrgyzstan is the only country in the region that is \r\ncontributing more than 30 peacekeepers to United \r\n A/65/PV.19\r\n \r\n43 10-55122 \r\n \r\nNations missions in Africa, Asia and the Caribbean, \r\nand it is ready to increase its participation in United \r\nNations peacekeeping operations. \r\n The delegation of Kyrgyzstan has repeatedly \r\ncome out in favour of fully optimizing the management \r\nof peacekeeping operations. It supports the \r\ncomprehensive strategy for field support and its \r\nreform, as documented in “A New Partnership Agenda: \r\nCharting a New Horizon for UN Peacekeeping”. We \r\nare convinced of the vital importance of involving such \r\nauthoritative regional organizations as the European \r\nUnion, the Organization for Security and Cooperation \r\nin Europe and the Collective Security Treaty \r\nOrganization in peacekeeping activities and post-\r\nconflict reconstruction. \r\n Kyrgyzstan is devoted to the purposes and tasks \r\nof strengthening international peace and security, and, \r\nas a candidate for non-permanent membership on the \r\nSecurity Council, is ready to contribute to the cause of \r\npeace, especially by participating in the work of the \r\nCouncil and its committees. \r\n We wish to focus the Assembly’s attention on the \r\nissues of environmental safety and hydropower. Recent \r\nstudies have confirmed the loss of more than 20 per \r\ncent of Kyrgyzstan’s glaciers and snowfields, which \r\nrequires urgent efforts to preserve our river headwaters \r\nand restore our forests. Kyrgyzstan is interested in the \r\nrational exploitation of its resources, an attractive \r\ninvestment climate, preserving ecological security and \r\ndeveloping alternative energy sources. We need to \r\nlaunch regional projects within the framework of the \r\nCentral Asia/South Asia Regional Electricity Market, \r\nstarting with the construction of a Kyrgyzstan-\r\nTajikistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan electric power line. \r\n We pledge our full support to developing concrete \r\nmeasures at the forthcoming sixteenth Climate Change \r\nConference in Cancún in November. Among the \r\npractical steps to be taken in this area, I will mention \r\nthat the forthcoming International Conference of \r\nMountain Countries, on climate change, to be held in \r\nKathmandu, will be making broad proposals for the \r\nCancún meeting. \r\n Kyrgyzstan is studying significant projects on \r\nsustainable development and supports Mr. László \r\nBorbély in his work for the nineteenth session of the \r\nCommission on Sustainable Development. Our \r\nimperative is achieving the agenda of the twenty-first \r\ncentury and making the Johannesburg Plan of Action a \r\nreality. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that the \r\nactivity of the United Nations must respond fully to the \r\nexpectations of people throughout the planet and that \r\nwe, countries both small and large, must not forget the \r\nresponsibility we bear for our actions. I also wish for \r\nall the wisdom and courage that will help us in \r\nachieving the enduring purposes and values of our \r\nOrganization in building a better peace. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Shaikh Khalid Bin \r\nAhmed Al-Khalifa, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nKingdom of Bahrain. \r\n Shaikh Al-Khalifa (Bahrain) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nFirst of all, it gives me pleasure to convey to the \r\nAssembly the greetings of His Majesty King Hamad \r\nbin Issa Al Khalifa of Bahrain, and His Majesty’s best \r\nwishes for every success. I also congratulate Mr. Deiss \r\non his election to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly and thank His Excellency Ali Abdussalam \r\nTreki, President at the previous session, for his skilful \r\nmanagement of its deliberations. I also commend \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-Moon for his efforts and \r\ncontributions to international issues. \r\n We all know that since its inception the United \r\nNations has scored many successes in promoting \r\ncollective international action. It has undertaken a \r\ngreat many initiatives and conceived many ideas \r\nbeneficial to humanity, including the innovative \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). Today, we \r\nview those Goals as the principal topic on which we all \r\nagree. \r\n As the representative of my country, I shall touch \r\non the challenges facing humanity in various fields, \r\nwhether they concern solutions to problems between \r\nnations or realization of peoples’ ambitions, \r\nhighlighting some of the achievements that, taken \r\ntogether, can serve the common good. \r\n The most important challenge facing our world \r\ntoday is achieving the MDGs by 2015. We know that \r\nmany States have made huge and outstanding efforts to \r\nthat end. In this context, the Kingdom of Bahrain holds \r\na leading and positive position, particularly in the field \r\nof social welfare, free, quality basic education, health \r\ncare, improvement of child and maternal health, the \r\nempowerment of women, gender equality, the \r\nA/65/PV.19  \r\n \r\n10-55122 44 \r\n \r\nexpansion of the social security net for the poorest of \r\nthe population, our unemployment insurance scheme, \r\nand expansion of the scope of vocational training to \r\nenhance Bahrain’s human resources. \r\n I am honoured to stand before the Assembly as \r\nrepresentative of a country actively pursuing its \r\ninternational responsibilities. When we refer to the \r\nnotion of a modern State as the most important \r\npolitical, social, cultural and economic product of the \r\nmodern history of the Kingdom of Bahrain, it is \r\nbecause whatever achievements have been realized can \r\nbe attributed to good governance — governance that \r\nhas encouraged and supported initiatives and political \r\nand organizational visions aimed at building the \r\ninstitutions and capacities that can enhance the \r\nprinciples of a modern, organized society. Such a \r\nsociety is faithful to its values in every area, based on \r\nState institutions that guarantee all talented citizens the \r\nopportunity to create and innovate and to be an active \r\nparticipant in our contemporary world. \r\n The Economic Vision 2030 for Bahrain, launched \r\nby His Majesty King Hamad bin Issa Al Khalifa on \r\n23 October 2008, is an historic turning point and a \r\ngateway to economic reform, and a completion of \r\npolitical reform. It lays down a long-term vision of the \r\nfuture tracks of the national economy up to 2030. It \r\naims to ensure the transformation of the current \r\neconomy from one based on oil revenues into an \r\ninternationally competitive and productive system, \r\nplanned by the Government but led by a vibrant private \r\nsector. The outcome will be a growing Bahraini middle \r\nclass enjoying a high standard of living, due to \r\nincreased productivity and well-paid jobs. This Vision \r\naims to establish a society based on the principles of \r\nsustainability, competitiveness and justice. \r\n The financial crisis that has affected the \r\ninternational economy since 2008 and the ensuing \r\nsovereign debt crisis in Europe, austerity measures, \r\nreform and restructuring of the banking system, \r\nincreased State intervention in matters of banking and \r\neconomy in various countries — all this has led to a \r\nprominent role for the Group of 20 (G-20) in \r\nresponding to financial and economic crises, due to the \r\nfact that it represents some 90 per cent of the world \r\neconomy. Consequently, the time has come for the \r\nG-20, and other blocs such as 3-G, to play a leading \r\nrole in developing and enhancing a common action \r\nfrom within the United Nations and its various \r\ninstitutions and organs by setting up plans for \r\ncollective action aimed at enhancing countries’ \r\ncapacity to address future crises and to achieve an open \r\nand integrated economy. That is in line with the \r\nconstructive thoughts of the President of the General \r\nAssembly in this regard. \r\n The settlement of conflicts and disputes between \r\nStates, conflicts that we ourselves created, is a daily \r\nconcern for all of us. Those conflicts are either of an \r\nideological or ethnic nature, or are caused by people \r\noccupying the land of other peoples and evicting them \r\nfrom their homes and homelands. The conflicts divert \r\nour attention from more important concerns, including \r\naddressing poverty, ignorance, epidemics and natural \r\ndisasters, which take a heavy toll and impede human \r\ncreativity. Limited national interests of one State or \r\nanother that completely avoid considering the common \r\nglobal good are largely responsible for this state of \r\naffairs. \r\n One of the most important among these issues is \r\nthe Arab-Israeli conflict, which is located in our \r\nregion. We have been at an impasse for decades, as \r\nfailure has followed hopeful efforts and our optimism \r\nhas been clouded by frustration because of the \r\ncontinued backtracking of the peace process. Yet we \r\npersevere and cherish the hope of achieving a just, \r\npermanent and comprehensive peace that will restore \r\nrights to legitimate owners and open doors for mutual \r\nacceptance of others as neighbours, friends and \r\npartners fully sharing the respect and commitment \r\nrequired. \r\n In this connection, we value the historic \r\ncommitment and tireless efforts of President Barack \r\nObama of the United States of America and his \r\nAdministration to give a strong impetus to the peace \r\nprocess in the Middle East and to renew hope by \r\nrelaunching direct negotiations between Palestine and \r\nIsrael with a view to settling this chronic conflict. \r\n These precious efforts, however, require the \r\ncontinued support of all parties concerned and their \r\nunwavering commitment to take the necessary steps to \r\nachieve coexistence through enhanced communication \r\nand outreach. There should be an opportunity for each \r\nparty to convince the other to coexist as a neighbour \r\nand a partner in the region, and not an ill-intentioned or \r\ntreacherous enemy. Our commitment to the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative is one clear example. We are committed to \r\nthat Initiative and all its provisions aimed at achieving \r\na genuine peace. \r\n A/65/PV.19\r\n \r\n45 10-55122 \r\n \r\n One of the basic tenets of our foreign policy is \r\nour determination to see security, stability and \r\ndevelopment prevail. In that respect we look forward to \r\na safe and prosperous Iraq that is able to check any \r\nforeign intervention in its domestic affairs, an Iraq \r\nfaithful to its Arab-Islamic identity and inclusive of all \r\nits ethnic and cultural affiliations. \r\n As regards the Islamic Republic of Iran, we are \r\nkeenly interested in its stability and its people’s \r\nprosperity. We look forward to it playing a vital role in \r\norder to eliminate the ghost of discord around its \r\nnuclear programme. We welcome its commitment to a \r\npeaceful nuclear programme and stress the need for \r\ntotal transparency and full compliance with the \r\nrequirements of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons. \r\n On the other hand, with regard to the sisterly \r\nUnited Arab Emirates islands occupied by Iran, \r\nsettlement of the question through direct negotiations \r\nor referral to the International Court of Justice would \r\nconstitute a vital step and a foundation for regional \r\ncohesion and understanding that would generate the \r\nstability necessary for development, which would be in \r\nthe interest of all the peoples of the region. \r\n As for Yemen, its stability is a pillar for the \r\nstability of the region as a whole. The Kingdom of \r\nBahrain therefore reaffirms its full support to the \r\nRepublic of Yemen in all its efforts to combat terrorism \r\nand protect its national security. Bahrain calls on the \r\ninternational community to provide support and \r\nassistance to that brotherly country, either through \r\nbilateral channels or through the group of Friends of \r\nYemen. \r\n Regarding the situation in the Sudan, we \r\nwelcome the agreement signed by the Government of \r\nthe Sudan and the concerned Sudanese parties, and we \r\ncommend the sisterly State of Qatar for its \r\nconsiderable efforts in that matter. We look forward to \r\ncompletion of the current negotiations on Darfur within \r\nthe framework of the agreement signed to preserve the \r\nunity of brotherly Sudan. \r\n Resolving those disputes will enable us to address \r\nthe real challenges to which we should devote our \r\ncommon attention: challenges of security and terrorism \r\nand challenges of devastating natural disasters, such as \r\nthe tragic ordeals which affected the sisterly Islamic \r\nRepublic of Pakistan and the Republic of Haiti — \r\nrespectively, the unprecedented catastrophic floods and \r\nthe devastating earthquake. We express our solidarity \r\nwith those countries and hope they will overcome their \r\nadversity with assistance and support from the \r\ninternational community commensurate with the \r\nenormity of the disasters. \r\n Terrorism is a multifaceted global phenomenon \r\nthat affects the entire world through criminal terrorist \r\nacts perpetrated against many countries. It exploits \r\ndiscourse to stir up violence and to divide countries \r\nand communities, thus contradicting its original \r\nmission of providing spiritual counsel and guidance. It \r\nutilizes mass media for the same purpose. The best way \r\nto combat terrorism is to monitor and expose its \r\nfunding sources. That requires global consensus on a \r\ntransparent international financial system to regulate \r\nthe transfer of those funds. \r\n For the international community to address these \r\nserious challenges and threats, States must be in a \r\nposition to play their role fully through strengthened \r\nconcepts of political participation, democratic \r\npractices, human rights, rule of law, judicial and \r\ninstitutional reform, including freedom of opinion and \r\nexpression, and involving society in sharing \r\nresponsibilities. \r\n In concluding, I would like to state that \r\nrestructuring international relations and forming more \r\ninclusive alliances requires a higher degree of respect \r\nfor the opinions and values of others. That is consistent \r\nwith our commitment to pursue the noble purposes and \r\nprinciples embodied in the Charter: peace, security, \r\nfriendly relations and international cooperation among \r\nnations and peoples. My country reaffirms before the \r\nAssembly its resolve to play its role as an effective \r\nmember of the international community and to actively \r\nparticipate and take initiatives in efforts for the good \r\nand prosperity of all. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Cuba. \r\n Mr. Rodríguez Parrilla (Cuba) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): Yesterday was exactly the fiftieth anniversary \r\nof the first speech of Commander in Chief Fidel Castro \r\nRuz in this Hall, with that memorable sentence that if \r\nthe philosophy of plunder disappears, then the \r\nphilosophy of war will have disappeared (see \r\nA/PV.872). \r\nA/65/PV.19  \r\n \r\n10-55122 46 \r\n \r\n Sixty million people had to die in the Second \r\nWorld War so that the leaders of the time could create \r\nthe United Nations with the aim of saving succeeding \r\ngenerations from the scourge of war. \r\n Today, the children and grandchildren of that \r\ngeneration realize that the human race is faced with the \r\nthreat of extinction. Within a few decades, the \r\ndegradation of living conditions on the planet will be \r\nirreversible. The same could happen in a few hours if \r\nonly a small part of the nuclear arsenal were to be \r\nused. Those who met in San Francisco to draft the \r\nCharter of the United Nations could not have imagined \r\nthe threat now posed by global warming or the nuclear \r\nwinter. \r\n While we deliberate here, as Comrade Fidel has \r\nwarned, powerful and influential forces in the United \r\nStates and Israel are paving the way to launch a \r\nmilitary attack against the Islamic Republic of Iran. \r\nFor its part, the Security Council, possibly under the \r\nillusion of preventing that, is going ahead with \r\napplying sanctions against that country, which, \r\ntogether with the unilateral sanctions illegally imposed \r\nby a group of States, seek to strangle the Iranian \r\neconomy. \r\n The recent and politically biased report issued by \r\nthe Director General of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency has contributed to increasing the \r\ntensions and has provided a pretext for military \r\nescalation. Should that aggression in fact materialize, it \r\nwould be a crime against the Iranian people and an \r\nassault against peace and international law that could \r\nignite a conflict that will certainly turn nuclear. The \r\ntoll would be millions of lives and the impact on the \r\nenvironment, the economy and world stability \r\nincalculable. \r\n Who could assert otherwise, and on the basis of \r\nwhat guarantees? How could it be argued that the \r\npresent course of events is distancing the planet from \r\nwar in the Middle East? The threat is too serious to \r\ntrust in the capacity of the Security Council, where the \r\nmain actor responsible for the crisis has relied on its \r\nability to impose its designs. \r\n The wars against Iraq and Afghanistan \r\ndemonstrate that we cannot entrust one or a few \r\nGovernments with the authority to decide when all \r\ndiplomatic steps to prevent a war have been exhausted, \r\nwhen the use of force becomes unavoidable, and when \r\nthe death of hundreds of thousands or millions of \r\npeople and the destabilization of a large area of the \r\nplanet — or all these things together — are inevitable. \r\nSanctions, sieges and conflict are not the way to \r\npreserve international peace and security. On the \r\ncontrary, dialogue, negotiation and adherence to the \r\nprinciple of the sovereign equality of States are the \r\nonly way to avoid war. \r\n Cuba commends and encourages the efforts of all \r\nthose countries, such as China, Russia, Brazil and \r\nTurkey, that strive to find peaceful solutions, and calls \r\non the international community to support such \r\ninitiatives. It is the duty of this General Assembly to \r\nofficially support those efforts. \r\n The United Nations must be radically reformed \r\nand the powers of this General Assembly restored. The \r\nSecurity Council must be recreated. It must be \r\nreiterated that the Secretary-General and all senior \r\nofficials of the international agencies, including the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, answer to all \r\nMember States, as set out in clear mandates adopted in \r\naccordance with the Charter and the rules of procedure. \r\n The serious threat posed by nuclear weapons will be \r\nsolved only with their total elimination and prohibition. \r\nThe manipulation surrounding non-proliferation — based \r\non double standards and political interest, the existence of \r\na club of the privileged and the denial to the countries of \r\nthe South of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy — must \r\nstop. We urge the United States, the main nuclear Power, \r\nto stop opposing the negotiation of binding agreements \r\nthat could rid us once and for all of this threat within a set \r\ntime frame. Given the great lethal power and the ongoing \r\ndevelopment of conventional weapons, we will also have \r\nto fight for complete and general disarmament. \r\n In order to move ahead on those tasks, the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement submitted a proposal that has \r\ngone unheeded. The proposal envisages a plan of \r\naction that includes the establishment of nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zones. It is urgent to establish such a zone \r\nin the Middle East, where Israel is the only country \r\nthat opposes it. Success in this effort would contribute \r\nsignificantly to dispelling the threats of conflict and \r\nnuclear proliferation and to achieving lasting peace in \r\nthat region. \r\n The floods that have affected Pakistan, Central \r\nAmerica and many other countries in the most diverse \r\nlatitudes, as well as the droughts and extreme \r\ntemperatures that have devastated Russia, are a tragic \r\nreminder of the threats of a climate out of balance. In \r\n A/65/PV.19\r\n \r\n47 10-55122 \r\n \r\nthe face of such a serious threat, no selfish interests or \r\nnarrow political agendas that prevent the adoption of \r\nconcrete and binding agreements at the next \r\nConference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change should \r\nprevail. The developed countries, which bear the \r\ngreatest responsibility for global warming, should \r\naccept more ambitious goals for reducing greenhouse \r\ngas emissions and refrain from destroying the \r\nframework established by the Convention and its \r\nKyoto Protocol. \r\n It would be very irresponsible of the \r\nGovernments of the industrialized countries to ignore \r\nthe legitimate claims of the non-governmental \r\norganizations and social movements that were brutally \r\nsuppressed in Copenhagen and later met in \r\nCochabamba barely five months ago to defend Mother \r\nEarth, or to again seek to deceive public opinion by \r\nblaming the emerging economies. \r\n We call for the full support of the international \r\ncommunity for Venezuela in its struggle. The victory in \r\nyesterday’s parliamentary elections demonstrates the \r\nbroad majority support of the people for President \r\nChávez and the Bolivarian revolution, which have \r\nsuffered North American interference and the scorn and \r\ndisinformation campaigns of the oligarchic groups and \r\nmedia empires. \r\n Now that the television cameras have left Haiti, \r\nwe call for the pledges of international assistance to be \r\nhonoured. The noble Haitian people need resources for \r\nreconstruction and, above all, for development. \r\n The United States Government is aware of Cuba’s \r\nreadiness to coexist in a climate of peace, respect and \r\nsovereign equality, which we have expressly conveyed \r\nthrough official channels and which I reiterate here on \r\nbehalf of President Raúl Castro. I am convinced that \r\nthe development of relations based on international law \r\nand the purposes and principles of the United Nations \r\nwould enable Cuba and the United States to address \r\nmany of their differences and to resolve others. It \r\nwould help to create an atmosphere conducive to trying \r\nto solve the problems of our region and, at the same \r\ntime, provide significant support to the interests of our \r\nrespective peoples. \r\n The agenda for dialogue and bilateral cooperation \r\ninitiatives submitted to President Obama’s Administration \r\non 14 July 2009, which I publicly announced in this Hall \r\nexactly a year ago (see A/64/PV.11), have yet to receive a \r\nresponse. The North American Government has shown no \r\nwillingness to address essential matters on the bilateral \r\nagenda, so the official talks that have been held without \r\ngreat progress have been limited to specific issues. \r\n Contrary to expectations, even within the United \r\nStates itself, its Government does not seem willing to \r\namend even the most irrational and universally rejected \r\naspects of its policy against Cuba. The main element in \r\nour bilateral relations is the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial blockade that the United States Government \r\nimposes against my country directly and through the \r\nextraterritorial application of its laws. The blockade \r\nhas been the subject of 18 resolutions that, with the \r\nalmost unanimous support of Member States, have \r\nconsistently called for its end. \r\n However, in the past two years, there has been no \r\nchange in the policy of blockade and subversion \r\nagainst Cuba, even though all know that the President \r\nof that country is vested with sufficient authority to \r\nmake real change and enjoys the broad majority \r\nsupport of the North American people in that respect. \r\n For United States citizens or foreigners residing \r\nin that country, travelling to Cuba remains illegal. It is \r\nimpossible to sell Cuban products or products \r\ncontaining Cuban components or technology to the \r\nUnited States. With very limited exceptions, Cuba is \r\nforbidden to acquire, here or in any other country, any \r\nproduct containing a fraction of American input or \r\ntechnology. Financial transactions in United States \r\ndollars, whether linked to Cuba or not, can be either \r\nconfiscated or frozen and the banks involved may be \r\nfined. Fines worth several millions are imposed on \r\nUnited States and foreign companies for violating the \r\nvenal blockade laws. \r\n In addition, and in open contradiction of \r\ninternational norms, Cuba’s broadcasting space \r\ncontinues to be violated and radio and television \r\nbroadcasts continue to be used for subversive purposes, \r\nwhile millions in federal funds are used to foment \r\npolitical instability in my country. Part of Cuba’s \r\nterritory has been seized by the United States, which \r\nhas imposed a military base in Guantánamo that has \r\nbecome a centre of torture beyond the jurisdiction of \r\ninternational humanitarian law. \r\n United States immigration policy towards Cuba, \r\nbased on the Cuban Adjustment Act, is a politically \r\nmotivated exception that encourages illegal migration \r\nand costs human lives. Cuba’s inclusion on the United \r\nA/65/PV.19  \r\n \r\n10-55122 48 \r\n \r\nStates’ spurious list of countries that sponsor \r\ninternational terrorism is deeply immoral. \r\n Our demand, and the universal appeal concerning \r\nit, is well known. The five Cuban anti-terrorists who \r\nhave been incarcerated in the United States for 12 years \r\nas political prisoners must be immediately released. \r\nSetting them free would be an act of justice that would \r\nenable President Obama to show his true commitment to \r\ncombating terrorism in our own hemisphere. \r\n The President of the United States still has the \r\nopportunity to make a historical rectification of an \r\nutterly futile 50-year genocidal policy left over from \r\nthe cold war. It would be an act of resolve that could \r\nonly encourage the support of those who elected him \r\nfor change and of the community of nations that votes \r\nfor it every year. Whatever the circumstances, the \r\nCuban revolution will unyieldingly and tenaciously \r\npursue the sovereign path chosen by our people and \r\nshall not cease in its endeavours, based on the precepts \r\nof Martí and Fidel, to overcome all injustice. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Jean-Paul Adam, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of \r\nSeychelles. \r\n Mr. Adam (Seychelles): May I take this \r\nopportunity to join those who have come before me in \r\ncongratulating His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss on his \r\nelection as President of our Assembly and on his \r\ndiligent stewardship of the proceedings thus far. I also \r\nthank and congratulate His Excellency Mr. Ali \r\nAbdussalam Treki for his leadership and drive at the \r\nhead of the sixty-fourth session of the Assembly. \r\n We spent the first three days last week debating \r\nthe progress made — or not made, as the case may \r\nbe — in attaining the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) by 2015. For many of us, there are still \r\nformidable struggles ahead. For Seychelles, while we \r\nhave made huge strides forward towards meeting these \r\nGoals, we are also pedalling furiously so as not to slip \r\nback on what we have already worked hard to achieve. \r\nThis brings to mind the question: Are the MDGs an end \r\nin themselves? The task does not end in 2015. It cannot \r\nend in 2015. What happens, and where are we headed \r\nafter that? \r\n Those of us that are middle-income countries, and \r\nthat includes many small island developing States \r\n(SIDS), already know the different set of challenges \r\nthat these questions bring — questions that other \r\ncountries will also have to face as they achieve and \r\nmove beyond the MDGs. The debate needs to start \r\nnow, as we fast approach 2015, on how countries will \r\naccess the affordable financing they will need not just \r\nto move beyond the MDGs, but to ensure that they \r\nkeep and do not lose what they have achieved. \r\n That is why Seychelles announced at the MDG \r\nsummit that we will be engaging with the United \r\nNations system to enter into new commitments towards \r\nsetting MDG-plus targets, the overall objective being \r\nto make sustainable development a reality beyond the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and the next \r\ngeneration. \r\n We are all aware of the differences among us in \r\nour sizes and populations. The needs of every Member \r\nof the United Nations are different. We have learned a \r\nlot about development over the years, and today we all \r\nknow that one-size-fits-all does not work. At the \r\nUnited Nations and other development organizations, \r\nwe have created development categories to facilitate \r\naccess for those most in need of the appropriate \r\nresources. Resources are always stretched, and, as we \r\nmove beyond 2015, we must make sure that \r\ndevelopment categories truly facilitate development. \r\nSuch categories must not become a way to punish those \r\nthat succeed in development. \r\n And we must not allow small island developing \r\nStates to fall through the cracks between the categories. \r\nMiddle-income SIDS face special problems that the \r\ninternational development architecture does not \r\ncurrently make provision for. The funding that is \r\navailable to SIDS is fragmented. There is no reliable \r\nfunding to them. Even on issues where SIDS are most \r\naffected, such as climate change, there are many \r\nbarriers to our ability to access funding, not least the \r\nuse of gross domestic product per capita criteria to \r\ndefine eligibility for funding. \r\n The question that will come up increasingly as we \r\ntry to answer the question of how to fund development \r\nbeyond 2015 is where SIDS can go to finance their \r\ndevelopment. The answer is that we need to define a \r\nspecific development category for SIDS to be used by \r\nall development partners. \r\n That is why small island developing States say \r\n“let us start at home” by requesting the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to initiate a system-wide review of how \r\neffectively the United Nations and its various agencies \r\n A/65/PV.19\r\n \r\n49 10-55122 \r\n \r\nare actually supporting SIDS, and how that can be \r\nimproved. This could be done by an inter-agency \r\nworking group that would provide concrete \r\nrecommendations to this sixty-fifth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly as to how the United Nations system \r\ncould better support the specific needs of SIDS. The \r\nworld economic and financial crisis has reinforced the \r\nvulnerability of island States to external shocks. More \r\nthan ever, it has illustrated that islands need as much \r\nsupport as possible if they are to be able to pursue \r\ndevelopment successfully. \r\n As I have already highlighted, there are gaps in \r\nthe existing development system. Those gaps mean that \r\nwe must be prepared to be innovative in meeting the \r\ndevelopment challenges that are looming. We welcome \r\nthe efforts of several countries and of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to adopt new and innovative means to finance \r\ndevelopment. In Seychelles, the pressures of the food, \r\nfuel and financial crises meant that in 2008 we had to \r\nengage in wide-ranging macroeconomic reform with \r\nthe support of the Bretton Woods institutions, the Asian \r\nDevelopment Bank and our Paris Club creditors. We \r\nare most grateful to all our partners for their support. \r\n I think it is interesting to note that while we were \r\nrestructuring our old debt, our economy began to grow \r\nthanks to new foreign direct investment, most of it \r\nfrom the developing world — the Gulf, Africa and \r\nAsia. There are many new channels for development \r\nthat remain relatively unexplored and unstructured. \r\n I would like also to brief the Assembly on a \r\ngroundbreaking renewable energy project being \r\nundertaken in Seychelles with the support of the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates Government. This project is an \r\nexample of how a small island can have access to \r\naffordable financing to reduce its dependence on fossil \r\nfuels — one of the things that make islands most \r\nvulnerable.  These South-South dynamics are often \r\noverlooked in the traditional dynamics of the United \r\nNations. Often, we also waste a lot of time on \r\nideological debates that further obscure the true \r\nobjectives of development. We need to be pragmatic \r\nand we need to act. \r\n Climate change, and in particular sea-level rise, \r\nremain by far the greatest threats to small islands. \r\nMuch more ambitious global action needs to be taken \r\nto significantly reduce emissions and implement \r\nadaptation in a manner that will ensure the \r\ndevelopment aspirations and survival of all countries, \r\nsmall islands in particular. We need to ensure that fast-\r\nstart funding is also available for disbursement as \r\nquickly as possible. \r\n I must stress the concern of small islands that \r\nmuch of the funding available to adapt to climate \r\nchange is being channelled through traditional funding \r\nchannels. This means that most SIDS will miss out on \r\nfunds because of our middle-income status. Climate \r\nchange requires funding mechanisms that do not rely \r\nonly on business as usual. We need a real fast start. For \r\nthe moment, we are still stuck at the starting block. \r\n While we reflect on the governance of the United \r\nNations, we must also spare no effort to ensure that we \r\ncan be effective in resolving conflict in those areas \r\nwhere human suffering is at its worst. In the Horn of \r\nAfrica, we remain deeply concerned about the ongoing \r\nsituation in Somalia. We convey our solidarity to the \r\nSomali people and the Transitional Federal \r\nGovernment that is trying to restore peace and security. \r\nWe fully support the efforts of the African Union, \r\nthrough the African Union Mission in Somalia, and of \r\nthe United Nations. \r\n It is clear, however, that we must now be \r\nprepared to move beyond what we have already tried \r\nand tested. The ongoing problems associated with the \r\nsituation in Somalia also continue, unfortunately, to \r\nhamper the conditions for development in the region. \r\nThe threat of terrorism is rising, while the scourge of \r\npiracy continues to spread further afield, as far east as \r\nMaldives and as far south as Madagascar. \r\n Seychelles has worked hard to ensure that our \r\nmaritime zones remain safe, and we thank all our \r\npartners for their support. Nonetheless, piracy has led \r\nto direct losses in our economy of over 4 per cent of \r\ngross domestic product. We welcome the new regional \r\nproject on piracy being developed by the Indian Ocean \r\nCommission and the Common Market for Eastern and \r\nSouthern Africa, with the support of the European \r\nUnion. This project approaches the problem from \r\nseveral angles simultaneously as we attempt to \r\nstrengthen the regional capacity for patrols and \r\nsurveillance, strengthen the legal and judicial capacity \r\nof our countries, and mitigate the negative effects on \r\nour economies. \r\n I would like to thank our friends and neighbours \r\nfor their support on this issue. It is an issue that \r\ndepends on all countries working together, both from \r\nwithin the region and beyond. We must also continue to \r\nA/65/PV.19  \r\n \r\n10-55122 50 \r\n \r\nengage with the Somalia to strengthen its ability to \r\nbuild its own institutions. \r\n Seychelles also strongly believes that the \r\ninternational community must strengthen its efforts to \r\ntackle transnational crimes that are often linked to \r\ninstability and insecurity, from money-laundering to \r\npeople trafficking.
