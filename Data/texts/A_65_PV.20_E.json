(Switzerland) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 3.15 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n  Address by Sir Michael Somare, Prime Minister \r\nof Papua New Guinea \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the Prime Minister of \r\nPapua New Guinea. \r\n Sir Michael Somare, Prime Minister of Papua \r\nNew Guinea, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I have great \r\npleasure in welcoming His Excellency Sir Michael \r\nSomare, Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, and \r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly. \r\n Sir Michael Somare (Papua New Guinea): First \r\nof all, let me join other delegations in offering \r\ncongratulations to His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss on \r\nhis election to the post of President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-fifth session. With your guidance, \r\nSir, my delegation is confident that we can discuss, in \r\nthe spirit of cooperation, the different global challenges \r\nconfronting us in order to further the common good of \r\nhumankind. \r\n We are meeting at a time when the world is going \r\nthrough some mixed developments. While, on some \r\nparts of the globe, countries are experiencing relative \r\npeace, in other parts they are embroiled in armed \r\nconflict. While some countries are enjoying economic \r\ngrowth and budget surpluses, others are experiencing \r\neconomic stagnation or contraction. \r\n The focus at this session of the General Assembly \r\non reviewing the progress on the implementation of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) is most \r\nappropriate. The achievement of the eight cross-cutting \r\nGoals we set for ourselves would improve the quality \r\nof life of all of our peoples. Just last week, we \r\nconcluded a stocktaking of the progress in the \r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nWhile the results on the scorecard are mixed, the \r\ncommitment of Member States to continuing to \r\nimplement measures to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals by 2015 is unequivocal. \r\n Papua New Guinea, like many developing \r\ncountries, has had measured success. As many noted \r\nlast week, the global economic crisis has had an \r\nadverse bearing on the implementation of the MDGs. I \r\nwould add, however, that had the resources promised in \r\n2000 for implementing the MDGs been made available, \r\nthe assessment sheet for many developing countries \r\nwould have looked more positive. Papua New Guinea \r\napplauds the commitment of $40 billion for poverty \r\nalleviation, especially to improve the health of children \r\nand women. It is our hope that this will be a new \r\nresource envelope and not repackaged old \r\ncommitments. \r\n We have noted the calls for countries to take \r\ngreater ownership of the implementation of the eight \r\nMillennium Development Goals. Papua New Guinea \r\nhas accepted these challenges. We will continue to do \r\nA/65/PV.20  \r\n \r\n10-55128 2 \r\n \r\nall we can to meet the obligations we assumed when \r\nwe joined others in 2000 to adopt the Millennium \r\nDeclaration (resolution 55/2).  \r\n The Permanent Representative of Papua New \r\nGuinea to the United Nations outlined in detail last \r\nweek our country’s efforts to achieve the MDGs by \r\n2015. Allow me to reiterate some of the main actions \r\nwe are taking. Papua New Guinea has adapted and \r\nlocalized the MDGs by establishing 15 targets and 67 \r\nindicators within our medium-term development \r\nstrategy for the period 2005 to 2010. We have \r\ncalibrated our 2011-2015 medium-term development \r\nplan and designed our development strategic plan to \r\nachieve the MDGs. In addition, we have drafted our \r\n2050 Vision Statement to be consistent with the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. \r\n Our official development assistance programmes \r\nwith our donor partners are being gradually realigned \r\nto enable Papua New Guinea to eventually meet its \r\nMDG targets. On a wider scale, we urge donor partners \r\nto abide by the principles of the Paris Declaration on \r\nAid Effectiveness and the Accra Agenda for Action. In \r\nthe Pacific, we have adopted the Cairns Compact to \r\nbetter coordinate development assistance and to ensure \r\neffective delivery. Developed countries also need to \r\nraise their official development assistance to 0.7 per \r\ncent of their gross national income, in line with their \r\ncommitments. \r\n In line with our commitment towards MDG 3, my \r\nGovernment has submitted proposed legislation to the \r\nPapua New Guinea legislature to reserve 22 seats for \r\nwomen in the national Parliament. With respect to \r\nMDG 2, we have introduced a universal primary \r\neducation policy and aim to achieve free primary-level \r\neducation for all of our children by 2015. \r\n Papua New Guinea is under no illusion that the \r\nachievement of the MDGs is a unilateral undertaking. \r\nThis is a joint undertaking between developed and \r\ndeveloping countries, just as it is a cooperative effort \r\nbetween the Government and civil society \r\norganizations. It is for this reason that my country is \r\ndisappointed that MDG 8 on a global partnership for \r\ndevelopment appears to attract little serious interest \r\nfrom the developed countries. We note that the real \r\nvalue of aid has remained constant and that the Doha \r\nDevelopment Round remains an unfinished affair. \r\n Also of concern to us is the inability of many \r\ndeveloping countries to enjoy equitable treatment from \r\nthe Bretton Woods institutions. Our efforts to reduce \r\ndeforestation in tropical rain forest countries, which I \r\nwill touch on later, have met with the same apathetic \r\nresponse. Despite the best of efforts within the World \r\nTrade Organization and Asia Pacific Economic \r\nCooperation forum processes, the international trading \r\nenvironment continues to be characterized by \r\ninequalities. Often less visibly but still harmfully, \r\nglobal trade continues to be encumbered by trade \r\nprotectionist measures. \r\n In the area of international peace and security, the \r\nworld, unfortunately, is no safer today than it was when \r\nthe United Nations was established. War continues to \r\nbe waged in Afghanistan. Iraq continues to suffer from \r\nregular suicide bombings. The Korean peninsula \r\ncontinues to be a flashpoint in the Asia region, and the \r\nMiddle East continues to be a hotbed of tension. \r\n Likewise, regional conflicts and ethnic tensions \r\ncontinue to erupt in many parts of Africa, Latin \r\nAmerica and Eastern Europe. The international \r\ncommunity needs to do more to address these conflicts, \r\nespecially the Afghanistan and Iraq issues. The fragile \r\npeace and global security environment is further \r\nexemplified by the continued presence of Blue Helmets \r\nin many parts of world. \r\n Papua New Guinea commends the efforts of \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping forces, many of which \r\nhave to operate in very trying circumstances. We wish \r\nto thank the troop-contributing countries for bearing \r\nthis onerous responsibility on all our behalves. For our \r\npart, I am pleased to announce that my Government \r\nhas enacted the International Obligations Bill to \r\nprovide the legal framework for Papua New Guinea’s \r\nparticipation in United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations. \r\n Acts of terrorism continue and the threat of \r\nanother terror attack on a scale similar to that of 9/11 \r\nremains real. The international community must \r\ncontinue to strengthen its cooperation to address this \r\nscourge. \r\n Nuclear weapons continue to cause anxiety in our \r\nsecurity considerations. While some may argue that \r\nnuclear weapons are the reason why the world has not \r\nfought another world war, my Government believes \r\nthat these weapons of mass destruction are unnecessary \r\nand need to be eliminated. As part of that process, we \r\nsupport efforts to strengthen the mechanisms aimed at \r\nthe non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. \r\n A/65/PV.20\r\n \r\n3 10-55128 \r\n \r\n As for other countries of the Pacific region, \r\nclimate change is of great concern to Papua New \r\nGuinea. We need no scientist to tell us of the negative \r\nimpact of climate change. We live it and we suffer \r\nfrom it. Many of our islands, such as the Carterets, and \r\ncoastal habitats like my own home area of the Murik \r\nLakes are being gradually submerged by rising sea \r\nlevels. The result is that people living in these areas are \r\nbecoming environmental refugees. Lowland diseases \r\nsuch as malaria are now occurring in the highlands of \r\nPapua New Guinea. Unusual weather patterns, such as \r\nincreased incidences of cyclones, frequent heavy \r\nflooding and mudslides, are causing havoc in our \r\neconomies and exacting untold suffering on our people. \r\n All these attendant climate change challenges are \r\ntaxing the budgetary resources of our countries and \r\nundermining our development plans. The international \r\ncommunity has rightly recognized the insidious effects \r\nof climate change and agreed to take concerted action \r\nunder the ambit of the Kyoto Protocol, the Bali Road \r\nMap and the Copenhagen Accord to address the issue. \r\n Papua New Guinea urges our developed partners \r\nto shoulder greater responsibility for reducing \r\ngreenhouse gas emissions and for assisting developing \r\ncountries, particularly small island States, to adapt to \r\nclimate change and its effects. \r\n Resources for adaptation and mitigation \r\nmeasures, particularly those committed in Copenhagen, \r\nmust be made more readily available to developing \r\ncountries. We note the initiative announced by Japan \r\nlast week during the MDG review and look forward to \r\nfurther details of what it constitutes. We also applaud \r\nthe financial commitments and policy initiatives that \r\nChina announced to assist developing countries to \r\nimplement the Millennium Development Goals. \r\n Mr. Ndong Mba (Equatorial Guinea), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair. \r\n As for Papua New Guinea, with our colleagues \r\nfrom the Coalition for Rainforest Nations, we have \r\ncommitted ourselves to a programme of reducing \r\nemissions from deforestation and forest degradation, \r\nmore commonly known as REDD-plus. As this is the \r\nInternational Year of Biodiversity, let me say that the \r\nREDD-plus initiative will assure the protection of \r\nimportant biodiversity. \r\n In addition, at the national level Papua New \r\nGuinea has adopted an action plan for climate-\r\ncompatible development and established the Office of \r\nClimate Change and Development explicitly to oversee \r\nour actions on climate change issues. As part of our \r\nstrategy to reduce our carbon footprint, we are now \r\naggressively seeking to develop more hydropower and \r\ngeothermal sources for our energy requirements. We \r\nhave also embarked on a major commercialization \r\nexercise of our gas reserves to deliver a cleaner energy \r\nalternative to the world. \r\n Many of us here have recognized the need to \r\nreform the United Nations in order to take account of \r\nthe changed circumstances under which it operates, as \r\nwell as the new and emerging challenges that it must \r\naddress. We note and commend the Secretary-General \r\nfor the ongoing administrative and institutional reforms \r\nhe is undertaking to improve the efficiency of the \r\nUnited Nations in better serving Member States. We \r\nurge all stakeholders in the Security Council reform \r\nagenda to demonstrate courage and leadership so that \r\nthe composition and workings of the Council can be \r\nreformed in ways that are equitable and reflect the \r\ncurrent geopolitical and economic realities. \r\n Papua New Guinea has previously stated at this \r\nAssembly that we believe that the expansion of the \r\nmembership of the Security Council is logical to allow \r\nfor representation from certain developed and \r\ndeveloping countries. In that regard, I wish to reaffirm \r\nPapua New Guinea’s support for Germany and Japan to \r\nbe included as permanent members in an expanded \r\nSecurity Council. \r\n Finally, the inequities that exist in the global \r\ntrading system today are daunting, but they can be \r\nresolved. With genuine partnership, we can and shall \r\novercome them. The world may not be any safer today \r\nthan it was when the United Nations was established \r\nsome 65 years ago, but having been able to avert \r\nanother world war is ample testimony that the \r\ninternational community has the political will to \r\naddress tensions and discord in a measured way. The \r\nUnited Nations and the international legal architecture \r\nthat it has achieved, developed and promoted have \r\nplayed a significant role in that regard, thus \r\nunderscoring the continuing relevance of this body. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister of Papua New Guinea for the statement \r\nhe has just made. \r\n Sir Michael Somare, Prime Minister of Papua \r\nNew Guinea, was escorted from the rostrum. \r\nA/65/PV.20  \r\n \r\n10-55128 4 \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Batbold Sukhbaatar, Prime \r\nMinister of Mongolia  \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of Mongolia. \r\n Mr. Batbold Sukhbaatar, Prime Minister of \r\nMongolia, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency  \r\nMr. Batbold Sukhbaatar, Prime Minister of Mongolia, \r\nand inviting him to address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Sukhbaatar (Mongolia): This session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly is taking place at a time when \r\ncertain signs of recovery are being observed in the \r\nwake of the global economic and financial crisis, and \r\ncome on the heels of sharp spikes in food and energy \r\nprices. Although the world is still grappling with the \r\neffects of those multiple and interrelated crises, the call \r\nof last week’s summit on the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) for intensified collective action gives \r\nhope for optimism. \r\n As the world plunged into the worst economic \r\ncrisis since the Great Depression, the best minds \r\naround the globe sought clear answers as to what went \r\nwrong and what needed to be rectified. Many argued \r\nthat the economic theories referred to as neoliberalism \r\nor market fundamentalism, which have prevailed for \r\nthe past quarter century, were flawed. Their main \r\npremise — based on the notion, for instance, that \r\nmarkets are self-correcting and that regulation is \r\naccordingly unnecessary — seems to have been proved \r\nwrong. \r\n The experience of countries and regions that have \r\nachieved rapid growth and progress in poverty \r\nreduction has shown that the State can deliberately \r\nintervene in the economy and even correct market-\r\nbased incentives in such a way as to promote inclusive \r\ngrowth and sustainable development. Hence, a new \r\nconcept of development is emerging that envisions a \r\nreversal in the thinking on the roles of the State and the \r\nmarket. \r\n As a generator of the new and innovative ideas \r\nand development notions that have changed the world \r\nin the past, the United Nations is, in our view, the right \r\nplace to engage intimately in nurturing such \r\nfundamental concepts, which could have a huge impact \r\non the development policies and prospects of its \r\nMember States. That could prove to be an important \r\naspect of the deliberations that the President proposed \r\nas the theme for this debate — “Reaffirming the central \r\nrole of the United Nations in global governance”. \r\n It has been widely recognized that today’s global \r\nchallenges require global solutions. The underlying \r\nprinciples and characteristics of the United Nations \r\nmake it an indispensable part of the evolving global \r\ngovernance system. The United Nations is the world’s \r\nmost universal, legitimate and authoritative \r\norganization and a political centre for global \r\ncooperation. It represents a unique forum for \r\nsynthesizing solutions to global problems, ranging \r\nfrom nuclear weapons to climate change, and \r\ndevelopment to human rights. It is at the United \r\nNations that we see world leaders commit themselves \r\nto making the world a safer, fairer, more prosperous \r\nand greener place to live for this and future \r\ngenerations. \r\n Yet, it is a fact that there are challenges that have \r\nfound or are seeking to find solution outside the United \r\nNations. A legitimate question would be: why? There \r\nmay be many factors at play and many facets to cover \r\nin finding an easy answer to that question. But what \r\nhas emerged as obvious from our deliberations is the \r\nfact that, if the United Nations is to reaffirm its central \r\nrole in global governance, it will have to be efficient \r\nand its reform vigorously pursued. \r\n The revitalization of the General Assembly must \r\nbe further pursued so that our deliberations and \r\ndecisions have a more practical and meaningful impact \r\non the lives of the people in whose name we act here. \r\nThe role of the Economic and Social Council in global \r\neconomic decision-making must be enhanced. The \r\nreform of the Security Council, aimed at making it \r\nmore representative of the world’s current reality, will \r\ncertainly be a critical boost to reaffirming the central \r\nrole of the United Nations in global governance. \r\nMongolia stands for a just and equitable enlargement \r\nof the Security Council by increasing the number of \r\npermanent and non-permanent seats and ensuring the \r\nfair representation of developing and developed \r\ncountries alike. \r\n Development, peace and security, and human \r\nrights are the three main pillars of the United Nations. \r\nMongolia welcomes the revitalization of the United \r\nNations development agenda, as attested by the High-\r\nlevel Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly on the \r\n A/65/PV.20\r\n \r\n5 10-55128 \r\n \r\nMillennium Development Goals last week and, most \r\nimportantly, by the vibrant international debate in the \r\nlead-up to the summit. As a result, we are clearly in a \r\nmuch better place today as regards world leaders’ \r\ncommitment to intensifying the efforts towards the \r\nachievement of the MDGs by 2015. \r\n On our part, my Government recommitted itself, \r\nat the Summit, to the acceleration of our efforts \r\ntowards poverty reduction, gender equality and \r\nenvironmental sustainability, the three MDGs where \r\nwe are lagging behind. We have committed ourselves \r\nto a multisectoral, participatory and people-centred \r\napproach to the implementation of the MDGs, to \r\nimproved governance as a foundation for successful \r\ndevelopment outcomes, and to better monitoring and \r\nevaluation of our work as we move forward. \r\n As we intensify our poverty reduction efforts at \r\nhome, we plan to focus more on issues of gender \r\nequality and the empowerment of women as a critical \r\npart of success. My Government is confident that the \r\nnewly created UN Women will be an important partner \r\nin this endeavour. This year, Mongolia presented its \r\nnational voluntary presentation on gender equality and \r\nthe empowerment of women to the Economic and \r\nSocial Council and will proceed to improve the \r\nlegislative framework enabling women to realize more \r\nfully their economical and political potential, have \r\nbetter access to health services for themselves and their \r\nchildren, and participate more visibly in democratic \r\ngovernance. \r\n Attending to the needs of the most vulnerable is \r\nat the core of the United Nations development agenda. \r\nAs a landlocked developing country, Mongolia, along \r\nwith other fellow Members, strives to advocate the \r\ninterests of that group of countries. Despite the \r\nprogress in implementing the priorities of the Almaty \r\nProgramme of Action, the landlocked developing \r\ncountries continue to be marginalized from \r\ninternational trade. They still experience higher costs \r\nof moving goods across borders, which puts their \r\nproducts at a competitive disadvantage and discourages \r\nforeign investment. \r\n With a view to maximizing our coordinated \r\nefforts for the full and effective implementation of the \r\nAlmaty Programme of Action and the MDGs through \r\nenhanced analytical capability and home-grown \r\nresearch on our specific needs, Mongolia initiated the \r\nestablishment of the International Think Tank for the \r\nLandlocked Developing Countries. I am delighted to \r\ninform Member States today that the multilateral \r\nagreement for that institution was endorsed by the \r\nministers for foreign affairs of the landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries last week at their ninth annual \r\nmeeting. I extend my Government’s sincere \r\nappreciation to all stakeholders, including the \r\nSecretary-General, the Office of the High \r\nRepresentative for the Least Developed Countries, \r\nLandlocked Developing Countries and Small Island \r\nDeveloping States, and our fellow members for their \r\nunwavering support. \r\n Climate change is another critical area for global \r\ngovernance. Building on progress achieved in \r\nCopenhagen in shaping a broad political consensus, it \r\nis imperative now to invigorate global negotiations \r\nunder the United Nations Framework Convention on \r\nClimate Change in the lead-up to the sixteenth session \r\nof the Conference of the Parties in Cancún later this \r\nyear. \r\n The impact of climate change on Mongolia is \r\nundeniable. In less than 20 years, more than 70 per \r\ncent of our territory has been affected by \r\ndesertification. Hundreds of rivers, springs and lakes \r\nhave dried up, causing water shortages and biodiversity \r\nloss. Yet, climate change adaptation and mitigation \r\ntechniques suitable for scaling up to meet the country’s \r\nneeds have yet to be fully identified and introduced. \r\nThe strategies and programmes in place have failed to \r\nyield the desired results, and the emergence of mining \r\nas a major industry has only heightened concerns over \r\nthe environment. The sustainable management of \r\nnatural resources and addressing the country’s \r\necological vulnerability will therefore need our \r\nsustained focus in the years ahead. Four issues — \r\nenforcement, dedication, financing and development \r\ncooperation — stand out as our priorities in addressing \r\nthese challenges. \r\n Last month, my Government held a special \r\nCabinet meeting in the sands of the Gobi Desert. \r\nDesertification is an issue of vital concern to more than \r\n1 billion people in over 100 countries. Continued land \r\ndegradation, be it from climate change or unsustainable \r\nagriculture, is a serious threat to the food security and, \r\nultimately, the human security of those affected. \r\nThrough the message sent from Gobi, my Government \r\nexpressed its firm resolve to effectively address \r\ndesertification within the framework of the United \r\nA/65/PV.20  \r\n \r\n10-55128 6 \r\n \r\nNations Decade for Deserts and the Fight Against \r\nDesertification. \r\n In 2010, we have seen renewed international \r\noptimism with regard to the multilateral disarmament \r\nagenda. This shift in climate was reinforced by the new \r\nSTART agreement and the outcome of the Nuclear \r\nSecurity Summit, both of which were welcomed by my \r\nGovernment and reflected in the outcome of the \r\nReview Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The \r\nConference agreed on forward-looking action plans \r\nthat impart much-needed momentum to the vision of a \r\nworld free of nuclear weapons. Mongolia welcomes \r\nthis outcome and is proud of the contribution it made \r\ntowards nuclear disarmament and nuclear  \r\nnon-proliferation by declaring its territory to be \r\nnuclear-weapon-free. This status is fully recognized by \r\nthe international community, as attested by the final \r\ndocument of the NPT Review Conference. \r\n Mongolia welcomes the increasing role of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in \r\ncontributing to freedom from fear and freedom from \r\nwant. The achievement of the MDGs will depend to \r\nsome extent on the contribution of nuclear applications \r\nin such areas as nuclear energy, health care, and food \r\nand environmental security. Mongolia is expanding its \r\ncooperation with the Agency, especially in human \r\nresource development and nuclear applications in \r\nhealth and agriculture. Our 2009-2014 country \r\nprogramme framework, signed last year with the \r\nAgency, added the development of nuclear energy \r\ninfrastructure and the country’s uranium reserves as \r\npriority areas of cooperation. \r\n This year, Mongolia has been designated one of \r\nthe eight Programme of Action for Cancer Therapy \r\nmodel demonstration site countries. This will help \r\nMongolia to most effectively address the increasing \r\ncancer epidemic and to share its experience with other \r\ndeveloping countries. I would like, therefore, to take \r\nthis opportunity to express my Government’s gratitude \r\nto IAEA and its Director General for their valuable \r\nsupport. \r\n Mongolia welcomes the second review of the \r\nUnited Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, \r\nwhich, while emphasizing national implementation, \r\nstressed the importance of assisting Member States in \r\nthis task. Mongolia takes seriously its responsibility to \r\ncontribute to the global counter-terrorism endeavour \r\nand is party to all anti-terrorism instruments. Last May, \r\nwe hosted, together with the United Nations, a \r\nsubregional workshop on the implementation of \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001). We firmly \r\nbelieve in the vital importance of furthering \r\ndevelopment, democracy and respect for human rights \r\nin fighting terrorism and in building States’ capacities \r\nto combat it. \r\n Peacekeeping is an important tool for global \r\ngovernance in the hands of the United Nations. Since \r\nits inception, United Nations peacekeeping has \r\ncontributed to preventing and managing violent \r\nconflicts and supporting nations in protecting and \r\nbuilding peace in a post-conflict environment. Over the \r\npast decade, it has undertaken important reforms to \r\nmake peacekeeping stronger, more effective and \r\ncomparatively cost-efficient. Mongolia wishes to see \r\nmore coherent interaction between the peacekeeping \r\nand peacebuilding efforts of the United Nations. \r\n Over the past decade, Mongolia has taken \r\ndeliberate steps to enhance its participation in United \r\nNations peacekeeping missions. Mongolia now \r\nparticipates in six United Nations-mandated \r\npeacekeeping operations — including the most \r\nchallenging ones in the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo, Chad and Darfur — and stands ready to further \r\nexpand its participation. \r\n In the recent past, Mongolia has been an active \r\nparticipant in international activities aimed at \r\nstrengthening institutions and processes of democratic \r\ngovernance, protecting human rights and promoting \r\ndemocratic consolidation. The 1992 Constitution of \r\nMongolia guarantees the Mongolian people \r\nfundamental freedoms and human rights. Mongolia is \r\nparty to all major international human rights \r\ninstruments. An independent National Human Rights \r\nCommission was set up, and a national human rights \r\naction programme adopted in 2003 is being \r\nimplemented. The programme is a main policy \r\ndocument that aims at improving the capacity and \r\naccountability of the authorities; enhancing the \r\nparticipation of civil society, mass media and the \r\nprivate sector; and encouraging public motivation for \r\nstrengthening human rights protections and combating \r\nhuman rights violations. All in all, our efforts can be \r\nsummed up by affirming that political commitment to \r\nthe protection and promotion of human rights, along \r\nwith the setting of standards, is in place in Mongolia. \r\n A/65/PV.20\r\n \r\n7 10-55128 \r\n \r\n However, as has been rightly said, no human \r\nrights record is perfect. The implementation of human \r\nrights commitments in my country is hampered largely \r\nby two gaps, namely, a knowledge gap and a capacity \r\ngap. Furthermore, emerging transboundary threats, \r\nsuch as the spread of HIV and AIDS and other \r\ninfectious diseases, human trafficking, migration and \r\nothers, require an adequate collective response based \r\non effective regional and international cooperation. \r\nMongolia looks forward to constructive engagement \r\nwith the Human Rights Council as it prepares to \r\nconsider our national human rights report under the \r\nUniversal Periodic Review in early November this \r\nyear. \r\n Direct civic engagement is essential to any type \r\nof governance, at both the national and the \r\ninternational levels. My Government endeavours to \r\nactively engage civil society and communities in policy \r\ndevelopment and implementation. We have a \r\npartnership agreement with civil society and, through \r\nour open Government website, citizens relay their \r\nviews and comments to assist in drafting policy papers \r\nand laws prior to their consideration by the Cabinet. \r\n Over the past two months, I have travelled \r\nextensively across the country to see first hand the \r\ndevelopment challenges being faced in the countryside \r\nand to hear views at the grass-roots level. This kind of \r\ndirect interaction is essential to identifying people’s \r\nimmediate and long-term needs alike and to reflecting \r\ntheir concerns in the Government’s activities. Earlier \r\nthis year, through the Mongolia Economic Forum, we \r\nalso had an extensive discussion on economic and \r\ndevelopment issues with businesses, civil society and \r\nmedia to set our priorities for the years ahead. \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n To have people employed, educated and healthy — \r\nin other words, human development — is at the heart \r\nof the policies and activities of my Government. \r\nTowards this end, my Government is pursuing policies \r\nto accelerate inclusive economic growth through wide-\r\nscale industrialization and by undertaking mega-projects \r\nin mining and infrastructure development. National \r\nwealth will be distributed to each and every citizen of \r\nMongolia through a newly established human \r\ndevelopment fund in the form of regular allowances, as \r\nwell as through health care, education and housing \r\nbenefits. \r\n Mongolia has the honour and privilege to assume \r\nthe chairmanship of the Community of Democracies \r\nnext year, and looks forward to a strong collaboration \r\nwith fellow members and other global stakeholders. In \r\nconclusion, may I reiterate Mongolia’s strong \r\ncommitment to and support for the United Nations — a \r\nstrong, inclusive and open United Nations as the \r\nguarantor of global governance. \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Mongolia for the statement \r\nhe has just made. \r\n Mr. Batbold Sukhbaatar, Prime Minister of \r\nMongolia, was escorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Winston Baldwin Spencer, \r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof Antigua and Barbuda \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Antigua and Barbuda. \r\n Mr. Winston Baldwin Spencer, Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Antigua and \r\nBarbuda, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I have great \r\npleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Winston \r\nBaldwin Spencer, Prime Minister and Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Antigua and Barbuda, and inviting \r\nhim to address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Spencer (Antigua and Barbuda): Let me at \r\nthe outset commend you, Sir, on your unanimous \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-fifth session. I pledge my delegation’s support for \r\nyour efforts to successfully move forward the agenda \r\nof this session. I also wish to commend your \r\npredecessor, Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session, for his \r\nstewardship, and Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for \r\nhis leadership of the Secretariat. \r\n Your choice of theme for our general debate —\r\n”Reaffirming the central role of the United Nations in \r\nglobal governance” — is both appropriate and timely. \r\nAfter 65 years of operations, there is sufficient history \r\nto provide material for objective review and enough \r\nfuture to justify such a rigorous assessment. \r\nA/65/PV.20  \r\n \r\n10-55128 8 \r\n \r\n In my own view, arising from the many successes \r\nof the United Nations in a wide range of areas, one of \r\nthe most enduring lessons the past 65 years have taught \r\nus as a global community is the wisdom and supremacy \r\nof multilateralism. Even where multilateralism has \r\nfailed to secure lasting solutions to some of the world’s \r\nproblems, it has laid unshakable foundations on which \r\nbilateral understanding can be built. \r\n The resolution of the conflict in the Middle East, \r\nfor example, has long eluded the international \r\ncommunity. This is why we are hopeful with regard to \r\nthe latest efforts at peaceful negotiations between \r\nIsrael and Palestine being brokered by the current \r\nUnited States Administration. If there is to be lasting \r\npeace in the Middle East, there must be two States, \r\nIsrael and Palestine, living side by side in peace and \r\nsecurity. There must be direct negotiations with both \r\nparties, Israel and Palestine, at the same table. Israel \r\nmust heed the international community’s unanimous \r\ncall to extend the moratorium on disputed settlements, \r\nwhich would contribute positively to the negotiations. \r\nAnd all the countries of that region must commit to and \r\nwork towards a lasting and durable Middle East peace. \r\n Today, global governance relates not only to \r\nconcerns about peace, security and political self-\r\ndetermination. Importantly, global governance \r\nembraces such imperatives as the elimination of \r\nhunger, disease and ignorance; administering a stable \r\nand robust international financial system; and ensuring \r\nfair trade, adequate shelter and the preservation of our \r\nvery delicate environment. \r\n Never in the history of human existence has our \r\nplanet been faced with a greater urgency to meet these \r\nobjectives. The scale of poverty, conflicts, global \r\nwarming, the economic and financial crisis, migration, \r\npandemics, terrorism and international crime demands \r\na collective global effort employing common and \r\ncoordinated strategies. The extent of these problems \r\nand the enormity of their consequences are clearly \r\nbeyond the resource and management capabilities of \r\nany one nation. \r\n I believe that our United Nations, with its near \r\nuniversal membership, is the only global body that has \r\nthe legitimacy and operational structures to undertake \r\nthe task of forging the necessary political and \r\neconomic consensus to effectively tackle these \r\nproblems. \r\n A mere three years ago, we heads of Government \r\ndescribed climate change as the defining challenge of \r\nour era. Three years on it remains so, especially for \r\nthose countries that are particularly vulnerable. And yet \r\nwe hear from some who have a responsibility to act \r\nthat they will only do so when others have taken \r\naction. While everybody waits for somebody else to \r\nact, the peoples of the world are made to suffer. \r\n If ever a challenge requires an urgent global \r\nsolution, this one does. Small island developing States \r\nsuch as Antigua and Barbuda face a unique set of \r\nvulnerabilities related to our small size: relative \r\nisolation, narrow resource base and high exposure to \r\nglobal environmental threats. To compound this, over \r\nthe last five years we have suffered disproportionately \r\nfrom the financial, food and energy crises. Our \r\neconomies have been battered and many of our \r\nproductive sectors wiped out. \r\n But the hardship that has ensued for our people \r\nfrom all this, will pale into insignificance, if the \r\ninternational community does not quickly address the \r\nlooming threat of climate change, which is already \r\nhaving a devastating impact all over the world. We, the \r\nsmall island developing States, have already experienced \r\nloss of agricultural land and infrastructure — so too have \r\nmany countries in Africa. \r\n Our fishing and tourism industries are being \r\nimpacted negatively. There has been considerable loss \r\nof our biodiversity, saltwater intrusion and devastation \r\nof terrestrial and wetland habitats and the destruction \r\nof human settlements. Even the once-distant threat of \r\nrising sea-level is now a reality, forcing some of our \r\npeople to emigrate and rebuild their lives elsewhere. \r\n The most notable action, so far, has been repeated \r\npromises of abundant financing to address the most \r\nurgent problems. Sadly, most of these remain just that: \r\npromises. There are too many commitments to \r\nundertake aggressive greenhouse gas emissions \r\nreductions with the caveat of “only if others do so as \r\nwell”. This approach has created a dangerous stalemate \r\nthat can only be to the further detriment of small island \r\ndeveloping States, such as my own. \r\n Not willing to allow this dangerous situation to \r\ncontinue forever, my own country of Antigua and \r\nBarbuda has pledged to reduce its already miniscule \r\ngreenhouse gas emissions by 25 per cent below 1990 \r\nlevels by 2020. \r\n A/65/PV.20\r\n \r\n9 10-55128 \r\n \r\n This is within the range specified by the \r\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which \r\nhas recommended that overall reductions should be \r\nwithin the range of 25 per cent to 40 per cent below \r\n1990 levels by 2020. We have also declared that we \r\nwill work towards making Antigua and Barbuda a \r\ngreen economy by 2020. \r\n However, much remains to be done, and we are \r\npainfully aware that we cannot do it alone. I therefore \r\ncall on all countries, both developed and developing, to \r\njoin us in this endeavour by announcing real, \r\nmeaningful emission reductions targets, so that we can \r\nmove this seemingly endless debate forward and reach \r\na comprehensive, binding agreement in the very near \r\nfuture. \r\n The year 2010 has not been without its share of \r\ncatastrophes. The year began with a devastating \r\nearthquake in Haiti — one of the worst disasters in \r\nhistory. The death toll has been put at some 220,000 \r\nout of a population of around 9 million. The earthquake \r\nhas been estimated to cost $8 to $14 billion, according \r\nto the Inter-American Development Bank. Against this \r\nbackdrop, many countries pledged assistance — up to \r\n$1.5 billion. Sadly, only 10 per cent of the amount \r\npledged has been received by Haiti. In the midst of \r\nthese unfulfilled commitments, the humanitarian needs \r\nof our sister island remain dire. \r\n Since charity begins at home, we, the member \r\nStates of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), of \r\nwhich Haiti is a member, have been contributing within \r\nour very limited capacity our fair share of assistance to \r\nHaiti, including direct budgetary support. I call on \r\nthose nations that pledged assistance to Haiti, to \r\nhonour their commitments. Those pledges are needed \r\nurgently, now that the rebuilding phase is getting under \r\nway in that devastated country. \r\n In Chile, a huge earthquake moved the city of \r\nConcepción at least 10 feet, or 3 metres, to the west. \r\nBetween 500 and 700 persons were killed. Total \r\nrecovery costs could exceed $15 billion. In the \r\nPeople’s Republic of China, a series of snowstorms and \r\nfreezing weather have affected the western region of \r\nthe country since December 2009. The storms have \r\naffected millions and resulted in 30 deaths. This year \r\nalone, severe flooding and a major earthquake killed \r\nhundreds of people and rendered thousands more \r\nhomeless. \r\n In Pakistan, devastating floods have resulted in \r\nover 1,600 deaths and more than 6 million people have \r\nbeen affected. That country has sought international \r\nassistance to cope with the catastrophe. Despite mass \r\nevacuations, there are fears that the death toll will rise \r\nas flooding reaches the southern parts of the country \r\nand the risk of an outbreak of waterborne diseases \r\nincreases in many areas. These disasters and their \r\naftermaths serve to reaffirm the need to ensure that \r\naddressing the humanitarian consequences of today’s \r\ndisasters and emergencies remains a United Nations \r\npriority. And those countries in a position to do so \r\nshould pledge their support to assist Pakistan and to \r\nhonour their pledges. \r\n Antigua and Barbuda continues to commiserate \r\nwith the Governments and people of these and other \r\nnations, who have been affected by natural and other \r\ndisasters. \r\n In my region of Latin America and the Caribbean, \r\nour Governments are taking bold steps to overcome \r\nsome of our inherent economic and social \r\nvulnerabilities by forging economic partnerships \r\ndesigned to help lift our people out of poverty. The \r\nSingle Market and Economy being developed at the \r\nlevel of the 15-member Caribbean Community is one \r\nsuch valiant initiative. \r\n At the subregional level of the Organization of \r\nEastern Caribbean States (OECS), economic \r\nintegration is proceeding at an even more rapid pace \r\nwith our commitment to creating an economic union by \r\nnext year. \r\n Both the CARICOM Single Market and \r\nEconomy, as well as the OECS Economic Union, are \r\nenormous undertakings by small island nations with \r\nvery limited resources. We therefore invite the support \r\nof our development partners to assist us with the \r\ntechnical and financial resources necessary to move \r\nthese economic initiatives forward. The leaders of our \r\nregion see the building of strong economic alliances as \r\nbeing vital to the creation of wealth and prosperity for \r\nour people. \r\n We are convinced that the capacity of our \r\nnational Governments to deliver critical social services \r\nfor our populations can be improved through greater \r\neconomic and technical cooperation at the regional \r\nlevel. It is for that reason, and with the interest of our \r\npeople in mind, that the countries of Latin America and \r\nthe Caribbean agreed at our meeting in Mexico earlier \r\nA/65/PV.20  \r\n \r\n10-55128 10 \r\n \r\nthis year to create the Community of Latin American \r\nand Caribbean States, which will unite members of the \r\nRio Group and the Caribbean Community. This \r\nCommunity of nations will coexist with the \r\nOrganization of American States, in which we \r\nparticipate along with our North American partners. \r\n The economic challenges facing all the people of \r\nour hemisphere are too many and their implications too \r\ngreat for us to contemplate the creation of any \r\neconomic community of Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean that excludes any one country of our region. \r\nIt is in that spirit that Cuba remains, and will always \r\nremain, a vibrant participant in any broad economic \r\narrangement for Latin America and the Caribbean. \r\n We may not all share similar political views and \r\npolitical systems. However, the right of all the people \r\nof Latin America and the Caribbean to an equal chance \r\nat survival, economic development and social \r\nadvancement is absolute and non-negotiable. For that \r\nreason, the Governments and the people of Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean continue to regard as \r\nunjust, counterproductive and reprehensible the \r\nmaintenance of the ongoing economic embargo against \r\nCuba. As a political strategy or economic manoeuvre, \r\nthat act of economic strangulation is unjustifiable. We \r\ncondemn the embargo in the strongest possible terms, \r\nas its continued enforcement by the United States \r\nseverely hampers the development of Cuba and its \r\npeople. \r\n Antigua and Barbuda therefore reiterates its call \r\nfor the United States to immediately end its economic \r\nembargo against the Cuban people. \r\n More than 20 years after the fall of the Berlin \r\nWall, democracy has emerged as the preferred form of \r\ngovernment all over the world. And people everywhere \r\nhave strongly opposed attempts to seize Governments — \r\nany Government — through undemocratic means. Such \r\nattempts, whenever and wherever they occur, must be \r\ncondemned in the strongest possible terms. We \r\ntherefore condemn the undemocratic moves such as the \r\nrecent coup d’état in Honduras and call for the \r\nunconditional return of former President Zelaya \r\nwithout harm to his physical person. That is a sine qua \r\nnon for the full normalization of relations between \r\nHonduras and most of the countries of the region. \r\n As I said in my statement during the review of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (see A/65/PV.8), a \r\nrenewed emphasis on trade is a critical pillar on which \r\ndeveloping countries are seeking to rescue their \r\nbattered economies and lift their people out of poverty. \r\nIn that respect, it is essential that all participants in the \r\nglobal trading system, including our partners in the \r\ndeveloped countries, adhere to their international \r\nobligations. If that is not done, the people of our small \r\ndeveloping countries, despite the encouragement of \r\ntheir leaders, will have no faith in the international \r\nsystem. They will have no reason to believe that the \r\nmultilateral system is just and that it works for them in \r\nthe same way it does for large, powerful, developed \r\nnations. \r\n The non-resolution of the ongoing gaming matter \r\nwithin the World Trade Organization (WTO), despite \r\nrepeated rulings in favour of Antigua and Barbuda by \r\nthe Dispute Settlement Body of WTO, is a case in \r\npoint. Let us not forget that, like the United Nations, \r\nWTO and other bodies such as the Bretton Woods \r\ninstitutions are essential elements of the multilateral \r\nsystem and vital pillars of the accepted architecture of \r\nglobal governance. In the spirit of preserving that vital \r\narchitecture of global governance, Antigua and \r\nBarbuda reiterates its call for our friend and partner, \r\nthe United States, to work with us to quickly resolve \r\nthe situation and reach a settlement that is fair and just \r\nto both parties. \r\n Trade is a critical engine of economic growth. If \r\nfor no other reason but that, we must complete the \r\nDoha Round of trade negotiations so as to ensure a \r\nbalanced outcome. Now more than ever, after some 10 \r\nyears in the making, Doha must lead to economic \r\nexpansion, development in the poorest countries, and \r\nan end to distorting subsidies and protectionist barriers. \r\n A number of the countries classified as middle- \r\nand upper-middle-income countries are in dire need of \r\nsubstantial amounts of debt relief in order to create \r\nfiscal space for spending targeted towards their \r\ndevelopment. Many of those countries now have debt-\r\nservicing obligations that are comparable in size to \r\ntheir gross national product or, in some cases, dwarf \r\nthe value of their total output. For them — my own \r\ncountry included — the need for urgent debt relief is a \r\ntop priority. \r\n For many of those countries the debt distress has \r\nbeen caused by global crises not of their making. The \r\nglobal financial and economic tsunami, the likes of \r\nwhich has not been seen since 1929, has impacted \r\nnegatively on every sphere of life for about 90 per cent \r\n A/65/PV.20\r\n \r\n11 10-55128 \r\n \r\nof humankind. In some instances, entire national \r\neconomies collapsed and commercial and private \r\nsectors have been decimated. For some, the downward \r\nspiral has no end in sight. Many countries are \r\nstruggling to maintain a minimal level of normalcy. For \r\nothers, attempting to stave off financial collapse, the \r\nsocial upheaval and chaos are unravelling the very \r\nfabric of modern societies and jeopardizing sanity, \r\nsovereignty, independence, and the dignity and pride of \r\ntheir people. \r\n The effects of the global financial and economic \r\ncrisis on the larger territories of the Caribbean \r\nCommunity are evident in their economic, fiscal and \r\nsocial statistical data. For the smaller territories of the \r\nEastern Caribbean, the situation is even more \r\ndevastating. Permit me to relate the facts pertaining to \r\nmy own country, Antigua and Barbuda. \r\n In addition to the direct and indirect impact that \r\nthe global economic contagion has had on our \r\neconomy, we have had to endure the collapse of two of \r\nthe leading insurance companies, which not only held \r\nnormal policies but also annuities and life savings for \r\nindividuals, as well as large cash investments for \r\nnational statutory corporations totalling approximately \r\n$150 million. At the same time, the leading private-\r\nsector employer and second largest employer in the \r\nnation after the Government has collapsed. \r\n All that was added to a financial sector that has \r\nbeen suffering from a sustained campaign by the \r\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and \r\nDevelopment (OECD) to reduce competition in \r\ntaxation, an area into which we had diversified our \r\neconomy, which was previously dependent almost \r\nentirely on tourism. That action by OECD resulted in \r\nthe loss of hundreds of the most lucrative jobs and an \r\nestimated loss of hundreds of millions in direct revenue \r\nto our economy. \r\n We note the recent removal of Antigua and \r\nBarbuda from the so-called Grey List. Our current \r\nlisting among the countries that have substantially \r\nimplemented internationally agreed taxation standards \r\nis a belated recognition of the steps taken by the \r\ncurrent Government of Antigua and Barbuda, over \r\nseveral years, to be in full compliance with all \r\ninternational standards in this respect. \r\n In the light of those realities of substantial \r\nrevenue decline and severe economic dislocation, \r\nAntigua and Barbuda recently engaged the Paris Club \r\nin discussions on our country’s $133 million \r\noutstanding debt to that group of creditors. Our \r\nengagement with the Paris Club was assisted by a \r\nstand-by arrangement previously approved by the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF). We have reached \r\nan agreement by which some 90 per cent of that debt \r\nwill be restructured. Our next step will be to enter \r\nbilateral negotiations with Paris Club member \r\ncreditors. \r\n With the economic challenges I have outlined, \r\nour efforts to meet human development needs are \r\nseverely strained and challenged in unprecedented \r\nways. That makes our attainment of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, though possible, extremely \r\ndifficult without a more realistic and flexible direct \r\ncommitment from our development partners. I \r\ntherefore call on the Group of Seven, the Group of 20, \r\nIMF and the World Bank, in their bilateral and \r\nmultilateral commitments to the Caribbean, to give a \r\nmore compassionate and favourable response to the \r\nNew Arrangement to Borrow, with specific focus on \r\nthe Group of 20 agreement of 2 April 2010. That \r\nagreement was to triple the fund’s lending capacity to \r\n$750 billion. This approach has already been taken \r\nwith some other regions and nations. The institutions \r\nare being called on, too, to accord to our region \r\nconsideration of broader and more comprehensive debt \r\ncancellation to spur economic revival and, in some \r\ncases, survival. \r\n The General Assembly meets once again as the \r\nchief deliberative, policymaking and representative \r\norgan of the United Nations. We meet in this unique \r\nforum, which bestows equality on each of its 192 \r\nMembers, in order to engage in multilateral discussions \r\nto advance the interests of all peoples of the world. But \r\nreaffirming the central role of the United Nations in \r\nglobal governance cannot be done without due regard \r\nto the myriad challenges facing all its Members. \r\n For us to achieve that reaffirmation — which most, \r\nif not all, of us believe is a very notable objective — I \r\nbelieve we must act now. I therefore call on the \r\nAssembly to develop at this session the modalities that \r\nwill enable our nations to be able to resolve conflicts \r\nand promote peace and stability, foster a more \r\nprosperous world through balanced growth and \r\nprosperity among developed and developing countries, \r\nencourage all Member States to pursue a cleaner, \r\ngreener, more sustainable world for our children, and \r\ncreate a safer world, free of nuclear weapons. \r\nA/65/PV.20  \r\n \r\n10-55128 12 \r\n \r\n The 65-year history of this noble institution \r\nestablishes beyond a doubt that we can. And the future \r\nof our generation and generations of our peoples to \r\ncome behoves us to embark on that mission with \r\nurgency and immediacy. \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I thank the Prime Minister of \r\nAntigua and Barbuda for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\n Mr. Winston Baldwin Spencer, Prime Minister of \r\nAntigua and Barbuda, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by His Excellency Mr. Jaume \r\nBartumeu Cassany, Head of Government  \r\nof the Principality of Andorra \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the Head of Government \r\nof the Principality of Andorra. \r\n Mr. Jaume Bartumeu Cassany, Head of \r\nGovernment of the Principality of Andorra, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I have great \r\npleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Jaume \r\nBartumeu Cassany, Head of Government of the \r\nPrincipality of Andorra, and inviting him to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n Mr. Bartumeu Cassany (Andorra) (spoke in \r\nCatalan; Spanish and French texts provided by the \r\ndelegation): It is certainly a great opportunity for the \r\nPrincipality of Andorra and the Government I represent \r\nto address the Assembly. The United Nations is the \r\nforum that, true to its origins, today represents the \r\ngreatest source of hope for many people, countries and \r\nGovernments. \r\n In Andorra, we are aware of what being a small \r\nMember country of the United Nations involves — that \r\nis, a determination to engage in cooperation, hard work \r\nand honest efforts. The world is the sum of our \r\npossibilities and our efforts, and of the aspirations of \r\neach of us. \r\n The world in the twenty-first century is neither \r\nbetter nor worse; it has the same defects, contrasts and \r\nvirtues as in earlier centuries, but the rules of play are \r\nmore dynamic. Thanks to new technology and social \r\nnetworks, citizens now have greater weight than in \r\nearlier times in alerting and motivating the political \r\nand economic leaders and seeing that they remain \r\nactive. \r\n Despite all that, today we live in a world of \r\npatent contrasts, where hunger continues to be one of \r\nour worst evils. More than a billion people suffer from \r\nmalnutrition and poverty. The consequences of the \r\nfood, environmental and economic crises have \r\ncompounded the situation of the most vulnerable \r\npopulations. \r\n During the World Summit on Food Security in \r\nRome last November, we decided to adopt measures to \r\nhalve by 2015 the number of people suffering from \r\nmalnutrition and hunger, combining all possible efforts \r\nto achieve the first of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. In the Group of 20 (G20) meeting in Toronto, \r\nthe Secretary-General defended the position of the \r\nmost vulnerable populations and asked the 20 leading \r\nworld Powers to develop new policies for combating \r\npoverty. \r\n The struggle to combat climate change, however, \r\nis still unresolved. The natural disasters that the people \r\nof Haiti and Pakistan have had to deal with show how \r\ndevastating the effects of climate change can be. It is a \r\nphenomenon that jeopardizes the poorest populations, \r\naffects access to water, compounds malnutrition and \r\nleads to violence. The economic impact on developing \r\nStates is terrible. \r\n While the threats are real, the solutions are real \r\ntoo. The possibility of dealing with them exists. During \r\nthe Copenhagen Conference, the States parties to the \r\nClimate Change Convention initiated negotiations for \r\nan agreement. We hope that at the Conference on \r\nClimate Change to be held in Cancún in December, an \r\neffective and scientifically ambitious text will be \r\nadopted that will make it possible to reduce greenhouse \r\ngas emissions. \r\n Andorra is engaging in activities aimed at \r\ncombating climate change, particularly water treatment \r\nand reduction of substances that deplete the ozone \r\nlayer. In the next few months our Government also \r\nplans to approve ratification of the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change. \r\n It is clear is that the current crisis is forcing us to \r\nrethink the structures of the global financial system to \r\nmake it more equitable, more ethical and at the same \r\ntime more sound, in order to ensure that world leaders’ \r\n A/65/PV.20\r\n \r\n13 10-55128 \r\n \r\naspirations can — little by little, but more each time — \r\nconverge and agree on what the most vulnerable \r\npeoples, countries and democracies truly need. \r\n Andorra has succeeded in moving off the Grey \r\nList of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \r\nDevelopment (OECD), thanks to the signing, between \r\nSeptember 2009 and February 2010, of 17 bilateral \r\nagreements on the exchange of tax information. Our \r\nfirm commitment to the recommendations of OECD \r\nand the international community as a whole, as \r\nexpressed at the G20 meetings, has laid the foundations \r\nfor our business structure and boosted confidence in \r\nAndorra’s financial sector. \r\n We wish to move forward on the road to \r\ntransparency and international cooperation in \r\ncombating tax fraud. We therefore believe that a \r\npermanent European mechanism for financial stability \r\nshould be established, as well as very strict regulation \r\nof the products known as derivatives. It would also be \r\ndesirable to create a European agency to rate the \r\nsolvency of the financial activities and of its \r\nadministrations. \r\n We also wish to continue to work, from a \r\nperspective of respect, in an Organization such as the \r\nUnited Nations, reformed and consolidated, able to \r\nhelp the international community to move forward at \r\nthis stage of its history, avoiding any exacerbation of \r\nthe inequalities that fuel violence and hatred. \r\n We therefore need to promote an international \r\ndefinition of minimum social guarantees for all \r\nmankind. Andorra firmly believes that the United \r\nNations can ensure the necessary equilibrium, respect \r\nfor all States — regardless of their economic, political \r\nor military power — and the application of \r\ninternational law. The United Nations Charter urges \r\nMember States to apply tolerance and to combine their \r\nefforts to maintain international peace and security — \r\nin short, to ensure that the aspirations and needs of all \r\ncoincide. \r\n In the last 65 years, the United Nations has taken \r\nmany actions to promote disarmament, development \r\nand the rule of law and democratic practices, and it \r\ncontinues to do so. The Organization and its Member \r\nStates have been supported by non-governmental \r\norganizations and grass-roots movements, which have \r\nworked to ensure that the tragic experiences of the \r\ntwentieth century are not repeated. \r\n One of the features of my country is that we have \r\nno army. For more than 700 years Andorra has lived in \r\npeace, without a single armed conflict. Today, \r\ndetermined to show our international commitment to \r\ndisarmament, Andorra intends very soon to ratify the \r\nConvention on Cluster Munitions. \r\n Let us remember that the founding principles of \r\nour Organization are equality, the defence of human \r\nrights and the prohibition of any form of \r\ndiscrimination. \r\n The Human Rights Council is the principal forum \r\nfor the discussion of the defence of human rights. \r\nThanks to the Universal Periodic Review, all Member \r\nStates are subject to a unique exercise in dialogue, \r\nwhich encourages us to respect human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms. This process is proving to be \r\neffective, but there are still a number of challenges to \r\novercome. Andorra will undergo this review for the \r\nfirst time in the coming month of November. \r\n To mark the twentieth anniversary of the \r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child, Andorran civil \r\nsociety and, in particular, the Andorra National \r\nCommittee for UNICEF have carried out many \r\nactivities jointly with Andorran institutions to raise \r\nawareness of that text and educate the population on \r\nthe importance of defending the rights of the child. \r\n Combating violence against women is one of the \r\npriorities of the Government that I represent. On  \r\n14 April this year, we created the Secretariat for \r\nEquality and Welfare, with the objective of \r\ncoordinating the range of actions aimed at promoting \r\nthe status of women and establishing new policies in \r\nthe area of gender. This year, we are celebrating the \r\nfifteenth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration \r\nand Platform for Action at the Fourth Conference on \r\nWomen, held in Beijing. \r\n During the March 2010 session of the \r\nCommission on the Status of Women, we recognized \r\nthat women have an essential role to play in promoting \r\nbroad and sustainable socio-economic development. \r\nProgress has been made on improving the status of \r\nwomen, but, unfortunately, it is not enough. We must \r\ncontinue promoting the rights of women and fighting \r\ndomestic violence. \r\n According to a report by the United Nations \r\nOffice on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the most \r\nprofitable illegal activity in Europe is human \r\nA/65/PV.20  \r\n \r\n10-55128 14 \r\n \r\ntrafficking. Eighty-four per cent of the victims of \r\nhuman trafficking in Europe have been enslaved for the \r\npurposes of sexual exploitation. It is important to focus \r\non that issue from the perspective of protecting \r\nvictims, which will certainly be integrated into the \r\ndevelopment of the United Nations Plan of Action to \r\nCombat Trafficking in Persons, adopted on 30 July \r\n2010 (resolution 64/293). \r\n Over the coming months, Andorra will ratify the \r\nCouncil of Europe Convention on Action against \r\nTrafficking in Human Beings, which is a compelling \r\ndemonstration of our State’s international commitment \r\nto this fight and of our will to support international \r\ninstruments aimed at protecting human rights and \r\npreserving the fundamental values of our democratic \r\nsocieties. \r\n The Government that I represent commends the \r\nrecent decision by the United Nations to create the \r\nUnited Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the \r\nEmpowerment of Women (UN Women). I wish this \r\nnew body the greatest success; it can count on the full \r\nsupport of my country, and we will work in solidarity \r\nwith Michelle Bachelet. \r\n At present, we are all experiencing a profound \r\nglobal economic crisis, which threatens the European \r\nmodel of society. This crisis is also cultural and affects \r\nvalues such as solidarity. \r\n As we celebrate 2010 as the International Year for \r\nthe Rapprochement of Cultures, we have the \r\nopportunity to remember the relevance of cultural \r\ndiversity. Learning about others, tolerance and respect \r\nfor human rights and human dignity are the ingredients \r\nneeded to build a harmonious and peaceful society. \r\n Perhaps as a result of the small size of Andorra, \r\nor of its geographical surroundings — abrupt and \r\nextremely beautiful — in the Pyrenees, we have been \r\nable to develop natural and strong human relationships, \r\nthrough which our attachment, commitment or \r\ndisagreement with all people is shown sincerely, \r\nwithout filters and without doublespeak. Therefore, \r\nwhen large-scale natural disasters, humanitarian crises \r\nor international emergencies occur, Andorra responds, \r\nand it does so sincerely, with voluntary contributions \r\ncommensurate with international norms and additional \r\ncontributions when called for by the situation. Andorra, \r\nin accordance with its national budget, is always \r\npresent and always does its part. Based on this \r\nsolidarity, we support and promote international \r\ndevelopment cooperation, and our country has a \r\nnumber of non-governmental organizations that devote \r\nvigorous efforts to working in this area. \r\n The challenges we are forced to face are \r\nnumerous. We have the good fortune of being able to \r\nwork together in order to overcome them. It is indeed a \r\ngreat responsibility, but it is also a great opportunity. It \r\nis an opportunity to come up with solutions that meet \r\nthe needs of those worst off. \r\n In conclusion, I should like to wish you, Sir, the \r\nbest of luck and the greatest of success over the \r\ncoming year. I am convinced that you will make great \r\nprogress towards improving the individual and \r\ncollective impact of our Organization. \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the Head of \r\nGovernment of the Principality of Andorra for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Jaume Bartumeu Cassany, Head of \r\nGovernment of the Principality of Andorra, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Edward Natapei, Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Vanuatu \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Vanuatu. \r\n Mr. Edward Natapei, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Vanuatu, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I have great \r\npleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Edward \r\nNatapei, Prime Minister of the Republic of Vanuatu, \r\nand inviting him to address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Natapei (Vanuatu): Vanuatu is very pleased \r\nthat we are meeting under your presidency, Sir, and, on \r\nbehalf of my Government and of the Pacific Islands \r\nForum, I extend my warm congratulations to you, and \r\nwe wish to assure you of our full confidence and \r\ncooperation. \r\n I should also like to take a moment to pay tribute \r\nto your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Ali \r\nAbdussalam Treki, for his exceptional service and \r\nleadership during the sixty-fourth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and for the considerable and \r\nimportant achievements of that session. \r\n A/65/PV.20\r\n \r\n15 10-55128 \r\n \r\n In the same spirit, I take this opportunity also to \r\ncommend the Secretary-General for his vision, \r\nleadership and tireless efforts in working towards \r\nachievements in the common interest of all humanity. \r\n Many innocent lives continue to be wasted, with \r\ngood people killed or wounded and multitudes \r\ndisplaced by heinous acts designed to undermine and \r\ndestabilize the collective efforts of the international \r\ncommunity to achieve peace and security for our \r\nsocieties. These many unprecedented events continue \r\nto test the very foundation of our Organization. \r\n As we prepare to enter the second decade of this \r\ntwenty-first century, it is vital now more than ever that \r\nour membership affirms its confidence and faith in the \r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations. It is \r\nimportant that we continue to assert our support for \r\nfundamental human rights and the peaceful coexistence \r\nof our nations. The range and urgency of the challenges \r\nthat now confront the international community in our \r\nglobalized and interdependent world demand, at the \r\nvery least, our steadfast support for and commitment to \r\npeace and security for our communities and peoples, \r\nand for future generations. \r\n If we are to effectively guarantee human rights \r\nand achieve peace and security and social and \r\neconomic justice for all, we need to be united in this \r\nendeavour, and our cooperation and multilateral joint \r\nefforts need to be durable and effective. My \r\nGovernment and people of Vanuatu are steadfast in our \r\nbelief that the United Nations remains uniquely suited \r\nto the pursuit and coordination of global initiatives to \r\nattain these objectives. \r\n Vanuatu hosted the forty-first annual Pacific \r\nIslands Forum in our capital, Port Vila, last month. As \r\ncurrent Chair, I wish to inform the Assembly that the \r\nPacific Islands leaders again noted that transnational \r\ncrime remains a threat to national and regional \r\nstability, in particular the proliferation of small arms \r\nand light weapons and illicit drugs. Consequently, the \r\nPacific Islands Forum has strengthened cooperation in \r\ncounter-terrorism measures and emphasized national \r\nefforts and regional cooperation in combating \r\ntransnational organized crime and in strengthening \r\nborder control capacities. The Pacific Islands Forum \r\nremains committed to collective arrangements and \r\nmechanisms to assist regional Governments recovering \r\nfrom national conflicts and crises. The value of those \r\nefforts is evident in the positive results of the Regional \r\nAssistance Mission to the Solomon Islands, created \r\nunder the Biketawa Declaration with the assistance of \r\ncontributing member States, which would not have \r\nbeen successful without the strong leadership and \r\ncommitment of the Solomon Islands Government. \r\n While many of our member countries have not \r\nratified the United Nations Convention against \r\nCorruption (UNCAC), Forum leaders recognize the \r\nimportant role that the Convention offers in providing \r\nan internationally agreed framework for effective anti-\r\ncorruption activities around the world. I am pleased to \r\nsay that our regional organizations are working with \r\nthe various United Nations agencies to advance work \r\nto promote the Convention. \r\n While known as a region characterized by \r\noceanic isolation, smallness and general vulnerability, \r\nthe Pacific region is one of only a few in the world to \r\nhave experienced nuclear weapons testing. Therefore, \r\nadvancing the cause of nuclear non-proliferation and \r\nthe South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty — also \r\nknown as the Treaty of Rarotonga — remains critical \r\nand relevant to our signatory member States. The South \r\nPacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty reflects our region’s \r\ndeep commitment not only to international peace and \r\nsecurity but also to collective international action to \r\nensure peace and security. In endorsing the successful \r\noutcome of the 2010 Non-Proliferation Treaty Review \r\nConference, Forum leaders also welcomed the \r\nannouncement by the United States of America of its \r\nintention to ratify all protocols of the Treaty of \r\nRarotonga. \r\n Notwithstanding their size, national obligations \r\nand circumstances, our respective Forum members \r\nvalue and are proud of their contributions to United \r\nNations peacekeeping efforts. My own country is proud \r\nto contribute to United Nations peacekeeping missions \r\nin East Timor, Haiti, the Sudan, Bosnia, the Peace \r\nMonitoring Group and the Bougainville Transition \r\nTeam in Bougainville, and to the Regional Assistance \r\nMission to the Solomon Islands. \r\n Terrorism is an offence to humanity and contrary \r\nto the core values of the United Nations. We must be \r\nresolute in our national and collective efforts to combat \r\nterrorism in all its forms. For my own country, I \r\nreaffirm our strong support for the relevant Security \r\nCouncil resolutions against terrorism. Those \r\nresolutions provide a clear signal of our determination \r\nA/65/PV.20  \r\n \r\n10-55128 16 \r\n \r\nto suppress terrorist activities, including training, \r\ninternational movement and financing. \r\n All of us present here today have described the \r\nvarious stages of our progress to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). For our \r\nisland countries, our increasing vulnerability to threats \r\nand challenges, underscored by the impacts of the \r\nglobal economic, financial, fuel and food crises, is \r\nexacerbated by the current and impending impacts of \r\nclimate change, as well as our inherent limited capacity \r\nto respond. This is not to say, however, that we have \r\nnot made progress in achieving any of those goals. \r\nWith respect to Goal 2, the primary education systems \r\nof the Pacific region are characterized by high \r\nenrolment, with six of our countries currently \r\ndisplaying net enrolment ratios of over 90 per cent. \r\nMost, if not all, of our Pacific island countries are \r\nexpected to meet the goal of gender equality in \r\neducation by 2015. We have been able to achieve those \r\ngoals because we have localized the global indicators \r\nby adjusting them to suit our local circumstances and \r\npriorities. \r\n While we remain concerned about the pace of our \r\nprogress towards the Millennium Development Goals, \r\nwe are committed to accelerating progress towards \r\nachieving them by 2015. The Port Vila Declaration on \r\nAccelerating Progress on the Achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, which was adopted by \r\nPacific Forum leaders at their meeting in Vanuatu last \r\nmonth, recognizes that the MDGs are extremely \r\nimportant, as is also the incremental path towards \r\nachieving those Goals — a path that should recognize \r\nand accommodate the special circumstances and \r\nchallenges we face in the Pacific. The Port Vila \r\nDeclaration also highlights the importance of \r\nmainstreaming the programme of support for the \r\nsustainable development of small island developing \r\nStates — which is captured in the Barbados \r\nProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development \r\nof Small Island Developing States and the Mauritius \r\nStrategy for the Further Implementation of the \r\nBarbados Programme of Action — as an accelerator for \r\nachieving the MDGs in the Pacific and addressing the \r\nspecific vulnerabilities that we face. To ensure the \r\nsuccess of the Port Vila Declaration, we call for the \r\nsupport, collaborative action and commitment of the \r\ninternational community and our development partners — \r\nparticularly an improved understanding of and ability \r\nto address our vulnerabilities and for improved \r\ncoordination of efforts towards achieving the MDGs. \r\n Advancing the Pacific islands’ work with respect \r\nto the Millennium Development Goals is closely and \r\ninextricably linked to the Mauritius Strategy. The \r\ndevelopment and endorsement of the Pacific Plan by \r\nthe Forum leaders in 2005 underscored the critical \r\nneed for creating stronger and deeper linkages between \r\nour countries and for identifying sectors where the \r\nregion could gain the most by sharing resources in the \r\narea of governance and by aligning policies. While we \r\nbelieve that we have made some excellent progress in \r\neffectively implementing the Mauritius Strategy at the \r\nnational and regional levels, we also acknowledge our \r\nshortcomings, some of which are beyond our control. \r\nThe growing vulnerabilities of our Pacific island \r\ncountries are exacerbated by the impacts of the global \r\neconomic crisis, climate change and natural disasters, \r\nand those factors affect our abilities to respond. \r\n Climate change remains the greatest threat to the \r\nlivelihoods, security and well-being of the peoples of \r\nthe Pacific. Continuing and concerted efforts by Forum \r\nmembers are being made at the national, regional and \r\ninternational levels to address the impacts of climate \r\nchange on Pacific communities and peoples. The \r\ndegree of urgency for real commitments to emissions \r\nreduction must be commensurate with the science and \r\nwith the associated impacts of climate change on the \r\nmost vulnerable communities. This issue must not be \r\nviewed with an eye to short-term impacts on traditional \r\nindustrial growth or political tenure, but rather with a \r\nlonger-term consideration of the sustainability of \r\neconomies, societies and peoples the world over. A \r\nmeaningful, legally binding agreement on emissions \r\nreduction must be reached urgently and without delay. \r\nRecognizing the importance of effective coordination \r\nand implementation of climate change adaptation and \r\nmitigation efforts at all levels — and particularly at the \r\nnational level — Forum leaders have endorsed a set of \r\nprinciples that will guide Forum island countries and \r\ndevelopment partners in this regard, bearing in mind \r\nexisting and ongoing efforts in the region. Those \r\nprinciples are consistent with the Cairns Compact and \r\nthe Pacific Islands Framework for Action on Climate \r\nChange, and they reflect recognition by Forum leaders \r\nof the important role that regional and international \r\narrangements play in supporting national adaptation \r\nand mitigation through the enhancement of capacity \r\nand access to resources. \r\n A/65/PV.20\r\n \r\n17 10-55128 \r\n \r\n I am also pleased to say that, ahead of the Cancún \r\nclimate change meetings this November and December, \r\nthe Government of Kiribati will be hosting the Tarawa \r\nClimate Change Conference in November. We \r\nanticipate bringing together representatives of \r\ncountries vulnerable to the impact of climate change, \r\nas well as representatives of major economies. \r\n Allow me at this juncture to make a few remarks \r\npertinent to Vanuatu’s position on a number of issues. \r\nWe are meeting here at this Assembly session to once \r\nagain renew our commitment to the United Nations and \r\nto the principles enshrined in its Charter. However, the \r\nneed to reform the United Nations to ensure that it \r\neffectively responds to the needs of its Members \r\nremains imperative. \r\n In that regard, I wish to commend the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for advancing the work on the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council. We note the work done by the Chair \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations on the question \r\nof equitable representation and increase in the \r\nmembership of the Security Council and other matters \r\nrelated to the Council. So we join all like-minded \r\nStates in encouraging the United Nations to pursue \r\nequitable reforms in its institutions in order to \r\nminimize the democratic deficit in the multilateral \r\narena. \r\n My Government also joins all other heads of \r\nGovernments that are Members of the United Nations \r\nfamily in congratulating the Secretary-General on \r\nbringing to a reality the efforts over four years to \r\ncreate the office of UN Women, a new entity formally \r\nestablished by the General Assembly within the United \r\nNations created in July of this year. That decision gives \r\nmore prominence to women and their place in our \r\nsociety.  \r\n Vanuatu celebrated 30 years of political freedom \r\nlast July. This year marks the end of the Second \r\nInternational Decade of Decolonization. My \r\nGovernment wishes to question the progress on some \r\nimportant processes of self-determination. It is \r\ndisturbing to think that we may legitimize practices \r\nthat contravene the very principles on which this \r\nOrganization has been founded. Are we to assume that \r\ndecolonization issues may be ignored in the years to \r\ncome so as not to unsettle the status quo? \r\n Issues relating to decolonization and severe \r\nhuman rights violations must be effectively and \r\nimpartially addressed. We call upon the United Nations \r\nto strengthen its efforts in working towards full \r\ndecolonization of Territories that are still under the \r\ncontrol of administrating Powers. Where there are \r\nserious reports of human rights violations, there must \r\nbe a stronger United Nations role in investigating all \r\nallegations of human atrocity. We are reminded that the \r\nnoble task of our multilateral Organization is to \r\nreaffirm our commitment to and respect for \r\nfundamental human rights and the dignity of the human \r\nperson. \r\n We are encouraged to see emerging nations, such \r\nas Kosovo, rising from the turmoil of restraint to take \r\nup their position in the midst of the independent \r\nnations of the world. It is in the spirit of democratic \r\nfreedom that justice must prevail for those peoples \r\nwhose right to political freedom continues to be \r\nsuppressed by colonial and illegitimate administrating \r\nPowers. That includes for those countries whose \r\npolitical freedom to claim their rights to territorial \r\nsovereignty under the United Nations Convention on \r\nthe Law of the Sea and those whose political freedom \r\nto rightfully claim an extended continental shelf under \r\nthe Convention are suppressed by colonial \r\nadministrative rule. \r\n As we applaud calls for a peaceful resolution of \r\nthe conflict between Israel and Palestine, my country \r\nalso calls for the lifting of the embargo on Cuba, which \r\nwill enable the good people of Cuba to improve their \r\nlives. \r\n My country, together with other least developed \r\ncountries in the Pacific, has consistently argued in this \r\nforum that the mechanisms and criteria for assessing \r\ngraduation eligibility must not be isolated from the \r\npermanent and inherent vulnerabilities of our countries. \r\nIt is unrealistic for United Nations agencies to look at \r\nthe progress and make projections without taking into \r\nconsideration the issues of permanent vulnerabilities \r\nand capacity to sustain growth in our countries. \r\nIndicators for most Millennium Development Goals \r\nclearly demonstrate little progress in human \r\ndevelopment. Climate change, volcanic eruptions and \r\nother disasters will continue to be significant factors \r\ninhibiting human development in our islands. Such \r\nfactors are critical, and we therefore reiterate our \r\nposition that they must be carefully weighed in the \r\nvulnerability graduation criteria. \r\n In the case of our very close neighbour, Fiji, my \r\nGovernment believes that all players are interested in \r\nA/65/PV.20  \r\n \r\n10-55128 18 \r\n \r\nseeing positive political progress there, which must \r\ncontinue to genuinely engage the good people of Fiji. \r\nWe have learned that multilateralism offers some \r\nconstructive innovations in diplomatic practice, but it \r\nmay also complicate conflict resolution by increasing \r\ntension between actors. \r\n Finally, in the spirit of reconciliation through the \r\nPacific way, I call upon all international and regional \r\ndiplomatic actors to assist in ways that will not \r\npolarize the region. Instead, our diplomatic approaches \r\nshould help to give genuine dialogue and engagement a \r\nmore credible opportunity. There should be genuine \r\nand renewed commitment to fostering relations in the \r\nPacific region, commitment that promotes greater \r\nfreedom, regional cooperation, friendship and \r\nintegration, as envisaged in the Pacific Plan document. \r\n In conclusion, I take this opportunity to express \r\nmy gratitude to all our development partners for the \r\nsupport that they are providing in building our \r\neconomies. I believe more can be done to assist the \r\nPacific island countries in addressing the growing \r\nchallenges confronting the region. \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Vanuatu for the statement \r\nhe has just made. \r\n Mr. Edward Natapei, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Vanuatu, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Mr. Tillman Thomas, Prime \r\nMinister and Minister of National Security, \r\nInformation and Legal Affairs of Grenada \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the Prime Minister and \r\nMinister of National Security, Information and Legal \r\nAffairs of Grenada. \r\n Mr. Tillman Thomas, Prime Minister and Minister \r\nof National Security, Information and Legal \r\nAffairs of Grenada, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I have great \r\npleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Tillman \r\nThomas, Prime Minister and Minister of National \r\nSecurity, Information and Legal Affairs of Grenada, \r\nand inviting him to address the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Thomas (Grenada): I am honoured to \r\naddress this body. I do so at a time when the world \r\ncontinues to face multiple challenges, foremost of \r\nwhich for small island developing States such as \r\nGrenada is the fragile economic, financial and \r\necological situation. But despite those difficult \r\ncircumstances, the people of Grenada demonstrate \r\ntremendous resilience. Resourcefulness, patience and \r\nabiding faith in God keep us going forward. We will \r\ntherefore not relent. Our resolve is firm. Dedication, \r\ncreativity, renewed commitment to our fellow beings, \r\nunwavering commitment to multilateralism and, most \r\nof all, solidarity will help us survive these trying times. \r\n Indeed, as it did in the past, this body can again \r\nprove to be the perfect partner in our quest to solve our \r\nproblems, if only we commit ourselves to cooperate \r\nmore with each other. Carefully targeted technical and \r\nother forms of assistance to countries most in need \r\nwould make a vast difference in the lives of millions. \r\n It is in that spirit that I join the many speakers \r\nwho preceded me in congratulating you, Mr. President, \r\non your election to guide the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-fifth session. You have Grenada’s full support. \r\n We commend the outgoing President, Mr. Ali \r\nAbdussalam Treki, for his dedication and able handling \r\nof the Assembly’s work in the year just ended and wish \r\nhim the very best for the future. In addition, Grenada \r\nrecognizes the tireless stewardship and leadership of \r\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, as the United \r\nNations tackles the very complex array of global \r\nissues. \r\n In her July address to the United Nations, Her \r\nMajesty Queen Elizabeth II, head of the \r\nCommonwealth of Nations, concluded her remarks \r\nwith customary clarity and insightfulness, affirming \r\nthat the United Nations is a real force for common \r\ngood (see A/64/PV.105). Grenada supports that \r\nstatement. \r\n At the very inception of the Organization, 65 \r\nyears ago, its objectives were to avoid future wars and \r\nmaintain the peace, and to partner with developing \r\ncountries in their social and economic development. \r\nGrenada is satisfied that after more than six decades of \r\nexistence, those goals remain worthy of continuing \r\npursuit. \r\n In times of conflict, strife, natural disasters and \r\nother humanitarian matters, the United Nations has \r\n A/65/PV.20\r\n \r\n19 10-55128 \r\n \r\nbeen the first place to turn to. Its relevance, role and \r\ninvolvement in global affairs remain unquestionable. \r\nAny weakening of its authority and effectiveness \r\ncannot be in our best interests. The United Nations \r\nmust remain the premier organization for global \r\ndiplomacy and negotiations. We must do nothing to \r\nhinder the United Nations continuing as a real force for \r\ngood in the world. Indeed, the United Nations must \r\nlead, not follow, in global governance. \r\n Times have changed. The world is facing new \r\nrealities, and the United Nations must adjust \r\naccordingly. For that reason, the recent advances made \r\nin United Nations system-wide coherence deserve \r\nspecial commendation. The formation of the new body, \r\nUN Women, aimed principally at promoting the rights \r\nof women and girls and equality between the sexes, is \r\nan early success of United Nations reform and is \r\nembraced by Grenada. Our desire to actively \r\nparticipate in the fulfilment of the noble objectives of \r\nUN Women has led us to seek membership on its \r\nExecutive Board. I am hopeful that Grenada’s \r\ncandidacy will receive strong support and be elected. \r\n Similarly, the United Nations must recognize the \r\ninherent imperatives of democracy. Continued failure \r\nto meaningfully reform the Security Council will deny \r\nthat body the political legitimacy it needs to maintain \r\nand indeed enhance its leadership role. Grenada joins \r\nwith the Caribbean Community and calls for a Security \r\nCouncil seat for small island States as soon as possible. \r\n Climate change is rightly described as one of the \r\nmost urgent issues facing humanity and must remain at \r\nthe top of the global diplomatic and negotiating \r\nagenda. Left unchecked, its potential consequences \r\ncould be catastrophic, particularly for small island \r\ndeveloping States. Recent studies confirm that over the \r\npast five decades the planet has heated up and that 93 \r\nper cent of this warming has occurred in the oceans. \r\nThe consequential rise in sea level is already affecting \r\nlow-lying countries in the Caribbean and beyond and is \r\nundermining small economies, ruining their societies \r\nand threatening their very existence. \r\n In that connection, we continue to call for \r\nambitious mitigation targets and to welcome climate \r\nfinancing. Fast-start funding in the amount of  \r\n$30 billion, announced in 2009 and intended to assist \r\ndeveloping countries, especially the most climate-\r\nvulnerable nations, has reached only a small percentage \r\nof developing countries, and just a fraction of promised \r\nfunds has been released. Clearly, that situation has to \r\nbe corrected, for financial assistance must be \r\ncommensurate with the scale of the threat faced and \r\nshould be sustained, especially for small island \r\ndeveloping States. \r\n Grenada welcomes the empanelling of the \r\nSecretary-General’s High-level Advisory Group on \r\nClimate Change Financing and the High-level Panel on \r\nGlobal Sustainability. We anticipate that in their \r\nreports the matter of appropriate and sustainable levels \r\nof climate-change financing will be properly addressed \r\nand promoted. \r\n What an important review year 2010 is. We \r\napplaud the High-level Plenary Meeting on \r\nbiodiversity (see A/65/PV.7 and PV.10) and support the \r\ncall to halt species loss. We welcome the convening of \r\nthe High-level Review Meeting on the implementation \r\nof the Mauritius Strategy for the Further \r\nImplementation of the Barbados Programme of Action \r\nfor the Sustainable Development of Small Island \r\nDeveloping States (MSI+5) (see A/65/PV.13 and \r\nPV.18). In its capacity as Chair of the Alliance of Small \r\nIsland States, Grenada was privileged to play a \r\ncoordinating role in that important review process, and \r\nwe thank all, including our development partners and \r\nthe United Nations, for undertaking the process with \r\nus. Now that this body has endorsed the political \r\ndeclaration, we call for quick and full implementation \r\nof the MSI+5 decisions. \r\n Similarly, Grenada welcomes the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and remains firm in its \r\ndetermination to achieve them. Our report submitted in \r\nthe just-concluded review process indicated that while \r\nGrenada has made progress, there is much more to be \r\ndone to achieve the established Goals within the five \r\nyears that remain. \r\n It is our view that if our countries are to eliminate \r\npoverty and realize their true potential, there must be a \r\ncomprehensive review of the criteria for determining \r\nmiddle-income status. Many countries placed in that \r\ncategory, including Grenada, are highly indebted and \r\ndeserve special attention in order to achieve \r\nsustainable development. Small island developing \r\nStates cannot attain their full potential if they are \r\nprematurely set adrift in the development ocean with a \r\nfalse diagnosis of full preparedness. No matter what its \r\ngrowth pattern or level, a country with 37 per cent \r\npoverty and debt-to-GDP ratio of over 100 per cent — \r\nA/65/PV.20  \r\n \r\n10-55128 20 \r\n \r\nas is the case with Grenada — cannot be ready to sail \r\nthe high seas of development financing autonomy. That \r\nday will come, but it is not yet here. \r\n Grenada registers its strong support for the call for a \r\nUnited Nations high-level meeting on non-communicable \r\ndiseases — NCDs. Currently, NCDs constitute the main \r\ncause of morbidity and mortality in our region. Life \r\nexpectancy depends to a great extent on the avoidance \r\nof such illnesses, and thus preventative policies must \r\nbe aimed at promoting changes in lifestyles. Therefore, \r\nwe view with a great degree of satisfaction the progress \r\nmade by our Caribbean representatives here at the \r\nUnited Nations in articulating the need for such a \r\nmeeting in 2011. I pledge Grenada’s participation at \r\nthe highest level. \r\n Grenada has confidence in the United Nations \r\nand in the work it can do. We unreservedly support the \r\npursuit of international peace and security, the rule of \r\nlaw, the promotion of democracy and human rights, the \r\nfight against terrorism, the fight against the illicit drug \r\ntrade and the many other issues that threaten our world. \r\n We also believe in justice. The economic progress \r\nand realization of the full potential of a fellow \r\nCaribbean nation continues to be stifled by a now \r\ninfamous economic embargo of over 45 years. As a \r\nresult, its people are humiliated by shortages and \r\ndeprived of basic necessities essential to decent human \r\nexistence. The vast majority of countries in the world \r\nhave consistently and overwhelmingly voted in this \r\nvery forum for its removal, but the irony persists. \r\n Grenada again urges the United States of America \r\nto do what is right and completely lift the harsh \r\neconomic measures against the people of Cuba, if only \r\non humanitarian grounds. In the spirit of fair trade and \r\ngood-neighbourliness, Grenada also calls on the United \r\nStates to honour the recent decision in favour of \r\nAntigua and Barbuda in the World Trade Organization, \r\nas that too would show respect for the decisions of \r\ninternational tribunals. \r\n Grenada reminds the world of the Caribbean \r\nCommunity’s instant and pivotal response and \r\ncontinuing presence in Haiti, following the devastating \r\nearthquake earlier this year. The successful rebuilding \r\nof Haiti will benefit all, and Grenada calls for a swift \r\ndelivery of the pledged commitments made to that \r\nsister Caribbean nation. \r\n We are obliged to work selflessly to preserve the \r\nworld for future generations. The avoidance of a \r\nnuclear confrontation is one sure way. We therefore \r\ncongratulate the Government of the United States and \r\nall other Governments that have put much time and \r\neffort towards the non-proliferation of nuclear \r\nweapons. \r\n We are also encouraged by recent positive signs \r\nof engagement between warring parties, and we hope \r\nthat political and military conflicts around the world \r\nand, moreover, in the Middle East will soon come to an \r\nend. Grenada is particularly pleased that the \r\nPalestinians and Israelis are prepared to resume talks \r\nover their long-standing dispute with a view to finding \r\na lasting peace once and for all. \r\n We empathize with the many countries that have \r\nhad to cope with recent natural disasters: Chile, China, \r\nPakistan, New Zealand and Guatemala. \r\n Over the decades, the United Nations has played \r\ncritical roles in almost every facet of global affairs: \r\npolitical, economic and social. That is its strength, its \r\nenduring mission. Grenada remains ready to work with \r\nall who are partnering in political, economic and social \r\ndevelopment and seeing the United Nations as a forum \r\nfor working through all thorny issues. \r\n However, there will be no international peace and \r\nstability if people are unhappy, if they have no food or \r\nclothing, if they have no potable water or shelter from \r\nadverse climatic conditions. There will be no security if \r\ndisputes cannot be settled amicably, if nations are not free \r\nto determine their own destiny and if diversity among us \r\nis not recognized and fully respected. The world would \r\ncertainly be a better place if we shared our world’s \r\nresources to assist the more vulnerable among us. \r\n I challenge this Organization, for another 65 years \r\nstarting with this sixty-fifth session, to harness our \r\nstrengths and continue to make the United Nations what \r\nwe all want it to be — a real force for good in the world. \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime \r\nMinister and Minister of National Security, \r\nInformation and Legal Affairs of Grenada for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\n Mr. Tillman Thomas, Prime Minister and Minister \r\nof National Security, Information and Legal \r\nAffairs of Grenada, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n A/65/PV.20\r\n \r\n21 10-55128 \r\n \r\n  Address by Ms. Kamla Persad-Bissessar, MP, \r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Trinidad  \r\nand Tobago \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Trinidad and Tobago. \r\n Ms. Kamla Persad-Bissessar, MP, Prime Minister \r\nof the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I have great \r\npleasure in welcoming Her Excellency Ms. Kamla \r\nPersad-Bissessar, Prime Minister of the Republic of \r\nTrinidad and Tobago, and inviting her to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n Ms. Persad-Bissessar (Trinidad and Tobago): \r\nFirst, I offer my congratulations on your election,  \r\nMr. President. I also take this opportunity to recognize \r\nthe leadership of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, \r\nwhose influence brought to this sixty-fifth session of \r\nthe General Assembly 139 heads of State or \r\nGovernment to rededicate efforts to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. \r\n It is with a sense of hope for a better world that I \r\naddress this Assembly of leaders and decision makers. \r\nI join the Assembly and the international community in \r\nechoing the call for a world where people are again \r\nplaced at the centre of our actions, where the care of \r\nchildren is given greater priority, where poverty is seen \r\nas an enemy of human dignity, where peace can be \r\nachieved without bloodshed, where conversations \r\nresulting in greater tolerance, mutual respect and \r\nunderstanding would motivate cooperation and unity, \r\nand where selflessly sacrificing one’s best skills and \r\nresources for the benefit of fellow human beings would \r\nbe the primary purpose of our actions. I believe that all \r\nof this is possible if we recommit ourselves to the \r\nfounding principles upon which the United Nations \r\nwas built. \r\n The United Nations must continue to provide a \r\nvoice to all States whether small or large, developed or \r\ndeveloping, industrialized or agrarian. The Charter of \r\nthe United Nations provides for the sovereign equality \r\nof all States. It must be at the centre of all discussions \r\nand decisions geared towards meeting the demands of \r\nits membership in this third millennium. For that \r\nreason, we welcome the theme of this year’s debate: \r\n“Reaffirming the central role of the United Nations in \r\nglobal governance”. \r\n We are of the view, as are many of you, that no \r\nnation will be safe and no democracy will prevail if \r\nthere is no mutual cooperation towards global stability, \r\nfashioned by opportunity for all, equity and the ability \r\nto feed, provide health care, clothing, housing and \r\neducation for people everywhere. We are all in this \r\ntogether. We shall rise or fall together. \r\n Let us not take for granted the significance of our \r\npresence here. That we can sit in one Hall means that \r\nwe can also work together to achieve those noble \r\nobjectives, which foster and promote global peace and \r\nstability. \r\n To realize those goals, our debate of this topic \r\nmust not be reduced to empty rhetoric and nice \r\nlanguage. We must reaffirm the essential role of the \r\nUnited Nations in resolving global issues and make the \r\nUnited Nations more accountable. So we must look at a \r\nwider definition of global governance. \r\n It is our respectful view that global governance \r\nmust not only mean agreement on a body of rules, laws \r\nor practices that place the United Nations at the centre \r\nof all matters which confront the international \r\ncommunity; it must also mean that we hold our leaders \r\nand institutions more accountable for their actions, \r\ndelivering a better quality of life for all our peoples. \r\nNo nation large or small must be exempted. \r\n Global governance cannot be limited to the \r\ncrafting of instruments related to the promotion of \r\ndemocracy. A key component must be the creation of \r\nfair and equitable rules to enhance the development \r\nprospects of developing countries as well. We \r\nrecognize the rules governing membership of groups \r\nsuch as the Group of 20 (G20), but a mechanism must, \r\nwe believe, be established to insert the voice of the \r\nUnited Nations in the activities of those groups, such \r\nthat the concerns and needs of all Members are actively \r\nconsidered. Trinidad and Tobago therefore calls for the \r\nestablishment of predictable and regular channels to \r\nfacilitate dialogue between the G20 nations and \r\nMembers of the United Nations, which constitute the \r\n“Group of 192” or the “G192”. It is our hope that some \r\nof those issues will be examined at the next G20 \r\nSummit, scheduled in November of this year. \r\n At the same time, Trinidad and Tobago, as Chair-\r\nin-Office of the Commonwealth, calls on the General \r\nA/65/PV.20  \r\n \r\n10-55128 22 \r\n \r\nAssembly to recognize the important work being done \r\nby the Commonwealth, especially as it relates to small \r\nand vulnerable economies. The international \r\ncommunity must do more to deal with the economic \r\nplight of its most vulnerable Members, which depend \r\nheavily on the flow of international capital and trade to \r\nensure that their development needs are met. Trinidad \r\nand Tobago intends to use its position as Chair of the \r\nCommonwealth to promote enhanced cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the Commonwealth so \r\nas to facilitate measures aimed at providing \r\ndevelopment financing in a predictable manner to \r\ndeveloping countries. This would mean a willingness \r\non the part of international financial institutions to \r\nre-examine whether some of their policies have been \r\ncreating a perpetual cycle of poverty for small nations. \r\nSuch a cycle must not be allowed to continue. \r\n A few days ago I participated here in the High-\r\nlevel Plenary Meeting on the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. Since then, the question that keeps lingering in \r\nmy mind is whether we would have to convene another \r\nmeeting in the future — shortly — to restate the urgent \r\nneed to provide the necessary assistance to developing \r\ncountries, so that they can meet the MDGs. While I \r\napplaud the noble efforts of the United Nations in \r\nproviding an enabling environment for leaders to \r\nexchange ideas and to formulate solutions on the \r\nsubject, I must confess that over the years we have had \r\nample rhetoric but insufficient action on this matter. \r\n In my country we have put in place a Ministry of \r\nthe People to deal with poverty eradication and hunger \r\nas a priority. This is just one vehicle aimed at placing \r\nus in a position to honour our commitments to reduce \r\npoverty. However, we are of the firm view that \r\ninternational cooperation is also essential. Good \r\ngovernance requires that developed countries fulfil \r\ntheir commitments made at the Millennium Summit to \r\nprovide assistance to developing countries, so that \r\nthose countries can achieve the MDGs by the deadline \r\nset. The deficit in commitment has to be addressed if \r\nreal advances are to be made. We all have a duty to the \r\nfuture. It will be measured by how we fulfil our \r\nresponsibilities today. \r\n My Government has created the Children’s Life \r\nFund to provide funding and critical support for children \r\nneeding life-saving surgery. It is our belief that children \r\nmust not die in our country — or in any other country — \r\nbecause they cannot afford health care — not in the year \r\n2010. There must be new arrangements and \r\nrelationships between countries that have advanced \r\nmedical technology and those without, so that children \r\nof the poorest nations can grow as healthy human \r\nbeings and achieve their full potential. It is only when \r\nthis is done that the world will progress. \r\n My colleague from Grenada spoke about  \r\nnon-communicable diseases. Trinidad and Tobago, \r\njoined by other members of the Caribbean Community \r\n(CARICOM), has reiterated that call for international \r\nattention on the issue of the prevention and control of \r\nnon-communicable diseases. We have agreed that in \r\nSeptember 2011 a high-level meeting of the General \r\nAssembly on non-communicable diseases will be \r\nconvened (resolution 64/265). Much work remains to \r\nbe done, if we are to have a successful meeting next \r\nyear. In order to achieve the desired results, the United \r\nNations will have put in place a common set of \r\nprinciples to tackle this important concern of global \r\npublic health. \r\n On the issue of climate change, we say that \r\nTrinidad and Tobago, as a small island developing \r\nState, seeks to promote and safeguard the welfare of \r\nour planet from the harmful effects of climate change \r\nand supports measures aimed at mitigating the effects \r\nof climate change, which threaten our environment, \r\neconomic livelihood, territorial integrity and the very \r\nsurvival of many States. Although the United Nations \r\ncontinues to be at the forefront of discussions to \r\nconfront this formidable challenge, progress has been \r\nmuch too slow. In making our contribution to the \r\nprocess, we wish to reiterate the position of the \r\nAlliance of Small Island States, namely, that there \r\nshould be deep and ambitious cuts in greenhouse gas \r\nemissions by developed countries amounting to about \r\n40 to 50 per cent by the year 2020 and 85 to 90 per \r\ncent by 2050. \r\n In order for there to be meaningful advancement \r\nat the sixteenth session of the Conference of the Parties \r\nto the United Nations Framework Convention on \r\nClimate Change, to be held in Mexico, we must utilize \r\nthe coming United Nations Climate Change \r\nConference, to be held in China, to agree on the \r\nidentification of additional and predictable sources of \r\nfinance, institutional issues related to finance and the \r\nform of the final agreement. It is our respectful view \r\nthat urgent and concerted action is the only viable \r\noption to bring about results at the upcoming \r\nnegotiations. \r\n A/65/PV.20\r\n \r\n23 10-55128 \r\n \r\n I turn now to the issue of natural disasters. One of \r\nthe first problems I encountered, almost immediately \r\nafter taking the oath of office four months ago, was the \r\nissue of unprecedented and widespread flooding that \r\nresulted in tremendous financial and other losses to \r\nvictims and placed a strain on the resources of the local \r\nemergency management services. My Government \r\ncontinues to provide assistance to the affected \r\ncommunities, while we devise long-term strategies to \r\nreduce the incidence of this type of flooding. \r\nNevertheless, I recognize that we are not alone to have \r\nbeen faced with this grave problem. Recent events in \r\nHaiti, Pakistan and Russia have demonstrated that \r\ngreater international action is needed to provide relief \r\nto those affected by flooding and other natural \r\ndisasters. \r\n In the Caribbean the case of a devastated Haiti \r\nprovides the international community with the \r\nopportunity not only to be compassionate, but to also \r\nlearn major lessons on disaster preparedness and \r\nmanagement. Respectfully I say that — \r\nnotwithstanding the valuable work being done by the \r\nCentral Emergency Response Fund (CERF), to which \r\nTrinidad and Tobago has made annual contributions — \r\nmore action is required to provide the agency with the \r\nrequisite resources in the face of ever increasing \r\nnatural disasters. In this regard, I respectfully call upon \r\nthose States that are in a position to do so to make \r\nfinancial contributions to CERF, so that it can respond \r\nmore efficiently and effectively to humanitarian crises \r\ndue to floods and other natural disasters. \r\n There is another persistent matter receiving the \r\nattention of my Government and others of the \r\nCARICOM region, which is the illegal proliferation of \r\nsmall arms and light weapons and their ammunition. In \r\nour attempts to address this problem, we have had to \r\ndivert financial resources that we could have used \r\notherwise for economic and social development. We \r\nhave observed an increase in gang-related violence, \r\nhomicides, the illegal narcotics trade and organized \r\ncrime. The origin of the illicit trade in those weapons is \r\nbeyond our national borders. It is of international \r\ndimension and therefore requires a global response. We \r\nare encouraged by the attempts of the United Nations \r\nto conclude a legally binding agreement to regulate the \r\ntrade in conventional weapons. It is our view that this \r\ninstrument must also make provision for regulating the \r\ntrade in small arms and light weapons, thereby \r\npreventing their illegal diversion. \r\n Trinidad and Tobago also calls for a strong and \r\neffective implementation regime to ensure proper \r\ncompliance with the provisions of the treaty to be \r\ndrafted. It must also include a proper verification \r\nmechanism and a sanctions regime for breach of its \r\nterms. Such safeguards would assist in preserving the \r\nobject and purpose of the agreement. \r\n We have partnered with other members of the \r\ninternational community to establish rules governing \r\nthe non-proliferation of nuclear, chemical and other \r\ntypes of weapons, which could create untold suffering \r\nfor humanity. However, in the Caribbean, our weapons \r\nof mass destruction, are, ironically, small arms and \r\nlight weapons. Therefore I implore all those States that \r\nhave been reticent about the need for an arms trade \r\ntreaty to join us in this undertaking. I pledge the \r\ncommitment of my Government to work with other \r\nlike-minded States to ensure a successful outcome of \r\nthe Preparatory Committee for the United Nations \r\nConference on the Arms Trade Treaty and ultimately \r\nthe Conference itself, scheduled to take place in 2012. \r\n Tied together with the issue of small arms and \r\nammunition is drug trafficking. Regulating the trade in \r\nsmall arms and light weapons is not an end in itself. \r\nUrgent international action must also be taken to deal \r\nwith the issue of international drug trafficking. We \r\ncannot allow our young people to continue to fall \r\nvictim to this monster, which has fuelled transnational \r\norganized crime and resulted in cross-border armed \r\nviolence, threatening the political and social stability \r\nof many nations. National Governments alone cannot \r\nsolve this problem because of its global dimension. \r\nGovernments are forced to divert scarce resources, \r\nwhich should be used for social programmes, in order \r\nto confront the challenge posed by narco-trafficking. \r\nWe need urgent action to address this problem. \r\n In 1989, the Honourable Arthur Robinson, former \r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Trinidad and \r\nTobago, took the political initiative to reintroduce on \r\nthe agenda of the General Assembly the need for the \r\nestablishment of a permanent International Criminal \r\nCourt (ICC). The Court has since been established. \r\nHowever, his call for international drug trafficking to \r\nbe included as a crime within the jurisdiction of the \r\nICC has not yet been realized. Today, I say that it is \r\neven more critical for this to be done. I therefore \r\nrespectfully call upon States Members of the United \r\nNations which are States parties to the Rome Statute of \r\nthe ICC to include international drug trafficking as a \r\nA/65/PV.20  \r\n \r\n10-55128 24 \r\n \r\ncrime within the jurisdiction of the ICC. The ICC is the \r\nonly credible international judicial organ with the \r\ncompetence to prosecute those who perpetrate this \r\ncrime. \r\n In closing, I wish to raise one area of reform that \r\nI hold very dearly. That is the establishment of  \r\nUN Women, an entity which consolidates four previous \r\nagencies. I am confident that this venture, which will \r\nbecome fully operational by January 2011, will provide \r\na coherent approach in attending to issues affecting \r\nwomen internationally. It is my hope that UN Women \r\nwill receive the support of all States. \r\n Finally, 10 years ago the Security Council \r\nadopted resolution 1325 (2000) on women and peace \r\nand security, acknowledging that there can be no \r\nsustainable peace and security without the involvement \r\nand contribution of women. Trinidad and Tobago is \r\ncommitted to advancing the peace and security agenda \r\nof the United Nations, and my country’s attachment to \r\nthe promotion of women is equally strong. That is why \r\nI wish to state that Trinidad and Tobago will introduce \r\nin the First Committee of the General Assembly, \r\ndevoted to disarmament, international peace and \r\nsecurity, a resolution on women, disarmament, arms \r\ncontrol and non-proliferation. I pledge the support of \r\nthe Government of Trinidad and Tobago for this \r\ninitiative. \r\n We have spent a decade in this third millennium. \r\nIn retrospect, have we advanced as a world community \r\nin ways that will create a sustainable environment and \r\nsecure the lives of people everywhere? Yes, we have \r\nmade tremendous strides in communications \r\ntechnology; yes, we are a global village as a result of \r\nimprovements; but, regrettably, we cannot say that we \r\nare our neighbours’ keepers. There are still too many \r\nfences between us — fences of politics, ideology, \r\nreligion, ethnicity, culture and traditions. As human \r\nbeings, we have the unique capacity to reason and on \r\nthe basis of that reasoning to develop deeper \r\nunderstandings. Today, I respectfully say: Let us \r\npledge to use this understanding gained from reasoning \r\nto promote conversations between nations and peoples; \r\nconversations to replace aggression and threats; \r\nconversations geared towards finding peaceful ways to \r\ndeal with differences; conversations borne out of \r\nmutual respect for each other as people and nations; \r\nconversations founded upon respect for diversity; \r\nconversations that ensure the survival of the human \r\nrace and the planet as their purpose. \r\n As I end my contribution to this debate, I wish to \r\ncompliment the United Nations for all of the work \r\ndesigned to revitalize this unique global body. I also \r\naffirm our support for efforts and policies aimed at \r\nrevitalizing the central role of the United Nations in \r\nglobal governance. \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago for \r\nthe statement she has just made. \r\n Ms. Kamla Persad-Bissessar, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum. \r\n \r\n  Address by Ms. Jadranka Kosor, Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Croatia \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Croatia. \r\n Ms. Jadranka Kosor, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Croatia, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I have great \r\npleasure in welcoming Her Excellency Ms. Jadranka \r\nKosor, Prime Minister of the Republic of Croatia, and \r\ninviting her to address the General Assembly. \r\n Ms. Kosor (Croatia): At the outset, I would like \r\nto congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President \r\nof the General Assembly, and to stress that you can \r\ncount on the full support of the Croatian delegation in \r\nthe coming year. At the same time, I would like to \r\nthank Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki for his successful \r\nwork as President of the General Assembly over the \r\npast year and for the results achieved under his \r\nleadership. \r\n The consequences of the serious threats facing \r\nthe modern world — from terrorism and the \r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction to \r\nhumanitarian crises and climate change, to mention \r\njust a few — reach far beyond the original framework \r\nwithin which they began. Without exception, they are \r\nacquiring global proportions. In the same way, \r\ncontemporary social and economic relationships have \r\ngrown far beyond narrow national frameworks and, \r\nthrough the flow of people, goods, services and capital, \r\nare creating a global network of mutual relations and \r\ninfluence. Does the recent eruption of the volcano on \r\nIceland not testify to this in as vivid a manner as the \r\n A/65/PV.20\r\n \r\n25 10-55128 \r\n \r\njoint humanitarian actions undertaken in response to \r\nrecent terrifying natural disasters? \r\n This accelerated development of the \r\ncontemporary world, and especially the challenges and \r\nthreats to which it is exposed, call on all of us to take \r\nswift action, shoulder joint responsibility and foment \r\nnew solidarity. There is no alternative to working \r\ntogether in today’s world. \r\n In that vein, the theme you have chosen, Sir, for \r\nthe opening of the sixty-fifth session of the General \r\nAssembly reminds us, in focusing on the concept of \r\nglobal governance, of the role of the Assembly in \r\nformulating the global response to the challenges we \r\nface in today’s world. At the same time, your proposal \r\ncalls for an examination of our own contribution to the \r\nformulation of responses to these challenges. \r\n During its membership of the Security Council, \r\nCroatia promoted the ideas that are the backbone of all \r\ncivilized governance and therefore also of global \r\ngovernance: the importance of the rule of law and the \r\nprotection and promotion of international law, \r\nespecially human rights and minority rights, \r\ninternational humanitarian law and transparency in the \r\nwork of the main bodies of the United Nations. \r\n Within the rich legal heritage of the United \r\nNations, the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) \r\nhas particular significance. That document confirms \r\nthe global strategy of the United Nations in areas \r\ncrucial to the life and well-being of a large proportion \r\nof humankind, and unites the activities of the relevant \r\ninstitutions in this sphere. For Croatia, implementing \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals is of additional \r\nimportance because of their strong link with the \r\npriorities related to the process of our accession to the \r\nEuropean Union, which has entered its final phase. \r\n Croatia has decided to confirm its readiness to \r\nparticipate in the international activities aimed at \r\nachieving these goals by increasing its financial \r\ncontribution to the programmes and activities of the \r\nUnited Nations. In that context, allow me to mention \r\nthe Republic of Croatia’s successful shift from \r\nrecipient to provider of international aid. Croatia has \r\naimed its support at the neighbouring region of South-\r\nEast Europe, where our knowledge and experience may \r\nbe most useful to the recipient countries. \r\n Along with its contribution of peacekeeping \r\ntroops, police and military experts to 14 international \r\nmissions led by the United Nations, NATO and the \r\nEuropean Union, Croatia is also ready to share its \r\nexperience with States emerging from armed conflict \r\nby offering expert advice and other services in the field \r\nof security and defence sector reform and in \r\nreintegrating demobilized persons into civilian society. \r\n I would particularly like to emphasize that \r\npeacebuilding support for countries emerging from \r\narmed conflict is one of the most important and \r\ncomplex challenges confronting the United Nations. In \r\nthat light, Croatia strongly supports the work of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and the report (A/64/868, \r\nannex) drawn up by the co-facilitators of the process of \r\nreviewing the United Nations peacebuilding \r\narchitecture and the work of the Commission. Croatia \r\nwas a founding member of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, and, wishing to continue contributing to \r\nthe significant efforts being made in this area, has \r\nannounced that it will be a candidate for membership \r\nof the Commission for the period 2012-2013. \r\n However important our joint action at the global \r\nlevel may be to finding responses to the many \r\nchallenges that confront us, it is imperative when it \r\ncomes to attempting to find a deterrent to the use of \r\nnuclear weapons. In recent years, we have witnessed a \r\nrenewed desire within the international community for \r\na world without nuclear weapons, which Croatia also \r\nrecognized in the historic Security Council summit of \r\nSeptember last year on the prevention of the \r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, with \r\nPresident Barack Obama presiding (see S/PV.6191). \r\n Making its own contribution to the significant \r\nefforts aimed at preventing the proliferation of nuclear \r\nweapons, in June the Republic of Croatia successfully \r\norganized a regional workshop on the implementation \r\nof Security Council resolution 1540 (2004). Of course, \r\nin Croatia we are aware that mere words and adopted \r\ndocuments are not enough, especially to preventing the \r\ndirect threat posed by the possibility of terrorists \r\ngetting hold of weapons of mass destruction. We \r\ntherefore welcome the concrete steps being taken by \r\nthe nuclear States to reduce their nuclear capacities and \r\nto increase the transparency and security of nuclear \r\nreserves. \r\n At the same time, we must not forget that, in \r\nparallel with the existence of a nuclear threat, the \r\nillegal trade in small arms and light weapons has taken \r\nmany human lives. Croatia most strongly condemns \r\nA/65/PV.20  \r\n \r\n10-55128 26 \r\n \r\nterrorism and is wholly dedicated to preventing this \r\nthreat in all its various forms at the national, regional \r\nand global levels. In an attempt to make a contribution \r\nto these efforts, during its time as a member of the \r\nSecurity Council Croatia chaired the Counter-\r\nTerrorism Committee for two years. During its \r\npresidency of the Security Council in December 2008, \r\nCroatia organized a debate on the subject of threats to \r\ninternational peace and security caused by terrorist acts \r\n(see S/PV.6034). The Council then adopted a \r\npresidential statement (S/PRST/2008/45) calling on all \r\nMembers of the United Nations to show the same level \r\nof solidarity they displayed immediately after the \r\ntragic events of 11 September 2001. \r\n As a member of NATO and a future member of \r\nthe European Union, Croatia is strongly engaged in \r\nsecuring peace and stability in South-East Europe. This \r\nis also precisely the reason why we advocate a clear \r\nEuro-Atlantic perspective for all the States in the \r\nregion. To realize that perspective, it is first necessary \r\nto accept and fully apply the principles on which \r\nEuropean integration was initiated 60 years ago: \r\ncooperation, dialogue and mutual respect. \r\n In that spirit, Croatia and Slovenia last year \r\nagreed on a solution to their long-running border \r\ndispute through international arbitration. By my \r\nagreement with Slovenian Prime Minister Borut Pahor, \r\na new page was turned in Croatian-Slovenian relations, \r\nand at the same time a way was opened for all the other \r\ncountries of South-East Europe to realize their right to \r\na European future through dialogue and cooperation. \r\n In that sense, I would like here to welcome the \r\ndecision by the General Assembly to adopt by \r\nconsensus a resolution on Kosovo (64/298) sponsored \r\nby Serbia and the European Union. In this way, a \r\ncompletely new European paradigm of cooperation, \r\npeace and progress is being created in South-East \r\nEurope. Croatia will lead the way in supporting and \r\npromoting these values throughout the region, and \r\nespecially in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which also has \r\nthe right to a Euro-Atlantic perspective as a united \r\nState of three constitutive and equal peoples. There is \r\nno real alternative to the Euro-Atlantic future, and any \r\nattempt to go back to the old and failed ways of the \r\npast would be extremely harmful. This is the only \r\nsphere of peace and security ensuring prosperity in the \r\nEuro-Atlantic zone whose doors will be open to the \r\ncountries of South-East Europe that meet the \r\nconditions for membership of NATO and the European \r\nUnion. \r\n With this in mind, the Republic of Croatia \r\nadvocates the accepted concept of responsibility for the \r\nprotection of civilians against genocide, ethnic \r\ncleansing, war crimes and crimes against humanity. We \r\nwelcome, support and follow with special attention the \r\nwork of the International Criminal Court. In the same \r\nvein, allow me to point out here that the Republic of \r\nCroatia supports the work of the International Criminal \r\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and welcomes the \r\nTribunal’s exit strategy. \r\n Finally, this is an opportunity for me to say that \r\nthe Republic of Croatia, in line with its focus to date \r\non human rights, will continue its activities to protect \r\nand promote them. I especially welcome the \r\nestablishment of UN Women as an important and \r\nwelcome new body within the Organization, aimed at \r\nsupporting gender equality and strengthening the \r\nposition of women. \r\n In closing, allow me to end this address by \r\nasserting that lasting and civilized governance, \r\nespecially insofar as it includes the United Nations, \r\nmust arise from the individual and return to the \r\nindividual. The protection of the dignity of human life, \r\nand the dignity and identity of each nation, is the firm \r\nfoundation on which the United Nations can fulfil its \r\ntask to promote peace and security in today’s \r\nglobalized world. \r\n The President (spoke in French): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I thank the Prime Minister of \r\nthe Republic of Croatia for the statement she has just \r\nmade. \r\n Ms. Jadranka Kosor, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Croatia, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Zalmai Rassoul, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. \r\n Mr. Rassoul (Afghanistan): I join previous \r\nspeakers in congratulating you, Sir, on your election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth \r\nsession. I am confident that, under your able \r\nstewardship, our deliberations will be fruitful. \r\n Sixty-five years ago, the creation of the United \r\nNations heralded hope for global peace, security and \r\n A/65/PV.20\r\n \r\n27 10-55128 \r\n \r\nrespect for human dignity. Today, the United Nations \r\nremains the most effective universal body for \r\npreserving the principles upon which it was founded. \r\nAs one of its earliest Member States, Afghanistan fully \r\nand consistently subscribes to the centrality of the \r\nUnited Nations and to the principles of multilateralism \r\nthat guarantee a democratic international order in \r\nwhich we all have an equal voice and participation in \r\ndecisions impacting our world. \r\n Today more than ever before, our world demands \r\na commitment to working together so that we may \r\novercome the multifaceted challenges and threats to \r\nour survival and well-being. The United Nations is \r\npivotal to our ability to translate our common sense of \r\npurpose and determined political will to replace \r\ndesperation with hope, poverty with prosperity, \r\ninjustice with justice and violence with peace. \r\n Last week, the High-level Plenary Meeting on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) adopted an \r\noutcome document and plan of action for the full \r\nrealization of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(resolution 65/1). Fifteen years ago when the MDGs \r\nwere adopted, we recognized that comprehensive and \r\ncollective effort was essential to the attainment of the \r\nGoals. Last week’s summit again underscored the need \r\nfor enhanced international cooperation and \r\ncoordination in order to achieve human development \r\nand well-being. \r\n Afghanistan remains fully committed to meeting \r\nits MDG targets. We have made some progress, but the \r\nscourge of international terrorism, insecurity and \r\nthreats to the rule of law and governance remain \r\nenormous challenges to promoting human development \r\nin Afghanistan. \r\n On the eve of the ninth anniversary of the \r\ndeclaration of the global war on terror in October 2001, \r\nthe international community’s promise to the people of \r\nAfghanistan of a life free from the fear of the threat \r\nand exploitation of international terrorism remains \r\nunfulfilled. Afghans continue to suffer from horrific \r\nacts of terrorist violence on a daily basis. \r\n On many occasions from this rostrum, the Afghan \r\ndelegation has drawn the global community’s attention \r\nto the reality that terrorism and the ideologies of \r\nextremism and radicalism are spawned beyond the \r\nborders of Afghanistan. In spite of the combined efforts \r\nof our military allies, terrorists continue to infiltrate \r\nour borders with the intent of inflicting harm on our \r\npeople and the brave soldiers of partner countries. As \r\nlong as certain State and non-State actors provide  \r\nAl-Qaida and affiliated individuals and entities with \r\nsanctuary, arms and financing, they will remain \r\nformidable and murderous adversaries. \r\n Terrorism in our region is a growing threat to \r\nworld peace and security. The audacity and geographic \r\nscope of extremist and terrorist groups harboured in \r\nour region continue to expand. If our international \r\npartners and allies wish to win the global war on \r\nterrorism, they must look beyond villages in \r\nAfghanistan and engage in a strategy that will \r\neffectively and decisively dismantle organizations and \r\nnetworks that continue to support terrorist and radical \r\nmilitants with impunity. Terrorism remains a global \r\nchallenge that can be defeated only through a concerted \r\ninternational effort. \r\n In this context, Afghanistan is committed to \r\nexpanding counter-terrorism cooperation with the \r\nGovernment of Pakistan and with other countries in our \r\nregion. \r\n The people of Afghanistan have known too much \r\nviolence and too much despair. We have seen too many \r\nof our young people lose their lives as a result of war \r\nand conflict. The Afghan people crave peace, stability \r\nand security. Although our fight against those who \r\nmenace the lives and well-being of our people will \r\ncontinue unabated, we recognize that the success of our \r\nefforts for development and prosperity will depend \r\nlargely on our ability to achieve sustainable peace in \r\nour country. \r\n With this objective in mind, the Afghan \r\nGovernment convened a National Consultative Peace \r\nJirga in June of this year. The Jirga fulfilled President \r\nKarzai’s promise to consult and engage all Afghans in \r\npeacebuilding initiatives. The Jirga — which \r\nassembled tribal leaders, parliamentarians, and \r\nrepresentatives of provincial councils, businesses and \r\ncivil society, and had over 20 per cent female \r\nparticipation — helped to jump-start a representative \r\npeace and reconciliation process that will be pursued in \r\nconformity with our Constitution and human rights \r\ncommitments. \r\n The Consultative Peace Jirga agreed on a \r\nframework to encourage the rank and file of the \r\nTaliban to end violence and to join a reconciliation and \r\nreintegration process. It defined the conditions for a \r\npeace dialogue with Taliban leaders and endorsed the \r\nA/65/PV.20  \r\n \r\n10-55128 28 \r\n \r\nestablishment of a peace commission to oversee the \r\nreintegration of armed opposition fighters who \r\nrenounce violence, resume civilian life, accept our \r\nConstitution and embrace our democracy. \r\n Over the past eight years, we and our \r\ninternational partners have realized substantial \r\nachievements, but also have made mistakes. Many \r\nchallenges and obstacles remain to ensuring \r\nsustainable security for the people of Afghanistan and \r\nto meeting their aspirations to a better life and future. \r\nAt the London and Kabul Conferences held earlier this \r\nyear, the international community not only reaffirmed \r\nits commitment to safeguarding Afghanistan’s \r\nsovereignty, territorial integrity and stability, but also \r\nrecognized the critical importance of Afghan \r\nownership and leadership to consolidating our joint \r\nachievements and engaging the greater confidence of \r\nthe Afghan people. \r\n By building on the mutual commitments made at \r\nthe milestone Conferences in London and Kabul to \r\ntransfer security and development responsibilities to \r\nthe Afghans, and by pursing comprehensive economic \r\ndevelopment, security, governance and our inclusive \r\nreconciliation strategies, we are convinced that we will \r\nsuccessfully combat the efforts of extremists and \r\nterrorists seeking to regain hold of Afghanistan. \r\n For our part, the Government of Afghanistan is \r\nsteadfast in its commitment to pursuing the reform \r\nagenda that President Karzai outlined in his inaugural \r\nspeech. We are committed to reinforcing our social \r\ncompact with the people of Afghanistan by \r\nstrengthening our judiciary, combating corruption, \r\nrevitalizing our economy and promoting good \r\ngovernance at all levels of the Government. As \r\ndemonstrated by the recently held parliamentary \r\nelections, the Government and the people of \r\nAfghanistan are steadfast in advancing our democracy. \r\n With the support and collaboration of our \r\ninternational partners and allies, we are committed to \r\nenhancing the capacity and ability of the Afghan \r\nSecurity Forces to assume greater responsibility for the \r\nprotection and security of our country. In this context, I \r\nwish to acknowledge the enhanced effort of our \r\nmilitary allies to protect our civilian populations from \r\nthe detrimental effects of military operations against \r\nthe terrorists and militants. \r\n The people of Afghanistan embrace the challenge \r\nof building a better future. However, the insidious \r\ndangers of extremism and terrorism and their ever-\r\nincreasing link to narcotics pose a serious threat to the \r\nsecurity and stability of our country and our region. \r\nAlongside our fight against terrorism, we are \r\ncommitted to working closely with our neighbours and \r\nother international partners to win the war on narcotics. \r\n To complement our efforts to eliminate poppy \r\nproduction, we wish to see greater action to counter \r\nsmuggling of precursors into our country and to reduce \r\nthe demand for and consumption of drugs in other \r\ncountries. \r\n Recent climate-induced disasters experienced in \r\nour region, such as the catastrophic floods in Pakistan, \r\nnot only pose severe challenges for local populations \r\nand national Governments, but may also have \r\nramifications for the economies of countries in the \r\nregion and for global security. We see increased \r\nurgency for effective regional collaboration on disaster \r\nmitigation and response. \r\n At various international, regional and subregional \r\ngatherings, we have emphasized the importance of a \r\nstable, democratic and moderate Afghanistan to the \r\neconomic development of our region and global \r\nsecurity. By virtue of its location at the crossroads of \r\nfour geostrategically important regions — Central \r\nAsia, South Asia, China and the Middle East — \r\nAfghanistan could play an important role in facilitating \r\nincreased trade and transit and unleashing the \r\nenormous potential of our region. We will work \r\ntowards further gains in trade and transit with countries \r\nin the region. \r\n The recent conclusion of the Afghanistan-\r\nPakistan- Transit Trade Agreement and the signing by \r\nthe heads of State of Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, \r\nPakistan and India of an agreement on a gas pipeline \r\nproject are milestones for increased regional \r\ncooperation. In addition, we have concluded the \r\nfeasibility study for a Central Asia-South Asia project \r\nfor the transfer of electricity from Kyrgyzstan and \r\nTajikistan to Afghanistan and Pakistan. These \r\ninitiatives will contribute greatly to peace, security and \r\nstability in our region. Afghanistan stands ready to step \r\nup cooperation with all its neighbours on economic, \r\npolitical and crime-related issues. \r\n I have spoken of the desire of the people of \r\nAfghanistan for peace and stability and of our right to \r\nthem. We are, however, acutely aware that for over half \r\na century our brothers and sisters in Palestine have \r\n A/65/PV.20\r\n \r\n29 10-55128 \r\n \r\nbeen denied their right to an independent State living in \r\npeaceful coexistence with its neighbours. We are \r\nencouraged by the resumption of direct talks between \r\nthe Israeli and Palestinian leadership, which give us \r\nhope that sustainable peace in the Middle East may be \r\nsecured. \r\n To conclude, I thank the States members of this \r\nAssembly for their solidarity and their support for the \r\nliberty and well-being of the people of Afghanistan. \r\nThe Afghan people will never forget the generosity and \r\ngreat sacrifices of the United States, NATO and other \r\ninternational partners, whose men and women have \r\nbravely stood with us to defend our common security \r\nand ensure peace and stability for Afghanistan. \r\n I thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \r\nefforts to revitalize the sense of partnership, \r\ncooperation and confidence between Afghanistan and \r\nthe international community. I also thank the dedicated \r\nand committed staff of the United Nations and its \r\nspecialized agencies for helping the Afghan people \r\nbuild a peaceful, secure and prosperous future. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Samuel Santos López, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Nicaragua. \r\n Mr. Santos López (Nicaragua) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): In the name of the Nicaraguan people and of \r\nComrade President Commander Daniel Ortega \r\nSaavedra, I convey my warmest brotherly greetings to \r\nyou, Sir, and to each and every one of the peoples and \r\nGovernments represented in the General Assembly. \r\n As the shadows of apocalyptic threats darken the \r\nworld stage, we begin to doubt the capacity for reason \r\nand the strength of the most noble sentiments of human \r\nbeings to face up to the serious problems confronting \r\nhumanity. Various types of information are \r\nmanipulated by the global communications media in \r\norder to continually discredit the independence efforts \r\nof the Governments of the South. They disseminate the \r\nidea that humanity is impotent in the face of the \r\npresent state of disaster and that we must prepare for \r\nthe worst. Furthermore, what is worse is that they tell \r\nus that no one is responsible and that it is a faceless \r\ndisaster, seeking thus to exonerate the industrialized \r\ncountries of the North. \r\n However, we know full well that the underlying \r\ncause of the serious crises we are experiencing is the \r\nnature of the system of economic, political and social \r\nrelations established by global capitalism and the effort \r\nto have that system accepted as a universal paradigm. \r\n In this regard, the poor countries, which are \r\nreferred to by the euphemism “developing countries”, \r\ncan strip away the masks of those who — driven by \r\ngreed, selfishness and the desire for absolute power in \r\nthe name of manifest destiny or of divine reason — \r\nhave brought humankind to the brink of extinction. \r\n Nicaragua, which has experienced the pain and \r\ninjustice of war first-hand, is against war. We do not \r\naccept the failure of reason. We do not accept war as \r\nthe obligatory language among peoples. Nicaragua \r\nrejects war as a solution to conflicts between States. \r\nWe reject war as a means for appropriating the planet’s \r\nnatural resources or for imposing the hegemony of a \r\nfew over the majority of the world’s nations. War will \r\nnever lead to solutions partial or full, much less \r\ndefinitive. The invasion of Iraq by foreign troops under \r\nfalse pretexts has brought neither peace nor stability to \r\nthat country. On the contrary, it has left that country in \r\nruins and failed to bring greater stability to the region. \r\n The war in Afghanistan has become a dead end \r\nfor the occupiers. At the same time, it has also had \r\nnegative effects on its neighbours. Security Council \r\nresolution 1929 (2010), which imposes new sanctions \r\non the Islamic Republic of Iran, has only served to \r\nincrease the possibility of a large-scale military \r\nconflict with unforeseeable consequences. The war \r\ngames on the Korean peninsula increase tensions in \r\nthat region, jeopardizing the gains achieved between \r\nthe two Koreas. Neither Europe nor the Persian Gulf \r\nhas escaped the expanding zone of militarization. \r\nSimilarly, the establishment of military bases and the \r\ndeployment of naval and air power on Latin American \r\nsoil threaten the political stability of our nations. \r\n “Among individuals, as among nations, respect \r\nfor the rights of others is peace”. This saying of Benito \r\nJuárez, President of Mexico and the first indigenous \r\npresident in the Americas, clearly reflects the \r\nconception of and will for peace among the peoples of \r\nthe world. This apothegm should guide our \r\nOrganization, and in particular the Security Council, \r\nensuring that their actions adhere strictly to the \r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations. \r\n Moreover, Nicaragua believes that there is a close \r\nrelation between disarmament and development. Our \r\ncommitment to security includes a commitment to the \r\npromotion of human rights, which we interpret as \r\nA/65/PV.20  \r\n \r\n10-55128 30 \r\n \r\ntantamount to sustainable development centred on the \r\nhuman being and implemented in an environment of \r\ngood governance with direct citizen participation and \r\nsocial equality, which are indispensable to real \r\ndevelopment. \r\n From our point of view, the resources freed up as \r\na result of disarmament efforts should be directed to \r\nensuring the attainment of the national social \r\ndevelopment goals of each of our countries. One only \r\nhas to take a brief glance at the trillions of dollars \r\nspent on war to realize how many human problems \r\ncould be solved with these funds, alleviating the pain \r\ncaused by poverty and exclusion. The global economic \r\nand financial crisis has had little or no effect on global \r\nmilitary spending. \r\n Nicaragua remains actively committed to the \r\ncause of general and complete disarmament. Nicaragua \r\nbelieves that only a climate of fundamental trust and \r\nsolidarity can guarantee strict compliance with arms \r\ncontrol and disarmament accords with a view to \r\nattaining complete disarmament — and especially \r\nnuclear disarmament — as the only option for \r\nachieving real and lasting world peace. Nicaragua \r\nsupports the inalienable right of the parties to the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to \r\nuse nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and without \r\ndiscrimination. Nicaragua encourages actions to \r\npromote the exchange of material resources, equipment \r\nand technology for the peaceful use of nuclear energy \r\nin order to guarantee the sustainable economic \r\ndevelopment of every nation and the world. \r\n Precisely because of this belief, Nicaragua \r\ndemands that neither Iran nor any other nation be taken \r\nto task for developing nuclear programmes for peaceful \r\npurposes. It is possible to build trust based on dialogue \r\nand negotiation. In this context, Nicaragua joins the \r\ngeneral support expressed for the tripartite declaration \r\nof Brazil, Turkey and Iran, which constitutes an \r\nalternative for promoting regional and world peace. \r\n That which was a warning yesterday is today a \r\nreality. The present international context is leading to a \r\nglobal political crisis. The entire political model \r\nconstructed and articulated around the paradigm of \r\nneo-liberalism, globalization and the free market is in \r\nquestion. At the global level, we need more decisive \r\naction to affirm multilateralism as the new paradigm. \r\nSuch multilateralism must listen to the voices of \r\npeoples living in extreme poverty and \r\nunderdevelopment. It must take the new political \r\nrealities into account and effectively democratize the \r\nworld order, beginning with this Organization, \r\nincluding the Security Council and the United Nations \r\nas a whole; re-establish the representational and \r\ndemocratic rights of its 192 Member States; and \r\nidentify the rights and obligations that are common to \r\nall States without undermining their sovereignty, \r\nindependence and self-determination, regardless of \r\ntheir size. \r\n In Latin America and the Caribbean, this trend is \r\nmanifest in the process of integration and unity taking \r\nplace among our peoples. We have already made the \r\nhistoric decision to create the Latin American and \r\nCaribbean Community of States, whose \r\ninstitutionalization will begin next year and conclude \r\nin 2012. This is further and unquestionable proof of the \r\nprofound changes taking place in the world. \r\n The Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our \r\nAmerica has become the vanguard of this process of \r\nchange. The struggle against intervention of all kinds, \r\nincluding military intervention, and for the \r\nmaintenance and re-establishment of peace is an \r\nessential component of the Alliance’s action in its \r\nrelations with the world, and strengthens its capacity to \r\nguarantee the national sovereignty of its peoples. \r\n Nicaragua joins the brotherly people of Puerto \r\nRico in waving the flag of its independence which has \r\nbeen unjustly trampled. The criminal economic \r\nblockade by the Government of the United States of \r\nAmerica against the brotherly people and Government \r\nof heroic Cuba must stop immediately, and the five \r\nCuban heroes, counter-terrorism combatants \r\nimprisoned in United States jails, must be released \r\nnow. \r\n We express our solidarity with the brotherly \r\npeople of Argentina in their demand for sovereignty \r\nover the Malvinas Islands and with the brotherly \r\npeople of the Democratic Arab Saharan Republic in \r\ntheir quest to be recognized as an independent State. \r\n The war and State terrorism against the people of \r\nPalestine must immediately cease. All Security Council \r\nand General Assembly resolutions concerning Israel \r\nmust be respected and complied with. We must tie the \r\nhands of those who fan the flames of hatred and war \r\nand are capable of attacking a humanitarian flotilla — \r\nan act that has been denounced by the Human Rights \r\nCouncil commission of inquiry. \r\n A/65/PV.20\r\n \r\n31 10-55128 \r\n \r\n We salute the invitation extended by the \r\ninternational community to Taiwan to participate in the \r\nwork of some United Nations specialized agencies \r\ndirectly related to the well-being of the 23 million \r\nTaiwanese. In this regard, we call on the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \r\nand the International Civil Aviation Organization to \r\nadopt a similar position. \r\n Never before have we had so much information \r\nor, I hope, been so conscious of the severity of the \r\nenvironmental crisis affecting our planet. Our \r\nawareness of the gravity of the situation makes it \r\nindispensable that we forge a coalition of forces based \r\non the common values and inspiring principles that \r\nserve as the ethical foundation and catalyst for \r\npractices to promote a sustainable way of life. The \r\nEarth, with its minerals and sources of energy; with its \r\nland, water, forests and marine life; with its ecosystems \r\nand micro-organisms, must be recognized as our \r\nsupreme and universal benefactor and an integral part \r\nof humankind, and not only as a source of survival. \r\n Global capitalism, with its logic of competition \r\nand unlimited growth and its unsustainable modes of \r\nproduction and consumption, separates human beings \r\nfrom nature and establishes a relationship of dominion \r\nover it. This situation must change and be restored to \r\nthe right track before it is too late for us all. \r\n The meeting in Copenhagen demonstrated the \r\npower of the interests that block decisive action on \r\nclimate change and the rights of Mother Earth. It left \r\nus with the unpleasant feeling that we had wasted our \r\ntime and that those who impede the urgent solutions \r\nneeded to address the critical state of Mother Earth are \r\nuncommitted to change. With our eyes fixed on hope, \r\nwe continue to promote our commitments based on the \r\nfundamental principle of common but differentiated \r\nresponsibilities. These should be proportional to the \r\ngreenhouse gas emissions accumulated since the onset \r\nof the Industrial Revolution and not since last year. \r\nThose who have historically caused the damage should \r\nassume most of the responsibility.  \r\n In that hope, Nicaragua was the first country of \r\nthe world to have signed the Universal Declaration of \r\nthe Rights of Mother Earth, and calls on all the \r\ncountries of the world to sign it. It was also in that \r\nhope that Nicaragua signed the People’s Agreement \r\nadopted in Cochabamba in April during the World \r\nPeople’s Conference on Climate Change and the Rights \r\nof Mother Earth. It is in that hope that Nicaragua trusts \r\nthat, when we arrive in Cancún, we will be united in \r\nseeking agreements that will at least partially reverse \r\nthe harm, and in taking a path that re-establishes the \r\nlost or gravely endangered balance between humankind \r\nand Mother Earth. \r\n Although it is proclaimed without much support \r\nthat the worst of the global economic and financial \r\ncrisis is behind us, its most serious effects remain and \r\ncontinue to greatly affect our peoples. We should not \r\ncontinue to accept the imposition of economic models \r\nbased on the pillage and exploitation of our riches. \r\n For all of those reasons, Nicaragua and most of \r\nthe Latin American nations are dedicated to building an \r\nalternative model of economic sovereignty, a sphere of \r\ninterdependence and solidarity that will enable us to \r\nface global capitalism’s profound crisis and to recover \r\nour capacity to determine our own paths to \r\ndevelopment. We reaffirm that the development \r\nstrategies of each country are their own responsibility, \r\nthat they should have national ownership and \r\nleadership, and that foreign cooperation should be in \r\nline with the strategies, plans and objectives of the \r\ncountry that receives it. \r\n In connection with the urgent need to create a \r\nnew model, we reiterate our support for the outcome of \r\nthe Conference on the World Financial and Economic \r\nCrisis and Its Impact on Development of June 2009 \r\n(resolution 63/303, annex). There can be no economic \r\nrecovery or balance in the inequality with the present \r\nmodel, which concentrates the income and wealth \r\namong and within nations. \r\n All of this should take place in a framework of \r\nmutual respect, devoid of punitive political conditions \r\nagainst our peoples that would block and stifle the \r\ndevelopment of the countries of the South. \r\n Besides the hundreds of millions of people in the \r\nworld who suffer from hunger, we have before us the \r\nterrifying reality that in developing countries,  \r\n10.9 million children under the age of five die every \r\nyear. Malnutrition and hunger-related diseases cause  \r\n60 per cent of those deaths. The cost of malnutrition to \r\nnational economic development is estimated at \r\nbetween $20 and $30 billion per year. That intolerable \r\nsituation must stop. The developed countries must \r\nfulfil their commitments to eliminate the suffering of \r\nmillions of human beings. \r\nA/65/PV.20  \r\n \r\n10-55128 32 \r\n \r\n Nicaragua reaffirms its decision to confront, with \r\nthe means available to it and in the context of its \r\nnational sovereignty, the different forms of \r\ntransnational organized crime, which have become a \r\npermanent threat to domestic and international security. \r\nSimilarly, Nicaragua reiterates its position of \r\ncombating terrorism in all its forms and whatever their \r\nsource. \r\n There are several processes that are hampering \r\nnecessary and urgent changes. The most prominent is \r\nthe suppression of information — not saying anything \r\nin order to perpetuate ignorance. And when \r\ninformation is made available, it is distorted and \r\nalways against the peoples’ interests and their \r\nlegitimate aspirations and experiences, thus converting \r\nlies into truths and vice versa, converting a smile into a \r\nsneer, words into noise and an objective fact into \r\nvirtual reality. \r\n The universal citizen is witness, through global \r\ncommunication, to a real war for truth and freedom, \r\nforced to confront a permanent, slanderous campaign \r\nagainst change, against hope and against the proper \r\nevolution of history. That campaign has far-reaching \r\nimplications and has the goal of destroying the process \r\nof direct popular democracy and of the profound and \r\nrevolutionary social transformations that are taking \r\nplace in our countries as a result of the triumph of \r\nrevolutionary political forces, as is the case in \r\nNicaragua with the Sandinista Front. We must \r\ndenounce the campaign waged by hegemonic and \r\nselfish interests in a few countries in an attempt to \r\nundermine the legitimacy of our political system and \r\nour people’s Government. \r\n Nicaragua proclaims its right to live in peace and \r\nto combat the poverty, illiteracy, hunger and \r\nmalnutrition generated by historic exclusion and the \r\nimposition of an economic and political model that is \r\nalien to our reality. Nicaragua declares its dignity, \r\nsovereignty, self-determination, respect, unity and \r\nsolidarity with all the peoples of the Earth, as \r\nguaranteed by the United Nations Charter. Nicaragua is \r\nworking to develop a social awareness of solidarity \r\nidentified with the ideals of humankind, justice, \r\nfreedom and democracy for all, without exception. \r\n From this forum, Nicaragua makes a vehement \r\ncall for world peace, for the survival of the human \r\nspecies, for the dignified future of the noblest \r\naspirations of men and women. That is the only \r\npossible future. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Peter Shanel Agovaka, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs and External Trade of the Solomon \r\nIslands. \r\n Mr. Agovaka (Solomon Islands): It is indeed an \r\nhonour for me to congratulate you, Sir, on behalf of the \r\nGovernment and people of Solomon Islands, as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at our sixty-fifth \r\nsession. Your term in office coincides with economic \r\nturmoil, the impacts of climate change, growing social \r\nand security concerns and threats of unilateralism that \r\nare challenging multilateralism from all fronts. My \r\ndelegation is pleased with the manner in which you \r\nhave convened and concluded three high-level \r\nmeetings, on the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs), biodiversity and the Mauritius Strategy. That \r\nis a clear indication of why we are confident in you and \r\nof your vast experience as you oversee this principal \r\nbody of the United Nations for the next 12 months. \r\n My delegation takes this opportunity to \r\nacknowledge as well the leadership and contributions \r\nof your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Ali \r\nAbdussalam Treki. His support for multilateralism has \r\nplaced us on firm footing in preparing for this session. \r\n We see around us the growth of democracy, \r\ncorporate power and the emergence of new powers, all \r\noffering new perspectives and opportunities. New \r\ninternational cooperation is linking development, \r\nfinance, raw materials and markets. That development \r\ncalls for increased collaboration and a new framework \r\nto facilitate the emergence of a new economic order. \r\nSolomon Islands, under its new foreign policy, will \r\nestablish relationships with all six regions of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n Solomon Islands believes in multilateralism and \r\nacknowledges the importance and value of having a \r\ncloser working relationship between the United \r\nNations and Member States. My Government stands \r\nready and committed to work with the United Nations \r\nin enhancing its presence in my capital. In that \r\nconnection, we renew our call to upgrade the United \r\nNations Sub-office in Honiara and appoint a resident \r\nrepresentative as its head. \r\n My delegation acknowledges United Nations \r\noutreach to Solomon Islands this year by convening the \r\n A/65/PV.20\r\n \r\n33 10-55128 \r\n \r\nUnited Nations national competitive recruitment exam \r\nin December. We welcome that engagement, as it \r\nprovides an opportunity for successful citizens to fill \r\nour national quota of international civil servants \r\nserving our family of nations. \r\n Democracy is one of the core principles of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter. People continue to be the \r\nsource of the legitimacy of this Organization and \r\nremain the basis of authority of this Assembly. \r\n Solomon Islands registers its appreciation of the \r\nSecretariat’s Department of Political Affairs and the \r\nUnited Nations Development Programme for their role \r\nin coordinating some 400 local and international \r\nobservers who monitored last month’s general election. \r\nWe are equally pleased to note the positive \r\npronouncement by the various local and international \r\nmonitors that Solomon Islands’ national election was \r\nconducted in a free and fair manner. A number of \r\nelectoral reform recommendations were made, and my \r\nGovernment will act on them with a view to improving \r\nour national electoral system. \r\n The essence of progress and prosperity lies in \r\nhaving a clear and firm leadership, an obedient \r\nbureaucracy and a sense of vision. My Government is \r\ncommitted to providing those, and we will work \r\ntirelessly to offer our people a life of normality, dignity \r\nand freedom. \r\n The challenge of nation-building is huge and \r\ncostly for any developing country. For that reason, \r\neach country has to define for itself the type and form \r\nof democracy it wants to adopt, for democracy cannot \r\nbe imposed. In that connection, Solomon Islands \r\ncontinues to advocate genuine dialogue and \r\nengagement with Fiji over confrontations and sanctions \r\nand to support Fiji’s effort to determine its destiny. \r\n Solomon Islands joins the international \r\ncommunity in calling for the lifting of the 49-year-old \r\neconomic embargo against Cuba. Such an embargo \r\nbelongs to a different time and era. It is our hope that \r\nthe power of reaching out to our neighbours will break \r\ndown artificial ideological barriers. \r\n Solomon Islands will be undergoing the universal \r\nperiodic review during this session. My delegation \r\ntakes this opportunity to reaffirm the commitment of \r\nSolomon Islands to the principles and purposes of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter, including respect for human \r\nrights and fundamental freedoms for all. Solomon \r\nIslands finds it regrettable to see those principles \r\nsacrificed by some who continue to divide this \r\nAssembly. Solomon Islands recognizes the Geneva-\r\nbased Human Rights Council and its role and \r\nimpartiality as the appropriate institution to deal with \r\nissues of human rights. \r\n This year marks the seventh anniversary of my \r\ncountry’s relationship with the Regional Assistance \r\nMission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI). The current \r\npartnership framework promotes greater coherence and \r\npredictability in enhancing the quality of the \r\ncooperation to meet the country’s development needs. \r\nThe relations between Solomon Islands and RAMSI \r\nhave brought political and financial stability. However, \r\nthe underlying causes of conflict remain unaddressed. \r\nIssues of tolerance and respect for our diverse cultures \r\nhave placed much stress on our road to peace. My \r\nGovernment remains committed to addressing those \r\nissues. \r\n In June this year, the Foreign Minister of the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates, His Highness Sheikh Abdullah \r\nBin Zayed Al Nahyan, brought together Pacific small \r\nisland developing States and our Middle East brothers \r\nto discuss cooperation, including the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative in the Middle East. Solomon Islands supports \r\nall peace initiatives, including proposals to normalize \r\nrelations between the entire Arab region and Israel. The \r\ncomplexity of the Middle East conflict needs a regional \r\nsolution, and we strongly feel that parties to the \r\nconflict will need to sow conditions for peace as we \r\nwork to have a two-State solution. We are heartened to \r\nsee negotiations proceeding. However, we would like \r\nto see all stakeholders involved in the process. \r\n My delegation welcomes the outcome of this \r\nsummer’s Non-Proliferation Treaty Review \r\nConference. The existence of nuclear weapons \r\ncontinues to pose a significant threat to humanity. \r\nHistory has shown the deep horror and devastation of \r\nnuclear weapons. Solomon Islands supports the total \r\nelimination of all nuclear weapons as the only absolute \r\nguarantee for a safe and secure world. \r\n The urgency of agreeing to a legally binding \r\nagreement on climate change in Cancún, Mexico, \r\ncannot be overemphasized. It is a common concern that \r\nbinds the world together. Our planet is already \r\nabsorbing more heat and getting warmer. The global \r\ntemperature has risen by 0.7°C in the past century. \r\nUnder current trends, science tells us that the \r\nA/65/PV.20  \r\n \r\n10-55128 34 \r\n \r\ntemperature will further increase by 4 to 7°C by the \r\nend of this century, threatening the survival of many \r\nStates, including Solomon Islands. It is critical that we \r\nhave a clear plan for stabilizing greenhouse gas \r\nemissions. Solomon Islands supports the call of the \r\nsmall island developing States to restrict the \r\ntemperature rise to below 1.5°C and to bring down \r\ngreenhouse gas concentration to well below 350 parts \r\nper million. \r\n Noting that there is limited atmospheric carbon \r\nspace left, a carbon-budget approach is an option for a \r\njust and fair way to prevent the global temperature \r\nfrom reaching irreversible levels. It takes into \r\nconsideration the development needs and space \r\nconcerns of developing countries and our shared \r\nresponsibilities and rights in meeting the demands of \r\nthe health of our atmosphere. \r\n On the issue of United Nations system-wide \r\ncoherence, the General Assembly in July established a \r\nnew gender entity, UN Women. That body will further \r\nstrengthen United Nations capacity and effectiveness in \r\nadvancing the status of women worldwide. Solomon \r\nIslands looks forward to cooperating with the new \r\nentity. \r\n As regards Security Council reform, my \r\ndelegation is pleased to see informal intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations carried forward into this session. \r\nNegotiations are now focused on a common text, which \r\nwe hope will be further streamlined in achieving our \r\ngoal of making that principal United Nations organ \r\nmore representative, efficient and responsive to the \r\nemerging global threats of this century. \r\n The Pacific Ocean covers a third of the world’s \r\nsurface and accounts for a quarter of the world’s tuna \r\nindustry. In May this year, eight Pacific small island \r\ndeveloping States, including Solomon Islands, set up \r\nthe secretariat of the Parties to the Nauru Agreement \r\n(PNA) in the Marshall Islands. The PNA countries \r\nagreed to coordinate the management and conservation \r\nof their tuna resources, so as to guarantee sustainability \r\nand greater economic benefits from their resources. \r\nThe closing off of the high seas pockets within the \r\nrespective countries’ exclusive economic zones is to \r\nprevent illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and \r\nto provide a safe haven for fish to breed. \r\n On the issue of the establishment of a regional \r\nmarine scientific centre, in accordance with the United \r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea, my \r\ndelegation is pleased to note that the matter is reflected \r\nin the Secretary-General’s report. The Pacific \r\nsubregion values such a centre, which my Government \r\noffers to host. We will pursue this regionally and \r\ninternationally, in the spirit of the Convention and the \r\nMauritius Strategy Initiative. \r\n This year Papua New Guinea, the Federated \r\nStates of Micronesia and Solomon Islands made a \r\npresentation on our joint submission to the \r\nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf. We \r\nhope to do the same with our remaining submissions at \r\nan appropriate time. \r\n Solomon Islands is encouraged by the further \r\ngrowth of positive developments and engagements \r\nwith regard to the Taiwan Strait. That must be \r\ninternationally recognized, commended and supported. \r\nThe moderate and pragmatic path adopted by both the \r\nPeople’s Republic of China and Taiwan about the \r\nTaiwan Strait contributes to international peace and \r\nsecurity. \r\n Solomon Islands continues to support Taiwan’s \r\nmeaningful participation within the United Nations \r\nsystem. My delegation is heartened to note Taiwan’s \r\nparticipation as an observer at the World Health \r\nAssembly in both 2009 and 2010. That is a gesture of \r\nthe improved cross-Strait relations. Taiwan has \r\nregistered its interest in participating in two United \r\nNations treaty organizations this year: the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \r\n(UNFCCC) and the International Civil Aviation \r\nOrganization. My country supports such participation. \r\nThe two organizations deal with two global issues that \r\nare of common concern to all the world. Climate \r\nchange and aviation issues need the participation of all \r\ncountries for aviation safety and the health of our \r\natmosphere. My delegation finds it regrettable that the \r\nUNFCCC secretariat has adopted a narrow position on \r\na matter that requires the parties to the Convention and \r\nto the Kyoto Protocol to decide on. \r\n The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are \r\ninternationally agreed development benchmarks. The \r\nSolomon Islands scorecard remains mixed, uneven and \r\ngenerally off track in terms of meeting our 2015 Goals. \r\nThe international programme for the Solomon Islands \r\nfor achieving the MDGs is defined in the Mauritius \r\nStrategy and the Brussels Programme of Action. Both \r\nframeworks outline the Solomon Islands’ special \r\n A/65/PV.20\r\n \r\n35 10-55128 \r\n \r\nsituation, one that requires special international \r\nattention. \r\n The review of the Mauritius Strategy held last \r\nweek revealed that international commitments to the \r\nBarbados Programme of Action remain wanting and \r\ndisappointing. The vulnerability of small island \r\ndeveloping States (SIDS) has worsened. To address this \r\npartnership gap, Solomon Islands calls for a special \r\ncategory for SIDS within the United Nations system. \r\nThere is also a need for a firmer link between the SIDS \r\nProgramme and the United Nations Development \r\nAssistance Framework, to ensure that support is \r\nreceived from within our Organization. \r\n This session will also see the convening of the \r\nFourth United Nations Conference on the Least \r\nDeveloped Countries, in May 2011. We are equally \r\npleased that the General Assembly launched a process \r\nof national, regional and global reviews during the last \r\nsession. We look forward to working with all in \r\nachieving a comprehensive, action-oriented and \r\nmeaningful outcome to the Conference. \r\n Mr. Francisco Carrión-Mena (Ecuador), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair. \r\n My delegation wishes to acknowledge our new \r\npartners Luxembourg and Portugal, for their support, \r\nrespectively, for the Melanesian Spearhead Group and \r\nSolomon Islands external students. We remain grateful \r\nto all partners from the South and North, including \r\nCuba, Italy, Papua New Guinea, Taiwan and our \r\ntraditional partners the European Union, Australia, \r\nNew Zealand, Japan and my regional neighbours. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to assure the President \r\nof the support and cooperation of the Solomon Islands \r\nduring his term in office. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Micheál Martin, \r\nT.D., Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of \r\nIreland. \r\n Mr. Martin (Ireland): Let me begin by warmly \r\ncongratulating President Joseph Deiss on his election \r\nand extending the best wishes of the Irish Government \r\nfor a successful term in office. \r\n We gather this year against a backdrop of grave \r\nchallenges confronting the global community. \r\nForemost among them is the continuing crisis of global \r\nhunger and poverty. We recognize the obligation upon \r\nus to fulfil the commitments made to the world’s most \r\nvulnerable people when the Assembly adopted the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) in 2000. Our \r\nGovernments have to contend with the most severe \r\nglobal recession in many decades, but we must limit \r\nthe impact of the crisis on those in greatest need. We \r\nmust also maintain our commitment to halving the \r\nproportion of people living in extreme poverty and \r\nhunger by 2015. \r\n Firmer action is also called for in responding to \r\nthe threat posed by climate change. If the global \r\ncommunity fails to act now on that issue, we will face \r\na steadily escalating threat to our planet and to human \r\nsurvival. In recent months, we have also seen the \r\ndevastating consequences that natural catastrophes, \r\nsuch as those that have afflicted Pakistan and Haiti, can \r\nunleash on vulnerable populations. \r\n As with so many of the challenges and threats to \r\nour common security, it is to this great Organization \r\nthat we instinctively turn in searching for effective \r\ncollective responses. The universality of its \r\nmembership gives the United Nations a unique \r\nlegitimacy and authority. It brings the nations of the \r\nworld together under a common roof. It provides an \r\ninvaluable framework for common reflection and \r\ndecision-making. With the necessary political will, the \r\nMember States can use the authority and reach of the \r\nUnited Nations to fashion a more peaceful, equitable \r\nand secure world. \r\n One area requiring our close attention is reform \r\nof the United Nations itself. To improve the \r\neffectiveness of the Organization, we need to ensure \r\nthat its structures are fit for their purpose and adjusted \r\nto twenty-first-century realities. Ireland has actively \r\nchampioned the reform agenda at the United Nations in \r\nrecent years, and we will continue to do so. \r\n In that regard, I warmly welcome the \r\nestablishment of UN Women. Ireland is committed to \r\nsupporting that important new body within the United \r\nNations system, as it promotes greater gender equality \r\nand works to enhance the rights and well-being of \r\nwomen worldwide. Also, the benefits to be had from \r\nthe “delivering as one” programme — greater coherence \r\nin United Nations development activities and improved \r\ndelivery of services at the country level — are clear and \r\ntangible. The valuable work done in those areas \r\ndemonstrates that reform can be achieved when it is \r\nclearly shown to be in our collective interest. \r\nA/65/PV.20  \r\n \r\n10-55128 36 \r\n \r\n We need to do more, however. There is a pressing \r\nneed for a Security Council that is more properly \r\nreflective of twenty-first-century realities and that can \r\nfunction better and with increased transparency. The \r\nconstructive deliberations on that issue within the \r\ninformal plenary of the General Assembly should be \r\nintensified, with a view to identifying whether there is \r\na model for reform that can command broad consensus. \r\n The system for apportioning the expenses of the \r\nOrganization should better reflect the principle of \r\ncapacity to pay. Ireland and its European Union \r\npartners have highlighted that issue in recent years, and \r\nwe will continue to follow it closely. I look forward to \r\npositive results from the review of the existing scale \r\nmethodology that the General Assembly has been \r\nmandated to carry out. \r\n Perhaps the greatest challenge we face as a global \r\ncommunity is to take effective action to eliminate \r\npoverty and hunger. We set ourselves clear targets in \r\nadopting the Millennium Development Goals 10 years \r\nago. Here in New York we have reviewed progress \r\nover the past week. We have welcomed the remarkable \r\nprogress that has been generated through our collective \r\naction in areas such as education, child health and the \r\ntreatment of HIV and AIDS. But the reality remains \r\nthat the actual numbers of people living in poverty and \r\nhunger in our world continue to increase. \r\n In recent times, economic crisis and uncertainty \r\nhave devastated the lives of communities already \r\nfacing extreme poverty at the same time that they \r\nimpose pressure on development budgets worldwide. It \r\nis therefore imperative that developed and developing \r\ncountries, in partnership, now examine rigorously \r\nwhich actions have worked in the fight to end poverty \r\nand which can be pursued more effectively. We also \r\nneed to focus more clearly on key sectors. \r\n Since the publication of our Hunger Task Force \r\nreport two years ago, Ireland has been arguing that a \r\nmore concerted, comprehensive approach is required to \r\nend the continuing crisis of world hunger. The number \r\nof chronically hungry people has risen to almost one \r\nbillion. One in four children in the developing world is \r\nundernourished. Failure to address that crisis is \r\nundermining progress across the full range of \r\ndevelopment goals. And yet the means are available, at \r\nan affordable cost, to end that scandal. We need to \r\nmobilize the political will to do so. \r\n Last week, with the United States Secretary of \r\nState, I hosted a meeting of international leaders to \r\nbuild a partnership focusing on nutrition in the first one \r\nthousand days of life, from pregnancy to two years of \r\nage. We recognized and will give our full support to \r\nthe Scaling Up Nutrition Initiative of the Secretary \r\nGeneral. Our determination to maintain international \r\nattention to that issue is driven by the conviction that it \r\nis possible in the five years remaining to deliver \r\nmeasurable progress on our commitment to halve the \r\nproportion of people suffering from extreme poverty \r\nand hunger by 2015. \r\n One of the core tasks of this Organization is to \r\ncontribute to the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security. War and conflict are not merely \r\nprofoundly destabilizing for the regions in which they \r\noccur; they also threaten the collective security of \r\nmankind. Mobilizing effective international responses \r\nto armed conflict, as and when it occurs, and providing \r\npeacekeeping and peacebuilding support in that context \r\nare high on the United Nations agenda. In that vitally \r\nimportant area, the United Nations record of \r\naccomplishment speaks for itself, as explicitly \r\nacknowledged through the awarding of the Nobel \r\nPeace Prize in 2001. \r\n There is one conflict that, more than most, \r\nrequires the sustained engagement of the international \r\ncommunity at the present time. The direct talks under \r\nway between Israeli and Palestinian leaders present a \r\nhistoric opportunity to make progress towards a just \r\nand lasting peace in the Middle East. I have no doubt \r\nthat progress towards a comprehensive settlement \r\nbased on the two-State solution would contribute more \r\nto improving global security than any other single \r\npeacebuilding effort. \r\n I want to salute the leadership and commitment \r\ndemonstrated by President Obama, Secretary of State \r\nClinton and Special Envoy Mitchell in persuading \r\nIsrael and the Palestinian Authority to resume direct \r\nnegotiations. While there have been many critical \r\njunctures in the Middle East peace process in the past, \r\nthere can be no doubting the significance of the \r\ninitiative which is under way at present. It represents \r\nwhat is possibly the final opportunity to achieve a just \r\nsettlement based on two States living side by side in \r\npeace and security. \r\n President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu \r\nare also to be commended for their personal \r\n A/65/PV.20\r\n \r\n37 10-55128 \r\n \r\ncommitment to this process. I encourage both sides to \r\nstay the course and not to be deterred by those who \r\nseek to derail the process. In particular, I urge all \r\nparties to refrain from any actions which could \r\nendanger the negotiation process. It is vital that every \r\neffort be made to keep the process intact. Our own \r\nexperience in the Northern Ireland peace process has \r\nshown that political progress can only be achieved \r\nthrough dialogue. Maximum restraint for the duration \r\nof these talks, which are intended to be — and should \r\nbe — completed in 12 months, would be a small price \r\nfor lasting peace. In this regard, I echo the statement \r\nmade earlier today by the High Representative of the \r\nEuropean Union (EU), Catherine Ashton, regretting the \r\nIsraeli decision not to extend the moratorium on \r\nsettlements. There could be no greater single \r\nconfidence-building measure and practical \r\ndemonstration of commitment to peace than a decision \r\nto desist from all settlement construction in the West \r\nBank and East Jerusalem. \r\n We must not forget Gaza at this critical time. I \r\nwitnessed for myself the appalling humanitarian plight \r\nof the people of Gaza when I visited the region last \r\nFebruary. Eighty per cent of them live below the \r\npoverty line. The deprivation and hardship that they are \r\nsuffering because of the blockade are painfully \r\nobvious. Yet the people of Gaza show a remarkable \r\ndignity and resilience in the face of living conditions \r\nwhich are quite simply unacceptable. \r\n I welcome the steps taken so far to improve the \r\ndelivery of humanitarian and consumer goods to Gaza. \r\nHowever, the reality remains that much more needs to \r\nbe done in terms of rebuilding Gaza and allowing \r\nnormal commercial activity to resume. In particular, \r\nexports must be allowed to resume from Gaza; the vital \r\nwork of recovery and reconstruction, which has been \r\neffectively on hold for almost two years, must be \r\nfacilitated; and key infrastructural projects identified \r\nby the United Nations must be allowed to proceed. \r\n I would also urge greater support for the \r\ninvaluable work performed by the United Nations \r\nRelief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the \r\nNear East (UNRWA), and its brave and dedicated staff, \r\non behalf of the Palestinian people. I and others who \r\nhave visited Gaza in recent months, such as Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban and European Union High Representative \r\nAshton, can testify to the importance of what UNRWA \r\nis doing to support the welfare of Gaza’s inhabitants \r\nand to provide them with some basis for confidence in \r\na better future. \r\n The lack of progress in resolving the differences \r\nbetween the international community and Iran over that \r\ncountry’s nuclear programme is a source of great \r\nconcern. I urge the Iranian authorities to engage \r\nconstructively on this issue and to comply with the \r\nclear requirements set out in numerous Security \r\nCouncil and International Atomic Energy Agency \r\n(IAEA) resolutions, most recently in Security Council \r\nresolution 1929 (2010). There is a sincere wish on the \r\npart of all of us to negotiate seriously and \r\nconstructively with Iran on these and other important \r\ninternational issues. I look forward to such a dialogue \r\nresuming in the near future. \r\n Any discussion with Iran would also need to \r\ninclude the human rights situation there, about which \r\nthere continue to be the gravest concerns. Iran must do \r\nconsiderably more than it has done up to now to \r\nrespect and fulfil the international obligations it has \r\nundertaken in the field of human rights. Recent cases \r\nof human rights abuses are profoundly disturbing, and \r\nIran must be held fully accountable for them. \r\n The global security which we all wish to achieve \r\ndepends crucially on the eradication of the means of \r\nconflict. Efforts to achieve nuclear disarmament and to \r\nprevent the further proliferation of nuclear weapons \r\nhave been key objectives for the United Nations since \r\nits inception. They have also been a major foreign \r\npolicy priority for successive Irish Governments. \r\nIreland was the first country to sign and ratify the \r\nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The \r\nsuccessful outcome to last May’s NPT Review \r\nConference has reinvigorated the Treaty and is an \r\nimportant milestone on the road towards the eventual \r\nelimination of all nuclear weapons. A key priority for \r\nIreland is implementation of the action plan on nuclear \r\ndisarmament agreed there. \r\n I am pleased that Ireland made an important \r\ncontribution at the Review Conference. In particular, \r\nwe were able to facilitate progress in relation to \r\nimplementation of the 1995 resolution on a zone free \r\nof weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. I \r\nhope that the strong spirit of compromise evident at the \r\nReview Conference will be maintained and built upon \r\nin the preparations for the 2012 conference on the \r\nMiddle East resolution. \r\nA/65/PV.20  \r\n \r\n10-55128 38 \r\n \r\n Ireland is also satisfied with the progress made \r\nover the past couple of years on the issue of cluster \r\nmunitions. The Convention on Cluster Munitions, \r\nwhich was negotiated in Dublin in May 2008, has \r\nentered into force as of 1 August this year. This \r\nlandmark development brings closer the prospect of the \r\nelimination of all cluster munitions and of the \r\nunacceptable harm to civilians they cause. We must \r\nnow move ahead with implementation of the \r\nConvention and promotion of the widest possible \r\nadherence to its provisions. \r\n Ireland is actively supporting preparations for the \r\nfirst meeting of States Parties of the Convention in \r\nVientiane in November. We will continue to show \r\nleadership on this issue and to do all we can to ensure \r\nthe worldwide elimination of these atrocious weapons. \r\n This year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the \r\nfirst deployment of Irish troops under the United \r\nNations flag. In 1960, just five years after we joined \r\nthis Organization, Ireland decided to participate in a \r\npeacekeeping mission to what was then the newly \r\nindependent Congo. This began a long and \r\ndistinguished tradition of service in United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations in a wide variety of conflict \r\nsituations around the globe. We will continue to \r\ncontribute personnel to such missions and to play our \r\npart in the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity. I welcome the constructive discussions which \r\nhave taken place within the Special Committee on \r\nPeacekeeping Operations on ways of improving the \r\nfuture conduct and management of United Nations \r\npeacekeeping missions, following on from Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban’s recent paper on the New Horizon \r\nInitiative. \r\n This year, Ireland was honoured when our \r\nPermanent Representative, Ambassador Anne \r\nAnderson, took on the role of co-facilitator, along with \r\nSouth African and Mexican colleagues, of a major \r\nreview of the United Nations peacebuilding \r\narchitecture. We were very pleased to be able to make \r\nour contribution to this important and wide-ranging \r\nreflection on the work of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, five years after its establishment. The \r\nthree co-facilitators have submitted a report which \r\naims to revitalize the Commission and give it renewed \r\nfocus and impact. I look forward to positive \r\nconsideration by Member States of this report and the \r\nrecommendations it makes. \r\n Ireland has also been active in relation to another \r\nset of issues which have a significant bearing on \r\nconflict resolution and peacebuilding. This year marks \r\nthe tenth anniversary of the adoption of Security \r\nCouncil resolution 1325 (2000), which, for the first \r\ntime, explicitly acknowledged the key role of women \r\nin conflict resolution and peacebuilding. We have been \r\nworking hard to raise international awareness of this \r\nresolution and to encourage greater implementation of \r\nits provisions by Member States. \r\n As part of our focus on resolution 1325 (2000), \r\nwe have been pleased to work with Liberia and Timor-\r\nLeste in conducting important lessons-learned \r\nexercises. A report will be presented to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral shortly on the key findings made in this \r\nprocess. We are also working to finalize our national \r\naction plan on women, peace and security in the very \r\nnear future. \r\n Ireland strongly supports the vital role played by \r\nthe United Nations in upholding and defending human \r\nrights around the world. Next year’s review of the \r\nHuman Rights Council provides an opportunity to \r\nassess the Council’s performance to date and to \r\nconsider how it might be improved and strengthened. \r\nAs a candidate for election in 2012, we look forward to \r\nmaking our own contribution to the work of enhancing \r\nthe Council’s performance. \r\n Ireland is also deeply supportive of the work of \r\nthe International Criminal Court (ICC) and the \r\nInternational Tribunals in promoting justice and \r\ncombating impunity. I welcome the successful outcome \r\nto the recent Kampala Review Conference of the Rome \r\nStatute of the International Criminal Court, including \r\nin relation to defining the crime of aggression, and I \r\nurge the fullest cooperation on the part of all Member \r\nStates with both the ICC and the International \r\nTribunals. \r\n The appalling human tragedy of Darfur continues \r\nto challenge the international community. I applaud the \r\ncourageous efforts of the United Nations personnel and \r\nall of the others on the ground in Darfur who are \r\nworking to provide vital humanitarian services. \r\n We hope that all sides in Sudan will continue to \r\nengage in the fullest cooperation in support of the \r\nUnited Nations/African Union mediation efforts in \r\nDarfur and also in the preparations for the historic \r\nreferendum in southern Sudan early next year. Full \r\nimplementation of the 2005 Comprehensive Peace \r\n A/65/PV.20\r\n \r\n39 10-55128 \r\n \r\nAgreement still remains fundamental to securing peace \r\nand stability in Sudan as a whole and in the region. \r\n The continuing unjust detention of Aung San Suu \r\nKyi in Burma epitomizes the fate of prisoners of \r\nconscience everywhere who seek to uphold the values \r\nof democracy and free speech. I call for her immediate \r\nand unconditional release. I also call for the release of \r\nall other political prisoners in Burma and for the \r\nlaunching of a genuine, inclusive national dialogue. \r\nAnd I very much endorse Secretary-General Ban’s call \r\non Burma’s leaders to create the conditions in which \r\nfree and fair elections can take place. \r\n In a world where we continue to face enormous \r\npeacebuilding challenges, the Northern Ireland peace \r\nprocess is an example of what can be achieved with \r\npatience, imagination and strong international support. \r\nThis year saw a hugely significant step forward in \r\nNorthern Ireland with the devolution of policing and \r\njustice powers to a locally elected Minister accountable \r\nto the Northern Ireland Assembly. That is a major step \r\ntowards fulfilling the vision of the Good Friday \r\nAgreement, which was signed 12 years ago. \r\n That Agreement provides a genuine possibility \r\nfor political inclusion for all who reject violence. It is \r\nthe framework within which the Irish Government, \r\nworking in partnership and full cooperation with the \r\nBritish Government and the Northern Ireland \r\nExecutive, is helping to build economic prosperity, \r\nassist communities to move beyond conflict and sow \r\nthe seeds for a shared future for all. \r\n The European Union and its 27 member States \r\nare firmly committed to effective multilateralism with \r\na strong United Nations at its core. We look forward to \r\nfurther consultations with the Member States of this \r\nOrganization on proposed changes to the status of the \r\nEuropean Union in the General Assembly. These \r\nmodest adjustments will help the Union to make a \r\nmore effective contribution to the work of the \r\nAssembly and of the United Nations. A European \r\nUnion speaking with a clear and coherent voice on the \r\ngreat global challenges that this Organization must \r\naddress will, I believe, strengthen the impact and \r\neffectiveness of the United Nations as a whole. That is \r\nsomething to which Ireland and its EU partners attach \r\nthe utmost importance. \r\n We live in times of profound and unsettling \r\nchange and daunting global challenges. As we struggle \r\nto deal with these challenges and to chart ways forward \r\nin an insecure world, the United Nations is an \r\nincreasingly valuable resource. It remains the \r\ninternational organization with the greatest potential \r\nfor international consensus-building and for the \r\nframing of collective strategies and solutions. At its \r\nheart are the fundamental principles embodied in the \r\nUnited Nations Charter, principles which have \r\nunderpinned the conduct of international relations over \r\nthe past 65 years and whose strength and validity is \r\nmore apparent today than ever before. \r\n Ireland is steadfastly committed to this \r\nOrganization and the principles and values on which it \r\nrests. I very much welcome the General Assembly \r\nPresident’s emphasis on the need for a strong, inclusive \r\nand open United Nations, and we look forward to \r\ntaking part in the consultations which he has indicated \r\nhe will be convening. We look to the United Nations as \r\nthe indispensable forum for developing effective \r\nmultilateralism and for leading international \r\nendeavours towards the creation of a more peaceful, \r\nprosperous and secure world. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Mamadou Tangara, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs, International Cooperation and \r\nGambians Abroad of the Republic of the Gambia. \r\n Mr. Tangara (Gambia): It is indeed a great \r\nhonour and privilege for me to stand here and speak on \r\nbehalf of the Gambia and the President of the Republic \r\nof the Gambia, His Excellency Al Hadji Yahya A. J. J. \r\nJammeh. \r\n First of all, I thank Allah, may He be glorified \r\nand exalted, for the opportunity of this moment, as we \r\ngather here to deliberate on ways to foster peaceful \r\ncooperation and development across the world. On \r\nbehalf of my delegation and the Government and the \r\npeople of the Gambia, I wish to thank the General \r\nAssembly for the warm welcome my delegation and I \r\nhave received since our arrival. I also wish to offer \r\ndeep congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Ali \r\nAbdussalam Treki of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, for \r\nhis courage and for the outstanding and efficient \r\nleadership he demonstrated during the sixty-fourth \r\nsession of the General Assembly. We welcome His \r\nExcellency Mr. Joseph Deiss of Switzerland as  \r\nMr. Treki’s successor as the President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-fifth session. We would assure \r\nMr. Deiss of the Gambia’s support for his presidency. \r\nMy delegation would also like to thank the Secretary-\r\nA/65/PV.20  \r\n \r\n10-55128 40 \r\n \r\nGeneral for his tireless efforts in leading and managing \r\nthe affairs of this highly complex Organization. \r\nFinally, I convey to all participants the good wishes of \r\nthe Government and the people of the Republic of the \r\nGambia. \r\n It is clear that the recent upheavals and crises in \r\nthe global arena have put into sharp focus what the \r\nUnited Nations can and must do as the springboard for \r\ncoordinating global responses and solutions to global \r\nissues. For this reason, the theme that the President has \r\nchosen for the sixty-fifth session of the General \r\nAssembly, namely, “Reaffirming the central role of the \r\nUnited Nations in global governance”, is very apt and \r\ntimely. Any reaffirmation of the pivotal role of the \r\nUnited Nations must start with respect for the purposes \r\nand principles of its Charter. In the same vein, the \r\nOrganization must continue to implement the set of \r\nreforms that were introduced at the 2005 World \r\nSummit and other related United Nations summits and \r\nconferences. Without reform, the United Nations \r\ncannot be of relevance in the twenty-first century. \r\n One of the major reforms that we all agreed on is \r\nthat the size, composition and working methods of the \r\nSecurity Council should be improved. In the absence of \r\naction to implement the reform, the legitimacy of the \r\nactions of that body will be open to question. Africa’s \r\ndemand for greater representation in all categories of \r\nCouncil membership is rooted in the need for justice \r\nand for an end to its marginalization. It is therefore \r\nhigh time to stop consigning Africa to the fate of \r\nsecond-class membership within the United Nations \r\nthrough its perpetual exclusion from the important \r\ndecision-making that takes place in the Security \r\nCouncil. \r\n For many years, I have called for a greater voice \r\nfor developing countries in international and financial \r\neconomic matters, and today I renew that call with a \r\ndeep sense of urgency. As developing countries, we \r\nbelieve that the Economic and Social Council should \r\nbe the leading platform for the discussion and \r\nformulation of global policies in the economic and \r\nsocial fields. \r\n The achievement of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) remains a major priority of my \r\nGovernment. Through various interventions, policies \r\nand programmes, we are poised to achieve and even \r\nsurpass some of the Goals. However, as we run the last \r\nstretch before 2015, the critical need for greater \r\ninternational solidarity and partnership cannot be \r\noveremphasized. I am confident that the Gambia will \r\nattain all the Goals by 2015, as we are already on \r\ncourse to do so. \r\n We should remind ourselves that the United \r\nNations was created to unify the world, and not to \r\ndivide it. The Organization should be seen to provide \r\nthe most potent avenue for allaying fears and restoring \r\nhopes and aspirations, fighting for the rights of \r\noppressed and desperate people the world over, and, \r\nabove all, restraining bullies who seek to skew \r\ninternational politics, growth and development, most \r\noften using might and tyranny as weapons. \r\n International criminal law and its institutions \r\nhave a crucial role to play in global governance and \r\nhence the need to avoid selective prosecution and the \r\npoliticization of court processes. In the world today, \r\nthere is ample evidence to suggest the existence of the \r\nwidespread abuse of power, oppression and violation of \r\nhuman rights through illegitimate wars and other forms \r\nof excessive intervention. There are times when strong \r\nnations attack and trample upon the sovereignty of the \r\nweak, while the United Nations and the world watch \r\nhelplessly, doing nothing, except for a few who raise \r\ntheir voices in isolation. \r\n This will not deter us or discourage us from \r\nhighlighting the injustices that the International \r\nCriminal Court is supposed to set right. If that \r\ninstitution gives way to undue pressure or demonstrates \r\nweakness, its cracks may undermine the credibility of \r\nthe international judicial system. \r\n We know that there are leaders, past and present, \r\nwho deserve to be dragged into the International \r\nCriminal Court for prosecution but they go about their \r\nbusiness as if they were above the law. I ask whether \r\nthis is acceptable. \r\n As a consequence of all this, global governance, \r\nfrom the perspective of the United Nations, has to go \r\nbeyond political systems aimed at exposing and \r\nneutralizing the strategies employed to subdue fragile \r\nStates. Good governance, as the West prefers to refer to \r\nit, needs to permeate the finance structures — of the \r\nWorld Bank and the International Monetary Fund, for \r\nexample — in order to render them more effective in \r\noffsetting the imbalances created through exploitation, \r\ncontrol and protectionism. Indeed, these international \r\nfinancial powerhouses should be transformed into \r\n A/65/PV.20\r\n \r\n41 10-55128 \r\n \r\nconduits for mitigating the effects of \r\nunderdevelopment and poverty the world over. \r\n It is lamentable that the assessment criteria for \r\nproviding assistance to needy people or nations in \r\ndistress are tied to political affiliations cloaked in \r\ninexplicable, good governance issues. \r\n The Security Council has contributed to the \r\nunfair imposition of sanctions that have direct \r\nconsequences for the lives of civilians. Such measures, \r\noften taken to bring down Governments, continue to \r\nexpose this Organization and the ploys it subtly \r\nexecutes at the behest of powerful nations. We \r\ncondemn such sanctions and recommend that thorough \r\nconsultations and sounder procedures precede any \r\nsanctions that may have direct, negative impact on \r\ninnocent lives. \r\n Similarly, we condemn indiscriminate use of \r\nbanned weapons with impunity while the Security \r\nCouncil does nothing to punish the culprits. \r\nCombatants should legitimately engage enemy \r\ncombatants, and reckless attacks on defenceless people \r\nmust not be condoned. \r\n There are regional structures in almost every \r\ncorner of the globe. The United Nations must recognize \r\nthose structures and work closely with them to quell \r\nunrest wherever it erupts. To illustrate this point, let me \r\nobserve that the Economic Community of West African \r\nStates and the African Union (AU) have demonstrated \r\nability, if adequately supported, to handle unrest on the \r\nAfrican continent. I wish to call on the United Nations \r\nto intensify its collaboration with those groupings in \r\ncrucial State and inter-State interventions. \r\n The African Union and the subregional \r\norganizations in Africa have opened up many avenues \r\nfor cooperation with the United Nations, especially in \r\nthe area of preventive diplomacy. We would like to see \r\ngreater support for the activities of the United Nations \r\nOffice for West Africa. \r\n It is an open secret that West Africa is suffering \r\nan onslaught of drug traffickers. We are committed to \r\nthe fight against illegal narcotics, not only in the \r\nGambia, but also in the whole of Africa, as illegal \r\nnarcotics traffickers are holding some West African \r\nStates hostage. \r\n The dangers of narcotics transcend boundaries, as \r\nthey provide a lot of money to dangerous criminals, \r\nincluding terrorists, who have no regard for human life. \r\nGiven the enormous challenges that lie ahead of us in \r\nthis battle, our security forces are alert and ready to \r\ncooperate with our neighbours and all those who share \r\nour concerns. We are determined more than ever to turn \r\nWest Africa into a living hell for terrorists, drug \r\ntraffickers as well as organized criminal gangs and \r\nhuman traffickers. This is a battle we must win, and \r\nwin right. \r\n Let me turn to the phenomenon of Islamophobia. \r\nIt is important to note that the message of Islam is \r\nuniversal peace and progress, love for humanity and \r\ntotal submission to the will of Allah. History teaches us \r\nthat Islamic civilization, which has flourished for 1,400 \r\nyears, has always exhibited its unique capacity for \r\npeaceful coexistence, tolerance and compassion among \r\nglobal religions, manifested in the vast expanse of its \r\ndominions, cutting across parts of Europe, Africa, Asia \r\nand Eastern Europe, among other regions. \r\n Islamic teachings condemn terrorism in all its \r\nmanifestations and view such acts as not only savage \r\nbut also criminal. Islam regards human life as sacred \r\nand condemns the killing of innocents. The world, and \r\nin particular the West, should therefore be wary of the \r\nactions of a small few, including those who abuse the \r\nHoly Koran and even threaten to burn it, thereby \r\nfuelling tensions and insecurity. Their actions \r\nconstitute manipulations to judge Islam and its \r\nfollowers in the wrong way. We must not allow bigots, \r\nracists and evil entities in the West that are \r\nmasquerading as nationalists and far right elements to \r\nspread a global war of religion. If this were to happen, \r\nthe entire human race would suffer. Therefore, Western \r\nGovernments should do more to stop these real \r\nterrorists who are on the rampage. \r\n We maintain that the United Nations should play \r\na lead role in combating terrorism through means \r\napproved by the General Assembly. Noting that \r\nterrorism is a global challenge, no unilateral action \r\nbased on any form of doctrine should be taken by any \r\nnation against another, nor must the United Nations \r\nsuccumb to external pressure from any single nation in \r\npursuit of national gains or interests. Conversely, we \r\nsupport the use of multilateral diplomacy and \r\ncooperation to complement internal measures where a \r\nparticular nation is the target of terrorism. \r\n My delegation’s position on the issues raised in \r\nthis statement is to see to it that the United Nations \r\nreviews its governance structures in order to become \r\nA/65/PV.20  \r\n \r\n10-55128 42 \r\n \r\nmore democratic. This would require that the \r\nrepresentation quotas for various regions, particularly \r\nAfrica and Asia, be redefined on the basis of the \r\nprinciples of fair play and justice, and not on the basis \r\nof sheer economic or military might. \r\n We recommend that the laws and procedures \r\ngoverning the issue of arrest warrants, prosecution \r\nprocedures and legal representation at the International \r\nCriminal Court also be reviewed objectively, in order \r\nto avoid politicization and the selective targeting of \r\nindividuals. \r\n We also urge that all sovereign States that have a \r\nlegitimate Government based on the will and consent \r\nof their people be admitted to the United Nations, and \r\nthis applies in particular to the Republic of China on \r\nTaiwan. We commend the countries on both sides of \r\nthe Strait for their continuous progress in pursuing \r\npeace and shelving disputes over the past two years. \r\nWhile both States deserve special recognition and more \r\nencouragement, the United Nations also needs to be \r\ncognizant of the efforts by Taiwan in this peaceful \r\nprocess. It is important to note that Taiwan’s invitation \r\nto participate in the World Health Assembly as an \r\nobserver in 2009 and 2010 not only enhanced \r\ninternational health and medical care networks, but \r\nalso set a positive example for Taiwan’s participation. \r\nWe therefore urge all Member States to ensure that \r\nother specialized agencies are opened up to Taiwan’s \r\nmeaningful participation in the work of the United \r\nNations. \r\n Taiwan is contributing immensely to the \r\ninternational community through trade, investment, air \r\ntransport, finance, telecommunications technology and \r\nenvironmental protection in the spirit of international \r\ncooperation. Therefore, we call upon the United \r\nNations to find a proper way to accept Taiwan’s \r\nparticipation in all its specialized agencies, notably the \r\nInternational Civil Aviation Organization and the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange. \r\n The international community needs to recognize \r\nthat Taiwan has adopted and pursued a pragmatic, \r\nmoderate and steady foreign policy, and we therefore \r\nencourage United Nations specialized agencies to be \r\nopen-minded with regard to Taiwan’s participation in \r\ntheir activities. It is our collective responsibility to \r\nenable the 23 million people of Taiwan to participate \r\nmore visibly and make them able to function within the \r\ninternational system. \r\n The United States embargo against Cuba is one of \r\nthe longest running political disputes that this \r\nAssembly has needed to address for almost two \r\ndecades. It is embarrassing that such a cruel and \r\noutmoded form of settling scores in international \r\nrelations is still in place. The embargo has no \r\nlegitimacy or appeal, and it is time for those that \r\nimposed it to show genuine leadership by ending it. \r\n It is worth noting that the development of the \r\nAfrican Union has shown that African leadership on \r\nAfrican issues is the key to finding solutions to the \r\nproblems that continue to plague the continent. From \r\nclimate change to the undemocratic change of \r\nGovernments, from peacekeeping to peacemaking, \r\nfrom development to regional integration, Africa has \r\nshown that it is ready to chart its destiny with dignity. \r\nThat is what we are committed to, and all we ask of the \r\ninternational community is fulfilment of the pledges \r\nmade to Africa. We are willing to cooperate with those \r\nthat are willing to do so respecting the dignity of our \r\ncountries, without humiliating conditionalities. \r\n The Gambia’s commitment to peace and stability \r\nacross Africa has been manifested not only in troop \r\ncontributions, but also in our readiness at all times to \r\nfind peaceful solutions to conflicts plaguing the \r\nAfrican continent. We call on the international \r\ncommunity to lend its full support to the efforts of the \r\nAfrican Union and the United Nations to consolidate \r\npeace and stability across the Sudan. \r\n As for Somalia, we recognize the need to \r\nempower the Government of Somalia, so that it can \r\nassert its authority over its territory, achieve lasting \r\npeace and, thus, address the problem of piracy. \r\nSupporting one faction against another is not a worthy \r\nsolution to the Somali problem. \r\n A major development in the evolution of the \r\nUnited Nations this year has been the creation of \r\nUN Women. As a firm believer in gender equality and \r\nwomen’s empowerment, my Government will do all in \r\nits power to support that entity. We wish the new board \r\nwell and urge them to assign centre stage to gender \r\nissues and policies without politics. \r\n Finally, we believe that there is no substitute for \r\nthe United Nations, a body whose role in global \r\ngovernance we consider critical. The missing link has \r\n A/65/PV.20\r\n \r\n43 10-55128 \r\n \r\nbeen the absence of a global governance framework to \r\nembrace universality and representation. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Manuel Salvador dos \r\nRamos, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Cooperation and \r\nCommunities of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome \r\nand Principe. \r\n Mr. Salvador dos Ramos (Sao Tome and \r\nPrincipe) (spoke in Portuguese; English text provided \r\nby the delegation): Allow me to convey to the \r\nPresident and to this noble Assembly the greetings of \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Fradique Bandeira Melo de \r\nMenezes, the President of the Democratic Republic of \r\nSao Tome and Principe, who cannot attend this meeting \r\nfor scheduling reasons. Since this is his last term as \r\nPresident on constitutional grounds, President de \r\nMenezes would have much liked to participate in this \r\nsixty-fifth session in order to personally express his \r\nsincere and heartfelt thanks for the support and \r\ncooperation of our Organization provided to him \r\nduring the period of his presidency. \r\n On behalf of the delegation of the Democratic \r\nRepublic of Sao Tome and Principe, which I have the \r\nhonour to lead, I would like to congratulate the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly on his election to \r\nchair this sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly. \r\nHis election is proof that the Member countries of this \r\nOrganization recognize the contribution that he and his \r\ncountry, Switzerland, have made to the cause of peace \r\nand to upholding the noble ideals of freedom, \r\ndemocracy and human rights in the world. We are \r\ntherefore convinced that he will guide our work with \r\ndexterity, clarity and success. We also congratulate him \r\nfor the relevance of the theme “Reaffirming the central \r\nrole of the United Nations in global governance”, \r\nwhich merits the attention of all present here on \r\naccount of its timeliness. \r\n We salute the very distinguished Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for \r\nthe efforts, dedication and skill with which he has \r\nguided our Organization, despite the enormous \r\npolitical, economic and social challenges that the world \r\nis facing, in particular with regard to the issues of \r\npeace, international security, underdevelopment, \r\nextreme poverty, climate change, food security and the \r\ncontinuation of some regional conflicts. It is our deep \r\nconviction that, in order to collectively face such \r\nchallenges, we must reaffirm and strengthen our \r\nconfidence in the role of the United Nations in \r\npromoting peace and justice in the world. \r\n The defence of multilateralism is of vital \r\nimportance in seeking solutions based on the principles \r\nof the United Nations Charter. The role of the United \r\nNations in preventing and resolving conflicts, \r\npromoting peace and supporting development should \r\nbe bolstered. In that regard, it is vital to strengthen the \r\nrole of the United Nations, including reforming the \r\nsystem and the Security Council, in order to provide \r\nresponses that are more consistent with the challenges \r\nfacing humanity today. \r\n We echo the concerns expressed in this Assembly \r\nHall by the President of Malawi and Chairperson of the \r\nAfrican Union in that regard. The consensus to date on \r\nthe question of Western Sahara leads us to urge the \r\nparties involved to continue on the path of dialogue in \r\npursuit of a peaceful settlement of that conflict. \r\n Our global security is vital to the sustainable \r\ndevelopment of our countries. The international \r\ncommunity must be cautious and aware of the risks \r\nthat the Palestinian conflict could spread and endanger \r\nthe entire Middle East region and ultimately \r\ninternational peace and security in the larger world. \r\n Sao Tome and Principe welcomes the resumption \r\nof the dialogue on the Palestine question and \r\nencourages the Government of the State of Israel and \r\nthe Palestinian Authority to continue on that course in \r\nthe hope that the peoples of Israel and Palestine will \r\nlive side by side in peace in the future. My country \r\nwould also like to acknowledge and welcome the \r\npersonal commitment of President Barack Obama to \r\nfinding a permanent solution to that conflict. \r\n The world faces other risks, such as transnational \r\ncrime, piracy and drug trafficking. For us, a small \r\ncountry surrounded by a vast expanse of sea, that is a \r\nsignificant reason for concern. Sao Tome and Principe \r\nwill therefore continue to pay particular attention to the \r\nregional integration organizations to which we belong, \r\nas well as to give priority to conflict-prevention, -\r\nmanagement and -resolution mechanisms in order to \r\nensure security and peace in Central Africa. \r\n The profound changes taking place in \r\ninternational politics, which are the result of structural \r\nchanges in the global economy and have important \r\ngeopolitical implications, have been affecting Sao \r\nTome and Principe in various ways. As a small island \r\nA/65/PV.20  \r\n \r\n10-55128 44 \r\n \r\nState, Sao Tome and Principe therefore calls for greater \r\naccess to various economic opportunities, in particular \r\nofficial development assistance and international \r\ninvestment. Moreover, we support the conclusion of a \r\nnew international trade agreement on a more equitable \r\nand fairer basis, as well as the conclusion of the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change. \r\n We welcome the appointment of Ms. Michelle \r\nBachelet, former President of Chile, to oversee matters \r\nrelating to women and gender with a view to promoting \r\ntheir participation in global challenges. \r\n At the Millennium Summit in 2000, world leaders \r\ncommitted themselves to creating an environment \r\nconducive to development and the eradication of \r\npoverty, both nationally and internationally. The \r\nadoption of the Millennium Declaration was followed \r\nby other international conferences, which, although \r\nthey reaffirmed the commitment of both the donor \r\ncommunity and the countries receiving aid to seek \r\ninnovative funding sources and alternatives, did not \r\nhave the desired effect of alleviating world poverty \r\nlevels. However, it is vital that we create a new spirit \r\nof partnership and a better concept of cooperation for \r\ndevelopment. To that end, there is a need for additional \r\nefforts in the area of official development assistance. \r\n The High-level Meeting that has just taken place \r\nhere in New York is proof of our concern about the \r\nbenchmarks to be achieved for the attainment of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. For our part, the \r\nresults in the area of education and health are fairly \r\nencouraging, particularly when it comes to reducing \r\nchild mortality and combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and \r\nother diseases. \r\n With regard to education for all, our net enrolment \r\nrate in the first cycle of primary education — for children \r\naged one to four — is estimated at 98 per cent. \r\nLiteracy rates in the 15 to 24 age group are high as \r\ncompared to most African countries, namely, 96 per \r\ncent for females and 95 per cent for males. \r\n The results in reducing child mortality have been \r\nequally encouraging. In 2009, we recorded 38 deaths \r\nper 1,000 live births. That is a significant reduction \r\ncompared with past years. For example, there were 61 \r\nper 1,000 live births in 2002. The mortality rate for \r\nchildren under five fell from 138 to 101 deaths per \r\n1,000 live births in 2002, further dropping to 63 in \r\n2009. The number of children immunized against \r\nmeasles has increased substantially, with 84 per cent \r\nvaccinated in 2009 as compared to 70 per cent in 2000. \r\n With regard to the prevalence of HIV/AIDS, it is \r\nstill contained but can spread rapidly. The prevalence \r\nrate in the 15 to 24 year age range is 0.7 per cent, but \r\namong the total population aged 15 to 49 it is 1.5 per \r\ncent. The prevalence rate of malaria has been reduced \r\ndramatically, from 478 cases per 1,000 inhabitants in \r\n2002 to about 34 cases in 2009. \r\n It is true that our country has made significant \r\nprogress in the areas I have mentioned, but we are \r\naware that much more remains to be done in order to \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals. \r\n Sao Tome and Principe believes that it is our \r\ncollective responsibility to take measures to address \r\nthe adverse effects of climate change, although we \r\nwelcome the political willingness of Member States to \r\ncontinue the process of building the necessary \r\nconsensus on the various themes discussed at the \r\nCopenhagen Summit. We recognize the efforts made at \r\nthe recent meeting held in Bonn, as well as the \r\nprospects for the opening meeting to be held in \r\nMexico.  \r\n Sao Tome and Principe expresses its concern at \r\nattempts to use nuclear energy for non-peaceful \r\npurposes. We hope that those who utilize nuclear \r\nenergy do so in accordance with existing mechanisms \r\nfor international regulation and supervision. \r\n Climate change has caused imbalances in the \r\nmicroclimate of our country, with dramatic impact on \r\nour domestic production. That poses a threat to the \r\nfood security of Sao Tome and Principe. The \r\nauthorities of my country would therefore like to \r\ncontinue to count on the invaluable support and \r\nwillingness so far expressed by the international \r\ncommunity, in general, and in particular by specialized \r\nbodies of the United Nations. \r\n I would be remiss if I concluded my statement \r\nwithout addressing the situation along the Taiwan \r\nStrait. We recognize the efforts made by both sides \r\nalong the Strait aimed at reducing political tension and \r\ncreating a favourable climate that is conducive to \r\npeace, security and development in the region. Despite \r\nthose positive developments — including the signing \r\nof an economic treaty regulating trade relations \r\nbetween the two sides, opening up airspace to \r\ncommercial traffic and promoting stronger links \r\n A/65/PV.20\r\n \r\n45 10-55128 \r\n \r\nbetween the two peoples — there are still some aspects \r\nthat must be addressed in order to allow greater \r\ninvolvement by Taiwan in the international community. \r\n We call on Members of the United Nations, and \r\nin particular its specialized agencies, to find ways to \r\nmake possible Taiwan’s greater participation in \r\nspecialized agencies and other bodies and machinery, \r\nsuch as the International Civil Aviation Organization \r\nand the United Nations Framework Convention on \r\nClimate Change. We believe that Taiwan’s participation \r\nin those two forums will strengthen both those \r\nmechanisms and better serve our common interests. \r\n In consolidating its democratic process, the \r\nDemocratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe has \r\njust conducted yet another elections process, from \r\nwhich a new Government and Assembly have emerged. \r\nThe new Government, whose programme has just been \r\napproved by the National Assembly, has identified four \r\nkey areas for attention, namely, good governance, \r\ncredibility and combating corruption; economic \r\ngrowth; national cohesion and organization; and State \r\nauthority. To achieve those objectives, the Government \r\nof Sao Tome and Principe would very much like to \r\ncount on the continued support of the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n We believe that the international community, and \r\nin particular the United Nations system, knows how to \r\nrespond to the new challenges of a changing world by \r\nseeking out mechanisms, instruments and policies \r\naimed at promoting international cooperation, \r\ninnovative partnerships and international solidarity. In \r\nthat collective effort, I want to reaffirm that Sao Tome \r\nand Principe is ready and willing to make its \r\ncontribution to the realization of the noble principles \r\nand objectives that were at the heart of the creation of \r\nthe United Nations. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency General Antoine \r\nGambi, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Regional \r\nIntegration, and of the Francophonie of the Central \r\nAfrican Republic. \r\n Mr. Gambi (Central African Republic) (spoke in \r\nFrench): The Central African Republic would like, \r\nthrough me, to commend Mr. Joseph Deiss on his \r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-fifth session. We congratulate him and offer \r\nhim our support in fulfilling his great responsibility. \r\nHis predecessor, Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki of the \r\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya, also deserves our heartfelt \r\ncommendation and gratitude for the outstanding \r\ncontribution he made during his term of office in \r\nrevitalizing the General Assembly. Lastly, on behalf of \r\nHis Excellency Army General François Bozizé, \r\nPresident and Head of State of our country, allow me to \r\nconvey our sincere congratulations to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon, who has been tireless in \r\ncarrying out his extremely important role to promote \r\nthe ideals of the Organization. \r\n The sixty-fifth session is taking place at a time \r\nwhen the world faces many challenges. In addition to \r\nthe armed conflicts that affect almost every continent, \r\nthere are also the food, energy and financial crises, \r\nwhich have made the lives of the most vulnerable \r\npeople increasingly precarious. There are also \r\nchallenges when it comes to respect for human rights, \r\nthe rule of law and good governance, which are the \r\nfoundations of lasting peace and security and a healthy \r\nenvironment. Today, we are aware that systematic \r\nviolations of human rights and the glaring absence of \r\nthe rule of law are often the root causes of conflicts \r\nand other social crises. States and non-State actors \r\nconfront each other. Warlords, terrorists and criminal \r\ngangs dictate their own rules. Civilians, rather than \r\nsoldiers, become the first targets. Security policy can \r\nno longer be confined to the traditional framework of \r\nthe State; it must be focused first and foremost on the \r\nsecurity of individuals. \r\n As the President rightly said in his opening \r\nspeech to this session of the General Assembly by way \r\nof referring to the special theme for the sixty-fifth \r\nsession, “we must reinstate the United Nations and the \r\nGeneral Assembly at the centre of global governance. \r\nThe challenges we face today have acquired a global \r\ndimension and require global solutions.” (A/65/PV.1)  \r\n The Central African Republic continues to \r\nbelieve that preventing and peacefully resolving \r\nconflicts are the best way to maintain international \r\npeace and security. Many other challenges also require \r\nthe attention of the international community. We \r\nshould provide responses tailored to those challenges \r\nin order that together we can build a better world, \r\nstarting with the issue of climate change. \r\n Today more than ever before, the survival of the \r\nplanet is threatened by changes to the climate that have \r\na serious impact on living conditions in developing \r\ncountries — owing mainly to desertification, the silting \r\nA/65/PV.20  \r\n \r\n10-55128 46 \r\n \r\nup of rivers, ecosystem deterioration, shortened winters \r\nand floods. Faced with that danger, it is not a matter of \r\nraising questions about respective responsibilities; we \r\nmust rather, first and foremost, put in place suitable \r\nemergency measures to confront the challenge. \r\n In that connection, the outcomes of the Bali \r\nConference are as relevant as ever and they should be \r\nimplemented. Although, unfortunately, the Copenhagen \r\nsummit was the scene of selfishness and inconsistency \r\non the part of States vis-à-vis international cooperation \r\nand climate policy, we hope that the upcoming meeting \r\nat Cancún, Mexico, will find appropriate answers to \r\nthose worrying issues. \r\n The HIV/AIDS and malaria pandemics are \r\nanother challenge to which we must give particular \r\nattention, as they pose a serious threat to the survival \r\nof humankind, in particular on the African continent. \r\nWith regard to HIV/AIDS, we must truly redouble our \r\nefforts and determination to implement the 2001 \r\nDeclaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS and the \r\noutcomes of the high-level meetings on AIDS. Child \r\nand maternal mortality rates in Africa, whose increase \r\nis yet another cause for concern, should also enjoy the \r\nsame attention as the other issues. All of those \r\nmeetings have emphasized the gravity of the situation, \r\nunderscoring the importance of acting and the need to \r\nmobilize resources accordingly to fight those health \r\nthreats. \r\n Achieving Millennium Development Goal 1 on \r\ntime — namely, reducing by half the number of people \r\nwho suffer from hunger by 2015 — compels us to put \r\nin place a new approach and policy towards \r\ninternational cooperation that is based on support for \r\nagriculture, rather than on providing food assistance, \r\nwhich should only be provided in exceptional \r\ncircumstances, and then in a timely manner. \r\n Developing agriculture in Africa so that it \r\nprovides for lasting food security also necessarily \r\nentails controlling water, the availability of equipment, \r\naccess to raw materials for producers and proper \r\norganization of the means of producing, storing, \r\ntransforming and marketing agricultural products. The \r\nCentral African Republic, a country endowed with \r\nabundant natural resources, would easily be able to \r\ntake its place as an agricultural country, were it not for \r\nthe handicaps it faces owing to its landlocked status \r\nand the scarcity of means at its disposal. \r\n Agriculture in my country is essentially a \r\nsubsistence affair that performs poorly despite the \r\ncountry’s enormous potential. That includes 15 million \r\narable hectares, of which only 600,000 are cultivated \r\nannually, as well as 16 million hectares of range land \r\nfor a herd of 2 million animals. We also have at our \r\ndisposal a vast network of rivers and streams, as well \r\nas abundant rainfall amounting to 1,200 to 1,800 \r\nmillimetres per year. Agriculture employs more than 75 \r\nper cent of working people in our country, contributing \r\nabout 53 per cent of our gross domestic product. \r\n In the Central African Republic, about 72 per cent \r\nof the poor and hungry live in rural areas, where \r\nagriculture plays a crucial role, feeding communities \r\nbut providing employment that offers only meagre \r\nincomes. Nevertheless, in spite of the enormity of the \r\nneed and the growing food insecurity, assistance to \r\nagriculture continues to decrease, having dropped \r\nsignificantly in the past 20 years. \r\n The Central African Republic has maintained the \r\nstrengthening of human capital as one of its priorities \r\nunder the fourth pillar of its national poverty-reduction \r\nstrategy. Under that pillar, education, health and \r\nemployment are considered priority sectors, in line \r\nwith the Millennium Development Goals. Assessments \r\nof the programmes that have been launched seem to \r\nreveal shortcomings in the results. For instance, adult \r\nliteracy rates are poor, at 57 per cent, while the overall \r\nprimary school attendance rate is also low, at 55 per \r\ncent. \r\n The Central African Republic is among the \r\ncountries of the world most affected by the HIV/AIDS \r\npandemic, even though we are continuing efforts to \r\nbring its prevalence under control. \r\n Given those outcomes, it is clear that, if our \r\ncountry is to pursue the implementation of the \r\npriorities of our development plan, we need significant \r\nsupport from our development partners. \r\n With regard to nuclear disarmament, the \r\nproliferation crisis we are experiencing constitutes the \r\ngreatest threat to international peace and security \r\ntoday. Nuclear disarmament and nuclear proliferation \r\nin all their aspects should be at the centre of our \r\ndebate. We should resolve to prioritize the use of \r\nnuclear energy for peaceful civilian purposes. \r\n Today more than ever before, the \r\ninterconnectedness of the crises faced by the \r\n A/65/PV.20\r\n \r\n47 10-55128 \r\n \r\ninternational community underscores the need to inject \r\nnew impetus into efforts to achieve international peace \r\nand security, including collective efforts at the \r\ninternational level. \r\n With regard to reforming the United Nations \r\nsystem, the Central African Republic shares the view \r\nthat the current system no longer reflects the ambitions \r\nof the founders. Our country therefore once again calls \r\nfor full representation for Africa in the system’s \r\ndecision-making bodies, in particular the Security \r\nCouncil. Whatever the outcome of the ongoing \r\nnegotiations on this matter, my delegation continues to \r\nbelieve that any viable reform of the Security Council \r\nmust take into account Africa’s numerical and political \r\nsignificance in the General Assembly, especially given \r\nthe two types of situations considered by the Council. \r\n The Central African Republic held elections in \r\n2005, which were heralded by the international \r\ncommunity for having met all the necessary standards. \r\nIt should be pointed out that those held in 2010 \r\nexperienced various difficulties that need to be \r\nexamined. Therefore, on the basis of a political \r\nconsensus, the National Assembly adopted a law based \r\non a constitutional court opinion. This constitutional \r\narrangement extends the term of office of our country’s \r\nPresident, as well as those of members of the \r\nAssembly, until the holding of elections, now set for  \r\n23 January 2011. \r\n In another area, the programme for the \r\ndisarmament, demobilization and reintegration of \r\nformer combatants has made considerable progress in \r\nthe central and north-western parts of our country. \r\nNevertheless, the Central African Republic continues \r\nto face security problems in the north-east of the \r\ncountry, as a result of the consequences of the conflict \r\nin Darfur, as well as in the south-east, owing to the \r\nraging Ugandan rebellion by the Lord’s Resistance \r\nArmy (LRA). \r\n This alarming situation has resulted in a growing \r\nnumber of refugees and internally displaced persons \r\nfrom various areas, who have fled to the cities from the \r\nfighting. Having been pushed out of Uganda, LRA \r\nrebels have regrouped in the south-east of our country, \r\nwhere they carry out all sorts of violence and spread \r\nterror among the people. It is important to point out \r\nthat the Central African Republic does not have any \r\nborders with Uganda. \r\n The Central African Republic therefore welcomes \r\nthe decision by the United States Government with \r\nregard to disarming the LRA. Nevertheless, we hope \r\nthat the United States Administration will focus in \r\nparticular on the case of the Central African Republic, \r\nwhich is a post-conflict country that still needs United \r\nStates assistance, given the danger posed by the LRA \r\non the ground in our country and the disastrous social \r\nconsequences it has already had. \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n The United Nations Mission in the Central \r\nAfrican Republic and Chad, whose mandate will expire \r\non 31 December 2010, requires particular attention. \r\nThe Central African Republic’s defence and security \r\nforces will take over from international forces in order \r\nto ensure the continuity of operations. However, they \r\nare in desperate need of military equipment and \r\nsupplies. The Government of the Central African \r\nRepublic therefore appeals to the international \r\ncommunity for assistance in strengthening the \r\noperational capacities of our armed forces. \r\n I cannot conclude without once again thanking all \r\nthose whose commitment, courage and determination \r\ncontinue to be of assistance in helping my country to \r\nemerge from crisis to lasting peace and development. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Royal Highness Prince Mohamed Bolkiah, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of Brunei \r\nDarussalam. \r\n Prince Mohamed Bolkiah (Brunei Darussalam): \r\nI would like to congratulate you, Mr. President, on \r\nyour election. I also thank Mr. Treki, the outgoing \r\nPresident, for his strong leadership in support of \r\nUnited Nations reform. \r\n I would also like to express our great sympathy to \r\nthe Government and people of Pakistan and to our \r\nfellow United Nations Members whose people have \r\nsuffered the terrible effects of natural disasters over the \r\npast year. I also thank the Secretary-General and his \r\nstaff for coordinating international relief efforts. \r\n We have had a long week of formal meetings and \r\nsideline discussions, and there is still much more to be \r\ndone before we all go home. So, at this time, I would \r\nlike to be brief and offer a statement of support for \r\nwhat our people regard as the most important aspect of \r\nthe work of the United Nations. By this I mean the \r\nwork of our United Nations agencies, their experts, \r\nA/65/PV.20  \r\n \r\n10-55128 48 \r\n \r\ntheir advisers and above all their volunteers in the \r\nfield. \r\n I think the theme for this year’s debate underlines \r\nthe importance of their work. It asks us to recognize \r\nthe central role of the United Nations in global \r\ngovernance and I have no difficulty in doing this. \r\nAchieving security, progress and development is, of \r\ncourse, our own individual responsibility. But as last \r\nweek’s high-level discussions on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals made extremely clear, many of the \r\nchallenges we face reach beyond single nations and \r\neven single regions. They are international in the full \r\nsense of the word. \r\n So we need help, experience and expertise and \r\nfor me, this is what the United Nations agencies offer. \r\nAs we all know, their support continues all year, every \r\nyear. In my own country it is taking place right now as \r\nwe speak, through the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme, the United Nations Environment \r\nProgramme, UNESCO, UNICEF and the World Health \r\nOrganization and we are most grateful for their help. \r\nThey work in vital areas of national development, \r\neducation, health, agriculture, communications and \r\ninfrastructure. They meet with people directly, they \r\nlisten, they discuss, and they teach, train and \r\nencourage. They work closely with our local \r\nauthorities and sometimes they do even more than that. \r\n I think that we learned this during last year’s \r\ninfluenza A (H1N1) health crisis. As the Assembly can \r\nimagine, for a small nation like ours this was very \r\nserious indeed. It could have almost closed us down \r\nand could have certainly caused widespread panic. But \r\nit did not. I think this was very largely due to one fact: \r\nour people knew that they were not alone. They had the \r\nguidelines given to us by the World Health \r\nOrganization and this gave them the confidence they \r\nneeded during that extremely worrying time; we could \r\nnot have made it without them. \r\n Returning to our theme this year: it invites us to \r\nreaffirm and, as I have said, I am happy to do this and I \r\ndo it without reservation. I reaffirm our respect and \r\ndeep appreciation for the work of all United Nations \r\nagencies. We are delighted to be working with them \r\nand we warmly congratulate the Secretary-General on \r\ntheir work. \r\n In the words of our theme, the United Nations \r\ndoes indeed play a central role. In my view, without its \r\nagencies the concept of global governance can only be, \r\nat best, an idea and, most of the time, only words. It is \r\nthe agencies that help us turn ideas into real substance \r\nand to change words into actions that our people \r\nunderstand, respect and welcome. \r\n In fact, I would like to end by saying that they are \r\nmuch more than agencies. For countries such as ours, \r\nthey can help us to become far more than small \r\ndeveloping nations. I think this can be summed up \r\nsimply: they make us part of a United Nations that is \r\ntruly united. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Oldemiro Marques Balói, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the Republic of \r\nMozambique. \r\n Mr. Balói (Mozambique): Mozambique \r\nassociates itself with previous speakers in \r\ncongratulating you, Sir, on your unanimous election to \r\npreside over the sixty-fifth session of the United \r\nNations General Assembly. Indeed we feel confident \r\nthat your wisdom and diligence will provide positive \r\nleadership and success for our deliberations. We \r\nreaffirm our commitment to support your presidency \r\nand pledge to fully cooperate with you and all the other \r\nmembers of the Bureau in the discharge of your noble \r\nmission. \r\n We wish to express our gratitude to your \r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki \r\nof the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, for his commitment to \r\nour Organization and for his strong leadership in \r\ncarrying out the work of the United Nations, both \r\nproductively and effectively during the previous \r\nGeneral Assembly session. \r\n Equally, I would like to commend the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Ban Ki-moon, for his engagement in \r\npromoting peace and justice and, in particular, for his \r\ntireless efforts to mobilize the United Nations family to \r\nadequately address the global challenges facing the \r\nworld and humanity through concerted multilateral \r\napproaches. \r\n Recognizing the steering role of the United \r\nNations in global governance and highly appreciating \r\nthe wise choice of reflecting this important and timely \r\nitem during the present debate, I request your \r\nindulgence to seize this opportunity to share some \r\ninformation about developments in Mozambique. As \r\nwe move steadily towards strengthening the democratic \r\ninstitutions in Mozambique, we are proud to see that \r\n A/65/PV.20\r\n \r\n49 10-55128 \r\n \r\nthere have been significant achievements in both the \r\npolitical and the socio-economic spheres of the \r\ncountry. \r\n Indeed, thanks to the strengthened political \r\nstability that Mozambique currently enjoys, the \r\nGovernment is undertaking a comprehensive public \r\nsector reform and decentralization process in the area \r\nof public administration. Similarly, political and social \r\nstability and good macroeconomic management, \r\nsupplemented by the attractive investment legislation \r\nalready in place, have contributed immensely to \r\ncreating conditions conducive to promoting economic \r\ngrowth and sustainable development. \r\n Our main goal is to eradicate poverty, as it is one \r\nof the major challenges facing our people in their \r\nefforts to improve their living conditions. We are fully \r\naware that in fighting poverty we need also to \r\nsimultaneously address other related challenges, \r\nnamely, climate change, the energy crisis, food \r\ninsecurity and the global economic and financial crisis, \r\nwhose impacts constitute an enduring challenge, \r\nespecially for developing economies such as that of \r\nMozambique. All those challenges are interrelated and \r\nhave multiplier effects on our competitiveness and \r\ngrowth efforts. \r\n The threats posed by the negative impact of \r\nclimate change on our environment need to be \r\ncontinuously dealt with as a priority and should be \r\ncomprehensively addressed at the national, \r\nsubregional, regional and international levels. The \r\ndevastation due to problems originating in climate \r\nchange is degrading our environment at an astonishing \r\npace. In fact, Mozambique and many other countries in \r\nsub-Saharan Africa are being ravaged by cyclical \r\nnatural disasters that destroy major arable lands and \r\nthus reduce land productivity. \r\n There is no doubt that small island developing \r\ncountries face the risk of disappearing from the world \r\nmap. At the same time, it is also important to recognize \r\nthe plight of coastal developing countries like \r\nMozambique, which are suffering from the rise in sea \r\nlevels. \r\n The heavy burden resulting from the adverse \r\neffects of climate change constrains the ability of our \r\nGovernments to allocate the necessary financial and \r\nhuman resources to decisively address problems related \r\nto the environment. Hence, developing countries, \r\nparticularly sub-Saharan countries, do not have the \r\nrequired financial resources to undertake the necessary \r\nsteps to mitigate the impact of climate change. To that \r\nend, we are committed to continue working in a \r\nconcerted manner with international development \r\npartners, especially the United Nations and other \r\nstakeholders with a focus on creating conditions for \r\nadaptation and local community resilience to the \r\nimpact of climate change. \r\n Bearing in mind the principle of common but \r\ndifferentiated responsibility, we would like to underline \r\nthat our association with the Copenhagen Accord on \r\nclimate change is based precisely on our understanding \r\nthat the global nature of climate change demands a true \r\nmultilateral response. In that regard, we look forward \r\nto a successful outcome of the sixteenth Conference of \r\nthe Parties to the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change — COP 16 — to be \r\nheld in Cancún later this year. We commend the active \r\nrole of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to \r\nensure a meaningful result of the climate change \r\nnegotiations. \r\n In addressing all the aforementioned challenges, \r\nstrong and able global governance is of utmost \r\nimportance to ensure the spurring of the political will \r\nneeded for concrete actions. The United Nations is the \r\nonly intergovernmental organization with a universal \r\ncharacter and the ability to mobilize such a capacity. \r\nThat is why we believe that concrete steps to \r\nstrengthen the central role of the United Nations in \r\nglobal governance are required, through providing it \r\nwith the adequate resources and authority \r\ncommensurate with its global responsibility to fully \r\nrespond to the growing global needs. \r\n Mozambique will remain engaged in the ongoing \r\nprocess of reforming the United Nations to ensure its \r\nefficiency and effectiveness, to increase its credibility \r\nand legitimacy as a representative of the people of the \r\nworld. \r\n In that regard, the revitalization of the role and \r\nthe authority of the General Assembly as the most \r\nrepresentative and legitimate organ of the United \r\nNations cannot be overemphasized. It is here where \r\neveryone is represented and every vote counts in deciding \r\non matters of common interest. So it is here where all the \r\nmost important decisions should be taken — from issues \r\nrelated to the maintenance of peace and security, the \r\npromotion of economic cooperation and social and \r\nhumanitarian matters to the promotion of human rights. \r\nA/65/PV.20  \r\n \r\n10-55128 50 \r\n \r\nEveryone should abide by and implement all decisions \r\nand resolutions taken here. Therefore, we need a strong \r\nGeneral Assembly, well resourced and with the \r\nnecessary authority to assume its responsibilities on \r\nbehalf of the international community. \r\n Another important track of reform that we are \r\nvery much attached to is the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil. Although there is no agreement yet on the \r\nlevel of attainment, we all agree that reform of the \r\nCouncil should be a priority in the whole United \r\nNations reform process. It is clear that we need a more \r\nbalanced representation in the Council. Moreover, we \r\nare of the view that a Council that is more fair and \r\ndemocratic in its decisions and actions would \r\nadequately meet the security necessities of the \r\ninternational community. \r\n For a meaningful reform of the Security Council, \r\nit is imperative that the historic injustice with regard to \r\nthe African continent be corrected. Indeed, today it is \r\nno longer acceptable that a continent that represents \r\nalmost 30 per cent of the whole United Nations \r\nmembership and whose concerns constitute more than \r\n60 per cent of the Council’s agenda is not represented \r\nin the category of permanent member. In that light, \r\nAfrica deserves to be allocated permanent seats in any \r\nSecurity Council reform, based on the Ezulwini \r\nConsensus. \r\n There is also a need for a more coherent and \r\neffective United Nations system, capable of efficiently \r\naddressing and advancing durable solutions for the \r\npressing economic, social and humanitarian problems \r\ncurrently facing the world. Member States should also \r\ncontinue to discuss and find measurable solutions on \r\nhow to ensure coherence between policy decisions and \r\nthe implementation of commitments agreed in United \r\nNations international conferences and summits in the \r\nfield of development. \r\n In that regard, Mozambique is proud of the \r\nprogress made by the General Assembly on system-\r\nwide coherence. In particular, we commend the \r\nAssembly for its recent major step in the establishment \r\nof UN Women. I seize this opportunity to reiterate our \r\ncongratulations to Her Excellency Ms. Michelle \r\nBachelet on her appointment as Under-Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the new entity and pledge our full support \r\nfor and readiness to collaborate on the successful \r\naccomplishment of the task of bringing gender equality \r\nand the empowerment of women to the forefront of the \r\nUnited Nations work. \r\n It is also a fact that, although we are open to \r\nseeing the result of the independent evaluation of the \r\nOne United Nations pilot country initiative, it is our \r\nstrong belief that the progress made so far in the \r\nimplementation of that initiative is extremely \r\nencouraging. Therefore we call on the United Nations \r\nto support all countries that voluntarily decide to \r\nembark on the process of making the United Nations \r\nsystem work in a more coherent manner at the country \r\nlevel. \r\n With regard to the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security, Mozambique is committed to \r\ncontinuing to share its experience in the peaceful \r\nresolution of conflicts, particularly in southern Africa. \r\nIn our subregion, we share important responsibilities in \r\nthe promotion of peace and security, as well as with \r\nregard to regional integration as part of subregional \r\nand regional efforts to promote international peace and \r\nsecurity and sustainable development. \r\n We advocate international peace and security \r\nbecause we truly believe that they are part of the \r\nenabling conditions that allow countries to concentrate \r\ntheir attention on dealing with other pressing needs, \r\nsuch as the fight against HIV/AIDS, malaria and other \r\ndiseases, the fight against international crime and drug \r\ntrafficking, addressing poverty-related problems and \r\nthe promotion of sustainable development. \r\n It is worth noting that the political situation and \r\nstability in Southern Africa have improved. Indeed, the \r\nprocess of implementing the Global Political \r\nAgreement in Zimbabwe has made significant strides. \r\nWe also remain committed, under the auspices of the \r\nSouthern African Development Community, to finding \r\na peaceful and lasting solution to the conflict in \r\nMadagascar. \r\n We are encouraged by the progress being made in \r\nstabilizing the political situation in Guinea-Bissau, \r\nespecially the ongoing reform of the armed forces and \r\nthe public administration. I take this opportunity to call \r\non the international community to continue supporting \r\nthe ongoing efforts of the Community of Portuguese-\r\nspeaking Countries and of the United Nations to find a \r\nsustainable and lasting peace in that sister country. \r\n Mozambique reiterates its support for the efforts \r\nof the international community to find a lasting \r\n A/65/PV.20\r\n \r\n51 10-55128 \r\n \r\nsolution to the problem of Western Sahara, and for the \r\nright of that country’s people to self-determination. \r\n Mozambique is concerned that despite all \r\ncontinued international efforts, it has not been possible \r\nto bring about peace and stability in the Middle East. \r\nMozambique is deeply concerned about the volatile \r\nsituation in that region, where the conflict between \r\nIsrael and Palestine continues to deprive the \r\nPalestinian people of the realization of their \r\nfundamental human rights, including the right to their \r\nown land and resources and to live in peace with all \r\nneighbouring countries, including, obviously, Israel. \r\n We need a strong United Nations that can play a \r\ncentral role in mobilizing Member States and the \r\ninternational community at large to commit and fully \r\ncontribute to regional and international peace and \r\nsecurity and to an enabling environment for the \r\npromotion of sustainable development. \r\n That is why we believe in multilateralism. We \r\nreiterate our commitment to work in collaboration with \r\nall States Members of the Organization in the pursuit \r\nof our common goals to make the world a better place \r\nfor all humanity. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Bhim Bahadur Rawal, Minister for \r\nHome Affairs of the Federal Democratic Republic of \r\nNepal. \r\n Mr. Rawal (Nepal): I wish to extend our sincere \r\ncongratulations to you, Sir, on your election as the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth \r\nsession. I also thank the President at the sixty-fourth \r\nsession for his excellent stewardship of that session. \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of \r\nthe United Nations, deserves our sincere appreciation \r\nfor his commitment and dedication. \r\n The message of the High-level Plenary Meeting \r\nof last week is still reverberating around this \r\nAssembly: the continuing poverty and hunger in \r\ntoday’s world, where we have made great strides in all \r\nour endeavours, is unacceptable and must be brought to \r\nan end without delay. It is quite disheartening to note \r\nthat the number of poor has surpassed one billion and \r\nthat they are concentrated in certain regions and groups \r\nof countries, mostly in least developed countries \r\n(LDCs). \r\n The commitments expressed by the leaders \r\nattending the High-level Plenary Meeting last week \r\nrekindled our hope that it will be a different world in \r\n2015. Otherwise, the Millennium Declaration \r\n(resolution 55/2) and many other vital documents will \r\nremain only a compilation of lofty promises. Let us \r\nhope that we match our commitments with our deeds. \r\n International peace and security are our shared \r\ndesire and a common responsibility. The challenges are \r\nmultiple and complex. In an ever-changing world, the \r\nsources and the threats are varied, and so are the \r\nactors. Political and social conflicts have been \r\naggravated by abject poverty and disparity. Therefore, \r\nthe stabilization of global peace and security also \r\ndemands ensuring freedom from want and hunger as a \r\nbasic human right and enabling people to realize their \r\nfull human potential. Thus we believe that \r\ndevelopment, peace and security are inextricably \r\nlinked with one other. \r\n Nepal has consistently and unequivocally called \r\nfor general and complete disarmament of all weapons \r\nof mass destruction, under effective international \r\ncontrol. Nepal stands for the complete elimination of \r\nnuclear weapons in a time-bound manner. The \r\noperationalization of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\r\nBan Treaty and the early conclusion of a fissile \r\nmaterials cut-off treaty should be our priority. We \r\nsupport efforts for the non-proliferation of small arms \r\nand light weapons. \r\n We welcome the signing in April this year of the \r\nNew START treaty between the United States and the \r\nRussian Federation on strategic offensive arms. We \r\nwelcome the successful outcome of the 2010 Review \r\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the  \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. However, we \r\ncall for reinvigorating the Conference on Disarmament \r\nas a multilateral body, to start discussions on \r\nsubstantive issues. We also appreciate the efforts of the \r\nSecretary-General to advance nuclear disarmament on \r\nthe basis of the five-point action plan he has proposed. \r\n Nepal strongly believes that regional mechanisms \r\ncomplement efforts to promote the global disarmament \r\nagenda. The United Nations Regional Centre for Peace \r\nand Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific, which we are \r\nproud to host, must be strengthened in order to \r\nrevitalize the Kathmandu process to facilitate dialogue \r\nand deliberations on confidence-building in the region. \r\n In today’s world, devastating conflicts are a \r\nconstant threat to international security. Despite \r\nprogress on many fronts, violence and civil wars \r\nA/65/PV.20  \r\n \r\n10-55128 52 \r\n \r\ncontinue unabated. It is a matter of concern that \r\nintra-State conflicts and extremism have steadily \r\ngrown over the years. We should work collectively. In \r\naccordance with the principles and Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, we should all contribute to resolving \r\nsuch conflicts through peaceful means and should help \r\nstabilize situations through peacebuilding efforts. \r\n In the Middle East, we are encouraged by the \r\nrecent direct dialogue between the Israelis and the \r\nPalestinians. We look forward to the success of the \r\ndialogue leading towards an independent Palestinian \r\nState alongside a secure Israel. We would like to see a \r\npeaceful resolution to disputes in the Korean peninsula \r\nthrough dialogue. \r\n Terrorism is a threat to all and knows no \r\ngeographical boundary. We unequivocally condemn \r\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations and call \r\nfor resolute international actions to fight it. Nepal has \r\nbeen implementing the United Nations Global Counter-\r\nTerrorism Strategy and is party to the South Asian \r\nAssociation for Regional Cooperation Regional \r\nConvention on Suppression of Terrorism of 1987 and \r\nits Additional Protocol. \r\n Legitimacy, universality and common ideals have \r\nbeen the defining features of the United Nations. \r\nContinued adherence to its core principles and \r\npurposes will reinforce sovereign equality, territorial \r\nintegrity, non-interference and the peaceful settlement \r\nof disputes. The inspiring values and the lofty ideals \r\nthat underpin the United Nations Charter remain as \r\nrelevant as ever. \r\n We live in an era of continuous change. The \r\neconomic landscape is also changing with the \r\nemergence of new, yet vibrant, poles of growth. \r\nGlobalization has changed the pattern of economic \r\nrelations, although its benefits are not widely and \r\nequitably distributed. \r\n The effectiveness of the United Nations depends \r\non our collective will to act and to deal with global \r\nissues resolutely. In the face of new and emerging \r\nchallenges, it is urgent that the ideals of the United \r\nNations be translated into action effectively and in a \r\ncoherent manner. The theme of this year’s general \r\ndebate — “Reaffirming the central role of the United \r\nNations in global governance” — captures that \r\nessence. \r\n We underline the centrality of the United Nations \r\nnot only in maintaining peace and security, but also in \r\npromoting international cooperation for development. \r\nIts role in shaping policy debate on and establishing \r\nglobal norms for economic and financial matters must \r\nnot be sidelined. The reform agenda needs to strike the \r\nright balance to promote stability in the broadest sense. \r\nJust as security and peace are critical for the \r\ninternational community, so is the development \r\nagenda. It must be given a focused priority within the \r\nUnited Nations system. \r\n United Nations reform should be pursued in a \r\nsystematic and holistic manner to further enhance the \r\nOrganization’s global standing.  \r\n The realities of the contemporary world call for a \r\nchange in the composition and working methods of the \r\nSecurity Council. We support the expansion of \r\nmembership in the Council in both categories to reflect \r\nthe current realities of the world. We also call for \r\ntransparency in its working methods. We welcome \r\nrecent efforts to structure the debates with a view to \r\nstarting negotiations by taking into account the views \r\nof all Member States. \r\n We welcome the ongoing discussions on the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly in the context of \r\nthe balance between the various organs of the United \r\nNations, as envisioned by the founders. The role of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council must be enhanced in \r\npromoting global economic relations and in advancing \r\nthe development agenda, in close cooperation with the \r\nBretton Woods institutions and other relevant \r\ninstitutions. The Development Cooperation Forum and \r\nthe annual ministerial review are a welcome change in \r\nthat body. \r\n We need to make the United Nations more \r\neffective in ensuring coherence and consistency in the \r\nglobal economic, financial and trading systems. We \r\ncall for special support for counter-cyclical measures, \r\nsocial safety nets to protect the vulnerable, and fiscal \r\nspace to mitigate the crisis. We should make all these \r\nsteps particularly responsive to the needs and concerns \r\nof vulnerable countries, such as LDCs. \r\n Nepal welcomes the adoption of the resolution on \r\nsystem-wide coherence by the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-fourth session, with a view to strengthening and \r\nstreamlining the operational activities of the United \r\nNations in the field of development (resolution \r\n64/289). We also welcome and strongly support the \r\n A/65/PV.20\r\n \r\n53 10-55128 \r\n \r\nestablishment of UN Women as a single consolidated \r\nentity to deal with issues pertaining to gender equality \r\nand the empowerment of women. \r\n Global peace and stability are our cherished goal. \r\nGuided by that principled objective, Nepal has \r\nextended unflinching support to all major United \r\nNations initiatives for the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security through its active and consistent \r\nparticipation in United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations around the world. In 2008, we celebrated \r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of our association with United \r\nNations peacekeeping operations with a view to further \r\nconsolidating our contributions to the cause of \r\ninternational peace and security. Today, more than \r\n5,000 Nepalese peacekeepers work in 13 different \r\npeacekeeping missions around the world. Nepal’s \r\ninvolvement in United Nations peacekeeping missions \r\nhas been one of the remarkable features of its \r\ninternational engagement. We continue to participate \r\nwith dedication. \r\n In line with our solemn commitment to the \r\nUnited Nations Charter and our contribution to \r\npromoting its ideals, I have the pleasure of announcing \r\nat this Assembly that the Government of Nepal has put \r\nforward the candidacy of Mr. Kul Chandra Gautam, \r\nadviser to the Prime Minister of Nepal on the peace \r\nprocess and international affairs, for the presidency of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session. \r\n The gradual increase in the number of \r\npeacekeeping missions is an indicator of the sombre \r\nfact that the number of conflicts around the world has \r\nincreased in recent years. The sustainable way to \r\nresolve conflicts is to look at them comprehensively \r\nand remove the factors that generate and sustain them. \r\n Nepal’s commitment to human rights is resolute. \r\nWe are party to major international human rights \r\ninstruments. We are fully aware that the protection and \r\npromotion of all human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms strengthen the sustainability of peace and \r\nprogress. The National Human Rights Commission, an \r\nindependent judiciary, a vibrant civil society and the \r\nmedia have all played an important role in promoting \r\nawareness and protecting human rights in Nepal. \r\n Our fellow South Asian country Pakistan recently \r\nsuffered tragic loss of lives and destruction due to \r\nunprecedented floods. Similarly, fellow LDC Haiti \r\nfaced a devastating earthquake. Those disasters have \r\nwiped out hard-earned gains, and therefore we call for \r\nfull sympathy and support to them in their hour of \r\nneed. \r\n Climate change has become a challenge to human \r\nexistence, a multidimensional threat to human lives \r\nand all living things, the global ecosystem and human \r\ncivilization. It has a direct impact on our efforts to \r\neradicate poverty and hunger and to preserve the \r\necological balance. \r\n My country, which is a least developed \r\nlandlocked country with mountainous terrain, is highly \r\nvulnerable to climate change. The Himalayas remain \r\nthe perennial source of freshwater for over a billion \r\npeople living in South Asia. Global warming has \r\nprecipitated the melting of snow in the Nepalese \r\nHimalayas, and about two dozen of our glacial lakes \r\ncould burst their banks any time, causing a huge loss of \r\nlives and property. Moreover, we face extreme weather \r\nevents, floods, soil degradation and desertification. \r\nBecause of their fragility, mountain countries face \r\nspecial vulnerability to climate change. \r\n Countries like Nepal contribute the least to \r\nclimate change, yet we bear a disproportionate impact, \r\nand it is the poor and vulnerable people among us who \r\nface its severe effects. We cannot wait for action \r\nforever. At the national level, we are pursuing \r\nafforestation programmes and promoting the use of \r\nalternative sources of energy, as well as hydropower \r\ngeneration. \r\n There is an urgent need to make progress on \r\nclimate negotiations through an ambitious and \r\ncomprehensive outcome in Cancún, Mexico, later this \r\nyear. The international community should agree on \r\nnew, predictable, transparent and substantially \r\nenhanced resource mobilization and a fast-track \r\nprovision to ensure resources for mitigation, \r\nadaptation, technology transfer, reducing emissions \r\nfrom deforestation and degradation — REDD-Plus — \r\nand capacity-building in the least developed countries. \r\nLDCs must be given priority so that they may \r\nwithstand the sweeping impact of climate change on \r\ntheir people’s livelihoods. \r\n International responses to the special needs and \r\nconcerns of LDCs have had limited success. The \r\nimplementation of the Brussels Programme of Action \r\nhas produced mixed results. The overall performance \r\nof LDCs in the Millennium Development Goals and \r\nother internationally agreed development goals stands \r\nwell below their expectations, despite some progress. \r\nA/65/PV.20  \r\n \r\n10-55128 54 \r\n \r\nThat is primarily because we continue to face structural \r\nhandicaps and constraints, as well as a critical resource \r\ngap in our development efforts. \r\n Mutually reinforcing and exacerbating food, \r\nenergy, economic and financial crises, together with \r\nthe adverse and disproportionate impacts of climate \r\nchange, have further worsened the conditions of LDCs. \r\nLimited economic activity, stagnant growth, the early \r\nstage of industrialization, heavy reliance on \r\nsubsistence agriculture as the mainstay of the national \r\neconomy and a lack of employment opportunities in \r\nother sectors have made poor countries highly \r\nvulnerable to external shocks. \r\n Such challenges cannot be overcome without a \r\nrenewed and scaled-up global partnership for \r\ndevelopment. The fulfilment of all commitments to \r\nofficial development assistance in a predictable, \r\ntransparent and accountable manner, the enhanced \r\nprovision of duty- and quota-free market access for all \r\nLDCs, and the early conclusion of the Doha Round \r\nwith an ambitious, balanced, equitable and \r\ndevelopment-oriented outcome and early results in \r\nprovisions aimed at LDCs will help generate economic \r\ngrowth through equitable trade. Enhanced debt relief \r\nmeasures, an increased flow of foreign direct \r\ninvestment, technology transfer and investment in \r\nbuilding long-term productive capacity will be \r\ncritically important in order to ensure resources for the \r\nfinancing of sustainable development in LDCs. \r\n The United Nations will host the fourth United \r\nNations Conference on the Least Developed Countries \r\nin Istanbul next year. The Conference must aim to have \r\nan ambitious, comprehensive, forward-looking and \r\nresults-oriented outcome. As the Chair of the LDC \r\nCoordinating Bureau, I call upon the international \r\ncommunity to make the Istanbul outcome a turning \r\npoint in addressing the multidimensional challenges \r\nand constraints that LDCs face today. The success of \r\nthe Conference will be measured by its contributions to \r\nmaking a difference in the conditions of the millions of \r\npoor in our countries. \r\n Nepal is also a landlocked country. Therefore, our \r\ndevelopment challenges are further compounded by \r\nthat reality, which increases the cost of our \r\ninternational trade substantially. Therefore, specific \r\nsupport measures to improve infrastructure and trade \r\nfacilitation in line with the Almaty Programme of \r\nAction for landlocked developing countries will be \r\ncritical to promoting their development needs. \r\n I will now touch on the political situation and the \r\nongoing peace process in my country. Nepal is passing \r\nthrough the arduous transition from a 10-year conflict \r\nto sustainable peace and stability with a nationally \r\ndriven peace process. We have come a long way since \r\nJune 2006, when the peace process started, with some \r\nups and downs, which is only natural for a complex \r\npeace process. Yet our national determination remains \r\nstrong and unwavering, and we are fully committed to \r\nbringing the ongoing peace process to a meaningful \r\nconclusion by resolving all outstanding issues. \r\n From a longer-term perspective, Nepal has \r\nachieved some remarkable progress since the signing \r\nof the Comprehensive Peace Accord on 21 November \r\n2006. The promulgation of the interim constitution, the \r\nelection of the Constituent Assembly and, \r\nsubsequently, the declaration of Nepal as a federal \r\ndemocratic republic stand as notable achievements. \r\n Today, the 601-member Constituent Assembly of \r\nNepal, a third of whom are women, is one of the most \r\ninclusive assemblies. The Assembly comprises \r\nrepresentation from different ethnic groups, backward \r\nregions and traditionally marginalized communities, \r\namong others. \r\n Historic and unique as it is, Nepal’s peace \r\nprocess is not confined only to the issue of signing the \r\nPeace Accord and the elections to the Constituent \r\nAssembly. The next important task is to write a new \r\nconstitution for the newly born republic. That will \r\nconsolidate the gains made over the years in \r\nestablishing the people as the real source of \r\nsovereignty and State authority and in guaranteeing \r\nmultiparty democracy, human rights, a federal structure \r\nand inclusive governance. Therefore, the process \r\nencompasses a much broader agenda, leading towards \r\nthe historic transformation of Nepal’s political, \r\neconomic and social structure. \r\n The people of Nepal nurture the hope of a better \r\nfuture, which they rightly deserve. Political \r\ntransformation needs to be complemented by social \r\ntransformation and economic prosperity. While \r\nensuring political stability, we are making efforts to \r\nrevive the economy with new and focused initiatives \r\nfor the acceleration of economic activities, including \r\nthrough the celebration of Nepal Tourism Year in 2011. \r\nWe hope that visitors will enjoy the flora and fauna of \r\n A/65/PV.20\r\n \r\n55 10-55128 \r\n \r\nNepal, including tours to Lumbini in Nepal, the \r\nbirthplace of Lord Buddha. To that end and to \r\nrevitalize and accelerate our economy, we look forward \r\nto ambitious recovery measures with support from the \r\ninternational community. \r\n Recently we have made some progress in \r\naddressing the core issues of the integration and \r\nrehabilitation of the former Maoist combatants. In that \r\ncontext, I am pleased to inform the Assembly that the \r\nGovernment and the Unified Communist Party of \r\nNepal-Maoist have agreed to complete the process \r\nwithin four months, under the monitoring and \r\nsupervision of the Special Committee, formed on the \r\nbasis of national consensus, as per the Constitution. \r\n We anticipate accomplishing the outstanding \r\nbasic tasks in the peace process within the coming four \r\nmonths, with the positive contributions of national \r\nstakeholders and the goodwill and support of the \r\ninternational community. Earlier this year, we also \r\nachieved remarkable success, with the help of the \r\nUnited Nations, in releasing the disqualified minors \r\nliving in cantonments, based on the action plan signed \r\non 16 December 2009. \r\n The United Nations Mission in Nepal has been \r\ninvolved in support of Nepal’s nationally driven peace \r\nprocess. We express our appreciation to the United \r\nNations for its consistent support of our peace process. \r\n Nepal’s commitment to the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter is total and \r\nunflinching. For us, the United Nations is the best \r\nexpression of multilateralism. It has served the \r\ninternational community in the past and continues to \r\nwork as a linchpin of international relationships today. \r\nWe have no doubt as to its indispensability. \r\n However, it needs to do more in this globalized \r\nworld. Global problems require global solutions. That \r\nis possible only through multilateralism, based on \r\ninclusiveness and equity. We look for an enhanced and \r\ncoherent role of the United Nations in dealing with all \r\nglobal issues, but in particular those that affect the \r\nlives and livelihoods of the poor around the world. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Kalombo Mwansa, Minister of \r\nDefence of the Republic of Zambia. \r\n Mr. Mwansa (Zambia): I stand before this \r\nAssembly as an envoy of His Excellency Mr. Rupiah \r\nBwezani Banda, President of the Republic of Zambia. \r\n Zambia wishes to align itself with the statement \r\ndelivered by His Excellency Ngwazi Professor Bingu \r\nWa Mutharika, President of the Republic of Malawi \r\nand current Chairperson of the African Union. \r\n This session is taking place amid global \r\nchallenges such as climate change, loss of biodiversity, \r\nenvironmental degradation, international terrorism, \r\npiracy, HIV/AIDS, extreme poverty and hunger, among \r\nothers. It is an occasion for all Member States to \r\ncollectively engage in dialogue aimed at finding \r\nsolutions to the challenges that our countries are \r\nfacing, in order to contribute to the socio-economic \r\ndevelopment and well-being of our people. \r\n The Assembly’s theme this year is appropriate, as \r\nit provides an opportunity to reaffirm the central role \r\nof the United Nations in global governance. The role of \r\nthe United Nations is felt in areas such as \r\npeacekeeping, security, human rights, the promotion of \r\ngender equality and the fight for social justice and \r\nequality. However, emerging global challenges, such as \r\nthe recent financial and economic crisis, also call for a \r\ngreater role for the United Nations in global economic \r\ngovernance. In that regard, our Government would like \r\nto see a strengthening and enhancing of capacity in the \r\nUnited Nations to enable it to deal with some of those \r\nchallenges. \r\n Allow me to express Zambia’s gratitude to the \r\nSecretary-General for organizing the important high-\r\nlevel meetings that preceded the general debate. \r\n The summit to review the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) provided an opportunity \r\nfor the international community to take stock of \r\nexisting gaps and the challenges faced in the \r\nattainment of the MDGs. At that meeting I elaborated \r\non the progress Zambia has made and the challenges \r\nwe continue to face in our efforts to attain the MDGs. \r\nIn spite of the strides made in improving the \r\nmacroeconomic environment and putting in place \r\ndevelopment frameworks, the incidence of poverty in \r\nmy country remains high, partly because our efforts \r\nalone are not enough. I therefore wish to reiterate calls \r\nto the international cooperating partners to honour all \r\nof their commitments to ensure that the 2015 targets \r\nare realized. \r\n Let me also add that the measures that the \r\nZambian Government has adopted to address the issue \r\nof hunger and poverty include devising agricultural \r\nsector policies that enable smallholder farming \r\nA/65/PV.20  \r\n \r\n10-55128 56 \r\n \r\nhouseholds to improve their productivity. In that \r\nconnection, this year Zambia has recorded a bumper \r\nharvest of maize, which is our main food crop. That \r\nwill ensure food security and increased incomes for \r\nsmallholder farmers, who constitute the majority of the \r\nfarming community. \r\n We are mindful, however, of the fact that climate \r\nchange, as evidenced by persistent periods of droughts \r\nand floods in our countries, poses one of the most \r\nserious threats to the agricultural sector and thus to \r\noverall food production. While as a Government we are \r\ndoing everything possible, such as investing in \r\nagricultural research and irrigation methods, the debate \r\non climate change should not lose sight of the need to \r\nassist developing countries, including Zambia, in \r\nbuilding capacities to adapt in order to mitigate \r\nnegative impacts on the agricultural sector. Without \r\nthose, poverty and hunger will persist in my country. \r\n Zambia shares the concerns of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral regarding current global resource loss and \r\necosystem degradation. It is important that mankind \r\nreverse the ongoing trends of natural resource loss and \r\necosystem degradation as a commitment to protect \r\nbiodiversity. That will be achieved only if all \r\nstakeholders step up their efforts and meet the MDGs \r\nand other internationally agreed development goals. \r\n My delegation welcomes the positive \r\ndevelopments that have occurred in the past year in the \r\narea of arms control and disarmament. The Security \r\nCouncil’s convening of a summit to address \r\ndisarmament issues, the Secretary-General’s launch of \r\na five-point nuclear disarmament proposal, the entry \r\ninto force of treaties establishing nuclear-weapon-free \r\nzones in Central Asia and Africa, and the convening of \r\na summit in Washington to discuss nuclear \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation, among others, must \r\nindeed be commended. We hope those efforts and the \r\nmomentum generated will be sustained and will lead to \r\nthe resolution of all outstanding issues in the area of \r\ndisarmament. \r\n Zambia, however, continues to face difficulties in \r\ncontrolling the inflow of small arms and light weapons. \r\nThe illicit trade in small arms threatens security and \r\nretards social and economic development in our \r\ncountry. Zambia therefore calls for the establishment of \r\na strong and legally binding international instrument on \r\nthe arms trade. We strongly support the convening of \r\nthe United Nations conference in 2012 to establish \r\nlegally binding common international standards for the \r\nimport, export and transfer of conventional arms, with \r\nspecific measures against defaulters. \r\n On the reform of the United Nations, in particular \r\nthe Security Council, Zambia reaffirms its support for the \r\nAfrican position, as espoused in the Ezulwini Consensus \r\nand the Sirte Declaration, that Africa should be granted, \r\namong others, not less than two permanent seats, with all \r\nof the prerogatives and privileges including the right of \r\nveto, and two additional non-permanent seats. Africa is \r\nthe only continent without permanent seats, and yet it has \r\nthe second largest membership of the United Nations. \r\nGranting Africa permanent seats will redress that \r\nhistorical injustice. \r\n The Government of Zambia recognizes the \r\nimportant role that women play in attaining \r\ndevelopment. Furthermore, we recognize that the \r\nempowerment of women and their inclusion in the \r\ndecision-making process have enhanced their role in \r\ndevelopment. That is why Zambia has integrated \r\nwomen of all sectors of society in decision-making \r\npositions, and we are committed to doing even more. \r\n Our Government welcomes the establishment of \r\nUN Women, the United Nations Entity for Gender \r\nEquality and the Empowerment of Women, and the \r\nappointment of Ms. Michelle Bachelet, the former \r\nPresident of Chile, to head it. It is our hope that the \r\nnew Entity will have a strong and effective presence at \r\ncountry level and will help Member States implement \r\nstandards and will provide them with the much-needed \r\nfinancial and technical support required to achieve \r\nwomen’s empowerment, equality and equity. \r\n As the Assembly is aware, Zambia has been \r\nhosting refugees prior to and since its independence in \r\n1964 and is party to all refugee conventions. My \r\ncountry was among the first on the African continent to \r\nhost a refugee camp. Zambia is committed to hosting \r\nrefugees, and our experience has demonstrated that \r\nvoluntary repatriation is a desirable and durable \r\nsolution. However, as an under-resourced and least \r\ndeveloped country, hosting refugees is a major \r\nchallenge for us. We therefore call upon the \r\ninternational community to provide financial assistance \r\nto enable us to discharge that responsibility through the \r\nprovision of minimum standards of care. \r\n In addition to the question of refugees, the issue \r\nof internally displaced persons, which has continued to \r\nincrease worldwide, especially in Africa, equally calls \r\n A/65/PV.20\r\n \r\n57 10-55128 \r\n \r\nfor our attention. The adoption by the African Union \r\nlast year of the Convention for the Protection and \r\nAssistance of Internally Displaced Persons in Africa is \r\nan important landmark that requires the support of the \r\ninternational community at large. \r\n The sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe continue to \r\ncause great suffering to the people of that country and \r\nto the southern Africa region as a whole. Similarly, the \r\nembargo that the United States has imposed on Cuba, \r\nwhich the United Nations has condemned through \r\nnumerous General Assembly resolutions, has caused \r\nuntold hardship to the people of Cuba. Zambia calls on \r\nthis body to ensure that the sanctions on Zimbabwe and \r\nthe United States embargo on Cuba are lifted. \r\n In an effort to consolidate democratic \r\ngovernance, Zambia is in the process of enacting a new  \r\n \r\nconstitution. The National Constitutional Conference \r\nthat was established to oversee the process concluded \r\nits work and submitted a draft constitution, which \r\nawaits tabling before Parliament. As the Assembly may \r\nbe aware, Zambia will hold presidential and general \r\nelections in 2011. As in the past, international election \r\nobservers, including those from the United Nations, \r\nwill be invited. \r\n As we reaffirm the role of the United Nations in \r\nglobal governance, let us not be complacent in the face \r\nof great suffering and hardship in our world. Let that \r\nbe the force that drives us to action, where all nations \r\nwill work together in meeting the goals and aspirations \r\nof our peoples. \r\n  The meeting rose at 9 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
