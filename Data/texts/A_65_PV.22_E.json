(Switzerland) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 3 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Musa Abdussalam Kousa, \r\nSecretary of the General People’s Committee for \r\nForeign Liaison and International Cooperation of the \r\nSocialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamarihiya. \r\n Mr. Kousa (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in \r\nArabic): I am happy to congratulate you, Sir, on your \r\nelection to preside over the General Assembly during \r\nthe current session. I wish you every success in \r\nmanaging our business. \r\n It would be remiss of me not to express our \r\nappreciation to your predecessor for his efforts during his \r\nstewardship of the Assembly during the previous session. \r\n I also wish to express the appreciation and thanks \r\nof my delegation to the Secretary-General for his \r\nefforts in the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity, which will not be achieved until the world \r\ngets rid of all weapons of mass destruction and \r\nimplements the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty \r\n(NPT) with respect to all, without distinction. \r\n I remind the Assembly that my country has \r\nstressed the important need to amend the NPT so as to \r\nenable the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\n(IAEA) to perform its tasks and verify the reduction of \r\nnuclear arsenals, whose existence is the most \r\ndangerous threat to mankind. Equally important, we \r\nmust encourage States to possess and use nuclear \r\nenergy for peaceful purposes. We have affirmed many \r\ntimes that the voluntary initiative of our country to \r\nreject all activities related to the production of prohibited \r\nmaterials should be a role model for countries \r\npossessing, or seeking to possess, nuclear power. \r\n The United Nations was established to meet the \r\nneeds and concerns of Member States. An honest and \r\nstrict evaluation of the current situation and the \r\nOrganization’s achievements shows that we still need to \r\nwork in unison to support it. Here we should \r\ncontemplate the suggestions of our brother, the Leader \r\nof the Revolution, Colonel Muammar Al-Qadhafi, in his \r\naddress to the Assembly during the sixty-fourth session. \r\n The United Nations is at a crossroads. It must be \r\nreformed in order to achieve equality for all States. \r\nThis is the real reform to which we all aspire: that the \r\nGeneral Assembly become the main legislature, the organ \r\nthat can produce binding resolutions, as it represents the \r\nreal parliament of the world. The Security Council, on \r\nthe contrary, should be the executive tool, \r\nimplementing the resolutions of the Assembly. We have \r\ntime and again called for permanent membership to be \r\ngiven to certain Member States, but, in order for the \r\nCouncil to accommodate small States as well, the ideal \r\nsolution is to give Security Council membership to \r\nregional groups. That would secure the representation \r\non the Council of all nations, without the exclusive \r\nveto right, which is contrary to democracy. \r\n The African continent, which has been deprived \r\nof fair representation on the Security Council, should \r\nA/65/PV.22  \r\n \r\n10-55276 2 \r\n \r\nhave a permanent seat. That is a legitimate request. It \r\nwould put the African continent on an equal footing \r\nwith all the other geopolitical groupings. The speedy \r\npace of development in developing countries and the \r\nneed to narrow the painful gap between the developing \r\nand developed countries require international cooperation \r\nwithin the framework of a new and effective partnership. \r\n It goes without saying that the underdevelopment \r\nand poverty of most nations are the remnants of \r\ncolonization and plunder, the theft of their resources and \r\nthe illegal usurping of their riches. The former colonizers \r\nshould apologize for those actions. It is time the \r\nAssembly took the necessary measures to criminalize \r\ncolonialism, put the blame on the countries concerned and \r\nmake them accountable for their historical responsibilities. \r\n Nations suffered immensely from the two world \r\nwars, after which the United Nations was established. \r\nSince then the world has witnessed wars of aggression \r\nand illegal interventions which are a flagrant violation \r\nof all international customs and conventions. \r\n The invasion of Iraq is a shameful example of \r\nsuch unfair and heinous wars. In order to achieve \r\ninternational justice, the United Nations is called upon \r\nto establish an international investigative panel to \r\nunderstand the motivation behind the invasion and to \r\ninvestigate the mass killings and executions of \r\nprisoners of war, including the head of State. \r\n At this forum last year, the Leader of the \r\nRevolution, our brother, Colonel Muammar Al-Qadhafi, \r\nalso raised the question of the political assassination of \r\nmany personalities, including Dag Hammarskjöld, \r\nJohn Kennedy, Patrice Lumumba, Martin Luther King, \r\nMaurice Bishop and many Palestine Liberation \r\nOrganization leaders. Those assassinations shocked the \r\nconscience of the world and created anger and rage the \r\nworld over. However, justice was not done; the \r\nperpetrators enjoyed, and continue to enjoy, impunity. \r\nMy country has called for an effective international \r\ninstrument to secure an honest investigation of all the \r\ncircumstances that led to the assassinations.  \r\n An alternative Headquarters for the United \r\nNations has been suggested. We all know that certain \r\nconsiderations were in play in choosing the host \r\ncountry for the current Headquarters. But for the good \r\nconduct of our work, and to facilitate the work of the \r\ndiplomatic missions accredited to the United Nations, \r\nit is imperative to choose another Headquarters, in \r\nanother country. We must study all the bids presented \r\nby other countries, at the forefront of which is the offer \r\nby the Jamahiriya to host the Headquarters. \r\n Anti-personnel mines are weapons used by weak \r\nStates to defend their territories against invaders and to \r\nprotect themselves. Strong and mighty States do not need \r\nsuch weapons, because they possess advanced arsenals. In \r\nthis connection, the Convention on the Prohibition of the \r\nUse, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-\r\nPersonnel Mines and on Their Destruction, the Ottawa \r\nTreaty, should be amended in a way that takes into \r\naccount the security interests of small States. The drafters \r\nshould have included a provision for compensation to be \r\npaid to the States where such mines have been planted. \r\nMy country suggests a review of the Treaty. \r\n We must distinguish between the heinous \r\nphenomenon of terrorism and the deliberate biased \r\ndistortion of the struggle of nations languishing under \r\noccupation. The Palestinian people are waging an \r\nincredible struggle against enemies nourished by a \r\nracist creed, who deny the right of that oppressed \r\npeople to existence and self-determination. \r\n The world understands the suffering and losses of \r\nthe Palestinian people over 62 years. We cannot deny \r\nthe facts of history. This question cannot be settled \r\nthrough the so-called peace process, because it will go \r\non indefinitely. The solution, rather, is the establishment \r\nof one democratic State in which all can coexist, \r\nwithout discrimination, in accordance with the \r\nsuggestion by our brother Muammar Al-Qadhafi in his \r\n“White Book” regarding Isratine. \r\n In the framework of strengthening cooperation \r\nbetween the States of the South and those of the North, \r\nmy country is to play host in October to an Arab-\r\nAfrican summit. We shall also host, in November, a \r\nsummit of Africa and the European Union, which will \r\nbe a major transformation in the relationship between \r\nall the States concerned. We call on all stakeholders \r\nand all States to take part in the two summits at the \r\nhighest level, as they are of prime importance. \r\n In current circumstances, and in the framework of \r\ntoday’s challenges, we have great hope that bold \r\nmeasures will be taken to strengthen the General \r\nAssembly, its authority and effectiveness so that it \r\nbetter represents the interests of all nations. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Sayid Badr bin Hamad Al-Busaidi, State \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Sultanate of Oman.  \r\n A/65/PV.22\r\n \r\n3 10-55276 \r\n \r\n Mr. Al-Busaidi (Oman) (spoke in Arabic): It gives \r\nme great pleasure to offer you, Sir, and your friendly \r\ncountry, Switzerland, our warmest congratulations on \r\nyour election to preside over the sixty-fifth session of the \r\nGeneral assembly. I also wish to express our appreciation \r\nto your predecessor, Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, of the \r\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya, for his fruitful efforts in \r\nconducting the deliberations of the previous session. \r\n For more than 65 years, since its inception, the \r\nUnited Nations has registered tangible achievements. It \r\nhas offered assistance and expertise in the socio-\r\neconomic and environmental spheres, as well as in the \r\ncause of international security and peace, and has \r\ncontributed to the establishment of stability in a \r\nnumber of regions of the world. \r\n The Sultanate of Oman hopes that at this session \r\nthe Assembly will make unprecedented progress in our \r\nshared pursuit of international peace and security, as \r\nwell as prosperity. \r\n The international community meets today in \r\nchallenging times, faced with a whole range of thorny \r\nissues, from ongoing political instability to security \r\nchallenges, financial crises, economic and environmental \r\nproblems, the nuclear question and non-proliferation. It \r\nmay be useful to recall here the lesson that such \r\nchallenges can best be met through dialogue and \r\npositive participation by all, aimed at arresting threats \r\nto international peace and security. \r\n The floods in Pakistan led to the dislocation of \r\nmore than 20 million Pakistanis, who have lost their \r\nhomes and are still experiencing tragic suffering, \r\ndespite the continuing international rescue efforts. \r\nMore outside assistance, expertise and capabilities are \r\nneeded to help Pakistan overcome this tragedy and \r\nmitigate its consequences on the ground, as well as \r\npush ahead with the reconstruction process. \r\n Those floods, the volcanic eruption in Iceland and \r\nthe H1N1 epidemic, for example, are recent phenomena \r\nthat have highlighted how interconnected the States of \r\nthe world are and the need for international \r\ncooperation. What affects one corner of the world can \r\ntruly have sweeping impacts across the globe. \r\n The United Nations, its specialized agencies and \r\nlegal organs were established after devastating wars, in \r\nthe aftermath of the First and Second World Wars. \r\nAlthough the international community has not yet been \r\nable to find the means to resolve complex political \r\nproblems, the United Nations offers multilateral \r\nmechanisms and goals that have played an enormous \r\npart in the reduction or neutralization of many crises. \r\nIn addition, it plays key roles in helping developing \r\ncountries in numerous specialized fields related to \r\nsocio-economic development and the protection of the \r\nenvironment. \r\n We believe that the effectiveness of the United \r\nNations must reach a new level. This requires that the \r\npermanent members of the Security Council accept a \r\nreorganization of the United Nations, including an \r\nexpansion of its administrative base, with fair management \r\nof world trade interests, in a way which makes Member \r\nStates feel that it is an Organization for all. \r\n We look forward to seeing the international \r\ncommunity conduct a comprehensive review of the \r\nrequirements for international peace and security, in \r\nview of all the lessons learned from wars in the past \r\ncentury and in this century. \r\n We also look forward, Mr. President, along with \r\nyou and all Member States, to a world of lasting \r\nsecurity, characterized by good intentions and \r\nconfidence in the future, a world where all peoples \r\nenjoy shining freedom and the beauty of life. We look \r\nforward to the day when dialogue prevails on the basis \r\nof accepting the other, regardless of social and cultural \r\nvariations between human communities. We believe \r\nthat dialogue between Governments, which differ in \r\ntheir perspectives on issues, will lead to a clearer \r\nsystem of global partnership and coexistence, in which \r\ndevelopment, welfare and prosperity prevail. \r\n The Sultanate of Oman believes strongly that part \r\nof its responsibilities in the context of development is \r\nto make the Omani person the effective mover of the \r\nwheel of development. Therefore, my country has \r\ndedicated all resources towards that goal, especially \r\nwith regard to education at all levels and medical care \r\nfor every individual. \r\n The people of Oman and their Government play \r\ntheir roles in society and participate effectively in \r\neverything concerning the life of the Omani citizen \r\nthrough the Council of Oman, with its two chambers: \r\nthe Council of State and the Consultative Council. The \r\nrole of the Omani citizen along the path of his country’s \r\ndevelopment is central and indispensable, stemming \r\nfrom the firm conviction of the leader of Oman’s \r\nrenaissance, His Majesty Sultan Qaboos Bin Said, that \r\nlife is created for mankind, male and female, that \r\nA/65/PV.22  \r\n \r\n10-55276 4 \r\n \r\nfreedom is the core of life, and that free positive \r\nexpression is the seed of creativity, which is the fuel \r\nfor development. With that insightful vision of His \r\nMajesty, the Sultanate of Oman is moving towards the \r\nfuture with firm determination. \r\n We wish to stress our strong belief in the absolute \r\nnecessity of finding a solution to the chronic conflict in \r\nthe Middle East. Although we support the direct \r\nnegotiations between the Palestinians and the Israelis, \r\nsponsored by the United States of America, we still \r\nfeel that the Israeli policy is vague with regard to \r\naccepting Israel’s responsibility towards the requirements \r\nof peace: the establishment of an independent, sovereign \r\nand viable Palestinian State, with East Jerusalem as its \r\ncapital, and Israel’s withdrawal from all Arab lands to \r\nthe borders of 4 June 1967. \r\n We look forward to an active, positive and \r\ncontinuing role by United States President Barack \r\nObama in order to reach a just and comprehensive \r\nsettlement. We call upon Israel to grasp this historic \r\nopportunity to establish partnership in peace and \r\nsecurity with the Arab countries. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I call on Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Aurelia Frick, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs, Justice and Cultural Affairs of the Principality \r\nof Liechtenstein. \r\n Ms. Frick (Liechtenstein): It is a great honour for \r\nme to speak to the Assembly today, 20 years after the \r\nadmission of Liechtenstein to the United Nations. \r\nMembership of the United Nations is one of the \r\ncornerstones of our foreign policy and the central \r\nplatform for global diplomatic contacts. A strong \r\nUnited Nations, with a strong General Assembly, is a \r\nmatter of self-interest to us. \r\n It is therefore a special pleasure, Sir, to welcome \r\nyou in the presidency of the Assembly. We look \r\nforward to working under your leadership. You have \r\nalready shown wise leadership by placing this general \r\ndebate under the broad theme of global governance, the \r\ndiscussion most urgently needed in the General \r\nAssembly, which is the main deliberative body of the \r\nOrganization.  \r\n The very purpose of the Charter was in fact to \r\nestablish a system of global governance, with the \r\nUnited Nations at its centre. Today, we must ask \r\nourselves: Is the United Nations still at the centre of \r\nglobal governance? How does it relate to a number of \r\nother rising actors in the ever more crowded field of \r\ninternational relations? How can we improve global \r\ngovernance so that it better serves our peoples? \r\n There can be no doubt, to our mind, that global \r\ngovernance can only be effective if it is truly global. \r\nThat means global not only in reach, but also in \r\nparticipation. A system where a few make decisions \r\nthat everyone else is expected to implement would be \r\nnot only be unjust, but also ineffective. Past experience \r\nhas shown time and again that multilateral action can \r\nbe very effective when it is based on a broad political \r\nconsensus, which is not the same as giving everyone a \r\nright to veto. \r\n A strong fundamental agreement among States is \r\nthe only way to ensure that decisions are effectively \r\nput into practice. The place where such decisions are \r\npossible, where genuine political consensus can be \r\nforged, is and remains the United Nations. We \r\ntherefore have to invest in the United Nations to make \r\nthe improvements that are required, instead of looking \r\nfor solutions outside. \r\n It is with this general philosophy in mind that we \r\nview efforts by different groupings, most prominently \r\nthe Group of 20, to discuss questions of global reach. \r\nWe certainly welcome the fact that the largest \r\ndeveloped nations and the most powerful emerging \r\nPowers gather to discuss matters that affect the global \r\neconomic and financial architecture.  \r\n The recent crisis has illustrated how important — \r\nindeed, indispensable — common action by the Group \r\nof 20 in such situations can be. And more is to be done \r\nto address the systemic issues that led to the crisis in \r\nthe first place. We will continue to support those \r\nactivities. At the same time, inclusion and participation \r\nshould be placed higher on the Group’s agenda, and its \r\nwork should be better integrated with that of the United \r\nNations system. The quality of the discussions within \r\nthe Group of 20 and the effectiveness of their outcomes \r\nwould greatly benefit from an approach based on \r\n“variable geometry” — bringing in the views of all \r\nthose who are directly affected by the subject matter \r\nunder consideration.  \r\n We are therefore an active member of the Global \r\nGovernance Group, coordinated by Singapore, which \r\nseeks to promote the principles of inclusion and \r\nparticipation. We are grateful to the hosts of the next \r\ntwo Group of 20 summits, Korea and France, for their \r\nconstructive exchange with Global Governance Group \r\n A/65/PV.22\r\n \r\n5 10-55276 \r\n \r\nMinisters yesterday here in New York. We look \r\nforward to continuing this dialogue. \r\n We welcome the work of the Group of 20 and \r\nother groupings that seek to contribute to global \r\nsolutions. At the same time, they can only deal with a \r\nlimited number of issues. And, more importantly, they \r\ncan never be a substitute for genuine multilateralism, \r\nwhich must continue to take place inside the United \r\nNations. But we can only safeguard this central place \r\nof the United Nations if we can put it to use to find \r\neffective solutions to problems such as climate change, \r\ndisarmament and other areas where results have been \r\ninsufficient. If we continue to underachieve in the \r\nUnited Nations framework, we must not be surprised if \r\nsolutions are sought elsewhere. \r\n The United Nations continues to be the centre of \r\nglobal governance in the area of peace and security, the \r\ndomain of the Security Council. The Council has the \r\npower to make decisions that are binding upon Member \r\nStates, including on the use of force. This is the \r\nstrongest tool available in international law. Yet its \r\neffectiveness is increasingly undermined by the \r\nperception that decisions of the Council lack the \r\nrequired political legitimacy.  \r\n A central ingredient of that perception is the \r\nCouncil’s composition. Everybody agrees that it no \r\nlonger reflects today’s geopolitical realities. And yet an \r\nagreement to change it has been elusive for well over a \r\ndecade. We believe that there could be a middle ground \r\nin the negotiations: the creation of a new category of \r\nseats allowing States to serve permanently on the \r\nCouncil, if the wider membership elects them to do so, \r\non a recurrent basis. It seems to us the only logical \r\napproach towards a compromise, given the various \r\npositions around the table.  \r\n But the principal question may well be one of \r\ntiming. If States increasingly believe that the Security \r\nCouncil can only be reformed in a climate of serious \r\ninstitutional crisis, a view with which we disagree, then \r\nwe must reconsider the wisdom of trying to find a \r\nnegotiated solution at this time. \r\n Of no less importance for the legitimacy of the \r\nCouncil’s work is the way in which it arrives at its \r\ndecisions. Addressing the way in which the Council \r\nconducts its work is one of the biggest governance \r\nchallenges we face in the United Nations system. If the \r\nCouncil is indeed to carry out its functions on behalf of \r\nthe entire membership, as mandated by the Charter, it \r\nmust be ready to listen to those it represents — \r\nespecially when they are directly affected by its work. \r\n The group of small five countries, of which we \r\nare a member, has over the last few years initiated a \r\nprocess of reflection and gradual improvements that is \r\nvery much in the interests of the Council itself. We \r\nlook forward to continuing this process, with both the \r\npermanent and the elected members of the Council. \r\n The role of the United Nations in global \r\ngovernance depends not only on the performance of its \r\nintergovernmental organs, but to a great degree also on \r\nthe performance of the Secretariat. This is an enormous \r\nresponsibility on the shoulders of all our international \r\ncivil servants, especially the Secretary-General himself.  \r\n We saw a few years ago how much damage this \r\nOrganization can suffer from management failures and \r\nsystem breakdowns in the areas of procurement and \r\naccountability. A number of important reforms have \r\nbeen undertaken since. Most notably, we have \r\nstrengthened internal oversight and accountability. But \r\ncan we be confident that we have now appropriately \r\nmanaged the risk of another system breakdown in the \r\nfuture? Clearly, more needs to be done in this area, in \r\nparticular to fully implement some of the management \r\nreform measures already taken. \r\n The strongest emerging tool in our system of \r\nglobal governance is the dimension of justice. We have \r\nmade tremendous normative and institutional progress \r\nin this area in the recent past. At the same time, we are \r\nstruggling with the challenge to reconcile peace and \r\njustice in particular. How can we balance the dignity of \r\nvictims and the justice owed to them with the \r\nlikelihood of preventing further crimes? That is a \r\nchoice nobody will want to face. \r\n But experience shows that there is no \r\ncontradiction between peace and justice over the long \r\nrun. And there is a broad international consensus that \r\nthere can be no impunity for the worst crimes under \r\ninternational law, and therefore no amnesties.  \r\n Given the massive crimes committed against \r\ncivilian populations all over the world, this common \r\nstance against impunity is more important than ever. It is \r\nembodied by the International Criminal Court, whose \r\neffects are felt across the globe. Most important, though, \r\nit is also leading States to make greater efforts to fulfil \r\ntheir obligations to investigate and prosecute domestically. \r\nThese are developments of truly historic dimensions.  \r\nA/65/PV.22  \r\n \r\n10-55276 6 \r\n \r\n We are only at the beginning of our efforts to \r\nintegrate the justice dimension into our overall \r\ngovernance structure. This integration will not be a \r\nquick or easy process. But we must not shy away from \r\nthese discussions, and we have to approach them with \r\nboth an open mind and a determination to stand firmly \r\non the principle of fighting impunity. \r\n The challenges in global governance are \r\nnumerous and interlinked. The governance architecture \r\nreflected in the Charter gives us the possibility of \r\naddressing them. It is up to us to make the necessary \r\npolitical investments to make this system work for our \r\npeoples. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Kamel Morjane, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Tunisia. \r\n Mr. Morjane (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): First, \r\nSir, I warmly congratulate you and the friendly Swiss \r\nConfederation on your election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fifth session, and wish \r\nyou every success in your noble mission. We are \r\nconvinced that your great political and diplomatic \r\nexperience will provide the best conditions for the \r\nsuccess of this session and enrich its contents. This will \r\nhelp achieve the objectives and aspirations we all \r\ncherish, especially as regards the theme of the general \r\ndebate: “Reaffirming the central role of the United \r\nNations in global governance”. \r\n I take this opportunity to renew my congratulations \r\nto Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki and to the sisterly Great \r\nSocialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, for his \r\nvaluable efforts as President at the sixty-fourth session, \r\nhis deep knowledge of international affairs and his \r\nwise approach in dealing with crucial, complex and \r\ndelicate issues, thus serving the interests of our peoples \r\nand nations and enhancing the role of the General \r\nAssembly in international relations. \r\n I also wish to express my great respect to Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon, the Secretary-General, for his commendable \r\nefforts at the head of the Secretariat to further enhance \r\nthe position of our prestigious Organization and \r\npromote its performance, so that it can meet the many \r\nchallenges posed on the international scene. In this \r\ncontext, Tunisia reaffirms its support for all the efforts \r\nof the Secretary-General, and of the United Nations in \r\ngeneral, to promote peace, stability, security and \r\ndevelopment in all countries of the world. \r\n Tunisia highly values the important historic step \r\nmade during the previous session in the process of \r\nreforming the United Nations. I refer to the adoption of \r\nresolution 64/289, which reaffirms the importance we \r\nall attach to the development of the United Nations \r\nsystem and the promotion of complementarity between \r\nits activities and programmes. That applies especially \r\nto those pertaining to women, for whom a new unified \r\nEntity has been created to deal with all issues related to \r\ngender equality and the empowerment of women. I \r\ntake this opportunity to renew our congratulations to its \r\nhead, Ms. Bachelet. We wish her every success. \r\n Under the leadership of President Zine El Abidine \r\nBen Ali, Tunisia attaches crucial importance to these \r\nissues. Women, in fact, have a strategic role in our \r\ncivilizational project, and are considered a partner in \r\nmaking all our national choices. Tunisia strongly believes \r\nthat democracy cannot be built, and comprehensive \r\ndevelopment cannot be achieved, without the active \r\ninvolvement of women in public life, and that promoting \r\nsociety to higher levels depends on enhancing the \r\nconditions of women in all fields. This conviction \r\nstems from our vision of human rights in their \r\ncomprehensiveness, inseparability and complementarity. \r\n The prestigious status that Tunisian women enjoy \r\ntoday is confirmed by figures and indicators pertaining \r\nto human development and women’s involvement in all \r\nfields. They now represent 30 per cent of the country’s \r\nworking population. They hold 30 per cent of decision-\r\nmaking positions and other positions of responsibility. \r\nThey represent 33 per cent of the judicial corps — \r\njudges and lawyers — and 42 per cent of the medical \r\ncorps. In higher education, girls account for 60 per cent \r\nof the total number of students. In the legislative \r\nbranch, women’s presence has been reinforced to reach \r\n30 per cent in the Chamber of Deputies and 16 per cent \r\nin the Chamber of Advisers. \r\n It is indeed a source of pride for Tunisia to be \r\nranked first internationally in terms of fighting \r\nviolence against women and guaranteeing their right to \r\nfree movement and ownership of property, to be ranked \r\nfirst in the Arab world in terms of offering women \r\nopportunities for economic participation, and to be \r\nranked first in Africa in terms of women’s per capita \r\nincome. \r\n The Tunisian presidency of the Arab Women \r\nOrganization (AWO), in the person of Tunisia’s first \r\nlady, is in line with that approach. Mrs. Leila Ben Ali \r\n A/65/PV.22\r\n \r\n7 10-55276 \r\n \r\nhas endeavoured to spread the culture of gender \r\nequality, to further improve the condition of women in \r\nArab societies, to allow them to enjoy their rights and \r\naccomplish their duties, and to preserve their dignity. All \r\nthis, in fact, constitutes a civilizational and strategic stake \r\nand an integral part of the concept of Arab national \r\nsecurity and human security in all its dimensions. \r\n As part of the various pioneering initiatives and \r\nactivities of the Arab Women Organization, Tunisia \r\nwill next month host the third AWO Conference, with \r\nthe theme “The Arab woman, a partner in sustainable \r\ndevelopment”. \r\n Since the change of 7 November 1987, Tunisia \r\nhas adopted a comprehensive and balanced development \r\npolicy based on the inseparability of the economic and \r\nsocial dimensions, a policy that reconciles the \r\nrequirements of an economy based on the principles of \r\nprofitability and efficiency and an equitable social \r\npolicy in which there is no room for exclusion or \r\nmarginalization, guaranteeing a decent life for all \r\ncitizens. \r\n The electoral programme of President Zine El \r\nAbidine Ben Ali for the 2009-2014 term of office, \r\n“Together we meet the challenges”, and the five-year \r\ndevelopment plan for the period 2010-2014 have both \r\nmade a reality of those choices, reflecting a \r\ndetermination to further enhance the process of \r\ndemocracy and pluralism, to move political life in \r\nTunisia towards further modernity and continuous \r\nreform, and to launch a new process of development \r\nbased on the economy of knowledge and intelligence. \r\n As part of that ambitious, future-oriented plan, \r\nTunisia has attached crucial importance to youth as the \r\npillar of the present and the builder of the future, \r\nthrough regularly organizing national youth \r\nconsultations to explore the concerns, expectations and \r\nviews of young people. The results of those \r\nconsultations are taken into consideration in preparing \r\ndevelopment plans. Furthermore, Tunisia proclaimed \r\n2008 the Year of Comprehensive Dialogue with \r\nTunisian Youth. That event, with massive participation \r\nby different youth categories, was crowned with the \r\nadoption of a Youth Pact signed by all the national \r\norganizations concerned and the elite of Tunisian youth. \r\n Keen on consecrating this policy at the \r\ninternational level and on involving the world \r\ncommunity in supporting it, our country launched \r\nduring the previous session of the General Assembly an \r\ninitiative to proclaim 2010 International Year of Youth, \r\nto consolidate the position of youth in all societies of \r\nthe world, youth being at the forefront of the forces of \r\nprogress embracing noble universal values. Tunisia \r\nexpresses its deep pride over Member States’ \r\nunanimous support for this initiative, which the \r\nGeneral Assembly adopted in resolution 64/134.  \r\n Tunisia also takes pride in the fact that on \r\n12 August the Secretary-General himself chaired the \r\nlaunch of the festivities celebrating the International \r\nYear of Youth; he did so at Headquarters, in the presence \r\nof hundreds of representatives of the world’s youth. \r\n Tunisia calls on all Governments, international \r\nand regional organizations, and youth institutions, to \r\nestablish adequate plans of action, programmes and \r\nactivities to celebrate the International Year of Youth in \r\na way that makes a reality of its motto, “Dialogue and \r\nmutual understanding”, and leads to the adoption of an \r\ninternational pact to bind the world’s youth to common \r\nuniversal values. I take this opportunity to express \r\nTunisia’s appreciation for the initiatives of Turkey, \r\nSingapore and Mexico in organizing important \r\ninternational youth events last August. \r\n Throughout its modern history, Tunisia has \r\nremained committed to the principles and values of \r\npeaceful coexistence, good-neighbourliness, fraternity \r\nand mutual support. It has tirelessly endeavoured to \r\npromote relations of fraternity, friendship and cooperation \r\nwith all peace-loving countries, and has invariably \r\nadvocated peace, security and justice in the world. \r\n Since the change of November 1987, Tunisia has \r\ngiven particular attention to the promotion of relations \r\nof fraternity and cooperation with Arab Maghreb \r\ncountries, based on its strong belief in the unity of \r\ndestiny and the inevitability of Maghreb integration. \r\nWhile reaffirming its adherence to the Arab Maghreb \r\nUnion as a historic gain and an irrevocable strategic \r\nchoice, Tunisia is committed to pursuing efforts jointly \r\nwith sisterly Maghreb countries to realize the aspirations \r\nof the Maghreb peoples for complementarity, \r\nintegration and solidarity. This commitment stems from \r\na deep common civilizational, historic and geographic \r\nbelonging, and is imposed by the successive economic \r\nfluctuations and the deep and ever-accelerating \r\nchanges taking place in our world today in all political, \r\nsocial and cultural fields. \r\n At the Arab level, Tunisia will firmly pursue its \r\nefforts to promote joint Arab action and establish solid \r\nA/65/PV.22  \r\n \r\n10-55276 8 \r\n \r\nfoundations for an efficient inter-Arab economic \r\ncomplementarity. \r\n Tunisia has continuously played an efficient role \r\nin dealing with Arab causes, in the forefront of which \r\nis the Palestinian cause, through its firm and \r\nunwavering position supporting the brotherly \r\nPalestinian people at all stages of their legitimate \r\nstruggle, and calling for a fair, durable and \r\ncomprehensive solution that can put an end to the \r\nsuffering of our Palestinian brothers and allow them to \r\nrecover their legitimate national rights and establish \r\ntheir independent State on their land. \r\n In this context, Tunisia expresses its deep concern \r\nabout the situation in the Middle East, as a result of \r\nIsrael’s disrespect for international legality and the \r\nbasic principles of the peace process, its persistence in \r\nthe settlement policy and its attempts to obliterate the \r\nArab-Muslim identity of the city of Al-Quds Al-Sharif.  \r\n Tunisia expresses its hope that the resumption of \r\ndirect peace talks, launched on 2 September in \r\nWashington under the sponsorship of the United States, \r\nwill meet the legitimate aspirations of the brotherly \r\nPalestinian people.  \r\n We also call on all the influential parties on the \r\ninternational scene, particularly the Quartet, to act to \r\nbring Israel to adhere to the requirements of peace, on \r\nthe basis of international legality, the principles of the \r\npeace process, and the Arab Peace Initiative, and in \r\naccordance with a specific time schedule that covers all \r\nthe relevant main points. \r\n Tunisia also reiterates its call for an end to the \r\nIsraeli occupation of the Syrian Golan and the remaining \r\noccupied Lebanese territories, in accordance with \r\ninternational legality, so that all the peoples of the region \r\ncan enjoy security and peace, and devote their efforts \r\nto construction and development for a better future. \r\n Moreover, Tunisia hopes that the efforts made \r\nwill promote peace and security in Iraq, Yemen, the \r\nSudan and Somalia, within a climate of unity and \r\nnational harmony. \r\n Tunisia attaches particular importance to its \r\nbelonging to Africa, based on its belief in the \r\nimportance of its integration in its geographic \r\nenvironment and the expansion of the fields of \r\ncooperation and solidarity with sisterly African \r\ncountries. Since the 7 November change, our country \r\nhas endeavoured to realize this policy by reaffirming \r\nits commitment to the principles of the African Union, \r\nand continuously supporting all initiatives aimed at \r\npromoting the continent, achieving development for its \r\npeoples, and preserving its potentialities, within a \r\nclimate of security and stability. \r\n Tunisia has spared no effort to contribute to the \r\npromotion of peace and security in the African \r\ncontinent, through participating in United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations, supporting conflict-\r\nprevention mechanisms, and continuously acting for \r\nthe eradication of hotbeds of tension. \r\n Moreover, our country has continuously called on \r\nAfrican countries to play an active role and to find \r\nadequate solutions to their problems through activating \r\nthe central organ of the Mechanism for Conflict \r\nPrevention, Management and Resolution, the first \r\nregional experience of preventive diplomacy, then \r\nthrough the African Peace and Security Council, which \r\nhas helped re-establish stability in a number of sisterly \r\nAfrican countries. \r\n We reaffirm Tunisia’s support for all the efforts of \r\nthe African Union, which proclaimed 2010 the Year of \r\nPeace and Security in Africa, so that peace and stability \r\nwould reign all over the continent, which is a \r\nresponsibility of the international community as a whole. \r\n In line with those principles and with the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), Tunisia calls \r\non developed nations to act promptly to meet the needs \r\nof the African continent and of developing countries in \r\ngeneral, by using the existing international and \r\nregional mechanisms to ensure decent living standards \r\nfor African peoples. \r\n I take this opportunity to stress the need to \r\nactivate the World Solidarity Fund, created by the \r\nGeneral Assembly in 2002, upon Tunisia’s initiative, to \r\nserve as an efficient international mechanism for \r\nsustainable development, capable of achieving the \r\nMDGs, particularly the Goal of reducing the poverty \r\nrate by half by 2015. \r\n At the Euro-Mediterranean level, Europe is \r\ncurrently an essential partner of Tunisia in various \r\nfields. Our country has time-honoured historic relations \r\nwith Europe. Yet we consider that our relations still \r\nneed to be further enhanced and developed, through an \r\nequitable, solidarity-based partnership that rests on \r\nmutual respect and is in line with our strategic and \r\ncivilizational choices in terms of political reform and \r\n A/65/PV.22\r\n \r\n9 10-55276 \r\n \r\neconomic, social and cultural development. This will \r\nstrengthen the ties of cooperation and solidarity, and \r\nhelp reduce disparities between the countries and \r\npeoples of the two shores of the Mediterranean. On the \r\nbasis of those principles Tunisia supported the \r\nestablishment of the Union for the Mediterranean, a \r\npromising initiative that can create a new dynamism in \r\nEuro-Mediterranean relations, promote a positive \r\ninteraction to meet the coming challenges, and enhance \r\nsecurity and stability in our Mediterranean region. \r\n Tunisia is endeavouring to respond positively to \r\nthe huge changes occurring on the international scene, \r\nby developing the mechanisms of consultation and \r\ncooperation with all the American and Asian countries. \r\nOur country attaches great importance to the promotion \r\nof its relations with large regional blocs in the \r\nAmerican and Asian continents, so as to enrich \r\ncooperation and explore new fields for a strong \r\npartnership serving mutual interests. In this context, at \r\nthe end of this year Tunisia will host the Japan-Arab \r\nEconomic Forum. It will also host, in 2012, the Fifth \r\nMinisterial Meeting of the China-Arab Cooperation \r\nForum. \r\n Tunisia is also keen on promoting rapprochement \r\nwith South American countries, within an Arab or \r\nAfrican framework. \r\n The values of mutual support and solidarity, \r\nwhich constitute the pillar of our country’s policy and \r\norientation, and which have now become a deeply-\r\nanchored tradition, demand that we give immediate \r\nassistance to countries stricken by natural disasters, \r\nwhich cause thousands of deaths in many countries of \r\nthe world. Tunisia has responded promptly to the \r\nurgent calls by the Secretary-General to help disaster-\r\nstricken countries, such as Pakistan, which was \r\nrecently ravaged by floods, and Haiti, which early this \r\nyear was hit by a devastating earthquake, in which \r\nTunisia and the United Nations lost one of their \r\neminent diplomats, known for his great competence \r\nand generous devotion, the late Hédi Annabi, head of \r\nthe United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti. \r\n Today, the world urgently needs to adopt an \r\nefficient policy to protect the environment, so as to \r\nspare humanity the adverse consequences of climate \r\nchange, which over the past three decades has caused \r\nthe international community huge economic losses.  \r\n The Assembly is certainly aware that climate \r\nchange has a serious impact on stability in many \r\ncountries, given the many problems caused, especially \r\nby global warming, drought and floods, and the resulting \r\ndegradation of harvests and scarcity of water resources. \r\nOnce again, Tunisia underlines the need to accelerate the \r\npace of international talks on climate change, while \r\ngiving priority to human interests over economic \r\nbenefits, so as to reach an agreement guaranteeing that \r\na minimum of measures will be taken to meet the huge \r\nchallenges posed by climate change, particularly in the \r\ndeveloping and the least developed countries. \r\n Tunisia calls for the establishment of a decisive \r\nintervention programme to help remedy the effects of \r\nclimate change and the problems it causes in terms of \r\necosystems, farming policies, and international food \r\nsecurity in general. In this context, Tunisia reiterates its \r\nsupport for the African position and underlines the \r\nimportance of helping African countries to face the \r\neffects of climate change. Tunisia commends the \r\nattention given by Japan and Korea to this issue. We \r\nhope that the forthcoming Mexico summit will produce \r\npositive results that can help achieve the objectives in \r\nthis vital field. \r\n At the present session the Assembly has devoted \r\na large part of its agenda to the evaluation of our \r\ncountries’ achievements in the implementation of the \r\nMDGs, five years before 2015. Implementing the \r\nGoals and meeting the challenges resulting from the \r\nnew world order, with the deep changes that it has \r\ngenerated, require that we step up action to embody the \r\nprinciples of the Charter in international relations, and \r\nto anchor the culture of dialogue and the values of \r\ntolerance, civilizational communication and solidarity \r\namong peoples. \r\n Tunisia reaffirms its determination to continue \r\nactively contributing to joint international action to \r\nfind adequate, fair and durable solutions to current \r\nproblems, through joining in all efforts based on \r\ndialogue, mutual respect, consensus and mutual \r\nsupport within the framework of the United Nations. \r\nThat is the ideal framework for international action to \r\npromote security, peace and stability in the world, so \r\nthat our peoples can apply all their efforts and capacities \r\nfor comprehensive and sustainable development and for \r\nrealizing their legitimate aspirations for prosperity and \r\na decent standard of living. \r\n The current international situation can only \r\nstrengthen our adherence to the United Nations and its \r\nfounding principles, and bolster our determination to \r\nA/65/PV.22  \r\n \r\n10-55276 10 \r\n \r\nreaffirm its central role in meeting challenges and to \r\nconfer more efficiency on its activities and programmes, \r\ngiven its pivotal role in global governance.  \r\n In this regard, Tunisia hopes that Member States \r\nwill reach the largest possible consensus for \r\nintroducing the necessary reforms into the United \r\nNations system, especially as regards the composition \r\nof the Security Council, and for giving more \r\ntransparency and efficiency to the Organization’s \r\nperformance; that is in addition to further enhancing \r\nthe role of the General Assembly, which includes all \r\nthe Member States, and that of the Economic and \r\nSocial Council. \r\n To conclude, I once again wish all success to the \r\nAssembly at the current session, at which we hope it \r\nwill make constructive recommendations that serve all \r\nthe peoples of the world, promote peace and stability, \r\noffer wider prospects for progress and prosperity, and \r\nhelp meet challenges with confidence and efficiency. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. R.M. Marty Natalegawa, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia. \r\n Mr. Natalegawa (Indonesia): First I congratulate \r\nyou, Sir, on your assuming the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. I am sure \r\nthat under your able leadership our deliberations will \r\nbe fruitful. Let me also commend your predecessor, \r\nMr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, for the wisdom with which \r\nhe guided the Assembly at its previous session. \r\n The theme of our session, “Reaffirming the \r\ncentral role of the United Nations in global \r\ngovernance”, is both timely and well chosen. As we \r\nenter the second decade of the twenty-first century, \r\nhumankind faces a multitude of challenges, challenges \r\nthat are complex, multifaceted and transnational; \r\nchallenges that defy national solutions alone; indeed, \r\nchallenges that demand international cooperation. \r\nThose are precisely challenges of the type that the \r\nUnited Nations is potentially best equipped to meet. \r\n Such a central role for the United Nations derives, \r\nabove all, from its near universal membership — a \r\nrepresentative United Nations. It derives also from its \r\neffectiveness, its capacity to deliver results: an \r\neffective United Nations that is capable of delivering \r\npeace and security worldwide; a United Nations that \r\nequally serves the interest of all nations, developed and \r\ndeveloping, large and small; a United Nations that \r\nprovides a robust institutional support for efforts to \r\nachieve prosperity and equitable development for all; a \r\nUnited Nations that advocates not only political and \r\ncivil rights, but also economic and social rights, to all \r\npeople around the world; a United Nations that promotes \r\ndemocracy and justice; in short, a United Nations that \r\ncan play a central role in global governance. \r\n A United Nations that is at the forefront in \r\naddressing global challenges requires that we, its \r\nMembers, must move together in cooperative action: \r\ncountries of the North and South, East and West, \r\ndeveloped and developing. We must each contribute to \r\nthe resolution of problems and not simply accentuate \r\ndivisions, for there is no monopoly of wisdom amongst \r\nany one of us. \r\n Each Member State can contribute to meeting the \r\nchallenges to the international community. Therefore, \r\nour Organization, the United Nations, must have the \r\nwherewithal, the means, to ensure that the full problem-\r\nsolving potential of every nation is unleashed. Therein \r\nrests the importance of reform of the United Nations.  \r\n The Security Council must better reflect the \r\ncontemporary world, not that of 1945. A more \r\nrepresentative Council would be a more effective \r\nCouncil. \r\n The General Assembly must be revitalized. A \r\nmore efficient Assembly is a more effective Assembly. \r\n The Economic and Social Council must be made \r\nmore relevant, in accordance with its Charter-mandated \r\nresponsibilities. \r\n Not least, the full potential of the Secretariat must \r\nbe harvested. Its structure and organization must be \r\neffective and efficient and made more cohesive. \r\n The central role of the United Nations in global \r\ngovernance is due not only to its capacity to reform, to \r\nenhance its representative character, but also to its \r\nability to deliver in overcoming contemporary global \r\nchallenges, to deliver on its Charter-provided purposes, \r\nor, as the Charter eloquently puts it in paragraph 4 of \r\nArticle 1, “To be a centre for harmonizing the actions \r\nof nations”. \r\n As a Member State, Indonesia will do its part. We \r\nshall continue to contribute to United Nations \r\npeacekeeping efforts. We shall also strive to ensure that \r\nthe recent positive momentum on the issue of \r\ndisarmament is maintained. Therefore, Indonesia is on \r\n A/65/PV.22\r\n \r\n11 10-55276 \r\n \r\ntrack to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban \r\nTreaty. \r\n Indonesia will also work tirelessly to ensure that \r\nthe United Nations continues to discharge its historic \r\nresponsibilities on the question of Palestine. Thus we \r\nwelcome and support the resumption of direct \r\nnegotiations between Israel and Palestine. This is a \r\nprecious opportunity for Palestine and Israel to find \r\nsolutions on all final status issues. \r\n We therefore strongly deplore the decision by the \r\nIsraeli Government not to extend the moratorium on \r\nthe building of settlements in the occupied territory. \r\nSuch a decision does not in any way contribute to a \r\nclimate conducive for the direct negotiations. \r\n We will continue to contribute to the capacity-\r\nbuilding of Palestine, to support the Palestinian people \r\nin preparing for the day when they finally exercise \r\ntheir right of sovereignty. \r\n Today’s global threat to security demands more \r\neffective global action. The United Nations must do its \r\npart to promote global cooperation to address  \r\nnon-traditional security threats: terrorism, people \r\nsmuggling, drug trafficking, piracy and money \r\nlaundering, to cite just a few. \r\n The United Nations must also contribute to \r\nachieving common prosperity, to make a better world \r\nfor all. We support the strengthening of the United \r\nNations frameworks for the attainment of equitable and \r\nsustainable development. The Rio Declaration, the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), and the \r\nJohannesburg Plan of Implementation have been the \r\nmultilateral linchpin of this. \r\n We welcome the renewed commitment of all \r\nMember States to meet the MDGs by 2015. We need to \r\nstrengthen genuine partnership to deliver on these \r\npromises and to turn hope into reality. \r\n The challenges we face in attaining equitable and \r\nsustainable development are compounded by the real \r\nand imminent threat of climate change. Addressing \r\nclimate change is therefore essential. Accordingly, the \r\nUnited Nations should ensure that the sixteenth \r\nConference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, to be held \r\nin Mexico, results in a consensus agreement that \r\neffectively addresses climate change. It should build on \r\nthe Copenhagen Accord and the progress made in the \r\ntwo Working Groups in the fifteenth Conference. \r\n We also look forward to the 2012 United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development as an \r\nopportunity to enhance coordination, synergy and \r\ncoherence in efforts, including within the United Nations \r\nsystem, to address challenges to sustainable development. \r\n We need to strengthen the capacity of the United \r\nNations to deal with a complex array of natural \r\ndisasters, including the delivery of international \r\nhumanitarian assistance. \r\n We attach great importance to the review process \r\nof the Human Rights Council in 2011. We need to \r\nensure that the Council can truly support all countries, \r\ndeveloped and developing, to promote cooperation in \r\nthe field of human rights. \r\n And, not least, we need to see the United Nations \r\ncontribute effectively to the promotion of tolerance and \r\nmutual respect among cultures, religions, faiths and \r\ncivilizations. \r\n We, the Members of the United Nations, must \r\npromote better synergy between the United Nations \r\nand regional organizations and initiatives. Many global \r\nproblems become more manageable if there are \r\nsimultaneous efforts to address them at the regional \r\nlevel. That is why Indonesia continues to promote the \r\nstrengthening of cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the Association of Southeast Asian \r\nNations (ASEAN). \r\n Before the end of this year an ASEAN-United \r\nNations summit will be held in Viet Nam. Meanwhile, \r\nthe countries of ASEAN and other countries in the \r\nlarger Asia-Pacific region are building a regional \r\narchitecture that will bring about and sustain dynamic \r\nequilibrium in the region. ASEAN will, of course, be \r\nthe driving force in the building of this architecture. \r\n While the promotion of democracy is a global \r\nconcern, we are also vigorously promoting democratic \r\nvalues in our own region, through ASEAN and beyond. \r\nIn 2008, Indonesia launched the Bali Democracy Forum, \r\nthe only intergovernmental forum on political \r\ndevelopment in Asia. In doing so, we created an inclusive \r\nplatform for sharing experiences and best practices and \r\ngiving mutual support in the development of democracy \r\nin the region. This December, we will hold the third Bali \r\nDemocracy Forum, this time on the theme of “Democracy \r\nand the promotion of peace and stability”. \r\n We in Indonesia cherish our democratic \r\ntransformation. As the world’s third largest democracy, \r\nA/65/PV.22  \r\n \r\n10-55276 12 \r\n \r\nIndonesia is proof that Islam, democracy and \r\nmodernization can go hand in hand. But democracy is \r\nnot something that can be achieved once and for all \r\ntime. It is an endless journey, an unremitting process. It \r\nmust keep evolving to remain capable of addressing \r\nnew challenges. That is why we keep fine-tuning our \r\npolitical institutions, so that they become more \r\neffective in serving the people. \r\n The same is true of the United Nations. It needs \r\ncontinuous reform, so that it serves all nations, \r\ndeveloped and developing; so that it will be a more \r\neffective instrument of humankind; so that it will \r\ndeliver peace and the dividends of peace. It is now time \r\nto make the United Nations deliver. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I call on His \r\nHighness Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the United Arab Emirates. \r\n Sheikh Al-Nahyan (United Arab Emirates) \r\n(spoke in Arabic): At the outset, I congratulate you, Sir, \r\non your assumption of the presidency of the Assembly \r\nat its sixty-fifth session. We are confident that your \r\nexpertise in international affairs will enable you to wisely \r\nand capably guide the work of the General Assembly, and \r\nwe wish you every success in your endeavours. \r\n I would also like to thank your predecessor, Mr. Ali \r\nTreki, for his successful leadership of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-fourth session, and to thank Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon, the Secretary-General, for his great efforts to \r\nre-energize the role of this international Organization in \r\npromoting world peace and security and development. \r\n The international community continues to face \r\ndaunting challenges that demand strengthened \r\ncollective action, increased joint international efforts in \r\nthe United Nations framework and a serious move \r\ntowards reform of its organs in a responsible and \r\nbalanced manner, in order to enable the United Nations \r\neffectively to play its primary role in addressing the \r\nmajor challenges facing the international community. \r\n My Government wishes to reiterate in this forum \r\nits deep regret at the continued Iranian occupation of \r\nour three islands: Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu \r\nMusa. It demands the return of the islands, including \r\ntheir regional waters, airspace, continental shelf and \r\nexclusive economic zone, to its full sovereignty as \r\nintegral parts of the United Arab Emirates. All \r\nprocedures and measures taken by the Iranian \r\nauthorities since their occupation of the islands are null \r\nand void and have no legal effect, no matter how long \r\nthe occupation may last. \r\n We look forward to seeing the Iraqi parties form a \r\nnational Government that continues to build its \r\nsecurity, political and economic institutions, extend its \r\nauthority over the entire territory of Iraq and achieve a \r\ncomprehensive national reconciliation, which is the \r\nreal guarantee for stabilizing the political process in \r\nIraq and embracing all factions of Iraqi society, with no \r\nexception or discrimination. \r\n While we note with satisfaction the withdrawal of \r\nforeign troops from Iraq, we express our firm \r\ncondemnation of all acts of violence and bombings that \r\nhave targeted the Iraqi people. In this context, we \r\nreiterate the need to respect Iraq’s territorial integrity, \r\nsovereignty and independence, and to refrain from \r\ninterfering in its internal affairs, in order to safeguard \r\nits Arab and Islamic identity. \r\n The United Arab Emirates believes that peace in \r\nthe Middle East and resolution of the Arab-Israeli \r\nconflict cannot be achieved without ending the Israeli \r\noccupation of the occupied Palestinian and other Arab \r\nterritories. Israel’s withdrawal to the line of 4 June 1967, \r\nincluding East Jerusalem, the Syrian Golan Heights and \r\nthe remaining occupied territories in southern Lebanon, \r\nis also required in order to achieve a just and \r\ncomprehensive peace in accordance with the resolutions \r\nof international legitimacy, and based on the principle \r\nof land for peace and the Arab Peace Initiative. \r\n The United Arab Emirates stands by the \r\nPalestinian National Authority, and supports the \r\nPalestinian people in their quest to achieve their \r\nnational goals and restore their inalienable legitimate \r\nrights. We commend President Mahmoud Abbas for his \r\npersistent efforts to realize the interests of the \r\nPalestinian people and restore their rights. \r\n We affirm our support for the position adopted by \r\nthe Palestinian National Authority in the direct \r\nnegotiations with the Israeli. We hope that the \r\nindependent Palestinian State, with its capital Al-Quds \r\nAl-Sharif, will see the light of day next year.  \r\n We welcome the statement of Mr. Barack Obama, \r\nPresident of the United States, to the General Assembly, \r\nand his strong commitment to the achievement of peace \r\nin the Middle East. We also welcome his emphasis on the \r\nimportance of leading direct negotiations into final \r\nresults within a year, and seeing Palestine take its seat \r\n A/65/PV.22\r\n \r\n13 10-55276 \r\n \r\nin the General Assembly at the sixty-sixth session. In \r\nthis context, we rely on an effective American role, and \r\nactive regional and international support for the peace \r\nprocess in the Middle East. \r\n Our commitment to the achievement of peace as a \r\nstrategic choice means that we must condemn the \r\nIsraeli practices against the Palestinian people, \r\nincluding the collective punishment policy and the \r\ninhumane blockade imposed on the Palestinian people \r\nin Gaza. We also condemn other flagrant Israeli \r\nviolations of international law and of the principles and \r\npurposes of the Charter.  \r\n In that connection, we emphasize that the \r\ncontinuation of the Israeli settlement activities, \r\nconfiscation and Judaization of the occupied \r\nPalestinian and other Arab territories run counter to the \r\npursuit of peace. We say to Israel: Either choose to pursue \r\npeace or insist on pressing ahead with settlements. \r\nCombining the two is incompatible with peace. \r\n The United Arab Emirates will continue to pursue \r\nits international policy guided by the purposes of the \r\nUnited Nations and the principles of its Charter, \r\nespecially with regard to the promotion of international \r\npeace and security, the peaceful resolution of \r\ninternational disputes, non-interference in the internal \r\naffairs of States and compliance with the principles of \r\ninternational law. \r\n We shall continue to make our distinct \r\ncontributions to regional and international partnerships \r\naimed at building a more peaceful, stable and just \r\nworld, free of all forms of terrorism, violence, \r\nextremism, crime, discrimination, human rights \r\nviolations, human trafficking, and any sort of \r\nhumiliation or degradation of human dignity. We look \r\nforward to a world that promotes the principles of \r\ndialogue, interaction, mutual understanding, \r\ncooperation and interactive civilized coexistence \r\namong all religions and cultures, without any form of \r\ndiscrimination, the use of stereotypical images, hatred \r\nor denigration of religions: a world characterized by \r\nhuman peace, prosperity and development. \r\n On that basis, we condemn terrorism in all its \r\nforms and manifestations, wherever it exists, and stress \r\nthe need to intensify regional and international efforts \r\nto combat and eliminate terrorism. \r\n My country is an active member of regional and \r\ninternational partnerships and efforts designed to \r\ncombat terrorism, including the Global Initiative to \r\nCombat Nuclear Terrorism. We will continue our \r\nefforts to strengthen cooperation in the areas of \r\nintelligence exchange, capacity-building, combating \r\nand drying up sources of terrorism. We expect all other \r\nStates to shoulder their responsibilities in order to get \r\nrid of this growing scourge. \r\n In the meantime, we welcome the positive results \r\nof the West Point conference on combating terrorism, \r\nand look forward to the success of the next conference, \r\nto be held in the Republic of Korea. \r\n As part of our efforts to strengthen international \r\ncooperation in addressing the challenges of climate \r\nchange, and in order to assist States most at risk from \r\nthe adverse effects of that phenomenon, we have \r\ninitiated a partnership programme with the Pacific \r\nsmall island developing States, and we call upon the \r\ninternational community to support and expand the \r\npartnership at the global level. It is our hope that States \r\nparties to the Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange will achieve concrete results before the \r\nforthcoming Conference in Mexico. \r\n We are pleased to see that the accord establishing \r\nthe International Renewable Energy Agency has \r\nentered into force after ratification by the required \r\nnumber of States. In its capacity as host country, the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates continues to carry out its \r\ncommitments to the Agency in order to enable it to \r\nperform its duties effectively. \r\n My Government is moving forward with its \r\npeaceful nuclear energy programme. At the same time, \r\nit wishes to emphasize its commitment to all the \r\nrequirements of nuclear non-proliferation and its \r\ncompliance with the highest standards of transparency \r\nand nuclear safety. The United Arab Emirates has \r\nratified the Additional Protocol to the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. In this context, \r\nwe wish to express our satisfaction at the positive \r\noutcome of the recent Review Conference of the States \r\nParties to the Treaty. We look forward to the \r\nimplementation of the responsible and valid \r\nrecommendations agreed in the Final Document of the \r\nConference. \r\n The United Arab Emirates is working on \r\nprotecting the various aspects of human rights, and \r\nwelcomes the establishment of a new international \r\nentity on women in the United Nations, UN Women, \r\nand the appointment of the Under-Secretary-General \r\nA/65/PV.22  \r\n \r\n10-55276 14 \r\n \r\nfor Women’s Affairs. We are implementing various \r\nnational programmes to empower women, enhance \r\ntheir participation in the decision-making process, and \r\ndeveloping their status. \r\n We attach great importance to the issue of human \r\ntrafficking. We have therefore enacted legislation and \r\ndeveloped national mechanisms compatible with our \r\nobligations under relevant international conventions \r\nand resolutions. We call upon the international \r\ncommunity to develop an integrated global strategy to \r\neliminate this scourge.  \r\n We support the activities of the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations Forum, and welcome the fact that its \r\nfourth session is to be held in the brotherly State of \r\nQatar next year. We also commend the endeavours of \r\nQatar to make the interfaith dialogue conference a \r\npermanent institution. We welcome the decision of the \r\nEmir of Qatar to establish a centre for interfaith \r\ndialogue in Doha.  \r\n We hope that our deliberations during this session \r\nwill lead to positive results.  \r\n The President (spoke in French): I call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Moussa Faki Mahamat, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs and African Integration of the Republic \r\nof Chad. \r\n Mr. Mahamat (Chad) (spoke in French): The \r\ndelegation of Chad echoes previous speakers in warmly \r\ncongratulating you, Sir, on your election to the \r\npresidency of the Assembly at its sixty-fifth session, \r\nand assures you of our desire to cooperate with you as \r\nyou carry out your mission. \r\n I also express my delegation’s admiration for \r\nyour predecessor, Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, who \r\nskilfully guided the Assembly’s work at the sixty-\r\nfourth session. \r\n Our tribute and recognition also go to the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his courage \r\nand passion in seeking solutions to the problems facing \r\nmankind. \r\n Over the last two years the entire world has \r\nstruggled against the effects of the financial, food and \r\nenergy crises. The international cooperation \r\nunderpinning that struggle has been exemplary and \r\nunprecedented. But, while it was able to curb the \r\nfinancial crisis in the rich countries, the poor countries \r\ncontinue to suffer from the effects of the food and \r\nenergy crises, added to which are the negative effects \r\nof climate change on their environment. \r\n The Republic of Chad welcomes the fact that the \r\nUnited Nations is focusing on development challenges, \r\nin particular the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and their financing, as evidenced \r\nby the recent high-level meeting. But we fear that once \r\nagain the relevant recommendations that emerged from \r\nthat meeting will not be implemented. \r\n Over recent years our Organization and the \r\ninternational community have been particularly \r\nconcerned about the Darfur crisis and its impact on \r\nrelations between Chad and the Sudan, which have \r\nbeen fully normalized following the courageous \r\ndecision of Mr. Idriss Déby Itno to travel to Khartoum \r\nand finalize reconciliation with his Sudanese \r\ncounterpart, Mr. Omer Hassan Ahmat Al-Bashir. \r\n The two countries agreed, among other measures, \r\nto establish a joint force to secure their common \r\nborder. It is now patrolling the entire border to \r\nmaintain security. High-level meetings are held \r\nregularly to assess the situation. \r\n The two countries are also committed to \r\nproviding no support of any kind to rebel forces in the \r\nrespective countries, and they call upon those forces to \r\nlay down their arms and accept a political settlement. \r\nAs always, the Government of the Republic of Chad \r\nfavours dialogue. \r\n Although relations between our two countries are \r\nbeing normalized, and there is a growing dialogue \r\nbetween the Government and the armed opposition in \r\nthe Sudan, the situation in Darfur still merits special \r\nattention.  \r\n Chad, no doubt like the entire international \r\ncommunity, has a dream of peace in the Sudan, which \r\nis preparing for a major political event: the referendum \r\non self-determination for southern Sudan. That is a \r\nhigh-risk undertaking if the process leading up to it is \r\nnot controlled, and if the balloting is not organized \r\nunder the best conditions of independence, security and \r\ntransparency. \r\n We fear that failures in those respects could \r\ncompromise peace and security in the Sudan and the \r\nsubregion. That fear is reinforced by an appeal made \r\nthis morning by the Archbishop of the Episcopal \r\nChurch of the Sudan, who expressed concern about the \r\nserious risks of war. In addressing the appeal to the \r\n A/65/PV.22\r\n \r\n15 10-55276 \r\n \r\nUnited Nations and to the Governments of the United \r\nStates and Great Britain, the guarantors of the peace \r\nagreements, Archbishop Daniel Deng drew our \r\nattention to the significance of those risks. We must \r\ntake account of that legitimate concern. \r\n In any event, the international community must \r\nunderstand that the referendum in southern Sudan, \r\nwhatever the outcome, will have an impact on the rest \r\nof Africa. \r\n My country would like to see the Sudan’s unity \r\nand integrity maintained, but the Sudanese themselves \r\nare the only judges of their future, and Chad will \r\nrespect their choice. \r\n On the other side of the Sudanese frontier, in \r\neastern Chad, there are still 290,000 Sudanese refugees \r\nand 180,000 displaced Chadians, who have been there \r\nsince the Darfur crisis erupted in 2003. They are living \r\nin precarious environmental and social conditions; this \r\nis not to mention the situation of the host populations, \r\nwho also deserve more attention in order to restore the \r\nnatural balance disrupted by the massive influx of \r\nrefugees and displaced persons.  \r\n In anticipation of the withdrawal of the United \r\nNations Mission in the Central African Republic and \r\nChad (MINURCAT), Chad has committed itself to \r\nhaving its own forces assume the protection of those \r\nrefugees and internally displaced persons, as well as of \r\nUnited Nations and associated humanitarian personnel. \r\nThus, in accordance with Security Council resolution \r\n1923 (2010) of 25 May, the Government has developed \r\na sustainment plan to ensure support for elements of the \r\nIntegrated Security Detachment (DIS) post-MINURCAT. \r\nIt must be remembered that DIS is composed entirely of \r\nnational elements of the gendarmerie and police whose \r\nmission it is to maintain order and the rule of law in \r\nthe refugee camps and in areas with concentrations of \r\ninternally displaced persons, and to help ensure the \r\nsafety of humanitarian operations. \r\n Respect for security and humanitarian \r\ncommitments in Chad has led the Government to make \r\na financial effort of around $12 million a month. That \r\ndoes not include the cost of the joint Chad-Sudan \r\nforces’ operations to secure the border.  \r\n Logistical support for security and for managing \r\nhumanitarian needs requires the combined efforts of \r\nall. Therefore, the Government intends to organize in \r\nChad in the coming days consultation with all partners \r\nin order to mobilize the necessary financial and logistic \r\nsupport for DIS.  \r\n We take this opportunity to reiterate, once again, \r\nthe Government’s readiness to continue to cooperate \r\nwith the United Nations in all initiatives that will \r\nbenefit peace and security in eastern Chad, the Central \r\nAfrican Republic and Darfur. Accordingly, Chad \r\nwelcomes the meeting on the Central African Republic \r\nheld on the margins of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals summit. We hope that that important meeting \r\nenabled the international community to understand the \r\nextent of the challenges facing that country and to \r\nassist effectively both in the organization of the \r\ncoming elections and in the maintenance of peace \r\nthroughout its territory.  \r\n We believe that the cessation of armed incursions \r\ninto the area will have satisfactory effects on the \r\nphenomenon of recruiting child soldiers. The \r\nGovernment had already firmly resolved to eradicate \r\nsuch recruitment, long carried out by the armed groups. \r\nIt was with that clear intention that my country hosted \r\nlast June a regional conference on ending the \r\nrecruitment and use of children by armed forces and \r\narmed groups. My country makes its full contribution \r\nalongside the contributions of the African Union and \r\nthe United Nations.  \r\n In national politics, a climate of trust between the \r\nGovernment and the democratic opposition has existed \r\nsince implementation of the political agreement of \r\n13 August 2007. This has enabled the various political \r\nactors to agree on the conduct of our electoral process. \r\nAn independent joint national electoral commission has \r\nbeen set up to organize consultations on the various \r\nlocal and national elections, and it has decided on the \r\nschedule for local, parliamentary and presidential \r\nelections in the first quarter of 2011. \r\n With regard to development, the country has \r\nspent 60 per cent of its additional oil resources in the \r\nsocial sectors and on basic infrastructure as the basis of \r\nits socio-economic development. However, funding \r\nneeds for the MDGs in 2008-2011 show a gap of more \r\nthan $3.5 billion. Domestic financial resources remain \r\nwoefully short of our needs. Additional resources are \r\ntherefore essential to finance our development. \r\nAccordingly, we call for the support of international \r\nfinancial institutions, including the World Bank, to \r\nreach the completion point of the Heavily Indebted \r\nPoor Countries Initiative.  \r\nA/65/PV.22  \r\n \r\n10-55276 16 \r\n \r\n In spite of all those difficulties, the Government \r\nhas implemented a social policy based on free access to \r\neducation and exemption from all charges related to \r\nmaternal health, HIV/AIDS and malaria.  \r\n On the environmental front, Chad has taken \r\nstrong measures to protect the environment, including \r\nthe prohibition of excessive cutting of green wood, to \r\nconserve our forests and savannahs and to fight \r\ndesertification.  \r\n In addition, last June Chad hosted the first \r\nsummit of heads of State and Government on the \r\nestablishment of the Pan-African Great Green Wall \r\nAgency, and on its programme. Chad was given the \r\nhonour of hosting the summit, organized by the Sahel \r\ncountries, because of its pioneering role in the large-scale \r\nreforestation of the region. A national programme, “Green \r\nBelt”, to plant more than 10 million trees a year \r\nthroughout the country, began in 2009. Beyond the \r\nsubregional aspect, such programmes integrate \r\nperfectly with global initiatives in the worldwide \r\nstruggle against the ill effects of climate change, and \r\ntherefore deserve the international community’s \r\nsupport. \r\n Moreover, in October Chad will host the eighth \r\nWorld Forum of Sustainable Development, whose \r\ntheme will be “Save Lake Chad”. Lake Chad, part of \r\nworld heritage, is in danger of disappearing; it has \r\nshrunk from 25,000 square kilometres to less than \r\n2,500 square kilometres in 40 years, and is a typical \r\nexample of the disastrous consequences of climate \r\nchange. I take this opportunity to invite all people of \r\ngood will to take part in the Forum in large numbers. \r\n In regard to international issues and the alarming \r\nincrease in terrorist activities in several regions of \r\nAfrica and throughout the world, we express our total \r\ncondemnation of the gratuitous violence that threatens \r\nthe peaceful and calm existence of innocent citizens. \r\n I turn to the issue of Israel and Palestine. We \r\nremain constant in our support for this Organization \r\nand the Government of the United States with regard to \r\nreaching a peace agreement allowing the peaceful \r\ncoexistence of two sovereign States. To that end, we \r\nsupport President Barack Obama in his courageous \r\ninitiative with the two parties. We sincerely hope that \r\nhis mission will succeed. \r\n Our world has changed considerably over the past \r\n20 years. Peoples and States aspire to greater well-\r\nbeing, freedom and justice. Our common Organization \r\nmust treat those aspirations as part of its primary \r\nvocation. My country therefore again calls on the \r\nAssembly to work for Security Council reform, without \r\ndelay, in order to integrate Africa. The international \r\ncommunity must not accept the marginalization of the \r\nAfrican continent, which has so much to offer to the \r\nworld. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I call on Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Maxine Pamela Ometa McClean, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade of Barbados. \r\n Ms. McClean (Barbados): I am honoured to \r\naddress the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session \r\nas Minister for Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade of \r\nBarbados. \r\n The theme of this year’s session, concerning the \r\nrole of the United Nations, multilateralism and global \r\ngovernance, is timely, and it permits an examination of \r\nthe complex issues facing the global community today. \r\nMoreover, it lends itself to an exploration of solutions \r\nto those issues as well as to restoration of the centrality \r\nof the United Nations and its organs. \r\n A week ago leaders from every corner of the \r\nworld met and confirmed that the global consensus on \r\nthe United Nations Development Agenda remained \r\nintact. They pledged to spare no effort to ensure the \r\nfulfilment of our collective promise to the world’s \r\npoorest and most vulnerable. \r\n Barbados shares the view of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that the Millennium Development Goals must \r\nserve as “a blueprint for ending extreme poverty” \r\n(A/65/PV.3). The Goals are at the core of the global \r\ndevelopment agenda. They represent our common \r\nvision of a more peaceful, prosperous and just world, \r\nin which all human beings can enjoy better and safer \r\nlives. For the past decade these globally shared and \r\nendorsed set of priorities have inspired extraordinary \r\nefforts by Governments and non-State actors alike. \r\n Now is not the time for complacency. Progress \r\ntowards achievement of the Goals remains mixed, and, \r\nwhile success is still within our grasp, it is by no \r\nmeans certain. Our common task is therefore to convert \r\nthis unprecedented consensus into collective action on \r\nall fronts and immediately implement what has been \r\nagreed in order to guarantee success by 2015. Failing \r\nthis, the many words of the Outcome Document that \r\nwe adopted a few days ago will simply serve as yet \r\n A/65/PV.22\r\n \r\n17 10-55276 \r\n \r\nanother solemn reminder of human needs neglected \r\nand promises unfulfilled. \r\n This display of global solidarity in the face of \r\nunparalleled economic uncertainty reminds us that the \r\nUnited Nations is an invaluable and indispensable \r\ninstrument for its Member States and for the world’s \r\npeoples, as we seek to respond to the challenges of our \r\ntimes. While we may not have the same degree of \r\nconsensus on every pressing global problem, Barbados \r\ncannot contemplate the prospect of a world without an \r\nOrganization such as this. No other entity can mobilize \r\nglobal political will and coordinated action around \r\ncommon causes, and provide a voice for the voiceless, \r\nlike the United Nations. \r\n Scarred by the bitter experience of two world \r\nwars and a great depression, the founders of this \r\nOrganization had the foresight and wisdom to \r\nrecognize that only through multilateralism and a \r\nstrong and effective system of global governance, with \r\nthe United Nations at its core, could lasting peace be \r\nmaintained and international law upheld. \r\n Today we bear witness to a world which is more \r\ninterconnected and intertwined, yet in a real sense \r\nmore deeply divided, than ever. Barbados is of the \r\nview that an enhanced and renewed system of global \r\ngovernance must be at the top of the global agenda. In \r\nthis regard, Mr. President, Barbados fully supports \r\nyour initiative to address this issue during the course of \r\nthis sixty-fifth session. We must take stock and reflect \r\nin a holistic and comprehensive manner on the system \r\nof global governance, including the United Nations and \r\nits organs, to ensure that it truly delivers on the vision \r\nof our predecessors and serves the interests of all \r\nmankind, particularly the poor and the vulnerable. \r\n Delivering global public goods such as global \r\neconomic and financial stability; ensuring the \r\npromotion and protection of human rights; maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security; and ensuring \r\nenvironmental sustainability: those matters cannot be \r\nsuccessfully addressed by States acting on their own, \r\nor even by coalitions of the willing. Finding effective \r\nsolutions to those challenges and mobilizing collective \r\naction provides the most immediate and obvious reason \r\nfor enhancing global governance and strengthening \r\nmultilateral cooperation. \r\n As United States President Harry Truman stated \r\non 25 April 1945 at the birth of this Organization, in \r\nhis address to the opening session of the United \r\nNations Conference on International Organization, held \r\nin San Francisco: \r\n “Differences between men, and between nations, \r\nwill always remain. In fact, if held within \r\nreasonable limits, such disagreements are actually \r\nwholesome. All progress begins with differences \r\nof opinion and moves onward as the differences \r\nare adjusted through reason and mutual \r\nunderstanding.” \r\n Renewing the vision of our predecessors must \r\nstart with the United Nations and extend outwards to \r\nall organizations with a role in dispensing global \r\ngovernance. \r\n During this session we must finalize the decades-\r\nlong project of Security Council reform. If the Council \r\nis to retain its unique legitimacy it should be made \r\nmore broadly representative of the international \r\ncommunity as a whole, as well as of the geopolitical \r\nrealities of today. \r\n The Council’s working methods must also be made \r\nto adhere to the highest standards of transparency, \r\naccountability and efficiency. Its outreach to  \r\nnon-members must be significantly improved.  \r\n Barbados continues to believe that the number of \r\npermanent and non-permanent seats on the Council \r\nshould be increased, and that Brazil, Germany, India \r\nand Japan should join the ranks of the permanent \r\nmembers. Membership from the African Group must \r\nalso be assured. \r\n Sustained and widespread future prosperity will \r\nrequire major reforms in global economic governance \r\nas well as new approaches to global economic \r\ndevelopment. The global financial and economic crisis \r\nhas made clear the extent of the interconnectivity of \r\nfinancial markets, as well as their inherent \r\nvulnerabilities. While there is no precedent for the \r\ncurrent level of global financial and economic \r\nintegration, the policies, rules and institutions \r\nestablished to govern those processes are predominately \r\nnational in scope, and global mechanisms highly \r\ncompartmentalized. \r\n We can no longer postpone the task of reforming \r\nthe institutions responsible for global economic and \r\nfinancial governance. They must be better equipped to \r\naddress the challenge of a globalized and highly \r\ninterdependent world. In this regard, Barbados \r\nwelcomes the broadening of the Group of 8 to include \r\nA/65/PV.22  \r\n \r\n10-55276 18 \r\n \r\nthe participation of developing and emerging economies \r\nand the designation of the Group of 20 (G-20) as the \r\npremier forum for international economic cooperation. \r\n We also recognize the important role played by \r\nthe G-20 in stabilizing the global economy. We \r\nacknowledge its ambitious agenda to restore global \r\ngrowth and achieve needed reforms in the world’s \r\nfinancial systems. However, the Group must \r\nsignificantly enhance its outreach to non-members, \r\nincluding the smallest members of the international \r\ncommunity, particularly when issues affecting their \r\neconomic viability and survival are under discussion. \r\nFurthermore, it must also demonstrate real leadership \r\nin breaking the impasse in the World Trade \r\nOrganization and ensure a successful conclusion to the \r\nDoha Development Round. It must also ensure that \r\nreforms in the Bretton Woods institutions are \r\naccelerated. \r\n Small States have traditionally played a crucial \r\nrole in shaping global governance, and our voice \r\nshould not be diminished in efforts to reform the \r\ncurrent system. Barbados will play its part. It is against \r\nthe background of articulating the role and importance \r\nof multilateralism and a strong and effective United \r\nNations that I will explore the response of my country \r\nto these global challenges. I will also address the \r\nstrategies to be pursued by this small nation intent on \r\nplaying its part in this family of nations. Barbados is a \r\nsmall island developing State classified as a middle-\r\nincome developing country. It faces significant \r\nvulnerabilities made real by the spectre of climate \r\nchange and the associated natural disasters, the \r\nconsequences of the recent financial and economic \r\ncrises, and the threat posed by transnational criminal \r\nnetworks. My country has sought to take its place in a \r\nworld characterized by increasing economic, \r\nenvironmental and social complexities. We take our \r\nplace in a world in which the United Nations family \r\ncontinues to witness increasing economic interdependence \r\nand globalization, both posing challenges to national \r\nsovereignty. \r\n Barbados shares the United Nations vision for a \r\nworld able to achieve and surpass the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. We are committed to the fight \r\nagainst the ravages of HIV and AIDS and other \r\ninfectious diseases. As a natural-resources-poor small \r\nisland developing State, we have achieved much on the \r\nbasis of our investment in human development, \r\nprimarily in the areas of education and health. We have \r\nthus prioritized our responses to those global \r\nchallenges in a manner that puts our people first. Our \r\nsuccesses to date have been due to our investment in \r\nour key resource — our people. Given the emphasis on \r\nour people’s development and the dangers posed to our \r\npopulation, we supported the resolution entitled \r\n“Prevention and control of non-communicable \r\ndiseases” (resolution 64/265), introduced by the \r\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) at the sixty-fourth \r\nsession of the General Assembly in 2009. Our \r\nresponses can be seen in our efforts to achieve our \r\nultimate goal of crafting a green economy. We see the \r\ngreen economy as a tool for transforming our economy \r\nto achieve sustainable development. At the heart of this \r\neconomic and social model is a commitment to people-\r\ncentred development. Aligning our development \r\nstrategy along this particular trajectory ensures a \r\nconsistency not only with our global obligations but \r\nalso, and more importantly, with our national values \r\nand in the best interests of all our citizens. \r\n Even as the international community searches for \r\na definition of the green economy, Barbados has \r\nsimply defined this model as an integrated production, \r\ndistribution, consumption and waste assimilation \r\nsystem that, at its core, reflects the fragility of our \r\nsmall island ecosystems as the basis for policy \r\ninterventions for natural resource protection, business \r\nand investment choice, human development \r\nprogramming, and the facilitation of export market \r\ndevelopment strategies. \r\n In pursuit of the green economy the Government \r\nof Barbados has undertaken an assessment of the \r\nopportunities and challenges of a green economy \r\ntransition. Our focus is on the priority sectors of \r\ntourism, agriculture, transport and housing, along with \r\ncross-sectoral issues of water resources, energy and \r\nwaste. In addition, we have partnered with the United \r\nNations Environment Programme to promote a \r\ntransition to a green economy, building on existing \r\nBarbados initiatives in the area of resource efficiency \r\nand the promotion of sustainable consumption and \r\nproduction. We believe that our experience in \r\ntransitioning to a green economy will serve as a useful \r\nmodel for other small island developing States and \r\nsmall economies, and we intend to share our unique \r\nperspective with the international community in the \r\npreparatory process for the Rio+20 Summit in 2012. \r\n The efforts of Barbados to transform its economy \r\ninto a green economy and achieve sustainable \r\n A/65/PV.22\r\n \r\n19 10-55276 \r\n \r\ndevelopment will be undermined without ambitious \r\nand urgent global action to address climate change. The \r\nchallenge of climate change remains one of the great \r\nthreats to the survival and viability of Barbados and \r\nother small island developing States. Even as science \r\npoints to a worsening situation, global emissions \r\ncontinue to rise and the prospects seem dim of arriving \r\nat an agreement to provide legal certainty in the fight \r\nagainst climate change. It is clear that the objective of \r\nan ambitious and comprehensive legally binding \r\noutcome will not be achieved in Cancún, Mexico, in \r\nDecember this year. Barbados nevertheless believes \r\nthat the substantive outcomes at the sixteenth session \r\nof the Conference of Parties (COP-16) to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \r\nmust demonstrate that the international community \r\nremains committed to addressing the defining \r\nchallenge of our time. In this regard COP-16 should \r\ndeliver outcomes that: prioritize the needs of the most \r\nvulnerable, particularly in the areas of adaptation and \r\nfinance; finalize issues on which there is a broad \r\nagreement and provide guidance and clarity on the \r\ndifficult issues; and demonstrate progress on the \r\ndelivery of the $30 billion fast-start financing pledged \r\nat Copenhagen. Critical to the success at Cancún is \r\narriving at a common understanding of how, when and \r\nwhere an ambitious and legally binding international \r\nclimate agreement will be finalized. \r\n In 1994 Barbados had the distinct honour of \r\nhosting the first Global Conference on the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States. The \r\nBarbados Programme of Action and the Mauritius \r\nStrategy for Implementation (MSI) remain the essential \r\nblueprints for the sustainable development of small \r\nisland developing States. Barbados welcomes the \r\nrecently adopted outcome of the five-year review of the \r\nMSI and hopes that this will result in a renewal of the \r\ncommitment of the international community to support \r\nthe sustainable development of small island developing \r\nStates. It is of great concern to Barbados that, 18 years \r\nafter the international recognition of the special case of \r\nsmall island developing States at Rio, our unique and \r\nparticular vulnerability is being challenged. Barbados \r\nis not prepared to renegotiate the special case of small \r\nisland developing States but urges the international \r\ncommunity to focus on the delivery of tangible and \r\nconcrete actions to build resilience and promote \r\nsustainable development in small island developing \r\nStates. \r\n The January 2010 earthquake that devastated \r\nHaiti serves as a grim reminder of the fragility of \r\nisland States to natural disasters. In the immediate \r\naftermath of the earthquake, the Government of \r\nBarbados provided financial assistance, relief supplies \r\nand deployed a contingent of medical and security \r\npersonnel as part of a CARICOM relief team. If Haiti \r\nis to realize its full potential, the international \r\ncommunity must remain fully engaged in Haiti, and the \r\nmany pledges of financial and technical support must \r\nbe delivered on time. The Government and people of \r\nHaiti can be assured that Barbados will continue to be \r\na partner in this rebuilding and reconstruction phase. \r\nOur commitment remains strong, and we will play our \r\npart in Haiti’s long-term development. We call on all \r\nwho have mobilized resources for the benefit of Haiti \r\nto work with countries like Barbados and in \r\ncollaboration with the Government and people of Haiti \r\nto rebuild that country. \r\n There is a very definite role for a reformed \r\nUnited Nations to assist countries like Barbados. The \r\nmodel economy being pursued by Barbados cannot be \r\nachieved by unilateral action. \r\n As stated previously, the role of the United \r\nNations is clear. It must generate the templates to be \r\nadopted and serve as a catalyst for action: it must seek \r\nto mediate where conflicts arise; it must work to ensure \r\nthat there are reforms of the global economic and \r\nfinancial system to make it inclusive, transparent and \r\nsupportive of the development aspirations of least \r\ndeveloped countries and more developed countries; it \r\nmust also facilitate South-South cooperation, \r\nsupporting the efforts of these countries to share \r\nappropriate experiences and indigenous solutions. \r\n Barbados shares your vision, Sir, for a strong, \r\ninclusive and open United Nations as the guarantor of \r\nglobal governance. Barbados maintains the strong \r\nposition that responsibility for the setting of rules and \r\nthe making of core decisions on matters of a global \r\nnature rightfully belongs within the ambit of the United \r\nNations, given its primacy as the only legitimate forum \r\nfor global action. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Moctar Ouane, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs and International Cooperation of the \r\nRepublic of Mali. \r\n Mr. Ouane (Mali) (spoke in French): It is a great \r\nprivilege and signal honour for me to address the \r\nA/65/PV.22  \r\n \r\n10-55276 20 \r\n \r\nAssembly on behalf of the President of the Republic of \r\nMali, His Excellency Mr. Amadou Toumani Touré, \r\nwho, because of a very busy schedule resulting from \r\nthe celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of Mali’s \r\nindependence, is unable to be here with us today. He \r\nhas expressly charged me with conveying to the \r\nAssembly his sincere greetings and his wishes for \r\nevery success for the work of this current session. \r\n At the outset I should like to convey to you, Sir, \r\nthe warmest congratulations of the delegation of Mali \r\non your election to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-fifth session. Your election is a \r\ntribute to your eminent professional skills and is also \r\nan expression of the unanimous recognition given by \r\nthe international community to the commitment of your \r\ncountry, Switzerland, a friend of Mali, to the ideals of \r\nour Organization. I assure you of my delegation’s \r\nconstant support in fulfilling your mandate. Allow me \r\nalso to express our deep appreciation to your \r\npredecessor, Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, for his deep \r\ncommitment and the remarkable manner in which he \r\nguided our work during the sixty-fourth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. In turn, I commend the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his constant efforts and \r\nhis commitment to meeting the aims and objectives of \r\nthis Organization. \r\n On 28 September 1960, only a few days after the \r\nproclamation of independence, my country, Mali, became \r\na Member of the United Nations. Today, on 28 September \r\n2010, 50 years later, I, speaking to you from this \r\nselfsame rostrum, would like to reaffirm with force and \r\nconviction the commitment of the Republic of Mali to \r\nthe promotion of the principles and purposes of the \r\nCharter, the establishment of friendly relations with all \r\nnations of the world and the promotion of international \r\ncooperation, and to contributing to the dawning of a \r\nworld of peace, justice and progress. \r\n Indeed, today a new Mali is on the rise. Under the \r\nleadership of President Amadou Toumani Touré, this \r\nnew Mali continues to progress towards the \r\ndevelopment and well-being of its people, each day \r\nfurther building upon the gains of peaceful democracy, \r\nrecognized worldwide as being exemplary, and further \r\nenhances its presence in Africa and on the international \r\nstage. Today, on 28 September 2010, I convey here and \r\nnow to the peoples of the world, to the Governments of \r\nfriendly countries, and to Mali’s development partners, \r\nthe greetings and gratitude of my country and reaffirm \r\nthe solidarity and commitment of the Republic of Mali \r\nin our shared quest for a better world. \r\n Mr. Ntwaagae (Botswana), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n This general debate has opened by setting out to \r\ntackle a timely subject, the reaffirmation of the central \r\nrole of the United Nations in global governance. In this \r\nregard, Mali reiterates from the outset its faith in the \r\ncapacity of the Organization to be a catalyst in the \r\nprocesses of global democratization and governance. In \r\nthat connection my country, Mali, continues to call for \r\na reform of the global economic and financial \r\narchitecture, the only way to prevent the occurrence of \r\neven worse crises. In the same vein, Mali believes that \r\njust and equitable representation of all regions of the \r\nworld must be guaranteed within our Organization, in \r\nparticular through Security Council reform. \r\n In that regard, Mali reaffirms its adherence to the \r\nEzulwini Consensus and to the Sirte Declaration, \r\nadopted by the heads of State and Government of the \r\nAfrican Union, and fully supports Africa’s demand for \r\ntwo permanent seats and five non-permanent seats. A \r\nreformed Council would better reflect the geopolitical \r\nrealities of the world today, thus contributing towards \r\nrepairing the historical injustices towards Africa, the \r\nonly region of the world not to have a permanent seat on \r\nthe Security Council. In the same spirit Mali, together \r\nwith all other Member States, will strive to reinforce \r\nthe effectiveness of the role of the Council and to \r\npromote the revitalization of the General Assembly. \r\n With only five years now to the 2015 deadline set \r\nto achieve the Millennium Development Goals and in \r\nspite of the tireless efforts made by many developing \r\ncountries, millions of people worldwide are still \r\nwaiting for the Millennium Declaration to take \r\nconcrete effect. The High-level Plenary Meeting on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, which has just \r\nconcluded, would have been a useful opportunity for \r\nheads of States and Government to evaluate the \r\nprogress made in various areas, draw lessons from the \r\nbest practices and define approaches towards meeting \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals by 2015. For its \r\npart, the Republic of Mali is resolutely committed to \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals in a \r\nsustainable manner through the adoption of a 10-year \r\nplan for the years 2006-2015, and through the \r\nimplementation of a strategic framework for growth \r\nand poverty reduction and a project for economic and \r\n A/65/PV.22\r\n \r\n21 10-55276 \r\n \r\nsocial development, all of which focus in particular on \r\nagriculture and food security, education and health. \r\n From this rostrum I invite the international \r\ncommunity to continue to support our efforts in \r\nimplementing this range of economic and social \r\ndevelopment policies in Mali, as we are encouraged by \r\nthe results achieved in previous strategies. Indeed, the \r\nimplementation of such strategies has made it possible \r\nto increase the schooling rate from 64 per cent in 2002 \r\nto 80 per cent in 2008. Mortality for children under the \r\nage of 5 has fallen from 229 per thousand in 2001 to \r\n191 per thousand in 2006, while HIV/AIDS prevalence \r\nhas fallen from 1.7 per cent in 2001 to 1.3 per cent in \r\n2006. Thus, Mali deems it essential to expedite the \r\nimplementation of the commitments made at key \r\ninternational conferences, particularly the Monterrey \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for Development, \r\nthe Brussels Conference on the Least Developed \r\nCountries, the Barbados Global Conference on the \r\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing \r\nStates and the Almaty Conference on landlocked \r\ndeveloping States. \r\n Undoubtedly climate change poses one of the \r\ngreatest challenges currently facing the international \r\ncommunity. Today more than ever, the survival of our \r\nplanet is threatened by natural disasters caused by this \r\nphenomenon, which seriously affects the living \r\nconditions in developing countries such as my own \r\nthrough — in our case — the encroachment of the \r\ndesert, the silting up of the Niger river, the \r\ndeterioration of our ecosystem, the shortening of the \r\nwinter season and poor rainfall distribution. That is \r\nwhy Mali will spare no effort to make its modest \r\ncontribution towards finding a global and binding \r\nagreement on climate change. To that end, in \r\nNovember 2010 my country will host a regional forum \r\non sustainable development. \r\n The AIDS pandemic continues to hamper \r\ndevelopment efforts in many countries and thus poses \r\none of the greatest threats to the survival of humanity \r\nand global security. In keeping with the Abuja \r\nDeclaration on HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Other \r\nRelated Infectious Diseases, the Brazzaville \r\nCommitment for universal access to treatment in Africa \r\nand the Lomé Declaration on HIV/AIDS in Africa, \r\nMali has launched a vast programme of multisectoral \r\nreform, both at the institutional and operational levels. \r\nThat programme compels all the sectors, in particular \r\nthe public, private and civil society sectors, to become \r\nbetter organized in order to better coordinate their \r\nactivities to combat AIDS effectively and be held \r\naccountable to the nation. \r\n The new transnational threats of trafficking in \r\ndrugs, arms, human beings and terrorism seriously \r\njeopardize international peace and security. The \r\ninternational community must resolutely tackle those \r\nthreats. That means acting quickly and effectively. As I \r\nunderscored in the General Assembly during the \r\nsecond review of the United Nations global counter-\r\nterrorism strategy on 8 September 2010, Mali has \r\nadopted a new strategy to combat the lack of security \r\nand terrorism. On the one hand, this new strategy seeks \r\nto strengthen national capacities through robust actions \r\nin the field of security and community development \r\nand on the other hand it seeks to promote effective \r\nregional cooperation with the unified commitment of \r\nStates of the Sahelo-Saharan region and with the \r\nsupport of the international community. Building on \r\nthis same impetus, the President of the Republic of \r\nMali, His Excellency Mr. Amadou Toumani Touré, has \r\ntaken the initiative of organizing a conference in Mali on \r\npeace, security and development in the Sahelo-Saharan \r\nregion. \r\n The maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity has been and will remain one of the most \r\npressing concerns of the international community. \r\nWithout peace there is no development or prosperity, \r\nnor will there be, and that is why Mali remains firmly \r\nattached to the ideals of peace and stability, both within \r\nand beyond its borders. In this regard, we welcome the \r\nprogress made in national reconstruction and \r\nreconciliation, in peacebuilding and in the process of \r\ndemocratic transition, in particular in Guinea-Bissau, \r\nthe Republic of Guinea, Côte d’Ivoire and the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo.  \r\n In the Middle East, we reaffirm our solidarity \r\nwith our brother Palestinian people in their courageous \r\nstruggle for the creation of an independent and \r\nsovereign State with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, \r\nand we have closely followed the evolving situation in \r\nthat part of the world and continue to support the \r\nrelevant resolutions of the United Nations in this area. \r\n To conclude, I should like to reiterate our \r\nsolidarity with the brotherly people of Haiti, as they \r\nseek to rebuild their country, and to express our deep \r\nsympathy to the victims of the natural disasters that \r\nhave afflicted China, India, Pakistan, Russia and other \r\nA/65/PV.22  \r\n \r\n10-55276 22 \r\n \r\ncountries, in particular in Africa. Millions of people \r\nworldwide continue to place their hopes in the United \r\nNations, and, as the community of nations, we do not \r\nhave the right to let them down. It is our obligation to \r\nguarantee sustainable development for future generations \r\nand to preserve them from the scourge of war. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Sergei Aleinik, Deputy Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Belarus. \r\n Mr. Aleinik (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): The \r\nnature of the discussions and decisions taken at the \r\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting has clearly demonstrated \r\nthat the various problems, challenges and threats we \r\nface, however difficult and dangerous they may be, can \r\nonly be overcome if we work together. The world has \r\nchanged significantly over the past 10 years, and our \r\ncapacity to make peoples’ lives in all continents better \r\nand safer has been broadened. We have seen the change \r\nin international relations. There has been an \r\nenhancement of constructive, mutually respectful \r\ndialogue between States, and a new global partnership \r\nis forming. All the preconditions exist so that at this \r\nsession we can establish a road map of international \r\ncooperation on all strategic issues referred to in the \r\nOutcome Document of the Summit. Particular attention \r\nshould be given to the financial economic sphere, \r\nbecause it is directly linked to achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. We can achieve those \r\nGoals, even in the current situation, if the necessary \r\nfinancial resources, skills and technologies are used to \r\nsupport development. What has been done so far is \r\ninsufficient. If we analyse the current situation in an \r\nobjective way, we see that the largest developed \r\ncountries have spent trillions of dollars on supporting \r\ntheir economies. This has given some results, but the \r\nbackdrop of this is that it has become clear that \r\nproviding resources for official development assistance \r\nand international technical assistance continues to be \r\nbelow the real needs of developing countries and \r\ncountries in transition. Developed countries have \r\nadopted protectionist measures. There has been price \r\npressure on small and medium countries for many \r\nsensitive categories of goods. In such a context, \r\nprogress towards the Millennium Development Goals \r\ncannot be smooth. \r\n In general terms, Belarus supports the work of the \r\nGroup of 20 (G-20) and the Group of Eight (G-8) to \r\novercome the world economic crisis, but we must \r\nassume that the major countries in these clubs will first \r\nand foremost promote their own interests. The General \r\nAssembly must take the necessary measures to improve \r\nthe economic toolbox of the entire United Nations \r\nsystem. Otherwise our Organization will not be able to \r\nplay an important role in global economic management \r\nand small and medium-sized countries will have no \r\nleverage on these processes. \r\n First of all, we must continue the process of \r\nupdating the work and enhancing the potential of the \r\nBretton Woods institutions and increase the role of \r\ndeveloping countries and countries with transitional \r\neconomies in decision-making in their governing \r\nbodies. The General Assembly, although it might not \r\nbe able directly to influence this process, must raise its \r\nvoice on this issue. We refer here to those bodies where \r\nall countries, without exception, can put forward their \r\npositions and submit appropriate proposals. \r\n In 2005 and 2006, significant efforts were made \r\nto improve the work of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil, converting it from a body that coordinates the \r\nwork of thematic commissions and committees in the \r\neconomic and social spheres to a body that adopts \r\npolitical decisions and recommendations in those areas. \r\nSome progress has been achieved here, of course; but it \r\nis insufficient if we want to reach by 2015 good \r\nindicators with regard to implementing the strategic \r\ntasks under the Millennium Development Goals. The \r\nEconomic and Social Council is still the same: it has \r\nnot become a full-fledged economic organ of the \r\nUnited Nations. We suggest in the remaining five years \r\nthat the Council should give special attention to each \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals and make \r\nappropriate recommendations to the General Assembly \r\nand to Member States.  \r\n Belarus, which has submitted its candidature for \r\nmembership of the Economic and Social Council in \r\n2011, is ready to work actively in this regard. \r\n We cannot attain the Millennium Development \r\nGoals unless we establish a genuine, strong structure of \r\nUnited Nations operational activities. Here, we \r\nwelcome the increased intergovernmental dialogue on \r\nenhancing coherence in the operations of United \r\nNations agencies and the measures that have been \r\ntaken to reform the United Nations gender architecture. \r\nBesides enhancing the institutions, the financing of \r\nbodies that undertake operational activities needs to be \r\nimproved. In this Hall, we have heard many addresses \r\nwith regard to the work of the G-8 and the G-20 and their \r\n A/65/PV.22\r\n \r\n23 10-55276 \r\n \r\ninitiative to find innovative approaches to financing. We \r\nhave heard of the intention of the European Union to \r\nmonitor the Union’s respect for its commitments with \r\nregard to official development assistance. We hope that \r\nthose measures will indeed be implemented. \r\n Belarus, like many other delegations in this room, \r\nis concerned at the status of the Doha multilateral trade \r\ntalks, particularly given the recent trends towards a \r\ntougher position by developed countries. Developing \r\ncountries in particular suffer from this, as do medium-\r\nincome countries. For more than 10 years, talks have \r\nbeen under way on membership of the World Trade \r\nOrganization (WTO) of about 30 States. Is this a \r\nnormal situation if we are talking about the need to \r\nensure that States move forward on achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and a genuinely \r\nmultilateral trade system? This is genuine \r\ndiscrimination against certain States. Therefore we \r\nbelieve that the rules for WTO membership by these \r\ncountries should be reviewed and simplified. \r\n If we are now serious about United Nations \r\nmanagement of global processes, then General \r\nAssembly resolutions on the role of international trade \r\nin stimulating development should be more targeted \r\ntowards achieving long-term results. What is most \r\nimportant is to make recommendations on urgent \r\ncollective measures to establish a multilateral trading \r\nsystem that meets the needs of today’s world. \r\n The General Assembly must send an unequivocal \r\npolitical signal to parties to the upcoming Cancún talks \r\non developing a new post-Kyoto international \r\nagreement on limiting emissions of greenhouse gases. \r\nThis year we have seen that the measures that have \r\nbeen taken have been inadequate. The virtual absence \r\nof targeted collective measures by the international \r\ncommunity could lead to irreversible consequences. If \r\nStates are ready to demonstrate genuine partnership in \r\norder to avoid the worst-case scenario, then the \r\nGeneral Assembly must adopt a resolution on the \r\nproblem of climate change and offer relevant \r\nrecommendations and proposals before the  \r\n29 November opening of the sixteenth Conference of \r\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change.  \r\n It is time to end competing ambitions with regard \r\nto climate change. Belarus has direct experience of the \r\nlow level of cooperation between countries and the \r\nlevel of their respect for each other’s interests. This has \r\nmeant that our attempts to adopt the most stringent \r\nvoluntary quantitative limits under the Kyoto Protocol, \r\nand thus to make our contribution to the common goal \r\nof protecting the climate, have so far been \r\nunsuccessful. Belarus’s amendment to Annex B of the \r\nKyoto Protocol has not yet entered into force. \r\n Closely related to protection of the climate is the \r\nissue of a reliable system of global energy security and \r\nthe development of so-called green economies. Many \r\nStates already have considerable experience in \r\nestablishing sustainable, low-carbon economies. Many \r\nStates still do not have clean technology, and this puts \r\na brake on their development. Of course, neither the \r\nUnited Nations system nor any other international \r\norganization can immediately resolve this problem on \r\nits own. Establishing a promising international \r\nmechanism of cooperation in order to enhance access \r\nto cutting-edge energy technologies, including \r\ntechnology for new and renewable energy sources, is \r\npossible only on the basis of a genuine partnership, \r\nwith leadership from the United Nations and from \r\nStates that have been most successful in developing \r\ngreen economies. \r\n Belarus has already made a significant \r\ncontribution to establishing such partnerships. We have \r\nestablished an international laboratory for renewable \r\nsources of energy based at the Energy Institute at the \r\nNational Academy of Sciences. This is first and \r\nforemost a platform for exchanging experiences with \r\nregard to renewable energy. This is no less important \r\nthan addressing the climatic conditions in our \r\ncountries; it will provide an experimental basis for \r\ndeveloping and testing effective uses of green \r\ntechnologies. Without any doubt this will make a \r\nsignificant contribution to developing global renewable \r\nenergy. We can only imagine how much progress the \r\ninternational community would make if each State in \r\nthe world would, within its means, contribute resources \r\nto the development of renewable energy, aimed not \r\nonly at its own domestic needs but also at exchanging \r\nexperiences with foreign colleagues. \r\n The MDG Summit confirmed the need for the \r\ninternational community to find longer-term solutions \r\nto problems. By following such an approach, States \r\nMembers of the United Nations will, as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has said, be able to provide a better future for \r\nall. Achieving this was the aim of the declaration by \r\nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belarus on \r\nestablishing a partnership with young people to protect \r\nA/65/PV.22  \r\n \r\n10-55276 24 \r\n \r\nthem from social decline; the theme of this partnership \r\nis helping future generations prosper. The theme of \r\nyoung people is not new in itself, and it has often been \r\ndiscussed in various forums. But implementing this \r\nidea would enable us to take a qualitative step forward \r\nin establishing a reliable basis for sustainable human \r\ndevelopment. We are convinced that Member States \r\nwill support the Belarus initiative to convene a \r\nthematic General Assembly debate on supporting \r\ntalented young people and protecting the coming \r\ngeneration from social decline. \r\n In April next year we will mark the twenty-fifth \r\nanniversary of the Chernobyl disaster. In the varied \r\nspectrum of contemporary challenges and threats the \r\nissue of Chernobyl has unfortunately become a low \r\npriority. But the objective situation is that the \r\nconsequences of that massive man-made disaster are \r\nstill being felt, which means that implementing the \r\nUnited Nations 10-year plan for recovery and long-\r\nterm development of the affected regions is still an \r\nurgent task. That is not just of concern to Belarus, \r\nRussia and Ukraine; the successful mitigation of the \r\nconsequences of Chernobyl is in the interests of the \r\nentire international community. \r\n Given that situation, Belarus, Russia and Ukraine \r\nintend to prepare a draft resolution on enhancing \r\ninternational cooperation and coordination of efforts in \r\norder to study, mitigate and minimize the consequences \r\nof the Chernobyl disaster. That is intended to further \r\nintensify measures to implement a plan of action and \r\ndraw the attention of the international community to \r\nthe memorial events planned for 2011 in the capitals of \r\nthe States most affected by the Chernobyl disaster. We \r\ncall for support for that draft resolution on Chernobyl \r\nin the General Assembly and for the traditional \r\nsolidarity with the most affected countries. \r\n This year the Republic of Belarus for the first \r\ntime became a participant in and donor to United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations. That again demonstrates that \r\nBelarus not only shares the purposes and principles of \r\nthe United Nations Charter but is making a tangible \r\ncontribution to strengthening international peace and \r\nsecurity. \r\n In conclusion, allow me to assure the Assembly \r\nthat our country will continue to play its part in \r\nenhancing the authority and increasing the institutional \r\ncapacity of the United Nations. Given its universal \r\nnature, the United Nations should guard and enhance \r\nits paramount role in the global management of peace \r\nprocesses, improve people’s lives and protect them \r\nfrom the threats and challenges of our unstable times. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Georges Rebelo Chikoti, Secretary of \r\nState for External Relations of the Republic of Angola. \r\n Mr. Chikoti (Angola) (spoke in Portuguese; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): First, I should \r\nlike to take this opportunity to congratulate the \r\nPresident on his election to the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fifth session and to \r\nassure him that he can count on the support of Angola \r\nso that at the end of this session we will all be better \r\nprepared to respond to the multiple and complex \r\nchallenges facing the international community. I also \r\ntake this opportunity to convey, though the President, \r\nour most sincere gratitude to the outgoing President for \r\nthe selfless manner in which he conducted the sixty-\r\nfourth session. \r\n In the last decade several events have profoundly \r\nmarked the world community, including natural \r\ncalamities and man-made disasters, which should lead \r\nus to consider the need to work towards a more \r\ncooperative and increasingly integrated world, for no \r\none is immune to those phenomena. The terrorist attack \r\nof 2001 on the Twin Towers of New York that killed \r\nmore than 3,000 people, the tsunami of December 2004 \r\nin which more than 200,000 people perished, the recent \r\nearthquake in Haiti that caused more than 200,000 \r\ndeaths, and the series of natural disasters that have \r\noccurred on every continent, added to the global \r\nfinancial and economic crisis, should awaken us to the \r\nfact that we live in a different world that requires \r\nbroader cooperation among nations, given that those \r\nphenomena are unforeseeable. \r\n Therefore, in today’s world, the consequences of \r\nthe irresponsibility of a few can have repercussions on \r\nthe lives of us all. It is thus imperative that we pursue \r\nrelationships that have greater balance and equality \r\nbetween large and small and rich and poor, because the \r\nnew reality is that we are increasingly interdependent \r\nin a global world. \r\n Angola, has always been convinced of the \r\nimportant role of the United Nations and of multilateral \r\ndiplomacy in general, because no country can progress \r\nand develop unilaterally, isolated from the community \r\nof nations and alienated from the common problems \r\naffecting humanity as a whole. \r\n A/65/PV.22\r\n \r\n25 10-55276 \r\n \r\n In the President’s speech to the General Assembly \r\non the occasion of his election (see A/64/PV.93), \r\namong other things he set the following topics as \r\npriorities for the sixty-fifth session: climate change, the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, food security, \r\nsustainable development, rebuilding and strengthening \r\nfragile post-conflict States, and humanitarian aid and \r\ndisarmament. Angola is of the opinion that the \r\nenvironment and other issues he mentioned must \r\nremain priorities on the national and international \r\nagendas. They are crucial for sustainable development, \r\nfor the growth of our economies, for the implementation \r\nof national strategies for combating poverty, and for \r\nthe attainment of the Millennium Goals.  \r\n At the Food and Agriculture Organization’s \r\nRegional Conference for Africa, held recently in \r\nLuanda, the participants expressed their concern about \r\nthe impact of climate change on the world food crisis \r\nin some regions and recommended that States make an \r\nextra effort to reduce its impact on agriculture. \r\n Angola believes in the importance of \r\nmultilateralism as the best form of treatment and \r\nresolution of the multifaceted challenges that humanity \r\nfaces today. In that context Angola advocates a shared \r\ncommitment to find solutions to our problems at all \r\nlevels. \r\n My country gives priority to political and \r\ndiplomatic coordination and to strengthening \r\ninstitutional relations with the organizations of the \r\nUnited Nations system, as well as with the regional and \r\nsubregional organizations to which it belongs, namely, \r\nthe African Union, the Southern African Development \r\nCommunity (SADC), the Economic Community of \r\nCentral African States (ECCAS), the International \r\nConference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) and \r\nthe Commission on the Gulf of Guinea, the latter \r\nhaving its headquarters in Angola. \r\n In the Commission on the Gulf of Guinea, \r\nmember States cooperate with a view to managing \r\npotential conflicts linked to maritime borders and \r\nmanaging shared maritime resources, as well as \r\ncoordinating policies for the prevention of maritime \r\ntrafficking and piracy, thus providing security to a \r\nregion that produces more than 15 per cent of the \r\nworld’s oil. \r\n With that motivation, Angola and its armed forces \r\nbravely participated in the liberation of southern \r\nAfrica, having contributed to the independence of \r\nNamibia and to the end of apartheid in South Africa. \r\nWith that same motivation we contributed to the \r\nstabilization of the Republic of Congo and the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. With other \r\ninternational partners of the United Nations, we are \r\nparticipating in the training of the armed forces of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo.  \r\n Today the Angolan armed forces are a factor for \r\nstability not only for Angola, but also for the southern \r\nand central regions of Africa, where we are part of the \r\nearly warning mechanisms of SADC and ECCAS. At \r\npresent we are committed to finding solutions to the \r\ncrisis in Guinea-Bissau, in close cooperation with other \r\npartners in West Africa, namely, the Economic \r\nCommunity of West African States, and in partnership \r\nwith the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries. \r\n It was therefore with great amazement that we \r\nlearned of the mention of involvement by the Angolan \r\narmed forces in alleged acts of human rights violations \r\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo in a report \r\nintended to be circulated as a document of the High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights. We stress that that \r\ndocument was produced at the initiative of an organ of \r\nthe United Nations Secretariat with no specific mandate \r\nfrom the Secretary-General or from Member States.  \r\n It is important to emphasize before the Assembly \r\nthat Angola intervened in the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo on the basis of a SADC mandate, at the \r\nrequest of the Government of the Democratic Republic. \r\nThat intervention made it possible to stop the \r\nbloodbath and to save the lives of millions of people \r\nand lay the basis for the negotiations that culminated in \r\nthe establishment of the transitional Government, the \r\ninstallation of the United Nations peacekeeping \r\nmission and the successful holding of the first \r\ndemocratic elections. It thus contributed to the \r\npacification of the Great Lakes region. \r\n Angola vehemently rejects the insinuation and \r\nconsiders abnormal the manner in which that so-called \r\nmapping exercise was conducted. We question the \r\nmotivations behind that venture. We would like to \r\nreiterate that Angola and the Angolan armed forces will \r\ncontinue to act responsibly and on the basis of \r\ninternational standards and scrupulous respect for \r\nhuman rights. \r\n The report of the Secretary-General to the sixty-\r\nfifth session contains references to peace and security, \r\nconsidering them essential for development and for the \r\nA/65/PV.22  \r\n \r\n10-55276 26 \r\n \r\npromotion of and respect for human rights. Angola \r\nshares the concerns of the Secretary-General. Our \r\nexperience shows that only peace, the democratic rule \r\nof law and respect for human rights can guarantee the \r\nstability necessary for sustainable development and \r\nimprovement of the living conditions of our people. \r\nAngola encourages the efforts by regional organizations \r\nand the United Nations in conflict resolution and \r\npeacekeeping to ensure global security and stability. \r\n A situation that is certainly of concern to all of us \r\nis the conflict in the Middle East. Angola recognizes \r\nthat it has lasted a long time, with serious \r\nconsequences for the population. Therefore we support \r\nthe resumption of peace talks by President Barack \r\nObama with a view to creating a Palestinian State that \r\ncoexists peacefully with the State of Israel. \r\n Angola is also concerned at the persistence of the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial blockade against \r\nCuba, despite successive General Assembly resolutions \r\ndemanding its immediate removal. That unilateral \r\nmeasure, particularly its extraterritorial effects, is \r\ncontrary to the principles and norms of international \r\nlaw and contributes to the precarious humanitarian and \r\nsocial situation of the Cuban population. From this \r\nrostrum we reiterate our vehement appeal for the lifting \r\nof a measure whose anachronistic nature has been \r\nrestated here on numerous occasions. \r\n Regarding the question of Western Sahara, \r\nAngola notes with concern that despite various United \r\nNations resolutions and initiatives, there has not been \r\nthe type of progress that would lead to meeting the \r\naspirations of the Saharan people. We urge the \r\nSecretary-General to continue his efforts to attain those \r\nobjectives. \r\n Mutually beneficial cooperation, the promotion of \r\npeace and respect for human rights remain the major \r\ndrivers of Angolan foreign policy, based on the \r\nobservance of the principles of respect for sovereignty \r\nand territorial integrity, equality and non-interference \r\nin the internal affairs of other countries.  \r\n Internally, and as a result of experiences during \r\ndifferent periods in our history, marked by three \r\ndecades of war and political instability, Angola is now \r\nentering a new cycle, of which we are very proud. It is \r\ncharacterized by the adoption of a new constitution that \r\nmarks the end of the transition period and definitively \r\nestablishes democratic rule of law, given that elections \r\nwill be held in June 2012. \r\n We are aware that we still have a long way to go, \r\nespecially in view of all the time lost and the delays \r\naccumulated in several areas. But it seems important to \r\nus to emphasize that the progress already achieved did \r\nnot happen by chance. Rather, it resulted from the \r\nleadership efforts of the Angolan executive organs, the \r\npragmatism of its policies and its commitment to better \r\nthe human development indexes, which are reflected \r\ntoday in the improved welfare of the people. \r\n After eight years of peace, Angola has \r\nimplemented economic and social reform policies that \r\nhave allowed for the revitalization of its economy and \r\nthe rehabilitation of key infrastructure. Such policies \r\nhave enabled the country’s annual growth rates to \r\naverage double digits, with a direct impact on the \r\nimprovement of basic indicators of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals.  \r\n Since 2002 more than 2 million children have \r\nbeen enrolled in primary education. The percentage of \r\nchildren attending school has risen sharply, to 76 per \r\ncent. The rate of infant and maternal mortality fell \r\nconsiderably, from 1,400 per 100,000 live births in \r\n2001 to 660 per 100,000 live births in 2010. Moreover, \r\nin order to eradicate hunger and poverty, Angola has \r\nadopted its National Food Security Strategy (2009-\r\n2014) as a mechanism to increase agricultural \r\nproduction in a sustainable manner. \r\n We are convinced that the international \r\ncommunity is also aware of how much still has to be \r\ndone, particularly in the areas of financing for \r\ndevelopment and the materialization of the \r\ncommitments made at major international conferences \r\non financing for development. \r\n Finally, the reform of the Security Council, given \r\nits importance in the democratization of international \r\nrelations, must remain a topic on the agenda of the \r\nOrganization. In that connection, Angola reiterates its \r\nsupport for the African common position embodied in \r\nthe Ezulwini Consensus. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Claude Heller, chair of the \r\ndelegation of the United Mexican States. \r\n Mr. Heller (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): Let me \r\nbegin by conveying the warm congratulations of the \r\ndelegation of Mexico to Mr. Joseph Deiss on his \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at this \r\nnew session. I also wish to express our appreciation to \r\n A/65/PV.22\r\n \r\n27 10-55276 \r\n \r\nhis predecessor, Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, for his \r\nwork, and our appreciation and support to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his efforts for peace and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n The recent high-level meetings have shown the \r\nmagnitude of the challenges that confront the \r\ninternational community and thus the United Nations. \r\nThe obstacles to achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, the economic crisis in all its \r\nmanifestations, the disasters associated with climate \r\nchange, the continuing threats to peace and security — \r\nin either their traditional or new forms — and the \r\ndifficulties in effectively addressing nuclear \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation define the agenda \r\nof multilateral institutions and of the policies of our \r\nGovernments.  \r\n Nevertheless, the primary responsibility of this \r\nOrganization is the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security. Years of war and conflict on every \r\ncontinent, with enormous loss of lives and significant \r\neconomic and social costs, have tested the ability of the \r\nUnited Nations to prevent, contain and reverse armed \r\nconflicts.  \r\n That is the case in Afghanistan and Iraq, where \r\nafter years of conflicts and interventions there is still \r\nhope that those countries will be able to fully assume \r\ntheir own destiny without outside interference. In \r\nSomalia and the Sudan the prospects for peaceful \r\nsettlements and reconciliation still seem to be distant, \r\nrequiring the will of the parties and careful monitoring \r\nby the international community to prevent the \r\nescalation, the extension, of the crises and to ensure the \r\nprotection of the civilian population. \r\n In the Democratic Republic of the Congo \r\nimpunity prevails, and despite the presence of United \r\nNations forces, outrageous and unacceptable crimes are \r\ncommitted against civilians, particularly women and \r\nchildren. The reconstruction of Haiti after the terrible \r\nearthquake last January, which even affected United \r\nNations personnel, is taking place under dramatic \r\nconditions. \r\n The list of challenges is endless, and indeed there \r\nis the risk of a backsliding and escalation of violence \r\nin several critical regions of the world. \r\n In the Middle East, despite 60 years of conflict \r\nand scepticism due to past failures, there is renewed \r\nhope for peace, thanks to the resumption of direct talks \r\nbetween the Government of Israel and the Palestinian \r\nAuthority. The creation of a politically and economically \r\nviable Palestinian State, living in peace side by side with \r\nIsrael, within secure and internationally recognized \r\nborders, is an essential condition for the establishment \r\nof lasting peace in the Middle East. We particularly \r\nwelcome the efforts of the Administration of President \r\nBarack Obama to achieve that goal. \r\n Mexico expresses its strong support for the \r\nongoing negotiations. Nonetheless, the hope of a \r\ndefinitive agreement is marred by the threats and \r\nprovocations of extremist forces that seek to derail \r\ndirect negotiations. The leaders of Israel and the \r\nPalestinian Authority have an appointment with \r\nhistory. Let us hope that they are up to the challenge. \r\nTo that end they can count on the unstinting support of \r\nStates genuinely committed to the peace process. \r\n The existence of weapons of mass destruction \r\nremains a threat to humanity and increases global \r\ninsecurity. In 2010, significant progress has been made \r\nin the areas of disarmament and non-proliferation, and \r\nthe international community has renewed its \r\ncommitment to nuclear safety. The signing of the new \r\nstrategic arms reduction treaty between the United \r\nStates and Russia, the nuclear summit held in \r\nWashington and the outcome of the Review Conference \r\nof the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons (NPT) are achievements that must be \r\ncommended. We cannot ignore that the credibility and \r\nviability of the disarmament agenda depend on the \r\nuniversalization of the NPT and the entry into force of \r\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. The \r\ncreation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East \r\nwould constitute a parallel and decisive step in that \r\nregard. \r\n With regard to the cases of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea and Iran, it will be \r\nnecessary to move forward through dialogue and \r\nnegotiation in order to resolve the controversies arising \r\nfrom their nuclear programmes. The adoption of \r\nsanctions is not incompatible with the recourse to \r\ndiplomacy, which is still ongoing. \r\n However, international security does not depend \r\nexclusively on the elimination of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction. It is also threatened by the existence of \r\nsmall arms and light weapons and their illicit \r\ntrafficking, which fuel conflicts, claim the lives of \r\nthousands of people and destabilize our societies. It is \r\nA/65/PV.22  \r\n \r\n10-55276 28 \r\n \r\ntime to tackle that challenge head on, implementing the \r\nProgramme of Action on illicit trafficking in small \r\narms and light weapons and progressing towards the \r\nadoption of an arms trade treaty. \r\n With regard to development, the consequences of \r\nthe recent international economic and financial crisis, \r\ncaused largely by the failure of the regulatory \r\nmechanisms and the excessive indebtedness of the \r\nworld’s major economies, are still being suffered \r\nworldwide. \r\n The failures that led to this crisis must be \r\naddressed, and the United Nations must be able to play \r\na significant role in that undertaking. The crisis \r\ndemonstrated the need to promote international \r\ncooperation schemes that would allow us to act \r\neffectively and efficiently to meet the challenges \r\narising from it. In particular, it is worth highlighting \r\nthe positive work of the Group of 20 in this regard. \r\nHowever, we also believe that the United Nations \r\nshould play a more relevant role in the discussions on \r\nnecessary international economic governance reform. \r\nIn this sense, we share the objectives set by the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly. \r\n In this context, the prospects for achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals have been severely \r\nhampered by the crisis. Thus, the commitments in \r\nofficial development assistance made at the Monterrey \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment and endorsed at the 2008 Doha Follow-\r\nup Conference have been jeopardized. These \r\ncommitments must be honoured. The Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals can be attained in all countries if \r\nwe take appropriate individual and collective action, as \r\nindicated in resolution 65/1, adopted at the High-level \r\nPlenary Meeting held here at Headquarters last week. It \r\nis also indispensable that we progress towards the \r\nsuccessful conclusion of the Doha Round of trade \r\nnegotiations, fully respecting its linkage with the \r\ndevelopment agenda. \r\n In addition to the traditional challenges, our \r\nOrganization faces new challenges that test its ability \r\nto react and adapt. Terrorism, on the one hand, and the \r\nglobalization of transnational organized crime on the \r\nother, including drug trafficking, pose new threats to \r\npeace and security that destabilize entire countries and \r\nregions, modifying the traditional notion of \r\ninternational security. The fight against these \r\nphenomena is not the exclusive responsibility of one \r\nparticular country or region; these are global \r\nphenomena that must be addressed and resolved by the \r\ninternational community based on the fundamental \r\nprinciple of shared responsibility. We cannot ignore the \r\nfact that the permissive social behaviour in some \r\ncountries stimulates illicit activities in others. \r\n The Government of Mexico has assumed full \r\nresponsibility for meeting the challenges posed by drug \r\ntrafficking and activities related to organized crime, \r\nrestoring State authority in areas where impunity had \r\nprevailed. This fight requires an increased investment \r\nof resources and has unfortunately also led to the loss \r\nof lives. The cost is high, but would be even higher for \r\nour society if the authority of the State remained \r\nimpassive in the face of violence, corruption and the \r\naccompanying impunity. Compliance with international \r\ncommitments in the area of drug trafficking is \r\nindispensable in order to meet this challenge. \r\n Migration is a reality of our contemporary world \r\nthat cannot be ignored by our Organization. Its \r\nmultidimensional nature obliges us to consider its \r\ncauses and effects from an international perspective. \r\nThe migratory phenomenon should be addressed \r\nthrough a holistic approach that recognizes the \r\ncontribution of migrants to the countries of origin and \r\nof destination alike, among other factors. In November, \r\nMexico will host the fourth meeting of the Global \r\nForum on Migration and Development, the outcome of \r\nwhich will be duly reported to this Assembly. \r\n The Government of Mexico is committed to the \r\npromotion of human rights of all migrants, irrespective \r\nof their migratory status. We call on all Member States \r\nto ratify the International Convention on the Protection \r\nof the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of \r\nTheir Families. Unfortunately, the tendency to criminalize \r\ninternational migration has prevailed. Legislative \r\ninitiatives and actions singling out minorities in various \r\ncountries unacceptably codify racism and xenophobia, \r\nestablishing new barriers between communities and \r\nnations. This is unacceptable. \r\n Mexico, a country of origin, transit and \r\ndestination for migrants, has experienced within its \r\nborders the consequences of the exploitation and \r\nviolence perpetrated by organized criminal gangs that \r\nnot only smuggle people from different countries, but \r\nhave not hesitated to cruelly threaten their lives, as was \r\nthe very regrettable case in our country in August. The \r\ncompetent authorities, in coordination with the \r\n A/65/PV.22\r\n \r\n29 10-55276 \r\n \r\nGovernments of which the individuals concerned were \r\nnationals, are investigating this case and establishing \r\nthe necessary coordination mechanisms to prevent \r\nsimilar events in the future and to attend more \r\neffectively to the protection of migrants, regardless of \r\ntheir origin and legal status. \r\n Nature also poses new challenges. We cannot \r\nafford to remain idle in the face of the adverse effects \r\nof climate change. The economic and human costs of \r\nnot addressing this problem are enormous and \r\nnegatively affect the welfare and well-being of present \r\nand future generations. As host of the sixteenth \r\nConference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change and of the \r\nsixth Conference of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, \r\nto be held later this year in Cancún, Mexico is making \r\nevery possible effort in a transparent, inclusive and \r\nresponsible manner to achieve concrete and operational \r\nresults. In Cancún, we will be able to adopt a broad and \r\nbalanced set of decisions for immediate \r\nimplementation. One single action or agreement is not \r\nenough to address such a complex phenomenon. The \r\ninternational regime on this matter should evolve \r\nconstantly in response to technological and socio-\r\neconomic developments and on the basis of common \r\nbut differentiated responsibility. \r\n The main advantage of our Organization among \r\nthe multilateral institutions is its universal character. \r\nIts Charter enshrines the commitments that States have \r\nmade in all these aspects. Thus, United Nations actions \r\nare fully legitimate, in accordance with international \r\nlaw. However, we cannot ignore the difficulties that the \r\nOrganization faces without running the risk of its \r\nbecoming increasingly less capable of addressing the \r\nenormous challenges facing the international \r\ncommunity. Its decisions, including those that are \r\nlegally binding, are difficult to implement and its \r\nresources fall short of meeting the many needs that \r\narise in the maintenance of peace and in addressing \r\nnatural and humanitarian disasters. The Organization’s \r\nbudget and scale of assessments do not reflect the \r\nrealities of our countries. \r\n As a result, the comprehensive reform of the \r\nOrganization can be put off no longer; if it is, alternative \r\nforums or more selective groups will fill the vacuum \r\ncreated by our Organization’s lack of effectiveness. Our \r\nOrganization requires comprehensive reform, ranging \r\nfrom the adaptation and representativeness of the Security \r\nCouncil to greater coherence in activities for sustainable \r\ndevelopment. In 2011, the General Assembly will \r\nconsider the status of the Human Rights Council, while \r\nthe Council itself will review its own working methods. \r\nWe must ensure that the outcome of both processes \r\nresults in the increased effectiveness of its work. \r\n With respect to peacekeeping, difficulties on the \r\nground and the need to adapt operation mandates \r\nrequire the Security Council and the Organization as a \r\nwhole to elaborate pragmatic actions and strategies that \r\nwill produce results in the short term. Security Council \r\nreform may be the most urgent. Mexico has \r\nparticipated in the process of intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, convinced of the need for comprehensive \r\nreform to improve the Council’s representativeness, \r\ntransparency, democracy and accountability. This \r\nprocess is relevant to all States, and Security Council \r\nreform can be neither determined nor addressed in \r\nalternative forums that have an eminently financial \r\npurview. This much-needed and urgent reform will not \r\nbe achieved by imposing the aspirations of a few on \r\nthe collective will. \r\n As an elected member of the Security Council for \r\nthe biennium 2009-2010, Mexico has been able to \r\nappreciate the constructive role that non-permanent \r\nmembers can play through their contributions to the \r\nwork of the Council and its subsidiary bodies. \r\nNevertheless, we are also aware of their limitations. \r\nThe short duration of their mandates impedes the \r\nconsolidation of achievements and affects the \r\ncontinuity of the work of the Council itself. We are \r\ntherefore convinced that the principle of immediate  \r\nre-election or of longer-term seats for non-permanent \r\nmembers are the best options for pragmatic and viable \r\nSecurity Council reform in the short term.  \r\n Mexico’s participation in the Security Council \r\nhas been guided by its conviction of the importance of \r\nthe contribution that elected members can make to the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, in the \r\nunderstanding that this is a shared responsibility in \r\naccordance with obligations under the United Nations \r\nCharter and not the monopoly of a few. In this sense, \r\nwe have been able to encourage mediation and the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes; promote disarmament \r\nand non-proliferation; preserve respect for \r\ninternational humanitarian law; ensure the protection \r\nof the civilian population in armed conflicts, with \r\nspecial emphasis on children; strengthen the rule of \r\nlaw; and foster activities to promote stability and \r\nreconstruction in States emerging from conflict. \r\nA/65/PV.22  \r\n \r\n10-55276 30 \r\n \r\n This year, Mexico celebrates its bicentennial as \r\nan independent nation and the centenary of its \r\nrevolution, the first of the great social revolutions of \r\nthe twentieth century. From our own experience, we \r\nare well aware of the difficulties and obstacles facing \r\nthe construction of any nation-State in a complex and \r\nchanging world. Throughout its history, our country’s \r\ninteraction with the world at large has been fraught. \r\nOur country has experienced external interventions, \r\noccupations and even losses of its territory during \r\nperiods of political instability. We have been able \r\nnonetheless to forge a national identity and unique \r\nprofile in contemporary international relations. \r\n Today, Mexico is a constructive and open \r\ncountry, peaceful and fully committed to forging \r\nagreements for a better world. As a founding Member \r\nof our Organization, we have been loyal to its \r\npurposes, consistent with the principles of foreign \r\npolicy enshrined in our Constitution. Our adherence to \r\ninternational law and the contributions of Mexican \r\nforeign policy to various fields are well known. We \r\nhave also learned to appreciate the importance of \r\ninternational cooperation inasmuch as there is no \r\nchallenge on the United Nations agenda that can be \r\ntackled in isolation. The survival of humankind, given \r\nthe dangers of nuclear war, combating the effects of \r\nclimate change, overcoming social regression, and the \r\nrelentless fight against new threats to international \r\nsecurity and to our own societies require our greatest \r\nindividual efforts as well as coordination among States. \r\nMexico will therefore remain deeply committed to \r\nmultilateralism, of which this universal forum is the \r\nfirst and foremost expression. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency, Mr. Carsten Staur, chair of the \r\ndelegation of the Kingdom of Denmark. \r\n Mr. Staur (Denmark): The world is undergoing \r\nprofound changes. Globalization is progressing at an \r\nunprecedented speed. The boundaries between \r\ndomestic and foreign policy are evolving. \r\nDevelopments in one region of the world may trigger \r\nunintended actions in other parts of the world. New \r\nactors — for good or for bad — have stepped on to the \r\ninternational scene. The world is now on the way to \r\nrecovery from the financial and economic crises of \r\nrecent years. More structural challenges, such as \r\nclimate change, poverty and demographic projections, \r\nas well as new security threats, however, will \r\nincreasingly impact the global agenda. If we are to \r\nrespond to such challenges, we need an effective \r\nmultilateral system founded on universal rules and \r\nvalues and on global legitimacy. Here, we turn to the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n With the Lisbon Treaty in force, the European \r\nUnion has established the necessary structures to take \r\non the challenges of the twenty-first century and has \r\nenhanced its capacity as a global player. We look \r\nforward to seeing this reflected in the future position of \r\nthe European Union in the United Nations, and we \r\nregret that it has not been possible to come to an \r\nagreement on this issue (see A/64/PV.122). The \r\nEuropean Union will retain observer status at the \r\nGeneral Assembly. The main effect of the draft \r\nresolution will be to enable the European Union’s new \r\npermanent interlocutors to represent the European \r\nUnion effectively in the General Assembly, speaking \r\non behalf of the European Union and of its member \r\nStates, as agreed by them. The European Union has a \r\nclear commitment to effective multilateralism, with the \r\nUnited Nations at its core. \r\n One of the most significant global challenges \r\ntoday is to fulfil the promises of the Millennium \r\nDeclaration (resolution 55/2) for a better world for \r\neveryone. With last week’s Millennium Development \r\nGoals summit, a new momentum has been built — a \r\nmomentum for action, for the implementation of \r\ncommitments and for focusing our common efforts to \r\nreach the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by \r\n2015. Five years is not a long time, especially when we \r\nalso need to overcome the effects of the financial and \r\neconomic crisis. But our task is clear. We must make \r\nthe MDGs a reality for all. We need to accelerate \r\nprogress and scale up our efforts where approaches \r\nhave proven to be successful. We have to be \r\ninnovative. Developing countries must focus their \r\npolitical will, administrative capacity and budgetary \r\nresources on reaching the MDGs, while we as donors \r\nmust live up to and fulfil our official development \r\nassistance commitments. \r\n We have clear evidence that fragile and conflict-\r\naffected countries are lagging behind the most with \r\nregard to the achievement of the MDGs. The \r\ncomparative advantage of the United Nations system \r\nand its unique possibilities in combining humanitarian, \r\npeacekeeping, peacebuilding, recovery and development \r\napproaches are especially relevant in relation to these \r\ncountries. We strongly encourage the ongoing efforts to \r\nstrengthen the United Nations role in this regard. We \r\n A/65/PV.22\r\n \r\n31 10-55276 \r\n \r\nwelcome the Secretary-General’s steps to strengthen \r\nthe peacebuilding architecture, but more work is \r\nneeded in areas such as strengthened integrated \r\nmissions, improving in-country leadership, and \r\nstrengthening the Peacebuilding Support Office in \r\norder to forward the peacebuilding agenda. \r\n Green growth is an important challenge that \r\noffers new opportunities for employment, innovation \r\nand wealth creation in developed and developing \r\ncountries alike. Together, we must strive to optimize \r\nresource efficiency and apply green technologies. \r\nRenewable energy is a good example of how new \r\ntechnologies can contribute to development by \r\nproviding secure, sustainable and affordable energy to \r\nmillions of people. Green growth is not an obstacle to \r\ndevelopment but an opportunity. We must unite our \r\nefforts to take this agenda forward in the immediate \r\nfuture and in preparation for the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development in May 2012. \r\n Climate change continues to be one of the \r\ngreatest and most pressing challenges of our time, and \r\nwe are already starting to experience the consequences — \r\nfrom melting icecaps in the Arctic, heatwaves in Russia \r\nand floods in Pakistan to droughts in Africa. It \r\nconcerns all of us, and concerted and urgent action is \r\nneeded. The Copenhagen Accord contains delicate \r\npolitical compromises, paving the way for eventually \r\nreaching a global, legally binding international \r\nagreement within the United Nations framework. More \r\nthan 130 countries, covering more than 80 per cent of \r\nglobal emissions, have now associated themselves with \r\nthe Accord reached in Copenhagen in December last \r\nyear. We underline the importance of the commitments \r\non fast-start financing, which must be fulfilled. We are \r\nlooking forward to the sixteenth Conference of the \r\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change in Cancún, Mexico, and hoping for \r\na successful outcome that will significantly advance \r\nnegotiations on climate change. \r\n In the ever more interdependent and ever more \r\nuncertain world we live in, it is of priority to uphold \r\nthe principles, objectives, universal rights and \r\nfundamental values that are enshrined in the United \r\nNations Charter and that form the very basis for global \r\nstability, development and global prosperity. \r\nStrengthening the mutual understanding between \r\ncultures is an important challenge and a valuable \r\nopportunity for all of us. \r\n During the past month, we have witnessed just \r\nhow important it is to maintain mutual respect and \r\nunderstanding. As history has taught us, there are \r\nalways those who are ready to do the unthinkable in \r\norder to catch the attention of the international media. \r\nThe threats to burn the Koran in Florida were a \r\nparticularly repulsive example of this phenomenon. We \r\nstrongly condemn such acts, but as we have learned, \r\nthe more attention we give such individual acts of \r\nprovocation, the more they will multiply. We must \r\nnever allow such acts to steer our steps from the path \r\nof dialogue. We must stand firmly and jointly against \r\nany call to strife and violence. \r\n States must ensure the human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms of their citizens in order for \r\neach individual to take an active part in shaping his or \r\nher own future to the benefit and prosperity of all. \r\nWomen’s rights and gender issues are an essential part \r\nof human rights. The women’s rights agenda supports \r\nand strengthens the overall effort of human rights’ \r\nimplementation. International peace and security rest \r\nupon the ability and willingness of States to ensure the \r\nprotection of their populations from human rights \r\nviolations and atrocity crimes. \r\n In this context, I welcome the ongoing debate \r\namong Member States on the responsibility to protect. \r\nDenmark will take an active part in the further \r\ndevelopment of this concept, which provides the \r\nframework for a comprehensive approach. It is closely \r\nlinked to another key Danish priority — that of \r\nstrengthening the rule of law. Be it at the global, \r\nregional or national level, the rule of law provides \r\ntransparency and accountability and thereby leads to \r\nbetter governance. The establishment of the office of \r\nOmbudsperson in relation to the Security Council \r\nCommittee established pursuant to resolution 1267 \r\n(1999) was a successful example of our work at the \r\nglobal level. \r\n Piracy off the coast of Somalia presents a \r\nregional challenge that Denmark — through its naval \r\nefforts off Somalia and its chairmanship of the legal \r\nworking group of the Contact Group on Piracy off the \r\nCoast of Somalia — is committed to meeting. At the \r\nnational level Denmark, in close cooperation with \r\npartner countries, provides hundreds of millions of \r\ndollars to strengthen legal systems and judicial \r\ncapacities throughout the world. Let me stress here that \r\nour support for the International Criminal Court in no \r\nway springs from a wish for the Court to prosecute all \r\nA/65/PV.22  \r\n \r\n10-55276 32 \r\n \r\ninternational crimes. National jurisdictions are almost \r\nalways better placed to combat impunity, and through \r\nour rule of law programmes we seek to promote true \r\nnational ownership and complementarity for those able \r\nand willing to face the hard choices. \r\n The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \r\nis the most serious danger emanating from \r\nglobalization. Following many years of deadlock, \r\nhowever, 2010 has been a year of progress. We \r\nwelcome the international momentum in dealing with \r\nthe issue of nuclear weapons as reflected in the New \r\nSTART agreement between the United States and the \r\nRussian Federation, the nuclear summit and, notably, \r\nthe results of the Review Conference of the States \r\nParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) here in New York in May. It is \r\nimportant that all States parties commit to \r\nimplementing the measures of the NPT action plan.  \r\n The issue of non-proliferation remains high on \r\nthe agenda, not least due to our deepening concerns \r\nabout the allegedly peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear \r\nprogramme. With the adoption of Security Council \r\nresolution 1929 (2010), the international community \r\nhas sent a clear signal to the Iranian leadership that we \r\ndo not tolerate the continuous and increasingly grave \r\nflouting of Iran’s international obligations. It is hoped \r\nthat this resolution will help to convince Iran to change \r\nits current path and enter into negotiations. \r\n I should like to take this opportunity to welcome \r\nthe parliamentary elections in Afghanistan earlier this \r\nmonth, which represent yet another step on \r\nAfghanistan’s road towards democracy. The elections \r\ncame after the successful outcome of the Kabul \r\nConference. We look forward to the implementation of \r\nthe Conference initiatives leading to the transition to \r\nfull Afghan ownership in all areas. \r\n The international community and the United \r\nNations must continue to play a supporting role in \r\nAfghanistan in the years to come. In this context, \r\nDenmark believes there needs to be a coordinated \r\ncivilian and military engagement in Afghanistan as a \r\nprecondition for success. The regional aspects also \r\nneed to be addressed. In this context, my thoughts go \r\nto the people and the Government of Pakistan, who \r\nhave not only experienced sacrifices due to terrorism, \r\nbut also heavy losses and suffering due to the \r\nunprecedented flooding of the country. Denmark has \r\ncommitted more than $45 million in assistance to \r\nPakistan so far this year. \r\n Denmark welcomes the recent relaunch of direct \r\nnegotiations between the leaders of Israel and the \r\nPalestinian Authority on reaching an agreement on all \r\nthe core issues within one year. We also welcome the \r\nQuartet’s statement encouraging these negotiations. \r\nThey will be difficult, but we believe that an agreement \r\nis possible and that it is in the interest not only of \r\nIsraelis and Palestinians, but also of the peoples in the \r\nregion and beyond. We strongly support the United \r\nStates efforts to facilitate the negotiations, and we call \r\non the parties to negotiate in good faith and to live up \r\nto their obligations. The direct peace talks actualize the \r\nimportance of enhanced international political and \r\nfinancial support for Palestinian State-building. \r\nDenmark and the European Union stand ready to assist \r\nin fulfilling the goals of two States for two peoples \r\nliving side by side in peace and security. \r\n Peace needs to be secured in all parts of the \r\nworld. In this context, the implementation of the 2005 \r\nComprehensive Peace Agreement is vital to the future \r\nof the Sudan. The international community needs to \r\nsupport the referendum process to secure inclusive, \r\nfree and transparent elections. Without prejudging the \r\noutcome of the referendum, I should like to stress the \r\nimportance of developing institutional capacity and of \r\ncreating more self-sustainability in South Sudan. \r\nLikewise, we are very concerned about the \r\nhumanitarian situation in many parts of the country. \r\nFocus should be on securing access to all areas for \r\nhumanitarian workers and international peacekeepers. \r\nIn Somalia, the focus must be on the need to support \r\nthe Transitional Federal Government and improve the \r\ncoordination of assistance, including within the United \r\nNations system. \r\n The best way to deal with these global challenges \r\nis through an effective and strong multilateral system — \r\nthrough a strong United Nations system. The ability of \r\nthe United Nations effectively and efficiently to deal \r\nwith the global challenges of the twenty-first century \r\nmust be improved. Continuing the paths of system-\r\nwide coherence and delivering as one is part of that. \r\nReforms of the intergovernmental machinery and of the \r\nworkings of the Secretariat must also be pursued. We \r\nwelcome the ongoing intergovernmental negotiations \r\non Security Council reform aimed at changing the \r\nmembership in order to reflect the world of today. Let \r\nme take this opportunity to welcome the establishment \r\n A/65/PV.22\r\n \r\n33 10-55276 \r\n \r\nof UN Women and the appointment of Ms. Michelle \r\nBachelet of Chile as the first Under-Secretary-General \r\nand head of that agency. We have high expectations \r\nthat the new entity will contribute to streamlining in \r\nthe area of gender, women’s rights and development \r\nthroughout the United Nations system. \r\n In the area of peacekeeping we commend \r\ninitiatives, such as New Horizon, to readjust United \r\nNations peacekeeping efforts in light of the experiences \r\ngathered during the last decade of immense growth in \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations. \r\n Let me conclude by emphasizing that today’s \r\nworld is more complex than ever. But on so many \r\nissues, countries want to work together towards long-\r\nlasting solutions. More often than not, they turn to the \r\nUnited Nations to find answers. They turn to an \r\ninternational body whose strength has been and still is \r\nbased on its unique global legitimacy. Hence they, and \r\nwe, expect the United Nations to live up to \r\nexpectations, to perform, to show leadership and to \r\npush the envelope. Global challenges call for global \r\nanswers. The United Nations must live up to this call, \r\nfulfilling the aspirations of the Charter. No less will do \r\nfor the twenty-first century. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Michel Kafando, chair of the \r\ndelegation of Burkina Faso. \r\n Mr. Kafando (Burkina Faso) (spoke in French): \r\nAt the outset, may I, on behalf of my delegation, \r\ncongratulate Mr. Joseph Deiss sincerely and warmly on \r\nhis election to the presidency of the General Assembly \r\nat this sixty-fifth session. I assure him of our support to \r\nensure a successful session. May I also extend my deepest \r\ngratitude to his predecessor, Mr. Ali Treki, who so \r\neffectively led the work of the sixty-fourth session. I extend \r\nmy thanks to the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for \r\nhis commitment and resolve in defending the ideals of the \r\nCharter. \r\n The sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly is \r\ntaking place in a difficult international environment, \r\ncharacterized by multiple crises of all kinds — \r\neconomic, financial, food, energy, and so forth. This is \r\nalso a time when the international community is \r\nwondering whether it really will be able to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. \r\nFrom that standpoint, fortunately, the recent High-level \r\nPlenary Meeting on the MDGs held here gives hope \r\nthat the commitments made to the poorest populations \r\nwill be implemented so that the world can take on a \r\nmore human face and focus on social and economic \r\nwell-being, particularly of the most disadvantaged. \r\nHowever, that will be possible only in a healthy and \r\ncalm environment.  \r\n We therefore welcome once again the Climate \r\nChange Conference held in Copenhagen in December \r\n2009. Even if it was not able to agree on a figure for \r\nreducing greenhouse gases, it nevertheless pushed \r\nforward the debate on providing assistance to the most \r\nvulnerable countries and on measures to reduce \r\ndeforestation. We only hope that the commitments \r\nmade, particularly in the financial area, will be \r\nhonoured, and we ardently hope that the forthcoming \r\nmeeting in Cancún will yield a viable environmental \r\nagreement. Such an agreement is all the more urgent in \r\nthat flooding and other climate disasters occurring \r\nthroughout the world with unbridled cruelty remind us \r\nof the great fragility of the environmental balance. \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n Turning to peace and security, conflict resolution \r\nthroughout the world and particularly in Africa, which \r\nis most directly concerned, remains a major challenge \r\nfor the international community. While some crises \r\nhave been more or less overcome, for example in West \r\nAfrica, others continue to be a matter of serious \r\nconcern. In Togo, open, free and transparent elections \r\nwere able to be held this year to everybody’s \r\nsatisfaction. Burkina Faso welcomes the ongoing \r\npolitical openness and appeals to that country’s \r\npartners to continue providing it with the necessary \r\nsupport. In Côte d’Ivoire, major progress was made \r\nwith the effective disarmament of the Forces nouvelles, \r\nthe publication of the electoral list and the scheduling \r\nof the first round of presidential elections for 31 \r\nOctober. We trust in the ability of all the people of \r\nCôte d’Ivoire to overcome the few remaining obstacles \r\nand to take up the challenge of achieving peace and \r\nlasting development. In Guinea, we still hope that the \r\nremaining obstacles that led to the postponement of the \r\nsecond round of presidential elections will soon be \r\novercome. We call on all Guinean political actors to act \r\nin moderation so as to enable their country to open up \r\nquickly to democracy and to build a prosperous \r\neconomy for the benefit of all. \r\n I take this opportunity to convey once again \r\nBurkina Faso’s gratitude to the United Nations and the \r\nregional and subregional organizations that put their \r\nA/65/PV.22  \r\n \r\n10-55276 34 \r\n \r\nconfidence in the facilitation and mediation of His \r\nExcellency Mr. Blaise Compaore, President of Burkina \r\nFaso, and that continue to support his many efforts for \r\npeacebuilding, security and the rule of law in West \r\nAfrica. \r\n In Darfur, the results of the Doha negotiations are \r\nencouraging and should persuade the international \r\ncommunity to use its influence to speed up political \r\ndialogue and strengthen the operational capacity of the \r\nAfrican Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in \r\nDarfur. Burkina Faso is naturally concerned over the \r\ninsecurity and instability in Somalia, with ongoing \r\ninsurgent attacks on the Federal Transition Government \r\nand the African Union Mission in Somalia. We urge the \r\nSecurity Council and donor countries to fulfil their \r\ncommitment to supporting the rehabilitation process \r\nfor the Somali State. The results of our efforts to put an \r\nend to the reprehensible acts of piracy on the high seas \r\nwill have no effect or sustainability unless we \r\neliminate their root causes, including extreme poverty, \r\nwhich provides the most fertile soil. \r\n My country is carefully following political \r\ndevelopments in Madagascar and Niger. We welcome \r\nthe initiatives taken by the transitional authorities in \r\nthe two countries to organize free and transparent \r\nelections that will ensure a return to constitutional \r\norder. Turning to Western Sahara, we welcome the \r\nimpetus given to the negotiations by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, and we call on the protagonists to pursue \r\npolitical dialogue with a view to a peaceful and \r\nrealistic settlement of the dispute.  \r\n One cannot speak of peace and security in Africa \r\nwithout mentioning drugs and narcotics trafficking and \r\ntheir clear link with armed conflicts, the proliferation \r\nof light weapons, money-laundering, the financing of \r\norganized transnational crime and terrorism. The need \r\nto pool our efforts to deal with all this is essential and of \r\nconcern to every country. The open debate of the Security \r\nCouncil organized by Burkina Faso on 8 December 2009 \r\nto address this scourge (see S/PV.6233) was a \r\ncontribution to that effort. We hope that there will be \r\nappropriate follow-up so as to keep the international \r\ncommunity mobilized. \r\n The Sahelo-Saharan region has for many years \r\nbeen subject to recurrent terrorist attacks. Collective \r\nand cooperative efforts must be taken quickly at all \r\nlevels to ensure peace and security in that part of Africa. \r\n The situation in the Near and Middle East is \r\nstrongly marked by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and \r\nthe Iranian nuclear question. Burkina Faso welcomes \r\nthe easing of the Gaza blockade and reiterates its call \r\nfor a total lifting of the embargo. We welcome the \r\ndirect talks under way between the parties to the \r\nconflict. A comprehensive and lasting peace is the only \r\nway to ensure the freedom of the Palestinian people in \r\nan independent State with secure and recognized \r\nborders, the security of Israel, and regional stability.  \r\n On the Iranian nuclear question, Burkina Faso \r\nhopes that common sense will prevail by reconciling \r\nIran’s rights to acquire civilian nuclear power and the \r\nlegitimate fears of the international community over \r\nmilitary nuclear proliferation. \r\n United Nations reform has been on our agenda \r\nfor several years and some progress has been made, \r\nincluding the adoption on 2 July of resolution 64/289 \r\non system-wide coherence, which, inter alia, \r\nestablished UN Women. We trust that other aspects of \r\nthe reform, particularly of the Security Council, will be \r\nachieved within a reasonable time frame in order to \r\ncorrect historic injustices — particularly vis-à-vis \r\nAfrica, which is the only continent not to have a \r\npermanent seat — and to create a more democratic \r\nUnited Nations able to take up the challenges of the \r\nworld today more effectively. \r\n We trust that this reform dynamic will promote a \r\nnew spirit that will open the way to participation by the \r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan in the activities of \r\ninternational bodies, particularly the International Civil \r\nAviation Organization and the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change.  \r\n Burkina Faso reiterates its faith in multilateralism \r\nand solidarity among peoples, and to that end we stand \r\nready to make our modest contribution to building a \r\nworld of peace and justice. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Afelee Pita, chair of the \r\ndelegation of Tuvalu. \r\n Mr. Pita (Tuvalu): At the dawn of the new \r\nmillennium 10 years ago, Tuvalu raised its flag among \r\nthose of the States Members of the United Nations here \r\nin New York as a new member of this body. Our \r\nadmission was a testimony of hope and opportunity for \r\nour nation’s destiny in the resolve of humankind \r\nthrough the noble pillars of the United Nations, as \r\n A/65/PV.22\r\n \r\n35 10-55276 \r\n \r\nenshrined in its Charter. I am greatly honoured and \r\nprivileged to speak before this body on behalf of the \r\npeople and Government of Tuvalu and to convey of the \r\nGeneral Assembly our warmest greetings at this session. \r\n At the outset, we join the high commendations \r\nexpressed by previous speakers to you, Sir, on your \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-fifth session, and to your predecessor for his \r\nleadership and dedication during his presidency of the \r\nlast session. Let me reassure your Excellency of our \r\nsupport during your presidency. \r\n As Tuvalu celebrates its thirty-second anniversary \r\nof independence later this week, I take this opportunity \r\nto acknowledge and convey our sincerest thanks and \r\ngratitude to the international community, especially our \r\ntraditional development partners and close and new \r\nfriends, for their continued support and cooperation in \r\nthe pursuit of our development goals. Without their \r\ngesture of understanding, friendship and cooperation, \r\nTuvalu could not have achieved the progress it has \r\nmade to date. \r\n We welcome and support the key priority issues — \r\nsuch as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), \r\nglobal governance, and the promotion of sustainable \r\ndevelopment — that you, Mr. President, clearly \r\nhighlighted in your opening address to the sixty-fifth \r\nsession. Last week, the General Assembly convened a \r\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting on the review of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. In the context of \r\nachieving these Goals, Tuvalu has been reasonably \r\nsuccessful. Our population does not suffer from \r\nextreme poverty or hunger. We have very high \r\nparticipation rates in primary education. The \r\nparticipation of women in Tuvalu society is prominent, \r\nalthough representation in Parliament remains an issue. \r\nProgress in reducing child mortality has been \r\nsomewhat slow, and access to adequate health care also \r\nremains an issue. \r\n During the review of the MDGs, there was one \r\nvery clear lesson that we learned. This relates to the \r\nfact that while we have made progress in achieving the \r\nMDGs, these successes can be easily and very quickly \r\nreversed by our particular economic and environmental \r\nvulnerability. \r\n In the context of economic vulnerability, the \r\nrecent global financial and economic crises continue to \r\nhave an enormous adverse effect on Tuvalu’s economy. \r\nFor a small island economy like Tuvalu’s, which is \r\nhighly reliant and dependent on the import of products \r\nfrom overseas, the severe impact and consequences of \r\nsuch crises also continue to be encountered by our \r\npeople. One element of that effect was the increased \r\ncost of importing fossil fuel. The cost of fossil-fuel \r\ndependency is having a crippling effect on our national \r\nbudget. We are in desperate need of renewable energy \r\nand energy-efficiency technologies that are appropriate \r\nto the unique conditions of Tuvalu. \r\n Last week, we also undertook a review of the \r\nMauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of \r\nthe Barbados Programme of Action. During the \r\ndiscussions, we proposed three key outcomes. First, we \r\nneed support to help regulate and police illegal, \r\nunreported and unregulated fishing. Secondly, we need \r\nto ensure that our economies are able to recover after \r\nsevere weather events. This means that we need a \r\nclimate risk insurance mechanism that can draw on \r\npublic international finance to underwrite the cost of \r\npremiums and pay-outs. Thirdly, we are seeking proper \r\nacknowledgement of small island developing States’ \r\nconcerns in the United Nations process and their \r\nrecognition as a discrete group within the United \r\nNations system. \r\n Much has been said and well documented on the \r\nimportance and seriousness of climate change, \r\nespecially its adverse impact on small island States and \r\nleast developed countries like Tuvalu. At the recent \r\nPacific Island Forum meeting, leaders highlighted \r\nclimate change as the greatest threat to the livelihoods, \r\nsecurity and well-being of the peoples of the Pacific. \r\nOur leaders further iterated that unsustainable \r\ndevelopment and climate change threaten not only the \r\nlivelihoods of Pacific peoples but also the islands \r\nthemselves and the cultures they nurture. \r\n However, despite our high expectations of \r\nconcrete and timely support from the international \r\ncommunity, we were deeply concerned and disappointed \r\nat the outcomes of the Climate Change Conference in \r\nCopenhagen. We sincerely hope that the forthcoming \r\nConference of the Parties to be held in Cancún later \r\nthis year will lead to concrete results and not shallow \r\npromises. In view of the slow and painful progress in \r\nthe ongoing negotiations under the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change process, \r\ncoupled with the lack of concrete commitments shown \r\nby key greenhouse gas emitting countries, Tuvalu \r\nwould like to see three key political commitments \r\ncome out of the meeting in Cancún.  \r\nA/65/PV.22  \r\n \r\n10-55276 36 \r\n \r\n First, we would like to see all the amendments \r\nand rules for the Kyoto Protocol agreed so that such \r\namendments are ready for ratification to avoid a gap in \r\nthe commitment periods. Secondly, we should decide \r\non a mandate to start negotiations on a new, legally \r\nbinding agreement based on all elements of the Bali \r\nAction Plan. Thirdly, we should agree on a set of \r\ndecisions that would provide interim steps to \r\nimplement measures to be incorporated into the new \r\nlegally binding agreement. That should be the bare \r\nminimum we anticipate agreeing upon in Cancún. For \r\nTuvalu, addressing climate change in a substantive way \r\nis fundamental to our sustainable development and \r\nlivelihood. We cannot allow the next conference in \r\nCancún to be another failure like Copenhagen. \r\n Despite the fact that Tuvalu is one of the small \r\nisland developing States and least developed countries \r\nmost vulnerable to a wide range of global events, as \r\nalluded to earlier, the United Nations General \r\nAssembly and the Economic and Social Council have \r\nnot recognized and taken such vulnerability seriously \r\ninto consideration when addressing the question of \r\ngraduation from the least developed country category. \r\nWe strongly believe that Tuvalu’s economic and \r\nenvironmental vulnerability cannot be overemphasized \r\nand totally ignored, especially with the ongoing \r\nconsequences of climate change and the recent global \r\ncrisis. In that regard, we continue to call upon the \r\nUnited Nations and our development partners to \r\nrecognize our vulnerability as a least developed \r\ncountry in the review of the criteria and the graduation \r\nrule for the graduation of least developed countries. \r\n We could not agree more as to the need and \r\nimportance for the General Assembly and Security \r\nCouncil to be revitalized and reformed, respectively, so \r\nas to enable them to fulfil their mandates and roles in a \r\nmore transparent, coherent, efficient and timely \r\nmanner. We fully support the ongoing reform \r\nprocesses, and we believe that small island developing \r\nStates should be allocated a seat in the Security Council. \r\n While we applaud and strongly support the \r\ncontinuing significant role played by the United \r\nNations as the major peacekeeping body in the \r\ninternational community, the efforts and progress made \r\nby Taiwan in pursuing peace on both sides of the \r\nStraits needs special recognition and encouragement by \r\nthe United Nations. In addition, we strongly believe \r\nthat with its active involvement and contributions to \r\ninternational trade, investment, air transport, finance, \r\ntelecommunications technology and environmental \r\nprotection, Taiwan deserves to participate more fully as \r\na member of the World Health Organization and other \r\nUnited Nations specialized agencies such as the \r\nInternational Civil Aviation Organization and the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange. Tuvalu therefore urges the United Nations \r\nspecialized agencies to accommodate Taiwan’s \r\nmeaningful participation in their respective systems \r\nand activities. \r\n In conclusion, let me reiterate and underscore the \r\nimportance and seriousness of climate change as a \r\ncross-cutting issue and its adverse impacts, especially \r\nthe impact of sea-level rise on a small island \r\ndeveloping State such as Tuvalu. Although we do \r\nacknowledge with profound appreciation the \r\ncommitments and generous pledges offered by the \r\ninternational community and the establishment of \r\ninternational trust funds specifically earmarked for \r\nclimate change, the process of accessing such sources \r\nof funds, let alone their timely disbursement, is \r\nextremely difficult and time consuming for small \r\ncountries such as Tuvalu. Therefore, such \r\ncommitments without timely actions to deliver \r\nconcrete results on the ground may well leave small \r\nand poor countries such as Tuvalu to continue to \r\nshoulder the burden. May God Bless the United \r\nNations. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Marten Grunditz, head of \r\nthe delegation of the Kingdom of Sweden. \r\n Mr. Grunditz (Sweden): May I start by pointing \r\nout that Sweden aligns itself fully with the written \r\nstatement of the European Union (EU), which will \r\nsoon be distributed to all Member States. \r\n By signing the Charter of the United Nations we \r\nhave all pledged to combine our efforts towards the \r\nshared goals of international peace and security, human \r\nrights, respect for international law, and economic and \r\nsocial advancement. Implicit in that pledge is the \r\nprinciple of shared responsibility. If we are to move \r\nbeyond divisions to find common solutions to global \r\nproblems, every country will need to assume its share \r\nof responsibility. Last week, world leaders met in this \r\nroom to confirm their determination to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals by 2015. Progress \r\nmade over the 10 years since the adoption of the \r\nMillennium Declaration has been mixed. The overall \r\n A/65/PV.22\r\n \r\n37 10-55276 \r\n \r\ntrend is positive, but critical areas are lagging behind. \r\nThis is particularly true for Goal 5 on maternal health. \r\nSweden will continue to do its part to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and is one of the \r\ncountries contributing the largest share of its national \r\nincome as official development assistance. But \r\ndevelopment assistance can only complement — and \r\nnever replace — development efforts based on genuine \r\nnational ownership. Thus, we have a shared \r\nresponsibility, developed and developing countries alike, \r\nto achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015.  \r\n The development and prosperity of poor countries \r\nto a large extent depend on their ability to integrate \r\ninto the global economy. The fact that protectionism \r\nhas largely been kept at bay during the most severe \r\nrecession since the 1930s is therefore a major \r\nachievement. Robust international rules for open trade \r\nand investment are key. Free trade benefits rich and \r\npoor countries alike. The regions that have been most \r\nsuccessful in eradicating poverty are also those where \r\ncountries trade the most. In order to strengthen the \r\ntrading capacity of the poorest countries, aid for trade \r\ncan play an important role. Completion of the Doha \r\nRound must remain a shared first priority, but should \r\nnot prevent complementary free trade and investment \r\narrangements. \r\n The devastating natural disasters in Haiti and \r\nPakistan have underlined the importance of a well-\r\nfunctioning and well-coordinated international \r\nhumanitarian system. It is only through joint efforts \r\nand shared responsibility that the international \r\ncommunity can ensure quick and effective responses to \r\npeople in need. The Office for the Coordination of \r\nHumanitarian Affairs (OCHA) plays a crucial role in \r\nthis respect. Sadly, we see a global trend of increasing \r\nhumanitarian needs. It is therefore of utmost importance \r\nthat we continue to strengthen the humanitarian system \r\nas a whole, in particular OCHA. In parallel, we need to \r\nfocus more on preparedness and prevention to reduce \r\nlong-term vulnerability to disasters.  \r\n Climate change is clearly one of the greatest \r\nchallenges of our generation, affecting the world and \r\nparticularly poor countries in unpredictable and \r\ndevastating ways. Even if we meet the two-degree \r\ntarget set by the United Nations, disasters will continue \r\nto be a reality. Developed and developing countries \r\nalike share the responsibility to ward off this threat to \r\nour planet by working towards concrete climate goals. \r\nDeveloped countries, as major emitters, bear a large \r\nshare of the responsibility for reducing emissions and \r\nfor providing funding, but actions must be taken by all \r\ncountries. The example of Sweden shows that it is \r\npossible to achieve both emissions reductions and \r\neconomic growth — there is no contradiction.  \r\n Together we have a shared responsibility as the \r\nguardians of human rights, enshrined in the United \r\nNations Charter, the Universal Declaration and the \r\nrelevant conventions. Without respect for human rights \r\nand fundamental freedoms, all other progress will be \r\nincomplete. The ultimate responsibility lies with \r\nStates. It is for us to put ideals into practice. The \r\nHuman Rights Council needs to use all its tools to \r\naddress the substance of its mandate: human rights \r\nviolations. For that Council to be relevant, its members \r\nmust meet the membership criteria of fulfilling their \r\ninternational human rights obligations. Much remains \r\nto be done. The death penalty continues to be applied \r\nextensively across the world, in some cases even \r\nagainst juveniles, and often without a credible legal \r\nprocess. As we have recently seen, in some countries a \r\nwoman can even be sentenced to death by stoning for \r\nalleged adultery, and both men and women can be \r\nexecuted for no other reason than their sexual \r\norientation. The responsibility to stop such barbaric \r\nacts lies firmly with us, the governments. Gender \r\nequality remains one of the greatest challenges to \r\nhuman rights and democracy. We therefore welcome \r\nthe establishment of the United Nations Entity for \r\nGender Equality and the Empowerment of Women  \r\n(UN Women) and believe it will further the cause of \r\ngender equality.  \r\n Democracy and human rights are not just \r\nmutually supporting; one cannot be said to truly exist \r\nwithout the other. The right to participate in a \r\ndemocratic system of government is indeed in itself a \r\nhuman right. Although we have seen democracy spread \r\nto new countries, a large part of the world’s population \r\nis still denied the right to participate in free elections. \r\nWe call upon the Government of Myanmar to make its \r\nNovember election free, fair and inclusive. In this \r\ncontext, we reiterate our call for the release of the \r\npolitical prisoners and detainees, including Daw Aung \r\nSan Suu Kyi.  \r\n Freedom of expression is a core human right and \r\na prerequisite of democracy. In this era of information \r\ntechnology, communication has been revolutionized. \r\nNew technologies can assist in making Governments \r\nmore transparent and can stimulate citizens to take a \r\nA/65/PV.22  \r\n \r\n10-55276 38 \r\n \r\nmore active role in the democratic governance of their \r\ncountries. Yet, technology alone cannot make \r\ninformation and expression of opinion free. Access to \r\ntechnology is needed as a catalyst for human rights. \r\nThe harassment and jailing of journalists and bloggers \r\nmust stop. The situation in countries such as China, \r\nViet Nam, Egypt, Myanmar, Cuba, the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea, Eritrea and Iran is deeply \r\nworrying. It is important that the international \r\ncommunity address the issue of violations of freedom \r\nof expression, also in connection with new \r\ntechnologies and with greater vigour than in the past. \r\n Sweden is concerned about continued human \r\nrights violations in the Sudan, not least in Darfur. Full \r\ncooperation with the International Criminal Court is an \r\nobligation under international law. The upcoming \r\nreferendum on the status of Southern Sudan will be of \r\ncrucial importance to the country’s future. We must \r\nspare no effort to make sure that it is credible and to \r\nsupport the parties in reaching an agreement on post-\r\nreferendum arrangements. In this process the United \r\nNations has a key role to play, together with the \r\nAfrican Union. \r\n The recently reported cases of sexual violence in \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, with shocking \r\nnews of hundreds of rapes of women and children, are \r\nnot isolated incidents. They are part of a pattern of \r\nconflict-related crimes that have been carried out with \r\nimpunity over many years. As so often in conflict \r\nsituations, women and children are the most vulnerable \r\ngroups; as so often in peace processes, women are the \r\nmost ignored. A lasting peace calls for the \r\nempowerment and equal participation of women in \r\nnegotiations and decision-making. Lasting peace can \r\nnever be achieved while there is impunity. It is high \r\ntime to fully implement Security Council resolutions \r\n1325 (2000), on women and peace and security, and \r\n1820 (2008), on sexual violence in conflict situations. \r\nSweden welcomes the appointment of a Special \r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General on Sexual \r\nViolence in Conflict. \r\n The international community has agreed on the \r\nresponsibility to protect populations from genocide, \r\nwar crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against \r\nhumanity. We need to intensify our efforts and develop \r\nthe right tools to ensure the full realization of the \r\nresponsibility to protect, both as sovereign States and \r\nas part of the international community. Sweden fully \r\nsupports the Secretary-General’s efforts to strengthen \r\nthe early warning capability within the Secretariat. \r\n Few aspects of our cooperation through the \r\nUnited Nations illustrate shared responsibility better \r\nthan our joint role in preventing and managing \r\nconflicts, and keeping and building sustainable peace. \r\nImportant steps have been taken to improve global \r\npeacekeeping. We welcome the New Horizon Initiative \r\nas a way of further enhancing the capability of the \r\nUnited Nations to conduct demanding and complex \r\npeacekeeping missions worldwide. Much work remains \r\nto be done in the areas of conflict prevention and \r\npeacebuilding. We need to increase the capacity of the \r\nUnited Nations to help countries in transition from war \r\nto lasting peace, and to provide relevant support — not \r\nleast through the Peacebuilding Commission and the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund — for their efforts to foster peace \r\nand rebuild State and society. Similarly, the United \r\nNations must have the right tools to help prevent \r\ncountries from lapsing into conflict in the first place. \r\nThis is a central challenge for the United Nations and a \r\nkey priority for the coming decade. \r\n We welcome the increasingly important role that \r\nthe African Union plays, not least in peacekeeping \r\noperations in Africa. Cooperation between the African \r\nUnion and both the United Nations and the European \r\nUnion has been important in both the Sudan and \r\nSomalia. Earlier this year, Sweden led the European \r\nUnion’s anti-piracy operation off the coast of Somalia, \r\na mission that provides security for humanitarian \r\ntransports of the World Food Programme into Somalia. \r\nFurthermore, the European Union, in close cooperation \r\nwith the African Union, is conducting training in \r\nUganda of the Transitional Federal Government \r\nsecurity forces. The African Union has made a \r\ncourageous and considerable contribution to security in \r\nMogadishu. Yet over the past year we have witnessed \r\nsome of the most violent fighting in Mogadishu and in \r\nparts of south-central Somalia. Together with the \r\nTransitional Federal Institutions, we now need to \r\nprepare and plan for the end of the transitional \r\narrangements by August next year. In this process, \r\nstrong United Nations leadership will be crucial. \r\n The United Nations plays a crucial role in the \r\nefforts of the international community to contribute to \r\nsecure, stable and democratic development in \r\nAfghanistan. At the Kabul International Conference on \r\nAfghanistan, held in July, there was a renewed \r\ncommitment by the Afghan authorities and the \r\n A/65/PV.22\r\n \r\n39 10-55276 \r\n \r\ninternational community to enhance national ownership \r\nin this process. Together, the United Nations, the \r\nEuropean Union and other international actors have to \r\nshow continued strong resolve in assisting the Afghan \r\npeople in building a more peaceful and democratic \r\nsociety. To this effect, Sweden will continue to contribute \r\nto civilian and military operations in Afghanistan, while \r\nincreasing our development assistance. \r\n In the Middle East the responsibility for the \r\nsuccess of direct negotiations lies with the two parties. \r\nBut we all share an interest in, and must contribute to, \r\na two-State solution with Israel and Palestine living \r\nside by side in peace and security. We deeply regret the \r\nIsraeli decision not to extend the moratorium on \r\nsettlements. The context of direct negotiations, as \r\nstated in European Union Council conclusions, must be \r\nthat negotiations should be based on the pre-1967 \r\nborders, that settlements are illegal, that all final status \r\nissues are to be included in the negotiations — \r\nincluding the status of Jerusalem as capital of two \r\nStates — and that both parties are to refrain from \r\nprovocative actions. \r\n We strive for a world without nuclear weapons. \r\nWorld leaders have made significant progress in \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation efforts in the past \r\nyear. The New START agreement is of great \r\nimportance, but there is scope for further reductions, \r\nnot least of non-strategic nuclear arsenals. The spread \r\nof nuclear weapons must be stopped. The Action Plan \r\nadopted at the Review Conference of the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in May, \r\ncovering the three mutually reinforcing pillars of the \r\nNPT, must be implemented and fully respected.  \r\n The early entry into force of the Comprehensive \r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) is as urgent as ever. \r\nThe unacceptable deadlock in the Conference on \r\nDisarmament must come to an end.  \r\n We are deeply concerned that the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea has continued its \r\nwithdrawal from the NPT, even having tested two \r\nnuclear devices, and that Iran has been conducting \r\nactivities in violation of its NPT commitments. It is of \r\nvital importance that commitments under the NPT be \r\nhonoured. \r\n The control of conventional arms is also an \r\nurgent priority. The illicit or uncontrolled spread of \r\nsuch weapons contributes to regional and international \r\ninstability, maiming and killing thousands. We must \r\nseize the opportunity and strive together to find the \r\npolitical will to agree on regulating mechanisms, such \r\nas is currently being discussed in the form of an arms \r\ntrade treaty. \r\n The European Union is a strong supporter of the \r\nUnited Nations. Following the entry into force of the \r\nLisbon Treaty, the EU has established new permanent \r\nstructures for its external representation, taking over \r\nfunctions previously carried out by the rotating \r\npresidency. Ensuring that the EU can continue to \r\ncontribute effectively to the work of the United \r\nNations requires allowing its representatives to \r\nparticipate actively in its proceedings in the capacity of \r\nobserver. We are looking forward to continued \r\ncooperation with a view to ensuring the adoption of a \r\nresolution to that effect as soon as possible. \r\n Our countries are interconnected today in an \r\nunprecedented way. In a globalized world, problems \r\nsuch as climate change, natural disasters, disease, \r\ndrugs, terrorism and conflicts take on new proportions. \r\nAt the same time the alleviation of poverty, the fight \r\nfor human rights and democracy, and economic \r\ndevelopment remain as relevant as ever. We need to \r\ncooperate in global structures and engage in various \r\nforms of global governance to meet these challenges. \r\nThe United Nations is the only world body offering a \r\nunique forum to address these problems in a \r\ncoordinated way. We need to continue to reform the \r\nUnited Nations in order for it to fulfil its functions and \r\nremain relevant. Only when every country assumes its \r\nshare of responsibility can the United Nations achieve \r\nits full potential. Sweden will continue to be a strong \r\nsupporter of the United Nations and will assume its \r\nshare of our common responsibility. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency, Mr. Gert Rosenthal, chair of \r\nthe delegation of the Republic of Guatemala. \r\n Mr. Rosenthal (Guatemala) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nOur President, Mr. Álvaro Colom Caballeros, \r\nparticipated in the High-level Plenary Meeting on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (see A/65/PV.3) but \r\nhad to return to Guatemala owing to commitments \r\nrelated to his high office. Similarly, our Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs, who unexpectedly had to leave New \r\nYork yesterday. It is for this reason that I have the high \r\nhonour of presenting this message, which was prepared \r\nto be presented today by the Minister. \r\nA/65/PV.22  \r\n \r\n10-55276 40 \r\n \r\n Before proceeding, I should like to express our \r\nprofound gratitude to Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki for his \r\noutstanding performance in heading the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-fourth session. Likewise, Mr. Deiss, \r\nwe wish you every success as President for the current \r\nsession. We have no doubt that with your vast \r\nexperience you will guide our deliberations and \r\nenhance the work of the General Assembly as the main \r\npolicymaking organ of the United Nations. \r\n We have just concluded our review of the \r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals, \r\nadopted 10 years ago in an international environment \r\nthat was perhaps more encouraging than today’s. As \r\nhas been highlighted in recent days, the results reflect \r\nboth light and shadow, with some countries showing \r\nimpressive gains, and others even suffering setbacks. \r\nThe majority have made progress on some of the Goals \r\nbut not in others, or have made advances whose \r\nbenefits have been distributed very unequally among \r\ndifferent segments of the population.  \r\n In addition, today’s international environment is \r\nfar less encouraging than that of 10 years ago. The \r\nprevious decade began with the attack on the twin \r\ntowers in this very city, placing counter-terrorism \r\nsquarely as a priority on the international agenda. It \r\ncontinued with a military confrontation that was not \r\nsanctioned by the Security Council, with all its \r\nconsequences, and concluded with three simultaneous \r\ncrises — food, energy and, especially, financial and \r\neconomic — from whose effects we have yet to recover.  \r\n Further, after building up a cumulative body of \r\nscientific evidence that no longer allows any room for \r\ndoubt, we have confirmed that the very effects of \r\ntechnological progress have brought with them \r\ndevastating consequences for our common habitat — \r\nthis planet — and that the destruction wrought by \r\nclimate change is palpable and dramatic. On another \r\nmatter, in the current decade we have witnessed very \r\nclearly that organized crime does not recognize borders \r\nand tends to spread to those countries with the least \r\ncapacity to confront its considerable resources. \r\n My own country has been a victim of some of \r\nthese phenomena, which nullify or at least mitigate the \r\nconsiderable efforts we have deployed, especially since \r\nthe Administration of President Colom took office \r\nearly in 2008, to stimulate development, achieve higher \r\nlevels of well-being for the disadvantaged sectors of our \r\npopulation, and strengthen our democratic institutions. \r\nHere again we see both light and shadow: in spite of an \r\nunfavourable international environment and as President \r\nColom noted in this very Hall on 20 September, we have \r\nachieved progress is addressing some of the pressing \r\nproblems faced by the our country’s most vulnerable.  \r\n But the shadow is still present. Its origin lies in \r\nphenomena that are totally or partially out of our \r\ncontrol. I highlight three of them. First, the financial \r\nand economic crisis had a sharp adverse impact on our \r\neconomic performance. Gross national product grew \r\nless than 1 per cent in 2009, with declining exports, \r\nshrinking family remittances and collapsing foreign \r\ndirect investment. This had an extremely negative \r\nimpact on our tax revenues, in spite of the many \r\nGovernment initiatives to raise tax rates to deal with \r\nincreasing demands for social services and public \r\nsecurity. Although we have seen a modest recovery this \r\nyear, its strength will depend to a large degree on \r\nuncertain developments in the international economy. \r\nIn other words, the international economic environment \r\nhas not been very conducive to meeting our economic \r\ngrowth goals, in spite of the official cooperation that \r\nwe have received, which we sincerely appreciate. \r\n Secondly, in the last decade a array of unlawful \r\nactivities related to organized crime have taken root in \r\nour country. Trafficking in persons, arms and narcotics, \r\nand money laundering have expanded to a worrisome \r\nextent, given the dual abilities of organized criminal \r\ngroups to co-opt and intimidate. Above all, drug \r\ntrafficking has undermined our democratic institutions. \r\nIn response, we have associated ourselves with the \r\nUnited Nations and friendly countries, through both \r\nbilateral and multilateral cooperation. This can be seen \r\nmostly clearly in the International Commission against \r\nImpunity in Guatemala (CICIG), to which I will return \r\nlater. Furthermore, recognizing that the struggle against \r\nillegal activities and organized crime — a basic \r\nresponsibility of all States — has today assumed a \r\nclearly transnational character, we have joined our \r\nneighbours in Central America and Mexico in \r\ncombating regional criminal networks. \r\n Thirdly, as if what I have already said were not \r\nenough, we have also fallen victim to natural disasters \r\nwith an unusual frequency, which highlights the \r\nextreme vulnerability of Guatemala to the effects of \r\nclimate change, given its location in a tropical area. We \r\nhad not even begun to recover from the effects of \r\ntropical storm Stan of late 2005 when we were hit by a \r\nserious drought in 2009 and, over the past few months, \r\n A/65/PV.22\r\n \r\n41 10-55276 \r\n \r\nthe eruption of the Pacaya Volcano, which caused \r\nextensive damage to agriculture, followed by tropical \r\nstorm Agatha in June, which affected some 330,000 \r\npersons, killed approximately 100 and caused material \r\ndamage totalling an estimated $1 billion. These \r\nestimates in human suffering and material losses have \r\ncontinued to grow with the unprecedented levels of \r\nrainfall during the past month, which has contributed \r\neven more human victims and material damage. \r\n The Government has done all within its power to \r\naddress the situation and has appealed for international \r\nassistance. I commend the fact that the United Nations \r\nwas among the first to respond to our call, and I \r\ntherefore express our appreciation to the Office for the \r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the \r\nAdministrator of the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme. \r\n To date, we have been focused on the emergency \r\nphase, but it is imperative that we move on to \r\nreconstruction and recovery as soon as possible. The \r\nGovernment has drawn up a detailed plan to address \r\nthose goals, and we will convene an international \r\nconference to present the plan to our partners in \r\nAntigua in Guatemala on 11 and 12 October. \r\n I shall now make some brief remarks on our \r\nOrganization and its agenda in the immediate future. I \r\nbegin by reiterating our support for multilateralism in \r\ngeneral and for the United Nations in particular. We \r\nhave enjoyed strong, continuous support from the \r\nOrganization, in supporting our peace process, \r\nfacilitating development cooperation and providing \r\nassistance when we have faced emergencies, as at the \r\npresent time. \r\n The latest example of that fruitful and innovative \r\ncooperation is the International Commission against \r\nImpunity in Guatemala. In only three years, the \r\nCommission has shown that it is indeed possible to \r\ncombat impunity and strengthen the rule of law. We \r\nvalue this cooperative effort between the Government \r\nof Guatemala and the United Nations, and we will \r\ncontinue to support it. \r\n We also value the work of our Organization in the \r\narea of peacekeeping. We have participated in several \r\noperations, principally in Haiti and the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo. We support the work of the \r\nUnited Nations in the area of peacebuilding, and we \r\nhope to participate in the Peacebuilding Commission as \r\na full member as of next January. \r\n We welcome the decision of the General \r\nAssembly to establish the United Nations Entity for \r\nGender Equality and the Empowerment of Women, and \r\nwe are pleased that its first leader will be Ms. Michelle \r\nBachelet. We also commit ourselves to continue \r\nsupporting initiatives aimed at achieving greater \r\nsystem-wide coherence. \r\n At the same time, we harbour the hope that, in the \r\ncoming year, some tangible progress will be made in \r\nthe long-delayed reform of the Security Council. We \r\nbelieve that it is crucial to provide greater legitimacy to \r\nthat body, which would benefit all of the main bodies \r\nand the Organization overall. In the meantime, we have \r\nannounced our candidature for one of the seats \r\nallocated to our region in the Security Council for the \r\nbiennium 2012-2013, in the hope of continuing to \r\ncontribute to its work. \r\n We reiterate our profound commitment to \r\nachieving significant progress during the next \r\nConference of the Parties of the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, to be held \r\nin Cancún. We have participated actively in the \r\npreparatory work, based on the understanding that \r\nrarely has humanity faced a larger challenge that \r\naffects all countries and communities on the planet. \r\n In rejoining the Human Rights Council, we \r\nreiterate our commitment to the full respect of human \r\nrights in all their aspects, including the responsibility \r\nto protect our respective populations from genocide, \r\nwar crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against \r\nhumanity. \r\n It is commonly held that without peace there can \r\nbe no development. Promising signs have been seen in \r\nvarious parts of the world, which, we hope, may lead to \r\nthe resolution of long-standing tensions. We trust that \r\nthe direct negotiations recently begun in the Middle \r\nEast will be fruitful and lead to a Palestinian State that \r\ncan coexist with Israel in peace and harmony, within \r\nborders that are secure for both parties. \r\n We also applaud the engagement and growing \r\nclimate of cooperation being generated between the \r\nparties separated by the Taiwan Straits. \r\n Finally, I am pleased to announce that we have \r\nachieved a major step forward in addressing the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, together with Belize, to \r\nseek a juridical solution to the age-old territorial \r\ndispute between us. That step required the approval by \r\nA/65/PV.22  \r\n \r\n10-55276 42 \r\n \r\nour Congress of the Special Agreement signed with \r\nBelize in December 2008, which cleared the path for a \r\npopular referendum, as provided for under that \r\nAgreement. We hope that the Belizean Parliament will \r\nalso authorize as soon as possible the referendum to be \r\nheld simultaneously in both countries, as the final step \r\nthat allows both parties to present themselves to the \r\nCourt. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Antonio Pedro Monteiro Lima, \r\nhead of the delegation of the Republic of Cape Verde. \r\n Mr. Lima (Cape Verde) (spoke in French): I \r\nwould like first of all to pay tribute to you, Sir, for \r\nyour election as President of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-fifth session, and wish you every success as \r\nyou carry out your duties in that role. Cape Verde \r\noffers you its full support.  \r\n I also appreciate the commitment of and the very \r\nfruitful work carried out by his predecessor, \r\nAmbassador Ali Abdussalam Treki, who was able to \r\nlead the Assembly during its sixty-fourth session with \r\nremarkable dynamism.  \r\n We confirm our support for the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, as he seeks to make the \r\nUnited Nations system ever more effective in working \r\nfor the legitimate aspirations of the peoples of the \r\nworld to peace, dignity and progress.  \r\n Our theme this year is reaffirming the central role \r\nof the United Nations in global governance. The points \r\nwhich I shall develop relate to that theme, which is a \r\ncross-cutting issue par excellence.  \r\n First of all, we have to save the planet. To do that \r\nwould seem self-evident — here everybody would \r\nseem to agree — yet if one considers the negotiations \r\nunderway with reference to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, there is a \r\ntendency towards pessimism rather than optimism. \r\nScientists have for some time now shown that our \r\nplanet seriously risks not being able to provide for life \r\nin all in its plenitude because of the consequences of \r\nglobal warming. We know today that time to act \r\neffectively is running out.  \r\n The participants at the Copenhagen Summit left \r\nknowing that there was no time left for quibbling. We \r\nsaid that last year here ourselves. Now is the time for \r\nus to take concerted, coherent and systematic action, so \r\nthat we can substantially reduce greenhouse gas \r\nemissions, slow down global warming and avoid a rise \r\nin the sea level which could jeopardize vast coastal \r\nregions of the world, and in particular the small island \r\ndeveloping States, which are particularly vulnerable \r\nand suffer first-hand the consequences of increasingly \r\nfrequent and extreme inclement weather. \r\n Cape Verde is a State of the Sahel. For a long \r\ntime, therefore, we have faced drought, desertification \r\nand dramatic water scarcity. Those phenomena strongly \r\ninfluence what we do to preserve the environment and \r\nachieve human development.  \r\n We are seeking to adapt to and reduce the impact \r\nof climate change, whether it be in the specific terms \r\nof land reclamation and water conveyance or in the \r\ndevelopment of renewable energy, all of which are part \r\nof our national growth dynamics, alongside education, \r\nhealth, employment, infrastructure and so on.  \r\n We are in process of implementing an ambitious \r\nprogramme to use surface water by building dams and \r\nreservoirs to support the modernization of agriculture, \r\nthe development of livestock farming and food \r\nprocessing — all of which will help farmers \r\neverywhere. Following the food crisis of two years \r\nago, , similar efforts were made in Africa and small \r\nisland developing States to help farmers make a profit, \r\nhelp the economy make progress and help countries \r\nface the challenges of climate change. Financing, \r\nwithout which there would be many failures, projects \r\nwould be abandoned and obstacles would remain \r\ninsurmountable, was a key factor. So we need quickly \r\nto set up the financing announced within the fast-track \r\nframework. Time is running out. \r\n We believe that the international community, \r\nparticularly the developed countries and large \r\nemerging countries, must address the increased threat \r\nto global security and the repercussions for everybody \r\nof the devastating consequences of natural disasters \r\nand must continue to support the specific dynamics \r\naffecting the most vulnerable States with respect to \r\nclimate change in the areas of mitigation and \r\nadaptation and help them minimize the risks \r\nthreatening them in the present situation, knowing that \r\nsome of them are already facing the problems of \r\npopulation shifts and forced migration.  \r\n Solidarity is not a meaningless word for people \r\nwho live on islands. For some individuals, it is a \r\nquestion of survival; for nations, it is a question of \r\ntheir continued existence as peoples. Let us not offer \r\n A/65/PV.22\r\n \r\n43 10-55276 \r\n \r\nup the weakest as sacrificial lambs, for tomorrow all of \r\nus may be in a similar situation. Let us also not forget \r\nthat conflicts resulting from water scarcity on the \r\nplanet are foreseeable, which should be a major \r\nconcern that we must start tackling as of today.  \r\n We wish to reaffirm here that the ocean, which is \r\nfor our island country our vital environment, our \r\ncivilization and our inspiration, as well as our potential \r\nfor the future, must be protected and preserved. Just a \r\nfew days ago, with six coastal countries in West Africa \r\nand Norway, we signed an agreement that will help us \r\ncollectively to better manage this huge common \r\npotential and to keep watch over the protection of our \r\nocean interests. With the coastal States along the \r\nAtlantic Ocean, particularly those in the southern \r\nAtlantic, we confirm our resolve to make it an area for \r\ntrade and active solidarity, not unfair competition. \r\nInstead of making the ocean just one more element to \r\nbe gobbled up by human greed, let us try to preserve its \r\nunique value as a precious container of life and \r\nguardian of the hopes of the planet.  \r\n We must protect and empower women. We firmly \r\nbelieve that one of the major revolutions to be made in \r\nour time is the one enabling women to truly become \r\nfull and equal partners with men in their shared quest \r\nfor progress. In Cape Verde, we have made substantial \r\ngains in gender equality and equity, but there are still \r\nmajor challenges. For example, in our current \r\nGovernment consisting of 14 Ministers, eight of them \r\nare women. The report on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) for 2010 shows that Cape \r\nVerde has achieved gender parity in primary and \r\nsecondary education. Indeed, in some cases, there are \r\nmore girls than boys in school. \r\n Major investment in maternal and infant health \r\nmeans that 98 per cent of births are in a hospital \r\nenvironment with specialized assistants. Yet, 25 per \r\ncent of women suffer from domestic abuse. In \r\nParliament and in local authorities, there are few \r\nwomen participating. Poverty and unemployment affect \r\nmore women than men. We continue to work on this \r\nissue, and we think we are going in the right direction. \r\n UN Women, recently launched by Economic and \r\nSocial Council, is a universal entity charged principally \r\nwith overcoming the obstacles that prevented the four \r\nformerly separate bodies working in the gender area \r\nfrom responding more effectively to challenges in the \r\narea of gender equality and the empowerment of \r\nwomen.  \r\n UN Women is part of the effort to reform the \r\nUnited Nations begun nearly two decades ago with a \r\nview towards strengthening system-wide coherence. \r\nWe would like to congratulate Ms. Michelle Bachelet \r\nand assure her of Cape Verde’s support in her new \r\nduties to defend, promote and empower women. We \r\nbelieve that the robustness of her mandate and her \r\npotential role of catalyst for the new entity should \r\nencourage donors to respond positively to meet its \r\nfunding needs.  \r\n We must continue to work for peace. The \r\nevolving international situation with groups of States \r\ncoming together to discuss major regional and global \r\nissues and to propose solutions is evidence of a trend \r\nthat, despite everything, is struggling to show its \r\nefficiency and cannot seem to reduce the worry of \r\nsome and the doubts of others.  \r\n We continue to believe that the United Nations, \r\nwhere each one of us has his or her place, can play a \r\ntruly effective part by ensuring going forward so that \r\nits dynamism is maintained, its mission is clearly \r\ndefined, and we all share in the responsibilities and the \r\ndecision-making. It is our universal institution that \r\nbrings together the essential conditions for handling \r\nthe problems of the world and that has been endowed \r\nwith the necessary collective responsibility. \r\nAccordingly, the huge mission of promoting and \r\nensuring better and more effective global governance is \r\na job that must be carried out by the United Nations. \r\n World peace remains a distant goal, and the \r\nhotbeds of tension, far from abating, persist, ever \r\ncloser. Conflicts weaken entire regions, creating \r\nrefugees and displaced persons by the millions, \r\nparalysing economies, destroying infrastructure and \r\nobliterating decades of work aimed at promoting \r\neducation, health and justice for the people. Sometimes \r\nthe very concept of the human being seems to be \r\nvanishing, giving way to an era of modern slaves who \r\ncan be moulded and exploited at will. Women suffer \r\nsexual violence, which has become a weapon of war, \r\nand child soldiers are often deployed unscrupulously as \r\ncombatants by both sides.  \r\n The United Nations, in this arena as in others, is \r\nstill the central element, functioning as the collective \r\nconscience of the community of nations, dedicated to \r\nmanaging our communal actions and finding solutions \r\nA/65/PV.22  \r\n \r\n10-55276 44 \r\n \r\nof consensus and cooperation. In this light, the \r\nrevitalization of the United Nations seems a \r\nrequirement of our time, inviting the participation of \r\nall. \r\n Cape Verde has always favoured universal and \r\ntotal disarmament. It wishes to help create a world \r\nwhere fear of the other is replaced by the need to \r\ncooperate with the other and a recognition of the other \r\nas a necessary, complementary partner. We continue to \r\nbelieve, for instance, in the future of talks between \r\nIsrael and the Palestinians, and we continue to hope \r\nthat we will see a Middle East with two independent \r\nStates living side by side in peace and security. But \r\nrestoring credibility to the Middle East peace process \r\nrequires, more than anything else, that the parties \r\nhonour their own obligations, which derive from their \r\ncommitments and from decisions and resolutions \r\nagreed to here in the United Nations. From this point of \r\nview, putting an end to hostilities in Gaza and on \r\nIsraeli soil, halting settlement in the occupied \r\nterritories, dismantling the wall and ending the \r\nblockade seem to us incontrovertible imperatives. We \r\nardently hope that the new talks will bring us closer to \r\npeace. \r\n Organized crime is a scourge that my country is \r\nfighting directly, with the support of many of our \r\npartners. Drug traffickers now swarm into our West \r\nAfrican subregion, threatening the stability of our \r\ncountries and destroying our efforts towards regional \r\nstability and peace for our peoples. A determined \r\nbattle, uniting producing nations, nations of transit and \r\nconsumer nations, must be vigorously and tirelessly \r\nwaged. We must not allow drugs to turn our children \r\ninto pariahs, the unfortunate victims of dirty money. \r\nHuman rights are at stake in that struggle for our \r\nchildren to live and flourish free of the influence of \r\ndrugs, so that tomorrow they may become citizens of \r\nthe world.  \r\n At the beginning of the twenty-first century \r\nthings are evolving in all spheres — and especially in \r\ninternational politics — because of circumstances and \r\nevents, but also because of the political will of the \r\nmost enlightened. Is it not time to put an end to \r\nsituations that are now obsolete vestiges of the cold \r\nwar and the Second World War, such as in the case of \r\nCuba? The isolation and blockade are sources of \r\ntension and frustration and can hardly serve as the \r\nbasis for new hope. Generations are changing, attitudes \r\nare evolving and the aspirations of the young are \r\ndifferent now. New generations have the right to a \r\nfuture of peace, understanding and healthy exchange. \r\nLet us show the wisdom to offer them a world worthy \r\nof their dreams and aspirations.  \r\n We must innovate for the future. When we \r\nbecame one of the eight pilot countries for the \r\nDelivering as One experiment in 2006, we wanted, of \r\ncourse, to benefit from positive impact of such a leap \r\nforward in this way in our relations with the various \r\nUnited Nations agencies. We also wanted to participate \r\nin reforming the United Nations system, so that it \r\ncould better meet the demands of the world today. \r\nMoreover, our Government believes that reform means \r\nsimplifying the well-known United Nations \r\nbureaucracy. Today we are witnessing real progress and \r\nclear mutual benefits. The funds allotted to our country \r\nare increasing, the effectiveness of the various agencies \r\nis improving, there is a real sense of ownership, and \r\nthere is also leadership by the Government and \r\ndynamic synergy among all the parties involved — \r\npointing us ever forward on this path. The recent \r\nmeeting of the eight pilot countries in Hanoi was a \r\nsuccess, and we eagerly await new additions to the \r\nfamily. \r\n Since independence 35 years ago, Cape Verde has \r\nmade great strides in human development and has \r\nbecome a middle-income country. Between 1990 and \r\n2007 our human development index rose from 0.589 to \r\n0.708. Per capita income, barely $300 per year at the \r\ntime of our independence, is now $3,041 per year. \r\nSchool enrolment stands at 96 per cent. Illiteracy has \r\nbeen reduced to 18.5 per cent, declining as much for \r\nwomen as for men. We project 6 per cent growth for \r\nthe year 2010. \r\n We have achieved much in education, health and \r\npolitical participation thanks to our Government’s \r\npolicy aimed at eradicating poverty and achieving food \r\nsecurity and gender equality and equity. In the last \r\ndecade poverty has dropped from 49 per cent in 1989 \r\nto 36.7 per cent in 2002 to 26 per cent in 2007. \r\nEstimates predict a poverty rate in 2010 of 24 per cent. \r\n That progress is the result of investing in people. \r\nEducation and vocational training are the strategic axes \r\nof our governance and take up over half of our State \r\nbudget. We have also invested in health and social \r\nsecurity. Moreover, the Government is following a \r\nstrategy of making the country an international service \r\nprovider, so that it can compete in the world economy \r\n A/65/PV.22\r\n \r\n45 10-55276 \r\n \r\nand accelerate growth and job creation, thereby \r\nincreasing family income and significantly decreasing \r\npoverty. \r\n While we know that we must act quickly and \r\ndecisively to save the planet, we seem to drag our feet \r\nwhen it comes to matching concrete actions to our \r\nwords. While we proclaim the virtues of equality \r\nbetween men and women and gender parity — and \r\ntheir positive effects on development and therefore on \r\npeace and security — we still note that substantial \r\npolitical will at the national level and a determined \r\ndrive at the international level are still needed to push \r\nforward the fight to make women full partners in the \r\nfuture of the world. If peace is everywhere considered \r\na fundamental, legitimate aspiration of peoples and \r\nnations, and indeed a universal necessity, it is no less \r\ntrue that it must be won every day, and that millions of \r\nhuman beings wake to the sound of guns and wonder \r\nevery night if they will see the next morning or if their \r\nfamily will still be alive. Peace can no longer be a \r\nutopian dream or a fragile, always tentative reality, as \r\nin the Middle East, Central Africa or other places in the \r\nworld. \r\n In an increasingly interdependent and threatened \r\nworld, we need to give our collective energies a chance \r\nand not seclude ourselves in a defeatist attitude of \r\nisolation, bereft of any future. We must be innovative \r\nin our ways of thinking, in our political ideas and in \r\nour vision of the State. We must be innovative and \r\ncarry our innovation into our inter-State relations and \r\nour defence of our own interests, so as to promote \r\nequity and democracy in international relations, \r\npromote a greater awareness of fair exchange and \r\njustice in the relations of States and thereby foster \r\nsecurity for all, in a multilateralism driven by the \r\ncontributions of all members of the international \r\ncommunity, thus preserving the hope for peace all \r\naround the world.  \r\n All the great revealed religions talk of hope and \r\ncompassion. Will those universal values be condemned \r\nto remain the poor relations of international politics? \r\nLet us make of their inspired message the bedrock of \r\nour international relations. Let us make the individual \r\nhuman the centre of our national concerns and our \r\nglobal interests. That is the basis, it seems to me, of the \r\nresponsibility to protect that we proclaim here in this \r\nHall. Let us make that message a harbinger of the \r\nfuture for our nations and our peoples, for now more \r\nthan ever our destinies are shared and tied to our \r\nMother Earth. Humankind is humankind’s best \r\nmedicine, an old African proverb tells us. We can be if \r\nwe want to be. \r\n The President (spoke in French): We have heard \r\nthe last speaker in the general debate for this meeting. \r\nHowever, several representatives have asked to speak \r\nin exercise of the right of reply. Before calling on those \r\nrepresentatives, I remind members that statements \r\nmade in the exercise of the right of reply are limited to \r\n10 minutes for the first statement and five for the \r\nsecond and should be made by delegations from their \r\nseats. \r\n Mr. Nega (Ethiopia): I would like to thank you, \r\nMr. President, for giving me the opportunity to present \r\nmy delegation’s response in exercising our right of \r\nreply to the statement made by the delegation of the \r\nState of Eritrea this morning. \r\n Before responding to the specific accusations \r\nmade by the delegation of Eritrea, I would like to \r\nhighlight some of the distinctly aggressive behaviour \r\nof the incumbent Government in Asmara. First, in the \r\nmid-1990s, the regime invaded eastern Sudan, under \r\nthe cover of a rebel group that it organized, trained and \r\narmed against the Sudan, and it continues to meddle \r\nunabatedly in the internal affairs of that country, \r\nincluding in Darfur. Secondly, Eritrea invaded Yemen’s \r\nHanish Islands in the Red Sea in 1995 and remained in \r\noccupation there for more than two years. Thirdly, the \r\nEritrean regime attempted to invade the northern \r\nborders of Djibouti in 1997, but backed off due to \r\ninternational pressure. Eritrea nonetheless committed \r\nanother round of aggression against Djibouti in 2008 \r\nand remained in occupation of those areas until 2010, \r\nwhen it was forced to vacate under pressure from the \r\nSecurity Council and a combined face-saving \r\nmediation by third parties. Fourthly, the regime \r\nunleashed unprovoked aggression against Ethiopia in \r\nMay 1998 and occupied the northern borders of our \r\ncountry until its army was routed after facing a debacle \r\nat the hands of the Ethiopian defence forces in May \r\n2000. \r\n The Eritrean Government is campaigning wildly \r\nagainst my country to conceal the truth, alleging that \r\nwe were the aggressors and that Ethiopia continues to \r\noccupy sovereign Eritrean territory by refusing to \r\nimplement the decisions of the arbitration Commission \r\nestablished by the two parties — whereas the truth, as \r\nascertained by the Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims \r\nA/65/PV.22  \r\n \r\n10-55276 46 \r\n \r\nCommission, is that it was Eritrea that violated Article \r\n2, paragraph 4, of the United Nations Charter by \r\ninvading the sovereign territory of Ethiopia. Ethiopia \r\naccepted the Boundary Commission’s delimitation \r\ndecision and has clearly indicated, time and again, that \r\nthe demarcation on paper is a legal fiction. \r\nInternational law regarding border demarcation knows \r\nno such thing as demarcation on paper. Demarcation is \r\nthe implementation of the delimitation decision on the \r\nground; demarcation is placing boundary pillars on the \r\nground. \r\n Ethiopia, beyond any reasonable doubt, has been \r\nwilling to engage with Eritrea in demarcating the \r\ncommon border on the basis of the delimitation \r\ndecision of the Commission. Ethiopia has always been \r\nready to sit down and discuss with Eritrea in good faith \r\nthe sectors where the delimitation has not been clear or \r\nwhere differences in understanding or interpretation \r\nexist. Until such time as this occurs, it is obvious that \r\nEthiopia or Eritrea may be in control of each other’s \r\nterritory. \r\n I would like to emphasize that Eritrea’s alleged \r\nclaim that Ethiopia is occupying its territory is a \r\nfigment of its own imagination. The Boundary \r\nCommission had no mandate per the Algiers \r\nAgreement to transfer territory between the two \r\nparties. By the same token, as in the case of the dispute \r\nbetween Ethiopia and Eritrea, the United Nations has \r\nno power to enforce decisions of arbitration tribunals \r\nor to effect a transfer of territory or territorial \r\nsovereignty without a specific mandate given it by the \r\nparties. It is up to the parties to the Agreement to \r\nimplement the decision of the Boundary Commission, \r\nthat is, delimitation on the ground through \r\ndemarcation. \r\n Ethiopia is and has always been ready to carry \r\nout the second half of the Algiers Agreement, namely, a \r\ndemarcation-focused dialogue. It is Eritrea that has \r\nrefused to engage in dialogue with Ethiopia on the \r\ndemarcation of the border, by claiming ad nauseam the \r\nso-called occupation of sovereign Eritrean territory. \r\nEritrea is trying to use this to divert attention from its \r\ndestructive activities in the Horn of Africa by creating \r\na pretext for further aggression. \r\n All the Boundary Commission did in its \r\nstatement of 27 November 2006 was to indicate on \r\npaper the coordinates that describe the boundary. The \r\nCommission, in paragraph 22 of its statement, made \r\nthe following significant point, which Eritrea \r\nconveniently ignores. It reads, and I quote: “Until such \r\ntime as the boundary is finally demarcated, the \r\nDelimitation Decision of 13 April 2002 continues as \r\nthe only valid legal description of the boundary” \r\n(S/2006/992, enclosure, para. 22). In the final analysis, \r\nthe most important task that remains is to demarcate \r\nthe boundary on the ground as per the delimitation \r\ndecision, which would usher in a durable peace \r\nbetween the two parties. \r\n Mr. Salsabili (Islamic Republic of Iran): This \r\nafternoon, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates raised unacceptable claims about \r\nthe three Iranian islands located in the Persian Gulf, \r\nnamely, Abu Musa, Tonb-e Bozorg and Tonb-e Kuchak. \r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran categorically rejects those \r\nremarks as unacceptable claims against Iranian \r\nterritorial integrity and emphasizes that the three said \r\nislands, located in the Persian Gulf, are eternal parts of \r\nIranian territory and consequently are under its \r\nsovereignty. \r\n The Islamic Republic of Iran, while stressing its \r\ndetermination to continue its good-neighbourly and \r\nbrotherly relations with the neighbouring United Arab \r\nEmirates, reiterates that all actions and measures taken \r\nby the Iranian authorities in those Iranian islands are \r\nfully based on the sovereign rights of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran and on the principle of its territorial \r\nintegrity. The Islamic Republic of Iran stands ready to \r\ncontinue its bilateral talks with the relevant officials of \r\nthe United Arab Emirates, with a view to removing any \r\nmisunderstanding that may arise with regard to \r\nimplementation of the arrangements emanating from \r\nthe documents exchanged in 1971 on Abu Musa island. \r\n Ms. Haile (Eritrea): I am taking the floor in \r\nexercise of the right of reply in connection with the \r\nstatement just delivered by the representative of \r\nEthiopia. The representative of Ethiopia made several \r\nunfounded accusations that contribute nothing to the \r\npeace and security of the region. My delegation \r\ncategorically rejects all such accusations. \r\n Let me set the record straight. The Eritrea-\r\nEthiopia Boundary Commission (EEBC), established \r\nby Eritrea and Ethiopia pursuant to article 4, paragraph \r\n2, of the Algiers Peace Agreement, has put to rest the \r\nborder dispute between the two countries. Referring to \r\nthe EEBC’s twenty-sixth report (S/2008/40, annex II), \r\nthe Secretary-General states that  \r\n A/65/PV.22\r\n \r\n47 10-55276 \r\n \r\n “the boundary between Ethiopia and Eritrea now \r\nautomatically stands as demarcated by the \r\nboundary points (coordinates) listed in the annex \r\nto the Commission’s Statement of 27 November \r\n2006, and that [the Commission] considers this \r\ndecision as binding on the parties. The \r\nCommission further asserted that it ‘has fulfilled \r\nits mandate’”. (S/2008/40, para. 40) \r\n Therefore, the crux of the matter is Ethiopia’s \r\ncontinued occupation of sovereign Eritrean territory, in \r\ndefiance of the ruling of the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary \r\nCommission. No campaigns of misinformation or the \r\nraising of irrelevant issues in this body will erase that \r\nfact. Ethiopia has to face up to its obligations if it is \r\ninterested in the peace and stability of the region. \r\nThere is no need to beat around the bush: had Ethiopia \r\nnot reneged on its commitment and had cooperated \r\nfully with the independent Boundary Commission, the \r\nissue between the two countries could have been \r\nresolved then and there, and the successful conclusion \r\nof the Algiers Peace Agreement would have brought \r\nthe huge suffering of the two peoples to an end in no \r\ntime.  \r\n The peaceful settlement of disputes is the core \r\nprinciple of the United Nations Charter. But Ethiopia \r\nhas shown its disdain for international law and its lack \r\nof interest in the peaceful and legal resolution of \r\ndisputes. The Algiers Peace Agreement provides for the \r\nestablishment of three commissions. Two of the \r\ncommissions have been established and have \r\ncompleted their work. The third commission, with the \r\nauthority to determine the origins of the conflict, has \r\nnot yet been established. That task cannot be demanded \r\nof any other commission. \r\n Mr. Al-Yafei (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in \r\nArabic): I thank you, Mr. President, for giving me the \r\nfloor to comment on the remarks by the representative \r\nof the Islamic Republic of Iran. \r\n My delegation expresses its regret at the repeated \r\nposition of Iran, which has rejected the numerous \r\npeace initiatives my country has announced to resolve \r\nthe conflict over the three occupied Emirates islands of \r\nAbu Musa, Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb through \r\nbilateral negotiations or through recourse to the \r\nInternational Court of Justice to seek a legal opinion.  \r\n We reiterate our rejection of Iran’s occupation \r\nand of all military and civilian measures it has taken on \r\nthe islands with a view to changing their historical and \r\ndemographic nature and imposing a fait accompli of \r\noccupation. We are disappointed that Iran has repeated \r\nits position calling for dealing with marginal issues \r\npertaining to the outcome of the occupation of the \r\nislands, rather than dealing with the main issue of \r\noccupation itself. \r\n The United Arab Emirates hopes that the \r\ninternational community will support its position, \r\nwhich calls upon the Islamic Republic of Iran to \r\nreconsider its policy of illegal occupation of the islands \r\nand to respond to our peace initiatives, which aim at \r\nreaching a comprehensive and just settlement to the \r\nissue of these islands in a manner that strengthens \r\nsecurity, stability and economic cooperation among the \r\ncountries of the region. \r\n Mr. Núñez Mosquera (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nI marvel at seeing how the Permanent Representative \r\nof  Sweden, representative of a supposedly civilized \r\nand incorruptible country, assumes the right to judge \r\nother countries — always poor and underdeveloped \r\ncountries of the South — on the issue of human rights. \r\nThe Ambassador spoke, judged, handed down his \r\nverdict and abandoned the Hall. I asked him to stay to \r\nhear my reply, but he left. I ask myself with what right \r\nand moral authority he dares to judge and give \r\nopinions on no fewer than eight countries that are \r\nrespectable and worthy Members of this Organization. \r\nWho told him that he could lecture Cubans on human \r\nrights, something about which we are deeply proud? \r\n As the entire international community is aware, \r\nSweden is among the countries to have authorized \r\nillegal secret flights over its territory by the United \r\nStates Central Intelligence Agency. That is a dark \r\nchapter in Sweden’s actions, which it has yet to clarify. \r\nWhen one asks a Swedish official about this, they say \r\nthat the relevant investigations are being carried out. \r\nThey have been investigating for several years. They \r\nare trying to cover up the issue, but peoples do not \r\nhave such short memories. \r\n I could also refer to the situation of prostitution \r\nin Sweden and of the assaults, including sexual abuse, \r\nagainst women and girls in that country. But, in the \r\ninterests of time, I shall not do so. I merely ask: When \r\nis the Swedish Government going to finish its \r\ninvestigations on the illegal flights over its territory? \r\nWhen will the Swedish Government renounce double \r\nstandards and political manipulation on such a noble \r\nA/65/PV.22  \r\n \r\n10-55276 48 \r\n \r\nissue as human rights? How long will they try to \r\ncontinue to mislead the General Assembly? \r\n Mr. Tag-Eldin (Egypt): I take the floor in the \r\nexercise of the right of reply to respond to the false \r\nallegation made in the statement that was delivered by \r\nthe representative of Sweden, which included baseless \r\nclaims about the situation of the freedom of expression \r\nin my country, among other countries. \r\n The representative of Sweden should know better. \r\nHe should know that Egypt has been in the lead of \r\npolitical reform in the Middle East. Freedom of \r\nexpression is guaranteed, by our constitution and \r\npractice, to each and every Egyptian citizen. In Egypt, \r\nwe have more than 300 newspapers and journals \r\npublished daily, representing all views from every \r\ncorner of Egyptian society and political life.  \r\n It was therefore shocking to hear the \r\nrepresentative of Sweden refer to my country in this \r\nmanner. We would like to advise the representative of \r\nSweden to become better educated about Egypt and its \r\ncomprehensive reforms aimed at ensuring a better life \r\nfor Egyptian citizens and guaranteeing full respect for \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms, including the \r\nfreedom of expression. \r\n Egypt totally and flatly rejects such allegations. \r\nThe representative of Sweden should know the \r\ndifference between freedom of expression and insulting \r\nprophets and defaming religions in his country, before \r\nevaluating the situation of freedom of expression in \r\nother countries. \r\n Mr. Ren Yisheng (China) (spoke in Chinese): I \r\nwould like to speak in exercise of the right of reply \r\nwith respect to the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of Sweden. The Chinese Government \r\nhas always protected the economic, social and cultural \r\nrights of its citizens, in keeping with the law. Our \r\nGovernment attaches equal importance to other \r\ncategories of rights such as freedom of expression. \r\nSince the beginning of the reform process, the human  \r\n \r\nrights situation in China has greatly improved. This is \r\nsomething that is recognized by everybody; something \r\nthat no one can deny. \r\n In the course of its history, Sweden has seen \r\nsome dark incidents of human rights violations. Today \r\nit continues to violate the rights of minorities within its \r\nborders. One might say the human rights situation in \r\nSweden is rather sombre. That country does not have \r\nthe right to point fingers at others over human rights \r\nsituations. Without mentioning the human rights \r\nsituation in his own country, the representative of \r\nSweden commented on human rights situations in other \r\ncountries. This utterly twists the truth and is a clear \r\nexample of double standards.  \r\n The Chinese delegation categorically rejects the \r\nunfounded accusations made by the representative of \r\nSweden. \r\n The President (spoke in French): Before giving \r\nthe floor once again to the representative of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran, I remind him that second statements \r\nin exercise of the right of reply are limited to five \r\nminutes. \r\n Mr. Salsabili (Islamic Republic of Iran): I \r\napologize for taking the floor again. This time, I wish \r\nto make some remarks relating to the representative of \r\nSweden and the human rights situation in Iran and to \r\nthe statement made by the representative of Ireland \r\nyesterday (see A/65/PV.20). I wish to say that, in \r\nreferring to human rights issues in my country while \r\nignoring their own records of human rights violations, \r\nthese countries are serving their own political interests \r\nand considerations. I recommend that both of these \r\ncountries avoid abusing the rostrum of this United \r\nNations body to level politically motivated, distorted \r\nand false accusations against others. \r\n The President (spoke in French): We have heard \r\nthe last speaker in exercise of the right of reply. \r\n  The meeting rose at 8.25 p.m. \r\n"
