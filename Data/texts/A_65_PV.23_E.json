(Switzerland) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 9.10 a.m.  \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\n \r\nGeneral debate \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Wilfred Elrington, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs and Foreign Trade of Belize. \r\n Mr. Elrington (Belize): Please permit me, Sir, on \r\nbehalf of the Belize delegation to congratulate you on \r\nyour election to the presidency of the sixty-fifth \r\nsession of the United Nations General Assembly. As \r\nmuch as our peoples share common values of peace \r\nand democracy, your country and my own could not be \r\nmore different. Switzerland is landlocked with a land \r\nmass twice the size and a population 25 times that of \r\nmy coastal country. Belize has a $1 billion economy \r\nand Switzerland has a $400 billion economy. Nominal \r\ngross domestic product per capita in Switzerland is \r\nestimated at $67,000, while in Belize that figure is \r\nroughly $4,000.  \r\n I bring up the differences between Belize and \r\nSwitzerland because they are illustrative of the stark \r\ndifferences that epitomize today’s world. We in this \r\nHall tout sovereign equality, but we experience social \r\nand economic disparity on a daily basis, across the \r\nglobe. Inequality persists between nations and within \r\nnations. Poverty proliferates in the midst of plenty. \r\n In my own country, although real output per \r\ncapita grew over the past 10 years, so too did the \r\nproportion of Belizeans living in poverty. In other words, \r\nwe experienced growth without the commensurate \r\ndevelopment of our people. \r\n Belize accepts that development is a matter of \r\nnational responsibility. However, our contemporary \r\nreality now renders questions that were hitherto matters \r\nof national concern, matters of global concern. As a \r\nconsequence of globalization, the management \r\ncapacity of a State has diminished. Our macroeconomic \r\npolicy and fiscal capacity cannot adequately address \r\nthe multiple exogenous shocks occasioned, inter alia, \r\nby the triumvirate of the financial, food and fuel crises. \r\n Adequate and appropriate international support at \r\nthis time is therefore critical if we are to avoid drifting \r\nfurther and further away from the attainment of our \r\ndevelopment goals. In that connection, developed \r\nnations urgently need to make good their promise to \r\ndeliver 0.7 per cent of their GDP for official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA). \r\n For Belize, meaningful international support is \r\nbecoming increasingly harder to come by because of \r\nour designation as a middle-income country. While we \r\ncontinue to benefit from ODA and foreign direct \r\ninvestment in our quest to further integrate Belize into \r\nthe global economy, for the most part expensive \r\nforeign and local commercial debt has in fact fuelled \r\nthe country’s development strategy. \r\n Thus, in the past 15 years, Belize has built up a \r\nhigh level of public debt, with high-cost long-term \r\nfinancing. The ratio of public debt to GDP grew \r\nsteadily, from about 27 per cent in 1995 to 70.3 per \r\ncent in 2008, with a peak of 87 per cent in 2005. That \r\nA/65/PV.23  \r\n \r\n10-55396 2 \r\n \r\ndebt-led strategy, which was the model of many other \r\ncountries, will surely become an unwelcome and \r\nunwanted burden for our children. \r\n Perennial debt-servicing obligations constrain my \r\nGovernment’s capacity to increase social investments, \r\nespecially in those areas where they are most needed. It \r\nis therefore not surprising that Belize finds itself off \r\ntrack in meeting Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) on poverty, hunger, education and the \r\nempowerment of women. Considering the synergies \r\nbetween Goals, slippage in one threatens the \r\nachievement of others. \r\n The terms of engagement between international \r\nfinancial institutions and middle-income countries \r\nmust be revised if countries such as my own are to \r\nbreak away from the vicious cycle of debt-led \r\ndevelopment. While those terms will necessarily have \r\nto provide for suitable risk-mitigation strategies, they \r\nshould not be so burdensome as to constrain our policy \r\nspace. They must respect the national ownership of our \r\ndevelopment initiatives. International cooperation and \r\nsupport therefore must complement, rather than dictate, \r\nthe way forward. \r\n While Belize’s traditional donors have long \r\nprovided valuable assistance, for which we will always \r\nbe grateful, we are now benefiting from new modalities \r\nof cooperation, which are yielding more direct and \r\nimmediate returns for our people. Belize’s cooperation \r\nexperience with Taiwan exemplifies a model of \r\ncooperation based on partnership. With the help of the \r\nGovernment of Taiwan, Belize has steadily developed \r\nits capacity in agricultural research, aquaculture, \r\neducation and social-sector investment. \r\n In the Latin American and Caribbean region, \r\ncooperation has long been based on that approach. \r\nBelize has benefited immensely from partnerships with \r\nCuba, Brazil, Mexico and Venezuela. Of special \r\nsignificance is the cooperation in the health sector. In \r\nfact, today the progress that we can claim on the \r\nhealth-related MDGs is a testament, in part, to those \r\npartnerships. \r\n Beyond our hemispheric relations, we are forging \r\nnew partnerships. We recently received two years’ \r\nworth of emergency relief materials from the United \r\nArab Emirates, for which we are most appreciative, \r\ngiven the frequency of hurricane visitations to our \r\nshores in recent years. Through those partnerships, \r\nBelize is being enabled to pursue its broader national \r\ndevelopment objectives. Our experience is being \r\nreplicated the world over, as we see in other examples \r\nof South-South cooperation. We need now to make \r\nthose partnerships the standard for global cooperation. \r\n At the United Nations, we have long focused on \r\nofficial development assistance as being synonymous \r\nwith global partnerships. That myopic view needs to be \r\nbroadened, and we must disabuse ourselves of the \r\ndonor-driven dialectic. The United Nations has the \r\nresponsibility to craft a new orientation, from a donor-\r\nrecipient culture to one of true partnership with mutual \r\nrespect.  \r\n As every speaker in this debate has emphasized, \r\nin order for this institution to meet that challenge, it \r\nmust itself reform. \r\n Current decision-making structures and \r\norganization tend towards a North-South polarity. That \r\ndynamic imperils cooperation and renders debate more \r\nceremony than meaningful dialogue. Over the 65 years \r\nof the United Nations existence, our world has \r\nchanged. We are dealing with new realities. The \r\nOrganization is nearly universal, with 192 countries \r\nrepresented here. The club of nuclear-power States has \r\nexpanded, and may yet continue to expand. Global \r\nintegration has deepened with technology, market \r\nliberalization and the freer movement of capital. Our \r\ninterdependence has generated global systemic risks.  \r\n We need a United Nations that reflects more \r\nequitable North-South representation and that can \r\neffectively deliver. That means that the organs of the \r\nUnited Nations must be reformed. The process of \r\ndecision-making must ensure coherence and be \r\ninclusive. Above all, equity and justice must inform \r\nour mechanisms for delivery. The reform we seek goes \r\nmuch deeper than the changing of the guards; it is a \r\nreform that would rebuild trust among each other and \r\nconfidence in the system. \r\n Belize is crafting a twenty-first century vision for \r\na modern, green and sustainable economy predicated \r\non capacity-building, human dignity, human \r\ndevelopment and innovation. Our Government is \r\nworking towards building domestic capital through \r\nsocial investments, job creation, improved access to \r\ncredit and combating crime and violence. \r\n To that end, we have launched project Restore \r\nBelize, which encompasses a comprehensive anti-crime \r\ninitiative complemented by a socio-economic \r\n A/65/PV.23\r\n \r\n3 10-55396 \r\n \r\ncomponent aimed at restoring the social fabric of our \r\nsociety through the provision of skills training, \r\ncontinuing education for adults, infrastructure \r\ndevelopment and fostering civic pride. We have \r\ninstituted school feeding programmes, subsidies for \r\nstudents of secondary schools, seed programmes for \r\nfarmers and capitalization of our own development \r\nfinance corporation for onward lending to \r\nentrepreneurs.  \r\n The Government has also undertaken a national \r\nmultiparty and multisectoral consultative process to \r\nredefine our national development objectives in our \r\nHorizon 2030 project. In addition, the Prime Minister \r\nhas established a council of science advisers to better \r\ninform the Horizon 2030 process on the integration of \r\nscience and technology in the national development \r\nagenda. \r\n Belize is resolutely embracing its responsibility \r\nfor its national development. Our efforts are aimed \r\ntowards ensuring that we achieve the type of \r\ndevelopment that genuinely affords all our people the \r\nopportunity to realize their true potential with dignity. \r\nTo that end, we seek only empathy and partnership \r\nfrom the United Nations, not charity. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. S. M. Krishna, Minister for \r\nExternal Affairs of India. \r\n Mr. Krishna (India): Allow me to begin by \r\ncongratulating you, Sir, on your election as President \r\nof the General Assembly and by assuring you of the \r\nfull cooperation of my delegation. In the interest of \r\nsaving the Assembly’s valuable time, I will read out \r\nonly part of my address, the full text of which has been \r\ncirculated.  \r\n The United Nations was created, 65 years ago, to \r\nsave succeeding generations from the scourge of war, \r\nto affirm faith in fundamental rights, to establish \r\nconditions under which respect for international law \r\ncan be maintained and to promote social progress and \r\nbetter standards of life in larger freedom. Six and a half \r\ndecades later, globalization has made the world a much \r\nsmaller place. It has also created conditions whereby \r\nthe problems and challenges of one country or region \r\ncan very quickly become those of the larger community \r\nof nations. \r\n Terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of \r\nmass destruction, maritime piracy, pandemics and \r\nepidemics, organized crime and narcotics smuggling \r\nrecognize no borders or boundaries. Similarly, the \r\nfallout of intra-State conflicts, failed States, climate \r\nchange, natural disasters, food shortages and financial \r\nand economic crises transcend countries and regions. \r\nUnder those circumstances the international \r\ncommunity looks to the United Nations to overcome \r\nthe common challenges of humankind through the \r\nharmonized actions of nations, as stated in the Charter. \r\n The United Nations is the only organization that \r\ncan be at the centre of an international governance \r\nsystem. However, it needs urgent reform to reflect \r\ncontemporary realities and to effectively meet \r\nemerging global challenges. The first step has to be the \r\nreform of the Security Council. The overwhelming \r\nmajority of the membership has been clear in seeking \r\nan expansion in both the permanent and non-permanent \r\ncategories of membership. It is imperative that we \r\nbring the negotiations to an early and logical \r\nconclusion. \r\n We must also truly revitalize the General \r\nAssembly. It must reclaim its position on vital matters \r\nsuch as the appointment of the Secretary-General and \r\nthe relationship between the United Nations and the \r\nBretton Woods institutions. Along with the Economic \r\nand Social Council, the General Assembly should also \r\nset the paradigms of multilateral engagement for the \r\nglobal economy and for development and \r\ndevelopmental cooperation.  \r\n It is matter of much satisfaction that this year we \r\nhave significantly advanced the United Nations reform \r\nagenda in the areas of gender equality and women’s \r\nempowerment. I wish to reiterate our strong \r\ncommitment to UN Women and to its strengthening.  \r\n We also need to ensure that the review of the \r\nHuman Rights Council this year adds to the Council’s \r\nrole as an effective, credible and premier United \r\nNations mechanism dealing with human rights.  \r\n My Government accords the highest priority to \r\nthe attainment of the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nOur development challenges were exacerbated by the \r\nfinancial and economic crisis that started in 2008. \r\nActing in concert, the Group of 20 (G-20), which \r\nincludes the largest developed and developing \r\ncountries, reacted promptly and purposefully to stem \r\nthe global slowdown and send a strong message of \r\nconfidence and stability. India believes that the  \r\nG-20 — the premier forum for international economic \r\nA/65/PV.23  \r\n \r\n10-55396 4 \r\n \r\ncooperation — can help catalyse strong, balanced and \r\nsustainable growth for the benefit of everyone. \r\n As a country vulnerable to, and already suffering \r\nfrom, the impacts of climate change, India has an \r\nimportant stake in the success of ongoing international \r\nnegotiations in that regard. There is no substitute to the \r\nUnited Nations-led process, with its inherent \r\ninclusiveness and transparency, to lead us to an \r\nambitious and equitable outcome that respects the \r\nprovisions and principles of the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, in \r\nparticular the principle of common but differentiated \r\nresponsibilities and respective capabilities. It is \r\nimportant that there be acceptance of equal sharing of \r\nthe resource of the atmosphere for all human beings. \r\n India has an abiding commitment to achieve \r\nuniversal and non-discriminatory nuclear disarmament \r\nwithin a specified time frame — a vision that was most \r\neloquently articulated in the Assembly by Prime \r\nMinister Rajiv Gandhi in 1988. More than two decades \r\nlater, that goal still remains distant. Meanwhile, newer \r\nthreats have emerged, including the danger of terrorists \r\ngaining access to weapons of mass destruction. \r\n India introduced a working paper on nuclear \r\ndisarmament in 2006, which contained specific \r\nproposals that reflect the spirit and substance of the \r\nRajiv Gandhi action plan. We call for an intensification \r\nof discussion and dialogue among Member States and \r\nthe larger non-governmental community, so as to \r\nstrengthen an international consensus that can be \r\ntranslated into concrete action to achieve nuclear \r\ndisarmament.  \r\n India remains committed to the negotiations in \r\nthe Conference on Disarmament on a multilateral,  \r\nnon-discriminatory and internationally verifiable fissile \r\nmaterial cut-off treaty that meets India’s national \r\nsecurity interests. We hope that the Conference will be \r\nable to commence negotiations at an early date. We \r\nremain committed to a unilateral and voluntary \r\nmoratorium on nuclear-explosives testing. \r\n Terrorism has emerged as one of the most serious \r\nthreats to international peace and security. To defeat it, \r\nit is imperative for the global community to build on \r\ninternational cooperation and take concerted action \r\nagainst terrorists and their sponsors. There can be no \r\njustification for terrorism, just as there can be no good \r\nor bad terrorists. We urge Member States to display the \r\nnecessary political will to finalize and adopt the \r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism. \r\n Peace and stability in South Asia is one of our \r\nhighest priorities. We are committed to good-\r\nneighbourly relations with all our neighbours, \r\nincluding Pakistan. In that spirit of solidarity with the \r\npeople of Pakistan in their hour of need we pledged \r\n$25 million in aid, which is being channelled through \r\nthe United Nations for flood relief efforts in that \r\ncountry. As a neighbour, we wish to provide succour \r\nand relief in a timely manner to the victims of that \r\nnatural disaster. We are saddened by the loss of life and \r\nproperty that Pakistan has suffered as a result of the \r\nunprecedented floods. \r\n It is well known that many countries have deep-\r\nrooted concerns about the growth and consolidation of \r\nmilitancy and terrorism in Pakistan. We share those \r\nconcerns, particularly because Jammu and Kashmir, \r\nwhich is an integral part of India, has been the target of \r\nsuch Pakistan-sponsored militancy and terrorism for \r\nmany years now. Pakistan must fulfil its solemn \r\ncommitment not to allow territory under its control to \r\nbe used for terrorism directed against India. Credible \r\nand firm action by Pakistan against terrorist groups \r\noperating from its soil is in the interest of the region, as \r\nit is in Pakistan’s own interest.  \r\n Pakistan cannot impart lessons to us on \r\ndemocracy and human rights. If, however, Pakistan \r\nwere to live up to its commitment not to allow the use \r\nof territory under its control by terrorists acting against \r\nIndia, that would significantly help reduce the trust \r\ndeficit that impedes the development of better bilateral \r\nrelations between our two countries. We are \r\nneighbours, and as neighbours we have an obligation to \r\nwork together. \r\n Afghanistan recently successfully concluded \r\nparliamentary elections. We believe the international \r\ncommunity needs to be steadfast in its engagement \r\nwith Afghanistan to ensure the success of its \r\nreconstruction efforts and its emergence as a \r\ndemocratic, pluralistic and prosperous society. The \r\ncontinuing existence of safe havens and sanctuaries for \r\nterrorists beyond Afghanistan’s borders is the major \r\nimpediment to the restoration of peace and security in \r\nAfghanistan. That should be a primary focus of the \r\ninternational community. \r\n Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s first Prime \r\nMinister, said in 1948:  \r\n A/65/PV.23\r\n \r\n5 10-55396 \r\n \r\n “The fundamental principles on which the United \r\nNations is based are right principles. We believe \r\nin those fundamental principles and want to help \r\nthe Organization in following these principles.” \r\nThe Government and the more than 1 billion people of \r\nIndia have stood by that commitment. I would like to \r\nsolemnly reaffirm our faith in the principles that \r\nunderlie the United Nations, and in the United Nations \r\nsystem itself. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Luis Almagro, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Uruguay. \r\n Mr. Almagro (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): Our \r\ngoals at the national level are goals we also want to see \r\nachieved in the international community. They are \r\ngoals that the international community must tackle as \r\npriorities. They include eradicating indigence and \r\nreducing and eliminating poverty and its root causes, as \r\nwell as ensuring a dignified life and favourable \r\nworking conditions for all. We also want an \r\ninternational system that is more democratic and \r\nefficient. We want the issues that I have mentioned to \r\nbe resolved through cross-cutting policies. We can \r\nwork to promote democracy in every country of the \r\nsystem, but we are badly off indeed if the law of the \r\nstrongest prevails in the overall system.  \r\n Uruguay will always take a moral and ethical \r\napproach to every issue, whether with regard to the \r\nenvironment, human rights or international security. In \r\nevery instance, the ultimate guide is the human person. \r\nWe must in the end, therefore, always rely on our \r\nconscience. However, the functioning of the system is \r\ncrucial, for that is what generates social, territorial and \r\ngender inequality. \r\n At the outset, we welcome the election of the \r\nArgentine Republic as Chair of the Group of 77 and \r\nChina. Argentina is a brotherly country that shares \r\ncommon principles and values with us. \r\n Uruguay, in keeping with its historical path and \r\ntraditions, reaffirms its commitment to the principles of \r\ninternational law. I would like to underscore in \r\nparticular our firm support for the peaceful solution of \r\nconflicts; the sovereign equality of States; the \r\nprinciples of non-intervention and of the self-\r\ndetermination of peoples; respect for human rights; \r\ninternational socio-economic cooperation; and \r\nmultilateralism. The maximum expression of those \r\nprinciples is to be found in this Organization. \r\n I would also like to express our rejection of the \r\nuse or the threat of use of force, of terrorism and of all \r\ntypes of violence, and of the application of coercive \r\nmeasures in contravention of the Charter of the United \r\nNations, such as the economic, financial and trade \r\nembargo against Cuba by the United States, which we \r\nfirmly reject. That unilateral measure is contrary, not \r\nonly to the Charter but also to international law and to \r\none of the most dearly held principles of my country’s \r\nforeign policy, namely, the peaceful settlements of \r\ndisputes. \r\n Uruguay is party to the principal international \r\nconventions relating to the environment and \r\nsustainable development. Thus, we have reaffirmed our \r\nresponsibility for the protection of the environment as \r\na human right and a fundamental component for \r\nachieving truly sustainable development. \r\n Uruguay has a long history of defending, \r\npromoting and protecting human rights and \r\ninternational humanitarian law. Those principles are a \r\ncentral priority of the State, enshrined in the traditional \r\npillars of the Republic’s foreign policy, which \r\nconstitute the political and institutional foundations of \r\nthe country. We welcome the progress made this year \r\nin Kampala, Uganda, which has led to the \r\nstrengthening of the regime established under the \r\nStatute of the International Criminal Court. Uruguay is \r\namong the countries that have subscribed to the widest \r\nrange of conventions in the area of human rights and \r\ninternational humanitarian law. \r\n Uruguay’s long-standing tradition of defending \r\nthose principles has allowed us to take a leading role \r\nin, among other areas, the protection and promotion of \r\nthe rights of children. We believe it is vitally important \r\nthat we continue to focus our efforts to promote the \r\ndefence and protection of children and to ensure their \r\nwell-being. \r\n We also reaffirm our full support for the \r\nintegration of a gender perspective into all policies and \r\nprogrammes of the United Nations system. In that \r\nrespect, we welcome the adoption of the resolution \r\n(resolution 64/289) on the coherence of the United \r\nNations system, which, in particular, created the new \r\nUnited Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the \r\nEmpowerment of Women. We would also like to \r\nexpress our satisfaction with the appointment of  \r\nA/65/PV.23  \r\n \r\n10-55396 6 \r\n \r\nMs. Michelle Bachelet, former President of Chile, as \r\nUnder-Secretary-General for UN Women. We are \r\nconfident that her experience will serve as a vital asset \r\nfor the new Entity. \r\n Uruguay has a steadfast commitment to the cause \r\nof peace and our country’s foreign policy bears \r\ntestimony to that fact. We have given decisive support \r\nto all measures aimed at the elimination of nuclear \r\narms and other weapons of mass destruction. We have \r\nalso advocated the control and reduction of \r\nconventional weapons. We underscore, once again, the \r\nimportance of the swift universal implementation of \r\nthese agreements. \r\n Likewise, and without prejudice to the \r\nreaffirmation of our hope to see a Nuclear Weapons \r\nConvention, we believe that the entry into force of the \r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and a fissile \r\nmaterial cut-off treaty during the present year, would \r\nconstitute decisive steps in the consolidation and \r\ndeepening of the progress made in the area of \r\ndisarmament. We must not stop, because to stop is to \r\ngo backwards, and to go backwards is to expose \r\nhumanity to the horrendous and unacceptable risk of \r\nnuclear holocaust. \r\n It is our hope that, in 2012, a conference will be \r\nheld, without further delay or conditions, in which all \r\nof the States of the Middle East will participate, with \r\nthe aim of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone, \r\nfree of all other weapons of mass destruction as well, \r\nthrough freely agreed arrangements between the States \r\nof the region, with the full support and commitment of \r\nthose States that possess nuclear weapons. Similarly, \r\nUruguay supports the Secretary-General’s five-point \r\ninitiative for a world free of nuclear weapons. \r\n Uruguay actively participates in the United \r\nNations multilateral system of peacekeeping and \r\nmaintenance of international security, as well as in \r\nefforts to defend human rights and uphold international \r\nhumanitarian law through peacekeeping operations, \r\nbased on our conviction that these are a solid testimony \r\nto the collective commitment of the international \r\ncommunity as a whole. That commitment on the part of \r\nmy country can be seen both on the ground, through \r\nour deployment of more than 2,500 Blue Helmets, \r\ndeployed principally in Haiti and the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, and in its work on the political \r\nlevel here at Headquarters. \r\n We recognize that the Security Council holds the \r\nprimary responsibility for the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. But we believe it is \r\nextremely important to promote a closer relationship \r\nbetween the Council and the General Assembly. The \r\ngreater the distance between them, the more difficult it \r\nis for peacekeeping operations to achieve their \r\nobjectives and for their complex mandates to be \r\neffectively implemented. \r\n In this respect, the existing gap between the \r\ncomplexity of the mandates and the resources available \r\nposes a challenge that we must confront every day. We \r\nare convinced that is of fundamental importance for us \r\nto ensure that adequate consideration is given to the \r\nallocation of the resources needed for the proper \r\nfunctioning of those operations. The conditions offered \r\nby the system also need to be updated, so that the \r\nUnited Nations has at its disposal the equipment and \r\nhuman resources that it needs. That subject affects \r\ndeveloping countries in particular, since it is they \r\nwhich provide the large majority of the troops and thus \r\nthe viability of their participation in missions is at \r\nstake. \r\n The case of Haiti probably provides one of the \r\nbest illustrations of the need for a cross-cutting \r\npolitical effort to lift a country out of a situation of \r\ncrisis and institutional and social stagnation. \r\n Uruguay has never been indifferent to the \r\nchallenges that this brotherly country has had to \r\nconfront and continues to confront today. From 2004 to \r\ndate, we have deployed more than 10,000 military \r\npersonnel to the United Nations Stabilization Mission \r\nin Haiti, who have faithfully carried out the mandate \r\napproved by the Security Council for the stabilization \r\nprocess in that country. \r\n In its role as coordinator of the Group of Friends \r\nof Haiti, Uruguay has for some years been advocating \r\nfor a mandate that, without neglecting the urgent \r\nsecurity needs, permits at the same time the \r\nestablishment of the conditions necessary for \r\nstrengthening the productive capacity of the country, \r\nwhich was seriously affected by the earthquake of  \r\n12 January 2010. \r\n In our view, greater emphasis should be placed on \r\nproviding teachers, doctors, engineers, agronomists, \r\nexperts in information technologies and volunteer \r\nworkers, who could contribute effectively to solving \r\nthe problems of the Haitian population. Investing in \r\n A/65/PV.23\r\n \r\n7 10-55396 \r\n \r\nhuman resources in Haiti is of fundamental importance \r\nfor the future development of the country. \r\n Over the past two years, there has been an open \r\nprocess of restructuring the peacekeeping system, \r\nwhich was necessary given the new reality that we are \r\nfacing. That process must be viewed as part of a larger \r\nproject of reform of the Organization, which, through \r\nvarious initiatives, seeks to be more effective, to work \r\nin a more coordinated manner and to enjoy greater \r\nlegitimacy. \r\n Uruguay reiterates its adherence to that process \r\nof reform of the United Nations. The process, begun \r\nduring the 2005 Summit, which gave rise to the creation \r\nof two new structures within the Organization — the \r\nHuman Rights Council and the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission — should be brought to completion \r\nthrough the consideration of various outstanding \r\ntopics, including the reform of the Security Council. \r\nThe current international reality is such that that body \r\nneeds to be more representative and democratic. We \r\nmust therefore take steps to effect its expansion, while \r\nguarding against an extension of the historical \r\nobstacles that run contrary to the principle of the \r\nsovereign equality of States, such as the right of veto. \r\n A very clear example of Uruguay’s commitment \r\nto the United Nations reform process, which seeks to \r\nestablish greater effectiveness and coordination within \r\nthe system, is its direct participation in the “Delivering \r\nas One” programme. Three years after the pilot \r\nprogramme was launched in Uruguay, we have recently \r\ncompleted the country evaluation and can affirm that \r\nthe design, implementation, follow-up and evaluation \r\nof the process have contributed to the national \r\nGovernment’s efforts to strengthen the coordination \r\namong the various State bodies through a joint \r\nprogramming exercise, which made possible greater \r\ninteraction between agencies, the Government and the \r\nUnited Nations system. \r\n Uruguay has formally expressed its aspiration to \r\noccupy a seat as a non-permanent member of the \r\nSecurity Council for the period 2016-2017. We are the \r\nonly candidate country in the region at the present \r\ntime. Since its accession to the United Nations as a \r\nfounding Member and despite having pursued a foreign \r\npolicy inspired by the same purposes, principles and \r\nideals enshrined in the United Nations Charter, \r\nUruguay has occupied a seat in the Security Council \r\nonly once, which was during the period 1965-1966. \r\n Presenting one’s candidacy to the body in which \r\nthe international community has entrusted the current \r\nglobal collective security system constitutes the most \r\ndemanding test of a State’s foreign policy. In the \r\npresent context, which is profoundly marked by \r\nmultiple global crises, it is imperative that we work \r\njointly towards building long-term strategies and \r\nsolutions that will lead us to more just and equitable \r\nsocieties. \r\n In that regard, the role of the United Nations in \r\ninternational economic and financial governance is \r\nfundamental in terms of democratizing decision-\r\nmaking and ensuring equal participation in global \r\ndecisions that affect us all and directly impact strategic \r\nplanning in the short, medium and long term. \r\nCoordinated, transparent and harmonious decision-\r\nmaking is essential for achieving tangible results that \r\nimprove the living conditions and situation of the \r\nworld’s citizens. Our country deems it important to \r\npromote dialogue in order to foster bridge-building \r\namong the various decision-making forums.  \r\n We must be aware that without a healthy natural \r\nenvironment, all other development efforts will have a \r\nlimited effect. In that context, the global phenomenon \r\nof climate change is perhaps the most urgent and \r\ndramatic challenge currently facing humanity. It poses \r\nadditional challenges to development and forces us to \r\nurgently consider the need to implement measures to \r\nadapt to and mitigate its adverse effects. Such \r\nmeasures require changes in production methods and \r\nseriously compromise the distribution of domestic \r\nresources. \r\n Achieving sustainable development that takes \r\ninto account the economic, social and environmental \r\ndimensions is fundamental to ensuring long-term \r\nresults and a healthy environment for present and \r\nfuture generations as well as sustained economic \r\ngrowth. That goal is also a necessary precondition for \r\nreducing disparities between the developed world and \r\nthe developing world, particularly in the quality of life, \r\nincome distribution and human development \r\nindicators. \r\n In closing, Uruguay would like to reaffirm the \r\nimperative necessity of renewed political commitment \r\naimed at achieving an open and equitable multilateral \r\ntrade system based on clear rules that would permit all \r\ncountries to benefit from the potential provided by \r\ninternational trade as the engine of development. \r\nA/65/PV.23  \r\n \r\n10-55396 8 \r\n \r\nHunger eradication, food production and agricultural \r\ntrade are closely related and must be strengthened \r\nthrough a predictable multilateral system that provides \r\nguarantees to producers and ensures food availability \r\nto the most vulnerable sectors. In that context, the \r\nelimination of subsidies and other non-tariff barriers \r\nthat hinder access to markets is essential, as is a \r\nsuccessful conclusion of the Doha Round based on a \r\ndevelopment perspective. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I give the floor \r\nto His Excellency Mr. Jean-Marie Kacou Gervais, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and African Integration of \r\nCôte d’Ivoire. \r\n Mr. Kacou Gervais (Côte d’Ivoire) (spoke in \r\nFrench): I would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your \r\nbrilliant election to the presidency of the sixty-fifth \r\nsession of the General Assembly. That election is a sign \r\nof the unanimous recognition of your personal \r\ncommitment to promote the role of this Organization \r\nand to defend its ideals. It is also the crowning moment \r\nin a talented diplomatic career that you have led with \r\nskill and tact. It is therefore to you as a skilled \r\ndiplomat that I would like to pay warm homage.  \r\n It is also my pleasure to express to your \r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, \r\nmy delegation’s appreciation for the quality of the \r\nwork he undertook and the results achieved under his \r\npresidency. Finally, allow me to pay tribute to the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his personal \r\ncommitment and tireless efforts to support peace and \r\ndevelopment throughout the world. Furthermore, I \r\nwish to convey my deep gratitude to him as well as the \r\ngratitude of His Excellency Mr. Laurent Gbagbo, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire, as well as \r\nthat of the people and Government of Côte d’Ivoire for \r\nhis commitment to reach a settlement of the crisis in \r\nCôte d’Ivoire.  \r\n By proposing the theme of reaffirming the United \r\nNations central role in global governance for this \r\nsession, Mr. President, you celebrate the primacy of \r\nmultilateralism over unilateralism as a method for \r\nmanaging global affairs in the best possible manner. \r\nMoreover, you are transforming our Organization into \r\nthe forum of choice for dealing with issues of global \r\nconcern. That vision is, without any doubt, in line with \r\nthat of developing countries in general and my country, \r\nCôte d’Ivoire, in particular and can only take shape if \r\nthe United Nations retains its credibility by adapting to \r\nan international context that has considerably changed \r\nsince its founding in 1945. This requires urgent and \r\nthorough reform, because we believe that our \r\nOrganization has resisted the widespread changes in \r\nthe world that it was established to serve.  \r\n Because the United Nations is at the crossroads \r\nof all of the world’s problems, it is here that we can \r\nfully assess what has happened since it was founded. \r\nThis is the appropriate place to assess the progress \r\nachieved as well as the failings. It is also here that we \r\ncan envisage solutions to problems that now confront \r\nthe world. Those issues include poverty, which is the \r\nsource of all evils, and which remains an open wound \r\non humanity, which continues to make progress to the \r\npoint where it is already considering human \r\nsettlements on the moon. But unfortunately, at the same \r\ntime, humanity is forgetting that more than a billion \r\nmen and women across the planet Earth suffer from \r\nhunger. Women’s lives are lost as they give life. \r\nMillions of children die before reaching the age of 5, \r\nand access to drinking water is limited in Africa. The \r\nAIDS epidemic and the malaria epidemic kill more \r\npeople than all the wars combined. If the world is \r\npowerless, the United Nations must be adapted to \r\nprovide proper responses to those imbalances, because \r\nthere are not two worlds, there is just one world, which \r\nis our common heritage. Managing that world must be \r\ndone in a joint manner, and it must be shared equitably. \r\nThe United Nations must demonstrate the example and \r\nshow the path forward. \r\n In that regard, my country’s position has \r\nremained unchanged. For Côte d’Ivoire, that long-\r\nsought reform must aim for balance in the main bodies \r\nof the United Nations, including in particular a larger \r\nSecurity Council and improvement in its working \r\nmethods. That is why my delegation places much hope \r\nin the successful outcome of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations that were launched by the General \r\nAssembly on reform of the Organization in general and \r\nthe Security Council in particular. \r\n This session of the Assembly is taking place at a \r\nmoment when the global economy is beginning a \r\nfragile recovery, following the most serious economic \r\ncrisis the world has faced since the Great Depression of \r\nthe 1930s. That crisis has shown, and indeed has \r\nexacerbated, the vulnerability of integrated world \r\neconomies, ruined development efforts and threatened \r\ncollective security. Many countries, mainly developing \r\ncountries, are continuing to suffer the effects of the \r\n A/65/PV.23\r\n \r\n9 10-55396 \r\n \r\ncrisis through a drop in the purchasing power of their \r\npeople, the growing shortage of official development \r\nassistance, falling foreign direct investment and growth \r\nin unemployment.  \r\n If, as the experts tell us, the global economy has \r\nbegun to recover this year, it nevertheless continues to \r\nbe fragile, with a growth rate of a mere 2.2 per cent. In \r\nsuch a situation, we must seek, in solidarity and by \r\ncombining our efforts, the most appropriate solutions \r\nto consolidate that tendency to growth. Meeting that \r\nfundamental requirement will allow us to establish \r\nthroughout the world societies that are safer, more \r\nequitable, more inclusive and more stable.  \r\n My delegation therefore calls on the \r\nindustrialized countries to make a reality of their \r\ncommitments with regard to developing countries, \r\nespecially in terms of official development assistance, \r\nif the developing countries are to reach the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) by 2015. \r\n Côte d’Ivoire also hopes to see the diligent \r\nimplementation of the conclusions of the United \r\nNations Conference on the World Financial and \r\nEconomic Crisis and Its Impact on Development, \r\nwhich was held here from 24 to 26 June 2009, \r\nparticularly those calling for reform and strengthening \r\nof the financial and economic system and of the \r\ninternational financial architecture in order to adapt \r\nthem to current difficulties.  It also desires that \r\nthat reform should not only allow developing countries \r\nin general and those of Africa in particular to have \r\nmore adequate representation in international financial \r\ninstitutions, but should also promote economic and \r\nfinancial policies that are better adapted to their needs.  \r\n Along those lines, I would like to pay tribute to \r\nthe summit of the Group of Eight (G-8) held in June \r\n2010 in Muskoka, Canada, which reaffirmed, inter alia, \r\nthe commitments of the G-8 with regard to official \r\ndevelopment assistance and the guarantee of aid \r\neffectiveness. It called for the effective mobilization of \r\nall public and private resources for the achievement of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. It also \r\nemphasized the urgent need for collective action to \r\nachieve the MDGs, particularly improvement in \r\nmaternal health and reduction of infant mortality.  \r\n On that specific point, my delegation would like \r\nto welcome the creation within the United Nations \r\nsystem of UN Women, a special body responsible for \r\ngender issues and the advancement of women. That \r\nnew body and the establishment of a trust fund to \r\nsupport initiatives for women is a real cause for hope \r\nfor developing countries, particularly those in Africa, \r\nin their struggle against poverty, discrimination and \r\nsocial inequalities.  In that connection, I wish to \r\nwarmly congratulate Ms. Michelle Bachelet on her \r\nappointment to head UN Women and assure her of the \r\nfull cooperation of the authorities of Côte d’Ivoire in \r\nfulfilling her mandate. \r\n Food insecurity, which now affects more than  \r\n1 billion people, mainly in developing countries, is a \r\nmajor and immediate obstacle to development and a \r\nthreat to world peace and security.  \r\n In the face of that situation, for which the entire \r\ninternational community is responsible, we need to \r\nfind innovative, effective and lasting solutions in terms \r\nof financing for agriculture. My delegation welcomes \r\nthe efforts being made by the World Bank, regional \r\ndevelopment banks and the specialized funds and \r\nagencies of the United Nations for financing the \r\nagricultural sector. Similarly, it welcomes the launching \r\nin 2009 of the L’Aquila Food Security Initiative, which \r\nallowed the G-8 to mobilize $22 billion to finance \r\nagriculture in developing countries over a period of \r\nthree years. \r\n The delegation of Côte d’Ivoire welcomes, \r\nfinally, the reform under way of the Committee on \r\nWorld Food Security and the launching of the Global \r\nAgriculture and Food Security Programme.  \r\n Similarly, I would like to recall the proposals \r\nmade by President Laurent Gbagbo, at the meeting of \r\nthe Group of 77 and China that was held in June 2008 \r\nat Yamoussoukro, to set up a mutual support \r\nmechanism for providing food products to importing \r\ncountries by producing countries while aiming to \r\ncreate in the United Nations a stabilization fund for \r\nfood products. \r\n Climate change is rightly seen as a global \r\nproblem and today represents a serious threat to \r\nhumankind’s equilibrium. It therefore requires clear \r\nand committed responses at the international level. \r\nThus it is important that we rapidly find solutions that \r\ncan ensure that future generations will have a world \r\nthat is better balanced and guarantees a better future \r\nfor humankind. \r\n In that regard, the delegation of Côte d’Ivoire \r\nwelcomes the significant progress of the United \r\nA/65/PV.23  \r\n \r\n10-55396 10 \r\n \r\nNations Conference on Climate Change, held from 7 to \r\n18 December 2009 in Copenhagen. Although the \r\nprinciple of a legally binding accord to succeed the \r\nKyoto Protocol after 2012 was not reached, the hopes \r\npromoted by that meeting largely justified its being \r\nheld. Moreover, the significant progress achieved \r\nconfirms us in that opinion. \r\n Among the advances made we would mention, \r\ninter alia, the consensus on the goals for stabilizing the \r\ntemperature rise at 2°C, the creation of a mechanism to \r\nmobilize financial resources for the absorption of \r\ngreenhouse gas emissions by forests, and the \r\ncommitment of developed countries to provide  \r\n$30 billion for the period 2010 to 2012, and $100 \r\nbillion as of 2020 for measures to adapt to climate \r\nchange in developing countries.  \r\n The diligent implementation of those measures \r\nshould allow vulnerable States such as my own to \r\nestablish plans to combat climate change, which is \r\nbecoming increasingly evident throughout the world in \r\nan upsurge in natural disasters related to drought, \r\nflooding and coastal erosion. The effects of all of those \r\nevents on the health of populations and on the \r\navailability of land and potable water compromise the \r\neconomic and social development of many States that \r\nhave already been weakened by poverty and \r\npandemics. The United Nations, in line with its \r\nCharter, has the duty to carry out the negotiations that \r\nwere begun in Copenhagen and must work resolutely to \r\nthat end. \r\n Respect for human rights is a concern for my \r\ncountry, which has endorsed the set of international \r\ninstruments in that regard. Though it was affected by \r\nthe socio-political crisis, the human rights situation in \r\nmy country is today on a path to normalization, thanks \r\nespecially to the valuable help of national and \r\ninternational non-governmental organizations involved \r\nin that area. The international community could see \r\nthat on 3 December 2009 in Geneva, when the Working \r\nGroup on the universal periodic review took up Côte \r\nd’Ivoire. That review led to the adoption on 18 March \r\n2010 of a final report that earned my country the \r\nsupport and encouragement of the States members of \r\nthe Human Rights Council for our stated will to pursue \r\nefforts to improve human rights. \r\n The persistence of numerous armed conflicts \r\naround the world continues to threaten international \r\npeace and security. Once again, the role of the United \r\nNations is vital to resolving those conflicts, which are \r\nhindering the harmonious development of the world. \r\nThat is particularly true in Africa, a region that, shaken \r\nby hotbeds of tension, cannot ensure its peaceful \r\neconomic and social development, despite its enormous \r\npotential.  \r\n In that regard, allow me to stress how happy we \r\nare that the peace so much hoped for is now a reality in \r\nCôte d’Ivoire, following the implementation of the \r\nOuagadougou Political Agreement, which will permit \r\nthe organization of free, transparent and open elections. \r\nThe first round of presidential elections has been set \r\nfor 31 October 2010. Besides setting that date, the \r\nsigning on 9 September 2010 of a presidential decree \r\nfinalizing the ballot list allows for the distribution of \r\nnational identity and voting cards to the 5,725,720 \r\nIvorians who are on the list that has been validated by \r\nthe Independent Electoral Commission and the Special \r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General of the United \r\nNations.  \r\n Those signs of progress in the peace process and \r\nthe proven determination of political players and the \r\nIvorian people to move towards free, open and \r\ntransparent elections allow us to envisage, with \r\noptimism, the holding of the presidential election on \r\nthe appointed date and thus of Côte d’Ivoire emerging \r\nfrom its crisis. \r\n On that hopeful note, I would like to conclude by \r\nrecalling that the various crises of security, food, \r\nenergy and finances, compounded by the threat of \r\nclimate change, demonstrate the extent to which in the \r\nexistence, balance and future development of humanity \r\nare now threatened more than ever. In that context the \r\nUnited Nations has a crucial role to play in \r\nstrengthening indispensable international solidarity and \r\nin seeking effective, collective and appropriate \r\nsolutions to those crises and challenges.  \r\n However, to be fully engaged with its time and to \r\nremain true to the objectives of its founding 65 years \r\nago, the United Nations must adapt to the realities of \r\nthe contemporary world if it wants to remain the \r\nguarantor of international peace and security and of the \r\nworld’s socio-economic development. To that end, we \r\nmust strengthen the foundations of this Organization \r\nand — as the theme of this session invites us to do — \r\nreaffirm its central role in global governance. Côte \r\nd’Ivoire therefore calls for international solidarity so \r\nthat our common Organization may find the necessary \r\n A/65/PV.23\r\n \r\n11 10-55396 \r\n \r\nsolutions to offer to coming generations the hope of a \r\nfruitful and peaceful future. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Seyoum Mesfin, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Federal Democratic Republic \r\nof Ethiopia. \r\n Mr. Mesfin (Ethiopia): Allow me, Sir, at the \r\noutset, to extend to you my delegation’s warm \r\ncongratulations on your election to the presidency of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. I would \r\nlike to assure you of my delegation’s full cooperation \r\nin the discharge of your high responsibilities. My \r\ndelegation would like to register our appreciation to the \r\noutgoing President, Mr. Ali Treki, for his able \r\nleadership during the sixty-fourth session. We would \r\nalso like to take this opportunity to express our \r\nappreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, for \r\nhis tireless efforts to ensure that the Organization lives \r\nup to the purposes and principles set out in its Charter.  \r\n Allow me to begin my statement today by \r\nreviewing some salient aspects of the political and \r\neconomic transformation in Ethiopia.  \r\n Such a review should of necessity begin with the \r\ndemocratization process in Ethiopia, which is now \r\nalmost completing its second decade. In the political \r\ntransformation in Ethiopia over the past two decades, \r\nour single-minded focus has been on building \r\ninstitutions of democracy, good governance and the \r\nrule of law. The essence of all our endeavours in that \r\nregard has been the devolution of power to the people. \r\nOur federal democratic order, built on the basis of \r\nunity in diversity, has laid the foundation for lasting \r\npeace and security. The democratization process that \r\nEthiopia has embarked on is irreversible and is taking \r\ndeep root at the level of the State and the society at \r\nlarge. \r\n Still, a democratization process in any country is \r\nnot an end in itself. The whole purpose is to create an \r\nenvironment conducive to bringing about a better life \r\nfor the people. That inevitably leads me to our \r\neconomic policy and strategy. Today in our country \r\naccelerated development is in full swing, while a \r\ndemocratic culture and its institutional underpinnings \r\nare developing at the grass-roots level.  \r\n The successful results achieved during the last \r\nseven years and the challenges and experience gained \r\nin the process of implementing the previous five-year \r\neconomic plan have helped in the formulation of the \r\nnext five-year plan — officially called the Growth and \r\nTransformation Plan — covering the period of 2011 to \r\n2015. The objective of that plan is to lay the necessary \r\nbasis for nation-building by creating and strengthening \r\na stable, democratic, developmental State and to \r\nachieve the economic and social goals in the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs).  \r\n At the end of the five-year period the net result of \r\nall our efforts will be that poverty in our country has \r\nbeen made history. We are confident that by that time \r\nour people will celebrate, together with the \r\ninternational community, the end of an era of food \r\ninsecurity and dependency on food aid. That historic \r\nevent will give us an opportunity to extend our deep \r\ngratitude to all our partners for their assistance in our \r\ndifficult times. We pledge to redouble our efforts and \r\nutilize their assistance for rapid development of our \r\ncountry that will extricate us from food insecurity once \r\nand for all. \r\n As regards the Millennium Development Goals, \r\nthe High-level Plenary Meeting of the sixty-fifth \r\nsession of the General Assembly, held here in New \r\nYork just last week, was timely. The outcome \r\ndocument of that forum (resolution 65/1) should not be \r\njust an appeal but a new pact, binding on stakeholders \r\nwith respect to renewed commitment to ensure that the \r\ncollective promises made at the dawn of the new \r\nmillennium are kept. The action agenda designed to \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 \r\nmust ensure the mutual responsibility and \r\naccountability of all stakeholders.  \r\n We in Ethiopia have made substantial progress on \r\nall fronts towards achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. We have taken full charge of our \r\ndestiny, devised our own strategy and maximized the \r\nmobilization of our domestic resources to achieve the \r\nMDGs. The results so far have been very encouraging. \r\nOver the past seven years, the Ethiopian economy has \r\nperformed well, having achieved an annual average \r\ngrowth rate of 11.6 per cent. The robust economic \r\ngrowth we have achieved has created the basis for \r\nsimilarly robust growth in social indicators, and hence \r\non progress in achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. \r\n Assessing the state of the MDGs today would not \r\nbe complete without some reflections on Africa from \r\nthe perspective of economic and social development \r\nA/65/PV.23  \r\n \r\n10-55396 12 \r\n \r\nand its organic link to the MDGs. In that connection, I \r\ncan do no better than to refer to what Mr. Zoellick, \r\nPresident of the World Bank, said at the High-level \r\nPlenary Meeting on the MDGs (see A/65/PV.3). The \r\nmost important point he made was that he believed in \r\nAfrica and that Africa can be a global pole of growth \r\nand attract investment on African terms. That is what \r\nwe have been saying all along. He also said that one \r\nneeds to work with developing countries as clients, not \r\nas development models from textbooks, and to help \r\nthem to solve problems, not to test theories. We in \r\nAfrica know what we can do; we want to know what \r\nthe rest of the world will do to help us achieve our \r\ngoals. \r\n The issue of climate change remains among the \r\nmost critical challenges facing humankind today. Much \r\nhas been said, from Rio to Kyoto to Copenhagen. What \r\nhas been promised has thus far resulted in far less than \r\nthe urgency of the matter merits. We believe that time \r\nis running out, and we are concerned that national \r\nagendas of zero-sum preferences are overshadowing \r\nthe real urgency of addressing the matter in an \r\naccelerated and coordinated manner. The upcoming \r\nCancún meeting on climate change should be different \r\nfrom its predecessors. It should come up with a legally \r\nbinding commitment, coupled with the political will, to \r\nallocate the necessary resources for adaptation and \r\nmitigation efforts, especially for the most vulnerable \r\nand exposed countries. \r\n On energy and development, it has always been \r\nself-evident that access to energy is key to fighting \r\npoverty. It is central to development. Yet, 1.4 billion \r\npeople worldwide are without electricity, 80 per cent of \r\nwhom live in rural areas. Given the urgency of this dire \r\nsituation, we fully support the goal of universal energy \r\naccess by 2030, as set by the United Nations. \r\n As the prevalence of conflicts around the world \r\nclearly indicates, international cooperation is of \r\nparamount importance to complement the efforts of the \r\nUnited Nations in the area of peace and security. In \r\nthat regard, Ethiopia, as a founding Member of the \r\nUnited Nations, has always been at the forefront in \r\ndischarging its responsibilities in the area of peace and \r\nsecurity. Since the early 1950s, Ethiopia has been an \r\nactive participant in United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations. At the moment, Ethiopia is among the \r\nmajor troop-contributing countries to United Nations \r\npeacekeeping missions. \r\n Among the challenges that the international \r\ncommunity faces in the area of peace and security is \r\nthe scourge of terrorism. Like many other countries, we \r\nhave been at the receiving end of this problem. We \r\nbelieve that unreserved international cooperation is the \r\nonly viable way to combat terrorism. Ethiopia will \r\ncontinue to do its level best in that regard. \r\n Any discussion of peace and security on the \r\ninternational scene today will inevitably have to take \r\nup the situation in the Horn of Africa. It is regrettable \r\nthat we still cannot talk about the situation in Somalia \r\nwith a great deal of optimism. On one hand, the threat \r\nof extremism continues unabated in Somalia, as does \r\nthe danger posed by international terrorist networks \r\nand their sponsors to Somalia, and beyond. On the \r\nother hand, it is clear that there is little chance for \r\nmaking progress in Somalia until there is harmony and \r\ngreater seriousness of purpose at the highest level \r\nwithin the Transitional Federal Institutions of Somalia. \r\n The Council of Ministers of the \r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), \r\nwhich met here in New York on 22 September \r\npreceding the mini-summit on Somalia convened by \r\nthe Secretary-General on 23 September, expressed its \r\nregret with regard to differences within the leadership \r\nof the Transitional Federal Government. It called upon \r\nthem to strengthen their cohesion and work together to \r\naddress the multiple challenges facing the country. \r\nFurthermore, the Council of Ministers reaffirmed the \r\nDjibouti process as the sole basis for peace and \r\nreconciliation in Somalia, expressed concern about the \r\nproliferation of initiatives and urged the United \r\nNations and other stakeholders to engage within the \r\nregion and with IGAD. \r\n With regard to the situation in the Sudan, \r\nEthiopia is of the firm view that conceivably there is \r\nno other conflict on the continent today comparable to \r\nthat of the Sudan. Hence, we believe that success in the \r\nSudan will mean significant success for Africa as a \r\nwhole. By the same token, failure may entail a serious \r\ncatastrophe for Africa. That is why the African Union \r\nhas given its unreserved attention to the issue, as \r\nillustrated by the effort of the High-Level \r\nImplementation Panel led by former President Thabo \r\nMbeki. We would like to express our appreciation to \r\nthe Secretary-General for holding a timely high-level \r\nmeeting on the Sudan here on 24 September. The \r\noutcome of the meeting has been encouraging. \r\n A/65/PV.23\r\n \r\n13 10-55396 \r\n \r\n It goes without saying that the referendums in \r\nSouthern Sudan and Abyei should be held on time and \r\nstrictly in conformity with the terms of the \r\nComprehensive Peace Agreement. However, we \r\nbelieve that, irrespective of the outcome of the \r\nreferendums and without in any way detracting from \r\nthe historic significance of that date, the parties should \r\nnot fix their minds solely on 9 January 2011. The \r\nparties ought to recognize that here are several \r\ncommonalities, interests, bonds and values between the \r\npeoples of the Sudan, north and south, that transcend \r\nthe decision to be taken in January 2011. That is why it \r\nis of paramount importance that negotiations on post-\r\nreferendum issues should be conducted in earnest and \r\nwith the seriousness of purpose that the issues deserve. \r\n When we talk of security in the Horn of Africa \r\nregion and the southern Red Sea, we cannot avoid \r\nraising our concern once again about the destructive \r\nrole that the Government of Eritrea has continued to \r\nplay since independence. We in the IGAD region have \r\ntime and time again warned the United Nations, as well \r\nas the international community, that the Eritrean \r\nregime is the principal destabilizer in our subregion, \r\nwith its utter contempt for international law and the \r\nnorms of international behaviour.  \r\n It is indeed regrettable that the Security Council \r\nis not taking the necessary steps to compel Eritrea to \r\nlive up to what is expected of it under Council \r\nresolution 1907 (2009). Despite the sanctions, Eritrea \r\nis still the principal architect of the complicated \r\nsituation in Somalia, through its training, arming and \r\nnurturing of extremist elements such as Al-Shabaab \r\nand Hizb al-Islam, who are causing havoc in that \r\ncountry today.  \r\n That reprehensible conduct on the part of the \r\nregime has been by no means isolated or confined to \r\nour subregion. On the contrary, it has been standard \r\nbehaviour for the Eritrean regime, extending far \r\nbeyond the subregion, to other parts of the continent \r\nand sometimes even outside it. \r\n Consistent with its innate character, the regime \r\ncommitted acts of aggression against practically all its \r\nneighbours in the space of only a few years after its \r\nindependence. That is unprecedented for any newly \r\nindependent State, giving Eritrea the dubious \r\ndistinction of being an international pariah in the \r\nfamily of nations. Therefore, if we are to achieve a \r\nbreakthrough in Somalia, the time is long overdue for \r\nthe Security Council to take resolute action and see to \r\nit that its decisions are complied with. \r\n \r\n Since its founding more than six decades ago, the \r\nUnited Nations, as the principal global player on the \r\ninternational scene with multifarious responsibilities, \r\nhas, under the circumstances, lived up to the vision set \r\nfor it in the Charter. There is no gainsaying the fact \r\nthat if the United Nations did not exist, we would have \r\nhad to create it. It is an indispensable Organization, \r\nparticularly for us in the developing world. However, \r\nwhile underscoring its importance, we should not lose \r\nsight of the need for its reform, which is an ongoing \r\nprocess. That is how we can ensure the Organization’s \r\nviability. Ethiopia will always be ready to give \r\nwhatever support is necessary to that end.  \r\n When we talk of the United Nations as a global \r\nactor, the importance of cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and our continental organization, the \r\nAfrican Union, need hardly be emphasized. Of \r\nparticular significance is the ongoing cooperation and \r\nconsultation between the United Nations Security \r\nCouncil and the African Union Peace and Security \r\nCouncil, in line with the provisions of Chapter VIII of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. We should continue \r\nthat cooperation, and Ethiopia will do whatever is \r\nnecessary in that regard. \r\n In conclusion, let me reiterate, as a founding \r\nMember, Ethiopia’s enduring commitment to the ideals \r\nof our Organization and the fulfilment of its objectives, \r\nas set out in the Charter, which remains a living \r\ndocument and a source of inspiration for the \r\ninternational community. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Héctor Lacognata, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Paraguay. \r\n Mr. Lacognata (Paraguay) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nMr. President, let me first convey on my own behalf \r\nand on behalf of the Republic of Paraguay our wishes \r\nfor every success in your sensitive and important \r\nfunction at the helm of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-fifth session. I would also like to express my \r\ndelegation’s recognition of Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, \r\nPresident of the Assembly at the sixty-fourth session, \r\nfor the significant achievements made. \r\n Paraguayan democracy has completed its \r\ntransition, begun 21 years ago, with the transfer of \r\nA/65/PV.23  \r\n \r\n10-55396 14 \r\n \r\npower from one political force to another in recent \r\nelections held under international observation. In that \r\nway we have consolidated a process of strengthening \r\npublic freedoms, thereby affirming that those freedoms \r\nare fully guaranteed in my country today. \r\n Paraguay comes to this general debate \r\nreaffirming its importance and calling for progress in \r\nstrengthening the United Nations as the body capable \r\nof representing the interests of all Member States in the \r\nurgent quest for a fairer, more united and equitable \r\nworld, guaranteed by the full force of international law.  \r\n We are very pleased that some great Powers have \r\nreturned to the path of multilateralism, for some of the \r\nproblems that afflict mankind can be resolved only \r\nwith the involvement of every State. It has been \r\ndemonstrated again that in the search for a better \r\ncivilization, the solution has not, cannot and will never \r\nbe found by a handful of nations. Thus the recent \r\nfinancial crisis can be resolved satisfactorily only \r\nthrough measures that are universal and taken with the \r\nagreement of the great majority. Once again, it is the \r\nGeneral Assembly that will have to make its guiding \r\nvoice heard on this issue. \r\n We also applaud the Secretary-General’s timely \r\ndecision to hold the High-level Meeting for review of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The \r\nRepublic of Paraguay believes that while achievements \r\nhave been made with regard to the MDGs, we cannot \r\navoid the fact that there are still inequalities all over \r\nthe world and millions continue to live in abject \r\npoverty. The situation has been exacerbated by sudden \r\nincreases in food prices and the consequences of \r\nclimate change. \r\n In Paraguay we are betting on the globalization of \r\ndemocracy with social development. We are betting on \r\nthe universalization of security based on respect for \r\nhuman rights as an unwavering commitment and on \r\ndignifying human life. In that spirit we celebrate the \r\nrecent designation of a Paraguayan citizen as a member \r\nof the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of \r\nDiscrimination against Women. We appreciate the \r\nsupport she received, which further strengthens our \r\ncommitment to ensuring the inclusion of women in all \r\nareas of public life.  \r\n We would thus like to create a regional \r\ncommunity in the context of a global union that in \r\nsolidarity and together devotes its efforts to eradicating \r\nhunger and abject poverty, cooperating effectively to \r\npromote the participation of all in building sustainable \r\nprosperity through quality education and the provision \r\nof a social protection system that excludes no one. \r\n The Republic of Paraguay reiterates its \r\ncommitment to prioritize the implementation of \r\nprogrammes for economic development with social \r\njustice. The national Government is approaching with \r\ndedication the development and implementation of \r\nsocial policies to address needs in this area, with \r\nspecial emphasis on the most vulnerable and most \r\nneedy of our population. That effort at the national \r\nlevel also requires international solidarity, enhanced \r\nthrough the processes of regional and sovereign \r\nintegration of the people, as well as through a new \r\ninternational financial architecture whose institutions \r\ncontribute to job creation and to fairer, more equitable \r\ntrade conditions among the world’s nations. \r\n We note with great concern that many citizens of \r\nour countries have had to migrate to other parts of the \r\nworld, particularly Europe and North America, in \r\nsearch of new opportunities for happiness and personal \r\nfulfilment. We take this occasion to show our solidarity \r\nwith the peoples who at this moment are suffering from \r\nthe consequences of mistaken discriminatory and \r\nviolent immigration policies, particularly as applied by \r\ncountries of the so-called first world.  \r\n Migration policy is not a domestic issue but \r\nrather a question that must respect international human \r\nrights norms and standards. Therefore we call on all \r\ncountries that receive migrants to deal in a spirit of \r\nhumanitarianism, fraternity and hospitality with all our \r\nfellow citizens who today seek to share in the right to \r\nwork and to a life of dignity far from their respective \r\ncountries. We propose a deepening of dialogue on the \r\nissue in international forums to highlight the human \r\ndimension of migration processes and find a just and \r\nequitable solution to that reality of globalization. \r\n Full employment and decent work are universal \r\ngoals, and to reach them requires focusing national \r\nefforts and improving international cooperation to \r\naddress macroeconomic and trade issues involved in \r\nthe solution to that problem. Bilateral and multilateral \r\ninstitutions for development assistance should insist on \r\nemployment taking a place of prominence in their \r\npolicy decisions and implementation.  \r\n Disarmament, non-proliferation and arms control \r\nare not only essential factors to ensure international \r\npeace and security, but they also guarantee sustainable \r\n A/65/PV.23\r\n \r\n15 10-55396 \r\n \r\neconomic and social development for the most \r\nvulnerable countries. Only through a sound multilateral \r\nsystem with strict adherence to international law and \r\nrespect for the sovereignty and self-determination of \r\npeoples can we guarantee our mutual security.  \r\n In that vein, we condemn coercive economic \r\nmeasures that prevent countries from exercising their \r\nsovereign right to choose their own political, economic \r\nand social systems. We reject the unilateral application \r\nof measures against the Republic of Cuba, and we \r\nreiterate our support for the General Assembly \r\nresolutions to put an end to the economic, commercial \r\nand financial blockade against that nation. The \r\nblockade against Cuba undermines the fundamental \r\nnorms of international law, the principles of sovereign \r\nequality among States, non-intervention,  \r\nnon-interference in domestic affairs, freedom of trade \r\nand international navigation and the self-determination \r\nof peoples, as enshrined in instruments of international \r\nlaw.  \r\n We also demand that the Government of the \r\nUnited States adopt necessary measures to put an end \r\nto the irregular situation of five Cuban citizens who are \r\ncurrently deprived of their liberty as they sit in United \r\nStates jails and who have denounced the violation of \r\ntheir human rights. \r\n The Republic of Paraguay reiterates its \r\ncommitment to international peace and security. In that \r\ncontext we reaffirm our political will to increase our \r\ncontribution to peacekeeping missions and to continue \r\nour efforts to train and equip forces in accordance with \r\nthe standards of this Organization, so as to \r\nprogressively increase our participation in those \r\noperations. \r\n My country is aware of the serious and complex \r\nthreats of climate change around the world. We have \r\nwatched with concern the growing negative effects of \r\nirregular climate phenomena that produce drastic \r\nconsequences that contribute to increased poverty and \r\ndisplacement of persons, among other irreparable \r\neffects that must be urgently and uncompromisingly \r\naddressed. We subscribe to the Declaration of the \r\nCochabamba summit on climate change and call for an \r\nurgent, coordinated and responsible global response to \r\nfind ways to mitigate, lessen and reverse the tragic, \r\ndevastating consequences of climate change. Likewise, \r\nwe proclaim the sovereign rights of peoples over their \r\nnatural resources, interpreted in the broadest sense.  \r\n A new international financial architecture is \r\nneeded, one that seeks a system of fair trade and \r\nefficient regulation mechanisms. We also need new \r\nparadigms for integration that attack the root causes of \r\nobstacles to integration, such as inequitable exchange \r\nrates and the unequal conditions of international \r\nrelations, the weight of unpayable debt and the \r\nimposition of structural changes that undermine the \r\nbases of social and political assistance. We are \r\nconvinced that the United Nations, as a global \r\ninstitution, should play a central role to guarantee the \r\nsuccess of our efforts to achieve better international \r\ncoordination and coherence in the economic and \r\nfinancial spheres.  \r\n The issue of landlocked developing countries is \r\nfundamental to Paraguay’s foreign policy. The \r\nasymmetries and disadvantages created by and still \r\nbeing created by that geographical situation can be \r\noffset only to the extent that they are internationally \r\nrecognized and that there be special, individualized \r\ntreatment for such countries on the part of developed \r\neconomies on their integration into the globalized \r\nworld.  \r\n It is essential that the United Nations implement \r\nthe needed reforms with the goal of adapting its \r\nstructure to the current needs of global society. With \r\nthat desire for evolution, the Republic of Paraguay \r\nsupports the process of reform of the Organization so \r\nas to strengthen the General Assembly and recover the \r\nfunctions conferred on it by the Charter, as the most \r\nrepresentative organ of the Organization.  \r\n Paraguay has also been watching with great \r\ninterest the recent rounds of intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations about equitable representation on and \r\nincreasing the membership of the Security Council and \r\nother related issues. We advocate full adherence to \r\nmultilateralism, the sovereign equality of States and \r\ninviolable respect for the rule of law. Accordingly, we \r\nneed a Security Council that is more democratic, and \r\nthus its expansion cannot be put off in order to make it \r\nmore equitable and inclusive. \r\n As a contribution from Paraguay to promoting \r\nrespect and fraternity — values that strengthen any \r\norganization made up of individuals and nations — we \r\nhave proposed to share with the world our tradition of \r\ncelebrating friendship. To that end, Paraguay has \r\npresented to the United Nations a proposal to proclaim \r\nA/65/PV.23  \r\n \r\n10-55396 16 \r\n \r\n30 July as World Friendship Day, in order to renew \r\nappreciation and recognition among our peoples.  \r\n Sixty-five years ago we said, “We the peoples of \r\nthe United Nations”, and Paraguay was among them. \r\nHence we reaffirm each and every precept enshrined in \r\nthe remarkable Preamble to our Charter. We will be at \r\nthe side of all, because we believe in the equality of \r\nnations large and small, which will allow us \r\nprogressively to improve the conditions under which \r\njustice can be maintained and thereby better the \r\nstandards of life in larger freedom. That is our \r\nmandate. We are committed to fulfil it.  \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Kasit Piromya, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Kingdom of Thailand. \r\n Mr. Piromya (Thailand): Please allow me, Sir, to \r\nextend to you, on behalf of the delegation of the \r\nKingdom of Thailand, our wholehearted congratulations \r\non your election to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-fifth session. You can rest assured \r\nof my delegation’s full support and cooperation. \r\n We live in a world of divides. Although the \r\npredominantly ideological divide of the Cold War has \r\nended, new divides have come to the fore — politico-\r\nsecurity, socio-economic, digital or even based on \r\nbeliefs. Such divides present challenges to peace, \r\nsecurity, prosperity and human dignity. Overcoming \r\nthem requires that nations work together as one; \r\novercoming them requires a United Nations. \r\n But the effectiveness of such international \r\ncooperation depends upon the strength and willingness \r\nof individual nations themselves. Thailand is such a \r\nnation, willing and ready to cooperate with \r\ninternational partners to help bridge such divides and \r\nhelp the world cross into a better future. \r\n Of course, we are under no illusions about \r\nThailand’s own difficulties and our own current \r\ndivides. But history has shown that Thailand is a \r\nresilient country, and its people are capable of \r\novercoming whatever challenges are thrown before \r\nthem. Thailand remains a functioning democracy, but \r\nwe are a relatively young one. Like many other \r\ndemocracies, ours will develop and mature with time. \r\nThe Thai Government is committed to that and to the \r\nprinciples of democracy, the practice of good \r\ngovernance and respect for human rights. \r\n Have no doubt that our Government is resolutely \r\nworking to heal the political and social divisions in my \r\ncountry. We are working to address any legitimate \r\nsocio-economic grievances, with a view to bringing \r\nback national unity and confidence. We have launched \r\na national reconciliation plan and set up independent \r\ncommittees, led by eminent persons with the utmost \r\nintegrity, to propose ways to reform the country and its \r\ndemocratic institutions. We will bridge our country’s \r\ndivide. \r\n Human rights remain the cornerstone of the \r\nGovernment’s policy. We are looking into any \r\nwrongdoings in the past and will ensure that they do \r\nnot recur and that justice is done. To that end, we have \r\nset up an independent fact-finding commission to look \r\ninto the tragic events earlier this year. Other \r\nindependent organs, such as our human rights \r\ncommission, also play a key and active role in \r\nsafeguarding human rights. \r\n The Thai Government well recognizes that some \r\npolitical grievances mainly arise from the economic \r\ndisparities in our society. That is a serious issue, and \r\nthe Government is working to bridge economic and \r\nsocial gaps. We are creating social safety nets through \r\nour universal health-care schemes and by providing 15 \r\nyears of free education, training programmes for the \r\nunemployed and support for low-income earners, \r\nfarmers, the elderly and people with disabilities. Our \r\nstimulus packages will benefit not only the overall \r\neconomy but especially those who are economically \r\nand socially disadvantaged and disenfranchised. \r\n Despite our troubles, the Thai economy remains \r\nrobust, as it and our exports continue to grow steadily. \r\nHowever, we are not complacent, as much remains to \r\nbe done. We need to better spread economic and social \r\nwell-being and vitality throughout Thailand, which will \r\nalso contribute to the reconciliation, trust and stability \r\nof the country. To that end, we seek to strengthen \r\nThailand’s creative economy by utilizing our rich \r\ncultural and historical heritage and the creativity of \r\nboth urban and rural Thais to add more value to Thai \r\nproducts and services, so that our productivity and \r\ncompetitiveness are enhanced and our wealth more \r\nwidely spread. \r\n I think we have proven to the world the strength \r\nof our national character and the resilience of our \r\nnation. Despite the tragic incidents, Thailand has \r\ncontinued to move forward, not merely for the benefit \r\n A/65/PV.23\r\n \r\n17 10-55396 \r\n \r\nof the country but also for that of the international \r\ncommunity. It is evident that we remain an active and \r\nresponsible Member of the United Nations, ready to \r\nenhance our present partnerships and build new ones to \r\nhelp create a better future for the world.  \r\n I will now expand upon how Thailand has \r\ncontributed, and can further contribute, internationally \r\nto help bridge the world’s divides. \r\n Many a conflict, whether inter- or intra-State, \r\nstems from development disparities and the suffering \r\ncaused by economic injustice. The world is divided, \r\nnot simply into have and have-not countries but, rather, \r\ninto have-more and have-less ones, and into North and \r\nSouth. Thailand therefore believes that in bridging the \r\ndevelopment gap, global economic growth should be \r\nbalanced and inclusive, regional economic cooperation \r\nand integration should be enhanced and the \r\ndisadvantaged and dispossessed should not be left \r\nbehind. \r\n The recent global financial crisis served as a \r\nvaluable wake-up call for all, reminding us to live \r\nwithin our means. Thailand believes that people-\r\ncentred development, moderation in economic \r\nbehaviour and the optimal use of limited resources — \r\nas stipulated in His Majesty the King of Thailand’s \r\n“sufficiency economy” philosophy — are essential if \r\nwe are to have sustainable economic development and \r\ngrowth. Thailand has embarked upon that path, and we \r\nurge others to follow. \r\n The financial crisis has also alerted us to the \r\nnecessity of better global governance and the need for \r\nreform of international financial institutions, with due \r\nconsideration for the interests of developing nations, as \r\nthey are the ones affected the most. Countries must \r\nwork more closely together to better coordinate fiscal \r\nand monetary policies and to improve the regulation of \r\nfinancial institutions. \r\n On our part, Thailand has engaged actively in \r\nregional and international forums such as the \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the \r\nASEAN+3 process, the Group of 20 (G-20) and the \r\nUnited Nations. As ASEAN Chair, Thailand was \r\ninvited to the G-20 Summits in London and Pittsburgh \r\nlast year to share ASEAN’s experiences and lessons \r\nlearned from the 1997 financial crisis.  \r\n Thailand believes that regional initiatives like the \r\nChiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization, the Asian \r\nBond Markets Initiative and the ASEAN Economic \r\nCommunity would all help to complement ongoing \r\nglobal cooperation to achieve balanced and sustainable \r\ngrowth, as well as to promote a resilient international \r\nfinancial system that also addresses the concerns of \r\ndeveloping countries. We believe that ASEAN, through \r\nthe ASEAN Chair, will continue to contribute to the \r\nforum its relevant experiences in achieving those goals. \r\n As a developing country itself, Thailand stands \r\nready to help others in need. We believe in greater \r\nSouth-South cooperation, for it is fellow developing \r\ncountries that best understand what is required to help \r\npush development forward. We are also active in \r\nbuilding partnerships between the developed and \r\ndeveloping world, providing a bridge between them \r\nthrough triangular cooperation by adapting technology \r\nfrom developed countries to match the needs of \r\ndeveloping ones. We have achieved most of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, and we stand ready to \r\nshare our knowledge and experience, especially in \r\nalleviating poverty and improving well-being in other \r\ncountries. \r\n We have already done so in our region by \r\ncooperating with our neighbours to improve social \r\nwelfare and build essential infrastructure. Through the \r\nThailand-initiated Master Plan on ASEAN \r\nConnectivity, the initiative for an ASEAN Integration \r\nStrategic Framework, the East-West Economic \r\nCorridor, the Greater Mekong subregion projects and \r\nbilateral cooperation, we have striven to promote \r\ngreater technical cooperation in the region and to \r\ncreate and upgrade transport and telecommunication \r\nnetworks to facilitate greater economic activity. Such \r\ninitiatives ultimately help narrow the developmental \r\ndivide within the region. \r\n Of the problems of development, food security \r\nranks as one of the most important. For people to live, \r\nmouths must be fed. As a major food exporter, \r\nThailand can contribute to ensuring greater food \r\nsecurity. We also believe in greater regional \r\ncooperation. The ASEAN Plus Three emergency rice \r\nreserve stands as a model for other regions to emulate. \r\n Climate change is undeniable. It is happening \r\nnow. We are all experiencing its effects, which have \r\nexacerbated the world’s woes, including food scarcity \r\nand natural disasters. Thailand is a developing country \r\nactively pursuing voluntary climate-change mitigation \r\nefforts. We plan to increase our forest area through \r\nA/65/PV.23  \r\n \r\n10-55396 18 \r\n \r\nreforestation and afforestation, as well as our \r\nrenewable energy usage. Indeed, our eleventh national \r\nsocial and economic development plan, for the years \r\n2012 to 2016, now being drafted, aims to move \r\nThailand towards becoming a low-carbon society. \r\n We are also aiming for green economic growth, \r\nwith energy used more efficiently and wisely. But the \r\ndeveloped world must also play its part in helping \r\nothers become better equipped to fight climate change. \r\nGreater technology transfer is thus a must. We \r\nsincerely hope that the sixteenth Conference of the \r\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change, to be held in Cancún, will lead to \r\nmore concrete and comprehensive results in our fight \r\nagainst climate change. \r\n Development is linked to human security, which \r\nis linked to human rights. People must have freedom \r\nfrom want as well as from fear. But while fundamental \r\nhuman rights are universal, how they are guaranteed \r\nand promoted differs from country to country in \r\naccordance with different belief systems and cultures. \r\nThailand believes that we should bridge such \r\ndifferences by working together towards a more \r\ncommon understanding of human rights and how they \r\nmust be protected. To this end, forums such as the \r\ninterfaith dialogues and the Alliance of Civilizations \r\nare invaluable contributions to greater common \r\nunderstanding. \r\n I stress again that human rights are a core \r\nprinciple of the Government of Thailand and its foreign \r\npolicy. Thailand’s election to the Human Rights \r\nCouncil for the years 2010 to 2013, and its election by \r\nacclamation to the presidency of the Council in June, is \r\nclear testament to the faith of the international \r\ncommunity in Thailand’s active and positive role in \r\npromoting and protecting human rights. As a member \r\nof the Human Rights Council, Thailand aims to \r\nreinvigorate the Council to address more effectively \r\nhuman rights problems worldwide. To this end, as \r\nPresident of the Council, we hope to see the review \r\nprocess through to completion by next year. We believe \r\nthe Council should adopt a more even-handed approach \r\nthrough greater cooperation and engagement with the \r\nconcerned countries themselves, to establish greater \r\ndialogue between States as well as regions and to try to \r\nforge consensus among them. \r\n Instead of offering mere criticism and the \r\nimposition of values seen as foreign, we must reach out \r\nto persuade the countries concerned to understand that \r\nhuman rights are shared values and common to all. \r\nOnly through true engagement can the Council have a \r\nreal impact on the betterment of people’s lives and \r\nultimately help pave the way towards peace. Only then \r\ncan we ensure that the rights of man do not again fall \r\nhostage to the wrongs of humankind. \r\n Thailand has striven for this regionally as well. \r\nUnder Thailand’s chairmanship of ASEAN from July \r\n2008 to the end of 2009, the ASEAN \r\nIntergovernmental Commission on Human Rights was \r\ncreated to protect and promote human rights and to \r\nuphold human dignity. We have also contributed to \r\nsetting international human rights norms in the area of \r\nimproving the lives of female inmates, through Her \r\nRoyal Highness Princess Bajrakitiyabha Mahidol’s, the \r\ndraft United Nations rules for the treatment of women \r\nprisoners and non-custodial measures for women \r\noffenders, which have been submitted for the \r\nAssembly’s consideration (see A/C.3/65/L.5). \r\n Thailand has also rendered humanitarian \r\nassistance to preserve human well-being and dignity \r\ninjured by natural disasters, not only in nearby places \r\nsuch as Myanmar, China and Pakistan, but also as far \r\nafield as Haiti and, most recently, Chad. We remain \r\nready to offer our facilities as a staging centre for \r\nhumanitarian assistance in our region. \r\n The flames of war can be sparked for many \r\nreasons, but none are as combustible as the security \r\ndivides and power imbalances, real or perceived, that \r\nexist between nations as well as within them. Thailand \r\nbelieves that global disarmament and non-proliferation \r\nare essential in order to level the security playing field, \r\nto dispel that sense of an imbalance of power and \r\nsecurity. The United Nations must continue its active \r\nrole to that end, but major Powers and regional entities \r\nmust also do their fair share: the Southeast Asian \r\nNuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty is a good case in \r\npoint. \r\n Thailand supports international efforts towards \r\nthe disarmament and non-proliferation of weapons of \r\nmass destruction. We have consistently abided by the \r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions and are gravely \r\nconcerned about the threat of the spread of such \r\nweapons to terrorists. That is why Thailand has \r\nrecently joined the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear \r\nTerrorism. \r\n A/65/PV.23\r\n \r\n19 10-55396 \r\n \r\n The maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity is a serious and costly endeavour, and history \r\nhas shown that the international community has often \r\nacted too late, enforcing and keeping the peace rather \r\nthan making it. We believe that more should be \r\ninvested in peacemaking and preventive diplomacy, \r\nwhich are much less expensive than peace enforcement \r\nand peacekeeping. It is much better to hold talks than \r\nto wage war. It is also far less likely for a community \r\nof nations to wage war within itself. That is why \r\nASEAN is steadfastly becoming a community: \r\neconomically, socially, culturally and politically. \r\n But in cases where peacekeeping has been and is \r\nnecessary, Thailand has also done its part. In the past \r\ntwo decades, we have contributed nearly 20,000 troops, \r\npolice officers and civilian staff to United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations worldwide: from Cambodia \r\nand Timor-Leste to Haiti and very soon Darfur in the \r\nSudan. Thailand has also recently sent a counter-piracy \r\ntask force to assist international efforts in patrolling \r\nand protecting ships from pirate attacks in the Gulf of \r\nAden area. These are our contributions to the \r\nmaintenance of peace and security worldwide, and we \r\nare prepared to do more. Rest assured that as long as \r\nthere is peace to be kept, the Thais will be ready to \r\nhelp keep it. \r\n However, peacekeeping alone is not enough. The \r\nconditions for sustainable peace must be built in post-\r\nconflict societies to ensure that blood is not shed again. \r\nWe believe that sustainable development is crucial to \r\nperpetual peace. This is what Thailand is working for, \r\nby helping lay the foundations for peace through \r\ndevelopment during the peacekeeping phase — from \r\nthe transfer of agricultural know-how in Timor-Leste to \r\nthe building of essential infrastructure in Burundi. We \r\nhave also striven for this goal through our membership \r\nof the Peacebuilding Commission. Thailand envisages \r\nthat body playing a greater role in ensuring sustainable \r\npeace worldwide. \r\n Thailand itself is poised to play a greater role in \r\nensuring international peace and security. We have \r\npresented our candidature for a non-permanent seat on \r\nthe Security Council for the term 2017-2018, for which \r\nwe ask members’ invaluable support. Thailand aspires \r\nto work closely with our international partners to \r\nensure that the path towards war is never trodden \r\nagain, but is rerouted towards peace. \r\n While we believe that the Security Council has so \r\nfar played an indispensable role in maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security, we also believe that \r\nthe Council should be adjusted to better reflect world \r\nrealities in order to tackle today’s global challenges \r\nmore effectively. Thailand envisions a Security Council \r\nworking with greater efficiency, transparency and \r\nengagement with concerned parties, be they countries, \r\nregional organizations or other United Nations bodies. \r\nWe believe that, through such reforms, the Council \r\nwould become more effective in maintaining peace and \r\nsecurity worldwide. \r\n Thailand is wholly committed to the United \r\nNations and its lofty ideals. Since the birth of the \r\nOrganization over six decades ago, Thailand has \r\nworked closely with the United Nations to advance \r\npeace and security, development and human rights \r\naround the world. And we will continue to do so. In \r\nspite of our problems, our commitment and \r\ndetermination have never wavered. \r\n As a medium-sized and middle-income \r\ndeveloping country, Thailand is ready to engage  \r\nwith — and serve as a connection between — North \r\nand South, East and West. As a country with substantial \r\nexperience in addressing today’s problems, we are \r\nready to help narrow the international gaps in \r\ndevelopment, human rights and security. Thailand \r\nbelieves that the time to act is now, and we stand ready \r\nwith our partners to act as a bridge between worlds and \r\nto help bridge the world’s divides. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency Archbishop Dominique \r\nMamberti, Secretary for Relations with States of the \r\nObserver State of the Holy See. \r\n Archbishop Mamberti (Holy See) (spoke in \r\nFrench): On behalf of the Holy See, I am pleased to \r\nwarmly congratulate you, Mr. President, on your \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-fifth session, and to offer our best wishes for the \r\nsuccessful fulfilment of your mandate. In this new \r\nperiod of work for the General Assembly, the Holy See \r\nwishes to offer its genuine collaboration in tackling the \r\nnumerous challenges faced by the international \r\ncommunity. The 65 years of existence of the United \r\nNations are a unique event in history in and of \r\nthemselves, particularly when contrasted with the \r\nannihilation of hopes placed in the peace conferences \r\nA/65/PV.23  \r\n \r\n10-55396 20 \r\n \r\nof the beginning of the twentieth century, and later in \r\nthe League of Nations. \r\n The existence of the United Nations shows that \r\nhumankind has found in the Organization a response to \r\nthe terrifying tragedies of the two World Wars. Despite \r\nthe imperfection of its structures and its way of \r\nfunctioning, the United Nations has sought to bring \r\nsolutions to international problems in the economic, \r\nsocial, cultural and humanitarian fields, and has tried \r\nto fulfil the mandate given to it by its Charter, namely \r\nto be a centre for the coordination of the action of \r\nStates with a view to the maintenance of peace and \r\nfriendly relations among peoples. \r\n The dialogue among the representatives of States \r\nthat is renewed every year in the plenary of the General \r\nAssembly, which remains open and lively in the other \r\nbodies and agencies of the United Nations family, has \r\nbeen the basic tool for fulfilling this mandate. There \r\nhave been times when this dialogue has been, more \r\nthan anything else, a clash of opposing and \r\nirreconcilable ideologies and positions. However, the \r\nUnited Nations has become irreplaceable in the life of \r\nthe people of the world in the search for a better future \r\nfor all the inhabitants of the planet. \r\n It is from the perspective of this productive \r\ninternational dialogue carried out through the \r\ndiscussions and deliberations that take place in this \r\nHall that I would like to recall important developments \r\nrelated to international peace and security that took \r\nplace during the sixty-fourth session of the Assembly. \r\n First of all, the Holy See welcomes the entry into \r\nforce on 1 August of the Convention on Cluster \r\nMunitions. This instrument, which the Holy See was \r\namong the first States to ratify, does represent an \r\nimportant result for multilateralism, based on \r\nconstructive cooperation among Governments and civil \r\nsociety, as well as the connection between \r\nhumanitarian law and human rights.  \r\n Another important result was the positive \r\nconclusion last May of the eighth Review Conference \r\nof the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons with the publication of a consensus-\r\nbased document that provides for different actions \r\nrelated to the three main pillars of the treaty: nuclear \r\ndisarmament, the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons \r\nand the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Among these, \r\nan important sign of hope was a decision to convene, \r\nbefore 2012, a conference to establish a Middle East \r\nzone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of \r\nmass destruction.  \r\n Furthermore, also in the area of peace and \r\ndisarmament, the first meeting, last July, in New York, \r\nof the Preparatory Committee for a Conference on the \r\nArms Trade Treaty, which is set for 2012 is also worth \r\nmentioning. This meeting showed that the process, \r\nwhich has begun for the treaty, is shared by all States \r\nthat are aware of the need to legally settle the issue of \r\nthe arms trade for reasons of peace, humanitarian \r\nprotection and social and economic development. \r\n In the context and spirit of successful \r\ninternational dialogue, we should also welcome the \r\nsigning of the New START treaty between the United \r\nStates and the Russian Federation. That signing is a \r\nstep forward in relations among the nuclear Powers, \r\nand the Holy See hopes that it will open new prospects \r\nand lead to substantial arms reductions in the future. \r\nSimilarly, during this session of the General Assembly, \r\na High-level Meeting was held, some days ago, on \r\nrevitalizing disarmament negotiations, which was very \r\nuseful for discussing ways to give new life to the \r\nConference on Disarmament and to continue to build a \r\nconsensus on the major obstacles to agreement on \r\ndisarmament, in particular, the Comprehensive \r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the Fissile Material Cut-\r\noff Treaty. We must do everything possible to achieve a \r\nworld free from nuclear weapons, and the Holy See \r\nsupports all efforts along these lines. \r\n During the previous session of the General \r\nAssembly, the United Nations made an unprecedented \r\ncontribution to international cooperation and peace in \r\nHaiti, where, during the earthquake of 12 January \r\n2010, the head of the United Nations Mission, \r\nAmbassador Hédi Annabi, died, as did his assistant, \r\nMr. Luiz Carlos da Costa, along with 82 other civil \r\nservants and members of the peacekeeping forces. On \r\nbehalf of the Holy See, I would like to extend our \r\nsincere condolences to the Secretary-General and the \r\nnational authorities of the States of the persons who \r\ndied, as well as their families and colleagues. Their \r\nsacrifice should serve as an impetus for a new global \r\ncommitment to maintaining peace.  \r\n The Holy See has always recognized and \r\nappreciated actions carried out by United Nations \r\npeacekeeping forces. The important increase in \r\nrequests for intervention in recent years shows the \r\nincreased confidence in United Nations activities in \r\n A/65/PV.23\r\n \r\n21 10-55396 \r\n \r\ncooperation with regional organizations, but it also \r\nhighlights the importance of the growing role played \r\nby the United Nations and regional organizations in \r\npreventive diplomacy.  \r\n Likewise, the action of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission remains fundamental to rebuilding the \r\nsocial, legal and economic fabric that was destroyed by \r\nwar and to avoiding the relapse into conflict. Initiatives \r\nto prevent conflicts, to peacefully resolve conflicts, to \r\nseparate warring parties and to promote reconstruction \r\ndeserve generous political and economic support from \r\nall States Members of the United Nations. Support \r\nfrom all would be an eloquent show of confidence in a \r\ndestiny based on solidarity for humankind.  \r\n If we think that normative developments with \r\nregard to disarmament and the non-proliferation of \r\nweapons have shown signs of progress, there are \r\nreasons for concern with respect to the many obstacles \r\nto global security and peace. Above all, military \r\nspending in the world continues to be excessive and \r\neven to increase. The problem of the exercise of the \r\nlegitimate right of States to the peaceful development \r\nof nuclear energy in accordance with effective \r\ninternational monitoring of non-proliferation remains \r\nrelevant. The Holy See encourages all parties involved \r\nin settling various ongoing controversies, in particular \r\nthose with respect to the Korean peninsula and the \r\nPersian Gulf region, as well as adjoining regions, to \r\ncarry out an honest in-depth dialogue that would be \r\nable to harmoniously reconcile all rights of the nations \r\nconcerned.  \r\n The recent terrible natural catastrophes in \r\nPakistan add to the difficulties caused by conflicts that \r\nhave beset that region. In addition to the humanitarian \r\nresponse, which must be generous, and other \r\nassociated measures, there must also be a broader \r\neffort at mutual and deeper understanding of the causes \r\nof the hostilities. \r\n Moreover, genuine dialogue, trust and generosity \r\nin putting aside peripheral or short-term interests are \r\nthe way to achieve a lasting solution to the conflict \r\nbetween the State of Israel and the Palestinians. \r\nDialogue and understanding among the various parties \r\ninvolved is also the only way to achieve reconciliation \r\nin Iraq and Myanmar, for example, as well as to \r\nresolve ethnic and cultural problems in Central Asia \r\nand the regions of the Caucasus and to calm recurring \r\ntensions in Africa, such as in the Sudan, just before \r\ndecisive elections. \r\n There is a significant economic component to \r\nmost of those conflicts. Substantially improving the \r\nliving conditions of the Palestinian people and other \r\npeoples living under civil or regional wars will no \r\ndoubt make a crucial contribution to transforming \r\nviolent opposition into patient and peaceful dialogue. \r\n The High-level Plenary Meeting on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) took place \r\nhere several days ago. All Member States once again \r\nsolemnly committed themselves to make every \r\nnecessary effort to achieve the MDGs by 2015. The \r\nHoly See welcomes the reiterated will to uproot \r\npoverty, which it hopes will resolutely be brought to an \r\nend. However, it is important to underscore that we \r\nwill not achieve the Goals without fulfilling two great \r\nmoral imperatives.  \r\n On the one hand, it is essential that rich and \r\nemerging countries fully honour their development \r\nassistance commitments and immediately establish and \r\noperationalize a financial and trading framework that \r\non the whole favours the weakest countries. On the \r\nother hand, rich and poor alike should ensure an ethical \r\npolitical and economic change that guarantees good \r\ngovernance and eradicates all forms of corruption. \r\nOtherwise, we risk reaching the year 2015 not having \r\nachieved sufficient results, except — and this would be \r\nsad and paradoxical — in the areas of population \r\ncontrol and promoting minority lifestyles, as \r\nintroduced in certain paragraphs of the recently held \r\nsummit. In that case, the Millennium Goals would \r\nbecome a veritable fraud vis-à-vis the comprehensive \r\nhuman development of peoples. \r\n With regard to the environment, which is the \r\nsubject of Millennium Goal 7, the participation of more \r\nthan 115 heads of State and Government at the \r\nConference of the States Parties to the Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change held in Copenhagen in \r\nDecember 2009 demonstrated the attention and \r\nimportance attached to an issue as complex as the \r\nclimate on the international agenda. The Holy See \r\nhopes that the next session of the Conference of the \r\nStates Parties will take a political decision that will \r\nmake the negotiations on a legally binding agreement \r\nmore concrete. \r\n At the heart of that debate is the establishment of \r\na development model based on a new energy system. \r\nA/65/PV.23  \r\n \r\n10-55396 22 \r\n \r\nNevertheless, it is important to recall the ethical issues \r\nassociated with this matter. It is not just about \r\nachieving a world less dependent on fossil fuels and \r\nmore devoted to energy efficiency and alternative \r\nfuels, but about changing unbridled and irresponsible \r\nconsumption behaviour. As my delegation has often \r\nobserved with regard to the Millennium Goals, it is that \r\nbehaviour, and not population growth and improving \r\nliving conditions in less developed countries, that \r\nplaces a growing and unsustainable burden on \r\nresources and on the environment. \r\n The positive results achieved by the international \r\ncommunity in the course of the Assembly’s previous \r\nsession would not have been possible without dialogue \r\namong Governments, which are being joined with \r\ngrowing determination and effectiveness by civil \r\nsociety interlocutors. However, to be honest and \r\neffective, that dialogue must be genuinely dia-logos — \r\nan exchange of wisdom and wisdom shared. The \r\ndialogue must move quickly from an exchange of \r\nwords and a search for balance among opposing \r\ninterests towards a genuine sharing of wisdom for the \r\ncommon good. \r\n It is precisely for that reason that Article 1 of the \r\nCharter links the promotion of human rights with the \r\ndefence of peace, settlement of disputes and resolving \r\ninternational problems of an economic nature. Nations \r\nare not separate entities, independent of the peoples \r\nwho comprise them. The fundamental national interest \r\nof all Governments should be the establishment and \r\nmaintenance of the necessary conditions for the full \r\ndevelopment of the material and spiritual good of \r\nevery inhabitant of their countries. The promotion of \r\nand respect for human rights are therefore the ultimate \r\ngoal of dialogue and international affairs, as well as the \r\nindispensable conditions for genuine and fruitful \r\ndialogue among countries.  \r\n The Holy See is also attentively following the \r\nwork of the Assembly’s Third Committee and of the \r\nOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. \r\nThis statement in the general debate is also an \r\nopportunity for me to express our support for the \r\nOffice of the High Commissioner for Refugees and all \r\nspecialized agencies and bodies working in the broad \r\nfield of human and humanitarian rights. In that regard, \r\nthe Holy See also believes that, although slow, the \r\nprogress made in the discussions on the principle of the \r\nresponsibility to protect is cause for hope. \r\nNevertheless, resolute and effective attention is still \r\nlacking with regard to the problems of refugees, people \r\nwho have been forcibly expelled and large-scale \r\ndisplacements.  \r\n The history of the development of human rights \r\nitself illustrates that respect for religious freedom is the \r\ncornerstone of the entire human rights architecture. \r\nWhen that freedom is lacking, absent too will be the \r\nrecognition of the transcendent nature of every human \r\nperson, which entails a dignity that existed before, and \r\nis superior to, the political and normative awareness \r\nand that creates an irrepressible framework of freedom \r\nand responsibility. If religious freedom falters, all \r\nhuman rights are at risk of becoming something that \r\ngovernment grants — or, at best, the result of a balance \r\nof social forces, which are variable by nature, because \r\nthey will have no foundation other than balance or \r\nagreement itself. \r\n Beyond criticism of the organizational limitations \r\nand lack of effectiveness of the United Nations, we see \r\nthat there is a universally shared awareness of the need \r\nfor the Organization, as well as a universal feeling of \r\ngratitude for its efforts. All of us understand that, by \r\nvirtue of its numerous bodies, the Organization \r\nconstitutes an essential forum for dialogue and \r\nunderstanding between nations. The best way of \r\nguaranteeing that the United Nations continues to carry \r\nout its historic mission of coordinating and keeping all \r\nStates united around the common goals of peace, \r\nsecurity and comprehensive human development for all \r\nwill be to continuously focus on the dignity of all men \r\nand women and effectively respect it, beginning with \r\nthe right to life — even of the weakest, such as unborn \r\nchildren and the terminally ill — and religious \r\nfreedom. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Bakary Fofana, Minister of \r\nState for Foreign Affairs, African Integration and la \r\nFrancophonie of the Republic of Guinea \r\n Mr. Fofana (Guinea) (spoke in French): I have \r\nthe honour to speak before the General Assembly to \r\nconvey the warm greetings of the people and \r\nGovernment of Guinea, and most especially that of His \r\nExcellency General Sékouba Konaté, interim President \r\nof the Republic, President of the Transition. On this \r\nhappy occasion, I would first of all like to congratulate \r\nyou, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the \r\nsixty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I wish you \r\nevery success and assure you in advance of my \r\n A/65/PV.23\r\n \r\n23 10-55396 \r\n \r\ndelegation’s support. Your undeniable personal \r\nqualities, in conjunction with proven ability, will \r\ncertainly inspire our work at a time when our \r\nOrganization faces numerous challenges involving the \r\nentire international community. I would also like to \r\nextend our gratitude to your predecessor,  \r\nMr. Abdussalam Treki, for the skill and dedication that \r\nhe showed in carrying out his mandate. \r\n Here, we would like to express our gratitude to \r\nour Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his \r\ntireless efforts to promote the noble ideals of the \r\nUnited Nations and, in particular, for his personal \r\ninvolvement in settling the crisis in my country. \r\n On assuming power on 23 December 2008 \r\nagainst a background of political and economic crisis, \r\nthe new Guinean authorities had to deal with many \r\ndifficulties, in particular poor governance, State \r\ncrimes, widespread insecurity and the proliferation and \r\ncirculation of small arms and light weapons. That \r\nworrying situation led to the adoption of various \r\nmeasures to restore order and security, build national \r\nunity and establish a regime respectful of human rights \r\nand individual and public freedoms.  \r\n In that specific context, the agreement signed in \r\nOuagadougou on 15 January 2010 enabled the people \r\nof Guinea, of all inclinations, to embark on a path of \r\npeace and dialogue and implement a political plan \r\nensuring the return to constitutional order based on the \r\nrule of law and good governance. Despite pitfalls, that \r\nprocess of democratization led to the establishment of \r\ntransitional bodies, specifically, a Government of \r\nnational unity, led by a Prime Minister, a head of \r\nGovernment coming from the Forces vives, the \r\nNational Transitional Council and the Independent \r\nNational Electoral Commission, as well as a timetable \r\nsetting the deadline for organizing free and transparent \r\nelections. \r\n In a show of great commitment, following the \r\nadoption of the new Constitution, the people turned out \r\nin force on 27 June 2010 for the most free and \r\ndemocratic presidential election that the country had \r\nknown since its independence in 1958. The second \r\nround of that important election is planned for the \r\ncoming weeks. \r\n Here, from this rostrum, I would like to launch an \r\nurgent appeal to the African and international \r\ncommunities to continue to support Guinea with a view \r\nto strengthening peace, stability and security in the \r\nsubregion. I would also like to pay warm tribute to the \r\nFacilitator, His Excellency Mr. Blaise Compaore, \r\nPresident of Burkina Faso, for his tireless efforts to \r\npromote the democratic process in Guinea. I also \r\nextend that tribute to the International Contact Group \r\non Guinea and, through it, the member States of the \r\nEconomic Community of West African States and of \r\nthe African Union, the international community and all \r\nfriendly countries that are working with us at this \r\ncritical time. \r\n Peace and security continue to be threatened in \r\nsome parts of the African continent and the world. \r\nSomalia continues to be subject to a fratricidal and \r\npainful war. In the Sudan, peace remains fragile despite \r\nthe huge sacrifices and the investments granted. We \r\nurge the African Union and the international \r\ncommunity to continue their efforts for a prompt and \r\nlasting settlement of those conflicts. \r\n In Côte d’Ivoire, the recent political \r\ndevelopments have made it possible for that friendly \r\nneighbouring country to move towards the presidential \r\nelection planned for 31 October. That important step \r\nforward, in conjunction with the positive outcomes of \r\nthe peacebuilding process in Sierra Leone and Liberia, \r\ngive us real cause for encouragement and hope for the \r\npeoples of the Mano River Union.  \r\n With regard to Western Sahara, my Government \r\nsupports the efforts of the United Nations and remains \r\nfirmly committed to the Moroccan initiative on the \r\nnegotiation of a status of autonomy for the Sahara \r\nregion. It urges the stakeholders to find a lasting and \r\nmutually beneficial political solution. \r\n The upsurge in threats and terrorist violence in \r\nAfrica are a source of serious concern to Guinea. My \r\ncountry supports the prompt establishment of a \r\nconsultative framework for action to eradicate that \r\nscourge. \r\n In the Middle East, my delegation welcomes the \r\ndirect talks between the Palestinian authorities and the \r\nIsraeli Government under the auspices of the United \r\nStates of America. It hopes that those talks will lead to \r\nthe establishment of an independent and sovereign \r\nPalestinian State, living side by side in peace with \r\nIsrael. The Guinean Government believes that peace in \r\nthat region can be achieved only in a climate of mutual \r\ntrust and with a will to implement the agreements and \r\nrelevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the \r\nSecurity Council. From that viewpoint, Israel must \r\nA/65/PV.23  \r\n \r\n10-55396 24 \r\n \r\nwithdraw from the occupied Palestinian territories and \r\nend its settlement policy. \r\n Only a week ago, in this Hall, the international \r\ncommunity reiterated its commitment to the billions of \r\npeople who are expecting it to make a reality of the \r\npromise of a better world expressed in the Millennium \r\nDeclaration (resolution 55/2). Guinea welcomes the \r\nholding of that summit, which allowed our heads of \r\nState and Government and our partners to reaffirm \r\ntheir will to achieve the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) within the agreed time frame. \r\n My country remains convinced that achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals is within reach. That \r\nis borne out by the remarkable progress made in many \r\nareas by countries that are among the poorest on the \r\nplanet. Barely five years from the 2015 deadline, we \r\nmust step up the pace, particularly in the countries \r\nfacing major challenges, in order to consolidate the \r\nachievements and make even more effective progress \r\nthan we have to date.  \r\n In order to take up the many challenges of the \r\ntwenty-first century, development partners and the \r\ninternational community have no choice but to step up \r\nefforts to work together to lend new impetus to \r\ninternational cooperation. My country urges all \r\nstakeholders to assume, at the national, regional and \r\ninternational levels, their share of responsibility in \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals.  \r\n The Republic of Guinea welcomes the progress \r\nmade in recent years with regard to official \r\ndevelopment assistance. However, it regrets that long-\r\nstanding commitments and those entered into more \r\nrecently are far from being met. It is vital to reflect on \r\nall standard and supplementary sources of financing for \r\ndevelopment. Innovative financing is becoming an \r\nincreasingly important means to mobilize additional, \r\npredictable and stable resources to supplement official \r\ndevelopment assistance. \r\n Guinea, which attaches great importance to an \r\nincrease in official development assistance, reiterates \r\nits proposal on organizing an African conference on \r\ninnovative financing and drawing up a draft African \r\ndeclaration on transparency of financial governance \r\nand fighting illegal capital flows. The purpose of that \r\nconference would be to promote strategies to mobilize \r\ninnovative financing as a complement to traditional aid \r\nand the domestic resources needed to fund the MDGs. \r\nThe draft African declaration on transparency of \r\nfinancial governance and fighting illegal capital flows \r\nwould seek to stem the immense capital outflows from \r\nAfrica by redirecting them towards development of the \r\ncontinent. \r\n Those proposals were warmly welcomed by \r\nvarious African bodies and the Leading Group on \r\nInnovative Financing for Development. They also \r\nreceived support at the twenty-fifth summit of heads of \r\nState and Government of Africa and France and the \r\nbacking of the African Union at its fifteenth summit in \r\nKampala. My delegation hopes that those initiatives \r\nwill feature among the proposals for action on Africa \r\nduring this sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly.  \r\n Regarding international trade, we hope for a \r\nprompt conclusion of the Doha Round negotiations on \r\nthe basis of an agreement that is both far-reaching and \r\nfair to all stakeholders, in particular the least developed \r\ncountries. We again call for developed countries to \r\nrespect their commitment to remove by 2013 all export \r\nsubsidies that significantly distort trade and \r\nagricultural production in developing countries. My \r\ncountry welcomes the substantial progress made with \r\nrespect to debt relief and urges the international \r\ncommunity to continue its endeavours to effectively \r\nimplement the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries \r\nInitiative. \r\n The subject of climate change quite rightly \r\noccupies a central place on the international agenda, \r\ngiven that phenomenon’s devastating effects. That \r\nreveals the emergence of a collective awareness and \r\nthe real threat that that phenomenon poses to \r\nhumankind.  \r\n Given that urgency, my country calls for \r\nconcerted and courageous international efforts to \r\nalleviate the suffering of victims, particularly the \r\nvulnerable populations of poor countries. The \r\ncommitments undertaken with regard to developing \r\ncountries in terms of financial resources, technology \r\ntransfer and capacity-building must be fulfilled, so that \r\nthe appropriate measures can be undertaken to adapt to \r\nclimate change and to mitigate its effects in those \r\ncountries. In that connection, my delegation hopes that \r\nthe climate conference to be held at the end of the year \r\nin Cancún, Mexico, will lead to an ambitious \r\nagreement that will commit States to concrete action.  \r\n As it is fully aware of the pressing need to act, \r\nthe Guinean Government, for its part, is determined to \r\nassume its share of the responsibility, especially since \r\n A/65/PV.23\r\n \r\n25 10-55396 \r\n \r\nGuinea plays a leading role in implementing all \r\npolicies and strategies aimed at achieving sustainable \r\ndevelopment and restoring ecological balance in \r\nwestern African. As the source of over 20 rivers that \r\nirrigate the West African region, including the Niger, \r\nSenegal, Gambia and Makona Rivers, Guinea is a \r\nveritable water tower for Western Africa and the \r\ncrucible for an incredibly rich biodiversity. \r\n The main theme of this session, “Reaffirming the \r\ncentral role of the United Nations in global \r\ngovernance”, is extremely timely. We acknowledge that \r\nmost gratefully. In a highly interdependent world that \r\nis marked by the combined effects of many crises, a \r\nnew culture of international solidarity is essential.  \r\n Likewise, a profound reform of our Organization \r\nis needed to make it more democratic, more \r\nrepresentative and transparent. Sixty-five years after its \r\ncreation, the United Nations does indeed need to be \r\nreformed in order to become more effective and better \r\nplaced to meet the aspirations of our peoples. Let us \r\nmake it an effective instrument in the service of peace, \r\nsecurity, development and human rights. Only in that \r\nway will current and future generations in all countries \r\nand all regions of the world see their hopes of living in \r\npeace realized in a world that is free and prosperous, \r\nwithout fear, poverty or need. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now call on \r\nHis Excellency Daw Penjo, Foreign Secretary of the \r\nKingdom of Bhutan. \r\n Mr. Penjo (Bhutan): I would like to congratulate \r\nyou, Mr. President, on your election to the presidency \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. We \r\nare confident that with your vast academic and political \r\nexperience, you will provide the Assembly with the \r\nnecessary leadership in the year ahead. Allow me to \r\nalso commend your predecessor, His Excellency  \r\nMr. Ali Treki, for his many initiatives and guidance in \r\nsteering the sixty-fourth session to a successful \r\nconclusion. \r\n My delegation welcomes your proposal on \r\n“Reaffirming the central role of the United Nations in \r\nglobal governance” as the theme for the general debate \r\nof this session. That theme is most appropriate, as it \r\ncomes at a time when the world looks to the United \r\nNations for its stewardship in addressing the multiple \r\nglobal crises, the devastating effects of climate change \r\nand the issue of the maintenance of global peace and \r\nsecurity. The United Nations has long been recognized \r\nas an indispensable global Organization due to its \r\nmandate, and must continuously adapt itself to deal \r\nwith the challenges confronting the world so that its \r\npivotal role in global governance is maintained. No \r\nother multilateral organization or intergovernmental \r\ngrouping, without the legitimacy of universal \r\nmembership, can hope to replace the centrality of the \r\nUnited Nations in global affairs. \r\n The vast majority of Members of the United \r\nNations are small States. The principle of sovereign \r\nequality enshrined in the United Nations Charter \r\nestablishes that all States, regardless of size, wealth, \r\nrelative power, population or level of development, are \r\naccorded equal opportunity to participate and \r\ncontribute to the work of the United Nations, its \r\nprincipal organs and its high-level posts. That, in fact, \r\nis the bedrock upon which this House was founded 64 \r\nyears ago. It is a principle that must remain in the \r\nforefront and help chart our course further as our \r\ndialogue on United Nations reform continues.  \r\n How can we, as Members of the United Nations, \r\ncredibly espouse equity among nations and peoples if \r\nwe fail to practise it among ourselves? After 39 years \r\nof membership, Bhutan continues to believe that the \r\nUnited Nations still has room and a role for smaller \r\nStates, as equal partners in global affairs, including in \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. \r\nFor that reason, Bhutan is seeking membership in the \r\nSecurity Council in a non-permanent seat for the term \r\n2013 and 2014. \r\n Last week at the High-level Plenary Meeting, our \r\nheads of State and Government acknowledged the \r\nplight of millions of people living in poverty and \r\nagreed to recommit themselves to keeping their pledge \r\non the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The \r\nsuccessful achievement of the MDGs by all Member \r\nStates will serve as a measure of the effectiveness of \r\nthe United Nations. The United Nations must therefore \r\ncontinue to provide the necessary leadership to foster \r\nrenewed global partnership to enable the realization of \r\nall the MDGs by 2015. \r\n On 20 September, Bhutan’s Prime Minister \r\nhighlighted to this gathering the need to move beyond \r\nconventional development practices (see A/65/PV.3). \r\nHe therefore proposed the inclusion of happiness as the \r\nninth Millennium Development Goal. My delegation is \r\nhopeful that that proposal of my Prime Minister will \r\nreceive the support of the United Nations membership. \r\nA/65/PV.23  \r\n \r\n10-55396 26 \r\n \r\n My delegation is pleased to note that the reform \r\nagenda initiated following the World Summit in 2005 is \r\nbeginning to yield results. In that regard, we welcome \r\nthe Assembly’s unanimous adoption of the resolution \r\non system-wide coherence (resolution 64/289) early in \r\nJuly 2010, which, inter alia, established UN Women. \r\nThe creation of UN Women effectively consolidates all \r\nthe existing mandates and functions relating to women \r\nand constitutes an important step in fulfilling the \r\ncommitments undertaken in the Fourth World \r\nConference on Women, held in Beijing. We are \r\nconfident that that entity will address the global issues \r\nof gender equality and women’s empowerment with \r\ngreat vigour. \r\n Bhutan has long been convinced that no society \r\ncan be a happy one if it is not inclusive. Promoting the \r\nconditions that will enable the pursuit of national \r\nhappiness by all our citizens, so that, regardless of \r\nrace, sex, language, religion, politics or other status, \r\nthey may enjoy a good quality of life in a progressive \r\nand prosperous country is not only one of the \r\nobjectives of government, it is our moral obligation. \r\nThis spirit is further reaffirmed by our Constitution, \r\nwhich guarantees the fundamental rights of all \r\nBhutanese, thus demonstrating that Bhutan is \r\ncommitted to building an inclusive society, one that \r\nenables all Bhutanese, including those with disabilities, \r\nto lead fulfilling lives, to contribute and to participate \r\nas full members of society. My Government was \r\ntherefore particularly pleased to sign the United \r\nNations Convention on the Rights of Persons with \r\nDisabilities on 21 September 2010. \r\n We are also pleased to note that resolution 64/289 \r\non system-wide coherence will contribute to the \r\nenhancement of the operational activities of the United \r\nNations, making the funding system more systematic \r\nand harmonizing the overall governance structure. This \r\nwould improve the capacity of the United Nations to \r\nmore effectively deliver assistance to countries, thus \r\nstrengthening its development pillar. \r\n My delegation recognizes the important role of \r\nthe General Assembly in setting the global agenda and \r\ndealing with many of the important issues confronting \r\nthe international community today. With each passing \r\nyear, the responsibilities entrusted to the General \r\nAssembly, as the chief deliberative and policy-making \r\nbody of the United Nations, continue to grow, and we \r\nbelieve that the authority of the General Assembly \r\nmust be simultaneously enhanced to assume the \r\ngrowing mandate entrusted to it. We therefore \r\nappreciate the progress made by the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup on the Revitalization of the General Assembly, \r\nwhere a number of key issues have been highlighted, \r\nespecially the strengthening of the Office of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly. We are confident \r\nthat, with the political determination of Member States, \r\nthose deliberations will result in a stronger United \r\nNations. \r\n We are encouraged that, in the past year, the five \r\nrounds of intergovernmental negotiations on the \r\nquestion of equitable representation in and larger \r\nmembership of the Security Council and other matters \r\nrelated to the Council, held under the chairmanship of \r\nAmbassador Zahir Tanin of Afghanistan, is making \r\ngood progress. My delegation supports the expansion \r\nof both the permanent and the non-permanent \r\nmembership of the Security Council to reflect the \r\ncontemporary realities and make it a more \r\nrepresentative body. We believe that India, Japan, \r\nGermany and Brazil plus two countries from the \r\nAfrican continent, which have the capacity and \r\nresources to shoulder the onerous responsibilities with \r\nregard to the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity, should be granted permanent membership. \r\n Given the renewed commitment of the \r\ninternational community to the MDGs with a view to \r\nimproving the lives of the people in the poorest \r\ncountries, it is most timely that the Fourth United \r\nNations Conference on the Least Developed Countries \r\nshould take place in 2011 in Turkey. We thank the \r\nGovernment of Turkey for its generous offer and \r\nassistance in hosting this important Conference. We \r\nalso appreciate the efforts of the United Nations Office \r\nof the High Representative for the Least Developed \r\nCountries, Landlocked Developing Countries and \r\nSmall Island Developing States in coordinating \r\npreparations for the Conference. \r\n As we undertake preparations for this event, we \r\nwill look to you, Mr. President, for your support and \r\ndirection, so that the least developed countries (LDCs) \r\ntogether with all our development partners cannot only \r\nensure a successful outcome, but also, more \r\nimportantly, give their people a chance for a better life. \r\nWe are confident that the Conference will build on the \r\nsuccesses of the Programme of Action for the Least \r\nDeveloped Countries for the Decade 2001-2010 and \r\nadopt new measures and strategies for the development \r\nof the LDCs in the next decade. \r\n A/65/PV.23\r\n \r\n27 10-55396 \r\n \r\n As most fittingly described, the other defining \r\nchallenge of our time, namely, climate change, requires \r\nthe collective and coordinated effort of all nations, as \r\nits devastating effects know no bounds. My country has \r\nfull faith in the leadership of the United Nations and \r\nbelieves in the centrality of the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change in \r\naddressing climate change. We are confident that the \r\nongoing negotiations will lead to a concrete, \r\ncomprehensive and equitable agreement at the \r\nsixteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange in Cancún later this year, as envisaged under \r\nthe Bali Action Plan. Success will be essential in \r\nCancún for small and vulnerable countries such as my \r\nown, which bears a heavier burden as the result of \r\nclimate change. We must have the necessary resources \r\nfor mitigation and adaptation. \r\n With the severe threats and damaging effects \r\ncaused by climate change in South Asia, as recently \r\noccurred in Pakistan, it was no coincidence that the \r\nsixteenth Summit of the South Asian Association for \r\nRegional Cooperation (SAARC), which Bhutan was \r\nhonoured to host in April this year, appropriately chose \r\nclimate change as its theme. In addition to adopting the \r\nThimphu Silver Jubilee Declaration, entitled “Towards \r\na Green and Happy South Asia”, the Summit also \r\nadopted the Thimphu Statement on Climate Change. \r\nThe Statement outlines important initiatives to further \r\nstrengthen and intensify regional cooperation to \r\naddress the adverse impacts of climate change in South \r\nAsia. One of the important outcomes of the Thimphu \r\nSummit is the formulation of a common SAARC \r\nstatement on climate change, which Bhutan, as the \r\ncurrent SAARC Chair, will present at the forthcoming \r\nConference of the Parties in December in Cancún. \r\n We are pleased to report that, as Bhutan \r\nprogresses into its third year as a democratic \r\nconstitutional monarchy, the foundations for a \r\nsustainable and vibrant democracy are growing \r\nstronger. The institutional arrangements for the three \r\nbranches of Government, as required under our \r\nConstitution, are now complete and functioning with \r\nthe establishment of the Supreme Court earlier this \r\nyear. Likewise, all the constitutional bodies with \r\noversight functions have been firmly established, and \r\nthe media is performing its role as the fourth estate in \r\nan atmosphere of freedom. \r\n There is no doubt that, given the challenges \r\nconfronting our increasingly interdependent world, the \r\nrole of the United Nations is vital in addressing those \r\nissues. In order to do so, the United Nations requires \r\nthe full support and commitment of the entire \r\nmembership. Only then will it be able to truly reaffirm \r\nits central role in global governance. I therefore \r\nconclude by assuring you, Mr. President, of my \r\ndelegation’s full support and cooperation, as you \r\nembark on a year-long journey of further strengthening \r\nthis Organization. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Pak Kil Yon, Vice-Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea. \r\n Mr. Pak Kil Yon (Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea) (spoke in Korean; interpretation provided by \r\nthe delegation): Mr. President, on behalf of the \r\ndelegation of the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea, I would like, first of all, to congratulate you on \r\nyour election to the presidency of the United Nations \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. In the same \r\nvein, I believe that your able leadership will bring \r\nsuccess to this session. \r\n This year marks the sixty-fifth anniversary of the \r\nfounding of the United Nations. The founding of the \r\nUnited Nations laid down an international legal basis \r\nfor preventing the recurrence of catastrophes, such as \r\nthe two World Wars that inflicted immeasurable \r\nsufferings on humankind, for safeguarding world peace \r\nand security and for achieving socio-economic \r\nprogress. The most important meaning of the founding \r\nof the United Nations is the establishment of the \r\nprinciple of sovereign equality in international \r\nrelations, which has enabled all States on this planet, \r\nlarge and small, to join their efforts for peace and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n The history of the United Nations, spanning 65 \r\nyears, is the history of continued challenges to the \r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. \r\nThe logic and politics of power, which seek to negate \r\nsovereign equality, still remain in sight in international \r\nrelations, even today after the turn of the century. \r\nInternational law and order are trampled on by the \r\narbitrariness and high-handedness of individual \r\nPowers. Military invasions of sovereign States, arms \r\nbuild-ups and threats of use of force continue \r\nA/65/PV.23  \r\n \r\n10-55396 28 \r\n \r\nunchecked and, what is more, a series of pretexts are \r\nused to justify them. \r\n Despicable trickery and attempts to overthrow \r\nother countries’ socio-political systems have become \r\never more rampant. The banner of human rights \r\nprotection and the institutional mechanism of the \r\nUnited Nations General Assembly are abused to that \r\nend. To deny the right of other countries to choose their \r\nown systems constitutes in itself a violation of the \r\nhuman rights of their people. The Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea is one of those victimized countries. \r\n That reality requires a strengthening of the role of \r\nthe United Nations, in conformity with the changed \r\ntimes and situation, which, in our view, is possible only \r\nafter a more dynamic and appropriate reform of the \r\nUnited Nations. The composition and the rules of \r\nprocedure of the Security Council should be \r\nrestructured and revised in such a way that the \r\nrepresentation and will of the entire United Nations \r\nmembership are correctly reflected, in particular, by \r\nthe full representation of the non-aligned countries and \r\nother developing countries. The representation of a \r\nnew group of United Nations Member States that \r\nachieved independence after the founding of the United \r\nNations should also be ensured. \r\n The authority of the General Assembly should be \r\nenhanced decisively. The General Assembly, which is \r\nthe most democratic organ in the United Nations, has \r\nless power than the undemocratic Security Council. \r\nThat abnormal situation should no longer be allowed to \r\ncontinue. In addressing key issues such as peace and \r\ndevelopment, the broad and active participation of the \r\ndeveloping countries and their interests should be duly \r\npromoted. \r\n The Korean peninsula, like the Middle East, has \r\nlong been a chronic hot spot seriously affecting world \r\npeace and security. The United Nations has included \r\nthe Korean issue as a major item on its agenda for over \r\n30 years. This led to the adoption of resolution  \r\n3390 (XXX) in 1975, calling for the dissolution of the \r\nUnited Nations Command in South Korea, the \r\nwithdrawal of all foreign forces there and the \r\nreplacement of the Armistice Agreement with a peace \r\nagreement, as a measure to reduce tension and \r\nmaintain lasting peace on the Korean peninsula. \r\n Another 35 years have elapsed since then. The \r\nKorean peninsula is nevertheless still in a state of \r\narmistice, which means that there is neither war nor \r\npeace. While the aforesaid resolution is yet to be \r\nimplemented, the sovereignty and the efforts of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea towards \r\npeaceful development are constantly threatened and \r\nundermined, as explosive situations leading to the \r\nbrink of war are created periodically on the Korean \r\npeninsula. The most recent example is the farcical huge \r\nsabre-rattling arms build-up and threat of use of force \r\nwaged on a massive scale by the United States and \r\nSouth Korean authorities on the Korean peninsula and \r\nits surroundings by taking advantage of the Cheonan \r\nincident. \r\n The touch-and-go situation created some time ago \r\nin North-East Asia, including the Korean peninsula, \r\nproved once again without a doubt that the United \r\nStates is not a defender, but a disruptor of peace. As \r\nlong as the United States nuclear aircraft carriers sail \r\naround the seas of our country, our nuclear deterrent \r\ncan never be abandoned, but should rather be \r\nstrengthened further. That is the lesson we have drawn. \r\n The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nregards it as its noble duty as a Member State to safeguard \r\npeace and security and promote socio-economic \r\ndevelopment and common prosperity in and around the \r\nKorean peninsula. Had it not been for the powerful war \r\ndeterrent built by the Songun politics of the great \r\nleader of our people, General Kim Jong Il, the Korean \r\npeninsula would have already been turned into a \r\nbattlefield scores of times, thus destroying regional \r\npeace and stability. \r\n A peaceful environment is most urgently needed \r\nfor the Government and people of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea, as they are now \r\nconcentrating all efforts on economic development in \r\norder to open the gate for a powerful and prosperous \r\nState in 2012, which marks the centennial anniversary \r\nof the birth of the great leader, President Kim Il Sung. \r\nThis year, which falls on the sixtieth anniversary of the \r\noutbreak of the Korean War, the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea again proposed respectfully to the \r\nparties to the Armistice Agreement to begin talks as \r\nearly as possible with a view to replacing the Armistice \r\nAgreement with a peace agreement. If that proposal is \r\nrealized, the General Assembly will see the \r\nimplementation of its historic resolution adopted 35 \r\nyears ago. The conclusion of a peace agreement will \r\nrepresent the most effective confidence-building \r\nmeasure for removing distrust among the parties to the \r\nArmistice and serve as a powerful driving force \r\n A/65/PV.23\r\n \r\n29 10-55396 \r\n \r\nguaranteeing the denuclearization of the Korean \r\npeninsula. \r\n There is no change in the position of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea in its \r\nopposition to nuclear war, the nuclear arms race and \r\nnuclear proliferation. The denuclearization of the \r\nKorean peninsula is the policy goal maintained \r\nconsistently by the Government of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea for peace and security in \r\nNorth-East Asia and the denuclearization of the world. \r\nThe denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, referred \r\nto in the Joint Statement of the Six-Party Talks issued \r\non 19 September 2005, means the process of turning \r\nthe whole Korean peninsula into a nuclear-weapon-free \r\nzone by completely eliminating the real external \r\nnuclear threats on the Korean peninsula in a verifiable \r\nmanner. As already clarified, our nuclear weapons do \r\nnot serve as a means to attack or threaten others, but as \r\na self-defensive deterrent, for all intents and purposes, \r\nto counter aggression and attacks from outside. \r\n As a responsible nuclear-weapon State, we are \r\nwilling to join in the international efforts for nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation and the safe management of nuclear \r\nmaterial on an equal footing with other nuclear-weapon \r\nStates. It is the long-cherished desire of the entire \r\nKorean nation to put an end to the history of \r\ndisgraceful division forced upon it by foreign forces \r\nand to live peacefully on a reunified land. \r\n In the new century, important progress towards \r\nreconciliation, common prosperity and reunification \r\nhas been achieved in inter-Korean relations. The \r\nhistoric inter-Korean summit between the North and \r\nthe South in 2000 and its resultant adoption of the joint \r\ndeclaration of 15 June, followed by another inter-\r\nKorean summit in 2007 and the publication of the \r\ndeclaration of 4 October, constitute a good programme \r\nfor reunification, unprecedented in our national history. \r\nThose historic declarations were welcomed and warmly \r\nsupported by the United Nations General Assembly.  \r\n Unfortunately, the present South Korean \r\nauthorities reject this grand reunification programme \r\nand are driving inter-Korean relations towards a \r\nrupture by bringing forward the so-called “three-phase \r\nunification proposal”, which is anti-reunification and \r\nconfrontational. They are stepping up an atmosphere of \r\nwar against their fellow countrymen in collusion with \r\nforeign forces with a view to rationalizing their \r\nconfrontational policy against the North. The  \r\nanti-reunification forces have no place on the Korean \r\npeninsula and, as such, the anti-peace forces should not \r\nbe offered a place in the international community. In \r\nthe future, the Government of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea will thoroughly implement the joint \r\ndeclaration of 15 June and the declaration of 4 October, \r\nand thus achieve the reconciliation and unity of the \r\nnation, which will surely open a new era of \r\nindependent reunification, peace and prosperity. \r\n The ideal of the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea’s foreign policy is independence, peace and \r\nfriendship. It accords with the ideas of the United \r\nNations. In accordance with that ideal, the Government \r\nof the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea will \r\nfurther strengthen and develop friendly and cooperative \r\nrelations with all Member States and fully discharge its \r\nresponsibilities for ensuring peace and security in the \r\nKorean peninsula and the rest of the world. \r\n In conclusion, my delegation totally rejects the \r\nprovocative statement delivered by the South Korean \r\ndelegation on 25 September (see A/65/PV.17), which \r\nreferred to the Cheonan incident again and distorted \r\nthe presidential statement of the Security Council of  \r\n9 July 2010 (S/PRST/2010/13 and S/PV.6355). The \r\ntruth of the Cheonan incident is still under cover. The \r\nresults of the unilateral investigation of South Korea, \r\nhave raised one doubt after another since its release, \r\nfollowing scientific military analysis and growing \r\nmanifold criticism inside and outside South Korea. The \r\nSouth Korean authorities have persistently refused to \r\naccept our proposal to send a field inspection group for \r\nscientific and objective verification of the truth of the \r\nincident. \r\n The Security Council, in its presidential statement \r\ndated 9 July 2010, took note of responses from other \r\nrelevant parties, including the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea, which has stated that it had nothing \r\nto do with the incident and encouraged the settlement \r\nof all outstanding issues by peaceful means to resume \r\ndirect dialogue and negotiations. South Korea is \r\nadvised not to create tension on the Korean peninsula \r\nby waging war exercises with outside forces and \r\npursuing a confrontational approach in defiance of the \r\nconcerns of the international community. It should \r\nimmediately embark on North-South dialogue so as to \r\nfind solutions to all outstanding issues, as \r\nrecommended by the presidential statement of the \r\nSecurity Council.  \r\nA/65/PV.23  \r\n \r\n10-55396 30 \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now give the \r\nfloor to His Excellency Mr. Vitaly Churkin, head of the \r\ndelegation of the Russian Federation. \r\n Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): The current, sixty-fifth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly has started with an unprecedented \r\nnumber of events covering the full range of the most \r\ntopical international issues. It is encouraging that, in \r\nthe light of the numerous challenges facing mankind, a \r\npositive unified platform for collective action has been \r\ntaking shape, with the United Nations playing the \r\ncentral role. Having learned from the dramatic events \r\nof recent decades and having realized that attempts to \r\ncut the Gordian knot by force in violation of the \r\nCharter will only lead to deadlock, the international \r\ncommunity has concluded that there is no alternative \r\nbut to address political, economic and other problems \r\nthrough joint efforts based on international law. And \r\nthe United Nations provides a universal platform to \r\nstrengthen this positive trend in international relations.  \r\n The Security Council is a key instrument of this \r\nOrganization to maintain international peace and \r\nsecurity. The high-level Security Council meeting held \r\non 23 September (S/PV.6389) reaffirmed its members’ \r\nintention to enhance that body’s efficiency, not only \r\nthrough direct involvement in conflict settlement but \r\nalso by creating prerequisites for the non-recurrence \r\nand prevention of crises. This proves that the \r\ncomprehensive approach to ensuring international \r\nsecurity is gaining ground, as it reflects modern \r\nrealities and is based on the principles and provisions \r\nof the United Nations Charter. \r\n The United Nations faces unprecedented, serious \r\nand multifaceted tasks in the key area of peacekeeping. \r\nWhile paying tribute to the efforts and sacrifice of \r\nthousands of men and women Blue Helmets, joint \r\nefforts should continue to refine the theory and practice \r\nof peacekeeping under United Nations auspices and to \r\nimprove the quality of planning and the conduct of \r\npeacekeeping operations with adequate political \r\ncontrol by the Security Council. \r\n It is encouraging that the United Nations is \r\nworking towards this goal on a truly collective basis. \r\nMember States have quite a few constructive ideas on \r\ntheir table, which include Russia’s initiative to \r\nrevitalize the Military Staff Committee in order to \r\nimprove the military expertise of Security Council \r\ndecisions. \r\n This year has been marked by progress in nuclear \r\ndisarmament. The 2010 Treaty between the United \r\nStates of America and the Russian Federation on \r\nMeasures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of \r\nStrategic Offensive Arms, signed by the Presidents of \r\nRussia and the United States in Prague, is a real \r\ncontribution by our two countries to strengthening \r\ninternational security and strategic stability. It is also \r\nthe result of positive changes in the relations between \r\nRussia and the United States that have placed Russian-\r\nAmerican interaction in world affairs on a qualitatively \r\nnew level.  \r\n We hope that the strong impetus provided by \r\nMoscow and Washington to the nuclear disarmament \r\nprocess will be followed similarly by all nations, \r\nprimarily by nuclear-weapon States. \r\n Pursuant to Russia’s policy towards strengthening \r\nthe United Nations role in global security, disarmament \r\nand confidence-building, we intend to table three draft \r\nresolutions during the current General Assembly \r\nsession: one on transparency and confidence-building \r\nmeasures in outer space activities, co-sponsored with \r\nChina; a draft resolution on developments in the field \r\nof information and telecommunications in the context \r\nof international security; and a Russia-United States \r\nco-sponsored draft resolution on bilateral strategic \r\noffensive arms reductions and the new framework for \r\nstrategic relations. We call for their adoption by \r\nconsensus. \r\n The universalization of the Treaty on the  \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and its \r\nguaranteed strict implementation comprise the \r\ncornerstone of a strengthened international  \r\nnon-proliferation regime. In that context, the search \r\nmust continue for an effective solution to the Iranian \r\nnuclear problem on the basis of NPT provisions and the \r\nnorms of international Law. The Iranian side must \r\nensure the requisite level of transparency and \r\ncooperation with the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (IAEA), which is acting on behalf of the \r\ninternational community with the Security Council’s \r\nsupport. \r\n Clarifying the outstanding questions about the \r\nIranian nuclear programme would not only meet the \r\ngoal of strengthening the non-proliferation regime but \r\nwould also quite obviously promote the interests of \r\nIran. Russia sees no reasonable alternative to a political \r\nand diplomatic settlement of the Iranian nuclear \r\n A/65/PV.23\r\n \r\n31 10-55396 \r\n \r\nproblem through constructive dialogue between Tehran \r\nand the six countries involved. The meeting of the \r\nForeign Ministers of the six countries in New York \r\nhelped to consolidate the shared intention to ensure the \r\nearliest resumption of such a dialogue. We will \r\ncontinue to do our utmost to achieve this goal. \r\n As far as the sanctions instrument is concerned, \r\nsanctions are not a goal in themselves. The objective of \r\nthe sanctions regime established by the Security \r\nCouncil is to signal to Iran that it must fully cooperate \r\nwith IAEA, and to give an impetus to the negotiating \r\nprocess. All members of the international community \r\nmust show solidarity based on mutual responsibility. \r\nWe strongly reject a situation in which unilateral \r\ndecisions — including ex-territorial ones that undermine \r\nthe very foundation of further joint efforts — are made \r\nwith regard to sanctions in parallel to collective efforts \r\nby the United Nations Security Council. We must put \r\nan end to that practice, which runs counter to \r\ninternational law and has negative political effects. \r\n Even more obvious, the economic and financial \r\ntrade blockade of Cuba, whose lifting the General \r\nAssembly has demanded for a number of years, is \r\nclearly an anachronism. The codification of the \r\nprinciple of equal and indivisible security is \r\nindispensable to productive international efforts in this \r\nfield, which is the precise goal of President \r\nMedvedev’s initiative to conclude a treaty on European \r\nsecurity. The proposal targets the complete transition of \r\nEuro-Atlantic policy from its old Cold War agenda to a \r\nnew one, as well as a firm legal foundation for the \r\nprinciple of indivisible security for all in the  \r\nEuro-Atlantic region proclaimed in the 1990s. We \r\nwelcome the substantive dialogue on this important \r\nRussian initiative, which has started in various \r\ninternational forums. \r\n A comprehensive settlement in the Middle East \r\nwould make a crucial contribution towards \r\nstrengthened global stability. The parties must \r\ndemonstrate political will and extend every effort to \r\npromote the success of the resumed direct Palestinian-\r\nIsraeli talks. The results of the ministerial Quartet \r\nmeeting of major international mediators held on  \r\n21 September demonstrated that appropriate support to \r\nthe Israelis and Palestinians will continue, but the \r\nultimate responsibility for a successful outcome rests \r\nwith them. \r\n In this connection, the decision by the Israeli \r\nauthorities to not extend the moratorium on Israeli \r\nsettlement activities has raised serious concern. A way \r\nout of the current impasse should be found so as to \r\nensure that negotiations continue. Our proposal to hold \r\nan international conference on the Middle East in \r\nMoscow is aimed at advancing the Middle East \r\nsettlement. This proposal has gained the support of all \r\ninterested parties and the United Nations Security \r\nCouncil. If the direct Palestinian-Israeli dialogue \r\nbecomes stable, the preparations for the Moscow forum \r\ncan get under way, which should also substantively \r\nexamine the Syrian and Lebanese tracks, as well as the \r\nprospects for the multilateral aspects of the Middle \r\nEast settlement. \r\n The development of a comprehensive strategy to \r\naddress the interconnected problems of the Middle East \r\nis on the agenda. It is necessary to continue working \r\ntowards an international conference in 2012 on the \r\nestablishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons and \r\nother weapons of mass destruction and their means of \r\ndelivery in the Middle East, pursuant to the decision of \r\nthe Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on \r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. \r\n Russia supports the international strategy for a \r\ncomprehensive settlement and for post-conflict \r\nrehabilitation of Afghanistan adopted by the Kabul \r\nConference, which envisages a stage-by-stage transfer \r\nof responsibility for the situation in that country to \r\nAfghan authorities, as effective governing structures \r\nare established in the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. \r\nThe future of Afghanistan must be determined by the \r\nAfghan people themselves. The international \r\ncommunity must continue to provide its assistance, \r\nwith an important role being played by the United \r\nNations. \r\n Lasting stabilization in Afghanistan and \r\nthroughout the region will be impossible without \r\nresolving the drug problem. The dimension of the \r\ndanger posed by narcotics emanating from Afghanistan \r\nrepresents a clear threat to international peace and \r\nstability and requires more resolute actions throughout \r\nthe entire chain of the production and proliferation of \r\nnarcotics — from the destruction of drug crops to the \r\nsuppression of precursor supplies, including drug \r\ntraffickers on the sanction lists of the Security Council. \r\nIt is also necessary to move to a new level of \r\ninternational cooperation. Russia’s initiative to \r\nestablish financial and counter-narcotics security belts \r\nA/65/PV.23  \r\n \r\n10-55396 32 \r\n \r\nalong the perimeter of Afghan’s borders is consistent \r\nwith those goals. \r\n The regional dimension of the long-term \r\nstabilization of Afghanistan is becoming ever more \r\ntopical. To that end, we must fully engage the potential \r\nof relevant organizations that are actively working in \r\nclose contact with Kabul on Afghan issues, including \r\nthe Collective Security Treaty Organization and the \r\nShanghai Cooperation Organization. \r\n The settlement process in the Sudan is \r\napproaching an important milestone. As the date of \r\nreferendum on the self-determination of the South of \r\nthat country draws closer, the parties to the \r\nComprehensive Peace Agreement must redouble their \r\nefforts to overcome the problems that still divide them. \r\nWe should also give new impetus to the Darfur \r\nsettlement process. At stake is the stability of \r\nconditions in the Sudan and throughout the vast \r\nAfrican continent. We welcome the constructive \r\nattitude demonstrated by the Sudanese and other \r\nparticipants in the high-level meeting on the Sudan that \r\nwas held here recently. \r\n In Somalia, the confrontation continues between \r\nthe Transitional Federal Government, supported by the \r\ninternational community, and extremists and terrorist \r\ngroups linked with Al-Qaida. The lack of a settlement \r\non land is fuelling the problem of piracy off the coast \r\nof Somalia. A more resolute pursuit of the political \r\nprocess and stronger assistance to the peacekeeping \r\noperation of the African Union and further counter-\r\npiracy efforts, including the criminal prosecution of \r\npirates, are priorities in international efforts on the \r\nSomali track, as reiterated during the recent  \r\nmini-summit on Somalia, which Russia fully supports. \r\n The results of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals summit have reaffirmed the important role of the \r\nUnited Nations on development matters and must help \r\nmobilize political support and financial resources for \r\nthe timely achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). That requires joint \r\nefforts by Governments, international financial and \r\ntrade institutions, the private sector and civil society, \r\nbased on the principles of global partnership and \r\nshared responsibility. \r\n It is obvious that most global problems, including \r\nthe achievement of the MDGs, cannot be resolved \r\nwithout engaging innovations, advanced technologies \r\nand modernization solutions. The same is valid for \r\nsuch challenges as climate change, energy and food \r\nsecurity and the fight against diseases. The engagement \r\nof the enormous potential of the United Nations, its \r\nfamily and system of specialized agencies in this area \r\nwill allow the Organization to become a catalyst in the \r\nestablishment and development of multilateral \r\nmodernization alliances. Russia is prepared to \r\nparticipate actively in that work. \r\n To live up to expectations, the United Nations must \r\ncontinuously renew itself. The reform of the Organization \r\nis progressively moving forward. This year, the \r\nnegotiations on strengthening system-wide coherence \r\nwere completed successfully. In particular, the new \r\nimportant United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and \r\nthe Empowerment of Women has been established. \r\n Negotiations will continue at the current session \r\nof the General Assembly on the expansion of the \r\ncomposition of the Security Council. This is an \r\nextremely important issue on the reform agenda of the \r\nOrganization, involving the interests of the \r\noverwhelming majority of States. For that reason, the \r\nfinal formula for Security Council reform should be \r\nbased on compromise and the broadest possible \r\nagreement in the United Nations. This requirement is \r\nalso fully applicable to all other aspects of United \r\nNations reform. \r\n This year marks the sixty-fifth anniversary of the \r\nUnited Nations, as well as that of the end of the Second \r\nWorld War, from the ashes of which the world \r\nOrganization was born. For the sake of the memory of \r\nthe millions of victims and in order to prevent a \r\nrepetition of such scourges, we must suppress attempts \r\nto falsify the events associated with that historic \r\ncalamity. That is the aim of a well-known Russian \r\ninitiative in the United Nations. We count on the \r\nbroadest support for a draft resolution on the topic. \r\n The United Nations is our common and unique \r\nOrganization. It is up to all of us to determine how \r\nproductive and really useful its future work will be for \r\nhumankind. By pulling our efforts together, we will be \r\nable to renew the United Nations effectively and \r\nprovide it with all the necessary resources. We are \r\nconvinced that reasonable resources spent on that goal \r\nwill bring tangible dividends to all members of the \r\ninternational community in the form of durable peace, \r\nsecurity, cooperation and prosperity all over the globe. \r\n  The meeting rose at 12.30 p.m. \r\n"
