" United Nations  A/65/PV.25\r\n  \r\n \r\nGeneral Assembly \r\nSixty-fifth session \r\n \r\n25th plenary meeting \r\nTuesday, 5 October 2010,  10 a.m. \r\nNew York \r\n \r\nOfficial Records\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the interpretation of \r\nspeeches delivered in the other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original \r\nlanguages only. They should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature \r\nof a member of the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room \r\nU-506. Corrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum. \r\n10-56676 (E) \r\n*1056676*   \r\nPresident: Mr. Deiss . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Switzerland) \r\n \r\n \r\n In the absence of the President, Mr. Ndong Mba \r\n(Equatorial Guinea), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 108 (continued) \r\n \r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of the \r\nOrganization (A/65/1) \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): \r\nMembers will recall that the Secretary-General \r\npresented his annual report (A/65/1) to the General \r\nAssembly at its 11th plenary meeting, on 23 September \r\n2010. \r\n Mr. Núñez Mosquera (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nWe thank the Secretary-General for the presentation of \r\nhis annual report (A/65/1). The report acknowledges \r\nthe complex world situation, in particular with regard \r\nto the devastating effects of the global economic and \r\nfinancial crisis. As the Secretary-General points out, \r\nthe measures taken to stimulate growth and global \r\neconomic recovery have not always met the needs of \r\nthe poor and the most vulnerable. On the contrary, \r\ndespite promises, developed countries have resorted to \r\nthe most shameless protectionism as part of their \r\npolicies in response to the crisis, to the detriment of \r\nunderdeveloped economies.  \r\n At the recent High-level Plenary Meeting on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, it remained clearly \r\napparent that the lack of financial resources continues \r\nto be the main reason for delays in meeting those \r\nmodest objectives. The calls for new and additional \r\nresources to try to reach the Millennium Development \r\nGoals by 2015 were once again ignored by rich \r\ncountries, which did not allow even a single mention in \r\nthat regard in the outcome document of the High-level \r\nMeeting (resolution 65/1).  \r\n It has become clear not only that the majority will \r\nnot be able to achieve the Millennium Development \r\nGoals, but also that other internationally agreed \r\ndevelopment goals will remain an illusion. It should be \r\npointed out that all such commitments made within the \r\nframework of major United Nations conferences and \r\nsummits are also part of what the report calls the \r\nconcrete framework that serves as a guide for the \r\nOrganization’s development activities.  \r\n Introducing radical changes in the consumption \r\nand production patterns of the societies of the North \r\nand building a new international economic order are \r\nthe only way to meet the goals and objectives to which \r\nwe have committed. The creation of a new global \r\nfinancial architecture must be a priority in the \r\nOrganization’s deliberations. \r\n We are pleased that the report acknowledges the \r\nwork of the General Assembly working group on the \r\nworld financial and economic crisis as an important \r\ninitiative. Cuba hopes that that working group can \r\ncontinue its work to discuss in greater depth the topics \r\non its agenda and to decide on them.  \r\n The report mentions the nine joint initiatives \r\ndesigned by the United Nations system to respond to \r\nthe crisis. We underscore that all initiatives of that kind \r\nmust be duly discussed with States before their \r\nA/65/PV.25  \r\n \r\n10-56676 2 \r\n \r\nimplementation. We express similar concern about the \r\ncreation of the High-level Advisory Group on Climate \r\nChange Financing and the High-level Panel on Global \r\nSustainability, established by the Secretary-General \r\nwithout due consultation with the Secretariat and \r\nMember States. We trust that such situations will not \r\nrecur.   \r\n The report proposes the development of low-\r\ncarbon economies in developing countries. In that \r\nregard, we underscore that developed countries must \r\nshoulder their historic responsibilities, as well as the \r\ncommitments made under the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change and the \r\nKyoto Protocol, and meet the ambitious reduction \r\ncommitments at the sixteenth Conference of the Parties \r\nto the Convention.  \r\n For their part, developing countries have the \r\npriority goal of achieving sustainable development. \r\nThey need the support of the international community, \r\nin particular that of developed countries, in order to \r\ngain new and additional financial resources, capacity-\r\nbuilding and technology transfer under preferential \r\nconditions.  \r\n Moreover, we are concerned about the assertion \r\nin the report that the so-called Copenhagen Accord \r\n“was an essential step forward in global efforts to \r\naddress the climate challenge” (see A/65/1, para. 108). \r\nThe Copenhagen Conference generated a crisis of \r\nconfidence owing to the lack of transparency with \r\nwhich the negotiations were conducted, disregarding \r\nthe very standards and procedures of the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \r\nand the United Nations. The Framework Convention is \r\nand must continue to be the only framework for \r\ninternational negotiations on climate change, which \r\nshould continue along the two tracks agreed in Bali.  \r\n The sixteenth Conference of the Parties must \r\nachieve agreements on mitigation and adaptation under \r\nthe Convention that enable developing countries \r\nsubstantially and predictably to address the increasing \r\nthreats associated with climate change.  \r\n The main challenge before us is that of reforming \r\nthe United Nations so that it serves the interests of all \r\nnations equally. We cannot allow the reform to end up \r\nturning our Organization into an instrument for the \r\ninterests and whims of a few rich and powerful \r\ncountries. We must revitalize the guiding role of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, the only United Nations organ \r\nwhere there is no room for hegemony, where we all \r\nhave the right to speak and vote and where the obsolete \r\nright to veto does not exist. \r\n We cannot speak of true reform of the \r\nOrganization without real reform of the Security \r\nCouncil. The intergovernmental negotiations on \r\nreforming the Council have still not produced the \r\nconcrete results that we hoped for. We trust that real \r\nprogress will be made during this session. We urgently \r\nneed a truly balanced and representative Security \r\nCouncil that acts on behalf of all and within the \r\nmandate entrusted to it by the Charter. \r\n Cuba welcomes the creation of UN Women, \r\nwhich was a historic step forward towards achieving \r\ngender equality and empowering all women of the \r\nworld. We hope that the new gender entity will, in \r\naccordance with its mandate, develop mechanisms to \r\nfollow up all the commitments made at the Beijing \r\nConference.  Furthermore, while we note the results \r\nenshrined in resolution 64/289, we reiterate that United \r\nNations development assistance is not subject to \r\nunique models and we reaffirm the principle that it \r\nmust be guided by national priorities and led by \r\nnational Governments. \r\n Cuba reaffirms the importance of international \r\ncooperation and genuine dialogue concerning human \r\nrights. We must eradicate forever political \r\nmanipulation, selectivity and double standards with \r\nrespect to human rights. We must not allow these evils \r\nto affect United Nations human rights mechanisms, \r\nincluding the Human Rights Council. \r\n In his report, the Secretary-General refers to the \r\nupcoming review of the Human Rights Council, which \r\nwe believe should be a single, transparent and inclusive \r\nprocess of an intergovernmental nature. All of us must \r\nwork to preserve the positive aspects of the Council, \r\nincluding the Universal Periodic Review mechanism, \r\nwhich is the ideal space to consider the human rights \r\nsituation in all countries under equal conditions. \r\n Moreover, Cuba will give special attention to \r\ndebates on human resources reform, because we must \r\ntake a final decision at the current session on \r\nsimplifying the contracting regime and harmonizing \r\nconditions of service. In this context, we will advocate \r\nfor better geographic distribution in Secretariat staff, \r\nespecially in entities such as the Office of the United \r\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights, where \r\n A/65/PV.25\r\n \r\n3 10-56676 \r\n \r\nan imbalance in its staff composition plays a key role \r\nin the severe distortions of its activities. \r\n It is also essential that the United Nations System \r\nChief Executives Board for Coordination be more \r\naccountable for its activities and achieve greater \r\ntransparency in the election and selection of the senior \r\nofficers of the Organization. In this vein, the Joint \r\nInspection Unit has posited several ideas that should be \r\ntaken into account. \r\n In the report, it is stated that the international \r\ncommunity has made significant progress in the fields \r\nof disarmament and non-proliferation, especially in the \r\nnuclear context. Reality gives much greater cause for \r\nconcern. There are 22,600 nuclear weapons worldwide, \r\nof which 7,560 are ready for immediate deployment. \r\nThese are much more powerful than those that sowed \r\ndeath and destruction in the Japanese cities of \r\nHiroshima and Nagasaki.  \r\n The prohibition and complete elimination of \r\nnuclear weapons remains an urgent pending task. \r\nWhile millions of people suffer the effects of the worst \r\neconomic and financial crisis since the Great \r\nDepression, international military spending continues \r\nto increase at a dizzying pace. Currently, it totals \r\n$1,521 billion — a figure many times greater than \r\ninternational development aid.  \r\n Cuba reiterates its proposal that at least half of \r\ncurrent military spending be devoted to responding to \r\neconomic and social development needs through a fund \r\nmanaged by the United Nations. We also propose that a \r\nglobal action plan be agreed without delay on \r\nachieving complete elimination and prohibition of \r\nnuclear weapons within not more than 15 years. \r\n The challenges facing us are very serious. More \r\nthan ever, the world needs the United Nations and our \r\nunited action. Cuba will continue to work tirelessly for \r\na better world for all. \r\n Mr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): We would like \r\nto thank the Secretary-General for his report on the \r\nwork of the Organization (A/65/1). The past session of \r\nthe General Assembly brought some important \r\nbreakthroughs in the United Nations reform agenda. \r\nThe creation of UN Women in particular was a major \r\ncontribution to a more coherent and less duplicative \r\nOrganization. The timely appointment of Ms. Bachelet \r\nat the head of the new entity should guarantee a \r\nsmooth transition without major operative \r\ninterruptions. \r\n We also consider the reformed Taliban and  \r\nAl-Qaida sanctions regime of the Security Council to \r\nbe a big step in the right direction. The new Office of \r\nthe Ombudsperson, headed by Ms. Kimberly Prost, \r\nwill contribute to the legitimacy and effectiveness of \r\nthe sanctions regime and the Council itself. The United \r\nNations, as a whole and in its parts, needs these \r\nqualities urgently in order to secure its standing as the \r\ncentre for global governance. \r\n The choice of “global governance” as the theme \r\nof this year’s general debate was received positively by \r\nMember States. We thus hope that it will remain the \r\noverarching topic of the entire session. An \r\nindispensable element of global governance based on \r\nthe principle of sovereign equality is that any global \r\ngovernance system must have a set of clear applicable \r\nrules. We therefore see a close connection between the \r\ntopics “rule of law” and “global governance” and \r\nwould therefore welcome a thematic debate on the rule \r\nof law during this session of the Assembly. \r\n The United Nations has the broadest legitimacy \r\nof all intergovernmental organizations based on its \r\nmembership and the democratic structure of its main \r\ndeliberative body, this Assembly. But legitimacy \r\ncannot be based solely on structural and institutional \r\naspects. United Nations agencies, funds and \r\nprogrammes, as well as its peacekeeping and \r\npeacebuilding missions, are the face of the United \r\nNations to the outside world and must strengthen the \r\nOrganization’s legitimacy as a whole on the basis of \r\nthe daily work they deliver to States, individuals, the \r\ngeneral public and civil society.  \r\n We continue to see a lot of potential in this field. \r\nOperational legitimacy is earned through transparent \r\nand efficient work and through independent \r\naccountability mechanisms. The work of the Office of \r\nInternal Oversight Services (OIOS) is therefore very \r\nimportant. OIOS makes an essential contribution to \r\nraising awareness within and outside the United \r\nNations of necessary management reforms and \r\nstructural deficits in the organizational set-up of the \r\nUnited Nations.  \r\n We are concerned that, after a period of \r\nresponsiveness to the recommendations of the Office, \r\nthe eagerness to implement them is in overall decline. \r\nWe believe that the United Nations has a particular \r\nA/65/PV.25  \r\n \r\n10-56676 4 \r\n \r\nresponsibility to urgently address all allegations of \r\nsexual misconduct and misappropriation of funds. Past \r\nexperience has shown how detrimental system \r\nbreakdowns in the area of management oversight can \r\nbe. We hope that the Assembly will engage in an open \r\nand productive discussion of these issues. \r\n The agenda of the current session provides us \r\nwith the opportunity to streamline and optimize \r\nprocesses in the areas of peacebuilding and human \r\nrights. We hope that the review of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission will strengthen the Commission’s \r\npreventive dimension and sharpen its focus to address \r\nthe root causes of conflicts. We believe that substantial \r\nimprovement in the coherence of the different human \r\nrights bodies is possible and, indeed, necessary. The \r\nrelationship between the Human Rights Council and \r\nthe General Assembly — that is, its Third and Fifth \r\nCommittees — has been unclear and inefficient in the \r\npast. We hope that we, as Member States, will take the \r\nopportunity of the review to address this relationship \r\nand the issue of providing a regular and steady \r\nmechanism to fund decisions by the Council, where \r\nnecessary. A successful review process would \r\nstrengthen the governance of the United Nations in this \r\nfield. I am personally grateful for the trust that the \r\nPresident of the Assembly has placed in Ambassador \r\nLoulichki of Morocco and myself to assist in leading \r\nthis Assembly on the matter of review of the Council. \r\n In the Security Council, the United Nations has \r\nthe most powerful tool in international law at hand. Yet \r\nit is perceived as lacking political legitimacy due to its \r\nunrepresentative composition. Political progress on this \r\nissue has been deadlocked for a long time, and States \r\nneed to be aware of the risk of an institutional crisis of \r\nthis Organization as whole if this situation prevails for \r\nmuch longer. We continue to stand ready to make our \r\ncontribution to a serious enlargement discussion.  \r\n In parallel, we will vigorously pursue the agenda \r\nof the group of five small countries on the working \r\nmethods of the Council, where progress has been less \r\nthan satisfactory. In a letter sent to the Chairman of the \r\nInformal Working Group on Documentation and Other \r\nProcedural Questions of the Security Council, we have \r\ntaken note of the updated presidential note of the \r\nCouncil (S/2010/507), which has the merit of providing \r\nan overview of the current state of play. At the same \r\ntime, it offers very little in the way of effective \r\nmeasures to improve the accountability, access and \r\ninclusion of non-members of the Council — the areas \r\nwhere we believe the most work remains to be done. \r\nWe will continue to pursue these goals, including in \r\nthis Assembly. \r\n Mr. Kodama (Japan): At the outset, allow me to \r\nextend my deep appreciation to His Excellency \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his remarkable \r\ndevotion in guiding the diverse activities of the United \r\nNations and for his report on the work of the \r\nOrganization (A/65/1). \r\n The most urgent challenge facing the United \r\nNations at this time is the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). We are \r\nconcerned about the impact of the financial and \r\neconomic crisis on the efforts of developing countries \r\nto attain the MDGs. Now that this year’s High-level \r\nPlenary Meeting has been successfully concluded, we \r\nmust follow through on all the commitments and \r\npromises, without losing any time, in order to \r\naccelerate progress and achieve the MDGs by the \r\ntarget year of 2015. Japan, for its part, will deliver on \r\nthe promises made by Prime Minister Kan, focusing on \r\nthe two crucial sectors of health and education. \r\n Efforts for the reduction of poverty alone will not \r\ntranslate into the achievement of the MDGs. A \r\nsignificant proportion of the bottom billion of the poor \r\nare caught up in conflict or barely surviving in tenuous \r\npost-conflict situations. It is often said that as many as \r\n50 per cent of post-conflict countries relapse into \r\nhostilities within 10 years after the conflicts end. \r\n In order to break the vicious circle of conflict and \r\npoverty, it is essential to address the two factors \r\ncomprehensively. Once a conflict has been resolved, \r\nthere should be quick delivery of a peace dividend, \r\nwhich can be discerned by the people in the form of \r\ntangible improvements in their daily lives and which is \r\nsupported by urgent measures to enhance social and \r\neconomic stability. \r\n In this context, Japan appreciates the activities \r\nundertaken by the Peacebuilding Commission to \r\npromote such an integrated strategy and to fill some of \r\nthe most conspicuous gaps. During its presidency of \r\nthe Security Council this year, Japan hosted an open \r\ndebate of the Council on post-conflict peacebuilding \r\n(see S/PV.6299). We will continue to endeavour to \r\npromote this seamless approach to peacebuilding, \r\ntaking into consideration the perspective of human \r\nsecurity. \r\n A/65/PV.25\r\n \r\n5 10-56676 \r\n \r\n The concept of human security represents a \r\nhuman-centred and integrated strategy aiming at \r\nactualizing freedom from fear and want for every \r\nindividual. It is also a bottom-up approach, beginning \r\nwith the protection and empowerment of the individual \r\nand the community. \r\n In this regard, I welcome with appreciation the \r\nadoption of resolution 64/291, entitled “Follow-up to \r\nparagraph 143 on human security of the 2005 World \r\nSummit Outcome” in July of this year. The adoption of \r\nthis resolution was a crucial milestone in the efforts to \r\nmaterialize the commitments of the 2005 World \r\nSummit Outcome (resolution 60/1) and to integrate the \r\nhuman security approach into United Nations \r\nactivities. We commend the assistance rendered by the \r\nFriends of Human Security and look forward to \r\ncontinuing the discussion on this concept during the \r\nnext session. \r\n Gender equality and the empowerment of women \r\nnow play a central role throughout the work of the \r\nUnited Nations. We welcome the establishment of  \r\nUN Women, which will lead to the strengthening of the \r\nUnited Nations commitment to gender mainstreaming. \r\nJapan is committed to contributing actively to help to \r\nensure that all activities related to gender in the United \r\nNations will operate collaboratively in the most \r\neffective and efficient manner possible. Moreover, we \r\nintend to utilize this momentum to renew our \r\ncommitment to furthering the advancement of gender \r\nequality and women’s empowerment both in Japan and \r\nin the wider international community. \r\n Peacekeeping remains the core activity of the \r\nUnited Nations. Japan will continue to participate \r\nactively in United Nations peacekeeping operations \r\nand disaster relief operations, as we have done in the \r\ncase of the earthquake in Haiti and the floods in \r\nPakistan. \r\n At the same time, United Nations peacekeeping \r\nnow faces unprecedented challenges in terms of both \r\nthe capacity of Member States and the complexity of \r\nmission mandates. Therefore, all the stakeholders \r\nresponsible for these activities, such as the General \r\nAssembly, the Security Council, Member States and \r\nthe Secretariat, must cooperate proactively to formulate \r\nimprovement measures that will ensure that \r\npeacekeeping operations are assigned clear and \r\nachievable mandates and managed effectively and \r\nefficiently, with adequate resources. \r\n We welcome, as measures to advance global \r\npeace and security, the recent positive developments in \r\nthe area of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, \r\nincluding the successful outcome of the 2010 Review \r\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the  \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Assuming its \r\nmoral responsibility as the only country that has ever \r\nsuffered the tragic consequences of atomic bombings, \r\nJapan is determined to exert every effort to achieve a \r\nworld without nuclear weapons. To that end, Japan will \r\nsubmit a draft resolution during this session outlining \r\nconcrete measures towards the total elimination of \r\nnuclear weapons. \r\n I also take this opportunity to thank the \r\nSecretary-General once again for making his visit to \r\nHiroshima and Nagasaki in August to attend the sixty-\r\nfifth Peace Memorial Ceremony — the first United \r\nNations Secretary-General to do so — and for \r\ndemonstrating his earnest resolve to realize a world \r\nwithout nuclear weapons. \r\n Another major challenge confronting humankind \r\nat this juncture is climate change. Aiming at the final \r\nobjective of adopting a new, comprehensive, legally \r\nbinding document, Japan will continue to coordinate \r\nwith other States and the United Nations to lead \r\ninternational negotiations for the success of the \r\nsixteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange in Cancún, Mexico. We will also steadily \r\nsupport those developing countries that are making \r\nefforts to reduce emissions and are vulnerable to the \r\nnegative impacts of climate change through various \r\nchannels, including partnership between the public and \r\nprivate sectors. \r\n Japan will host the Tenth Conference of the \r\nParties to the Convention on Biological Diversity in \r\nNagoya this month, and believes that every effort must \r\nbe made to come to agreement on commencing new \r\nactions to halt the rapidly progressing loss of \r\nbiodiversity. We are determined to play an important \r\nrole in resolving this issue. \r\n The role and functions of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil are to be carefully reviewed by the close of the \r\nyear 2011. The Council thus stands now at an \r\nespecially important juncture. Japan is fully committed \r\nto taking part in the discussions in various forums, \r\nsuch as the General Assembly, the Third Committee \r\nand the Human Rights Council, to make further \r\nA/65/PV.25  \r\n \r\n10-56676 6 \r\n \r\ncontributions to enhancing the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights. \r\n Reform of the United Nations cannot be \r\nconsidered complete without meaningful Security \r\nCouncil reform. Japan recognizes the solid progress \r\nmade in the intergovernmental negotiations during the \r\nsixty-fourth session of the General Assembly, and \r\nlooks forward to international negotiations based on \r\nthe second revision of the negotiation text in the \r\ncurrent session, as mandated by General Assembly \r\ndecision 63/568.  \r\n It is Japan’s view that the Security Council must \r\nbe reformed through the expansion of both the \r\npermanent and non-permanent memberships, so that \r\nthe Council will reflect the realities of the geopolitical \r\nconfiguration of the world in the twenty-first century. \r\nIn that regard, we are pleased to note that the President \r\nof this General Assembly is clearly focused on the need \r\nfor early reform of the Security Council, and we count \r\non his steady leadership to guide us to a concrete \r\noutcome during this session. \r\n Japan wishes to reaffirm the importance of \r\ntransparent, accountable and efficient management of \r\nthe United Nations. The determined efforts of the \r\nSecretary-General to work towards a more efficient and \r\nresponsive Secretariat have our full and enthusiastic \r\nsupport. We are all well aware that the current state of \r\nthe world economy negatively impacts the financial \r\nsituations of Member States. In that light, it is clear \r\nthat the recent trend in United Nations fiscal \r\nmanagement characterized by continuous expansion of \r\nthe Organization’s regular and peacekeeping budgets \r\ncan no longer be sustained. The Secretariat must be \r\nstreamlined for greater effectiveness and efficiency and \r\nin order to facilitate the fulfilment of its mandates \r\nwithin the available financial resources of Member \r\nStates. We look forward to carefully studying the \r\nproposal to be made by the Secretary-General related \r\nto human resource management with a view to \r\nestablishing a robust and lean Organization. \r\n From that point of view, the Secretariat should \r\nmake a concerted effort to rationalize expenditures and \r\ndevelop strategies for implementing mandated \r\nactivities at lower cost. To the extent possible, new \r\nrequirements should be met through the redeployment \r\nof existing resources. Rigorous financial discipline \r\nmust be exercised in the implementation of the 2010-\r\n2011 programme and peacekeeping budgets. \r\n I conclude my remarks today by reiterating \r\nJapan’s determined commitment to continuing to work \r\ntowards a more efficient United Nations. \r\n Mr. Wang Min (China) (spoke in Chinese): The \r\nChinese delegation welcomes the report of the \r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization \r\n(A/65/1). Currently, the international security situation \r\nis generally stable, but various global threats and \r\nchallenges are prominent. The profound effects of the \r\ninternational financial crisis have gradually become \r\nclear amid various growing uncertainties.  \r\n Faced by diverse threats and challenges over the \r\npast year, the United Nations has actively engaged in \r\nmultilateral cooperation and played an important role \r\nin implementing the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs), carrying out preventive diplomacy, deploying \r\ninternational peacekeeping operations, implementing \r\npost-conflict peacebuilding, responding to climate \r\nchange, fighting terrorism and protecting human rights. \r\nWe take this opportunity to thank Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon for his hard work and good efforts over \r\nthe past year. \r\n The High-level Plenary Meeting on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals injected new vigour \r\ninto the international development agenda. The next \r\nfive years will be critical to achieving the MDGs. The \r\nUnited Nations should prioritize the timely \r\nachievement of the MDGs and establish an MDG \r\nassessment mechanism as soon as possible. It must, \r\nwith a greater sense of urgency and responsibility, \r\nintensify efforts to ensure that the task will not be \r\ninterrupted or delayed. It must encourage the \r\ndeveloped countries to honour their commitments \r\neffectively and to assume the primary responsibility for \r\nassisting developing countries and providing them with \r\nlong-term, stable and predictable financial support. It \r\nshould focus on helping Africa to develop itself and \r\neliminate poverty, and it should promote and intensify \r\nsupport for the least developed countries. \r\n At the High-level Plenary Meeting on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (see A/65/PV.9), \r\nChinese Premier Wen Jiabao declared that China will \r\ncontinue to promote development to improve the lives \r\nof people in developing countries. It will donate  \r\n$14 million to the Global Fund to fight HIV/AIDS, \r\nTuberculosis and Malaria; further reduce the debt \r\nburden of the least developed countries; deepen \r\nfinancial cooperation with developing countries; \r\n A/65/PV.25\r\n \r\n7 10-56676 \r\n \r\ncontinue to provide substantial support in the form of \r\nconcessional loans and preferential export buyer’s \r\ncredits; and explore and develop financial and \r\neconomic relations and strengthen agricultural \r\ncooperation with developing countries and help them \r\nto develop their human resources. China will continue \r\nto support United Nations efforts to promote the \r\ndevelopment agenda and to make a greater contribution \r\ntowards the early achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals to the benefit of humankind. \r\n Climate change concerns the common interests of \r\nthe entire world and the development interests and \r\nwell-being of the peoples of developing countries. \r\nChina is the most populous developing country in the \r\nworld and still faces many development challenges. \r\nHowever, on the basis of the long-term interests of the \r\nChinese nation and all humankind, the Chinese \r\nGovernment attaches great importance to the issue of \r\nclimate change.  \r\n Currently, the twelfth session of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group on Long-term Cooperative Action \r\nunder the United Nations Framework Convention on \r\nClimate Change and the fourteenth session of the Ad \r\nHoc Working Group on Further Commitments for \r\nAnnex I Parties under the Kyoto Protocol are being \r\nheld in Tianjin, China. This is the last formal \r\nnegotiating conference before Cancún and the first \r\ntime that China has hosted a formal negotiating \r\nconference on climate change within the United \r\nNations framework. In order to promote the successful \r\noutcome of the Cancún conference, China believes that \r\nit is necessary to uphold, first, the basic framework of \r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange, the Kyoto Protocol and the decisions of the \r\nBali Road Map; secondly, the principle of common but \r\ndifferentiated responsibilities; and thirdly, the principle \r\nof sustainable development. We must give full \r\nconsideration to economic development, the \r\neradication of poverty and climate protection; achieve \r\ndevelopment while responding successfully to climate \r\nchange; and ensure respect for the developing \r\ncountries’ right to development.  \r\n Global governance is the main issue facing the \r\nworld’s countries in their common efforts to respond to \r\nthe various new threats and challenges. Global \r\ngovernance should focus on the achievement of \r\ncomprehensive security, common development and \r\nhuman rights protection. It should underpin the \r\nprinciples of equity and justice. All countries — be \r\nthey big or small, strong or weak, poor or rich — have \r\nthe right to participate in the process of governance on \r\nan equal footing. It is necessary to follow the rule of \r\nlaw, proceed on the basis of norms, and uphold the \r\nprinciples and purposes of the United Nations Charter.  \r\n Global governance should advocate the principle \r\nof democracy and a spirit of inclusiveness; promote \r\nnegotiation, cooperation and the peaceful settlement of \r\ninternational disputes; and strive for mutual benefits \r\nand win-win situations. Global governance should \r\nestablish effective multilateral mechanisms, further \r\nmultilateralism, and ensure fairness and efficiency. \r\n As the most universal, representative and \r\nauthoritative intergovernmental international organization, \r\nthe United Nations is the most important arena for the \r\npractice of multilateralism. Secretary-General Ban Ki-\r\nmoon has said that the United Nations remains the \r\nindispensable global institution for the twenty-first \r\ncentury.  \r\n China supports the United Nations in carrying out \r\nnecessary and rational reforms so as to better perform \r\nthe duties entrusted to it under its Charter. United \r\nNations reform should be multidimensional and \r\nmultisectoral. It is particularly necessary to focus on \r\nincreasing development input in areas of concern to \r\ndeveloping countries, to ensure that development \r\nresources strengthen development institutions, and to \r\npromote the timely achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals so as to benefit developing \r\ncountries in general.  \r\n Mr. Kleib (Indonesia): Indonesia welcomes the \r\nreport of the Secretary-General on the work of the \r\nOrganization (A/65/1). We support the efforts of the \r\nSecretary-General to discharge his mandate in full and \r\non time. \r\n The review of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) has just been concluded. Our respective \r\nleaders vividly described the progress made so far. \r\nThey also laid down measures to bridge the gaps. We, \r\nthe community of nations, must therefore re-energize \r\nour determination to achieve the MDGs by 2015.  \r\n Key to that achievement are multilayered \r\npartnerships and a comprehensive approach. We must \r\nalso recall that the 2005 World Summit stressed the \r\nthree robust pillars of the United Nations: human \r\nrights, peace and security, and development and \r\neconomic advancement. The three issues are closely \r\nA/65/PV.25  \r\n \r\n10-56676 8 \r\n \r\ninterlinked; one cannot survive without the other two. \r\nThat trinity of purpose must be kept. \r\n Let me start with the first pillar: human rights and \r\nits related subjects. \r\n The monitoring, protection and promotion of \r\nhuman rights are among the most important \r\nresponsibilities of the United Nations. The global \r\neconomic and food crises have had a devastating \r\nimpact on the promotion of human rights. That \r\ndemonstrates the interlinkage of the three pillars, as I \r\nstipulated earlier. The United Nations must continue in \r\nits efforts to help Member States to integrate human \r\nrights into their development efforts. \r\n Our experience reveals that efforts to implement \r\nhuman rights will fail to bear fruit if there is no \r\nenabling environment. Therefore, it is extremely \r\ncrucial that we establish good governance, strengthen \r\nthe rule of law and reform key democratic institutions. \r\nIndonesia embraces democracy, Islam and \r\nmodernization in the same breath. Surely, the ultimate \r\nbeneficiary of that effort is not Governments, but our \r\nrespective societies. \r\n The review of the Human Rights Council in 2011 \r\nwill give us ample opportunity to further strengthen \r\nthat body. It is pertinent to note that, for the first time, \r\nthe United Nations body dealing with human rights \r\ntruly represents the diversity of the global community. \r\nThat was not the case with its predecessor. \r\n Moreover, Indonesia welcomes the creation of the \r\nUnited Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the \r\nEmpowerment of Women and the appointment of \r\nUnder-Secretary-General Michelle Bachelet as its first \r\nExecutive Director. The key to empowering women is \r\nto give them better opportunities and access to health \r\nand education facilities so that they become the \r\nprincipal agents of change and progress. \r\n The past few years have been marked by \r\nsuccessive massive natural disasters. The capacity of \r\nthe United Nations to deliver international \r\nhumanitarian assistance must therefore be \r\nstrengthened. \r\n Turning to peace and security, Indonesia \r\nfaithfully remains loyal to the ideals set forth in our \r\n1945 Constitution. We are duty-bound to help to \r\nmaintain a world order based on independence, abiding \r\npeace and social justice. There is no better way to do \r\nso than to send our men and women to serve that noble \r\nobjective under the United Nations peacekeeping \r\numbrella. We strongly support the participation of \r\nmore female peacekeepers and the greater participation \r\nof women in peacebuilding. We recognize the \r\ndifficulties and complexities of peacekeeping. The \r\nNew Horizon process will provide for better and \r\nstronger peacekeeping wherever it may be needed in \r\nthe future. \r\n The progress that has been made in the efforts to \r\ncombat terrorism, including the establishment of the \r\nUnited Nations Counter-Terrorism Implementation \r\nTask Force, should not make us complacent. We must \r\nnot let our guard down against that global menace. \r\nThus, the implementation of the United Nations Global \r\nCounter-Terrorism Strategy merits our united support. \r\n The 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \r\nwas truly historic, yet much remains to be done. We are \r\ndisappointed, however, that the Conference on \r\nDisarmament has remained stalled, and we look \r\nforward to its resumption of negotiations on the main \r\nsubstantive issues. \r\n On an issue related to regional peace and that is \r\ndear to us — the Palestinian question — we strongly \r\nsupport the recent resumption of direct negotiations \r\nbetween Palestine and Israel. Regrettably, the \r\npromising talks are now being jeopardized by Israel’s \r\ndecision not to extend the moratorium on the building \r\nof settlements in the occupied territory. The United \r\nNations, in the framework of the Quartet, as well as \r\nother members of the international community, must \r\nrecognize that serious development and take remedial \r\nactions. Indonesia, for its part, will continue to work \r\nwith other members of the international community to \r\nassist the fate of Palestine. \r\n Regarding the last pillar, the report makes \r\ncautious prognoses, with particular reference to the \r\nbeginnings of a global economic recovery following \r\nthe global experiences of the past few years. Indonesia \r\nshares the view that the chances of economic recovery \r\nare high if the need for strong commitment, leadership \r\nand political will on the part of Member States is \r\nfulfilled. \r\n Moreover, climate change remains a major threat \r\nto equitable and sustainable development. Indonesia \r\nlooks forward to the sixteenth session of the \r\nConference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change in Mexico, \r\n A/65/PV.25\r\n \r\n9 10-56676 \r\n \r\nand urges Member States to work towards a consensus \r\nagreement that would address climate change \r\neffectively on the basis of the Copenhagen Accord and \r\nthe progress made in the two working groups for the \r\nfifteenth Conference. \r\n I will conclude with a few remarks on the \r\nOrganization itself. Indonesia firmly believes that \r\nconfronting today’s massive challenges requires \r\nmultilateral action with the United Nations at its \r\ncentre. No single country, big or small, developed or \r\ndeveloping, is equipped to meet those challenges on its \r\nown. Working together is therefore in the interests of \r\nall. The United Nations must continue to enhance \r\ncooperation with vital regional organizations, including \r\nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The \r\nOrganization must also pursue its reform agenda to the \r\nfullest so as to ensure that its organs function at an \r\noptimal level. The General Assembly must be \r\nrevitalized and the Security Council restructured to \r\nreflect current realities. Indonesia, for its part, remains \r\nfully committed to playing its role and cooperating in \r\nthe work of the United Nations as the platform and hub \r\nof a renewed global partnership. \r\n Mrs. Aitimova (Kazakhstan): First, the \r\ndelegation of Kazakhstan would like to thank the \r\nSecretary-General for presenting his comprehensive \r\nreport on the work of the Organization (A/65/1). In our \r\nopinion, it is a good reflection of every aspect of the \r\nOrganization’s hard work. \r\n Over the past year, the world has moved from a \r\nglobal economic depression to the first manifestations \r\nof a global recovery. The Secretary-General is quite \r\nright when he says that “the recovery is fragile and \r\nuneven, and there is no guarantee that a relapse will \r\nnot occur” (A/65/1, para. 1). Unemployment remains \r\nunacceptably high and vulnerable employment \r\ncontinues to rise. Economic volatility, eruptions of \r\nconflict, natural disasters, challenges to food security \r\nand strains on natural resources are unlikely to \r\ndisappear. In this regard, Kazakhstan considers that the \r\nmajor responsibility for making substantial efforts to \r\nstimulate growth and development still lies with the \r\nGovernments of Member States. \r\n We are happy that there are grounds for a new \r\noptimism as we observe several important elements \r\nthat will help guide the United Nations through these \r\nuncertain times. The Organization has a concrete \r\nframework to guide its action: the Millennium \r\nDeclaration (resolution 55/2) and the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). It has significant \r\nresources and knowledge that can help it address the \r\ncurrent challenges, as well as increasingly robust \r\npartnerships with business, civil society and academia \r\nthat can help improve its responses. But these measures \r\ncan be taken only if the United Nations is able to \r\nmobilize the collective global political leadership and \r\nwill. \r\n As was indicated in the outcome document of the \r\nrecent summit on the MDGs (resolution 65/1), over the \r\nnext five years the Organization and its Member States \r\nmust focus on accelerating progress through further \r\nmeasures. These include using innovative financing \r\nand investments in order to support the provision of \r\nglobal public goods, dedicating resources to the \r\npromotion of peace and security, and mobilizing to \r\nmeet humanitarian and human rights needs around the \r\nworld. \r\n Let me focus on gender issues. No one would \r\nargue that, without the full engagement of women, the \r\ninternational system cannot meet the demands made on \r\nit. This year, which marks the fifteenth anniversary of \r\nthe Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and \r\nthe tenth year of the global effort towards the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, the message to \r\nMember States and the Organization is clear: gender \r\nequality and women’s empowerment are indispensable \r\ngoals that the United Nations must champion for the \r\nbenefit of all. \r\n In this regard, we recall that on 2 July the \r\nAssembly endorsed the Secretary-General’s proposal \r\nwith its unanimous adoption of the landmark resolution \r\n64/289 on system-wide coherence, which merged the \r\nfour areas of the United Nations system dealing with \r\nwomen’s issues into one composite, the United Nations \r\nEntity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of \r\nWomen, to be known as UN Women. Kazakhstan \r\nwelcomes the recent appointment of an Under-\r\nSecretary-General to head the new body and the \r\nestablishment of an Executive Board to provide \r\nintergovernmental support for and supervision of its \r\noperations. \r\n We consider these developments to be among the \r\nmost remarkable achievements of United Nations \r\nreform in the past year. In 2010, the Secretary-General \r\nhas encouraged the United Nations to lend its full \r\nsupport to programmes that empower women and \r\nA/65/PV.25  \r\n \r\n10-56676 10 \r\n \r\nprotect them from discriminatory practices and \r\nviolence. And, of course, the leadership of Member \r\nStates is essential. \r\n Over the past decade, the international \r\ncommunity has made considerable progress towards \r\nreducing poverty, promoting sustainable development, \r\nsecuring peace and stability, and promoting women’s \r\nempowerment. As the Organization and its Member \r\nStates look to the next decade, they should be even \r\nmore ambitious. And we share the optimism expressed \r\nby the Secretary-General in his report. Indeed, it is \r\nonly by working together that we can strengthen the \r\nOrganization so that it can be a driving force for \r\nmultilateral action and fulfil the commitments made in \r\nSeptember. \r\n Five years from the target date of 2015 agreed for \r\nachieving the MDGs, success is still within reach but \r\nnot guaranteed. The Organization and its Member \r\nStates have made a great push forward, yet progress is \r\nuneven, gaps are wide and new challenges have yet to \r\nbe met. The intensified efforts of every Member \r\ncountry are needed urgently in order for us to \r\naccelerate our pace towards achieving the Goals. This \r\nAssembly has a mandate to facilitate the acceleration \r\nof progress towards the MDGs. Kazakhstan is ready to \r\ncontribute actively to this process and to set an \r\nexample that can prove that the Millennium Goals are \r\nachievable. \r\n The year 2010 is an important one for meeting \r\nthe promises that the United Nations and the \r\ninternational community have made to those most in \r\nneed around the world. By identifying and embracing \r\nthe MDGs, Member States have put human \r\ndevelopment at centre stage and resolved to spare no \r\neffort to transform our world into a safer and more \r\nequitable, sustainable and prosperous place. \r\n We are proud that this year, for the first time, the \r\nworld community celebrated 29 August as the \r\nInternational Day against Nuclear Tests, initiated by \r\nPresident Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan. \r\nUnanimous support for resolution 64/35 effectively \r\nreaffirmed the international community’s commitment \r\nto the process of reducing the nuclear threat. I take this \r\nopportunity to once again thank Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon, who started his visit to my country last April \r\nwith a tour of the former Semipalatinsk nuclear test \r\nsite. We remember that, standing on the former ground \r\nzero, he urged the international community to redouble \r\nits efforts to achieve a world free from nuclear threats. \r\n We are following a number of important changes \r\ninitiated by the Secretary-General in human resources \r\npolicy, budget planning and the accountability \r\nframework, with a view to strengthening the \r\nOrganization. Important progress has also been made \r\non system-wide coherence and the further \r\nstrengthening of the Organization’s cooperation with \r\nregional organizations. We also take note of efforts \r\nmade by the Secretary-General, as he continues to \r\nimplement his human resources reform agenda, \r\nincluding by reducing the various types of employment \r\ncontracts, harmonizing conditions of service between \r\nstaff in the field and those at Headquarters, and \r\nlaunching a new talent management system to \r\nmodernize recruitment, performance management and \r\nstaff learning and development.  \r\n In conclusion, I would like to reaffirm that \r\nKazakhstan supports the ongoing efforts of the United \r\nNations Secretariat aimed at creating a stronger United \r\nNations and at forging strong working relationships \r\nwith a variety of stakeholders, including regional \r\norganizations and civil society. For that reason, \r\noutreach and the building of partnerships are important \r\nelements of the Organization’s activity. \r\n Mr. Tommo Monthe (Cameroon) (spoke in \r\nFrench): First of all, I would like to reiterate to the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth \r\nsession, Mr. Joseph Deiss, the sincere congratulations \r\nand support that President Paul Biya conveyed to him \r\non behalf of Cameroon from this rostrum on his \r\nelection as President. The same applies to his \r\npredecessor, Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki of Libya, as \r\nwell as to the Secretary-General of the Organization, \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon. \r\n Once again, it is a pleasure for me to commend \r\nthe Secretary-General for the quality of his report on \r\nthe activity of the Organization, published as document \r\nA/65/1 and submitted under agenda item 108 (see \r\nA/65/251). The report provides us with supplementary \r\ninformation about the vision and the expectations of \r\nthe United Nations, as well as the role of Member \r\nStates, so that the international community can meet \r\nthe challenges that continue to affect us, namely, a \r\nglobal economy that shows the signs of a recovery that \r\nis still fragile and unequal, unemployment that is still \r\nhigh, ongoing conflicts in some areas of the world, \r\n A/65/PV.25\r\n \r\n11 10-56676 \r\n \r\nnatural disasters, problems of food security, ongoing \r\npressure on natural resources, the impact of climate \r\nchange, and so on.  \r\n In that regard, first and foremost as regards \r\ndevelopment issues, my delegation agrees with the \r\nSecretary-General that the Millennium Declaration and \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) (see \r\nresolution 55/2), if they are indeed implemented, will \r\nguide the work of the United Nations, if there is more \r\npolitical will from the Member States. The High-level \r\nPlenary Meeting, which took place here from 20 to  \r\n22 September and where my country was represented \r\nat the highest level, is a good illustration of that fact. \r\nIndeed, that meeting provided the United Nations and \r\nits Members with the opportunity to reaffirm their \r\ncommitment to speed up the achievement of the MDGs \r\nby 2015.  \r\n For its part, the vision of Cameroon on the \r\nMDGs, as presented on that occasion by the President \r\nof the Republic, His Excellency Mr. Paul Biya, focuses \r\non three main factors, namely the implementation of \r\nGoal 8 on creating a global partnership for \r\ndevelopment, access to energy and job creation.  \r\n Cameroon is indeed convinced that the \r\ncomplementarity between the MDGs should not cause \r\nus to lose sight of the fact that there is one among them \r\nthat conditions the implementation of all the others, \r\nnamely, Goal 8, because efforts to mobilize resources \r\nfor development require the establishment of a fairer \r\nfinancial and economic system, a comprehensive \r\ntreatment of the debt issue and a flow of official \r\ndevelopment assistance that is stable, predictable and \r\neffective, as well as access to essential medications. \r\n The second key factor for the implementation of \r\nMDGs is access to energy, because that facilitates an \r\nincrease in both agricultural production and water \r\nsupply, as well as the blossoming of activities that \r\ngenerate income. \r\n The third important factor is to solve the crisis in \r\nemployment, in particular the employment of youth, \r\nwho represent the main part of our population. \r\nCameroon welcomes the results that the High-level \r\nPlenary Meeting achieved on the MDGs, as long as the \r\ninternational community implements the commitments \r\nset forth in the outcome document. \r\n Indeed, regarding official development \r\nassistance, the heads of State and Government \r\nundertook to give great attention to respecting all \r\ncommitments, including the commitment under which \r\nmany countries by 2015 have committed to allocate 0.7 \r\nper cent of the gross domestic product to official \r\ndevelopment assistance and in 2010 to achieve the \r\ninterim objective of 0.5 per cent. They have also \r\npromised to study the possibility of using innovative \r\nfinancing mechanisms, such as taxing financial \r\ntransactions. \r\n As regards international trade, the heads of State \r\nand Government affirmed their support for a universal \r\nmultilateral trade system, rejecting protectionism and \r\nsubsidies for agricultural product exports. They also \r\nreaffirmed that States have the right to fully use the \r\nprovisions of the World Trade Organization agreement \r\non trade regarding universal access to medication.  \r\n Regarding the issue of the debt, the heads of State \r\nand Government said that they wanted to facilitate its \r\nfinancing and alleviation and that they planned to set \r\nup improved structures for restructuring sovereign \r\ndebt. If those commitments are kept within the \r\ndeadlines set, they would most certainly support and \r\nstrengthen the efforts that have already been \r\nundertaken by each of our countries. \r\n The Cameroon Government itself has already \r\nundertaken to implement a strategy document for \r\ngrowth and employment that focuses on the \r\ndevelopment of the productive sectors and \r\ninfrastructure, without which it would be impossible to \r\nsee an improvement in living conditions for people. \r\nOther efforts have also been undertaken, including \r\npursuit of fiscal reforms to act as an incentive and \r\nimprovement of the business climate, in order to have \r\ngreater mobilization of domestic savings and to attract \r\nmore foreign direct investment and increase the \r\nabsorption capacity of external debt. \r\n Regarding Africa’s particular needs, in paragraph \r\n35 of the report, the Secretary-General rightly \r\nunderscores that,  \r\n  “Africa’s people need neither pity nor \r\ncharity; they need the tools to create jobs and \r\ngenerate incomes. Developed countries should \r\nmake good on promises made repeatedly at \r\nsummit meetings of the Group of Eight and the \r\nGroup of 20, and at the United Nations, to double \r\naid to Africa.” (A/65/1, para. 35) \r\nA/65/PV.25  \r\n \r\n10-56676 12 \r\n \r\n Of course, we welcome the role played by the \r\nAfrica Steering Group set up by the Secretary-General, \r\nwhich has laid out the way forward for the \r\ninternational community in terms of helping Africa \r\nachieve the MDGs in areas of strategic interest, such as \r\nhealth, education, agriculture, infrastructure and trade. \r\nThe impact of this will, nonetheless, be limited, if the \r\nmain donors of official development assistance do not \r\nrespect their commitments.  \r\n Here, the African Union quite rightly notes that, \r\nwhile Africa has made remarkable progress in \r\nachieving the MDGs, the pace and quality of the \r\nachievements allows us to be only somewhat pleased, \r\nat best, with the results. \r\n Allow me to comment briefly on another \r\nimportant pillar of the work of this Organization, one \r\nthat is mentioned in paragraphs 37 through 73 of the \r\nSecretary-General’s report, namely, peace and security. \r\nThe report shows that, over the past year, this \r\nOrganization has continued to work on the ground, in \r\nparticular in Africa. This involvement has led it to \r\nemploy every means at its disposal for intervention, \r\nfrom conflict prevention to peacekeeping missions to \r\nsupport for peacebuilding.  \r\n With the modest means at its disposal, Cameroon \r\nhas continued to be involved by making available and \r\ndeploying military observers and police forces in \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping missions in Burundi, \r\nCôte d’Ivoire and Darfur, on the borders of Chad and \r\nthe Central African Republic, in the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo and in Haiti.  \r\n My country welcomes the progress made in \r\nvarious places, thanks to the work or the assistance of \r\nthe United Nations. Indeed, we commend the progress \r\nmade in Côte d’Ivoire in implementing the \r\nOuagadougou agreements and in peacebuilding there. \r\nIn Burundi, the process is also moving forward, with \r\nthe holding of elections, thus moving the country from \r\nthe peacekeeping phase to the peacebuilding phase. In \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo too, the United \r\nNations Mission has turned into a stabilization mission. \r\nIn Haiti, we are moving towards stabilization, despite \r\nthe delays caused by the 12 January 2010 earthquake.  \r\n We are, of course, aware of the fact that the \r\navailable resources are not keeping pace with the \r\nconstant increase in deployments, let alone the \r\ndiversity and complexity of mission mandates. This is \r\nwhy we encourage the Secretary-General to continue \r\nhis consideration of this issue, in collaboration with \r\nMember States, as part of the New Horizons initiative, \r\nin order to find solutions to those problems. For its \r\npart, my country supports the implementation of that \r\nprogramme, which has repeatedly received widespread \r\nsupport from many Member States, both in the Security \r\nCouncil and in the General Assembly. \r\n The need to reform United Nations peacekeeping \r\nleads me to speak, in conclusion, about the need to \r\nreform the Organization and the system in its entirety, \r\ngiven the human tragedies we face, in particular in \r\nAfrica, with regard to both development and peace. \r\nThe central role of the United Nations in global \r\ngovernance is an undeniable fact. It is clear that, faced \r\nwith the challenges that confront us, the United \r\nNations is undertaking praiseworthy efforts. But, in \r\norder to fully guarantee the effectiveness of its work, \r\nthe Organization must receive the resources that it \r\nneeds from all its Members. To do so, it must always \r\nreflect our common desires and remain the crucible of \r\nmultilateralism and of the democratization of \r\ninternational relations.  \r\n In that regard and in terms of the issue of \r\ndevelopment, the desire for increased solidarity and for \r\nan overhaul of the international system aimed at \r\nachieving a fairer trade and financial system must be \r\nheard. This is where the work that the United Nations \r\nwill pursue with the Group of 20 and Group of Eight is \r\ncause for hope.  \r\n As regards the United Nations itself, the often-\r\nmentioned need for Security Council reform, which \r\nshould enable Africa to have a permanent presence \r\nthere, requires us to take determined action. That \r\nwould be a good course of action for an Organization \r\nthat, ultimately, is the mediator of our higher interests, \r\nwith peace, security and the well-being of each and \r\nevery person at the forefront of those interests. \r\n Mr. Hardeep Singh Puri (India): I wish to thank \r\nthe Secretary-General for his annual report on the work \r\nof the Organization (A/65/1). \r\n The commitments that we undertook in 2000, \r\nenshrined in the Millennium Declaration, were \r\nrenewed by our leaders two weeks ago at the High-\r\nlevel Plenary Meeting on the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). As we take stock of the MDGs, it is \r\nevident that the progress reported by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on various fronts, such as poverty reduction, \r\nprimary education enrolment, narrowing the gender \r\n A/65/PV.25\r\n \r\n13 10-56676 \r\n \r\ngap in education and access to clean water, is tempered \r\nby the uneven reach and significant gaps that persist in \r\nall the MDG categories, in particular the health-related \r\nMDGs. \r\n Never before in the 65 years of the existence of \r\nthe United Nations has there been such a groundswell \r\nof global support for taking development to the poorest \r\nand the most vulnerable among us, the overwhelming \r\nmajority of whom are found in developing countries. \r\nNever before has there been a clearer picture of what \r\nneeds to be done to address the many dimensions of \r\npoverty and inequality and to build a global partnership \r\nfor development. \r\n It is, therefore, imperative that we ensure that our \r\ncollective commitments are achieved in the agreed \r\ntime frame. While countries bear the primary \r\nresponsibility for their own development strategies and \r\ngoals, there is no denying that resource constraints \r\npose a significant impediment to progress in achieving \r\nthe MDGs. The global partnership on financing for \r\ndevelopment is crucial to ensuring that the developing \r\ncountries can meet their MDG targets, particularly as \r\nthey relate to the special needs of Africa and the least \r\ndeveloped countries, small island developing States \r\nand landlocked least developed countries. They must \r\ncontinue to receive priority attention. \r\n We could not agree more with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that the achievement of the MDGs requires \r\nunswerving commitment, proactive engagement and \r\ncollective global political leadership and will. It is time \r\nnow for the high words to translate into action. \r\n India shares the priority placed by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on climate change. We are aware of the \r\nconsequences it has for vulnerable communities and \r\nregions in our countries. We welcome his initiative on \r\na High-level Advisory Group on Climate Change \r\nFinancing and a High-level Panel on Global \r\nSustainability. India will participate constructively in \r\nefforts to achieve an ambitious and equitable outcome \r\nin the negotiations on the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change. \r\n While the Secretary-General’s report captures the \r\npriorities that have engaged the Organization and its \r\nmembership, as well as the progress achieved on a \r\nnumber of fronts, we are struck by the singular lack of \r\nmention of the important progress made in advancing \r\nthe agenda of Security Council reform. The launch of \r\ntext-based negotiations and the overwhelming and \r\nemphatic support extended by the membership of the \r\nUnited Nations for expansion in both the permanent \r\nand non-permanent categories of the Security Council \r\ncannot go unacknowledged and needs to be properly \r\nrecorded. \r\n Intergovernmental negotiations on Security \r\nCouncil reforms acquired a positive momentum in the \r\nsixty-fourth session, with a decision by the membership \r\nto “immediately continue intergovernmental negotiations \r\non Security Council reform” (decision 64/568, para. (a)) \r\non the basis of the negotiation text. The Organization’s \r\nsuccess in meeting the diverse and complex challenges \r\nit faces is to a great extent based on our willingness to \r\naccept and undertake the crying need for reform of the \r\nprincipal organs of the United Nations, in particular the \r\nSecurity Council. It is our firm belief that the \r\neffectiveness and relevance of the multilateral \r\nendeavour that constitutes the United Nations and its \r\nactivities diminishes every day that we delay \r\nimplementing real reforms of its governance \r\narchitecture. \r\n I also draw attention to the progress made in the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly. Its pre-eminent \r\nrole as the chief deliberative, policy-making and \r\nrepresentative organ of the United Nations should be \r\nrespected in letter and in spirit. The Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup on the revitalization of the General Assembly \r\ndid commendable work during the previous session. In \r\nthat connection, we welcome the adoption of consensus \r\nresolution 64/301 on the subject based on the \r\nconclusions in the report of the Ad Hoc Working Group \r\n(A/64/903). A number of forward-looking provisions \r\nwere agreed on, including those relating to enhancing \r\nthe Assembly’s role in the selection and appointment of \r\nthe Secretary-General, enhancing the role of the \r\nAssembly in the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security, strengthening the institution of the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly and improving the \r\nquality of reporting by the Security Council to the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n Terrorism poses a grave threat to all States and \r\nsocieties. It is a global threat that requires a \r\ncoordinated and concerted global response to combat \r\nit. In this regard, India believes that the adoption of a \r\ncomprehensive convention against international \r\nterrorism, which has been under negotiation for over \r\n15 years, would provide a solid legal basis for the fight \r\nagainst terrorism. We therefore welcome the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s assertion in his report on measures to \r\nA/65/PV.25  \r\n \r\n10-56676 14 \r\n \r\neliminate international terrorism (A/65/175) that \r\ncomprehensive implementation of the United Nations \r\nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy cannot be complete \r\nwithout the conclusion of the comprehensive \r\nconvention on international terrorism. \r\n Ongoing efforts, such as the recent second \r\nbiennial review of the United Nations Global Counter-\r\nTerrorism Strategy, institutionalization of the Counter-\r\nTerrorism Implementation Task Force and the \r\nstrengthening of the sanctions regime created by \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1267 (1999) are steps in \r\nthe right direction. India will continue its active \r\ninvolvement in all the counter-terrorism efforts of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n Peacekeeping continues to be the most visible \r\ncontribution of the United Nations towards the \r\nmaintenance of peace and stability in conflict-torn \r\nregions around the world. As one of the largest \r\ncontributors to peacekeeping operations, both in terms \r\nof troops and resources, we support efforts by the \r\nSecretary-General to strengthen the capability of the \r\nOrganization to keep peace in increasingly complex \r\nsituations. The challenge is to ensure that field \r\nmissions are equipped with adequate resources and \r\nexpertise to satisfactorily execute peacekeeping \r\nmandates. \r\n My delegation is following with close interest the \r\nSecretary-General’s efforts to enhance the Secretariat’s \r\nability to support peacekeeping operations. In that \r\nregard, we expect the Secretariat to closely consult \r\nwith us and other troop-contributing countries in \r\nfurther taking forward the global field support strategy \r\nthat was unveiled last year. \r\n India remains acutely conscious that \r\npeacekeeping cannot be a substitute for the task of \r\nnation-building and peacebuilding. The Government of \r\nIndia is committed to the principle and practice of \r\npeacebuilding. We have been actively involved in the \r\nprocess of the ongoing review of the peacebuilding \r\narchitecture that is centred on the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission and its instrumentalities. There have been \r\na number of innovative mechanisms put in place to \r\nbolster United Nations peacebuilding efforts, including \r\ncollaboration with the World Bank, expanding the \r\nfootprint of post-conflict consolidation through \r\nenhancing civilian capacities, maximizing the positive \r\nrole that women can play in peacebuilding and \r\nstrengthening the catalytic role of the Peacebuilding \r\nFund. We support those innovations. We would further \r\nlike to stress the imperative of national ownership and \r\nthe anchoring of international peacebuilding efforts at \r\nthe country level. \r\n We are encouraged by the positive signs of an \r\ninvigorated international debate on global disarmament \r\nin 2010. India attaches the highest priority to the goal \r\nof universal nuclear disarmament and has an \r\nimpeccable non-proliferation record. Nuclear \r\ndisarmament and nuclear non-proliferation are \r\nmutually reinforcing processes, and they require \r\nconcerted and cooperative international efforts. We \r\nwould like to express our appreciation for the \r\nSecretary-General’s initiative to convene the High-\r\nlevel Meeting on Revitalizing the Work of the \r\nConference on Disarmament and Taking Forward \r\nMultilateral Disarmament Negotiations. We believe \r\nthat it has rightfully sent a clear message of support for \r\nthe Conference on Disarmament as the single \r\nmultilateral disarmament negotiating forum and that it \r\nprovides political impetus to the multilateral \r\ndisarmament agenda. \r\n We appreciate the efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in advocating the principles of promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights and the rule of law. We also \r\nrecognize their synergistic link with human welfare \r\nand socio-economic development, including the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nThe review exercise of the Human Rights Council \r\nshould explore ways to preserve transparency and \r\ninclusiveness and to ensure that, while urgent human \r\nrights situations are addressed, duplication and overlap \r\nare avoided. The Council should also streamline the \r\nnumber of resolutions put forward in each session, \r\nrationalize its work and the mandates of its special \r\nprocedures, without in any way undermining our \r\ncommitment to human rights and make the dialogue \r\nbetween the Council and Member States genuinely \r\ninteractive. \r\n The institutional strengthening of the \r\nOrganization to better enable it to deliver on its vision \r\nand mandate received a boost with the adoption of \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 64/289 on system-wide \r\ncoherence. India particularly welcomes the landmark \r\ndecision to create a unified gender entity, UN Women. \r\nWe look forward to the early operationalization of the \r\nentity and welcome the appointment of Michelle \r\nBachelet as the first Executive Director and Under-\r\nSecretary-General for UN Women. \r\n A/65/PV.25\r\n \r\n15 10-56676 \r\n \r\n In closing, I pledge my delegation’s full support \r\nfor efforts to achieve the important goals we have set \r\nfor ourselves and take forward the important mandates \r\nentrusted to the Organization. We look forward to \r\nbuilding on the positive momentum from last year on \r\ncrucial issues and working towards meaningful and \r\nresult-oriented discussions on the various items on the \r\nagenda of the General Assembly. \r\n Mrs. Dunlop (Brazil): I thank Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon for his report on the work of the \r\nOrganization (A/65/1). It presents the activities of the \r\nUnited Nations during a period in which the world’s \r\ndemands of and expectations for the Organization were \r\nvery high. We appreciated the continued efforts of the \r\nSecretary-General and the Secretariat to help Member \r\nStates meet such expectations and respond to those \r\ndemands. \r\n More than ever, multilateralism is a political and \r\npractical imperative. Dealing with the many global \r\nchallenges with which we are confronted requires \r\nenhanced cooperation and decision-making processes \r\nthat are more participatory. In some areas, the \r\ntraditional players have already understood that. In \r\nothers, there is still resistance to sharing power and \r\nresponsibilities. We must all constantly work to \r\nstrengthen the General Assembly with concrete \r\ninitiatives. Just as importantly, the Security Council \r\nmust be reformed and expanded to allow for greater \r\nparticipation on the part of developing countries, \r\nincluding as permanent members. \r\n Africa is — and rightly so — a key priority in the \r\nvarious fields of the work of the United Nations. Such \r\na priority should be permanently translated into \r\nspecific initiatives. The continent occupies a very \r\nspecial place in Brazilian diplomacy. Through trade \r\nand investment, we are joining forces with several \r\nAfrican Governments to develop the enormous \r\npotential of the continent and reduce its dependency on \r\nforeign assistance. This year, in which a significant \r\nnumber of African nations are celebrating the fiftieth \r\nanniversary of their decolonization, Brazil is renewing \r\nits commitment to an independent, prosperous, just and \r\ndemocratic Africa. \r\n Among the many activities undertaken by the \r\nOrganization, those in the social domain deserve \r\nparticular attention. The Millennium Declaration \r\n(resolution 55/2) and the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) are key guides to our collective \r\nendeavours. Brazil is proud to have achieved almost all \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals and to be well \r\non the way to meeting them all by 2015. We consider, \r\nhowever, that achieving the MDGs will not be possible \r\nwithout the allocation of significant additional \r\nfinancial resources in a stable and predictable manner, \r\nparticularly to the poorest countries among us. All \r\nMember States must fulfil their international \r\nobligations in this regard. The inability of a country to \r\nreach those Goals is a responsibility to be shared by the \r\ninternational community, as the promotion of \r\ndevelopment is a task for us all. \r\n Reaching a global, comprehensive and ambitious \r\nagreement on climate change remains a major \r\nchallenge that requires actions commensurate with our \r\ncommon but differentiated responsibilities and \r\nrespective capabilities. Brazil and other developing \r\ncountries are doing their part. A positive outcome from \r\nthe sixteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to \r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange, with tangible progress on forests, financing \r\nfor adaptation and mitigation, access to technologies \r\nand the reaffirmation of the Kyoto commitments is \r\nparamount. As Minister for Foreign Affairs Celso \r\nAmorim stated here in his intervention during the \r\ngeneral debate, the Mexican presidency can count on \r\nBrazil’s engagement to achieve this objective. \r\n Human rights are a basic pillar of the United \r\nNations and a central part of its work. Brazil’s \r\ncommitment to the promotion of human rights is \r\nunwavering. The Human Rights Council must continue \r\nto operate in a non-selective and constructive manner, \r\nespecially through the Universal Periodic Review, \r\nwhile maintaining the capacity to address situations of \r\nparticular concern. In our view, human rights are most \r\neffectively ensured by dialogue and cooperation. \r\n We welcome the establishment of the United \r\nNations Entity for Gender Equality and the \r\nEmpowerment of Women (UN Women). Brazil is ready \r\nto work with President Michelle Bachelet and Member \r\nStates to further advance gender equality and the \r\nempowerment of women. As the Secretary-General has \r\nstated, “by empowering women, we empower \r\nsocieties”.  \r\n The year 2010 will be remembered as the year \r\nthat the capacity of the international community to \r\nrespond to humanitarian emergencies was put to the \r\ntest. From Haiti to Pakistan, we have seen genuine \r\nA/65/PV.25  \r\n \r\n10-56676 16 \r\n \r\nsuccess stories, but also witnessed the limits of current \r\nmechanisms when facing calamities of biblical \r\nproportions. It is imperative that we redouble our \r\nefforts in order to ensure timely life-saving assistance \r\nto those in need, as well as the means to promote the \r\ntransition to recovery and development. With regard to \r\nHaiti in particular, we believe that the holding of the \r\nInternational Donors Conference Towards a New \r\nFuture for Haiti was an important example of the \r\nOrganization’s aid to a country devastated by a natural \r\ndisaster. For such a response to be effective, however, \r\nit is imperative that donors live up to their pledges in a \r\ntimely manner. \r\n United Nations peacekeeping continues to be one \r\nof the most crucial aspects of the Organization’s work \r\nfor millions of people around the world. We strongly \r\nsupport the continued partnership among the troop- and \r\npolice-contributing countries, the General Assembly, \r\nthe Security Council and the Secretariat to make \r\npeacekeeping more effective. In the coming year, we \r\nhope to see continued progress in areas such as the \r\nlinkage between peacekeeping and peacebuilding, \r\ninteraction with local populations and the protection of \r\ncivilians. One challenge of particular importance today \r\nis how to address the complex problems of security and \r\ndevelopment in ways that are distinct and yet mutually \r\nreinforcing. This is not simple, but absolutely must be \r\ndone. \r\n In order to achieve a truly secure world, the \r\npromise of the total elimination of nuclear weapons \r\nmust be fulfilled. Unilateral reductions are welcome \r\nbut insufficient, especially when they occur in tandem \r\nwith the modernization of nuclear arsenals. There is a \r\nclear and inextricable link between disarmament and \r\nnon-proliferation. They are mutually reinforcing \r\nprocesses, in which the best guarantee against nuclear \r\nproliferation is nuclear disarmament. We strongly \r\nsupport the rejuvenation of the Conference on \r\nDisarmament. The balance between the three pillars of \r\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons must be maintained. \r\n Our times are surely challenging, but are also \r\nvery promising. The world is changing and it can be \r\nmade a better place. The United Nations is and must \r\nremain a valuable instrument to help us achieve that \r\nshared goal. Brazil renews its full commitment to the \r\nOrganization. \r\n Mrs. Kolontai (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): The \r\ndelegation of Belarus welcomes the conceptual \r\napproach of the Secretary-General’s report (A/65/1) to \r\nsolving topical issues on the international agenda, in \r\nparticular in the context of implementing commitments \r\nto achieve the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). \r\n We support additional measures to establish \r\ninnovative financing and investment mechanisms and \r\nto provide resources to strengthen peace and security \r\nand to meet humanitarian needs and uphold human \r\nrights. \r\n We share the view of the Secretary-General on the \r\nmain mechanism for implementing this approach — \r\nmultilateralism and partnerships, to which there exists \r\nno alternative. \r\n An excellent example of the partnership policy \r\nplaying out in practice in the United Nations is the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s consensus adoption, at its sixty-\r\nfourth session, of the Global Plan of Action to Combat \r\nTrafficking in Persons (resolution 64/293). We all have \r\npainstaking work to do together to ensure the full and \r\neffective implementation of this comprehensive \r\ndocument. \r\n A few days ago, from this rostrum, the Belarusian \r\ndelegation put forward a new idea in the area of global \r\npartnership aimed at supporting talented young people \r\nand protecting the younger generation from social \r\ndecline. We hope that Member States will respond to \r\nBelarus’s initiative and support the holding of thematic \r\ndebates in the Assembly on the issue. \r\n The current global economic instability \r\ndemonstrates the need for taking measures to establish \r\na sustainable economy. One pillar of such an economy, \r\nalong with other sectors, should be the energy sector, \r\nbased on the exploitation of new and renewable power \r\nsources. We are convinced that work in the area of \r\nenergy could facilitate the establishment of a \r\ncomprehensive energy agenda for the United Nations. \r\nWe note the contribution of the Secretariat to finding \r\nsolutions to the problem of energy supply. In that \r\nregard, we commend the conclusions and \r\nrecommendations of the Secretary-General’s Advisory \r\nGroup on Energy and Climate Change, particularly \r\nregarding the provision of access to modern energy \r\ntechnologies. We expect the United Nations to continue \r\nits assistance in establishing a global partnership in the \r\nenergy sector, with special attention to the transfer of \r\n A/65/PV.25\r\n \r\n17 10-56676 \r\n \r\nmodern energy technologies. Belarus is ready to make \r\nits contribution to this effort, and has already set up an \r\ninternational laboratory on renewable energy sources, \r\nbased at the Institute for Energy of the National \r\nAcademy of Sciences. \r\n Belarus is interested in the successful outcome of \r\nthe negotiations on climate change. The modest \r\nachievements of the Copenhagen Conference are a \r\nconvincing demonstration of the necessity of taking \r\nspecific measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \r\nEfforts by Belarus for several years to ensure the entry \r\ninto force of its amendment to Annex B of the Kyoto \r\nProtocol to the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change — and thus to make its \r\ncontribution to the overall protection of the climate — \r\nhave unfortunately so far been unsuccessful. In that \r\nregard, however, we note the support of China, Egypt, \r\nIsrael, Kyrgyzstan, Mauritius, Morocco, the Republic \r\nof Korea and Ukraine, which all approved the Belarus \r\namendment during the Assembly’s sixty-fourth session. \r\nWe believe that the Secretary-General’s authoritative \r\nposition as depositary of the Convention and Kyoto \r\nProtocol will play a decisive role in accelerating the \r\napproval process of the Belarus amendment. \r\n In the context of United Nations assistance to \r\nMember States beset by natural and man-made \r\ndisasters, we note that the impact of the Chernobyl \r\ncatastrophe is still being felt today, 25 years after the \r\naccident. We are convinced that the successful \r\nmitigation of the results of the Chernobyl explosion is \r\nin the interests of the entire international community. \r\nIn that regard, we call for the Assembly’s support for \r\nthe draft resolution on Chernobyl. \r\n We recognize the positive effect of measures \r\ntaken by the United Nations to improve the social and \r\neconomic situation in the world. We note, however, \r\nthat implementing such measures is impossible without \r\nenhancing the economic capacity and political role of \r\nmiddle-income countries, which can make an important \r\ncontribution to the stable growth of the world’s \r\neconomy. Belarus therefore requests the United \r\nNations to undertake a more productive modernization \r\nof its working methods, first and foremost by ensuring \r\nits economic and social effectiveness. \r\n We commend the leading role of the Economic \r\nand Social Council, which has a key part to play as \r\ncoordinator in this area. At the same time, we consider \r\nthat more attention should be paid to the work of \r\nintergovernmental mechanisms, in particular the \r\nEconomic and Social Council’s Development \r\nCooperation Forum. Participation in the Forum by \r\ninterested parties, including the private sector, will \r\nenable it to deal with many thorny issues, including the \r\nachievement of the MDGs. National voluntary \r\npresentations at the Council’s high-level segment are \r\nanother important tool for sharing experience and \r\nfostering coordination. Belarus will submit its national \r\nreport at the annual Economic and Social Council \r\nsession in 2011. \r\n The achievement of the MDGs is an international \r\nissue. However, the main responsibility for it lies with \r\nnational Governments. The Belarusian Government’s \r\nstrong social policies have meant that over the past 10 \r\nyears our country has seen a threefold increase in \r\nincome, an eightfold decrease in those living below the \r\npoverty line and a threefold drop in the unemployment \r\nrate. Our maternal and child mortality levels are \r\napproaching those of developed countries, and the \r\nproportion of women in Parliament now exceeds 30 per \r\ncent. Belarus has thus already attained most of the \r\nMDGs and intends to achieve the rest by 2015. \r\n In its progress towards achieving the MDGs, \r\nBelarus has demonstrated in practice its commitment to \r\nhuman rights. In that regard, we note the observation in \r\nthe Secretary-General’s report that the protection of \r\nhuman rights should be an integral part of efforts by \r\nMember States in the area of development. \r\n Belarus is in agreement with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s opinion that 2010 has been a significant year \r\nfor work in the area of disarmament and  \r\nnon-proliferation. The year was marked by a number of \r\ninternational activities relating to disarmament. The \r\noutcome of those meetings demonstrates that of all the \r\nmany issues linked to international security, the topic \r\nof nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation is still \r\nvery pertinent. The May Review Conference of the \r\nParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons showed the importance of \r\nmaintaining and strengthening this international \r\ninstrument. We hope that the outcome document of the \r\nConference (NPT/CONF.2010/50), which includes, \r\namong other things, a specific list of future actions, \r\nwill be a productive basis for the work of Treaty \r\nmember States to achieve the Treaty’s aims swiftly. We \r\nbelieve that providing non-nuclear-weapon States with \r\nnegative security assurances based on a legally binding \r\nA/65/PV.25  \r\n \r\n10-56676 18 \r\n \r\ndocument will significantly shore up the non-proliferation \r\nregime. \r\n Belarus welcomes United Nations efforts to \r\ncounter the illicit and uncontrolled proliferation of \r\nsmall arms and light weapons. We hope that this area \r\nwill remain an important part of the Organization’s \r\nwork on the disarmament track. We were pleased to \r\nhear of the Secretary-General’s efforts to revitalize the \r\nwork of the Conference on Disarmament. Belarus \r\nsupports the convening of a fourth special session of \r\nthe General Assembly on disarmament, during which \r\nimportant issues with regard to revitalizing the \r\nConference could be reviewed. We hope that this \r\nimportant negotiating body will soon emerge from \r\ncrisis and renew its substantive work. \r\n Belarus has consistently held to the opinion that \r\nthe successful implementation of the Global Counter-\r\nTerrorism Strategy depends on a reliable international \r\nlegal basis for action by States in the fight against \r\nterrorism. We believe that the General Assembly — \r\nwithout substituting for the Security Council — can \r\nmake a significant contribution to the efforts of the \r\ninternational community to combat terrorism by the \r\nspeedy completion of its work on a comprehensive \r\nconvention on terrorism. Belarus is prepared for \r\nconstructive discussions on proposals for the \r\ncompletion of the final draft of the convention. We also \r\nunderscore the importance of technical assistance \r\nprovided by bodies such as the Counter-Terrorism \r\nCommittee, the United Nations Office on Drugs and \r\nCrime, the International Atomic Energy Agency, \r\nInterpol and other organizations. \r\n Belarus welcomes the establishment of the \r\ncomposite United Nations Entity for Gender Equality \r\nand the Empowerment of Women, as well as new \r\napproaches to regulate operational activities and other \r\nimportant elements included in resolution 64/289, on \r\nsystem-wide coherence. Unfortunately, it would seem \r\nthat that is the only clear example of successful reform \r\nof the United Nations. We therefore call on the \r\nSecretary-General to continue efforts in that area. We \r\nbelieve that our combined efforts on revitalizing the \r\nwork of the General Assembly should be given high \r\npriority. \r\n Mr. Rosenthal (Guatemala) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nWe thank the Secretary-General for presenting his \r\nreport on the work of the Organization (A/65/1) during \r\nthe past year as we initiate this sixty-fifth session of \r\nthe General Assembly. We find the report to be \r\ncomplete and balanced, and, above all, it has \r\nsuggestions regarding the major challenges that the \r\nUnited Nations faces in meeting our expectations in an \r\ninternational context characterized by more shadows \r\nthan light.  \r\n The Secretary-General has proposed that those \r\nchallenges can be grouped in three broad categories: a \r\nmore prosperous world that is free of poverty, a \r\ngreener world that is environmentally sustainable and a \r\nmore secure world that is liberated from the risk of a \r\nnuclear holocaust. Those certainly are challenges of the \r\nfirst order, although from our perspective we would \r\nadd three additional categories, to which I will allude \r\npresently. \r\n As to the first category, the recent High-level \r\nPlenary Meeting on the Millennium Development \r\nGoals once more demonstrated not only our \r\nOrganization’s power to convene at the highest \r\npolitical level but its effectiveness in its advocacy role \r\nfor development. We must persist in that core task and \r\ninsist that all parties meet the responsibilities they \r\nagreed to in the year 2000. In any case, although the \r\nUnited Nations might not be called upon to play a \r\ncentral role in addressing the effects of the economic \r\nand financial crisis of 2008 — one of the major \r\nadverse events of our times — its moral authority and \r\nuniversal membership surely warrant that it be seated \r\nat the table where such matters are discussed.  \r\n Likewise, our intergovernmental forums — \r\namong others, the General Assembly, the Economic \r\nand Social Council, the United Nations Conference on \r\nTrade and Development and the regional commissions, \r\nas well as their respective secretariats — continue to \r\ninfluence the priority development agenda at the \r\ninternational level and in each of our countries, while \r\nthe system’s programs and specialized agencies make \r\nan essential contribution to development cooperation. \r\n As to the second category, the United Nations \r\ncertainly showed the way forward with the United \r\nNations Conference on Environment and Development, \r\nheld in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, whose enormous \r\nimpact, in the sphere of both actions and ideas, will be \r\nthe subject of an assessment in another two years. At \r\nthe same time, the Organization is making great efforts \r\nto address what is perhaps the most relevant emerging \r\nissue of our generation: climate change and how it is \r\naffecting all aspects of human endeavour. It is essential \r\n A/65/PV.25\r\n \r\n19 10-56676 \r\n \r\nthat progress be made at the Conference of the Parties \r\nto the United Nations Framework Convention on \r\nClimate Change to be held in Cancún. Here again the \r\nUnited Nations is called upon to play a crucial role. \r\n The third category — seeking a safer world — \r\nmanifests itself in a number of ways. It starts with the \r\ncore function of our Organization — fostering and \r\nmaintaining peace — complemented by peacebuilding. \r\nIt could be argued that this is the category where the \r\nmost innovations have taken place in our Organization, \r\nranging from the conceptual framework offered in the \r\nNew Horizons Initiative in the area of peacekeeping to \r\nthe establishment five years ago of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission and the Peacebuilding Fund.  \r\n Conceptual and practical progress has also been \r\nachieved in diverse areas such as the protection of \r\ncivilians in situations of conflict, especially of \r\nvulnerable civilians, including women and children. \r\nRecent events in the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo illustrate just how difficult that task really is. \r\nWe also value the renewed impetus that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has given to the subject of disarmament, a \r\nmatter that has been rather stagnant and neglected in \r\nthe last decades. \r\n As a complement to the three large categories of \r\ntopics alluded to by the Secretary-General, he could \r\nvery well have added three additional categories: first, \r\nthe basic purpose of the United Nations, which is to \r\npromote and defend human rights; second, the growing \r\nimportance of the Organization in providing \r\nhumanitarian assistance; and third, cross-cutting issues \r\nsuch as gender equality. \r\n With regard to the promotion of human rights, in \r\nrecent years new topics have surfaced, such as the \r\nresponsibility to protect our respective populations \r\nfrom genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and \r\ncrimes against humanity; a stronger commitment to the \r\nsituation of indigenous peoples; the effort to combat \r\nimpunity and establish the rule of law; and the \r\npossibility of reviewing the work of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil in the near future.  \r\n The role of the United Nations as a provider of \r\nhumanitarian assistance became dramatically apparent \r\nin the last year, with the earthquake that levelled Port-\r\nau-Prince in Haiti and, very recently, the flooding that \r\naffected millions in Pakistan. In spite of the \r\nextraordinary demands placed on the Office for the \r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the World Food \r\nProgramme and other specialized agencies, the system \r\nwas able to respond in a satisfactory manner.  \r\n Finally, as to the cross-cutting issues, the creation \r\nof the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and \r\nthe Empowerment of Women — UN Women — \r\nappears at the forefront of our agenda. The \r\nappointment of the former President of Chile,  \r\nMs. Michelle Bachelet, a very well-respected person, \r\nas its first Executive Director has contributed to \r\nexpectations of an impetus that the Organization will \r\nbe able to provide in this area.  \r\n This small sample of the broad and diverse \r\nagenda we have before us — without even touching on \r\nother high-priority issues, such as combating \r\ntransnational crime, implementing the Counter-\r\nTerrorism Strategy and analysing international \r\nmigrations — underscores the singular nature of the \r\nUnited Nations and its continued relevance, in spite of \r\nthe shortcomings that we are all familiar with and the \r\ncriticism that the Organization’s detractors \r\ncontinuously hurl at it.  \r\n That said, we must recognize that we are still wed \r\nto an institutional structure designed to respond to \r\ntwentieth-century problems, not necessarily those of \r\nthe twenty-first century. Some progress has been made \r\nin the area of administrative management and in \r\ncoordination and consistency, and the agenda has \r\nslowly moved towards embracing emerging issues. \r\nHowever, it could be argued that progress has been \r\nslow, insufficient and, in some cases, superficial. The \r\nmother of all reforms, the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil, continues to languish. It is high time that we \r\nseriously address that issue, since a solution making \r\nthe Council more representative would not only be \r\njustified in itself but would also open the way for the \r\nother reforms the United Nations needs in order to \r\nreach its full potential. \r\n To conclude, I would like to say a few words \r\nabout the Secretariat and about the staff that serves it. I \r\nam moved to do so by the memory of the 105 staff \r\nmembers who lost their lives in Haiti in the \r\nperformance of their duties. And perhaps I am also \r\nmoved by my current status as Chair of the Fifth \r\nCommittee of the General Assembly. Having a \r\nSecretariat that inspires respect in Member States is a \r\ncentral point for the sound functioning of the United \r\nNations. It requires the unshakeable leadership of the \r\nSecretary-General and highly competent and motivated \r\nA/65/PV.25  \r\n \r\n10-56676 20 \r\n \r\nstaff both at Headquarters and in the field. We believe \r\nthat we are fortunate that the Secretariat already meets \r\nthose criteria to a very high degree. But like everything \r\nelse in life, it is subject to improvement. That is why \r\nthe exercise that the General Assembly is to conduct \r\nthis year to review human resources policies is of such \r\nimportance, and it is also part of the strengthening that \r\nwe seek for our Organization. \r\n Mr. Badji (Senegal) (spoke in French): I would \r\nlike to take the opportunity offered us by the \r\nconsideration, at the beginning of this session, of the \r\nreport of the Secretary-General on the work of the \r\nOrganization (A/65/1) to reiterate to the President the \r\nsincere congratulations of the Senegalese delegation on \r\nhis election to the presidency of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-fifth session. No one doubts that his \r\nqualities as an outstanding diplomat and his great \r\nexperience on the international scene will enable us to \r\nmake significant progress in our shared quest for \r\nsolutions to problems that humanity is facing. In \r\ncarrying out his noble mission, he can count on the \r\nactive support of the Senegalese delegation. \r\n Today more than ever the globalization of crises \r\nthat transcend borders and differences reminds us of \r\nthe pressing need for a more committed, more \r\ninclusive multilateral approach if together we want to \r\nhave a collective effect on the future of the generations \r\nto come. The thoughts that we shared during the \r\ngeneral debate just a few days ago all make us see that \r\nwe need to think in new ways of how we can act as the \r\ninternational community to draw up bold solutions \r\nwith a view to freeing our world from the numerous \r\nvices that hamper the flourishing of humankind. \r\n The summit on the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) that concluded about two weeks ago \r\nreminded us of the unpleasant assessment of the timid \r\nprogress made in our common plan for achieving the \r\nGoals that we had undertaken to accomplish by 2015, \r\nas, incidentally, the report of the Secretary-General \r\nunderlines.  \r\n Through the commitments in the outcome \r\ndocument of the summit on the MDGs (resolution \r\n65/1), we have made a date with the poor and the \r\nvulnerable of this world in 2015. We have the \r\ncollective and historic responsibility to achieve those \r\nGoals, which are clearly the minimum conditions that \r\nevery person can expect for a decent existence. The \r\ntime for action has come, and we must act quickly. Let \r\nus try to do so, so as not to disappoint the expectations \r\nof millions of men and women who are confronted \r\ndaily with illness and despair. \r\n But each — developed countries as well as \r\ndeveloping countries — should play its part, because it \r\nis true that whatever the urgent efforts that our \r\ncountries need to undertake, they can do so only if the \r\ncommitments made in other frameworks and \r\npartnerships are acted on — for example, managing \r\ndebt, promoting free and fair trade, improving the \r\nvolume and quality of assistance and the mechanisms \r\nfor granting it, and facilitating access to modern \r\ntechnologies.  \r\n With regard to Africa, which is lagging behind \r\nsignificantly in achieving the MDGs, it is for us, \r\nfollowing the Secretary-General, to forcefully reaffirm \r\nthat “Africa’s people need neither pity nor charity; they \r\nneed the tools to create jobs and generate incomes” \r\n(A/65/1, para. 35). \r\n In truth, more than a need, it is an urgent \r\nrequirement that we rethink and reform the methods \r\nand modes of action that have guided our approach \r\nuntil now in order to adapt them to the geopolitical \r\nrealities of the twenty-first century. The issue is, most \r\nof all, to break with the status quo that marginalizes the \r\nmajority of Member States and to establish a global \r\norder in which Africa will fully play the role it should \r\nhave. Transparency, openness and inclusion should be \r\nthe key words of the new order that we want to build \r\ntogether. \r\n Significant progress has been made in the \r\nsecurity situation in Africa in terms of settling crises \r\nand conflicts in countries such as Côte d’Ivoire, \r\nGuinea, Guinea-Bissau and the Sudan. But such \r\nprogress does not mean that we should lose sight of the \r\ntragic situation that Somalia has plunged into, which \r\ndeserves greater attention from us. The United Nations \r\nand the African Union should plan a joint action to \r\nbring an end to that human tragedy, which continues to \r\nunfold before our eyes. \r\n Despite some satisfying progress here and there, \r\nwith regard to the ever-increasing complexity of \r\nconflicts, we continually question the way the United \r\nNations intervenes in theatres of operations. Should we \r\nnot be considering integrating peacebuilding into \r\npeacekeeping operations, including a civil component \r\nthat is more significant and better equipped? That \r\nquestion will undoubtedly be taken into account as part \r\n A/65/PV.25\r\n \r\n21 10-56676 \r\n \r\nof the review of the Peacebuilding Commission. It \r\nwould also make sense to further explore the paths of \r\npreventive diplomacy, given the exorbitant cost of \r\npeacekeeping operations and the tragic consequences \r\nof conflicts. In that context, the accent should be on \r\npromoting good governance and combating drug \r\ntrafficking, the illegal arms trade and all forms of \r\nhuman rights violations. \r\n Concerning that very question of human rights, \r\nwe should take advantage of the review of the \r\noperations of the Human Rights Council, scheduled for \r\nthe current session, to correct its functional and \r\nstructural shortcomings, in order to dispel the polemics \r\nand confrontations and to turn that body into an area \r\nfor dialogue, where dynamic compromises can emerge \r\nthat could preserve human dignity. \r\n The United Nations must also fully play the role \r\nof guarantor of the international legal order, which, to \r\nbe fair and effective, should be based on respect for \r\nand promotion of the rule of law. It is when we are \r\nunited under one impetus that we are best able to \r\nprevent such serious crimes as genocide, war crimes, \r\ncrimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing, and, \r\nwhen such crimes are committed, to react promptly and \r\neffectively. We truly have a shared responsibility to act \r\nin order to ensure that the atrocities that these serious \r\ncrimes expose us to never happen again, and so that we \r\ncan work towards the emergence of an effective, fair, \r\nimpartial and apolitical international criminal justice \r\nsystem. \r\n In the same way, we must do all we can to \r\nsucceed in our crusade against terrorism. The challenge \r\nis enormous, of course, but it is within our reach if we \r\ncan display the faith and commitment that the \r\nchallenge demands. It goes without saying that \r\neffective implementation of the Global Counter-\r\nTerrorism Strategy by all the relevant actors would be a \r\nnotable step forward in our common struggle to utterly \r\neradicate the scourge of terrorism. \r\n While it is undeniable that through its actions the \r\nUnited Nations is an essential platform in the search \r\nfor solutions to existing concerns, we must note that \r\nthe complexity of emerging challenges, the gravity of \r\nnew threats and the more or less serious failures and \r\nshortcomings threaten to render our actions less \r\neffective. As a universal Organization, the United \r\nNations has the primary responsibility for facing up to \r\nthat, in fully exercising its prerogatives, to produce \r\noptimum responses to the obstacles that block our \r\nongoing quest for progress. \r\n It is thus fortunate that our Organization has been \r\nenriched by the arrival of a new organ, UN Women, \r\nwhich places the gender dimension on the international \r\nagenda. I would like to assure the Assembly of \r\nSenegal’s complete support for that new entity and its \r\nUnder-Secretary-General, President Michelle Bachelet, \r\nwhile expressing my fervent wish that its contribution \r\nwill enrich our Organization, whose universal mandate \r\nand scope will thus be strengthened in this area. \r\n In conclusion, I would strongly encourage the \r\nPalestinian and Israeli peoples, condemned as they are \r\nto live together, to find the necessary resources to \r\ncreate the conditions in which they can coexist in peace \r\nand security. That will unquestionably come via the \r\ncreation, at the side of Israel, of an independent, \r\nsovereign and viable Palestinian State, with defined \r\nand internationally recognized borders. That is the way \r\nto salvation in that region, and it is the earnest desire of \r\nmy country. \r\n Ms. Blum (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): We \r\nbegan the current session only a few weeks ago, and \r\nthe work that the Assembly has done is already quite \r\nextensive. That is why I would like to express my \r\nspecial appreciation for the exemplary way in which \r\nthe President has conducted discussions and for the \r\nmanner in which the work has been developing during \r\nthe session. \r\n As aptly noted by the Secretary-General in his \r\nreport (A/65/1), the United Nations has a concrete \r\nframework to guide its actions: the Millennium \r\nDeclaration (resolution 55/2) and the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). It is therefore extremely \r\nimportant that the High-level Plenary Meeting on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals served as the \r\nframework for the reaffirmation of our commitment to \r\nmeeting the Goals we set for ourselves in 2000. \r\n We are all aware of the enormous challenges we \r\nface for 2015. Recent progress by the Organization has \r\nshown that it is possible to develop specific tools to \r\nachieve substantial improvements in the welfare and \r\nliving conditions of the most needy and to ensure basic \r\nrights to all persons. Let me mention two examples of \r\nthat progress: the adoption of the action plan for the \r\nnext five years approved by Member States in \r\nSeptember, and the launch of the Global Strategy for \r\nWomen’s and Children’s Health, promoted by the \r\nA/65/PV.25  \r\n \r\n10-56676 22 \r\n \r\nSecretary-General, which has received pledges of more \r\nthan $40 billion. \r\n Colombia also recognizes the special priority that \r\nthe Secretary-General has given to the challenges that \r\nclimate change creates for the international community. \r\nWe appreciate the fact that the actions defined by the \r\nUnited Nations system in this area are subject to \r\nappropriate consultations with the States.  \r\n As a highly diverse country that is vulnerable to \r\nclimate change, Colombia is confident that we will \r\nreach agreements, both in Nagoya at the Conference of \r\nthe Parties to the Convention on Biodiversity, and in \r\nCancún at the Conference on the Climate Change \r\nConvention. It is also essential to recognize the \r\nintrinsic relations between climate change and \r\nbiodiversity, and, based on those relations, to \r\ncoordinate the actions taken by the Conventions to \r\naddress both themes in the context of the United \r\nNations. \r\n We reiterate that in order to meet the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, international cooperation must \r\nplay a role of the greatest importance. The world \r\neconomy is beginning to show signs of recovery from \r\none of its worst crises, and it is time to get back on \r\ntrack to making good on the cooperation and assistance \r\ncommitments undertaken by the entire international \r\ncommunity. \r\n Colombia has managed to overcome challenges \r\nthat called into question its viability as a State. Now, \r\nwe are seen as a role model because of our \r\nstrengthened democratic institutions, the radical \r\nimprovement in our security, and our socio-economic \r\ndevelopment potential. The experiences in the fight \r\nagainst adversity allowed us to develop technical and \r\noperational capabilities that we are sharing with \r\nvarious countries. Issues such as the conservation and \r\nsustainable use of forests, renewable energies, the fight \r\nagainst terrorism and drug trafficking, the fight against \r\nthe illicit trade in small arms and light weapons, \r\nhumanitarian assistance, and the disarmament, \r\ndemobilization and reintegration of illegal armed \r\ngroups are just some of the areas in which Colombia \r\ncan contribute to ensuring the protection of and access \r\nto the global public goods to which the Secretary-\r\nGeneral referred to in his report. \r\n In connection with some of those issues, we \r\nwould like to encourage the work of the United \r\nNations Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force, \r\ngiven the need to move forward more firmly and \r\ndecisively with the implementation of the Global \r\nCounter-Terrorism Strategy. I take this opportunity to \r\nreiterate our call to all States to reinvigorate efforts to \r\nagree on and promptly promulgate a general \r\nconvention against terrorism. \r\n Similarly, in 2012 we must achieve a balanced, \r\nlegally binding arms trade treaty with the highest \r\npossible common standards, because, as noted in the \r\nSecretary-General’s report, unregulated arms transfers \r\nhave many negative effects on stability, development \r\nand human rights. \r\n On the other hand, the efforts made by the \r\nOrganization in the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security deserve special mention. It has been \r\nexpanding its role of supporting peace and stabilization \r\nprocesses and has made innovative use of the resources \r\nat its disposal in the exercise of preventive diplomacy. \r\n With regard to the role of peacebuilding and \r\npeacekeeping operations, it is important to continue to \r\nstrengthen coordinated working mechanisms among \r\nthe General Assembly, the Security Council, the \r\nSecretariat and other bodies, so that, within their \r\nrespective competencies, comprehensive and inclusive \r\nwork can be developed, given that, as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral stated, peacekeeping and peacebuilding \r\nactivities are not substitutes for lasting political \r\nsolutions to crisis situations. \r\n This year, the world has faced some of the worst \r\nnatural disasters ever seen, and the Organization faced \r\nparticular challenges in attending to those suffering \r\ntheir consequences. It is time to reinforce measures in \r\ndisaster prevention and risk mitigation, as well as the \r\ncoordination of humanitarian assistance and efforts to \r\nstrengthen stable transitions to development. \r\n The case of Haiti deserves special attention \r\nbecause, as President Juan Manuel Santos said before \r\nthis Assembly (see A/65/PV.15), the people of that \r\nbrotherly country are still suffering the consequences \r\nof the earthquake of 12 January 2010. Approximately \r\nnine months have passed since the tragedy, and many \r\nof the commitments we made to the Government and \r\npeople of Haiti have yet to be realized. We cannot \r\nforget those who need us and have pinned their hopes \r\non the Organization, especially when we aim to \r\nprovide long-term solutions. \r\n A/65/PV.25\r\n \r\n23 10-56676 \r\n \r\n There is a cross-cutting theme of utmost \r\nimportance in the report of the Secretary-General. I am \r\nreferring to the topic of gender equality and the \r\nempowerment of women. We welcome the adoption by \r\nconsensus of resolution 64/289, which established the \r\nUnited Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the \r\nEmpowerment of Women. I congratulate former \r\nChilean President Michelle Bachelet on her \r\nappointment as Under-Secretary-General to lead that \r\nnew entity in its dual mandate of promoting the \r\nincorporation of gender perspectives in the work of the \r\nOrganization and strengthening cooperation with States \r\nin this area. \r\n In this the year in which the United Nations \r\nsuffered its greatest ever loss of life in the line of duty, \r\nColombia would like to add its voice to that of the \r\nSecretary-General in paying tribute to all personnel \r\nwho lost their lives in pursuit of the ideals of our \r\nOrganization. \r\n Finally, Colombia thanks the Secretary-General \r\nfor presenting his report on the work of the \r\nOrganization, which reflects the diligent work he \r\ncarries out, together with the entire team of the \r\nSecretariat, towards the realization of the goals we \r\nhave set ourselves. I reiterate my delegation’s steady \r\nsupport for him in carrying out his work successfully \r\nand effectively. \r\n Mr. Ali (Malaysia): I would like to thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his report (A/65/1), which he \r\npresented to this body on 23 September (see \r\nA/65/PV.11). The thrust of this year’s report is more \r\npositive than in previous years, indicating that the \r\nOrganization has managed to achieve more in this past \r\nyear despite the ever-present global challenges. We \r\ncongratulate the men and women of the United \r\nNations, who have been able to ensure delivery of the \r\nOrganization’s mandate. \r\n One obvious addition to the United Nations \r\nfamily over the past year, and one which my country is \r\npleased to welcome, is the establishment of a dedicated \r\nentity for gender equality and the empowerment of \r\nwomen — UN Women, for short.  \r\n Women’s empowerment is nothing new for \r\nMalaysia, which has had such a policy since the days \r\nleading up to our independence. Women have always \r\nbeen a major part of the Malaysian workforce, rising \r\nup through the ranks to hold positions such as \r\nGovernor of the Central Bank, Attorney General, \r\nSolicitor General and Accountant General, even as \r\nearly as the 1980s. Then, of course, there were the \r\nambassadors, the heads of departments and the chief \r\nexecutive officers of companies. But for some reason \r\nthere has never been an abundance of women in \r\npolitics, with national figures only hovering around the \r\n10 per cent mark, and well below the 19 per cent \r\naverage internationally. \r\n When Member States voted unanimously to \r\nestablish UN Women in July of this year, it signalled a \r\nsignificant milestone in the work of the Organization. \r\nIt meant that global movement for the empowerment of \r\nwomen had finally arrived and the goal of achieving \r\ntrue gender equality was inching ever closer. It also \r\nmeant that the streamlining of women’s participation \r\nwithin the United Nations would be even greater than \r\nbefore. The Secretary-General has done a \r\ncommendable job in naming to his cabinet, and to the \r\nposts of Under-Secretaries-General, a number of \r\ncompetent, prolific and dynamic women, in recognition \r\nof their work and capabilities. \r\n This past year also saw a number of historic \r\nevents both in the work of the Organization and in the \r\nmandate with which the Organization was entrusted. In \r\nthe final month of 2009, Copenhagen welcomed \r\nclimate change negotiators from near and far, but the \r\nConference failed to deliver on its promise of a better \r\nfuture. Even though expectations of a breakthrough \r\nagreement in Copenhagen were high, they were in no \r\nway unrealistic, particularly for those nations whose \r\nvery survival is already in jeopardy. When we convene \r\nin Cancún this year, we will have another chance to \r\nmake a real change for the future. The Organization \r\ncan play a leading role in ensuring that we do not waste \r\nyet another opportunity to effect a sustainable and \r\nsatisfactory post-Kyoto world. \r\n The second historic event to occur this past year \r\nwith regard to the Organization had to do with the \r\nregular budget of the United Nations itself. This year, \r\nthe United Nations regular budget topped the $5 billion \r\nmark for the first time since the Organization’s \r\nestablishment. Only two cycles ago, the regular budget \r\nfor the biennium 2006-2007 stood at $3.8 billion. That \r\nmeans that, in a mere four years, the United Nations \r\nexpanded its budget by 30 per cent. While the figures \r\nthemselves are not particularly earth-shattering, in a \r\nworld of increasingly limited resources where \r\nsustainability is key, the United Nations must find \r\ninnovative ways to halt this budget expansion. For one, \r\nA/65/PV.25  \r\n \r\n10-56676 24 \r\n \r\nwork duplication within the United Nations system that \r\nresults in the creation of administrative posts must be \r\nstopped. It must also be remembered that this figure \r\ndoes not include the nearly $8 billion allocated for \r\npeacekeeping activities alone. \r\n Thirdly, the deployment of United Nations \r\npeacekeeping personnel in 2009 reached, as the \r\nSecretary-General put it, unprecedented levels, rising \r\nto 124,000 deployed personnel. As one of the \r\ncornerstones in the work of the United Nations, the \r\ndeployment of United Nations personnel to maintain \r\npeace and security remains an important aspect of \r\nUnited Nations work overall. But it is hoped that these \r\nfigures will decrease significantly with the scheduled \r\nwithdrawal or drawdown of the United Nations in three \r\nof its current 16 peacekeeping missions. We hope too \r\nthat the integrated approach being introduced will help \r\nbring about greater efficiency in the way the United \r\nNations conducts its presence on the ground. \r\n The fourth milestone for the Organization this \r\npast year had to do with the number of new \r\nhumanitarian emergencies it had to handle. A total of \r\n43 new emergencies within a period of some 12 \r\nmonths could stretch United Nations resources even \r\nfurther, thus hindering its ability to respond effectively \r\nand efficiently to such emergencies. Malaysia notes \r\nthat the number of natural disasters continues to rise on \r\na yearly basis. We believe that, to a certain extent, this \r\nmay be attributable to the climate change phenomenon. \r\nThe only solution to the growing incidence of natural \r\ndisasters would be to address the problem of climate \r\nchange now, as it is now more imperative than ever to \r\ngather the collective will to tackle this global \r\nchallenge. \r\n On the issue of humanitarian assistance, Malaysia \r\nremains deeply concerned by the rising attacks on \r\nhumanitarian workers under the United Nations banner. \r\nThese attacks, while in no way excusable or \r\nacceptable, must surely have some grounding in \r\nperceived grievances or distrust in the Organization as \r\na whole. In the short term, the Secretary-General’s \r\nproposal to review and adjust security arrangements \r\nwould enable the Organization to continue to carry out \r\none of its mainstay activities. However, in the longer \r\nterm we must reconsider the way we do business. \r\nLong-term programmes must be established to ensure \r\nthe safety and security of United Nations workers on \r\nthe ground, including through embarking on favourable \r\npublic relations.  \r\n It was not so long ago that those who wore \r\nUnited Nations blue helmets or worked under the \r\nUnited Nations banner were given sufficient deference \r\nto go about their tasks. We need to reclaim that level of \r\nrespect for the work of the Organization, which would be \r\nmore effective in ensuring safety and security than flexing \r\nour military might or cocooning ourselves in a bubble. \r\nThe two cornerstones of United Nations work — \r\npeacekeeping and humanitarian assistance — must not \r\nbe compromised. \r\n Every year, all of us in this Hall look forward to \r\nthe Secretary-General’s report on the work of the \r\nOrganization. We do so because as Member States of \r\nthe Organization we have a stake in its success, in its \r\nshortcomings and, most of all, in the work that it \r\ncarries out for the global village we live in. As so many \r\npeople have put it, including the Secretary-General \r\nhimself, the United Nations is more than just a \r\ncollection of buildings, or principles, or ideas and \r\nideals. The United Nations, working together, is more \r\nthan just the sum total of its present Members. It is an \r\nOrganization bolstered by the multiplier effect of its \r\nMembers’ strength. This is why so many nations are \r\ncommitted to making the Organization work and to \r\nensuring the continuity of the good work it carries out \r\naround the world.  \r\n For many small or developing countries \r\nworldwide, the work of the United Nations fills the \r\ncapability gap that individual nations alone cannot \r\nhope to fill. Even though the United Nations cannot \r\nbecome everything to everyone, it is still the best hope \r\nwe have of building a better, just and secure world. \r\n Mr. Acharya (Nepal): I would like to thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his comprehensive presentation \r\nof the report on the work of the Organization (A/65/1). \r\nThe report contains observations and insightful \r\nsuggestions on some of the key issues on the United \r\nNations agenda. On the whole, the report provides a \r\ngood basis for comprehensive and constructive \r\nintergovernmental deliberations on issues of major \r\nimportance to the global community. We are pleased \r\nthat the level of sensitization to development issues at \r\nthe global level has increased prominently this year, \r\nyet there remains a long way to go before the relevant \r\ncommitments achieve the development goals. \r\n The 2010 high-level review of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) last month concluded that \r\naccelerated progress is required if all the targets were \r\n A/65/PV.25\r\n \r\n25 10-56676 \r\n \r\nto be met by 2015. We are glad that there was general \r\nacceptance that while progress has been made on many \r\nfronts, we must scale up our efforts more consistently \r\nand comprehensively, in particular through global \r\npartnerships. It was particularly stressed that countries \r\nand regions lagging behind, such as least developed \r\ncountries (LDCs), would need additional concrete \r\nsupport from the international community towards \r\nnational leadership of programmes to meet the MDG \r\ntargets. The already precarious conditions of LDC \r\npopulations living in poverty and hunger have \r\nworsened in the wake of multiple yet mutually \r\nexacerbating economic, financial and food and energy \r\ncrises, together with the adverse and disproportionate \r\nimpacts of climate change.  \r\n As reflected in the earlier report entitled \r\n“Keeping the promise” (A/64/665), we would have \r\nliked to see the situation of the LDCs clearly \r\narticulated in the Secretary-General’s current report in \r\nterms of their monumental development challenges as \r\nthe most vulnerable group. It is our considered view, \r\nand one generally accepted by all, that the MDGs and \r\nother internationally agreed development goals cannot \r\nbe achieved unless they are achieved by the LDCs as \r\nwell. That should be duly reflected in all United \r\nNations reports. \r\n The maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity is the primary responsibility of the United \r\nNations. In today’s interconnected and globalized \r\nworld, the notion of security transcends the confines of \r\nmilitary threats and challenges. Therefore, preventive \r\ndiplomacy must encompass this aspect alongside \r\nsupport for peace processes in countries emerging \r\nfrom, or in, conflict. \r\n In recent years the demand for increased United \r\nNations involvement in preventive diplomacy, crisis \r\nmanagement, conflict resolution and building \r\nsustainable peace has increased phenomenally. \r\nIncreased responsibility calls for increased political \r\ncommitment and resources. New and changing patterns \r\nof conflicts and crises require commensurate responses \r\nthat often involve new and innovative solutions. We \r\nshare the concerns expressed by the Secretary-General \r\nin paragraph 66 of his report. We must take full \r\nownership of all United Nations peacekeeping missions \r\nand provide them with clear and unambiguous \r\nmandates, which need to be designed in close \r\ncooperation with troop-contributing countries while \r\nalso taking into account the concerns of the parties \r\ninvolved. \r\n Guided by its profound commitment to contribute \r\nto the maintenance of international peace and security, \r\nNepal has consistently participated in United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations around the world. We remain \r\nsteadfast in our commitment. \r\n The ongoing review of the peacebuilding \r\narchitecture offers an opportunity to consider further \r\nmeasures to strengthen its effectiveness on the ground. \r\nWe will fully engage in its deliberations in the days \r\nahead.  \r\n The consolidation of national ownership and \r\ncapacity-building and greater involvement and \r\ncoordination among United Nations organs on \r\npeacebuilding issues, with a key role for the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and the realization of the \r\nCommission’s full potential, with more resources and \r\npolitical commitment through the effective \r\nimplementation of the integrated strategic framework, \r\nwill be essential to laying a strong and sustainable \r\nfoundation for peace, reconstruction and recovery. We \r\nshould also make sure that we integrate peacebuilding \r\nefforts early on with peacekeeping operations. We \r\nwelcome the recent efforts to establish collaboration \r\nand partnership with the World Bank and other \r\nfinancial institutions to mobilize resources for \r\npeacebuilding efforts. We also call for greater \r\ninvolvement of women in peacebuilding to ensure \r\ninclusiveness for its long-term sustainability. \r\n Natural disasters, poverty and hunger, financial \r\ncrises, resource scarcity, population growth and \r\ngrowing urbanization have increased humanitarian \r\nchallenges. The devastating earthquake in Haiti and the \r\nunprecedented floods in Pakistan and elsewhere have \r\nunderscored the imperative need for building enhanced \r\ncapacity for disaster management and risk reduction. \r\n Similarly, it is worrisome to note that the \r\neconomic and food crises and climate change continue \r\nto have a negative impact on human rights, with \r\nincreased incidences of xenophobia and discrimination \r\nagainst non-citizens in certain parts of the world. This \r\nhas underlined the fact that guaranteeing economic \r\nsecurity to all is critically important in order to ensure \r\nthe full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms by all. \r\nA/65/PV.25  \r\n \r\n10-56676 26 \r\n \r\n The universality, indivisibility and non-selectivity \r\nof all human rights help promote global adherence to \r\nhuman rights values and norms. Poor and vulnerable \r\ncountries must be provided with adequate resources \r\nand means to guarantee the practical benefits of \r\nglobalized human rights norms and values to their \r\ncitizens. It is in this context that the significance of the \r\nright to development also needs to be underlined.  \r\n We attach importance to the review of the Human \r\nRights Council. The Universal Periodic Review, which \r\nis an important feature of the Council, must be \r\npreserved and further strengthened with a view to \r\npromoting and protecting human rights globally. I \r\nwould like to reaffirm that Nepal’s commitment to all \r\nhuman rights is unequivocal. We have thus made \r\nsubstantive progress in protecting and promoting \r\nfundamental human rights over the past few years. \r\n The report states in paragraph 106 that addressing \r\nclimate change, advancing on a global health agenda, \r\ncountering terrorism and making progress on \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation have been priorities \r\nfor the Secretary-General. However, in our view, \r\npoverty and hunger should also be treated with the \r\nequal priority they deserve within the overall strategic \r\norientation of the Organization. This is obvious as the \r\nworld, with over 1 billion people living in poverty and \r\nhunger, cannot be considered as a safe place for all to \r\nlive in. \r\n The climate negotiations in Cancún, Mexico, later \r\nthis year must work towards producing an ambitious \r\nand legally binding instrument to succeed the Kyoto \r\nProtocol. The cost of delay and failure to act on this \r\nexistential issue will be colossal. The international \r\ncommunity must provide much-needed political \r\nsupport to push the process forward while respecting \r\nthe principle of common but differentiated \r\nresponsibilities. Building trust among countries, \r\nensuring transparency in the negotiations and finding \r\neffective and innovative solutions for deeper emission \r\ncuts should underpin the dialogue. An early agreement \r\non financing mechanisms would greatly contribute to \r\nenhancing confidence in the negotiation process. \r\n Least developed countries, which are highly \r\nvulnerable to climate change, are bearing unacceptably \r\ndisproportionate impacts as compared to their \r\nnegligible contribution to climate change. My country, \r\nNepal, also falls in this category. Global warming has \r\ncaused rapid melting of snow in the Nepali Himalayas. \r\nAbout two dozen of our glacial lakes could burst at any \r\ntime, causing a huge loss of life and property. In \r\naddition, we face extreme weather patterns, floods, soil \r\ndegradation and desertification. The protection of \r\nmountain ecology, which is fragile and a great \r\nrepository of biodiversity, is critically important to \r\npreserve the Himalayas, which are also the perennial \r\nsource of fresh water for over 1 billion people living in \r\nSouth Asia and beyond. \r\n The international community must agree on new, \r\npredictable, transparent and substantially enhanced \r\nresource mobilization and a fast-track provision to \r\nensure resources for mitigation, adaptation, transfer of \r\ntechnology, REDD-plus and capacity-building in least \r\ndeveloped countries, commensurate with their needs \r\nand vulnerabilities.  \r\n Nepal has consistently called for general and \r\ncomplete disarmament with respect to all weapons of \r\nmass destruction and for the elimination of nuclear \r\nweapons in a time-bound manner. Nepal stands for the \r\nearly operationalization of the Comprehensive Nuclear-\r\nTest-Ban Treaty and an early conclusion of a fissile \r\nmaterial cut-off treaty. \r\n We concur with the apt remark of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that the world is over-armed and that \r\ndevelopment is under-funded. The international \r\ncommunity must make serious efforts to promote \r\ncomplete and general disarmament and divert resources \r\nfrom armaments to invest in long-term peace, stability \r\nand prosperity for the world. This is what our \r\nconscience dictates, and this is what is just and \r\nequitable. \r\n Terrorism is a crime and cannot be justified on \r\nany grounds. Concerted global efforts are required to \r\nwipe out this deadly menace from our planet.  \r\n Similarly, the global health agenda must receive \r\ncontinued priority, especially given the fact that most \r\ncountries are lagging behind in meeting health-related \r\nMDGs, particularly those related to maternal health. \r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General that the \r\nimportance of health for economic productivity, social \r\nstability, security and poverty reduction must be \r\nstressed.  \r\n Nepal has expressed support for a change in the \r\ncomposition and working methods of the Security \r\nCouncil. We support expansion in the membership of \r\nthe Council in both categories. We welcome the recent \r\n A/65/PV.25\r\n \r\n27 10-56676 \r\n \r\nefforts to structure the debate on the expansion. We are \r\nof the view that all five core issues identified must be \r\naddressed in a holistic manner to agree on a reform \r\npackage. \r\n We must also ensure that the power and authority \r\nof the General Assembly, as the only representative \r\nbody, must be enhanced in a manner commensurate \r\nwith its standing. In that context, we welcome the \r\nongoing discussions on the revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, as envisioned by the founders, to \r\nstrike the right balance between the different organs of \r\nthe United Nations. We welcome the establishment of \r\nUN Women and the resolution on system-wide \r\ncoherence (resolution 64/289). \r\n It is not only the General Assembly and the \r\nSecurity Council that are in need of reform, but also \r\nthe Economic and Social Council. The role of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council must be enhanced in \r\npromoting global economic relations and advancing the \r\ndevelopment agenda in close cooperation with the \r\nBretton Woods and other relevant institutions. We are \r\nhappy with the recent progress in the reform of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council, but we would like to see \r\nthis process further accelerated. The United Nations \r\nmust take a lead role in ensuring coherence and \r\nconsistency in global economic, financial and trading \r\nsystems. \r\n In conclusion, Nepal has an abiding faith in the \r\nprinciples and purposes of the United Nations Charter \r\nas an indispensable instrument for global peace, \r\nstability and progress. It must promote all its pillars \r\ncoherently and vigorously. A strong and capable United \r\nNations buttresses multilateralism, which is essential \r\ntoday more than ever before to deal with the global \r\nproblems of our time. \r\n Mr. Park In-Kook (Republic of Korea): Allow \r\nme to begin by thanking the Secretary-General for his \r\nannual report (A/65/1), which provides a \r\ncomprehensive and clear overview of the \r\nOrganization’s achievements, as well as its challenges, \r\nand lays out a coherent blueprint for future \r\naccomplishments. \r\n As the Secretary-General reminds us in his \r\nreport,  \r\n  “The challenges are immense, but \r\nexperience has shown that when strong \r\ncommitments are backed by the right policies and \r\nadequate resources, even the greatest needs can \r\nbe met and real progress can be achieved.” \r\n(A/65/1, para. 12) \r\n My delegation believes that the international \r\ncommunity’s most pressing challenges should be \r\ntackled efficiently through sustained global and \r\ncollective action. The United Nations is at the forefront \r\nof that effort, as the preeminent international \r\nOrganization bestowed with authority and legitimacy. \r\n The High-level Plenary Meeting of the General \r\nAssembly on the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) in September was a good opportunity to \r\nconsolidate political will and galvanize the efforts of \r\nthe international community. With just five years \r\nremaining until 2015, many delegations shared the \r\nconcern that the prospects for achieving the MDGs did \r\nnot seem bright. However, we should note that our \r\ndetermination to achieve the MDGs is stronger than \r\never. Indeed, this has been demonstrated by the \r\nsuccessful launch of the Secretary-General’s Global \r\nStrategy for Women’s and Children’s Health. My \r\ndelegation believes that the Strategy will serve as an \r\neffective kick-start for the enhancement of maternal \r\nand child health, an area in which there has been little \r\nprogress in most developing countries since 1990. \r\n The success of the MDGs depends on action to \r\ndeliver. Member States should keep their commitments \r\nand continue to strive in their efforts towards \r\nstrengthening global partnerships based on mutual \r\naccountability. The outcome document (resolution \r\n65/1) will serve as a valuable guide and tool in such \r\nefforts. \r\n Keeping in mind the need to take a more active \r\nrole in the global partnerships for development, the \r\nRepublic of Korea is going to take concrete steps to \r\nfulfil its commitment to triple its 2008 official \r\ndevelopment assistance volume by 2015, to contribute \r\n$3.2 billion on an annual basis. In addition, by fully \r\nrecognizing the special needs of Africa, the Republic of \r\nKorea is implementing its Korea-Africa initiative as a \r\nlong-term programme for partnership with African \r\ncountries. \r\n Turning to climate change, our future greatly \r\ndepends on how effectively and urgently we can \r\naddress this issue. In that regard, my delegation \r\nappreciates the leadership of the Secretary-General in \r\nmaking this issue a priority since he first came into \r\noffice. My delegation believes that such sustained \r\nA/65/PV.25  \r\n \r\n10-56676 28 \r\n \r\nleadership will lead to a successful agreement at the \r\nsixteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange in Cancún. \r\n Allow me to take this opportunity to refer to the \r\nefforts of the Republic of Korea on the issue of climate \r\nchange. In an effort to curb greenhouse gas emissions, \r\nthe Korean Government has set itself a voluntary \r\nreduction target of 30 per cent of current levels by \r\n2020. To shift from an energy-intensive to a green-\r\ngrowth economy, the Government of the Republic of \r\nKorea has also adopted a pilot low-carbon green-\r\ngrowth initiative to promote the growth of green \r\nindustries. \r\n In the area of peace and security, the intensifying \r\ndemand for peacekeeping, with progressively complex \r\nand multidimensional mandates, reflects the world’s \r\nfaith in United Nations peacekeeping operations. The \r\nRepublic of Korea also participates in the international \r\nsupport for peacekeeping operations. This year alone, \r\nthe Government of the Republic of Korea has \r\ndispatched 240 contingents to the United Nations \r\nStabilization Mission in Haiti. Currently, some 650 \r\nKorean soldiers are serving in 11 peacekeeping \r\nmissions. \r\n To ensure sustainability and ultimate success, \r\npeacekeeping operations today must not just involve \r\nthe military dimension, but must also encompass \r\nintertwined strategies rooted in development, human \r\nrights and disarmament. Similarly, preventive actions \r\nor alternatives to sizable peacekeeping operations need \r\nto be actively pursued. In that regard, my delegation \r\nappreciates the mediation support effort by the \r\nDepartment of Political Affairs. Mediation and other \r\npreventive measures should be viewed as \r\ncomplementary and integral parts of everyday \r\npeacekeeping operations. \r\n Furthermore, peacebuilding efforts have now \r\nbecome an important feature of many peacekeeping \r\nmissions. My delegation hopes that this year’s review \r\nprocess will contribute to constructive improvement in \r\nUnited Nations peacebuilding, with a view towards \r\nenhancing transition during post-conflict periods and \r\nbuilding lasting institutions. \r\n With regard to humanitarian issues, despite the \r\ndedicated efforts and leadership of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, we still face enormous gaps and challenges on \r\nmany fronts. The most prominent seems to be the \r\nfunding shortage. Also, more efforts should be made to \r\nensure the safety of humanitarian workers operating in \r\nhigh-risk environments. Strengthening partnerships \r\nwith civil society and the private sector has become \r\nincreasingly important in that regard, as the recent \r\nearthquakes in Haiti and Chile have shown us. \r\n In the area of human rights, despite the \r\nsignificant progress made, serious violations continue \r\nto be committed in many parts of the world. Multiple \r\nglobal crises have served to further deteriorate the \r\noverall human rights situation. In crafting responses to \r\nmultiple global challenges, Member States should fully \r\nrecognize the relevance of human rights and \r\ndemonstrate further determination to work together in \r\npromoting and protecting them. Against that backdrop, \r\nmy delegation looks forward to the forthcoming review \r\nof the Human Rights Council, which should serve as a \r\ngood opportunity to strengthen the role of the United \r\nNations in the field of human rights by promoting the \r\nefficiency and effectiveness of that organ. \r\n My delegation believes that women’s rights and \r\ngender issues are an essential part of human rights. \r\nHowever, we are concerned that progress in those areas \r\nis slow and, in some cases, is being reversed. In that \r\nregard, the emphasis of the Secretary-General in his \r\nreport on the issue of gender equality and women’s \r\nempowerment as indispensable goals of the United \r\nNations is both timely and appropriate. \r\n The United Nations has played an indispensable \r\nrole in setting international norms and principles. As \r\nthe United Nations makes progress on the \r\nimplementation of the responsibility to protect, the \r\nworld will be better prepared to prevent any recurrence \r\nof mass atrocities. The contribution of the offices of \r\nthe Secretary-General’s Special Advisers for the \r\nResponsibility to Protect and on the Prevention of \r\nGenocide has been highly valuable in that regard. My \r\ndelegation expects that a joint office, achieved by \r\nmerging those two offices, will contribute to \r\ndeveloping conceptual norm-setting work by enhancing \r\ninformation-sharing, early warning and assessment. \r\n A new consensus now seems to be forming in the \r\ninternational community, not only with regard to \r\nnuclear non-proliferation but also as concerns the \r\neventual goal of a nuclear-free world. With many \r\npromising signs in every corner of the globe, we need \r\nto redouble our efforts to ensure that they lead to \r\ntangible results. In particular, my delegation welcomes \r\n A/65/PV.25\r\n \r\n29 10-56676 \r\n \r\nthe recent high-level meeting convened by the \r\nSecretary-General aimed at revitalizing the work of the \r\nConference on Disarmament and taking forward \r\nmultilateral disarmament negotiations. We should revive \r\nthe Conference as a key element in the robust machinery \r\nof the global disarmament and non-proliferation regime. \r\nWith that in mind, we will spare no effort in supporting \r\nfollow-up actions to the high-level meeting during the \r\ncurrent session of the General Assembly.  \r\n More than ever, great demands are being placed \r\non the United Nations to respond effectively to the \r\nmost daunting challenges of our era. I believe that the \r\nUnited Nations can do better. We must persist in our \r\nefforts to strengthen the world body through reform, \r\nwhich will enable the United Nations to be better \r\nequipped to confront the challenges of the future. To \r\nachieve that goal, Korea fully supports the important  \r\n \r\ninitiatives the Secretary-General has taken to promote \r\nthe efficiency, effectiveness and accountability of the \r\nSecretariat. In particular, my delegation welcomes the \r\nestablishment of UN Women, a singular synergistic \r\ngender entity. My delegation believes that it will \r\nstrengthen the overall accountability of the United \r\nNations system and, at the same time, promote gender \r\nequality and the empowerment of women. \r\n Let me conclude by renewing the Republic of \r\nKorea’s support for the Secretary-General in leading \r\nthe Organization effectively and carrying out its \r\nmandate successfully. The Republic of Korea remains \r\nfully committed to a strong and effective United \r\nNations that can make our world safer, more secure, \r\nmore prosperous and more peaceful. \r\n  The meeting rose at 1.10 p.m. \r\n"
