(Switzerland) \r\n \r\n \r\n In the absence of the President, Mr. Ndong Mba \r\n(Equatorial Guinea), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 108 (continued) \r\n \r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of the \r\nOrganization (A/65/1) \r\n \r\n Mr. Khazaee (Islamic Republic of Iran): I would \r\nfirst like to express my appreciation for the opportunity \r\nto consider the report of the Secretary-General on the \r\nwork of the Organization, contained in document \r\nA/65/1. At the outset, allow me to pay tribute and \r\nexpress my sympathy for all of the dedicated \r\ncolleagues and United Nations officials and experts \r\nwho lost their lives in different nations in the past year. \r\n I would like to limit myself to some of the major \r\nissues in the Secretary-General’s report that we found \r\nworthy of mentioning. One of the most important parts \r\nof the report addresses creating a stronger United \r\nNations. On this issue we share the vision of the \r\nSecretary-General that: \r\n  “The Organization is more than just a \r\ncollection of buildings, a sequence of meetings, a \r\nset of reports and consultations” (A/65/1, para. 165).  \r\n But we believe that this is one side of the coin \r\nwhen it comes to strengthening the United Nations. We \r\nare also of the view that the Organization stands for its \r\ncommitments to the peoples of the world through its \r\nprinciples and programmes as endorsed and adopted by \r\nits Member States. The United Nations Charter asks the \r\nSecretariat to observe the principles and carry out the \r\nprogrammes in a thorough and impartial manner. \r\n If we consider multilateralism to be at the core of \r\nthe United Nations, then the United Nations should be \r\nconsidered as an Organization that is owned and run by \r\nits whole membership, as is well symbolized in the \r\nGeneral Assembly. The ownership and conduct of its \r\nwork are envisaged through the three main pillars of \r\nUnited Nations activities as clearly defined in the \r\nCharter and reaffirmed by Member States in several \r\ninternational agreements. Those need to be treated in a \r\nbalanced manner and seen as an integral part of the \r\nOrganization’s agenda. \r\n In this sense, it is expected that promoting the \r\nrole of the General Assembly as the most \r\nrepresentative policy-making organ of the United \r\nNations will be placed at the top of the agenda of this \r\nreport, owing to the need to enhance multilateralism. \r\nHowever, in our view, that has not received proper \r\nattention in the report, despite improvements made \r\nduring the past year through the work of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group on the Revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly. The Working Group approved by consensus \r\nthe enhancement of the role of the General Assembly. \r\nIn fact, the revitalization of the General Assembly as \r\nan integral part of the comprehensive reform of the \r\nUnited Nations is a dynamic and continuous process. \r\nThus, we should remain constructively committed to \r\nthis ongoing process, with a view to strengthening the \r\nrole and authority of the Assembly.  \r\nA/65/PV.26  \r\n \r\n10-56786 2 \r\n \r\n The tendency to overemphasize some areas at the \r\nexpense of others will harm the equilibrium of United \r\nNations activities and thus its image as an Organization \r\nthat works for all. Regrettably, the substantive part of \r\nthe report reflects the existence of such imbalance in \r\nUnited Nations activities in the areas of development \r\nand global partnerships to strengthen the United \r\nNations role in the international financial and \r\neconomic system in the aftermath of the crisis. \r\n We align ourselves with the view expressed by \r\nthe Secretary-General on the negative impact of the \r\nongoing economic and food crises on human rights. In \r\nmuch of the developing world, national development \r\nefforts to provide a better life for the people have \r\nlagged under the weight of such crises. We believe that \r\nthe response of the United Nations system to these \r\nchallenges should also embrace the acknowledgment of \r\nthe right to development. Furthermore, we share the \r\nreport’s concerns over the increasing incidents of \r\nxenophobia and discrimination against non-citizens. \r\n On the issue of peacekeeping operations, we \r\nwelcome the news that the number of United Nations \r\npeacekeeping missions is not going to substantially \r\nincrease in the future and that it is time to consolidate \r\nand deepen our work on existing ones. If this \r\nprediction is to be considered as a basis for United \r\nNations policies and action on peacekeeping in the \r\ncoming years, it is incumbent upon us to make every \r\neffort to ensure that expanding peacekeeping processes \r\nin different targeted countries and regions is the result \r\nof close consultations among major stakeholders, \r\nincluding the General Assembly, the Secretariat, troop-\r\ncontributing countries and representatives of host \r\ncountries.  \r\n Furthermore, due attention should be paid to the \r\nfact that all strategies and policies of the Secretariat \r\nconcerning the issue of peacekeeping should be the \r\nproduct of an open and inclusive dialogue with the \r\nrelevant United Nations intergovernmental bodies, \r\nespecially the General Assembly and its Special \r\nCommittee on Peacekeeping Operations. \r\n It is also important to note that a number of \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations have been \r\ncreated following acts of military aggression against \r\ncertain nations and the illegal occupation of their lands. \r\nIn that regard, all three existing United Nations \r\npeacekeeping missions in the Middle East, namely, the \r\nUnited Nations Disengagement Observer Force, the \r\nUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon and the \r\nUnited Nations Truce Supervision Organization, were \r\ninitiated after a certain regime illegally and forcibly \r\noccupied the lands of three other nations in the region.  \r\n Needless to say, the only way to lead these \r\nmissions to a successful conclusion is to put pressure \r\non the occupying Power and force it to accept the will \r\nof the international community, as reflected in dozens \r\nof United Nations resolutions, and to withdraw \r\nunconditionally from all occupied lands. This is among \r\nthe main prerequisites for the establishment of a lasting \r\nand durable peace in the region. \r\n With regard to developing new concepts in the \r\nreport, we should avoid entertaining and even \r\nartificially prioritizing vague, undefined and \r\ncontroversial notions that are still under review and \r\nconsideration by the general membership, such as the \r\nconcept of the responsibility to protect or of global \r\ngoods. No doubt, the international community must be \r\nvigilant not to let the horrors of mass killings and \r\ngenocide of the past be repeated in the future. This \r\nshould not, however, be done in a manner that \r\nprejudices the established principles of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations, particularly the principles of \r\nrespect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and \r\npolitical independence of States and non-intervention \r\nin their internal affairs.  \r\n The Islamic Republic of Iran believes that the \r\nnotion of the responsibility to protect needs to be \r\nfurther discussed and clearly defined and refined. The \r\ndebates held on this notion thus far clearly indicate that \r\nthere are still many questions and concerns \r\nsurrounding this concept, which need to be addressed. \r\nHaving said that, we cannot endorse the way this \r\nnotion has been referred to in the report. We therefore \r\nexpect the Secretary-General to reconsider the format \r\nof future reports, to maintain their devotion to the three \r\nmain pillars of United Nations activities. \r\n My delegation, along with many \r\nunderrepresented developing countries, continues to be \r\nconcerned about the failure of the Secretariat to meet \r\nequitable geographic representation goals vis-à-vis its \r\nstaff, in particular in senior management positions. We \r\ncontinue to urge the Secretary-General to engage his \r\nOffice to this end and improve the international \r\ncharacter of the Secretariat. \r\n Finally, we welcome the cooperation of the \r\nUnited Nations with regional organizations, taking into \r\n A/65/PV.26\r\n \r\n3 10-56786 \r\n \r\naccount the principles and objectives of the United \r\nNations as enshrined in the Charter. We also call for \r\nexpanding the geographical scope of such cooperation \r\nin a way that incorporates all active and willing \r\nregional organizations, including Asian regional \r\norganizations, in particular the Economic Cooperation \r\nOrganization in the West Asian region. \r\n Mr. Valero Briceño (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): The Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela expresses its thanks to \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for having submitted \r\nhis annual report to the General Assembly (A/65/1) on \r\nthe work of the Organization. We appreciate the good \r\noffices of the Secretary-General, which enabled the \r\nreactivation of the office of the Personal \r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General on the Border \r\nControversy between Guyana and Venezuela. A \r\ndistinguished Jamaican, Mr. Norman Girvan, was \r\nappointed to that post to encourage dialogue on the \r\ndispute between Venezuela and Guyana over the \r\nGuyana-Essequibo territory. \r\n Despite what is stated in the report of the \r\nSecretary-General, the global financial and economic \r\ncrisis of capitalism continues to intensify. That crisis \r\nwas caused by financial speculators, with the \r\ncomplicity of the world’s most powerful Governments \r\nand the Bretton Woods institutions. \r\n We believe that the United Nations should \r\npromote a development model based on values such as \r\nsolidarity, justice, social inclusion, equality, respect for \r\nhuman rights and citizen participation. \r\n Venezuela calls for the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil, which requires an immediate expansion in its \r\nmembership to include representatives of countries in \r\nAfrica, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean. \r\nVenezuela demands the elimination of undemocratic \r\nprivileges related to the use of the veto, which were \r\ninherited from the Second World War and the Cold \r\nWar. \r\n Venezuela also demands that the General \r\nAssembly, as a body that is representative of all \r\ncountries, reclaims its rightful role, which has been \r\nusurped by the Security Council. We also call for the \r\ndirect and universal participation of all countries on an \r\nequal footing in the selection of the Secretary-General. \r\n According to Article 100 of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, the Secretary-General and the staff of \r\nthe Secretariat “shall not seek or receive instructions \r\nfrom any Government or from any other authority \r\nexternal to the Organization”. It is clear, therefore, that \r\nthe Secretary-General should represent the entire \r\nOrganization and ensure that the interests of powerful \r\ncountries are not imposed on the most vulnerable. We \r\nbelieve that it is not appropriate to attempt to introduce \r\ninto the work of the Organization agreements reached \r\nat other forums for negotiation, such as the Group of \r\n20 or the Group of Eight.  \r\n Venezuela’s aspiration is that the upcoming \r\nsummit on climate change to be held in Cancún later \r\nthis year will reach a legally binding and ambitious \r\nagreement that scrupulously respects the Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change and the Kyoto \r\nProtocol, which some wish to ignore. \r\n The Secretary-General states in paragraph 108 of \r\nhis report that, in the framework of the United Nations \r\nClimate Change Conference in Copenhagen, \r\n“Important progress was achieved in building a broad \r\npolitical consensus that can invigorate global \r\nnegotiations”. He also states, in the next paragraph, \r\nthat negotiations on climate change should “build on \r\nthe elements of agreement that emerged from \r\nCopenhagen”. Alarmingly, however, he makes no \r\nmention of the Kyoto Protocol.  \r\n We wish to recall that the President of the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Mr. Hugo Chávez \r\nFrías, expressed the disagreement of the member \r\ncountries of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of \r\nOur America with the undemocratic manner in which \r\nthe Copenhagen Accord was adopted.  \r\n It is of concern that the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral includes the concept of the responsibility to \r\nprotect, all the more so if it is seen, in the words of \r\nparagraph 85, as a “prerequisite[] for the promotion of \r\nhuman welfare” and as “permit[ting] the realization of \r\na stable polity”. In resolution 63/308, Member States \r\nagreed to continue evaluating and considering this \r\nconcept. We wish to emphasize that the concept of the \r\nresponsibility to protect is still under discussion by \r\nMember States. It is therefore questionable that there \r\nalready exist in the United Nations offices and staff \r\ndedicated to promoting the concept. We wonder what \r\nresolution gave the mandate for that. \r\n The concept of the responsibility to protect is a \r\nsophisticated variant of humanitarian intervention, \r\nwhich has already been rejected in this forum. This \r\nA/65/PV.26  \r\n \r\n10-56786 4 \r\n \r\nconcept erodes the principles of sovereignty, territorial \r\nintegrity and non-interference in the internal affairs of \r\nother States, which are enshrined in the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. Without these principles, developing \r\ncountries would be at the mercy of the schemes of \r\nimperialist Powers, which seek to impose their \r\neconomic, political and military interests, often by \r\nforce. \r\n The head of State of the Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela, Mr. Hugo Chávez Frías, has declared that  \r\n “here is a group of countries that believe \r\nthemselves superior to us in the South, to us in \r\nthe Third World, to us the underdeveloped — or, \r\nas the great writer Eduardo Galeano has said, we \r\nthe countries crushed as if by the train of \r\nhistory”.  \r\n It is therefore regrettable that there are imperialist \r\ncountries that believe themselves to be the repositories \r\nof moral greatness, truth and freedom, and disrespect \r\nthe historical, cultural and religious truths of other \r\nnations.  \r\n The United Nations as it is today reflects the \r\nunfair and inequitable power relations that exist in the \r\nworld. We have already said so. It is time to  \r\nre-establish the United Nations. It is time to prevent \r\nthe Organization from continuing to be a tool of \r\npowerful countries. It is time that it expresses the \r\ninterests of all countries, especially developing \r\ncountries. \r\n Mr. Sangqu (South Africa): My delegation \r\nthanks the Secretary-General for his report contained in \r\ndocument A/65/1. South Africa is of the view that the \r\ndebate on the report of the Secretary-General on the \r\nwork of the Organization is an apt way to start our \r\nactivities in the General Assembly, as it allows us to \r\ntake stock and reflect on the work we are doing as an \r\nOrganization, both as Member States and as the \r\nSecretariat. \r\n I wish to refer to the conclusion of the Secretary- \r\nGeneral that \r\n  “The Organization is more than just a \r\ncollection of buildings, a sequence of meetings, a set \r\nof reports and consultations or even a set of \r\nprinciples and programmes. Fundamentally, the \r\nOrganization is about its people” (A/65/1, para. 165). \r\n If indeed the Organization is about its people, it \r\nshould always reflect in its decisions and their \r\nimplementation the interests of the people, especially \r\nthe poorest of the poor. \r\n There are many important issues highlighted in \r\nthe report of the Secretary-General. But I will highlight \r\nonly three, namely, the implementation of \r\ncommitments, climate change and international peace \r\nand security. \r\n We have just concluded a successful High-level \r\nPlenary Meeting of the General Assembly on the \r\nintegrated and coordinated implementation of and \r\nfollow-up to the Millennium Summit, in which our \r\nleaders recommitted themselves to achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. In \r\nthis regard, it is crucial that international cooperation \r\nbe enhanced and global partnerships strengthened in \r\norder to achieve all eight MDGs by 2015. We repeat \r\nour call to all Member States to fulfil their \r\ncommitments, especially developed countries.  \r\n We hear too often of very generous pledges being \r\nmade, but the implementation of those commitments is \r\nlacking. Commitments and pledges are taken seriously \r\nby recipient Governments, which seriously rely on \r\nthem in their programmatic efforts to deliver much-\r\nneeded services to their peoples. For example, we have \r\ntaken note that the report of the Secretary-General \r\nstates that fewer than half of the member States of the \r\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and \r\nDevelopment have met their target of donating 0.15 to \r\n0.20 per cent of gross national income to the least \r\ndeveloped countries. \r\n Of equal concern to my delegation is the \r\nprojected official development assistance (ODA) \r\nshortfall of $16 billion committed to the African \r\ncontinent at the Group of Eight meeting at Gleneagles \r\nin 2005. The Secretary-General correctly observes that, \r\n“A decade of deep commitment to reform and political \r\nand economic stability is beginning to have an impact \r\non Africa’s development path” (ibid., para. 32). \r\nHowever, the report also notes the special needs of \r\nAfrica and the impact that the decline in ODA and \r\nreduced economic growth rate will have on addressing \r\nthese needs and challenges in Africa and on our hard-\r\nwon stability. \r\n We cannot agree more with the Secretary-General \r\nwhen he states that “Africa’s people need neither pity \r\nnor charity” (ibid., para. 35). In this relation, we need \r\n A/65/PV.26\r\n \r\n5 10-56786 \r\n \r\nsupport and tools to address the challenges that face us, \r\nnot only to improve the lives of all the people on our \r\ncontinent but also to ensure sustained stability and \r\neconomic growth. It is South Africa’s long-standing \r\nposition that the world cannot fully progress and \r\nachieve its potential if Africa is left behind. We remain \r\ncommitted to the goals and objectives of the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development, and we will \r\ncontinue to promote them during our participation at \r\nthe sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly and its \r\nMain Committees. \r\n One of the major challenges also identified in the \r\nSecretary-General’s report is climate change. The issue \r\nof climate change is among key issues on the agenda of \r\nthis Organization. We note the Secretary-General’s \r\nefforts to ensure that participation in the climate \r\nchange discourse is a strategic imperative for world \r\nleaders. My delegation supports the Copenhagen \r\nAccord, which contains the elements for a political \r\nagreement within the framework of the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change and can \r\nserve as the basis for a dual-track negotiating process. \r\nWe should build on the gains already achieved and \r\nenhance the momentum so as to arrive at a legally \r\nbinding agreement at the Conference on climate change \r\nto be held later this year in Mexico. \r\n All our efforts towards sustainable development \r\nwill only have marginal impact if we cannot ensure \r\npeace and security for our people. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral has correctly stated that the duty to maintain \r\ninternational peace and security through prevention, \r\ncontainment and the resolution of conflict is enshrined \r\nin the Charter of this Organization and is an integral \r\npart of its work. My delegation has noted with \r\nsatisfaction the efforts of the Secretary-General and the \r\nOrganization to assist with preventative diplomacy, \r\nincluding through mediation efforts and initiatives such \r\nas post-conflict peacebuilding and capacity-building, \r\nespecially in Africa and the Middle East. While \r\nprogress has been recorded in the efforts of the United \r\nNations to work with the African Union in support of \r\npeace efforts on our continent, much more still remains \r\nto be done in implementing the Prodi report on Chapter \r\nVIII of the Charter. \r\n This year marks the fiftieth anniversary of \r\nresolution 1514 (XV) on the granting of independence \r\nto colonial countries and peoples. That resolution \r\nasserted the inalienable right of countries and peoples \r\nto complete freedom, the universal respect for human \r\nrights and the right to self determination. South Africa \r\nregrets the fact that the promise contained in the \r\nUnited Nations Charter and that resolution has not \r\nbeen fully realized in Africa with respect to Western \r\nSahara, the last remaining colony on the continent of \r\nAfrica. The people of Western Sahara are entitled to \r\nfully exercise their right to self-determination and \r\ndeserve nothing less. In that regard the United Nations \r\nmust play a meaningful role in ensuring that the people \r\nof Western Sahara exercise their right to self-\r\ndetermination. \r\n The United Nations must continue to work \r\ntowards the attainment of a lasting and peaceful \r\nsettlement in the Middle East. While the first few \r\nrounds of direct Israeli-Palestinian talks held during \r\nSeptember 2010 appeared to demonstrate a clear \r\nintention by both parties to effectively move the peace \r\nprocess forward, my Government has noted with \r\nserious concern that the partial moratorium imposed by \r\nthe Israeli Government in November 2009 on the \r\nfurther construction of Israeli settlements in the \r\noccupied Palestinian West Bank has not been renewed. \r\nWe call on the Israeli Government to honour its \r\nprevious international commitments by putting an end \r\nto all further settlement construction in the Palestinian \r\nWest Bank indefinitely. In so doing, Israel would \r\ndemonstrate its serious intention to bring about the \r\nestablishment of a viable and fully independent \r\nPalestinian State, existing side by side in peace with \r\nIsrael within internationally recognized borders. The \r\npeople of Palestine have for too long had their dreams \r\ndashed by half-hearted measures and by each new \r\npeace process that fails to deliver a viable and fully \r\nindependent Palestinian State. \r\n In our view, the Organization is in desperate need \r\nof reform in order to be more effective and efficient in \r\nresponding to matters relating to international peace \r\nand security. In this connection, we must continue our \r\nefforts to revitalize the General Assembly. \r\n We acknowledge the increased cooperation \r\nbetween this body and the Security Council and \r\nencourage the Organization to continue to strengthen \r\nits efforts to respond to matters of international \r\nconcern, including peace and security. We do not wish \r\nto see the General Assembly usurp the mandate of the \r\nSecurity Council, but we do believe that the Security \r\nCouncil — working hand in hand with the General \r\nAssembly — can respond more effectively to \r\ninternational crises. \r\nA/65/PV.26  \r\n \r\n10-56786 6 \r\n \r\n We believe that a comprehensive reform of the \r\nSecurity Council is necessary and urgent. Africa and \r\nLatin America have waited too long to gain permanent \r\nrepresentation. The Security Council must therefore \r\nexpand in both its categories, especially the permanent \r\none, in order to redress that historical injustice. \r\n We have just completed the general debate \r\nsegment of the sixty-fifth session of the General \r\nAssembly. The theme for the debate was “Reaffirming \r\nthe central role of the United Nations in global \r\ngovernance”. South Africa reiterates its commitment to \r\nthe principle of multilateralism and the central role that \r\nthe United Nations plays in global governance. As \r\nMember States, we must redouble our efforts to ensure \r\nthat all the principal organs of the Organization are \r\nfocused on addressing the needs of our people, \r\nespecially the most vulnerable. \r\n In conclusion, my delegation wishes to thank the \r\nSecretary-General and the Secretariat for their services \r\nto the Organization, and we convey to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, the Secretariat, the President of this Assembly \r\nand all Member States our commitment to ensuring \r\nthat we progress closer to our shared goal of achieving \r\na better world for all. \r\n Mr. Sinhaseni (Thailand): First of all, I would \r\nlike to add my voice to those thanking the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report (A/65/1). Thailand had studied \r\nthe report carefully. We agree with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s assessment that the global recovery we are \r\nexperiencing is fragile and uneven and that it requires \r\npolitical will and leadership to enhance the well-being \r\nof all, especially the poor and the vulnerable. \r\n Thailand believes that multilateralism is not an \r\noption but a must, if we are to realize our common \r\ngoals. The United Nations, with its universal \r\nmembership, can and should do more to provide global \r\nleadership and coordinate global actions. In that \r\nregard, as reflected in the statement of Thailand’s \r\nForeign Minister during the general debate, Thailand \r\nwill continue to be a strong supporter of the United \r\nNations in pursuing our common goals, consistent with \r\nthe principles enshrined in the Charter. Furthermore, \r\nthrough our active participation in the Association of \r\nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and other \r\nmultilateral forums, we will ensure that that message \r\nresonates within our region and beyond. \r\n Thailand would like to take this opportunity to \r\nshare our views on some issues that we feel are critical. \r\nFirst, on development, we are concerned that the \r\nimpacts of the recent global financial and economic \r\ncrisis may derail progress towards achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) in many \r\ncountries around the world. The recent global financial \r\ncrisis reminds us that development should be \r\nmeasured, not by nominal growth numbers, but rather \r\nby its ability to achieve balanced, inclusive, green and \r\nintegrated growth, where extra care is given to the \r\ndisadvantaged and the vulnerable. In that connection, \r\nThailand encourages the United Nations to accelerate \r\nits efforts to promote achievement of the MDGs by \r\n2015, with people-centred development, moderation in \r\nconsumption and optimal use of resources as guiding \r\nprinciples. \r\n Of the eight MDGs, we feel that international \r\ncooperation, as called for in MDG 8, is most crucial to \r\nensure the realization of the MDGs by 2015. \r\nInternational cooperation must be demand-oriented. It \r\nshould take into account local conditions and facilitate \r\ntransfer of knowledge and technology. Additionally, \r\nregional cooperation, as well as enhanced partnership \r\nbetween the United Nations and regional and \r\nsubregional groups, should further accelerate the \r\nachievement of the MDGs. \r\n In South-East Asia, ASEAN integration, through \r\nenhanced connectivity of physical infrastructure, \r\ninstitutions and people, is expected to narrow \r\ndevelopment gaps and promote local socio-economic \r\nempowerment. Furthermore, the entry into force of the \r\nChiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization Agreement \r\nand the creation of a regional economic surveillance \r\nmechanism are two notable examples of regional \r\ncooperation aimed at helping to ensure economic \r\ngrowth and resilience. While committed to a strong and \r\nfully integrated ASEAN, Thailand continues to call for \r\nand promote closer and action-oriented partnership \r\nbetween ASEAN and the United Nations, especially on \r\nsocial and economic development. \r\n Secondly, on peace and security, Thailand \r\ncommends the efforts of the United Nations in the past \r\nyear in the areas of conflict prevention, peacekeeping \r\nand peacebuilding. We would like to stress that close \r\nconsultations between the United Nations and \r\nconcerned Member States, as well as ownership in both \r\nthe process and the outcome, are crucial to achieving \r\nsustainable peace on the ground. Any intervention by \r\nthe United Nations should be guided by the needs and \r\nconsent of the host country. \r\n A/65/PV.26\r\n \r\n7 10-56786 \r\n \r\n Regarding disarmament, Thailand commends the \r\nSecretary-General for convening the recent high-level \r\nmeeting on revitalizing the work of the conference on \r\ndisarmament and taking forward multilateral \r\ndisarmament negotiations and hopes that the \r\nConference will soon make progress on substantive \r\nissues. We also reiterate the call for expansion of the \r\nmembership of the Conference on Disarmament and \r\nthe appointment of a special coordinator on expansion \r\nof the membership of the Conference for 2011. \r\n Thirdly, human rights form a core principle of the \r\nThai Government and its foreign policy. We believe \r\nthat only engagement and dialogue can make a real \r\nimpact on improving people’s lives and can ultimately \r\nhelp pave the way towards peace. The creation of the \r\nASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human \r\nRights reflects our region’s determination to promote \r\nand protect human rights. United Nations support for \r\nthat effort can further advance the cause of human \r\nrights within the region and beyond. \r\n As the report by the Secretary-General rightly \r\nstates, women are one of the greatest forces for \r\npositive change in the world. In that regard, Thailand \r\nwelcomes the creation of UN Women and is confident \r\nthat, under the leadership of Her Excellency Ms. \r\nMichelle Bachelet, marked improvement in global \r\ngender equality and women’s empowerment will be \r\nmade. \r\n On a related note, Thailand also commends the \r\nUnited Nations initiative to ensure more equitable \r\ngender representation within the United Nations \r\nsystem. \r\n For our part, Thailand has done what it can to \r\ncontribute to international human rights norm-setting, \r\nan example of which has already been recommended \r\nby the Economic and Social Council for adoption at the \r\ncurrent session of the General Assembly. Through the \r\ninitiative of Her Royal Highness Princess \r\nBajrakitiyabha Mahidol’s draft United Nations Rules \r\nfor the Treatment of Women Prisoners and  \r\nNon-custodial Measures for Women Offenders, soon to \r\nbe submitted by the Third Committee to the Assembly \r\nfor adoption, we hope that the specific needs of women \r\nprisoners, not only in Thailand but also in correctional \r\nfacilities throughout the world, will be catered to. \r\n Fourthly, on the work of the Organization, \r\nThailand believes that Member States should be closely \r\nconsulted and kept informed about the work and \r\ninitiatives of the Secretariat, United Nations mandate \r\nholders, agencies, funds and programmes, on a regular \r\nbasis and in a transparent manner, especially when \r\nchanges involve the creation of new mandates, the \r\nexpansion of existing mandates, the initiation of new \r\nconcepts and the definition of their application. \r\nWithout a common understanding on the way forward \r\nand the direction of the Organization and without \r\ngeneral support of the United Nations membership, \r\ndespite good intentions, such changes could bring \r\nunintended consequences and might be detrimental to \r\nthe overall work of the Organization. \r\n Lastly, Thailand agrees with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that the United Nations must adapt to the new \r\nenvironment by becoming more efficient, effective and \r\nmore accountable, while at the same time ensuring \r\ncoherence and coordination among all relevant \r\nagencies in the system. Nevertheless, the United \r\nNations cannot, and should not, do everything. The \r\nUnited Nations must prioritize its work and \r\nresponsibilities and work closely with Member States \r\nand partners in all of the various sectors. \r\n Mr. Elshareef (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I should like to express our deep thanks and \r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for his annual \r\nreport on the work of the Organization, as contained in \r\ndocument A/65/1. We appreciate the efforts of the \r\nSecretary-General across a range of areas, especially \r\nnow that our world is facing various challenges. \r\n The report mentions what has been achieved by \r\nthe Organization in many fields, such as work to \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \r\nand other internationally agreed development goals. \r\nHowever, there are great disparities between countries \r\nin that respect, and in order to realize the MDGs, the \r\ninternational community must fulfil its commitment to \r\nexpedite progress towards that end. \r\n In the area of peacekeeping, we underscore the \r\npositive cooperation and the valuable contributions of \r\nthe United Nations through its two Missions in the \r\nSudan, the African Union-United Nations Hybrid \r\nOperation in Darfur and the United Nations Mission in \r\nthe Sudan — especially for their contributions during \r\nthe elections held last April, among the various \r\ninternational efforts taking place in the country. We \r\nalso appreciate the announcement and the will shown \r\nby the United Nations and the international community \r\nto cooperate in order to ensure the success of the \r\nA/65/PV.26  \r\n \r\n10-56786 8 \r\n \r\nreferendum on self-determination in Southern Sudan to \r\nbe held in January 2011. \r\n On this occasion, we call on the United Nations \r\nand the international community to fulfil their promises \r\nto support all of the efforts to implement the remaining \r\nparts of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement and to \r\nsupport the peace process in Darfur. In this respect, we \r\ncommend the constructive cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and the African Union, on the one \r\nhand, and my country on the other hand, with a view to \r\novercoming all of the obstacles and to enhancing \r\nconstructive consultations between the Sudan as the \r\nhost country and all of the participating parties in order \r\nto fulfil the mandate of the Mission. Here, I am \r\nreferring to the various meetings of the tripartite \r\nmechanism, which comprises the United Nations, the \r\nAfrican Union and the Sudan and last met here in New \r\nYork on 27 September 2010 to discuss the situation of \r\nthe Mission, with the participation of the Under-\r\nSecretaries-General for Peacekeeping Operations and \r\nField Support, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Sudan and the \r\nrepresentatives of the African Union. In that context, \r\nall of the participants at that meeting commended the \r\nspirit of cooperation shown by the competent \r\nauthorities in my country in assisting in the \r\nimplementation of the Mission’s mandate, and stressed \r\nthe need to strengthen mechanisms for cooperation and \r\nconsultation. \r\n We also wish to note that, by virtue of that \r\ncooperation, Mission deployment has now passed 80 \r\nper cent, and marked improvement has been seen in the \r\nsecurity and humanitarian situation in Darfur. \r\n With reference to what is mentioned at the end of \r\nparagraph 54 of the report of the Secretary-General \r\nunder consideration: \r\n “restrictions on the freedom of movement of the \r\nAfrican Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation \r\nin Darfur continued to hamper the Operation’s \r\nability to implement its mandate” (A/65/1, \r\n para. 54). \r\n This situation is the result of incidents that affect \r\nsome of the work owing to the prevalence of criminals, \r\nbandits and members of the rebel movements, which \r\nhave splintered. This requires certain security \r\nprecautions to be taken in order to safeguard the \r\ninterests of the Missions, as well as their personnel, \r\nand of other humanitarian organizations working in \r\nDarfur, so that they are not subject to kidnapping and \r\nany aggressive acts against them and their property. \r\n My Government reaffirms its commitment not to \r\nhamper the work of the Mission and reiterates its \r\ncommitment to cooperate fully with all parties and \r\nstakeholders concerned to fulfil the mandate of the \r\nMission. We also wish to stress that negotiations in the \r\npeace process are continuing in Doha, Qatar. From this \r\nrostrum, we reiterate our invitation and call upon the \r\nUnited Nations and the international community to \r\nexert pressure on the rebel movements that have \r\nrefused to participate in the Doha peace negotiations to \r\nensure that peace prevails throughout Darfur.  \r\n In conclusion, allow me to emphasize my \r\ncountry’s principled position to achieve peace and to \r\nconduct the referendum on the date stipulated in the \r\nComprehensive Peace Agreement. We also call on the \r\ninternational community and the United Nations to \r\nfulfil their obligations to the peace process and support \r\nthe negotiations in order to achieve stability in my \r\ncountry. We reiterate our thanks and appreciation to the \r\nSecretary-General for all of the efforts exerted in the \r\nvarious fields covered in the report. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on the observer of the Observer State of the Holy \r\nSee. \r\n Archbishop Chullikatt (Holy See): The past \r\nyear has seen an increase in the number of challenges, \r\nboth at the United Nations and within the greater \r\nglobal community, but my delegation remains hopeful \r\nthat this Organization will respond to its Charter \r\nresponsibilities and commit itself to taking decisive \r\naction in fulfilling its purposes as spelled out in Article 1. \r\n Today, as the international financial and \r\neconomic crisis is beginning to show signs of recovery, \r\nmany of the poorest within society still remain beyond \r\nthe reach of its benefits, and an additional 64 million \r\npeople will fall into extreme poverty by the end of the \r\nyear. This challenge calls for a new focus by the \r\ninternational community and a return to authentic \r\nhumanitarian programmes and financial systems that \r\nplace people at the centre rather than forcing them to \r\nserve the programmes and systems. \r\n The financial crisis has proved to be a growing \r\nchallenge to the efforts of developed countries to fund \r\ntheir official development assistance commitments and \r\nat the same time provide programmes to rebuild and \r\n A/65/PV.26\r\n \r\n9 10-56786 \r\n \r\nrenew their own financial and labour markets. While \r\nthat challenge is real, it is not insurmountable, if \r\nnations would move resources from programmes \r\ndesigned to destroy to those that foster life and \r\ndevelopment. This task is in fact within the capacity of \r\nthe Members of this noble Organization. \r\n In 2007, $1.3 trillion was spent globally on arms \r\nand other military expenditures, and that figure \r\nincreased in 2009 during a global economic crisis to \r\nover $1.5 trillion. The limitless ability to find funds for \r\nmilitary programmes highlights yet again the need for \r\nindividuals and governmental leaders to refocus their \r\npriorities and financial commitments.  \r\n Those expenditures are even more troubling when \r\nwe consider the facts that over 1.4 billion people in the \r\nworld live on less than $1.25 per day, even though this \r\ncould be remedied; that universal primary education \r\nremains unattained, even though that too could be \r\naddressed; and that access to clean drinking water and \r\nsanitation continues to go unmet, even though the \r\ncapacity to provide remains within our grasp. Midway \r\nto the ambitious goal of 2015, as we discuss the need \r\nto find adequate funding sources for the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, we must acknowledge that \r\ntransferring financial resources from military \r\nprogrammes to those that promote long-term \r\nsustainable development has become an urgent matter. \r\nSuch spending demonstrates that development, peace \r\nand security are inherently interlinked.  \r\n While United Nations efforts to engage in \r\npreventive diplomacy and respond to crises have \r\nprovided some welcomed successes, those successes \r\nwill prove to be only temporary if governmental \r\nleaders and the United Nations bodies are unwilling to \r\nfind ways to fulfil their responsibility to protect and \r\ngive all nations an effective voice directed towards the \r\nbetterment of all members of the human family.  \r\n The increasingly interconnected nature of the \r\ninternational community requires an international \r\npolitical authority that is capable of focusing \r\ninternational cooperation and responding to economic \r\ncrisis in such a way as to avoid deterioration of the \r\npresent crisis and the greater imbalances that could \r\nresult. It must also seek to bring about integral and \r\ntimely disarmament, food security and peace, \r\nguarantee protection of the environment and regulate \r\nmigration. Such a body must be regulated by the \r\nprinciples of just laws, subsidiarity, solidarity and \r\npursuit of the common good, while at the same time \r\nmaking a commitment to secure authentic integral \r\nhuman development inspired by the values of charity in \r\ntruth — a truth that respects every member of the \r\nhuman family. \r\n Promoting human and economic development and \r\ngreater cooperation between States also requires a \r\ncommitment to fundamental and authentic human \r\nrights that respect the true nature of the human person. \r\nChief among those rights is the fundamental right to \r\nlife. Population measures and health services that fail \r\nto recognize the right to life and the right to establish \r\nand raise a family undermine the inherent dignity of \r\nthe human person. Concepts of reproductive health and \r\nsexual rights that incorporate access to abortion or \r\nother forms of life-destroying services or research \r\nfoster the flawed logic of a culture of death instead of \r\none that respects and embraces life and a better more \r\nsustainable future of humankind. \r\n In addition, human rights must recognize the \r\ninherent social and spiritual nature of the human \r\nperson and respect the rights of individuals to practise \r\nfreely their faith. Religious freedom encompasses more \r\nthan the mere toleration of religion and religious \r\nbeliefs but also requires the freedom to worship and \r\nexpress one’s faith publicly within society. In that \r\nlight, religious intolerance and violence in the name of \r\nreligion or in the name of God must be condemned. It \r\nis therefore important that concepts such as the \r\ndefamation of religion be re-examined so as to ensure \r\nthat religious intolerance and incitement to violence \r\nare rightly condemned without hindering the right to \r\ngenuine religious freedom, which is beneficial to all. \r\n The need to extend universally humanity’s ability \r\nto care for one another is also an important means for \r\nallowing global neighbours to become worldwide \r\nbrothers and sisters. In that regard, my delegation calls \r\nfor universal solidarity in favour of those most in need. \r\nToday, international emergencies around the world \r\nreceive financial and technical assistance from all \r\ncorners of the globe. As the response to the earthquake \r\nin Haiti and the floods in Pakistan demonstrates, the \r\ninternational community, when it has good intentions \r\nand commits itself, can make the world a smaller place, \r\ncapable of caring for people in any corner of the globe. \r\n In coordinating those responses, the United \r\nNations system and national political leaders play an \r\nimportant role in ensuring that aid reaches those most \r\nA/65/PV.26  \r\n \r\n10-56786 10 \r\n \r\nin need in the most effective manner possible. \r\nHowever, that coordination must also recognize the \r\nparticular role of local and faith-based providers in \r\nresponding to emergency situations. Those \r\norganizations’ long-term commitment to and activity \r\nwithin affected communities provide understanding of \r\nlocal needs and foster respect for local customs and \r\ntraditions. \r\n The United Nations has made important \r\ncontributions to fostering development and greater \r\npeace and security. However, the Organization must \r\ncontinue to revitalize its work, so as to be more \r\ncapable of responding to the future needs of the \r\ninternational community in a manner consistent with \r\nthe purposes as set out in the Charter. During the past \r\nyear the United Nations system responded to a number \r\nof difficult humanitarian emergencies, the International \r\nCriminal Court nearly finalized an amendment on the \r\ncrime of aggression, progress was made on nuclear \r\ndisarmament, and negotiations on an arms trade treaty \r\nbegan. However, those welcome developments were \r\naccompanied by the lack of a final outcome from the \r\nCopenhagen Conference on Climate Change, the \r\nlagging global financial recovery, continuing nuclear \r\nproliferation in defiance of national and global \r\nsecurity, and ongoing violence in many corners of the \r\nworld. The Holy See reiterates its commitment to the \r\nprinciples and ideals set down at the foundation of the \r\nUnited Nations and will continue to work to ensure that \r\nthe Organization will increasingly serve as a sign of \r\nunity between States and an instrument of service to \r\nthe entire human family. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): We \r\nhave heard the last speaker in the debate on this item. \r\n May I take it that the General Assembly takes \r\nnote of the report of the Secretary-General on the work \r\nof the Organization contained in document A/65/1? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly has thus concluded this stage of its agenda \r\nitem 108. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 3 (continued) \r\n \r\nCredentials of representatives to the sixty-fifth \r\nsession of the General Assembly \r\n \r\n (a) Appointment of the members of the Credentials \r\nCommittee \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): Rule \r\n28 of the rules of procedure provides that the General \r\nAssembly at the beginning of each session shall \r\nappoint, on the proposal of the President, a Credentials \r\nCommittee consisting of nine members. \r\n Accordingly, it is proposed that, for the sixty-fifth \r\nsession, the Credentials Committee should consist of \r\nthe following Member States: the Bahamas, China, \r\nFinland, Gabon, Guatemala, Kenya, the Russian \r\nFederation, Singapore and the United States of \r\nAmerica. \r\n May I take it that these States that I have just \r\nmentioned are hereby appointed members of the \r\nCredentials Committee? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n  The meeting rose at 4.15 p.m. \r\n"
