" United Nations  A/65/PV.27\r\n  \r\n \r\nGeneral Assembly \r\nSixty-fifth session \r\n \r\n27th plenary meeting \r\nFriday, 8 October 2010, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York \r\n \r\nOfficial Records\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the interpretation of \r\nspeeches delivered in the other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original \r\nlanguages only. They should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature \r\nof a member of the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room \r\nU-506. Corrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum. \r\n10-57241 (E) \r\n*1057241*   \r\nPresident: Mr. Deiss . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Switzerland) \r\n \r\n \r\n  In the absence of the President, Mr. Ndong Mba \r\n(Equatorial Guinea), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 133 \r\n \r\nScale of assessments for the apportionment of the \r\nexpenses of the United Nations \r\n \r\n  Report of the Fifth Committee (A/65/492) \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): If \r\nthere is no proposal under rule 66 of the rules of \r\nprocedure, may I take it that the Assembly decides not \r\nto discuss the report of the Fifth Committee that is \r\nbefore it? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): \r\nStatements will therefore be limited to explanations of \r\nvote. The positions of delegations regarding the \r\nrecommendation of the Fifth Committee have been \r\nmade clear in the Committee and are reflected in the \r\nrelevant official records. \r\n I remind members that, under paragraph 7 of \r\ndecision 34/401, the General Assembly agreed that \r\nwhen the same draft resolution is considered in a Main \r\nCommittee and in plenary meeting a delegation should, \r\nas far as possible, explain its vote only once, either in \r\nthe Committee or in the plenary meeting, unless that \r\ndelegation’s vote in plenary meeting is different from \r\nits vote in the Committee. I remind delegations that, \r\nalso in accordance with General Assembly decision \r\n34/401, explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes. \r\n Before we begin to take action on the \r\nrecommendation contained in the report, I should like \r\nto inform representatives that we are going to proceed \r\nto take a decision in the same manner as in the Fifth \r\nCommittee. \r\n The Assembly will now take a decision on the \r\ndraft resolution recommended by the Fifth Committee \r\nin paragraph 6 of its report. The Committee adopted \r\nthe draft resolution, entitled “Scale of assessments for \r\nthe apportionment of the expenses of the United \r\nNations: requests under Article 19 of the Charter”, \r\nwithout a vote. May I take it that the Assembly wishes \r\nto do the same? \r\n The draft resolution was adopted (resolution \r\n65/3). \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 133. \r\n \r\nAgenda items 71 and 72 \r\n \r\nReport of the International Criminal Tribunal for the \r\nProsecution of Persons Responsible for Genocide and \r\nOther Serious Violations of International \r\nHumanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of \r\nRwanda and Rwandan Citizens Responsible for \r\nGenocide and Other Such Violations Committed in \r\nthe Territory of Neighbouring States between \r\n1 January and 31 December 1994 \r\n \r\nA/65/PV.27  \r\n \r\n10-57241 2 \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/65/188) \r\n \r\nReport of the International Tribunal for the \r\nProsecution of Persons Responsible for Serious \r\nViolations of International Humanitarian Law \r\nCommitted in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia \r\nsince 1991 \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/65/205) \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): May I \r\ntake it that it is the wish of the Assembly to take note \r\nof the fifteenth annual report of the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): May I \r\ntake it that it is the wish of the Assembly to take note \r\nof the seventeenth annual report of the International \r\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I call \r\non Mr. Dennis Byron, President of the International \r\nTribunal for Rwanda. \r\n Mr. Byron: It is a great honour for me to address \r\nthe members of the General Assembly today and to \r\npresent the fifteenth annual report of the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda (A/65/188). Let me \r\ncommence by extending my congratulations and best \r\nwishes to His Excellency Joseph Deiss of Switzerland \r\non his election to the presidency of the Assembly. \r\n In Arusha and The Hague, we have a year of hard \r\nwork behind us, but I am pleased to report significant \r\nprogress in the completion of our mandate as a result. \r\nWe have been able to achieve that progress despite \r\nmajor obstacles, in particular with regard to staffing. \r\n Over the last year, the Tribunal was highly \r\nproductive in the delivery of judgements. The \r\nChambers rendered seven trial and four appeal \r\njudgements during the reporting period — that is, from \r\nJuly 2009 to June 2010 — and an additional trial \r\njudgement was delivered in August. We expect three \r\nmore trial judgements and up to four more appeal \r\njudgements before the end of this year.  \r\n In addition to the judgements, the Trial and \r\nAppeals Chambers issued almost 400 written and \r\nnumerous oral decisions and orders. The delivery of \r\nthe judgements in all the ongoing or commencing cases \r\nat trial level is expected before the end of 2011. \r\n The workload is high and is shared equally \r\namong the permanent and ad litem judges in the Trial \r\nChambers. I have raised the issue of the inequality of \r\ntheir terms and conditions of service with the \r\nAssembly before. It is a major concern for the Tribunal. \r\nThe work and the commitment of the ad litem judges \r\nhave been and continue to be indispensable to the \r\nsuccessful and timely completion of our work. Without \r\nthem, we could not have achieved what we did. \r\n We very much welcome the resolution of March \r\n2010 to resolve the issue as a priority of the General \r\nAssembly at the main part of its sixty-fifth session \r\n(resolution 64/261). While that issue will soon be \r\nbefore the Fifth Committee, I ask members and their \r\nGovernments for support in the matter to provide for \r\nequity and to ensure that the work of the Tribunal can \r\nbe successfully completed. \r\n Like every other court, national or international, \r\nthe Tribunal’s achievements will ultimately be judged \r\non the quality of its trials and judgements and on the \r\nefficiency of its judicial management. We continue to \r\nwork hard with respect to both aspects, but in all our \r\nefforts we face one main stumbling block — the \r\nstaffing situation. We continue to lose many of our best \r\nand most experienced staff members. One hundred and \r\nsixty-seven staff members left the Tribunal during the \r\nreporting period. They often leave for other institutions \r\nin the same field, where they can obtain longer-term \r\ncontracts. \r\n In Chambers, to give an example, three of the \r\nfour multi-accused cases have lost their coordinators \r\nover the past few months, just a couple of months \r\nahead of the expected judgement delivery. It is almost \r\nunavoidable that such departures, with their consequent \r\nloss of institutional memory, result in delays in the \r\njudgement drafting process. We cannot replace those \r\nstaff members easily. We face difficulties attracting a \r\nsufficient number of good candidates with what we can \r\noffer, which is mostly temporary contracts. That is \r\nparticularly relevant for the higher ranks of P-4 and \r\nP-5 positions. The remaining staff face the uncertainty \r\nof their professional future, which affects their morale \r\nand productivity. \r\n Let me now turn to the issue of fugitives. The \r\nOffice of the Prosecutor and its tracking team, in \r\ncooperation with the national authorities, were able to \r\nensure the arrest of one fugitive — Jean Bosco \r\nUwinkindi — in Uganda. His case is one of those \r\n A/65/PV.27\r\n \r\n3 10-57241 \r\n \r\nearmarked for referral to a national jurisdiction. While \r\nseveral options of possible referral countries are being \r\nexplored, the focus remains on Rwanda. The support \r\nactivities conducted by the Tribunal continue to further \r\nstrengthen the Rwandan judiciary, in particular with \r\nrespect to witness protection. \r\n The number of remaining fugitives is now down \r\nto 10. That number still includes three of the most \r\nhigh-ranked accused: Félicien Kabuga, Protais \r\nMpiranya and Augustin Bizimana. I therefore reiterate \r\nthe call to all States, especially the States of the Great \r\nLakes region, in particular Kenya, to intensify \r\ncooperation with the Tribunal and to render all \r\nnecessary assistance so that their arrest can be ensured \r\nsoon. Over 16 years have passed. We cannot wait any \r\nlonger for justice to be done. We must not give the fatal \r\nsignal to alleged perpetrators that their successful \r\nhiding for 16 years will ultimately be rewarded with \r\nimpunity. \r\n One focus of the work of the Registrar is the \r\nsearch for countries to relocate acquitted persons and \r\nthose who have served their sentences. Currently, three \r\nsuch persons remain in safe houses in Arusha. One has \r\nbeen there for over four years. We must be aware that a \r\nfull commitment to the rule of law includes the \r\nacceptance that those who have been lawfully acquitted \r\nor who have completed their sentence need to be \r\nenabled to recommence their life as free persons. I \r\nappeal for the support of Member Governments to \r\nmake that possible. \r\n The cooperation between States and the Tribunal \r\nis a two-way street. Over the past year, the Office of \r\nthe Prosecutor has responded to over 100 requests for \r\nmutual legal assistance in connection with proceedings \r\nthat national prosecuting authorities are conducting in \r\nrelation to crimes committed in Rwanda in 1994. The \r\nnumber of such requests continues to increase and the \r\nservices of the Tribunal to national prosecuting \r\nauthorities become more and more important, as it is \r\nthey who will bear the burden of continuing the fight \r\nagainst impunity after the Tribunal has closed down. \r\nWe therefore have to ensure that the residual \r\nmechanism will be in a position to continue with that \r\nessential support. \r\n The Tribunal has submitted its revised estimates \r\nfor the rest of the 2010-2011 biennium. Despite some \r\ndelays, the progress seen in our completion strategy is \r\nsignificant and the downsizing process is ongoing. \r\nTherefore, I am convinced that what we have achieved \r\nso far will give the Assembly the confidence and the \r\ntrust to provide us with the necessary resources to \r\ncomplete our mandate expeditiously during this and the \r\nnext biennium. \r\n The Security Council continues its discussions on \r\nthe structure and functioning of the residual \r\nmechanism for our Tribunal and our sister Tribunal in \r\nThe Hague. A resolution on that issue in the near future \r\nwill help us in preparing in the best possible manner \r\nfor a timely and smooth transition to that residual \r\nmechanism. The preparatory work is time- and \r\nresource-intensive, in particular with respect to the \r\narchives of the Tribunal. They will document our \r\nlegacy and will form part of the historical memory for \r\nthe Rwandans and indeed for the entire international \r\ncommunity. We have to ensure that they will be easily \r\naccessible in the future for all those who may be \r\ninterested, the general public and researchers. \r\n I should like to conclude by once again thanking \r\nMember Governments for the support they have \r\nprovided to the Tribunal over the past years. The \r\nAssembly has walked this path with us for over \r\n15 years, and we need its support in the last laps of this \r\njourney, in the interest of the victims and of \r\ninternational justice. We strive to earn that support with \r\nour unceasing committed efforts. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I thank the President \r\nof the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. \r\n I now call on Mr. Patrick Lipton Robinson, \r\nPresident of the International Tribunal for the Former \r\nYugoslavia. \r\n Mr. Robinson: At the outset, I wish to \r\ncongratulate the President on his assumption of the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly and to express my \r\ngratitude for his country’s steadfast support for the \r\nwork of the International Criminal Tribunal for the \r\nformer Yugoslavia. \r\n It is an honour to appear before the Assembly \r\ntoday in my capacity as President of the Tribunal and \r\nto present the Tribunal’s seventeenth annual report \r\n(A/65/205) to the General Assembly. \r\n During the reporting period, the Tribunal faced \r\nunprecedented challenges but also made unprecedented \r\nadvances in the implementation of its completion \r\nstrategy. \r\nA/65/PV.27  \r\n \r\n10-57241 4 \r\n \r\n Ten trials were conducted simultaneously in the \r\nTribunal’s three courtrooms, and the second of the \r\nTribunal’s three multiaccused trials, Prosecutor v. \r\nPopović et al., was brought to a close. The Tribunal has \r\nsucceeded in conducting proceedings in 10 trials \r\nconcurrently by doubling up judges and staff so that \r\nthey are working on more than one case. In addition, \r\nthe Tribunal also handled three contempt cases, \r\ndisposing of two. \r\n Currently there are nine trials ongoing, with a \r\ntenth case being returned to the pretrial stage following \r\nthe Appeals Chamber’s decision to grant the \r\nProsecution’s request for a retrial in the case of \r\nHaradinaj et al. It is anticipated that the Haradinaj \r\nretrial will commence in the new year. \r\n Judgements are anticipated to be delivered in the \r\nĐorđević trial next month and in the Gotovina et al. \r\ntrial the following month. An additional two trials — \r\nthat of Perišić and the final multiaccused case of Prlić \r\net al. — will conclude in 2011. Five trials, including \r\nthe Haradinaj retrial, are anticipated to conclude in \r\n2012, and the final case, that of Karadžić, should be \r\ncompleted towards the end of 2013. \r\n All appeals are still scheduled to be completed by \r\nthe end of 2014, although the recent unavoidable \r\ndelays in the Karadžić case suggest that that date has \r\nbecome exceedingly optimistic and will have to be \r\nreassessed at an appropriate time. \r\n In total, the Tribunal has completed proceedings \r\nin relation to 126 persons overall, with 13 cases \r\nremaining to be completed. \r\n The Tribunal continues to take all measures \r\npossible to expedite its trials, without sacrificing due \r\nprocess. However, as these anticipated completion \r\ndates show, the estimates for the completion of trials \r\nfrom the last reporting period have had to be \r\nsubstantially amended. That is the result of unforeseen \r\nfactors not immediately within the Tribunal’s control, \r\nincluding witness intimidation, failure of witnesses to \r\nappear, illness of accused, the complexities associated \r\nwith cases of self-represented accused, and staff \r\nattrition. Those factors are fully detailed in my report \r\nto the Security Council of May 2010 (S/2010/270, \r\nannex I). \r\n It must be underscored that the trial schedule \r\nproduced by the Tribunal is a forecast only and is \r\nestimated by reference to factors identified as falling \r\nwithin the Tribunal’s control. But there are important \r\ninfluences on the trial schedule that are not within the \r\nTribunal’s control.  \r\n To give but one example, earlier this year the \r\nnational authorities of Serbia discovered new evidence \r\nrelevant to at least six of the Tribunal’s cases, namely \r\n18 military notebooks of Ratko Mladić allegedly \r\nwritten during the period from 1991 to 1995. The \r\ndiscovery of that new evidence has the potential to \r\ndelay all of those trials and could not have been \r\nforeseen when the trial estimates were generated. For \r\nthe most part, it is not possible to ascertain the precise \r\nimpact of that new evidence, but it would seem that the \r\nminimum delay would be a period of about three \r\nmonths. \r\n But more generally, it has to be understood that \r\nassessments that are made prior to the commencement \r\nof a trial are really nothing more than guesstimates. For \r\nexample, the Trial Chamber in the Karadžić case, in \r\nassessing the time it would take to complete the trial, \r\nconsidered it a fair assessment to allocate to Karadžić \r\nthe same time for the cross-examination of Prosecution \r\nwitnesses as it allowed the Prosecution for its own \r\nexamination of its witness. However, the \r\nunprecedented volume of written material tendered \r\nthrough those witnesses has necessitated a significant \r\nincrease in the time allotted to Karadžić for cross-\r\nexamination, and that could not have been anticipated \r\nat an early stage of the proceedings.  \r\n That is the nature of trials, particularly trials of \r\nthe complexity of those heard at the Tribunal. It is \r\noften the case that assessments made with the best of \r\nintentions prior to the commencement of a trial are \r\nshown to have been overly optimistic once the trial has \r\ncommenced. There is nothing unusual about that. As I \r\nhave said on many previous occasions, the estimation \r\nof the length of trial and appeal proceedings is more an \r\nart than a science. That is something that the \r\ninternational community needs to respect. \r\n It has occurred to us at the Tribunal that the \r\nmisunderstanding that Member States have in respect \r\nof the time taken to complete the Tribunal’s mandate is \r\npartially, if not wholly, due to the novelty of the \r\nexercise in which the United Nations is now involved \r\nin relation to the Tribunal. In the past, the United \r\nNations has wound up administrative bodies such as \r\npeacekeeping operations. The Organization has \r\ntherefore developed a practice and a culture with \r\n A/65/PV.27\r\n \r\n5 10-57241 \r\n \r\nregard to exit strategies for such bodies. But the \r\nTribunal is not an administrative body. It is a court of \r\nlaw, and as such it will always be prone to a certain \r\ndegree of unforeseeability, which is a natural element \r\nin most kinds of judicial work, particularly in trials as \r\ncomplicated as those at the Tribunal.  \r\n The Tribunal cannot be wound up as though it \r\nwere a bakery producing bread. It can be wound up \r\nproperly only with appropriate sensitivity to the \r\njudicial character of its work. To apply to the Tribunal \r\nin this, the final stages of its life, the mindset and \r\nculture that are relevant to the closure of administrative \r\nbodies like peacekeeping operations is wholly wrong \r\nand, what is more, is bound to have an effect on the \r\nTribunal’s capacity, and indeed duty, to deliver justice \r\nin a fair and impartial manner, as will become apparent \r\nin what follows. \r\n However, I should also underscore that, when \r\ndelays are shown to be inevitable and fully justifiable, \r\njudges do not simply accept them as part and parcel of \r\nthe trial process. They proactively devise and \r\nimplement measures to reduce such delays by, for \r\nexample, increasing court hearings and reducing the \r\nnumber of witnesses to be heard in a case. For example, \r\nin the Karadžić case, the Trial Chamber has announced \r\nits intention to adopt measures to reduce the slippage \r\nresulting from its recent decision to allot more time to \r\nMr. Karadžić in the interests of fairness.  \r\n In that regard, I am bound to point out that judges, \r\nand in fact all staff at the Tribunal, feel the pressure of \r\nthe completion strategy and of the international \r\ncommunity to expedite the work of the Tribunal. And \r\nas a judge and as President of the Tribunal, I must say I \r\nfind that troubling. Judges are entitled to, and indeed \r\nmust work in, an environment free from all external \r\npressures, so that their judicial independence is not, \r\nand does not appear to be, compromised. In that regard, \r\nI note that motions have been filed by parties accusing \r\nthe judges of taking decisions for the sole purpose of \r\nexpediting the proceedings and in some cases alleging \r\nthat that was done in response to the completion \r\nstrategy and not on the basis of the merits of the case \r\nand without regard for the fairness of those \r\nproceedings. \r\n There are some other obvious causes of delay that \r\ncut across all the Tribunal’s trials, and some are simply \r\nunavoidable. First is the doubling up of judges and \r\nstaff. The scheduling of hearings, deliberations and \r\nconsultations has been complicated by the need to take \r\ninto account the competing obligations of judges and \r\nstaff to other cases. While the Tribunal has increased \r\nits trial capacity from conducting six trials \r\nsimultaneously to 10 trials, it has not seen a \r\ncomparative increase in its resources. \r\n Another factor that has impacted our work is the \r\nconstant departure of the Tribunal’s highly experienced \r\nstaff for more secure employment elsewhere. \r\nExperienced staff continue to leave at an alarming rate. \r\nIn Chambers alone, the Tribunal has witnessed a 21 per \r\ncent attrition rate. The impact of those departures on \r\nthe expeditious completion of the Tribunal’s trials and \r\nappeals is profound, and I have consistently warned the \r\nSecurity Council and the Assembly that the work of the \r\nTribunal will be protracted if we are unable to retain \r\nstaff and are forced to constantly recruit and train new \r\nstaff.  \r\n I have called upon the United Nations to assist \r\nthe Tribunal in devising incentives to retain its highly \r\nqualified staff. I have also identified measures that \r\ncould be taken to alleviate staff attrition rates. However, \r\nto date very little has been achieved. \r\n The General Assembly offered us a measure of \r\nhope through its adoption of resolution 63/256, in \r\nDecember 2008, which authorized the Tribunal to offer \r\ncontracts to staff in line with planned post reductions \r\nand the prevailing trial schedules. However, despite the \r\nclear language and intention of the resolution, it has \r\nnot been implemented, because the budgetary \r\nauthorities at United Nations Headquarters consider the \r\nTribunal incapable of offering contracts to staff that are \r\nnot tied to approved budgetary submissions.  \r\n In desperation, I made a direct plea for assistance \r\nto the Security Council in June of this year, and the \r\nCouncil responded by passing resolution 1931 (2010), \r\nwhich noted the importance of the Tribunal being \r\nadequately staffed to complete its work expeditiously \r\nand called upon the Secretariat and other relevant \r\nUnited Nations bodies to continue to work with the \r\nRegistrar of the Tribunal in order to find practicable \r\nsolutions to address the issue as the Tribunal \r\napproaches the completion of its work. \r\n In the meantime, the Tribunal is still pressing for \r\naction to be taken, as we continue to lose our highly \r\nexperienced and essential staff, and as the \r\nexpeditiousness of our proceedings continues to suffer \r\nfrom delays that could be avoided through urgent \r\nA/65/PV.27  \r\n \r\n10-57241 6 \r\n \r\naction by the international community to devise \r\nincentives encouraging our staff to remain with the \r\nTribunal until they are no longer necessary. \r\n I should add that the updated trial schedule has \r\nresulted in the Tribunal’s filing a supplementary budget, \r\nwhich is before the Assembly. In so doing, the Tribunal \r\nwas extremely sensitive to the current economic \r\nclimate, and has requested only that which it \r\nconsidered absolutely necessary in order to ensure that \r\nour expeditious operation is not compromised. In that \r\nregard, I note that the efficiency and productivity of the \r\nTribunal far surpass those of any other comparable \r\ninstitution, and that is despite the many challenges it \r\nhas faced during the reporting period. \r\n There is one final matter that I feel compelled to \r\nraise before the Assembly yet again. I refer to my \r\ncommitment as President of the Tribunal to ensuring \r\nthe establishment of a trust fund for victims from the \r\nformer Yugoslavia. The International Criminal Court \r\nand the 113 States that have ratified the Rome Statute \r\nhave demonstrated by their establishment of a trust \r\nfund for victims that they accept that justice must not \r\nonly be retributive, but that it must also be restorative \r\nif peace is to be lasting. It is my intention, as President \r\nof the Tribunal, to take action to end this travesty, and I \r\nhope that I will receive the Assembly’s support in \r\ndoing so. \r\n In closing, I wish to reassure all Member States \r\nthat the Tribunal’s commitment to the completion \r\nstrategy remains steadfast and that we are taking all \r\nmeasures within our power to expedite our proceedings, \r\nwhile still fully respecting the rights of the accused to \r\ndue process. I would also ask that all Member States \r\nreflect for a moment on the remarkable achievements \r\nof the Tribunal. It was not so long ago that \r\ninternational criminal justice was but a dream in the \r\nminds of those striving for a safer and more just world. \r\nBut now the dream has been realized. The Tribunal has \r\ndemonstrated to the international community that \r\ninternational humanitarian law is an enforceable body \r\nof law, that it binds the conduct of the most senior \r\nofficials, and that the rule of law is a living, breathing \r\nreality that forms part of the fabric of our civilization. \r\nThe Tribunal represents the aspirations of the \r\ninternational community to ensure that justice prevails \r\nover impunity, and that is something in which we all \r\nhave a stake. \r\n It is for these reasons that the work of the \r\nTribunal, which has been entrusted to us, is not only \r\nour work but in fact the work of everyone here today. I \r\ntherefore call on all States members of the General \r\nAssembly to assist us in our commitment to bringing \r\nthe work of the Tribunal to a close, expeditiously and \r\nfairly. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I thank \r\nthe President of the International Tribunal for the \r\nFormer Yugoslavia. \r\n Mr. Iddi (United Republic of Tanzania): Let me, \r\non behalf of my delegation, thank the Presidents of the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) \r\nand the International Tribunal for the Former \r\nYugoslavia (ICTY), Mr. Dennis Byron and Mr. Patrick \r\nRobinson, respectively, for their comprehensive reports \r\nto the Assembly. I should like to express my \r\nGovernment’s sincere appreciation for the enormous \r\nefforts that the two Presidents have made to spearhead \r\nthe work of the Tribunals to Member States’ \r\nsatisfaction. Tanzania fully appreciates the extent of \r\nthe accomplishments that the principals of the \r\nTribunals have been able to achieve over the past year, \r\ndespite all the odds, and we urge them to continue to \r\ndo so in the challenging times of transition to come. \r\n The reports of the Tribunals point to significant \r\nprogress over the past year, which, as I said, deserves \r\nour sincere appreciation. They reveal that the Tribunals \r\nhave continued their efforts to complete their \r\nremaining workload at both the trial and the appeal \r\nlevels, and have thus far succeeded significantly. \r\nWithout referring to the statistics, I also wish to \r\ncommend the Tribunals for their efforts to bring \r\nfugitives to book, and I wish to join the Tribunal \r\nPresidents in their call on Member States to continue \r\ncooperating in bringing to justice those fugitives who \r\nremain at large. Speaking for Tanzania, I can assure the \r\nAssembly that our Government will continue to extend \r\nthe necessary support to both the ICTR and the ICTY \r\nin whatever way we can. \r\n It is heartening to note that the Tribunals have \r\nmade important preparations as they head towards their \r\nconclusion, including those aimed at avoiding \r\nunnecessary gaps in the dispensation of international \r\ncriminal justice. For instance, in the case of the ICTR, \r\nthe diffusion of information about its activities has \r\nbeen enhanced. Outreach projects relating to youth \r\nsensitization and genocide prevention in the Great \r\n A/65/PV.27\r\n \r\n7 10-57241 \r\n \r\nLakes region have been made possible with the \r\ngenerous financial support of development partners. \r\nCapacity-building activities for legal professionals in \r\nRwanda are a good indication that there will be no gap \r\nafter the Tribunal concludes its work, as the national \r\nauthorities will be able to advance the disposition of \r\npending cases. We wish to thank all the development \r\npartners that have extended financial support to the \r\nTribunal, and urge others to follow suit. \r\n It is equally worth noting that the Tribunals have \r\nplayed an important role in fighting impunity and \r\npromoting the international cause of justice. As the \r\nhost country for the International Criminal Tribunal for \r\nRwanda, we have continued to facilitate its smooth \r\noperations in accordance with the provisions of the \r\nHeadquarters Agreement. We will continue to do so \r\nduring this stage of transition towards the conclusion \r\nof its mandate. \r\n However, we note with concern that the Tribunals \r\nhave faced numerous challenges in recent years, \r\nespecially in the difficult area of staffing. Some staff \r\nmembers have had to abandon their posts for more \r\nstable and reliable employment elsewhere in the United \r\nNations system. We would urge the General Assembly \r\nto pronounce on this delicate matter, which hampers a \r\nsmooth transition to the conclusion of the Tribunals’ \r\nmandate. \r\n Likewise, we note that the reports have revealed \r\nthat the Tribunals continued to be hampered by a \r\nshortage of volunteer countries to take acquitted \r\npersons and where convicted persons could serve their \r\nsentences. This is a serious problem that should be \r\naddressed jointly. We therefore call upon Member \r\nStates to consider accepting this noble responsibility. \r\n Another challenge facing the Tribunals is the fact \r\nthat a number of fugitives remain at large. We therefore \r\ncall upon Member States to continue to cooperate in \r\nsearch of all fugitives so that they can be brought \r\nbefore the Tribunals to face justice. Such cooperation \r\nwould go a long way towards preventing impunity and \r\nindeed send a strong message to perpetrators of crimes \r\nagainst humanity. By and large, it would enhance the \r\nfull realization of the celebrated principle of “extradite \r\nor prosecute”, and thus deny safe haven to perpetrators \r\nof heinous crimes. \r\n As rightly stated in the report of the ICTR, “State \r\ncooperation remains the cornerstone of the Tribunal’s \r\nability to complete its mandate” (A/65/188, para. 85). \r\nWe call upon Member States to provide such \r\ncooperation. We also urge Member States to consider \r\nextending cooperation with regard to acquitted and \r\nconvicted persons, and to continue to provide the \r\nTribunals with the necessary resources so that they are \r\nable to complete their work within the intended time \r\nframe. \r\n As the Tribunals draw closer to completing their \r\nmandates, the United Republic of Tanzania has been \r\nfollowing with great interest the deliberations of the \r\nSecurity Council Informal Working Group on \r\nInternational Tribunals, chaired by Austria, on the \r\nvarious options for the Tribunals’ residual mechanisms \r\nand archives. To this end, the Government of Tanzania \r\nconsiders that it would be desirable for sensitive \r\nrecords of the Tribunals containing confidential records \r\nto continue to be kept in a safe, peaceful, stable \r\nenvironment accessible to the United Nations and \r\nauthorized persons without administrative bottlenecks, \r\nsecurity concerns or political constraints. \r\n Tanzania is ready and willing to continue to host \r\nthe residual mechanism and the archives with the same \r\ndedication and commitment we have demonstrated \r\nthroughout the operation of the ICTR from its \r\ninception. We strongly believe that the infrastructure \r\nalready in place is suitable to maintain the records of \r\nthe Tribunal as an important historical learning \r\ninstitution for the benefit of our future generations. \r\n In conclusion, let me once again renew my \r\nGovernment’s commitment to the cause of \r\ninternational criminal justice by deed and action. We \r\nwill continue to provide the facilities necessary for the \r\nsmooth conclusion of the work of the ICTR, as well to \r\nensure that all issues relating to residual functions will \r\nbe handled with even greater care and due diligence in \r\nTanzania. We hope to be able to offer a helping hand as \r\nwe have always done. Together, we can overcome all \r\nof these hurdles. \r\n Mr. Grauls (Belgium): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the European Union. The candidate \r\ncountries Turkey, Croatia and the former Yugoslav \r\nRepublic of Macedonia; the countries of the \r\nStabilization and Association Process and potential \r\ncandidates Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and \r\nMontenegro; the European Free Trade Association \r\ncountry Liechtenstein, member of the European \r\nEconomic Area; as well as Ukraine, Armenia and \r\nGeorgia align themselves with this declaration. \r\nA/65/PV.27  \r\n \r\n10-57241 8 \r\n \r\n This year once again, the European Union \r\nreaffirms its unwavering support for the work of the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former \r\nYugoslavia. Both Tribunals are making invaluable \r\ncontributions to our shared goal of ending impunity for \r\nserious international crimes. The European Union \r\nthanks both President Robinson and President Byron \r\nfor their reports (A/65/205 and A/65/188) and \r\ncommends them for their efforts in completing the \r\nwork of the Tribunals. The European Union also pays \r\nspecial tribute to the work of all the staff of the \r\nTribunals. \r\n The Tribunals have played key roles in \r\nstrengthening the rule of law and promoting long-term \r\nstability and reconciliation — and not only in the \r\nBalkans and Rwanda. Their jurisprudence has had far \r\nwider effects. Since their establishment, both Tribunals \r\nhave embodied the need to fight impunity and the \r\ninternational community’s refusal to let perpetrators of \r\nthe most serious crimes of international concern escape \r\njustice. They have been forerunners in creating \r\njurisprudence that is a source of inspiration for all \r\nnational and international jurisdictions that will have to \r\naddress such crimes. Their records bear that out. \r\nInternational criminal justice does exist; it prevails, \r\nand sooner or later the perpetrators will be held \r\naccountable for their heinous crimes. \r\n The European Union recalls that State \r\ncooperation — in particular cooperation in bringing \r\nthose indicted to justice — remains the cornerstone of \r\nthe Tribunals’ ability to complete their mandates. In \r\nthis respect, the European Union commends the \r\ncooperation of the Democratic Republic of the Congo \r\nand the Ugandan authorities for the arrest and transfer \r\nto the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda \r\nduring the past year of Grégoire Ndahimana, \r\nIdelphonse Nizeyimana and Jean Bosco Uwinkindi.  \r\n However, despite continuing appeals by the \r\ninternational community, altogether 12 accused \r\nindividuals remain at large, of whom two have been \r\nindicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the \r\nFormer Yugoslavia and 10 have been indicted by the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. The \r\nfailure to arrest these indictees remains a matter of \r\ngrave concern to the European Union. Among those \r\nstill at large are five key indictees allegedly \r\nresponsible for the most serious atrocities, including \r\nRatko Mladić, Goran Hadžić and Félicien Kabuga. We \r\ncall on all States, and in particular States of the \r\nrelevant regions, to further intensify their efforts to \r\nensure that all indictees are arrested and surrendered to \r\nthe Tribunals. \r\n The European Union notes that the cooperation of \r\nSerbia, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina with the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former \r\nYugoslavia was generally adequate during the reporting \r\nperiod, although some important issues remain to be \r\naddressed. While there are many commendable \r\ninstances of cooperation, the European Union \r\ncontinues to urge all States to cooperate immediately \r\nand unconditionally with both Tribunals, in full \r\nadherence to their obligations under the relevant \r\nSecurity Council resolutions regarding the arrest and \r\nsurrender of remaining fugitives and the transfer of any \r\ndocuments requested by the Prosecutors. \r\n The European Union remains committed to \r\nensuring that all indictees face justice. In this regard, \r\nthe European Union would like to recall that \r\ncooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal \r\nfor the Former Yugoslavia is essential in relation to the \r\nEuropean Union’s Stabilization and Association \r\nProcess. \r\n With regard to the International Criminal \r\nTribunal for Rwanda, the European Union notes with \r\nappreciation that the Prosecutor has held fruitful high-\r\nlevel discussions with officials of several States on the \r\nissue of cooperation with his Office, but regrets that \r\ncooperation with Kenya remains a major challenge. \r\nThe European Union calls on the Kenyan authorities to \r\nengage in further discussions with the Prosecutor of the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, as offered \r\nby the Kenyan representative in the Security Council \r\ndebate of 18 June, on the present whereabouts of the \r\nfugitive Félicien Kabuga (see S/PV.6342). \r\n In recognition of strengthened domestic capacity, \r\nthe Security Council, in its resolutions 1503 (2003) and \r\n1534 (2004), called on the International Criminal \r\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda to transfer \r\nall lower- and mid-level accused to competent national \r\njurisdictions for trial by domestic courts. The European \r\nUnion welcomes the ongoing efforts of Rwanda, in \r\ncooperation with international donors, to strengthen the \r\nRwandan legal system and its ability to adjudicate \r\ncases from the International Criminal Tribunal for \r\nRwanda, and expresses the hope that these reforms will \r\n A/65/PV.27\r\n \r\n9 10-57241 \r\n \r\npermit the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda \r\nto transfer the cases of lower-level accused to the \r\nRwandan courts for trial and thus allow the Tribunal to \r\ncomplete its work. The European Union confirms its \r\ncommitment to supporting activities aimed at \r\nstrengthening the capacity of the Rwandan judiciary. \r\n The European Union regrets that there has been \r\nfurther slippage in the completion timelines due to a \r\nnumber of factors, some outside the Tribunal’s control, \r\nincluding the late capture and transfer of fugitive \r\nindictees. The European Union urges the Tribunals to \r\ncontinue to identify further measures that will allow \r\nthem to complete their work as efficiently and \r\npromptly as possible. However, the completion of the \r\nTribunals’ work should be done in an orderly manner \r\nand not affect the quality of their adjudication and due \r\nprocess. We acknowledge the importance of adequate \r\nresources and of retaining qualified staff to enable the \r\nTribunals to complete their proceedings as soon as \r\npossible. However, at the same time, it is important \r\nthat the Tribunals use their available resources as \r\nefficiently as possible. \r\n The European Union further welcomes the \r\nprogress made on residual issues by the Security \r\nCouncil’s Informal Working Group on International \r\nTribunals, including the preparation of a draft \r\nresolution and draft statute on the establishment of a \r\nresidual mechanism. We highly value the open and \r\ntransparent work of the Informal Working Group on \r\nthose issues, under its Austrian chairmanship. We stand \r\nready to work with the Security Council to find the \r\nmost appropriate and cost-effective solutions to the \r\nissues of legacy and residual functions. The European \r\nUnion also supports the idea of the establishment of \r\ninformation centres in the countries of the former \r\nYugoslavia and in Rwanda to facilitate access to the \r\npublic records of the Tribunals by the interested public. \r\n Ms. Robertson (Australia): It is my honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of Canada, Australia and New Zealand \r\n(CANZ). Canada, Australia and New Zealand wish to \r\ntake this opportunity to reaffirm our strong support for \r\nthe International Criminal Tribunal for the Former \r\nYugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Criminal \r\nTribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). We thank Judge \r\nRobinson and Judge Byron for being present here \r\ntoday and for providing the comprehensive overview of \r\nthe reports of their respective Tribunals to us \r\n(A/65/205 and A/65/188). \r\n We believe that the Tribunals and the \r\ninternational community can be proud of the many \r\nachievements the Tribunals have achieved to date. The \r\nTribunals have made an unprecedented contribution to \r\nthe international community’s goal of ending impunity \r\nfor serious crimes. Their jurisprudence has enriched \r\nour understanding of genocide, crimes against \r\nhumanity and war crimes, as well as the practice and \r\nprocedures of international criminal law. By fostering \r\nthe development of national courts, the Tribunals have \r\nstrengthened the rule of law. Through their outreach \r\nand coordination activities, the Tribunals have fostered \r\nreconciliation and demonstrated that peace and justice \r\ncan be pursued in tandem. \r\n We welcome the efforts being made to utilize the \r\nlegal and institutional legacies of the Tribunals to \r\ninform the work of other international criminal \r\ntribunals and to promote the advancement of \r\ninternational criminal justice. \r\n CANZ appreciates the efforts being made by both \r\nthe ICTY and the ICTR to achieve the goals set out in \r\ntheir respective completion strategies. We welcome in \r\nparticular the ICTY’s implementation of the \r\nrecommendations of its Working Group on Speeding \r\nup Trials and the ICTR’s issuing of practice directions \r\naimed at improving the management of trials. \r\n CANZ recognizes that, in moving into the \r\ncompletion phase of their work, both Tribunals are \r\nfacing significant challenges. It is evident from the \r\nreports of the Tribunals that a key issue of concern is \r\nthe fugitive status of 12 indictees. It is imperative that \r\nall remaining indictees be surrendered and that States \r\nmake special efforts to ensure that high-level indictees \r\nRatko Mladić, Goran Hadžić, Félicien Kabuga, Protais \r\nMpiranya and Augustin Bizimana face trial. As noted \r\nby the Tribunals themselves, decisive and intensified \r\naction by the relevant authorities is critical in this \r\nregard. \r\n It is equally important that the international \r\ncommunity respond to the calls of the Tribunals for \r\nassistance in developing creative approaches to assist \r\nwith the retention of essential staff. We accept that the \r\nTribunals are being asked to undertake an ever-more \r\nonerous workload at a time when they are losing \r\nexperienced personnel at an alarming rate as staff \r\nmembers seek out positions with greater job security. \r\nWe hope that the Secretariat and other relevant bodies \r\nwill continue to work with the Registrars of the \r\nA/65/PV.27  \r\n \r\n10-57241 10 \r\n \r\nTribunals to find practicable solutions to these very \r\npressing problems. \r\n CANZ recognizes that the completion of the \r\nTribunals’ mandates will not mean an end to all of the \r\nTribunals’ functions. It has long been understood that \r\nthere will be activities — such as the trial of \r\nsubsequently captured fugitives, the enforcement of \r\nsentences, the protection of witnesses, the provision of \r\nassistance to national authorities and the management \r\nof archives — that must be continued. We welcome the \r\nefforts being made by the Tribunals in that regard, as \r\nwell as those being undertaken by the Government of \r\nRwanda to address the impediments to the referral of \r\ncases to Rwanda by the ICTR.  \r\n We also note the reports and recommendations \r\nmade by the Security Council’s Informal Working \r\nGroup on International Tribunals in relation to the \r\nestablishment of a mechanism to carry out the residual \r\nfunctions of the ICTY and the ICTR. We encourage the \r\nongoing discussion of those issues. While the situation \r\nfaced by every criminal tribunal is unique, those \r\ndiscussions and their eventual outcomes will no doubt \r\nbe of great assistance to future planning undertaken in \r\nrelation to the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of \r\nCambodia, the Special Court for Sierra Leone and the \r\nSpecial Tribunal for Lebanon. \r\n The successful completion of the work of the \r\nICTY and the ICTR will require the cooperation and \r\nsupport of all States. We call upon States to give \r\npractical effect to their commitment to an effective \r\nsystem of international criminal justice. For our part, \r\nCanada, Australia and New Zealand will continue to \r\noffer the Tribunals our full support and cooperation in \r\nthis vital and challenging stage of their existence. \r\n Mr. Shin Boonam (Republic of Korea): As the \r\nPresidents of the two Tribunals have outlined in their \r\nrespective annual reports (A/65/205 and A/65/188), the \r\nachievements of the International Criminal Tribunal for \r\nthe Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) are so many as \r\nto render it impossible to give appropriate credit to \r\nthem all. The staff members of the Tribunal and \r\nanonymous individuals working behind the scenes to \r\nsupport the Tribunals’ work deserve our tribute of great \r\ngratitude and respect for that. The time is quickly \r\napproaching for the closure of both the ICTY and the \r\nICTR. Now more than ever, we must remain humbled \r\nby the task ahead of us — to create a living legacy out \r\nof that momentous effort. \r\n The Tribunals represent our effort to apply the \r\nrule of law to those who have used their powers to \r\ndestroy the fabric of peace and committed \r\nunimaginable atrocities. The significance of that effort \r\nto ensure justice is not to be measured in isolation. It is \r\npart of a larger ongoing movement to align \r\ninternational law with the moral sense of humankind so \r\nas to ensure that the reach of justice extends to every \r\ncorner of the world. It is our responsibility to ensure \r\nthat, years after the last office in the ICTY and the \r\nICTR headquarters has been vacated, the legacy of the \r\ntwo Tribunals continues to ring. But how can that be \r\ndone? What exactly is or will be the legacy of the two \r\nTribunals? \r\n In my mind, the legacy of the Tribunals is \r\nthreefold. First, on a technical level, the ICTY and the \r\nICTR have built a foundation for the development of \r\ninternational criminal law. The Tribunals will leave \r\nbehind a valuable legal asset that includes the rules of \r\nprocedure, practices and judgements of the Tribunals. \r\n Secondly, the institutional legacy of the two \r\nTribunals has sown the seeds for the creation of other \r\ninternational and hybrid criminal courts around the \r\nworld. Having simultaneously contributed to the \r\ndevelopment of national judiciaries to hold fair and \r\neffective war crimes proceedings, the ICTY and the \r\nICTR set the standard for the principle of \r\ncomplementarity to gain ground in the paradigm of \r\ninternational justice. \r\n Thirdly, the legacy of creating regional peace and \r\nstability reminds us that only when we make all people \r\nanswerable to the law can we cast away tyranny and \r\nviolence. Today, the Tribunals have done much to \r\nprovide a sense of justice and reconciliation to the \r\nvictims and to society at large. \r\n The next question is: What can we do to ensure \r\nthe utilization of the legal and institutional advances \r\nthat have resulted from the Tribunals? In short, how \r\ncan we secure the legacy? \r\n The mortar for that effort will be the completion \r\nstrategy of the two Tribunals and, subsequently, the \r\nresidual mechanisms. While the Security Council’s \r\nInformal Working Group on International Tribunals \r\ncontinues to determine the residual functions and what \r\nform and structure they should take, it is equally \r\n A/65/PV.27\r\n \r\n11 10-57241 \r\n \r\nimperative for us to continuously relate that initiative \r\nto a broader context. \r\n Let us continue to take into account the rights of \r\nall individuals concerned and offer our cooperation and \r\nsupport to national authorities. As part of their \r\ncompletion strategies, the Tribunals should intensify \r\ntheir efforts to refer further cases to national \r\njurisdictions, which would strengthen domestic \r\njudiciaries and act as a catalyst for legal reform. On \r\nthat note, we must express clearly the jurisdictional \r\ncontinuity between the Tribunals and the mechanisms. \r\n We must also call upon the experienced staff of \r\nthe Tribunals to provide institutional knowledge and \r\nexperience to the residual mechanisms, especially \r\nthrough the prudent management of the Tribunals’ \r\narchives. Creating a separate regime to govern the \r\nmanagement of and access to the archives, including \r\nconfidential information, would be a good place to start. \r\nWe must also ensure that national judges, prosecutors \r\nand lawyers have easy access to them, as well as to the \r\ntools to understand them. \r\n One of the most difficult issues facing us today is \r\nthe fact that several high-level fugitives remain at large. \r\nAs individuals, their fates may be of little consequence \r\nto the world; what makes them significant to us and to \r\nthe communities affected is that they are living \r\nsymbols of atrocity, oppression and cruelty — the \r\ndarkest forces that demoralize a society. \r\n Today, let us call upon all States to intensify \r\ncooperation with the Tribunals to achieve the arrest and \r\nsurrender of those fugitives. We cannot allow a culture \r\nof impunity to gain ground and give strength to such \r\nsinister forces. Those individuals will be brought to \r\njustice and the mandate of the Tribunals fulfilled. \r\n The Republic of Korea will always be one of the \r\nmost vocal supporters of the movement for \r\ninternational justice. The work of the ICTY and the \r\nICTR has proven to be pivotal to that movement. We \r\nlook forward to the drawdown of the Tribunals in a \r\nsmooth and efficient manner. That is what we have \r\nachieved, but it is just the beginning. Now that task \r\nfalls to us, for those institutions will become what we \r\nmake of their legacies. I wish for the future of \r\ninternational justice to stand high on the shoulders of \r\nthe ICTY and the ICTR. \r\n Mr. Appreku (Ghana): This being the first time I \r\nhave taken the floor since his assumption of the \r\npresidency, let me add my voice to the warm words of \r\ncongratulations extended to the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly by the head of Ghana’s delegation \r\nduring the high-level segment of the general debate \r\nand reiterate my delegation’s best wishes for his \r\nsuccess as he presides over the affairs of this Assembly \r\nduring its sixty-fifth session. \r\n My delegation thanks the Secretary-General for \r\nhis two notes (A/65/188 and A/65/205), respectively \r\nforwarding the comprehensive reports of the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) \r\nand the International Tribunal for the Former \r\nYugoslavia (ICTY). \r\n My delegation also expresses deep gratitude to \r\nthe President of the ICTR, Judge Charles Michael \r\nDennis Byron, and the President of the ICTY, Judge \r\nPatrick Robinson, for their thorough presentations of \r\ntheir respective annual reports. We are pleased to learn \r\nof the progress being made concerning the respective \r\ncompletion strategies of the two Tribunals. We \r\ncomment on these two reports mindful that an accused \r\nperson is presumed innocent until proven guilty and \r\nbearing in mind the commitment made by the \r\ninternational community to preventing and deterring \r\nmass atrocities and to bringing to justice the \r\nperpetrators of such heinous crimes. \r\n The jurisprudence of the ICTR and the ICTY, like \r\nthat of the Special Court for Sierra Leone and other ad \r\nhoc or hybrid tribunals, has contributed significantly to \r\nthe strengthening of the legal regime of international \r\ncriminal justice. The practice of engaging in a process \r\nof dialogue among judges of the International Court of \r\nJustice, the International Criminal Court and other ad \r\nhoc or hybrid tribunals will help to minimize or \r\naddress concerns about the fragmentation of \r\ninternational law and promote the rule of law and \r\nrespect for human rights. \r\n Ghana welcomes initiatives reflected in the \r\nreports of the ICTR and ICTY to build archival records \r\nas part of their legacy to guide the future behaviour of \r\nindividuals and States. Perhaps a more durable legacy \r\nwill be for the international community to draw \r\nappropriate lessons from the legacy of cases or \r\njurisprudence of the Tribunals in order to enhance the \r\ncapacity of States Members of this Organization to \r\nundertake preventative action. The victims must also \r\ncontinue to receive attention even after the work of the \r\nTribunals is wound up. With a view to facilitating the \r\nA/65/PV.27  \r\n \r\n10-57241 12 \r\n \r\nattainment of their completion targets, the requests of \r\nthe Tribunals for the various resource challenges \r\noutlined in the reports before this Assembly to be \r\naddressed deserve careful consideration. \r\n The need for prevention cannot be \r\noveremphasized. Indeed, as a result of the experience \r\nof violent civil wars and other violent conflicts that \r\nhave occurred on the continent of Africa, including \r\nwithin our own subregion of West Africa, particularly \r\nin the 1980s and 1990s, the African Union (AU) and \r\nregional organizations on the continent have resolved \r\nto take a more proactive active stance to prevent \r\nconflicts or to take timely and decisive action when \r\nprevention fails. Thus, for example, under the \r\nConstitutive Act of the African Union, AU member \r\nStates have conferred a treaty right on the Union to \r\nintervene at the request of any member State in \r\nsituations of genocide, war crimes or crimes against \r\nhumanity upon the recommendation of the AU Peace \r\nand Security Council.  \r\n Pursuant to these provisions, the African Union \r\nhas developed the African Standby Force arrangement \r\nand requested logistical and financial support from the \r\ninternational community to ensure that the force can be \r\nrapidly deployed for prevention or decisive action on \r\nthe continent of Africa, in accordance with the United \r\nNations Charter. African countries also joined the \r\nconsensus in this Assembly when it adopted the 2005 \r\nWorld Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1), in particular \r\nparagraphs 138, 139 and 140, in which world leaders \r\naccepted their responsibility to protect their \r\npopulations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic \r\ncleansing and crimes against humanity. \r\n As we consider the reports of the ICTY and ICTR \r\ntoday, we should recall that which led to the \r\nestablishment of the Tribunals in the first place and \r\nwork at managing our ethnic or racial diversities in a \r\nmanner that will promote national integration and unity, \r\nfoster inter-ethnic harmony and prevent mass atrocities. \r\nTo this end, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Ghana \r\nand Denmark co-hosted in New York a side event on \r\n24 September 2010, attended by ministers for foreign \r\naffairs and other ministers from some 25 countries in a \r\ncross-regional endeavour to explore ways of moving \r\nbeyond the concept to the effective operationalization \r\nof the responsibility to protect populations from \r\ngenocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes \r\nagainst humanity. This will no doubt complement the \r\ninitiatives of the Secretary-General and his Special \r\nAdviser for the Responsibility to Protect and his \r\nSpecial Representative for the Prevention of Genocide \r\nand Mass Atrocities. Furthermore, early this year, the \r\nGovernment of Ghana invited to Accra the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s Special Representative for the Prevention of \r\nGenocide and Mass Atrocities to exchange views on \r\nmeasures to address the root causes of conflict, thereby \r\npreventing genocide and other serious crimes within \r\nthe region of the Economic Community of West \r\nAfrican States. \r\n I wish to conclude by commending the outreach \r\nprogrammes undertaken by the ICTR and other \r\ntribunals aimed at educating young people and other \r\nsegments of the population, for it is a truth that bears \r\nrepeating that, since war begins in the thoughts of men \r\nand women, it is in the minds of men and women that \r\nthe defences of peace must be built. We must diligently \r\nand passionately inculcate the culture of peace and \r\ntolerance among all nations and civilizations. \r\n The United Nations has answered the call made \r\nin the African Union’s Kigali Declaration to \r\ncommemorate 7 April as a day of remembrance of the \r\nvictims of genocide in Rwanda and to renew our \r\ncommitment to the prevention of genocide in the world. \r\nIf or when the next mass atrocities threaten or do occur, \r\nthe international community must be prepared and \r\nready to answer the call to prevent them or take \r\nappropriate action in a more timely and decisive \r\nmanner than it has done in the past. \r\n Ms. Čolaković (Bosnia and Herzegovina): Allow \r\nme at the outset to welcome Judge Patrick Robinson, \r\nPresident of the International Criminal Tribunal for the \r\nformer Yugoslavia (ICTY), and Judge Charles Michael \r\nDennis Byron, President of the International Criminal \r\nTribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), and to thank them for \r\ntheir comprehensive and detailed reports (A/65/205 \r\nand A/65/188) and briefings in today’s meeting. We \r\ncommend their hard work in fighting impunity and \r\ntheir dedication to the cause of justice, as their every \r\naction uncompromisingly states that war crimes, \r\ngenocide and crimes against humanity will not go \r\nunpunished. In addition, we find it necessary to \r\nmention the tireless work of all the staff of the \r\nTribunals. \r\n We are also obliged to take note of all the efforts \r\nthe Tribunals make to successfully complete their work, \r\nand to provide them with all the necessary support. \r\nMore than ever, we are convinced that a hasty closure \r\n A/65/PV.27\r\n \r\n13 10-57241 \r\n \r\nwould irrevocably undermine and tarnish their legacy, \r\na legacy that without a doubt represents one of the \r\ncornerstones on which the international criminal justice \r\nsystem as we know it today is built. We strongly agree \r\nwith the remarks made by Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon on 17 July 2008 at the commemoration of the \r\ntenth anniversary of the adoption of the Rome Statute \r\nof the International Criminal Court, when he stated that \r\nthe fight against impunity started in earnest with the \r\nestablishment of the International Criminal Tribunals \r\nfor the Former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda. Those \r\ncourts pioneered the emergence of international \r\ncriminal justice and the enforcement of international \r\nhumanitarian law. We must therefore not allow the \r\ngroundbreaking contributions of the Tribunals to \r\ninternational jurisprudence to fall victim to pressure to \r\nconclude their mandate, ending with partial results and \r\nwithout adequate resolution. \r\n I would also like to extend our appreciation to \r\nAmbassador Mayr-Harting for his firm leadership in \r\nchairing the Informal Working Group on the Tribunals. \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina attaches great importance to \r\nwork of the Group, and further commends the Austrian \r\ndelegation for efficiently steering its deliberations, \r\nwith the valuable assistance of the Office of Legal \r\nAffairs, to an adequate and credible residual \r\nmechanism that will be the Tribunals’ legacy. \r\n It is encouraging indeed that during the reporting \r\nperiod of the ICTR three more fugitives were arrested, \r\nbringing the total number of fugitives down to 10. On \r\nthe other hand, it is disappointing and frustrating that \r\nFélicien Kabuga, Ratko Mladić and Goran Hadžić still \r\nmanage to evade justice and mock the entire \r\ninternational community. We can appeal to the \r\nTribunals to comply with the completion strategy and \r\ntirelessly work on the residual mechanism, but all of \r\nthat is useless unless we take some firm steps and \r\nserious measures to bring those criminals to justice. \r\nOnly then — I repeat, only then — will we be able to \r\nsay that every condition of the founding resolutions of \r\nthe Tribunals has been met and their assigned mandates \r\nfulfilled. For that matter, it is beyond doubt that the \r\nunconditional cooperation of the relevant international \r\nand regional organizations and States is essential and \r\nnecessary for the complete fulfilment of the Tribunals’ \r\nmandates. \r\n I therefore underline the strong commitment of \r\nmy country to its obligations, and our undeniable \r\nsupport and dedication to strengthening international \r\ncriminal justice. The ICTY report before us (A/65/205), \r\nas well as the previous ones, reflects that commitment \r\nthrough the record of a steady and positive cooperation \r\nbetween Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Tribunal. As \r\nstated, the authorities of my country have effectively \r\nresponded to all requests of the Prosecutor’s Office, \r\nproviding documents, enabling unobstructed access to \r\nGovernment archives and facilitating the appearance of \r\nwitnesses before the Tribunal. The cooperation has \r\nbeen particularly constructive with regard to the \r\nrule 11 bis cases transferred by the Office of the \r\nProsecutor to the War Crimes Chamber of the State \r\nCourt of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Five of the six cases \r\ntransferred to Bosnia and Herzegovina have been \r\ncompleted with final decisions. \r\n Allow me to conclude by underlining that \r\nthroughout the years Bosnia and Herzegovina’s support \r\nfor the Tribunals, especially the ICTY, has been \r\nunwavering, and today we reaffirm that support once \r\nagain. As the country most affected by the crimes \r\nunder the jurisdiction of one of the Tribunals, we \r\ncannot emphasize enough how important it is to bring \r\njustice to the victims and their families and to hold \r\naccountable those who committed those heinous crimes. \r\nThus, we regard the work of the Tribunals in fighting \r\nimpunity as of the highest importance, as they have \r\nadvanced the rule of law in affected regions, brought \r\njustice to those who suffered the most and eventually \r\npaved the path towards reconciliation. \r\n Mr. Panin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): First of all, let me express our appreciation \r\nto the Presidents of both the International Criminal \r\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) for \r\ntheir reports (A/65/205 and A/65/188). The Russian \r\nFederation is inalterably committed to the idea of the \r\ndispensation of international criminal justice for the \r\nperpetrators of the most severe crimes under \r\ninternational law, and recognizes the significant \r\ncontribution of the Tribunals to establishing a system \r\nof international criminal justice and to the cause of \r\nrestoring peace and justice in States established in the \r\nterritory of the former Yugoslavia and in Rwanda. \r\n The contribution of the Tribunals to developing \r\nthe practice of international criminal justice is of an \r\nenduring significance that will most likely only be \r\ntruly assessed by future generations. We have no \r\nreservations that those indicted by the Tribunals who \r\nhave committed the crimes mentioned but who for \r\nA/65/PV.27  \r\n \r\n10-57241 14 \r\n \r\nvarious reasons are still at large must be brought to \r\nstand before the law. We have consistently supported \r\nand we now support the efforts of the two Tribunals to \r\ndeal with those fugitives. Both here in the Assembly \r\nand in the Security Council, we have repeated our \r\nassessment of the work of the Tribunals every year in \r\nresponse to the Tribunal reports, and we are willing to \r\nreaffirm now every word we have previously said.  \r\n Still, there is, unfortunately, a negative side to the \r\nwork of the Tribunals that diminishes its positive \r\naspect. The Tribunals have long since exceeded the \r\ndeadlines for their existence, thereby conflicting with \r\nSecurity Council resolutions on a completion strategy \r\nfor their work. We are convinced that such a situation \r\ndoes a disservice, both to the international community \r\nand to the Tribunals themselves, and we intend to \r\ncontinue to press to resolve this matter.  \r\n Moreover, an examination of the prospects for \r\nmoving the Tribunals’ work to completion leaves little \r\nroom for optimism. According to recent information \r\nprovided by the Tribunals this year, the Rwandan \r\nTribunal planned to close cases in the trial phase in \r\n2011 and the recent appeals at the end of 2013. The \r\nTribunal for the former Yugoslavia was looking to \r\nclose cases in the trial phase in 2012 and the recent \r\nappeal litigation in the Karadžić case in 2014. Those \r\ndeadlines are very noticeably later than the dates \r\nprovided in 2009 — and have since been extended — \r\nso we cannot escape the feeling that even these \r\nextended deadlines are not final. One cannot help being \r\nalarmed by the continuously significant extensions of \r\nthe trials, especially in the ICTY. The Rwandan \r\nTribunal has done better by comparison, having \r\nprovided more accurate forecasts and seeming closer to \r\nconcluding their cases. \r\n Our position on this matter of principle remains \r\nunchanged. \r\n The extension of all proceedings beyond 2010 is \r\nan exceptional measure. When one of the Presidents \r\nspoke here, he talked about the future. We would like \r\nto emphasize that we understand the difference \r\nbetween an ad hoc court and a full court, and we agree \r\nthat the Tribunals cannot close their business quickly. \r\nWe understand that, when the completion strategy set \r\nthe finishing year at 2010, which was supposed to be \r\nthe final deadline, and the courts saw that they could \r\nnot manage to finish, the courts corrected that.  \r\n We understand the objective reasons why some \r\ntrials have dragged on. For instance, it is completely \r\nunderstandable why there would be a deadline later \r\nthan the one originally planned for the ICTY to \r\ncomplete the Šešelj case, or a possible extension of the \r\nTribunal’s operations owing to the decision to start a \r\npartial retrial of the Haradinaj case.  \r\n However, we see a number of other significant \r\ndifferences between the ad hoc and full courts. We will \r\ntalk about them later, in a less formal setting.  \r\n We are absolutely convinced that the particulars \r\nof those cases, if the work were properly organized, \r\ncould not serve as grounds for significantly extending \r\nthe Tribunals’ deadline and are truly of no impact \r\nwhatsoever on the delays already registered, and that \r\nwe are in this situation through the fault of both the \r\nTribunals and States. \r\n The problems of the extension of deadlines for \r\nthe ICTY and ICTR would be fully manageable, if the \r\nefforts of the Tribunals themselves, the General \r\nAssembly, the Security Council and the countries of \r\nthe two regions were coordinated and combined. \r\n With respect to the work of the Tribunals, they \r\nhave already done much themselves to speed up their \r\ntrials. We welcome the efforts to speed up litigation \r\nand to make rational use of court space and staff for \r\nsimultaneous hearings on a number of cases. However, \r\nmore can be done to optimize the work in this respect.  \r\n It is unacceptable that the defendant in the Šešelj \r\ncase, which we have already mentioned, had to await \r\nthe start of proceedings for over six years, in violation \r\nof all reasonable procedural timelines and his right to a \r\nspeedy trial. Such a situation violates even elementary \r\nhuman concepts of justice. Looking for support to \r\nspeed up the trials is, we think, possible and a way to \r\nensure maximal use of the judges’ work and time.  \r\n There have been examples of obvious success in \r\nmeeting that challenge. In particular, we are impressed \r\nthat the ICTY, in the Popović case, was able to support \r\nthe peak workloads of the judges, prosecution and \r\ndefence, and we are persuaded that such an intense \r\npace can be also supported in other cases.  \r\n The successful completion of the mandates of the \r\nTribunals would be helped if States in the region \r\nextended further conscientious cooperation to them. \r\nWe call on those States to continue to actively facilitate \r\nthe work of the Tribunals through the timely provision \r\n A/65/PV.27\r\n \r\n15 10-57241 \r\n \r\nof the necessary information and to help in the search \r\nfor individuals still at large. We should especially \r\nsupport the willingness of a number of States to \r\nprovide the Tribunal with the opportunity for those \r\nconvicted to serve their sentences in that country and, \r\nin the case of Rwanda, even to take on a number of \r\ncases under their national jurisdiction. That would \r\nattest to the progressive development of legal \r\ninstitutions in post-conflict areas and to the \r\nestablishment of the rule of law nationally, which was \r\none of the major challenges when the Tribunals were \r\nestablished. \r\n Mr. Starčević (Serbia): Let me begin by \r\nwelcoming the President of the International Criminal \r\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), Judge \r\nPatrick Robinson, and the President of the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), Mr. Dennis \r\nByron, and thanking them for their presentation of the \r\nannual reports of the two Tribunals (A/65/205 and \r\nA/65/188). \r\n In this connection, I would like to reiterate \r\nSerbia’s full commitment to cooperate with the ICTY \r\nand to assist in the successful completion of its \r\nmandate. My country has clearly expressed its political \r\nwill in that respect and has implemented it through its \r\nefforts towards strong and continuous cooperation with \r\nthe Tribunal. \r\n That political will was demonstrated also by the \r\nfact that, on 31 March 2010, the National Assembly of \r\nthe Republic of Serbia adopted a declaration \r\ncondemning the crime at Srebrenica, an act of \r\nexceptional importance for both Serbia and the entire \r\nregion. By that declaration, the National Assembly \r\ngave full support to the work of Government agencies \r\nin charge of processing war crimes and successfully \r\ncompleting cooperation with ICTY, in which the \r\nlocating and arrest of Ratko Mladić and his transfer to \r\nthe Tribunal for trial is of particular importance.  \r\n Also, the President of Serbia was present at the \r\nPotočari Memorial Centre on 11 July 2010 for the \r\ncommemoration of the 15 years since the crime at \r\nSrebrenica. He said on that occasion that Serbia would \r\nnot desist from its efforts to track down the \r\nperpetrators of war crimes, and Ratko Mladić in \r\nparticular, in order to make it possible for people to \r\ncontinue to live together. \r\n Regarding the technical aspects of cooperation \r\nwith the Tribunal, we consider that a very high level of \r\ncooperation has been reached and maintained over the \r\npast several years, which is amply evidenced by the \r\nreports of the ICTY Prosecutor to the Security Council. \r\nThat has been made possible by the dedicated work of \r\nboth the competent Government agencies of the \r\nRepublic of Serbia and the Tribunal, as well as by the \r\nrelations of trust and confidence established between \r\nthem. Today, excellent professional relations exist \r\nbetween the representatives of Serbian institutions and \r\nthe representatives of the Tribunal, and this is evident. \r\n To illustrate the existing level of cooperation, let \r\nme point out the following. Serbia has thus far \r\nresponded in full to almost all the requests received \r\nfrom the Tribunal related to the provision of \r\ndocumentation, access to the archives of Serbian \r\nGovernment agencies, the provision of waivers for \r\ntestifying in the proceedings before the Tribunal and all \r\nother technical aspects of cooperation. As stated in the \r\nreport of the President of the Tribunal, the cooperation \r\nof Serbia on those issues has been timely and adequate. \r\n We consider it exceptionally important that the \r\nreport points out that Serbia has delivered to the \r\nTribunal the items seized during the search of the \r\napartment of Ratko Mladić’s family conducted by the \r\nMinistry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Serbia in \r\nFebruary 2010. Items seized include Mladić’s \r\nnotebooks, that is, handwritten wartime notes from the \r\nperiod from 1991 to 1996. As stated in the report, they \r\nalso contain highly valuable evidence in certain other \r\ncases before the Tribunal. \r\n Serbia transferred to the Tribunal 43 persons \r\nindicted for war crimes, while one person committed \r\nsuicide prior to being transferred. In addition to the \r\npersons charged with the most serious crimes, Serbia \r\ndelivered to the Tribunal all persons found in contempt \r\nof court. Mladić and Hadžić are the only remaining \r\nfugitives. There should be no doubt about the resolve \r\nof the authorities of the Republic of Serbia to arrest \r\nMladić and Hadžić and transfer them to the Tribunal. \r\nSerbia considers that bringing these two fugitives to \r\njustice, like the 43 before them, is in its best interest. \r\n Serbia is well aware of the suggestions and \r\nconcerns regarding the fugitives expressed by the \r\nPresident of the Tribunal in his report and by the ICTY \r\nProsecutor in his briefing to the Security Council in \r\nJune 2010 (see S/PV.6342). Serbia’s security services, \r\nwhich are investing enormous efforts in bringing \r\nMladić and Hadžić to justice, are open to all \r\nA/65/PV.27  \r\n \r\n10-57241 16 \r\n \r\nrecommendations and suggestions by the officials of \r\nthe Tribunal. We consider it very important that the \r\nOffice of the Prosecutor be provided with detailed \r\ninformation about all the measures that are being taken \r\nin that respect. \r\n During the recent visit of the President of the \r\nICTY to Belgrade, a regional project aimed at training \r\ncourts in the countries of the former Yugoslavia to \r\nprosecute those accused of war crimes was launched. \r\nSerbia considers that cooperation with the Tribunal and \r\nthe prosecution of war crimes in national courts are \r\nbasic preconditions for the establishment of the whole \r\ntruth about the war crimes committed during the armed \r\nconflicts in the territory of the former Socialist Federal \r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia. That also represents an \r\nimportant contribution towards the normalization of \r\nthe societies of the region.  \r\n We are therefore firmly committed to continuing \r\nthe high level of cooperation with the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. \r\n Mr. Wetland (Norway): Norway is a staunch \r\nsupporter of the International Criminal Tribunals for \r\nRwanda (ICTR) and the International Criminal \r\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). The high \r\nstandards and achievements of the Tribunals are \r\nreflected in their well-reasoned judgements and the \r\nannual reports before us (A/65/188 and A/65/205). I \r\nwould like to thank the Presidents of the Tribunals, \r\nJudges Byron and Robinson, for their informative \r\nreports. They provide a detailed account of the \r\nprogress made during the past year. \r\n The Tribunals have made important contributions \r\nto international criminal law. They have developed a \r\njurisprudence that has set standards for national \r\ntribunals, as well as for other international tribunals. \r\nBy effectively prosecuting the perpetrators of the most \r\nserious international crimes, the Tribunals have not \r\nonly helped to bring justice to the victims in Rwanda \r\nand the former Yugoslavia. They have also made \r\nsignificant achievements in the fight against impunity \r\nfor mass atrocities in general. \r\n I would like to focus on three specific issues that \r\nare essential for the success of the Tribunals’ work. \r\nThose are: first, the Tribunals’ continued efforts to \r\nimplement their completion strategies; secondly, the \r\ncooperation of Member States; and thirdly, the work on \r\nresidual issues. \r\n Both Tribunals are working hard to fulfil their \r\nmandates. We commend them for their commitment to \r\nimplementing their completion strategies, while \r\nensuring that the standards of due process and \r\nfundamental legal principles are fully respected. \r\n The Tribunals must continue to carry out their \r\nwork expeditiously, but that endeavour is not without \r\nobstacles. During the reporting period, the Tribunals \r\nfaced difficulties in meeting the objectives set out in \r\ntheir completion strategies owing to the disquieting \r\nimpact of staff attrition. \r\n In that regard, we welcome Security Council \r\nresolutions 1931 (2010) and 1932 (2010), which \r\nextended the terms of 39 judges in total. Furthermore, \r\nthe resolutions called on relevant United Nations \r\nbodies to explore ways to address the staffing issue as \r\nthe Tribunals approach completion of their work. \r\n The Tribunals cannot successfully fulfil their \r\nmandates without the full cooperation of States. It is \r\ncrucial that States give both Tribunals their unreserved \r\nsupport. All States must honour their obligations to \r\nprovide full and effective assistance to the Tribunals.  \r\n Here, we would like to highlight two challenges, \r\nnamely, the enforcement of sentences and the \r\nremaining fugitives. The responsibility to enforce \r\nsentences must be shared by more States. We \r\nencourage States to enter into agreements on the \r\nenforcement of sentences, and we look forward to more \r\nsuch agreements being concluded. \r\n The failure to arrest the remaining fugitives \r\ncontinues to be of grave concern to us. It is not \r\nacceptable that perpetrators of serious international \r\ncrimes evade legal proceedings. Member States must \r\nfulfil their obligation to arrest them and transfer them \r\nto the Tribunals without delay. I am pleased to note the \r\ndetermination just expressed from this rostrum by my \r\ncolleague from Serbia. \r\n We are pleased to note that three fugitives have \r\nbeen arrested since the last report (A/64/205). However, \r\n12 fugitives are still at large. We cannot rest until the \r\nremaining fugitives are apprehended and brought \r\nbefore the court. Impunity is not an option. \r\n How the residual issues of the Tribunals should \r\nbe dealt with is a pending issue for the Security \r\nCouncil. While we commend the Tribunals for their \r\nefforts, we would also urge them to ensure that as \r\n A/65/PV.27\r\n \r\n17 10-57241 \r\n \r\nmuch work on residual issues as possible is carried out \r\nbefore the completion dates. \r\n We welcome the ongoing work in the Informal \r\nWorking Group on International Tribunals and the \r\nsupport provided by the Secretariat. With regard to the \r\nlocation of the residual mechanisms, Norway supports \r\nan approach that also fully incorporates the needs of \r\nother United Nations-assisted courts, and full \r\nadvantage should be taken of possible synergies. \r\n The continuation of the residual activities of the \r\nTribunals is an important part of their long-term legacy \r\nand is important for their legitimacy and for \r\ninternational criminal law in general. Norway is a \r\nstrong supporter of the rule of law and criminal justice, \r\nand will continue to work actively to assist the \r\nTribunals in achieving their completion dates. \r\n Mr. Nduhungirehe (Rwanda) (spoke in French): \r\nI thank you, Sir, for the opportunity that you have \r\ngiven my delegation to speak in this debate. The \r\nRwandan delegation thanks the President of the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) \r\nand the President of the International Criminal Tribunal \r\nfor the Former Yugoslavia for the presentation of their \r\nreports (A/65/188 and A/65/205), and acknowledges \r\ntheir tireless efforts to successfully carry out their work \r\nand thus accomplish that noble task of doing justice to \r\nhumanity.  \r\n During the period under consideration, the \r\nGovernment of the Republic of Rwanda continued to \r\nprovide the cooperation needed to enable the ICTR to \r\nexecute the mandate conferred on it by the Security \r\nCouncil. Rwanda continued to facilitate access to \r\nwitnesses, whether for the defence or the prosecution, \r\nand to ensure their unimpeded travel to Arusha. In that \r\nregard, the Government continued to support the \r\nWitnesses and Victims Support Section, set up in the \r\nOffice of the Prosecutor in Kigali, in order to ensure \r\nfull and complete security for witnesses of genocide. \r\nFurthermore, as stated in the report, my Government \r\ncontinued to support investigations, both by the \r\nprosecution and by the defence, by providing the \r\ndocuments needed for the trials. \r\n The Government of Rwanda remains committed \r\nto continuing to provide its full support for the ICTR’s \r\ncompletion strategy, as set out in Security Council \r\nresolution 1503 (2003).  \r\n However, my delegation regrets the delay in \r\nmeeting the deadline for the completion of work and \r\nnotes the Tribunal’s commitment to conclude trials of \r\nfirst instance by 2011 and appeals by the end of 2013.  \r\n As the report indicates, Rwanda will continue to \r\ncooperate with the ICTR in order to remove any \r\nobstacle to the transfer of cases that are still pending at \r\nthe end of the ICTR mandate to Rwandan jurisdiction. \r\nMany legal reforms have been undertaken in that \r\nrespect and have been recognized by the ICTR.  \r\n In the meantime, my delegation thanks the \r\nTribunal for transferring to Rwanda the files on 25 \r\nsuspects. Inquiries have been opened on those suspects \r\nwithout proceeding to an indictment, in order to enable \r\nus to undertake the appropriate legal procedures. In \r\nthat regard, we reiterate the fact that our request to \r\nhave the files of cases that have not yet been tried by \r\nthe ICTR transferred is based mainly on the fact that \r\nthe crimes tried by the ICTR were committed in \r\nRwanda, by Rwandans against their Rwanda \r\ncompatriots. Furthermore, it is appropriate to note that \r\nthe evidence and the witnesses come from Rwanda, \r\nand that the justice carried out by the Tribunal will \r\nhave a greater impact on Rwanda than on the rest of \r\nthe world. \r\n My Government welcomes the arrest of the three \r\nfugitives during the period under consideration: \r\nGrégoire Ndahimana, Idelphonse Nizeyimana and \r\nJean-Bosco Uwinkindi, and we once again thank the \r\nGovernments of the Democratic Republic of the Congo \r\nand Uganda for their cooperation in that respect. We \r\nalso thank the ICTR for their continuing efforts to \r\nsearch for and arrest the remaining 10 fugitives. The \r\nGovernment also expresses its gratitude to the \r\nGovernments of Canada, Belgium, Finland, Sweden \r\nand France for their efforts to find and bring to trial \r\ngenocide suspects who are in those countries. However, \r\nwe regret that some countries have not yet extended the \r\nnecessary cooperation to the ICTR or the Rwandan \r\nGovernment, and we therefore support the appeal of \r\nthe President of the ICTR in that regard. \r\n My Government has often reiterated its views on \r\nthe transfer to Rwanda of the records of the ICTR at \r\nthe end of its mandate. Our request is based on the fact \r\nthat those documents are an integral part of our history. \r\nThey are essential to preserving the memory of the \r\ngenocide, as they will play an essential role in the \r\neducation of future generations and in preventing \r\nA/65/PV.27  \r\n \r\n10-57241 18 \r\n \r\nfuture genocides. We note the ongoing process to \r\ndetermine the final destination of those records, and we \r\nexpress once again our availability to join the United \r\nNations discussions on the subject.  \r\n Allow me once again to express the concern of \r\nmy Government on an issue of great importance, \r\nnamely, the increasing trend of defence lawyers in \r\nArusha and some members of the academic world to \r\ntrivialize and openly deny the fact of the genocide, \r\nwhich nevertheless was recognized by the Security \r\nCouncil through the very establishment of the ICTR. \r\nThose jurists, who have spoken freely in the \r\ninternational media, base their remarks on a mistaken \r\ninterpretation of the findings of the Tribunal, which is \r\nsupported by the recent report of the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights.  \r\n That worrisome trend is not going to promote the \r\npeace and reconciliation that Rwandans have fought so \r\nhard to achieve. The Government therefore again calls \r\nfor those who deny the genocide of Tutsis to be \r\nbrought before justice in accordance with Rwandan law, \r\na law that many other countries also have applied in \r\nother instances of genocide. \r\n To conclude, we reiterate our call for the ICTR to \r\ncontinue its efforts aimed at respecting its completion \r\nstrategy as far as possible, while ensuring that justice is \r\ndone by transferring the remaining cases to Rwandan \r\njurisdiction. Once again, we reiterate our full support \r\nfor the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda \r\nduring this critical period of the conclusion of its work. \r\n Mr. Maina (Kenya): My delegation congratulates \r\nthe President of the Assembly on his election to preside \r\nover the deliberations of the Assembly at the current \r\nsession. We also congratulate the other members of the \r\nBureau and wish to assure the President of Kenya’s full \r\nsupport as he discharges his task before the Assembly. I \r\nthank the President of the International Criminal \r\nTribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) for a comprehensive \r\nannual report submitted to the Assembly (A/65/188) in \r\nconformity with the respective statute establishing the \r\nTribunal. \r\n Kenya, however, notes with concern the \r\npersistent allegations by the Prosecutor of the Tribunal \r\nthat the fugitive Mr. Félicien Kabuga resides in Kenya. \r\nOn numerous occasions, Kenya has stated its position \r\non this matter before the Security Council and the \r\nGeneral Assembly. That position was once again \r\nreiterated in June 2010 before the Security Council \r\n(see S/PV.6342). \r\n I wish to state from the outset that Kenya has \r\nnothing to gain by harbouring Mr. Kabuga, especially \r\nwhen Kenya and Rwanda have always enjoyed \r\nexcellent and cordial relations. To the contrary, we \r\nhave always cooperated and worked closely with the \r\nICTR with a view to tracing, arresting and indeed \r\nsurrendering genocide suspects to the ICTR to face \r\njustice. It is important to mention that 14 suspects have \r\nbeen arrested and handed over to the ICTR for \r\nprosecution by the Government of Kenya. The \r\nAssembly may wish to note that this is the largest \r\nnumber of indictees to be apprehended and handed \r\nover to the ICTR by a single jurisdiction.  \r\n In September 2009, Kenya concluded an \r\nextradition treaty with the Republic of Rwanda, which \r\nprovides, inter alia, for the extradition of Rwandan \r\ngenocide suspects. The Government of Kenya has \r\nalways played a key role in the relocation, protection \r\nand facilitation of movement of witnesses to the \r\nTribunal in Arusha, to ensure that the cause of justice is \r\nserved expeditiously. To that end, we have expended \r\nconsiderable resources in the form of material, \r\nequipment and personnel as a contribution to the rule \r\nof law and justice. \r\n In 2007, the Government of Kenya formed a joint \r\ninvestigation team to search and apprehend \r\nMr. Félicien Kabuga and to freeze his assets and bank \r\naccounts, including those of his associates in Kenya. \r\nThat team discharged its mandate and submitted \r\nperiodic reports of its findings to both the Kenyan \r\nGovernment and the Tribunal. Part of the team’s \r\nfindings was that Mr. Kabuga’s wife had invested in \r\nreal estate and rents collected were being submitted to \r\na local financial institution. Further investigations \r\nrevealed that those funds had been transferred and \r\ncredited to the wife’s bank account in Belgium, where \r\nMr. Kabuga’s wife and children reside and hold \r\nBelgian passports. Our attorney general promptly \r\nobtained orders from the high court to freeze the bank \r\naccounts in Kenya. \r\n Joint investigations by Kenya and the ICTR into \r\nthe alleged sightings of the fugitive in Kenya have \r\nyielded no fruit thus far. The joint investigation team \r\ncontinues to carry out its mandate with the full support \r\nof the Kenyan Government. The particulars related to \r\nthe investigations and actions undertaken are known to \r\n A/65/PV.27\r\n \r\n19 10-57241 \r\n \r\nthe Tribunal. Kenya therefore finds the persistent \r\nallegations that it shows complacency with regard to \r\napprehending Mr. Kabuga misleading, malicious and \r\nlacking in merit. In this regard, we urge the ICTR and \r\ninternational agencies to broaden the search for \r\nMr. Kabuga to include other jurisdictions. \r\n In conclusion, my delegation reaffirms Kenya’s \r\ncommitment to upholding the rule of law. Kenya will \r\ncontinue to act closely with the ICTR in that regard. \r\n Mr. Vilović (Croatia): Let me start by expressing \r\nour appreciation to the Presidents of the two Tribunals, \r\nJudges Byron and Robinson, for their comprehensive \r\nand informative reports on the actions taken and \r\nprogress made during the period from 1 August 2009 to \r\n31 July 2010 (A/65/188 and A/65/205). My delegation \r\naligns itself with the statement delivered by the \r\nrepresentative of the European Union. However, I wish \r\nhere to stress a few more items. \r\n The Tribunals’ determined performance, aimed at \r\nthe unwavering prosecution of perpetrators of war \r\ncrimes, crimes against humanity or genocide, has \r\nserved as a basis for an emerging culture of \r\naccountability and a constant reminder that severe \r\ncrimes, regardless of who has committed them, will not \r\ngo unpunished. Croatia welcomes the continued \r\ncommitment of the International Tribunal for the \r\nProsecution of Persons Responsible for Serious \r\nViolations of International Humanitarian Law \r\nCommitted in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia \r\nsince 1991 (ICTY) to its completion strategy and the \r\nfinal conclusion of its work in accordance with its \r\nmandate and without sacrificing due process. In that \r\ncontext, Croatia supports endeavours by the President \r\nof the Court to further streamline and improve the \r\nCourt’s core functions in order to expedite its \r\nproceedings and make its work more efficient. \r\n International ad hoc tribunals were never meant \r\nto replace national courts, but rather to strengthen them \r\nand help them properly fulfil their allotted functions. In \r\nthat light and in accordance with relevant resolutions \r\nof the Security Council, Croatia supports calls on the \r\nICTY to transfer all appropriate cases to competent \r\nnational jurisdictions, thereby contributing to the \r\nsuccess of the Tribunal’s exit strategy. My country has \r\nclearly demonstrated its ability to conduct trials of \r\neven the most sensitive cases, including the one case \r\nthat was transferred to it by the ICTY. \r\n We are glad that the present report has confirmed \r\nCroatia’s general responsiveness to the needs of the \r\nOffice of the Prosecutor. Croatia is strongly committed \r\nto full and open cooperation with the Tribunal, as \r\ndemonstrated by the close and intense working \r\nrelationship established between the Office of the \r\nProsecutor and the Croatian Government at all levels. \r\nWe have taken concrete administrative, investigative \r\nand judicial measures in order to meet the requests of \r\nthe Office of the Prosecutor to the maximum extent \r\npossible. These efforts were further recognized by the \r\nrecent decision of Trial Chamber I in the Gotovina et al. \r\ncase. \r\n Let me express once again the deep concern of \r\nmy country with the fact that two accused, Ratko \r\nMladić and Goran Hadžić, have continued to evade \r\njustice for much too long — in the case of Mladić, for \r\nmore than 15 years. It must be made absolutely clear \r\nthat the trial of those fugitives does not hinge on the \r\nTribunal’s completion strategy dates, and we urge \r\nMember States to do all within their power to ensure, \r\nas a matter of urgency, the apprehension of those \r\nfugitives and their transfer to the Court’s custody. We \r\nfully share the President of the Court’s view that the \r\nfailure to bring those persons to justice will leave a \r\nstain on the contribution of the United Nations to \r\npeacebuilding in the former Yugoslavia and that it \r\nremains of grave concern to the proper administration \r\nof justice. \r\n Croatia welcomes further cooperation between \r\ncountries in the region in the processing of persons \r\nindicted for war crimes, as well as interaction between \r\nthe Tribunal and the Office of the Prosecutor and \r\ncompetent national authorities responsible for war \r\ncrimes prosecutions. In that context, we welcome the \r\nliaison prosecutors project funded by the European \r\nUnion, which is designed to bring prosecutors from the \r\nregion to work as liaison prosecutors within the Office \r\nof the Prosecutor. \r\n Let me also express here our satisfaction with \r\nPresident of the Court Judge Robinson’s visit to \r\nCroatia at the invitation of the President of the \r\nSupreme Court of Croatia. On that occasion Judge \r\nRobinson also met with the President of Croatia, the \r\nPrime Minister, the Minister of Justice and other key \r\nnational and international actors and discussed many \r\nimportant issues connected with Croatia’s processing \r\nof domestic war crimes cases, the launching of the \r\nLegacy Project, the announcement of plans for a new \r\nA/65/PV.27  \r\n \r\n10-57241 20 \r\n \r\nLegacy Conference, the status of the residual \r\nmechanism and plans to establish ICTY information \r\ncentres in the region. \r\n Finally, Croatia welcomes the work on residual \r\nissues by the Security Council Informal Working \r\nGroup on International Tribunals, including trials of \r\nthe remaining high-profile fugitives. Croatia is \r\nparticularly interested in finding just and practical \r\nsolutions for discharging the Tribunals’ residual \r\nfunctions related to the future of the Tribunals’ \r\narchives, to liaison with the Office of the Prosecutor, \r\nand to exploring the modalities of serving the \r\nsentences. In that regard, we have found particularly \r\nrewarding the open and transparent discussions on \r\nthose issues that have taken place under the Austrian \r\nchairmanship of the Working Group. We are following \r\nthat discussion closely and stand ready to lend our full \r\nsupport and cooperation to the efforts aimed at finding \r\nthe most appropriate and cost-effective solutions to \r\nthese issues. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): We \r\nhave heard the last speaker in the debate on the two \r\nagenda items. May I take it that it is the wish of the \r\nGeneral Assembly to conclude its consideration of \r\nagenda items 71 and 72? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n \r\nProgramme of work \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nshould like to inform members that the plenary meeting \r\ndevoted to the follow-up to the International Year of \r\nMicrocredit, originally scheduled for Monday, \r\n11 October 2010 at 10 a.m., under agenda item 24 (a), \r\n“Eradication of poverty and other development issues: \r\nimplementation of the Second United Nations Decade \r\nfor the Eradication of Poverty (2008-2017)”, has been \r\nrescheduled to Wednesday, 13 October 2010, at 10 a.m. \r\nin the General Assembly Hall. \r\n  The meeting rose at 12.30 p.m. \r\n"
