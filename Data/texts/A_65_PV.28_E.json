(Switzerland) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 111 \r\n \r\nElections to fill vacancies in principal organs \r\n \r\n (a) Election of five non-permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): The General \r\nAssembly will now proceed to the election of five \r\nnon-permanent members of the Security Council to \r\nreplace those members whose term of office expires on \r\n31 December 2010. \r\n The five outgoing non-permanent members are \r\nthe following: Austria, Japan, Mexico, Turkey and \r\nUganda. Those five States cannot be re-elected. Their \r\nnames, therefore, should not appear on the ballot \r\npapers. \r\n Apart from the five permanent members, the \r\nSecurity Council will include in the year 2011 the \r\nfollowing States: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, \r\nGabon, Lebanon and Nigeria. The names of those \r\nStates, therefore, should also not appear on the ballot \r\npapers. \r\n Of the five non-permanent members that will \r\nremain in office in the year 2011, three are from Africa \r\nand Asia, one is from Eastern Europe and one is from \r\nLatin America and the Caribbean. Consequently, \r\npursuant to paragraph 3 of General Assembly \r\nresolution 1991 A (XVIII), of 17 December 1963, the \r\nfive non-permanent members should be elected \r\naccording to the following pattern: two from Africa \r\nand Asia, one from Latin America and the Caribbean \r\nand two from Western Europe and other States. The \r\nballot papers reflect that pattern. \r\n In accordance with established practice, there is \r\nan understanding to the effect that, of the two States to \r\nbe elected from Africa and Asia, one should be from \r\nAfrica and one from Asia. \r\n I should like to inform the Assembly that those \r\ncandidates — their number not exceeding the number \r\nof seats to be filled — receiving the greatest number of \r\nvotes and a two-thirds majority of those present and \r\nvoting, will be declared elected. If the number of \r\ncandidates receiving a two-thirds majority is less than \r\nthe number of members to be elected, we will proceed \r\nto a restricted ballot limited to those candidates that \r\nhave obtained the greatest number of votes in the \r\nprevious ballot, which should not be more than twice \r\nthe seats remaining to be filled. \r\n May I take it that the General Assembly agrees to \r\nthat procedure? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in French): In accordance \r\nwith rule 92 of the rules of procedure, the election shall \r\nbe held by secret ballot and there shall be no \r\nnominations. \r\n Regarding candidatures, I have been informed by \r\nthe Chairpersons of the respective regional groups of \r\nthe following. For the two vacant seats from among the \r\nAfrican and Asian States, two candidates have been \r\ndesignated, namely, South Africa and India. For the \r\nA/65/PV.28  \r\n \r\n10-57620 2 \r\n \r\none vacant seat from among the Latin American and \r\nCaribbean States, there is one endorsed candidate, \r\nnamely, Colombia. For the two vacant seats from \r\namong the Western European and other States, there \r\nare three candidates, namely, Canada, Germany and \r\nPortugal.  \r\n In accordance with rule 92 of the rules of \r\nprocedure, we shall now proceed to the election by \r\nsecret ballot. \r\n Before we begin the voting process, I should like \r\nto remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the \r\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly, no \r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a \r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting. \r\n We shall now begin the voting process. Members \r\nare requested to remain seated until all ballots have \r\nbeen collected. \r\n Ballot papers marked “A”, “B” and “C” will now \r\nbe distributed. I request representatives to use only \r\nthose ballot papers that have been distributed. \r\n May I ask representatives to write clearly on the \r\nballot papers marked “A”, for the African and Asian \r\nStates, the names of the two States for which they wish \r\nto vote; on the ballot papers marked “B”, for the Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean States, the name of the one \r\nState for which they wish to vote; and on the ballot \r\npapers marked “C”, for the Western European and \r\nother States, the names of the two States for which they \r\nwish to vote. \r\n A ballot will be declared invalid if it contains \r\nmore names of Member States from the relevant region \r\nthan the number of seats assigned to it. A ballot will \r\nalso be declared invalid if all the names of the Member \r\nStates on that ballot do not belong to the relevant \r\nregion. If a ballot paper contains names of Member \r\nStates that do not belong to that region, the ballot \r\nremains valid, but only the names of the Member \r\nStates that belong to the relevant region will be \r\ncounted. The names of Member States that do not \r\nbelong to that region will not be counted at all. \r\n At the invitation of the President, Mr. Babadoudou \r\n(Benin), Mr. Toba (Brazil), Mr. Kahiluoto \r\n(Finland), Ms. Satomi (Japan), Mr. Weydert \r\n(Luxembourg) and Ms. Stoica (Romania) acted as \r\ntellers. \r\n A vote was taken by secret ballot. \r\n The meeting was suspended at 10.25 a.m. and \r\nresumed at 11.30 a.m. \r\n The President (spoke in French): The result of \r\nthe voting is as follows: \r\n Group A — African and Asian States \r\n Number of ballot papers:    191 \r\n Number of invalid ballots:    0 \r\n Number of valid ballots:    191 \r\n Abstentions:      1 \r\n Number of members voting:   190 \r\n Required two-thirds majority:   127 \r\n Number of votes obtained: \r\n  India       187 \r\n  South Africa      182 \r\n  Pakistan      1 \r\n  Swaziland      1 \r\n Group B — Latin American and Caribbean States \r\n Number of ballot papers:    191 \r\n Number of invalid ballots:    0 \r\n Number of valid ballots:    191 \r\n Abstentions:      5 \r\n Number of members voting:   186 \r\n Required two-thirds majority:   124 \r\n Number of votes obtained: \r\n  Colombia      186 \r\n Group C — Western European and other States \r\n Number of ballot papers:    191 \r\n Number of invalid ballots:    0 \r\n Number of valid ballots:    191 \r\n Abstentions:      1 \r\n Number of members voting:   190 \r\n Required two-thirds majority:   127 \r\n Number of votes obtained: \r\n  Germany      128 \r\n  Portugal      122 \r\n  Canada      114 \r\n Having obtained the required two-thirds majority, \r\nthe following States were elected members of the \r\nSecurity Council for a two-year term beginning \r\n1 January 2011: Colombia, Germany, India and \r\nSouth Africa. \r\n The President (spoke in French): There remains \r\none seat to be filled from among the Group of Western \r\nEuropean and other States. We shall therefore proceed \r\nto the first restricted ballot. \r\n The second round of balloting shall be restricted \r\nto the two States from among the Western European \r\n A/65/PV.28\r\n \r\n3 10-57620 \r\n \r\nand other States that were not elected but that obtained \r\nthe largest number of votes in the previous ballot, \r\nnamely, Canada and Portugal. That is in accordance \r\nwith rule 94 of the rules of procedure. \r\n Before we begin the voting process, I should like \r\nto remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the \r\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly, no \r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a \r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting. \r\n We shall now begin the voting process. \r\n Ballot papers marked “C” will now be distributed. \r\nMay I ask representatives to write on the ballot papers \r\nthe name of the State for which they wish to vote. \r\nBallot papers marked “C” for Western European and \r\nother States will be declared invalid if they contain the \r\nname of a State other than Canada or Portugal, as well \r\nas if they contain the names of more than one State. \r\n At the invitation of the President, Mr. Babadoudou \r\n(Benin), Mr. Toba (Brazil), Mr. Kahiluoto \r\n(Finland), Ms. Satomi (Japan), Mr. Weydert \r\n(Luxembourg) and Ms. Stoica (Romania) acted as \r\ntellers. \r\n A vote was taken by secret ballot. \r\n The meeting was suspended at 11.40 a.m. and \r\nresumed at 12.10 p.m. \r\n The President (spoke in French): The result of \r\nthe voting is as follows: \r\n Group C — Western European and other States \r\n Number of ballot papers:    192 \r\n Number of invalid ballots:    1 \r\n Number of valid ballots:    191 \r\n Abstentions:      0 \r\n Number of members voting:   191 \r\n Required two-thirds majority:   128 \r\n Number of votes obtained: \r\n  Portugal      113 \r\n  Canada      78 \r\n As no candidate has received the required two-\r\nthirds majority in the preceding ballot, there remains \r\none seat to be filled from among the Group of Western \r\nEuropean and other States. We shall therefore proceed \r\nto the second restricted ballot. \r\n The third round of balloting shall be restricted to \r\nthe two States from among the Western European and \r\nother States that were not elected but that obtained the \r\nlargest number of votes in the previous ballot, namely, \r\nCanada and Portugal.
