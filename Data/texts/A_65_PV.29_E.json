I \r\nshall begin by making a statement on my own behalf.  \r\n Our plenary meeting today, 13 October 2010, is \r\ndevoted to the follow-up to the International Year of \r\nMicrocredit. This issue seems to me to be particularly \r\nrelevant for at least two reasons. First, it is important to \r\nensure that the issues brought to the international \r\ncommunity’s attention when an international year is \r\nproclaimed do not drop out of sight afterwards. Our \r\ncredibility depends on it. The publication of the “Blue \r\nBook” and the establishment of the United Nations \r\nAdvisers Group on Inclusive Financial Sectors have \r\nalready represented important milestones in this regard. \r\n In addition, this meeting is taking place just three \r\nweeks after the High-level Plenary Meeting on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. Microfinance has an \r\nessential role to play in efforts to achieve the Goals — \r\none need only cite the improvement in women’s access \r\nto financial services, their consequent empowerment \r\nand the indirect positive effects this has on children’s \r\nschooling and health care. \r\n Microfinance is a key instrument for improving \r\nthe living conditions of poor populations. The \r\nconsiderable growth of microfinance over the past few \r\nyears can be described as a success. This development \r\nhas been fostered by a strong partnership among \r\nGovernments, non-governmental organizations, civil \r\nsociety and the private sector. Innovative practices and \r\nnew stakeholders have emerged. These developments \r\nare encouraging, but more needs to be done. \r\n The report (A/65/267) of the Secretary-General \r\non the role of microcredit and microfinance in the \r\neradication of poverty reveals a number of limitations. \r\nGeographical coverage is uneven and rural areas are \r\nstill often excluded. In general, microfinance has \r\ndifficulty reaching the poorest populations, which are \r\nprecisely the ones at whom it is directed. Most \r\nsignificantly, another basic finding is that, while \r\nmicrofinance helps to improve the lives of the poor, it \r\ncannot lift them permanently out of poverty. \r\nMicrofinance is not sufficient to generate productive \r\nactivities. It does, however, have significant \r\neducational potential in terms of introducing poor \r\npopulations to market mechanisms and activities, of \r\nwhich they know little.  \r\n We should draw lessons from the experience \r\ngained thus far so as to take better advantage of the \r\npotential of microfinance. Just as we developed the \r\nA/65/PV.29  \r\n \r\n10-57862 2 \r\n \r\ninitial concept of microcredit into the concept of \r\nmicrofinance, the better to reflect the wider range of \r\nfinancial services offered, we should now take \r\nappropriate steps to give effect to the idea of inclusive \r\nfinance, thus ensuring that the financial sector \r\npromotes the creation of jobs and productive activities, \r\nand is thus placed at the service of the poorest and of \r\nsociety as a whole. \r\n To that end I invite the Assembly to consider the \r\nrecommendations made by the Secretary-General in his \r\nreport. I wish members a fruitful debate.  \r\n Mr. De Bassompierre (Belgium): I have the \r\nhonour to speak on behalf of the European Union (EU). \r\nThe candidate countries of Turkey, Croatia and the \r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia; the countries \r\nof the Stabilization and Association Process and \r\npotential candidates of Albania, Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia; as well as \r\nUkraine, the Republic of Moldova, Armenia and \r\nGeorgia, align themselves with this declaration. \r\n Let me first thank you, Sir, for organizing this \r\nmeeting of the General Assembly on the follow-up to \r\nthe 2005 International Year of Microcredit. It is the \r\nEU’s conviction that an inclusive financial sector, and \r\nin particular microfinance and microcredit, is a very \r\nimportant tool in the global effort to alleviate poverty \r\nand achieve the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). An inclusive financial sector and \r\nmicrofinance can contribute to sustainable and \r\ninclusive growth as a basis for sustainable development, \r\nand can help lift poor people out of poverty, \r\nparticularly women and rural populations.  \r\n Five years have gone by since the International \r\nYear of Microcredit, and the world has changed. In \r\nthese five years, microfinance and microcredit have \r\ngained significant momentum, and the microcredit \r\nagenda has gradually evolved into a much broader \r\napproach of financial inclusion. Addressing the broader \r\nagenda of financial inclusion was one of the objectives \r\nof the United Nations Advisers Group on Inclusive \r\nFinancial Sectors, established in 2006 as follow-up to \r\nthe International Year of Microcredit. This change is \r\nreflected in the outcome document of the High-level \r\nPlenary Meeting on the MDGs, which refers to  \r\n “Promoting inclusive financial services, \r\nparticularly microfinance, and including \r\naffordable and accessible credit, savings, \r\ninsurance and payments products for all segments \r\nof society, especially women, people in \r\nvulnerable situations and those who would not \r\nnormally be served”. (resolution 65/1, para. 70) \r\n The Secretary-General’s report (A/65/267) on the \r\nrole of microcredit and microfinance in the eradication \r\nof poverty and the annual report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s Special Advocate for Inclusive Finance for \r\nDevelopment, Her Royal Highness Princess Máxima of \r\nthe Netherlands, offer an excellent base for broadening \r\nthe debate. That is the approach we need to adopt in \r\nboth the General Assembly and the Second Committee. \r\n Financial inclusion means universal access at a \r\nreasonable cost to a range of financial services for \r\neveryone needing them, provided by a diversity of \r\nsound and sustainable institutions. Financial inclusion \r\nincludes microfinance and microcredit, but also \r\nservices related to savings, payments and remittances, \r\nas well as insurance for individuals, \r\nmicroentrepreneurs and small- and medium-sized \r\nenterprises. It helps increase productivity and creates \r\nincome. It generates jobs. It also protects people \r\nagainst unforeseen shocks and helps them to manage \r\ncash flow and build assets over time. Having an \r\ninclusive financial infrastructure is very important for \r\nsustainable and inclusive growth. \r\n Support to microfinance is part of the European \r\nUnion’s development cooperation. During the period \r\n2005-2009, support for microenterprises and \r\nmicrofinance has been ensured through the EU \r\nMicrofinance Framework Programme, with €15 million \r\nfor African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, in \r\ncollaboration with investment in debt and equity for \r\nbanks and microfinance institutions provided by the \r\nEuropean Investment Bank (EIB). As of the end of \r\n2009, the EIB group committed some €654 million to \r\naround 30 microfinance projects or intermediaries, \r\nincluding €26 million in grants for technical assistance. \r\nThe European Union’s new Microfinance Programme \r\nII, for the period 2010-2014, will support the \r\nmicrofinance sector in African, Caribbean and Pacific \r\ncountries with €57 million, including €15 million from \r\nthe tenth European Development Fund.  \r\n The EU is committed to continue supporting the \r\nestablishment of an inclusive financial sector that \r\nprovides appropriate financial services to poor \r\nhouseholds and microenterprises. The need for \r\ncapacity-building — human resources and \r\ninstitutions — of microfinance institutions is of great \r\n A/65/PV.29\r\n \r\n3 10-57862 \r\n \r\nimportance, as are private sector participation and \r\neffective partnerships. Responsible finance also \r\ncomprises the promotion of financial literacy. These \r\nwill be critical to the successful expansion of inclusive \r\nfinance on a massive scale. The increased use of \r\ninformation and communication technologies solutions, \r\nsuch as branchless banking, offers considerable \r\npotential for broadening access through the use of cell \r\nphones, bank cards and banking agents such as retail \r\nstores and post offices. Prudential regulation should \r\nguarantee that financial services will be provided in a \r\nway that is transparent, responsible and to the benefit \r\nof clients. \r\n At the same time, the European Union would also \r\nlike to stress that financial exclusion is not only an \r\nissue for developing countries; problems of access to \r\nfinance are also relevant in advanced economies. \r\nSharing experiences on ways to improve financial \r\ninclusion is therefore of interest to all development \r\npartners. In this respect let me briefly mention the \r\nEuropean Microfinance Platform, which aims to \r\nexchange best practices and policies regarding \r\nmicrofinance in developing countries by bringing \r\ntogether stakeholders from the public and private \r\nsectors as well as from civil society. Two important \r\ninitiatives are worth mentioning in this respect.  \r\n The first is the 2010 European Microfinance \r\nWeek, which will be held in Luxembourg at the end of \r\nNovember, and the second is the third European \r\nMicrofinance Award, which will be awarded on that \r\noccasion on 30 November 2010, with the objective of \r\npromoting initiatives in value-chain finance. The EU \r\nalso welcomes the ongoing work of the Group of 20 \r\n(G-20) on financial inclusion and the G-20 principles \r\nfor innovative financial inclusion, endorsed in Toronto. \r\n To conclude, let me highlight that the EU looks \r\nforward to cooperating with other Member States, \r\nUnited Nations bodies and all relevant stakeholders to \r\nfurther promote universal access to financial services.  \r\n Mr. Shukla (India): Allow me to begin by \r\nthanking the United Nations and all those working \r\ntirelessly for the promotion of microcredit as a tool for \r\nthe eradication of poverty.  \r\n The Secretary-General’s report (A/65/267), \r\nsubmitted in accordance with resolution 63/229 and \r\nagainst the backdrop of the Second United Nations \r\nDecade for the Eradication of Poverty, is an insightful \r\nsummary of the global microcredit experience, with \r\nvaluable lessons for all of us. The development of \r\nmicrocredit and microfinance as a strategy to eradicate \r\npoverty was the central theme of the International Year \r\nof Microcredit in 2005. It is well recognized that \r\nmicrocredit and microfinance as policy platforms have \r\ncontributed significantly to socio-economic \r\ndevelopment and poverty reduction, especially in \r\ndeveloping countries. \r\n As a market-based approach to fighting poverty, \r\nmicrofinance is focused on developing \r\nentrepreneurship and expanding self-employment. \r\nMicrofinance institutions, which number more than \r\n3,500 worldwide today, serve approximately \r\n155 million people the world over. As microfinance \r\ninstitutions have demonstrated the sustainability of \r\nmicrolending, commercial banks have transformed the \r\nmodel into a major global industry. Between 2004 and \r\n2008 these institutions experienced average annual \r\nasset growth of 39 per cent and accumulated more than \r\n$60 billion in total assets.  \r\n However, we remain concerned about the high \r\nrates of interest charged by commercial microfinance \r\nentities. Governments must address this anomaly \r\nthrough policy intervention. Microfinance schemes \r\nhave also demonstrated their viability to bring about \r\nsocial change, especially the promotion of women’s \r\nempowerment and gender equality. Many such \r\nprogrammes in the developing world are accompanied \r\nby social service schemes and act as social safety nets \r\nin times of crisis. The insurance schemes of \r\nmicrofinance provide inexpensive short-term coverage \r\nfor life, health, property, livestock, crops and natural \r\ndisasters. \r\n India, which has the largest microcredit network \r\nin the world, has had significant success with the \r\nprogramme. In particular, I would like to mention the \r\nimpressive performance of microcredit schemes being \r\nrun by self-help groups in India, which today number \r\naround 2.2 million. Based on the microcredit model, \r\nwe are also running micropension schemes for the \r\ninformal sector, a large segment of our economy that \r\notherwise could not have availed itself of social \r\nsecurity benefits. \r\n Notwithstanding the success of microfinance, we \r\nare well aware of its limitations as a poverty reduction \r\nstrategy. But in the final analysis of things, going by \r\nour experience in India and what we have noted across \r\nthe world, I must say that microfinance has been able \r\nA/65/PV.29  \r\n \r\n10-57862 4 \r\n \r\nto play a significant role in dealing with poverty \r\nreduction and social development in developing \r\ncountries. The financial and economic crisis has \r\nseverely impacted the liquidity of microfinance \r\ninstitutions and has weakened their ability to offer \r\ninnovative services. The crisis also led to the \r\nrealization among Governments that it was time to \r\nmove from a microcredit and microfinance regime to \r\nmore comprehensive financial inclusion. \r\n India has set a goal to make every village in the \r\ncountry financially included through mobile banks by \r\n2015. The expansion of information and \r\ncommunication technology services has fuelled the \r\ngrowth of microfinance. The concept of branchless \r\nbanking through mobile phones, bank cards and \r\nbanking agents has met with particular success in \r\ndeveloping countries. In the least developed countries \r\nand in Africa it has established direct channels for \r\nreceiving remittances and has spurred the domestic \r\nmobilization of resources.  \r\n In conclusion, I would like to say that India is \r\nstrongly committed to financial inclusion for all and \r\ncalls for the further expansion of the microcredit and \r\nmicrofinance strategy for achieving poverty reduction \r\nand other Millennium Development Goal targets. I end \r\nwith greetings to all co-workers throughout the world \r\ninvolved in this task. \r\n Mr. Eggleston (Australia): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the Australian Government and am \r\nvery grateful for the opportunity to address the General \r\nAssembly during this important follow-up to the 2005 \r\nInternational Year of Microcredit.  \r\n Australia sees the financial inclusion of the poor \r\nas essential to the reduction of poverty, sustainable \r\ndevelopment and progress towards the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. Some 2.7 billion adults around the \r\nworld lack access to banking services. \r\n Access to a wide set of financial tools, such as \r\ncredit, savings products, payment and transfer services \r\nand insurance, helps poor people to increase their \r\nincome and build assets. Through financial services, \r\npoor people can set up small businesses, insure against \r\ncrop losses and save in case of illness or disaster. \r\nMicrofinance is a particularly important tool for \r\npromoting gender equality and the empowerment of \r\nwomen.  \r\n Over two-thirds of microfinance clients \r\nthroughout the world are women. When women are \r\nprovided with access to finance, the whole household \r\nbenefits. Women with access to microfinance can have \r\ngreater control over their incomes and more power in \r\nhousehold decision-making. Through microfinance \r\nprogrammes, women often gain new vocational skills, \r\nself-confidence and greater leadership, resulting in an \r\nenhanced ability to drive change within both the \r\nhousehold and the broader community. \r\n Australia supports financial inclusion initiatives \r\nacross the globe, from the Pacific island countries of \r\nPapua New Guinea and, Timor-Leste, in the Asia-\r\nPacific region,, to countries far outside our region, \r\nincluding Iraq, and Peru and Colombia in South \r\nAmerica. Australia’s approach to supporting financial \r\ninclusion is outlined in the document entitled \r\n“Financial services for the poor: a strategy for the \r\nAustralian aid programme 2010-15”, which was \r\nlaunched earlier this year. Through this strategy \r\nAustralia will build the capacity of financial \r\ninstitutions to offer quality, affordable and fair \r\nfinancial services to the poor and assist Governments \r\nto create an enabling policy and regulatory \r\nenvironment. We will seek to utilize the potential of \r\nnew technologies and we will support financial literacy \r\nprogrammes to help people in developing countries \r\nunderstand their finances and the services available to \r\nthem. \r\n It is clear that an enabling policy environment \r\nand a supportive legal and regulatory framework are \r\nessential for the sustainable growth of financial \r\nservices to the poor. Governments play a crucial role in \r\ncreating a policy environment that promotes the \r\nexpansion of financial services while also protecting \r\nconsumers against predatory service providers, \r\nincluding by ensuring effective interest- rate disclosure. \r\nAustralia is working within the Pacific Islands Forum \r\nEconomic Ministers’ Meeting to ensure that financial \r\ninclusion is high on the agenda for finance and \r\neconomic ministers in our region.  \r\n Current work with our Pacific region partners is \r\nhelping to facilitate the transfer of remittances and \r\npromoting the use of new technologies, including \r\nmobile phones for branchless banking. Technology \r\nsuch as mobile telephones, point-of-sale devices and \r\nlow-cost automatic teller machines offer great potential \r\nin strengthening access to financial services, especially \r\nfor the poor in rural and sparsely populated areas \r\n A/65/PV.29\r\n \r\n5 10-57862 \r\n \r\nwhere high transaction costs have impeded the \r\ndevelopment of traditional financial services.  \r\n When new technology is appropriately used, \r\nfinancial institutions no longer have to open numerous \r\nbricks-and-mortar branches to provide and expand \r\nservices. In addition, new technology-based \r\nmicrofinance models can significantly reduce \r\ntransaction costs as compared to conventional banking \r\nmodels. Innovative models of financial service delivery \r\ncan provide a range of services previously unavailable \r\nto the poor, including savings, payments and transfer \r\nservices. The Australian Government is committed to \r\nsupporting institutions and fostering partnerships that \r\npush the frontiers of technology and innovation to \r\nexpand the provision of financial services to the poor.  \r\n We also recognize the importance of supporting \r\nfinancial education. Financial education can provide \r\nthe poor with the skills and knowledge needed to take \r\nadvantage of financial opportunities and plan for the \r\nfuture. Financial education forms a vital cornerstone in \r\nensuring that the poor are protected and treated fairly \r\nwhen using financial services. The lack of financial \r\nliteracy is also a key contributing factor to over-\r\nindebtedness, which can push poor people even deeper \r\ninto poverty. \r\n Australia supports the efforts of the Group of 20 \r\n(G-20) to promote financial services for the poor and is \r\npleased to contribute as co-Chair with Brazil of the \r\nG-20 financial inclusion experts group. The nine \r\nprinciples for innovative financial inclusion endorsed \r\nby the G-20 leaders in Toronto in June set important \r\nstandards for financial access, financial literacy and \r\nconsumer protection. \r\n Australia will continue to work closely with our \r\ndevelopment partners to unlock the potential of \r\nfinancial services for the poor. Thank you, Mr. \r\nPresident, for the opportunity to contribute to this \r\nimportant debate. \r\n Mr. AlJarallah (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nGeneral Assembly today is today discussing one of the \r\nmost important items on the agenda of theist sixty-fifth \r\nsession, given the enormous and real challenge posed \r\nby the issue of eradicating poverty represents. It is a \r\ngoal that requires us all to stand side by side in order to \r\nconfront and eliminate it.  \r\n My country’s delegation is pleased to convey its \r\nthanks to the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for \r\nhis detailed report (A/65/267) on the implementation of \r\nthe Second United Nations Decade for the Eradication \r\nof Poverty (2008-2017), as well as and also for the \r\nimportant recommendations it provides for the purpose \r\nof facing up to the challenges posed by poverty and by \r\ntrying to reach other relevant development goals.  \r\n We also extend our thanks to the Director-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations Industrial Development \r\nOrganization, Mr. Kinder Yokels, and his team for the \r\nefforts they have exerted made in the preparation of a \r\nreport on cooperation in the field of industrial \r\ndevelopment, which contains a thorough account of the \r\nlatest developments in that area and of the obstacles \r\nencountered by the least developed countries that \r\ndiminish their chances of entering to enter the global \r\nmarket for manufactured goods. \r\n Three weeks ago in this Hall, a summit Meeting \r\nwas held that brought together heads of State and \r\nGovernment to review progress in the achievement of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. At the summit, \r\nleaders committed themselves to make every effort and \r\nto double their donations to achieve the Goals by 2015. \r\nIn that context, it is important that States continue to \r\nintensify their efforts to achieve Goal 1, namely, to \r\nreduce by half the number of people living in hunger \r\nand poverty.  \r\n That is still an important objective, despite \r\ndiscouraging number of indicators, showing that the \r\nnumber of poor people in the world rose to more than \r\n1 billion in 2009. That increase was the direct result of \r\nthe new challenges the world currently faces, such as \r\nthe increase in food prices, fluctuating energy prices, \r\nother challenges, and the world economic crisis. All of \r\nthat requires that we unite our efforts, consolidate the \r\nconcept of global partnership and promote collective \r\nefforts by States in order to grapple with and eradicate \r\nthe scourge of poverty. \r\n The State of Kuwait has spared no effort to \r\nprovide assistance to developing and least developed \r\ncountries through its official and non-official \r\ninstitutions. Since gaining independence, in 1961, my \r\ncountry has been keen to provide assistance to the \r\ninternational community in order to ease human \r\nsuffering in various parts of the world. As it has over \r\nthe past 50 years, the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic \r\nDevelopment has continued to provide grants and \r\nassistance to more than 100 countries throughout the \r\nworld, including guaranteed concessionary loans in \r\nA/65/PV.29  \r\n \r\n10-57862 6 \r\n \r\nexcess of $14.5 billion. That is equivalent to 1.31 per \r\ncent of my country’s gross domestic product, and \r\ndouble the internationally agreed official development \r\nassistance target.  \r\n Based on my country’s firm belief in the vital and \r\neffective role of United Nations organs, the State of \r\nKuwait is committed to providing annual voluntary \r\ncontributions to a number of international and regional \r\norganizations and specialized United Nations agencies \r\nactive in the areas of development and humanitarian \r\nassistance. My country has also undertaken initiatives \r\naimed at stimulating economic growth and raising the \r\nstandard of living in poor countries affected by the rise \r\nin the price of basic foodstuffs. To that end, in addition \r\nto cooperating with similar initiatives throughout the \r\nworld, we have established the Fund for Decent Living, \r\nwhich is capitalized with $100 million for the purpose \r\nof supporting initiatives to speedily provide basic food \r\nstaples to needy people and to contribute to \r\nprogrammes aimed at increasing the yield of \r\nagricultural crops. Kuwait has also allocated \r\n$300 million to combat poverty in Africa through the \r\nIslamic Development Bank. \r\n The process of eradicating poverty requires \r\ndiligent hard work and intensified joint efforts, in \r\naddition to sincere and serious commitment. It is high \r\ntime for the international community to accomplish a \r\ntangible measure of progress in fulfilling its \r\ncommitments. The most important thing we look \r\nforward to is for States to honour their obligations. We \r\nalso hope that donor States will meet the promises they \r\ntook upon themselves to provide financial and \r\ntechnical assistance and devote 0.07 per cent of their \r\ngross domestic product to official development \r\nassistance.  \r\n In the same vein, eradicating poverty requires a \r\ncommitment from developing countries to put in place \r\ntransparent financial, monetary and trading systems \r\nthat are compatible with the demands of the world \r\nmarket and in line with the international financial \r\nsystem. They should also consolidate their capabilities \r\nin the field of macroeconomics, strengthen their \r\nnational development strategies and undertake social \r\nand political reforms with a view to achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and securing the \r\ndesired development. \r\n Mrs. Wahab (Indonesia): Our meeting today \r\ntakes on increased significance, as it follows on the \r\nheels of the General Assembly Meeting held three \r\nweeks ago to find ways to accelerate the achievement \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\nDespite the multiple crises that have had a negative \r\nimpact on the global economy, leaders at the MDG \r\nsummit affirmed the need to achieve the Goals by 2015 \r\nand to bring an end to poverty. It was agreed that \r\nMDG 1, namely, to eradicate poverty and hunger, \r\nremained the most critical challenge to development at \r\nthe global level. Accomplishing that MDG will have an \r\neffect on the attainment of most other MDGs. \r\n Because of the capacity of microcredit and \r\nmicrofinance to create jobs and facilitate the business \r\nambitions of the poor, the follow-up to the 2005 \r\nInternational Year of Microcredit provides a vital \r\nopportunity to successfully engage the challenge of \r\npoverty. The widespread use of such resources will \r\ntherefore advance the MDG implementation process. It \r\nis for that reason that we have gathered here in the Hall \r\ntoday, to determine how best to maximize the use of \r\nmicrocredit and microfinance in poverty reduction. \r\n Contrary to expectations, the existing model of \r\ndevelopment does not always work as efficiently as it \r\ncould to combat poverty. In fact, the current global \r\nfinancial and economic crisis points to imbalances \r\nresulting from the operation of that model. There are \r\ntoo many have-nots. Indeed, development experts have \r\npointed out that development that perpetuates \r\ninequalities will prove neither sustainable nor worth \r\nsustaining in the long run. Just and equitable \r\ndistribution of national resources to promote economic \r\ngrowth and development will therefore, of necessity, \r\nrespond to the special needs and problems facing the \r\npoor. \r\n The recognition of that fact led to the declaration \r\nof 2005 as the International Year of Microcredit. The \r\nYear brought about increased public awareness and \r\nunderstanding of the social and economic value of \r\nmicrocredit and microfinance. In addition, the \r\nfollowing years have amply demonstrated that the \r\nstrategic use of microcredit by developing countries \r\ncan lead to the achievement of many targets set out in \r\nthe MDGs, especially with regard to job creation. \r\nGiven the importance of microcredit and microfinance \r\nin achieving MDG targets, Indonesia would like to \r\nhighlight some pertinent points to justify intensifying \r\ntheir use in poverty reduction.  \r\n A/65/PV.29\r\n \r\n7 10-57862 \r\n \r\n First, the poor must be given access to resources \r\nto overcome their severe deprivation. With increased \r\naccess to financial resources and services, the poor in \r\ndeveloping regions have been known to satisfy the \r\nhealth and educational needs of their children. Others \r\nhave been able to set up microenterprises and achieve \r\nsome measure of financial independence. To that end, \r\nGovernments must ensure that the poor have better \r\naccess to financial services. In addition, steps should \r\nbe taken to promote financial literacy among the poor.  \r\n Secondly, the financial needs of smallholder \r\nfarmers should not be ignored. They must be \r\nguaranteed access to resources so that agricultural \r\nproductivity can be boosted. The importance of \r\nagriculture to the real economy cannot be \r\noverstressed — more so in the light of the recent food \r\ncrisis, which had an impact on many poor nations.  \r\n Thirdly, the use of microcredit and microfinance \r\nshould be gender-sensitive. As agents of development \r\nwhose needs are often overlooked, due care must be \r\ntaken to ensure that microcredit reaches into the lives \r\nof poor women. The availability of resources must \r\nmatch their contributions to economic development. \r\n Indonesia has its own microcredit success stories \r\nto share. Our nation is on a development path that \r\nstresses economic growth with equity and social justice \r\nfor all. Our awareness that biases in national economic \r\nand social policies can contribute to poverty have led \r\nus to strengthen our country’s capacity to make \r\nmaximum use of microfinance and microcredit. \r\nMicrofinance is disbursed through formal banking \r\nfacilities, such as the People’s Bank of Indonesia, and \r\nthrough non-banking agencies that are managed by \r\nnon-governmental organizations and self-help groups. \r\nThese are important institutions because 98.5 per cent \r\nof Indonesia’s business sector can be categorized as \r\nmicroenterprises. These facilities have therefore helped \r\nto keep poverty in check. \r\n Our credit for the smallholders programme is \r\namong the projects in our national medium-term \r\ndevelopment plan for the period 2010 to 2014 that have \r\nhad an impact on the development of small- and \r\nmedium-sized enterprises and cooperatives in \r\nIndonesia. My country is committed to expanding the \r\ncoverage of such credit beginning in 2011. In addition, \r\nthe Government is also encouraging self-help groups \r\nand foundations, such as the Microfinance Innovation \r\nCentre for Resources and Alternatives foundation, to \r\nenhance poor peoples’ access to credit offered by \r\nIndonesia’s microfinance institutions. Owing to our \r\npolicies and programmes designed to combat poverty, \r\nIndonesia’s poverty rate fell from 16.7 per cent in \r\n2004 — or 36.1 million persons — to 14.1 per cent in \r\nMarch 2009 — or 32.5 million persons. The goal is to \r\nreduce the poverty rate to 8 to 10 per cent by 2014.  \r\n Despite its successes, Indonesia recognizes that a \r\ngreat deal of work must be done to further reduce \r\npoverty through the strategic use of the microfinance \r\nsector, which is only now growing in significance at \r\nthe global level. For its part, Indonesia will focus on \r\nthe legal and regulatory framework to improve the \r\nefficiency and effectiveness of its microfinance sector.  \r\n In light of this, as a State member of the Group of \r\n20, Indonesia welcomes the Group’s decision to foster \r\nan enabling policy and regulatory environment for \r\ninnovative financial inclusion. At its summit in Toronto \r\nin June, the Group endorsed principles that will serve \r\nto increase the access of the poor to financial resources \r\nand services.  \r\n There are other tools that can be used to good \r\neffect. Indonesia believes that the United Nations \r\n“Blue Book”, entitled Building Inclusive Financial \r\nSectors for Development, provides the policy \r\nframework for countries to turn their microfinance \r\ncommitments into concrete action. Equally important, \r\nvaluable successes should be replicated where \r\nconditions and circumstances permit. In this way, \r\nMember States will advance efforts aimed at achieving \r\nthe goals set out by the International Year of \r\nMicrocredit. \r\n Mr. Mashabane (South Africa): At the outset, I \r\nshould like to welcome the convening of this important \r\nevent, which offers us an opportunity to broaden and \r\ndeepen the discussion on microcredit and microfinance, \r\nas well as inclusive financial sectors.  \r\n We are mindful of the fact that the General \r\nAssembly designated the year 2005 as the International \r\nYear of Microcredit and supported devoting that year \r\nto the ongoing challenge of eradicating poverty, which \r\nis also part of the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nSince that time, the General Assembly has underscored \r\nthe importance of microfinance as an instrument for \r\nsocio-economic development and regarded \r\nmicrofinance as a useful tool in the eradication of \r\npoverty. \r\nA/65/PV.29  \r\n \r\n10-57862 8 \r\n \r\n Today, we hold this plenary meeting to consider \r\nthe outcome of and follow-up to the International Year \r\nof Microcredit. This meeting takes place against the \r\nbackdrop of the recent discussions held on the \r\neradication of poverty in the context of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. We are once again looking at the \r\neradication of poverty with a specific focus on \r\nmicrocredit and microfinance. South Africa recognizes \r\nthe role of microfinance as a catalyst for sustainable \r\ndevelopment and growth. Microfinance has proved to \r\nbe a powerful tool to bring financial services to the \r\npoor, who would otherwise be excluded from them. \r\n South Africa has undertaken a number of \r\ninitiatives towards contributing to some of the \r\nundertakings related to the International Year of \r\nMicrocredit. In ensuring that sustainable institutions \r\nare built to provide affordable and appropriate financial \r\nservices for the poor in a sustainable manner, the South \r\nAfrican Microfinance Apex Fund and the Micro-\r\nAgricultural Finance Initiative of South Africa were set \r\nup as wholesale finance and institutional development \r\ninstitutions to provide support to microcredit, \r\nagricultural and cooperative programmes. Other \r\ninitiatives include the formalization of the cooperative \r\nbanking sector through the Co-operatives Banks Act \r\nand the regularization of the activities of the Post Bank. \r\n Promoting an inclusive financial sector and \r\nsupporting sustainable access to financial services are \r\ncentral to South Africa’s programme of developing and \r\ntransforming the financial sector. The development of \r\nthe financial sector in a manner that provides access to \r\nthe poor can achieve economic growth, stimulate job \r\ncreation, overcome social exclusion and reduce poverty. \r\nSouth Africa believes that microfinance will contribute \r\nto achieving its objectives of poverty reduction, \r\nemployment creation and the empowerment of women. \r\nHence, South Africa will continue its efforts to develop \r\nand grow a sustainable microfinance industry by \r\nproviding the relevant technical support, funding and \r\nconducive regulatory framework, with a special focus \r\non the poor and women in particular.  \r\n According to international estimates, women \r\nrepresent more than 70 per cent of all microfinance \r\nclients. This positive discrimination has multiplier \r\neffects for their families. Women have the burden of \r\nresponsibility for providing their families with food, \r\nfuel and water. They should have access to financial \r\nservices that allow them to shoulder their \r\nresponsibilities with less uncertainty. By being able to \r\nengage in income-generating activities, women are \r\nable to provide their families with more stability, better \r\naccess to education and, consequently, more \r\nopportunity to lift the next generation out of poverty.  \r\n South Africa shares the views of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his report (A/65/267) that microfinance is \r\npart of a strategy to promote women’s empowerment \r\nand gender equality. We agree that, with women largely \r\nexcluded from the formal financial sector and subject \r\nto various forms of gender discrimination, there is an \r\nurgent need to deepen and broaden their inclusion in \r\nfinancial activity. \r\n In conclusion, we believe that the continued \r\nvalue of this event is that we are able to talk about a \r\ntopic that is immensely valuable to our efforts to \r\npromote access to microfinance, which has proved to \r\nbe beneficial to our people in the fight against poverty. \r\n Mrs. Rubiales de Chamorro (Nicaragua) (spoke \r\nin Spanish): Nicaragua, like the rest of the world, has \r\nhad to endure an international context characterized by \r\nthe deep negative effects of the world economic and \r\nfinancial crisis. Although subject to these conditions, \r\nthe Government of National Unity and Reconciliation \r\nled by President Daniel Ortega Saavedra has been able \r\nto make progress in the fight against poverty — so \r\nmuch so that independent studies have announced that \r\nNicaragua has reached Millennium Development \r\nGoal 1. \r\n Nicaragua today is a nation free of illiteracy, \r\nenjoying free education and health care, with a school \r\nmeal programme selected as one of the four best in the \r\nworld by the Food and Agriculture Organization. We \r\nhave also opened the doors to microcredit, putting \r\nparticular stress on empowering women, especially in \r\nthe area of agriculture, where we are pioneer grain \r\nexporters for Central America.  \r\n Historically, the Sandinista revolution gave \r\nwomen a primary role in all affairs related to \r\ndevelopment in Nicaragua. Today, the great majority of \r\nsocial projects — such as the ongoing microcredit \r\nempowerment programmes — are directed explicitly at \r\nNicaraguan women. I refer in particular to the Hambre \r\nCero and Usura Cero programmes; programmes to \r\npromote self-sufficiency in agricultural seeds and home \r\nsavings; and other support programmes for the \r\nproduction of basic grains and for small- and medium-\r\nsized enterprises through agricultural financing. \r\n A/65/PV.29\r\n \r\n9 10-57862 \r\n \r\n These microcredit programmes not only give \r\naccess to financing for their own development to \r\nhundreds of thousands of families — in other words, at \r\nleast 1 million Nicaraguans — but are also \r\naccompanied by technical training with a holistic focus, \r\nwhich includes components to protect the environment.  \r\n All this has in turn created a virtuous circle \r\nthrough which the empowerment of the most \r\ndispossessed has strengthened the creation of jobs, the \r\nnational production system and Nicaragua’s economic \r\ninfrastructure, playing a true buffer role to protect us \r\nfrom the worst effects of the economic crisis of 2009. \r\nIndeed, Nicaragua suffered one of the lowest levels of \r\neconomic contraction of almost any country in the \r\nAmerican continent. This would not have been possible \r\nif we had not broken with the neoliberal model and its \r\nWashington consensus, which promote deregulation, \r\nprivatization and the minimization of the State, \r\nincluding its redistributive role. \r\n As highlighted in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Governments can do much to build inclusive \r\nfinancial sectors to maintain macroeconomic stability \r\nthrough sound monetary and fiscal policies, \r\ninfrastructure development and the promotion of access \r\nto financing for the poorest of the poor. Together with \r\nother development strategies focused on creating \r\nhuman capital and an enabling environment, this has \r\nallowed us to maximize the potential of microfinancing \r\nto eradicate poverty. The Nicaraguan revolution is a \r\nliving example that, with political will, we can do \r\nthings. \r\n Ms. Wong (Singapore): I thank you, \r\nMr. President, for the opportunity to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly today.  \r\n The eradication of poverty promotes an indelible \r\nsense of peace and security. The architect of the \r\nMarshall Plan, George C. Marshall, said that “[w]ars \r\nare bred by poverty and oppression. Continued peace is \r\npossible only in a relatively free and prosperous world”. \r\nMarshall was confronting the devastated and \r\nimbalanced landscape of European economies after the \r\nSecond World War.  \r\n Today, a similarly daunting global landscape of \r\npoverty confronts us. In 2000, our leaders pledged to \r\ntackle the situation by committing to the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, but we remain far from attaining \r\nthem. Rising commodity prices, internal and cross-\r\nborder conflict and natural disasters are just some of \r\nthe factors hampering developing countries’ efforts to \r\npull their populations out of poverty. Even among \r\ndeveloped countries, there remains an underclass that \r\nhas not been able to participate in the economic \r\nopportunities available to fellow citizens. It is a sad \r\nstate of affairs that, in the twenty-first century, millions \r\nstill lack access to such basic needs as food, shelter, \r\nhealth, education and security. \r\n A reassessment of poverty eradication philosophy \r\nand methods is needed. Financing to provide \r\nindividuals with access to food, shelter, health, \r\neducation and security is important, but it is only one \r\naspect of development assistance. The vision of \r\nMuhammad Yunus, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and \r\nfounder of Grameen Bank, of putting “poverty in a \r\nmuseum” is underpinned by the philosophy that to \r\nraise people out of poverty we must empower them to \r\npursue economic self-advancement. In Muhammad’s \r\nmodel, financing in the form of microcredit is not used \r\nto fulfil the needs of the poor directly; rather, it is used \r\nto equip individuals with the means to provide for their \r\nown needs. In this way, financing is used as a tool to \r\nspur self-reliance and self-sufficiency. \r\n Singapore shares the philosophy that if we are to \r\nsee sustained results from our efforts to raise people \r\nout of poverty, we must ensure that, first, there is broad \r\naccess to economic opportunities created by growth, \r\nand that, secondly, individuals are equipped to tap into \r\nthese opportunities. Fostering inclusive growth is a \r\nmajor thrust of Singapore’s growth strategy for the \r\nnext phase of our development. We have traditionally \r\ninvested heavily in education, training and skills \r\nupgrading to enhance the employability of our workers. \r\nBut we recognize that the lower-skilled and less \r\neducated face particular challenges in staying \r\nemployed. To help these individuals improve their \r\neconomic prospects, we need to motivate them to seek \r\nwork and provide them with strong support to upskill \r\nand upgrade over time. For low-income families, we \r\nneed to ensure that their children have full educational \r\nopportunities to help them break out of the cycle of \r\npoverty. \r\n To encourage low-wage workers to seek work \r\nand stay in employment, Singapore introduced the \r\nWorkfare Income Supplement Scheme in 2007. As its \r\nname suggests, the Scheme provides an income \r\nsupplement to low-wage workers to encourage them to \r\nwork regularly and to help them build up their \r\nretirement savings. In this way, the Scheme \r\nA/65/PV.29  \r\n \r\n10-57862 10 \r\n \r\nsupplements the income of low-wage workers while \r\npreserving the work ethic. \r\n To complement the Workfare Income Supplement \r\nScheme, Singapore launched the Workfare Training \r\nSupport Scheme in July this year to help low-wage \r\nworkers upskill and secure better jobs. It takes into \r\naccount the specific challenges faced by low-wage \r\nworkers in attending and completing training. \r\nEmployers are given funding support to encourage \r\nthem to send their low-wage workers for training. To \r\nencourage workers to complete their training, they are \r\ngiven training awards for completing the requisite \r\nskills modules. Low-skilled workers, particularly those \r\nwithout a secondary education, can receive customized \r\ntraining programmes that cover basic literacy and \r\nnumeracy skills as well. All low-skilled workers, \r\nregardless of their employment status, have access to \r\nthese customized training programmes. Community \r\nprogrammes to help low-income workers and families \r\nraise their aspirations form another critical aspect of \r\nour assistance efforts. Low-income families with young \r\nchildren can receive coaching on parenting skills, \r\ncounselling and family support, and assistance in \r\nenrolling their children in kindergarten and childcare. \r\n While poverty eradication is often an issue of \r\ninternal rather than external factors, the task can be \r\ncomplemented by assistance from bilateral, regional \r\nand international partners. Singapore agrees that \r\ndeveloped countries can and should provide strong \r\nsupport to developing countries, particularly the least \r\ndeveloped, to raise their people out of poverty. For \r\ntheir part, developing countries should continue to take \r\nownership of their own development, ensure good \r\ngovernance and view development assistance as a \r\nmeans to support their ultimate goal of self-reliance \r\nand self-sufficiency at both the macro and the \r\nindividual levels. \r\n For Singapore’s part, it provides assistance to its \r\nexternal partners under the Singapore Cooperation \r\nProgramme, which is administered by the Ministry of \r\nForeign Affairs. Just as we believe that low-skilled, \r\nlow-wage workers in Singapore are best helped by \r\nproviding them with the skills to secure good jobs \r\nrather than financial handouts that run out over time, \r\nthe Programme offers technical assistance to \r\ndeveloping countries in building up their competencies \r\nin the areas most relevant and useful to them. Since \r\n1992, the Singapore Cooperation Programme has \r\norganized training programmes for more than 70,000 \r\nparticipants from 169 countries in various areas \r\nincluding economic development, education, \r\nenvironmental management, urban development, health \r\ncare, public administration and governance. To date, \r\nthe Programme’s total commitment has exceeded \r\n400 million Singapore dollars. \r\n Cooperation through regional institutions and \r\ninitiatives — from the sharing of best practices to the \r\ncreation of new economic opportunities through \r\neconomic integration and liberalization — can also \r\nhelp accelerate the progress of efforts to raise people \r\nfrom poverty. The efforts of the Association of \r\nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are a case in point. \r\nASEAN has set itself a target to form an ASEAN \r\neconomic community by 2015. \r\n Towards this end, ASEAN decided last year to \r\npursue an ASEAN connectivity initiative to deepen \r\nphysical, communications, systems and people links \r\namong ASEAN countries. Greater ASEAN connectivity \r\nand the opportunities inherent in the creation of such \r\nnetworks will help to narrow the development divide \r\nbetween ASEAN member countries. ASEAN leaders \r\nhave also pledged ASEAN’s commitment to addressing \r\nsocio-economic disparities and poverty by developing \r\nand implementing an ASEAN road map towards \r\nrealizing the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\nSingapore would like to take this opportunity to \r\nreaffirm its commitment to working with its partners, \r\nboth within and outside ASEAN, to help realize the \r\nMDGs by 2015 and to help eradicate poverty. \r\n Mr. Almeida (Brazil): I wish to thank you, \r\nMr. President, for convening this very important \r\nplenary meeting and to express my delegation’s \r\nappreciation for the quality of the report presented by \r\nthe Secretary-General (A/65/267) for our deliberations \r\nunder agenda item 24 (a).  \r\n The eradication of poverty is not only an ethical \r\nimperative, but a key element of sustainable \r\ndevelopment strategies. In Brazil, social inclusion \r\npolicies are at the heart of our development model, \r\nwhich associates economic growth with social justice \r\nand the distribution of income. They have also greatly \r\ncontributed to mitigating the impact of the financial \r\nand economic crisis and to lay the basis for a quick \r\neconomic recovery.  \r\n In order to make the progress achieved in the \r\nfight against poverty sustainable over time, it is our \r\nfirm belief that multidimensional and integrated \r\n A/65/PV.29\r\n \r\n11 10-57862 \r\n \r\nprogrammes must be carried out by national \r\nGovernments with the constructive engagement of \r\ninternational partners, including the United Nations \r\nsystem, respecting the principles of national ownership \r\nand leadership. \r\n We believe that these policies must ensure the \r\naccess of all to productive resources, opportunities and \r\npublic services, enhance social protection and lessen \r\nvulnerability. Sustained and broad-based economic \r\nprogress, coupled with social inclusion, is essential for \r\nboosting living standards and for eradicating poverty in \r\na sustained manner. In that sense, increased access to \r\nmicrofinance and the provision of microcredit play an \r\nimportant role as effective measures aimed at \r\ngenerating income and self-employment for those \r\nnormally excluded from the financial market. In Latin \r\nAmerica, microfinance has developed into a true \r\nindustry over the past three decades. Microcredit has \r\nbeen associated with conditional cash transfer \r\nprogrammes as an important tool for reducing \r\neconomic and social vulnerability and dependency. \r\n As rightly pointed out by the Secretary-General \r\nin his report, access to credit alone is insufficient for \r\npoverty eradication. Efforts must be made to promote \r\nan inclusive financial system that ensures the provision \r\nof useful, flexible and simple financing mechanisms \r\nfor those who are most in need. The primary means of \r\naccess to the formal financial system is the bank \r\naccount. More often than not, however, people living in \r\npoverty are prevented from opening bank accounts for \r\nlack of sufficient income, assets or information. Those \r\nwho cannot provide financial guarantees have to resort \r\nto informal credit markets and be subject to unfair \r\nrepayment conditions and higher interest rates.  \r\n That is why the Brazilian Government launched \r\nthe Banking Inclusion Programme, which created \r\nsimplified bank accounts for low-income people \r\nwithout bank maintenance fees. Last year, the number \r\nof simplified accounts in Brazil exceeded 10 million. \r\nIn addition, taking advantage of their massive presence \r\nthroughout the country, lottery sale points and post \r\noffices were authorized to provide banking services \r\nthat are used mainly by low-income people.  \r\n The role of microcredit in promoting gender \r\nequality and economically empowering women has \r\nalso been highlighted in a number of United Nations \r\ndocuments, such as this year’s Ministerial Declaration \r\nof the Economic and Social Council and resolution \r\n54/4 of the Commission on the Status of Women. \r\nToday, more than 70 per cent of all microcredit clients \r\nthroughout the world are women. Following global \r\ntrends, women are the main microcredit clients in \r\nBrazil, and the participation of women as microfinance \r\nborrowers tends to grow in lower-income households. \r\nThus, the role of women as entrepreneurs and in \r\nalleviating poverty becomes even more evident. \r\n The recent crisis has highlighted the need to \r\npromote both poverty eradication policies and the \r\nresponsible management of finances. Microcredit and \r\nmicrofinance, given their direct relation to production \r\nand entrepreneurship, respond to these two key \r\ndemands. The United Nations system can play a key \r\nrole in mobilizing resources and in providing technical \r\nsupport to developing countries in the creation and \r\nexpansion of national microcredit programmes. A \r\nstrengthened and well-funded United Nations Capital \r\nDevelopment Fund (UNCDF) should take the lead in \r\nprojects targeted at providing investment capital, \r\ncapacity-building and technical advisory services in \r\norder to make available microfinance and foster local \r\ndevelopment. \r\n The challenges related to poverty eradication may \r\nbe many, but effective and successful stories can be \r\nfound in developing countries themselves. The United \r\nNations system, especially the UNCDF, should benefit \r\nfrom these experiences and promote their replication in \r\nother countries implementing their own microcredit \r\nprogrammes. \r\n Mr. Gutiérrez (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): Peru \r\nrecognizes microcredit and microfinancing as useful \r\ntools in the fight to eradicate poverty. Peru also \r\nrecognizes their capacity to improve the living \r\nconditions of populations, especially those who, \r\nlacking access to basic financial services, can use \r\nmicrocredit to generate opportunities for self-reliance \r\nfor their own benefit and that of their communities. \r\n Peru has been very successfully implementing a \r\ncomprehensive development programme based on an \r\neconomic policy with the clear objective of generating \r\ngrowth and employment, maximizing the country’s \r\ngreat potential and advancing social policy to \r\nconsolidate poverty reduction and social inclusion with \r\nequal opportunities. Within this policy, the \r\nfundamental philosophy of microcredit and \r\nmicrofinance to promote the responsible development \r\nof the community by giving high priority to social \r\nA/65/PV.29  \r\n \r\n10-57862 12 \r\n \r\nimpact and protection, has an appropriate framework in \r\nPeru thanks to an environment of economic and \r\nfinancial legislation that favours it.  \r\n For example, in Peru in recent years the \r\nmicrofinance system has contributed significantly to \r\nimproving access to the use of banking services and to \r\ndecentralizing financial services, with a strong \r\npresence in geographic areas and market segments that \r\nare not usually covered by the financial system. Thus, \r\nthe participation of these sectors in the financial \r\nsystem has grown, with high participation in \r\ninvestment and deposits, and covers more than 20 per \r\ncent of debtors and almost 15 per cent of depositors of \r\nthe financial system in general. Banks working in this \r\narea have increased the number of branches and \r\ncustomers, who now number more than half a million \r\npeople, by specializing in the sector of micro- and \r\nsmall companies. Loans to poor segments of the \r\npopulation are one fourth of all credits at the national \r\nlevel, with a high repayment rate of almost 95 per cent.  \r\n Peru believes that there is a relationship between \r\nthe strategies to reduce such scourges as climate \r\nchange, for example, and poverty eradication. For this \r\nreason, public policies should and must be established \r\nto fight both at the same time in a simultaneous and \r\ninterdependent fashion. In that respect, Peru endorses \r\nthe reference in the Secretary-General’s report on the \r\nrole of microcredit and microfinance in the eradication \r\nof poverty (A/65/267) to the opportunities to promote \r\nthe access of microfinance clients to clean energy \r\nsources. The report stresses that the majority of energy \r\nconsumed by microfinance clients is, inter alia, for \r\nhome cooking in poor areas.  \r\n As the President of Peru recently indicated in the \r\ncurrent general debate,  \r\n “Hundreds of millions of households in the world \r\ncontinue to use wood-burning stoves, thus driving \r\ndeforestation and at the same time polluting the \r\nenvironment and causing serious \r\nbronchiopulmonary and nutritional problems \r\namong children. We propose to reduce the \r\nnumber of wood-burning stoves in Peru by 20 per \r\ncent by 2021 and to replace them with better \r\nstoves” (A/65/PV.11). \r\n We believe that microfinancing institutions can \r\nplay a major role in implementing this objective. I \r\nshould indicate that Peru has acquired considerable \r\nexperience in developing this initiative, which we will \r\nshare with countries that request it. We also believe \r\nthat, given the positive and direct impact of improved \r\nstoves on health and environmental preservation, the \r\npromotion of their use in poor and extremely poor \r\nsectors of the population should be included in \r\ndevelopment programmes of the United Nations. \r\n While we recognize the usefulness of microcredit \r\nand microfinance with respect to the effects of the \r\nfinancial crisis, we believe that the principles of \r\nsustainability and social responsibility that they \r\npromote can and should be applied at the national and \r\ninternational macroeconomic levels, without losing \r\nsight of the fact that one of the fundamental missions \r\nof Governments should be to increase the scope of \r\nfinancial services, especially towards the most needy \r\nsectors. \r\n Our country recently had the privilege of \r\nreceiving a visit from one of the world’s microcredit \r\npioneers, Mr. Muhammad Yunus, Nobel Peace Prize \r\nlaureate and founder of the Grameen Bank in \r\nBangladesh. The Peruvian Government gave him the \r\nhighest national award because of his experience, work \r\nand ongoing commitment to the comprehensive and \r\ndignified development of those who have the least in \r\nthis world. Together with him, we can say that the main \r\npurpose of a social enterprise is not to profit but to \r\nresolve the problems of its immediate environment for \r\nthe common good. We believe that it is in this spirit \r\nthat our Governments must continue to strive to make \r\ngreater and better use of these important tools. \r\n Mr. Momen (Bangladesh): Allow me to begin by \r\ndeclaring our alignment with the statements of Yemen \r\nand Nepal on behalf of the Group of 77 and China and \r\nthe least developed countries, respectively.  \r\n The follow-up to the International Year of \r\nMicrocredit provides us with a unique opportunity for \r\nawareness-building, knowledge-sharing, and \r\nshowcasing best practices and lessons learned in \r\nmicrocredit and microfinancing. It is a fact that the \r\nglobal financial and economic crisis, accompanied by a \r\nsharp increase in food and fuel prices and climate \r\nvulnerabilities, has put us into difficulties. It is \r\nunfortunate that more than 1 billion people were \r\npushed under the poverty line in 2009 alone. According \r\nto the International Labour Organization, more than \r\n30 million people will have lost their jobs by the end of \r\nthis year. More importantly, income inequality between \r\n A/65/PV.29\r\n \r\n13 10-57862 \r\n \r\nrich and poor is rising rapidly, and the global economy \r\nappears to be skewed against the weak.  \r\n The global financial meltdown has become an \r\nexcuse for a few developed countries to tilt towards \r\nprotectionist sentiments and is impeding trade and \r\nexports from developing and least developed countries, \r\nforcing many into joblessness. Given the current trend \r\nin the external environment, it is projected that the \r\nnumber of poor will further increase.  \r\n However, it is dismal to note that many \r\ndeveloping countries, particularly the least developed \r\ncountries, do not have the means to confront the \r\nburgeoning menace of poverty. We know that progress \r\ndoes not come only through foreign aid and assistance. \r\nRather, the engines of growth are innovation, \r\ncompetition, competitiveness, participation and \r\nmotivation. These can be developed through imparting \r\neducation, providing technology and, more importantly, \r\nproviding access to capital and hope for a decent living. \r\nTherefore, Bangladesh has practised the concept of \r\nmicrocredit and easy access to small-scale financing, \r\nand given hope and confidence to a large section of \r\nwomen who have become the engines of growth and \r\nsocial change in Bangladesh. Once they became \r\neconomically active, both the birth and child mortality \r\nrates went down. \r\n Necessity is the mother of invention, and since \r\nBangladesh faced many difficulties, it practised \r\nmicrocredit financing widely. Instead of the traditional \r\ncollateral that is essential for receiving credit, peer \r\npressure and mutual guarantees for loan users, known \r\nas social collateral, are used as a risk management \r\ntechnique for such loans. They are the distinguishing \r\nelement of microcredit.  \r\n During the Great Depression of the 1930s, \r\nmicrofinancing was practised in the United States of \r\nAmerica, mostly by churches. Later on it flourished, \r\nespecially in Colombia, where the first microcredit \r\nbank was established in 1962. In Bengal, microcredit \r\nwas widely practised, mostly by savings associations \r\nand charitable organizations, but hardly any of those \r\nsurvived in the long term as they were not \r\ninstitutionalized.  \r\n After Bangladesh achieved independence in 1971, \r\nthe Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee \r\n(BRAC), a non-governmental organization (NGO) of \r\nBangladesh, started microcredit financing in rural areas, \r\nbut its coverage was low. However, in 1983 the first \r\nmicrocredit bank, known as the Grameen Bank, was \r\nestablished in Bangladesh. While the total number of \r\nborrowers of the Colombian microcredit bank was \r\nfewer than 600,000, there were more than 30 million in \r\nBangladesh — 50 times more — and Grameen’s newer \r\nmethodology guaranteed nearly 99 per cent repayment \r\nof loans. In Bangladesh, thousands of NGOs — \r\nespecially Grameen Bank, BRAC, the Association for \r\nSocial and Health Advancement, Proshika, the \r\nTelephone Shilpa Sangstha and BURO Bangladesh — \r\nhave been involved in microcredit financing, and the \r\nPalli Karma-Sahayak Foundation, an autonomous \r\nGovernment agency, has been providing money to \r\nNGOs for microcredit lending.  \r\n When all is said and done, it is the Grameen Bank \r\nand its founder, Nobel laureate Professor Muhammad \r\nYunus, who have steadfastly popularized microcredit \r\nfinancing throughout the globe. It offers an alternative \r\nmodel based on the neoliberal tenets of individualism \r\nand the free market. Bangladesh has championed \r\nmicrocredit as a free-market development tool that \r\nempowers the poor by encouraging and enabling them \r\nto participate in and grow their own economies. The \r\nconcept of microcredit has remained the most widely \r\nreplicated credit-lending programme in the world, in \r\nspite of its high lending rates. Microcredit has helped \r\nto persuade the world that the poor are innately capable \r\nof working their way out of the morass of poverty with \r\ndignity, and that they have the creativity and capacity \r\nto improve their own situation.  \r\n The contribution of microfinance to asset creation, \r\nemployment generation, the provision of economic \r\nsecurity and the empowerment of the poor, particularly \r\nwomen, is widely acknowledged and considered to be a \r\ngood instrument for poverty alleviation. However, \r\ngraduation from poverty to a higher income-generation \r\nlevel through microcredit is yet to be proved very \r\nsuccessful. The problem is that, although 30 million \r\npeople of Bangladesh are covered by microcredit \r\nfinancing, the poverty level is still at 32 per cent. It is \r\nno wonder that at times microcredit becomes a debt \r\ntrap without adequate safeguards. \r\n Poverty reduction has been the most challenging \r\ntask before the global leadership. With more than \r\n1 billion people living on less than $1 a day, in spite of \r\nits weaknesses microcredit could be a powerful tool for \r\nattaining millennium targets, particularly that of \r\nhalving extreme poverty by 2015. The poorest can \r\nbenefit from microfinance in terms of increased \r\nA/65/PV.29  \r\n \r\n10-57862 14 \r\n \r\nincomes, primary health care, basic education and \r\nreduced vulnerability to natural disasters, provided its \r\nweaknesses can be reduced.  \r\n It is critically important that the poor get access \r\nto all factors of production, including credit. The case \r\nfor microfinance as a mechanism for poverty reduction \r\nis simple. If access to credit can be improved, the poor \r\ncan finance productive activities that will accelerate \r\nincome growth and other economic activities. \r\nMicrocredit has proven its potential to be the most \r\ncost-effective development tool. It has helped to \r\nconvince the world that people living in poverty are \r\ninnately capable of working their way out of it with \r\ndignity and that they have the skills and creativity to \r\nimprove their lives, provided they have the opportunity. \r\nThis is an innovative contribution that Bangladesh \r\npopularized in development thinking.  \r\n Microcredit has revolutionized rural people’s \r\nattitudes towards women. It has proven to be one of the \r\nmost successful measures for involving women in \r\neconomic activities. Statistics suggest that \r\nmicrofinance clients are overwhelmingly women. Their \r\nnumber has now reached 90 per cent of total borrowers. \r\nThe philosophy of providing microcredit to women is \r\nthat, in order to rise out of poverty, a woman needs all \r\nkinds of inputs and support services and structures. In \r\nour country, women default on loans far less often than \r\nmen, and credit extended to women has a much greater \r\nimpact on household consumption and the quality of \r\nlife of children. \r\n Mrs. Rubiales de Chamorro (Nicaragua), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair. \r\n The issue of microcredit has been factored into \r\nour Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers. A set of \r\nrecommendations have been put forward to make it \r\nmore effective in poverty reduction. It must have \r\nspecific targets and product designs to achieve a \r\npositive impact on the ultrapoor. Innovative approaches \r\nshould be introduced with respect to bringing changes \r\nto credit delivery mechanisms, diversifying financial \r\nservices and complementing microfinance with \r\nnon-financial interventions. Microcredit is also seen as \r\none of those instruments that, by stabilizing conflict-\r\nridden societies, would help drain the marshes that \r\nproduce thoughts and acts of terrorism.  \r\n As we become increasingly engaged in \r\npeacekeeping responsibilities in strife-torn parts of the \r\nworld, microcredit can play a significant role in \r\nsustaining peace by creating jobs. The General \r\nAssembly, the Security Council and the international \r\nfinancial institutions have all acknowledged the \r\nefficacy of microfinance as an effective anti-poverty \r\ntool. As is evident from the news from the field from \r\nall parts of the world, it works, if of course the right \r\nwherewithal is provided. We now need to provide that. \r\nIt must include the necessary legal, financial and social \r\nframework if microfinance or microcredit is to work \r\neffectively. \r\n Over the past two decades, microfinance \r\nprogrammes have rapidly spread worldwide. The State \r\nof the Microcredit Summit Campaign Report 2006 \r\nfound a nearly sevenfold increase in the number of \r\nclients with loans. Rising from 13.5 million clients in \r\n1997, credit reached 113 million in 2005; 82 million of \r\nthese are poor and living on less than $1 a day.  \r\n Credit may be the primary requirement of the \r\npoorest of the poor, but credit alone is not sufficient to \r\nalter their fate. Finance must be accompanied by \r\nentrepreneurial training. This product should be \r\npackaged with a basic knowledge of hygiene, health, \r\nsocial rights and responsibilities, and education to \r\nmaximize its benefits. If done right, microfinance can \r\nunleash the huge potential of the poor and bring about \r\na sea-change in their lives, lifting them out of the \r\npoverty trap. \r\n Poverty anywhere is poverty all over. Hence, \r\neliminating poverty and attaining prosperity is a \r\ntreasured dream and a revered duty for all of us. It is \r\nthe boundless pursuit of justice, equality and fairness. \r\nLet us fight for a world that is free from hunger, want \r\nand deprivation. Together, we can banish extreme \r\npoverty in our own generation. Let me echo the call of \r\nMuhammad Yunus of Grameen Bank: “Let us put \r\npoverty in a museum”. I look forward to a new impetus \r\nin the development process resulting from this year’s \r\ndiscussions, debates and resolutions of the United \r\nNations.  \r\n Mr. Kim Chang Mo (Republic of Korea): The \r\nmicrofinance movement has quietly changed the world \r\never since the first microloans were introduced in the \r\ndeveloping world in the 1970s. The international \r\ncommunity held a microcredit summit in 1997. Later, \r\nthe United Nations declared 2005 as the International \r\nYear of Microcredit. In 2006, Muhammad Yunus and \r\nGrameen Bank received the Nobel Peace Prize for their \r\ncontributions.  \r\n A/65/PV.29\r\n \r\n15 10-57862 \r\n \r\n Now, more than $25 billion are currently at work \r\nin microfinance loans. During the past four decades, \r\nmicroloans have proven the strong potential of tiny \r\ninnovative measures to change the lives of the poor. In \r\nthose years, the characteristics and trends of \r\nmicroloans have changed, and we are realizing that \r\nthey are not a cure-all in eradicating poverty. The \r\nreality of microcredit and microfinance is very \r\ncomplex. In this regard, we appreciate the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s useful report (A/65/267), which identifies the \r\nachievements and limits of microcredit and \r\nmicrofinance as a poverty-eradication strategy.  \r\n Taking this opportunity, the Republic of Korea \r\nwould like to highlight the following points that we \r\nthink are important in terms of policy guidance. First, \r\nwe think that microloans have other effects, such as \r\nsocial protection and social inclusion, but that they \r\nshould first be seen as a tool for economic growth and \r\ndevelopment strategy. Three weeks ago, our leaders \r\nproclaimed that promoting sustained, inclusive and \r\nequitable economic growth is necessary for \r\naccelerating progress towards achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. This means that the \r\neconomic growth we harness must be pro-poor, \r\ninclusive and equitable, and allow all people, \r\nespecially the poor, to participate in the process and \r\nequitably enjoy its benefits. We believe that \r\nmicrofinance is one of the most important tools in \r\nensuring that the poor can participate in and share the \r\noutcome of economic growth. \r\n Secondly, despite the first point, we believe that \r\nthe impact of microfinance should not be \r\noverestimated. As studies show, microfinance usually \r\ndoes not have much impact on the poorest, who do not \r\nhave the ability to repay the loans, and that it \r\nsometimes ends up adding to their debt burden. \r\nMicrofinance benefits those with existing businesses \r\nand who are a little wealthier than the poorest. \r\nTherefore, we need carefully to develop a national \r\ndevelopment strategy based on a deep understanding of \r\nwhere microfinance is useful and where grants are \r\nmost needed. \r\n Thirdly, as the report points out, even though \r\nstrengthening the transparency of microfinance \r\ninstitutions and improving the regulatory framework \r\nare important, the framework should not hamper the \r\ninnovative nature of microfinance, but allow diverse \r\ninstitutions and bank agents to deliver varied and \r\nflexible financial services. In this regard, we again \r\nhave to emphasize that it is the primary responsibility \r\nof each Government to keep the delicate balance and \r\nproportionality between expanding access to financial \r\nservices and ensuring safety. \r\n Finally, we would like to add that the Group of 20 \r\n(G-20) has launched two sub-groups of the Financial \r\nInclusion Expert Group: one on access through \r\ninnovation and the other on financing for small- and \r\nmedium-sized enterprises. The Expert Group is also \r\ndeveloping an action agenda to be issued during the \r\nupcoming G-20 Seoul Summit. The Republic of Korea \r\nrecognizes that financial inclusion is a core issue, and \r\nwe will contribute to the discussion, especially in order \r\nto come up with effective measures for enhanced \r\ncapital flow for small- and medium-sized enterprises. \r\nWe hope that that effort will also be a sound basis for \r\nthe United Nations and other forums to promote \r\nfinancial inclusion, including microcredit and \r\nmicrofinance, and contribute to poverty eradication. \r\n Mr. Habib (Lebanon): My delegation thanks the \r\nPresident for organizing this timely meeting, allowing \r\nthe international community to take stock of national, \r\nregional and international initiatives to promote \r\nmicrocredit and microfinance. If somebody received a \r\n$1,000 loan, what would they do with it? It may not \r\nseem like a great deal of money but, for hundreds of \r\nmillions of people throughout the world, it represents \r\nseveral times their annual income. For Rabiaa Al Wass, \r\na Lebanese businesswoman from the Bekaa Valley, \r\n$1,000 enabled her to open a clothing store rather than \r\nsell door-to-door. For Zaki Bou Farhat, a farmer from \r\nSouth Lebanon, $1,000 helped him obtain a herd of \r\n12 cows and produce organic dairy products for \r\ncommercial use. Those are examples of microcredit \r\nloans. \r\n In Lebanon, microcredit loans have been \r\navailable since 1990. An estimated 30,000 Lebanese \r\ncitizens, like Ms. Al Wass and Mr. Bou Farhat, have \r\nbenefited from such services. In 2004 the Central Bank \r\nof Lebanon launched an initiative to encourage banks \r\nto use up to 5 per cent of their loan reserves to extend \r\nsmall loans in Lebanese pounds. The figures and \r\nvarious initiatives demonstrated the need for a \r\nmultifaceted approach, a comprehensive strategy, and a \r\nnational lead initiative to identify priorities and ensure \r\nsocial and economic viability. Such actions need to be \r\ncomplemented by a regionally and internationally \r\nconducive environment. \r\nA/65/PV.29  \r\n \r\n10-57862 16 \r\n \r\n In that context, my delegation would like to focus \r\non the following areas: first, increasing awareness of \r\nmicrocredit and microfinance. The year 2005, declared \r\nas the International Year of Microcredit, marked the \r\nglobal recognition of microcredit as an enabler of \r\neconomic and social development. There is no doubt \r\nthat the International Year created considerable \r\nmomentum. A year later, the Nobel Peace Prize was \r\nawarded to the father of microcredit, Professor \r\nMuhammad Yunus from Bangladesh, and to Grameen \r\nBank. Just a few weeks ago the outcome document of \r\nthe High-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals called for: \r\n “Expanding access to financial services for the poor, \r\nespecially poor women, including through \r\nadequately funded microfinance plans, programmes \r\nand initiatives supported by development partners” \r\n(resolution 65/1, para. 23). \r\nThis is seen as a way to accelerate progress. The \r\noutcome document is also evidence of increased public \r\nawareness and understanding of microfinance and \r\nmicrocredit as vital parts of the development equation.  \r\n Secondly, with regard to promoting strategic \r\npartnerships and inclusive financial sectors with \r\nsustainable access, we cite the Blue Book project \r\nentitled “Building Inclusive Financial Sectors for \r\nDevelopment” as an example of new partnerships, \r\nbringing together the United Nations and a multilateral \r\nagency group representing the World Bank, the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund, the International Fund \r\nfor Agricultural Development and the International \r\nLabour Organization. Additionally, in 2009, the \r\nConsultative Group to Assist the Poor began an effort \r\nto measure financial inclusion in an annual publication \r\nentitled “Financial Access”. The 2010 report shows an \r\nincrease in the number of deposits per 1,000 adults and \r\nreflects increased access to financial services. Also, in \r\n88 per cent of the economies surveyed, financial \r\nregulators were responsible for at least one element of \r\nfinancial inclusion, which includes consumer \r\nprotection, financial literacy, microfinance regulation \r\nand savings, as well as small- and medium-sized \r\nenterprise and rural finance promotion. Indeed, in an \r\naddress to the Second Committee last week, Professor \r\nRobert Shiller of Yale University spoke of the \r\ndemocratization of finance, manifested by a surge in \r\nmicrocredit and other instruments such as weather \r\ninsurance for smallholder farmers. \r\n Thirdly, with regard to alleviating the impact of \r\nthe economic and financial crisis, it is certain that the \r\nongoing economic and financial crisis has affected \r\nmicrocredit and financial inclusion. The 2010 Financial \r\nAccess report notes a decrease in financial outreach \r\nowing to the closing of bank branches as a result of the \r\ncrisis. We therefore call on donors to continue their \r\ncontributions, so as to ensure the sustainability and \r\npredictability of funds in order to help eradicate \r\npoverty, increase social inclusiveness and ultimately \r\nempower poor and marginalized people. \r\n Fourthly, with regard to ensuring peace, security \r\nand stability, we can say that microcredit and \r\nmicrofinance, like other investments, are more likely to \r\nprosper in a peaceful, secure and stable environment. \r\nIn that context, my delegation notes that in countries \r\naffected by armed conflict, other non-economic \r\nexternal factors may also hinder progress. For example, \r\nin 2006, during the war waged by Israel against \r\nLebanon, Ms. Al Wass’ store was severely damaged \r\nand could not be reopened. Mr. Farhat’s entire herd \r\nwas killed by a bomb and his home was partly \r\ndemolished. Had the war not occurred, imagine how \r\nthe $1,000 investment in each case would have \r\nreinforced entrepreneurship and expanded self-\r\nemployment. Imagine that any additional loans would \r\nhave generated even greater development, creating a \r\nsocial safety net, not only for those individuals but also \r\nfor all their families. \r\n Microcredit has proven effective in improving \r\nlivelihoods “by easing the management of expenses \r\nand preventing further hardship” (A/65/267, para. 28), \r\nas stated by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in his \r\nreport. The challenges facing microcredit are enormous. \r\nWe thus must show equal determination in ensuring \r\nthat more and more of the world’s poorest families, \r\nespecially the women of those families, are receiving \r\ncredit for self-employment and other financial and \r\nbusiness services. We also echo the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s call that efforts to promote microcredit and \r\nfinancial inclusion must be complemented with \r\ninterventions that further address aspects of poverty, \r\nsuch as investments in health and skills training. \r\n Mr. Loulichki (Morocco) (spoke in French): My \r\ndelegation is pleased to take part in this debate on \r\npromoting sustainable development and eliminating \r\npoverty, issues to which my country, with the King at \r\nits head, accord strategic importance and priority. I \r\nshould also like to take this opportunity to hail the \r\ncommitment of the Secretary-General, who took an \r\nactive part in the success of the high-level meetings on \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, biodiversity and \r\non the Mauritius Strategy for the Further \r\n A/65/PV.29\r\n \r\n17 10-57862 \r\n \r\nImplementation of the Programme of Action for the \r\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing \r\nStates. Today, we are meeting at a crossroads that \r\ncomes on the eve on the holding of two conferences in \r\nNagoya and Cancún.  \r\n The new orientations in development adopted by \r\nmy country are reflected, first of all, in the national \r\nstrategy for protecting the environment and sustainable \r\ndevelopment, in the implementation of the National \r\nPlan of Action on the environment, in the 2020 Rural \r\nDevelopment Strategy and the launching of the human \r\ndevelopment initiative. The 2020 Rural Development \r\nStrategy is a specific pillar in the country’s overall \r\ndevelopment. Its implementation is based on the \r\nconvergence of policies that can provide suitable \r\nresponses to the many social problems faced in rural \r\nareas. The Strategy has as its central goal creating the \r\nmost favourable conditions so that rural populations \r\ncan accede to a dynamic process that will enable us to \r\nremedy imbalances.  \r\n The Moroccan Government’s action when it \r\ncomes to combating poverty is based on two pillars: \r\nfirst, the deployment of basic infrastructure throughout \r\nthe country; and secondly, the adoption of a targeted \r\napproach to combating poverty, based on specific \r\nresults. The initiatives undertaken have allowed us to \r\nreduce poverty, which has moved from 19 per cent in \r\n1998 to 11 per cent in 2006, a fall of almost 50 per cent. \r\nA number of national initiatives have been launched as \r\npart of this and are reflected in the establishment of a \r\nsocial development agency and implementation of a \r\nnational initiative for human development. \r\n This initiative, inspired and launched in 2005 by \r\nthe King, is an innovative approach to combating \r\npoverty and developing marginalized areas. The four \r\nbenchmarks of this initiative are as follows: \r\nguaranteeing decent living conditions for the most \r\nvulnerable; building a social project to promote global \r\ncoherent and comprehensive development; mitigating \r\nthe negative impact of poverty; and taking advantage \r\nof foreign experience in terms of combating poverty \r\nand exclusion. This initiative seeks to reduce poverty \r\nand social exclusion through actions of support \r\ndedicated to income-generating activities, capacity \r\ndevelopment, and improving conditions of access to \r\nbasic infrastructure and services. A meeting to take \r\nstock of the progress achieved through this initiative \r\nwill be held in the days to come with the participation \r\nof international and national experts to assess the \r\nimpact of this initiative on poverty reduction and also \r\nto exchange good practices. \r\n To effectively combat poverty my country has \r\nsteadfastly strengthened its national financial \r\ninstitutions and improved conditions for access to \r\nfinancing. Here, as part of the process of creating small \r\nand medium enterprises, microcredit for the poor \r\npopulation has been launched. Microcredit, a recent \r\nfinancial mechanism, meets the urgent needs of the \r\npoor population to accede to financial resources. The \r\nnumber of microcredit loans granted to the poorest of \r\nthe population in Morocco in the last few years has \r\nreached a value of €29 million, a rise of more than \r\n81 per cent compared to previous years. The creation \r\nby the Moroccan Government of a consultative council \r\nof microcredit is proof that the establishment of a legal \r\nframework for promoting microcredit shows a will to \r\npersevere in combating social exclusion. In Morocco, \r\nmicroenterprises allow 60 per cent of the active \r\npopulation, or 6 million people, to receive jobs. This \r\nmicroactivity, which is a response to informal banking \r\nmodalities, is suitable for a large network of small \r\nenterprises. I must stress here, and echo the statement \r\nmade by my colleague, the Ambassador of Bangladesh, \r\nthat the status of women who benefit from microcredit \r\nis growing, as has been shown — and I think this must \r\nbe credited to the perseverance of women — by the \r\nfact that women have achieved much better results \r\nwhen they receive microcredit loans. \r\n The multiple threats facing our world \r\nenvironment have had serious repercussions on the \r\ngrowth of poverty, significantly hampering the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals. A \r\nclose correlation exists between poverty and the \r\npromotion of sustainable development. The declaration \r\nadopted at the end of the High-level Plenary Meeting \r\non the Millennium Development Goals at the start of \r\nthe current session was an important step in assessing \r\nthe opportunities and obstacles for the attainment by all \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals. A short-term \r\nfollow-up will undoubtedly consolidate the process of \r\nachieving those goals. In that context, it is important to \r\nenvisage a review and evaluation on a yearly basis of \r\nthese goals. \r\n Mr. Zinsou (Benin) (spoke in French): Allow me \r\nto say how pleased I am to be able to take the floor \r\ntoday on behalf of my country, the Republic of Benin, \r\non the occasion of the current plenary meeting devoted \r\nto outcome of and follow-up to the International Year \r\nof Microcredit. I should also like to take this \r\nopportunity to compliment the United Nations \r\nSecretary-General on his comprehensive report and, \r\nabove all, for the relevant analysis and the \r\nA/65/PV.29  \r\n \r\n10-57862 18 \r\n \r\nrecommendations contained therein, which are very \r\nmuch in step with resolution 53/197, whereby the \r\nGeneral Assembly declared the year 2005 the \r\nInternational Year of Microcredit. \r\n Anxious to combat all aspects of poverty and \r\nsocial exclusion, which affect the majority of the Benin \r\npopulation, particularly in rural areas, the current \r\nGovernment of my country has, since coming to power, \r\nadopted a plan and strategy, the main pillars of which \r\nare as follows: consolidating the macroeconomic \r\nframework; developing human capital and \r\nenvironmental management; enhancing governance and \r\ninstitutional capacities; and promoting sustainable jobs \r\nand enhancing the capacities of poor people to take \r\npart in the decision-making and production processes \r\nthrough better access to microcredit. Microcredit seeks, \r\nabove all, to enable the majority of the poorest people \r\nand those bereft of financial resources to engage in \r\nincome-generating activities. Such loans have proven \r\ntheir worth in a number of Asian countries as an \r\neffective way of awakening the dormant capacities of \r\nhuman capital and have in many cases led to \r\nspectacular gains in record time in terms of gains in \r\nincome per capita. \r\n On 27 February 2007, the Benin Government, \r\ninspired by this commendable performance, launched a \r\nmajor initiative called the Microcredit Programme for \r\nthe Poorest, to the tune of 10 billion CFA francs or \r\n$20 million and appointed a young woman with \r\nexceptional qualities to the post of Minister of \r\nMicrofinance to manage the Programme. This Ministry \r\nis supported in implementing this programme by \r\npartners such as the Regional Solidarity Bank, \r\ncommunity associations and non-governmental \r\norganizations. Since then, the Microcredit Programme \r\nfor the Poorest has empowered close to 600,000 people, \r\nthe majority of whom are urban and rural women. The \r\nmomentum generated by the Government’s initiative \r\nand its impact on improving the living conditions of \r\nthe poorest, particularly of women, has led the State to \r\npursue its efforts of financing and oversight. The \r\nProgramme, which is expanding, has thus far received \r\na mobilization of funds of close to 32 billion CFA \r\nfrancs or close to $64 million, and people keep coming \r\nback for more. Innovations focusing on illiteracy, \r\nmicroinsurance and mutual health insurance have also \r\nbeen introduced into the Programme, as has biometric \r\ntechnology, the goal of which is to promote  \r\nprofessionalism and the security of funds. Our \r\nGovernment, whose short-term goal is to extend the \r\nProgramme to at least 1 million people, is \r\nendeavouring to marshal more resources for it in the \r\ncurrent context, which is marked by the repercussions \r\nof the international economic and financial crisis, \r\nwhich has seriously affected the country’s economy. \r\nThat is one of the concerns that should be addressed \r\nduring our current debate, namely, how to help \r\ncountries that have enjoyed success in developing \r\nmicrocredit to acquire funds at favourable rates that \r\nwould enable the granting of credit to people who need \r\nit most. \r\n In the light of its experience, Benin calls on the \r\ninternational community to support the approaches \r\nadopted by the developing countries with regard to \r\nmonitoring administrators and recipients of microcredit, \r\nabove all in the drafting of effective regulations \r\ngoverning this promising, albeit very vulnerable, sector \r\nwith its close links to informal networks. The \r\ndisparities and irregularities recently detected in a \r\nnumber of African countries, which have had a \r\ndamaging impact on the people concerned, including in \r\nBenin, undoubtedly demonstrate the rationality of the \r\nrecommendations made by the Secretary-General on \r\nthat subject in his report. We cannot deny the need to \r\nadopt and implement appropriate regulations as part of \r\na global approach aimed at increasing the supply of \r\nfinancial services available to people living in poverty, \r\nat strengthening the coordination of financial policy, \r\nand at responding to the complexity of the problems \r\nraised by this type of financial product. \r\n As Benin stressed a few days ago in the Sixth \r\nCommittee, we can only welcome the inclusion on the \r\nagenda of the United Nations Commission on \r\nInternational Trade Law of the issue of the \r\nharmonization of microfinance legislation. The studies \r\nto which the work of the Commission will lead will \r\nallow us to better define the contours of microfinance, \r\nwhich is an important instrument for promoting \r\ndevelopment and to maximize its impact and \r\ncontribution to the promotion of sustainable human \r\ndevelopment in all countries. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nGeneral Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of sub-item (a) of agenda item 24. \r\n The meeting rose at 12.05 p.m. \r\n"
