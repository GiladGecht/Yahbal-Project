(Switzerland) \r\n \r\n \r\n The meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 7 \r\n \r\nOrganization of work, adoption of the agenda and \r\nallocation of items \r\n \r\n  Second report of the General Committee \r\n(A/65/250/Add.1) \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): The General \r\nCommittee decided to recommend to the General \r\nAssembly that an additional item entitled “Follow-up \r\nto the high-level meeting held on 24 September 2010; \r\nrevitalizing the work of the Conference on \r\nDisarmament and taking forward multilateral \r\ndisarmament negotiations” be included in the agenda \r\nof the current session under heading G (Disarmament). \r\n May I take it that the General Assembly decides \r\nto include this item in the agenda of the current session \r\nunder heading G? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in French): The General \r\nCommittee further decided to recommend that the item \r\nbe allocated to the plenary and to the First Committee, \r\non the understanding that, in the plenary, the Assembly \r\nwould hold the debate on the item and the First \r\nCommittee would consider any proposals on the item. \r\n May I take it that the General Assembly decides to \r\nallocate this item to the plenary and to the First \r\nCommittee, on the understanding that, in the plenary, the \r\nAssembly will hold the debate on the item and the First \r\nCommittee will consider any proposals on the item? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The President (spoke in French): The item \r\nentitled “Follow-up to the high-level meeting held on \r\n24 September 2010; revitalizing the work of the \r\nConference on Disarmament and taking forward \r\nmultilateral disarmament negotiations” becomes item \r\n162 on the agenda of the current session. \r\n The Chairman of the First Committee will be \r\ninformed of the decision just taken by the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n The General Assembly has thus concluded its \r\nconsideration of the second report of the General \r\nCommittee. \r\n \r\nAgenda items 62 and 12 \r\n \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development: progress \r\nin implementation and international support \r\n \r\n (a) New Partnership for Africa’s Development: \r\nprogress in implementation and  \r\ninternational support \r\n \r\n  Reports of the Secretary-General (A/65/165 and \r\nA/65/167) and notes by the Secretary-General \r\n(A/65/62 and Add.1) \r\n \r\n (b) Causes of conflict and the promotion of durable \r\npeace and sustainable development in Africa \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/65/152) \r\n \r\nA/65/PV.30  \r\n \r\n10-58121 2 \r\n \r\n2001-2010: Decade to Roll Back Malaria in \r\nDeveloping Countries, Particularly in Africa \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/65/210) \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): Our debate \r\ntoday will be devoted to several topics of importance to \r\nAfrica. I believe that this is particularly opportune. I \r\nhope that our discussion, along with the excellent \r\nreports prepared by the Secretariat, will form part of \r\nthe follow-up to the summit on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. It is essential that throughout the \r\nsixty-fifth session our discussions should reflect the \r\nimportance of these themes, in order to maintain the \r\npolitical momentum for the achievement of the Goals \r\nthat was generated at the summit. Today we have a \r\ngood opportunity to do this. \r\n Achieving the goals of the Global Malaria Action \r\nPlan has an impact on almost all the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. The issue is critical: every year, \r\nnearly a million people fall victim to malaria, mainly in \r\nAfrica, and this is simply unacceptable. It is therefore \r\nimportant to support the efforts of the Roll Back \r\nMalaria Partnership and of the Global Fund to Fight \r\nAIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which provide good \r\nexamples of partnership and coordination between the \r\nvarious bodies and institutions of the public and private \r\nsectors which are active in this field. \r\n With regard to the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment, established in 2001, the report of the \r\nSecretary-General on its implementation offers a \r\nnumber of positive elements: progress has been made, \r\noverall, in implementing the Partnership, and the \r\nestablishment of a new planning and coordination \r\nmechanism should lead to increased managerial \r\nefficiency. \r\n However, the report stresses the need to devote \r\nincreased financial and technical resources to certain \r\npriority areas — particularly agriculture — in order to \r\nincrease the potential of African countries to achieve \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. The need to do \r\nmore for the empowerment of women and for the \r\nestablishment of a business climate more favourable to \r\nthe development of the private sector is also stressed. \r\n I invite the Assembly to consider and comment \r\non all the conclusions and recommendations in the \r\nreport of the Secretary-General. I believe that it is \r\nimportant to stress that the recommendations call for a \r\ntrue spirit of partnership, since they are addressed both \r\nto development partners and to African countries. \r\n The same spirit is found in the proposal for an \r\nimproved monitoring mechanism to review \r\ncommitments for Africa’s development. Five years \r\nbefore the deadline of 2015 for the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, increased monitoring \r\nis essential in order to ensure that mutual \r\naccountability is not a meaningless phrase and that the \r\ncommitments undertaken have concrete effects for \r\ndisadvantaged populations. \r\n The proposed mechanism is based on existing \r\nprocesses — this should be stressed — and its value \r\nadded will derive primarily from leveraging the political \r\nauthority and legitimacy of the General Assembly. \r\n The report of the Secretary-General describes \r\nvarious options and makes a number of \r\nrecommendations concerning possible institutional \r\narrangements, whether the monitoring process is \r\nplaced under the authority of the General Assembly or \r\nunder that of the Economic and Social Council. I invite \r\nyou to share your views on the various options \r\nproposed. Resolution 63/1 calls for the establishment \r\nof an improved review mechanism during the sixty-\r\nfifth session. It is my hope — and I promise to do my \r\nutmost — that real progress will be made in this \r\nregard. \r\n Many aspects raised in the two reports, \r\nparticularly the importance of partnerships, are \r\nreflected in the report of the Secretary-General on the \r\nimplementation of the recommendations contained in \r\nthe report on the causes of conflict and the promotion \r\nof durable peace and sustainable development in \r\nAfrica. \r\n Going forward, this in-depth report stresses that \r\ncertain areas require increased attention and that during \r\nthe decades to come some aspects will constitute real \r\nchallenges, particularly small-scale conflicts within \r\nStates triggered by the exclusion of significant portions \r\nof the population from participation in political \r\ninstitutions and from access to economic resources. \r\n The activities of the United Nations will focus \r\nincreasingly on the question of social justice. The \r\nreport calls on the United Nations to acknowledge the \r\nlimitations of its action and the need to cooperate and \r\nbetter coordinate with regional organizations, local \r\ngovernments, civil society and the private sector. \r\n A/65/PV.30\r\n \r\n3 10-58121 \r\n \r\n I hope that today’s debate will make a \r\nconstructive contribution to those various issues, which \r\nare of fundamental importance for Africa’s \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Mr. Charlier (Belgium): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the European Union. The candidate \r\ncountries Turkey, Croatia and the former Yugoslav \r\nRepublic of Macedonia; the countries of the \r\nStabilization and Association Process and potential \r\ncandidates Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia \r\nand Montenegro; as well as the Republic of Moldova, \r\nalign themselves with this statement. \r\n Despite many unresolved challenges in the \r\naftermath of the global financial crisis, Africa has over \r\nrecent years demonstrated impressive progress in the \r\nareas of peace, political governance and economic \r\ngrowth. But Africa, like no other continent, remains \r\nheavily affected by the challenges of food security and \r\nclimate change. \r\n The Joint Africa-European Union Strategy agreed \r\nin 2007 forms the basis of our steadily expanding \r\ncooperation. The upcoming third Africa-European \r\nUnion Summit, to be held in Libya on 29 and  \r\n30 November, will build on the political framework \r\nprovided by the Joint Africa-European Union Strategy \r\nand add fresh impetus to our future cooperation. \r\n A basic premise of the European Union’s \r\npartnership with Africa is the continent’s responsibility \r\nfor its own development. Similarly, this is the core \r\nprinciple of the African Union’s socio economic \r\nprogramme. \r\n Support from the international community must \r\nbe aimed at helping African institutions and African \r\ncountries develop their capacities to promote \r\ncontinental, regional and national projects and to \r\nmobilize the necessary resources for the priorities \r\nidentified. Our aim is to support Africa’s own political \r\nand economic integration agenda, through regional \r\ntrade and political partnership, and to strengthen the \r\nlinks between regional economic communities. \r\n The European Union recognizes the added value \r\nof the African Union and the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) in the definition of \r\ncontinental projects and as monitor of commitments \r\ntowards African development needs, including in such \r\nareas as governance and agriculture, where NEPAD has \r\ntaken the lead with the African Peer Review \r\nMechanism and the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture \r\nDevelopment Programme. In this context, we welcome \r\nthe recent embedding of the NEPAD programme within \r\nthe structure of the African Union and its Commission. \r\n The promotion of democratic and transparent \r\nsystems of government and respect for human rights \r\nand fundamental freedoms are key components of the \r\nJoint Africa-European Union Strategy. The aim of the \r\npartnership in this area is to facilitate an open, broad-\r\nbased dialogue on all pertinent issues, including human \r\nrights and the full enjoyment of such rights by all \r\nwomen, men and children. Democracy and democratic \r\ngovernance must form part of this dialogue, too. \r\n Within the framework of this partnership, the \r\nEuropean Union will soon launch with our African \r\npartners a joint platform for dialogue on governance, to \r\nstrengthen the Africa-European Union dialogue on a \r\nnumber of key issues regarding democratic governance \r\nand human rights. \r\n Here, one issue that I would like to draw \r\nparticular attention to is the situation of women in \r\nAfrica. Women’s rights and opportunities are \r\nfundamental for peacebuilding, economic growth, \r\ndevelopment and well-being, and there are now a \r\nnumber of continental initiatives under way to do \r\nsomething with more impact in these areas, including \r\nthe ongoing Africa-UNiTE campaign to end violence \r\nagainst women and girls. \r\n As part of our commitment to a strong \r\npartnership for development in Africa, the European \r\nUnion recently reaffirmed its commitments to reach a \r\ncollective official development assistance target of \r\n0.7 per cent of gross national income by 2015, \r\nchannelling at least 50 per cent of its collective aid \r\nincreases to Africa. \r\n The European Union also continues to work on \r\nimproving coherence among EU policies in the areas of \r\nresource mobilization and more effective development \r\nassistance. \r\n Trade is a prerequisite for economic growth and \r\nsustainable efforts against poverty. Together we must \r\ncontinue promoting a market-oriented world trading \r\nsystem. Access for African goods and services to \r\ninternational markets needs to be improved. A \r\nsuccessful conclusion of the Doha Round is crucial and \r\nremains a top priority for the European Union. The \r\nA/65/PV.30  \r\n \r\n10-58121 4 \r\n \r\nability to seize the business opportunities that \r\ninternational trade offers also needs to be enhanced. \r\n Health in Africa remains another major challenge \r\nfor us all. Africa continues to face a huge burden of \r\npotentially preventable and treatable diseases, which \r\ncause avertable deaths and untold suffering, while \r\nblocking economic development and damaging the \r\ncontinent’s social fabric. \r\n We know that malaria — alongside other diseases \r\nsuch as HIV/AIDS — inflicts a heavy burden on \r\nAfrica. But, as the World Health Organization (WHO) \r\nreport transmitted by the Secretary-General notes, \r\nsignificant progress has been made in the global fight \r\nagainst malaria in recent years, including in Africa. \r\nCountries such as Rwanda, Eritrea and Zambia have \r\nshown how long-lasting insecticidal mosquito nets, \r\neffective artemisinin-based treatment and indoor \r\nspraying with insecticide can achieve impressive \r\nresults. A clear focus on effective interventions, \r\nadequate funding and political determination has \r\nproved to be successful. \r\n However, as the WHO report also notes, \r\nsignificant financial gaps remain despite financial \r\ncommitments to malaria control increasing fivefold over \r\nthe period 2003-2009, with a particularly large increase \r\nlast year. As the world’s largest donor both in general \r\nand in the health sector in particular, the European \r\nUnion will continue to lead the global efforts to sustain \r\nfinancial commitments in response to malaria, and will \r\nwork through national Governments, the Global Fund to \r\nFight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the United \r\nNations system and other relevant organizations and \r\nmechanisms, including non-governmental organizations. \r\n In this regard, the European Union welcomes the \r\n$11.7 billion raised through the Global Fund \r\nreplenishment conference for the next three years, with \r\nthe European Union and its member States representing \r\nover 30 per cent of this commitment. \r\n Combating diseases such as malaria, through \r\nstrengthened national health systems, will, in our view, \r\nbe one of the most effective ways to alleviate poverty \r\nand promote equitable and sustainable economic \r\nprogress. We need to further invest in the health \r\nworkforce and build capacity for prevention, treatment \r\nand care, which will also help us accelerate progress \r\ntowards achievement of Millennium Development Goal \r\n(MDG) 4, concerning child health, MDG 5, concerning \r\nmaternal health, and MDG 6, concerning combating \r\nHIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases. The European \r\nUnion continues to work closely with African \r\nGovernments to enable them to fulfil their commitment \r\nto allocate 15 per cent of State budgets to health, in \r\nline with the 2001 Abuja Declaration. \r\n To conclude, the European Union is fully \r\ncommitted to supporting African countries and their \r\npeoples in their quest for peace, democratic governance \r\nand human rights and sustainable development. \r\nPartnership in these fields is a contribution to peace \r\nand stability in Africa, too, because it addresses the \r\nroot causes of conflict. The European Union will \r\ncontinue to support the positive developments of the \r\nlast decade. \r\n Despite slow progress in many areas, the recent \r\nHigh-level Meeting on the MDGs showed us that \r\nachieving the MDGs in Africa is possible if we \r\naccelerate our efforts for the final stretch leading up to \r\n2015. \r\n Mr. Al-Saadi (Yemen): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the Group of 77 (G-77) and China \r\non agenda item 62. \r\n The year 2010 has been a remarkable one for the \r\nAfrican Union (AU) and its New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD). It will be recalled \r\nthat extensive efforts to integrate NEPAD into the \r\nstructures and processes of the AU finally culminated \r\nin the decision of the fourteenth AU summit, held in \r\nAddis Ababa, Ethiopia, to formally establish the \r\nNEPAD Planning and Coordinating Agency as a \r\ntechnical body of the African Union. \r\n As mandated by the African Union Assembly \r\ndecision, the Agency’s role as a planning unit will be to \r\naim to facilitate and coordinate implementation of \r\ncontinental and regional programmes, and mobilize \r\nresources for the implementation of Africa’s priority \r\nprogrammes and projects. The Agency’s role in \r\nconducting and coordinating research and knowledge \r\nmanagement will be to create an enabling environment \r\nto achieve food security and agricultural development \r\nin the next five years. \r\n We have had the opportunity this year to reflect \r\non the situation and challenges of the African \r\ncontinent. The High-level Meeting of the General \r\nAssembly on the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs), held from 20 to 22 September, was one such \r\n A/65/PV.30\r\n \r\n5 10-58121 \r\n \r\noccasion, when the Group of 77 and China stressed the \r\nneed for the international community to be \r\n “fully committed to assisting those countries that \r\nare lagging behind, especially the least developed \r\ncountries, the landlocked developing countries \r\nand the small island developing States, as well as \r\nAfrica.” (A/65/PV.4, p. 55) \r\n In their thirty-fourth Ministerial Declaration, the \r\nMinisters for Foreign Affairs of the member States of \r\nthe Group of 77 and China recognized the special \r\nneeds of Africa, and called for the full and timely \r\nimplementation of all commitments so as to enable \r\nAfrican countries to achieve the MDGs by 2015. The \r\nMinisters further recalled the commitment of all States \r\nto establish a monitoring mechanism to follow up on \r\nall commitments by the international community \r\nrelated to the development of Africa, as contained in \r\nthe political declaration on Africa’s development \r\nneeds, and stressed that all commitments to Africa \r\nshould be effectively implemented and given \r\nappropriate follow-up by the international community \r\nand Africa itself. \r\n The Ministers underlined the importance of \r\naccelerating sustainable broad-based economic growth, \r\nwhich is pivotal to bringing Africa into the mainstream \r\nof the global economy. To that end, they underscored \r\nthe urgent need to address the special needs of Africa \r\nbased on a partnership among equals, and underlined \r\nthe need to provide new additional resources, \r\ntechnology transfer and capacity-building to African \r\ncountries, and to support their sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Today, five years from 2015, the target date for \r\nachieving the MDGs, Africa unfortunately remains the \r\nonly continent not on track to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals by that target date. \r\n The financial and economic crisis had \r\ntremendous negative effects on African economies, \r\nincreasing the level of poverty and unemployment on \r\nthe continent as well as reversing the progress African \r\ncountries have made in recent years. The global \r\nfinancial and economic crises had a profound adverse \r\nimpact on African development. The poor African \r\ncountries, with their high dependence on agricultural \r\ncommodity exports, are among the most adversely \r\nimpacted by the failure of the global trade negotiations \r\nand the continued application of massive subsidies by \r\ndeveloped countries. \r\n This situation obviously entails further \r\nstrengthening and enhancement of the global \r\npartnership for development, and vigorous \r\nimplementation of all development commitments \r\nwithout any further delay, in particular implementation \r\nof the promises that have been made in support of \r\nAfrica. Today, inadequacy of resources is widely seen \r\nas the main constraint on African development. Despite \r\nserious, sincere and consistent efforts by the African \r\ncountries to implement NEPAD, Africa is still far from \r\nrealizing the levels of support required under the \r\nPartnership. If we are to succeed in eradicating poverty \r\nand hunger in Africa, urgent and concerted action by \r\ndeveloped countries and the international community is \r\nneeded. \r\n African countries have taken concrete steps to \r\nimplement the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment, through the development of sectoral \r\npolicy frameworks, the design of specific projects and \r\nthe establishment of expenditure targets in NEPAD \r\npriority areas. Through NEPAD, African countries have \r\nfundamentally changed the development paradigm. The \r\nnarrow approach of the Poverty Reduction Strategy \r\nPapers has been expanded to include a comprehensive \r\nand holistic approach to development through African \r\nownership. In fact, most African countries now have \r\ntheir own national development strategies. These \r\nefforts require an enabling national and international \r\nenvironment conducive to growth and development \r\nwith the participation of the multi-stakeholders. \r\n In the 2010 world summit outcome document the \r\nheads of State and Government said: \r\n “more attention should be given to Africa, \r\nespecially those countries most off track to \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals by \r\n2015. Progress has been made in some African \r\ncountries, but the situation in others remains a \r\ngrave concern, not least because the continent is \r\namong the hardest hit by the financial and \r\neconomic crisis. … However, [aid] still lags \r\nbehind the commitments that have been made. \r\nWe therefore strongly call for the delivery of \r\nthose commitments.” (resolution 65/1, para. 33) \r\nThose commitments include doubling aid to Africa. \r\n The Group of 77 and China are of the view that \r\nresources must be mobilized for African States, the \r\nregional economic communities and the African Union \r\nin order to support efforts to achieve the MDGs within \r\nA/65/PV.30  \r\n \r\n10-58121 6 \r\n \r\nthe framework of national development programmes \r\nand to implement NEPAD. We have taken note of the \r\noutcome document of the MDGs summit, and look \r\nforward to the urgent implementation of the \r\ncommitments that were stated. \r\n In this regard, the Group of 77 and China once \r\nagain reiterate the urgent need to establish a \r\nmonitoring mechanism to follow up on all \r\ncommitments related to the development of Africa, as \r\ncontained in the review process of the political \r\ndeclaration on Africa’s development needs (resolution \r\n63/1) and as recommended in the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport. In our view, the process will be under the \r\nauspices of the General Assembly. The implementation \r\nof the commitments of African Governments and their \r\ndevelopment partners will be reviewed, beginning at \r\nthe sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly. \r\n Progress towards sustaining development in \r\nAfrica requires, among other things, writing off the \r\ninsupportable debt of African countries by both \r\nbilateral and multilateral donors. Reaching the target of \r\nreducing poverty in half by 2015 would require a \r\ngrowth rate, on average, of 7 per cent to 8 per cent per \r\nannum. To achieve that rather high rate of growth, we \r\ncall for a number of measures towards mobilizing \r\nexternal resources. We emphasize the imperative need \r\nfor increased official development assistance, which, \r\nof course, needs to be combined with a set of other \r\npolicy measures to advance developing countries in \r\nAfrica. \r\n As far as the environment is concerned, we \r\nrecognize the importance of addressing in an \r\ninterrelated and mutually supportive manner the three \r\ndimensions of sustainable development. In this regard, \r\nthe G-77 and China strongly call for strengthened \r\nmeasures to enhance assistance to the African countries \r\nin their fight against land degradation, drought and \r\ndesertification by multilateral and bilateral donors and \r\nthrough public and private partnership. \r\n Finally, the Group is pleased that United Nations \r\nagencies have organized themselves into various \r\nclusters in line with NEPAD priority areas as a way to \r\nincrease coordination and cooperation in their work \r\nrelated to NEPAD. Additionally, a number of these \r\nagencies play a critical role in supporting the work of \r\nNEPAD, especially in areas such as agriculture, trade \r\nand market access, infrastructure development, science \r\nand technology, among others. We welcome the United \r\nNations present support for Africa, but we call on the \r\nUnited Nations to mainstream NEPAD into its \r\nnormative and operational activities. \r\n Mr. Talbot (Guyana): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of the member States of the Caribbean \r\nCommunity (CARICOM) in this debate on the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). \r\n CARICOM welcomes this opportunity to renew \r\nsolidarity with the cause of peace and development for \r\nthe people of Africa. The people of the Caribbean are \r\nlinked to our brothers and sisters in Africa by age-old \r\nbonds of history and culture, by common struggles and \r\nshared aspirations. Our Community maintains an \r\nabiding interest in the quest of the African people for \r\nsocio-economic transformation and the consolidation \r\nof durable peace. \r\n Africa, the ancient home of man, is now \r\nemerging as a new frontier of development and human \r\nprogress. Its nearly 1 billion people deserve the \r\nopportunity to fully realize the aspirations they share \r\nwith all humanity to fulfil the promise of their potential \r\nin conditions of peace and stability, free from fear and \r\nfrom want. Many of these aspirations find expression \r\nin the New Partnership, which represents a collective \r\nvision and a strategic framework for socio-economic \r\ndevelopment in Africa. \r\n The support of CARICOM for NEPAD is guided \r\nby a fundamental respect for Africa’s ownership and \r\nleadership of its own development process. This we \r\nview as a key principle for development effectiveness \r\nand cooperation. \r\n The Caribbean Community is pleased to note that \r\nthe story of Africa is increasingly one of promise. \r\nNevertheless, the continent faces the greatest risk in all \r\nthe developing world of falling short in achievement of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Based on \r\ncurrent data, despite increased economic growth since \r\n2000, there has not been commensurate progress by \r\nAfrica towards attainment of the MDGs, and the region \r\nis acknowledged as being the most off-track in this \r\nregard. Africa will therefore necessarily remain a key \r\nfocus for development efforts over the next five years. \r\n Africa is also the locus of the major part of \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping and peacebuilding \r\nefforts. Indeed, the quest for durable peace continues to \r\nrequire the most patient and active engagement so that \r\nthe spectre of conflict and division will yield to a new \r\n A/65/PV.30\r\n \r\n7 10-58121 \r\n \r\nparadigm where the vast resources of this great people \r\nare used to serve their welfare, and to lay the \r\nfoundations for enduring progress. \r\n The prospects for such an outcome have \r\nimproved in recent times. CARICOM is heartened by \r\nthe successes recorded in recent years in United \r\nNations peacekeeping on African soil. We are \r\nencouraged that more African countries have emerged, \r\nor are emerging, from conflict, though recovery in \r\nsome instances is fragile and the risk of relapse is still \r\nvery present. This brings into obvious relief the \r\nimportance of United Nations peacebuilding efforts \r\nand renders imperative the creation of the necessary \r\nconditions both within and outside the continent for \r\nthose efforts to have the best chance of success. \r\n In many ways, therefore, Africa represents a \r\nbeacon of opportunity for cooperation and partnership. \r\nThe Caribbean Community stands ready to play its part \r\nas a partner with Africa in the advancement of our \r\nmutual objectives. Even as we speak, CARICOM \r\ncollaboration with Africa finds expression in the \r\npolitical, economic, social, environmental and cultural \r\ndomains, and in forums such as the Africa, Caribbean \r\nand Pacific Group of States, the Alliance of Small \r\nIsland States, the Group of 77, the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement and the Commonwealth, and indeed in the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n CARICOM shares with Africa a commitment to \r\ndeepening regional integration in the context of a \r\nchallenging global environment. Our two regions have \r\nbeen responding to several of the challenges that have \r\nemerged in the process of strengthening integration. \r\nThis endeavour has made it necessary that more \r\nappropriate structures for regional governance be put in \r\nplace. \r\n Africa and the Caribbean face a number of other \r\nchallenges in common, not least in the area of health. \r\n The scourge of HIV/AIDS has had a major \r\nimpact on our respective populations. Africa and the \r\nCaribbean respectively have the first and second \r\nhighest incidences of HIV infections globally. This \r\nunwelcome reality nevertheless provides an \r\nopportunity for collaboration and the exchange of \r\nexperience and best practice. CARICOM stands ready \r\nto learn from our African counterparts and to share our \r\nown experience in this vital area. For its part, the Pan \r\nCaribbean Partnership against HIV and AIDS has been \r\nidentified by the Joint United Nations Programme on \r\nHIV/AIDS as best practice in regard to a regional \r\nresponse to the pandemic. \r\n Africa continues to grapple with other challenges \r\nin the area of health, notably relating to malaria and \r\nmaternal and child health. Overcoming those \r\nchallenges will be an important catalyst for Africa’s \r\nfuture progress. \r\n Our region is grateful for the support extended by \r\nAfrican countries to the CARICOM initiative on the \r\nprevention and control of non-communicable diseases. \r\nAvailable data establish this as an area of present and \r\ngrowing concern, not only in Africa and the Caribbean, \r\nbut also in other regions of the world. Indeed, it is a \r\nsituation that warrants the immediate and concerted \r\nattention of the international community. \r\n CARICOM also welcomes the Declaration of the \r\nAssembly of the African Union on the situation in the \r\nRepublic of Haiti, adopted during the Assembly’s \r\nfourteenth ordinary session, following the devastating \r\nearthquake that struck our sister CARICOM country in \r\nJanuary this year. We take this opportunity to express \r\nour appreciation for the active solidarity and financial \r\nand material support extended by African countries to \r\nHaiti. \r\n CARICOM takes note of the agreement of \r\nAfrican leaders to focus policy interventions on the \r\npriority areas of agriculture and food security, transport \r\nand energy development, and climate change. \r\n The development of agriculture is critical to \r\nAfrica’s development prospects. CARICOM strongly \r\nsupports and encourages the work currently under way \r\nto promote an African green revolution. We welcome \r\nthe commitment of African leaders to institute new \r\nmeasures to ensure that within five years Africa can \r\nproduce enough food to feed its people. We urge the \r\ninternational community to continue and strengthen its \r\nsupport for Africa’s efforts to realize those objectives. \r\n CARICOM and Africa share a vital interest in \r\naddressing the challenge posed by climate change. The \r\nneed for an ambitious and comprehensive global \r\nresponse is especially urgent for the many countries in \r\nAfrica, the Caribbean, the Pacific and elsewhere that \r\nare on the front lines of this looming catastrophe. We \r\ncall for an urgent scaling up of international action to \r\nensure a credible response to this threat and for speedy \r\ndelivery on fast-start financing. \r\nA/65/PV.30  \r\n \r\n10-58121 8 \r\n \r\n CARICOM is ever mindful of the complex \r\ninterrelationships between governance, peace and \r\ndevelopment. We support ongoing efforts by African \r\ncountries to improve economic and political \r\ngovernance, and to strengthen mechanisms for \r\nparticipation, inclusion and empowerment of all \r\nsegments of African society in the political and \r\ndevelopment processes on the continent. We \r\nacknowledge the role of the African Peer Review \r\nMechanism as an instrument for advancing good \r\ngovernance in Africa, and note that an increasing \r\nnumber of African countries now subscribe to the \r\nMechanism. \r\n CARICOM also believes that focused efforts \r\nmust continue to be made to eliminate the combination \r\nof internal and external factors that engender conflict \r\nand stymie development. \r\n The continued support of the international \r\ncommunity remains vital as Africa charts its way \r\nforward. In this regard, CARICOM encourages \r\nintensified international efforts to support the \r\ndevelopment of Africa. We take note of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report on a monitoring mechanism to review \r\ncommitments towards Africa’s development needs. We \r\nanticipate early agreement on such a mechanism, in \r\nkeeping with resolution 64/258, in order to encourage \r\nthe implementation of the commitments, promotion of \r\npartnership and mutual accountability, the fulfilment of \r\npledges of development assistance, and the \r\nenhancement of aid effectiveness. \r\n In closing, I note that in 2011 the international \r\ncommunity will mark the International Year for People \r\nof African Descent, with a view to strengthening \r\nnational actions and regional and international \r\ncooperation for the benefit of people of African \r\ndescent. We believe that this observance can make an \r\nimportant contribution to a paradigm shift that \r\nengenders greater Afro-optimism and help to realize \r\nwhat Mr. Bingu Wa Mutharika, President of the \r\nRepublic of Malawi and Chairperson of the African \r\nUnion, has described as the “Africa of the new \r\nbeginning”. \r\n Mr. Kleib (Indonesia): I have the honour and \r\nprivilege to address the General Assembly on behalf of \r\nthe 10 member States of the Association of Southeast \r\nAsian Nations (ASEAN): Brunei Darussalam, \r\nCambodia, Indonesia, the Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, \r\nSingapore, Thailand and Viet Nam. \r\n ASEAN aligns itself with the statement made by \r\nthe representative of Yemen on behalf of the Group of \r\n77 and China. \r\n We wish to thank the Secretary-General for his \r\ninsight and his comprehensive reports under agenda \r\nitem 62, “New Partnership for Africa’s Development: \r\nprogress in implementation and international support”. \r\n ASEAN attaches great importance to friendship \r\nand cooperation with Africa. Through the decades, the \r\nrelationships between ASEAN and African countries \r\nhave been consolidated and enhanced in a spirit of \r\nsolidarity, close cooperation, and mutual respect. \r\nThrough cooperation, both regions have experienced \r\nsignificant changes and development for the benefit of \r\ntheir peoples. \r\n ASEAN strongly supports the implementation of \r\nthe New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD), and considers it an important tool to address \r\npoverty and underdevelopment throughout the African \r\ncontinent. NEPAD has provided a collective vision and \r\na strategic socio economic development framework for \r\nAfrica. It is a home-grown effort of the African \r\ncontinent to implement a comprehensive and holistic \r\napproach to development. \r\n ASEAN welcomes the significant progress made \r\nthrough the efforts of African peoples and leaders \r\ntowards some sectoral priorities of NEPAD and the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), such as \r\neducation, health, infrastructure, and agriculture. Such \r\nprogress shows the determination of Africa to promote \r\nsustainable growth and achieve the MDGs, even in the \r\nface of tremendous challenges. It has certainly helped \r\nto change the image of Africa. Despite the valiant \r\nefforts, however, the hard-won progress has still not \r\nreached expected levels. Africa’s efforts should be \r\ncontinuously encouraged and supported. \r\n As emphasized in the Secretary-General’s reports, \r\nmost African countries face serious challenges in \r\nreaching the MDGs, particularly in the current fragile \r\nand uncertain global economic recovery. ASEAN \r\nacknowledges that much needs to be done in support of \r\nAfrica’s implementation with regard to NEPAD and the \r\nMDGs. Continued attention to, and assistance for, \r\nAfrica should remain a focus of international \r\ndevelopment action plans and programmes. \r\n A/65/PV.30\r\n \r\n9 10-58121 \r\n \r\n In that regard, ASEAN reaffirms its commitment \r\nto strengthen its cooperation and collaboration with \r\nAfrica. We are ready to enhance the relationship and \r\npartnership with Africa for the achievement of the \r\nMDGs and sustainable development. We believe that, \r\nthrough mutual support, sharing of experiences and \r\nbest practices in socio economic development, both \r\nASEAN and Africa can achieve those objectives. \r\n ASEAN has been doing its utmost to promote \r\nSouth-South cooperation with African partners as a \r\ncomplement to North-South cooperation in promoting \r\ntrade, infrastructure, agriculture, food security, \r\ncommunication and health care in Africa. ASEAN has \r\nalso been working hard to explore and implement \r\nconcrete steps to ensure successes for both ASEAN and \r\nAfrica. \r\n We believe that South-South cooperation is the \r\nbest strategy to promote an ASEAN and African \r\npartnership. South-South cooperation in key strategic \r\nareas such as the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture \r\nDevelopment Programme would significantly contribute \r\nto Africa’s development and integration, in terms of the \r\neradication of poverty and hunger, agriculture and rural \r\ndevelopment, as well as mitigation of, and adaptation to, \r\nclimate change. \r\n Within the context of scaling up efforts in \r\nimplementing NEPAD and achieving the MDGs, Africa \r\nhas a daunting task. It has to maintain peace, security \r\nand a politically stable environment. Meanwhile, there \r\nare also the important tasks of consolidating \r\ndevelopment strategies; strengthening leadership and \r\nownership; enhancing capacity-development; \r\nmobilizing more resources at national and international \r\nlevels; and developing strategic partnerships. \r\n In that connection, the recent integration of \r\nNEPAD into the structures and processes of the African \r\nUnion, and the establishment of the NEPAD Planning \r\nand Coordinating Agency (NPCA), mark a significant \r\nstage in NEPAD’s implementation. It is a good way to \r\nfacilitate and improve the management and \r\ncoordination of the implementation of Africa’s regional \r\nand continental priority programmes and projects, \r\npromising better outcomes of Africa’s development \r\nprocess. \r\n However, NEPAD and NPCA need adequate \r\nhuman and financial resources to meet their objectives. \r\nDeveloped partners need to do more in response to \r\ntheir needs. \r\n Meeting international commitments, particularly \r\non the essential issues, includes increasing official \r\ndevelopment assistance flows to Africa, especially \r\nimplementing the promises by the Group of Eight at \r\nGleneagles and Canada to double aid to Africa by \r\n2010, and mobilizing an additional fund of $5 billion \r\nover the next five years to achieve the MDGs; \r\nfacilitating foreign direct investment flow to Africa and \r\nimproving investment climates, particularly for \r\ninvestments in infrastructure, agriculture, rural \r\ndevelopment and food security; and promoting trade \r\nwith Africa by implementing Aid for Trade \r\nprogrammes and commitments. \r\n More efforts need to be made to reach agreement \r\nin the Doha Round of World Trade Organization trade \r\nnegotiations, especially on agricultural market access \r\nand reduction of agricultural subsidies, which have \r\nprofound implications for Africa. \r\n That having been said, ASEAN fully supports the \r\nconclusion and recommendations of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his reports regarding proper ways and \r\nmeans to scale up the implementation of NEPAD and \r\nbuild on the momentum of international support for \r\nAfrica’s development. In addition, we also support the \r\nrecommended establishment of a review process as a \r\nmechanism to monitor commitments to Africa’s \r\ndevelopment. \r\n ASEAN welcomes every positive initiative to \r\nadvance the common development agenda between \r\nASEAN and Africa for the benefit of our peoples. We \r\nstand ready to strengthen cooperation, collaboration \r\nand solidarity with the international community, \r\nparticularly with Africa, to realize the internationally \r\nagreed development goals, including the MDGs. We \r\nare confident that Africa can carry out NEPAD for the \r\npeace, security, prosperity and sustainable development \r\nof Africa and the world. \r\n Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I have the pleasure of aligning myself with the \r\nstatement made by the representative of Yemen on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China, and with that to \r\nbe made by Malawi on behalf of the African Group. \r\n Our meeting today comes less than a month after \r\nthe High-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), whose outcome \r\ndocument (resolution 65/1) emphasized the urgent need \r\nto address the special development needs of Africa, the \r\ncontinent lagging behind the most in reaching the \r\nA/65/PV.30  \r\n \r\n10-58121 10 \r\n \r\ninternationally agreed development goals, particularly \r\nthe MDGs. The meeting also underlined the unfulfilled \r\ncommitments and the urgent need to bridge the \r\ndelivery gap that is shadowing their fulfilment. \r\n The adverse impact of the world financial and \r\neconomic crisis on the developing countries, \r\nparticularly in Africa, has affected the efforts of \r\nAfrican countries to achieve the internationally agreed \r\ndevelopment goals. That is due to the negative \r\nconsequences of the crisis for export earnings, \r\nremittances and foreign direct investment, as well as \r\nfor the ability of the African countries to pay their \r\ndebts. \r\n In the meantime, the crisis has revealed the \r\nresolve of African countries to address the \r\nrepercussions of the crisis through adjusting their \r\neconomic and management structures and restoring an \r\naverage growth rate that was estimated to be more than \r\n4 per cent in 2010, after being around 2 per cent in \r\n2009 due to the crisis. Although growth rates remain \r\nbelow pre crisis levels — as well as below the level \r\nrequired to make significant improvements in social \r\nconditions and to achieve the MDGs — Africa can take \r\nvigorous steps along the road to economic recovery \r\nthat exceed all expectations, particularly if \r\ninternational support is extended and commitments are \r\nfulfilled. \r\n The New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD) has been among the main vehicles for \r\nenhancing such structures. Through NEPAD the \r\nAfrican countries have taken big strides in various \r\naspects of development, such as infrastructure, \r\nagriculture, food security, health, education, and \r\ninformation and communications technology. There has \r\nalso been significant progress in respect for human \r\nrights and fundamental freedoms, including through \r\nthe activities of the African Peer Review Mechanism. \r\nThat Mechanism now comprises 30 countries, \r\nincluding Egypt, reflecting Africa’s progress in good \r\ngovernance, improving the human rights situation and \r\nstrengthening democracy. \r\n In that context, there is an urgent need for our \r\ndevelopment partners to fulfil all official development \r\nassistance (ODA) and other commitments made in \r\ndifferent forums to support development in Africa. \r\nThey must lift all barriers, whether related to subsidies \r\nor other technical barriers, that cause African exports \r\nto be at a disadvantage and increase Africa’s share of \r\ntrade-related aid. Our partners should facilitate access \r\nto world markets and make additional efforts to bring \r\nthe Doha Round of global trade negotiations to a \r\ncomprehensive and development-oriented conclusion. \r\n Furthermore, Egypt stresses that the improvement \r\nof the continent’s development situation remains \r\nincomplete without affirming the necessity of seriously \r\nmoving forward on a reform of the existing \r\ndeficiencies and shortcomings in the international \r\neconomic and financial system. Such a reform must \r\nend the marginalization of the African continent in \r\ninternational economic decision-making and enhance \r\nthe continent’s voice and participation. The status quo, \r\nwhich deprives the countries of the continent of their \r\nright to effectively participate in managing the global \r\neconomic system, cannot continue at a time when that \r\nsystem gravely affects their economic situation. We \r\ncannot accept a new system that consecrates such \r\nmarginalization instead of addressing it. \r\n In that context, Egypt welcomes the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s recommendations on a monitoring \r\nmechanism to review the implementation of \r\ncommitments to Africa’s development needs. Egypt \r\nbelieves that the General Assembly provides a suitable \r\nframework for that mechanism, which would also \r\nreflect the great importance that the United Nations \r\nmembership attaches to the cause of enhancing \r\ndevelopment in Africa. In the meantime, any future \r\nagreed mechanism must put more emphasis on \r\nfollowing up and monitoring the implementation of \r\nODA and other aid-related commitments to Africa. \r\n Despite the significant improvement that Africa \r\nhas achieved in the areas of peace and security, \r\ndevelopment, and respect for human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms, it still faces many complex \r\nchallenges. They include intra State conflicts, \r\nunconstitutional changes of Government, election-\r\nrelated violence and illicit trafficking in small arms, \r\nlight weapons and drugs. In addition, there is the \r\nmounting negative influence of other emerging \r\nchallenges, such as terrorism, threats to maritime \r\nsecurity, climate change and food security. Those \r\nthreats and challenges could undermine African \r\nendeavours to achieve stability and development. \r\n To address those challenges, Egypt believes that \r\nthe United Nations, the African Union and African \r\nsubregional organizations should combine all their \r\npreventive diplomacy, peacekeeping and peacebuilding \r\n A/65/PV.30\r\n \r\n11 10-58121 \r\n \r\ntools and should emphasize the linkage among the \r\npolitical, economic and social development aspects, as \r\nproposed by the Secretary-General in his report. It is \r\ntherefore of paramount importance that all pledges to \r\nsupport development in Africa be fully implemented. \r\n The growing cooperation between the African \r\nUnion and the United Nations has been crucial in \r\naddressing many of the challenges to peace and \r\nsecurity in Africa. The joint efforts of the two bodies to \r\ndeal with the situations in Kenya and Zimbabwe in the \r\npast and with the current situations in Guinea and the \r\nNiger, as well as other forms of cooperation such as the \r\nAfrican Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in \r\nDarfur, exemplify the fruits of that partnership. \r\nFurthermore, the work of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission to support four African countries that \r\nhave emerged from conflict underlines the importance \r\nof joint work towards peacebuilding in post-conflict \r\nsituations. \r\n In that regard, Egypt attaches great importance to \r\nenhancing the annual consultative mechanism between \r\nthe Security Council and the AU Peace and Security \r\nCouncil. \r\n In addition, we believe that the review process \r\nunder way regarding the implementation of the 10 year \r\ncapacity-building programme for the African Union \r\nwill further enhance United Nations support to build \r\nthe capacities of the African institutions in the areas of \r\npeace and security, socio-economic development and \r\npeacebuilding and peacekeeping. \r\n Enhancing peace, security and development in \r\nAfrica has always been among the top priorities of \r\nEgyptian foreign policy. One manifestation of that \r\ncommitment to the causes of our continent has been \r\nEgypt’s significant contribution to United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations in Africa, which has made \r\nEgypt among the top five troop-contributing countries. \r\n In the same vein, in August Egypt hosted the \r\n2010 High-Level Retreat on the Promotion of Peace, \r\nSecurity and Stability in Africa, which brought \r\ntogether United Nations and African Union envoys \r\nunder the theme “Making peace happen in Africa in \r\n2010 and beyond: developing common strategies and \r\nenhancing coordination”. The forum, which adopted \r\nthe “Cairo Call for Peace”, provided an excellent \r\nopportunity for deliberations and interaction among the \r\nofficials and high-level envoys of the two \r\norganizations on how to maximize the synergies of \r\ntheir work to address challenges to peace and security \r\nin various parts of the African continent. \r\n Since the Millennium Summit launched the \r\nDecade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing Countries, \r\nParticularly in Africa, international efforts have \r\nsucceeded in eliminating the disease in nearly half of \r\nthe malaria-infected countries. In addition, a marked \r\nreduction in infection rates has been achieved in a \r\nnumber of other countries as a result of programmes \r\nbeing implemented in cooperation with the United \r\nNations and other relevant bodies, international \r\nfinancial institutions, non-governmental organizations, \r\ncivil society and the private sector, and as a result of \r\nthe increase in available funding for such programmes. \r\n However, the continuing proliferation of the \r\ndisease in 109 countries reaffirms the need for \r\ncontinued support. It also reaffirms the need to ensure \r\nthe sustainability of funding in order to reduce \r\nmortality rates by half in 2010, with a view to reaching \r\na 75 per cent reduction in mortality rates by 2015. \r\nThere is also a need to address the spread of the \r\ndisease in Africa, where infection rates have reached \r\nalarming levels of 91 per cent, the highest in the world. \r\n Those facts underline the dire need to support \r\nefforts to revamp the infrastructure of the economic, \r\neducational and health systems in African countries. \r\nThere is also a serious need to transfer the necessary \r\ntechnical knowledge to support those efforts and \r\nensure the early diagnosis, treatment and prevention of \r\nthe disease through the participation of all forces of \r\nsociety. That entails intensifying awareness campaigns \r\nat national levels, alongside implementation of \r\nprevention and treatment programmes. It also entails \r\nworking to improve health-care systems and to provide \r\nmedicines and vaccinations and to train qualified \r\ncadres. \r\n Such undertakings are beyond the capacity of \r\nmany Governments unless they receive foreign \r\nassistance, particularly in Africa, where many countries \r\nare overburdened by malaria. Egypt calls on the \r\ninternational community to deliver on commitments \r\nmade at different international forums to support \r\nefforts to combat the spread of malaria. \r\n Egypt commends the initiative of Tanzania to \r\nestablish the African Leaders Malaria Alliance, thus \r\nreaffirming the commitments of African leaders to \r\ncombat the spread of malaria. The Alliance’s recent \r\nsuccessful efforts to promote preventive measures to \r\nA/65/PV.30  \r\n \r\n10-58121 12 \r\n \r\ncombat the spread of malaria and increase accessibility \r\nto diagnostic and treatment measures require parallel \r\ncommitments by the international community to \r\nprovide support at all levels. \r\n Furthermore, building national capacities must \r\ntake place in tandem with building regional capacity, in \r\norder to address the transboundary dimensions of the \r\ndisease. It was in that context that Egypt launched its \r\ninitiative to establish an African centre to promote \r\ncooperation and to exchange knowledge in the field of \r\ndisease control and to serve as a liaison between \r\nspecialized African centres. That initiative has been \r\nfully endorsed by African summits since 2005. \r\n It is also imperative to resolve the trade-related \r\naspects of the intellectual property rights with regard to \r\nmalaria medications and vaccines currently in \r\ncirculation or being developed. Indeed, the \r\ninternational community has to shoulder that \r\nresponsibility so as to ensure effectiveness of the \r\nefforts to eliminate malaria and to thwart the risk of its \r\nreintroduction so that we may realize our common \r\ngoals, especially MDG 6, by the targeted date, and in \r\nall States, with no exceptions. \r\n Mr. Wang Min (China) (spoke in Chinese): I \r\nwelcome the Secretary-General’s reports under these \r\nagenda items. \r\n The Chinese delegation endorses the statement \r\nmade by the representative of Yemen on behalf of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China. \r\n Today Africa faces both important opportunities \r\nand grave challenges in peace and development. Since \r\nthe launch of the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) nine years ago, with the \r\nvigorous support of the international community, the \r\nAfrican countries have made great progress in such \r\nareas as infrastructure, agriculture, health, education, \r\nthe environment and information and communications \r\ntechnology. Nevertheless, under the impact of the \r\nfinancial, food and energy crises, and of climate \r\nchange, Africa still faces an uphill task in achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals by 2015. \r\n Today most of the original hot spot issues \r\naffecting Africa’s peace and stability are, in the final \r\nanalysis, attributable to poverty and underdevelopment. \r\nChina believes that development is the basis for the \r\nattainment of peace in Africa. \r\n The international community should increase its \r\nsupport for Africa, and help it attain greater progress in \r\nthe implementation of NEPAD, and thus promote \r\nstability and prosperity in Africa. \r\n First, commitment to assistance should be \r\ndelivered promptly. Despite the slight increase in its \r\nvolume, the total official development assistance \r\n(ODA) for Africa in recent years still falls far short of \r\nthat pledged by the international community and \r\nAfrica’s actual needs. The developed countries should \r\nexpeditiously raise their ODA level to 0.7 per cent of \r\ntheir gross national income, further open their markets \r\nto African products, reduce or cancel debt, and increase \r\ntechnology transfer and investment so as to improve \r\nAfrica’s capacity for independent development. \r\n Secondly, African countries’ right to self-\r\ndetermination should be respected. The African \r\ncountries have made major headway through vigorous \r\nefforts to increase unity for greater strength, seek \r\nregional peace and stability and bring about economic \r\nreinvigoration. In providing assistance to Africa, the \r\ninternational community should show greater respect \r\nfor the real situation on the ground and the aspirations \r\nof the African countries, further remove \r\nconditionalities attached to aid, increase the \r\npredictability and transparency of such assistance and \r\nredress the power imbalance between donors and \r\nrecipients. \r\n Thirdly, South-South cooperation should be \r\nexpanded. As a useful complement to North-South \r\ncooperation, South-South cooperation has become an \r\neffective engine for Africa’s economic development. \r\nRecent years have seen brisk financial and commercial \r\nexchanges between countries in the South; the creation \r\nof various models of cooperation based on equality and \r\nmutual benefit in areas such as sharing knowledge, \r\nexchange of experience, training and technology \r\ntransfer; and contributions in kind and soft loans, \r\nwhich have further enhanced and revitalized South-\r\nSouth cooperation for Africa’s development. \r\n Fourthly, the role of international institutions \r\nmust be strengthened. The United Nations system is \r\nplaying an irreplaceable role in supporting NEPAD. It \r\nis imperative to further deepen the system’s partnership \r\nwith the African Union, the African Development Bank \r\nand regional economic communities, and to ensure that \r\nthe focus of various bodies of the United Nations \r\nsystem is aligned with the priorities of NEPAD. The \r\n A/65/PV.30\r\n \r\n13 10-58121 \r\n \r\ninternational financial institutions and international \r\ndevelopment agencies should also step up their support \r\nfor Africa. \r\n Fifthly, the realization of lasting peace in Africa \r\nshould be promoted. At present over 60 per cent of the \r\nitems on the Security Council’s agenda are related to \r\nAfrica, and 75 per cent of the Organization’s \r\ninternational peacekeepers are deployed in Africa. \r\nChina believes that the international community should \r\nvigorously support the African countries in their efforts \r\nto solve their disputes through peaceful consultations \r\nand support the efforts of the regional organizations, \r\nsuch as the African Union, in strengthening their \r\ncapacity-building in peacekeeping. The peaceful \r\nresolution of the hot spot issues in Africa should not be \r\ninterrupted or hindered by any means. The United \r\nNations should play a more proactive role in the field \r\nof peace and development in Africa, and the Security \r\nCouncil should play a more important role in \r\nmaintaining peace, security and stability there. \r\n China and Africa enjoy a profound tradition of \r\nfriendship. China has always been committed to the \r\ncause of peace and development on the African \r\ncontinent. Since the establishment of the China-Africa \r\nCooperation Forum in 2000, China’s strategic \r\npartnership with Africa has developed in depth; after a \r\ndecade’s efforts, fruitful results have been achieved in \r\nmany areas. \r\n In recent years the Chinese Government has \r\nimplemented various measures in its Africa-related \r\nassistance and cooperation. \r\n Last November the Chinese Government \r\nannounced, at the Fourth Ministerial Conference of the \r\nChina-Africa Cooperation Forum, a series of \r\npolicy measures in support of Africa’s development. \r\nThey include $10 billion of preferential loans to \r\nAfrican countries; cancellation of the unpaid interest-\r\nfree loans — expired at the end of 2009 — owed by \r\nheavily indebted poor countries and least developed \r\ncountries (LDCs) in Africa with diplomatic ties with \r\nChina; and progressive granting of duty-free treatment \r\nfor 95 per cent of the products of African LDCs that \r\nhave diplomatic ties with China, with the treatment \r\napplied to 60 per cent of such products as the first step \r\nin 2010. \r\n China fully supports the call to increase global \r\ncontrol of malaria. Between 2006 and 2009, China \r\nprovided RMB 300 million in grants to help Africa in \r\nthe fight against malaria. From now until 2012, China \r\nwill continue to provide its 30 malaria prevention and \r\ncontrol centres in Africa with anti-malaria supplies and \r\ninvite experts and technicians of the recipient countries \r\nworking in those centres to train in China so that these \r\ndevelopment projects become sustainable. \r\n In September, the second round of Ministerial \r\nPolitical Consultations between China and Africa took \r\nplace at United Nations Headquarters. China has \r\nalways engaged, and will continue to engage, in \r\nconstructive good offices and make efforts to address \r\nthe hot spot issues facing Africa. It will support the \r\nSecurity Council in playing an important role in \r\nhelping resolve conflicts in the African region and \r\nsupport and participate in United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations in Africa. It calls upon the international \r\ncommunity and United Nations entities, including the \r\nSecurity Council, to make more proactive and \r\nconstructive contributions for the maintenance of peace \r\nand security in Africa. \r\n We are convinced that the people of Africa have \r\nthe wisdom and ability to achieve economic \r\nrevitalization and social progress through their own \r\nunflagging efforts. China is ready to join the African \r\ncountries and the international community in \r\ncontinuing to contribute to the cause of peace and \r\ndevelopment in Africa. \r\n Mr. Sangqu (South Africa): I thank the \r\nSecretary-General for the reports presented under the \r\nagenda items that we are debating. I also take this \r\nopportunity to commend the Secretary-General and his \r\nSpecial Envoy for their work in mobilizing global \r\nsupport for action on malaria, particularly as we seek \r\nto fulfil the health-related Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). \r\n We meet today to discuss the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD), progress in \r\nimplementation and international support, as well as \r\ncauses of conflict and the promotion of durable peace \r\nand sustainable development in Africa and the Decade \r\nto Roll Back Malaria in Developing countries, \r\nParticularly in Africa. \r\n We align ourselves with the statement made by \r\nYemen on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. \r\n NEPAD was conceived as a blueprint for \r\nestablishing a socio-economic development framework \r\nA/65/PV.30  \r\n \r\n10-58121 14 \r\n \r\nfor Africa. It has been able to identify priority areas of \r\naction in line with the NEPAD objectives. \r\n South Africa is thus encouraged by the progress \r\nmade through the Programme for Infrastructure \r\nDevelopment in Africa, which provides a framework \r\nfor regional and continental transport networks, energy, \r\nwater and information and communications technology. \r\nIn this regard, we commend the international financial \r\ninstitutions and development banks that have pledged \r\nto increase their financial commitments to Africa by at \r\nleast $15 billion in the next two to three years. \r\n However, we are concerned that, although Africa \r\nwill need infrastructure investment totalling $93 billion \r\na year, it currently spends $45 billion annually. It is \r\ntherefore critical that we secure support for the \r\nremaining financing gap of $48 billion. \r\n In the context of NEPAD, the Comprehensive \r\nAfrica Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) \r\nwas developed, and several African countries are \r\nbenefiting from Group of Eight funding pledged at the \r\nL’Aquila 2009 Summit through ensuring that CAADP \r\nnational investment plans are in place. \r\n In addition to other endeavours to facilitate \r\ndevelopment, we have seen the African Peer Review \r\nMechanism (APRM) process go from strength to \r\nstrength. That is manifested by the increase in APRM \r\nmembership, which now stands at 29. This uniquely \r\ndesigned peer review mechanism has proved to be an \r\neffective tool for the advancement of good governance \r\non the continent. \r\n South Africa further commends the progress \r\nmade thus far towards the full integration of the \r\nNEPAD Planning and Coordinating Agency into the \r\nAfrican Union Commission structures and processes. \r\n The Secretary-General has called on the \r\ninternational community to provide adequate support \r\nfor African-led conflict-resolution strategies in line \r\nwith the priorities of the African Union (AU). \r\n Despite the numerous challenges that Africa still \r\nconfronts, the continent has over the past decade made \r\noutstanding improvements in many areas, including the \r\nbuilding of sustainable institutions. \r\n The creation of the African Union and its \r\nsubsidiary organs, which include the African Peace and \r\nSecurity Architecture, signal the strong commitment \r\nand political will of African leaders to advance peace \r\nand security throughout the continent. \r\n The African Union Post-Conflict Reconstruction \r\nand Development (PCRD) programme has proved to be \r\na progressive peacebuilding and development \r\nmechanism that should be meaningfully supported and \r\nsustained. South Africa is privileged to lead the \r\npioneering work of this AU programme in the Sudan. \r\nWhat is urgently required now is for the United \r\nNations to continue its support and assistance to the \r\nAU in line with the recommendations of the Prodi \r\nReport. \r\n Since 1994, South Africa has made its humble \r\ncontribution towards conflict resolution on the African \r\ncontinent. To this end, in line with the objectives of the \r\nPCRD, South Africa has played a significant role in \r\npost-conflict reconstruction and capacity-building in \r\ncountries such as Burundi, the Sudan, the Sahrawi Arab \r\nDemocratic Republic and the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo. \r\n Among other things, the inequitable distribution \r\nof income and resources within countries, the \r\npoliticization of ethnicity, asymmetric distribution of \r\npolitical power, and absence of the voice of the \r\nmajority in decision-making are systemic causes of \r\nmany conflicts that threaten the hard-won peace and \r\nstability of African States. In this context, we appeal to \r\nthe international community to focus its conflict-\r\nresolution initiatives on addressing the structural \r\nissues, instead of choosing the easy way of addressing \r\nproximate causes that usually last for a short time. For \r\na durable solution there is a need to recognize the \r\nimportance of development as a catalyst for peace and \r\nsecurity. \r\n We therefore call on the United Nations and the \r\nwider international community to work in partnership \r\nwith African States in actualizing their political, social \r\nand economic development potential. \r\n In 2009 the African leaders launched the African \r\nLeaders Malaria Alliance, and they continued to put \r\nmalaria control high on their agenda for 2010. \r\n The establishment of the Global Fund to Fight \r\nAIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and commitments by \r\nmembers of the international community, including the \r\nWorld Bank and other agencies, have contributed \r\nimmensely to the scaling up of malaria control \r\n A/65/PV.30\r\n \r\n15 10-58121 \r\n \r\ninterventions and have led to noticeable reductions in \r\nthe burden of malaria. \r\n South Africa calls upon the international \r\ncommunity to support national efforts by providing \r\ntechnical assistance to improve monitoring and \r\nevaluation systems in order to track and report on \r\nchanges in coverage and subsequent reductions in the \r\nburden of malaria. \r\n We encourage producers of long-lasting \r\ninsecticide-treated nets to provide technology transfer \r\nto developing countries. We also invite the World Bank \r\nand private-sector partners to assist malaria-endemic \r\ncountries in establishing factories to scale up \r\nproduction of the nets. \r\n South Africa welcomes the recognition that the \r\nuse of DDT for indoor residual spraying has been \r\nfound to be successful. Countries should be allowed to \r\ncontinue to use DDT, as long as it is used in \r\naccordance with international rules, guidelines and \r\nstandards. \r\n In conclusion, my delegation recognizes that the \r\nsupport of the international community is critical for \r\nthe success of Africa’s development. We will continue \r\nto work together with the international community in \r\nfulfilling the vision of a prosperous Africa free from \r\nthe burden of conflict, poverty and disease. \r\n Mr. Christian (Ghana): I commend the \r\nSecretary-General for his comprehensive reports on the \r\nimportant issues before us today. \r\n We align ourselves with the statement made by \r\nthe representative of Yemen on behalf of the Group of \r\n77 and China. \r\n Africa has made remarkable achievements in the \r\nimplementation of the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD), which represents the \r\ncollective vision for Africa’s strategic development. \r\nThe recent integration of NEPAD into the African \r\nUnion structures has generated a new momentum \r\ntowards the implementation of its priority areas. \r\n Steady progress has been made in the political, \r\neconomic and social sectors on the African continent. \r\nThe elements of good governance have been well \r\nembraced. The adoption of political pluralism, the \r\nholding of regular, free and fair elections, respect for \r\nthe rule of law and human rights, and the adoption of \r\nthe African Peer Review Mechanism by many African \r\ncountries in the past decade testify to the accountable \r\npolitical leadership and deepened democratic ethos that \r\nprevail on the continent. \r\n Between 2002 and 2007 gross domestic product \r\ngrew annually by some 6.5 per cent, the highest rate in \r\nmore than 30 years. Moderate or low levels of inflation \r\nand macroeconomic stability accompanied the growth \r\ntake-off in most countries. What was striking about this \r\nupswing was that it was broad-based and not \r\nconcentrated in just a few countries. \r\n Commendable achievements have been made in \r\nthe health and education sectors. Public health \r\nsuccesses include the elimination of river blindness and \r\nleprosy, and substantive control of the transmission of \r\npolio, Guinea worm and measles. Many African \r\ncountries have significantly reduced their AIDS \r\nprevalence rate, and a growing number of Africans \r\nliving with the virus are undergoing antiretroviral \r\ntreatment. \r\n In spite of the progress, health systems in Africa \r\nremain underfunded, understaffed and ill-equipped, and \r\nvaccination coverage is weak. Armed conflicts and \r\ndrug trafficking are still affecting our society. The \r\nworld’s economic and financial crisis has caused a \r\nreduction in export prices, remittances and foreign \r\ninvestments, and a depreciation of local currencies, as \r\nwell as an increase in Africa’s debt. Official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) is about $14 billion \r\nshort of the original Gleneagles commitment. Africa’s \r\nability to raise resources for development has therefore \r\nbeen negatively affected. \r\n ODA is very important to Africa, now more than \r\never before. Total resource flows to Africa remained \r\nless diversified than in other developing areas, and it \r\nalso has a relatively smaller share of other resource \r\nflows, such as foreign direct investment, bonds and \r\nportfolio equity, as compared to ODA. The sharp \r\nslowdown in domestic revenue combined with \r\ndeclining export revenue and remittances, as well as a \r\nloss of access to international capital markets, \r\nunderlines the critical need for more resources from the \r\ninternational community, particularly ODA. What is \r\nneeded currently in Africa is not a renewal of pledges \r\nbut the delivery of commitments made by our \r\ndevelopment partners. \r\n Africa can be resourced through the \r\nimplementation of measures to curtail illicit financial \r\nflows at all levels, enhancing disclosure practices and \r\nA/65/PV.30  \r\n \r\n10-58121 16 \r\n \r\npromoting transparency in financial information. \r\nStrengthening national and multinational efforts to \r\naddress this issue, including support and technical \r\nassistance to African countries to enhance their \r\ncapacities, is crucial. Additional measures should be \r\nimplemented to prevent the transfer abroad of stolen \r\nassets and to assist in the recovery and return of such \r\nassets to Africa, consistent with the United Nations \r\nConvention against Corruption. \r\n Africa desires to move away from aid dependency \r\nin future. This can be achieved if we can trade our way \r\nout of poverty. Fully supporting and further developing \r\na universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory, \r\nequitable and transparent multilateral trading system, by \r\nworking expeditiously towards a balanced and \r\nambitious, comprehensive Doha outcome document, \r\nwill bring benefits to Africa and contribute to enhancing \r\nits integration into the world economic system. \r\n We call on the international community to \r\nemphasize aid for trade in order to strengthen and \r\nenhance the trade capacity and competitiveness of \r\nAfrican countries so as to ensure equitable benefits \r\nfrom increased trading opportunities and to foster \r\neconomic growth. \r\n Malaria continues to take its deadly toll on \r\nAfricans, in particular vulnerable children and pregnant \r\nwomen. It also deprives us of significant resources \r\nmeant for accelerated economic development. We \r\nbelieve that together with our partners we can win the \r\nfight against malaria. We must therefore keep up that \r\nfight. \r\n Development of the continent requires shared \r\nresponsibilities. African Governments need to enhance \r\ndomestic resource mobilization as well as to pursue \r\ndeep reforms that contribute to development. \r\n In conclusion, Ghana is of the view that the way \r\nforward to meet Africa’s development needs is to take \r\ncoordinated, balanced and integrated action at all levels \r\nto attain the Millennium Development Goals in full and \r\nin a timely manner and to comprehensively address all \r\nchallenges to Africa’s development. \r\n Mr. Núñez Mosquera (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nOn 10 October our country commemorated the \r\nbeginning of the first war of independence, in 1868. \r\nThis historic event, which marked forever the course of \r\nour national history, was accompanied by one of the \r\nmost momentous acts of justice in our history: Carlos \r\nManuel de Céspedes, the father of the Cuban \r\nhomeland, set his slaves free. Independence and our \r\nAfrican heritage are therefore inextricably linked to the \r\nCuban national identity. \r\n As President Raúl Castro has stated, Africa is not \r\na legend distant in space and time — it is dignity, \r\nsacrifice, courage and endurance. \r\n Over one and a half million enslaved Africans \r\narrived in our island, coming from territories occupied \r\ntoday by many African countries, including Angola, \r\nBenin, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Congo, Côte \r\nd’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \r\nGabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, \r\nKenya, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, \r\nMozambique, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Togo and \r\nthe United Republic of Tanzania. We are therefore \r\nproud to declare that the Cuban people have directly \r\nand naturally inherited the gallantry, bravery and \r\nculture of resistance of Africa, which has been \r\nheroically fighting for centuries to overcome \r\nchallenges that still persist. \r\n The deepest internationalist convictions of the \r\nCuban Revolution have made it possible for our \r\ncountry to be always at the side of Africa, from \r\nunconditional support for the anti colonial struggles to \r\ncooperative projects in many aspects of the continent’s \r\nsocio-economic development. Over 381,000 Cuban \r\ncombatants fought selflessly to defend the integrity and \r\nsovereignty of sister African nations for almost three \r\ndecades. We returned from Africa with only the \r\nremains of our fallen comrades and the honour of \r\nhaving fulfilled our duty. \r\n Today, more than 2,400 Cubans are helping in 35 \r\nAfrican nations with the promotion of development in \r\ndiverse areas including public health, education, \r\nagriculture, sports and construction. \r\n Our country will continue to contribute human \r\ncapital and experience in its cooperation with \r\nnumerous countries of the continent. In the \r\nComprehensive Health Programme alone, around 1,120 \r\nCuban doctors and health-care technicians are working \r\nin 23 African countries, offering their services to more \r\nthan 48 million people. \r\n Today more than 2,200 young people from 45 \r\nAfrican countries are studying in our universities and \r\npolytechnic institutes; over 32,000 young people from \r\nthe continent have graduated in various specialities. \r\n A/65/PV.30\r\n \r\n17 10-58121 \r\n \r\n Cuba has always stood with Africa, and Africa \r\nwith Cuba. In the more than 50 years of the unjust and \r\ncruel blockade of Cuba, the African Governments and \r\npeoples have closed ranks 18 times in the General \r\nAssembly to stand up for the right of the Cuban people \r\nto determine their own destiny. \r\n The statements we make here are to no avail if \r\nthe African countries are then forced to spend five \r\ntimes more on shameful foreign debts than on health \r\nand education programmes. \r\n It is imperative to change the current \r\ninternational order, in which powerful multinationals \r\nstrive to control the mineral resources of the African \r\ncontinent, and in which the rich countries, with a few \r\nexceptions, fail to meet their modest official \r\ndevelopment assistance commitments and cling to an \r\nunjust patent and trade regime that hinders the \r\ndevelopment of African nations. \r\n To address Africa’s problems, it is necessary to \r\neliminate the profit-at-any-cost philosophy supporting \r\nthe current international system. \r\n Our country will continue to support the African \r\nUnion and all the regional coordination mechanisms in \r\ntheir endeavour to find their own solutions to Africa’s \r\nproblems. However, Africa also needs the firm support \r\nof the international community. And from the United \r\nNations it needs an integrated approach to solving the \r\ncontinent’s problems related to its peace, security and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n We demand for Africa not paternalism, but \r\nequality of opportunities, as part of a more just and \r\nequitable international order. That is what is needed for \r\nthe countries of Africa and the other developing \r\nnations to be able to face the challenge of working for \r\nthe well-being of our peoples. \r\n Above all, Africa needs and deserves solidarity \r\nand respect. \r\n Mr. Mwanyula (Malawi): Speaking on behalf of \r\nthe African Group, I take this opportunity to thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his reports on the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development: progress in \r\nimplementation and international support; on causes of \r\nconflict and the promotion of durable peace and \r\nsustainable development in Africa; and on the Decade \r\nto Roll Back Malaria in Developing Countries, \r\nParticularly in Africa. \r\n The African Group aligns itself with the \r\nstatement made by Yemen on behalf of the Group of 77 \r\nand China. \r\n The year 2010 has been a remarkable one for the \r\nAfrican Union and its New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) programme. It will be recalled \r\nthat extensive efforts to integrate NEPAD into the \r\nstructures and processes of the African Union finally \r\nculminated in the decision of the fourteenth African \r\nUnion summit, held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to \r\nformally establish the NEPAD Planning and \r\nCoordinating Agency as a technical body of the African \r\nUnion. \r\n As mandated by the African Union Assembly \r\ndecision, the Agency’s role as a planning unit aims at \r\nfacilitating and coordinating implementation of \r\nregional and continental programmes and mobilizing \r\nresources for the implementation of Africa’s priority \r\nprogrammes and projects. The Agency’s role in \r\nconducting and coordinating research and knowledge \r\nmanagement will create an enabling environment to \r\nachieve food security and agricultural development in \r\nthe next five years. \r\n African countries have taken huge steps to \r\nimplement the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment. The past year has witnessed progress in \r\nthe implementation of NEPAD projects in key sectors \r\nsuch as infrastructure, the Comprehensive Africa \r\nAgriculture Development Programme, education and \r\ntraining, the environment, information and \r\ncommunications technologies and science and \r\ntechnology. Equally, there has been progress in moving \r\nforward the African Peer Review Mechanism, with 30 \r\ncountries acceding and 12 countries reviewed. \r\n The just concluded High-level Plenary Meeting \r\non the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \r\nhighlighted the reality that no country in Africa is on \r\ntrack to meet all the MDG targets by 2015. In this \r\nregard, the summit called for more attention to Africa, \r\nas the continent is the only region where poverty is \r\nincreasing. \r\n This scenario is worsened by multiple crises, \r\nincluding the global financial and economic crisis, \r\nincreasing food and energy prices and the impact of \r\nclimate change. In order to mitigate and forestall the \r\nimpacts of the multiple crises, most African \r\nGovernments have been forced to divert their limited \r\nA/65/PV.30  \r\n \r\n10-58121 18 \r\n \r\nresources to short-term solutions. This has led to a \r\nreversal of the development gains. \r\n Therefore, there is an urgent need for renewed \r\ncommitments to support Africa in meeting its special \r\nneeds, in order to mitigate the multidimensional \r\nimpacts of the crises and help African countries \r\nrecover ground in their progress towards the \r\nimplementation of NEPAD and the achievement of the \r\nMDGs. In particular, development partners should \r\ndeliver on their aid commitments. According to the \r\nSecretary-General’s report on NEPAD, since 2004 \r\nAfrica has received between 32 per cent and 35 per \r\ncent of the total increase in official development \r\nassistance, well below the 50 per cent increase \r\ncommitted to in Gleneagles. Africa is likely to receive \r\nonly about $12 billion of the $25 billion increase \r\nenvisaged at Gleneagles. \r\n Although Africa produces only 4 per cent of total \r\nglobal carbon dioxide emissions, it is the region most \r\nvulnerable to global climate change and least equipped \r\nto deal with its consequences. Changes in weather \r\npatterns have a direct bearing on water availability, \r\nagricultural output and food security. As climate \r\nchange intensifies and its impacts deepen, adaptation \r\namong the communities in Africa is becoming \r\nincreasingly challenging. \r\n Due to lack of adequate financial resources, of \r\ncapacity-building and of appropriate technology, \r\nenvironmental management is a serious challenge. As a \r\nresult, the continent continues to witness \r\ndesertification, deforestation, dust storms, pollution \r\nand the loss of ecosystems caused by rapid \r\nurbanization. Africa is currently losing large swathes of \r\nforest every year. \r\n Africa suffers from a severe lack of \r\ninfrastructure. That deficit is preventing the continent \r\nfrom realizing its full potential for economic growth, \r\nglobal competitiveness and achievement of the MDGs, \r\nincluding poverty reduction. Modern infrastructure \r\nservices are largely inaccessible to the poorest. About \r\n60 per cent of the rural population in African countries \r\nis poor and unable to access health care, education and \r\ngainful employment. Therefore, there is an urgent need \r\nto scale up investments in the infrastructure, as it is \r\ncritical to economic growth and development. \r\n Improved agricultural productivity and \r\nprofitability has great potential for economic \r\ndevelopment in a rural continent. More than 90 per \r\ncent of the continent’s food supply is produced by \r\nsmallholder farmers in rural areas. Yet more than \r\n50 per cent of the food-insecure population are \r\nsmallholder farmers, in addition to the landless poor \r\nand the urban poor. \r\n To address poverty and reduce hunger across the \r\ncontinent, sustained agricultural growth is a high \r\npriority, as envisaged by the Comprehensive Africa \r\nAgriculture Development Programme. Hunger and \r\nhealth are inextricably linked to the realization of the \r\nMDGs. Malnourishment devastates children and stunts \r\ntheir potential, leading to cyclical deprivation and \r\nhunger. \r\n Africa faces challenges in meeting the health-\r\nrelated MDGs by 2015. Access to essential services, \r\nsuch as family planning, maternal health care, and \r\nmalaria and HIV prevention and treatment, remain dire. \r\nAs a result, death rates among African women from \r\ncomplications of pregnancy and childbirth are very \r\nhigh. However, the reality on the ground is a critical \r\nshortage of health workers in Africa, and weak health \r\nsystems severely underfunded due to a lack of national \r\nand international budgetary commitments. \r\n NEPAD recognizes the critical role of the private \r\nsector, both domestic and foreign-owned, as the \r\ncontinent’s engine of economic growth. \r\n Africa continues to be plagued by long-term, and \r\nin some cases interrelated, crises and violent conflicts \r\nwhich have caused immense human suffering. In light \r\nof the serious implications of conflict on several \r\naspects of the development of Africa, initiatives such \r\nas peacebuilding and post-conflict reconstruction and \r\ndevelopment have been launched on a continent-wide \r\nand regional level to address conflict issues. \r\n A central theme in the African Union/NEPAD \r\nagenda is the bringing together of the issues of peace \r\nand security, governance, constitutionalism, economic \r\ndevelopment and international partnerships. In this \r\nregard, the African Group once again reiterates the \r\nurgent need to establish a monitoring mechanism to \r\nfollow up on all commitments related to the \r\ndevelopment of Africa, as contained in the political \r\ndeclaration on Africa’s development needs review \r\nprocess and as recommended in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report. In our view, the process should be \r\nunder the aegis of the General Assembly. The \r\nimplementation of the commitments of African \r\nGovernments and their development partners would be \r\nreviewed, beginning at the Assembly’s next session. \r\n A/65/PV.30\r\n \r\n19 10-58121 \r\n \r\n Mr. O’Brien (Australia): We thank the President \r\nfor convening this joint debate on the New Partnership \r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD) and the Decade to \r\nRoll Back Malaria in Developing Countries, \r\nParticularly in Africa. I will address each item in turn. \r\n First, the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment continues to provide an important \r\nframework to address the critical challenges facing the \r\nAfrican continent. We welcome the integration of \r\nNEPAD into the structures and processes of the African \r\nUnion. This represents a new era for NEPAD in the \r\nimplementation of its priorities for the attainment of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\n The Australian Government is pleased to be \r\nsupporting Africa’s own efforts to achieve the MDGs \r\nby 2015. We have doubled our overseas development \r\nassistance to Africa over the last three years, and on \r\ncurrent projections our development budget will double \r\nagain by 2015. In this, we have aligned our efforts with \r\nthose of African Governments, institutions, multilateral \r\npartners and other donors, in order to ensure the \r\neffectiveness of our increased cooperation with Africa. \r\n Australia’s four-year $100 million food security \r\nprogramme in Africa is being implemented in \r\npartnership with key regional organizations under \r\nNEPAD’s Comprehensive Africa Agriculture \r\nDevelopment Program (CAADP). Australia recognizes \r\nthat CAADP represents a key mechanism for \r\nimplementing the L’Aquila principles on global food \r\nsecurity, and sees NEPAD as an important tool for \r\nmoving it forward. \r\n In dealing with water and sanitation — another \r\nkey NEPAD priority area — Australia’s efforts are \r\naligned with African-owned and -driven priorities, \r\nespecially achievement of the Africa Water Vision \r\n2025. \r\n Australia is also strengthening its partnership \r\nwith the African Union more broadly. Last month, we \r\nwere pleased to sign a memorandum of understanding \r\nwith the African Union Commission which should \r\nserve to strengthen coordination and cooperation in \r\nareas of mutual interest in Africa. By way of \r\nillustration, Australia will work closely with the \r\nAfrican Union Commission as part of our $140 million \r\nprogramme to support maternal and child health in \r\nEastern Africa, in recognition of the Commission’s \r\nunique role in continent-wide advocacy on those \r\nissues. \r\n Australia shares the Secretary-General’s \r\nfrustration with the lack of progress being made in the \r\nDoha Round of trade negotiations. Australia is \r\npursuing an outcome that is good for development, \r\ngood for agricultural trade reform and good for the \r\nmultilateral trading regime. Such an outcome in the \r\nDoha Round, together with effective aid-for-trade \r\nactivities in the region, will help Africa to trade its way \r\nout of poverty. \r\n As Foreign Minister Rudd said during the \r\nMillennium Development Goals summit last month, \r\ndonor countries need to do what we say we will to \r\nhonour our commitments. That is what Australia seeks \r\nto do. Thus we look forward to discussing with other \r\nMember States the Secretary-General’s suggestion for \r\nan improved monitoring mechanism of the \r\ncommitments to Africa’s development, to strengthen \r\nthe sense of partnership and mutual accountability that \r\nshould exist between donor and recipient Member \r\nStates. \r\n I turn now to the Decade to Roll Back Malaria in \r\nDeveloping Countries. As we near the end of the \r\nDecade, the disease continues to have a serious \r\neconomic and human impact across the globe. Malaria \r\nfuels the cycle of poverty, afflicting primarily the poor \r\nand most vulnerable. It is an unacceptable tragedy that \r\nmalaria remains a major killer of African children. \r\n We can draw some encouragement from the \r\nprogress that has been made in combating the disease \r\nand by the results that we are beginning to see. The \r\nreduction in malaria cases and deaths in those high-\r\nburden African countries that have achieved high \r\ncoverage of their populations with bednets and \r\ntreatment programmes demonstrates that we know \r\nwhat is needed to combat this disease. Our efforts, \r\nhowever, must continue. \r\n The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and \r\nMalaria is a critical player in combating malaria in \r\ndeveloping countries. Last week, Australia announced \r\nits commitment of $210 million over three years to \r\nsupport the critical work of the Global Fund. That \r\ncommitment represents a 55 per cent increase over \r\nAustralia’s last three-year pledge to the Global Fund \r\nand demonstrates our commitment to supporting global \r\nefforts to build on the successes of the past decade and \r\nto reverse the incidence of malaria worldwide.  \r\n Australia’s bilateral programmes complement our \r\nsupport to the Global Fund. Australia is playing a \r\nA/65/PV.30  \r\n \r\n10-58121 20 \r\n \r\nleading role in reducing the malaria burden in the Asia-\r\nPacific region, where around 62 per cent of malaria \r\ncases outside of Africa occur. \r\n Through the Pacific Malaria Initiative, Australia \r\nis providing targeted technical and management \r\nsupport to assist Governments to implement their \r\nnational malaria action plans. This initiative is already \r\nmaking impressive progress. In Solomon Islands, the \r\nincidence of malaria has been reduced from 199 cases \r\nper 1,000 people in 2003 to 77 cases per 1,000 in 2009; \r\nwhile in Vanuatu the rate has fallen from 74 to 15 cases \r\nper 1,000. The initiative has highlighted the importance \r\nof working within partner Government systems, of \r\nstrong political leadership and of providing appropriate \r\ntechnical expertise. Australia will continue to support \r\nmalaria control in the Asia-Pacific region and globally. \r\nWe aim to build on successes so far and to achieve the \r\ngoals set for us in MDG 6 by 2015. \r\n Mrs. Pessôa (Brazil): I wish to thank you, \r\nMr. President, for convening this joint debate on the \r\nimplementation of and international support to the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) and \r\nthe Decade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing \r\nCountries. I take this opportunity to convey our sincere \r\nappreciation for the quality of all the reports and notes \r\npresented by the Secretary-General for both items \r\nunder our consideration today (A/65/152, A/65/165, \r\nA/65/167, A/65/62, A/62/Add.1 and A/65/210). \r\n Brazil aligns itself with the statement delivered \r\nby the representative of Yemen on behalf of the Group \r\nof 77 and China. \r\n Brazil has supported NEPAD as an example of an \r\nAfrican-owned and -driven initiative. The high priority \r\nwe attribute to NEPAD is reflected in a wide range of \r\ntechnical cooperation projects implemented in \r\npartnership with various African countries. Our \r\ncooperation projects are always aimed at transferring \r\nskills, building local capacity and empowering local \r\nworkers, with the full engagement and ownership of \r\nAfrican Governments. \r\n In 2009, Brazilian cooperation projects in Africa \r\nrepresented 51 per cent of our overall investments in \r\ntechnical cooperation with other developing countries. \r\nInitiatives implemented in partnership with \r\nPortuguese-speaking countries alone represented \r\n63 per cent of that total. The wide variety of areas of \r\ntechnical cooperation with Africa encompasses projects \r\nin areas such as education, agriculture and livestock \r\nhusbandry, science, energy and health. Currently, \r\nBrazil partners with African countries on 117 projects. \r\n Our cooperation with Africa is consistent with \r\nNEPAD’s focus on agriculture as a means to generate \r\nwealth and eradicate poverty. The Brazilian Agricultural \r\nResearch Corporation — a State company — recently \r\nestablished an office in Accra, with a view to supporting \r\nthe technological and productive improvement of the \r\nAfrican savannah. It is the most comprehensive \r\ncollection of data on tropical agriculture and has \r\nprovided assistance to over 30 countries in the region. \r\n Projects aimed at improving local capacity in \r\nlivestock husbandry are being carried out together with \r\nCape Verde, Senegal and Zambia. Initiatives to \r\nimprove family farming and rural professional training \r\nare under way in Angola, Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, \r\nLiberia, Mozambique and Nigeria. Also in the field of \r\nagriculture training, the Brazilian Cooperation Agency \r\noffers a programme, open to all African countries, that \r\nis structured around three major areas, namely, public \r\nagricultural policies, agricultural research and training \r\nof local producers. \r\n Mr. Kleib (Indonesia), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n Brazil has been a steadfast advocate for an early, \r\ndevelopment-geared conclusion of the Doha Round. \r\nNo other economic sector is more central to sustainable \r\ndevelopment than agriculture. In the framework of the \r\nRound, Brazil has decided to unilaterally grant duty-\r\nfree and quota-free access for exports from least \r\ndeveloped countries, two thirds of which are in Africa. \r\nFurthermore, in order to increase the access of African \r\nproducers to the cotton chain, raise the income of \r\nfarmers and favour the expansion of job offers, Brazil \r\nhas engaged in technology-transfer projects with the \r\n“cotton 4” countries — namely, Benin, Burkina Faso, \r\nChad and Mali. \r\n We have also been working to strengthen regional \r\npolitical dialogue, with a view to broadening the scope \r\nand number of developing partners. In that sense, the \r\nAfrica-South America Summit constitutes a good \r\nexample of innovative platforms for increased dialogue \r\nand cooperation. In the past six years, trade across the \r\ntwo regions has increased from $6 to $36 billion, thus \r\ncontributing to the development of both South America \r\nand Africa. \r\n A/65/PV.30\r\n \r\n21 10-58121 \r\n \r\n Interregional dialogue has also resulted in \r\nimproved cooperation on infrastructure, one of the key \r\nareas of NEPAD. The Declaration of Nueva Esparta, \r\nsigned in September 2009, encourages the exchange of \r\nexperiences and initiatives in the area of infrastructure \r\nbetween South American agencies — such as the \r\nInitiative for the Integration of Regional Infrastructure \r\nin South America and the Board of Infrastructure and \r\nPlanning of the Union of South American Nations and \r\nNEPAD. \r\n The implications of health for the overall efforts \r\nto promote development are clear and have been \r\nreaffirmed in a number of internationally agreed \r\ndocuments, such as the Millennium Declaration \r\n(resolution 55/2). NEPAD rightly recognizes the close \r\nlinks among health, poverty, social exclusion, \r\nmarginalization and environmental degradation in \r\nAfrica. Brazil fully agrees with the basic principle of \r\nNEPAD’s health strategy, namely, that preventable and \r\ntreatable diseases not only cause unnecessary deaths \r\nand untold suffering, but also represent significant \r\nexpenditures of national resources, which further \r\nhampers economic and social development. \r\n Brazilian cooperation initiatives therefore attach \r\ngreat importance to creating and developing capacities \r\nin the area of health. We are currently partnering with \r\nMozambique to develop a pharmaceutical facility to \r\nproduce antiretroviral drugs to be used in various \r\nAfrican countries. Other projects are being \r\nimplemented in countries such as Liberia, Burkina \r\nFaso, Botswana, Ghana and Zambia in order to support \r\nthe improvement of national health systems. \r\n The Brazilian Government is deeply committed \r\nto the international fight against malaria. Our \r\nengagement is manifested through both bilateral \r\ncooperation and participation in multilateral efforts. \r\nOur active participation in the Roll Back Malaria \r\nPartnership, the international drug-purchasing facility \r\nUNITAID, and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \r\nTuberculosis and Malaria reflects that commitment. \r\n The international community has made \r\nremarkable progress in the past few years in the pursuit \r\nof the goals of achieving universal coverage for \r\nmalaria prevention and treatment by 2010 and reducing \r\nglobal malaria deaths to near zero preventable deaths \r\nby 2015. In addition to expanding the use of \r\ninsecticide-treated nets, it is imperative that national \r\nGovernments and the international community put in \r\nplace mechanisms to ensure universal access to free or \r\naffordable medicines for the treatment of malaria for \r\nthose who are already affected. \r\n As in many other regions of the world, cases of \r\nmalaria infections in Brazil are associated with the \r\nprocess of colonization. Today, the largest numbers of \r\nnew infections are found in cities. However, in our \r\nnational experience, it is possible to reduce the number \r\nof cases by expanding health services and integrating \r\ncontrol and care activities. \r\n The Brazilian Government is committed to \r\nfurther strengthening the prevention and control of the \r\ninfection in order to maintain a sustained reduction in \r\ncases of infection, especially in the most vulnerable \r\ncities. To that end, we have launched a national \r\nprogramme for malaria control. With resources granted \r\nby the Global Fund, the programme aims at reducing \r\nby 50 per cent the number of cases of malaria in the 47 \r\nmunicipalities that are responsible for 70 per cent of \r\nthe infections recorded in Brazil. \r\n As one of the countries afflicted by the disease, \r\nBrazil is determined to work with the international \r\ncommunity and other developing countries, especially \r\nin Africa, in order to free the world of the scourge of \r\nmalaria. \r\n Mr. Benmehidi (Algeria) (spoke in French): This \r\ndebate on the implementation of the New Partnership \r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD) and the \r\ninternational support it has received is taking place at a \r\ntime marked by the ongoing economic and social \r\ncrisis, whose effects continue to be most pronounced in \r\nthe poorest countries, especially in Africa, despite the \r\nemergence of some encouraging signs of resumed \r\neconomic growth. This meeting is also being held on \r\nthe heels of the General Assembly’s High-level Plenary \r\nMeeting on progress in achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, which provided an opportunity to \r\nhighlight the problems and challenges facing African \r\ncountries and the sorts of steps needed to integrate \r\nthem into the world economy. \r\n Algeria, one of the countries that contributed to \r\npromoting the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment, would like to emphasize the importance \r\nof this innovative mechanism, which provides an \r\nappropriate framework for developing partnerships \r\nbased on a new approach to cooperation and \r\ndevelopment in Africa. \r\nA/65/PV.30  \r\n \r\n10-58121 22 \r\n \r\n NEPAD is both an integrated strategy and a \r\ndevelopment framework that incorporates Africa’s \r\ncommitment to undertake effective leadership in taking \r\ncontrol of its destiny and all aspects of its development \r\nprocess, with the ultimate goal of consolidating good \r\ngovernance, peace and security and regional and \r\ncontinent-wide integration. Policies in that framework \r\nare focused on priority issues like macroeconomic \r\nstability, the establishment of basic infrastructure, the \r\npromotion of human development and information and \r\ncommunications technologies, and combating \r\npandemic diseases. \r\n Africa is a major economic development hub that \r\nis increasingly considered as a new area for investment \r\nand global economic growth. That is due both to the \r\ncontinent’s substantial natural resources and to the \r\nprogress made in economic governance as a result of \r\nmajor efforts to reform monetary, budgetary and \r\nfinancial policies and of the macroeconomic stability \r\nenjoyed by many African countries. Consequently, \r\nAfrica should no longer remain on the sidelines of \r\ninternational decision-making processes or be content \r\nto passively endure the adverse consequences. \r\n As part of its institutional process to implement \r\nNEPAD, the African Union has put in place a Planning \r\nand Coordinating Agency to replace the NEPAD \r\nsecretariat, thereby signalling the effective transition \r\nfrom the awareness-raising stage to those of carrying \r\nout regional and continent-wide projects and of \r\nintegrating NEPAD into the Union’s structures. That \r\nintegration-based approach can ensure greater \r\neffectiveness in taking responsibility for programmes \r\nand activities and in encouraging our development \r\npartners to fully honour their commitments with regard \r\nto the implementation of NEPAD. \r\n NEPAD as an African strategy for sustainable \r\ndevelopment and the Peer Review Mechanism \r\nestablished by it to strengthen good governance and the \r\nrule of law in the continent are major assets in the \r\nannals of Africa’s substantial achievements. The Peer \r\nReview Mechanism is continuing to strengthen its \r\nposition as a tool to promote good governance in \r\nAfrica. More than 30 African countries have adhered to \r\nit to date, and 14 have been examined. Algeria was \r\namong the first African countries to voluntarily submit \r\nitself to the Peer Review Mechanism, reflecting our \r\ndesire to enshrine good governance in all areas. \r\n Also, in spite of the gaps and obstacles yet to be \r\novercome, Africa is today in a position submit a very \r\nrespectable report on the results it has achieved in the \r\nvarious priority areas. \r\n Key sectors such as agriculture, the environment, \r\nbasic infrastructure and information and \r\ntelecommunication technologies are now the subject of \r\nongoing attention in Africa. Projects in those areas \r\nrequire significant financing, which African economies \r\ncan only partially mobilize. Infrastructure investment \r\nneeds in Africa amount to $93 billion annually, while \r\nthe continent is only able to devote $45 billion a year \r\nto them. \r\n The fight against pandemic diseases is among the \r\npriorities of African leaders and has been integrated \r\ninto NEPAD strategies. Malaria continues to kill nearly \r\n1 million Africans every year. It also affects millions of \r\npeople, most of them pregnant women and young \r\nchildren. In addition, the costs in terms of investment \r\nlosses amount to some $12 billion. Algeria welcomes \r\nthe initiative by some African countries to launch the \r\nAfrican Leaders Malaria Alliance, which is intended to \r\ncomplement efforts to combat that disease at the \r\nhighest level of international, national and local \r\npolicies and strategies. Its success will depend upon \r\nthe degree of involvement of African countries in \r\nimplementing it, but above all on the type of assistance \r\nto be provided by development partners. \r\n In addition, significant progress has been made in \r\nimplementing the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture \r\nDevelopment Programme, thanks to the fact that many \r\ncountries have honoured their commitment to devote \r\n10 per cent of their budgets to agriculture. \r\n Moreover, the information and telecommunications \r\ntechnologies action plan for Africa was firmly supported \r\nat the African Union Summit held in Kampala in 2010. \r\n The support of the international community to \r\nAfrican countries nevertheless continues to be \r\ninsufficient, especially in view of the marked \r\nbackwardness resulting from the continent’s long \r\nmarginalization from the world economy and the major \r\nchallenges to be overcome in the various sectors. My \r\ndelegation is convinced that relaunching sustained \r\neconomic growth on the African continent will depend \r\nupon the implementation of a strengthened partnership \r\nwith development partners in which the reforms \r\nundertaken by African countries are matched by \r\nsustained support from developed countries. \r\n A/65/PV.30\r\n \r\n23 10-58121 \r\n \r\n Developed countries must take concrete steps to \r\nrelaunch African economies. Such steps include \r\nfacilitating access to their markets, especially for \r\nagricultural products, so as to increase Africa’s \r\nparticipation in world trade. They must also honour \r\ntheir commitments with regard to official development \r\nassistance (ODA), especially with regard to devoting \r\n0.7 per cent of gross national product to ODA, as well \r\nas commitments made in more restricted forums such \r\nas the Group of Eight. \r\n Other measures by developed countries should \r\ninclude encouraging more foreign direct investment \r\nflows to African countries with a view to relaunching \r\neconomic growth, creating jobs and contributing to \r\npoverty reduction. There should be debt relief or \r\ncancellation for least developed African countries. \r\n In conclusion, Algeria would like to express its \r\nappreciation for the contributions and commitment \r\nshown by numerous partners, which have made it \r\npossible to make progress in the areas of good \r\ngovernance and sustainable development. We call for \r\ngreater such efforts. \r\n Mr. Reuben (Israel): At the outset, Israel would \r\nlike to congratulate the President on his election. We \r\nlook forward to his successful stewardship of the work \r\nof the General Assembly. I would also like to thank \r\nhim for convening this important debate. \r\n Israel welcomes the Secretary-General’s eighth \r\nconsolidated progress report on the New Partnership \r\nfor Africa’s Development (A/65/167). The report raises \r\nimportant issues and highlights significant projects that \r\nare positively affecting the development trajectory of \r\nAfrican countries. In the wake of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals summit, today’s debate offers new \r\nopportunities to home in on the development \r\nchallenges unique to African countries and to recommit \r\nourselves to programmes that will be successful in the \r\nregion. \r\n Israel has long-standing ties to Africa. In fact, \r\nTheodor Herzl, the father of Zionism, wrote in his \r\n1902 book Altneuland, “once I have witnessed the \r\nredemption of the Jews, my people, I wish also to \r\nassist in the redemption of the Africans”. Many of our \r\nstrong cooperative relationships in the region began in \r\n1958 during an historic visit to the newly independent \r\nStates of Africa by Golda Meir, Israel’s Foreign \r\nMinister at the time. Recently, Foreign Minister \r\nAvigdor Liberman visited a number of African \r\ncountries as part of a drive to deepen Israel’s \r\ncommitment to development on the continent. \r\n Israel’s international development agency, \r\nMASHAV, is at the heart of our development efforts in \r\nAfrica. MASHAV works closely with many partners on \r\nthe continent in areas such as sustainable development, \r\npublic health, food security, education and gender \r\nequality, while placing significant focus on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. Allow me to share \r\nwith the Assembly some of Israel’s development efforts \r\non the continent. \r\n Israel is providing its significant expertise in the \r\narea of agriculture to partner with African countries to \r\nfight hunger and extreme poverty. As an arid country \r\nwith a climate similar to many regions in Africa, Israel \r\ncontinues to offer lessons learned during its own \r\ndevelopment through a number of programmes and \r\npartnerships. One such venture, the Techno-agricultural \r\nInnovation for Poverty Alleviation, trains farmers in \r\nthe use of simple and inexpensive techniques, such as \r\ncrop rotation and drip irrigation, in order to maximize \r\noutput on formerly overused or arid land. \r\n In addition, Israel recently launched a trilateral \r\npartnership with the Governments of Germany and \r\nEthiopia to assist Ethiopian farmers to adopt advanced \r\nagricultural practices, which will help to ensure \r\nsustainable development and improve food security. \r\nThat trilateral collaboration highlights the significant \r\nvalue of diversifying partnerships. \r\n In implementing its co-sponsored biennial \r\nresolution entitled “Agricultural Technology for \r\nDevelopment”, Israel has been working to further \r\ndevelop and expand such partnerships. The resolution \r\ncalls upon Member States to cooperate and collaborate \r\nto develop and implement sustainable agricultural \r\ntechnologies as a means to combat poverty and hunger \r\nand to ensure better production and safer land use. In \r\npursuing the call of the resolution, Israel has been \r\nworking to ensure that agricultural technologies reach \r\nareas where they can have the greatest development \r\nimpact. \r\n Empowering women in Africa is essential for \r\nachieving a model of truly sustainable development. \r\nIsrael is engaged in a number of efforts to that end. We \r\nare promoting women’s entrepreneurship in small-scale \r\nagriculture by providing specialized courses for women \r\nacross the continent and by improving education \r\nthrough teacher-training programmes. \r\nA/65/PV.30  \r\n \r\n10-58121 24 \r\n \r\n Israel is also working to empower women by \r\nimproving prenatal and neonatal care through a \r\nconcept known as tipat chalav, which means “drop of \r\nmilk” in Hebrew. Currently being implemented in \r\nKumasi, Ghana, the tipat chalav model includes the \r\nuse of community-based prenatal and healthy-baby \r\nclinics staffed primarily by public health nurses. This \r\nmodel has demonstrated dramatic improvements in \r\nhealth, including reductions in the rates of infant and \r\nmaternal mortality. \r\n In the area of health, Israel is also closely \r\nengaged in the fight to combat HIV/AIDS in Africa. \r\nIsrael’s role in that effort includes training health-care \r\nprofessionals in treating HIV and managing \r\neducational programmes to promote sexual health \r\namong adolescents, who are at the greatest risk of \r\ncontracting the disease. \r\n Israel recognizes the need to devote further \r\nattention to these matters moving forward. To that end, \r\nIsrael is marking International Development Day by \r\norganizing a round-table discussion on the challenges \r\nof development. \r\n The challenges before us are great, but Israel \r\nremains deeply committed to collaborating with other \r\nnations to achieve the Millennium Development Goals \r\nin Africa. Israel recognizes that pursuing the Goals will \r\nnot only bring enhanced peace and security for all, but \r\nwill also affirm the timeless value of tikkun olam, a \r\nJewish principle that mandates us to repair the world, \r\nto help those in need and to better the lives of those \r\naround the globe. \r\n Mr. Charan Das Mahant (India): I am honoured \r\nto speak on behalf of India at today’s joint debate on the \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). \r\nLet me begin by thanking the Secretary-General for his \r\nreports on the items under discussion (A/65/152, \r\nA/65/165), including the eighth consolidated progress \r\nreport on implementation and international support for \r\nNEPAD (A/65/167). \r\n We align ourselves with the statement delivered \r\nby the representative of Yemen on behalf of the Group \r\nof 77 and China. \r\n The New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\narticulates both a vision and a strategic socio-economic \r\ndevelopment framework for Africa. It reflects the \r\ncommitment of African countries to undertake their \r\nown development programmes and the commitment of \r\nthe international community to support those efforts. \r\n India applauds the progress achieved by African \r\ncountries in the implementation of the NEPAD \r\npriorities through the various multisectoral initiatives. \r\nWe further welcome the integration of the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development into the \r\nstructures and processes of the African Union through, \r\ninter alia, the establishment of the NEPAD Planning \r\nand Coordinating Agency as a technical body of the \r\nAfrican Union. \r\n Despite those positive developments, serious \r\nchallenges remain to be addressed before the African \r\ncontinent can achieve sustainable peace and prosperity. \r\nMost African countries remain off track with respect to \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). Conflict, poverty, lack of adequate nutrition \r\nand other malaises continue to shackle the tremendous \r\npotential of the African people. \r\n It is universally acknowledged that addressing \r\nAfrica’s development needs and challenges requires \r\nunwavering commitment and resolute action not only \r\nfrom within Africa, but, equally important, from \r\noutside the continent by its partners. That must take \r\nplace through sustained cooperation that includes the \r\ntransfer of resources and technology and an enabling \r\ninternational environment. The role of the international \r\ncommunity in Africa’s development is indispensable \r\nand crucial. \r\n That is recognized in a number of multilateral \r\nand bilateral initiatives directed at Africa. It is also \r\nrecognized in a number of international conferences \r\nand summits, including the General Assembly’s recent \r\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals that brought into sharp focus the \r\nspecial needs of Africa and the urgency of galvanizing \r\ninternational efforts. It is further articulated in a \r\nnumber of declarations, resolutions and plans of action \r\nin support of Africa to which the international \r\ncommunity has pledged adherence. \r\n In spite of the commitments and initiatives, there \r\nis a gap between promise and delivery on the part of \r\nthe international community that needs to be addressed \r\non a priority basis. \r\n First and foremost, NEPAD can succeed only if \r\nthe global partnership delivers in terms of resources. \r\nThe picture on the ground is not inspiring. It is \r\n A/65/PV.30\r\n \r\n25 10-58121 \r\n \r\nestimated that official development assistance to Africa \r\nreached $44 billion in 2009. That leaves a shortfall of \r\n$16 billion relative to the target set by the Group of \r\nEight at the Gleneagles summit in 2005. We would like \r\nto stress the importance of the urgent fulfilment of the \r\ncommitments made by the G-8 in 2005. \r\n India’s own links with Africa go back a long way \r\nand are anchored in a history of contact and friendship \r\nof civilizations across the Indian Ocean. Our friendship \r\nand cooperation have been further strengthened \r\nthrough a common journey of anti colonial struggle \r\nand post-colonial nation-building. \r\n Today, our long and historic relationship has \r\nevolved into a sustainable and enduring partnership \r\nthat embraces the entire spectrum of human \r\nengagement. In the economic realm, it translates into a \r\nvibrant economic partnership that covers, inter alia, \r\ninfrastructure development, capacity-building, \r\nagriculture, health, food security, development of \r\nsmall- and medium-sized enterprises, and information \r\nand communications technology. \r\n India has so far extended over $3 billion in \r\nconcessional lines of credit to countries in Africa. They \r\nhave been used in projects as prioritized by the African \r\ncountries themselves. During the India-Africa Forum \r\nSummit held in April 2008 in New Delhi, India decided \r\nto extend additional lines of credit of $5.4 billion over \r\nthe next five years, including an allocation of  \r\n$300 million to be utilized by the African Union in \r\nsupport of NEPAD objectives. That line of credit is in \r\naddition to the $200 million line of credit extended to \r\nNEPAD in 2002, most of which stands utilized. \r\n At the same time, India proposed to undertake \r\nprojects against grants in excess of $500 million over \r\nthe next five to six years. They are being implemented \r\nin consultation with our African partners. India is also \r\nunilaterally making available duty-free and quota-free \r\nmarket access for goods from 34 least developed \r\ncountries (LDCs) in Africa. That covers 94 per cent of \r\nIndia’s total tariff lines and provides preferential \r\nmarket access on tariff lines that comprise 92.5 per \r\ncent of global exports of all LDCs. \r\n The Pan African e-Network Project is another far-\r\nreaching initiative undertaken by India in Africa. It \r\naims at sharing our expertise in health care and \r\neducation. It symbolizes India’s commitment to \r\ntransferring skills and technology to Africa by bridging \r\nthe digital divide within the framework of South-South \r\ncooperation. It will connect 53 African countries into \r\none network through satellites, fibre optics and \r\nwireless links to provide tele-education, tele-medicine \r\nand voice and video conference facilities. We expect \r\nthe project to bring major benefits to Africa in \r\ncapacity-building. \r\n India has also been at the forefront of \r\ncontributing to Africa’s human resource development \r\nefforts. The Indian Technical and Economic \r\nCooperation Programme has benefited thousands of \r\nexperts and students from Africa who have been \r\ncoming to India since 1964 for training courses at \r\nprofessional institutions. Apart from providing experts, \r\nwe are also providing training to African personnel in \r\ndiverse fields, such as agriculture and agro-processing, \r\nentrepreneurship development, tool design, small \r\nbusiness creation, the promotion of rural industries and \r\ninformation technology. In addition, several thousand \r\nAfrican students are currently studying in Indian \r\nuniversities and colleges. \r\n The President returned to the Chair. \r\n Through our long-term involvement in \r\npeacekeeping efforts on the continent over the past six \r\ndecades, India has also been a steadfast contributor to \r\nthe maintenance of peace and security in conflict-torn \r\nregions of Africa. Presently, India has over 7,000 \r\npeacekeepers serving in Africa, including a 4,000-\r\nstrong contingent in the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo. India’s first all-female police unit serves with \r\ndistinction in Liberia. It has earned laurels for its \r\npioneering role in this regard which, in addition to \r\nnormal peacekeeping, has included their successful \r\noutreach to vulnerable sections of society, particularly \r\nwomen and children. \r\n India is steadfastly committed to the peace, \r\nstability and socio economic development of Africa. \r\nIndia and Africa are joined together in a common quest \r\nfor sustainable economic growth and development. The \r\nDelhi Declaration and the Africa-India Framework for \r\nCooperation, which was adopted during the landmark \r\nIndia-Africa Forum Summit held in Delhi in April \r\n2008, contain a blueprint for further intensifying the \r\nengagement between India and Africa. We will \r\ncontinue to accord the highest priority to furthering our \r\nmultidimensional partnership with Africa, which \r\nencompasses priority sectors integral to the \r\ndevelopmental goals of Africa. \r\nA/65/PV.30  \r\n \r\n10-58121 26 \r\n \r\n Mr. Iziraren (Morocco) (spoke in French): I am \r\npleased to take part in these discussions on \r\ndevelopment in the African continent, and I thank the \r\nSecretary-General for the quality of his reports on the \r\nsubject (A/65/152, A/65/165 and A/65/167). \r\n My delegation associates itself with the \r\nstatements made by the representative of Yemen on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China and by the \r\nrepresentative of Malawi on behalf of the African \r\nGroup. \r\n The countries of Africa have shown genuine will \r\nand have established bold policies leading to real gains \r\nin solidifying democratic progress and the realization \r\nof development goals. That will and those policies \r\nhave nevertheless come face to face with the several \r\ncrises that have arisen in recent years. African \r\ncountries have been unable to mobilize the necessary \r\nresources to carry out the reform that has been started. \r\nWhat is more, delivery on the pledges made by their \r\ndevelopment partners has considerably dipped at the \r\nvery moment when Africa especially needs continued \r\ninternational assistance. Much of what has been \r\nachieved towards the realization of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) has thus been set back by \r\nthe immediate effects of the various crises and by \r\ndiminished aid from partners. In addition to those \r\nchallenges we must also add climate change, which \r\nwill certainly affect the development prospects of the \r\ncontinent. \r\n The economic difficulties brought on by the \r\nfinancial crisis have adversely affected African \r\neconomies and significantly limited their ability to \r\nfinance their development. Mean economic growth \r\nrates in Africa in 2008 and 2009 — 4.5 per cent and \r\n1.6 per cent respectively — and the estimated 2010 \r\nrate of 4.3 per cent are still well below the 7 per cent \r\nconsidered necessary for African nations to achieve \r\ntheir development goals. Moreover, financial flows to \r\nthe continent, whether official development assistance \r\nor foreign direct investment, have not reached the level \r\nnecessary to sustain the efforts of African countries or \r\nto meet their development needs. \r\n In terms of official development assistance, it \r\nshould be noted that the economic report on Africa for \r\n2010 emphasizes that aid to Africa, which grew by \r\nonly 11 per cent in 2008, could experience a decrease \r\nin 2010, and that anticipated reduction in aid flow \r\nendangers the achievement of the MDGs in the poor \r\ncountries of the continent. \r\n Africa has also been among the continents most \r\naffected by retrenchment in foreign direct investment, \r\nwith a reduction of 35 per cent from 2008 to 2009. It is \r\nnot by chance, then, that Africa, which receives only \r\nabout 2 per cent of total foreign direct investment, lags \r\nbehind in achieving the MDGs. Establishing an \r\nenvironment conducive to investment and \r\nentrepreneurship in Africa is therefore critical. To \r\npromote investment on the continent, where the need to \r\nfight poverty is overwhelming, Morocco proposes the \r\nconvening, in the framework of the General Assembly, \r\nof a high-level meeting on investment in Africa. \r\n Any delay in concluding the Doha Round trade \r\nagreements can only penalize African economies, \r\nwhose participation in international trade hardly \r\nexceeded 3.2 per cent in 2008. Putting in place a \r\nmultilateral trading system that honours the centrality \r\nof development and is more favourable to African \r\ncountries is of vital importance. Improving access to \r\nmarkets for African countries, while necessary, is \r\nnonetheless insufficient. Any progress in market access \r\nmust be accompanied by aid focused on strengthening \r\nAfrican countries’ capacity for both production and \r\ntrade. \r\n Moreover, Africa, whose contribution to \r\ngreenhouse gas emissions is negligible — barely over  \r\n4 per cent — is highly vulnerable to the effects of \r\nclimate change. Agriculture, the driving force of most \r\nAfrican economies, making up around 50 per cent of \r\nthe continent’s exports and 21 per cent of its gross \r\ndomestic product, is especially vulnerable to climate \r\nchange. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \r\nChange has projected a 50 per cent reduction in rain-\r\nfed agriculture in Africa, very likely provoking serious \r\nsocio economic tensions in the countries of the \r\ncontinent. In that regard, the international community \r\nis clearly called on to redouble its efforts to make \r\navailable to Africa the means necessary to adapt to \r\nclimate change and to attenuate its social and economic \r\nimpact. \r\n The outcome document of the Meeting on the \r\nMDGs (resolution 65/1) underlined that Africa should \r\nreceive greater attention. It also constituted a call for \r\nthe pledges of aid made to the continent to be \r\nhonoured, inasmuch as assistance is currently not at the \r\nlevels that have been pledged. Given these \r\n A/65/PV.30\r\n \r\n27 10-58121 \r\n \r\ncircumstances, it is of the utmost urgency for \r\ndevelopment partners to honour their commitments to \r\nAfrica on official development assistance, starting with \r\nthe pledges made at the Gleneagles Summit. \r\n Morocco welcomes the Muskoka Initiative, which \r\nwas launched by the Group of Eight to accelerate \r\nprogress in attaining the Millennium Goals on infant \r\nmortality and maternal health in the next five years. We \r\nbelieve that implementing the Initiative is of the \r\nhighest importance. \r\n While the economic crisis should not be an \r\nexcuse for not honouring pledges for African \r\ndevelopment, new instruments of international aid \r\nshould receive careful attention. The search for \r\ninnovative financing, which has proven very \r\npromising, would allow us to supplement traditional \r\nfinancing. Innovative initiatives undertaken thus far \r\nhave proven ever more successful, encouraging more \r\nexploration. Ensuring regular and efficient delivery of \r\nthe commitments made to Africa is of critical \r\nimportance so as to allow the continent to achieve its \r\ndevelopment objectives. \r\n In that regard, Morocco thanks the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report on a monitoring mechanism to \r\nreview commitments towards Africa’s development \r\nneeds (A/65/165). The report informs us of important \r\naspects of follow up on pledges of aid to the continent \r\nand also contains incisive proposals for an improved \r\nfollow up mechanism that would allow us to better \r\nevaluate the effectiveness of development aid to \r\nAfrica. \r\n His Majesty Mohammed VI, King of Morocco, in \r\nhis speech at the Millennium Development Goals \r\nsummit held on 20 and 21 September, underlined that \r\nMorocco had “made human development and the \r\nachievement of the MDGs the core of a practical, \r\ninnovative South-South cooperation policy, especially \r\nwith regard to sister African nations” (A/65/PV.4, p. 6). \r\n Human development is one of the key thrusts of \r\nMorocco’s cooperation with its African partners, by \r\nwhich we have established and carried out specific \r\nprojects in areas with a direct bearing on the \r\nachievement of the MDGs, such as health, drinking \r\nwater, agriculture and irrigation techniques, fisheries, \r\nfood security, combating locusts, infrastructure, \r\ntraining, transport and housing. The private sector in \r\nMorocco also promotes such cooperation through the \r\ninvestment and expertise that it brings, making an \r\nenormous contribution to the ongoing economic \r\nimpact. \r\n In terms of training, more than 9,000 foreign \r\nstudents from 73 countries, including 37 African \r\nnations, are now studying in Morocco in public post-\r\nsecondary, technical and vocational institutions. More \r\nthan 80 per cent of those students receive scholarships \r\nfrom the Moroccan Government. \r\n With respect to promoting trade within Africa, \r\nMorocco, under a royal decree of 2000, has taken the \r\ndecision to open its national markets to exports from \r\nAfrica’s least developed countries, free of excise duties \r\nand restrictions. That decision has had a positive \r\nimpact on exports from such countries to Morocco. \r\nAlso thanks to royal directives, Morocco has forgiven \r\nthe bilateral debt of a number of African countries on \r\nseveral occasions. Emergency humanitarian aid is \r\nanother priority for His Majesty the King, who has \r\nresponded to every appeal for assistance during \r\ndisasters. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to emphasize \r\nMorocco’s ongoing commitment to developing the \r\nAfrican continent. I reiterate my country’s call for the \r\nestablishment of a genuine global partnership for \r\nAfrica that is capable of dealing with the challenges \r\nfacing the continent and that includes a specific \r\ntimetable for implementation and an effective follow-\r\nup mechanism. \r\n Mr. Ndiaye (Senegal) (spoke in French): It is my \r\npleasant duty to congratulate you, Mr. President, and to \r\nwish you the greatest success in your presidency. On \r\nbehalf of Senegal, I would also like to thank you for \r\nconvening this important debate on the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), as \r\nwell as to express my delegation’s thanks to the \r\nSecretariat and the Secretary-General for the quality of \r\nthe reports before us (A/65/152, A/65/165, A/65/167) \r\nand the relevant recommendations they contain. \r\n NEPAD, based on an African culture of \r\ndevelopment, is the bearer of a new concept of the \r\nnature and orientation of the relationship Africa should \r\nhave with the rest of the world, that is, one based on a \r\ntrue partnership going forward. This ambitious \r\nprogramme involves not only Africa, which bears \r\nprimary responsibility for its own development, but \r\nalso calls for action by the rest of the international \r\ncommunity to support our continent in its untiring \r\nA/65/PV.30  \r\n \r\n10-58121 28 \r\n \r\nefforts to free itself from the trap of endemic \r\nunderdevelopment. \r\n It has been said today that during the first nine \r\nyears of NEPAD’s existence, Africa has made \r\nsignificant progress on many fronts, particularly in the \r\nareas of eliminating hot spots and returning to \r\neconomic growth, good governance and democracy, as \r\nwell as promoting human rights and gender equality. \r\nWe must, however, agree that despite encouraging \r\nsigns mentioned in the Secretary-General’s report \r\n(A/65/167), progress continues to be slow and \r\ndifficulties continue to be a drag on our continent’s \r\nfuture. Indeed, in many other areas the picture is a \r\nsombre one, aggravated by the recent crises that have \r\nkept Africa mired in inextricable difficulties and put it \r\nat a crossroads in its quest for development. \r\n Even more disturbing and serious are the soaring \r\nstatistics on poverty, which now affects almost two \r\nfifths of Africa’s population; HIV infections, afflicting \r\nmore than 20 million people; malaria, with nine deaths \r\nout of 10, on a global scale, occurring in Africa; and on \r\ninfant and maternal mortality. To these recurring \r\nproblems are added the familiar litany of other factors \r\nthat continue to vex the international debate on \r\ndevelopment. Among others, we have rising famine \r\nand unemployment, farming subsidies that severely \r\nundermine free trade, an intolerable debt burden and \r\nthe energy crisis, which results in collateral damage \r\nsuch as abrupt, uncontrolled fluctuations in oil prices. \r\nClearly, Africa will have a tough time getting its \r\neconomy to take off if it cannot leave behind these \r\ninnumerable constraints. \r\n It is by respecting its promises and its consequent \r\nfinancing efforts that the international community can \r\nreally help Africa, as the Secretary-General has called \r\nfor. Today, the implementation of NEPAD’s sectoral \r\npriorities has opened up several areas whose success \r\nrequires genuine international support. As one \r\nexample, according to the World Bank, Africa’s \r\ninfrastructure needs have now reached $93 billion, \r\nwhile the continent itself can provide only $45 billion. \r\nThat is just one of many possible examples that show \r\nthat the hoped-for effects of the global partnership \r\nhave been slow to reach the level of declared \r\nexpectations and ambitions. As I noted previously, the \r\nneed for international support does not diminish in any \r\nway the primary responsibility that each State bears for \r\nimplementing its own development. \r\n With regard to the report, Senegal welcomes the \r\nSecretary-General’s recommendations, which call on \r\nAfrican countries to strengthen the capacity of regional \r\neconomic communities to carry out NEPAD’s regional \r\nprojects. Almost a decade since NEPAD’s launch, the \r\nintegration of its executive secretariat into the African \r\nUnion and the creation, in February, of the NEPAD \r\nPlanning and Coordination Agency are a response to \r\nAfrican countries’ firm determination to strengthen \r\ntheir institutional capacity. That desire is also reflected \r\nin the strengthening of the African Peer Review \r\nMechanism, which is a powerful instrument for \r\npromoting good governance; the 10 per cent increase in \r\npublic agricultural spending, in accordance with the \r\nMaputo Declaration; and the effort to protect the \r\nenvironment through the ambitious project to build the \r\nGreen Wall, which will cross the Sahel from Dakar to \r\nDjibouti. \r\n Development in Africa of necessity requires the \r\nestablishment of stability and lasting peace. In this \r\nregard, we welcome the return of our neighbour \r\nGuinea-Bissau to constitutional order, as well as the \r\ndemocratization process that has unfolded in our sister \r\nrepublic of Guinea, which is preparing to organize the \r\nsecond round of its presidential elections in the coming \r\nweeks. Senegal, which has an unshakable faith in the \r\ngenius of the Guinean people, reiterates its unswerving \r\nsupport in brotherhood and friendship for Guinea at \r\nthis delicate stage in its journey towards stability, \r\nharmony and progress. \r\n My country is likewise pleased with the \r\nupcoming presidential election to be held in Côte \r\nd’Ivoire. We have no doubt that this great African \r\npeople, in a glorious surge of patriotism, will do what \r\nthey must to demonstrate once more to the watching \r\nworld their capacity to outdo themselves, as well as \r\ntheir attachment to the cardinal virtues of democracy, \r\njustice and peace, so dear to the founding father of the \r\nIvorian State, former President Houphouët Boigny. We \r\nexpress the same desire for peace and restored stability \r\nfor the Niger, Madagascar, Somalia and the Sudan, \r\nwhich all deserve the constant attention of the United \r\nNations for a definitive return to peace. \r\n In her well-known work entitled What if Africa \r\nRejected Development?, about which the most \r\ninformed analysts on issues of African development are \r\ndivided, writer Axelle Kabou asks sceptically about \r\nAfrica’s future while also questioning all the actors \r\ninvolved. For us in Senegal the answer is no. No, we \r\n A/65/PV.30\r\n \r\n29 10-58121 \r\n \r\nare not rejecting development. Africa, that strangled \r\ncontinent, to paraphrase René Dumont, is moving with \r\ngreat determination and selfless abnegation to emerge \r\nfrom the labyrinth of poverty. However, Africa is \r\nrunning up against major obstacles, both of its own \r\nmaking as well as caused by outside forces. The only \r\nway for Africa to extricate itself from that situation is \r\nthrough a framework of a genuine, sincere, fair and \r\nequitable partnership, far removed from seldom \r\nrespected promises and commitments. \r\n During a ministerial meeting on the least \r\ndeveloped countries held recently in Lisbon, Portugal, \r\nDirector-General of the United Nations Industrial \r\nDevelopment Organization Kandeh Yumkella \r\nexpressed his astonishment at the fact that “Africa is \r\nboth the richest and the poorest continent” on Earth \r\nwith, inter alia, 25 per cent of the world’s oil reserves \r\nand 30 to 40 per cent of its bauxite reserves. That \r\nspeaks to the urgency of the need for the international \r\ncommunity to correct this major contradiction and to \r\nseriously work for Africa to economically take off. \r\n Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): The priority given today to African issues in \r\nthe work of the United Nations and other international \r\nforums, including the Group of Eight (G-8) and the \r\nGroup of 20, is absolutely appropriate. On the African \r\ncontinent, developments are unfolding that will define \r\nnot only the face of Africa for the long term but also \r\nthe general progress of humankind in implementing the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). The search \r\nfor effective solutions aimed at ensuring sustainable \r\nsocio-economic development in Africa was justifiably \r\nconsidered a key challenge at September’s High-level \r\nPlenary Meeting on the MDGs. \r\n We have managed to achieve some positive \r\nresults in the past five years. At the same time, there is \r\na serious delay in implementing the MDGs in areas \r\nsuch as reducing child and maternal mortality, curbing \r\nthe HIV/AIDS epidemic and achieving health and \r\nsanitation targets. It is important that, in the summit \r\noutcome document (resolution 65/1), we clearly \r\nreiterated our commitment to achieving the MDGs in \r\nAfrica, which is disproportionately suffering from the \r\nnegative consequences of the global financial and \r\neconomic crisis, from food and energy insecurity and \r\nfrom climate change. \r\n One of the critical challenges to the timely \r\nachievement of the MDGs in Africa is to implement the \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). \r\nRussia has consistently championed this African Union \r\ninitiative, which reflects the desire of African States to \r\nindependently determine their future and take on major \r\nresponsibility for ensuring peace and security, \r\nmanaging the economy, the rational use of natural \r\nresources, combating corruption and effectively \r\nutilizing the funds allocated for development \r\nassistance. \r\n President Dmitry Medvedev, congratulating \r\nAfrican leaders on Africa Day, welcomed their steady \r\nprogress towards deepening political and economic \r\nintegration within the African Union and other \r\norganizations, calling it a credible instrument for \r\ndealing with the many challenges facing the region. \r\n The United Nations system has an important role \r\nwith regard to international support for NEPAD. We \r\nare pleased to note the progress achieved by the \r\nOrganization in this area, as well as the uninterrupted \r\nand coherent nature of its work in promoting the \r\nimplementation of the goals of the partnership. \r\nMobilizing financial resources in support of NEPAD is \r\nof critical importance. Unfortunately, in spite of the \r\nincrease in assistance to Africa in the past few years, \r\nthe volume of assistance still does not meet the \r\ncommitments made. \r\n Russia will continue to make its contribution to \r\ninternational efforts in this area. To date, our country \r\nhas written off $20 billion worth of our African \r\npartners’ debt. Consultations on establishing a \r\nmechanism for debt-for-aid swaps are being conducted \r\nwith Benin, Zambia, Madagascar, Mozambique, \r\nTanzania and Ethiopia. The total forecasted write-off is \r\nabout $547 million. We anticipate a Russian \r\ncontribution of $50 million to the Rapid Social \r\nResponse Multi Donor Trust Fund to support \r\nvulnerable countries, especially sub Saharan African \r\nStates, to provide assistance in overcoming the \r\nconsequences of the global financial and economic \r\ncrisis. Countries in that region are receiving targeted \r\nhumanitarian assistance. The Russian gross domestic \r\nproduct contribution of the past two years has been \r\nused to help Guinea, Zimbabwe, Ethiopia, Somalia and \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo. \r\n Russia’s financial participation is continuing in \r\nother Africa-focused efforts in the G-8 and under \r\nWorld Bank programmes and multilateral international \r\ninitiatives on health, education and poverty eradication. \r\nA/65/PV.30  \r\n \r\n10-58121 30 \r\n \r\nAfrican countries also enjoy wide-ranging preferential \r\ntrade treatment. Traditional export goods from least \r\ndeveloped countries are not assessed Russian import or \r\ncustoms tariffs. Trade with Russia has exceeded \r\n$6 billion. \r\n Programmes are continuing to assist in the \r\ntraining of staff. At present, Russian institutions of \r\nhigher learning host more than 4,500 African students, \r\nabout half of whom receive financial support from our \r\nfederal budget. African students were allocated 750 \r\nRussian State scholarships for the 2009-2010 academic \r\nyear. \r\n Meeting the challenges of socio economic \r\nprogress and increasing the level of well-being in \r\nAfrica can be promoted as well by developing \r\ninvestment partnerships with Russian companies. The \r\nscope of such partnerships has increased significantly \r\nin a whole range of economic sectors, including \r\ndeveloping oil and gas deposits, extracting minerals \r\nand building hydroelectric and atomic energy facilities, \r\nas well as in more sophisticated fields such as outer \r\nspace, high-tech astrophysics and nuclear research. The \r\nvolume of Russian investment in Angola, Algeria, \r\nGabon, Guinea, Egypt, Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Libya, \r\nNamibia, the Niger, Nigeria and South Africa is in the \r\nbillions of dollars. \r\n Russia attaches great importance to implementing \r\nthe goals of the Decade to Roll Back Malaria. By the \r\nend of this year, we will have completed the payment of \r\nour contribution of $20 million for the implementation \r\nof the World Bank programme for malaria control in \r\nAfrica. We have also set aside $4 million for the World \r\nHealth Organization’s programme to that end. \r\n In that regard, Russia’s contributions have been \r\nfocused on Zambia and Mozambique and have been \r\nused for the purchase of about 300,000 long-acting \r\nmosquito nets. The overall efforts of the international \r\ncommunity have meant that in Zambia, for example, \r\nmalaria is no longer the major cause of early infant \r\nmortality. During the recent meeting of the third \r\nVoluntary Replenishment of the Global Fund to Fight \r\nAIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, Russia stated its \r\nintention to contribute up to $60 million for the period \r\n2011-2013, bringing our aggregate support to the Fund \r\nto $310 million. \r\n We value our multifaceted ties with Africa, our \r\nreliable and time-tested partner. Russia’s policy is to \r\nfocus on further developing its interaction with Africa \r\nto make it long-term and strategic. President Dmitry \r\nMedvedev reiterated that policy in his July address to \r\nAfrican leaders, in which he especially emphasized the \r\never-broadening nature, new positive momentum and \r\ndiversified nature of our cooperation. \r\n The meeting rose at 1.10 p.m. \r\n"
