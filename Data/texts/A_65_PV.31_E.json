Those areas are each \r\nimportant individually, but they also have a direct \r\nimpact on each other. We appreciate the opportunity to \r\naddress them together. \r\n The United States is committed to addressing the \r\nprevention and treatment of malaria, HIV/AIDS and \r\ntuberculosis and to reducing their burden worldwide. \r\nThrough the Global Health Initiative and our \r\ncontributions to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \r\nTuberculosis and Malaria, the United States will \r\ncontinue to lead in the fight against those diseases by \r\nfocusing on strengthening health systems and meeting \r\nbroader health challenges, including child and maternal \r\nhealth, family planning and neglected tropical diseases. \r\nIn that regard, I am pleased to note the recent United \r\nStates pledge to seek to contribute an additional \r\n$4 billion to the Global Fund for 2011 to 2013, an \r\nincrease of 38 per cent. \r\n The President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI) is a core \r\ncomponent of our Global Health Initiative and the fight \r\nagainst malaria, as well as a key part of the United \r\nStates foreign assistance strategy. Under the new \r\nUnited States malaria strategy, our goal is to achieve an \r\nAfrica-wide impact by significantly reducing the \r\nburden of malaria for at-risk populations in \r\nsub-Saharan Africa, thereby removing malaria as a \r\nmajor public health problem and promoting economic \r\ngrowth and development throughout the region. \r\n Since 2005, the Initiative has contributed to a \r\nrapid scaling up of malaria prevention and treatment \r\nmeasures across 15 countries in Africa by funding the \r\npurchase of more than 57 million life-saving \r\nantimalarial treatments and more than 27 million \r\ninsecticide-treated nets. During 2009 alone, the \r\nInitiative reached more than 50 million people with \r\npreventive measures or life-saving drugs. It also \r\nprovided support to countries to improve the \r\nmanagement of antimalarial drugs and other essential \r\nA/65/PV.31  \r\n \r\n10-58713 2 \r\n \r\nmedical commodities, which has resulted in \r\nimprovements in supply chain systems in focus \r\ncountries. \r\n Many of the PMI focus countries are now \r\nreporting significant reductions in under-five mortality, \r\nand there is strong and growing evidence that the \r\nscaling up of malaria prevention and treatment efforts \r\nhas been a major factor in those reductions. That \r\nprogress is a result of the collective actions of African \r\nGovernments, the United States and other concerned \r\ndonor nations, multilateral organizations, including the \r\nGlobal Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, \r\nthe United Nations, the World Health Organization and \r\nthe World Bank, and non governmental organizations. \r\n In addition, by reducing the burden of malaria in \r\nhighly endemic countries, the Initiative allows critical \r\nresources and overstretched health workers to \r\nconcentrate on controlling other childhood illnesses \r\nand helps to reduce malaria’s drain on economic \r\ngrowth and development in Africa. \r\n In the past year, the United States has increased \r\nits aid to Africa by 9 per cent to $7.5 billion. However, \r\nwe should not measure aid as an input, but rather look \r\nat outputs. As President Obama said during his address \r\nto this Assembly last month:  \r\n “Let us move beyond the old, narrow debate over \r\nhow much money we are spending and instead let \r\nus focus on results — whether we are actually \r\nmaking improvements in people’s lives” \r\n(A/65/PV.9). \r\n The United Nations has an important role to play \r\nin assisting Africa, especially sub-Saharan African \r\ncountries, to achieve the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. United Nations development agencies, such as \r\nthe United Nations Development Programme, can \r\nmake unique contributions by helping countries to \r\nbuild governance institutions that can bring about \r\npolitical stability, effective and democratic \r\nGovernments, and economic freedom for their citizens. \r\n We welcome the efforts of the United Nations to \r\nimprove the monitoring mechanisms for Africa’s \r\ndevelopment and its focus on results, rather than \r\ninputs, and on the commitments of donor nations, as \r\nwell as African Governments. In our endeavour to \r\nmonitor results effectively, we must ensure that there is \r\ntrue value added and coherence among new and \r\nexisting monitoring mechanisms. \r\n The key for Africa to meet its Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals is to create the conditions for \r\nsustained and broad-based economic growth, so that it \r\ncan break away from dependence on development \r\nassistance. As the Secretary-General’s report \r\nhighlights, countries in Africa enjoyed an average \r\ngrowth rate of 4.65 per cent from 2000 to 2007. We \r\nmust build on that achievement. To that end, we \r\nsupport efforts of the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment to promote democratization, good \r\ngovernance and economic transparency, as well as \r\nenhanced regional- and national-level infrastructure \r\nand food security. \r\n The United States continues to support efforts to \r\nenhance the private sector in Africa. Since 1999, the \r\nUnited States has provided $12 billion in trade capacity \r\nassistance to developing countries, and the African \r\nGrowth and Opportunity Act has contributed to \r\nenhanced trade with Africa. In the first half of 2010, \r\ntrade under that Act totalled $33.1 billion, a 57 per cent \r\nincrease from the same period in 2009. \r\n We remain committed to reducing the debt \r\nburden of African States and to ensuring that resources \r\nare freed up to support the MDGs and broad-based \r\ngrowth. We note that sub-Saharan Africa has benefited \r\nfrom $100 billion in debt cancellation to date. \r\n As the Secretary-General reports, the number of \r\nAfrican States in armed conflict has declined \r\ndramatically, from 14 in the late 1990s to four today. \r\nBut much needs to be done to sustain the peace. \r\nDemocratization and development must go hand in \r\nhand. State institutions must be strengthened and \r\nregional cooperation deepened. Peacekeeping must \r\nevolve into peacebuilding. And post-conflict recovery \r\nmust be the basis for long-term sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Africa’s economic development is the only way \r\nfor us to achieve the MDGs. Fighting diseases such as \r\nmalaria and rooting out the maladies of conflict and \r\npoor governance are keys to growth. The United States \r\nis deeply committed to being a constructive force and \r\nto helping to advance progress on those related and \r\nimportant issues. \r\n Mr. Jomaa (Tunisia) (spoke in French): I have \r\nthe pleasure and the honour to speak before the \r\nGeneral Assembly today to debate the important points \r\non its agenda regarding the development of Africa. I \r\nwould first of all like to thank the Secretary-General \r\n A/65/PV.31\r\n \r\n3 10-58713 \r\n \r\nfor his reports and notes concerning the items under \r\nconsideration (A/65/152, A/65/165, A/65/167, A/65/62, \r\nA/65/62/Add.1 and A/65/210), which highlight the \r\nefforts made by Africa to rid itself of \r\nunderdevelopment, while also setting out the gaps and \r\nexisting constraints, including in the area of crucial \r\ninternational support. \r\n My delegation would like to associate itself with \r\nthe statements delivered this morning by the \r\nrepresentative of Malawi, on behalf of the Group of \r\nAfrican States, and by the representative of Yemen, on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China. \r\n Since its establishment in 2001, the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) has \r\nbeen a driving force in the continent’s economic \r\nrecovery and its integration into the world economy. \r\nNEPAD has given Africa a greater voice and more \r\nresponsibility in choosing its own economic and social \r\npolicies. It has also provided the necessary framework \r\nfor the establishment of stronger partnerships with \r\nother development partners. \r\n Tunisia welcomes NEPAD’s integration into \r\nAfrican Union structures. As an African Union \r\ntechnical body, the NEPAD secretariat, which has now \r\nbecome the Planning and Coordinating Agency for the \r\ninitiative, is working to facilitate and coordinate the \r\nimplementation of priority programmes and projects on \r\nthe regional and continental levels. \r\n The entire world today agrees that Africa has \r\nmade significant progress in various areas in the first \r\nnine years of the existence of this development \r\nprogramme. The report (A/65/152) of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral gives us a picture of that progress in the \r\nvarious aspects of NEPAD’s infrastructure \r\ndevelopment programmes in Africa, which focus on the \r\nareas of energy, transportation, water and sanitation \r\nand information and telecommunications technologies. \r\n The report also points to the significant progress \r\nmade in the implementation of the Comprehensive \r\nAfrica Agriculture Development Programme. \r\n In the areas of health and education, the NEPAD \r\nAgency continues to carry out numerous projects \r\naimed at strengthening Africa’s capacities. \r\n With regard to gender equality and women’s \r\nempowerment, Africa continues to remain committed \r\nto supporting and promoting the socio economic status \r\nof women. The decision taken at the fourteenth African \r\nUnion Summit in February to establish a new fund for \r\nAfrican women reflects that political will. \r\n With regard to the current uncertain and fragile \r\nglobal economic recovery, the implementation of \r\nNEPAD and the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals on the continent require \r\ndetermination and steadfast leadership on the part of \r\nthe continent and its development partners, so as to \r\nensure the attainment of the commitments within the \r\ntimelines that have been set to achieve the \r\nDevelopment Goals. In that regard, my delegation \r\nreiterates the urgent need to establish a monitoring \r\nmechanism under the auspices of the United Nations to \r\nfollow up all the commitments made with regard to \r\nAfrica’s development, as clearly underscored in the \r\npolitical declaration on Africa’s development needs \r\n(resolution 63/1) and in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the matter (A/65/165). \r\n Promoting sustainable peace and development in \r\nAfrica requires concrete, sustained and solidarity-based \r\nefforts on the part of the international community. Such \r\nefforts should address the underlying causes of \r\nunderdevelopment and the conflicts on the continent, \r\nwith a view to establishing an environment conducive \r\nto investment and sustainable economic growth in \r\nAfrica. Tunisia, which was ranked first in the African \r\ncontinent in the area of peace and security by the \r\nGlobal Peace Index, believes that Africa’s efforts in \r\nthat regard should be met by a significant commitment \r\non the part of the international community, a better \r\nunderstanding of Africa’s specific needs and greater \r\ncoordination of policies and programmes. \r\n Allow me to refer to a specific phenomenon that \r\nis a major source of social tension and poverty in \r\nAfrica, namely, youth unemployment. Given that about \r\n60 per cent of the continent’s population is under the \r\nage of 25, unemployment among young people in \r\nAfrica poses a serious threat both for African countries \r\nand for the international community owing to the \r\ndisturbances to society and other repercussions caused \r\nby this phenomenon.  \r\n While this phenomenon has been present for \r\nquite some time, unemployment among young people \r\nhas in recent years taken on alarming proportions. \r\nAccording to the International Labour Office, 21 per \r\ncent of young people between the ages of 15 and 24 in \r\nsub-Saharan Africa are affected. The situation is even \r\nA/65/PV.31  \r\n \r\n10-58713 4 \r\n \r\nworse in North Africa, where 25.6 per cent of young \r\npeople are unemployed.  \r\n It is therefore up to the international community, \r\nin particular our development partners, to work \r\ntogether with Africa to create an environment \r\npromoting active participation by young people in the \r\neconomic, social and political development of their \r\ncontinent, as well as to seize the opportunity provided \r\nby the International Year of Youth. That initiative, \r\nlaunched by Tunisia’s President and adopted by the \r\nGeneral Assembly, seeks to promote initiatives to \r\nengender the ideals of peace, freedom, progress and \r\nsolidarity among young people. \r\n Moreover, development partners should redouble \r\ntheir efforts as part of an integrated approach to help \r\nAfrica overcome the underlying causes of tension on \r\nthe continent, including unemployment, food \r\ninsecurity, climate change, water shortages and \r\ndesertification.  \r\n Various actions, including relieving debt burdens, \r\nfacilitating the physical movement of people, \r\nincreasing foreign direct investment, increasing official \r\ndevelopment assistance, encouraging the transfer of \r\ntechnology and strengthening capacities in order to \r\ntake greater advantage of preferential treatment \r\nschemes, are now needed to contribute to the \r\nachievement of sustainable peace and development on \r\nthe African continent. \r\n Malaria continues to be one of the main causes of \r\nillness and death among children under the age of five \r\nin Africa. Among other things, given the significant \r\nnumber of victims affected annually — more than \r\n1 million people — this illness causes enormous losses \r\nto the continent’s gross domestic product. Tunisia is \r\nconscious of the impact of the disease and its \r\ndevastating effects on economic and social \r\ndevelopment. In spite of the fact that we are a \r\ndeveloping country with limited resources, our \r\nPresident, who has advocated the creation and \r\nimplementation of a robust mechanism for national \r\nsolidarity and has called for the international \r\ncommunity also to set up a global solidarity fund, an \r\nidea that the General Assembly subsequently adopted, \r\ntook a decision on 4 October, during the \r\nReplenishment Conference of the Global Fund to Fight \r\nAIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, to support the Fund’s \r\nefforts by making a financial contribution in the \r\namount of $2 million for the 2011-2013 period. \r\n In conclusion, based on our deeply held belief in \r\nour common future and in the imperative need for \r\ncooperation and solidarity with African countries, \r\nTunisia is resolved to work together with African \r\ncountries to make the continent a zone of active \r\npartnership and to establish in Africa the conditions for \r\nsustainable peace and development. The priority task \r\nfor all interested stakeholders now is to honour their \r\ncommitments to Africa. \r\n Mr. Tommo Monthe (Cameroon) (spoke in \r\nFrench): Allow me to begin by congratulating the \r\nSecretary-General for the reports that he has made \r\navailable to the General Assembly under agenda items \r\n62 and 12 dealing with the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) (A/65/167) and the \r\n2001-2010 Decade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing \r\nCountries, Particularly in Africa (A/65/210).  \r\n I would also like to state that my delegation \r\nassociates itself with the statements made on those \r\nreports by the representatives who spoke on behalf of \r\nthe Group of 77 and China and the Group of African \r\nStates. \r\n This joint debate on the aforementioned items is \r\ntaking place a few weeks after the High-level Plenary \r\nMeeting on the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) held from 20 to 22 September on the margins \r\nof the current session. That High-level Meeting was \r\nheralded in the report of the Secretary-General as being \r\nan opportunity for the international community to \r\nconsider in detail the situation in Africa. Allow me, \r\ntherefore, to provide a quick overview of the progress \r\nmade on the implementation of NEPAD, taking into \r\naccount, on the one hand, the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and, on the other hand, the draft outcome \r\ndocument of the High-level Plenary Meeting on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (resolution 64/299), \r\nparticularly with respect to Africa. \r\n My delegation agrees with the observation made \r\nby the Secretary-General that, in the context of the \r\ncurrent fragile and uncertain global recovery, the \r\nimplementation of NEPAD and the achievement of the \r\nMDGs require determination and unfailing leadership, \r\nboth from African countries and from development \r\npartners, in order to go from theory to concrete results. \r\nWith respect to Africa’s responsibility, it is clear that \r\nthe countries of the continent have drawn up their own \r\nnational development programmes in accordance with \r\n A/65/PV.31\r\n \r\n5 10-58713 \r\n \r\ntheir own priorities, the NEPAD programme and the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. \r\n As for the agencies, the African Development \r\nBank and the Economic Commission for Africa are \r\ncontinuing their mission, which involves carrying out a \r\ncertain number of projects and programmes within the \r\nprocess of implementing NEPAD. In addition, the \r\nregional economic communities, which play a leading \r\nrole in the context of economic integration, are striving \r\nto fulfil their role as key players in the implementation \r\nof projects at the subregional level. I am thinking, for \r\nexample, of the Economic Community of West African \r\nStates, the Economic Community of Central African \r\nStates and the Southern African Development \r\nCommunity, in particular. \r\n Lastly, at the continental level, in February 2010, \r\nthe African Union approved the integration of NEPAD \r\ninto the Union’s structures and processes and set up the \r\nNEPAD Planning and Coordination Agency, whose \r\nmandate is to implement projects and programmes that \r\nare priorities at the regional and continental levels in \r\nAfrica. \r\n At those different levels, efforts are under way to \r\nimplement programmes in the different sectors \r\nidentified by the MDG Africa Steering Group, for \r\nexample, agriculture and food security, education, \r\nhealth, commerce infrastructure and facilitation, as \r\nwell as statistical systems. \r\n However, recent studies carried out by the \r\nSteering Group reveal that, even if some progress has \r\nbeen seen, much remains to be done in the area of \r\nofficial development assistance (ODA), debt \r\nmanagement, foreign direct investment flows and \r\ntrade. \r\n In the area of ODA, Africa will probably only \r\nreceive $12 billion of the $25 billion increase that was \r\nconsidered at the Gleneagles summit, mainly because \r\ncontributions from the main donors are lower than \r\nwhat was originally planned. As for the debt, efforts \r\nare being made to provide relief for African countries, \r\nboth within the framework of the Heavily Indebted \r\nPoor Countries (HIPC) Initiative and the Multilateral \r\nDebt Relief Initiative, as well as through bilateral debt \r\nrelief. Thus, on 1 July 2010, 23 African countries, \r\nincluding Cameroon, reached the completion point and \r\nbenefited from debt relief under the HIPC Initiative. \r\nHowever, we know that the economic crisis has \r\nundermined those efforts, producing an adverse effect \r\non Africa’s debt levels. \r\n With respect to foreign direct investment, \r\ninvestment destined for Africa dropped by more than \r\n36 per cent in 2009, because of the economic crisis. \r\n Lastly, when it comes to trade, the Doha Round \r\nnegotiations have made very little progress towards the \r\ndevelopment of an agreement on issues of concern to \r\nAfrica, including the end of export subsidies for \r\nagricultural commodities. \r\n Those gaps, which have been pointed out in the \r\nreport of the Secretary-General, are those that largely \r\nundermine the implementation of NEPAD. However, \r\nwe are hopeful that the progress seen in the \r\nimplementation of NEPAD, such as that pointed out in \r\nthe report of the Secretary-General, will be continued \r\nand that the recommendations that he has made will be \r\nfollowed up by action. Among the signs of progress we \r\nsee, for example, a strengthening at the institutional \r\nlevel of the African Peer Review Mechanism, \r\ninvolving the integration of the newly created African \r\nPartner Country Network and its addition to the \r\nstructures and processes of the African Union. \r\n The recommendations made by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral include the need for African countries to \r\ncontinue to effectively implement NEPAD’s progress \r\nand programmes; the importance for all of the \r\nstakeholders to design an outreach strategy to \r\nstrengthen awareness and public opinion at the \r\nnational, regional, continental and international levels \r\nwith respect to the vision, goals and objectives of \r\nNEPAD; the strengthening of the institutional capacity \r\nof the Commission of the African Union; the \r\nstrengthening of the capacities of regional economic \r\ncommunities; the need to place a priority on \r\ninvestment in agriculture, given its importance in \r\ndevelopment, poverty reduction and the reduction of \r\nfood insecurity; greater support for African women, \r\ngiven their major role in agriculture; and the \r\nstrengthening of cooperation between rich countries \r\nand multilateral development agencies, on the one \r\nhand, and Africa, on the other. \r\n As for the High-level Plenary Meeting on the \r\nMDGs and its outcome document, although we ought \r\nto be pleased with the commitments that were \r\nreconfirmed by world leaders, we are forced to \r\nacknowledge that the repetition of those commitments \r\nalso reveals their increasingly uncertain nature. \r\nA/65/PV.31  \r\n \r\n10-58713 6 \r\n \r\n But how do we implement all of those \r\nrecommendations? The answer is to be found primarily \r\nin a greater commitment from Africa itself, but also in \r\nensuring that development partners respect their \r\ncommitments, as stated by both the Secretary-General \r\nin the conclusions to his report on NEPAD and the \r\noutcome document of the High-level Meeting on the \r\nMDGs. \r\n Africa is not only weakened by \r\nunderdevelopment and poor development. It is also \r\nliterally sickened by pandemics such as malaria, a \r\nsubject covered under agenda item 12, which we are \r\nconsidering. Over the past 10 years, the efforts to \r\ncontrol malaria, a disease that afflicts Africa in \r\nparticular, have captured the attention of political \r\nleaders and attracted funding at the international, \r\nregional and national levels.  \r\n At the African Summit to Roll Back Malaria, held \r\nin Abuja in 2000, African heads of State and \r\nGovernment voiced their determination to undertake \r\nintensive efforts to fight against malaria. World leaders \r\nincluded among the Millennium Development Goals \r\nthe goal of bringing malaria under control and of \r\nstarting to roll it back before 2015. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, appointed a Special Envoy \r\nfor Malaria. Various stakeholders involved in the fight \r\nagainst the disease laid out a Global Malaria Action \r\nPlan, and in October 2009 in New York, heads of State \r\nlaunched the African Leaders Malaria Alliance.  \r\n Given the impact of malaria, in particular in \r\ndeveloping countries, the international community \r\nproclaimed 2001-2010 as the Decade to Roll Back \r\nMalaria in Developing Countries, Particularly in \r\nAfrica. In order to evaluate the progress achieved in \r\nreaching the goals set for 2010, the Secretary-General, \r\nin accordance with resolutions 62/180 and 64/79, has \r\npresented us with the report contained in document \r\nA/65/210. My delegation would like to thank him for \r\nthat report. \r\n There are three aspects in particular of the report \r\nthat drew my delegation’s attention. These are \r\ncontained in paragraphs 17 to 26, having to do with the \r\nfinancing of malaria control; paragraphs 51 to 54, \r\nhaving to do with the impact of control programmes in \r\nthe World Health Organization (WHO) African Region; \r\nand paragraphs 66 to 78, which contain the summary \r\nand recommendations of the report. \r\n First, on financing, we welcome the increase in \r\ndisbursements, which have now gone from $35 million \r\nin 2000 to over $1 billion in 2008. In that regard, we \r\nrecognize the commitment of the Global Fund to Fight \r\nAIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and of the United \r\nStates Agency for International Development and the \r\nUnited Kingdom Department for International \r\nDevelopment. We note with satisfaction that it was in \r\nthe WHO African Region that the disbursements for \r\nmalaria made by outside agencies were increased by a \r\nfactor of 28 between 2000 and 2007. But despite that \r\nprogress, we cannot help but notice that the total level \r\nof financing remains below the annual amount targeted \r\nin the Global Malaria Action Plan.  \r\n In terms of the impact of programmes to combat \r\nmalaria, we are happy to note the progress achieved, in \r\nparticular in Africa, as highlighted in paragraphs 51 to \r\n54 of the Secretary-General’s report. In general, \r\ncurrent trends, if they continue, suggest that intensive \r\nantimalaria efforts could help many countries in Africa \r\nto achieve a two-thirds reduction in child and infant \r\nmortality by 2015, as envisaged by MDG 4. \r\n Finally, the recommendations made by the \r\nSecretary-General are of genuine interest to my \r\ndelegation. A number of those recommendations \r\nhighlight the need to strengthen the fight against \r\nmalaria and boost the distribution of treated mosquito \r\nnets, diagnostic tests and access to artemisinin \r\ncombination therapies, as well as the importance of \r\npursuing foreign assistance, enhancing respect for \r\nregulations that govern the quality of medications on \r\nthe market and strengthening the capacities of health \r\nministries. Those are all measures that would support \r\nnational efforts in the fight against malaria.  \r\n To conclude, I would like to reiterate my \r\ndelegation’s gratitude to the Secretary-General and to \r\nexpress to him, to his Special Envoy for Malaria, to the \r\nDirector-General of WHO and to all the people \r\nworking on the ground our support for the work carried \r\nout in the fight against malaria. In general, and this \r\napplies to malaria as well as to the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development, the United Nations must create \r\na structured action plan, including an outline of all of \r\ntheir contributions to the implementation of the \r\nantimalaria programmes, for a set period of two or \r\nthree years, along with a clear view of the indicators \r\nused to measure results and the distribution of \r\nresponsibilities. This would allow us, when all is said \r\n A/65/PV.31\r\n \r\n7 10-58713 \r\n \r\nand done, to take stock of the progress made and of \r\nwhat remains to be accomplished. \r\n The Secretary-General could also, in proposing \r\nprogrammes for the coming year to the Committee for \r\nProgramme and Coordination, take another look at the \r\nthree current subprogrammes under programme 9 of \r\nthe proposed strategic framework for the period 2010-\r\n2011, in order to ensure that the level of work, \r\nfinancial resources, administrative structure and \r\npersonnel employed is appropriate in terms of quantity \r\nand quality. Close coordination with the African Group \r\nwould be entirely appropriate in that regard. \r\n Mr. Onemola (Nigeria): Nigeria commends the \r\nSecretary-General for his detailed reports on agenda \r\nitems 62 (a) and (b) and appreciates the opportunity to \r\nparticipate in this deliberation. \r\n We also wish to commend the Planning and \r\nCoordinating Agency of the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) for its remarkable and \r\ninnovative approaches in coordinating the various \r\nclusters of its activities. We are pleased to note that \r\nencouraging progress has been made in the areas of \r\ntransnational infrastructure, science and technology, \r\nhealth, agriculture and partnerships with the United \r\nNations system. \r\n We are aware of the fact that the African \r\ndevelopment targets on the NEPAD platform cannot be \r\nmet without resolving the various challenges \r\nconfronting member States. However, we believe that \r\nthese challenges can be surmounted with renewed \r\ndetermination and recommitment to the goals set. \r\n My delegation aligns itself with the statements \r\nmade by the representatives of the African Group and \r\nthe Group of 77 and China. We would like to comment \r\non the following sub-items. \r\n On sub-item (a), the economic and development \r\nchallenges facing Africa are indeed unique, and \r\napproaches to resolving them must lend credence to a \r\ndevelopment philosophy that is cognizant of local \r\ncircumstances and recognizes the need to use \r\nsubregional, regional and international development \r\nmachinery, thereby setting a new paradigm in charting \r\na development path for Africa. Those challenges led to \r\nthe creation of NEPAD a decade ago, as Africa’s \r\nblueprint, with emphasis on ownership and partnership \r\ngeared towards guaranteeing Africa’s economic \r\nrenewal and development. \r\n Efforts to attain the targets set for each of the \r\nnine clusters identified by NEPAD have renewed the \r\ncall for all African countries to build on existing \r\nprogress and to fully identify with the operational \r\nblueprint of NEPAD. In this regard, we note that the \r\nfailures of past development plans in Africa have had \r\nless to do with a lack of available frameworks than \r\nwith haphazard implementation. My delegation \r\ntherefore commends the Economic Commission for \r\nAfrica, the African Development Bank and the NEPAD \r\nPlanning and Coordinating Agency on their efforts to \r\nimplement NEPAD programmes and objectives. \r\n Since the inception of NEPAD, there has been \r\nrenewed confidence that, through its ongoing \r\nstrategies, Africa will be able to resolve its \r\nunderdevelopment crisis. It is, however, imperative to \r\nensure that NEPAD’s broader mandate remains in \r\nfocus. In this regard, divergent interests must be set \r\naside for the collective good, and commitments by \r\nMember States towards successful partnership must \r\nremain unwavering. \r\n It behooves individual Member States to strive \r\nharder to mainstream the development agenda into \r\ntheir sectoral programmes, using regional blocs as \r\ntools for continental economic integration. Nigeria \r\ncommends the Economic Community of West African \r\nStates (ECOWAS) for its various contributions that \r\nculminated in the signing of the first regional \r\nagricultural compact. We hope that such positive steps \r\nwill be replicated in other subregions and integrated \r\ninto the larger African continent. \r\n It has been recognized worldwide that NEPAD \r\nstands on the planks of good governance, capacity-\r\nbuilding and partnership. In order to garner the \r\nrequired momentum that would guarantee steady \r\nprogress towards the implementation of the \r\nPartnership’s objectives, we must not lose sight of the \r\nneed to boost the continent’s capacity to govern and \r\ndevelop long-term policies. \r\n The current dearth in human capital can be \r\naddressed through a conscious focus on human \r\ncapacity-building, which would ultimately coalesce \r\ninto institutional development. We believe that, rather \r\nthan substituting for them, it is better to build national \r\ncapacities in a sustainable way. This will also prevent a \r\nculture of dependency. \r\n Member countries should also leverage the \r\nenhanced support of the United Nations system in a \r\nA/65/PV.31  \r\n \r\n10-58713 8 \r\n \r\ndrive towards attaining the Ten-Year Capacity-Building \r\nProgramme for the African Union. We believe that will \r\nboost Africa’s ability to mobilize, manage and sustain \r\neconomic development, as well as to ensure that \r\nsuccesses achieved are not short-lived. In this \r\nconnection, Nigeria welcomes the innovative NEPAD \r\ne-schools demonstration project. \r\n My delegation appreciates the position of the \r\nGroup of Eight in affirming its official development \r\nassistance commitments, as well as its resolve to \r\nenhance aid effectiveness. In particular, we welcome \r\nthe Muskoka Initiative on child mortality and maternal \r\nhealth, as we believe that no development goal \r\nsubstantially supersedes another. \r\n NEPAD no doubt opens up opportunities for \r\nAfrica to fast-track its Millennium Development Goals, \r\nbut we also believe that its celebrated initiatives \r\ndepend largely on scaled-up and consistent \r\ndevelopment assistance for their full implementation. \r\nWe therefore call on Member States and friends of \r\nAfrica to adopt a complementary hands-on approach \r\nthat would lead to the fulfilment of the cardinal \r\npurpose of NEPAD. \r\n Nigeria firmly believes that NEPAD’s goals of \r\nbuilding strong economic infrastructure and creating a \r\nfavourable environment for investments remain crucial. \r\nIt is through this approach that Africa can be pulled out \r\nof its present economic difficulties to enable it to \r\nprosper as it should. \r\n Turning to sub-item (b), much has been said \r\nabout the inextricable link between durable peace and \r\nsustainable development in Africa. A continent as \r\ndiverse as Africa can best realize partnership goals \r\nwhen rancorous impediments give way to lasting peace \r\nand security. My delegation recognizes that conflict, no \r\nmatter its extent, poses serious challenges to the proper \r\nintegration of African States, as it hampers the \r\nsuccessful implementation of the goals of NEPAD. \r\n My delegation calls for the continued utilization \r\nof the Continental Early Warning System, which is \r\naimed at preventing conflicts. In addition, Member \r\nStates should embrace an effective mechanism to \r\nmediate conflicting interests. It is for this reason that \r\nNigeria, in order to highlight the importance we attach \r\nto conflict prevention, chose the theme of preventive \r\ndiplomacy for its open debate during its presidency of \r\nthe Security Council last year. There is no doubt that \r\nthe prevention of conflicts is a less expensive option \r\nfor maintaining peace and security in the world. \r\nIndeed, it is becoming evident that preventing conflicts \r\nis the best way to preserve development gains. There is \r\ntherefore a need to continue to give new impetus to \r\nconflict-prevention strategies. \r\n Poverty is both the cause and the effect of \r\nconflicts in Africa, which are of global concern \r\nbecause their ripple effects go beyond African \r\nfrontiers. It is therefore the responsibility of all to \r\nengage as positive catalysts in actualizing a conflict-\r\nfree Africa and to ensure that the achievements so far \r\nare further consolidated. In this regard, we commend \r\nthe efforts of NEPAD in reconstructing post-conflict \r\ncountries and in providing credible transition and exit \r\nstrategies. We equally call for continued financial and \r\ninstitutional support for the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission. \r\n Nigeria currently chairs ECOWAS. We are \r\ntherefore pleased to report that leaders of the \r\norganization have made substantial progress in \r\nbringing lasting peace and stability to within the \r\nborders of the subregion. That has been instrumental in \r\nimproving conflict situations in West Africa. We \r\nbelieve that these critical steps will usher in an \r\nenabling environment for development as peace and \r\nsecurity prevail. \r\n In the same vein, the continued efforts of United \r\nNations peacekeeping forces and of the African Union \r\nPeace and Security Council have become invaluable \r\nresources in the pursuit of peace and sustainable \r\ndevelopment across Africa. \r\n Let me now turn to agenda item 12. Nigeria \r\nrecognizes the health burden posed by malaria on the \r\npeople of Africa. Although there have been \r\nquantifiable improvements in curbing the scourge over \r\nthe past 10 years, the goals of the Roll Back Malaria \r\ncampaign have still not been realized. In no small \r\nmeasure, malaria still constitutes a barrier to economic \r\nand social development across Africa. \r\n My delegation commends the growing political \r\ncommitment in the fight against malaria. We advocate \r\ncloser cooperation between Roll Back Malaria \r\npartnerships and the international community in order \r\nto develop the capacity to fully implement individual \r\ncountry strategic plans and ensure the achievement of \r\nthe Abuja targets. \r\n A/65/PV.31\r\n \r\n9 10-58713 \r\n \r\n In the same vein, Nigeria sees the need for an \r\naccelerated pace in combating this disease. We \r\ntherefore call for more international donors and \r\npartners to complement existing local resources. My \r\ndelegation strongly believes that an Africa free from \r\nmalaria, in which its citizens peacefully coexist, will \r\nbe better situated on the path towards achieving the \r\nmuch-needed African development targets. \r\n Finally, although the challenges facing Africa \r\nlook daunting, they are not insurmountable. With \r\neffective harmonization and coordination, the targets \r\nset out in the different frameworks could propel Africa \r\nto become a land of opportunity. In this connection, my \r\ndelegation calls for the urgent fulfilment of the pledges \r\nof aid made to Africa at various international forums. \r\nWe are confident that a new Africa free of hunger, \r\ndisease and poverty will meaningfully contribute to \r\nglobal economic prosperity, peace and stability. \r\n Mr. McNee (Canada): Canada is pleased once \r\nagain this year to join this important debate on Africa. \r\nAfrica is a continent rich in its cultures, diversity and \r\nhistory. Many African countries have made important \r\nprogress in recent years, and significant parts of the \r\ncontinent are moving in the right direction. They have \r\nseen more free and fair elections and more prudent \r\neconomic management, with more reform-minded and \r\ndemocratic leadership. One of the most significant \r\ndevelopments has been the maturation of African \r\ninstitutions that promote regional integration and \r\nsecurity. \r\n Much remains to be done to assist African \r\ncountries to achieve the Millennium Development \r\nGoals and to build stable political and economic \r\ninstitutions. Achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals is a shared responsibility based on commitment, \r\npartnership and perseverance. \r\n Canada is doing its part to help Africa achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. Canada met its Group \r\nof Eight (G-8) commitment to double aid to Africa \r\nfrom 2003-2004 levels, to $2.1 billion. Furthermore, \r\nCanada reaffirmed its commitment to double \r\ninternational assistance from 2002 levels by 2011. This \r\nwill increase Canada’s total international assistance to \r\napproximately $5 billion. As part of the joint G-8 \r\npledge on food security, Canada will more than double \r\nits investment in food security and provide $600 \r\nmillion in increased funding over three years, reaching \r\n$1.18 billion in overall funding. \r\n As President of the G-8 and the Group of 20 (G-20) \r\nfor 2010, Canada ensured that Africa’s voice was heard \r\nin this process. G-8 leaders had a substantive \r\ndiscussion with African leaders at the Muskoka \r\nSummit on peace and security and development issues. \r\nConsultations with African countries in the lead-up to \r\nthe Muskoka Summit helped to shape the G-8 initiative \r\non maternal, newborn and child health, which will see \r\nthe mobilization of more than $7 billion. G-8 and \r\nAfrican leaders also agreed to work closely together to \r\ncombat international narcotics trafficking, particularly \r\nin West Africa and the Americas. \r\n Canada invited the leaders of Malawi, as Chair of \r\nthe African Union, and of Ethiopia to the G-20 Toronto \r\nSummit to help ensure a stronger voice for Africa. \r\nLeaders held important discussions on a range of \r\nactions to support economic recovery and define the \r\npath forward for strong, sustainable and balanced \r\nglobal growth. This included fulfilling commitments \r\nfor $350 billion in capital increases for multilateral \r\ndevelopment banks and an ambitious replenishment for \r\nthe concessional lending facilities of those banks, \r\nespecially the African Development Fund and the \r\nInternational Development Association. \r\n Canada has also untied all of its food aid and has \r\ncommitted to untie all bilateral assistance by 2013. Not \r\nonly will this improve aid by increasing its impact, it \r\nwill enable us to respond better to the needs of \r\ndeveloping countries. Private sector expansion is an \r\nimportant component of overall development. Canada \r\nis a significant economic partner for Africa, with more \r\nthan 290 Canadian companies operating in over 36 \r\ncountries.  \r\n The Canadian Government applauds the decision \r\nto fully integrate the secretariat of the New Partnership \r\nfor Africa’s Development — a programme dedicated to \r\naccelerating cooperation and development on the \r\ncontinent — into the African Union’s structure and \r\nbudget.  \r\n Canada sees the development of key African \r\nmultilateral institutions, such as the African Union \r\n(AU), the United Nations Economic Commission for \r\nAfrica and the African Development Bank, as vehicles \r\nto help achieve an enabling environment for stability \r\nand socio-economic development. Canada also strongly \r\nsupports the African Peer Review Mechanism as an \r\nimportant initiative, vital to the overall success of \r\nAfrica’s development. \r\nA/65/PV.31  \r\n \r\n10-58713 10 \r\n \r\n At the same time, Canada has maintained a strong \r\ncommitment to regional and multilateral initiatives to \r\nadvance global malaria prevention and control efforts. \r\nLast month, Prime Minister Harper of Canada \r\nannounced that with our contribution of $540 million \r\nto the Global Fund, Canada’s contribution to date will \r\nrise to more than $1.5 billion. \r\n Canada has long been engaged with our African \r\ncounterparts in finding durable solutions to protracted \r\nconflicts across the continent, both through direct \r\nbilateral contacts and through engagement in support \r\nfor continental and regional African institutions such as \r\nthe AU and the Economic Community of West African \r\nStates. These organizations are increasingly \r\ndemonstrating clear leadership and capacity to address \r\nthe current peace and security challenges on the \r\ncontinent, as well as to prevent future violent conflicts \r\nand political crises.  \r\n In the Sudan, the ongoing conflict and resulting \r\nhumanitarian crisis in Darfur continue to be of concern. \r\nDelays in the preparations for the two referendums \r\nmandated by the Comprehensive Peace Agreement \r\n(CPA) on the future status of South Sudan and the \r\nAbyei region are reaching a critical stage. In order to \r\nmaintain peace and stability, a range of post-\r\nreferendum issues also need to be negotiated. \r\n Since 2006, Canada has contributed over $800 \r\nmillion in support of peace and humanitarian \r\nobjectives in the Sudan, including support for CPA \r\nimplementation and the Darfur peace process. Canada’s \r\nsupport has included partnering with African countries \r\nthat contribute personnel to the Sudan’s two Security \r\nCouncil-mandated peacekeeping missions. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n In the Great Lakes region, Canada continues to \r\nplay a strong leadership role as co-Chair with the \r\nEuropean Union of the group of special envoys and \r\nfriends to the International Conference on the Great \r\nLakes Region to support regional solutions to the \r\ncomplex development and peace and security \r\nchallenges in the region. In that regard, there has been \r\nmuch progress in the past year between countries in the \r\nGreat Lakes region and international partners towards \r\nadvancing a regional certification mechanism for \r\nminerals, which are driving the conflict in the eastern \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and destabilizing \r\nthe region. \r\n In the context of support for stability in the Great \r\nLakes region, Canada has provided over $124 million \r\nfor humanitarian and development assistance to the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo since 2006. Canada \r\nis also contributing to peace and security in the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo through active \r\ndiplomatic engagement, support to the United Nations \r\nOrganization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo by deploying up to 12 Canadian \r\nforces personnel, who occupy key positions, and by \r\nannually committing $4 million for the period 2010-\r\n2013. \r\n Canada continues to support efforts to bring \r\nstability and provide humanitarian assistance to \r\nSomalia. Canada participates in the International \r\nContact Group on Somalia and has provided more than \r\n$72 million in humanitarian assistance since December \r\n2006 to help respond to the urgent needs of Somalis \r\nand Somali refugees in Kenya. \r\n In conclusion, Africa has achieved much success \r\nover the past few years. Canada joins our African \r\npartners in acknowledging that progress. The African \r\ncontinent is an area of great promise and substantial \r\npotential. Through coordinated African-led \r\ncommitments and partnerships, this potential must be \r\nrealized. \r\n Mr. Sumi (Japan): It is my great pleasure and \r\nhonour to address the Assembly today to discuss the \r\nimportant agenda items relating to African \r\ndevelopment. \r\n African development is today one of the most \r\nurgent priorities for the world and for the United \r\nNations. In May 2008, we heard the voices of Africa’s \r\nleaders at the fourth Tokyo International Conference on \r\nAfrican Development (TICAD IV), co-organized by \r\nthe Office of the Special Adviser on Africa, the United \r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP), the World \r\nBank and Japan. It is now time for us to report to the \r\nAssembly on how we have responded to those voices. \r\nAt TICAD IV, Japan pledged, first, to double its \r\nofficial development assistance to Africa, secondly, to \r\nproactively and flexibly provide up to $4 billion in soft \r\nloans and, thirdly, to work to double Japanese private \r\ninvestment in Africa over the next five years. \r\n In implementing those commitments, the \r\nGovernment of Japan established a TICAD follow-up \r\nmechanism as a framework for monitoring the \r\nimplementation of the Yokohama Action Plan. After the \r\n A/65/PV.31\r\n \r\n11 10-58713 \r\n \r\nfirst TICAD ministerial follow-up meeting in \r\nBotswana in March 2009, a second ministerial meeting \r\nwas held in Tanzania in May 2010, with participants \r\nfrom 65 countries. At that meeting, Japan pledged to \r\nstep up its Millennium Development Goals-related \r\nassistance by appropriating approximately $1 billion, \r\nbeginning this year, until the next TICAD ministerial \r\nfollow-up meeting. The Government of Japan also \r\npromised to make even greater use of official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) loans for infrastructure \r\nprojects, namely, up to $2 billion in the next two years. \r\n Japanese ODA to Africa covers a wide range of \r\nsectors, including infrastructure, agriculture, trade and \r\ninvestment, community development, health, \r\neducation, water, the consolidation of peace and good \r\ngovernance and combating climate change. These areas \r\ncorrespond to the key sectoral priorities of the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) and \r\nreflect the genuine needs of Africa. \r\n For example, food security in Africa is an \r\nimportant issue. On the occasion of TICAD IV, the \r\nJapan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) \r\nlaunched an initiative known as the Coalition for \r\nAfrican Rice Development, in partnership with the \r\nAlliance for a Green Revolution in Africa, in order to \r\nsupport the efforts of African countries to increase rice \r\nproduction. Japan entrusted $100 million to the World \r\nBank through two Japanese trust funds to support rice-\r\nproducing organizations and the African Rice \r\nDevelopment Initiative. Twenty-three African countries \r\nhave already benefited from these activities. \r\n Also, as part of TICAD joint-partner efforts to \r\nincrease irrigated land area in Africa by 20 per cent by \r\n2013, Japan intends to construct and improve irrigation \r\nfacilities and increase the irrigation capacity of African \r\ncountries by over 100,000 hectares. By the end of \r\nMarch 2010, commitments had already been made to \r\ncover 30,000 hectares. JICA, the World Bank, the \r\nAfrican Development Bank and other financial \r\ninstitutions are collaborating in that regard. \r\n Furthermore, Japan has supported the NEPAD-\r\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and \r\nDevelopment African investment initiative, which aims \r\nto improve African capacity to strengthen the \r\ninvestment environment for growth and development. \r\nSince 2005, Japan has provided a total of €0.9 million \r\nto that initiative. Along with South Africa, we have \r\nco-chaired the initiative’s steering group to facilitate \r\nregion-wide dialogue on investment policy. \r\n Climate change is one of the most pressing issues \r\nin Africa. In 2008, Japan contributed $92 million to the \r\nAfrican adaptation programme implemented by UNDP. \r\nThe programme mainly focuses on building effective \r\nleadership, institutional frameworks and national and \r\nregional capacity to cope with natural hazards \r\nassociated with climate change, as well as on \r\nrenewable energy as a mitigation measure. The \r\nnecessary resources have been allocated to 20 African \r\ncountries, with projects already in place in all those \r\ncountries. \r\n In promoting cooperation between Africa and \r\nJapan, we fully respect local leadership, ownership and \r\npartnership, in keeping with NEPAD core principles \r\nand values. We regard these principles as essential to \r\nthe promotion of sustainable development in Africa. In \r\norder to ensure that the desired accelerated growth will \r\nbenefit and empower individuals and communities and \r\nnot aggravate social and economic disparities, the \r\nconcept of human security needs to be taken into \r\nconsideration, in particular in implementing the policy \r\nmeasures aimed at achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. \r\n Japan recognizes the increasingly important role \r\nplayed by the African Union in the field of \r\ndevelopment, as demonstrated by the integration of \r\nNEPAD into its structures and processes. Also, Japan \r\nwelcomes the Commission of the African Union as a \r\nnew co-organizer of TICAD. \r\n Since its inception, the TICAD process has \r\nattached great importance to South-South Cooperation, \r\nwhich has now been adopted by a wide range of \r\nTICAD partners. For example, as a form of triangular \r\ncooperation, JICA launched its Asia-Africa Knowledge \r\nCo-Creation Programme in 2005. This subprogramme, \r\nwhich focuses on total quality management for better \r\nhospital services, was launched in 2007 by TICAD IV \r\nas one of its flagship programmes in order to respond \r\nto the challenges faced by the African region, including \r\nthe chronic shortage of financial, logistic and human \r\nresources. Sri Lanka plays a vital role in the \r\nProgramme by introducing its experience in hospital \r\nmanagement. A total of 15 African countries currently \r\nbenefit from the Programme. \r\n Let me now touch upon the Roll Back Malaria \r\ncampaign. Last month at the United Nations High-level \r\nA/65/PV.31  \r\n \r\n10-58713 12 \r\n \r\nPlenary Meeting on the Millennium Development \r\nGoals, the international community renewed its \r\ncommitment to achieve the Goals by 2015. At the \r\nmeeting, Prime Minister Naoto Kan announced Japan’s \r\npromises, including $5 billion in assistance over the \r\nnext five years in the area of health, where progress is \r\nparticularly slow. Furthermore, to demonstrate to the \r\ninternational community an ideal way of providing \r\nassistance in the field of maternal and child health, \r\nJapan has proposed an assistance model called \r\nEMBRACE — which stands for Ensure Mothers and \r\nBabies Regular Access to Care. Malaria prevention and \r\ncontrol is an essential part of implementing the \r\nEMBRACE model, to ensure that more children’s lives \r\nare saved. \r\n In the field of tackling malaria, the Global Fund \r\nhas played an outstanding role and achieved excellent \r\nresults, as evidenced by its having saved the lives of \r\n5.7 million people. Many of these lives have been \r\nsaved through the provision of 122 million long-lasting \r\ninsecticide-treated nets, including the Olyset net \r\ndeveloped by a Japanese company. \r\n At the Global Fund’s third Voluntary \r\nReplenishment and Pledging Conference, held here in \r\nNew York on 5 October, the Government of Japan \r\npledged to make contributions to the Global Fund in \r\nthe coming years amounting to $800 million, starting \r\nin 2011. As one of its founders and as a major donor, \r\nJapan will further reinforce its efforts to deliver the \r\nnecessary assistance to people in need and to promote \r\nhuman security through the Global Fund. Under our \r\nglobal health policy, Japan will aim to enhance the \r\ncomplementarity of its bilateral assistance and the \r\nprogrammes supported by the Global Fund and other \r\nmultilateral organizations, thereby increasing synergy. \r\n In conclusion, my delegation would like to \r\nreaffirm Japan’s long-term commitments and \r\ncontributions to the development of Africa as a \r\ncontinent of hope and opportunity. \r\n Mr. António (Mozambique): I wish to reiterate \r\nthe commitment expressed during the general debate \r\nby the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of \r\nMozambique to render all our support to you, \r\nMr. President, in the successful discharge of your noble \r\nduties. \r\n My delegation aligns itself with the statements \r\nmade by the representative of Yemen on behalf of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China and by the representative of \r\nMalawi on behalf of the Group of African States. \r\n It is with great interest that my delegation \r\nparticipates in this joint debate on issues of \r\nfundamental importance for Africa. I would like to \r\nfocus Mozambique’s contribution on one agenda item, \r\nnamely, “2001-2010: Decade to Roll Back Malaria in \r\nDeveloping Countries, Particularly in Africa”. In that \r\nregard, I wish to commend the Director-General of the \r\nWorld Health Organization for the report before us \r\ntoday on the progress made to achieve the goals for the \r\nDecade (see A/65/210). \r\n We note with encouragement that the report gives \r\nevidence of the positive trends generated by the \r\nDecade to Roll Back Malaria as a result of giving this \r\ndisease high priority on the international health agenda \r\nand mobilizing the much-needed political, technical \r\nand financial support for the various efforts to control \r\nand eliminate the disease, where possible, and to \r\nensure adequate investment in research leading to its \r\neradication. \r\n Indeed, amid challenges posed by the inability of \r\nhigh-burden countries to adequately provide universal \r\ncoverage, the report indicates that the initiative has \r\nbeen widely publicized and currently enjoys pledged \r\nfinancial support amounting to $1 billion per year in \r\nthe form of grants and loans, which will allow for \r\nintensive and wide-scale implementation of malaria \r\ncontrol activities. \r\n We believe that these achievements were possible \r\ndue to four central factors: first, the emphasis placed \r\non malaria control instead of eradication; secondly, the \r\nfocus on sub Saharan Africa, one of the major risk \r\nareas; thirdly, the global partnership between \r\ndevelopment agencies, banks, the private sector, \r\nnon-governmental organizations, foundations and a \r\nnetwork of researchers; and, fourthly, the promotion of \r\nlocal capacities and health systems so that malaria can \r\nbe dealt with locally. \r\n As we strive to keep the momentum generated by \r\nthe Decade to Roll Back Malaria, we should seize the \r\nopportunity created by the High-level Meeting on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals to further the \r\nsuccessful interventions made so far towards universal \r\ncoverage. To this end, there is a pressing need for \r\ninformation about the efficacy and the cost-\r\neffectiveness of different interventions, so as to lead \r\n A/65/PV.31\r\n \r\n13 10-58713 \r\n \r\npolicymakers to better use the available resources and \r\nobtain the maximum possible social benefits. \r\n At this juncture, I would like to highlight some of \r\nthe achievements of Mozambique’s national malaria \r\ncontrol programme in addressing the question of \r\nmortality due to malaria in the course of the Decade. \r\n Available data indicate that Mozambique is not \r\nyet positioned to achieve pre-elimination status. \r\nTherefore, our Government’s five-year plan and its \r\npoverty eradication strategy envisage bold measures to \r\nstrategically develop national systems and capacities in \r\nthe health sector and to increase the coverage and \r\nquality of interventions that can allow the country to \r\nmove to pre elimination status sooner rather than later. \r\n As in many malaria risk developing countries, in \r\nMozambique the disease has shown to have not only \r\ndetrimental health effects but also adverse \r\nconsequences for economic and social development. \r\nFor example, approximately 99 per cent of the \r\npopulation lives in areas at risk of malaria, and the \r\ncountry is prone to natural disasters that can contribute \r\nto dramatic increases in malaria transmission. \r\n Malaria accounts for a high percentage of \r\nMozambique’s disease burden, with children under \r\nfive, pregnant women, socially disadvantaged groups \r\nand people living with HIV/AIDS being the most \r\nvulnerable. In addition, the risk is higher in rural areas \r\nthan in urban areas. Malaria is also responsible for up \r\nto 44 per cent of all outpatient consultations and 57 per \r\ncent of paediatric admissions and is a leading cause of \r\nlow birth weight in newborns. Apart from its direct \r\nimpact on health, malaria imposes an enormous \r\nsocio-economic burden on local communities and the \r\ncountry as a whole, especially for the poorest segments \r\nof the population. \r\n Nevertheless, in the past three years, the country \r\nhas experienced a reduction in malaria mortality rates, \r\nincluding in patient cases and deaths. Our experience \r\nindicates that the combination of four major control \r\nmethods — vector control with indoor residual \r\nspraying, the distribution of conventional mosquito \r\nnets, disease management and emergency and epidemic \r\npreparedness and response — is more effective and has \r\nproduced a rapid decline in malaria morbidity and \r\nmortality. \r\n Similarly, the combination of indoor residual \r\nspraying, intermittent preventive treatment and \r\nartemisinin-based combination therapy seems to have \r\nplayed an important role in achieving the present level \r\nof malaria control in Mozambique. As a result, \r\nMozambique has taken significant steps in reducing the \r\nburden of malaria by more than 75 per cent in reported \r\ncases since 2006, with a decrease in the number of \r\ndeaths of more than 40 per cent in the same period. \r\n Our approach to malaria control includes \r\ninterventions in the Southern Africa region, as malaria \r\ndoes not recognize national borders. In this context, \r\nindoor residual spraying in the provinces of Maputo \r\nand Gaza has benefited from the regional approach \r\nthrough support from the Lubombo Spatial \r\nDevelopment Initiative, a tri country collaborative \r\ninitiative to fight malaria in the region spanning \r\nMozambique, South Africa and Swaziland. We believe \r\nthat through regional collaboration, and not only \r\nfocusing on diagnosis and treatment but also expanding \r\nvector-control operations, extensive progress will be \r\nmade in controlling malaria. \r\n As indicated in the report before us, national \r\nleadership and sound strategic measures, coupled with \r\ninternational political will and adequate financial \r\nresources, can increase the coverage of malaria \r\ninterventions and reduce the socio economic burden \r\nthat the disease represents to the development of our \r\ncountries. We believe that only intensive malaria \r\ncontrol efforts will help African countries reduce child \r\nmortality by two thirds by 2015, as envisaged in the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. Therefore, a much \r\nlarger infusion of resources than those currently \r\navailable is needed to make headway in the fight to roll \r\nback malaria. We therefore seize this opportunity to \r\nappeal to our partners to keep their financial \r\ncommitments in support of interventions to roll back \r\nmalaria. \r\n The challenges before us in addressing the weak \r\nhealth and data collection systems, poor infrastructure, \r\nlack of human resources and international funding \r\nrequire that we redouble our efforts to reduce by half \r\nthe deaths due to malaria in Africa and to halt the \r\ndisease and begin to reverse its incidence by 2015. \r\n I would like to conclude by stressing that, based \r\non the progress made so far and the commitments \r\nadhered to by various partners, we are confident that \r\nuniversal access will soon be a reality and that together \r\nwe can beat malaria. The Government of Mozambique \r\nA/65/PV.31  \r\n \r\n10-58713 14 \r\n \r\nremains committed to accelerating and redoubling its \r\nefforts to control this scourge. \r\n Mr. Daoud (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): My \r\ncountry’s delegation would first like to congratulate \r\nMr. Deiss on his election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-fifth session. We trust that under \r\nhis wise and able leadership the Assembly will achieve \r\nimportant accomplishments. My country’s delegation \r\nwould also like to express its support for his efforts and \r\npledges its cooperation with him in ensuring the \r\nsuccess of this session. \r\n We also wish to associate ourselves with the \r\nstatement delivered by the representative of brotherly \r\nYemen on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, and the \r\nstatement delivered by the representative of Malawi on \r\nbehalf of the Group of African States. \r\n Africa has achieved great progress since the \r\nlaunch of the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD), a partnership that expresses \r\nthe commitment and determination of the States of \r\nAfrica to put the continent on the path of economic and \r\nsocial growth by taking control of their own \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Today, as we have crossed the halfway point \r\ntowards the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) by 2015, Africa is still the \r\nonly continent suffering from obstacles on its path to \r\nthe full elimination of poverty and need. Therefore, \r\nmore concerted effort by the international community \r\nis needed to implement the global partnership for \r\ndevelopment and to effectively fulfil development \r\nobligations without delay. \r\n Meeting Africa’s development needs, evaluating \r\nthe status of implementation of various obligations, \r\novercoming challenges and determining the way \r\nforward are all part of enhancing the global partnership \r\nfor development in Africa. The political declaration on \r\nAfrica’s development needs (resolution 63/1) \r\nreaffirmed the commitment by the heads of State and \r\nGovernment, ministers and representatives of States \r\nMembers of the United Nations to address Africa’s \r\nspecial needs as contained in the Millennium \r\nDeclaration (resolution 55/2), the United Nations \r\nDeclaration on the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (resolution 57/2), the Monterrey \r\nConsensus of the International Conference on \r\nFinancing for Development, the Plan of \r\nImplementation of the World Summit on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, and the 2005 World Summit Outcome \r\n(resolution 60/1). \r\n The role of regional organizations in \r\npeacebuilding in Africa is important for the \r\nachievement of sustainable peace, especially in post-\r\nconflict States. In this forum, we call for the full \r\nimplementation of the 10 year plan to build African \r\npeacekeeping capacity and enhance the regional \r\nconsultative process in order to ensure effective \r\nsupport for the African Union and its programmes \r\npertaining to NEPAD. \r\n Despite some progress, the current framework for \r\nservicing the debt of low-income countries is \r\ninsufficient. There is a need to expand the scope of the \r\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative and \r\nthe Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative. Also, African \r\ncountries need to be able to overcome the challenges \r\nthat prevent them from attaining their HIPC \r\ncompletion points. \r\n Creating a peaceful environment is a prerequisite \r\nfor economic and social development. The Sudan has a \r\ndistinguished role in sustaining peace. Arrangements \r\nfor sharing wealth are among the main elements of the \r\nthree peace agreements. The fact that the Sudan has \r\njoined the African Peer Review Mechanism has paved \r\nthe way towards government bodies implementing the \r\nMechanism, with a role given to interested civil society \r\nand private sector actors. We have also set up a \r\nprogramme within this framework to empower women, \r\nspread democracy, raise accountability and enhance the \r\nrule of law. \r\n Half of the world’s population suffers from \r\nmalaria or the risk of malaria. More than 3.3 billion \r\npeople have been affected by the disease, which killed \r\nalmost a million in 2008. Most of the Sudan’s \r\npopulation is threatened by malaria, and over 7 million \r\npersons a year are infected, of whom 35,000 die. \r\n Scientific studies indicate that the negative \r\nimpact of climate change has increased the rate of \r\ninfection. High temperatures help increase the lifespan \r\nof mosquitoes that carry the disease, which directly \r\naffects economic and social development in the \r\ncountry. Therefore the Sudan has drawn up a national \r\nstrategy to combat malaria and has created a \r\nspecialized unit to fight the disease. It focuses on \r\nstrengthening means of managing the spread of the \r\ndisease and on intensifying monitoring operations. \r\n A/65/PV.31\r\n \r\n15 10-58713 \r\n \r\nThat approach has helped us to develop effective tools \r\nand methods for prevention and treatment. \r\n The international economic slowdown, the rise in \r\nthe prices of foodstuffs and climate change all limit the \r\nachievement of tangible progress in implementing \r\nNEPAD and in combating the spread of malaria. Thus \r\nthey threaten our ability to achieve the MDGs by 2015. \r\nAfrican countries and development partners must show \r\ndetermination and clear leadership in order to achieve \r\nreal reform in the areas of debt relief and the \r\ninternational trade system. Such reform should \r\nfacilitate the membership of developing countries in \r\nthe World Trade Organization and increase the amount \r\nof official development assistance. In addition, to \r\nachieve the Goals by the set date, that assistance must \r\nbe strengthened and aligned with national ownership \r\nand the development programmes and plans of \r\ndeveloping countries, because development is a \r\ncollective responsibility and must be achieved through \r\nequitable international partnership. \r\n Mr. Sipangule (Zambia): The Zambian \r\ndelegation has the honour to address the Assembly on \r\nthe agenda item entitled “2001-2010: Decade to Roll \r\nBack Malaria in Developing Countries, Particularly in \r\nAfrica”. Zambia notes with appreciation the report of \r\nthe World Health Organization on the item, contained \r\nin document A/65/210, which my delegation has found \r\nvery useful. \r\n My delegation also aligns itself with the \r\nstatement delivered by the delegate of Malawi, the \r\ncurrent Chair of the African Union, on behalf of the \r\nAfrican Group. \r\n Zambia, as Chair of the Roll Back Malaria Board, \r\nwishes to reiterate that, while we recognize that some \r\ncountries have almost eliminated malaria from their list \r\nof public health challenges, it is still a major public \r\nhealth concern in others. The burden of malaria is \r\nhighest among children under five years of age, \r\npregnant women and the vulnerable in society. In \r\naddition to its direct health impact, malaria causes \r\nsevere social and economic burdens on individuals, \r\nhouseholds and indeed communities at large. Thus in \r\nZambia, malaria control has been prioritized in the \r\nbasic health-care package, the National Health \r\nStrategic Plans and the National Malaria Strategic Plan. \r\n The Zambian Government strongly believes that \r\nevery Zambian has a fundamental right to access to \r\neffective malaria control, preventive and curative \r\ntreatments and care. The Government also ensures \r\nthose services are delivered as close to the home as \r\npossible. The Government and its cooperating partners \r\nhave established institutional structures and strategies \r\nto ensure universal coverage. \r\n The Zambian Government has put in place \r\nmalaria prevention interventions that include, inter \r\nalia, indoor residual spraying, long-lasting insecticide-\r\ntreated nets and intermittent preventive treatment for \r\npregnant women. The curative interventions are \r\nenshrined in prompt and effective case management \r\nactivities, which focus primarily on providing care for \r\nthose who are suffering from malaria. \r\n In order to improve malaria treatment, in 2004 \r\nthe Zambian Government revised its malaria treatment \r\npolicy by switching from the use of chloroquine as the \r\nfirst-line treatment to the more efficacious artemisinin \r\ncombination therapy. The drug of choice is artemether-\r\nlumefantrine, which is available free of charge in all \r\npublic health facilities throughout the country. \r\n Zambia has achieved remarkable reductions in \r\nthe incidence of malaria over the recent past, and that \r\nhas been attributed to the integrated approach in \r\nmalaria control activities. As indicated in the above-\r\nmentioned report of the World Health Organization, the \r\nuse of bednets in Zambia has reduced the number of \r\nmalaria cases by 50 per cent over the past decade. \r\n However, Zambia is committed to cooperating \r\nwith the World Health Organization and other \r\ncooperating partners in efforts to further reduce the \r\nincidence of malaria. In that regard, I wish to take this \r\nopportunity to inform the Assembly that Zambia will \r\nbe convening an international meeting of the Roll Back \r\nMalaria Partnership Board from 6 to 8 December in \r\nLusaka, the Zambian capital, at which participants will \r\nlearn from each other’s experiences in the last decade. \r\nIt is my delegation’s hope that the Roll Back Malaria \r\npartnerships and other cooperating partners will attend \r\nthat important meeting. \r\n Despite the remarkable progress in controlling \r\nmalaria in Zambia, a number of challenges still remain. \r\nThey include late disbursement of committed funds, \r\nparticularly by our cooperating partners, low utilization \r\nrates for insecticide-treated nets and inadequate human \r\nresources. We therefore call upon the international \r\ncommunity, particularly our cooperating partners, to \r\ncontinue to extend assistance to the Roll Back Malaria \r\nA/65/PV.31  \r\n \r\n10-58713 16 \r\n \r\nprogramme and also to our countries in the fight \r\nagainst this number-one killer disease, malaria. \r\n Mr. Shin Boonam (Republic of Korea): African \r\ndevelopment is a key to the promotion of peace and \r\nprosperity in the world. The political, economic and \r\nsocial development of Africa is an important task for \r\nthe international community as a whole. The New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) well \r\nrepresents our collective vision and holistic approach \r\nto African development. \r\n As the world leaders agreed during the High-level \r\nPlenary Meeting of the General Assembly on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), Africa’s \r\nslow and uneven progress towards achievement of the \r\nMDGs, further hindered by the recent multiple crises, \r\nrequires greater attention from the world. To meet the \r\ntarget deadline of achieving the MDGs by 2015, the \r\ninternational community needs to be more involved in \r\nproviding assistance to the continent. In that regard we \r\nmust recognize that official development assistance has \r\nbeen an essential tool in meeting African development \r\nneeds. Recent challenges should not impede the \r\ngalvanizing of joint efforts. \r\n We are fully aware of the need to ensure adequate \r\nresources and to implement our promises. The \r\nRepublic of Korea is fully implementing its \r\ncommitment to double its official development \r\nassistance to Africa by 2012, compared to 2008, as it \r\ndeclared on the occasion of the second Korea-Africa \r\nForum. \r\n We would like to highlight the idea that \r\ndevelopment cooperation with Africa should start with \r\nthe identification of countries’ specific needs and \r\nconditions. There is no “one size fits all” model for \r\ndevelopment cooperation. \r\n The Republic of Korea has strived to gain a \r\ndeeper understanding of Africa’s specific demands and \r\npriorities and to come up with feasible means to meet \r\nthose needs by making full use of channels of dialogue \r\nsuch as the Korea-Africa Forum and the Korea-Africa \r\nEconomic Cooperation Conference. Those events have \r\nserved as useful opportunities to enhance mutually \r\nbeneficial partnerships in sectors such as education, \r\nagricultural and rural development and information and \r\ntelecommunication technologies. \r\n As a country that in recent history successfully \r\ntransformed itself from recipient to donor country, we \r\nhave focused in particular on sharing our development \r\nexperiences. In that regard, the Korean Government \r\nhas delivered on its commitment to increase to 5,000 \r\nthe number of participants from Africa — including \r\npublic officials, researchers and engineers — who take \r\npart in our training programmes. We have also \r\nincreased to over 1,000 the number of World Friends \r\nKorea volunteers in African partner countries over the \r\nnext two years. We believe that that will contribute to \r\nbolstering Africa’s economic and social development \r\nby fostering quality human resources. \r\n A large number of populations in Africa still \r\nremain vulnerable to a wide range of health issues, \r\nincluding HIV/AIDS and malaria. The mobilization of \r\nresources is crucial in responding to those challenges. \r\nThe Republic of Korea, which is a pioneer country in \r\nthe introduction of innovative financing for \r\ndevelopment, such as the air-ticket solidarity levy, has \r\nallocated a significant portion of revenue to fighting \r\nthose diseases through funding for UNITAID, the \r\nInternational Drug Purchase Facility, and GAVI, the \r\nGlobal Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization \r\n Integrating African countries into the multilateral \r\ntrading system is critical to achieving their sustainable \r\ndevelopment. In that regard, the Republic of Korea \r\nbelieves that the successful conclusion of the Doha \r\nRound will promote development in Africa and, \r\nconsequently, the growth of global trade. We fully \r\nrecognize the importance of ensuring that least \r\ndeveloped countries (LDCs) in Africa have duty-free \r\nand quota-free market access. We are guaranteeing the \r\naccess of LDCs’ products to the Korean market. \r\n As the Chair of the Group of 20 (G-20) Summit \r\nthis year, the Republic of Korea will invite two African \r\ncountries — Malawi, as Chair of the African Union, \r\nand Ethiopia, as Chair of NEPAD — to the Summit to \r\nbe held next month in Seoul. For the first time at a \r\nG-20 Summit, the development issue will be discussed \r\nas an integral agenda item in the G-20 process. A multi \r\nyear action plan on eight development pillars will be \r\nadopted at the Seoul Summit. \r\n Africa has significant potential as a future driving \r\nforce of global economic growth. The assistance of the \r\ninternational community is indispensable for the \r\nrealization of the continent’s development potential. It \r\nis in our common interest to support Africa’s efforts to \r\nachieve sustainable development through an enhanced \r\ndevelopment partnership. \r\n A/65/PV.31\r\n \r\n17 10-58713 \r\n \r\n As the saying goes, good company on the road is \r\na shortcut. The Republic of Korea will be good \r\ncompany along the road to African development. \r\n Mr. Feleke (Ethiopia): Allow me at the outset to \r\nexpress my delegation’s appreciation to the President \r\nfor convening this plenary meeting, which is of great \r\nimportance for developing countries and for Africa in \r\nparticular. I would also like to express our deep \r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for his leadership \r\nand commitment to putting Africa’s agenda at the \r\nforefront of the work of the United Nations system. \r\n My delegation fully associates itself with the \r\nstatements delivered this morning on the agenda items \r\nunder consideration by the representative of Yemen, on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China, and by the \r\nrepresentative of Malawi, on behalf of the African \r\nGroup. \r\n Ethiopia also welcomes the reports of the \r\nSecretary-General (A/65/152, A/65/165 and A/65/167) \r\nunder agenda items 62 and 12. \r\n As the Secretary-General has indicated in one \r\nreport (A/65/152), Africa’s leadership and political \r\nwill, social progress, sustained economic growth and \r\ngovernance reforms are slowly changing perceptions of \r\nthe continent in today’s world and that at the same \r\ntime, the impact of violent conflicts and poverty in \r\nAfrica should not be underestimated. It is also worth \r\nmentioning that the report highlights that progress has \r\nbeen recorded in the implementation of the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), in \r\nmoving forward the African Peer Review Mechanism \r\nand in increasing official development assistance to \r\nAfrica. \r\n We are also of the view that the integration of the \r\nnewly established NEPAD Planning and Coordinating \r\nAgency into the African Union Commission structure \r\nand process has generated new momentum in the \r\nimplementation of NEPAD priority areas. \r\n NEPAD, as a programme of the African Union, is \r\nan integral socio economic development framework for \r\nAfrica. African countries are therefore collectively and \r\nindividually implementing the sector-specific strategic \r\npriority areas identified within NEPAD, such as those \r\nof agriculture, infrastructure, good governance, \r\ninvestment, health and education. African countries \r\nhave also committed themselves to achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) by, among \r\nother things, allocating 10 per cent of their budgets to \r\nagriculture, 15 per cent to health and 20 per cent to \r\neducation. \r\n The African Union has also committed itself to \r\ngood governance through the adoption of several \r\ninstruments, including the African Peer Review \r\nMechanism. The Mechanism is a self-monitoring \r\ninstrument with a mandate to encourage participating \r\nStates to ensure that their policies and practices \r\nconform to the agreed political, economic and \r\ncorporate governance values, codes and standards, as \r\nwell as to achieve mutually agreed objectives on the \r\nsocio economic track, as set out in the Declaration on \r\nDemocracy, Political, Economic and Corporate \r\nGovernance. So far, 30 countries have become \r\nmembers of the Mechanism. \r\n In keeping with the provisions of NEPAD, the \r\ninternational community has also committed itself to \r\nmoving forward the vision of NEPAD, as indicated in \r\nthe report of the Secretary-General. However, much \r\nremains to be done if Africa is to extricate itself from \r\nthe problems it faces and assume its rightful place in \r\nthe international community. We share the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s view that firm determination and leadership \r\nare required on the part of us Africans and international \r\ndevelopment partners alike, so that it is possible to \r\nachieve the goals that NEPAD has envisaged. Indeed, \r\nif Africa is meaningfully supported in achieving \r\nsustainable development, we can move from managing \r\nchronic poverty to helping Africa achieve durable \r\neconomic growth and social development. \r\n When it considered Africa’s development needs \r\nin the General Assembly two years ago, the \r\ninternational community declared (resolution 63/1) that \r\nit was concerned that Africa’s share of international \r\ntrade was only 2 per cent. It also underlined the \r\nimportant role that trade played in promoting economic \r\ngrowth. It also asserted that the high-level meeting \r\nrepresented a unique opportunity to strengthen global \r\nleadership and partnership for development in Africa, \r\nwhich is pivotal to bringing Africa into the mainstream \r\nof the global economy. \r\n It is our hope and expectation that the current \r\nround of trade negotiations of the World Trade \r\nOrganization (WTO) will be concluded with a \r\nsuccessful development-oriented outcome, as initially \r\nconceived. In particular, while we appreciate the \r\nmarket-access initiatives in favour of Africa by \r\nA/65/PV.31  \r\n \r\n10-58713 18 \r\n \r\nMember States, we would like to remind the \r\ninternational community that, if the global partnership \r\nfor Africa is to be strengthened and, indeed, if the \r\ncontinent is to integrate in and fully benefit from the \r\nglobalizing economy, then the various trade-related \r\nprovisions put forward by Africa should be included in \r\nthe WTO agreement. \r\n It is exactly 10 years since the international \r\ncommunity agreed and expressed its determination to \r\ntackle the impact of malaria in developing countries, \r\nparticularly in Africa. Over the years, a broad range of \r\nnational and international actions have been taken to \r\nalleviate the suffering of those afflicted by this disease. \r\n In that regard, my delegation welcomes with \r\nappreciation the report of the World Health \r\nOrganization (WHO) on the Decade to Roll Back \r\nMalaria (A/65/210, annex). Ethiopia is of the view that \r\nthe recommendations in that report, if duly \r\nimplemented, would further enhance our efforts to \r\ncontrol malaria, particularly in priority countries. As \r\nthe report indicates, the achievement by high-burden \r\nAfrican countries of high coverage of their populations \r\nwith bednets and treatment programmes is encouraging \r\nprogress towards meeting MDG 4 — reducing \r\nmortality rates of children under five by two thirds by \r\n2015. \r\n Notwithstanding the concerted efforts of \r\ndeveloping countries and their partners, malaria \r\ncontinues to be the major cause of morbidity and \r\nmortality on our continent. As we know, malaria affects \r\nthe most productive part of a society and impedes a \r\nnation’s socio-economic development. It is no wonder \r\nthat the nations that are hard hit by malaria are the least \r\nprosperous. The malaria epidemic is one of the \r\ndeadliest diseases in Africa. Its impact on \r\nsocio-economic development is still significant, in \r\nspite of the considerable political attention and \r\nfinancial support it has been given at the international \r\nlevel. Of the half billion people in the world vulnerable \r\nto malaria, the majority live in sub-Saharan Africa. \r\n Malaria is one of the major public health \r\nproblems in Ethiopia. Approximately 68 per cent of the \r\npopulation lives in malaria-prone areas, and 75 per cent \r\nof the country’s land mass is malaria-infested. \r\nCognizant of the impact of the malaria epidemic on the \r\nsocio-economic development of the country, Ethiopia \r\nhas long made its malaria prevention and control \r\nprogramme a priority in the social health sector. The \r\n2006-2010 national strategic plan, among others, was \r\naimed at rapidly scaling up malaria control intervention \r\nto achieve a 50 per cent reduction in the disease within \r\nthe timeline. \r\n The major achievements of that scaled-up effort \r\nhave been free distribution of 20 million insecticide-\r\ntreated bednets, provision of rapid diagnostic tests and \r\nartemisinin-based combination therapies at peripheral \r\nhealth facilities, development of district epidemic-\r\npreparedness plans, and deployment of 30,000 health \r\nextension workers for delivery of health-care services \r\nat the community level. Deaths have thus declined \r\nsubstantially, falling by 35 per cent since 1980. The \r\neffective scaling up of malaria prevention and \r\ntreatment has also resulted in dramatic declines in \r\noutpatient malaria cases and malaria-related deaths \r\namong children in malaria-endemic zones around the \r\ncountry. Recently, Ethiopia was successful in its \r\napplication for a five-year Global Fund Round.  \r\n Maintaining the achievements made so far and \r\nproducing a significant impact by reducing malaria’s \r\noverall burden by 50 per cent, thus paving the way \r\ntowards meeting MDG 4, is heavily dependent on the \r\navailability of financial and human resources. Ethiopia \r\nis boosting local efforts by stepping up its grass-roots \r\nawareness programme on prevention of the disease, but \r\nthe support of the international community is necessary \r\nin order to build on and sustain the progress. \r\n It should be emphasized that both financial and \r\ntechnical resources have contributed to Ethiopia’s \r\ncoverage and access to prevention, treatment and \r\nsupport services. The partnership has also helped \r\nstrengthen the country’s health-care system in general, \r\nincluding aspects such as monitoring and evaluation, \r\nand procurement and supply management. \r\n Ethiopia is fully implementing the five main \r\nmalaria prevention and control strategies recommended \r\nby WHO. Since malaria is an ecology-related disease, \r\nin Ethiopia the health extension programme has \r\nbrought coverage to all parts of the country. \r\n Mr. Jaber (Lebanon): My delegation thanks the \r\nPresident for organizing today’s meeting on the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), and \r\nthe Decade to Roll Back Malaria, which concludes at \r\nthe end of this year. We also thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his comprehensive reports (A/65/152, \r\nA/65/165 and A/65/167) and notes (A/65/62, \r\nA/62/Add.1 and A/65/210) on these items. \r\n A/65/PV.31\r\n \r\n19 10-58713 \r\n \r\n Lebanon associates itself with the statement \r\ndelivered by the representative of Yemen on behalf of \r\nthe Group of 77 and China, in particular its support for \r\nthe establishment of a monitoring mechanism to follow \r\nup on all commitments related to Africa’s development \r\nunder the General Assembly’s auspices. \r\n Our meeting comes not only after the conclusion \r\nof the High-level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), which recognized that \r\nmore attention should be given to Africa, but also after \r\nthe second Afro-Arab Summit held in Sirte last week, \r\njointly organized by the African Union Commission \r\nand the League of Arab States. The Summit highlighted \r\nthe strong bond between African and Arab countries \r\nand formulated a partnership strategy between the two \r\nregions in the areas of peace and security, investment \r\npromotion and trade, agriculture and food security, and \r\nsocial and cultural cooperation. \r\n The Afro-Arab Partnership Strategy is an \r\nexample of the international support inspired by \r\nNEPAD. NEPAD was adopted in 2001 by African \r\nleaders with the aim of eradicating poverty, promoting \r\nsustainable growth and development, and empowering \r\nwomen through genuine partnerships at the country, \r\nregional and global levels. The African ownership and \r\nleadership of NEPAD have led to significant progress \r\nin all areas essential to Africa’s development, such as \r\ninfrastructure, agriculture and food security, health, \r\neducation and training, environment and tourism, \r\ninformation and communications technologies, and \r\nscience and technology. \r\n Lebanon enjoys long-standing close ties with the \r\nAfrican continent. Many African countries have been \r\nhome to many Lebanese, and those friendly countries \r\nwill remain their home for many years yet to come. My \r\ndelegation fully supports the objectives of the Afro-\r\nArab Partnership Strategy aimed at realizing durable \r\npeace and security in the two regions, promoting \r\ninvestment and trade between African and Arab \r\ncountries and continuing the joint efforts to achieve the \r\nMDGs by 2015. \r\n Lebanon believes that closing the MDG gap will \r\nonly be possible if the international community steps \r\nup its support for Africa’s development and reverses \r\nthe negative impact the ongoing economic and \r\nfinancial crisis has had on African countries. In \r\nparticular, my delegation wishes to highlight the \r\nimportance of fulfilling official development assistance \r\ncommitments, continuing the granting of debt relief, \r\nrestoring and increasing foreign direct investment and \r\nexpanding access to global markets for African \r\nexports. \r\n History tells us that development cannot be \r\nsustained and countries cannot flourish if conflict and \r\ninstability persist. In that regard, we welcome the \r\nspecific commitments expressed by the African Union \r\nto ensure peace and stability on the continent as \r\ndemonstrated by its recent expanded engagement in \r\nSomalia and the Sudan. That commitment is further \r\nstrengthened by the work of the Panel of the Wise and \r\nthe Continental Early Warning System. The \r\nInternational Conference on the Great Lakes Region \r\nand the mediation initiatives carried out by the \r\nEconomic Community of West African States and the \r\nEast African Community are further examples of strong \r\nregional efforts to ensure an environment conducive to \r\nsustainable development. \r\n Nonetheless, challenges persist. Although the \r\nnumber of inter-State conflicts has declined, conflicts \r\nover natural resources, such as timber and minerals, \r\ndesertification and declining pastures, droughts and \r\nscant water resources, continue to stifle Africa’s \r\ndevelopment potential. Achieving the MDGs and \r\nsustainable economic growth is therefore a security \r\nimperative. The protection of civilians in situations of \r\narmed conflict, in particular women and children, \r\nshould thus continue to be given special attention by \r\npeacekeeping missions in order to safeguard Africa’s \r\ngreatest resource, namely, its human capital. \r\n Lebanon notes with grave concern the high toll \r\nmalaria continues to exact on Africa’s human capital, \r\nin particular its children. As of 2008, 85 per cent of \r\nmalaria cases worldwide were in Africa, threatening \r\nthe lives of over 200 million people. We therefore \r\nwelcome the launch of the African Leaders Malaria \r\nAlliance last year and the recent increased pledges to \r\nthe Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and \r\nMalaria, and we urge donors to honour their \r\ncommitments in this regard. \r\n Rolling back malaria and continuing the fight \r\nagainst HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, which continue to \r\nplague the continent, are necessary for achieving the \r\nhealth-related MDGs. Without healthy children, \r\nwomen and men and unless extreme poverty is \r\neradicated, achieving universal primary education and \r\nA/65/PV.31  \r\n \r\n10-58713 20 \r\n \r\nenabling vibrant and productive societies will not be \r\npossible. \r\n Mr. Seruhere (United Republic of Tanzania): I \r\nwant to thank the President of the Assembly for \r\nconvening this joint debate on the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development and the 2001-2010 Decade to \r\nRoll Back Malaria in Developing Countries, \r\nParticularly in Africa. \r\n Tanzania aligns itself with the statements \r\npresented by the representative of Malawi on behalf of \r\nthe African Group and by the representative of Yemen \r\non behalf of the Group of 77 and China. \r\n Tanzania welcomes the report of the World \r\nHealth Organization entitled “2001-2010: Decade to \r\nRoll Back Malaria in Developing Countries, \r\nParticularly in Africa” (A/65/210), which highlights the \r\nprogress made in meeting the goals concerning malaria \r\ncontrol to be achieved by 2010 under General \r\nAssembly resolution 62/180. We acknowledge the \r\nprogress that has been made in some parts of Africa, \r\nincluding in part of my country, the island of Zanzibar, \r\nin reversing the malaria epidemic through political \r\nengagement and sustainable national malaria control \r\nprogrammes. Zanzibar has achieved a success rate of \r\nover 99 per cent. We call for the continued engagement \r\nof the international community and other stakeholders \r\nto accelerate further gains achieved in malaria control \r\nand elimination. \r\n Malaria is among the biggest health challenges to \r\nAfrica. An estimated 74 per cent of the continent’s \r\ninhabitants live in endemic malarial areas and about \r\n95 per cent of the global 2 to 3 million deaths \r\nattributed to malaria occur in Africa. Malaria is a major \r\nkiller of children in Africa, where 24 per cent of all \r\ndeaths of children under age five are from malaria and \r\nmalaria-related illnesses. \r\n Malaria is a major economic burden in Africa, \r\nwhere it accounts for 30 to 40 per cent of outpatient \r\nvisits and 10 to 15 per cent of all disease admissions in \r\nhospitals, private clinics and health-care systems. \r\nMalaria accounts for as much as 40 per cent of health-\r\ncare spending in endemic African countries. Malaria \r\ncosts the continent $12 billion a year, and consequently \r\nmalaria has slowed economic growth by up to 1.3 per \r\ncent per year through death and lost hours of economic \r\nproductivity, as well as expended public funds and lost \r\nfamily income. Malaria is thus said to be a disease of \r\npoverty and a cause of poverty. \r\n Such statistics are a cause of great concern to \r\nAfrica and the world at large. We recognize that \r\nmalaria-related ill health and deaths throughout the \r\nworld can be substantially reduced with political \r\ncommitment and commensurate resources, increased \r\npublic awareness and sensitization about malaria \r\nprevention and availability of proper health services, \r\nparticularly in malaria-endemic countries. Yet each \r\nyear, we allow nearly 1 million deaths to occur, when \r\nthose deaths could have been prevented with the \r\nuniversal application of existing tools at our disposal. \r\n In early 2008, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \r\nappointed a Special Envoy for Malaria to mobilize \r\nglobal support for action on the disease. Following the \r\nSecretary-General’s call for universal coverage and in \r\nresponse to a growing international push for a long-\r\nterm commitment to malaria control, the malaria \r\ncommunity collectively developed the Global Malaria \r\nAction Plan. The objectives of the Plan are to \r\naccelerate and sustain malaria control efforts, \r\neliminating the disease where possible, and to ensure \r\ninvestment in research aimed at creating new tools that \r\nwould permit the eradication of the disease in the long \r\nterm. \r\n My delegation would like to congratulate the \r\nSecretary-General, His Excellency Ban Ki-moon, for \r\nhis leadership, dedication and commitment to the work \r\nof the Organization and for the new momentum he is \r\nbringing to the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). We welcome his Global \r\nStrategy for Women’s and Children’s Health and urge \r\nthe international community to provide the support \r\nnecessary for its implementation. \r\n Once again Tanzania would like to emphasize the \r\nimportance of national leadership and global \r\npartnerships for meeting the MDGs. Tanzania will do \r\nits part. We call upon partners to do their part, as \r\nstipulated under MDG 8. \r\n One such partnership that is proving successful is \r\nthe collective efforts of African leaders through the \r\nAfrican Leaders Malaria Alliance, chaired by His \r\nExcellency Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, President of the \r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania. Our focus within the \r\nAlliance is to ensure that we attain the 2010 targets for \r\nuniversal coverage of appropriate malaria prevention, \r\ndiagnosis and treatment interventions. We are confident \r\nthat, if the requested support is realized, we can attain \r\nthis target. It is for this reason that we ask for the full \r\n A/65/PV.31\r\n \r\n21 10-58713 \r\n \r\nand timely replenishment of the Global Fund to Fight \r\nAIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. \r\n All of these efforts are enshrined in the NEPAD \r\nblueprint. We therefore call on the international \r\ncommunity to render its support in meeting the \r\nobjectives of NEPAD. \r\n We also commend the partnership and support \r\nfrom our friends in the international community aimed \r\nat combating malaria. Those efforts complement the \r\nefforts of the Secretary-General. \r\n Malaria in Africa can be eliminated in our \r\nlifetime. We have the tools to make that happen. What \r\nis required now is the enhanced political will of the \r\ninternational community. Let us not only roll back \r\nmalaria but eliminate it in its entirety. We pledge our \r\npart. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nObserver of the Holy See. \r\n Archbishop Chullikatt (Holy See): As the \r\nGeneral Assembly considers the ongoing development \r\nof Africa, my delegation takes this opportunity to \r\naffirm once again the need for the countries of Africa, \r\njointly and with the support of the international \r\ncommunity, to effect the eradication of poverty, to \r\nplace African countries on the path towards sustainable \r\ngrowth and development, and to halt the \r\nmarginalization of Africa in the globalization process. \r\n Addressing the special needs of Africa requires \r\npartnerships in all areas of society. Those partnerships \r\nhelp to foster greater solidarity and promote more \r\nsustainable development throughout the continent. In \r\nthat regard, the recent decline in the global economy \r\nhas created new challenges for Africa, as foreign direct \r\ninvestments in the region have fallen by 36 per cent \r\nsince 2008. The burden of increasing debt also \r\nthreatens future sustainability and undermines the \r\nimprovements that have been achieved in recent years. \r\n We know that one of the many factors upon \r\nwhich all of this depends is the health of the African \r\npeople. As the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment programme rightly points out, the health \r\nand well-being of the African people will help bring \r\nabout the achievement of poverty reduction and \r\nsustainable development in Africa. \r\n In that regard, my delegation is grateful for the \r\nrecent report entitled “2001-2010: Decade to Roll Back \r\nMalaria in Developing Countries, Particularly in \r\nAfrica” (A/65/210), and is pleased to see that such \r\nprogress has been made over the past decade in malaria \r\ncontrol efforts. Certainly this is due, in part, to the \r\nconsiderable commitment at the international, regional \r\nand country levels. \r\n In particular, my delegation is grateful for the \r\nrecent initiative of the African Leaders Malaria \r\nAlliance, in which African heads of State and \r\nGovernment have come together in order to promote \r\nuniversal provision of malaria-control interventions. \r\nWe are heartened by the commitment of the members \r\nof the Alliance to work together to translate their \r\ncommitment into greater efforts to eradicate this \r\ndisease. \r\n Malaria takes the lives of nearly 1 million people \r\neach year, almost 90 per cent of whom reside in Africa, \r\nwith the worst affected areas being in the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria and \r\nTanzania. Approximately 3.3 billion people worldwide \r\nremain at risk of malaria, resulting in 250 million cases \r\neach year, 86 per cent of which occur in Africa. \r\n Malaria most devastatingly affects children under \r\nthe age of five. Many who survive an episode of severe \r\nmalaria suffer learning impairments or brain damage. \r\nPregnant women and their unborn children are also \r\nparticularly vulnerable to malaria, which, during \r\npregnancy, is a major cause of mortality, low birth \r\nweight and maternal anaemia. \r\n It goes without saying that our focus must remain \r\non treatment, prevention and research. Proper \r\ndiagnosis is available, and infected individuals can \r\nmake a full recovery, if provided with the means to do \r\nso. Appropriate treatment should be accessible to those \r\nwho are affected, and individuals must be able to \r\nreceive affordable, safe and, where necessary, free \r\ndiagnostic testing and drugs. \r\n We know how reduction in the transmission of \r\nmalaria is achieved and, in that regard, it is important \r\nto recall the Abuja Declaration to Roll Back Malaria in \r\nAfrica, which calls for the development of mechanisms \r\nto facilitate the provision of reliable information on \r\nmalaria to decision-makers at the household, \r\ncommunity, district and national levels, enabling them \r\nto make use of appropriate control and surveillance \r\nstrategies. \r\nA/65/PV.31  \r\n \r\n10-58713 22 \r\n \r\n Resources must continue to be allocated to \r\nongoing research into developing safe and cost-\r\nefficient vaccines, as well as medicines to treat those \r\nwho are infected. \r\n My delegation takes this opportunity to highlight \r\nthe work of numerous individuals in Catholic health-\r\ncare services working on the front lines in countries in \r\nAfrica to assist those suffering from malaria. The \r\nselfless service of those individuals as well as so many \r\nothers demonstrates their commitment to the well-\r\nbeing of the human family, especially those who are \r\nsuffering. \r\n These organizations not only provide the \r\nresources and technical skills necessary to assist those \r\naffected by malaria but have also worked to foster \r\ngreater development throughout Africa. Working in the \r\nfields of education, infrastructure and health-care \r\nprogrammes, often in the poorest and most vulnerable \r\ncommunities, those organizations are vital partners in \r\nthe long-term development of Africa. \r\n The Acting President: In accordance with \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 49/2 of 19 October 1994, \r\nI now call on the observer for the International \r\nFederation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. \r\n Mr. Jilani (International Federation of Red Cross \r\nand Red Crescent Societies): Despite the many \r\nsuccesses in combating malaria, that killer disease \r\ncontinues to take the lives of nearly 1 million people \r\nevery year, mostly children under the age of five; and, \r\nas we all know, malaria is a disease that is 100 per cent \r\npreventable and treatable. \r\n We have seen that countries that have achieved \r\nhigh coverage of their population with mosquito nets, \r\nas well as improved access to effective diagnostics and \r\ntreatment, have made enormous progress in the fight \r\nagainst malaria. Countries such as Eritrea, Rwanda, \r\nZambia, Tanzania and Sao Tome and Principe have \r\nseen reductions in malaria cases and deaths by up to \r\n50 per cent, demonstrating that the targets of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals can be achieved. \r\n The malaria programmes implemented by \r\nnational Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have \r\nfocused on scaling up network ownership and ensuring \r\nthat net distribution is accompanied by extensive and \r\nprolonged community education and empowerment \r\nefforts. In various affected countries, it has been shown \r\nthat combining net distribution with follow-on “hang \r\nup” campaigns, carried out by Red Cross/Red \r\nCrescent-trained volunteers in the community, \r\nsignificantly reduces the incidence of malaria. \r\n Combining distribution with follow-on support \r\nand training is especially crucial when trying to reach \r\nthe most vulnerable groups, such as those living in \r\nremote areas, refugees and people affected by stigma \r\nand discrimination. Trained Red Cross and Red \r\nCrescent volunteers who live in the very same \r\ncommunity and speak the local language are ideally \r\nplaced to help families overcome any social or cultural \r\nbarriers that may prevent the effective hanging and use \r\nof nets. \r\n Since 2002, as a direct result of the net \r\ndistribution carried out by the Red Cross and Red \r\nCrescent Societies, more than 300,000 malaria deaths \r\nhave been averted, while 18.2 million people have been \r\nprotected against malaria. \r\n Furthermore, in a recently published report on a \r\npilot project involving an innovative approach to \r\nmalaria treatment, it was shown that the community \r\napproach works. The pilot project “Beyond prevention: \r\nhome management of malaria in Kenya” showed that, \r\neven in the most remote areas, providing free, effective \r\nmedicines to trained local volunteers can alleviate both \r\nthe malaria disease burden and the strain on the health \r\nsystem. The malaria home management project in \r\nKenya reaffirms earlier studies that trained community \r\nworkers can safely distribute and administer malaria \r\ntreatment. \r\n The key message of the Red Cross and the Red \r\nCrescent Societies is that communities must own the \r\nactivities that support the prevention and treatment of \r\nmalaria at the individual and household levels. To \r\nincrease ownership and action, families must have the \r\nsupport necessary to understand the transmission of \r\nmalaria and how it can be prevented through the use of \r\nnets and treated by accessing effective treatment at the \r\nfirst signs of danger. \r\n In 2009 alone, the Red Cross and Red Crescent \r\nSocieties reached 3.7 million households, or 14.8 \r\nmillion individuals, through community-based activities \r\nto prevent malaria and to ensure that care providers are \r\naware of the danger signs of malaria and the need to \r\nimmediately access effective treatment. \r\n The International Federation of Red Cross and \r\nRed Crescent Societies will further step up its efforts \r\n A/65/PV.31\r\n \r\n23 10-58713 \r\n \r\nby developing more “hang up” campaigns, by covering \r\nmore affected countries and by teaming up with \r\npartners to accelerate the delivery of nets to all \r\nmalaria-endemic areas. \r\n Additionally, the Federation also includes a \r\nmalaria component in its emergency response activities \r\nwhen disasters take place in malaria-endemic areas or \r\nwhere epidemics are possible as a result of a natural \r\ndisaster. \r\n The Acting President: In accordance with \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 64/122 of 16 December \r\n2009, I now call on the observer for the Global Fund to \r\nFight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. \r\n Ms. Lwin (Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \r\nTuberculosis and Malaria): When the world leaders \r\ncame together to sign the United Nations Millennium \r\nDeclaration in 2000 (resolution 55/2), dying from a \r\nmosquito bite was a reality in large parts of Africa, \r\nAsia and Latin America. A decade later, one area of \r\ndevelopment that is inspiring hope is our progress in \r\nthe fight against malaria to the point that one day soon \r\nit could really be eliminated as a public health problem \r\nin most malaria-endemic countries. If countries \r\ncontinue to scale up their progress at the pace set in \r\nrecent in health care, we will see tremendous progress. \r\n The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and \r\nMalaria is proud to be a major international funder of \r\nmalaria programmes, with more than $5 billion \r\ncommitted in 82 countries to date. The Global Fund \r\nhas invested particularly in the universal coverage of \r\ninsecticide-treated mosquito nets and had distributed \r\n104 million bednets by the end of 2009. We estimate \r\nthat currently available funds will enable us to \r\npurchase approximately 250 million bednets, a \r\nsignificant step forward in addressing the estimated \r\nneed for the most vulnerable populations. \r\n Global Fund grants have also supported the \r\nindoor residual spraying of insecticides in more than \r\n19 million sites and have treated 108 million cases of \r\nmalaria, in accordance with national treatment \r\nguidelines. \r\n Global Fund financing is having a substantial \r\nimpact on malaria morbidity and mortality worldwide, \r\nwith an increasing number of countries reporting a \r\nreduction in malaria deaths of more than 50 per cent.  \r\n \r\nMalaria control interventions also have an important \r\nimpact in reinforcing health systems. Hospital beds are \r\nbeing freed up, children are remaining in schools, \r\nworkers are staying at work and women are delivering \r\nhealthier babies, reminding us of the close linkages \r\namong the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\n That progress is due to excellent political \r\nleadership in countries affected by malaria and \r\nincreased technical support from partners, such as the \r\nWorld Health Organization and the Roll Back Malaria \r\nPartnership. In no other area of development has there \r\nbeen such rapid and direct correlation between \r\navailable resources and the impact in fighting malaria \r\nat the country level. \r\n I am delighted to report that, earlier this month, \r\ndonors from the public and private sectors made a \r\nfinancial commitment of $11.7 billion to the Global \r\nFund for the years 2011 to 2013. That contribution is \r\nthe largest ever financial pledge for the collective \r\ninternational effort to fight the three pandemics of \r\nAIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. \r\n At a time when so many Governments are \r\ntightening their belts at home, such commitments send \r\na powerful message that health is integral to \r\nsustainable development. We cannot be complacent on \r\nthe heels of our success so far. If we are truly going to \r\neliminate malaria as a public health threat in endemic \r\ncountries, we must maintain the pressure on all fronts \r\nin the coming years by renewing nets, ensuring \r\navailability of drugs and supporting effective malaria \r\ninterventions. The Global Fund will be ready to \r\nsupport those activities through our continuing effort to \r\nseek the additional resources needed to fight malaria. \r\n On behalf of the Global Fund, let me conclude \r\nwith simple but sincere thanks to all Members for their \r\ncollaboration and commitment to the fight against \r\nmalaria and to global health. Because of their efforts, \r\nachieving the MDGs for malaria is not some elusive \r\ndream, but something that is actually within reach in \r\nmany countries. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on this issue. \r\n The Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 62 and its sub-items (a) \r\nand (b), and of agenda item 12. \r\n The meeting rose at 5.30 p.m. \r\n"
