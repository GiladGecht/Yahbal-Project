(Switzerland) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 11 \r\n \r\nSport for peace and development \r\n \r\n (a) Report of the Secretary-General (A/65/270) \r\n \r\n (b) Draft resolution (A/65/L.4) \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now give the \r\nfloor to the representative of Tunisia to introduce draft \r\nresolution A/65/L.4. \r\n Mr. Jomaa (Tunisia) (spoke in French): First, I \r\nwould like to express my delegation’s satisfaction with \r\nthe Secretary-General’s report entitled “Sport for \r\ndevelopment and peace: strengthening the partnerships” \r\n(A/65/270). We welcome the actions undertaken by the \r\nUnited Nations system, especially the Office of Sport \r\nfor Development and Peace. \r\n I would also like to stress how much my \r\ndelegation values the continuing and unstinting efforts \r\nof Mr. Wilfried Lemke, the Secretary-General’s Special \r\nAdviser on Sport for Development and Peace. We \r\nparticularly applaud his activities in Côte d’Ivoire in \r\ncooperation with the United Nations Operation in that \r\ncountry and the role he has played on behalf of the \r\nUnited Nations vis-à-vis the authorities of that friendly \r\ncountry, to which a Tunisian contingent has been sent \r\nas part of the United Nations peacekeeping forces there. \r\nWe wish Mr. Lemke every success in his noble \r\nendeavour and assure him of our full support for his \r\nefforts to ensure the success of programmes aimed at \r\npromoting sport around the world. Tunisia, which \r\nsupported the original idea of the International Year for \r\nSport and Physical Education in 2005 (resolution 58/5), \r\nremains determined to continue its efforts to make \r\nsport, through its ability to promote communication and \r\nrapprochement, become a driving force for integrating \r\ndevelopment, at both the national and the international \r\nlevels, and a means of promoting solidarity, tolerance \r\nand cultural and human diversity. \r\n Today, sport is part and parcel of the United \r\nNations and an effective tool that should be borne in \r\nmind as we consider the issues confronting this \r\nOrganization, as was pointed out during the \r\nconsultations on the Outcome Document (resolution \r\n65/1) of the Summit on the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs), whose paragraph 67 deals with the role \r\nthat sport can play in facilitating the implementation of \r\nthe MDGs. \r\n We thank the Secretary-General for formulating \r\nthe Action Plan in his report to the sixty-first session \r\n(A/61/373), and we welcome the fact that that has been \r\ncontinued in the current report, with proposed \r\nimprovements and adjustments that will undoubtedly \r\nonly strengthen the effectiveness of sport as a tool for \r\npromoting peace, development, education and health. \r\n I would like to take this opportunity to \r\ncongratulate South Africa on its successful holding of \r\nthe last World Cup, and Singapore on the success of the \r\nfirst Youth Olympics. Those events clearly \r\ndemonstrated the unifying nature of sport and the \r\nenthusiasm it can generate for friendship and solidarity \r\namong athletes and fans, irrespective of their origins, \r\nA/65/PV.32  \r\n \r\n10-58990 2 \r\n \r\nloyalties and beliefs. Given sport’s noble nature and \r\nthe vital contribution it can make to the emergence of \r\nyounger generations in good physical and mental \r\nhealth, Tunisia takes this opportunity to call on \r\nMember States to take all necessary measures to \r\nconfront the dangers of doping, which threatens both \r\nthe health of athletes and the image and credibility of \r\nsporting events. We welcome the growing number of \r\nMember States that have signed the International \r\nConvention against Doping in Sport, which is the first \r\nglobal instrument in the fight against that scourge, \r\nadopted at the thirty-third session of the UNESCO \r\nGeneral Conference in 2005. \r\n Based on our interest in continuing that \r\nmomentum and making sport a means of promoting \r\nuniversal principles in the service of future \r\ngenerations, I have the honour to introduce draft \r\nresolution A/65/L.4 entitled “Sport as a means to \r\npromote education, health, development and peace”, on \r\nbehalf of Monaco, Tunisia, the members of the Group \r\nof Friends of Sport for Development and Peace and on \r\nbehalf of the other sponsors, whose names are listed in \r\nthe document. \r\n I would like to point out that, since the \r\npublication of that document, the following Member \r\nStates have joined the list of sponsors, namely, \r\nBelgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Canada, \r\nCentral African Republic, Croatia, Cyprus, Finland, \r\nLithuania, Montenegro, Poland, Portugal, San Marino, \r\nSpain, Thailand and Zambia.  \r\n The draft resolution is the outcome of \r\nconsultations, both with a large number of Member \r\nStates and with United Nations bodies, to whom we \r\nextend our sincere thanks and gratitude for the interest \r\naccorded to the draft text.  \r\n The draft resolution encourages all stakeholders \r\nto cooperate with the Special Adviser to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in order to make more widely known the \r\nimportance of including sport in development \r\nprogrammes, while calling on Member States to \r\nappoint focal points responsible for sport for \r\ndevelopment and peace and to establish innovative \r\npartnerships with the United Nations Office on Sport \r\nfor Development and Peace. \r\n Here, I would like to express the hope that the \r\ndraft resolution will enjoy the support of all General \r\nAssembly Member States, which would send a strong \r\nmessage to all those acting in the name of the noble \r\npractice of sport and provide great encouragement to \r\nall athletes. \r\n Mr. Quintães (Brazil): At the very outset, the \r\nBrazilian delegation would like to welcome draft \r\nresolution A/65/L.4, submitted by the delegations of \r\nMonaco and Tunisia and entitled “Sports as a means to \r\npromote education, health, development and peace”. \r\nThat effort seems to be in close harmony with the main \r\ninitiatives and programmes undertaken by Member \r\nStates and international organizations to promote that \r\nobjective in an integrated manner that is consistent \r\nwith accomplishments in other social fields.  \r\n The practice of sports is deeply rooted in \r\nBrazilian society. Accordingly, sport in Brazil is \r\ntraditionally regarded as instrumental in forging good \r\nstandards of citizenship, thereby playing a very special \r\nrole in maintaining a healthy social fabric. Furthermore, \r\nit cannot be overstressed that access to sport constitutes \r\na fundamental social right that is enshrined in our \r\nConstitution. \r\n In that regard, the Brazilian Government firmly \r\nbelieves in the potential of sport as an important factor \r\nin social inclusiveness and development, as well as a \r\ntool for fostering role model values and a solid \r\nupbringing for our children and youth. \r\n Our Government’s policy is to consider sport as \r\npart of a broader context that also encompasses the \r\nfields of education and health. We believe that dealing \r\nwith sport in a socially integrated and holistic way \r\npromotes peace and development. \r\n That view stems from the collective awareness \r\nthat sport alone is not capable of solving complex \r\nsocial and economic challenges and that it cannot, by \r\nitself, ensure peace and mutual cooperation. Bearing \r\nthat in mind, the Brazilian Government has adopted a \r\nseries of public policies focused on promoting \r\ncitizenship, education and health through sports. \r\n Thus, several governmental initiatives are been \r\nlaunched in Brazil with a focus on multi-stakeholder \r\npartnerships with representative institutions in our \r\nsociety. For instance, we have started a programme that \r\nemploys over 12,000 inmates from State prisons to \r\nmanufacture sports equipment, whose output is then \r\nused in other educational sports programmes carried \r\nout by the Brazilian Government. \r\n The so-called Second Half programme fosters, in \r\nturn, sports activities for children and youngsters \r\n A/65/PV.32\r\n \r\n3 10-58990 \r\n \r\nenrolled in public schools, and it already has more than \r\n1 million participants. Likewise, pursuant to the \r\nrecommendations of draft resolution A/65/L.4, Brazil \r\nis currently developing international sports cooperation \r\nprojects in partnership with other developing countries, \r\nnamely, Benin, Botswana, Kenya, Palestine, South \r\nAfrica, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. We remain open \r\nnot only to increasing and expanding the scope of such \r\nprogrammes with other countries, but also to launching \r\ninitiatives in cooperation with United Nations agencies \r\nand programmes. \r\n We feel that an exciting sports-centred decade has \r\njust begun. Over the next six years, Brazil will host \r\nthree mega-sporting events: the fifth World Military \r\nGames in 2011, the World Cup of the Fédération \r\ninternationale de football association in 2014, and the \r\nOlympic and Paralympic Games in 2016. During this \r\ndecade, sports will be at the top of the Brazilian social, \r\npolitical and economic agenda. \r\n The decision to host those mega-events is very \r\nmuch consistent with the priority accorded to the \r\npromotion of sustainable development and social \r\ninclusiveness. Hence, the Brazilian Government remains \r\ncommitted to fostering and adopting public policies, \r\nconvinced that hosting such events will help generate \r\nmore jobs and improve our national infrastructure and \r\nincrease opportunities for Brazilian youth. \r\n Brazil also hopes that those mega-events will \r\nprovide an opportunity for us to share experience in \r\npromoting sports as a means to achieve social \r\ninclusiveness and to enhance the development of \r\npartnerships with other nations, especially developing \r\ncountries.  \r\n For all those reasons, it is with the utmost \r\nsatisfaction that Brazil renews its support for and \r\nsponsorship of the draft resolution on sport as a means \r\nto promote education, health, development and peace. \r\n Mrs. Aitimova (Kazakhstan): At the outset, on \r\nbehalf of the Republic of Kazakhstan, I wish to express \r\nour warm appreciation to Mr. Wilfried Lemke, Special \r\nAdviser to the Secretary-General of the United Nations \r\non Sport for Development and Peace, and his Office \r\nfor their record of commendable activities over the past \r\nyear.  \r\n My Government would also like to convey special \r\ngratitude to the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \r\nas the driving force behind that thrust, for his report \r\nentitled “Sport for development and peace: \r\nstrengthening the partnerships” (A/65/270). The report \r\npresents a comprehensive overview of how sport has \r\nbeen used to achieve development and peace at the \r\nnational, regional and international levels. It also \r\nhighlights the innovative use of sport in carrying \r\nforward the messages of the United Nations at major \r\nglobal games and sporting events, such as during the \r\n2010 World Cup of the Fédération internationale de \r\nfootball (FIFA) in South Africa. \r\n That was the first FIFA championship hosted on \r\nthe African continent, indeed in a developing country, \r\nwhich gave momentum to the political, socio-economic \r\nand development goals of the region through the \r\nconvening power of sports. In addition, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s appeal to all Member States to adhere to the \r\nOlympic Truce, called for in the universally accepted \r\nresolution 64/4, has been effective in upholding peace, \r\nsecurity and human dignity, as demonstrated during the \r\nXXI Olympic Winter Games and the X Paralympic \r\nWinter Games, in Vancouver, Canada, in February and \r\nMarch 2010. \r\n The Action Plan on Sport for Development and \r\nPeace should be an integral component of all national \r\nand international policies and agendas aimed at \r\npromoting peace and development. My country would \r\ntherefore like to underscore the decisive role of the \r\nSport for Development and Peace International \r\nWorking Group in providing consultations and \r\ntechnical assistance to Member States with a view to \r\nmaking sport a vehicle for advancing national \r\nmeasures for security, human rights, equality and the \r\nbetterment of humankind. \r\n Kazakhstan took special steps to align itself with \r\nthe work of the United Nations by developing a large-\r\nscale programme of physical training and sports \r\nthroughout the country, accessible to all age groups and \r\nlevels of the population, for the period from 2007 to \r\n2011. The 2008 national legislation makes it obligatory \r\nfor the Government to create sports facilities and \r\ninfrastructure, provide training for national teams and \r\nprotect the legal right of each citizen to have equal \r\naccess to those possibilities.  \r\n Kazakhstan has already set in place a complex \r\ngoal-oriented agenda and programme for the athletes \r\ncompeting in the XXX Olympic Summer Games in \r\nLondon in 2012. Furthermore, Kazakhstan will host the \r\nseventh Asian Winter Games, Asiada 2011, and \r\nintensive projects are under way to ensure that the \r\nstated objectives and targets are reached in time. The \r\nA/65/PV.32  \r\n \r\n10-58990 4 \r\n \r\nprogramme will comprise 11 different types of sport \r\nand 69 sets of tournaments, with an estimated total of \r\n10,000 accredited participants and approximately 1,400 \r\nathletes.  \r\n The Ministry of Tourism and Sport of the \r\nRepublic of Kazakhstan, together with leading world \r\narchitects, has developed a massive project for \r\nconstructing numerous sports stadiums, arenas and \r\nrelated facilities of the highest standards in quality, \r\nmeeting international norms of durability and safety. \r\nCurrently, some 80 per cent of construction work is \r\nunder way, and it is anticipated that all facilities in \r\nAstana will be completed by 25 October 2010 and in \r\nAlmaty by the end of this year. Asiada 2011 will be the \r\nfirst Winter Games of the continent, and my \r\nGovernment is striving to make them a memorable \r\nevent for the region. The preliminarily expenditure for \r\nconstructing facilities and for other preparations is to \r\nthe tune of $1 billion. \r\n Kazakhstan strictly complies with the regulations \r\nof the International Convention against Doping in \r\nSport and has ratified it. We would especially like to \r\nstress the effectiveness of the use of sport as a tool for \r\ndevelopment and peace, as demonstrated during the \r\nXXI Olympic Winter Games in Vancouver. Kazakhstan \r\nwill continue to do its utmost towards that objective in \r\nits national and regional activities and also at the \r\ninternational level. \r\n Inspired by the ideals of the Paralympic Games, \r\nKazakhstan, like all other countries, pays increasing \r\nattention to sports for the personal development and \r\nrehabilitation of persons with disabilities by creating \r\nthe optimal conditions for their participation. I am \r\npleased to report that Kazakhstan will soon ratify the \r\nConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities \r\nand its Optional Protocol. \r\n Kazakhstan also undertakes measures for \r\nenhancing excellence in professional and competitive \r\nsports and, at the same time, developing leisure \r\nsporting activities for the wider community with varied \r\ninterests. The focus is also on using sport for physical \r\nfitness and inculcating the values of a healthy lifestyle \r\nin the population. Legislation has been adopted to \r\nsupport the effective creation and functioning of sport-\r\noriented non-governmental organizations to partner \r\nwith the Government to promote education, physical \r\nand mental health and well-being. \r\n A very significant advantage of sport is its \r\neffectiveness in inspiring youth with the positive ideals \r\nof national and community service, as well as promoting \r\nthe values of equity, tolerance, respect for rules, fair \r\nplay, hard work, healthy competition and good \r\ncharacter. Kazakhstan focuses on all those elements. \r\n My delegation considers that the accelerated \r\ndynamism and outreach seen in United Nations efforts \r\nto integrate sport for development and peace, under the \r\nleadership of the Secretary-General, are most \r\nencouraging. We call for the further engagement of all \r\nstakeholders — Governments, parliamentarians, \r\nreligious leaders, academia, the business sector, media, \r\ncivil society and especially youth groups — to work \r\nfor this new vision of sport. Through collective \r\nmultilateral action, sport can become one of the most \r\npowerful means to accelerate the achievement of \r\nbroader development goals, including the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. \r\n Sport is only a means, yet an important one, to \r\nstrengthen our collective multilateral enterprise in \r\ncombating climate change, drugs and illicit trafficking \r\nin all forms and in promoting environmental \r\nconservation and sustainable development, human \r\nrights and gender equality, as well as interreligious and \r\ncultural dialogue, to mention a few issues, through \r\nraising awareness and mobilizing action on them. We \r\nneed to fully seize this moment to utilize sport in \r\npropelling action to support the United Nations, as well \r\nas the individual efforts of Member States for their \r\nagendas of development and peace.  \r\n Mr. Benítez Versón (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThe San Francisco Charter established the bases of a \r\nnew system of international relations, conceived to \r\navoid repetition of the terrible consequences of the two \r\nworld wars of the twentieth century. The main purpose, \r\ninscribed in the first paragraph of the Charter, is to \r\nsave succeeding generations from the scourge of war \r\nand to create a democratic and equitable international \r\norder based on respect for the dignity of all human \r\nbeings equally. \r\n More than six decades after the creation of the \r\nUnited Nations, the vast majority of the world suffers \r\nthe consequences of the profoundly unjust and \r\nunsustainable prevailing international order. We are \r\nwitness to a sad economic and social panorama, \r\ncharacterized by the combination of the economic and \r\nfinancial crisis, the food and energy crisis and the \r\n A/65/PV.32\r\n \r\n5 10-58990 \r\n \r\nnegative impact of climate change, which endangers \r\nthe human species. \r\n Now more than ever, it is our duty to promote a \r\npeaceful international environment through solidarity, \r\ncooperation and multilateralism. \r\n Sport constitutes a significant aspect of \r\ndevelopment at both the national and the international \r\nlevels. Sport strengthens solidarity and friendship \r\namong peoples as essential elements in the promotion \r\nof peace, development and cooperation among nations. \r\n Since the triumph of the Cuban revolution in \r\n1959, sport in our country has not been an exclusive \r\npastime and became a right for all our people. As a \r\nresult, Cuba has achieved significant success in \r\nregional and international sport competitions. \r\n We have fostered a pedagogical system that \r\nincludes physical education as an integral part of all \r\nstages of training the human being. We work to provide \r\nsport training for our children from an early age. \r\nLikewise, we oppose athletic activities that have \r\nmoney as their only reward. We also denounce the \r\ntalent drain in sports, which developing countries are \r\nvictims of. Cuba has suffered the consequences of that \r\nunacceptable practice. \r\n For years, the Cuban sports movement, led by the \r\nCuban Olympic Committee and the National Institute \r\nof Sports, Physical Education and Recreation has \r\nselflessly collaborated with various countries of the \r\nSouth. We have sent to those countries technicians, \r\nprofessors and trainers who in a modest way teach new \r\nsport training methods, thus contributing to improving \r\nsport results and people’s participation in sport and \r\ndeveloping bonds of brotherhood and friendship \r\nbetween peoples. \r\n Likewise, we have strengthened international \r\ncooperation by making our Institute of Sports Medicine \r\nand the National Anti-doping Laboratory available to \r\nother countries, with the purpose of contributing to the \r\nfight against the scourge of drugs, which corrupt \r\nathletes and impede fair play. \r\n Cuba created the International School of Physical \r\nEducation and Sport, dedicated to training \r\nprofessionals from different countries. Its central value \r\nis solidarity. \r\n The countries of the South also deserve to host \r\nthe Olympic Games, which are a forum for \r\nbrotherhood and solidarity. We are certain that the 2016 \r\nOlympics Games, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, will be a \r\nsuccess for the entire South. \r\n If we promote international solidarity, including \r\nthrough the Olympic ideal, all the weapons created by \r\nthis civilization will be rendered superfluous. Let us \r\npromote and sow peace and development through \r\nsport, and we will have a better world. \r\n Mr. Al Mujaini (Oman) (spoke in Arabic): Allow \r\nme at the outset, Mr. President, to congratulate you on \r\nyour assumption of the presidency of the Assembly at \r\nits sixty-fifth session. I wish you every success in your \r\ntask so that we can achieve our desired objectives.  \r\n Sport is an important means of strengthening \r\nsocial cohesion and the ideals of peace, brotherhood, \r\nsolidarity, justice, non-violence and tolerance. It \r\nfacilitates the resolution of problems in post-crisis \r\ntimes. Sport can bring people together and serve as a \r\nforum for development, peace and social development. \r\nIt is a recognized means of reinforcing peace among \r\nvarious countries of the world. It transcends borders \r\nand social classes and plays an important role in social \r\nintegration and economic development in the political, \r\ncultural and geographical fields. \r\n The participation of youth in sport is an important \r\nelement for achieving peace and development in the \r\nworld, not to mention its cultural and intellectual \r\ncontributions to different issues. It enables youth to be \r\nuniquely creative in developing their societies. In \r\nreinforcing their participation in sport, we must \r\nprovide youth with the necessary means and resources \r\nfor them to achieve their vision of and aspiration to a \r\nprosperous homeland. That will help them build their \r\ncapacities and skills so that they can be positively \r\nintegrated in society and achieve the objectives of \r\npeace and development and so that they can spread \r\ntheir vision and goals and increase their chances of \r\ncreative participation within their societies.  \r\n The General Assembly recognized this in \r\nresolutions 58/5, 59/10, 60/9 and in its proclamation of \r\n2005 as the International Year for Sport and Physical \r\nEducation, seeking to encourage sport as a means of \r\npromoting education, health, development and peace. \r\nAlso, the 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution \r\n60/1) states that sport could foster peace and \r\ndevelopment.  \r\nA/65/PV.32  \r\n \r\n10-58990 6 \r\n \r\n Sport and physical education could provide \r\nopportunities for solidarity and cooperation that would \r\nfoster tolerance and a culture of peace and equality \r\nbetween genders. It can also provide for the needs of \r\ndisabled persons, achieve dialogue among civilizations \r\nand foster social cohesion and concord.  \r\n We need a joint framework within the United \r\nNations to encourage sport as a means to reinforce \r\neducation, health, development and peace. To that end, \r\nwe must expand the mandate of the Group of Friends \r\nof Sport for Development and Peace, along with the \r\nUnited Nations communications team that would set up \r\na practical approach, strategies, policies and common \r\nprogrammes in order to increase awareness and \r\ncooperative action within the United Nations and with \r\nother partners from outside the Organization.  \r\n The Government of my country, under the \r\nsponsorship of His Excellency the Sultan of Oman, \r\nprovides to Omani citizens every means to carry out \r\ntheir tasks in the fields of development and \r\nconstruction, especially since the young of both sexes \r\nconstitute the largest percentage of our society. In \r\n2004, we established a Ministry of Sport that prepares \r\nyouth in the field of sport and that cooperates with \r\nother Government bodies all over the country. That \r\nenhances sport in Oman in many domains and helps to \r\nutilize the potential of youth and their ability to \r\ncommunicate with other friendly and sisterly countries. \r\n Our Ministry, on the basis of that noble objective, \r\nhas a vision of establishing a sports system that ensures \r\noptimal use of technical, human and material resources \r\nin the field of competitive sport and sport for all. The \r\nMinistry also seeks to send a clear message that \r\npromises quality sport services and facilities through \r\nthe activation of good organization, communications, \r\nmarketing and building partnerships with relevant \r\ninstitutions. \r\n As we seek to strengthen relations among various \r\npeoples, we will host the second Asian Beach Games in \r\nDecember 2010, to be sponsored by the Olympic \r\nCouncil of Asia. It will include many sports activities \r\nwith a large number of Asian countries participating in \r\nvarious capacities. \r\n Ms. Fulp (United States of America): The United \r\nStates delegation supports promoting the use of sport \r\nto advance peace and development. My delegation \r\nappreciates the potential of sport to contribute to the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nSport can foster development and peace, can build an \r\natmosphere of tolerance and understanding, and can \r\nserve as a tool for education. Well-planned sporting \r\nprogrammes promote cooperation, solidarity, social \r\ninclusion and health among all of those engaged. \r\n Throughout history, sport has played an important \r\nrole in the social, political and economic lives of \r\npeoples and nations. Sport is a shared cultural passion \r\nthat can bring people together across the divisions of \r\nregion, race and religion. One of the great things about \r\nsport is that it reminds us of what humanity has in \r\ncommon — not what may drive us apart. \r\n The United States recognizes the value of sport in \r\nthat way and has created an office called SportsUnited \r\nwithin the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs \r\nat the Department of State. It is dedicated to \r\ninternational sport programming designed to work at \r\nthe grass-roots level. Its purpose it to aid foreign youth \r\nin discovering how success in athletics can be \r\ntranslated into the development of life skills and \r\nachievement in the classroom. SportsUnited provides \r\nfor those foreign youth exposure to American life and \r\nculture. It also provides American youth interacting \r\nwith them the opportunity to learn about foreign \r\ncultures and the challenges young people from other \r\ncountries face today. \r\n Since 2002, the Department of State has funded \r\nand organized sports programmes in more than 80 \r\ncountries in all regions of the world. Those \r\nprogrammes have featured activities in over 25 sports \r\nand areas such as disability sports, managing sports \r\ncentres, recreational sports and sports management. \r\n There is so much from the world of sport to \r\nimagine and apply towards improving lives together, \r\nwhether across oceans, in neighbourhoods or in our \r\nhomes. For example, First Lady Michelle Obama’s \r\n2010 “Let’s Move!” campaign against childhood \r\nobesity is making a difference in the lives of children \r\nand families. It encourages physical activity for youth \r\nand is improving the quality and availability of \r\nphysical education in schools. And we are proud to \r\nnote that “Let’s Move!” is based on an exemplary \r\npartnership between the public and private sectors that \r\nhas underpinned its success. \r\n Sport has the power to bring us together and to \r\nbuild stronger societies. One critically important way \r\nthat our societies improve is through integrating \r\n A/65/PV.32\r\n \r\n7 10-58990 \r\n \r\nwomen and girls fully, and sport has proven powerful \r\nin that regard. \r\n Recently, United States Permanent Representative \r\nSusan Rice was recognized by the Women’s National \r\nBasketball Association with its Inspiration Award. \r\nHaving been an athlete in school, she reminded the \r\ngathering: \r\n “Our daughters need role models who can inspire \r\nthem to play to the best of their abilities, to \r\ncompete to the limits of their strength, and to win \r\non their own terms … Sports are just simply too \r\nimportant to be left to the boys. Determination and \r\ndrive are habits girls must learn early on and use \r\nfor a lifetime. These really are the fundamentals — \r\nthe skills I learned on the court — long before I \r\never sat at a negotiating table.” \r\n Another way that sport contributes to our society \r\nis its inherent lesson of fair play. Perhaps the biggest \r\nthreat to that is the destructive practice of doping in \r\nsport. I am pleased to note, in that regard, that in 2008 \r\nthe United States signed an instrument of ratification \r\non the International Convention against Doping in \r\nSport, at the United Nations Educational, Scientific, \r\nand Cultural Organization. That ratification \r\ndemonstrated our long-standing commitment to the \r\ndevelopment of international anti-doping controls and \r\nour promise to apply and facilitate the application of \r\nappropriate anti-doping controls during competitions \r\nheld in the United States. \r\n My delegation appreciates the report of the \r\nSecretary-General for today’s debate (A/65/270). It \r\nupdates us usefully on progress regarding Sport for \r\nDevelopment and Peace, International Working Group \r\npolicy recommendations, the functioning of the United \r\nNations Office of Sport for Development and Peace, \r\nthe Trust Fund for Sport for Development and Peace, \r\nand the Action Plan on Sport for Development and \r\nPeace. \r\n Furthermore, the United States is pleased to offer \r\nits support for today’s draft resolution, “Sport as a \r\nmeans to promote education, health, development and \r\npeace” (A/65/L.4), under agenda item 11, “Sport for \r\npeace and development”. \r\n Athletes and sports accomplishments provide \r\npowerful examples in our globalized society, more and \r\nmore each year. As I have described, the United States \r\nhas made sport part of its global outreach efforts for \r\ndecades. That commitment goes all the way to the top. \r\nPresident Obama recently invited young Russian \r\nbasketball players — boys and girls — to Washington \r\non a SportsUnited sports visitor programme. He invited \r\nthem to the White House court to shoot some hoops. \r\n Diplomacy these days is not only about official \r\nmeetings in conference rooms; it is also about people-\r\nto-people exchanges that break down barriers and build \r\nup goodwill. Sport truly is a global language. Sport \r\nteaches us how to work in teams. Sport builds \r\ndiscipline and confidence. Sport builds upon those \r\nvalues and strengths in our work here at the United \r\nNations, promoting development and peace through \r\nsport. \r\n Mr. Stone (Australia): Australia is committed to \r\nthe principles of sport for development and peace and \r\nto the role the United Nations can play in furthering \r\nthose principles. We welcome the report of the \r\nSecretary-General on this subject (A/65/270) \r\nintroduced this morning and would like to take this \r\nopportunity to thank Mr. Wilfried Lemke, the \r\nSecretary-General’s Special Adviser on Sport for \r\nDevelopment and Peace, for his efforts. \r\n We would also like to thank Tunisia for \r\nintroducing the draft resolution (A/65/L.4) before us \r\ntoday, which Australia is pleased to co-sponsor. \r\n We would also like to thank Switzerland, and in \r\nparticular Ambassador Peter Maurer, for his role as \r\nco-Chair, along with Ambassador Jomaa of Tunisia, of \r\nthe Group of Friends over recent years. We appreciate \r\nMonaco’s taking over the co-chairship of the Group, \r\nand we look forward to working with Ambassadors \r\nPicco and Jomaa in strengthening the role of the Group \r\nof Friends. \r\n A growing body of research on sport for \r\ndevelopment provides strong empirical evidence of the \r\ndirect role that sport, as a component of international \r\ndevelopment programmes, plays in advancing human \r\nrights, social inclusion and community development. \r\nApart from physical fitness and good health, sport \r\ncontributes to the development of other life skills and \r\nattributes, including confidence, self-esteem, \r\nteamwork, cooperation, social interaction, \r\ninterpersonal communication, tolerance and conflict \r\nresolution. Sport offers a way to improve the lives of \r\nthe most marginalized and excluded children, including \r\ngirls, children from poor communities, out-of-school \r\nand working children, and people with disabilities. \r\nA/65/PV.32  \r\n \r\n10-58990 8 \r\n \r\n Because of that, sport remains an integral tool in \r\nAustralia’s development cooperation. Through the \r\nAustralian Sports Outreach Programme, funding is \r\nprovided in more than 40 countries for sport-for-\r\ndevelopment programmes at the grass-roots level. \r\nWorking with local authorities and communities, \r\nAustralia is able to increase the capacity of partners to \r\nplan and conduct quality sport-based activities that \r\ncontribute to addressing locally identified development \r\npriorities. \r\n In 2010, the sport-for-development programmes \r\ninclude a children’s surf life-saving education \r\nprogramme in Viet Nam, increasing services to persons \r\nwith disabilities through sport in Malawi, the \r\nestablishment of youth clubs in post-conflict areas of \r\nSri Lanka, a programme called Kicking AIDS Out, \r\nwhich uses sports analogies and games to convey \r\nmessages about HIV and AIDS to young people in the \r\nCaribbean, and training players, coaches and \r\nadministrators to promote active sports participation \r\namong rural women in Fiji. \r\n Sport in Australia has always helped build the \r\nsocial cohesion that binds families, communities, \r\nregions and the nation. It brings together people of \r\ndifferent nationalities, religions and cultures and helps \r\npromote tolerance and understanding. \r\n Mr. Aisi (Papua New Guinea): Let me begin by \r\napplauding the numerous delegations, especially that of \r\nTunisia, that have helped to promote human \r\ndevelopment through sport and physical education \r\nthrough the draft resolution that is before us today \r\n(A/65/L.4). \r\n Sport and physical education play an increasingly \r\nimportant global role in maintaining national unity, \r\nhealth and cultural ties. The culture of sport provides a \r\nplatform for social cohesion, value formation and \r\nnational spirit. It is and can continue to be a way for \r\ndifferent cultures to reach common ground, initiate \r\ndialogue and form relations. \r\n Sport does bring individuals and communities \r\ntogether. For instance, the Olympic Games, apart from \r\nshowing off athletes’ incredible sporting abilities, \r\ncontribute to intercultural ties that help bridge ethnic \r\nand cultural divides. Next year, the South Pacific \r\nGames will again bring together the best athletes of the \r\nPacific islands to compete and participate in the spirit \r\nof sport. I should add here that we have just witnessed \r\nthe successful completion of the Commonwealth \r\nGames in New Delhi. I congratulate the Indian \r\nGovernment and people on their successful hosting of \r\nthe event. Such sporting events provide a stage to \r\npromote healthy forms of nationalism, spirit and unity \r\namong countries. \r\n Promoting physical education is also a way to \r\ndevelop children’s talents and abilities to their fullest \r\npotential. There is a growing risk of deteriorating \r\nphysical education programmes within countries. The \r\nshrinking number of sports and physical education \r\nprogrammes limits the positive impact that sports can \r\nhave in helping promote and maintain a child’s \r\nphysical and mental well-being. Physical education \r\nprogrammes within schools are essential and have been \r\nproven to enhance academic performance. Sports are a \r\nway for young individuals to express themselves as \r\nwell as to play within a social community. They are a \r\nway to reduce disease, boost physical health and \r\nimprove local development, and they provide \r\nalternatives to harmful activities such as drug abuse \r\nand crime. \r\n We are aware of the dangers faced by sportsmen \r\nand sportswomen, as well as by young athletes, who \r\nencounter violence, doping, overtraining, deprivation \r\nand other threats. Such dangers emphasize the need to \r\ndevelop more effective ways to fight against doping \r\nand destructive processes around our young athletes. \r\n We emphasize the importance of the international \r\ncommunity in helping to provide funding and resources \r\nfor sports-related institutions so that such institutions \r\ncan effectively construct programmes that can help \r\nmake sport and physical education available to \r\neveryone. The international community must work \r\ntogether to provide a code of good practices to \r\ncontinue to combat the dangers that young athletes \r\nface. \r\n By collectively working towards contributing to \r\nsport and physical education, we can help strengthen \r\nsport infrastructures for use as a tool for health, \r\neducation, and social and cultural development. We \r\ncall upon the international community and \r\ninternational sports bodies to continue helping \r\ndeveloping countries, least-developed countries and \r\nsmall island developing States to help build sport and \r\nphysical education. And here let me acknowledge the \r\npresence of the representative of the International \r\nOlympic Committee, who will speak later on. \r\n A/65/PV.32\r\n \r\n9 10-58990 \r\n \r\n Sport and physical education may be used as a \r\ntool to further international goals, including those in \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. Sports provide a \r\nplace to develop positive skills such as discipline, \r\nconfidence and respect. We encourage the United \r\nNations and participating members to find new and \r\ninnovative ways to utilize sports as a source of \r\ncommunication and a way to reduce tension and \r\ngenerate dialogue. \r\n Lastly, we call on the international community, \r\nincluding international sports bodies and sport-related \r\norganizations, to partner in the development of sport \r\nand physical education programmes. In doing so, we \r\nare also investing in global conflict-prevention and \r\npeacebuilding efforts. \r\n Mr. Shanta Kumar (India): I am honoured and \r\nprivileged to participate in today’s discussion on sport \r\nfor peace and development. Let me begin by thanking \r\nthe Secretary-General for his report on the item under \r\ndiscussion (A/65/270).  \r\n Sports are an important element in building \r\ncharacter. They not only teach people to be just and fair \r\nbut also prepare them to face challenges in life. Sports, \r\nbeing a most popular activity for young people, can \r\nhelp to motivate young people, build teams, develop \r\nleadership, promote volunteering and educate, apart \r\nfrom ensuring fitness and healthy lifestyles. Sports also \r\nseek to promote peace, equality and friendship among \r\nall people and nations. In fact, it is hard to imagine a \r\nmore powerful medium than sports to inspire and bring \r\npeople together for a common purpose. \r\n Swami Vivekananda, the great philosopher from \r\nIndia, when approached by a young man to explain the \r\nmeaning of the Bhagavad Gita, is reported to have \r\nlooked at his physique and advised him first to go play \r\nfootball. “Develop your body and mind”, Swamiji told \r\nthe young man, “and then you will be better fit to study \r\nand understand the Gita”. Swamiji was clear that a \r\nhealthy body and mind were fundamental in our quest \r\nfor peace and sports — indeed, they play a critical role \r\ntowards that end. \r\n The intrinsic linkage between sports and games \r\nand the human quest for excellence has been \r\nrecognized ever since the inception of human \r\ncivilization. It reached its epitome in Ancient Greek \r\ncivilization, which is the progenitor of the Olympic \r\nmovement. \r\n Sports, games and physical fitness are an integral \r\ncomponent of India’s civilization, as is evident from \r\nthe existence of the highly evolved system of yoga and \r\na vast range of highly developed indigenous games, \r\nincluding martial arts. After our independence, the \r\nintegration of physical education and sports with \r\nformal education was emphasized in the first five-year \r\nplan itself. Our efforts have been focused on broad-\r\nbasing sports and providing modern sports \r\ninfrastructure. India adopted a national sports policy in \r\n2001. We have also encouraged the autonomous \r\nfunctioning of national sports federations and are \r\nhappy to see that today all sections of our society, \r\nincluding the media and the business sector, are \r\nactively involving themselves in the promotion of \r\nsports. \r\n Sports are also a most effective tool to help \r\nachieve development objectives in the areas of health, \r\neducation, HIV/AIDS prevention, child protection and \r\nchild development. They help generate public \r\nawareness and inspire broad, inclusive and committed \r\naction in support of developmental agendas. \r\n I am glad that there is substantial recognition of \r\nthe value of sports to help achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and that many sports personalities \r\nhave associated themselves with the United Nations in \r\ncreating public awareness and understanding of various \r\nissues that affect youth and society. In this context, I am \r\nof course particularly happy that our national cricket \r\nicon Sachin Tendulkar is a Goodwill Ambassador for the \r\nUnited Nations Environment Programme and that our \r\nformer tennis champion Vijay Amritraj was a United \r\nNations Messenger of Peace in 2001. \r\n India was honoured to host the nineteenth \r\nCommonwealth Games, which have just concluded in \r\nDelhi. That two-week mega-event featured \r\nparticipation from 71 countries across the world and \r\nmore than 7,000 athletes, who celebrated sporting \r\nexcellence, human skill and endurance and, above all, \r\ncourage and character. The Games upheld and renewed \r\nthe essential spirit of peace, equality and friendship \r\namong all peoples and nations. \r\n We congratulate all those countries that \r\nsuccessfully organized large global and regional \r\nsporting events during the past year. We also wish \r\nevery success to all those countries that will be holding \r\nsporting events in the coming months and years. We \r\nbelieve that such mega-sporting events will strengthen \r\nA/65/PV.32  \r\n \r\n10-58990 10 \r\n \r\nthe cherished ties of goodwill and understanding that \r\nunite us as one family. \r\n Ms. Rulumeni (South Africa): It is an honour \r\nand privilege for South Africa to participate in this \r\nimportant debate on sport for development and peace. \r\nWe thank the Secretary-General for his latest report on \r\nthis issue, entitled, “Sport for development and peace: \r\nstrengthening the partnerships” (A/65/270).  \r\n This debate comes just a few months after the \r\n2010 Fédération internationale de football (FIFA) \r\nWorld Cup, hosted for the first time on African soil. \r\nIndeed, South Africa prides itself on having hosted a \r\nspectacular and memorable event that has once again \r\nunderscored Africa’s renewal. South Africa was the \r\nstage and Africa the theatre that further enhanced \r\nAfrica’s social cohesion. It was in reality an African \r\nWorld Cup. \r\n In South Africa sport played a crucial role in the \r\ndemise of the apartheid system and in the creation of a \r\nnew society after 1994. The realization that sport can \r\nbe used as a tool for reconstruction and development \r\nhas been occasioned by the spirit of unity that \r\nprevailed during such events as the Rugby World Cup, \r\nthe African Nations Cup, the Cricket World Cup and \r\nthe recent Soccer World Cup. At the centre of South \r\nAfrica’s sport-related reconstruction and development \r\ninitiatives was our icon, Nelson Mandela. At this point \r\nI am reminded of his words when he said, \r\n “Sport has the power to change the world, the \r\npower to inspire, the power to unite people in a \r\nway that little else can. Sport can create hope \r\nwhere there was once despair. It is an instrument \r\nfor peace, even more powerful than \r\nGovernments. It breaks down racial barriers. It \r\nlaughs in the face of all kinds of discrimination.” \r\n As declared in the 2005 World Summit Outcome \r\n(resolution 60/1), sport has the potential to foster peace \r\nand development as well as to contribute to an \r\natmosphere of tolerance and understanding. Sport has \r\nbeen recognized as a powerful tool in contributing to \r\nthe achievement of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). In that regard, we advocate for the \r\nprioritization of Africa in our collective efforts, \r\nthrough sport and other means, to achieve these \r\nimportant and achievable goals. \r\n Before the beginning of the World Cup, President \r\nJacob Zuma initiated the One Goal campaign, with a \r\nview to advancing efforts towards achieving education \r\nfor all, which is the objective of MDG 2. South Africa \r\nviews sport as an important part of education. This \r\ncampaign is part of a range of national initiatives \r\ntowards achieving universal access to education.  \r\n In resolution 64/5, the Assembly also \r\nacknowledged the role played by sport in Africa as an \r\ninstrument for the promotion of unity, solidarity, peace \r\nand reconciliation, and the preventive campaigns \r\nagainst scourges, such as HIV/AIDS, affecting the \r\nyouth of the continent. Although sport alone cannot \r\nprevent conflict or build peace, it can contribute to \r\nbroad and more comprehensive efforts in a number of \r\nimportant ways. \r\n The fact that the African Union declared \r\n“Building and sustaining peace through sport” as the \r\ntheme for this year’s Africa Day was a clear \r\nrecognition of the role of sport in peace and \r\ndevelopment. Coincidentally, the African Union \r\ndeclared 2010 the Year of Peace and Security. As an \r\nactive stakeholder in Africa’s peacebuilding efforts, \r\nSouth Africa encourages the use of sport as a tool to \r\nfoster peace and advance Africa’s development agenda. \r\n Since 1994, our Government has put in place a \r\nrange of progressive legislation in its pursuit to \r\nempower women in sports. This has been inspired by \r\nthe recognition that women have a crucial role to play \r\nin all aspects of societal development, including sport. \r\nWomen’s empowerment has been manifested by the \r\nincreasing number of women in leadership positions in \r\nthe area of sport. Equally important, we have enacted \r\nlegislation to protect and advance the empowerment of \r\npersons with disabilities, thus providing them with the \r\nopportunity to participate in sport with minimal or no \r\nhindrance. As a direct response to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s call in his report contained in document \r\nA/61/373, South Africa is currently involved in \r\nlegislative processes to infuse sport for development \r\nand peace into national legislation. \r\n South Africa welcomes the Action Plan on Sport \r\nfor Development and Peace. Accordingly, we will \r\nimplement the Action Plan at the national level in line \r\nwith internationally agreed standards. Our Government \r\nreiterates the need for collaboration between national \r\nand international partners, including the United \r\nNations system, to advance the objectives of the Action \r\nPlan. We also welcome the efforts of the Sport for \r\n A/65/PV.32\r\n \r\n11 10-58990 \r\n \r\nDevelopment and Peace International Working Group \r\nand look forward to its report. \r\n We also look forward to the summary report of \r\nthe activities around the 2010 FIFA World Cup, to be \r\npublished later this year. South Africa supports the \r\nAssembly’s adoption of the draft resolution entitled \r\n“Sport as a means to promote education, health, \r\ndevelopment and peace” (A/65/L.4), which we will \r\nalso sponsor. \r\n In conclusion, South Africa once again expresses \r\nits gratitude to the United Nations, especially the \r\nOffice of Sport for Development and Peace, and to the \r\nwider international community for all of the support \r\noffered to us during the World Cup. We hope that this \r\nevent has permanently changed the perceptions of \r\nmany about Africa. \r\n Ms. Picco (Monaco) (spoke in French): In the \r\ndays just after the convening of the summit Meeting on \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), my \r\ndelegation can only welcome the recognition that \r\nMember States have given to sports. Indeed, by \r\nadopting the final document (resolution 65/1), the \r\nheads of State and Government confirmed the \r\nrelevance of sport as a tool for education, development \r\nand peace that can promote cooperation, solidarity, \r\ntolerance, understanding, social inclusion and health at \r\nthe local, national and international levels. \r\n The Secretary-General’s participation in the \r\nround table on the issue of sport as a development tool, \r\norganized on the sidelines of the summit, is further \r\nevidence of his commitment to promote the power of \r\nsport. This power has already helped to raise public \r\nawareness of the problems affecting us all today, such \r\nas HIV/AIDS, sexually communicable diseases, hunger \r\nand all forms of violence. The power of sport also lies \r\nin its ability to bring communities closer and to \r\npromote essential values such as fair play and \r\ndiscipline. \r\n These important results are the culmination, on \r\nthe one hand, of the resolute action of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s Special Adviser on Sport for Development \r\nand Peace, Mr. Wilfried Lemke, whom we thank for \r\nhaving implemented the Action Plan set out by the \r\nGeneral Assembly. On the other hand, these \r\nachievements bear witness to our ability to work \r\ntogether and to the importance of partnerships.  \r\n While the contribution of sport and physical \r\nactivities to improving health no longer requires proof, \r\nits impact on overall development should be taken into \r\naccount to inform our policies. In the context of this \r\nsession of the General Assembly marked by the \r\nstrengthening of the role of women within the United \r\nNations, sport has more than ever demonstrated its \r\nability to promote women’s empowerment. We very \r\nmuch hope that the victory of Ms. Dalma Rushdi \r\nMalhas, the first Saudi athlete to take part in the Youth \r\nOlympic Games and whose performance we commend, \r\nwill inspire other young women to fully achieve their \r\npotential. \r\n The Sport for Development and Peace \r\nInternational Working Group, now acting under the \r\nstewardship of the Special Adviser, has developed the \r\nissue of sport within the context of child and \r\nadolescent development and has pinpointed strategic \r\npriority areas, which we fully endorse.  \r\n The initiative “Make Your Peace”, born at the \r\nXXI Winter Olympic Games and the X Paralympic \r\nWinter Games in Canada, brought the values of \r\nOlympism into homes, schools and workplaces. The \r\nimplementation of the Olympic Truce at the \r\nParalympic Games strengthened recognition of the \r\nrights of people with disabilities and contributed to \r\nsocial cohesion. \r\n As my colleague from South Africa has just \r\npointed out, the historic holding of the Fédération \r\ninternationale de football World Cup in South Africa in \r\nJune served to pay tribute to Africa. It was also an \r\nopportunity to highlight very important issues such as \r\nthe fight against human trafficking, racism, HIV/AIDS \r\nand the promotion of sustainable development. In \r\nparticular, it was an opportunity to highlight the United \r\nNations Development Programme Sustainable \r\nTransport Project, which is being carried out in \r\nconjunction with the Global Environment Facility, as \r\nwell as the South African campaign to green the World \r\nCup. \r\n But as the Special Adviser has often stressed, the \r\norganization of global events is not the only framework \r\nin which we should illustrate the effectiveness and \r\nbenefits of sporting activities. He has also been able to \r\nconvince us of the impact of simple initiatives at the \r\ngrass-roots level, such as the construction of a football \r\nfield for use by the local population of Bouaké, Côte \r\nd’Ivoire, which made it possible for them to better \r\nA/65/PV.32  \r\n \r\n10-58990 12 \r\n \r\naccept the United Nations operation in that country and \r\ninvolved them and the young people in the peaceful \r\ndevelopment of their country. \r\n During the Fédération internationale de football \r\nassociation World Cup, his Most Serene Highness \r\nPrince Albert II and Mr. Lemke, along with the Prime \r\nMinister of Western Cape Province Helen Zille and \r\nCapetown Mayor Dan Plato, inaugurated a community \r\ncentre devoted to development in the municipality of \r\nGugulethu that seeks to integrate disadvantaged youth \r\nin sporting activities. That programme should serve as \r\na model to be developed in other African cities. \r\n This unifying characteristic of sport was also \r\nseen in Haiti — where sport has afforded thousands of \r\nyoung people an opportunity to escape the difficulties \r\nof their daily lives — and is part of overall \r\nreconstruction efforts on behalf of populations stricken \r\nby natural disasters. \r\n The Secretary-General’s report (A/65/270) is \r\neloquent with respect to the many initiatives \r\nundertaken by Member States and about the different \r\nfields in which sport may have an impact, from road \r\nsafety to birth registration. For example, a joint \r\nprogramme between UNICEF, the United Nations \r\nOperation in Côte d’Ivoire and the International \r\nOlympic Committee uses football to raise awareness of \r\nthe importance of obtaining civil registration. The \r\nreport also highlights the crucial importance of \r\npartnerships involving Governments, the world of \r\nsports, civil society and regional cooperation efforts. \r\nThe contribution of the International Olympic \r\nCommittee to our work during this session was a clear \r\nexample of this. \r\n The Principality of Monaco will join this \r\ncommon endeavour, in keeping with the unreserved \r\ncommitment of His Most Serene Highness Prince \r\nAlbert II, the recipient last month of the United \r\nNations prize for the Millennium Development Goals \r\nin recognition of his involvement in support of peace \r\nthrough sport. \r\n My delegation, as co-Chair of the Group of \r\nFriends of Sport for Development and Peace, will also \r\ncontinue to make its contribution to the Office of the \r\nSpecial Adviser. As we succeed our Swiss colleagues \r\nin the co-chairmanship, we wish to pay tribute to them \r\nand express our warmest thanks for having established \r\nthis informal mechanism within the United Nations. As \r\nHis Most Serene Highness Prince Albert II has said, \r\ncontributing to peace is the finest battle that sport can \r\nwage, and it is this battle that we must win together. \r\n Mr. Solón (Plurinational State of Bolivia) (spoke \r\nin Spanish): Allow me to begin my statement by \r\nhighlighting the fact that for President Evo Morales \r\nAyma sport is an essential tool for attaining the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, given the vital impact \r\nit has on integration, peace and health, and above all \r\nbecause it helps reduce crime and contributes to the \r\nfight against drugs. \r\n President Morales, who usually travels with a \r\nfootball team accompanying him, makes sport an \r\nelement of integration among peoples, making it \r\npossible to overcome hurdles that have often kept \r\nneighbouring countries and peoples apart, as has been \r\nthe case in our region over the past few decades. \r\n For us in Bolivia, sport has become the main \r\nmechanism for developing football fields and sport \r\ncentres in a way that has never been done in previous \r\nyears. Bolivia has invested in sport because we feel \r\nthat it is the main mechanism for ensuring that young \r\npeople can be kept away from crime and drug \r\naddiction, as well as for bolstering ties of solidarity \r\nand fraternity. Above all, sport makes it possible to \r\novercome elements of discrimination and racism that \r\nstill exist in society, specifically through the promotion \r\nof sport among young people without regard to gender, \r\nthus ensuring that there is greater equality between \r\nmen and women.  \r\n For the Plurinational State of Bolivia, sport is a \r\nfundamental element for peace that makes it possible \r\nto overcome a great deal of the tension and a great \r\nnumber of the conflicts that often still exist. It is \r\nprecisely through sport that it is possible to bring about \r\na spirit of brotherhood and fraternity, hence the \r\nimportance that we as a State and Government ascribe \r\nto sport as a driving force for peace and development; \r\nfor we believe that a society that manages to achieve \r\nthe goal of overcoming poverty and marginalization is \r\nalso a society that above all promotes sport among its \r\ncitizens. Promoting sport means promoting health. For \r\nus, therefore, it is also a paramount founding element \r\nof development. \r\n We in Bolivia have decisively embarked upon an \r\neffort to show the world that sport at high altitudes in \r\nno way damages human health. Over the past few \r\nyears, regrettably, we have been hostage to a number of \r\nactions vetoing high altitude sport, specifically in \r\n A/65/PV.32\r\n \r\n13 10-58990 \r\n \r\nqualifying games for the World Cup in stadiums like \r\nthe one in the city of La Paz, which is at an altitude of \r\nmore than 3,600 metres. We have spoken out against \r\nsuch discrimination. Our President himself, together \r\nwith his football team, has demonstrated that playing \r\nabove 6,000 metres, on a football field on Cerro \r\nSajama, in no way affects health, and that everyone \r\nwithout exception must play without regard to the \r\naltitude, climate or weather conditions in which they \r\nmay find themselves. Sport should not be subject to \r\nany sort of discrimination. \r\n For the Plurinational State of Bolivia, it is vital to \r\npromote actions in support of sport in the fight against \r\ndrug addiction and drug trafficking. We are firmly \r\nconvinced that one of the great mechanisms for \r\nensuring that young people are kept away from drug \r\ntrafficking and drug addiction is through sport. We are \r\ntherefore great advocates of a major campaign to \r\npromote sport in the fight against drugs. \r\n Finally, Bolivia is resolutely committed to peace. \r\nWe believe that nothing brings people together more \r\nclosely than the practice of sport. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I call on the \r\nobserver of Palestine. \r\n Mr. Hijazi (Palestine): I would like to begin by \r\nthanking the Secretary-General for his report \r\n(A/65/270) and by commending the Special Adviser to \r\nthe Secretary-General on Sport for Development and \r\nPeace. We also commend the crucial role of the Sport \r\nfor Development and Peace International Working \r\nGroup in shaping the global framework of sport for \r\npeace and development, as well as other actors for their \r\nsupport for this important work. \r\n Palestine believes that the culture of sport is an \r\nimmensely positive force for development in any \r\nsociety. In this regard, we fully agree with the \r\nUNESCO characterization of sport as a fundamental \r\nright for all. Harnessing the positive energy inherent in \r\nsport — which demands respect for the human values \r\nof respect for all, including opponents, non-violence, \r\nteamwork, acceptance of rules and fairness — makes \r\nsport a valuable asset in any nation’s efforts towards \r\ndevelopment and peaceful coexistence. Sport is also an \r\nengine of economic development and social integration, \r\nwhich are crucial elements of overall development. \r\n Palestine has invested much sincere effort and \r\nenergy in this area, for we believe in the positive \r\npotential and the as yet unexplored development \r\ndimension of sport. In the past three years, Palestinian \r\nsport has truly evolved from being a luxury of the few \r\nto an aspiration within reach of all athletes regardless \r\nof social, economic or other difficulties. \r\n In that short span of time, Palestine has \r\ndeveloped and promoted women’s teams in various \r\nsports. Those teams have competed locally and \r\ninternationally, shifting women’s participation in \r\nPalestine from a few exceptions to an acceptable and \r\nencouraged area of professional and personal \r\nopportunity. In that regard, we would like to express \r\nour sincere appreciation for the support extended to \r\nPalestinian sport by the international community, \r\nparticularly by the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and \r\nBrazil. Their assistance has been invaluable and a \r\nsubject of deep appreciation from Palestinian athletes \r\nand the Palestinian people. \r\n Also during this period, Palestine has proudly \r\nhosted friendly and competitive games with \r\ninternational teams. These games were in fact a \r\ntestament to the progress that Palestinian sport has \r\nachieved and a reflection of our belief in sport as an \r\nagent of development and peaceful relations between \r\nnations. \r\n While we are profoundly proud of our \r\nachievements in sport thus far, we are also deeply \r\ntroubled by the continuous difficulties our athletes and \r\nefforts confront from the occupying Power. Our \r\nprogress has been slowed, and on some occasions \r\ndisrupted, by the various obstacles and restrictions \r\nneedlessly and punitively employed against our \r\nathletes and our efforts at development. \r\n Israel, the occupying Power, continues to obstruct \r\nthe right of Palestinian athletes to move and travel \r\nwithout hindrance. On several occasions, that punitive \r\npolicy has prevented some of our star athletes from \r\nparticipating in important team practice games in the \r\noccupied Palestinian territory and abroad. The latest \r\nsuch occasion was 5 October, when the captain of the \r\nPalestinian team, who lives in Gaza, was banned from \r\ngoing to the West Bank for a match. Those restrictions \r\nalso affect our ability to bring in sports equipment or to \r\ndevelop proper infrastructure, including stadiums. \r\n Such punitive restrictions have moved officials of \r\nthe Fédération internationale de football and the Union \r\nof European Football Associations to express their \r\nanger and grave concern at Israel’s continued \r\nA/65/PV.32  \r\n \r\n10-58990 14 \r\n \r\nobstruction of Palestinian athletes and sports \r\ndevelopment efforts. We commend those positions and \r\ncall on all concerned to do their utmost to curb such \r\npractices and their negative effect on Palestinian efforts \r\nto develop sport in general. \r\n Ms. Lucas (Luxembourg), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n Development and occupation cannot possibly \r\ncoexist. Any development effort, no matter how well \r\nplanned and executed, is subject to the illogical and \r\npunitive whims of the occupation. Occupation is a \r\nnegative force that shackles the occupied and inhibits \r\nthem from fulfilling their potential and achieving their \r\ngoals. However, in line with our commitment to the \r\nprinciples and fundamental values that sport represents, \r\nPalestine is determined to press ahead with its efforts \r\nto develop this field as an area of boundless potential \r\nfor Palestine, its development and its national goal — \r\npeace. \r\n We wish this important initiative every success in \r\nadvancing the universal language, culture and values of \r\nsport. We also hope that, as part of its State-building \r\nefforts, Palestinian sport will continue to receive \r\ninternational support and be the subject of the world’s \r\nfraternity.  \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): In \r\naccordance with resolution 64/3, of 19 October 2009, I \r\nnow call on the Observer for the International Olympic \r\nCommittee. \r\n Mr. Sithole (International Olympic Committee): \r\nOn behalf of the International Olympic Committee \r\n(IOC), I am pleased to support the adoption of draft \r\nresolution A/65/L.4, entitled “Sport as a means to \r\npromote education, health, development and peace”, \r\nand to take part in this important discussion on ways to \r\nmore effectively use the power of sport to promote \r\ndevelopment and peace. Allow me to acknowledge the \r\ninvaluable contributions of the United Nations and the \r\nSecretary-General in elevating the role of sport as a \r\ntool for development and peace. His annual report \r\n(A/65/270), which has been just presented, is living \r\nproof of that. \r\n In our capacity as Observer to the United Nations \r\nGeneral Assembly, the IOC intends to further \r\nstrengthen its ties and cooperation with the United \r\nNations and to assist Member States and the United \r\nNations Administration in their endeavours. Allow me \r\nalso to thank Mr. Wilfred Lemke, Special Adviser to \r\nthe Secretary-General on Sport for Development and \r\nPeace, for the important part that he is playing in \r\nexpanding the role of sport in United Nations human \r\ndevelopment and peacebuilding efforts. \r\n The IOC’s commitment to place sport at the \r\nservice of humankind is enshrined in its founding \r\ndocument, the Olympic Charter. The Charter defines \r\nOlympism as a philosophy of life that seeks to place \r\nsport at the service of the harmonious development of \r\nhumankind, with a view to promoting a peaceful \r\nsociety concerned with the preservation of human \r\ndignity. \r\n The sporting movement translates that philosophy \r\ninto actions in a variety of ways, starting, of course, \r\nwith its premier event, the Olympic Games. The Games \r\nprovide a global forum for peaceful competition and \r\ninteraction in an atmosphere of fair play and mutual \r\nrespect, showing by example that we can put aside our \r\ndifferences and find common ground. That ideal can be \r\nseen in some memorable moments, as exemplified by \r\nthe actions of the young people who participated in the \r\ninaugural Youth Olympic Games in Singapore last \r\nmonth. \r\n Much of the Olympic Movement’s development \r\nwork occurs far from the media spotlight. Last May, \r\nwe opened a new youth Olympic development centre in \r\nZambia. That innovative project combines sport with \r\neducational programmes, health services and \r\ncommunity events. It is a good example of an effective \r\nmultiparty partnership — in this case between the \r\nGovernment of the Republic of Zambia, the Zambian \r\nNational Olympic Committee and international and \r\nnational sports federations. \r\n Many of our efforts are closely aligned with the \r\nUnited Nations Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). For example, the promotion and \r\nempowerment of women in and through sport and \r\ngender equality are specifically addressed in the \r\nOlympic Charter. The IOC has steadily increased the \r\nparticipation and involvement of women in \r\ncompetitions and the organization of the Olympic \r\nGames. For the first time, women will participate in \r\nevery sport on the Olympic programme at the Games in \r\nLondon in 2012. \r\n The IOC formally acknowledged its obligation to \r\nenvironmental sustainability more than 15 years ago by \r\nadopting the environment as the third pillar of the \r\n A/65/PV.32\r\n \r\n15 10-58990 \r\n \r\nOlympic Movement, along with sport and culture. We \r\nwork closely with the United Nations Environmental \r\nProgramme to ensure that we live up to our \r\nresponsibilities in that area. We work with UNESCO, \r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner \r\nfor Refugees and other partners to provide value-based \r\neducation to young people and sustenance to refugees. \r\nWe work with the Joint United Nations Programme on \r\nHIV/AIDS, UNICEF, the World Health Organization \r\nand the Red Cross Movement to combat HIV and \r\nAIDS, malaria and non-communicable diseases. \r\n In many of those initiatives, sport is a catalyst for \r\naction. It breaks down barriers between communities. \r\nIt is a magnet for young people. It helps keep them in \r\nschool and focused. It gives them mental strength and \r\nteaches them leadership skills. They learn the true \r\nmeaning and value of teamwork and a team spirit. \r\n Sport is not the answer to all the world’s problems. \r\nIt does not even have the leading role in addressing \r\nthose problems. We look to the United Nations, \r\nGovernments and specialized non-governmental \r\norganizations to take the lead in promoting \r\ndevelopment. The IOC salutes the efforts of \r\nGovernments around the world to promote development, \r\nbut we also urge them to embrace sport as a partner in \r\nthose efforts and to give sport the attention, promotion \r\nand resources that it needs in order to effectively \r\ncontribute to national development agendas. \r\n The IOC acknowledges that real progress is \r\npossible with effective partnerships, as called for in \r\nMDG 8. The Secretary-General’s report offers example \r\nafter example, from countries around the world, of \r\nalliances that use sport in creative ways. The IOC and \r\nsport as a whole are doing their best, but more could be \r\ndone with more consideration of sport as a factor in \r\nhuman development and peace and by factoring it into \r\ndevelopment agendas at every level. \r\n However, we need comprehensive evaluation and \r\nmonitoring of sport programmes for human \r\ndevelopment so that we can learn what works and what \r\ndoes not. We need more research and better monitoring \r\ntools, including widely accepted benchmarks and \r\nstandards. \r\n Sport is a powerful tool for development and \r\npeace. The challenge is to make the most of that tool. \r\nThe International Olympic Committee stands ready to \r\nplay its part. The IOC assures the Assembly that it will \r\ndo its best to be its greatest partner. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): We \r\nhave heard the last speaker in the debate on this agenda \r\nitem. \r\n The General Assembly will now proceed to \r\nconsider draft resolution A/65/L.4, entitled “Sport as a \r\nmeans to promote education, health, development and \r\npeace”. \r\n I should like to announce that, since the draft \r\nresolution was submitted, the following countries have \r\nbecome sponsors: Albania, Andorra, Cape Verde, \r\nEritrea, France, Grenada, Haiti, Hungary, Jamaica, \r\nKazakhstan, the Netherlands, Papua New Guinea, \r\nParaguay, the Republic of Moldova, Saint Vincent and \r\nthe Grenadines, Serbia, South Africa and Togo. \r\n May I take it that the General Assembly decides \r\nto adopt draft resolution A/65/L.4? \r\n Draft resolution A/65/L.4 was adopted (resolution \r\n65/4). \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): May I \r\ntake it that it is the wish of the Assembly to conclude \r\nits consideration of agenda item 11? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n \r\nAgenda items 14 and 15 \r\n \r\nGlobal Agenda for Dialogue among Civilizations  \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/65/269) \r\n \r\nCulture of peace \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/65/269) \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/65/299) \r\n \r\n Mr. Habib (Lebanon) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to extend our sincere thanks to the \r\nPresident for organizing this important meeting. I \r\nwould also like to thank the Secretary-General for his \r\ncomprehensive report (A/65/269) on the activities \r\nrelated to the declaration of 2010 as the International \r\nYear for the Rapprochement of Cultures. That \r\ndeclaration was the logical result of the growing \r\ninternational awareness of the important need for a \r\nrapprochement of cultures through dialogue, which is \r\nan urgent issue of concern to us all. The meetings and \r\nsymposia that we have seen take place this year are \r\nperhaps the best testament to the importance of \r\ndiversity as a source of enrichment for humankind and, \r\nwhen exploited through constructive and innovative \r\nA/65/PV.32  \r\n \r\n10-58990 16 \r\n \r\ndialogue, as a fountain of creativity, modernity, \r\nprogress and advancement. \r\n I come from Lebanon, an eastern country that has \r\nhad a unique social and political experience and a \r\nnation that allows for dialogue and coexistence \r\nbetween religions and cultures that is an example of \r\ntolerance. Here I would like to recall the statement by \r\nthe President of Lebanon when he spoke before the \r\nAssembly on 24 September. He affirmed that Lebanon \r\nwill always remain open to dialogue and human and \r\ncultural interaction in a rich and creative manner, loyal \r\nto its main message, in spite of the challenges that it \r\nfaces, in the promotion of a State of law and order and \r\nthe values of democracy, freedom and harmony on \r\nwhich it is based. \r\n This year, in accordance with our openness to \r\ndialogue, we joined the Group of Friends of the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations. We consider the Alliance as \r\nan essential forum for dialogue among civilizations. \r\nThe Alliance guarantees the necessary space for \r\ninvolving civil society, including women and youth, \r\nand for exchanging experiences and building strategies \r\nin consolidating the culture of peace. \r\n Lebanon continues to call for rich human and \r\ncultural interaction in a constructive and innovative \r\nway. We believe that such dialogue begins with the \r\nrecognition of others’ identities and the religious and \r\ncultural characteristics of each group. We believe that \r\nfear, hostility and intimidation have no place in such an \r\neffort. \r\n In that regard, we welcome the tireless efforts \r\nmade by the United Nations and its specialized \r\nagencies and programmes, particularly UNESCO in the \r\ncultural, information and technological fields, with a \r\nview to enabling societies, especially women and \r\nyouth, to overcome ignorance and poverty and achieve \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. We also welcome \r\nall the symposiums that have been held and all the \r\nearly warning mechanisms that have been deployed to \r\npre-empt conflicts before they erupt and to deal with \r\nroot causes through the use of preventive diplomacy \r\nand the establishment of regional and international \r\npartnerships that work to prevent war and conflict, \r\nwhich have greatly afflicted our world. \r\n In the same context, Lebanon has always sent out \r\na message of dialogue, as exemplified during the \r\ninteractive dialogue that took place in the Security \r\nCouncil last May under the theme “Intercultural \r\ndialogue for peace and security” (see S/PV.6322). We \r\ndo this based on our belief in the importance of \r\ndialogue as a choice and a culture, as well as our \r\npledge to abide by the Charter and the International \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights. We hope that \r\ninternational efforts to promote dialogue among \r\ncivilizations will succeed in promoting not only a \r\nculture of peace but also stability, peace and security in \r\nthe whole world. The Middle East as a region deserves \r\ncomprehensive and just peace based on international \r\nresolutions, the Arab Peace Initiative in all its aspects, \r\njustice and what is right. \r\n The time has come for human development. Such \r\ndevelopment can only start with the promotion of a \r\nculture of peace that enhances communication and \r\ntolerance among civilizations and promotes mutual \r\nrespect among them in a responsible and transparent \r\nmanner. That should involve all stakeholders at the \r\ngovernmental level in identifying priorities and \r\novercoming disputes and differences through dialogue \r\nbetween developed and developing countries in order \r\nto rise to the challenges faced by humankind and find \r\nsolutions to real problems in line with people’s \r\nexpectations and aspirations. \r\n Mrs. Aitimova (Kazakhstan): First of all, the \r\ndelegation of Kazakhstan would like to express its \r\nappreciation to President Deiss for the holding of this \r\njoint debate on items 14 and 15 of the agenda, “Global \r\nAgenda for Dialogue among Civilizations” and \r\n“Culture of Peace”. \r\n We also wish to thank the Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon, for the comprehensive report on \r\nintercultural, interreligious and intercivilizational \r\ndialogue (A/65/269). It provides an overview of \r\nactivities undertaken by the main United Nations \r\nentities engaged in promoting dialogue among \r\ncivilizations, cultures and religions. Its findings and \r\nrecommendations take on great significance in our \r\ncontemporary times, when multilateralism is being \r\nstrengthened. Yet at the same time, paradoxically, there \r\nare forces that cause schisms and unrest in society. \r\n The report, submitted pursuant to resolutions 60/4 \r\nand 64/81, covers a wide range of themes, including \r\nthe International Year for the Rapprochement of \r\nCultures, which was initiated by Kazakhstan and \r\nsupported by Member States. \r\n We would like also to take note of the detailed \r\ninformation on the Third Forum of the United Nations \r\n A/65/PV.32\r\n \r\n17 10-58990 \r\n \r\nAlliance of Civilizations, and the work done so far to \r\ncarry forward the objectives of the United Nations in \r\nfostering global harmony and understanding through \r\noutreach and collaboration with faith-based organizations, \r\nas well as through communication, awareness-raising \r\nand educational activities around the world. \r\n Pursuant to resolution 64/81, in which the \r\nAssembly invited the Secretary-General to organize a \r\nspecial activity to celebrate the Year, a special event \r\nwas organized on 21 April 2010 at United Nations \r\nHeadquarters by the Department of Economic and \r\nSocial Affairs. The President of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-fourth session and the Secretary-General \r\nmade statements. \r\n At the meeting, different voices were heard, each \r\nreflecting on a specific dimension of public action to \r\npromote the rapprochement of cultures. The Vice-\r\nMinister of Culture of the Republic of Kazakhstan, \r\nMr. Telebekov, presented the unique experience of our \r\ncountry in establishing political and administrative \r\ninstitutions aimed at ensuring communication and \r\nunderstanding among the various cultures that create \r\nthe mosaic of Kazakhstan. \r\n At Kazakhstan’s suggestion, the United Nations \r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization — \r\nUNESCO — developed an action plan for observing \r\nthe International Year for the Rapprochement of \r\nCultures with a large number of events, forums and \r\nconferences convened worldwide. The Assembly \r\ndesignated UNESCO as the lead agency for the \r\nInternational Year, which was launched at UNESCO \r\nheadquarters in Paris on 18 February 2010. On that \r\noccasion, the Director-General of UNESCO convened \r\na high-level panel on peace and dialogue among \r\ncultures, which was comprised of prominent political, \r\nintellectual and religious personalities from all regions \r\nof the world. \r\n The focus on awareness-raising, implicit in the \r\ngoals of the Year, resulted in worldwide dissemination \r\nof information and the organization of several \r\ninternational and regional conferences, meetings and \r\nevents. To date, over 700 activities are envisaged \r\nwithin the framework of the Year. The variety of \r\nprojects presented in the fields of arts, education and \r\nyouth leadership bears witness to the different forms \r\nthat dialogue and the rapprochement of cultures can \r\nassume. Kazakhstan is of the view that regional \r\norganizations play a significant role in strengthening \r\ninternational dialogue. \r\n Acting as a coordinator of the Conference on \r\nInteraction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia \r\n(CICA), Kazakhstan has developed the action plan for \r\nimplementing the CICA Catalogue of Confidence-\r\nBuilding Measures in humanitarian issues, and also \r\norganized a series of international conferences on \r\nintercultural cooperation and tolerance. \r\n More recently, the Alliance of Civilizations has \r\nheld a vast array of high-profile events on the themes \r\nof multiculturalism and global understanding, both of \r\nwhich have gained high priority on its political agenda. \r\n The contributions of the relevant United Nations \r\nentities provided valuable input to the report and are \r\nhighlighted in its first two sections, which are devoted \r\nto the International Year for the Rapprochement of \r\nCultures, which is being celebrated in 2010 under the \r\naegis of UNESCO. The third section is devoted to the \r\nThird Forum of the Alliance of Civilizations, held in \r\nRio de Janiero in May 2010. \r\n In addition to the International Year for the \r\nRapprochement of Cultures and the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations, the United Nations system has continued \r\nto undertake a wide range of educational and \r\ncommunication activities to achieve the Year’s \r\nobjectives. \r\n Another valuable contribution of the United \r\nNations system to promoting interreligious dialogue \r\nconsists in collaboration with faith-based organizations \r\nand engaging them in its policy and advocacy work. \r\nSuch initiatives have a double positive effect: they \r\nbring together peoples from different faiths to discuss \r\nissues they have in common and they help to link those \r\ngroups as partners with the United Nations and its \r\ndevelopment objectives. \r\n In that context, President Nursultan Nazarbayev’s \r\ninitiative to convene congresses of leaders of the \r\nworld’s traditional religions, held in Kazakhstan, has \r\nbeen thriving since 2003 and has added to international \r\nefforts to promote interreligious and intercultural \r\ndialogue. I am convinced that Kazakhstan’s forum, \r\nwhich has been widely recognized as an effective \r\nplatform to discuss the role of religious leaders in \r\nfostering peace and other issues, will continue to \r\ncontribute in an extremely meaningful way towards \r\nA/65/PV.32  \r\n \r\n10-58990 18 \r\n \r\ndeveloping the worldwide process of the dialogue of \r\ncivilizations. \r\n I would like to stress that tolerance, trust, tradition \r\nand transparency constitute the guiding principles of \r\nKazakhstan’s 2010 chairmanship of the Organization for \r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). The key \r\nevent in that context was the OSCE High-level \r\nConference on Tolerance and Non-Discrimination, held \r\nin Astana on 29 and 30 June this year. That forum \r\ndemonstrated very effectively the importance of sharing \r\nexperiences with regard to inter-ethnic and \r\ninterreligious accord, as well as the need to fulfil \r\ncommitments to promote the OSCE values of tolerance, \r\nnon-discrimination and respect for diversity. In the \r\nwider context, the theme of tolerance will also be \r\nhighlighted during our 2011 chairmanship of the \r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference. \r\n In conclusion, let me express my confidence that \r\nour common collective effort at all levels, from the \r\ngrass-roots to the international, will reduce mistrust \r\nand prejudice and enhance genuine dialogue and \r\ncooperation among our myriad cultures, thereby \r\nfostering mutual understanding and stability in the \r\nworld. \r\n Mr. Al-Jarman (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in \r\nArabic): The discussions of the General Assembly \r\ntoday on the two items relating to the Global Agenda \r\nfor Dialogue among Civilizations and the Culture of \r\nPeace take on particular importance at a time when \r\nhumankind continues to face growing trends of \r\ninequality, occupation, oppression, conflict, violations \r\nof human rights and other forms of hatred and racism. \r\nThose trends reveal growing manifestations of \r\nextremism and defamation towards the cultures and \r\nbeliefs of others. Recent public tensions resulting from \r\nthe irresponsible and intolerant campaigns calling for \r\nattacks on Islam and Muslims, and foreigners in \r\ngeneral, and public reactions towards those campaigns \r\nunderline the gravity of this problem and its \r\nimplications. They also provide a strong motive for us \r\nto redouble our efforts towards strengthening \r\nmechanisms of dialogue and religious and cultural \r\ntolerance among all peoples, who all without exception \r\nshare in the common heritage of humankind. \r\n The United Arab Emirates — which believes that \r\ndialogue among civilizations and a culture of peace are \r\nkey priorities in its global strategy for protecting \r\nsocieties against all forms of violence, extremism and \r\nterrorism — was one of the first countries to support \r\nthe initiative on dialogue among civilizations launched \r\nby Turkey and Spain in 2005, as well as the initiative \r\nlaunched by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, \r\nKing Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, and all other \r\nimportant endeavours carried out by the United \r\nNations in that regard. The United Arab Emirates also \r\nsupported the Madrid Declaration of the World \r\nConference on Dialogue in 2008, which called for \r\npromoting the principles of peace and dialogue among \r\nreligions, and the recent ministerial meeting of the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations, which was held on the \r\nmargins of the general debate at the current session of \r\nthe General Assembly. \r\n The United Arab Emirates has sought to build \r\nbridges of confidence and partnerships with the rest of \r\nthe world through promoting a culture of dialogue, \r\ntolerance, openness and constructive cooperation with \r\nall countries, and regional and international groups. \r\nThose principles have also been reflected in a series of \r\nnational legislative measures and laws that ensure \r\nharmony and peaceful coexistence among ethnic \r\ngroups and followers of different faiths, and guarantee \r\ntheir freedom to practise their religious rites and \r\nceremonies and express their cultural diversity in the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates. That has contributed to \r\nconsolidating justice, strengthening the rule of law, and \r\npromoting respect for human rights and stability in the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates. \r\n The efforts by the United Arab Emirates were not \r\nlimited only to the national level, but also extended to \r\nthe international level, including through the provision \r\nof direct and indirect economic, humanitarian and \r\nrelief assistance to developing countries and countries \r\nemerging from conflict and natural disasters. This was \r\ndone with a view to supporting efforts aimed at \r\nachieving national reconciliation, rehabilitation and \r\nstability in those countries, and in promoting a culture \r\nof peace and respect for human rights. As a member of \r\nthe Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding \r\nof Intangible Cultural Heritage, under the auspices of \r\nUNESCO, the United Arab Emirates has worked on \r\nenhancing its multifaceted contribution to the \r\nprotection of the common heritage of mankind. \r\n We attach great importance to the efforts of the \r\nUnited Nations and other Member States to \r\nstrengthening international peace and security, the rule \r\nof law, concepts of tolerance, understanding, \r\nmultilateralism and solidarity among peoples, and a \r\n A/65/PV.32\r\n \r\n19 10-58990 \r\n \r\nculture of peace. We emphasize that in order to achieve \r\nall those goals, we need to start with a genuine global \r\npartnership that aims at encouraging dialogue among \r\nthe various cultures and civilizations and at instilling \r\nthe spirit of tolerance and respect for the sacred sites of \r\nother peoples and understanding the sensitive aspects \r\nof their cultures, especially in our globalized age, with \r\nits modern communication technologies that provide \r\nunique and ever greater opportunities for connecting \r\nand reaching people. \r\n As we believe that dialogue among civilizations \r\nmust take various forms, including North-South \r\ndialogue, East-West dialogue and other forms of \r\ncultural exchange, we affirm that mutual enrichment of \r\nany dialogue in that context must be based on equality, \r\nobjectivity and transparency. Such activities must also \r\ninclude adequate measures to address any acts of \r\nviolence or discrimination based on religion, race or \r\nsex, in order to contain their negative impact on \r\nsocieties. We therefore call for the development of a \r\nstandardized global approach to deal with acts that \r\nconstitute a clear and continuing threat to peace, \r\nsecurity and stability in the world. Measures to \r\ncriminalize incitement of violence on religious \r\npretexts, including incitement to abuse or desecrate \r\nsanctities of other religions, should also be adopted. \r\n We also emphasize, in that regard, the need to \r\naddress attempts aimed at defaming religions and at \r\ninciting religious hatred in general, by developing \r\nlocal, regional and international strategies based on \r\nconstructive debates and dialogue among cultures and \r\ncivilizations and full respect for all beliefs and \r\nreligions. In that regard, we declare our support, which \r\nhas been continuous for the past 10 years, for the \r\nGlobal Agenda for Dialogue among Civilizations, \r\nadopted by the General Assembly in resolution 56/6. \r\nWe also affirm our support for the declaration of 2010 \r\nas the International Year for the Rapprochement of \r\nCultures, with a view to demonstrating that diversity is \r\na source of enrichment, creativity and innovation for \r\nhumanity. \r\n This also leads us to realizing the importance of \r\ndemonstrating a true and serious international \r\ndetermination to address the root causes of emerging \r\nconflicts and disputes, especially the causes relating to \r\nthat oldest of conflicts, namely, the continued Israeli \r\noccupation of Palestinian and other Arab territories. \r\n Finally, we hope that our deliberations on the two \r\nagenda items will lead to strengthened plans for \r\nachieving greater understanding, rapprochement and \r\nopenness among countries and peoples, especially in \r\ncontaining and addressing the most pressing regional \r\nand international issues, including issues of security, \r\npeace, disarmament, poverty, unemployment and \r\nviolations of human rights. \r\n Mr. Al-Hubail (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): I have \r\nthe pleasure to convey our thanks to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the report before us (A/65/629), which \r\ndetails the achievements and activities of United \r\nNations bodies with respect to intercivilizational, \r\nintercultural and interreligious dialogue. I should also \r\nlike to pay tribute to the efforts of UNESCO for having \r\nsuccessfully celebrated 2010 as the International Year \r\nfor the Rapprochement of Cultures. We should like to \r\nthank the Director-General of UNESCO for her annual \r\nreport on the International Decade for a Culture of \r\nPeace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World \r\n2001-2010. \r\n The State of Kuwait is happy to participate in this \r\ndiscussion. We would like to reaffirm that the world \r\ncurrently faces great challenges resulting from views \r\nand ideologies characterized by extremism and bigotry, \r\nheld by some groups, entities and individuals in certain \r\ncountries of the world, which do not respect the \r\ncultures of others. Such intolerance has even reached a \r\nlevel where some use ideological and physical violence \r\nto impose their views and ideas. \r\n If we want to successfully support a \r\ncomprehensive and realistic dialogue among the \r\ncivilizations and peoples of the world, we must share a \r\nsincere desire to combat the extremist ideas and actions \r\non the part of some who disparage others’ religions, \r\ngiven that such ideas hamper United Nations efforts to \r\nbring about rapprochement. Otherwise, the other side is \r\ngiven new justifications for its attempts to spread its \r\nviolent ideas and convince others of the correctness of \r\ntheir views. \r\n My delegation salutes resolution 64/81, which \r\nstates, in paragraph 5, that the right to freedom of \r\nexpression carries with it duties and responsibilities \r\nthat may be subject to certain restrictions. We must \r\ndiscourage incitement against religious beliefs, because \r\nthat has negative consequences for human rights. We \r\nbelieve that in that regard a general evaluation is \r\nneeded of the efforts of the United Nations and \r\nA/65/PV.32  \r\n \r\n10-58990 20 \r\n \r\nnon-governmental organizations, as well as of efforts \r\nand initiatives by regional and international \r\norganizations. \r\n To achieve a strong and sound foundation for \r\ndialogue among civilizations, we need to unify the \r\nefforts and programmes of the various entities in order \r\nto promote interreligious and intercultural dialogue \r\namong civilizations. That will lead to the spread of the \r\nprinciples of peace, tolerance and respect. We must \r\nrecall here that a dialogue or alliance among \r\ncivilizations does not mean a fusion of cultures, creeds \r\nand faiths. Civilization is the tent that includes all \r\ncultures and religions; the purpose of dialogue among \r\ncivilizations is to study the roots of differences and to \r\ndeal with them, while being respectful of our \r\ndifferences. \r\n The State of Kuwait supports the efforts of the \r\nUnited Nations regarding an ongoing dialogue among \r\ncivilizations. As decreed by our head of State, we have \r\nput in place a national plan of action based on our \r\nbelief in outreach to and interaction among \r\ncivilizations. We have acceded to the initiative of the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations, joined its Group of Friends \r\nand participated in all its forums, particularly the third, \r\nheld in Rio de Janeiro in May. Openness towards other \r\ncultures, tolerance and interaction with others have \r\nbeen part of Kuwaiti culture, intellect and ideology \r\nfrom the beginning. That is enshrined in our \r\nConstitution, which allows others to practise their \r\nreligion freely, safely and in peace, and this has \r\nattracted people of 120 nationalities and from all \r\ncultures and religions to live in our country in stability, \r\ntolerance and mutual respect. \r\n A culture of peace and coexistence, based on \r\noutreach among civilizations, should be based on \r\nstrategic principles that give it strength and continuity, \r\nand should help civil society, individuals and \r\ninstitutions to achieve their objectives. We cite in that \r\nconnection Kuwait’s national plan of action, which has \r\nset forth four strategic principles to help achieve its \r\naims. First, we should reinforce our culture of peace, \r\nmoderation and tolerance; secondly, combat \r\nextremism, terrorism and violence; build a societal and \r\nnational consensus based on the principles and values \r\nof outreach among civilizations; and fourthly, \r\ncooperate with regional and international institutions, \r\nthus laying the foundations for understanding of our \r\nshared human concerns. Additionally, Kuwait has \r\nestablished an International Centre for Compromise \r\nthat calls for moderation in thought and compromise in \r\ndealing with others, which are based on the principles \r\nof our religion. The Centre has held many conferences \r\nand symposiums at the national, regional and \r\ninternational levels. \r\n Various specialized Government departments \r\nhave set up programmes and forums aimed at every \r\nsector of society in order to achieve awareness of \r\nmoderation and understanding among people. We have \r\nheld and sponsored many international and regional \r\nconferences and forums promoting an attitude of \r\nmoderation in Islam and how to spread religious \r\ntolerance and respect for beliefs and cultural \r\nspecificities among peoples, as well as how to achieve \r\nequality so that we may arrive at a climate of \r\ninternational security in which all civilizations can live \r\nin peace. \r\n Mr. Li Baodong (China) (spoke in Chinese): The \r\nChinese delegation welcomes the report of the \r\nSecretary-General on the culture of peace (A/65/269). \r\nIn our present world, increasing globalization, the \r\nspread of information technologies and more frequent \r\nexchanges among peoples of different countries have \r\nbrought civilizations ever closer to each other, creating \r\nfavourable conditions for dialogue and cooperation \r\namong them. In the meantime, peace and development \r\nhave yet to become a reality. New global challenges \r\nkeep emerging; clashes between civilizations have \r\nintensified; misunderstandings among religions and \r\ncultures still exist; and religious and racial \r\ndiscrimination are far from being eliminated. \r\n Against such a background, it has become all the \r\nmore important to strengthen dialogue and cooperation \r\namong civilizations. In recent years, the General \r\nAssembly has held a number of high-level meetings on \r\nintercultural and interfaith dialogue, which have \r\nhighlighted the importance and urgency of cultural \r\ncooperation and emphasized the intrinsic links between \r\ndialogue among civilizations and peace and \r\ndevelopment. This momentum of cooperation should \r\nbe maintained. At the same time, we should gain \r\nexperience and learn lessons from these efforts, while \r\nidentifying effective ways and best practices for \r\nenhancing the understanding, mutual trust and \r\ncooperation that can ensure concrete progress in this \r\narea. \r\n China believes that the following three points \r\nshould be observed in conducting dialogue and \r\n A/65/PV.32\r\n \r\n21 10-58990 \r\n \r\ncooperation among civilizations. First, we should \r\nrespect each other and conduct dialogue as equals. \r\nDiversity is a basic feature of human civilization, as \r\nwell as a common asset of human society. There are \r\nclose to 200 countries in the world. Despite their \r\ndifferences in terms of social systems, levels of \r\ndevelopment, cultures, traditions and religious beliefs, \r\nall have contributed to human progress. It is therefore \r\nnecessary for all countries to respect and learn from \r\none another and live together in peace. Extremism, the \r\nimposition of beliefs or values on others, \r\ndiscrimination based on religious, racial or other \r\ngrounds, bias, and xenophobia should be firmly \r\nrejected. \r\n Secondly, we must work on multiple fronts in \r\norder to achieve synergy. Culture and religion touch a \r\nwide range of areas and involve complex issues, so \r\nthere can be no cookie-cutter approach to dialogue and \r\ncooperation in this regard. Within the United Nations, \r\nmultiple initiatives and mechanisms, such as resolution \r\n64/81 on the promotion of interreligious and \r\nintercultural dialogue, understanding and cooperation \r\nfor peace, and the Alliance of Civilizations, have been \r\nlaunched. With their distinct features and advantages, \r\nthose initiatives and mechanisms should strengthen \r\ncommunication and coordination among themselves. \r\nThe United Nations should play an important role as a \r\nplatform for cultural exchange and should enable the \r\nvarious initiatives and mechanisms to complement \r\neach other and grow side by side. \r\n Thirdly, we should involve all sectors of society \r\nand work for concrete results. Dialogue among \r\ndifferent civilizations is ultimately about promoting \r\npeople-to-people contact. It should thus not be limited \r\nto the national level. Rather, civil society, academia \r\nand the media should all be mobilized to disseminate \r\nthe message of a culture of peace to communities and \r\nschools so as to bring the whole society on board. It is \r\nparticularly important to convey a message of \r\ntolerance, understanding and respect to the youth so as \r\nto build up their capacity to resist religious hatred and \r\ndiscrimination. The media should conscientiously \r\nassume their social responsibility by upholding \r\nmorality and contributing to the creation of an \r\natmosphere of tolerance and understanding in society. \r\n China is a multi-ethnic and multireligious country. \r\nThe Chinese civilization has been imbued with the \r\nconcept of harmony throughout history. The Chinese \r\nGovernment adheres to the policy of freedom of \r\nreligion, fully respects its citizens’ religious beliefs and \r\nsafeguards that freedom with the Constitution and other \r\nlaws. Different religions in China coexist in harmony \r\nand enjoy equal status. Religious and non-religious \r\ncitizens respect each other and live together in \r\nharmony. Religious figures in China carry forward fine \r\ntraditions of patriotism, religious devotion and \r\nphilanthropy and actively participate in charity work \r\nand other public welfare undertakings, thus contributing \r\nto social harmony and stability. \r\n China favours cultural diversity and believes that \r\ndifferent civilizations should learn from each other and \r\nseek common ground, while shelving differences, and \r\nshould jointly contribute to the prosperity and progress \r\nof mankind. China actively supports dialogue and \r\ncooperation among civilizations and religions and has \r\nhosted major events to that end, such as the Asia-\r\nEurope Meeting Interfaith Dialogue and the World \r\nBuddhist Forum. \r\n In two weeks’ time, Expo 2010 Shanghai will \r\ndraw to a close. As the first such global event hosted \r\nby a developing country in the history of world expos, \r\nit has attracted the participation of 246 countries and \r\ninternational organizations and over 60 million visitors \r\nover a period of five months. The Shanghai World \r\nExpo offers a platform for countries to demonstrate \r\ntheir cultural achievements and share development \r\nexperience, giving full expression to the diversity of \r\nthe world’s civilizations. It has become a showcase of \r\ncultural diversity and harmony and an event of \r\nhappiness and friendship for all. The Chinese \r\nGovernment will further strengthen cultural dialogue \r\nand exchanges with other countries with a view to \r\ncontributing to the creation of a world of lasting peace, \r\ncommon prosperity and harmony. \r\n Mr. Benítez Versón (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThe Assembly declared the period 2001 to 2010 the \r\nInternational Decade for a Culture of Peace and \r\nNon-Violence for the Children of the World (resolution \r\n53/25). Today, as we face the end of the decade, we \r\nmust frankly recognize that we have not met the goals \r\nwe set for ourselves. \r\n Cuba considers strict respect for the United \r\nNations Charter and its principles to be the fundamental \r\nbasis for achieving a culture of peace. Peace is not only \r\nthe absence of conflicts. Promoting a culture of peace \r\nrequires the promotion of education at all levels, \r\nA/65/PV.32  \r\n \r\n10-58990 22 \r\n \r\nsustainable economic and social development and \r\nrespect for all human rights for all people. \r\n There cannot be a culture of peace unless \r\nunderstanding, tolerance and solidarity are promoted, \r\nalong with respect for the history, diverse religions and \r\nindividual character of each nation. Achieving a culture \r\nof peace requires respect for cultural diversity.  \r\n We watch with concern some doctrines promoting \r\nthe clash of civilizations, demonizing cultures and \r\nreligions that are thousands of years old. Any doctrine \r\nbased on racial or cultural superiority must be firmly \r\nrejected. Equally unacceptable is the intention of some \r\nto identify certain cultures and religions with terrorism \r\nand violence. \r\n To succeed in establishing a culture of peace, \r\nclear commitments and concrete actions to promote \r\nsustainable development and environmental protection \r\nare necessary. Obstacles to the exercise of the right of \r\npeoples to self-determination must be also eliminated. \r\n There cannot be a culture of peace as long as the \r\nacquisition of territories through war is not recognized \r\nas unacceptable and some States act in ways contrary to \r\nthe United Nations Charter and international law. A \r\nculture of peace is not promoted by threatening the \r\nsovereignty and independence of other nations. How can \r\na culture of peace be achieved if, on one hand, annual \r\nmilitary expenditures increase at a dizzying rate — \r\nreaching the chilling figure of $1.531 trillion — while, \r\non the other hand, the number of hungry people reaches \r\nthe record figure of 925 million — nearly one sixth of \r\nthe world’s population? \r\n The introduction of the study of different cultures \r\nand civilizations in educational curricula would be an \r\nexcellent contribution to a culture of peace. The \r\nteaching of languages, history and the philosophies of \r\ncivilizations could be also included. \r\n Mass media also have an important role in \r\nspreading human values. We must promote ethical \r\nconduct and responsibility on the part of the media, so \r\nthat they contribute to mutual respect and dialogue \r\namong civilizations. \r\n Cuba supports the Declaration and Programme of \r\nAction on a Culture of Peace and the Global Agenda \r\nfor Dialogue among Civilizations and its Programme of \r\nAction. We also support UNESCO programmes and \r\npractical initiatives on this topic. \r\n A better world is possible. As wisely stated in the \r\nConstitution of the United Nations Educational, \r\nScientific and Cultural Organization, “since wars begin \r\nin the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the \r\ndefences of peace must be constructed”. The solution \r\nlies in our hands. We must act without further delay so \r\nthat a culture of peace and the Alliance among \r\nCivilizations finally prevail over the culture of \r\nviolence and war. \r\n Mr. Kleib (Indonesia): Let me begin by thanking \r\nthe Secretary-General for his report on intercultural, \r\ninterreligious and intercivilizational dialogue \r\n(A/65/269). We are also grateful for the report of the \r\nDirector-General of UNESCO on the activities carried \r\nout during the International Decade for a Culture of \r\nPeace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World, \r\n2001-2010 (see A/65/299). \r\n Indonesia welcomes and commends the role of \r\nthe various United Nations entities in supporting \r\nintercultural, interreligious and intercivilizational \r\ncooperation worldwide. Indonesia is also deeply \r\nappreciative of the work of the Tripartite Forum on \r\nInterfaith Cooperation for Peace and the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations to promote a culture of peace. \r\n Efforts to promote a culture of peace represent an \r\nimportant part of the interaction among all cultures and \r\ncivilizations. Dialogue and cooperation among peoples, \r\ncultures, religions, faiths and civilizations are essential \r\nfor the growth of a global culture of peace. There is no \r\ndoubt that much of the future of humankind depends on \r\npeaceful coexistence and cooperation among \r\ncivilizations, cultures and religions. Unfortunately, \r\nreligious hatred and intolerance, rather than \r\ndiminishing, are on the increase.  \r\n In the face of the recent polarization among \r\npeoples, as faith-based discrimination and racism were \r\nseen to be on the rise, we continue to believe that what \r\nunites us is much greater than what divides us. In our \r\nview, there is always room to nurture and celebrate our \r\ncommon values. It is our responsibility to ensure that \r\nthe world’s rich cultural diversity is appreciated as the \r\ndivine blessing that it is. \r\n That diversity is the invaluable collective heritage \r\nof humankind, which we ought to celebrate and \r\ntreasure. In order to turn our diversity to our \r\nadvantage, we need to scale up efforts to combat \r\nracism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related \r\n A/65/PV.32\r\n \r\n23 10-58990 \r\n \r\nintolerance, including discrimination against persons \r\nbased on their religion and beliefs. \r\n In our much more connected world today, action \r\nby a small and distant group can inflict significant \r\ndamage upon all the international community. As we \r\nsaw only recently, religious radicalism by a local \r\nreligious minority leader is capable of causing \r\nconsiderable damage to global interfaith harmony and \r\nworld peace. \r\n Indonesia would therefore like to see efforts to \r\npromote a culture of peace focusing more on the \r\nminority elements at strategic social levels, particularly \r\nthose who lead groups of people. In that connection, \r\nwe are concerned about the absence of a multilaterally \r\nnegotiated instrument containing normative standards \r\nthat can help diffuse religious radicalism. It is an ideal \r\nwhich we should work towards establishing. \r\n Indonesia is firmly committed to promoting a \r\nculture of peace. We keenly support initiatives that deal \r\nwith the challenges of cultural diversity, as they are \r\nvery much in line with what we are already doing in \r\nIndonesia. Dialogue and mutual accommodation \r\namong faiths and cultures have featured prominently in \r\nIndonesia’s history. That is how we have woven, from \r\nthe many strands of our ethnic cultures and traditions, \r\nthe single fabric of our nationhood. In Indonesia, \r\ndialogue is a prominent tool for ensuring harmony and \r\npeaceful living among the various communal groups \r\nand for ensuring stability and promoting development \r\nat the national level. \r\n Moreover, we empower the moderates whose \r\nvoices would otherwise be drowned by the agitation of \r\nextremists. In Indonesia, we are also organizing \r\ninterfaith and intercultural dialogue at the regional, \r\ninterregional and global levels. We have organized \r\nsuch dialogue in tandem with other Governments, \r\ninternational organizations, civil society and the mass \r\nmedia. Here, at the United Nations, we have \r\nconsistently supported all resolutions on the agenda \r\nitem “Culture of peace”. \r\n Indonesia also attaches great significance to the \r\ninitiatives of Member States to promote respect for \r\ndiversity, freedom, justice and tolerance. All such \r\nexisting initiatives in interfaith, intercultural and \r\nintercivilizational dialogue have become part of a \r\nglobal network aimed at promoting peace and harmony. \r\n However, it is important to point out that even all \r\nthose undertakings are not enough if they remain only \r\nwithin conference halls. We must therefore recognize \r\nthat, indeed, dialogue is not an end in itself. All those \r\ndialogues going on all over the world today will \r\namount to nothing if they do not lead to cooperative \r\naction at the grass-roots level. \r\n It is our responsibility to ensure that those \r\ndialogues lead to the development of communities that \r\nwork for the welfare of their fellow human beings, \r\nwhile enlightening one another on the need for mutual \r\nunderstanding and mutual appreciation. Dialogue \r\nshould foster communities that take on a positive role \r\nin the life of the nation by encouraging and inspiring \r\nthe Government to adhere to democratic principles and \r\nto promote and protect human rights and individual \r\nfreedoms, regardless of ethnicity or religion. It should \r\nlead to communities that appreciate the unique \r\nqualities and perspectives of other peoples. \r\n If all nations can nurture such communities, then \r\nwe are well on our way to developing a global culture \r\nof peace. \r\n Mr. Cabactulan (Philippines): At the outset, I \r\nwould like to extend the gratitude of the Republic of \r\nthe Philippines to the President for his able leadership \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. As \r\nthe community of nations moves forward in pursuit of \r\nour common goals of lasting peace, progress and \r\nprosperity, may I express the firm commitment of the \r\nPhilippines to work closely with him and our partners \r\nin order to achieve our shared vision for ourselves and \r\nour posterity. \r\n We meet at a time of great opportunities and \r\nmany challenges. Technological developments, all \r\nmade at a breakneck pace, bring the bright promise of \r\nour peoples being drawn ever closer together. Yet even \r\nas we see different peoples and communities coming \r\ntogether in the spirit of understanding and charity with \r\nthe message of peace and coexistence, there are those \r\nwho seek to break the bonds of goodwill that have \r\nbrought many peoples together. For those dark \r\nelements seek to inflict pain and suffering, to foster \r\nrancour and resentment, and to force violence and fear \r\nupon the world. \r\n It is regrettable that our people have to endure \r\nviolence in its many malevolent forms. Peoples are \r\nbroken further apart by those who seek to sow \r\nconfusion, doubt and suspicion. There are those who \r\nA/65/PV.32  \r\n \r\n10-58990 24 \r\n \r\nprey on the disenfranchised and the marginalized and \r\nsurreptitiously use the faith, culture and religion of \r\nothers to push and justify their own dark agenda. Faith, \r\nculture and religion have been turned against \r\nthemselves and used to drive people to despair and to \r\nperform acts of violence. \r\n The Philippines joins other nations in \r\ncondemning those acts in all their forms and \r\nmanifestations. The Philippines likewise asserts that \r\nsuch acts should not be associated in any way with any \r\nculture, faith or religion. \r\n For the Philippines and, indeed, for the rest of the \r\nworld, faith, culture and religion rightly give millions \r\nof people hope in this world, the will to treat others \r\nlike themselves, and the impetus to work with others \r\ntowards a more inclusive and more understanding \r\nworld. That abiding belief has moved us to harness the \r\nworld community’s collective strength to further \r\nstrengthen the foundations of a world respectful of \r\nhumanity’s diversity. \r\n Civil strife in the southern Philippines brought \r\nout the importance of interfaith dialogue in the \r\npromotion of understanding, peace, cooperation and \r\ndevelopment among stakeholders. In that same spirit, \r\nMindanao will once again commemorate its annual \r\nWeek of Peace, begun in the mid 1990s. Our work \r\ncontinues to this day, with interfaith dialogue and \r\nreconciliation remaining key features of the Philippine \r\nmedium-term development plan. \r\n Seeking to engage the world community in that \r\nendeavour, in 2004 the Philippines initiated resolution \r\n59/23, on the promotion of interreligious dialogue. \r\nThat resolution proved to be a landmark in that it \r\nopened the portals of the United Nations to interfaith \r\npartnerships and cooperation in the cause of justice and \r\npeace. \r\n Since then, we have seen a series of resolutions \r\non interfaith, interreligious and intercivilizational \r\ndialogue approved by consensus: resolution 60/10, \r\nentitled “Promotion of interreligious dialogue and \r\ncooperation for peace”; resolutions 61/221, 62/90 and \r\n63/22, jointly introduced by the Philippines and \r\nPakistan from 2006 to 2008; and resolution 64/81, also \r\njointly presented by the Philippines and Pakistan, on \r\nthe promotion of interreligious and intercultural \r\ncooperation for peace. \r\n The concrete outcomes of those resolutions \r\ninclude the holding by the General Assembly of the \r\nHigh-Level Dialogue on Interreligious and \r\nIntercultural Understanding and Cooperation for Peace; \r\nthe designation of the Office for Economic and Social \r\nCouncil Support and Coordination in the Department \r\nof Economic and Social Affairs as the focal unit in the \r\nSecretariat to handle, within the United Nations \r\nsystem, all interreligious, intercultural and \r\nintercivilizational matters; and the proclamation of \r\n2010 as the International Year for the Rapprochement \r\nof Cultures. \r\n A core group of 16 countries, 3 United Nations \r\nbodies and the 110-member Committee of Religious \r\nNon-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) at the \r\nUnited Nations was formed, leading to the holding in \r\n2005 of the Conference on Interfaith Cooperation for \r\nPeace at United Nations Headquarters. That became the \r\ntroika of the Tripartite Forum on Interfaith Cooperation \r\nfor Peace, which has now grown to include  \r\n55 Governments, 15 United Nations agencies and 110 \r\nreligious NGOs at the United Nations. It has developed \r\na new paradigm of understanding and cooperation, \r\nwhich is described as faith-fuelled and love-inspired. \r\n Likewise, an informal summit of like-minded \r\nworld leaders met in 2005 on the sidelines of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and adopted a declaration urging \r\nefforts for interreligious, intercultural and \r\nintercivilizational dialogue and cooperation. We have \r\npostponed the similar informal summit scheduled for \r\nthis year until next year so that it can be immediately \r\npreceded by a ministerial meeting. \r\n Beyond these positive developments at the United \r\nNations, five Asia-Pacific Regional Interfaith \r\nDialogues have been held: in Jakarta; Cebu, \r\nPhilippines; Waitangi, New Zealand; Phnom Penh; and \r\nPerth, Australia. Between regions, we have had six \r\ninterfaith dialogues in the Asia-Europe Meeting: in \r\nBali, Indonesia; Larnaca, Cyprus; Nanjing, China; and \r\nin Amsterdam, Seoul and Madrid. \r\n The following have also been held: the third \r\nGlobal Inter-Media Dialogue, in Bali; the World \r\nConference on Dialogue, in Madrid; the sixth general \r\nmeeting of the World Public Forum “Dialogue of \r\nCivilization”, in Rhodes, Greece; the second Alliance \r\nof Civilizations Forum, in Istanbul, Turkey; the 2009 \r\nParliament of the World’s Religions, in Melbourne, \r\n A/65/PV.32\r\n \r\n25 10-58990 \r\n \r\nAustralia; and the third Congress of Leaders of World \r\nand Traditional Religions, in Astana. \r\n In a clear demonstration of its commitment to the \r\ncause of interfaith dialogue, the Philippines hosted the \r\nspecial Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) ministerial \r\nmeeting on interfaith dialogue and cooperation for \r\npeace in Manila in December 2009. Espoused by 118 \r\nmember countries of the NAM, it was the first \r\nmovement of its kind that mainstreamed civil society, \r\nparticularly the religious and faith organizations, as \r\ngovernmental partners in such vital areas as peace and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Those and other efforts have been documented in \r\na book entitled Peace through Interfaith Dialogue: \r\nPhilippine Diplomacy and the Promotion of Mutual \r\nUnderstanding, Respect and Tolerance. We are pleased \r\nto provide copies of this book to the members of the \r\nAssembly. \r\n In April 2010, I was honoured to join the special \r\nevent marking the commemoration of 2010 as the \r\nInternational Year for the Rapprochement of Cultures. \r\nHeld just ahead of the Review Conference of the \r\nParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons, which the Philippines chaired, the \r\nevent was a fitting capstone to what we have worked so \r\nhard to achieve all these years. \r\n But our work is not yet done. Sustaining the \r\nmomentum is vital, as is engaging all stakeholders in \r\nthe interfaith dialogue process. The push and pull \r\nbetween those who stand together for dialogue, \r\ntolerance, understanding and respect, on the one hand, \r\nand those who seek the fall of all into the abyss of \r\nsuspicion, bigotry, confusion and violence, on the other \r\nhand, continues. We must continue moving forward \r\ntogether. \r\n For its part, the Philippines will continue to work \r\nclosely with and consult our partners on the tabling of \r\nanother draft resolution on the agenda item on the \r\nculture of peace. We seek to further expand interfaith \r\ndialogue to include, inter alia, dialogue with \r\nindigenous peoples. We must ensure that, on the road \r\nto greater peace and development, dialogue is as \r\ninclusive and broad as possible. \r\n As we welcome the introduction of Jordan’s draft \r\nresolution on the holding of World Interfaith Harmony \r\nWeek (A/65/L.5) as a reminder of our continuing duties, \r\nwe will consult with our co-sponsors on the best way \r\nforward on the proposal for a decade of interreligious \r\ndialogue as we await the report of the Secretary-General \r\non the matter at the sixty-sixth session. \r\n We encourage all Member States to submit their \r\ncomments on the Secretary-General’s report concerning \r\nthe issue. We also urge all Member States to participate \r\nactively in the efforts to foster interfaith dialogue. \r\n The road ahead of us and the journey forward \r\nremain long. However, we are confident that we will \r\nreach our destination, with every milestone that we \r\nachieve. Fully resolved to turn our vision into reality, \r\nwe will forge on undeterred, learning from each other, \r\nunderstanding one another and respecting others as we \r\nrespect ourselves. \r\n Mr. Dos Santos (Paraguay) (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nwould like to express the gratitude of the Government \r\nof Paraguay for the preparation of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report on agenda item 15, “Culture of peace” \r\n(A/65/269), and his note transmitting the report of the \r\nUNESCO Director-General (A/65/299). We are sure \r\nthey will contribute to our debate today. \r\n The delegation of Paraguay would like to speak \r\nonce again in support of the culture of peace. We want \r\nto resolutely cooperate to achieve the noble objective \r\nof the United Nations and its Members: achieving a \r\nbroad and deep understanding among the various \r\ncultures. For that, we have endorsed and will continue \r\nto support enthusiastically the initiatives for a dialogue \r\nbetween different peoples, Governments and religions. \r\n Humankind is unique in its origins but diverse in \r\nits cultural manifestations. The only way for it to \r\novercome the injustice and violence afflicting it is \r\nthrough dialogue. Dialogue must be based on accepting \r\ndiversity. In violence, unlike dialogue, there is no \r\nacceptance. There is only the elimination of different \r\nideas, or at least an attempt to do so. Dialogue will be \r\ndialogue only if we accept — or better yet, tolerate — \r\nthe cultural and religious differences that identify each \r\ncommunity and each nation but that, ultimately, are the \r\ninseparable elements that make up humankind. \r\n In order to promote the dialogue between cultures \r\nand civilizations, my delegation wishes to propose that \r\nthe United Nations proclaim 30 July of each year \r\nWorld Friendship Day, to contribute to building a more \r\nfraternal global society, thus fostering the culture of \r\npeace, respect and mutual acceptance at the \r\ninternational level, without any kind of distinction or \r\ndiscrimination. This initiative, which has been a \r\nA/65/PV.32  \r\n \r\n10-58990 26 \r\n \r\ntradition in my country for over 50 years, has the \r\ninstitutional support of the Government. It was \r\ncirculated in document A/64/883 at the previous \r\nAssembly session and was announced in the Hall \r\nduring the general debate of the current session by the \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of my country as a \r\nproposal to renew mutual appreciation and recognition \r\nbetween our peoples (see A/65/PV.23). \r\n Appropriately, our delegation will conduct the \r\nrelevant consultations with the various countries and \r\nregional groups in order to present shortly a draft \r\nresolution that proclaims the World Friendship Day. I \r\nwould like to request all delegations to lend their \r\nsupport to this initiative so that it will meet with \r\nsuccess. \r\n Mr. Salsabili (Islamic Republic of Iran): We are \r\nhere today for a joint debate on two interrelated agenda \r\nitems in order to follow up on the progress of our work \r\non the enhanced promotion of a culture of peace and \r\nthe Global Agenda for Dialogue among Civilizations \r\nthrough interreligious, intercultural and \r\nintercivilizational dialogue and cooperation. Let me \r\nthank the Secretary-General and the Director-General \r\nof the United Nations Educational, Scientific and \r\nCultural Organization (UNESCO) for all of their \r\nefforts to prepare the two thought-provoking reports \r\ncontained in documents A/65/269 and A/65/299 on \r\nthese two very significant items on the agenda of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n Cultural diversity as the centrepiece of the two \r\nagenda items — “Global Agenda for Dialogue among \r\nCivilizations” and “Culture of peace” — is thoroughly \r\ndiscussed and reflected in these two reports as a real \r\nand basic fact of today’s regional and international \r\nrelations. Such a fundamental fact should not be seen \r\nas a barrier to our collective endeavour to advance \r\ndialogue and understanding. \r\n Respect for cultural diversity at the national and \r\ninternational levels and recognition of the fact that \r\ncultural diversity is a source of unity rather than \r\ndivision within the international community will \r\nindeed promote peace and security. Thus, cultural \r\ndiversity is an asset that enriches the common human \r\ncultural heritage. Hence, continued cultural domination \r\nthrough policies of cultural hegemony and efforts to \r\neliminate cultural identities through the globalization \r\nprocess will result in major setbacks to the promotion \r\nof human rights, international cooperation and the \r\nmutual enrichment of the cultural life of humankind. \r\n On the other hand, respect for and understanding \r\nof others could be considered key elements in \r\nenhancing international cooperation. The practice of \r\nlistening to others rather than confronting or offending \r\nthem should be cultivated and promoted as a culture \r\namong actors at all levels of international politics. \r\nGlobalization as a process can pose challenges and \r\ncreate opportunities in this domain. \r\n Repressive measures in the increasingly \r\nglobalized world could take the form of disinformation \r\nthrough the global media and modern communication \r\ntechnologies. Religious intolerance, including \r\nIslamophobia, created as a result of aggressive media \r\npolicies, seeks to demonize particular cultures and \r\nreligions and can lead ultimately to hatred and \r\nexclusion. This should be prevented through an \r\ninnovative and alternative plan for international \r\ncooperation among all nations. \r\n We believe that diversity is necessary for \r\nhumankind to flourish. We should resist the \r\nperceptions and temptations that set individual against \r\nindividual, group against group and nation against \r\nnation. Above all, ways to eliminate the defamation of \r\nreligions and discrimination based on religion or belief \r\nshould be deliberated. Religious intolerance, the \r\nspreading of hatred, xenophobia and racial \r\ndiscrimination are but a few examples of issues long \r\nfaced by the international community. Many of us have \r\nvoiced our vehement condemnation of the defamation \r\nof religions, yet we have continued to witness instances \r\nof poisonous actions against certain religions and their \r\nsacred books, beliefs and followers. The recent attempt \r\nto put the Koran, the most sacred book of each and \r\nevery one of the more than 1.6 billion Muslims of the \r\nworld, into a fire was a clear example of such a crime. \r\nSuch actions should be duly dealt with by States. \r\n This alarming act was also a warning against the \r\nrising trend of discriminatory national laws and \r\npolicies adopted and implemented against any religion. \r\nAttempts to stigmatize groups of people — in \r\nparticular, people of certain ethnicities and religious \r\nminorities — on the basis of their religion under \r\nvarious pretexts related to issues of security and illegal \r\nimmigration are among the major obstacles to our \r\napproach to respect cultural diversity. \r\n One way to respond could be to enhance the \r\ncultural policies of Member States at the national and \r\nregional levels in order to strengthen respect for \r\ncultural diversity and intercultural dialogue in practical \r\n A/65/PV.32\r\n \r\n27 10-58990 \r\n \r\nterms. The Non-Aligned Movement Centre for Human \r\nRights and Cultural Diversity in Tehran has been \r\nestablished and is actively contributing to the \r\npromotion of such an idea. \r\n Besides honouring the events marking the \r\ncommemoration of 2010 as the International Year for \r\nthe Rapprochement of Cultures, one of the other \r\npractical achievements in the process of promoting \r\ncultural diversity as a means of cooperation to enhance \r\npeace among different nations is respect for traditional \r\ncommon cultures. \r\n On 23 February, the General Assembly \r\nunanimously adopted resolution 64/253, entitled \r\n“International Day of Nowruz”. The resolution was the \r\nfruit of joint efforts by eight Member States, including \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran. While the resolution \r\nreaffirms the purposes and principles of the Charter, in \r\nparticular the achievements of international cooperation \r\nin the economic, social and cultural fields — including, \r\ninter alia, resolution 56/6, on the Global Agenda for \r\nDialogue among Civilizations; the Declaration of the \r\nPrinciples of International Cultural Cooperation, and \r\nthe Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity, \r\nadopted by UNESCO — it also underlines the appeal \r\nfor greater solidarity on the basis of recognition of \r\ncultural diversity, of awareness of the unity of \r\nhumankind and of the development of intercultural \r\nexchanges. It emphasizes the need to achieve an \r\nobjective understanding of all civilizations and to \r\nenhance constructive interaction and cooperative \r\nengagement among civilizations by playing a major \r\nrole in strengthening the ties among peoples based on \r\nmutual respect and the ideals of peace and good-\r\nneighbourliness. Nowruz traditions and rituals reflect \r\nthe ancient cultural customs of the civilizations of East \r\nand West that have influenced those civilizations \r\nthrough the interchange of human values. \r\n Finally, let me confirm the fact that the promotion \r\nof dialogue among civilizations and cultures is a key \r\ncomponent of UNESCO’s mission and activities and \r\nhas led that organization to shoulder a significant \r\nportion of that task. With this in mind, my delegation \r\nwill spare no effort in cooperating at the next meeting \r\nof the UNESCO High Panel on Peace and Dialogue \r\namong Cultures, which will be convened by the \r\nDirector-General of UNESCO within the next two \r\nmonths at United Nations Headquarters here in New \r\nYork to identify new avenues and modalities for future \r\naction. \r\n Mr. Haroon (Pakistan): I thank the President for \r\nconvening this very important debate of the General \r\nAssembly this morning. From the attendance here, one \r\ncan be absolutely sure that peace does not have as large \r\na following in the Assembly as the elections did a few \r\ndays ago, when there was only standing room here. \r\nAnd of course, as we know, anything that is \r\ncontentious is bound to lead away from, and not \r\ntowards, peace. So, judging by the visuals here today, I \r\nfear that we have a long way to go in pursuing this \r\nmatter of introducing the culture of peace. \r\n I am not terribly sure whether, by not including \r\nthe culture of peace in the Millennium Development \r\nGoals, we have done something good for this institution \r\nor not. But, surely, this matter is very important. \r\n We start off by citing anything that becomes \r\ncontentious as a danger to peace, but I think that there \r\nis much more to it than that. There will always be \r\ndivisive policies, ideologies and the belief that might is \r\nright to inflict upon others what concerns people about \r\ntheir way of life. I think the greatest hindrance to \r\nanything cogent emerging is that, when we sit in this \r\nHall, we all speak of our ways, our countries, our \r\ndelegations and our groups. If we continue to do that, I \r\nam not terribly sure that peace will prevail. There may \r\nbe outward calm and there may be a lot that is not said \r\nout of respect for each others’ feelings, but certainly \r\npeace will not prevail in the world or in this Hall, other \r\nthan in outward appearance. \r\n The Charter of the Organization has enunciated \r\nthe principles of practising tolerance, living together in \r\npeace with one another as good neighbours, uniting our \r\nstrengths to maintain international peace and security \r\nand promoting social progress and better standards of \r\nlife in larger freedom. I think that the moment the \r\nCharter spells out the concept of good neighbours, it \r\nseems like an exclusion or preclusion of those beyond \r\nour boundaries who consider themselves to be \r\nimpregnable or invulnerable as sovereign States. \r\n Peace should not be just the extension of good-\r\nneighbourly relationships; it should go beyond and \r\nexist as a culture. That is what we are saying here \r\ntoday. I find that the Charter is not sufficient. It is in \r\nfact deficient in the proclamation of what we are trying \r\nto achieve. \r\n In 1999, we reaffirmed our intention to continue \r\nto work to achieve peaceful coexistence in line with the \r\nUnited Nations Charter. That was a declaration based \r\nA/65/PV.32  \r\n \r\n10-58990 28 \r\n \r\non the principles of multilateral cooperation, respect \r\nfor life, the promotion and practice of non-violence \r\nthrough education, dialogue, cooperation and \r\ncommitment to the peaceful settlement of disputes. \r\n Now, as far as the peaceful settlement of disputes \r\nis concerned, I am afraid that nowhere in the world — \r\njudging from the fact that accidents taking place on \r\nnarrow streets can be the pretext for small-scale, or \r\neven large-scale, rioting — have we really even \r\nconceived of a culture that would promote peace \r\ninstead. And history has proven that no trauma that \r\nfollows such disputes can be resolved by a peaceful \r\nending. \r\n Some of the greatest changes in history have \r\ntaken place on the backs of disputes that have changed \r\nthe way humankind thinks. They have changed the way \r\nthe Earth is progressing towards a better future. I am \r\nafraid that that culture cannot be born out of a lack of \r\ndispute when disputes are settled with verbiage that \r\ncannot be understood by those who sign the \r\ndocuments. These things will have to be resolved in \r\ntheir own fashion. It is that resolution which leads to \r\nchange, not the words spelled out in a document. \r\n I know that we have a common set of universal \r\nvalues. Peace is the core message of all religions. It is \r\nnot war alone that challenges peace, but it is one of the \r\nprimary indicators of lack of peace. The first \r\nintroduction of war on this planet was, in fact, at the \r\nbeginning of the new age that started in the first \r\ncentury, when Judaism was joined first by Christianity, \r\nand later with Islam. The monotheistic religions on \r\nrecord have produced more wars and more suffering in \r\nhistory than anything else before them, yet the \r\nprofession of faith is based upon peace. \r\n So we have to understand that it is peace that we \r\nseek. The culture of this peace is not easily definable. \r\nIf Charles I of England had not abrogated Parliament \r\nand sent the Rump Parliament home, the changes that \r\nbrought democracy and the Commonwealth to England \r\nmight never have taken place. Yet from that catharsis \r\nand that trauma grew a very serious pledge to steer the \r\nworld towards better peace. \r\n Unfortunately, religion keeps a strong grip on \r\nhate. Hate is a very strong weapon in the hands of \r\ndifferent faiths, and it is being used mercilessly. The \r\ncomplete killing of the Mayan culture in Central \r\nAmerica was based not on a profession of peace and \r\nlove, but upon hate and the extermination of an entire \r\nculture — not just the extermination of the people, but \r\nthe burning of their famous libraries, which many now \r\nbelieve to have been the largest repositories of world \r\nscience, education and history. \r\n Today we see in various parts of the world all \r\nsorts of misunderstandings that are again based on \r\nfaith. We had a recent expression of it here in America, \r\nwhere hate was again put forward in an attempt to \r\ncreate Samuel Huntington’s clash of civilizations. I feel \r\nthat we are very lucky that due cognizance was taken, \r\nand I say this with a great amount of respect for many \r\norganizations, not only the American Government but \r\nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference, which kept \r\na harness on the issue and brought it to its due end. \r\n We need to stand together to decry those who, in \r\nthe name of faith, extend agendas that are no longer \r\nacceptable to the people of this world. Finding \r\ncommon ground is certainly important, but I feel that, \r\nmore than that, among the great things that are needed, \r\none would be education. A second would be an easily \r\navailable, honest and sincere approach to justice. To \r\nmy mind, the third would be the acceptance of a \r\ncommon agenda in all constitutions of the world that \r\nprofess and express the need for a culture of peace as a \r\npreamble and a necessity — not mere lip service, but \r\nan understanding of its implications. We should pass it \r\ninto law. \r\n I would say that, when we co-sponsored interfaith \r\nharmony in the General Assembly with the Philippines; \r\nwhen we speak in many ways in the Assembly; and, of \r\nlate, when I see my colleagues from the Indian desk \r\nsitting here, we have gone a long way in trying to \r\npromote understanding. That understanding manifested \r\nitself beautifully in the recent tennis finals of the most \r\nsenior tournament in the world today, the US Open, \r\nwhere it was important, I believe, for India and \r\nPakistan to show the world that we could move \r\ntowards peace as well. \r\n We recognize the growing need to promote \r\nharmony in all its manifestations, and we believe that \r\nwe must take away challenge and replace it with \r\nacceptance. We should take away harassment and \r\nreplace it with tolerance. We should take away hatred \r\nand bring it towards understanding. Cooperation, not \r\nthe clash of civilizations, must be the paradigm for our \r\nfuture on this planet. In order to make this world a \r\nbetter place for our children, we should share the \r\nresponsibility to highlight and propagate our common \r\n A/65/PV.32\r\n \r\n29 10-58990 \r\n \r\nvalues of peace, tolerance, equality and sharing — \r\nwhich we have forgotten — and a respect for humanity. \r\nWe should encourage the next generation to use \r\neducation and exchange not only to adapt to modernity,  \r\nbut to use modernity and technology to change the \r\nworld into a better and more peaceful place for all. \r\n The meeting rose at 1.10 p.m. \r\n"
