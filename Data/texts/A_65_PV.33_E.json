(Switzerland) \r\n \r\n \r\n In the absence of the President, Mrs. Waffa-Ogoo \r\n(Gambia), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda items 14 and 15 (continued) \r\n \r\nGlobal Agenda for Dialogue among Civilizations  \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/65/269) \r\n \r\nCulture of peace \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/65/269) \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/65/299) \r\n \r\n Mr. Kurlovich (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): The \r\nRepublic of Belarus has consistently stood for \r\nestablishing an atmosphere of respect and mutual \r\nunderstanding among peoples and States belonging to \r\ndifferent political and socio-economic systems, and \r\nwelcomes constructive dialogue among different \r\nreligions and cultures. \r\n Belarus is a staunch supporter of the idea of \r\nintensifying interreligious and intercultural dialogue \r\nfor peace on the principles of mutual respect, equality \r\nand tolerance. Clear testimony to this was the initiative \r\nput forward by the President of the Republic of Belarus \r\nat the 2005 World Summit on the need to recognize the \r\ndiversity of paths to progress as one of the values of \r\nhuman civilization. Respect for the uniqueness of \r\nStates and peoples and for their right to choose their \r\nown path underlies international dialogue and is an \r\nindispensable condition for the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. \r\n In accordance with the Belarusian Constitution, \r\nthe State is responsible for the preservation of the \r\ncountry’s historical, cultural and spiritual heritage and \r\nfor the promotion of free development of cultures of all \r\nnationalities living there. \r\n In Belarus, there are no conflicts based on ethnic, \r\nracial, cultural, linguistic or religious grounds. Twenty-\r\nfour ethnic and cultural communities are represented \r\nby 123 non-governmental organizations, 41 of which \r\nenjoy international status. Representatives of all ethnic \r\ncommunities are entitled to use their own native \r\nlanguage, and various educational institutions in which \r\nBelarusian is not the native tongue allow study in other \r\nlanguages, including Polish, Lithuanian and Hebrew. \r\n More than 25 religious denominations and over \r\n3,000 religious organizations consolidate effective \r\nskills of interreligious dialogue in Belarus. The \r\nInstitute of Religious Dialogue and Interreligious \r\nCommunication is working successfully within the \r\nSynod of the Belarusian Orthodox Church, its highest \r\nbody. \r\n An excellent example of constructive interaction \r\nand cooperation between national associations and \r\nState bodies is the Advisory Interethnic Council, under \r\nthe plenipotentiary on religions and nationalities. The \r\nCouncil is composed of the representatives of more \r\nthan 20 nationalities, representing the interests of \r\nethnic and cultural associations currently active in \r\nBelarus. \r\nA/65/PV.33  \r\n \r\n10-59074 2 \r\n \r\n Every year, Belarus celebrates the World Day for \r\nCultural Diversity for Dialogue and Development on \r\n21 May and the International Day for Tolerance on \r\n16 November. Biennial national festivals of ethnic \r\ncultures promote inter ethnic cooperation in Belarusian \r\nsociety on the basis of respect and equality. \r\n Belarus has become a venue for regular \r\ninternational meetings and productive dialogue among \r\nworld religious leaders. In November 2009, on the \r\ninitiative of the Belarusian Orthodox Church, Minsk \r\nhosted an international conference under the theme \r\n“Christian-Jewish dialogue: religious values as the \r\nfoundation for mutual respect in civil society amid the \r\nglobal economic crisis”. \r\n The conference made an important contribution \r\nto establishing closer cooperation between Christian \r\ntheologians of varying confessions and secular \r\nresearchers specializing in the area of dialogue \r\nbetween Christians and Jews and the history of \r\nJudaism. The conference was attended by \r\nrepresentatives of the Vatican, the United States, \r\nGermany, Italy, Israel, France, Sweden, Canada and \r\nother countries, with the participation of well-known \r\nscholars, priests from traditional Christian churches, \r\nand rabbis from Jewish communities. \r\n The promotion of mutual understanding and \r\ncooperation among various cultural and religious \r\norganizations is a key element of Belarusian foreign \r\npolicy. Within the United Nations, Belarus consistently \r\nundertakes practical steps to encourage and maintain \r\nthe global agenda for dialogue among civilizations. \r\nBelarus fully supports the efforts of the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations to strengthen dialogue between cultures \r\nand religions, and, in the framework of United Nations \r\nmechanisms, actively participates in the Tripartite \r\nForum on Interfaith Cooperation for Peace and the \r\nMinisterial Meeting on Interfaith Dialogue and \r\nCooperation for Peace. \r\n For Belarus, as a multi-ethnic State at a \r\ngeographical and historical crossroads of civilizations \r\nand with experience in establishing domestic and \r\nexternal conditions for inter ethnic and interreligious \r\nfriendship, participation in the activities of these \r\nforums is a fully legitimate and logical step. We \r\nbelieve that cultural diversity and the promotion of the \r\ncultural development of all peoples and nations are a \r\nsource for the mutual enrichment of the cultural life of \r\nhumankind. On that basis, Belarus was among the first \r\ncountries to accede to the UNESCO Convention on the \r\nProtection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural \r\nExpressions. \r\n Belarus traditionally supports General Assembly \r\nresolutions aimed at encouraging dialogue among \r\ncivilizations. Our country was a sponsor of resolution \r\n64/81 on the promotion of interreligious and \r\nintercultural dialogue, understanding and cooperation \r\nfor peace, and among the first countries to sponsor \r\nresolution 64/14, on the Alliance of Civilizations, \r\nadopted in November 2009. \r\n At the Ministerial Meeting on Interfaith Dialogue \r\nand Cooperation for Peace held in September 2009 in \r\nthe framework of the sixty-fourth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, Belarus initiated the idea of \r\nconvening thematic debates of the General Assembly \r\non interreligious and intercultural dialogue with the \r\nparticipation of religious leaders. The idea was \r\nsupported by the President of the General Assembly \r\nand was incorporated into resolution 64/81 on the \r\npromotion of interreligious and intercultural dialogue, \r\nunderstanding and cooperation for peace. We look \r\nforward to such thematic debates being held in the \r\nGeneral Assembly in the months to come. \r\n The General Assembly proclaimed 2010 to be the \r\nInternational Year for the Rapprochement of Cultures, \r\nwhich is also the culmination of the International \r\nDecade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for \r\nthe Children of the World. The Belarusian delegation \r\nbelieves that young people should play an eminent role \r\nin furthering successful dialogue among civilizations. \r\nAt the High-level Plenary Meeting of the General \r\nAssembly this year (see A/65/PV.5), Belarus proposed \r\nthe establishment of a global partnership to promote \r\nthe interests of youth, to be identified as “Help Future \r\nGenerations Prosper”, and the convening of General \r\nAssembly thematic debates on this issue. We believe \r\nthat outreach to the next generation on practices of \r\npeace and non-violence that are free from \r\ndiscrimination and bias would help young people to \r\nlive in a world of peace and harmony. \r\n Belarus, true to its principles and those of the \r\nUnited Nations, will further encourage international \r\nefforts to fully implement the Global Agenda for \r\nDialogue among Civilizations. \r\n Mr. Stone (Australia): Australia would like to \r\nthank the Secretary-General for his report on \r\nintercultural, interreligious and intercivilizational \r\n A/65/PV.33\r\n \r\n3 10-59074 \r\n \r\nunderstanding (A/65/269) and his note on the \r\nInternational Decade for a Culture of Peace and \r\nNon-Violence for the Children of the World \r\n(A/65/299), which we are considering here today. We \r\nstrongly support the Secretary-General in his efforts to \r\npromote interreligious and intercultural dialogue and \r\nunderstanding, particularly through the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations. We would like to thank the High \r\nRepresentative for the Alliance of Civilizations, \r\nMr. Jorge Sampaio, for his tireless efforts on behalf of \r\nthe Alliance of Civilizations. We would also like to \r\nrecognize Turkey and Spain for their work in co \r\nchairing the Group of Friends of the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations. \r\n Australia is encouraged by the work of the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations to promote dialogue that \r\ndelivers change on the ground. We need to confront the \r\nthreat of cultural and religious division with concrete \r\naction. The training of journalists undertaken by the \r\nAlliance is one excellent example of such concrete \r\naction. \r\n The Alliance of Civilizations complements the \r\nregional interfaith initiatives under way in our own \r\nAsia-Pacific region, such as the Regional Interfaith \r\nDialogue held in Perth, Australia, in October last year, \r\nas well as the Parliament of the World’s Religions held \r\nin Melbourne last December. Australia also provides \r\nextensive support to grass-roots interfaith activities in \r\ntwo of our nearest neighbours — Indonesia and the \r\nPhilippines — that focus on helping non-governmental \r\norganizations on the ground increase understanding \r\nbetween Muslim and Christian communities. For \r\nexample, since 2002 the Australia-Indonesia Institute’s \r\nMuslim exchange programme has fostered contact \r\nbetween emerging leaders of the Muslim communities \r\nin Australia and Indonesia. The programme now has a \r\ncommunity of more than 130 young leaders working to \r\nbuild links with other religious and ethnic groups. \r\n Australia is a highly multicultural society and \r\nhome to 200 nationalities and more than 100 religions. \r\nToday, one in four Australians was born overseas. On \r\ntop of that, almost as many have at least one parent \r\nwho was born overseas. Interfaith and intercultural \r\nrespect and cooperation have not always come easily. \r\nAustralia has had to learn hard lessons about how \r\nprejudice and distrust can be overcome. However, \r\ncreative and practical programmes that engage youth \r\nand harness education at the local level can help us \r\nimprove the dialogue between cultures and promote \r\npeace and understanding. Our role as Member States is \r\nto enable and encourage this dialogue, and the United \r\nNations can play an important role as well. \r\n Ms. Halabi (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): It gives me great pleasure to address the \r\nAssembly today on a very important topic that has \r\nbeen a central issue in major ideological and \r\nintellectual debates of recent years. I am referring to \r\nthe culture of peace and the centrality of dialogue, \r\nunderstanding, cooperation and mutual respect among \r\ncultures and religions, as well as to the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations for peace in its true meaning and not that \r\nof slogans for peace. \r\n It is well known that ideological dialogue is the \r\nbasis for understanding between international \r\ncommunities and furnishes the elements of an \r\nideological and human renaissance that humankind \r\nneeds in order to achieve peace, justice and respect for \r\nvalues, wisely pave the way to international \r\nunderstanding, and elevate the common values of \r\nhuman culture. \r\n At this stage in human history, our peoples are \r\nconfronted not only by cultural misconceptions \r\nbetween the East and the West, but also by \r\nmisunderstandings among civilizations affecting all \r\nparts of our world. It is a world suffering the absence \r\nof the values of freedom, justice and human rights and \r\noverwhelmed by the dangers of imbalance due to \r\ndesperation, numerous forms of aggression and the \r\nlaunching of illegitimate wars, discrimination, racism \r\nand the suffering of vulnerable States in the harsh \r\neconomic and financial crises impacting Africa, Asia \r\nand Latin America. \r\n All of this has left many peoples of the world \r\nwith problems and crises that are difficult to remedy. \r\nTherefore, the launching of awareness-raising \r\ndialogues among all civilizations, which forge and \r\nstrengthen relationships, is of the utmost urgency. They \r\nare lifesaving measures that promote human contact, \r\nreinvigorate human civilizational memory, and \r\ndiscourage attacks on civilizations that foment discord \r\namong different peoples and races. They also foster \r\ndiversity and interaction in the international march of \r\ncivilization, which can transcend the logic of a fake \r\nclash. \r\n We also find that the phenomenon of dialogue \r\namong civilizations is expanding and that institutions \r\nare being established for that purpose. We hope that \r\nA/65/PV.33  \r\n \r\n10-59074 4 \r\n \r\nthese institutions will ask questions that focus on \r\nrelations among civilizations. Is it really a relationship \r\nof dialogue, or is it one of integration, where each \r\ncivilization learns from its predecessors and then \r\ncomes up with a new form that is considered to be an \r\nimprovement, as happened when the Arab civilization \r\ncarried its wealth of knowledge through Andalusia to \r\nEurope? \r\n Since the civilization of today’s advanced \r\ncountries does not abandon this principle but rather \r\nbuilds on the achievements of previous civilizations, \r\nwe can speak of civilizational integration, or rather of a \r\ncivilizational alliance and an optimal dialogue that \r\ncannot be robbed of its content. This dialogue is aware \r\nof its roots and what the present owes to the past, and \r\nthose concepts that are new and renewed deserve our \r\nrespect because they seek to entrench the human \r\nconnection to knowledge, which is a deep and honest \r\nconviction opposing ignorance and wrongful bias. \r\n The establishment of bridges of understanding \r\nand cooperation among religions and cultures would \r\nbolster peace in the world, spread the culture of peace \r\namong societies, and diminish the gap of people’s \r\nignorance of each other. All of that would mitigate the \r\nprejudice and narrow–minded interpretations that \r\nideological extremism tries to promote throughout the \r\nworld, burdening them with political and ideological \r\nsabre-rattling. \r\n The enlightened of the world must promote \r\ninterreligious and intercultural dialogue and give \r\npriority to ideological understanding and respect for \r\nthe identity of the other, as well as the need not to \r\nconflate religion and terrorism. We must also be aware \r\nthat the absence of understanding and cooperation \r\nwithin the international community is partly the result \r\nof humans’ misunderstanding of religions and cultures \r\nand ignorance of our common denominators. It is not \r\ndue to structural shortcomings in these noble, moral \r\nconcepts. Human history demonstrates that extremely \r\nbeautiful forms of understanding and cooperation \r\namong cultures saw the light in ancient times, when \r\nmilitary and ideological clashes were the norm. \r\n In recent decades, the international community \r\nhas witnessed violent forms of conflict and a lack of \r\ndialogue and mutual knowledge, although some like to \r\nboast of new modes of thought, such as globalization \r\nand the information and communications technology \r\nrevolution. Our purpose is to make communication \r\namong civilizations a cultural norm that would \r\nintroduce us to the world community and represent a \r\npledge of honour to craft it into a message of amity, \r\npeace and justice and a call to all the nations of the \r\nworld. \r\n The race among civilizations must be a race for \r\nthe greatness of human thought and human genius, \r\nbecause those are ambitions that transcend aggression. \r\nIt must be a race for a world where there is no \r\nusurpation of rights, no occupation of the lands of \r\nothers, no discrimination based on race or colour, and \r\nno injustices that befall people who are displaced from \r\ntheir lands and whose holy shrines are desecrated, as \r\nIsrael has done to the Palestinian people and as the \r\nneo-Nazis are doing with our creeds, beliefs and the \r\nlives of our people. \r\n Since 2010 has been proclaimed the International \r\nYear for the Rapprochement of Cultures, we must \r\nconfront all these challenges in order to achieve a \r\nworld that is more unified and more just; a world that \r\nis multicultural, with multiple nationalities, and where \r\nan open, democratic dialogue prevails and peoples \r\nexercise their natural right to sovereignty and self-\r\ndetermination in a climate of liberty, equality and \r\nhuman dignity. \r\n Mr. Apakan (Turkey): It is a great honour for me \r\nto address this forum on intercultural, interreligious \r\nand intercivilizational dialogue to achieve a culture of \r\npeace. On this occasion, I would like to thank the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly, Mr. Joseph Deiss, \r\nfor convening this meeting. We are convinced that our \r\ndeliberations today will help to enhance collective \r\npeaceful coexistence and mutual understanding. I \r\nwould also like to take this opportunity to thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his report on the activities \r\ncarried out by the main United Nations entities \r\ninvolved in the field of dialogue among civilizations, \r\ncultures and religions (A/65/269). \r\n The reason behind the creation of this universal \r\nbody was to save succeeding generations from the \r\nscourge of war. Today, we cherish the same ideals in a \r\ndifferent world, where the driving forces of \r\nglobalization threaten our common aspiration to \r\npeaceful coexistence. We live in an interconnected and \r\ninterdependent world where global challenges have \r\nlocal impacts and local events impact the whole world. \r\n Regrettably, we have so far failed to overcome \r\npolarization, lack of understanding and discrimination \r\n A/65/PV.33\r\n \r\n5 10-59074 \r\n \r\nin the international community. Today, stereotypes \r\ncontinue to shape our perception of the other — the \r\nother who has a different way of life, cultural values or \r\nreligious beliefs; the other who indeed enriches our \r\nlife. Our history reminds us that cultural ignorance and \r\nreligious intolerance have been major obstacles to \r\npeace and development. It is therefore our \r\nresponsibility to uphold mutual respect among \r\nreligions and to promote a culture of tolerance and \r\nunderstanding among peoples. Indeed, a culture of \r\npeace can be enhanced only by the diversity of \r\ntraditions and their peaceful cohabitation. \r\n Today’s discussion demonstrates that the nations \r\nof the world recognize the importance of their \r\ncollective responsibility to promote a culture of peace. \r\nAs we approach the end of the International Decade for \r\na Culture of Peace and Non-violence for the Children \r\nof the World, we note with satisfaction that there is a \r\ngrowing interest in the promotion of cultural diversity. \r\nWe recognize the important role played by UNESCO \r\nand other United Nations entities in the promotion of \r\nthe Year. We believe that activities organized within \r\nthis framework clearly show that diversity enriches \r\nhumankind and is a source of creativity and innovation. \r\n Diversity and dialogue have always been the \r\ncentral pillars of the Turkish historical and cultural \r\nheritage. Indeed over the centuries, Turkey has \r\nhistorically, geographically and socially bridged many \r\ndifferent cultures and tried to create an environment of \r\npeace and mutual understanding. This was precisely \r\nthe reason why, together with Spain, Turkey sponsored \r\nthe Alliance of Civilizations initiative. The initiative, \r\nwhich was launched by the Prime Ministers of Turkey \r\nand Spain in 2005 under the auspices of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, enjoys the support of a growing number of \r\nMember States and international organizations. Such \r\nwide recognition and support make us all the more \r\nhopeful for our future. \r\n To promote an alliance of civilizations requires \r\nfirst and foremost a sense of creativity to attract the \r\nattention of various stakeholders. Since its inception, \r\nthe Alliance of Civilizations has provided a creative \r\napproach to engaging various stakeholders in dialogue \r\nand has become a sound platform to connect different \r\ncultures, to bridge the gaps of understanding and to \r\namplify voices of moderation. Today, it has become a \r\ntruly global peace initiative and serves as a global \r\nfacilitator to promote sustainable dialogue among \r\nvarious stakeholders, including young people, women, \r\nparliamentarians, the media, civil society and the \r\nprivate sector. On this occasion, I would like to express \r\nour thanks to the Secretary-General for his engagement \r\nin the activities of the Alliance. I would also like to \r\npraise High Representative Sampaio for his tireless \r\nefforts. \r\n This year in May, we completed a very successful \r\nForum in Rio de Janeiro. The Forum was an inclusive \r\nplatform that brought together the knowledge, \r\nexperience and energy of a wide range of partners. It \r\nconsolidated the global scope and universal outreach of \r\nthe Alliance. We will now turn our energy to the next \r\nForum, to be held in December 2011 in Qatar. \r\n Indeed, misperceptions and lack of understanding \r\ncontinue to be the realities of today. A recent report \r\nreleased by the Anna Lindh Foundation, entitled \r\n“EuroMed Intercultural Trends 2010: The Anna Lindh \r\nReport”, highlights that people living in Europe and the \r\nsouthern and eastern Mediterranean currently face a \r\nclash of ignorance. The survey’s main findings show \r\nthat one in every four persons from the two sides of the \r\nMediterranean had met people from other countries \r\nwithin the region, and yet there were still profound \r\ndisparities between what each group perceives as the \r\nother’s values. \r\n Against this alarming background, the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations, together with its partners, is working on \r\na regional strategy for the Mediterranean that aims to \r\nbring all relevant stakeholders closer together, enhance \r\nhuman development and foster good-neighbourly \r\nrelations among societies, institutions and individuals \r\nin the region. The strategy and its action plan for 2011 \r\n2015 will be adopted at the first Regional Conference \r\nfor the Mediterranean, which will be held on \r\n9 November in Malta. I would like to extend our \r\nsincere appreciation to the Government of Malta for \r\nhosting this important Conference. We only hope that \r\nthe regional strategy will help all sectors of society in \r\nthe Mediterranean region to interact and to promote the \r\nculture of peace together. \r\n Cultures are not self-contained; they evolve \r\nthrough constant dialogue and exchange. As long as we \r\nvalue cultural diversity as a common heritage of \r\nhumankind, we can attain the quest for social peace \r\nand harmony. For that reason, the key to a global \r\nculture of peace is dialogue. We must therefore \r\ncontinue our efforts to achieve a world whose richness \r\nlies at the centre of its own diversity. \r\nA/65/PV.33  \r\n \r\n10-59074 6 \r\n \r\n Mr. Yáñez-Barnuevo (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nIn 1998, the General Assembly proclaimed the decade \r\n2001 2010 the International Decade for a Culture of \r\nPeace and Non-violence for the Children of the World. \r\nThe Assembly’s declaration of 2010 as the \r\nInternational Year for the Rapprochement of Cultures, \r\nmade at the initiative of the General Conference of \r\nUNESCO, was to be the culmination of the Decade. \r\n As we approach the end of the Decade, we can \r\nmake a moderately positive assessment of the progress \r\nmade by the international community — including \r\nStates, international organizations and civil society — \r\nin promoting a culture of peace, despite all the \r\ndifficulties and challenges that have arisen in the world \r\nthroughout that period. \r\n The reports being considered by the General \r\nAssembly today account for this well. The report of the \r\nSecretary-General contained in document A/65/299 \r\nindicates that the International Decade has succeeded \r\nin disseminating the concept of a culture of peace at \r\nvarious levels and in various sectors of society and has \r\nencouraged the adoption of specific measures to that \r\nend. However, it also states that \r\n“[t]he debate about peace, culture, tolerance, \r\nmutual respect, reconciliation and equity in our \r\nsocieties must be reopened and the power of ideas \r\nset free so as to arrive at a peace paradigm in a \r\nglobalized world” (A/65/299, para. 1). \r\n A similar conclusion is reached in the 2010 World \r\nReport on the Culture of Peace, which was prepared by \r\nthe Foundation Culture of Peace based in Barcelona, \r\nwith contributions from over 1,000 civil society \r\norganizations and from 100 countries throughout the \r\nworld, and was conveyed to the Secretary-General in \r\naccordance with the provisions of resolution 64/80 and \r\ndistributed to Member States by the Permanent Mission \r\nof Bangladesh. \r\n The initiative of the Alliance of Civilizations, \r\nwhich has been led by the Secretary-General since \r\n2005 and was sponsored by Spain and Turkey, has \r\nattempted ever since its creation to respond to the \r\nchallenges posed by diversity and coexistence at the \r\nnational and international levels. To that end, the \r\nultimate aim of the Alliance is to promote \r\nunderstanding and cooperation among nations and \r\npeoples of different cultures and religions, and to \r\ncounteract the forces that fuel extremism and endanger \r\npeace. All of this is based on shared universal values \r\nthat inspire and guide the actions and spirit of the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations and are enshrined in the \r\nUnited Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration \r\nof Human Rights, among other basic instruments of \r\ninternational law. \r\n I am pleased to recall that, around this same time \r\nthis past year, the General Assembly adopted by \r\nconsensus resolution 64/14, sponsored by 94 States, on \r\nthe Alliance of Civilizations, demonstrating the broad \r\npolitical support enjoyed by the initiative. I note that \r\nthe large Group of Friends of the Alliance already \r\nnumbers 128 members, including States and \r\ninternational organizations alike. The designation of \r\nfocal points by the members of the Group has allowed \r\nthe Alliance to work dynamically and with a focus on \r\naction. The meeting of Alliance focal points, scheduled \r\nfor the end of October in Berlin, will be a good \r\nopportunity to assess what has been achieved to date \r\nand to set new goals for the near future. \r\n Document A/65/349 contains the report recently \r\nsubmitted to the Secretary-General by his High \r\nRepresentative for the Alliance of Civilizations, \r\nMr. Jorge Sampaio, and which the Secretary-General \r\nhas in turn transmitted to the General Assembly. The \r\nreport includes a summary of the main activities of the \r\nAlliance over the past year. As the Secretary-General \r\npoints out in his introductory letter to the report,  \r\n“In an increasingly interconnected world, often \r\ndivided by cross-cultural tensions, the Alliance \r\ncan play a significant role, as a bridge-builder \r\nand as a catalyst for … efforts aimed at furthering \r\ntrust and cooperation among diverse cultures” \r\n(A/65/349, p. 1). \r\n In that regard, developing the regional dimension \r\nof the Alliance of Civilizations is of great importance. \r\nThe adoption of regional strategies — beginning in \r\nSouth-East Europe last year at Sarajevo and to be \r\nfollowed in the Mediterranean by the conference to be \r\nheld in Malta in November — is crucial to translating \r\nthe Alliance’s global objectives into concrete efforts \r\ntailored to the circumstances and realities of each \r\nregion. The next step will be to craft those agreements \r\ninto real projects that will be determined by action \r\nplans and require sustained political and financial \r\nsupport. \r\n For its part, Spain continues to be fully \r\ncommitted to the principles and values of the Alliance \r\nof Civilizations and its special focus on action and \r\n A/65/PV.33\r\n \r\n7 10-59074 \r\n \r\nachieving results. In the course of Spain’s term of \r\noffice in the rotating chairmanship of the European \r\nUnion in the first half of this year, the Alliance held a \r\nround table on the theme “The Alliance of Civilizations \r\nand city diplomacy initiatives”, in the context of the \r\nEuropean Summit of Local Governments held in \r\nBarcelona in February 2010. \r\n I should also like to point out the high-level \r\nmeeting held in Cordoba in May on the theme \r\n“Religious freedom in democratic societies”, whose \r\nmain goal was to develop article 17 of the European \r\nUnion’s operational Treaty, which sets out that the \r\nUnion will maintain open, transparent and regular \r\ndialogue with churches and religious and other types of \r\ngroups and organizations. \r\n I am also pleased to inform the Assembly of the \r\nupcoming inauguration of the United Nations \r\nUniversity International Institute for the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations, which will be based in Barcelona and \r\nserve as a meeting place and an ideal laboratory for \r\nundertaking the necessary task of developing and \r\nseeking the most effective ways of achieving the \r\nAlliance’s goals. \r\n Lastly, I should like to refer to the report of the \r\nSecretary-General on intercultural, interreligious and \r\nintercivilizational dialogue (A/65/269). Among other \r\nthings, the report refers to ongoing activities in \r\nconnection with the 2010 International Year for the \r\nRapprochement of Cultures. The main goal is to \r\ndemonstrate that diversity enriches humankind and is a \r\nsource of creativity and innovation. In addition to some \r\nof the efforts carried out by the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations, the report covers the broad array of \r\nprojects and actions undertaken by UNESCO, \r\nespecially in the area of education, to promote dialogue \r\nand understanding among cultures, thereby \r\ndemonstrating its complementarity with the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations. The recent renewal of the memorandum \r\nof understanding between UNESCO and the Alliance \r\nof Civilizations on the occasion of the Alliance’s third \r\nForum, held in Rio de Janeiro, has made it possible to \r\nbroaden cooperation between the two bodies. \r\n The International Decade for a Culture of Peace \r\nand Non-violence for the Children of the World is \r\ncoming to an end. There is no doubt that the Decade, \r\nwhich began in 2001 with the signing of a manifesto by \r\n75 million people who committed themselves to \r\nworking to promote the culture of peace in their daily \r\nlives, has achieved significant progress in promoting \r\nthe culture of peace throughout the world, \r\nnotwithstanding obstacles and difficulties. \r\n However, reality shows that, despite the progress \r\nmade, there is still much to do and many obstacles to \r\novercome. The fact that the International Decade is \r\ncoming to an end should not lead us to relax our \r\ncommitment to promoting a genuine culture of peace \r\nthroughout the world. The Alliance of Civilizations has \r\nproven to be a particularly useful tool for generating \r\ndialogue and understanding and for meeting the \r\nchallenges of our times. The holding of the fourth \r\nForum of the Alliance of Civilizations in Doha, Qatar, \r\nin late 2011 will provide us with new prospects to \r\ncontinue to work intensively and in a committed \r\nmanner to promote a culture of peace that can \r\ngenuinely and effectively overcome various \r\nperceptions through joint efforts in favour of our \r\ncommon humanity. \r\n Mr. Valero Briceño (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): We would like to thank \r\nyou, Madam, for leading our work, and to wish you \r\ncontinued success. \r\n The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela welcomes \r\nthe many initiatives carried out worldwide to promote \r\ndialogue among civilizations. \r\n In recent days, the streets of New York have been \r\nthe scene of a fiery protest against the building of an \r\nIslamic cultural centre near the so called Ground Zero. \r\nAccording to national and international press agencies, \r\nopponents of the project shouted “No mosque under \r\nany circumstances”. Some carried banners with the \r\nword “sharia” written in red paint to symbolize traces \r\nof blood. \r\n In September, a preacher threatened to burn a \r\nHoly Koran at a public ceremony. In addition, an \r\nIslamic centre in California was besieged with signs \r\nthat read “Wake up America, the enemy is here” and \r\n“We do not want temples of the terrorist God near \r\nGround Zero”. In Nashville, Tennessee, a mosque \r\nunder construction was set on fire. \r\n Ten years after the unfortunate attacks of \r\n11 September, anti-Muslim sentiment is on the rise in \r\nthe United States and Europe. Racist and xenophobic \r\npolitical leaders of the Tea Party of the United States \r\naccuse Muslims of worshiping — and I quote the New \r\nYork Daily News — “the monkey god of the terrorists”. \r\nA/65/PV.33  \r\n \r\n10-59074 8 \r\n \r\n On Sunday, 10 October 2010, The New York \r\nTimes published a lengthy article in which it \r\nhighlighted that there is, in the United States, a strong \r\nnucleus of people and organizations, whose influence \r\nis expanding, promoting “a spreading fear of Islam and \r\na dehumanization of Muslims”. \r\n The renowned Canadian academic economist \r\nMichel Chossudovsky, in his article entitled “The \r\nDemonization of Muslims and the Battle for Oil”, said: \r\n “Demonization is applied to an enemy \r\nwhich possesses three quarters of the world’s oil \r\nreserves. ‘Axis of evil’, ‘rogue States’, ‘failed \r\nnations’, ‘Islamic terrorists’: demonization and \r\nvilification are the ideological pillars of \r\nAmerica’s ‘war on terror’. They serve as a casus \r\nbelli for waging the battle for oil. \r\n “The Battle for Oil requires the \r\ndemonization of those who possess the oil. The \r\nenemy is characterized as evil, with a view to \r\njustifying military action including the mass \r\nkilling of civilians.” \r\n One of the worst consequences of the events of \r\n11 September 2001 has been a noticeable increase in \r\nintolerance. Some, deplorably, associate terrorism with \r\nthat which is Arab, with that which is Muslim, with \r\nIslam. They are employing a false dichotomy: East \r\nversus West. Neoconservative political scientist \r\nSamuel Huntington predicted that, after the demise of \r\nthe cold war, “the clash of civilizations will dominate \r\nglobal politics”. \r\n We believe that those prejudices are divorced \r\nfrom reality. Neither in the East nor in the West is \r\npolitical or religious fundamentalism the hallmark of \r\ncivilization. Reductionism of this kind underestimates \r\nthe internal dynamics and plurality of each civilization. \r\n The Islamic world is rich in history and culture, \r\nas well as being geographically diverse. It is a \r\ncommunity of approximately 1.6 billion believers, of \r\nwhich 320 million are Arabs. This includes \r\napproximately 57 countries, of which 22 are Arab, one \r\nis Persian, 13 are part of sub-Saharan Africa, seven are \r\nAsian from the Indo Pacific region, three are European \r\nand seven are Islamic republics of the former Soviet \r\nUnion. This constellation of countries, in its political, \r\nsocial and cultural specificities, hosts a richness of \r\ndiversity and cultural plurality that give rise to freedom \r\nand sovereignty. \r\n Human beings are enriched by diversity and, \r\nwithin it, achieve social wholeness. Plurality is the \r\nexpression of a rich rainbow of options, and it \r\nenhances freedom and equality. The rich splendour of \r\nthe human species reaches fruition in constructive \r\nfellowship with trillions of other organisms, including \r\nthe ecosystem. \r\n Dreams are part of reality, as they inspire our \r\nstruggles for existence and for the preservation of \r\nhumanity. The dreams may not look the same, but their \r\npaths may cross along the way and they will then \r\nrecognize themselves in each other. \r\n While violence, racism and xenophobia represent \r\nthe absolute negation of dialogue, dialogue opens \r\navenues of understanding and is one of the conditions \r\nfor peaceful coexistence between nations and peoples. \r\nDialogue means tolerance and respect for others. But \r\nthis does not mean dialogue just for the sake of \r\ndialogue. Rather, it should be a journey, an opportunity \r\nto build a society based on justice, equity, equality, \r\nfreedom and solidarity. Dialogue, which does not \r\nexclude debate and differences, is essential to \r\nachieving peace and to ensuring human dignity. \r\n Inciting hatred and discrimination is a crime. The \r\nAmerican Convention on Human Rights states in \r\narticle 13 that: \r\n “Any propaganda for war and any advocacy \r\nof national, racial, or religious hatred that \r\nconstitute incitements to lawless violence or to \r\nany other similar action against any person or \r\ngroup of persons on any grounds including those \r\nof race, color, religion, language, or national \r\norigin shall be considered as offenses punishable \r\nby law.” \r\n For its part, the Durban Programme of Action of \r\nthe World Conference against Racism, Racial \r\nDiscrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, \r\nwhich was held in Durban, South Africa: \r\n “Calls upon States, in opposing all forms of \r\nracism, to recognize the need to counter anti-\r\nSemitism, anti-Arabism and Islamophobia world-\r\nwide, and urges all States to take effective \r\nmeasures to prevent the emergence of movements \r\nbased on racism and discriminatory ideas \r\nconcerning these communities” (A/CONF.189/12, \r\nProgramme of Action, para. 150). \r\n A/65/PV.33\r\n \r\n9 10-59074 \r\n \r\n I conclude with this question: what are we, at the \r\nUnited Nations, doing to prevent the continued \r\nincrease in those heinous forms of discrimination \r\nagainst human beings, cultures and civilizations? \r\n Mr. Borg (Malta): The two agenda items that the \r\nAssembly is considering in this plenary meeting, \r\nnamely, “Global Agenda for Dialogue among \r\nCivilizations” and “Culture of peace”, are mutually \r\ninclusive and complementary to each other. Let me \r\ntake this opportunity to thank and congratulate the \r\nHigh Representative for the Alliance of Civilizations, \r\nformer President Sampaio, for his outstanding \r\nleadership and tenacity in maintaining the Alliance \r\nmomentum, attracting new members and building \r\nconsensus among its constituency and in delivering on \r\nsome of its objectives. \r\n Malta believes that dialogue among cultures and \r\ncivilizations is essential for a better future — \r\nirrespective of our origins or beliefs — and is an \r\nimportant tool in strengthening dialogue and a means \r\nfor cooperation between and among countries of the \r\nGroup of Friends of the Alliance. \r\n In my statement, I would like to focus on how \r\nMalta is contributing towards the enhancement of the \r\ndialogue among civilizations in its own region, the \r\nMediterranean. \r\n It is recognized that the Mediterranean represents \r\na unique experience of similarities, common history \r\nand overlapping cultures, which contributes to the \r\nobjectives of the Alliance of Civilizations, namely, to \r\ncounter divisions, polarization and extremism within \r\nand among societies. \r\n With recurrent tensions threatening peace and \r\nsecurity in the Mediterranean region and beyond, it is \r\nimportant that all stakeholders continue to strengthen \r\nthe global scope of the Alliance, which, as rightly \r\npointed out by Secretary-General Ban Ki moon, is the \r\nleading United Nations forum dealing with \r\nintercultural dialogue and cooperation. \r\n The people-to-people approach must continue to \r\nguide our endeavours, especially those aimed at \r\nstrengthening on-the-ground efforts and cooperation \r\nwith a view to sowing the seeds of reconciliation and \r\nunderstanding. \r\n In three weeks’ time, from 8 to 9 November, \r\nMalta will be hosting the first Alliance of Civilizations \r\nregional conference for the Mediterranean. As an active \r\nmember of the Alliance of Civilizations Group of \r\nFriends, Malta intends to ensure that this conference’s \r\noutcome will provide another feather in the cap of the \r\nAlliance, especially through the enhancement of good \r\ngovernance, cultural diversity and intercultural \r\ndialogue among and between Mediterranean States. \r\n Indeed, this first regional conference for the \r\nMediterranean will see the adoption of the first \r\nregional strategy for the Mediterranean and an action \r\nplan, paving the way for innovative projects and \r\ninitiatives aimed at strengthening intercultural dialogue \r\nand cooperation. \r\n The primary aims of the strategy are to contribute \r\nto the general ongoing efforts to bring relevant \r\ncultural, economic, social and political stakeholders \r\ntogether from both sides of the Mediterranean, promote \r\nmutual understanding and improve perceptions of each \r\nother. It will also seek to defuse tensions and bridge \r\ndivides, enhance security and human development, and \r\nfoster good-neighbourly relations among societies, \r\ninstitutions and individuals in the Mediterranean \r\nregion. \r\n The first regional conference for the \r\nMediterranean will provide a platform for open and \r\nfrank exchanges between and among representatives of \r\nthe Mediterranean region with the hope that it will \r\nhopefully leave an indelible mark in the Alliance’s \r\nintercultural dialogue process. \r\n Malta’s commitment to intercultural dialogue in \r\nthe Mediterranean has been continuous. It has been a \r\nlong-standing vocation since Malta joined this family \r\nof nations. Indeed, Malta has not missed an \r\nopportunity to contribute further to this dialogue of \r\npartners. \r\n In that regard, Malta also plays an active role in \r\nthe Union for the Mediterranean. Firm in the belief that \r\ndialogue and cooperation contribute significantly to the \r\nstability and security of the Euro-Mediterranean \r\nregion, Malta has, since the inception of the Euro-\r\nMediterranean dialogue, held that the centrality of the \r\nobjectives of the Union remains crucial in any \r\nsuccessful achievement of this novel partnership. \r\n Malta is proud and honoured to have nominated a \r\nDeputy Secretary-General for the conference, and to \r\nhave been entrusted with the portfolio covering social \r\nand civil affairs, an area undoubtedly of vital interest \r\nA/65/PV.33  \r\n \r\n10-59074 10 \r\n \r\nto all partners in the Union and which will serve to \r\nfurther dialogue in the Mediterranean. \r\n Malta is also pleased to be the seat of the \r\nheadquarters of the Parliamentary Assembly of the \r\nMediterranean, which brings together the parliaments \r\nof all countries bordering the Mediterranean. The \r\nAssembly was established to bring together all the \r\nlittoral States of the Mediterranean on an equal footing \r\nin a unique forum of their own, to examine questions \r\nand take decisions on issues of direct interest to the \r\ncountries of the region. \r\n The primary mission of the Assembly is to bring \r\nthe people’s representatives of the Mediterranean \r\ntogether to promote cooperation, dialogue and mutual \r\nunderstanding. In that regard, it was a privilege for my \r\ndelegation to have been the sponsor, together with the \r\ndelegation of France, of resolution 64/124 of this \r\nGeneral Assembly, which was adopted in December \r\n2009, granting observer status to the Parliamentary \r\nAssembly of the Mediterranean to participate in the \r\nsessions and the work of the General Assembly. \r\n The fifth plenary session of the Parliamentary \r\nAssembly of the Mediterranean, to be held in 10 days’ \r\ntime from 28 to 30 October 2010 in Rabat, Morocco, \r\nwill be yet another occasion when parliamentarians \r\nfrom the Mediterranean littoral States will once again \r\nengage in sharing of initiatives, ideas, proposals and \r\nsolutions in the continuous search for an intercultural \r\nparliamentary diplomacy in order to establish durable \r\npeace and sustainable prosperity for all citizens of the \r\nMediterranean. \r\n Malta strongly believes that we, as United \r\nNations Member States and proud of our history and \r\nheritage, can and should strengthen our political will to \r\nconsolidate that which we have achieved so far and \r\nunite our efforts so as to engage collectively and \r\nconstructively in the promotion of a fruitful dialogue \r\nbetween and among partners from different regions. \r\n Malta’s vocation is to continue to strive to stem \r\nprejudices and overcome obstacles that hinder and \r\njeopardize the harmonious interaction between peoples \r\nof diverse sociocultural backgrounds and religious \r\nbeliefs. The bridge we are building should be based on \r\nsolid pillars of mutual understanding and respect. In \r\nachieving that goal, a concerted effort is required in a \r\nprocess that enjoys sufficient visibility to win both the \r\nminds and hearts of our peoples. \r\n Mr. Ali (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): At the outset, \r\nplease allow me to express my delegation’s \r\nappreciation for the inclusion of these two agenda \r\nitems in our programme of work this year. The topics \r\nof the Global Agenda for Dialogue among Civilization \r\nand the Culture of Peace are very important given the \r\nAssembly’s broad responsibility for promoting a \r\nculture of peace and consolidating the principles of \r\ndialogue and coexistence. \r\n The recent incidents of clashes and confrontation \r\naround the world make our discussion on dialogue \r\namong civilizations aimed at consolidating the values of \r\npeace and coexistence quite significant. In that regard, \r\nwe note many initiatives whose recommendations we \r\nhope will be implemented. We would also like to note, \r\nin particular, the initiatives of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement leaders at a meeting held in Manila, \r\nPhilippines, last March. \r\n That accomplishment was the result of persistent \r\nefforts by many countries, including Egypt, Indonesia, \r\nIran, Morocco, Pakistan, Qatar and Senegal and the \r\nSudan. In this context, I should like to recall the High-\r\nlevel Meeting of the General Assembly held in \r\nNovember 2008 in New York at the initiative of the \r\nCustodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Abdullah \r\nBin Abdulaziz Al Saud. That meeting was part of a \r\nprocess, started in Mecca and continued in Madrid, \r\nwhich aimed at translating the same noble goals we are \r\ndiscussing today into tangible reality. \r\n We would like to underscore the importance of \r\nefforts made in the past few years in various relevant \r\nforums. They have been an expression of our people’s \r\ndetermination to embrace dialogue among civilizations \r\nas a cornerstone of cooperation and coexistence. At the \r\nsame time, such efforts are an expression of our \r\npeople’s rejection of the notion of the clash of \r\ncivilizations and cultures, as advocated by certain \r\nmisguided voices. \r\n We in the Sudan believe that people were created \r\nas different races, tribes, ethnicities, colours and \r\nlanguages in order to cooperate, interact and exchange \r\nfor our greater good. We therefore strongly reject and \r\ncondemn practices that have recently emerged of \r\ndefiling religious symbols. We also reject supremacist \r\nclaims and recent forums for the desecration of \r\nreligious symbols, venerated persons and holy books \r\nunder the slogan of the freedom of expression. We \r\nrefuse to accept such a justification for such behaviour. \r\n A/65/PV.33\r\n \r\n11 10-59074 \r\n \r\n Globalization has offered the world great \r\nmechanisms and possibilities for communication, but \r\nthese can be used to negative ends if we, as countries, \r\ngovernmental organizations and civil society \r\norganizations, do not promote an international \r\nunderstanding that enhances mutual respect and \r\npromotes a culture of peace and dialogue, so that we \r\nare able to build bridges instead of walls. \r\n To that end, we call upon the international \r\ncommunity and those in favour of dialogue to support \r\nthe activities and efforts of the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations. We would like to note that the United \r\nNations High Representative for the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations has stated that the Alliance is being \r\nhindered by a shortfall in resources, which in turn \r\nimpedes the implementation of the goals set by the \r\nAssembly in many resolutions. \r\n The wise leadership of the patriotic sons of the \r\nSudan managed to bring to an end the longest civil war \r\nin Africa since the end of the colonial period, which \r\nour people inherited, one generation after another. That \r\nsuccess was crowned with the signing of the \r\nComprehensive Peace Agreement in 2005, which \r\nentrenches the principles of peace and dialogue among \r\nthe people of the Sudan. The coming months will see \r\nthe final chapter of the implementation of the \r\nAgreement with the exercise of the right of the people \r\nof Southern Sudan to self-determination. In that \r\ncontext, my Government is committed to allowing that \r\nprocess to happen in a democratic and transparent \r\nmanner, giving every citizen the right to express his or \r\nher opinion, freely and fairly. \r\n My country will also continue its efforts to \r\nnegotiate with the Darfur rebels in Doha under the \r\nauspices of His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa, \r\nthe Emir of Qatar. In that regard, we urge the \r\ninternational community to call upon the Darfur \r\nleaders who refuse to join the negotiation in Doha, to \r\ndo so and thus to work for peace. We also urge in \r\nparticular those countries that are hosting rebel leaders \r\nto insist on the urgent need for them to join the \r\nnegotiations. \r\n The topic of the culture of peace has become the \r\nsubject of media attention and has received the praise \r\nof writers and poets, becoming part of our school, \r\ncollege and educational curricula. We have established \r\ncentres to conduct research and studies on issues of \r\npeace and dialogue aimed at serving our people, our \r\nneighbours and the rest of the world. \r\n Achieving a culture of peace and dialogue among \r\ncivilizations cannot be separated from the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, which aim to promote dialogue \r\nbetween the North and the South and between the most \r\ndeveloped and the least developed countries. That \r\nwould undoubtedly help overcome national, regional \r\nand international conflicts, and would defeat the \r\npretexts of those who deny others on the grounds of \r\nrace, religion, culture and civilization. \r\n This drive in favour of peace and dialogue should \r\nbe supported by cooperative efforts among all leaders \r\nand youth gatherings in order to promote mutual \r\nunderstanding and a culture that our children would \r\nlearn from and believe in. \r\n We must be guided by the tolerance that is part of \r\nour faith to remain true to the message of worldwide \r\npeace, for which all religions, cultures and civilizations \r\nyearn, based on the values of peace, tolerance and \r\ncoexistence. In that context, my delegation welcomes \r\nthe conference to be held in Doha, Qatar, in late 2011. \r\n Mr. Nickels (United States of America): The \r\nUnited States is grateful for the opportunity to speak on \r\nthe important agenda items encompassed by the culture \r\nof peace. \r\n 2010 is the final year of the International Decade \r\nfor a Culture of Peace and Non-violence for the \r\nChildren of the World. We commend the work that \r\nUNESCO, UNICEF and other United Nations \r\norganizations have done throughout this Decade. \r\n The United States supports efforts around the \r\nworld aimed at creating forums where people with \r\ndiffering views can express themselves through \r\ndialogue. That is why we joined the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations and why we support initiatives like \r\nJordan’s draft resolution this year on a week of \r\ninterfaith harmony (A/65/L.5). \r\n The United States believes that peace can be \r\nachieved when peoples, religions and races come \r\ntogether to understand and accept one another, and to \r\nshun the violence and hatred borne of intolerance. \r\nFostering religious and cultural diversity and affirming \r\nmutual understanding are the cornerstones of a true and \r\nlasting peace. The United States affirms unequivocally \r\nthat freedom of expression and open intercultural and \r\nA/65/PV.33  \r\n \r\n10-59074 12 \r\n \r\ninterreligious dialogue are critical to combating \r\nintolerance and to promoting peaceful coexistence. \r\n Though the decade for a culture of peace is \r\ndrawing to a close, we look forward to the next decade \r\nwith its continued opportunities for dialogue. As \r\nPresident Obama said in his speech in Cairo in 2009: \r\n “All of us share this world for but a brief \r\nmoment in time. The question is whether we \r\nspend that time focused on what pushes us apart, \r\nor whether we commit ourselves to an effort — a \r\nsustained effort — to find common ground, to \r\nfocus on the future we seek for our children, and \r\nto respect the dignity of all human beings.” \r\n Mr. Dwivedi (India): I am deeply honoured and \r\nprivileged to participate in today’s joint debate on the \r\nagenda items “Global Agenda for Dialogue among \r\nCivilizations” and “Culture of peace”. \r\n As the International Decade for a Culture of \r\nPeace and Non-violence for the Children of the World \r\ncomes to an end, and we celebrate the International \r\nYear of Rapprochement of Cultures in 2010, we have \r\nthe opportunity to take a holistic view of the progress \r\nmade so far and to assess the challenges that lie ahead. \r\n Please allow me to express our sincere thanks and \r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for his \r\ncomprehensive report on intercultural, interreligious \r\nand intercivilizational dialogue (A/65/269) and to the \r\nDirector-General of UNESCO for its report entitled \r\n“International Decade for a Culture of Peace and \r\nNon-violence for the Children of the World, 2001-\r\n2010” (A/65/299). \r\n In today’s world we are witnessing the rise of \r\nextremism and intolerance, outbreaks of sectarian \r\nviolence and the increasing use of the language of \r\nhatred and violence. These pose a serious challenge to \r\nthe very foundations of our society. The increasing \r\ninterdependence and interconnectedness of our world \r\nhave also perhaps accentuated the fault lines in our \r\nsociety. While there is an accelerated pace in economic \r\nand technological development, the same, regrettably, \r\ncannot be said with regard to ethical, moral and \r\ncultural development in our society. Indeed, our times \r\nhave seen the rise of the scourge of terrorism. \r\n The environment in which we live today is also \r\naccentuated by disparities, deprivation and \r\nexploitation. That is hardly conducive to laying the \r\nfoundations for sustainable peace and development. \r\nConscious of that stark reality, our former Prime \r\nMinister Shrimati Indira Gandhi noted as early as \r\n1972, at the United Nations Conference on the Human \r\nEnvironment, that poverty and need were the worst \r\npolluters. That stirred a global debate on the need to \r\nensure that poverty eradication and developmental \r\nimperatives remained at the fore along with \r\nenvironmental challenges in our pursuit of sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\n Intercultural and interreligious dialogue is a \r\nnecessity and one of the central elements in developing \r\na better understanding of the apparent contradictions \r\nand divergent approaches that exist today in our \r\nsocieties. We need to create an environment conducive \r\nto fostering dialogue among diverse cultures, races, \r\nfaiths and religions and that inculcates the values that \r\npromote a transition from force to reason and from \r\nconflict and violence to dialogue and peace. \r\n Dialogue among different cultures and religions \r\nis also important because it is precisely in the absence \r\nof such dialogue and understanding that intolerance, \r\nbigotry and violence flourish. That is why extremist \r\nideologies, violence and terrorism have grown in a \r\nworld in which we seem to be moving away from \r\ndialogue and understanding. There can be no disputing \r\nthat terrorism, which is a manifestation of extremism, \r\nintolerance and violence, is the antithesis of all \r\nreligions. No religion condones violence or the killing \r\nof human beings. It is therefore imperative that the \r\nnations of the world work together in a concerted \r\nmanner to tackle the menace of terrorism and \r\nextremism, which are anathema to modern societies. \r\n All the great religions of the world essentially \r\nrepresent what the Indian ethos postulates, that is, “the \r\ntruth is one, the wise call it by many names”. \r\nCompassion, mercy and tolerance are the common \r\nvalues and beliefs among all major faiths of the world. \r\nWe must learn to live our faith with integrity while \r\nrespecting and accepting each other. \r\n India, the largest democracy in the world, a \r\nnation of unparalleled diversity with a population of \r\nover 1 billion, is the second most populous country in \r\nthe world. While India of course has the largest Hindu \r\npopulation, we also have one of the largest Muslim \r\npopulations in the world. India provides a home to a \r\nvery significant number of practitioners of practically \r\nevery other major religion of the world, be it \r\nChristianity, Buddhism, Sikhism, Jainism, \r\n A/65/PV.33\r\n \r\n13 10-59074 \r\n \r\nZoroastrianism or the Baja’s. India is the birthplace of \r\nJainism. Gateman Buddha gave his first sermon in \r\nSenath, an eminent centre of Indian philosophy, after \r\nhe attained enlightenment in Both Gaye. \r\n The history of India, in essence, is a narrative of \r\nconversations among different civilizations and, \r\nindeed, conversation with nature itself. India is home \r\nto scores of languages, hundreds of dialects, thousands \r\nof cuisines and a medley of races, colours, landscapes \r\nand cultures. This assimilation and accommodation of \r\ndiversity have contributed to the richness of our \r\ncomposite culture and the durability of our civilization. \r\nOur civilizational legacy treats nature as a source of \r\nnurturing and places high value on living in harmony \r\nwith nature. The Vedas are a repository for the holistic \r\ndevelopment of the human being in full harmony with \r\nits surroundings. \r\n The principle that the entire world is one family \r\nhas run like a thread through our constant interaction \r\nand exchange of thoughts with the outside world. The \r\nnoble principles of life and spiritualism, including \r\nnon-violence, have influenced successive generations \r\nof people worldwide. The interaction between India \r\nand the West goes back to the time of ancient Greece. \r\nMillenniums ago, the interaction between those two \r\ncivilizations produced the exquisite Andhra art form. \r\nIndia’s contact with Islam produced the beautiful \r\nconfluence of the Indo Islamic culture, which includes \r\nthe great human values of Sufism. Indeed, India would \r\nnot have succeeded in holding together and \r\nstrengthening a composite Indian identity unless \r\nIndians practised tolerance and were determined to live \r\ntogether in peace. \r\n The father of our nation, Mahatma Gandhi, was \r\nthe greatest apostle of peace and non-violence. We \r\nfirmly believe that Gandhi is not the past, he is the \r\nfuture also. He said, \r\n“I do not want my house to be walled in on all \r\nsides and my windows to be stuffed. I want the \r\ncultures of all the lands to be blown about my \r\nhouse as freely as possible”. \r\n We believe that no culture or religion is superior \r\nto any other, and have always benefited from our \r\ninteractions with various civilizations throughout our \r\nhistory. We in India understand the importance of \r\nbuilding alliances among religions, cultures and ethnic \r\ngroups. We have always supported all efforts to build \r\nbridges of understanding among nations, peoples, \r\nreligions and cultures across the world. It is our \r\nconsidered view that successful pluralism must be \r\ngrounded on the basic tenets of mutual understanding \r\nand respect for diverse traditions. Those are also \r\ncritical for the harmonious development of all sectors \r\nof society, including when it comes to gender equity \r\nand the empowerment of women all over the world. \r\n Global efforts towards peace and reconciliation \r\ncan only succeed with a collective approach that is \r\nbuilt on commitment, trust, dialogue and collaboration. \r\nWe must do this at all levels: within nations, within \r\nregions and within the broader international \r\ncommunity. The only way to achieve this goal is to \r\nmove conceptually to a new dimension of dialogue and \r\nharmony among diverse cultures, races, faiths and \r\nreligions so that all human beings can live in the sane \r\nand peaceful global society of our collective dreams. \r\n Mr. Jamaal (Tunisia) (spoke in French): The \r\nfuture of security, stability and development in the \r\nworld is contingent on reverence for the principles of \r\nmutual understanding and tolerance among peoples. \r\nEstablishing an international partnership for dialogue, \r\ncooperation, peace and development that promotes \r\ncommunication between all nations around the world \r\nregardless of colour, race, religion or language is \r\ncertainly crucial for achieving peace and security. \r\n We must recall that the darkest chapters of \r\nhumankind’s history and the worst atrocities committed \r\nagainst humanity essentially have as their source \r\ndoctrines of racial superiority and dogmas positing \r\ncivilizational or cultural superiority. Such notions have \r\nlost sight of the truth that a man remains a man, \r\nwhether he has white, black or yellow skin and whether \r\nhe is Muslim, Jewish or Christian. They have also lost \r\nsight of the fact that human civilization is a shared \r\noutcome drawing upon various sources and growing \r\nand prospering due to contributions from the East and \r\nthe West, the North and the South. Human culture itself \r\nhas multiple origins and colours and has developed and \r\ngrown thanks to the linguistic, literary, intellectual and \r\nartistic creations of peoples from all continents. \r\n The dialogue that Tunisia wishes to see and wants \r\nto enshrine in international relations can be successful \r\nonly to the extent that each of us, whether in the East \r\nor the West, works to initiate a culture of dialogue, \r\ntolerance and human rights — above all in our own \r\ncountries. We must do so through educational and \r\nteaching programmes as well as grass-roots activities \r\nA/65/PV.33  \r\n \r\n10-59074 14 \r\n \r\nand information and communications programmes, in \r\nparticular with youth and women, in order to anchor \r\nthis culture in human relations and make it an \r\nunwavering conviction in our thinking and in the \r\nbehaviour of all human societies. \r\n This is what Tunisia has undertaken to do, since \r\nthe start of the 1990s, by readjusting to that end its \r\neducational and teaching programmes. We have \r\nestablished a world solidarity award and a world prize \r\nfor Islamic studies advocating moderation, the golden \r\nmean and enlightened thinking. We have also hosted \r\nmany meetings and regional and international \r\nconferences focused on the dialogue of civilizations \r\nand international solidarity, which gave rise to a very \r\nworthwhile series of agreements and appeals to that \r\nend. \r\n We must also, in this context, work to combat the \r\nphenomena of poverty, illiteracy, disease, \r\nunemployment, isolation and marginalization, and do \r\nso with all of the determination and perseverance that \r\nwe are capable of in order to find remedies to these \r\nphenomena and to eradicate their root causes, taking \r\ninto account each country’s resources and situation. \r\n Based on the firm belief that these phenomena are \r\na major handicap today for developing countries that \r\nprevent them from developing their own potential so \r\nthat they can achieve progress and do away with their \r\nvulnerability, President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali made \r\nan appeal, in 1999, to create a World Solidarity Fund \r\naimed at eradicating disparities and strengthening \r\nsolidarity among peoples. That proposal was welcomed \r\nby the United Nations. \r\n Another Tunisian initiative that calls for \r\nestablishing bonds of friendship, cooperation and \r\nmutual esteem among peoples regardless of race, \r\nculture or faith is the Ben Ali Chair for Dialogue of \r\nCivilizations and Religions. Established in 2001, this \r\npost is aimed at increasing and spreading knowledge. \r\nIts key role is to encourage knowledge of other \r\ncivilizations and religions. It encourages and provides \r\nmaterial and moral support for actions that advocate \r\nrapprochement among peoples. \r\n Respect for the identity and uniqueness of \r\npeoples is the best framework for establishing a \r\nbalanced dialogue among equals between civilizations, \r\ncultures and religions. Cultural difference, because of \r\nthe variety of contributions made to it and its great \r\nbreadth, is indispensable for enriching human \r\ncivilization. However, difference should not be used to \r\njustify any type of rejection or exclusion. Instead, it \r\nshould offer broad horizons for diversity and \r\nenrichment. \r\n Tunisia reiterates from this rostrum its \r\ndetermination and its goodwill to cooperate with the \r\nentire international community to bring about a world \r\nof peace, security and prosperity. \r\n Mrs. Chaimongkol (Thailand): Less than three \r\nweeks ago, our leaders reaffirmed their commitment to \r\nthe achievement of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. Indeed, without respect and understanding for \r\neach other, sustainable peace and development cannot \r\nbe achieved. \r\n Thailand supports every effort that aims to \r\npromote greater understanding and expand dialogue \r\namong cultures, religions and civilizations. In this \r\nregard, Thailand takes note of the report of the \r\nSecretary-General (A/65/269), which highlights the \r\nactivities carried out within the framework of the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations and provides an overview of \r\nother major regional and global initiatives taken in this \r\narea. Thailand supports the recommendation of the \r\nreport that the work on dialogue among cultures, \r\nreligions and civilizations be streamlined in the future \r\nin order to make global efforts in this area more \r\ncoherent, visible and easily understandable for the \r\npublic and non-United Nations actors. \r\n I would like to share some of Thailand’s views. \r\n First, as my Foreign Minister said during the \r\ngeneral debate (see A/65/PV.23), we live in a world of \r\ndivides, be they politico-security, socio economic, \r\ndigital or even based on beliefs. To overcome them, we \r\nneed concerted efforts. The Alliance of Civilizations \r\ncan be a useful tool for bridging these divides. It \r\nshould also cooperate with related United Nations \r\nagencies, regional organizations and relevant interfaith \r\ndialogue frameworks, such as the Special Non-Aligned \r\nMovement Ministerial Meeting on Interfaith Dialogue \r\nand Cooperation for Peace and Development and the \r\nTripartite Forum on Interfaith Cooperation for Peace, \r\nin order to foster understanding and prevent \r\nconfrontation. \r\n Secondly, human rights are a top priority for the \r\nThai Government and its foreign policy. While \r\nfundamental human rights are universal, dialogue \r\namong cultures, religions and civilizations can help to \r\n A/65/PV.33\r\n \r\n15 10-59074 \r\n \r\npromote these values, bridge the gaps between \r\ndifferent interpretations and standards and enhance the \r\neffectiveness of their implementation across cultures \r\nand boundaries. Such forums as interfaith dialogues \r\nand the Alliance of Civilizations can make invaluable \r\ncontributions to fostering common understanding. \r\n Thirdly, at the regional level, Thailand has been \r\nactive in promoting closer interaction and greater \r\nunderstanding between peoples in South-East Asia by \r\nenhancing the connectivity of regional infrastructure. \r\nThrough various initiatives, such as the Master Plan on \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \r\nConnectivity, the Initiative for ASEAN Integration \r\nStrategic Framework, the East-West Economic \r\nCorridor, the Greater Mekong subregion projects, as \r\nwell as other bilateral initiatives, the free flow of \r\ngoods, services, and people brings with it a greater \r\nunderstanding of different cultures, religions and \r\nbeliefs. \r\n Thailand stands ready to work closely with the \r\nGeneral Assembly, United Nations bodies and all \r\nparties concerned to foster intercultural and \r\ninterreligious cooperation. \r\n Mr. Balé (Congo) (spoke in French): The \r\nfounding concept of the United Nations was the quest \r\nfor peace and the practice of tolerance, the prohibition \r\nof the use of weapons and the promotion of economic \r\nand social development for all peoples so that one of \r\nthe greatest tragedies humankind had ever seen would \r\nnever again recur. Most particularly, it was to protect \r\nfuture generations from the scourge of war. \r\n I would like here to acknowledge the timeliness \r\nand relevance of the subject under consideration today, \r\n10 years after the proclamation of the International \r\nYear for the Culture of Peace, and particularly this \r\nyear, 2010, which marks the end of the International \r\nDecade for a Culture of Peace and Non-violence for \r\nthe Children of the World. \r\n Recent history following the World Wars is so \r\nreplete with bloody events and upheavals — indeed, as \r\nmany today as in the past — that violence continues to \r\npermeate our world. Intolerance and scorn for each \r\nother’s cultures lays the groundwork for extremism. \r\nRacism, xenophobia and scorn for other cultures \r\ncontinue to feed off of racial and cultural prejudices. \r\nThe mix of various crises — the economic, financial, \r\nsocial and food crises — alongside the negative effects \r\nof climate change and poverty, only worsens this \r\nnegative trend, further exposing the weakest, most \r\nvulnerable and poorest. \r\n My delegation would like to take this opportunity \r\nto express from this rostrum the Congo’s support for all \r\ninitiatives aimed at promoting the culture of peace and \r\nencouraging dialogue among cultures and civilizations. \r\nDialogue among civilizations and its other facet, \r\ninterfaith dialogue, clearly draw from the aims and \r\nprinciples of the United Nations. That is why the \r\nCongo once again welcomes this new sign of the times \r\nand hopes that this dialogue among civilizations that \r\nwe hope for is indeed the path that will lead us towards \r\nthe peaceful, just and prosperous world to which we all \r\naspire. \r\n My country recently joined the Group of Friends \r\nof the Alliance of Civilizations, thus reflecting the \r\ncommitment of the Congolese Government to actively \r\ntake part, together with other members of the \r\ninternational community, in this quest for peace and \r\ntolerance through a dialogue among civilizations. \r\nToday’s debate offers a platform for all civilizations \r\nand cultures and all religions to undertake joint \r\ninitiatives and partnerships at the various levels in our \r\nStates, individually or collectively and within our \r\nrespective societies, so that the virtues of dialogue, \r\ntolerance and respect for cultural diversity serve the \r\ncause of peace and development. \r\n In this context, I would like to recall the virtues \r\nenshrined by the African tradition of discussion, which \r\nalso provides an opportunity for dialogue in the quest \r\nfor peaceful and consensus-based solutions to disputes \r\nthat arise in society. African discussions involve \r\nreconciling opposing views and forging an awareness \r\nof a shared destiny. \r\n Religions, in principle, advocate tolerance and \r\nlove for one’s neighbour. But throughout their history, \r\nand today once again, they have led and at times still \r\nlead to violence and intolerance when they are carried \r\nalong on the currents of extremism. We believe that \r\nnow is the time to encourage meetings between the \r\ndifferent faiths, in order to develop, in a \r\nnon-denominational spirit, a dialogue that is oriented \r\ntowards peace. Such opportunities should allow all of \r\nthem to explain in more depth the doctrine of their \r\nparticular religious community and more clearly \r\nillustrate its characteristics. This constructive dialogue \r\nshould bring about a growing mutual awareness of \r\neach faith along with a greater esteem of the teachings \r\nA/65/PV.33  \r\n \r\n10-59074 16 \r\n \r\nthat they convey. Religious communities would thereby \r\ncooperate more broadly in all undertakings that, \r\ndepending on the requirements of the various parties, \r\ncontribute to the achievement of the shared goals of \r\npeace and development. \r\n His Excellency Mr. Denis Sassou Nguesso, \r\nPresident of the Republic of the Congo, has made \r\npeace based on dialogue his political credo. It is \r\nthrough the virtues of dialogue and tolerance that the \r\nCongo has been able to overcome the obstacles that \r\nwere put in its path by an unprecedented civil war and \r\nhas been able to restore peace. In the wake of the \r\nfratricidal violence that plunged the country into \r\ngrieving and destroyed its social and economic fabric \r\nbetween 1997 and 1999, non-denominational services \r\nwere successfully held. Thus prayers and pleas uttered \r\nwith a single heart and in unison contributed, with \r\nother vital forces in the country, to overcoming the \r\ndivisions that could still plunge the country into further \r\nturmoil. The Government understood the beneficial \r\nimpact of this effort, as did religious communities. \r\nTherefore all religious faiths, separate from the State \r\nbut placed on the same footing, undertook this common \r\ncause of peace, which is a prerequisite for \r\ndevelopment. \r\n It is therefore obvious, in this respect, that we \r\nshould encourage a complementary dynamic between, \r\non the one hand, the State in its governing role as the \r\nguarantor of peace and security and, on the other hand, \r\nthe religious faiths involved in an interfaith dialogue \r\ndevoted to winning over hearts and minds, with the \r\nnoble aim of promoting a true culture of peace. \r\nConversion is, we know, one of the principles that \r\nunderpins religion. \r\n We are at a symbolic turning point at the end of \r\nthis first decade devoted to the culture of peace. Yet \r\npeace can only prosper and last if there is a fertile \r\nbreeding ground for justice and equality, along with \r\ntolerance and respect for diversity, progress and \r\nprosperity for all. In this regard, the dialogue of \r\ncultures and civilizations and interreligious dialogue \r\nare clearly avenues that can lead to more coordinated \r\nefforts to develop a true culture of peace. \r\n My delegation expresses its support for an \r\napproach that involves unified action, as proposed by \r\nthe Secretary-General in his report (A/65/269). Indeed, \r\nby establishing sustained momentum we can hope to \r\nmake true progress towards achieving this project of \r\nthe founding fathers of the Organization, that is, \r\nconstructing a world that is peace-loving, prosperous \r\nfor all, rich in diversity and that shares the same ideals. \r\n Mr. Barbalić (Bosnia and Herzegovina): Allow \r\nme to begin my statement by thanking the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his comprehensive report on intercultural, \r\ninterreligious and intercivilizational dialogue \r\n(A/65/269). We are also grateful for the annual \r\nprogress report of the Director-General of the United \r\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural \r\nOrganization (UNESCO) on the International Decade \r\nfor a Culture of Peace and Non-violence for the \r\nChildren of the World, 2001 to 2010. Dialogue among \r\npeoples, cultures, faiths and civilizations is essential \r\nfor the growth of the global culture of peace. \r\n We note with appreciation UNESCO’s leading \r\nrole in promoting the observance of the International \r\nYear for the Rapprochement of Cultures in 2010. As \r\nthe primary focus of the Year, the significant number of \r\nactivities — more than 700 — was impressive, and \r\nincluded a variety of projects presented in fields such \r\nas the arts, education and the interests of youth. They \r\nalso enjoyed broad participation by many segments of \r\nsociety, particularly young people. \r\n Bosnia and Herzegovina is also very pleased with \r\nthe fact that the Alliance of Civilizations, launched in \r\n2005 and welcomed by resolution 60/1, has shown \r\nsignificant results. In recent years, the Alliance has \r\nmanaged to maintain its momentum, attract new \r\nmembers, build consensus among its constituents and \r\ndeliver on some of its core objectives. Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina also commends the third annual report of \r\nMr. Jorge Sampaio, the United Nations High \r\nRepresentative for the Alliance of Civilizations. We \r\ngreatly appreciate his enormous efforts towards the \r\nrealization of the goals of the Alliance and his results-\r\noriented approach. \r\n Bosnia and Herzegovina wishes to confirm its \r\ncommitment to participate actively in the initiatives of \r\nthe Alliance of Civilizations as a member of its Group \r\nof Friends. We continue to support the principles and \r\nactivities of the Alliance in promoting a culture of \r\npeace and dialogue among civilizations, religions and \r\ncultures, as dialogue can significantly contribute to \r\nstrengthening mutual understanding and respect for \r\ncultural diversity. \r\n In our view, the promotion of true dialogue \r\namong civilizations is one of the most important \r\n A/65/PV.33\r\n \r\n17 10-59074 \r\n \r\npolitical instruments for strengthening peace and \r\nprosperity in the world. In this regard, Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina strongly supports the Alliance’s \r\nconstructive approach in dealing with the challenges of \r\nglobal relations today. \r\n I am proud to inform the General Assembly that \r\nthe Regional Strategy on Intercultural Dialogue and \r\nCooperation in South-East Europe — the first ever \r\nwithin the framework of the Alliance — was adopted \r\nlast December in Sarajevo, in a unique demonstration \r\nof the commitment to enhancing regional cooperation \r\namong the countries of South-East Europe. The high-\r\nlevel representatives of 14 countries of the region \r\ndemonstrated their commitment to further promoting \r\ngood-neighbourly relations, aimed at strengthening \r\nbridges between peoples and communities by \r\npromoting intercultural dialogue. \r\n The action plan for implementing the Strategy \r\nwas introduced in May this year. The same period has \r\nalso seen the preparation of a regional strategy for the \r\nMediterranean, producing a basic document for work \r\nwithin the Alliance of Civilizations on improving \r\nEuropean-Mediterranean dialogue in the region over \r\nthe next four years. Bosnia and Herzegovina fully \r\nsupports the coordinated activities set out in the \r\nStrategy for the Mediterranean and expresses its \r\nexpectation that the action plan for implementing the \r\nStrategy, whose aim is to develop regional partnerships \r\namong peoples and nations, will contribute to \r\nimproving cooperation and further strengthening \r\nstability and development in the region. We therefore \r\nlook forward to the ministerial conference in \r\nNovember, when we expect the new Strategy to be \r\nadopted. \r\n Bringing about advanced intercultural and \r\ninterreligious dialogue aimed at promoting tolerance \r\nand peace is of the highest importance for my country. \r\nWe recognize that the protection of cultural heritage \r\nand the free exercise of religion while respecting \r\ntraditions are among the basic fundamental rights \r\nnecessary to achieving a comprehensive peace. We in \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina have also come to the \r\nrealization that dialogue must be conducted on a \r\nplatform of democracy, the rule of law, respect for \r\nhuman rights and the dignity of the individual. We are \r\nfully aware that without open dialogue there can be no \r\ntrue reconciliation. In this regard, Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina welcomes and supports all resolutions \r\nthat promote intercultural, interreligious and \r\nintercivilizational dialogue. \r\n I would like to express our satisfaction with the \r\nprogress that the Alliance of Civilizations has made in \r\nrecent years with projects such as the International \r\nYear of Youth on the theme of dialogue and mutual \r\nunderstanding. This initiative will contribute to the \r\npromotion of the ideals of peace and solidarity across \r\ngenerations, cultures, religions and civilizations. \r\n Furthermore, it is of the utmost importance that \r\nwe make concerted joint efforts to promote better \r\nmedia visibility for the Alliance and help it achieve its \r\nobjectives. Implementing a more effective \r\ncommunications strategy is one of the priorities that \r\nneeds further development. We welcome the outcome \r\nof the third Forum of the Alliance of Civilizations, held \r\nin Rio de Janeiro, which confirmed the Alliance’s \r\nglobal scope as the leading United Nations forum \r\ndealing with intercultural dialogue and cooperation. \r\nThere is no doubt that the fourth Forum, which will be \r\nhosted by the Government of Qatar in 2011, will \r\ncontinue with effective ways of strengthening \r\ncooperation and intercultural dialogue. \r\n Mr. Bame (Ethiopia): I would like to thank the \r\nPresident for convening this joint debate on the Global \r\nAgenda for Dialogue among Civilizations and the \r\nculture of peace. I would also like to express my \r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for his report \r\n(A/65/269) on the agenda items under consideration. \r\nMy delegation believes that the report enables us to be \r\ncognizant of the activities of the United Nations and its \r\naffiliated entities with regard to dialogue among \r\ncivilizations, cultures and religions. \r\n My delegation fully associates itself with the \r\nstatement of the Non-Aligned Movement. \r\n We should recall that the Millennium Declaration, \r\nadopted in September 2000 (resolution 55/2), clearly \r\nindicated that tolerance was one of the fundamental \r\nvalues essential to international relations in the twenty-\r\nfirst century, including the active promotion of a \r\nculture of peace and dialogue among civilizations. The \r\nDeclaration highlighted that globalization increased \r\npeople’s interconnectedness and hence brought about \r\ngreater interaction between cultures and civilizations. \r\n In that regard, the celebration in 1999 of the \r\nUnited Nations Year of Dialogue among Civilizations \r\nunderscored that globalization was not only an \r\nA/65/PV.33  \r\n \r\n10-59074 18 \r\n \r\neconomic, financial and technological process that \r\ncould offer great benefits; it also presented us with the \r\nchallenge of preserving and celebrating the rich \r\ncultural diversity of humankind and indigenous \r\ncivilizations. \r\n The challenges that we face today, be they \r\npolitical or otherwise, would be easier to address if \r\ndialogue among civilizations were promoted as an \r\napproach to tackling the fault lines in relationships \r\namong nations. We need to keep in mind that efforts \r\ntowards peace and prosperity at the international level \r\ncould be successful if the peoples of the world nurtured \r\ndialogue along cultural lines. This path of \r\ncommunication, we believe, can bring about \r\nunderstanding and respect between and among peoples \r\nof different traditions. \r\n For us in Ethiopia, the coexistence of different \r\npeoples and long-standing tolerance among cultures \r\nand denominations is a unique heritage and way of life. \r\nIn fact, we consider it a matter of survival, and the glue \r\nthat holds our social fabric together in times of ordeal \r\nor foreign aggression. It is our belief that this \r\nexperience of harmonious relationships among the \r\npeople of Ethiopia could be exemplary for other \r\nnations and help all peoples live in peace. \r\n The Ethiopian Federal Constitution is firmly \r\nanchored on the principle, among others, of \r\nrecognizing and safeguarding individual identities and \r\nrights, as well as of ensuring the full representation and \r\nparticipation of all nations and nationalities in the \r\npolitical and socio economic activities of the country. \r\nAll of that is observed without compromising our \r\ncommitment to the goal of promoting unity in \r\ndiversity. \r\n Ethiopia is taking practical steps to advance the \r\ndialogue agenda. A high-level conference on the role of \r\nreligion in peacebuilding and development, held from \r\n16 to 17 June 2008 in Addis Ababa, was conducted in \r\nthe presence of the President of the Federal Democratic \r\nRepublic of Ethiopia, religious leaders, Government \r\nofficials, scholars and representatives of civil society \r\norganizations. \r\n It is also worth mentioning that the Government \r\nof Ethiopia, in collaboration with the Spanish \r\nGovernment and the European Union, plans to organize \r\na seminar on interreligious dialogue in November \r\n2010. The seminar will bring together federal and \r\nregional Government officials, representatives of \r\nreligious institutions, elders, members of academia and \r\ncivil society organizations. The seminar is expected to \r\npublicize and promote the initiative of the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations in political circles, civil society and \r\nEthiopian academic circles. \r\n We are well aware that durable peace and \r\nprosperity can only be secured through a continuous \r\nprocess of dialogue among different views and \r\ninterests. Ethiopia is firmly committed to advancing \r\nthe objectives of the Alliance of Civilizations, which \r\nwere launched in 2005 at the initiative of the \r\nGovernments of Spain and Turkey and under the \r\nauspices of the United Nations. I am pleased to \r\nannounce that Ethiopia, as a member of the Alliance, is \r\ncurrently elaborating its national plan of action for the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to reassure the \r\nAssembly that Ethiopia will always remain firmly \r\ncommitted and will continue to actively play its role in \r\nthe pursuit of this paramount global agenda of dialogue \r\namong civilizations. \r\n Mr. Solón (Plurinational State of Bolivia) (spoke \r\nin Spanish): On behalf of the Plurinational State of \r\nBolivia, I would like very much to welcome this debate \r\non cultures, religions and civilizations. \r\n Bolivia is a country that promotes the culture of \r\npeace. We have enshrined that conviction in article 10 \r\nof our new political Constitution, which rejects all \r\nforms of aggression and war to resolve any type of \r\nconflict. \r\n Bolivia is a country that promotes the meeting of \r\ncivilizations and cultures. It is for that reason that the \r\nState’s new political Constitution has changed our \r\ncountry’s name to the Plurinational State of Bolivia, for \r\nwe recognize that there are 36 nations on Bolivian \r\nterritory. They have the same rights and deserve the \r\nsame recognition. They are all equal in the eyes of the \r\nState. \r\n In our view, nations of the world are increasingly \r\nmoving towards plurinational States. In other words, \r\nthere are more nations that contain groups of \r\ncivilizations and peoples with different cultures and \r\ndifferent religions. Increasingly, we are plurinational \r\nwithin our own countries. \r\n Bolivia is a country that vigorously fights \r\ndiscrimination and racism. We do so because the vast \r\nmajority of our indigenous population has for centuries \r\n A/65/PV.33\r\n \r\n19 10-59074 \r\n \r\nsuffered discrimination and racism at first hand. It is \r\nfor that reason that we adopted a law against \r\ndiscrimination and racism this year. The legislation \r\nestablishes a set of measures, institutions and penalties \r\nto ensure that all types of racial and other \r\ndiscrimination are gradually overcome and eradicated \r\nin our country. \r\n It is worth mentioning that this law against \r\nracism is also meant to ensure that the media, as set out \r\nin the report under review (A/65/269), must provide \r\nobjective information, avoid the use of stereotypes and \r\ncounter any incitement to hatred and violence. For us, \r\nit is essential that, in the fight against discrimination \r\nand racism, the media play a crucial role in promoting \r\na culture of peace and in rejecting hatred and any \r\nactions prejudicial to the minority persons and cultures \r\nthat exist in many of our countries. \r\n We note with grave concern the growing new \r\nwave of discrimination and xenophobia, especially in \r\ndeveloped countries of the North. It must be said that \r\namong the structural causes of the phenomenon of \r\ndiscrimination we are witnessing are the current \r\nworsening social and economic conditions, which are \r\ndeepening with time. It is essential that we recognize \r\nthis fact and take concrete steps to counter it. We \r\npropose that this dialogue on cultures, civilizations and \r\nreligions take on the economic dimension as well so \r\nthat we can soon evaluate the impact of the economic \r\ncrisis on our societies and on this dialogue among \r\ncivilizations and cultures. We also believe that it is \r\nurgent to begin a discussion on an actual programme of \r\nwork to set out measures to counter the wave of \r\nracism, xenophobia and discrimination that has been \r\nbrought about by the world economic crisis. \r\n For the Plurinational State of Bolivia, a world at \r\npeace is a world without discrimination or racism. \r\n Mr. Onemola (Nigeria): Nigeria expresses its \r\nappreciation to the President of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-fifth session, especially for this joint debate \r\non agenda items 14 and 15, on the Global Agenda for \r\nDialogue among Civilizations and on the Culture of \r\npeace, respectively. We also thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the reports contained in documents \r\nA/65/269 and A/65/299. \r\n The relevant report covers omnibus issues and \r\nreviews the activities of the major United Nations \r\nbodies concerned with the subject under review, \r\npursuant to resolutions 60/4 and 64/81. We note in \r\nparticular that the report provides detailed information \r\non the third Forum of the United Nations Alliance of \r\nCivilizations and on the progress made to date with \r\nregard to the promotion of United Nations objectives \r\nthrough outreach programmes, collaboration with faith-\r\nbased organizations and the building of strategic \r\nawareness schemes through communication, including \r\nimproving educational activities on the issue. \r\n The special event organized by the Department of \r\nEconomic and Social Affairs on 21 April 2010 at \r\nUnited Nations Headquarters to celebrate the \r\nInternational Year on the Rapprochement of Cultures \r\npursuant to resolution 64/81 — during which the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth \r\nsession and the Secretary-General renewed their \r\ncommitment — was significant owing to the fact that \r\nseveral useful proposals were made to advance action \r\non how to further enrich our objectives in this era of \r\nglobalization. \r\n We are pleased to note that UNESCO, the lead \r\nfocal point on the International Year, successfully \r\nlaunched an event on 18 February 2010 during which a \r\nhigh-level panel on peace and dialogue among cultures \r\nwas held with the participation of representatives from \r\nall regions of the world. Participants from a broad \r\nsection of society presented their contributions, with \r\nperspectives ranging from the political and intellectual \r\nto the religious viewpoints. The high purpose of the \r\nactivities of the International Year for the \r\nRapprochement of Cultures is to raise awareness, \r\nculminating in the production and dissemination of \r\ninformation and the organization of several \r\ninternational and regional conferences covering a \r\nvariety of projects in virtually all areas where various \r\nforms of dialogue and rapprochement could take place, \r\nsuch as in the arts, education, culture and youth issues. \r\nAt this juncture, we would like to emphasize the role of \r\nregional organizations in this endeavour, as they \r\nrepresent important tools that can be used positively to \r\nfurther our objectives. \r\n From our perspective, we would like to reaffirm \r\nthat the strategy for building a culture of peace must, \r\nhowever, be based on sound and established principles \r\nthat can build trust and understanding among the \r\ndiverse peoples of the world and enable them to \r\nnavigate from their differences towards productive \r\nends and advantages. This will involve multifaceted \r\nand broad efforts, including gaining an understanding \r\nof each other’s ways of life; the establishment of \r\nA/65/PV.33  \r\n \r\n10-59074 20 \r\n \r\nmeans of resolving ongoing conflicts, so as to prevent \r\nthem from further degenerating; the development of \r\ninstitutional frameworks and relevant capacities for \r\npeace initiatives; and the mobilization of resources at \r\nthe national and regional levels for peace initiatives. \r\n Promoting peace and understanding through \r\nmutual dialogue, tolerance and respect for each other \r\nrequires a collective effort. It is therefore appropriate \r\nfor all of us to join hands in this endeavour in order to \r\nmove our world towards a more peaceful and \r\nprosperous one. We should also unite to de emphasize \r\nagents of strife and conflict among us and pay greater \r\nattention to those issues that create a harmonious \r\natmosphere, in an attempt to guarantee the full and \r\nfundamental human rights of all the peoples of the \r\nworld. \r\n In conclusion, we believe that the central \r\nteachings of all religions emphasize dialogue and \r\nunderstanding. The international community will suffer \r\nfrom intolerance, bigotry and violence in the absence \r\nof those virtues and encourage the growth of extremist \r\nideologies, violence and terrorism. Nigeria abhors the \r\nintolerance that exists throughout the world and the \r\nfact that those intolerant groups have access to greater \r\nand greater resources. We must all rise to counter those \r\ndeviant tendencies that promote destructive activities \r\nwith serious implications for social stability, peace and \r\ndevelopment. We must collectively send a clear \r\nmessage to Member States concerning their \r\nresponsibility to promote religious harmony and \r\ntolerance and the equality of cultural traditions, \r\nreligions, creeds and faiths. Nigeria looks forward to \r\nthe time when the peoples of the world will have a \r\nbetter understanding of the diversity in the world. \r\nFinally, we must shift our thinking from our primordial \r\nways and reset it in accordance with the march of \r\nglobalization and its attendant implications. \r\n Nigeria remains committed to all efforts geared \r\ntowards the development of a culture of peace. \r\n Mr. Al-Nasser (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, let me express to the President the gratitude of \r\nmy country’s delegation for convening this important \r\nmeeting of the General Assembly to discuss the items \r\non the global agenda for dialogue among civilizations \r\nand the culture of peace. \r\n Although all religions and cultures have common \r\ndenominators in terms of human values, the \r\nphenomena of fanaticism and religious and ethnic-\r\nbased conflicts continue to worsen and pose a growing \r\nthreat to healthy relations between countries. \r\n The State of Qatar is of the firm belief that more \r\nimportance should be given to the principles of \r\ndialogue among religions in order to find a solid \r\nplatform for building a world that is peace-loving and \r\nunderstanding. That firm belief has encouraged the \r\nEmir of Qatar to host the fourth Forum of the Alliance \r\nof Civilizations in Doha, which seeks to establish a \r\nconstructive dialogue among followers of varying \r\nfaiths and religions in order to achieve better \r\nunderstanding of the principles and teachings of those \r\nreligions and put them at the service of all of \r\nhumankind. The State of Qatar has also hosted a \r\nnumber of international conferences on dialogue \r\namong religions. Those opportunities have become \r\nannual events aimed at deepening dialogue and \r\ncommunication. The series began with the First Doha \r\nConference on Interfaith Dialogue held in Doha in \r\nApril 2003, with the Eighth Conference to be held also \r\nin Doha from 19 to 21 October 2010 on the role of \r\nreligion in the education of new generations. \r\n The State of Qatar believes that dialogue among \r\nreligions can have a positive impact on the dialogue \r\namong peoples and civilizations. From that standpoint, \r\nsince the inception of the Alliance of Civilizations in \r\n2005, our country has contributed by responding to the \r\ninitiative of the former United Nations Secretary-\r\nGeneral Mr. Kofi Annan, with the significant \r\nparticipation of Her Excellency Mozah bint Nasser \r\nAl Missned, the spouse of the Emir of Qatar, who \r\nparticipated in the High-level Group for the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations put together by Mr. Kofi Annan in 2005. \r\nThat panel brought together eminent persons and major \r\nworld leaders in order to forge important initiatives \r\nwithin the framework of the Alliance of Civilizations \r\non education and training for young people with a view \r\nto achieving the final goal of rapprochement among \r\npeoples and cultures. \r\n The State of Qatar supports the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations and has actively taken part at a very high \r\nlevel in all of the meetings of the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations that were held in Madrid, Istanbul and \r\nRio de Janeiro to support the work programme of the \r\nAlliance and to give it the necessary momentum. That \r\nparticipation led to the presence of Sheikha Mozah bint \r\nNasser Al Missned, the consort of Sheikh Hamad bin \r\nKhalifa Al Thani, the Emir of Qatar. In order to \r\nconsolidate their support, Sheikha Mozah launched a \r\n A/65/PV.33\r\n \r\n21 10-59074 \r\n \r\n$100 million initiative to provide jobs for young \r\npeople. Since its inception, this initiative has \r\nestablished connections with the private sector, which \r\ncreated a trade incentive for world institutions to \r\naddress unemployment issues among youth. It has also \r\ndeveloped a series of projects aimed at dealing with the \r\nunemployment problem among young people, \r\nspecifically in three areas: policies, science and job \r\nopportunities. These initiatives will create work, \r\nbusinesses and ways for young people to obtain capital. \r\nFurthermore, the State, together with the Islamic \r\nConference Youth Forum, adopted a project to \r\nestablish a youth entrepreneurs’ network in Islamic \r\ncountries last April. The State of Qatar has also \r\ncontributed, with the Secretary to the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations, to the establishment of a programme of \r\nscholarships for young people in the city of Doha in \r\nMarch 2010, as an experimental programme with a \r\nnumber of regional organizations. The State of Qatar \r\nwill host the fourth Forum of the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations in December 2011 and will cooperate to \r\nthat end with the secretariat of the Alliance and \r\nmember States, so that the fourth Forum will represent \r\na new departure for the Alliance of Civilizations, \r\nprovide new momentum for its noble goals and \r\ninitiatives, and promote the aims of the Alliance in \r\nbridging the gap between peoples and cultures. \r\n Mr. Ashour (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in \r\nArabic): In our meeting today we are dealing with two \r\nimportant items on the international agenda that are \r\nespecially important because of their strong \r\nconnections to international peace and coexistence \r\namong peoples in a multicultural and multireligious \r\nworld and an international political environment that is \r\nsometimes inharmonious and subject to conflicts. \r\nThose conflicts are fed by racist and extremist policies \r\nand tendencies that undermine the deployment of \r\ninternational efforts towards rapprochement, \r\ncommunication and coexistence among the peoples of \r\nthe world and that in the long run threaten international \r\npeace and security. \r\n Despite the bleak picture presented by the racist \r\nand aggressive policies and actions that our world is \r\nwitnessing in certain areas and the analogous reactions \r\nfrom militant and extremist movements in various parts \r\nof the world, the genuine political will of the majority \r\nof leaders and peoples of the world could create an \r\nenvironment conducive to eradicating racism and \r\nextremism among people. The United Nations has a \r\nspecial and major responsibility to translate that \r\ninternational will into concrete realities on the ground. \r\n We are all aware of the important role that the \r\nUnited Nations system plays, under the direction of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and with the participation of \r\nUNESCO, UNICEF, the United Nations Population \r\nFund and other United Nations agencies and organs, to \r\nspread the culture of peace and non-violence and to \r\nencourage dialogue, rapprochement and alliances \r\nbetween civilizations, cultures and religions. Yet, we \r\nbelieve that the humble efforts that have been and are \r\nstill being deployed by the international Organization \r\nand the mechanisms that have been adopted, though \r\nimportant, are inefficient and insufficient and cannot \r\nbe relied on alone to realize our desired objectives. We \r\nfully realize that a reading of the history of human \r\nexperience shows that policies of discrimination and \r\nracism, foreign occupation, poverty and hunger are \r\namong the major factors that give birth to and feed \r\nextremism, violence and intolerance. \r\n My delegation has read attentively the report of \r\nthe Secretary-General on intercultural, interreligious \r\nand intercivilizational dialogue (A/65/269), and the \r\nreport submitted by the Director-General of the United \r\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural \r\nOrganization regarding the International Decade for a \r\nCulture of Peace and Non-violence for the Children of \r\nthe World, 2001-2010, contained in document \r\nA/65/299. The Libyan delegation appreciates the effort \r\ninvolved in the preparation of the two reports, their \r\ncontents and the valuable information they contain, \r\nfocusing on the important aspects of the issue that has \r\nbeen in the forefront of the world’s attention in recent \r\nyears, specifically since the tragic events of \r\n11 September 2001, which have been condemned by \r\nthe entire world and which have also been exploited by \r\nextremists and racists to distort the image of Islam, \r\ninciting antagonism against Islam and Muslims. \r\n As is stipulated in General Assembly resolution \r\n64/81 on the promotion of interreligious and \r\nintercultural dialogue and rights, understanding and \r\ncooperation for peace, the exercise of the freedom of \r\nexpression involves responsibilities and duties, which \r\ncall for restraint in the exercise of that right. In that \r\nrespect, we have all seen and heard in the media \r\nunjustified attacks on and deliberate distortions of one \r\nof the greatest monotheistic religions of the world and \r\nof its symbols, under the pretext of the right to exercise \r\nthe freedom of expression. In that regard, we cannot \r\nA/65/PV.33  \r\n \r\n10-59074 22 \r\n \r\nbut warn of the dangerous consequences of insults \r\nagainst Islam, attacks on Islamic symbols, attempts to \r\ndistort Islamic values and principles, and \r\ndiscrimination against Muslims in various countries. \r\n The culture of peace could effectively enhance \r\nrespect for human rights and strengthen solidarity \r\namong peoples and nations and support dialogue \r\namong cultures and civilizations that share many \r\ncommon universal values. Dialogue among \r\ncivilizations contributes to the realization of peace, \r\nunderstanding and friendship among peoples and \r\nnations, while cultural bias, incitement and hatred \r\nagainst other cultures and religions increase hatred and \r\nviolence among peoples and nations all over the world. \r\nConsequently, it is incumbent on us all to consecrate \r\nthe culture of peace and spread it among peoples. \r\nHowever, that should not in any respect be interpreted \r\nto mean that we can force people who are suffering \r\nracist foreign occupation to accept the status quo, \r\nrenounce their legitimate rights and give up their \r\nresistance to occupation in all its forms. If we did that, \r\nthen we would be supporting oppression, extremism \r\nand injustice. \r\n In conclusion, my country emphasizes the \r\nimportance of peaceful coexistence among religions \r\nand cultures as an instrument and a necessary means to \r\nstrengthening international peace and security through \r\nmutual respect and tolerance and not as a pretext for \r\nconflict and confrontation. My country calls for \r\neveryone to confront all that could create or lead to \r\nconflicts and incitement to religious, cultural or racial \r\nfanaticism and to reject all forms of expression that \r\ncould be provocative or could insult religious symbols \r\nor beliefs. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nobserver of the Holy See. \r\n Archbishop Chullikatt (Holy See): As the \r\nGeneral Assembly once again considers this agenda \r\nitem, my delegation takes this opportunity to reaffirm \r\nthe importance of States working together to build a \r\nculture of peace, to cultivate productive and sincere \r\nrelationships, to seek out and follow the paths of \r\nforgiveness and reconciliation, to be transparent in \r\ntheir dealings with others and to be faithful to their \r\nword. If cultures are comprised of human persons, \r\nsurely human persons can form a durable culture of \r\npeace. Such an attitude is at the heart of this \r\nOrganization, which was founded on a determination to \r\nlive together in harmony as good neighbours, uniting to \r\nmaintain international peace and security. \r\n Concerning the promotion of a culture of peace, \r\nmy delegation also takes this opportunity to affirm the \r\nimportance of interreligious cooperation, mutual \r\nunderstanding, open-mindedness, solidarity and an \r\nimprovement in overall relations among all \r\ncivilizations and peoples from different cultural and \r\nreligious backgrounds. \r\n The unique contribution of religions to the \r\npromotion of a culture of peace lies in their missions to \r\nserve the spiritual and transcendental dimension of \r\nhuman nature. Furthermore, they contribute to respect \r\nfor human life and the observance of all human rights \r\nand fundamental freedoms. Religions promote \r\nreconciliation by impelling people to move forward in \r\na spirit of mutual cooperation. In a concrete way, they \r\nhelp facilitate the realization of peace, which is not \r\nmerely the absence of conflict but the harmonious \r\ncoexistence of individual citizens within a society \r\ngoverned by justice, one in which the good of all is \r\npromoted to the greatest possible extent. Religions help \r\naccomplish all that is within our human capacity. \r\n In that regard, my delegation draws attention to \r\nthe ongoing work of the Holy See for almost 40 years \r\nin reaching out to other religious traditions to promote \r\ninterreligious harmony. Recent initiatives include the \r\nregular meetings of the Joint Committee for Dialogue \r\nof the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue, \r\nand the Permanent Committee of the Al Azhar for \r\nDialogue among the Monotheistic Religions, the most \r\nrecent of which was held this year in Cairo. It \r\nconcluded, among other things, that the many causes of \r\nviolence among believers of different religious \r\ntraditions include the manipulation of religions for \r\npolitical or other ends; discrimination based on \r\nethnicity or religious identity; and divisions and social \r\ntensions, as well as ignorance, poverty and \r\nunderdevelopment. \r\n The Permanent Committee also made important \r\nrecommendations: to open our hearts to mutual \r\nforgiveness and reconciliation for a peaceful and \r\nfruitful coexistence; to recognize what we have in \r\ncommon and respect legitimate differences as a basis \r\nfor a culture of dialogue; to recognize and respect the \r\ndignity and rights of every human being without bias \r\nrelated to race, ethnicity or religious affiliation; to \r\nacknowledge the necessity of promulgating just laws \r\n A/65/PV.33\r\n \r\n23 10-59074 \r\n \r\nthat guarantee the fundamental equality of all; and to \r\nrecall the importance of education for cultivating \r\nrespect, dialogue and fraternity. Those are concrete \r\nways to oppose violence among followers of different \r\nreligions and to promote peace and harmony among \r\nreligions. \r\n The recent report of the Secretary-General on \r\nintercultural, interreligious and intercivilizational \r\ndialogue (A/65/269) has highlighted the activities of \r\nvarious United Nations entities that contribute to the \r\npromotion of dialogue among cultures, civilizations \r\nand religions. The report also draws attention to the \r\nwork of various offices and agencies of the United \r\nNations system in promoting interreligious \r\ncooperation. \r\n In that regard, it is important that United Nations \r\noffices and agencies engage cultures with full regard \r\nfor the role of religion in those cultures. One crucial \r\nway of doing so is by not attempting to foster global \r\nand regional networks that advance principles at odds \r\nwith the natural moral order — in particular, a \r\nreproductive health and rights agenda that runs counter \r\nto respect for the right to life of the unborn child. Such \r\nan approach would be an attempt to misuse religion for \r\na particular agenda and would be disrespectful to \r\nfollowers of the various faith traditions. \r\n Furthermore, my delegation wishes to draw \r\nattention to the report to the Human Rights Council \r\n(A/HRC/14/23) of the Special Rapporteur on the \r\npromotion and protection of the right to freedom of \r\nopinion and expression. That report emphasizes the \r\nrole of the right to freedom of expression and freedom \r\nof access to means of communication in combating \r\ndiscrimination, as well as in fostering intercultural \r\nunderstanding and dialogue. At the same time, my \r\ndelegation looks forward with interest to the series of \r\nexpert workshops on the prohibition of incitement to \r\nnational, racial or religious hatred that the Office of the \r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights will be holding \r\nthis coming year. \r\n The followers of religions can do a great deal to \r\npromote lasting peace and harmony in the world, and \r\nthe Holy See is grateful for the various initiatives \r\naimed at achieving that noble goal. For its part, my \r\ndelegation remains committed to working with those of \r\nother religious and faith traditions to help bring about a \r\nculture of peace for the benefit of the entire human \r\nfamily, and encourages all States to fully ensure the \r\nright to freedom of religion and conscience for all \r\npeople and communities, for the peaceful coexistence \r\nof all members of the human family. \r\n The Acting President: In accordance with \r\nresolution 49/2 of 19 October 1994, I now call on the \r\nobserver of the International Federation of Red Cross \r\nand Red Crescent Societies. \r\n Mr. Jilani (International Federation of Red Cross \r\nand Red Crescent Societies): In the interest of saving \r\ntime I will read only excerpts from my statement and \r\nwill make the full statement available on our website. \r\n Rooted in its vision and based on its fundamental \r\nprinciples, the International Federation of Red Cross \r\nand Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is seriously \r\ncommitted to promoting a global culture of respect for \r\ndiversity, non-violence and social inclusion. In a \r\nrecently developed IFRC global strategy on violence \r\nprevention, mitigation and response, we define the \r\nculture of non-violence as one that respects human \r\nbeings, their well-being and dignity, and honours \r\ndiversity, non-discrimination, inclusiveness, mutual \r\nunderstanding and dialogue, willingness to serve, \r\ncooperation and lasting peace. \r\n Our fundamental principles and humanitarian \r\nvalues inspired the Code of Conduct for the \r\nInternational Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement \r\nand NGOs in Disaster Relief. To date, the Code has \r\nbeen signed by more than 400 non-governmental \r\norganizations. The Code helps the International Red \r\nCross and Red Crescent Movement and other \r\nhumanitarian actors to bring together the different \r\ncultures worldwide under one set of standards for the \r\nconduct of humanitarian relief. \r\n Last year, young volunteers from 150 countries \r\ngathered in Solferino, Italy, to mark the one hundred \r\nand fiftieth anniversary of the Battle of Solferino. The \r\nyouth committed themselves to inner change and the \r\ndevelopment of skills to promote harmony and positive \r\nattitudes within communities, to live under our seven \r\nfundamental principles as agents of behavioural change \r\nand to renounce violence and promote \r\nnon-discrimination and respect for diversity and the \r\nculture of peace in the world. \r\n In that context, the IFRC’s initiative under the \r\ntheme “Youth as agents of behavioural change” has \r\nbeen launched to empower youth to play a leading role \r\nin transforming mindsets, attitudes and behaviour in \r\nA/65/PV.33  \r\n \r\n10-59074 24 \r\n \r\ntheir local communities. It starts from the premise that \r\na prior commitment to inner change and to being the \r\nliving example of our fundamental principles and \r\nhumanitarian values is the best way to reach that \r\nobjective. \r\n The Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement has \r\nstood for human dignity since our founding almost \r\n150 years ago, when our founder mobilized volunteer \r\nassistance for the wounded on the battlefield in \r\n \r\n Solferino. Today, the promotion of humanitarian \r\nvalues continues to be at the heart of the mandate of \r\nthe International Federation of Red Cross and Red \r\nCrescent Societies. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on these items. The General \r\nAssembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of agenda items 14 and 15. \r\n  The meeting rose at 5.40 p.m. \r\n"
