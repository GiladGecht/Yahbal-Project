(Switzerland) \r\n \r\n \r\n  In the absence of the President, Mr. Carrión-Mena \r\n(Ecuador), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 10 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 41 \r\n \r\nNecessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/65/83) \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/65/L.3) \r\n \r\n Mr. Al-Saadi (Yemen): I am honoured to speak \r\non behalf of the Group of 77 and China at this plenary \r\nmeeting on agenda item 41, entitled “Necessity of \r\nending the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo imposed by the United States of America \r\nagainst Cuba”. \r\n The Group of 77 and China has always been \r\nfirmly against the embargo. At the second South \r\nSummit, held in Doha, Qatar, from 12 to 16 June 2005, \r\nheads of State and Government of the Group of 77 and \r\nChina firmly rejected the imposition of laws and \r\nregulations with extraterritorial impact and all other \r\nforms of coercive economic measures, including \r\nunilateral sanctions against developing countries. They \r\ncalled on the Government of the United States to end \r\nthe economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nagainst Cuba. That embargo, in addition to being \r\nunilateral and contrary to the United Nations Charter \r\nand international law and to the principle of good-\r\nneighbourliness, causes huge material losses and \r\neconomic damage to the people of Cuba. \r\n In this regard, the Group of 77 and China would \r\nlike to reiterate once again its long-standing position \r\non this important matter. At their recently held thirty-\r\nfourth annual meeting, which took place on \r\n28 September at United Nations Headquarters in New \r\nYork, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the member \r\nStates of the Group of 77 and China, \r\n “firmly rejected the imposition of laws and \r\nregulations with extraterritorial impact and all \r\nother forms of coercive economic measures, \r\nincluding unilateral sanctions against developing \r\ncountries, and reiterated the urgent need to \r\neliminate them immediately. They emphasized \r\nthat such actions not only undermine the \r\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter of the United \r\nNations and international law, but also severely \r\nthreaten freedom of trade and investment. They \r\ntherefore called on the international community \r\nto neither recognize these measures nor apply \r\nthem.” (A/65/486, annex, para. 69) \r\n The Group of 77 and China notes the \r\ncommunications from Governments and organs and \r\nagencies of the United Nations contained in the \r\nSecretary-General’s report on the implementation of \r\nresolution 64/6 (A/65/83). Sadly, they demonstrate \r\nunequivocally that the embargo remains largely \r\nunchanged and continues to impose severe economic \r\nand financial restrictions on Cuba. Furthermore, the \r\ndeepening impact of the global economic crisis on \r\nA/65/PV.36  \r\n \r\n10-60252 2 \r\n \r\nCuba, along with the continued embargo by the \r\nGovernment of the United States, will further \r\naggravate the hardships that the people of Cuba are \r\nexperiencing. \r\n The Group of 77 and China calls on the United \r\nStates to heed the international community’s increasing \r\ncalls to bring an end to the five-decade embargo and to \r\nfully adhere to the principles of mutual respect and \r\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of a sisterly \r\ncountry. The embargo frustrates efforts towards the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals \r\nand negatively affects regional cooperation in the area. \r\n The Group of 77 and China are committed to \r\nworking towards a better world for all in which \r\nnations, large and small, can peacefully coexist. The \r\nachievement of such peaceful coexistence among \r\nStates requires adherence by all to the cardinal \r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter and the \r\npeaceful conduct of relations among nations. \r\n The Group of 77 and China will again fully \r\nsupport the draft resolution against the embargo \r\n(A/65/L.3) and urges all Member States to do so as \r\nwell. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): Before \r\ngiving the floor to the next speaker, given the long list \r\nof speakers inscribed on my list, I should like to \r\npropose that the list of speakers for the debate on this \r\nitem now be closed. Unless I hear any objection, I shall \r\ntake it that the Assembly agrees to this proposal. \r\n It was so decided. \r\n Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt): It is with great pleasure \r\nthat I address the General Assembly today on behalf of \r\nthe 118 Members of the United Nations that are \r\nmembers of the Non-Aligned Movement, and to start \r\nby extending a warm welcome to His Excellency \r\nMr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Cuba, and expressing to him the Movement’s \r\nfull support. \r\n Two days ago, on 24 October, we celebrated \r\nUnited Nations Day, the anniversary of the day on \r\nwhich the Organization officially came into existence \r\n65 years ago, when 50 nations, big and small, jointly \r\nproclaimed their resolve to realize a set of noble aims \r\nbased on timeless values and undying ideals and \r\ndecided to eternalize them in the United Nations \r\nCharter. Today, the Non-Aligned Movement once again \r\nreaffirms its unwavering commitment to uphold, \r\npreserve and promote those principles and to ensure \r\nthe continued viability of all the provisions of \r\ninternational law, which together constitute the very \r\nessence of our multilateral work and guide our \r\ncollective efforts to maintain international peace and \r\nsecurity, achieve lasting economic growth and \r\nsustainable development and ensure full respect for \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms. \r\n It is in that context that the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement finds it disturbing that unilateral measures \r\nand laws of a coercive nature are still being adopted \r\nand implemented against countries of the Movement — \r\nmeasures and laws that prevent them from exercising \r\ntheir right to freely decide their own political systems \r\nand the economic and social regimes of their \r\npreference. We cannot but firmly reject such violations \r\nof multilateralism and call for their immediate end. We \r\nalso appeal to all States to refrain from recognizing \r\nsuch measures or laws and to support the claim of \r\naffected countries to compensation for any damage \r\nincurred as a result of this breach of internationally \r\nagreed norms of conduct. \r\n This year, the President of the General Assembly \r\nhas wisely chosen as the theme for the Assembly’s \r\nsixty-fifth session “Reaffirming the central role of the \r\nUnited Nations in global governance”. But that can \r\nonly happen if all countries of the United Nations \r\nrespect the rules that govern multilateralism and refrain \r\nfrom taking measures that defy the principles of the \r\nCharter, the norms of international law and respect for \r\nsovereignty, territorial integrity, good-neighbourliness \r\nand mutual trust. The embargo imposed by the United \r\nStates of America against Cuba undoubtedly runs \r\ncounter to those principles and raises many questions. \r\nHow can a country put up obstacles to the freedom of \r\ncommerce of one of its neighbours when it \r\ncontinuously calls for nations to trade freely? How can \r\na country impose limits on the right of its people to \r\ntravel when it strongly advocates the freedom of \r\nmovement? The Non-Aligned Movement is bewildered \r\nby those apparent contradictions and believes that they \r\nshould be promptly rectified. \r\n To that end, the United States should once and for \r\nall end its embargo against Cuba. It is the longest and \r\ntoughest system of sanctions that the United States has \r\never applied against any country throughout its history. \r\nThis is not only the demand of Cuba or of the members \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement, as clearly expressed by \r\ntheir heads of State and Government at the \r\n A/65/PV.36\r\n \r\n3 10-60252 \r\n \r\nMovement’s fifteenth summit conference held in \r\nSharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, in July 2009; it is the demand \r\nof 187 countries of the United Nations, which last year \r\nvoted in favour of resolution 64/6, the eighteenth \r\nresolution to be adopted by the Assembly on the issue. \r\nWe once again urge the United States to immediately \r\nand fully comply with all General Assembly \r\nresolutions calling for the immediate end of the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed \r\nagainst Cuba. \r\n I am sure that members will agree with me that \r\nthere is no need for a detailed exposé of the damage \r\nthat the embargo is causing to the economic and social \r\ndevelopment of Cuba and to the welfare of its people. \r\nWe are all aware of the detrimental repercussions of \r\nthe embargo, not only on the financial, banking, trade, \r\ninvestment and tourism sectors of the Cuban economy \r\nbut also on health, nutrition, water quality, education \r\nand culture. The evidence on the ground is a stark \r\nreminder of what the embargo has done to Cuba. \r\nFurthermore, this unilateral blockade has an extended \r\neffect on companies and citizens from third countries. \r\nIt thus violates the sovereign rights of many other \r\ncountries. The Non-Aligned Movement reiterates its \r\ndeep concern over the widening of the extraterritorial \r\nnature of the embargo, which we consider an added \r\nargument in favour of the prompt elimination of those \r\nunjustified sanctions. \r\n The Chair of the Non-Aligned Movement has \r\nstood here before the Assembly year after year and \r\nurged the United States to remain true to the words that \r\nthe founding fathers of the United Nations clearly \r\ninscribed in the Charter by taking the necessary steps \r\nto swiftly lift the embargo it is imposing against Cuba. \r\nIn a period increasingly characterized by international \r\ncooperation to address challenges to our very existence \r\nand to ensure the welfare of our peoples, maintaining \r\nthe embargo seems to be part of an era long gone. The \r\nUnited States Administration should now more than \r\never match its statements about openness and \r\nengagement with the outside world to actions that \r\nwould be welcomed by the international community, \r\nwhich will soon vote in favour of the draft resolution \r\non the necessity of ending the embargo on Cuba \r\n(A/65/L.3). The Non-Aligned Movement will continue \r\nto send this message to the United States: end the \r\nblockade now. I express the expectation that this time \r\nour call will not go unheard. \r\n Mr. Bowler (Malawi): It is with great pleasure \r\nthat I address the General Assembly. Let me join my \r\ncolleague who spoke before me to add Malawi’s voice \r\nand that of the Group of African States to the call \r\nregarding the necessity of ending the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States of America against Cuba, which has been \r\non the United Nations agenda for the past 18 years. \r\n Speaking on behalf of the Group of African \r\nStates, the continent of Africa and as Chair of the \r\nAfrican Union, I reiterate the decision of the fifteenth \r\nSummit of the African Union Heads of State and \r\nGovernment, which met in Kampala, Uganda, on \r\n27 July 2010. On taking a decision on the issue of \r\nsanctions on Cuba, the African Union called upon the \r\nGovernment of the United States of America to remove \r\nthe long-standing and unjustifiable economic and trade \r\nembargo imposed on the Republic of Cuba, thereby \r\nenabling that country to enjoy all the legitimate \r\nprospects for its sustained development, which is long \r\noverdue. \r\n In his address before a plenary meeting of the \r\nGeneral Assembly on 23 September 2010, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Bingu Wa Mutharika, President of the \r\nRepublic of Malawi and Chairman of the African \r\nUnion, stated categorically that sanctions have caused \r\ngreat economic hardship, especially for the poor and \r\nvulnerable in targeted countries, including Cuba. On \r\nbehalf of the African Union, he challenged those \r\nconcerned to promote social progress and better \r\nstandards of life, as set forth in the Preamble to the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. We in Africa believe \r\nthat it is now time to give dialogue a chance and allow \r\nCuba to continue to effectively contribute its fair share \r\nto global development, and the United States should \r\nlift its long-standing embargo. \r\n The countries of Africa, like the majority of the \r\ncountries and Member States of the United Nations, as \r\ncan be seen from the voting trend over the years in the \r\nGeneral Assembly, are of the view that it is high time \r\nthat the embargo on the people of Cuba were lifted, \r\nconsidering that it has now been 50 years since it was \r\nimposed on the innocent people of that country. \r\nChildren born after 1960, who are now men and \r\nwomen, have not known anything else except the \r\nembargo on this beautiful country that has so much \r\npotential and goodwill. \r\nA/65/PV.36  \r\n \r\n10-60252 4 \r\n \r\n It is time for change. Now is the time. The \r\nAfrican Group and the African Union have the \r\nconfidence that President Obama’s Administration can \r\nand should bring this change. Once again, the African \r\nGroup, the African Union and indeed Malawi call for \r\nthe immediate lifting of the embargo on beautiful \r\nCuba. \r\n Ms. Bethel (Bahamas): I have the honour to \r\naddress the General Assembly on behalf of the \r\n14 member States of the Caribbean Community \r\n(CARICOM), which also aligns itself with the \r\nstatements made by the representative of Yemen, who \r\nspoke on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, and by \r\nthe representative of Egypt, who spoke on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement. \r\n As we have done in the past, CARICOM member \r\nStates continue to reiterate their unequivocal \r\nopposition to the United States imposition of the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo against \r\nCuba, which has been opposed by the overwhelming \r\nmajority of the international community for the past \r\n18 consecutive years. The unilateral imposition of \r\nextraterritorial laws on third States is contrary to both \r\nthe letter and the spirit of the United Nations Charter. \r\nThe embargo itself runs counter to the principles of \r\nmultilateralism, international law, sovereignty and free \r\ntrade, which this body traditionally champions. \r\n The stubborn persistence of the embargo is \r\napparently impervious to the sustained chorus of \r\ninternational criticism or to the logic of a world that \r\nhas changed immeasurably over the past four and a \r\nhalf decades since the imposition of the blockade. The \r\nembargo has now outlived the Cold War by 19 years. It \r\nhas outlasted the terms of eight Presidents of the \r\nUnited States and that of Cuban President Fidel Castro. \r\nOver 70 per cent of Cubans alive today were born \r\nunder the embargo. CARICOM considers the embargo \r\nan anachronism that has succeeded only in contributing \r\nto the suffering of generations of ordinary Cubans and \r\nis unnecessarily increasing tensions between the \r\nUnited States and Cuba. It serves no justifiable legal, \r\npolitical or moral purpose in the twenty-first century. \r\n The punitive embargo is of particular concern to \r\nCARICOM, which shares a history, culture and \r\nsisterhood with the people of Cuba. Cuba is the most \r\npopulous State of the Caribbean region and an integral \r\npart of the pan Caribbean process. Caribbean ties with \r\nCuba have historical significance, cemented by years \r\nof active cooperation at various levels. The member \r\nStates of CARICOM continue to maintain close \r\nrelations with Cuba through a wide range of \r\nprogrammes of cooperation in areas including trade, \r\nhealth care, infrastructure and human resource \r\ndevelopment. In many ways, our future regional \r\ndevelopment depends upon our collective advancement \r\nand progress. In that context, we view the embargo not \r\njust as a punitive act against Cuba but as an \r\nimpediment to our shared regional development. \r\n This year’s report of the Secretary-General on the \r\nimplementation of resolution 64/6 (A/65/83), like \r\nprevious reports on this matter, outlines responses from \r\nan overwhelming majority of Member States that share \r\na common perspective as to the continued unilateral \r\nembargo against Cuba. Indeed, the report of the \r\nSecretary-General demonstrates that the embargo even \r\naffects the manner in which organs and agencies of the \r\nUnited Nations system carry out their work in Cuba. \r\nCARICOM States therefore reaffirm the positions of \r\nthe Group of 77 and China and the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement in opposing such unilateral actions. We \r\nmaintain the position that constructive engagement and \r\npeaceful negotiations remain the only acceptable \r\nmeans for advancing long-term peace stability. \r\n The annual resolution, which has been repeatedly \r\nadopted by the General Assembly, also constitutes a \r\nblot on the credibility and efficacy of the United \r\nNations. There is probably no single issue on which the \r\nUnited Nations has made such sustained, strong and \r\nunambiguous pronouncements. Yet the embargo \r\ncontinues, in the face of overwhelming international \r\nreproach. CARICOM believes that the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly should explore additional \r\nmechanisms to operationalize the words of the \r\nresolution. The continued disregard for the will of the \r\nGeneral Assembly will only complicate the President’s \r\nstated goal of improving the role of the United Nations \r\nin matters of global governance. \r\n The significance of the embargo on the Cuban \r\neconomy continues to be of great concern to \r\nCARICOM. The humanitarian impact on the people of \r\nCuba, especially in the area of health care and food, is \r\nespecially saddening. The inability of Cuba to acquire \r\nnecessary medical equipment, spare parts and the latest \r\ngeneration medications because of the embargo \r\ncontinues to affect the health-care system, where \r\ntreatment remains free of charge to the Cuban people. \r\n A/65/PV.36\r\n \r\n5 10-60252 \r\n \r\n With the strengthening and more frequent storms \r\nand hurricanes wrought by climate change and Cuba’s \r\ngeographic susceptibility to these natural disasters, the \r\nunacceptable humanitarian impact of the embargo \r\nbecomes even more acute. Additionally, construction \r\nmaterials and heavy equipment are becoming \r\nincreasingly inaccessible to Cuba because of stringent \r\nrules regarding origin and restrictions against \r\ncorporations based outside of the United States. The \r\nnegative effects on the Cuban economy and its growth \r\nare obvious and tangible. The embargo has now cost \r\nCuba almost $100 billion since it was imposed in 1962. \r\n It is remarkable that, even as Cuba struggles with \r\nthe recent unfortunate string of natural disasters and \r\nthe continued impacts of the global economic crisis, it \r\ncontinues to assist other nations in the developing \r\nworld, starting with its immediate Caribbean \r\nneighbours. Thousands of Caribbean students have \r\nattended Cuban universities without charge. Thousands \r\nhave received free surgery and medical assistance in \r\nCuba. And thousands more have been treated in their \r\nhome countries by Cuban doctors and nurses. We have \r\nbenefited from technical expertise, capacity-building \r\nprogrammes, infrastructure assistance and from the \r\nselfless generosity of the Cuban people. The people of \r\nCuba have threatened no one, and neither the embargo \r\nnor its deleterious side effects has prevented them from \r\ncontinually extending a hand of friendship and \r\nsolidarity, even across ideological divides. \r\n Given Cuba’s peaceful, generous and cooperative \r\ninternational stance, it should not be isolated or \r\nexcluded from participation in regional and \r\nhemispheric processes. CARICOM reiterates its \r\nunwavering support for the right of the Cuban people \r\nto self-determination, in a manner beneficial to their \r\nsocial and economic development. We call once again \r\nfor the end to an embargo that has preserved a state of \r\ntension between two neighbouring countries and \r\ngenerated concern, disquiet and discomfort throughout \r\nthe Caribbean. \r\n CARICOM States continue to enjoy friendly \r\nrelations with both Cuba and the United States. Those \r\ntwo neighbours, a mere 90 miles apart, have produced \r\ngreat scholars, scientists and global leaders. The two \r\ncountries possess proud and noble histories, and are \r\npopulated by friendly, open and loving peoples. As \r\nsuch, in spite of a long history of dashed hopes, \r\nCARICOM continues to believe that a new beginning \r\nis possible in the relationship between the \r\nGovernments of Cuba and the United States. \r\n However, we consider the lifting of the embargo \r\nto be a prerequisite of any meaningful rapprochement \r\nbetween the two countries, not a negotiated end result. \r\nWhile there have been some recent positive indications \r\nof flexibility, there have also been reminders of \r\nunilateral rigidity. \r\n We remain guardedly optimistic that the United \r\nStates recent recommitment to multilateralism will \r\nresult in an increased willingness to consider the \r\nopinions and concerns of its global friends and \r\npartners. On this issue, global opinion can hardly be \r\nconveyed in a more convincing or consistent manner. \r\nAs such, our faith in the recent pronouncements of the \r\nUnited States Government carries with it an \r\nexpectation that these few remaining historical and \r\nunilateral wrongs will be righted expeditiously. \r\n It is within this context that CARICOM States \r\nunstintingly support the draft resolution on the \r\nnecessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo by the United States of America \r\nagainst Cuba (A/65/L.3). \r\n Mrs. Dunlop (Brazil) (spoke in Spanish): I have \r\nthe honour to speak on behalf of the member States of \r\nthe Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR) and \r\nVenezuela, a State that is in the process of joining the \r\nbloc. The associated States of Bolivia, Chile, \r\nColombia, Ecuador and Peru align themselves with this \r\nstatement. \r\n First of all, I would like to express a warm \r\nwelcome to His Excellency Mr. Bruno Rodríguez \r\nParrilla, Cuba’s Minister for Foreign Affairs. \r\n MERCOSUR was founded on the principles of \r\nsolidarity, interdependence and good-neighbourly \r\nrelations. We believe that tolerance is the basis for the \r\nhistoric convergence in our continent of peoples from \r\nevery corner of the world. We are joined with our Latin \r\nAmerican neighbours by the desire to live in peace, \r\npromote mutual understanding, defend the \r\nindependence, equality and sovereignty of States and \r\npromote respect for international law. These ideals \r\nhave historically guided the relationship among Latin \r\nAmerican States and societies and are enshrined in the \r\ncharter of the Organization of American States. \r\nA/65/PV.36  \r\n \r\n10-60252 6 \r\n \r\n In that regard, we have welcomed efforts and \r\ndecisions taken last year, including the easing of travel \r\nrestrictions, the removal of limits on remittances and \r\nthe relaxation of conditions for sending packages. \r\nHowever, it is nevertheless unfortunate that further \r\nsteps in that direction have not been applied recently, \r\nthat the embargo against Cuba continues unchanged \r\nand that conditions are once again being placed along \r\nthe path towards greater openness and direct dialogue. \r\n MERCOSUR and its associated States believe \r\nthat the embargo against Cuba is contrary to the \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and that \r\nit contravenes the rules of international law, in \r\nparticular in relation to the equality of States, the \r\nprinciple of non-interference in internal affairs and the \r\npeaceful solution of conflicts. Moreover, the embargo \r\nis contrary to the principles of justice and human \r\nrights, for it punishes an entire innocent population for \r\nno apparent reason. \r\n We reject on principle unilateral and \r\nextraterritorial measures that cause irreparable harm to \r\nthe welfare of peoples and obstruct the process of \r\nregional integration. \r\n We once again reaffirm our unequivocal support \r\nfor the draft resolution before us (A/65/L.3). \r\nMERCOSUR and its associate States reiterate their \r\ncommitment to multilateralism as a legitimate tool for \r\nresolving disputes and as an effective way to promote \r\ninternational cooperation and understanding among \r\npeoples. \r\n The economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nagainst Cuba is just another example of an outdated \r\npolicy that does not belong in today’s world. By \r\nadopting the draft resolution before us, the General \r\nAssembly will bear witness once again to its resolute \r\npolitical will in defence of the ideals of freedom, \r\nsolidarity and respect for sovereignty and international \r\nlaw. \r\n Ms. Rovirosa (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): For \r\n19 consecutive years, the Government of Mexico has \r\ncome to this forum to reiterate its rejection of the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo against \r\nCuba and to reaffirm its opposition to the use of \r\ncoercive actions that have no legal foundation in the \r\nUnited Nations Charter. \r\n In 1992, the Government of the Republic of Cuba \r\nsubmitted a draft resolution for consideration and \r\nadoption by the General Assembly in order to put an \r\nend to the embargo imposed by the Government of the \r\nUnited States. Ever since, Mexico has come to this \r\nforum to reaffirm its long-standing position of \r\nprinciple that any kind of political, economic or \r\nmilitary sanctions to be imposed on States can flow \r\nonly from decisions or recommendations made by the \r\nGeneral Assembly or the Security Council once they \r\nhave determined that such actions are necessary in \r\naccordance with the United Nations Charter and \r\ninternational law. \r\n Mexico believes that unilateral measures applied \r\nin an extraterritorial fashion on third-party countries \r\nhave severe humanitarian consequences, in open \r\ncontradiction of the goals that supposedly drive them. \r\nMoreover, such measures also signal the abandonment \r\nof diplomacy and dialogue as appropriate ways of \r\nresolving disputes among States. \r\n Multilateralism, respect for international law and \r\nfor the rules and principles that regulate coexistence \r\nbetween nations, as well as respectful dialogue remain \r\nthe best way to resolve disputes, guarantee peaceful \r\ncoexistence among States and ensure an international \r\nclimate of peace. \r\n Various organs and entities of the United Nations \r\nsystem have noted the negative impact that the \r\nembargo has on Cuba’s economic and social \r\ndevelopment, as evident in the economic, commercial \r\nand financial transactions that this country undertakes. \r\nThey have also noted the damaging effects on sensitive \r\nareas that have a direct impact on the lives of Cuba’s \r\npeople, as well as the indirect repercussions on third-\r\nparty countries owing to the impossibility of \r\ninteracting with Cuba when it comes to many \r\neconomic and social activities. \r\n That is why Mexico has always supported all \r\ninitiatives against the embargo and unilateral measures \r\nin various forums, at the United Nations and the United \r\nNations Conference on Trade and Development as well \r\nas in others such as the Organization of American \r\nStates, the Latin American and Caribbean Economic \r\nSystem, the Ibero American Summit and the Rio \r\nGroup. We will continue to support Cuba’s inclusion in \r\nglobal economic, commercial and financial dialogue \r\nand trade mechanisms in line with that country’s own \r\n A/65/PV.36\r\n \r\n7 10-60252 \r\n \r\ndesire and sovereign decisions, so as to foster \r\ncooperation and development. \r\n The Government of Mexico bases its bilateral and \r\nmultilateral relations on the overarching principles of \r\ninternational law that govern peaceful and civilized \r\ncoexistence among sovereign States in the modern \r\nworld. Those principles have preserved the same \r\nsolidarity and continuity over time in the relations \r\nbetween Mexico and Cuba, two States that have \r\nmaintained steadfast historical ties in an atmosphere of \r\nrenewed trust and unfailingly following the purposes \r\nand principles enshrined in the Charter of the United \r\nNations. \r\n Based on what I have said here, Mexico reiterates \r\nthat the economic, commercial and financial blockade \r\nimposed by the United States of America on Cuba must \r\ncome to end, given that the embargo is based on a \r\npolicy that, extended for almost half a century, has \r\naffected the people of Cuba in a silent, systematic and \r\ncumulative manner. Mexico believes that the \r\nobservance of international law and the rules and \r\nprinciples governing coexistence among nations, as \r\nwell as respectful dialogue irrespective of imbalances \r\nor differences, are necessary tools for overcoming \r\ndifferences between States and for ensuring a climate \r\nof international peace. \r\n From our own experience we know that societies \r\nevolve and change according to their own \r\ncircumstances, and not as the result of arbitrary or \r\ncoercive measures imposed from outside. In the light \r\nof this, the Mexican Government again reiterates its \r\nfirm commitment to contributing actively and \r\ndecisively to the rule of international law as it pertains \r\nto this item on the General Assembly’s agenda. We will \r\nsupport the draft resolution (A/65/L.3) that has been \r\nproposed at this session. \r\n Mr. Wang Min (China) (spoke in Chinese): At \r\nthe outset, I would like to welcome the report of the \r\nSecretary-General submitted under this agenda item \r\n(A/65/83). The Chinese delegation associates itself \r\nwith the statement made by the representative of \r\nYemen on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. \r\n For 18 consecutive years, by an overwhelming \r\nmajority, the General Assembly has adopted \r\nresolutions urging all countries, in compliance with the \r\nUnited Nations Charter and the principles of \r\ninternational law, to repeal or invalidate all laws and \r\nmeasures with extraterritorial effect that compromise \r\nthe sovereignty of other States, undermine the \r\nlegitimate rights and interests of entities and \r\nindividuals under the jurisdiction of those States and \r\naffect the freedom of trade and navigation. \r\n Regrettably, however, those resolutions have not \r\nbeen effectively implemented over the years, and the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo against \r\nCuba imposed by the country concerned is yet to be \r\nlifted. This constitutes a serious violation of the \r\npurposes and principles of the Charter, adversely \r\naffects normal commercial and trade exchanges \r\nbetween Cuba and other countries and impedes the \r\noperations of the agencies of the United Nations \r\nsystem in Cuba. What is more, it also seriously \r\nundermines the Cuban people’s rights to survival and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n The information obtained from Governments and \r\ninternational organizations in the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport shows that over the past year the economic \r\nembargo against Cuba has remained substantially \r\nunchanged. It thus continues to inflict enormous \r\neconomic and financial losses on Cuba, which \r\nimmeasurably limit the Cuban people’s efforts to \r\neradicate poverty, promote economic and social \r\ndevelopment and achieve the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. The international community is now faced with \r\nmultiple serious challenges posed by the financial, \r\nfood and energy crises, as well as climate change, \r\nmaking the embargo and sanctions against Cuba all the \r\nmore unreasonable. \r\n China pursues an independent and peaceful \r\nforeign policy, and is committed to developing friendly \r\nrelations with all countries on the basis of the five \r\nprinciples of peaceful coexistence. We are of the view \r\nthat every sovereign State is entitled to independently \r\nchoose its own suitable social system and path to \r\ndevelopment. No country has the right to unilaterally \r\nimpose military, political, economic or other forms of \r\nsanctions on other countries. Experience shows that \r\nsanctions usually fail to achieve their expected results; \r\non the contrary, they may end up victimizing civilians, \r\nin particular the most vulnerable groups, such as \r\nwomen and children. \r\n In today’s world, multilateralism and the \r\ndemocratization of international relations have taken \r\nroot in people’s hearts, while openness, cooperation, \r\nmutual benefit and win-win progress have become the \r\nconsensus of the international community. When \r\nA/65/PV.36  \r\n \r\n10-60252 8 \r\n \r\ndisputes arise, dialogue on an equal footing, with \r\nfriendly consultation, represents the best path to a \r\nsettlement. The Chinese Government has always \r\nmaintained that countries should develop their relations \r\nin compliance with the purposes and principles of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter. \r\n It is always our hope that in State-to-State \r\nrelations, dialogue will replace confrontation, and \r\nengagement and exchange will replace embargoes and \r\nsanctions. The Chinese Government urges the country \r\nconcerned to terminate its economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo against Cuba as soon as possible. In \r\nthis connection, China will support the draft resolution \r\n(A/65/L.3) that has been submitted by Cuba under this \r\nagenda item. \r\n Mr. Valero Briceño (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): The Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela aligns itself with the statements \r\nmade this morning by the representative of Egypt on \r\nbehalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, by the \r\nrepresentative of Yemen on behalf of the Group of 77 \r\nand China and by the representative of Brazil on behalf \r\nof the Southern Common Market. I would like, \r\nhowever, to raise the voice of my country at this \r\nhistoric moment. \r\n During the sixty-fourth session of the General \r\nAssembly, the overwhelming majority of Member \r\nStates voted in favour of ending the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial blockade that has lasted a \r\nhalf century and seeks to limit the right of the Cuban \r\npeople to decide their own destiny. Those countries \r\nforcefully call for respect of the sovereignty and self-\r\ndetermination of peoples and strongly condemn threats \r\nto the political independence of States, as inconsistent \r\nwith the principles of the United Nations Charter. \r\n Will the imperialist Government of the United \r\nStates continue to ignore the will of this Assembly, \r\nwhich has repeatedly condemned the blockade against \r\nour sister Republic of Cuba? In reaffirming its long-\r\nstanding commitment to the values of humanism and \r\nsolidarity among peoples, the Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela rejects the aggression against the Cuban \r\npeople, which undermines the peaceful coexistence of \r\nnations and international law. \r\n The change of administration in the United States \r\ngenerated great expectations for a new policy that \r\nwould respect the sovereignty of nations. There is \r\nnothing, however, that suggests that there have been \r\nsubstantial changes in the foreign policy of the United \r\nStates, in particular with regard to the blockade against \r\nCuba. The United States Government continues to \r\nignore the voices of the peoples of the world, which \r\ndemand the end of that genocidal policy as a violation \r\nof the most basic human rights. \r\n It is noteworthy that the Torricelli and Helms-\r\nBurton Acts, which prevent Cuban trade with United \r\nStates companies and their subsidiaries in third \r\ncountries, continue to be in force. Through the \r\nextraterritorial application of United States legislation, \r\nthe blockade affects the legitimate interests of any \r\nsovereign State that legitimately decides to become a \r\nbusiness partner of the Republic of Cuba. \r\n The devastating collateral damage inflicted each \r\nday on the brotherly people of the island by the \r\nblockade policy is unjustifiable. As noted by the \r\nAmerican Association for World Health, the blockade \r\nwould cause a massive humanitarian disaster in Cuba if \r\nthat nation did not have an extraordinary public health \r\nsystem. The blockade against Cuba has diverse impacts \r\non the daily lives of women and men, children and the \r\nelderly. It manifests itself harshly in the way it affects \r\nthe quality of life of children with acute lymphoblastic \r\nleukaemia, who must do without the standard treatment \r\nfor this disease. The blockade also makes it difficult \r\nfor people to enjoy their housing rights. It hinders the \r\nimport of building materials needed to replace and \r\nrepair the huge number of buildings damaged by \r\nhurricanes. The blockade causes millions in losses each \r\nyear in Cuba’s basic industries, sugar, steelwork and \r\ntourism. \r\n In short, the blockade represents a repeated and \r\nunilateral denial by a signatory to the United Nations \r\nCharter of the right to development of another Member \r\nState and its people, without the aggrieved State ever \r\nhaving committed aggression of any kind against the \r\naggressor State. And what is the reason for the \r\nrecurring hostility against the Cuban people? The \r\nanswer was given by Ernesto Che Guevara on 9 April \r\n1961, when he said that the heroic Cuban people had \r\nrisen up against the “despotic rule of imperialism, \r\nwhich crushes national identity, insults patriotic feeling \r\nand colonizes the economy”. The heroism of the Cuban \r\npeople is, therefore, an example of the struggle for \r\ndignity and sovereignty of nations. The imperialists \r\nhave not been able and will not be able to break that \r\npatriotic spirit. \r\n A/65/PV.36\r\n \r\n9 10-60252 \r\n \r\n Despite the criminal blockade, the Cuban \r\nGovernment and people have provided extraordinary \r\nsupport to the plans and programmes developed in \r\nVenezuela to achieve social justice. The Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela wishes to express its gratitude \r\nfor that invaluable solidarity. \r\n This is a special day at the United Nations. We \r\nare discussing an issue of cardinal importance to the \r\npeoples of the world. The Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela strongly embraces the sovereignty, \r\nindependence and dignity of nations, and therefore we \r\nstrongly support the draft resolution presented by our \r\nsister Republic of Cuba (A/65/L.3), which again \r\ndemands the suspension of the economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo imposed by the United States on \r\nCuba. \r\n Mr. Khazee (Islamic Republic of Iran): The \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran subscribes to the statements \r\nmade on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement and the \r\nGroup of 77 and China on the subject under \r\nconsideration. We would also like to cordially welcome \r\nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of \r\nCuba to this meeting. Many of the rights of nations and \r\npeople are of an economic and social nature. Attempts \r\nto deprive people and countries of those rights infringe \r\non their basic human rights and are therefore \r\nillegitimate. Indeed, that is the main feature of \r\nsanctions as we know them today. \r\n Economic blockades and sanctions have to be \r\nviewed as illegitimate for at least the following \r\nreasons: First, there is no single case where certain \r\nPowers have not been behind economic sanctions \r\nagainst developing countries or territories. Sanctions \r\nhave turned out to be a tool, not to spur international \r\npeace and security but to impose hegemonic intentions \r\nof big Powers against other countries and populations. \r\nTherefore, the imposition or prolongation of sanctions \r\nor their extension against any State under the pretext of \r\nsecuring international peace and security but with the \r\nreal aim of achieving the political objectives of one or \r\na few States is deplorable. Secondly, worst of all, \r\nsanctions always end up targeting the daily lives of \r\nordinary people. They have a dramatic impact on rights \r\nrecognized in the International Covenant on Economic, \r\nSocial and Cultural Rights. For instance, they often \r\ncause significant disruption in the distribution of food, \r\npharmaceuticals and sanitation supplies, jeopardize the \r\nquality of food and the availability of clean drinking \r\nwater, severely interfere with the functioning of basic \r\nhealth and education systems, and undermine the right \r\nto work. \r\n The victimization of innocent civilians in \r\ninstances where sanctions have been imposed, \r\nincluding ostensibly legitimate ones, remains a matter \r\nof serious concern and dismay. There is ample \r\nevidence that sanctions, first and foremost, put the \r\neconomic growth and prosperity of people in peril. \r\nThey are simply misguidedly punitive. Thirdly, \r\nnotwithstanding all the harm that sanctions cause, they \r\nhave also proven to be futile. There is no strong proof \r\nthat independent countries compromise their revered \r\nnational interests and yield to the antagonistic wills of \r\nhegemonic Powers because of sanctions. Fourthly, the \r\nargument that sanctions are a better option than more \r\nforceful measures has also proven to be irrelevant. \r\nCertain Powers are not concerned about the \r\nconsequences of punitive measures, nor do they \r\nconform in their actions to the provisions of the United \r\nNations Charter. They make their cases independently \r\nof the concerns of the international community and \r\ntend to misuse the available means in the Charter to \r\naddress their narrowly defined interests. Whenever \r\nthey deem it necessary, they without fail resort to \r\nforce, with or without first exercising sanctions or \r\nother non-violent measures and with or without United \r\nNations approval. Sanctions will not stop them from \r\nexercising force, should they themselves find it \r\ndesirable. \r\n Yet, the most unjustifiable and deplorable form of \r\nsanctions is the imposition of unilateral blockades and \r\nextraterritorial application of domestic laws by one \r\nState, which happens, unsurprisingly, to be the United \r\nStates of America. Such actions against others have an \r\neffect not only on the population under sanctions but \r\nalso on the interests of the third parties, who are \r\ndisproportionately and unreasonably being punished. \r\nNumerous international documents have asked for the \r\nswift invalidation of all such measures. This Hall has \r\nwitnessed during the past 19 years the overwhelming \r\nsupport of the international community and \r\ncountries — coming from every region and part of the \r\nworld — to the call made through 18 resolutions so far \r\nto annul the inhumane and futile measures imposed \r\nagainst the Government and people of Cuba. \r\n Indeed, one may wonder what more could be \r\ndone to convince the United States to lift the economic \r\nblockade. What more could be said to argue that those \r\nillegal measures flagrantly violate the United Nations \r\nA/65/PV.36  \r\n \r\n10-60252 10 \r\n \r\nCharter, the rule of international law, the multilateral \r\ntrading system, the norms and principles governing \r\nrelations among States, as well as the clear will of the \r\ninternational community? That will has been \r\nunequivocally expressed in so many resolutions \r\nadopted by this body. \r\n The economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nimposed by the United States against Cuba, which has \r\nlasted for decades, serves no purpose other than to \r\ninflict tremendous hardship and suffering on the people \r\nof Cuba, especially women and children. The embargo \r\nhas seriously jeopardized the legitimate rights and \r\ninterests of Cuba and other States. The economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo against Cuba runs \r\ncounter to the principles of international law and \r\ncontradicts the letter and spirit of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. Such measures continue to adversely \r\naffect the living conditions and human rights of the \r\nCuban people and to hamper the efforts of the Cuban \r\nGovernment to achieve its development goals — in \r\nparticular the eradication of poverty and hunger and \r\nthe promotion of health and education — as \r\nindispensable means for achieving economic and social \r\ndevelopment. \r\n The Islamic Republic of Iran strongly rejects and \r\nopposes the application of unilateral economic and \r\ntrade measures imposed by one State against another, \r\nas well as the extraterritorial application and effects of \r\nnational legislation on the sovereignty of other States. \r\nWe oppose and condemn such measures and laws and \r\ntheir continued application. We will do everything to \r\neffectively thwart them and urge other States to do \r\nlikewise by refraining from recognizing, adopting or \r\nimplementing extraterritorial or unilateral coercive \r\nmeasures or laws, including unilateral economic \r\nsanctions, other intimidating measures and arbitrary \r\ntravel restrictions that seek to exert pressure on other \r\ncountries — threatening their sovereignty and \r\nindependence and their freedom of trade and \r\ninvestment and preventing them from exercising their \r\nright to decide, by their own free will. \r\n The Islamic Republic of Iran shares the concerns \r\nof the Cuban people and Government and therefore \r\nemphasizes the urgent need to put an end to such \r\nmeasures against Cuba and other developing countries \r\nand calls for the full implementation of the relevant \r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions. \r\n In conclusion, sanctions, whoever imposes them \r\nunder whatever pretext or disguise, continue to be \r\nillegitimate, futile and misguidedly punitive. \r\n Mr. Benmehidi (Algeria): Algeria aligns itself \r\nwith the statements made by the representatives of \r\nEgypt on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement and of \r\nYemen on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. I \r\nwould also like to warmly welcome His Excellency Mr. \r\nBruno Rodríguez Parrilla, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof Cuba. \r\n Algeria would like to reiterate that it is deeply \r\nconcerned by the continuation of the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo unilaterally \r\nimposed against Cuba by the United States of America \r\nfor nearly half a century. The consecutive annual \r\nadoption by almost all members of the General \r\nAssembly of a resolution, virtually the same each year, \r\ncalling for the lifting of the embargo against Cuba \r\nreflects the profound will of the international \r\ncommunity to put an end to that situation, which has \r\nlasted far too long. \r\n In accordance with the principles of its foreign \r\npolicy, Algeria has always condemned the imposition \r\nof extraterritorial applications of laws and all forms of \r\ncoercive economic and trade measures, such as the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo against \r\nCuba, which contradicts international law and the \r\npurposes and principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations. Every Member State should respect the \r\nprinciples of the Charter, including, in particular, the \r\nsovereign equality of States, territorial integrity, \r\nnon-intervention and non-interference in the internal \r\naffairs of any other State. \r\n It is a fact that that blockade is causing huge \r\nmaterial loss and economic damage to Cuba. It is also \r\nnegatively affecting the well-being of the Cuban \r\npeople on a daily basis. Those consequences are \r\nexacerbated by the adverse effects of the current global \r\neconomic and financial crisis, which have seriously \r\ncompromised Cuba’s development efforts, as \r\nhighlighted in the report of the Secretary-General \r\n(A/65/83), based on information provided by \r\n134 Governments and 25 organs and agencies of the \r\nUnited Nations system, on the implementation of \r\nresolution 64/6. \r\n It is important to recall the long-standing position \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement on the issue, confirmed \r\nagain at the fifteenth summit, which rejected the use of \r\n A/65/PV.36\r\n \r\n11 10-60252 \r\n \r\neconomic measures of coercion and extraterritorial \r\napplications of law imposed on developing countries. \r\nThe heads of State and Government of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement also urged the Government of \r\nthe United States of America to put an end to the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo against \r\nCuba, in strict compliance with the United Nations \r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions on that issue, adopted \r\nannually since 1992. \r\n Therefore, it is with conviction that Algeria will \r\nvote in favour of the draft resolution submitted, \r\nA/65/L.3, entitled “Necessity of ending the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States of America against Cuba”. \r\n Mr. Sangqu (South Africa): For almost 50 years, \r\nthe people of Cuba have suffered as a result of the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial blockade by the \r\nUnited States of America, which is a major hindrance \r\nto the development of Cuba. That blockade constitutes \r\na violation of international law, and its imposition \r\nshows disregard for the noble and abiding principles \r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. The \r\ninternational community has consistently opposed the \r\nembargo against Cuba. The unity with which the \r\ninternational community reacted to that embargo when \r\nit condemned it with a record vote of 187 to 3 in 2009 \r\nis testimony to the outright rejection of that unilateral \r\nact, which has gone on for far too long and must come \r\nto an end. \r\n In that regard, South Africa supports the draft \r\nresolution before us (A/65/L.3), entitled “Necessity of \r\nending the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo imposed by the United States of America \r\nagainst Cuba”. We do so because that relentless and \r\nunilateral action has caused untold suffering to the \r\npeople of Cuba. \r\n My delegation associates itself with the \r\nstatements delivered by the representatives of Egypt on \r\nbehalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, of Yemen on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China and of Malawi on \r\nbehalf of the African Group. We also wish to extend a \r\nwarm welcome to His Excellency Mr. Bruno Rodríguez \r\nParrilla, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba, and, \r\nthrough him, our fraternal greetings to the loving \r\npeople of Cuba. \r\n For South Africa and its people, together with our \r\nentire region, we continue to be humbled by the \r\nhistoric role that Cuba played in our liberation and \r\nfreedom. True to their commitment to international \r\nsolidarity, justice, freedom and equality, the people of \r\nCuba did not stand by as spectators when others were \r\noppressed. For that reason, we owe it to Cuba and its \r\npeople to join the progressive forces of the world and \r\nunequivocally condemn the continued illegal embargo \r\nimposed by the United States of America against Cuba. \r\n South Africa has repeatedly joined the majority of \r\ncountries in expressing its disagreement with and \r\nopposition to the embargo imposed by the United \r\nStates against Cuba. In so doing, South Africa has been \r\nguided by the basic norms of international law and \r\nconduct in its principled support for the need to \r\neliminate punitive economic measures as a means of \r\npolitical and economic coercion. South Africa views \r\nthe continued imposition of an economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo against Cuba as a violation of \r\nthe principle of the sovereign equality of States. \r\n In spite of that embargo, the Cuban people have \r\nextended a hand of friendship and solidarity to other \r\npeople around the world. Cuba’s outstanding work in \r\nthe areas of health, education and biotechnology in the \r\ndeveloping world, particularly in Africa, is recognized \r\nby the international community. South Africa and Cuba \r\nhave maintained long-standing cordial relations, which \r\ncontinue to expand through increased cooperation on a \r\nwide range of issues, including economic, commercial \r\nand financial collaboration. The South Africa-Cuba \r\nJoint Consultative Mechanism and the South Africa-\r\nCuba Joint Bilateral Commission continue to serve as \r\nstrategic platforms for the expression of our strong \r\nbilateral relations. \r\n We all, without exception, acknowledged the \r\nhardship that we and our respective peoples have faced \r\nafter the onset of the financial crisis, which to date \r\ncontinues to endure. The extremely harsh global \r\nfinancial and economic crisis, as well as the embargo, \r\nonly worsen the fate of the Cuban people and stifle the \r\noutstanding contribution by Cuba to the economic and \r\nsocial development of the poor. The international \r\ncommunity should, therefore, take meaningful steps to \r\nfree the Cuban people from the devastating effects of \r\nthe embargo. \r\n South Africa calls on the United States to end its \r\nunilateral isolation of Cuba. We urge the United States \r\nto engage in a meaningful dialogue with Cuba. We \r\nfurther call for accelerated action to dismantle the \r\nunjust sanctions regime against Cuba. Our collective \r\nA/65/PV.36  \r\n \r\n10-60252 12 \r\n \r\nmessage should, therefore, be loud and clear to the \r\nUnited States, namely, that it should end its embargo \r\nand sanctions. \r\n South Africa reiterates its support for the draft \r\nresolution before us today, and calls on all States to \r\nrefrain from recognizing the unilateral coercive \r\nmeasures and laws that defy the principles of the \r\nCharter and the norms of international law. \r\n Mr. Kleib (Indonesia): In contributing to the \r\ndebate on agenda item 41 concerning the necessity of \r\nending the embargo imposed against Cuba since 1961, \r\nthe delegation of Indonesia wishes to associate itself \r\nwith the statement of the Group of 77 and China \r\ndelivered earlier by the representative of Yemen and \r\nwith the statement of the Non-Aligned Movement \r\ndelivered by the representative of Egypt. \r\n Yet again, the General Assembly has been \r\nconvened to consider the impact of the 50 year \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo that was \r\nunilaterally imposed on Cuba during the long Cold War \r\nof the twentieth century. Although unilaterally \r\nimposed, the embargo has also impacted the economic \r\nand commercial relations of third countries. Much has \r\nchanged since the initial imposition of the embargo. \r\nThe world of 2010 is very different from that of 1961. \r\nEven with the impact of recent crises on the global \r\neconomy, nations have opted to work together to \r\novercome the difficulties created by those crises. That \r\ntestifies to the fact that globalization has created the \r\nconditions for true global solidarity and partnership \r\namong nations. The embargo against Cuba runs \r\ncontrary to that spirit of unity and solidarity, which is \r\ntaking root in the world today. \r\n Viewed from the perspective of the United \r\nNations Charter and international law, the embargo \r\nlacks fairness and respect for the equality that should \r\nexist among and between sovereign States. The Charter \r\nis clear on the need for nations to develop friendly \r\nrelations among themselves. It is equally emphatic \r\nabout the need for nations to refrain from actions that \r\nwill threaten the political independence of others or \r\nlead to intervention in matters that are essentially \r\nwithin the domestic jurisdiction of a particular State. \r\n The embargo infringes on those principles. It has \r\na sharp political edge, which undermines relations \r\nbetween the main parties. Instead of a dialogue to \r\nresolve differences, what we have is an unwanted \r\nstand-off that does not allow for an exchange of views \r\nto normalize relations. Not only does the embargo give \r\nrise to political complications, but the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial hardships that it causes can \r\nhardly be justified on any humanitarian ground. It is a \r\ngreat burden for any developing country, whose people \r\nwould benefit so much more from cooperation than \r\nfrom confrontation. \r\n Indonesia remains steadfast in its opposition to \r\nthe embargo imposed unilaterally against Cuba. While \r\nit is true that some small meaningful changes in the \r\nembargo have occurred in recent times, such as the \r\neasing of travel restrictions to Cuba and the removal of \r\nobstacles to the transfer of remittances, the preferred \r\nresolution to the dispute is certainly for the embargo to \r\nbe lifted completely. The time is ripe for relations \r\nbetween the two main parties to be transformed \r\nthrough constructive engagement. \r\n Lifting the embargo would also be in keeping \r\nwith the spirit of the times. It would demonstrate \r\nunambiguously respect for the principle of \r\nnon-intervention, as embodied in the United Nations \r\nCharter and international law. Cuba would then be able \r\nto exercise its right to develop, unhindered by \r\nrestrictions to its trade and other business activities. \r\nThe tensions that now exist between the two nations \r\nwould also dissolve. \r\n It is Indonesia’s hope that in the near future we \r\nwill see a thawing of the frosty relations that now keep \r\nthose two important neighbouring States apart. We \r\nbelieve that it is time for peaceful coexistence. \r\n Mr. Beck (Solomon Islands): I take the floor to \r\nspeak on agenda item 41, “Necessity of ending the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed \r\nby the United States of America against Cuba”. My \r\ndelegation begins first of all by associating this \r\nstatement with the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of Yemen on behalf of the Group of 77. \r\n For the last 19 years, resolutions on lifting the \r\n51-year embargo on Cuba have come before this \r\nAssembly. Likewise, the international community \r\nannually pronounces on the resolution, calling for the \r\nlifting of the embargo. The embargo continues to be \r\ncloaked in such an ideological suit that opportunities to \r\nrelax and bring about its lifting continue to elude us. \r\n It is even sadder that that is happening between \r\ngeographical neighbours. We continue to witness Cuba \r\ntrying to adapt to the challenge of living under trying \r\n A/65/PV.36\r\n \r\n13 10-60252 \r\n \r\ncircumstances without asking for a lighter burden. We \r\ncontinue to be deeply touched by that, as new \r\ngenerations born into the embargo take on the \r\nresponsibility before them with a common sense of \r\npurpose. That testifies to a committed population, with \r\na host of approaches aimed at cutting up the huge \r\nchallenge into bits and pieces and managing those \r\nchallenges within their own means. \r\n My delegation hopes that the principle of good-\r\nneighbourliness will win the day and that the people of \r\nour partner country, the United States, will restore, \r\nrenew, revive, reclaim and redeem friendship and \r\nrespect for Cuba’s sovereignty within the letter and \r\nspirit of the United Nations Charter. \r\n At the end of the day, it is people who remain at \r\nthe centre of the Charter of the United Nations, which \r\nbegins with the words “We the peoples”. We members \r\nof the United Nations must continue to give humanity a \r\nchance. We must continue to do what is necessary in \r\nthe name of peace and security and in the preservation \r\nof the rights of the Cuban people to development. The \r\nimposition of the embargo is stuck in time, and we \r\nmust not leave it to time or chance to see change. \r\nRather, it is up to us, the Member States, to effect that \r\nchange by calling for the lifting of the blockade. Our \r\naction on that noble request is also a declaration of our \r\ncharacter, our wish to reach out to all. \r\n Therefore, Solomon Islands closes by calling for \r\nthe unconditional lifting of the blockade against the \r\nCuban people and replacing it with genuine dialogue \r\nand cooperation. In the spirit of friendship and \r\noutreach to all, we call for carrying out that humble \r\nrequest in the name of humanity. \r\n Mr. Raja (India): India associates itself with the \r\nstatements made by the representatives of Yemen on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China and of Egypt on \r\nbehalf of the Non-Aligned Movement. My delegation \r\nwould like to thank the Secretary-General for the \r\ncomprehensive report on the agenda item under \r\nconsideration today (A/65/83). \r\n This is the nineteenth year in succession that this \r\nAssembly has been deliberating the almost five-\r\ndecade-old economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo imposed on Cuba. In all those years, this \r\nAssembly has repeatedly rejected the imposition of \r\nlaws and regulations with an extraterritorial impact and \r\nall other forms of coercive economic measures, which \r\nhurt the progress and prosperity of the people the world \r\nover. \r\n The General Assembly has also called upon all \r\nStates to respect their obligations under the United \r\nNations Charter and international law and to repeal and \r\ninvalidate laws and measures that have extraterritorial \r\neffects on the sovereignty of other States and affect the \r\nlegitimate interests of entities or persons under their \r\njurisdiction and on the freedom of trade and \r\nnavigation. Despite the repeated calls of the General \r\nAssembly, its resolutions remain unimplemented, in \r\ncontravention of world opinion. Such callous disregard \r\nof the will of the United Nations undermines the \r\ncredibility of this body and weakens multilateralism. \r\n Meanwhile, more importantly, the Cuban people \r\ncontinue to face the hardships induced by the embargo \r\nin their daily lives. The embargo and its extraterritorial \r\naspects continue to remain in full force. In particular, \r\ndomestic United States laws, such as the Cuban \r\nDemocracy Act of 1992 and the Helms-Burton Act of \r\n1996, have enhanced the extraterritorial reach of the \r\nembargo, encompassing foreign companies and foreign \r\nsubsidiaries of United States companies doing business \r\nwith Cuba or Cuban entities. \r\n The embargo, particularly through its \r\nextraterritorial effects, is adversely affecting the lives \r\nof the Cuban people and their efforts to move forward \r\nwith the socio economic development of their country. \r\nThe embargo has denied Cuba access to United States \r\nmarkets, investment, technology, financial services and \r\nscientific, educational, cultural and sports institutions. \r\nIn the past five decades, Cuba has had to pay enormous \r\nextra costs to obtain products, technology and services \r\nfrom third countries located thousands of kilometres \r\naway. The extraterritorial application of the United \r\nStates embargo has discouraged investment, \r\ntechnology and its transfer and sale, and other forms of \r\nbusiness collaboration between Cuba and third \r\ncountries. \r\n Health care, one of the commitments of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, is particularly \r\naffected owing to the continuous denial of critical \r\nmedical equipment, medicines, technologies and \r\ndiagnostic aids to Cuban hospitals. Cuba’s efforts to \r\nprovide health assistance to fellow developing \r\ncountries as part of South-South cooperation has also \r\nsuffered from the embargo, making that yet another \r\nA/65/PV.36  \r\n \r\n10-60252 14 \r\n \r\nunexpected negative extraterritorial impact of the \r\nembargo. \r\n In the report of the Secretary-General, various \r\nUnited Nations entities have detailed the impact of the \r\nembargo and its extraterritorial effects. The United \r\nNations Resident Coordinator in Havana has noted the \r\nhigh cost and negative impact of the embargo on \r\nhumanitarian and development cooperation \r\nimplemented by the United Nations system in Cuba. \r\nThe Economic Commission for Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean has stated that the embargo considerably \r\naffects the standard of living of Cuban citizens and \r\nmay threaten Cuba’s food security in the future. \r\n The United Nations Development Programme has \r\nnoted that the effects of the embargo can be observed \r\nin all spheres of Cuba’s social and economic activities, \r\nincluding the lives of the most vulnerable. The United \r\nNations Conference on Trade and Development has \r\nstated that the impact on trade of the extraterritorial \r\napplication is considerable owing to significant United \r\nStates interests in transnational corporations. In recent \r\nyears, the financial, food and energy crises have made \r\nthe impact of the embargo even more acute. \r\n Geography indicates that there ought to be \r\nnormal relations in trade and investment between Cuba \r\nand the United States of America. Despite the embargo, \r\nthe United States continues to be a major source of \r\nfood imports for Cuba, insofar as permitted by the \r\nUnited States Trade Sanctions Reform and Export \r\nEnhancement Act of 2000. That only confirms the high \r\npotential for trade, commerce and investment between \r\nthose countries. \r\n People-to-people contact between the two \r\ncountries remains severely curtailed. The lifting of \r\nUnited States travel restrictions on Cuba would bring \r\nimmense benefits to the Cuban tourism sector and to its \r\npeople. Congressional efforts in the United States to \r\nrelax or lift the embargo and the substantial interest in \r\nUnited States business circles for unhindered access to \r\nthe Cuban market lend further credence to the annual \r\nUnited Nations resolutions calling for the lifting of the \r\nUnited States embargo against Cuba. \r\n Before concluding, permit me to reiterate India’s \r\nopposition to unilateral measures by countries that \r\nimpinge on the sovereignty of another country, \r\nincluding attempts to extend the application of a \r\ncountry’s laws extraterritorially to other sovereign \r\nnations. \r\n India joins all other nations in calling for an \r\nimmediate end to the United States embargo against \r\nCuba. India supports the draft resolution moved by \r\nCuba today (A/65/L.3). \r\n Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): The Russian delegation welcomes the \r\npresence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba, \r\nMr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, at today’s discussion. \r\nWe thank the Secretary-General for his comprehensive \r\nreport on the issue before us (A/65/83). The opinions \r\nof the Member States presented in the document \r\nclearly show their disagreement with and objections to \r\nthe introduction of the unilateral and exterritorial \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo against \r\nCuba. \r\n Russia’s position of principle with respect to the \r\ndraft resolution (A/65/L.3) is well known. Our country \r\nfully shares the view of the overwhelming majority of \r\nMember States of the international community in \r\nfirmly rejecting the United States embargo against \r\nCuba and in calling for its lifting as soon as possible. \r\nWe are convinced that ending the embargo against \r\nCuba and normalizing United States-Cuban relations \r\nwould generally help to improve the island’s situation. \r\nWe believe that the maintenance of the commercial, \r\neconomic and financial embargo against Cuba by the \r\nUnited States is counterproductive, anachronistic and \r\nnot in keeping with current realities. \r\n Last year, President Obama’s Administration took \r\nsteps to lift a number of restrictions on visits to Cuba \r\nby United States citizens who have relatives there and \r\non monetary and postal transfers to Cubans from the \r\nUnited States, as well as steps to resume dialogue on \r\nmigration issues. We therefore expect other actions that \r\nwill improve relations between the two countries and, \r\nultimately of course, put a complete end to the long \r\nobsolete commercial and economic embargo against \r\nCuba. \r\n For the time being, we feel that we must continue \r\nour policy of voting in favour of the draft resolution \r\ncalling for the lifting of the embargo, guided by the \r\nfundamental principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations on the inadmissibility of any discriminatory \r\nmeasures or interference in the internal affairs of \r\nStates. \r\n A/65/PV.36\r\n \r\n15 10-60252 \r\n \r\n Mr. Kapambwe (Zambia): Zambia will vote in \r\nfavour of draft resolution A/65/L.3, as we have done in \r\nthe past and for the reasons listed in the statements by \r\nthe representatives of Malawi on behalf of the African \r\nGroup, of Yemen on behalf of the Group of 77 and \r\nChina, and of Egypt on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement, with which we would like to be associated. \r\n On 12 June 1987, President Ronald Reagan made \r\na statement that has remained indelibly etched in the \r\nhistory of the Cold War era. Addressing himself to the \r\nPresident of the Soviet Union, he said “Mr. Gorbachev, \r\ntear down this wall”, in reference to the Berlin Wall. \r\nToday, for the sake of the suffering people of Cuba, \r\nincluding women and children, we wish to make an \r\nearnest and simple appeal: President Obama, please do \r\nthe right thing and lift the United States embargo \r\nagainst Cuba. It is time to be on the right side of \r\nhistory. \r\n Mrs. Waffa-Ogoo (Gambia): The Gambia wishes \r\nto associate itself with the statements made by the \r\nrepresentatives of Yemen on behalf of the Group of 77 \r\nand China, of Egypt on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement, and of Malawi on behalf of the African \r\nGroup. \r\n Last year, my delegation joined members of the \r\nAssembly in calling for an immediate end to one of the \r\nmost protracted political sanctions regime that the \r\nAssembly has ever known. We spoke in the hope that \r\nthe opportunity had finally arrived for the embargo to \r\nbecome a thing of the past. To our bewilderment, the \r\nhalf-century-old regime is still intact, with occasional \r\ncosmetic tweaks made to resemble real change. Real \r\nchange is long overdue. \r\n At this year’s general debate, the Gambia’s \r\nForeign Minister said: \r\n  “The United States embargo against Cuba is \r\none of the longest running political disputes that \r\nthis Assembly has needed to address for almost \r\ntwo decades. It is embarrassing that such a cruel \r\nand outmoded form of settling scores in \r\ninternational relations is still in place. The \r\nembargo has no legitimacy or appeal, and it is \r\ntime for those that imposed it to show genuine \r\nleadership by ending it.” (A/65/PV.20) \r\nIn the coming months, we will look forward to the \r\nexercise of true leadership towards ending that penal \r\nregime. \r\n The devastating effects of the embargo on the \r\nGovernment and people of Cuba are amply \r\ndocumented in the Secretary-General’s report in \r\ndocument А/65/83. It is also clear that the United \r\nNations system, too, is paying a heavy price in its \r\nactivities with Cuba, especially when it comes to the \r\ntravel of Cuban United Nations personnel, visa \r\nrestrictions and higher procurement costs directly \r\nassociated with the embargo. \r\n Cuban agriculture is not spared. Cuban health \r\ncare, medical and scientific research, educational \r\ncooperation, cultural exchanges and intellectual \r\nproperty rights are all adversely affected by the \r\nextraterritorial reach of the embargo. \r\n Cuban companies, United States companies and \r\nthird-country companies continue to be penalized for \r\ndoing business in Cuba. Travel to Cuba continues to be \r\nrestricted in ways that make the cost prohibitive \r\nbecause of cumbersome procedures that visitors are \r\nrequired to meet. Financial transactions between Cuba \r\nand other countries have also not been spared. The \r\nodious nature of that embargo is apparent to all. Its \r\ncontinuation therefore cannot serve any useful purpose. \r\n Even children are not spared by the embargo. The \r\nSecretary-General’s report highlights the hurdles \r\nencountered by United Nations agencies in the \r\nprocurement of Ritonavir, a paediatric antiretroviral \r\ndrug. It states that the HIV/AIDS programme has also \r\nbeen affected by the lack of procurement of the \r\nantiretroviral drugs used in children, Kaletra and \r\nNorvir, both produced by Abbott, which is a United \r\nStates-based company. \r\n The Cuba we know does not deserve those \r\nsanctions. It is a leader in humanitarian assistance \r\naround the world and in providing health care and \r\neducation to millions all over the world. The Cuba we \r\nknow is not a threat to any country’s national security. \r\nThe Cuba we know is a country that promotes friendly \r\nrelations among its peoples and the countries of every \r\nregion represented in this Assembly. \r\n It is no coincidence, therefore, that the \r\nGovernment and people of the Gambia will today stand \r\nin solidarity with Cuba by voting for draft resolution \r\nA/65/L.3. It is once again our hope that those who \r\nimpose and maintain that inhumane embargo will find \r\nit in their hearts to call for its total and unconditional \r\nlifting. It is time to consign the Helms-Burton Act and \r\nthe Torricelli Act to the dustbin of history. A regime of \r\nA/65/PV.36  \r\n \r\n10-60252 16 \r\n \r\nfriendly relations and good-neighbourliness should \r\nfinally replace them in the birth of a new era of Cuban-\r\nAmerican relations. We call on other countries to \r\nsupport the draft resolution and to further support \r\nefforts to dismantle that intricate web of extraterritorial \r\nsanctions. \r\n Mr. Christian (Ghana): Ghana welcomes the \r\npresence of His Excellency Mr. Bruno Rodríguez \r\nParrilla, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba. \r\n We associate ourselves with the statements \r\ndelivered today by the representatives of Yemen, Egypt \r\nand Malawi on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement, and the African Group, \r\nrespectively. \r\n As in the past, Ghana has asked for the floor to \r\njoin other speakers in expressing its concern at the \r\ncontinued imposition and implementation of an \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo against \r\nCuba by the United States. Last year, members of the \r\nAssembly voted overwhelmingly in favour of \r\nresolution 64/6, calling for an end to this blockade. The \r\nstrong solidarity demonstrated year after year in the \r\nAssembly speaks for itself — those restrictions against \r\na Member State by a Member State should end. \r\n In fulfilment of Ghana’s commitment to the \r\npurposes and principles enshrined in the United \r\nNations Charter and in international law, we have \r\nsteadfastly refrained from promulgating and enforcing \r\nlaws whose extraterritorial effects adversely affect the \r\nsovereignty of other States, the legitimate interests of \r\nentities or persons under their jurisdiction, and their \r\nfreedom of trade and navigation. Indeed, Ghana and \r\nCuba enjoy excellent bilateral relations, based on our \r\nshared goals and responsibilities towards an equitable \r\nworld in the spirit of cooperation and multilateralism. \r\n Our long-standing cooperation with Cuba in the \r\nareas of health, education and sports continues to \r\nexpand, and currently there are more than 200 Cuban \r\nmedical professionals working in hospitals across \r\nGhana and also teaching in some of our universities. \r\nCuba continues to offer scholarships to Ghanaian \r\nstudents to study in Cuba in sectors that are deemed \r\ncritical to the development agenda pursued by the \r\nGovernment of Ghana. \r\n The embargo, in place for more than a half \r\ncentury, has taken its toll on the well-being of the \r\nordinary people of Cuba, women and children. They \r\nare counting on the support of the rest of the world for \r\nan end to the embargo, which has had a debilitating \r\neffect on their lives. Ghana has chosen to offer that \r\nsupport today in the spirit of fellow feeling for our \r\nbrothers and sisters in Cuba, and urges the United \r\nStates to end its embargo. \r\n Mr. Goddard (Barbados): Barbados wishes to \r\nassociate itself with the statements by the \r\nrepresentatives by Yemen on behalf of the Group of 77 \r\nand China and by the Commonwealth of the Bahamas \r\non behalf of the Caribbean Community. \r\n The purposes and principles of the United \r\nNations Charter call for respect for the sovereign \r\nequality of States, non-interference in their internal \r\naffairs, the right of peoples to self-determination, the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes and the maintenance of \r\nfriendly relations among States. The maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security and the peaceful \r\ncoexistence of States require that all Member States \r\nadhere to the rule of law, including the principles \r\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter. \r\n For those reasons, Barbados opposes the \r\nimposition of unilateral punitive measures, especially \r\nwhere they involve the extraterritorial application of \r\nlegislation that violates international law and restricts \r\nfreedom of trade and navigation and the sovereignty \r\nand freedom of States. Barbados views the continued \r\nimposition of the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo against the Republic of Cuba as a violation of \r\nthe principles of the United Nations Charter. \r\n The Government of Barbados fully embraces \r\nCuba as an important partner in the Caribbean region \r\nand remains committed to a policy of constructive \r\nengagement with its Government and people. We fully \r\nrespect its sovereign rights and support its full \r\nintegration into the hemisphere. We do not believe that \r\nefforts to isolate Cuba or measures that create greater \r\nhardship for the Cuban people, such as the decades-\r\nlong economic embargo, will foster change in that \r\ncountry. \r\n The embargo inhibits the development of normal \r\neconomic and cultural relations. It distorts trade and \r\ninvestment flows and impedes legitimate business \r\nopportunities among neighbouring States. Furthermore, \r\nas the response of the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme in the report of the Secretary-General \r\nstates: \r\n A/65/PV.36\r\n \r\n17 10-60252 \r\n \r\n “The impact of the embargo can be observed in \r\nall spheres of the country’s social and economic \r\nactivities, affecting opportunities for national and \r\nlocal development and creating economic \r\nhardship.” (A/65/83, p. 121) \r\n Barbados maintains excellent relations both with \r\nthe United States of America and with Cuba and places \r\ngreat value on its long-established and friendly \r\nrelations with both countries. In that spirit, we join the \r\ninternational community in calling for an immediate \r\nend to the embargo imposed by the United States on \r\nCuba and its people. We further urge the Government \r\nof the United States of America to engage in a \r\nconstructive dialogue with the Government of Cuba \r\naimed at normalizing relations with Cuba. Such a step \r\nwould remove a source of tension and conflict and \r\nwould improve the prospects for peace, development \r\nand cooperation within our region. \r\n In support of the principles of international law \r\nand the United Nations Charter, as in previous years, \r\nBarbados will vote in favour of the draft resolution \r\n(A/65/L.3) before us today. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Bruno Eduardo \r\nRodríguez Parrilla, Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nCuba, to introduce draft resolution A/65/L.3. \r\n Mr. Rodríguez Parrilla (Cuba) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): Serious and imminent dangers threaten the \r\nexistence of our species. To preserve human life, we \r\nmust preserve peace. The use of only a small part of \r\nthe world’s enormous nuclear arsenal would mean the \r\nend of the species. The only guarantee that nuclear \r\nweapons will not be used by any State or any \r\nindividual is their destruction, along with the \r\ngeneration of conventional weapons of an almost \r\nsimilar lethal power developed of late. \r\n The only solution is disarmament. To survive, a \r\nleap in humanity’s awareness is crucial. That is \r\npossible only through the dissemination of truthful \r\ninformation on such issues, which most politicians \r\nconceal or ignore, which the press do not publish and \r\nwhich for the people are so horrendous that they seem \r\nunbelievable. \r\n We are in a new era, and in our opinion, it is for \r\nthis General Assembly of the United Nations to lead, \r\nwith utmost urgency — and as Fidel Castro ceaselessly \r\nasks — a world mobilization to demand respect for the \r\nright of human beings and of peoples to live. Let us \r\nbuild a different world order. Let us institute a common \r\nethic based on human solidarity and justice. Let us find \r\na solution to conflicts through dialogue and \r\ncooperation. Let selfishness and plundering, which \r\nlead to war and the use of force, cease. In the face of \r\nthe serious threat, let us put aside that which confronts \r\nus or divides us and let us unite to save peace, the \r\nplanet and the life of future generations. \r\n Under those circumstances in particular, the \r\nUnited States policy against Cuba does not have any \r\nethical or legal basis, credibility or support. That is \r\ndemonstrated by the more than 180 votes in the \r\nAssembly, which in recent years have called for an end \r\nto the economic, commercial and financial blockade. In \r\nthe Secretary-General’s report made available to us \r\n(A/65/83), more than 180 countries and agencies of the \r\nUnited Nations system document their opposition to \r\nthat policy. \r\n The rejection by Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean is forceful and unanimous. The Unity \r\nSummit of Latin America and the Caribbean, held in \r\nCancún in February 2010, stated that resolutely. The \r\nleaders of the region have conveyed that directly to the \r\ncurrent American President. It is clear that the express \r\nrejection of the blockade and the Helms-Burton Act \r\ncharacterizes, as few items do, the political heritage of \r\nthe region. \r\n Equally unequivocal views have been endorsed \r\nby the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, the Ibero \r\nAmerican summits, the European Union and Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean summits, the African Union, \r\nthe summits of the African, Caribbean and Pacific \r\nStates and virtually any group of nations that has \r\ndeclared its adherence to international law and to \r\nobservance of the principles and purposes of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter. \r\n There is broad and growing consensus in \r\nAmerican society and the Cuban emigrants in that \r\ncountry against the blockade and in favour of a change \r\nof policy towards Cuba. Recent polls show that 71 per \r\ncent of United States citizens advocate the \r\nnormalization of relations between Cuba and the \r\nUnited States, while 64 per cent of them and a similar \r\nproportion of Cuban residents in south Florida oppose \r\nthe Cuba travel ban, which violates their citizens’ \r\nrights. \r\nA/65/PV.36  \r\n \r\n10-60252 18 \r\n \r\n As with other issues, two years after the United \r\nStates President announced a new beginning with \r\nCuba, the facts confirm that nothing has changed. The \r\nPresident has not used his extensive privileges to relax \r\nthe blockade. The sanctions against Cuba remain intact \r\nand are strictly implemented. \r\n The economic siege was tightened in 2010, and \r\nits daily impact continues to be seen in all aspects of \r\nlife in Cuba. Its consequences are particularly serious \r\nin areas that are sensitive for the population, such as \r\nhealth and food. Cuban ophthalmologic services cannot \r\nperform transpupillary thermotherapy, which is done \r\nthrough a surgical microscope, to treat children \r\nsuffering from retinoblastoma, that is, cancer of the \r\nretina. It is impossible to obtain the equipment for that \r\ntreatment, which can only be bought from the \r\nAmerican company Iris Medical Instruments. Without \r\nthat technology, it is impossible to treat a retina tumour \r\nand to save a child’s affected eye. \r\n Cuban children have no access to a medicine \r\ncalled Sevofluorane, the most advanced general \r\ninhalation anaesthetic agent, that is, an anaesthetic to \r\noperate on children, because its manufacturer, the \r\nAmerican company Abbott, is not allowed to sell to \r\nCuba. Nor can an optical coherence tomographer be \r\nobtained from the German company Carl Zeiss to \r\nexamine the retina and the optical nerve because it has \r\ncomponents supplied by the American company \r\nHumphrey. \r\n The prevailing onerous and discriminatory \r\nconditions for purchases of American foodstuffs — \r\nwhich are supposedly protected as a humanitarian \r\nexception, while all international trade standards are \r\nviolated — resulted in the dramatic reduction of those \r\noperations in the past year. That reality harms not only \r\nour people, but also American farmers. \r\n It would be untruthful for anyone in this Hall to \r\nagain describe as a trading partner a country to which \r\nCuba cannot sell a single dose of medicine or a single \r\ngram of nickel. \r\n Although Washington has very selectively \r\nauthorized some cultural, academic and scientific \r\nexchanges, they are still subject to severe restrictions, \r\nand many such projects could not be carried out \r\nbecause licences, visas and other permits were denied. \r\nIt is not widely known that Cuban artists are prohibited \r\nfrom receiving payment for their performances in this \r\ncountry. \r\n Persecution with regard to Cuban property and \r\nassets and commercial and financial transfers to and \r\nfrom Cuba or those involving institutions or \r\nindividuals based in our country has intensified. In the \r\npast year, Treasury and Justice Departments fines on \r\nfirms of their country and Europe for transactions with \r\nCuba, among other States, total more than \r\n$800 million. In a clear escalation, the American \r\nGovernment has also appropriated transfers in \r\ncurrencies of third countries, such as the euro. The \r\nconfiscation of a transfer of more than €107,000 \r\nbelonging to the company Cubana de Aviación, which \r\nwas made through the Banco Popular Español from \r\nMadrid to Moscow, was true theft. \r\n The direct economic damage caused to the Cuban \r\npeople by the implementation of the blockade in the \r\npast 50 years exceeds $751 billion dollars at that \r\ncurrency’s current value. \r\n Despite universal rejection of that policy, high \r\nofficials of that Government have reiterated that it will \r\nremain unchanged. On 2 September, President Obama \r\nhimself ratified the sanctions against Cuba, referring to \r\nthe alleged national interest of the United States. \r\nHowever, everyone knows that the White House \r\ncontinues to pay more attention to the well-funded \r\nspecial interests of a tiny minority that has made the \r\npolicy against Cuba a very profitable business. \r\n It is clear that the United States has no intention \r\nwhatsoever of lifting the blockade. There is no sign \r\nthat the Government has any will to dismantle the most \r\nirrational aspects of what is already the most \r\ncomprehensive and long-lasting set of sanctions and \r\ncoercive economic measures ever applied against any \r\ncountry. Traditionally, whenever the pretexts brandished as \r\nalleged obstacles to lifting the blockade against Cuba \r\ncollapse, new excuses replace them in order to justify \r\nthe continuation of a policy that is unsustainable from \r\nevery viewpoint. \r\n According to several news agencies, very \r\nrecently, on 19 October, President Obama described all \r\nthe practices that, in his view, are currently taking \r\nplace in Cuba as insufficient and made any new step \r\nconditional on internal changes that they would like to \r\nsee in our country. The President is wrong to assume \r\nthat he has the right to interfere and to rate processes \r\ntaking place in Cuba today. It is regrettable that he is \r\nso misinformed and ill advised. \r\n A/65/PV.36\r\n \r\n19 10-60252 \r\n \r\n The transformations that we Cubans are \r\nembarking on today are in tune with our aspirations \r\nand the sovereign decisions of our people. They seek to \r\nupdate our economic model and make it efficient, to \r\nimprove our society, extend our culture and develop \r\nour socialism. Those changes do not seek to appease \r\nthe desires or satisfy the interests of the United States \r\nGovernment, which have always been contrary to those \r\nof the Cuban people. For the super-Power, any process \r\nthat does not lead to the establishment of a regime \r\nsubordinated to its interest will be inadequate. But that \r\nis not going to happen, because many generations of \r\nCubans have dedicated and continue to dedicate the \r\nbest of their lives to defending the sovereignty and \r\nindependence of Cuba. \r\n The United States Government has also ignored \r\nthe many declarations and proposals submitted by the \r\nCuban Government — both in public and in private — \r\nthat bear witness to our willingness to establish a \r\nserious and constructive dialogue under conditions of \r\nequality and with full respect for our independence. \r\n No response has been given to the new \r\ncooperation projects proposed by the Cuban \r\nGovernment in the course of the year 2010, aimed at \r\nmaking progress in areas of common interest such as \r\nthe fight against drug trafficking and terrorism, the \r\nprotection of the environment, the prevention of \r\nnatural disasters, including addressing possible \r\naccidents that may result from oil exploration in the \r\nGulf of Mexico. An opportunity to advance in areas of \r\nmutual benefit to our peoples has, once again, been \r\nmissed. On the contrary, the United States Government \r\nhas continued its arbitrary practices of adding Cuba’s \r\nname to spurious lists, including those of States that \r\nallegedly sponsor international terrorism, produced by \r\nthe State Department to classify the behaviour of other \r\nnations. That country does not have the moral authority \r\nto draft such lists; as a rule, its name should appear at \r\nthe top of them all. There is no reason whatsoever to \r\ninclude Cuba on any of those lists. \r\n The United States Government likewise has \r\nupheld the unjust conviction against the five Cuban \r\nantiterrorist fighters who have been imprisoned for \r\nmore than 12 years and whose cause has inspired broad \r\nsolidarity within the international community. Cuba, \r\nwhich has been and is still a victim of State terrorism, \r\ncalls for that Government to put an end to the double \r\nstandards and impunity enjoyed in its own territory by \r\nthe confessed perpetrators of acts of terrorism that \r\nwere organized as part of the anti Cuban policy of that \r\ncountry, which was conceived to destabilize our \r\ncountry during the 1960s and which included sabotage, \r\nkidnapping, assassination and armed aggressions. That \r\nwould be a genuine contribution to the international \r\nstruggle against the scourge of terrorism. \r\n It is both outrageous and abnormal that the policy \r\nof sanctions and subversion applied by the United \r\nStates against Cuba continues to be guided by the \r\nthinking contained in the memorandum by the former \r\nDeputy Assistant Secretary of State, Lester Mallory, \r\nwritten on 6 April 1960, which was declassified a few \r\nyears ago. I quote: \r\n  “The majority of Cubans support Castro [...] \r\nThere is no effective political opposition [...] The \r\nonly foreseeable means of alienating internal \r\nsupport [from the Government] is through \r\ndisenchantment and disaffection based on \r\neconomic dissatisfaction and hardship. \r\n  Every possible means should be undertaken \r\npromptly to weaken the economic life [...] \r\ndenying money and supplies to Cuba, to decrease \r\nmonetary and real wages, to bring about hunger, \r\ndesperation and overthrow of government.” \r\n This quote reveals a cruel and aggressive policy, \r\nabsolutely contrary to international law, that this \r\nGovernment insists on maintaining, knowing that it \r\ncauses harm and suffering and violates the human \r\nrights of an entire people. \r\n This is not a bilateral issue, as is constantly \r\nrepeated by representatives of the United States. Its \r\ndistinct extraterritorial character is endorsed by laws, \r\nand there are many examples of the implementation of \r\ncoercive measures against citizens and entities from \r\nthird countries. \r\n The blockade, given its nature and scope, \r\nqualifies as an act of genocide under Article II of the \r\nConvention on the Prevention and Punishment of the \r\nCrime of Genocide, adopted in 1948, and also as an act \r\nof economic warfare, in accordance with the \r\nDeclaration concerning the Laws of Naval War, \r\nadopted in 1909. It is a hostile and unilateral act that \r\nshould be ceased unilaterally. \r\n Once again, on behalf of the people of Cuba, I \r\nask the representatives of all the countries gathered \r\nhere to vote in favour of draft resolution A/65/L.3, \r\nwhich I am honoured to present, entitled “Necessity of \r\nA/65/PV.36  \r\n \r\n10-60252 20 \r\n \r\nending the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo imposed by the United States of America \r\nagainst Cuba”. \r\n We Cubans feel proud of our work. Although this \r\neconomic warfare causes hardships, the fact that has \r\nnot taken a toll on human lives or managed to cause \r\nwidespread and traumatic harm to our people is thanks \r\nto the efforts and sacrifices made by Cubans and the \r\nwillingness and determination of its Government. \r\n Although the economic persecution constitutes \r\nthe main obstacle hindering the development of our \r\ncountry and the improvement of the living standards of \r\nour people, Cuba shows undeniable results in the \r\neradication of poverty and hunger; in health and \r\neducation indices, which serve as a global point of \r\nreference; the promotion of gender equality; the \r\nfreedom and equal well-being of Cubans; social \r\nconsensus; the democratic participation of citizens in \r\nthe country’s decisions; the reversal of environmental \r\ndegradation and the development of international \r\ncooperation with about 100 countries of the third \r\nworld. \r\n A few weeks ago Cuba was able to declare in this \r\nHall that it had largely and exceptionally complied \r\nwith the Millennium Development Goals. Such results \r\nare still a utopia for a large segment of the population \r\non this planet. \r\n We Cubans face our historical destiny with \r\noptimism, commitment and creativity. We are inspired \r\nby the feelings of peace, justice and solidarity that \r\nhave characterized our people and the friendship that \r\nthe whole world feels for our free and rebellious island. \r\nCuba will continue to be ready to enter into peaceful \r\nand respectful relations with the United States, as it has \r\nwith the overwhelming majority of the international \r\ncommunity and the entire hemisphere. \r\n Cuba will never cease to denounce the blockade \r\nor to demand its people’s legitimate right to live and \r\nwork for its socio economic development under \r\nconditions of equality, in cooperation with the rest of \r\nthe nations and without economic siege or external \r\npressures. \r\n Cuba expresses its gratitude to the international \r\ncommunity for its firm solidarity with our people, \r\nconvinced that, someday, justice will be served and \r\nthat this draft resolution will then no longer be \r\nnecessary. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): We \r\nhave heard the last speaker in the debate on this item. \r\nWe shall now proceed to consider draft resolution \r\nA/65/L.3. \r\n In that connection, I have two requests to speak \r\nin explanation of vote before the vote. Before giving \r\nthe floor to the speakers in explanation of vote before \r\nthe vote, may I remind delegations that explanations of \r\nvote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by \r\ndelegations from their seats. \r\n Mr. Godard (United States of America): The \r\nUnited States of America, like most Member States, is \r\nfirmly committed to supporting the desire of the Cuban \r\npeople to freely determine their country’s future. \r\n The United States of America, like all Member \r\nStates, has the sovereign right to conduct its economic \r\nrelationships with other countries as it sees fit. The \r\nUnited States economic relationship with Cuba is a \r\nbilateral issue and part of a broader set of relations \r\nmeant to encourage a more open environment in Cuba \r\nand increased respect for human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms. Respect for those rights and \r\nfreedoms are part of this Organization’s core values. \r\nWe should not lose sight of that in a debate mired in \r\nthe rhetorical arguments of the past and focused on \r\ntactical differences — a debate that does nothing to \r\nhelp the Cuban people. \r\n My delegation regrets that the delegation from \r\nCuba continues, year after year, to inappropriately and \r\nincorrectly label United States trade restrictions on \r\nCuba as an act of genocide. Such an egregious misuse \r\nof the term diminishes the real suffering of victims of \r\ngenocide elsewhere in the world. Additionally, those \r\nwho charge the United States sanctions as being the \r\ncause of deprivation among the Cuban people should \r\nbe reminded that the United States holds no restriction \r\non humanitarian aid to Cuba and remains Cuba’s \r\nlargest provider of food. \r\n The United States sold $533 million in \r\nagricultural products, medical devices, medicine and \r\nwood to Cuba in 2009. In agricultural products alone, \r\nthe United States exported $526 million in goods to \r\nCuba. Once again, in 2009, Cuba reported that the \r\nUnited States was its fifth largest trading partner. The \r\nUnited States in 2009 also authorized $237 million in \r\nprivate humanitarian assistance in the form of gift \r\nparcels filled with food and other basic necessities, \r\n A/65/PV.36\r\n \r\n21 10-60252 \r\n \r\nnon-agricultural humanitarian donations and medical \r\ndonations. \r\n It is equally important to note that the United \r\nStates has demonstrated that we are prepared to engage \r\nthe Government of Cuba on issues that affect the \r\nsecurity and well-being of both our peoples. In April \r\n2009, President Obama stated that the United States \r\nseeks a new beginning with Cuba, but there is a longer \r\njourney that must be travelled to overcome the decades \r\nof mistrust. Over the past 21 months, the United States \r\nhas begun to make progress on the vision that the \r\nPresident has outlined. We lifted restrictions on family \r\nvisits and remittances and expanded the amounts of \r\nhumanitarian items that the American people can \r\ndonate to individuals in Cuba. The United States has \r\nenhanced the ability of United States \r\ntelecommunication companies to pursue agreements to \r\nprovide service to Cuba and has made it easier for \r\nUnited States agricultural producers to pursue contracts \r\nwith Cuban buyers. Furthermore, we have resumed \r\nbilateral discussions on migration, we have initiated \r\ntalks to re establish direct mail service between the \r\nUnited States and Cuba, and we have increased artistic \r\nand cultural exchanges between our countries, \r\nconsistent with our long-standing support for freedom \r\nof expression. In the wake of the tragic earthquake in \r\nHaiti, the United States coordinated with Cuba to \r\naddress the medical needs of Haitians as part of the \r\ninternational relief efforts there. \r\n President Obama has stated publicly that the \r\nrelease of political prisoners and economic reforms are \r\npositive steps for the Cuban people. The United States \r\nhopes to see the fulfilment of those promises soon, as \r\nwell as a broader opening by the Cuban Government \r\nsignalling its willingness to engage constructively with \r\nits own people. However, it is the view of the United \r\nStates that a new era in United States-Cuban relations \r\ncannot be fully realized until the Cuban people enjoy \r\nthe internationally recognized political and economic \r\nfreedoms that this body has done so much to defend in \r\nother countries around the world. \r\n My delegation will vote against draft resolution \r\nA/65/L.3. Indeed, the United States believes that it is \r\nhigh time for this body to focus its energies on \r\nsupporting the Cuban people in their quest to freely \r\ndecide their own future and move beyond the rhetorical \r\nposturing that this draft resolution represents. \r\n Mrs. Rubiales de Chamorro (Nicaragua) (spoke \r\nin Spanish): Nicaragua will explain why it is going to \r\nvote in favour of draft resolution A/65/L.3, presented \r\nby comrade Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Cuba, whom we thank for having \r\nupdated the General Assembly on the harm and damage \r\nthat President Barack Obama’s Administration \r\ncontinues to inflict on the people of Cuba with the \r\nmost criminal blockade that has existed in the history \r\nof humankind. \r\n Before I do that, I wish to express our eternal \r\ngratitude to the people and Government of Cuba for \r\ntheir unconditional solidarity and for their most recent \r\nnoble initiative of solidarity that was carried out in my \r\ncountry, Nicaragua. The President of our country has \r\njust awarded the Rubén Darío order of cultural \r\nindependence to the Todos con Voz Cuban medical \r\nbrigade, which completed the historic mission of \r\ndiagnosing and recording all Nicaraguan brothers and \r\nsisters with disabilities throughout our national \r\nterritory. I quote the words of Commander Daniel \r\nOrtega Saavedra, President of Nicaragua, when he \r\nmade the award: \r\n “To the Todos con Voz medical brigade, \r\nexemplary exponents of the model of scientific \r\ndevelopment and public health, humanism and \r\nsolidarity of Fidel and Raúl’s Cuba, recognized as \r\none of the best in the world and the pride of all \r\nthe world’s revolutionaries.” \r\n The people and Governments represented here \r\nthink of Cuba as a kindred island, people and \r\nGovernment, and recognize Cuba for its heroism, \r\nsolidarity, humanism, generosity and devotion when \r\nfaced with other people’s suffering, for its readiness to \r\nlend a friendly hand when we need help. That is why \r\nwe will once again today express ourselves to demand \r\nthat the country that blockades Cuba, prevents its \r\ndevelopment and threatens those that go near it — the \r\ncountry which from the very first day of the Cuban \r\nrevolution initiated aggression against it — cease this \r\nabsurd and inhuman policy. \r\n We meet once again today in the General \r\nAssembly to bring together the voices of the \r\ninternational community and to demand, for the \r\nnineteenth consecutive time, that the Government of \r\nthe United States put an end to this criminal and \r\ninhuman blockade against the heroic generous people \r\nand Government of Cuba. \r\nA/65/PV.36  \r\n \r\n10-60252 22 \r\n \r\n Any country would understand this, simply from \r\nreading the Secretary-General’s report (A/65/83) on the \r\nreplies of Governments and bodies of the United \r\nNations system. All but one of us understands. Once \r\nagain, the Government of the United States will be \r\nisolated in the international community. Once again, \r\nthe world will stand by Cuba and its people in defence \r\nof its sovereignty and its unstoppable revolution and in \r\ndemanding an end to the inhuman blockade. Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean defend Cuba with a single \r\nvoice. We have closed ranks with Cuba so that the \r\nGovernment of the United States will reconsider and \r\ncorrect its historical error, which is an anachronism in \r\nour region. \r\n Not only does the United States continue to \r\nignore the will of the General Assembly; it has \r\ntightened the main elements of the embargo against \r\nCuba. That is reflected in the increase in economic \r\nsanctions and the targeting of Cuban business activity \r\nand financial transactions. We can see how the \r\nchokehold policy on Cuba is being carried out to the \r\nletter by the new Obama Administration, just as \r\nprevious Administrations have done. Where is the \r\nchange of which so much mention was made during the \r\ncampaign? There has been no change at all. This \r\nAdministration is increasingly isolated in its obstinate \r\nimperial policy. \r\n We have just heard the words of our colleague the \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba, representing his \r\nworthy people and Government. He has again told us \r\nthat the blockade continues to be the major obstacle to \r\nthe economic and social development of his country, \r\nand that its full effects on the Cuban economy is \r\napproximately $751,363,000,000. \r\n In addition to its criminal blockade, the United \r\nStates continues its policy of State terrorism by \r\nsupporting admitted terrorists who freely move through \r\nthe cities of the United States, planning and carrying \r\nout terrorist actions against the people and the \r\nGovernment of Cuba. At the same time, the United \r\nStates is assailing freedom and human rights by \r\ninsisting on keeping in its jails five heroic Cuban \r\npatriots whose only crime was to defend their \r\nmotherland from terrorists acts committed from the \r\nterritory of the United States of America. We demand \r\nthe immediate release of these five Cuban anti terrorist \r\nheroes. To them and their families we express our \r\nrespect and admiration on their heroic struggle against \r\nterrorists who try to destroy Cuba and its unstoppable \r\nsocialist revolution. \r\n With our vote, we shall once again express our \r\nemphatic condemnation of the blockade against Cuba \r\nand of all coercive measures of a unilateral nature and \r\nwith extraterritorial impact that contradict international \r\nlaw and the accepted norms of free trade. Such \r\npractices pose a grave threat to multilateralism. We \r\nwill also be condemning the use of coercive unilateral \r\nmeasures, such as illegal sanctions against developing \r\ncountries aimed at preventing them from exercising \r\ntheir right to determine their own political, economic \r\nand social systems. \r\n Nicaragua will vote in favour of draft resolution \r\nA/65/L.3. We call on the community of nations to once \r\nagain stand by Cuba by voting in favour, thereby \r\nsending a message of peace, solidarity, respect for the \r\nCharter of the Organization and for non-interference \r\nand non-intervention and, of course, for an immediate \r\nand unilateral halt to the cruel and inhuman blockade. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): We \r\nhave heard the last speaker in explanation of vote \r\nbefore the voting. \r\n The Assembly will now take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/65/L.3. A recorded vote has been \r\nrequested. \r\n A recorded vote was taken. \r\nIn favour: \r\n Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Andorra, Angola, \r\nAntigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Armenia, \r\nAustralia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Bahrain, \r\nBangladesh, Barbados, Belarus, Belgium, Belize, \r\nBenin, Bhutan, Bolivia (Plurinational State of), \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Brazil, \r\nBrunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, \r\nBurundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Canada, Cape \r\nVerde, Central African Republic, Chad, Chile, \r\nChina, Colombia, Comoros, Congo, Costa Rica, \r\nCôte d’Ivoire, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus, Czech \r\nRepublic, Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea, Democratic Republic of the Congo, \r\nDenmark, Djibouti, Dominica, Dominican \r\nRepublic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, \r\nEquatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Estonia, Ethiopia, \r\nFiji, Finland, France, Gabon, Gambia, Georgia, \r\nGermany, Ghana, Greece, Grenada, Guatemala, \r\nGuinea, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, \r\n A/65/PV.36\r\n \r\n23 10-60252 \r\n \r\nHungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic \r\nRepublic of), Iraq, Ireland, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, \r\nJordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kiribati, Kuwait, \r\nKyrgyzstan, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, \r\nLatvia, Lebanon, Lesotho, Liberia, Libyan Arab \r\nJamahiriya, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, \r\nLuxembourg, Madagascar, Malawi, Malaysia, \r\nMaldives, Mali, Malta, Mauritania, Mauritius, \r\nMexico, Monaco, Mongolia, Montenegro, \r\nMorocco, Mozambique, Myanmar, Namibia, \r\nNauru, Nepal, Netherlands, New Zealand, \r\nNicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Norway, Oman, \r\nPakistan, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, \r\nPeru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, \r\nRepublic of Korea, Republic of Moldova, \r\nRomania, Russian Federation, Rwanda, Saint \r\nKitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and \r\nthe Grenadines, Samoa, San Marino, Sao Tome \r\nand Principe, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Serbia, \r\nSeychelles, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Slovakia, \r\nSlovenia, Solomon Islands, Somalia, South \r\nAfrica, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Suriname, \r\nSwaziland, Sweden, Switzerland, Syrian Arab \r\nRepublic, Tajikistan, Thailand, the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Timor-Leste, \r\nTogo, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, \r\nTurkey, Turkmenistan, Tuvalu, Uganda, Ukraine, \r\nUnited Arab Emirates, United Kingdom of Great \r\nBritain and Northern Ireland, United Republic of \r\nTanzania, Uruguay, Uzbekistan, Vanuatu, \r\nVenezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), Viet Nam, \r\nYemen, Zambia, Zimbabwe \r\nAgainst: \r\n Israel, United States of America \r\nAbstaining: \r\n Marshall Islands, Micronesia (Federated States \r\nof), Palau \r\n  Draft resolution A/65/L.3 was adopted by \r\n187 votes to 2, with 3 abstentions (resolution \r\n65/6). \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I shall \r\nnow call on those representatives who wish to explain \r\ntheir votes. May I remind delegations that explanations \r\nof vote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made \r\nby delegations from their seats. \r\n Mr. Grauls (Belgium): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the European Union (EU). \r\n The European Union believes that the United \r\nStates trade policy towards Cuba is fundamentally a \r\nbilateral issue. However, American legislation such as \r\nthe Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 and the Helms-\r\nBurton Act of 1996 has extended the effects of the \r\nUnited States embargo to third-party countries. As a \r\nmatter of principle, the European Union has firmly and \r\ncontinuously opposed such extraterritorial measures. \r\n While recognizing the decision by the United \r\nStates Government to lift restrictions on remittances \r\nand family travel to Cuba, we cannot accept that \r\nunilaterally imposed measures impede our economic \r\nand commercial relations with Cuba. To address this \r\nproblem, the European Union Council of Ministers \r\nadopted, in November 1996, a regulation and a joint \r\naction to protect the interests of natural or legal \r\npersons residing in Europe against the consequences of \r\nthese Acts. Furthermore, at the May 1998 European \r\nUnion-United States Summit held in London, a \r\npackage was agreed that also sought to alleviate the \r\nproblems with extraterritorial legislation. It covered \r\nwaivers to titles III and IV of the Helms-Burton Act, a \r\ncommitment by the United States Government to resist \r\nfuture extraterritorial legislation of that kind, and an \r\nunderstanding regarding disciplines for the \r\nstrengthening of investment protection. The European \r\nUnion reiterates its call on the United States to \r\nimplement this agreement. \r\n The European Union’s policy towards Cuba was \r\nset out in a common position in 1996. Reaffirming the \r\nvalidity of this common position, the European Union, \r\nin June 2008, lifted the restricted measures imposed on \r\nCuba in 2003. The dialogue with the authorities in \r\nHavana was resumed without preconditions and on the \r\nbasis of reciprocity and non-discrimination. Full \r\npolitical dialogue ministerial sessions have been held \r\nwith the Cuban Government to address issues of \r\ncommon interest, including human rights, a question at \r\nthe core of relations with all third countries, including \r\nCuba. \r\n The European Union reaffirms its determination \r\nto pursue a results-oriented comprehensive dialogue \r\nwith the Cuban authorities as well as with \r\nrepresentatives of civil society and peaceful \r\npro-democracy opposition, in accordance with EU \r\npolicies. The European Union reiterates the right of \r\nCuban citizens to make decisions independently about \r\ntheir future. \r\nA/65/PV.36  \r\n \r\n10-60252 24 \r\n \r\n The European Union is encouraged by the \r\nongoing release of 52 political prisoners from the \r\ngroup imprisoned in 2003, and reiterates its call to the \r\nCuban Government to unconditionally release all \r\npolitical prisoners. The European Union also reiterates \r\nits call on the Cuban Government to fully grant its \r\ncitizens internationally recognized civil, political and \r\neconomic rights and freedoms, including the freedom \r\nof expression and free access to information, to ratify \r\nthe International Covenant on Civil and Political \r\nRights and the International Covenant on Economic, \r\nSocial and Cultural Rights, and, following the visit of \r\nthe United Nations Special Rapporteur on the right to \r\nfood, to extend invitations to other rapporteurs to visit \r\nCuba. \r\n The existing restrictions on rights and freedoms \r\nundermine and offset Cuban achievements in health \r\ncare and education. Similarly, domestic Cuban \r\neconomic policy seriously hampers its own economic \r\ndevelopment. In this context, the European Union \r\nlooks forward to the implementation of the economic \r\nreforms announced by the Cuban Government, and \r\nexpresses its hope that these reforms will be extended \r\nand implemented in a manner that will address the key \r\nconcerns of the Cuban population. \r\n The economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nimposed by the United States contributes to the \r\neconomic problems in Cuba, negatively affecting the \r\nliving standards of the Cuban people. The European \r\nUnion therefore believes that the lifting of the United \r\nStates embargo would open up the Cuban economy to \r\nthe benefit of the Cuban people. \r\n We again express our rejection of all unilateral \r\nmeasures directed against Cuba that are contrary to \r\ncommonly accepted rules of international trade. The \r\nEuropean Union urges the Cuban authorities to bring \r\nabout real improvements in all the areas I have \r\nmentioned. In spite of continued concerns and \r\ncriticisms about the human rights situation in Cuba, the \r\nEuropean Union unanimously voted in favour of \r\nresolution 65/6. \r\n Mr. Cancela (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): As in \r\nprevious years, Uruguay voted in favour of the draft \r\nresolution presented by the delegation of Cuba \r\n(A/65/L.3), adopted as resolution 65/6, since we \r\nconsider that the embargo against that country is \r\ncounter to the purposes and principles of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations and that it contravenes the rules of \r\ninternational law, in particular norms that regulate \r\ninternational trade and those that are binding on the \r\nmembers of the World Trade Organization. \r\n The position of Uruguay is in keeping with the \r\nbroader context of defending multilateralism, \r\nnon-intervention and the peaceful solution of disputes, \r\nwhich are the fundamental principles of our diplomacy. \r\nThe Eastern Republic of Uruguay has expressed on \r\nnumerous occasions, and would like to take this \r\nopportunity to reiterate, that we are against the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial blockade that has \r\nbeen maintained against Cuba, which has affected the \r\nwell-being of the Cuban people. \r\n As a matter of principle, Uruguay rejects and \r\ndoes not recognize in its national legislation the \r\nextraterritorial application of the domestic legislation \r\nof other States. In this regard, we condemn the \r\napplication of unilateral coercive measures by the \r\nUnited States against Cuba. These measures constitute \r\na form of pressure that is an obstacle to dialogue. \r\n In voting in favour of this resolution, Uruguay \r\nwould like to reiterate its commitment to \r\nmultilateralism as a legitimate instrument to resolve \r\ndisputes between States and as an effective mechanism \r\nin promoting international cooperation, human rights, \r\nsecurity and mutual understanding between peoples. \r\n Mr. Solón (Plurinational State of Bolivia) (spoke \r\nin Spanish): The blockade against Cuba has failed. \r\nAlmost 50 years after the imposition of that inhuman \r\nsiege, far from having isolated the small island and its \r\nheroic people, the blockade has in fact triggered the \r\nbroadest possible show of international solidarity. The \r\nclearest example of that solidarity was the General \r\nAssembly’s adoption, for the nineteenth time, of a \r\nresolution on this subject. \r\n One hundred and eighty-seven countries — that \r\nis, 97.39 per cent of the Member States of the \r\nOrganization — have rejected the blockade imposed by \r\nthe forces of imperialism against a nation that had the \r\ncourage to speak with its own sovereign voice. The \r\nresolution that has been adopted today (resolution \r\n65/6) is a recognition of the dignity, resolve and \r\nresistance of a nation, that, in the face of adversity, has \r\nnot fallen to its knees.  \r\n The United States, which claims to be the \r\ndefender of liberty, violates that very fundamental \r\nprinciple itself through this blockade. The only thing \r\n A/65/PV.36\r\n \r\n25 10-60252 \r\n \r\nthat this blockade does is violate the human rights of \r\nthe people of Cuba and generate economic losses that \r\nhave already exceeded $750 billion. \r\n It is unacceptable to defend the extraterritorial \r\napplication of a legal standard sanctioned by a State in \r\norder to govern another without the approval of that \r\nState, as is the case with the well-known Helms-Burton \r\nAct. The United States Congress cannot regulate the \r\npolitical life of another sovereign State. That is in \r\nabsolute contravention of every founding principle of \r\nthe United Nations. \r\n In the debate preceding the adoption of the \r\nresolution, we were struck by the fact that the \r\nrepresentative of the United States said that the \r\nblockade will end when the Cuban people enjoy the \r\nfreedoms that the Government of the United States \r\ndeems appropriate according to its own vision. This is \r\na confession by the Government of the United States \r\nthat it is using the blockade to impose its hegemonic \r\nvision on the Cuban people. No country has the right to \r\nimpose its own vision or principles on another country. \r\nWe all have an obligation to respect the sovereignty of \r\nall the Member States of the United Nations. \r\n Cuba’s response in the face of the imperialist \r\nblockade is an example for all humankind. Cuba has \r\nreacted by showing solidarity to every country of the \r\nworld that has requested it. Its doctors and teachers \r\nhave helped to save thousands from illiteracy, darkness \r\nand death in every region of the world. The most recent \r\nexample of that solidarity is the widescale support it \r\nprovided to the kindred Republic of Haiti. \r\n The greatest success of the blockade against Cuba \r\nhas been to isolate the United States, as we note here \r\ntoday in the General Assembly. The arrogance and the \r\nimposition of sanctions by a reactionary and imperialist \r\nminority in the United States will never defeat the \r\ncountries of the world that have taken Cuba into their \r\nhearts. \r\n Mr. Gaspar Martins (Angola): As in previous \r\nyears, Angola voted in favour of resolution 65/6, which \r\nwas presented to the Assembly by Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla of Cuba, whose \r\npresence in the Assembly today we welcome. \r\n In his statement, he very vividly and clearly \r\ndescribed to us the dramatic impact of the sanctions on \r\nthe Cuban population. The result of the vote is very \r\neloquent. I am pleased to say that Angola joins the \r\ninternational community once again in condemning the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed \r\nby the United States of America against Cuba. We \r\nappeal for its end. The embargo, which has lasted for \r\nhalf a century, is a flagrant and systematic violation of \r\nthe human rights of the Cuban people. \r\n For consecutive years, the General Assembly has \r\noverwhelmingly adopted resolutions urging all \r\ncountries, in compliance with the United Nations \r\nCharter and the principles of international law, to \r\nretract all laws and measures with extraterritorial \r\neffects that compromise the sovereignty of other States, \r\nundermine the legitimate rights and interests of entities \r\nand persons under the jurisdiction of those States and \r\naffect their freedom of trade and navigation. \r\nRegrettably, however, the long-term economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States of America against Cuba is still in place, \r\nin violation of those resolutions and in blatant violation \r\nof the principles of the United Nations Charter and the \r\nnorms of international law. The General Assembly has \r\ntoday adopted a resolution — a result that is really very \r\nclear. \r\n The changes adopted by the United States \r\nAdministration in relation to a few aspects of the \r\nembargo have neither been relevant nor sufficient to \r\nlessen the scope of the economic and social problems \r\nresulting from the embargo. There is a need to continue \r\nto move towards the lifting of the embargo. We \r\nencourage the United States Government to pursue this \r\nin a positive direction. We look forward to the day \r\nwhen the General Assembly will no longer need to \r\ninclude this item on its agenda. \r\n By adhering to the principles enshrined in the \r\nUnited Nations Charter and by fulfilling all the \r\npertinent resolutions adopted by the General Assembly, \r\nwe reaffirm our commitment to the norms of \r\ninternational law by supporting the need to eliminate \r\ncoercive economic measures as a means of political \r\nand economic persuasion. \r\n \r\nProgramme of work \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nshould like to inform members that, at 10 a.m. in this \r\nHall on Friday, 29 October, the General Assembly will \r\nconsider draft resolution A/65/L.7, entitled “Review of \r\nthe United Nations peacebuilding architecture”, jointly \r\nunder agenda item 13, entitled, “Integrated and \r\nA/65/PV.36  \r\n \r\n10-60252 26 \r\n \r\ncoordinated implementation of and follow-up to the \r\noutcomes of the major United Nations conferences and \r\nsummits in the economic, social and related fields”, \r\nand agenda item 115, entitled “Follow-up to the \r\noutcome of the Millennium Summit”. I wish to remind \r\nmembers that, as scheduled, we will hold the joint \r\ndebate on those items on Tuesday, 23 November. \r\n  The meeting rose at 1 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\n"
