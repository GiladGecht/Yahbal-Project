(Switzerland) \r\n \r\n \r\n  In the absence of the President, Mr. Carrión-Mena \r\n(Ecuador), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 3 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 41 (continued) \r\n \r\nNecessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/65/83) \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/65/L.3) \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): \r\nMembers will recall that, at the 36th plenary meeting, \r\nthe Assembly adopted draft resolution A/65/L.3 as \r\nresolution 65/6. We will now continue with the list of \r\nspeakers in explanation of the vote. \r\n Before giving the floor to the speakers in \r\nexplanation of vote, I remind delegations that \r\nexplanations of vote are limited to a maximum of \r\n10 minutes and should be made by delegations from \r\ntheir seats. \r\n Mr. Minn (Myanmar): Given the similar impacts \r\nfelt because of its own social and political system and \r\nits own path of development, Myanmar fully \r\nsympathizes with the Cuban people and understands \r\nthe extent of the hardship and suffering caused by the \r\nembargo against them, in particular the elderly, women \r\nand children. The will of the international community \r\nhas been clearly expressed every year with the \r\nadoption by an overwhelming majority of States of \r\nresolutions calling for an end to the embargo. My \r\ndelegation believes that it is the legitimate right of each \r\nnation to choose its own social and political systems \r\nand its own path of development. The embargo against \r\nCuba is contrary not only to the provisions of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, but also to international \r\nlaw. For those reasons, Myanmar voted in favour, as it \r\nhas in previous years, of the resolution entitled \r\n“Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba”. \r\n Mr. Mac-Donald (Suriname): I thank you, Sir, \r\nfor allowing me to speak in explanation of vote under \r\nagenda item 41, “Necessity of ending the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States of America against Cuba”. \r\n Suriname has always been against this embargo \r\nand has therefore fully supported and voted in favour \r\nof successive General Assembly resolutions regarding \r\nthis matter. Suriname would like to reiterate once again \r\nits position on this crucial issue. \r\n The Government of the Republic of Suriname \r\nremains committed to the purposes and principles \r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and to \r\nupholding the principles of international law. In this \r\nregard, the unilateral enforcement of the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States against Cuba is contrary to the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations and international law. \r\n Likewise, the continuation for another year of the \r\ntrade embargo against Cuba, which will remain in force \r\nA/65/PV.37  \r\n \r\n10-60583 2 \r\n \r\nuntil 14 September 2011, remains cause for great \r\nconcern against the background of the deepening \r\nimpact of the current global economic and financial \r\ncrisis, which will further aggravate the hardships of the \r\npeople of Cuba. \r\n Suriname therefore reiterates its call for an end to \r\nthe embargo, which is contrary to international law and \r\nnegatively affects regional cooperation in the \r\nCaribbean region. \r\n Finally, my delegation would also like to align \r\nitself with the statements delivered this morning by the \r\nrepresentative of Yemen on behalf of the Group of 77 \r\nand China, the Permanent Representative of Egypt on \r\nbehalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, and the \r\nPermanent Representative of the Bahamas on behalf of \r\nthe Caribbean Community. \r\n Mr. Ovsyanko (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): \r\nToday, the delegation of Belarus, along with 186 other \r\nStates Members of the United Nations, voted in support \r\nof resolution 65/6, on the necessity of ending the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo against \r\nCuba. The Republic of Belarus has consistently \r\ncondemned the use of unilateral economic measures as \r\na means of exerting political and economic pressure on \r\ndeveloping countries. It believes that they run counter \r\nto the fundamental principles of international law and \r\nthe purposes and principles of the United Nations \r\nCharter and other international legal instruments. \r\n We affirm the inalienable right of every State to \r\ndecide on its own model of development and believe \r\nthat any unilateral attempt by an individual State to \r\nchange the internal political system of another State by \r\nuse of military, political, economic or other pressure is \r\ninadmissible. \r\n Barely a month ago, the leaders of the Member \r\nStates discussed in this very Hall the measures that \r\nneeded to be taken by the international community in \r\norder to fulfil their obligations under the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and to guarantee a decent standard \r\nof living for the citizens of their countries. We are \r\nconvinced that the application of coercive economic \r\nmeasures is the type of instrument that creates serious \r\nobstacles to the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, impairs the vital interests of the \r\npeople of a country subjected to sanctions, and violates \r\nthe rights of its peoples to a dignified existence, thus \r\ncontributing to the emergence of political instability \r\nand the outbreak of conflicts. \r\n We consider that, in the current conditions and as \r\na result of the continued consequences of the world \r\nfinancial and economic crisis, the use of unilateral \r\nsanctions and coercive measures is especially \r\ninappropriate. This is not the first time that we have \r\nheard appeals from the rostrum of the General \r\nAssembly for an end to the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo against Cuba. Today, we have \r\nadopted the nineteenth successive General Assembly \r\nresolution on this question. We express the hope that \r\nour collective voice will be heard this time. \r\n Mr. Bart (Saint Kitts and Nevis): Saint Kitts and \r\nNevis would like to add its voice in support of agenda \r\nitem 41 on the necessity of ending the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo against Cuba and to \r\ngive its reasons for voting in favour of resolution 65/6. \r\nThis is an extremely important debate that speaks to \r\nthe very core of international law, sovereignty, \r\nnon-intervention and the strengthened role of the \r\nUnited Nations in international affairs. \r\n Saint Kitts and Nevis has very good relations \r\nwith the United States of America. That country \r\nremains one of our closest and strongest partners. We \r\nrespect the role that the United States of America has \r\nplayed in international relations and in the \r\nestablishment and promotion of this body. The United \r\nStates of America is a global leader and we \r\nacknowledge and remain grateful for its role in \r\ninternational affairs. \r\n However, my delegation associates itself with the \r\nstatements made by the representative of the Arab \r\nRepublic of Egypt on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement, the representative of Republic of Yemen on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China, and the \r\nPermanent Representative of the Commonwealth of the \r\nBahamas on behalf of the Caribbean Community. \r\n Saint Kitts and Nevis, in its contribution to the \r\nSecretary-General’s report (A/65/83) on this matter, \r\nadvised that we do not support or apply any laws or \r\nmeasures that affect the free flow of international \r\ntrade. We also advised that we do not apply laws with \r\nextraterritorial effect that impinge on the sovereignty \r\nof other States and the legitimate interests of entities or \r\npersons under their jurisdiction. \r\n This is a principled position that extends to all \r\nStates members of this body. Saint Kitts and Nevis \r\ntherefore feels very strongly about bringing to a close \r\nthe embargo imposed on Cuba. Cuba is one of the \r\n A/65/PV.37\r\n \r\n3 10-60583 \r\n \r\nclosest allies of Saint Kitts and Nevis. That country is a \r\npan Caribbean partner and has aided in the \r\ndevelopment of the health-care system and other areas \r\nin Saint Kitts and Nevis. There is much that the \r\ninternational community has benefited and can benefit \r\nfrom in cooperating with Cuba, just as Saint Kitts and \r\nNevis has benefited. \r\n We see this embargo as a burden on our brothers \r\nand sisters in Cuba. The negative impact on the \r\neconomy of that small island developing State is quite \r\nprofound and unfair to the people of Cuba. The \r\ninternational community remains in the grip of a global \r\nrecession, and while many of us rely on a partnership \r\nwith other countries to recover, Cuba remains stunned \r\nby the embargo. This goes against the very principles \r\nof partnership for which this United Nations stands. \r\n The fact that the majority of Member States \r\ntraditionally vote in favour of the draft resolution \r\nsignifies that the overriding sentiment is that the \r\nembargo is wrong. We implore all Member States to \r\nrespect the sanctity of the General Assembly and the \r\ndecisions it makes. Failure to do so undermines the \r\nfunctioning of the United Nations system. \r\n It is my delegation’s hope that the two \r\ncountries — Cuba and the United States of America — \r\ncan improve their relationships and embark upon a \r\nprocess of partnership and cooperation. There is much \r\nthat we can learn from each other, but the embargo \r\nremains an impediment to that process. That is why \r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis supports resolution 65/6 and \r\nvoted in favour of it. We reiterate our call on both \r\ncountries to find common ground so that the entire \r\ninternational community can move on from this \r\nimpasse. \r\n Mr. Luangmuninthone (Lao People’s \r\nDemocratic Republic): The Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic associates itself with the statements made by \r\nthe representative of Yemen on behalf of the Group of \r\n77 and China and by the representative of Egypt on \r\nbehalf of the Non-Aligned Movement. \r\n The Lao People’s Democratic Republic reiterates \r\nits opposition to the continued unilateral imposition of \r\nthe economic, commercial and financial embargo upon \r\nthe Republic of Cuba by the Government of the United \r\nStates of America. The embargo imposed on Cuba not \r\nonly runs counter to the purposes and principles \r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, but also \r\nviolates the fundamental principle of the sovereignty, \r\nequality and right to development of the peoples of all \r\nnations. Furthermore, it continues to cause untold \r\nsuffering and hardship to the Cuban people and to \r\nhinder Cuba’s socio economic progress and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n The adoption of the relevant resolution for the \r\nnineteenth consecutive year, with the overwhelming \r\nsupport of the General Assembly, indicates the \r\ninternational community’s rejection of unilateral \r\ncoercive economic measures in general and the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo against \r\nCuba in particular. The resolution we have just adopted \r\nonce again confirms the friendship and solidarity of the \r\ninternational community with the Cuban people and the \r\ncall for the immediate and unconditional lifting of the \r\nembargo against Cuba. \r\n The Lao People’s Democratic Republic believes \r\nin the importance of resolving the difference between \r\ncountries through peaceful dialogue and negotiation on \r\nthe basis of equality and mutual respect for \r\nsovereignty. In this spirit, the Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic reaffirms its continued support for the \r\nresolution of the General Assembly under this agenda \r\nitem and voted in favour of resolution 65/6. \r\n Mr. Sefue (United Republic of Tanzania): The \r\nGeneral Assembly has adopted successive resolutions \r\ncalling upon States to abide by the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and norms of international law, and \r\nurging them to refrain from enacting laws and taking \r\nmeasures that are damaging to the legitimate rights and \r\ninterests of other States. Regrettably, however, this just \r\nappeal by the international community has not always \r\nbeen heeded, and relevant resolutions of the General \r\nAssembly remain unimplemented. \r\n The economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nimposed by the United States against Cuba has created \r\nhuge difficulties for the Cuban people in their efforts to \r\nachieve economic and social development and carry \r\nout reform. It has seriously undermined the efforts of \r\nthe Cuban Government to eliminate poverty and \r\nimprove the living standards of its people, and it has \r\ninflicted enormous suffering on Cuban women and \r\nchildren. \r\n The embargo has also impeded the normal useful \r\neconomic and trade exchanges between Cuba and other \r\ncountries, and gravely encroached upon their legitimate \r\nrights and interests. In several areas, the embargo \r\nA/65/PV.37  \r\n \r\n10-60583 4 \r\n \r\nfrustrates efforts to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. \r\n Today, the Government of the United Republic of \r\nTanzania once again voted in favour of the resolution \r\nto end this embargo. This vote also expresses our \r\nsolidarity with like-minded members in opposing the \r\napplication of unilateral trade measures against Cuba, \r\nwith extraterritorial effects on the peoples and \r\neconomies of other States. Tanzania perceives these \r\nunilateral measures as being contrary to the spirit of \r\nmultilateralism and against the Charter of the United \r\nNations. \r\n Tanzania enjoys healthy and sound relations with \r\nthe people and Government of Cuba and cooperates \r\nwith that country in various socio economic \r\nendeavours, including capacity-building in health, \r\neducation and sports. Tanzania believes that \r\ncooperation between the two countries would flourish \r\nfurther if the unilaterally imposed blockade were lifted. \r\n Tanzania enjoys excellent relations and a robust \r\ndevelopment partnership with the United States of \r\nAmerica, and it is in that spirit that my Government \r\nonce again joins other Member States in urging the \r\nUnited States to listen to repeated and increasing calls \r\nby the international community to finally bring an end \r\nto the embargo and to fully adhere to the principles of \r\nmutual respect and non-interference in the internal \r\naffairs of its neighbour country. \r\n Mr. Abubaker (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): The imposition of sanctions and embargoes \r\nhas never been an appropriate solution to disputes \r\nbetween States. Such coercive measures send an \r\nunequivocal message to the world that the language of \r\nforce and hegemony governs relations between States. \r\nIt also reflects the authoritarianism and arrogance that \r\nhamper progress towards comprehensive peace and \r\nfriendly relations among States through the settlement \r\nof disputes and conflicts by peaceful means. \r\n The Charter of the United Nations stipulates the \r\nprinciple of the pacific settlement of disputes through \r\nnegotiation, conciliation, fact-finding, agreement or \r\nrecourse to international arbitration on the basis of the \r\nsovereign equality of States and the principle of \r\nnon-interference in the domestic affairs of States and \r\nfull respect for the sovereignty of States irrespective of \r\ntheir size, population or political and economic system. \r\nIn this regard, my delegation calls on all members of \r\nthe international community to comply with those \r\nprinciples. \r\n Having been subject to an economic blockade in \r\nthe past decade, my country is very well aware of the \r\nnefarious consequences of such coercive measures on \r\npeople, their health, education, development, and the \r\nfull enjoyment of their human rights. My country \r\ntherefore resolutely opposes unilateral measures \r\nimposed by States for political ends, and expresses its \r\ngrave concern at the persistence of certain States in \r\napplying coercive, economic, unilateral and \r\nextraterritorial sanctions that clearly run counter to the \r\nprinciples of international law, in particular those of \r\nthe sovereign equality of States and non-interference in \r\ntheir internal affairs. There is no doubt that the \r\napplication of such sanctions only aggravates human \r\nsuffering, exacerbates disputes and fosters hatred \r\namong peoples. We call on the United States to lift the \r\nblockade against Cuba and to promote good relations \r\nin the interests of both peoples. \r\n My delegation voted in favour of resolution 65/6, \r\ncalling for an end to the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba, because we feel that the \r\nimposition of sanctions and embargoes are not the best \r\nmeans of settling disputes between States. I hope that \r\nthe resolution will contribute to the peaceful settlement \r\nof the dispute between these two countries without \r\nresort to unilateral coercive economic measures. \r\n Mr. Ja’afari (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): The principles and purposes of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations provide for the right of countries to \r\nexercise their sovereignty within their own territories \r\nand to enjoy non-interference by others in their internal \r\naffairs. Since its inception in 1945, the United Nations \r\nhas adopted resolutions and decisions that emphasize \r\nthe sacrosanct nature of these purposes and principles. \r\nAll States Members should therefore respect the \r\nCharter, which represents the constitution of the \r\nOrganization and its pre eminent frame of reference. \r\n Because the unilateral embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States against Cuba and new measures aimed at \r\nreinforcing that embargo contravene the principles and \r\nrules of international law and international \r\nhumanitarian law — as well as rules governing \r\nrelations among countries, especially the principles of \r\nthe sovereign equality of States and of non-interference \r\nin their internal affairs, and the freedom of \r\n A/65/PV.37\r\n \r\n5 10-60583 \r\n \r\ninternational navigation and trade — the embargo is \r\ndefinitely illegal and runs counter to the norms of \r\nrelations among States. \r\n It also represents a challenge, unprecedented in \r\ninternational law, to the credibility of the legality of \r\nUnited States policies themselves. The embargo, which \r\nhas been imposed on Cuba for over 50 years, has \r\ncreated a unilateral legal precedent contrary to \r\ninternational law, which we reject. It has exposed Cuba \r\nto harmful economic, social and political effects and \r\ndeepened the suffering of the Cuban people, especially \r\nchildren and the elderly. \r\n The embargo puts the United States of America in \r\ndirect and unenviable opposition to the international \r\ncommunity. It has hindered the tireless efforts of the \r\nCuban people to achieve prosperity and progress and \r\ncontinues to harm the Cuban economy. Losses have \r\nexceeded tens of billions of dollars, not including \r\nindirect losses estimated to be in the tens of billions of \r\ndollars. The embargo also harms the social and cultural \r\ndevelopment of the Cuban people and deprives them of \r\nthe opportunities and benefits resulting from free trade. \r\nIt directly violates the basic freedoms and human rights \r\nof the Cuban people, including the right to life and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n The General Assembly has discussed this agenda \r\nitem for over 19 consecutive years and has adopted \r\nnumerous resolutions in that regard by overwhelming \r\nmajorities. However, regrettably, the economic, \r\nfinancial and commercial embargo against Cuba is still \r\nin effect. \r\n The support of 187 Member States for the \r\nresolution only emphasizes the near unanimous \r\ndetermination of the international community to put an \r\nend to the totally illegal embargo against Cuba. Resort \r\nto unjustified coercive economic measures against \r\nother countries, regardless of their political orientation, \r\nis unacceptable to the international community, which \r\nhas repeatedly rejected the unilateral embargo against \r\nCuba, now expanded under the national laws of the \r\nUnited States, including the domestic legislation \r\nknown as the Helms-Burton Act. That law has \r\nextraterritorial effect, prejudicing the sovereignty of \r\nother nations in their dealings with Cuba in \r\ncontravention of the principle of equal sovereignty of \r\nStates and the principles of international law. \r\n Given its mandate, the General Assembly is \r\ncalled on to take the measures necessary to put an end \r\nto the unilateral embargo, economic sanctions and \r\nother aggressive extraterritorial policies of the United \r\nStates — all in contravention of international law — \r\nagainst its direct neighbours and other countries that \r\nare geographically distant from the United States. \r\n In this respect, my delegation hopes that all \r\nembargoes imposed by the United States against Cuba \r\nand many other Member States — including my \r\ncountry, Syria — will be ended. We also hope that the \r\nvoice of the international community, as expressed \r\nthrough the General Assembly today, will be met with \r\nrespect by the United States and that it will come to \r\nenjoy the full support of that country’s legislative \r\nbodies. \r\n It is quite significant and worth noting that Israel \r\nvoted against resolution 65/6, in opposition to the vast \r\nmajority of the international community. Israel’s vote \r\nclearly highlights the validity of the international \r\ncommunity’s negative view and assessment of that \r\ncountry. Again, Israel has acted contrary to \r\ninternational law. It represents an isolated minority of \r\nthe international community. Israel’s vote has made \r\nmatters worse for the United States, whose \r\nAdministration has been seeking to return to the logic \r\nof dialogue between countries in conflict. \r\n It is high time that the rules of international law \r\nwere respected and that different points of view \r\nallowed to prevail. Israel’s vote for the continued \r\nunilateral embargo against Cuba clearly shows the \r\nworld that it is taking direct advantage of that embargo \r\nin a desperate attempt to justify its own embargo \r\nagainst Gaza, which has also been internationally \r\nrejected. Israel’s desperate embargo against Gaza, I \r\nrepeat, is not tolerated by the international community. \r\nAs a result, Israel feels compelled to support another \r\nequally illegal embargo — that imposed, contrary to \r\ninternational law, by the United States against Cuba. Is \r\nthere any position that could hurt the American \r\nposition more than the vote of Israel? \r\n Ms. Alsharif (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): My \r\ndelegation voted in favour of resolution 65/6, which \r\nwas introduced by Cuba in the presence of its Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs, whom we welcome and \r\ncongratulate on the overwhelming international support \r\nit enjoys. We confirm in this respect the purposes and \r\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter of the United \r\nNations, which enshrine equal sovereignty among \r\nStates, non-interference in their domestic affairs, and \r\nA/65/PV.37  \r\n \r\n10-60583 6 \r\n \r\nfreedom of navigation and trade, which are also \r\nguaranteed in a number of international legal \r\ninstruments. \r\n We express grave concern regarding the ongoing \r\nenactment, application and enforcement by certain \r\nStates of unilateral laws and extraterritorial measures \r\naffecting the sovereignty and interests of other States, \r\nresulting in negative repercussions that extend beyond \r\nnational borders, contravene the principles of \r\ninternational legitimacy, and hinder the freedom of \r\ninternational trade. We associate ourselves with the \r\nstatements made by the representative of Yemen on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China and by the \r\nrepresentative of Egypt on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement (NAM). \r\n The General Assembly is considering agenda \r\nitem 41 for the nineteenth consecutive year in the \r\ncontext of the increasing awareness of and broad \r\nrejection by Member States of the taking of unilateral, \r\ncoercive and extraterritorial economic measures. This \r\nwas clearly expressed in today’s voting results. \r\nOngoing support for the relevant resolution year after \r\nyear is a clear expression of the wide-scale rejection of \r\nthe unilateral embargo imposed on Cuba and its \r\nidentification as a means of political and economic \r\ncoercion. The embargo is a clear and flagrant violation \r\nof the international architecture and fundamental \r\nprinciples on which the United Nations Charter is \r\nbased, in addition to international law and the norms \r\nthat govern commercial, economic and financial \r\nrelations among countries. \r\n At the Second South Summit held in Doha in \r\nJune 2005, the imposition of laws and legislation of \r\nextraterritorial effect was rejected and all other \r\ncoercive economic measures, including sanctions \r\nimposed unilaterally on developing countries, were \r\ncondemned. At their fifteenth summit, held in Sharm el \r\nSheikh in July 2009, NAM heads of State and \r\nGovernment stressed their steadfast position on the \r\nnecessity of ending the economic, trade and financial \r\nembargo imposed on Cuba. At the 33rd meeting of the \r\nforeign ministers of the Group of 77 and China, held in \r\nSeptember 2009, the representatives of the Group \r\nrejected the imposition of transnational laws and \r\nsystems and condemned all forms of coercive \r\neconomic measures, including sanctions imposed \r\nunilaterally on developing countries. In addition, the \r\nfinal statement of the ministers for foreign affairs once \r\nagain expressed the urgent need to put an end to these \r\nmeasures immediately. \r\n The Government of the Sudan follows a policy \r\nbased on full respect for international law, the \r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter, sovereign \r\nequality among countries, and non-interference in the \r\ninternal affairs of others. In accordance with the \r\nSudan’s position based on the aforementioned \r\nprinciples, my delegation condemns the imposition of \r\neconomic and political sanctions on developing \r\ncountries because they constitute a flagrant violation of \r\nthe United Nations Charter and have a destructive \r\nimpact on the efforts of those countries to achieve \r\nsustainable development. \r\n In this respect, we confirm the Sudan’s \r\ncommitment to resolution 65/6 because the \r\nGovernment of National Unity does not enact or \r\nenforce laws or take any measures whose application \r\nbeyond national borders could affect the sovereignty of \r\nother States. Hence, the Government of the Sudan calls \r\nfor the abolition of laws that impose such measures. \r\n My delegation is opposed to unilateral sanctions \r\nthat are tied to political demands, such as those \r\nimposed by the United States on my country since \r\nNovember 1997. Such sanctions are a violation of the \r\nlegitimate right of the Sudanese Government and \r\npeople to choose their own political, economic and \r\nsocial systems. They damage the living standards of \r\nthe Sudanese people and obstruct the Government’s \r\nefforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, \r\neliminate poverty, and expand access to education, \r\nhealth care and the technologies necessary to \r\nenhancing agricultural and human development. Such \r\nunilateral economic sanctions have affected all regions \r\nof the Sudan. They have also exacerbated the \r\nhumanitarian situation and development in Darfur. \r\n Notwithstanding the economic and trade embargo \r\nimposed on my country, the Sudan is still strengthening \r\nits bilateral, economic and political relations with \r\ndeveloping countries, countries of the South and \r\ndeveloped countries, and this has enhanced its \r\neconomic and social development. \r\n Bilateral relations between the Sudan and Cuba \r\nwere strengthened following the joint ministerial \r\nmeeting between the two countries held in Havana in \r\nJune 2007 to promote cooperation in all fields. The \r\nassignment of the Permanent Representative of the \r\nRepublic of the Sudan to the United Nations as \r\n A/65/PV.37\r\n \r\n7 10-60583 \r\n \r\nAmbassador to Cuba in December 2007 was a step \r\nforward in the promotion of our relations. In addition, \r\nthe Sudan took part in the ministerial meeting of the \r\nNAM Coordinating Bureau in April 2009, which \r\nendorsed the necessity to end the economic embargo \r\nimposed on Cuba. \r\n My delegation calls for the establishment of a \r\nbetter life for every individual and a better world for \r\nall in which countries large and small coexist \r\npeacefully. Such peaceful coexistence requires the \r\ncommitment of all countries to the main principles of \r\nthe United Nations Charter and to managing their \r\nrelations in an appropriate manner. \r\n In this respect, we urge States that have applied \r\nlaws or taken unilateral measures that affect the \r\nsovereignty of other States to take the necessary action \r\nto abolish and annul them in order to preserve the right \r\nof other States to live in sovereignty, respect the \r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter and undertake \r\nmutual cooperation for the sake of peace, development \r\nand the welfare of all peoples of the world. \r\n Mr. Bui The Giang (Viet Nam): Viet Nam, as in \r\nall previous years, voted in favour of the resolution \r\nunder agenda item 41, introduced at today’s General \r\nAssembly meeting by the Cuban Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs, His Excellency Mr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla. \r\n Nineteen years have passed since the General \r\nAssembly adopted the first resolution demanding an \r\nend to the unilateral economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States against \r\nCuba. Throughout these 19 past years, the General \r\nAssembly has annually adopted a resolution on the \r\nnecessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States against \r\nCuba, with increasingly consensual support. This year, \r\nas last year, the resolution has enjoyed record support \r\nin its 19 year history, with 187 out of 192 Member \r\nStates voting in its favour. \r\n As a grave violation of international law, \r\nincluding international laws relating to the freedom of \r\ntrade and navigation, sovereign equality and \r\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of States, this \r\nembargo runs counter to universally recognized norms \r\ngoverning relations between sovereign countries \r\nregardless of their political systems and their choices \r\nof their paths of development, as well as to the \r\nfundamental principles and purposes enshrined in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. \r\n As such, this embargo, which has endured for \r\nhalf a century, has caused phenomenal financial and \r\nmaterial losses to the Cuban economy. It has, at the \r\nsame time, represented a major obstacle to Cuba’s \r\nsocial development, affecting the Cuban people’s \r\nefforts to maintain a normal life in respect and dignity, \r\nlet alone an improved life as humankind moves \r\ntowards the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. It has also impacted all those who \r\nhave wished and worked to foster legitimate, normal \r\nand mutually beneficial cultural, economic, \r\ncommercial and financial relations with Cuba, \r\nincluding an increasing proportion of the American \r\npeople. \r\n By voting in favour of resolution 65/6, my \r\ndelegation reiterates Viet Nam’s unswerving position \r\nthat disputes among States should and can only be \r\nresolved through peaceful dialogue and negotiations, \r\non the basis of equality, mutual respect for each other’s \r\nindependence and sovereignty, and the principle of the \r\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of States. \r\n We again joined the overwhelming majority of \r\nMember States in requesting that the Government of \r\nthe United States of America bring an immediate end to \r\nits unilateral economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo against Cuba in order to lessen the hardships \r\nunduly inflicted upon the Cuban people, reduce tension \r\nand create an atmosphere conducive to constructive \r\nefforts towards the early normalization of relations \r\nbetween the two countries in the interests of peace, \r\nstability and development of the region and of the \r\nworld as a whole. \r\n The Government and people of Viet Nam once \r\nagain reaffirm their support for and solidarity with the \r\nGovernment and people of Cuba. Together with the \r\ninternational community, we stand ready to continue to \r\nassist Cuba, as we always have done, to overcome the \r\nconsequences of the embargo. \r\n Mr. Onemola (Nigeria): We welcome the \r\npresence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba. I \r\nwant to thank him for the detailed briefing he delivered \r\non the impact of the United States economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo against Cuba. \r\nNigeria believes that it is the right of the Cuban people \r\nto independently decide on how they manage their \r\nfuture. Consequently, as in all previous years, Nigeria \r\nvoted in favour of resolution 65/6. \r\nA/65/PV.37  \r\n \r\n10-60583 8 \r\n \r\n Nigeria, like the overwhelming majority of the \r\ninternational community, opposes the imposition of an \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo against \r\nCuba. We consider the extraterritorial application of \r\nunilateral measures as contrary to the letter and the \r\nspirit of the Charter of the United Nations. It also runs \r\ncounter to the principles of multilateralism, \r\ninternational law, sovereignty and free trade — \r\nprinciples that we hold dear and that this body has \r\nchampioned over the years. \r\n In this regard, we welcome the decision taken last \r\nyear by the United States to remove a number of \r\nrestrictions on travel to Cuba and on the transfer of \r\nmoney and postal orders to Cuba from the United \r\nStates. \r\n Nigeria reiterates that constructive engagement \r\nand peaceful negotiations remain the only acceptable \r\nmeans of advancing long-term peace and stability. We \r\nappeal to the international community to prevail upon \r\nboth countries to move towards constructive and \r\nproductive engagement geared towards reaching a \r\ndefinitive resolution of their differences, leading to the \r\nlifting of the longest lasting trade embargo in human \r\nhistory. \r\n The Federal Government of Nigeria maintains \r\nfriendly relations with all States and does not favour \r\nunilateral punitive measures to settle political disputes. \r\nConsequently, Nigeria reiterates its position in favour \r\nof resolution 65/6. We have thus voted in favour of the \r\nlifting of the economic embargo against Cuba. \r\n Mr. Gonsalves (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines):  \r\n “The world must stand together to demonstrate \r\nthat international law is not an empty promise” \r\n(A/64/PV.3, p. 11). \r\n “No one nation can or should try to dominate \r\nanother nation. No world order that elevates one \r\nnation or group of people over another will \r\nsucceed. ... The traditional divisions between \r\nnations of the South and North make no sense in \r\nan interconnected world, nor do alignments of \r\nnations rooted in the cleavages of a long-gone \r\nCold War. \r\n  “The time has come to realize that the old \r\nhabits and … arguments are irrelevant to the \r\nchallenges faced by our peoples.” (ibid., p. 10) \r\n The words that I have just read were not penned \r\nby my delegation; they were quoted from the speech \r\ndelivered by our esteemed friend and brother, President \r\nBarack Obama of the United States, in his inaugural \r\naddress to the General Assembly one year ago. Saint \r\nVincent and the Grenadines wholeheartedly aligns \r\nitself with those words, as we do with the statements \r\nmade today on behalf of the Caribbean Community, the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77 and \r\nChina. \r\n President Obama’s words are particularly \r\nsignificant in the context of the ongoing United States \r\nembargo against Cuba, now well into its fifth decade. \r\nIf we are to establish international law as more than an \r\nempty promise, then the embargo, which violates \r\ninternational law and norms, must end. If we are to \r\nabandon the cleavages of a long gone Cold War, then \r\nthis relic of that ideological conflict must similarly be \r\nabandoned. And if we agree than one nation must not \r\nbe elevated over another, then surely, no super-Power \r\nshould subject a small island to decades of punitive \r\npersecution. \r\n For the past 18 years, the Members of the United \r\nNations have spoken out, in increasingly overwhelming \r\nnumbers, against the embargo. Most of the friends of \r\nthe United States — and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines \r\ncounts itself firmly among its closest allies — have \r\nrepeatedly decried the rationale, impact, utility and \r\nlegality of the embargo. Indeed, there may be no \r\nclearer and more long-standing example of the United \r\nStates disregard of overwhelming international opinion \r\nthan its continued unilateral imposition of this \r\nsenseless blockade. \r\n A report issued last year by the United States \r\nGovernment Accountability Office (GAO) concludes \r\nthat “the President has discretion to further ease \r\nregulatory restrictions” on a series of important \r\nincremental measures that are currently causing \r\nsuffering among Cubans. It is most unfortunate that \r\nany foreign president exerts such a direct and negative \r\ninfluence on the day-to-day lives of another nation’s \r\ncitizens. These regulatory restrictions cannot continue \r\nto act as a noose to be selectively tightened and \r\nloosened at the whim of any one country, or the \r\ndiscretion of any one president, in flagrant disregard of \r\ninternational law and norms. \r\n The GAO report goes on to state that the embargo \r\ncannot be fully eliminated without the repeal of certain \r\n A/65/PV.37\r\n \r\n9 10-60583 \r\n \r\nlegislation by the United States Congress or “without \r\ndetermining that a transition government or a \r\ndemocratically elected government is in power in \r\nCuba”. However, just last year, the United States \r\nPresident stood before us and gave voice to a widely \r\nheld belief when he said that, \r\n  “Democracy cannot be imposed on any \r\nnation from the outside. Each society must search \r\nfor its own path, and no path is perfect. Each \r\ncountry will pursue a path rooted in the culture of \r\nits people and in its past traditions. And I admit \r\nthat America has too often been selective in its \r\npromotion of democracy.” (ibid., p. 14) \r\n In this year’s address to the United Nations, \r\nPresident Obama again disavowed any idea of \r\nunilaterally forcing another independent nation to \r\nfollow a prescribed and preconceived political path, \r\nwhen he said, “make no mistake: the ultimate success \r\nof democracy in the world will not come because the \r\nUnited States dictates it” (see A/65/PV.11). Cathartic \r\nand laudable as such statements may be, they ring \r\nhollow when viewed through the prism of existing and \r\nstringently applied legislation that unabashedly \r\nattempts to externally impose a cookie-cutter concept \r\nof democracy, totally divorced from the culture, history \r\nand context of the Cuban people. \r\n Over the years, the embargo has been a policy in \r\nsearch of a justification. At one point, it was to contain \r\nthe so called security threat posed by Cuba. At another, \r\nit was to thwart the perceived ideological menace of \r\nCommunism in our hemisphere. Then, it was in \r\nretaliation for expropriated property, after that, to \r\nestablish a particular type of democracy. Today, we \r\nhear of human rights. Many other rationalizations have \r\nbeen similarly advanced and discarded over the years. \r\nBut, amid shifting justifications, the embargo has \r\nremained in force, with its only accomplishments being \r\nthe decades of hardships it has visited upon the Cuban \r\npeople and the narrow political gains it may engender \r\nwithin certain domestic constituencies. \r\n In this period of economic and food crises, the \r\nimpact of the embargo seems particularly cruel. Access \r\nto medical hardware, as we heard earlier, modern \r\nmedication, basic foodstuffs, construction materials, \r\nheavy equipment and spare parts are all severely \r\nrestricted by the embargo. Recent token measures in \r\nthe areas of individual travel and remittances by Cuban \r\nfamilies living overseas have not affected those major \r\nimpediments to Cuba’s development and advancement. \r\n Saint Vincent and the Grenadines finds itself in \r\nan era in which our small population and economy — \r\nnot to mention the waning military significance of the \r\nCaribbean region — have allowed our needs and \r\nconcerns to be overlooked by those who see the world \r\nonly through the prism of their narrow and immediate \r\ninterests. However, Cuba has remained a staunch and \r\nabiding partner in the development of our country. \r\nCuban universities have graduated over 250 Vincentian \r\nstudents and are currently playing host to 150 more. \r\nCuban’s surgeons have performed operations on over \r\n3,000 Vincentian patients. Cuban doctors have brought \r\nquality medical care and expertise to the most remote \r\nareas of our country. Even as we speak, Cuban \r\nengineers, architects and workers are labouring \r\nalongside Vincentians in the construction of a modern \r\nhospital and an international airport. \r\n As far wealthier nations and institutions have \r\nlooked askance at our developmental struggles and \r\noffered only dubious prescriptions and platitudes, the \r\nCuban people have rolled up their sleeves and given \r\nfreely of themselves in a manner that has touched the \r\nhearts and souls of the Vincentian people. No dollar \r\namount can adequately reflect the value of that support, \r\nsolidarity and partnership, for which the Cubans have \r\nasked nothing in return. Our appreciation cannot be \r\noverstated. \r\n My delegation would like to conclude as it began, \r\nwith the stirring and inspiring words of United States \r\nPresident Barack Obama’s inaugural address to the \r\nGeneral Assembly last year: \r\n  “The choice is ours. We can be remembered \r\nas the generation that chose to drag the arguments \r\nof the twentieth century into the twenty-first, and \r\nthat put off hard choices, refused to look ahead, \r\nand failed to keep pace because we defined \r\nourselves by what we were against instead of \r\nwhat we were for; or we can be a generation that \r\nchooses to see the shoreline beyond the rough \r\nwaters ahead, that comes together to serve the \r\ncommon interests of human beings, and finally \r\ngives meaning to the promise imbedded in the \r\nname given to this institution — the United \r\nNations. (A/64/PV.3, p. 11) \r\n Let us put the twentieth century arguments \r\nbehind us. Let us forever forswear illegal unilateral \r\nA/65/PV.37  \r\n \r\n10-60583 10 \r\n \r\naction. Let us instead look to the future, keep pace with \r\nthe times and heed the insistent and consistent voice of \r\nthe international community. This resolution is not \r\nsimply some ritualistic annual rite of the United \r\nNations; it is a matter of life and death for 11.5 million \r\nCubans. \r\n We in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines believe \r\nin change, and we live in hope that there will no longer \r\nbe any need for us to gather next year to vote on this \r\nresolution yet again. \r\n Mr. Sin Son Ho (Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea): The delegation of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea welcomes the adoption, during this \r\nmorning’s plenary meeting, of resolution 65/6, entitled \r\n“Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba”. We would like to reiterate our \r\nposition in that regard. \r\n As it did last year, the delegation of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea has once again \r\nvoted in favour of this resolution as an expression of \r\nour full support for and solidarity with the Government \r\nand people of Cuba in their struggle for justice and \r\nsocial progress, as well as in adherence to our \r\nconsistent position of opposing all forms of \r\ninterference and threats or uses of force and sanctions \r\nagainst sovereign States. \r\n The consecutive adoption of this resolution by the \r\nGeneral Assembly for the past 18 years, including \r\nvarious outcome documents of major international and \r\nregional meetings, including the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement Summit, manifest vividly that the United \r\nStates sanctions and embargo against Cuba constitute a \r\nflagrant violation of the United Nations Charter and \r\ninternational law. It is deplorable, however, that the \r\nunilateral economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nimposed by the United States against Cuba remains \r\nintact after 50 years, despite the strong demand and \r\nexpectations of the overwhelming majority of Member \r\nStates of the United Nations. \r\n No sign of any change in the policy of the United \r\nStates Administration on the embargo against Cuba has \r\nbeen seen for the past year since the adoption of \r\nresolution 64/6. On the contrary, the United States \r\nAdministration approved $40 million for the fiscal \r\nyears 2009 and 2010, with the aim of encouraging \r\nsubversive programmes against Cuba. If such an \r\namount of money were allocated and used for \r\nsupporting the socio economic development of \r\ndeveloping countries rather than for the subversion of \r\nsovereign States, one could easily imagine the positive \r\neffect that would result. \r\n The unilateral and cruel embargo by the United \r\nStates against Cuba has already caused hundreds of \r\nbillions of dollars in losses in various areas of the \r\ncountry’s economy. It has also severely impacted the \r\nsocial life and well-being of the Cuban people, thus \r\ncreating a great obstacle to the achievement of \r\ninternationally agreed development goals, including \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, in that country. \r\n The United States embargo against Cuba shows \r\nthat the routinely uttered commitment by the United \r\nStates to the implementation of the outcomes of major \r\nUnited Nations summits and conferences is merely lip \r\nservice and that its deeds in reality impede the efforts \r\nof other countries for socio economic development, \r\nthereby hampering United Nations-wide efforts for the \r\nwell-being and advancement of all human beings. \r\n It is not only Cuba but also several other \r\ncountries that suffered economic losses during the past \r\nyear because of the United States unilateral and \r\nextraterritorial embargo. This absurd embargo — \r\nwhereby one country unilaterally applies its own \r\nmeasures to the economic and trade sectors of other \r\ncountries beyond its own territorial scope — deserves \r\ndenunciation and rejection. \r\n By restricting the constitutional rights of its \r\ncitizens who wish to travel to Cuba, the United States \r\nGovernment also contravenes its own Constitution. \r\n In general, the United States policy of embargo \r\nagainst Cuba mocks the entire international \r\ncommunity, which demands an end to the embargo. It \r\nalso constitutes a grave violation of the principles of \r\nrespect for sovereignty, territorial integrity and \r\nnon-interference as enshrined in the United Nations \r\nCharter and relevant international law. Any coercive \r\nmeasure with a unilateral and extraterritorial nature \r\nthat pursues sinister political purposes and imposes a \r\npolitical, economic and social system based on a \r\ncertain country’s own perspective should never be \r\ntolerated in any way. \r\n The delegation of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea is of the view that the United States \r\nembargo against Cuba is an illegitimate and inhuman \r\nact that can never be justified in terms of political, \r\n A/65/PV.37\r\n \r\n11 10-60583 \r\n \r\nlegal, moral or humanitarian aspects and constitutes a \r\nflagrant, massive and systematic violation of the rights \r\nof an entire people. It is also undemocratic, as it aims \r\nto overthrow a sovereign State. We therefore strongly \r\ndenounce the persistent United States embargo against \r\nCuba. \r\n Our delegation avails itself of this opportunity to \r\nstrongly urge the United States to heed the demand of \r\nthe international community, observe all relevant \r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions adopted so far regarding \r\nthe embargo against Cuba and take measures to lift the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo against \r\nthat country immediately and without any conditions. \r\n The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea will \r\nin the future constantly support the just struggle of the \r\nCuban Government and people to terminate the United \r\nStates sanctions and embargo, and continue to further \r\ndevelop economic and trade relations with Cuba. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): We \r\nhave heard the last speaker in explanation of vote. \r\n A representative has requested the floor in \r\nexercise of the right of reply. May I remind members \r\nof the General Assembly that statements in exercise of \r\nthe right of reply should be limited to 10 minutes for \r\nthe first intervention and 5 minutes for the second \r\nintervention, and should be made by delegations from \r\ntheir seats. \r\n I give the floor to the representative of the \r\ndelegation of Cuba. \r\n Mr. Rodríguez Parrilla (Cuba) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): I am very grateful for the words of the \r\n13 speakers who have spoken at this afternoon’s \r\nunexpected meeting. \r\n With respect to what has been said by the \r\nrepresentatives of the United States and the European \r\nUnion, this is the nineteenth occasion on which the \r\ndelegation of the United States has repeated the same \r\nthing. The blockade is an act of economic warfare and \r\nan act of genocide. Last year I read out articles from \r\nthe relevant conventions. Has the United States \r\nDepartment of State not done its homework or studied \r\nthis issue? I will read it again. I have before me the \r\nConvention on the Prevention and Punishment of the \r\nCrime of Genocide, which in article 2 states that \r\n  “In the present Convention, genocide means \r\nany of the following acts … : ... Causing serious \r\nbodily or mental harm to members of the group; \r\n[or] Deliberately inflicting on the group \r\nconditions of life calculated to bring about its \r\nphysical destruction in whole or in part.” \r\n I already read here this morning the famous \r\nmemorandum by Mr. Mallory. These are not \r\nideological arguments from the past. The embargo is an \r\nold vestige held over from the Cold War. It is not an \r\nissue of rhetoric, but rather one of aggression against \r\nthe Cuban people. The aim of the United States is not \r\nto help or support our people. We know that the \r\nembargo causes hardship and suffering. It does not \r\ncause deaths because the Cuban revolution prevents \r\nthem. How can the United States delegation explain the \r\npunishment of Cuban children as described here? If it \r\nwanted to help or support the Cuban people, the only \r\nthing it would have to do is to lift the embargo. Why \r\nare Americans prevented from visiting our country and \r\nreceiving information first-hand? Why are they \r\nrestricting so called people-to-people contacts? \r\n The pretext for the embargo has continued to \r\nchange. First, it was the supposed membership in the \r\nSino-Soviet axis; then it was the so-called exporting of \r\nrevolution to Latin America, followed by the presence \r\nof Cuban troops in Africa, which were there to help \r\ndefeat apartheid and preserve the independence of \r\nAngola and achieve that of Namibia. And then it was \r\nmanipulation of human rights; but the embargo is a \r\nbrutal violation of the human rights of the Cuban \r\npeople. \r\n We are ready to discuss violations of human \r\nrights. We can begin with the concentration camp in \r\nGuantánamo, where torture is exercised and there is no \r\nright of habeas corpus; it is the realm of military \r\ncommissions outside the rule of law. Could the United \r\nStates delegation explain here what happened in the \r\nAbu Ghraib, Bagram and Nama camps? Has the \r\npresent Government brought any charges against those \r\nresponsible? Have any charges been brought against \r\nthose in the European Governments who authorized the \r\nsecret prisons in Europe and the secret flights of the \r\nCentral Intelligence Agency with people who had been \r\nkidnapped? Could the representative of the European \r\nUnion clarify that? We can also talk about Wikileaks. \r\nCould they tell us something about the atrocities \r\nreferred to in the 75,000 documents on crimes in \r\nAfghanistan and the 400,000 documents on Iraq? \r\nA/65/PV.37  \r\n \r\n10-60583 12 \r\n \r\n What can the United States delegation tell us \r\nabout extrajudicial executions proclaimed by Bush in \r\nhis famous 2003 State of the Union address, to the \r\napplause of Congress? What has the present \r\nGovernment done vis-à-vis those who are responsible? \r\nPerhaps the Joint Special Operations Command has \r\nbeen dissolved. Were the executive orders and \r\nauthorizations reversed, or are they still in force? Is it \r\ntrue that the chief of that command, General \r\nMcChrystal, was reporting directly to Vice President \r\nCheney? We could also discuss the brutal violence and \r\nhigh technology that they call counter-insurgency. \r\n Changes in Cuba are a matter for the Cuban \r\npeople. We will change all that has to be changed for \r\nthe benefit of the Cuban people, but we will not be \r\nasking for the opinion of the United States \r\nGovernment. We choose our destiny freely. That is why \r\nwe had a revolution. Those changes will be sovereign \r\nchanges, not gestures. We know that for the United \r\nStates the only thing that will suffice will be to \r\nestablish a pro-yanki Government in Cuba, but that \r\nwill not happen. \r\n If the United States Government wants to \r\nadvance in telecommunications, then it should lift the \r\nmeasures of the embargo that make business in that \r\narea impossible, put a stop to the pillaging of Cuban \r\nfunds in United States banks and eliminate the \r\nprovisions of the embargo that severely restrict \r\nCubans’ access to the Internet. If they want cooperation \r\namong universities, they should lift restrictions on \r\nacademic, student, scientific and cultural exchanges \r\nand allow universities to establish agreements among \r\nthemselves. If they want cooperation on drug \r\ntrafficking, counter-terrorism, trafficking in persons, \r\nnatural disasters and postal services, then they should \r\nat least respond to the proposal we made over a year \r\nago without any preconditions. \r\n The Government of the United States has \r\nchanged, but the funding of internal subversion in \r\nCuba is still the same. A high-ranking official of the \r\nUnited States Agency for International Development \r\nyesterday confirmed to journalist Tracey Eaton that in \r\nthe most recent period $15.6 million had been sent to \r\n“individuals on the ground in Cuba”. That is how they \r\nrefer to their mercenaries. \r\n Hostile radio and television broadcasts also \r\ncontinue. \r\n The five Cuban anti-terrorists continue to be \r\nunjustly imprisoned. Recently, Geraldo Hernández \r\nNordelo was groundlessly placed in solitary \r\nconfinement, where he is denied medical treatment. \r\nAdmitted international terrorists such as Orlando \r\nBosch and Luis Posada Carriles freely walk about \r\nMiami, where they are even politically active. \r\n There are talks on immigration, but the hostile \r\nimmigration policy continues with the Cuban \r\nAdjustment Act and the wet-foot/dry-foot policy. \r\n Once again, it is totally false that the United \r\nStates and Cuba are economic partners. Agricultural \r\nsales violate all regulations and practices of \r\ninternational trade and freedom of navigation. Lies \r\nhave been told in this Hall regarding alleged donations to \r\nCuba from non-governmental organizations amounting \r\nto $237 million. \r\n The blockade is abusively extraterritorial and \r\naffects everyone in this Hall. It is not a bilateral matter. \r\n I have little to add to what has already been said \r\nabout the European Union. We do not recognize any \r\nmoral or political authority whatsoever on the part of \r\nthat body to qualify it to make criticisms about human \r\nrights. It would do better to concern itself with its \r\nbrutal anti-immigrant policy, the deportation of \r\nminorities, the violent repression of demonstrators and \r\nthe growing social exclusion of its unemployed and \r\nlow-income sectors. Shamelessly and disgracefully, the \r\nEuropean Parliament devotes itself to awarding prizes \r\nto the paid agents of the United States Government in \r\nCuba. Now it says that the so called common position \r\nhas been left behind. We shall see. The facts will speak \r\nfor themselves. But the European Union is dreaming if \r\nit believes that it will be able to normalize relations \r\nwith Cuba while the so-called common position exists. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): We \r\nhave heard the only speaker in exercise of the right of \r\nreply. \r\n May I take it that it is the wish of the General \r\nAssembly to conclude its consideration of agenda \r\nitem 41? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n The meeting rose at 4.25 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
