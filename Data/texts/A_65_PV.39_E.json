(Switzerland) \r\n \r\n \r\n  In the absence of the President, Mrs. Rubiales de \r\nChamorro (Nicaragua), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 3 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 70 (continued) \r\n \r\nReport of the International Court of Justice \r\n \r\n  Report of the International Court of Justice \r\n(A/65/4) \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/65/309) \r\n \r\n Mr. Böhlke (Brazil): Let me start by thanking the \r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice, Judge \r\nHisashi Owada, for his comprehensive briefing on the \r\nwork of the Court. I commend the judges of the Court \r\nfor their significant contribution to the effective \r\napplication of international law. I also wish every \r\nsuccess to the recently elected members of the Court, \r\nJudges Xue Hanqin of China and Joan E. Donoghue of \r\nthe United States of America. \r\n I would also like to thank the Registrar of the \r\nCourt for his important work. As we know, the \r\nRegistrar performs a central function in providing \r\nadministrative services to the International Court of \r\nJustice and in acting as an officer in the daily legal \r\nactivities of the Court. \r\n In the Preamble of the Charter of the United \r\nNations, all Member States made a clear commitment \r\n “to establish conditions under which justice and \r\nrespect for the obligations arising from treaties \r\nand other sources of international law can be \r\nmaintained”. \r\nFurthermore, numerous other provisions of the Charter \r\nmake specific reference to the importance of upholding \r\nthe principles and norms of international law and \r\nensuring the peaceful settlement of disputes. \r\n The International Court of Justice is a key \r\nelement in the efforts to achieve those goals. By \r\nresolving international disputes and issuing advisory \r\nopinions, the Court not only strengthens the rule of law \r\non a global scale, thus enhancing predictability and \r\nstability in international relations, but also contributes \r\nto the maintenance of international peace and security. \r\n The International Court of Justice has been \r\naddressing cases whose subject matter touches a wide \r\nrange of sensitive issues, such as territorial and \r\nmaritime delimitation, environmental concerns, \r\njurisdictional immunities of the State, violation of \r\nterritorial integrity, racial discrimination and human \r\nrights violations. Over the past year, the Court has \r\ntaken up four new cases and received one request for \r\nan advisory opinion. The number of contentious cases \r\non the docket remains high, standing at 15 at the \r\nmoment, compared to 13 in the previous year. Also \r\nnoteworthy is that the contentious cases come from \r\nvarious parts of the world. \r\n Those remarkable aspects of the recent work of \r\nthe Court testify to its true universal character, its wide \r\nacceptance and the trust placed by the international \r\nA/65/PV.39  \r\n \r\n10-61026 2 \r\n \r\ncommunity upon the principal judicial organ of the \r\nUnited Nations. In order to maintain confidence in the \r\nCourt, States that are parties to a case need to comply \r\nwith the relevant decision made by that organ, in \r\naccordance with the Charter. \r\n My delegation welcomes the continued efforts \r\nmade by the Court to increase its efficiency and \r\nthereby enable it to cope with the steady increase in its \r\nworkload. We note that the cases referred to the Court \r\nare growing in factual and legal complexity, as have \r\nthe several phases of the process, which may include \r\npreliminary objections or requests for the indication of \r\nprovisional measures. However, justice needs to be \r\nserved speedily in order to strengthen the rule of law at \r\nthe international level. \r\n Brazil notes with satisfaction that the General \r\nAssembly responded positively to the request made by \r\nthe International Court of Justice to establish new law \r\nclerk posts with a view to enabling each member of the \r\nCourt to benefit from personalized legal support and \r\nthus to devote more time to reflection and deliberation. \r\nWe also welcome the creation of posts to manage the \r\nnew telecommunications infrastructure of the Court \r\nand better assist the Registrar. The Court should be \r\ngranted all the assistance it needs to discharge its \r\nfunctions in an expeditious, effective and impartial \r\nmanner. \r\n In conclusion, I wish to reiterate the unwavering \r\nsupport of my delegation for the work undertaken by \r\nthe Court and its significant contribution to the \r\ncontinued strengthening of a rules-based international \r\nsystem. The Court has played a key role in the \r\nfulfilment of the purposes enshrined in the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations and will continue to do so in the \r\nfuture as the world becomes more integrated and \r\ninterconnected. \r\n Mr. Ojo (Nigeria): The delegation of Nigeria \r\nwishes to join all other delegations in expressing its \r\ncondolences to the family of the late Prime Minister, \r\nMr. David Thompson, as well as to the Government \r\nand the good people of Barbados, on the untimely \r\ndeath of Mr. Thompson. \r\n The Nigerian delegation welcomes and expresses \r\nits appreciation to the President of the International \r\nCourt of Justice, His Excellency Judge Hisashi Owada, \r\nfor the leadership he has provided, and we congratulate \r\nthe new Judges that were elected earlier this year. \r\n We commend the report contained in document \r\nA/65/4, which has comprehensively summed up the \r\nactivities of the Court for the period under review. My \r\ndelegation also notes that the Court, which is not only \r\na principal organ of the United Nations but also an \r\ninternational court of universal character with general \r\njurisdiction, has over time successfully mainstreamed \r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes on a growing \r\nnumber of diverse issues, while excluding all political \r\nconsiderations. The scope of cases handled by the \r\nCourt encompasses a wide variety of subjects ranging \r\nfrom territorial and maritime delimitation, diplomatic \r\nprotection, environmental concerns, jurisdictional \r\nimmunities of States, violation of territorial integrity, \r\nracial discrimination, violation of human rights, and \r\ninterpretation and application of international \r\nconventions and treaties. \r\n The increased recourse to the Court by States for \r\njudicial settlement of disputes on diverse issues is a \r\nclear demonstration of the confidence they have in the \r\nCourt and the acceptability of this judicial institution. \r\nWe are pleased with the commitment of the Court to \r\nimprove its efficiency in order to cope with its \r\nincreasing workload. We note with satisfaction that the \r\nCourt has continued to re examine its procedures and \r\nworking methods. It is heartening to note that efforts \r\nare being made to strengthen the staff of the Court’s \r\nRegistry, to improve on skills and efficiency of \r\ndelivery, and to provide incentives to Judges. \r\n On the issue of recognition of the Court’s \r\ncompulsory jurisdiction, my delegation wishes to note \r\nthat States parties cannot, on one hand, establish the \r\nCourt as the judicial organ of the United Nations in a \r\nmandatory manner, while at the same time viewing the \r\nissue of recognition as a matter of voluntary \r\nacceptance by individual nations. It is therefore \r\nsaddening that many decades after the establishment of \r\nthe Court, only 66 declarations of recognition have \r\nbeen received. \r\n We therefore appeal to all the countries that have \r\nyet to do so to accede to the declaration of recognition \r\nof the International Court of Justice in view of the \r\nCourt’s central role in the consolidation of the rule of \r\nlaw at the international level. The referral of cases to \r\nthe Court offers more peaceful options in the \r\nsettlement of disputes between States than do the \r\ncostly exchange of hostilities. Nigeria’s acceptance of \r\nthe Court’s judgment in the celebrated Bakassi case \r\nwith the Republic of Cameroon is worthy of emulation. \r\n A/65/PV.39\r\n \r\n3 10-61026 \r\n \r\n However, we also wish to use this opportunity to \r\nemphasize that the Court should endeavour to develop \r\nmore effective mechanisms for monitoring \r\nimplementation of the Court’s decisions as well as for \r\nevaluating the moral and legal outcomes of its advisory \r\nopinions. \r\n Mr. Zaimov (Bulgaria): Let me first thank \r\nPresident Owada for his presentation of the report of \r\nthe International Court of Justice covering the period \r\nfrom 1 August 2009 to 31 July 2010 (A/65/4). \r\n Bulgaria attaches great importance to the Court as \r\nthe principal judicial organ of the United Nations and \r\nthe only international court of a universal character \r\nwith general jurisdiction. Since its establishment, the \r\nInternational Court of Justice has played an important \r\nrole in addressing disputes between States, thus \r\ncontributing to the development of international law \r\nand the promotion and strengthening of the rule of law. \r\nBy being a cornerstone for the peaceful resolution of \r\ndisputes, which is fundamental for the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security, the Court has acquired \r\na solid reputation as an impartial institution with the \r\nhighest legal standards, in accordance with its mandate \r\nunder the Charter of the United Nations. \r\n Over the past few years, the number of cases \r\npending before the Court has increased, standing at the \r\npresent moment at 15. Contentious cases have grown in \r\nfactual and legal complexity and come from all over \r\nthe world, which is an illustration of the regional \r\ndiversity of the Court’s cases and its universality. \r\nMember States continue to reaffirm their confidence in \r\nthe Court’s ability to resolve their disputes. The \r\nCourt’s advisory opinions carry great weight and moral \r\nauthority, often serving as an instrument of preventive \r\ndiplomacy, and have an ever-increasing value for the \r\nclarification of the status of international law on \r\ndifferent issues. \r\n The increasing caseload before the Court, coming \r\nfrom so many different geographical regions is not \r\nonly a testament to the growing recognition of the \r\nCourt’s vital role in the settlement of disputes, but also \r\nproof of the confidence that States have in the Court. \r\n A case in point in that regard is the changing \r\ndocket of cases entrusted to the Court, the scope of \r\ncases and the Court’s growing specialization in \r\ncomplex aspects of public international law. While in \r\nthe past most of the cases brought before the Court \r\nrelated to territorial and maritime delimitation disputes, \r\na growing number of new types of cases have been \r\nreferred to it recently, such as jurisdictional immunities \r\nof the State, jurisdiction and enforcement of judgments \r\nin civil and commercial matters, whaling in the \r\nAntarctic, aerial herbicide spraying, and so on. \r\n It is worth noting that regard that the time needed \r\nfor rendering decisions and advisory opinions has been \r\ndecreasing. \r\n On behalf of my Government, I would like to \r\ntake this opportunity to encourage all States that have \r\nnot done so to accept the Court’s compulsory \r\njurisdiction under Article 36 of the Statute of the Court \r\nin order to further enhance its role in contributing to \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security and \r\nthe rule of law. \r\n Last but not least, let me also note with \r\nsatisfaction the recent election of two judges, whom we \r\ncongratulate. They are the first female judges to sit \r\nconcurrently on the Court, which we consider to be a \r\npositive step in addressing the gender balance of the \r\nCourt. \r\n In conclusion, Bulgaria reaffirms its strong \r\nsupport for the International Court of Justice. \r\n Mr. Tladi (South Africa): I thank you, Madame, \r\nfor affording us the opportunity to deliver a statement \r\non the report of the International Court of Justice \r\n(A/65/4). I also wish to thank the President of the \r\nCourt, Judge Owada, for his presentation of the Court’s \r\nreport. \r\n Allow me also to extend our warm \r\ncongratulations and welcome to Judge Xue Hangin and \r\nJudge Joan Donoghue upon their election to the Court. \r\nAt the same time, we thank Judges Shi and \r\nBuergenthal for the contribution that they have made \r\nover the years to the Court. \r\n This delegation has, on a number of occasions, \r\nstressed the importance of judicial settlement for the \r\npromotion of the rule of law and the pursuit of the \r\npurposes and principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations. The willingness of States to refer matters to \r\nthe International Court of Justice facilitates the \r\ndevelopment of international law as an instrument for \r\ncreating a better world for everyone. This, after all, is \r\nthe very reason for the existence of modern \r\ninternational law beyond the State-centred pre-Second \r\nWorld War international law. It is for that reason that \r\nwe note with pleasure that the number of cases on the \r\nA/65/PV.39  \r\n \r\n10-61026 4 \r\n \r\nCourt’s docket continues to grow. We welcome the four \r\nnew submissions made to the Court in the period under \r\nreview, while noting that a fifth has been withdrawn. \r\n In our previous statement on the report of the \r\nCourt, we made specific reference to cases involving \r\nenvironmental protection on the Court’s docket, \r\nnamely the cases entitled Pulp Mills on the River \r\nUruguay (Argentina v. Uruguay) and Aerial Herbicide \r\nSpraying (Ecuador v. Colombia). We stated our \r\neagerness for the judgments to be handed down in the \r\nhope that they will build on the already rich wealth of \r\njurisprudence on the environment in international law. \r\nIndeed, the Court’s decision on the Pulp Mills case \r\nfurther develops principles of international \r\nenvironmental law. While the Court’s determination \r\nthat there was an obligation to cooperate is based \r\nprincipally on treaty obligations under the Statute of \r\nthe River Uruguay, the Court clearly draws upon \r\ngeneral principles, in particular in making the link \r\nbetween obligations that are both procedural and \r\nsubstantive. \r\n The principle of prevention, enunciated in earlier \r\nCourt decisions, notably in the Corfu Channel (United \r\nKingdom v. Albania) case and in the Advisory Opinion \r\non the Legality of the Use or Threat of Use of Nuclear \r\nWeapons, was drawn upon significantly by the Court in \r\nreaching this decision. This principle, which was first \r\nenunciated in that famous arbitral decision in the Trail \r\nSmelter case, is also contained in both the Stockholm \r\nDeclaration on the Human Environment and the Rio \r\nDeclaration on Environment and Development. The \r\nPulp Mills on the River Uruguay case illustrates, \r\ntherefore, the Court’s continuing contribution to this \r\nconstantly developing area of international law. \r\n Allow me to digress momentarily. The Pulp Mills \r\ncase is important not only for the environmental \r\nprinciples it enunciates, but also with respect to the \r\nquestion of the Court’s assessment of evidence. In that \r\nrespect, we have taken note of the joint dissenting \r\nopinion of Judges Al-Khasawneh and Simma, which \r\nsuggests that in such cases there is a need for the Court \r\nto appoint its own experts to assess the evidence. We \r\nrecall that in 2006, then-President of the Court Higgins \r\nnoted the particular difficulties that the Court, which \r\nwas not designed to evaluate evidence, faced when \r\nparties to a dispute presented conflicting and often \r\ncomplex evidence. This is an issue that will need to be \r\naddressed one or way or another. Nonetheless, we \r\nkeenly await the Court’s judgment in the Aerial \r\nHerbicide Spraying case and hope that it will also \r\nmake a contribution to the relevant principles. \r\n We have also noted that another environmental \r\ncase has been added to the Court’s docket, namely, the \r\nWhaling in the Antarctic (Australia v. Japan) case, and \r\nare looking forward to the Court’s decision in that case, \r\nwhich, we hope, will similarly contribute to the body \r\nof law governing the environment, in particular in \r\nrespect of the law of the sea. \r\n South Africa has, on a number of occasions and \r\nin various forums, spoken of the importance of \r\nadvisory opinions as a tool for the peaceful settlement \r\nof disputes. An advisory opinion that was eagerly \r\nanticipated in many quarters is the Advisory Opinion \r\non the Accordance with international law of the \r\nunilateral declaration of independence in respect of \r\nKosovo. My delegation had already expressed its \r\neagerness for the release of that Advisory Opinion in \r\nour statement at the sixty-fourth session. Many \r\ninternational law experts, including those supporting \r\nthe unilateral declaration of independence and those \r\nopposed to it, felt somewhat disappointed or, to put it \r\nmildly, somewhat underwhelmed by the Opinion. \r\nMany of us had expected the Court to make a \r\nsignificant contribution to international law, in \r\nparticular by exploring the intersection of various, \r\nsometimes conflicting, principles of law. We had \r\nanticipated, for example, the exploration of the \r\nrelationship between territorial integrity, the right to \r\nself-determination and sovereignty, among other \r\nthings. While the Court, of course, declared the \r\nprinciple of territorial integrity to be limited only to \r\ninter-State relations, we can find no a priori reason for \r\nthat conclusion. We had anticipated, also, that the \r\nCourt would shed some light on the applicability of the \r\nright to self-determination and its confines beyond the \r\ncontext of colonialism. \r\n Instead, the Court, as we heard this morning, \r\ndecided to interpret narrowly — and remarkably \r\nliterally — the question put to it, in such a manner that \r\nthe Opinion, in the final analysis, does little to assist \r\neither the General Assembly or the international \r\ncommunity of States in grappling with the real question \r\nthat the drafters of the question had intended to seek an \r\nopinion on. We must recall that the purpose of an \r\nadvisory opinion is to assist the author of the request. \r\nWhile a purely literal interpretation might justify the \r\nnarrow approach adopted by the Court, the Court has \r\nitself noted in this and other advisory opinions — for \r\n A/65/PV.39\r\n \r\n5 10-61026 \r\n \r\ninstance in the Legal Consequences of the Construction \r\nof a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory \r\nquestion — that it may “broaden, interpret and even \r\nreformulate the question”. \r\n If the Court felt it inappropriate for other reasons \r\nto deliver an opinion on the real question, then, as the \r\ndissenting opinion of Judge Bennouna mentions, the \r\nCourt could, as its jurisprudence allows, have decided \r\nnot to exercise its jurisdiction, even though legally it \r\nhad such jurisdiction. However, my delegation stresses \r\nthat this discretion should be exercised sparingly. \r\n Nonetheless, we are pleased that the various \r\ndissenting and separate opinions of the Court, most \r\nnotably the dissenting opinion of Judge Koroma, the \r\nseparate opinions of Judges Yusuf and Trindade, and \r\nthe declaration of Judge Simma, provide a rich source \r\nof analysis of the legal issues in question, and we hope \r\nthat delegations will consult them, as they continue to \r\ndiscuss and consider the question of a unilateral \r\ndeclaration of independence. \r\n Finally, we are pleased to note the various other \r\nnon-judicial activities of the Court, including the \r\nhosting of a number of visits and the publications of \r\nthe Court. \r\n Mr. Tsiskarashvili (Georgia): My delegation \r\nwould like to join previous speakers in welcoming the \r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice, His \r\nExcellency Hisashi Owada, and to commend him for \r\nthe informative presentation he made earlier today (see \r\nA/65/PV.38). Georgia takes note of the report of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice (A/65/4) presented to the \r\nGeneral Assembly today for its consideration. The \r\nreport briefly outlines developments concerning the \r\ncase instituted by Georgia against the Russian \r\nFederation in 2008 with regard to the latest violation of \r\nits obligations under the Convention on the Elimination \r\nof All Forms of Racial Discrimination by orchestrating \r\nethnic cleansing and discrimination involving violence \r\nand the subjection of numerous Georgians to \r\ndeprivation of their fundamental rights, including safe \r\nand dignified return to their homes in two provinces of \r\ntheir country, namely, the Tskhinvali region and \r\nAbkhazia. \r\n Georgia has submitted its written and oral \r\narguments to the International Court of Justice in \r\ncompliance with the schedule set by the Court. From \r\n13 to 17 September 2010, the Court held a public \r\nhearing on the case, where both sides presented their \r\nrespective positions. At this stage, the deliberations on \r\njurisdiction for consideration of the case by the Court \r\nare pending. Therefore, we will refrain from rebutting \r\nthe legal arguments voiced earlier in this Hall. \r\nGeorgia’s written and oral submissions are fully \r\navailable on the website of the International Court of \r\nJustice. We have full confidence in the International \r\nCourt of Justice and respect for its rules and \r\nprocedures. \r\n This conflict has generated almost two decades of \r\nhuman suffering, and the Court is the last resort and \r\nsymbol of justice for hundreds of thousands of \r\nGeorgians who have been denied their basic rights, \r\nincluding their right to return to their homes. There is a \r\ndispute between Russia and Georgia under the \r\nInternational Convention on the Elimination of All \r\nForms of Racial Discrimination, and the International \r\nCourt of Justice is the most appropriate forum for the \r\nresolution of that dispute. In conclusion, I would like \r\nto reiterate our strong support for the Court in its role \r\nas the principal judicial organ of the United Nations. \r\nAs has been mentioned here, the Court plays a vital \r\nrole in the peaceful settlement of international disputes \r\nand in strengthening the international legal order. \r\n Mr. Argüello (Nicaragua) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nBefore making our comments, allow me to express, on \r\nbehalf of the Government of Reconciliation and \r\nNational Unity, the deepest condolences of the people \r\nof Nicaragua in view of the untimely passing of the \r\nformer President of Argentina, Néstor Kirchner. \r\n Nicaragua expresses its gratitude to His \r\nExcellency Judge Hisashi Owada, President of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, for his report (A/65/4). \r\nThe fact that the judicial year of 2009 to 2010 was a \r\nyear of great activity and that it is anticipated, \r\nmoreover, that the next year will be equally intense, \r\nconfirms the relevance of the International Court of \r\nJustice as the principal judicial organ of the United \r\nNations and as the only international court of a \r\nuniversal character with general jurisdiction. \r\n In this regard, we underscore that the work of the \r\nCourt contributes not only to the promotion, \r\nstrengthening and spread of the rule of law but also to \r\nthe enhancement of global security, as it promotes the \r\nsettlement of disputes by peaceful means, which is the \r\nfundamental purpose of the United Nations and the \r\npermanent hope of humankind. \r\nA/65/PV.39  \r\n \r\n10-61026 6 \r\n \r\n We regret the fact that to date, as is reflected in \r\nthe report, only 66 States have recognized the \r\ncompulsory jurisdiction of the Court and that, \r\nfurthermore, a number of those recognitions contain \r\nreservations, which in many cases render the \r\nacceptance of that jurisdiction meaningless. We \r\nencourage all States that have not yet done so to \r\nrecognize the jurisdiction of the Court and, thus, to \r\ncontribute to the strengthening of the rule of law at the \r\ninternational level. \r\n Nicaragua has anchored its international relations \r\nin friendship, solidarity and reciprocity among peoples \r\nand that is why we have not only recognized the \r\nprinciple of the peaceful settlement of international \r\ndisputes through the means available under \r\ninternational law, but have also made use of those \r\nmeans on many occasions and continue to do so. In the \r\npast 26 years, Nicaragua has participated as a plaintiff \r\nor as a defendant in seven major cases and a number of \r\nsmaller cases brought before the Court. Those matters \r\nrange from the cases of the military and paramilitary \r\nactions in and against Nicaragua in Nicaragua v. the \r\nUnited States of America, decided by the Court in June \r\n1986, to the current pending case of Nicaragua v. \r\nColombia, in which public hearings were held last \r\nweek in order to address the applications to testify \r\nsubmitted by both Costa Rica and Honduras. Nicaragua \r\nhas thus not demonstrated not only its confidence in \r\ninternational justice by responding to its call and \r\navailing itself of it on repeated occasions, but also its \r\nwillingness to make proposals to strengthen and \r\npromote mechanisms for the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes. \r\n In that regard, allow us to recall that the initiative \r\nto declare the United Nations Decade of International \r\nLaw was launched by Nicaragua, which presented that \r\ninitiative through the Non-Aligned Movement in 1988. \r\nThat initiative contained a fundamental element, \r\nnamely the promotion of universal compulsory \r\nmechanisms for the peaceful settlement of disputes, in \r\nparticular through recourse to the International Court \r\nof Justice. A ministerial meeting of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement was convened to that end, in The Hague in \r\nJune 1989, which culminated in a declaration by more \r\nthan 80 Member States, representing at that time a \r\nsignificant majority of the membership of the United \r\nNations, which included the adoption of an initiative to \r\npresent the proposal of the Decade of International \r\nLaw to the General Assembly. \r\n The raison d’être of that initiative was to restore \r\nthe spirit that had imbued the first two International \r\nPeace Conferences, convened in The Hague in 1899 \r\nand 1907, which sought to establish a universal \r\ncompulsory mechanism for the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes. That mechanism, which could not in the end \r\nbe established at those first Conferences, is today \r\ncrystallised in the International Court of Justice, and \r\nour work today is to ensure that the Court truly \r\nbecomes a universal compulsory mechanism without \r\nany loopholes that could hamper the compulsory nature \r\nof its jurisdiction and with the proper resources to \r\nguarantee compliance with its decisions. \r\n Nicaragua is of the view that what has not been \r\npossible to establish in the past, owing perhaps to the \r\ninternational situation that prevailed at the end of the \r\n1980s, should be taken up again in order to promote \r\nthe universal acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction \r\nof the Court. To that end, Nicaragua, once again, will \r\ntake steps to revive that 25-year-old initiative. \r\n In conclusion, my delegation would like to \r\nexpress its great satisfaction with the work of the Court \r\nand convey, once again, our gratitude to President \r\nOwada for the presentation of this report. \r\n Mr. Martinsen (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nBefore I begin, I would like to thank the representative \r\nof Nicaragua, who took the floor before me, for the \r\nwords of condolence and sympathy that he expressed \r\nto the nation of Argentina in relation to the untimely \r\npassing yesterday morning of the former head of State, \r\nNéstor Kirchner, who led the Argentines between 2003 \r\nand 2007 and who was the spouse of our current head \r\nof State, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner. We are \r\ngrateful for those remarks as well as for all the other \r\nexpressions of condolences that we have received since \r\nthis sad event. \r\n Before proceeding, the Argentine delegation \r\nwould like, first and foremost, to commend the \r\nrecently elected judges to the International Court of \r\nJustice, Ms. Xue Hanqin and Ms. Joan Donoghue, for \r\ntheir election. The Republic of Argentina wishes them \r\nthe greatest success in their endeavours. \r\n Argentina also thanks the President of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, Mr. Hisashi Owada, for \r\nthe presentation of the report (A/65/4) of the Court on \r\nits work during the past year, in particular, with regard \r\nto the case between Argentina and Uruguay on the \r\nconstruction of pulp mills on the left bank of the River \r\n A/65/PV.39\r\n \r\n7 10-61026 \r\n \r\nUruguay, in which the Court issued its judgment this \r\npast 20 April. \r\n In relation to that case, the Argentine delegation \r\nrecalls that Argentina had initiated the proceedings \r\nbefore the International Court of Justice in connection \r\nwith the violation by Uruguay of its procedural and \r\nsubstantial obligations under the Statute of the River \r\nUruguay of 1975 in authorizing, unilaterally and \r\nwithout prior consultation, the construction of two pulp \r\nmills and a port terminal on the left bank of the River \r\nUruguay in disregard of its obligations in terms of \r\ninformation and prior consultation provided for in the \r\nStatute, as well as in connection with the considerable \r\nharm done to the River Uruguay and its riparian areas \r\nas a result of the functioning of one of mills, the Orion \r\nplant, although the other mill, that of the Empresa \r\nNacional de Celulosas de España, was not, in the end, \r\nconstructed. \r\n As recalled by the President of the International \r\nCourt of Justice in his statement this morning, the \r\nCourt found that Uruguay had, as claimed by \r\nArgentina, repeatedly violated the rules of the Statute \r\nby failing to inform the Administrative Commission of \r\nthe River Uruguay (CARU) before granting \r\nauthorization for the construction of the plants and the \r\nport terminal and by failing to notify Argentina of \r\nthose projects through the Commission. \r\n With regard to the President’s statements \r\nconcerning scientific evidence, which, as he indicated, \r\nwas extensively presented by the parties, Argentina \r\nconcurs that the evaluation of reports of that kind can \r\nbe particularly complex, especially if they contain \r\ndivergent arguments and conclusions. In that regard, \r\nArgentina agrees that, in controversies related to the \r\nenvironment in which it is increasingly necessary to \r\nassess complex scientific evidence, it will be difficult \r\nfor the Court to arrive at a conclusion without recourse \r\nto the tools provided by the resolution concerning the \r\ninternal judicial practice of the Court of 1976, which \r\nPresident Owada mentioned. Beyond that, it is also \r\nrelevant to mention the provisions of Article 50 of the \r\nStatute of the Court and of article 67 of its rules. In that \r\nlight, clearly the Court should in our case have \r\nconsidered the technical problems and arguments, with \r\nthe assistance of objective technical experts, so as to \r\nform its own opinion on the scientific evidence \r\nprovided. \r\n Perhaps because it did not bring those means to \r\nbear, the Court in our case — despite the scientific \r\nevidence provided by Argentina — could not \r\nconclusively establish Uruguay’s violation of the \r\nsubstantive norms of the 1975 Statute and the \r\nsignificant harm already done to the River Uruguay \r\nand its surrounding areas. \r\n Nevertheless, the Argentine delegation wishes to \r\nunderscore the importance of paragraph 281 of the \r\nJudgment, in which the Court instructs both parties as \r\nfollows: \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n “[T]he Court points out that the 1975 Statute \r\nplaces the Parties under a duty to co operate with \r\neach other, on the terms therein set out, to ensure \r\nthe achievement of its object and purpose. This \r\nobligation to co operate encompasses ongoing \r\nmonitoring of an industrial facility, such as the \r\nOrion (Botnia) mill. In that regard the Court \r\nnotes that the Parties have a long-standing and \r\neffective tradition of co operation and co \r\nordination through CARU. By acting jointly \r\nthrough CARU, the Parties have established a \r\nreal community of interests and rights in the \r\nmanagement of the River Uruguay and in the \r\nprotection of its environment. They have also \r\ncoordinated their actions through the joint \r\nmechanism of CARU, in conformity with the \r\nprovisions of the 1975 Statute, and found \r\nappropriate solutions to their differences within \r\nits framework without feeling the need to resort \r\nto the judicial settlement of disputes provided for \r\nin Article 60 of the Statute until the present case \r\nwas brought before the Court.” \r\n(spoke in Spanish) \r\n Argentina is pleased to report that, in order to \r\nstart the implementation of the mandate provided by \r\nthe Court in paragraph 281 of its Judgment, Argentina \r\nand Uruguay have concluded agreements at the \r\npresidential and ministerial levels for implementing a \r\nplan for the continuous monitoring of the functioning \r\nof the Orion (Botnia) pulp mill — currently owned by \r\nUPM — and of its effects on the River Uruguay. \r\n Mr. Morejón (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish): First \r\nof all, allow me to express solidarity — as many have \r\nthis morning and this afternoon — with our brother \r\ncountry Barbados for the untimely passing of its Prime \r\nA/65/PV.39  \r\n \r\n10-61026 8 \r\n \r\nMinister David John Howard Thompson, who has left \r\nthis world too soon, and to express the solidarity of the \r\npeople and Government of Ecuador with the people \r\nand Government of Barbados, especially \r\nMr. Thompson’s family. \r\n We must also take this opportunity to express our \r\nsolidarity with Argentina. We were deeply affected by \r\nthe news of the passing of our friend and colleague \r\nNéstor Kirchner. Yesterday, the President of the \r\nRepublic of Ecuador, in his capacity as the pro tempore \r\nChair of the Union of South American Nations, issued \r\non behalf of the people and Government of Ecuador a \r\nstatement of solidarity with the people and \r\nGovernment of Argentina, in particular to Cristina \r\nFernández and her children. May Mr. Kirchner rest in \r\npeace. \r\n The delegation of Ecuador wishes to convey its \r\nparticular gratitude to the President of the International \r\nCourt of Justice, Mr. Hisashi Owada, for the valuable \r\nreport he has submitted on the work of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice over the past year \r\n(A/65/4), which sets out the important work \r\naccomplished by the Court in addressing many delicate \r\ncases under its jurisdiction. Ecuador wishes also to \r\ngratefully acknowledge the work of Judges Shi Jiuyong \r\nand Thomas Buergenthal, whose contributions now \r\nform part of the acquis and prestige of the Court, and \r\nwelcomes the appointment of the new Judges of the \r\nCourt, Ms. Xue Hanqin and Ms. Joan Donoghue, to \r\nwhom we wish every success as they take up their \r\nsensitive duties.  \r\n The variety of legal disputes brought before the \r\nCourt reaffirms the prevailing confidence in the \r\nprocedures of that fundamental organ of the United \r\nNations. Moreover, we cannot but note from \r\nMr. Owada’s report that a third of the issues and \r\ndisputes currently under consideration by the Court \r\ninvolve countries of the Latin American and Caribbean \r\nregion, which shows that our region is firmly \r\ncommitted to compliance with international law and \r\nabove all to the principle of the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes. \r\n Ecuador recognizes the jurisdiction and \r\ncompetence of the International Court of Justice, based \r\non the constitutional principle of the recognition of \r\ninternational law as a norm governing conduct. In that \r\nvein, we underscore the importance that we attach to \r\nthe advisory function of the Court, given that its \r\nopinions are a fundamental basis for the undertakings \r\nof the United Nations as a whole. \r\n We agree with those delegations that today have \r\nstressed the need to ensure that the Court is equipped \r\nwith all necessary resources, both human and material, \r\nif it is to handle the increase in its workload and \r\nresponsibilities. Ecuador also commends the Court’s \r\noutreach activities targeting international public \r\nopinion about its work. This also reflects a genuine \r\ndissemination of international law. \r\n To conclude, we wish to underline the importance \r\nof Mr. Owada’s words when he notes in his statement \r\nthat \r\n “[i]t is no exaggeration to say that the rule of law \r\nnow permeates every aspect of the activities of \r\nthe United Nations, from the maintenance of \r\npeace and security to the protection of human \r\nrights, and from the fight against poverty to the \r\nprotection of the global environment, including \r\nthe case of climate change” (A/65/PV.38). \r\nWe therefore share the view that in the realm of action, \r\nthe role of the International Court of Justice is \r\nfundamental. \r\n Ms. Adams (United Kingdom): The United \r\nKingdom thanks President Owada for his \r\ncomprehensive and thorough report on the work of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice during the past \r\n12 months (A/65/4) and for his statement this morning. \r\n I would like to start by reaffirming the United \r\nKingdom’s strong support for the International Court \r\nof Justice in the vital role it plays as the principal \r\njudicial organ of the United Nations. The four new \r\ncontentious cases initiated this year, which involve \r\nStates from Australasia, Latin America, Africa, Europe \r\nand Asia, underline the continuing confidence that \r\nStates place in the Court as a forum for dispute \r\nresolution. The range of cases also illustrates that the \r\nInternational Court of Justice is truly a world Court \r\nwhose jurisdiction is respected in all parts of the globe. \r\nThat fact has been further emphasized by the numerous \r\nexpressions of support for the Court during our debate \r\ntoday. \r\n The past 12 months have been a busy year for the \r\nCourt. The trend of an increasing workload shows no \r\nsign of abating. Against that background, the United \r\nKingdom welcomes the Court’s continued commitment \r\nto enhancing its efficiency and re-examining its \r\n A/65/PV.39\r\n \r\n9 10-61026 \r\n \r\nprocedures and working methods, and we congratulate \r\nthe Court again on having cleared its backlog of cases. \r\nHowever, the annual report also notes that the cases \r\nreferred to the Court are growing in factual and legal \r\ncomplexity. It may therefore be that the Court will \r\nneed to explore further reforms to enable it to continue \r\nto deal with such complex cases in an efficient and \r\neffective manner. \r\n The United Kingdom believes that the role played \r\nby the Court would be further enhanced if more States \r\nwere to accept its compulsory jurisdiction. We note \r\nthat the number of States accepting compulsory \r\njurisdiction still stands at 66, including the United \r\nKingdom itself. We continue to encourage other States \r\nto accept the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction while \r\nacknowledging that other mechanisms exist for dispute \r\nresolution. \r\n Briefly, with regard to the advisory opinion on \r\nthe Accordance with international law of the unilateral \r\ndeclaration of independence in respect of Kosovo, the \r\nUnited Kingdom has noted the views of other \r\ndelegations expressed during this debate. The United \r\nKingdom does not dispute that Security Council \r\nresolution 1244 (1999) remains in force, but we do not \r\ndraw the same conclusion from that fact as others. We \r\nwelcome the Court’s affirmation that Kosovo’s \r\ndeclaration of independence did not violate \r\ninternational law, and we believe that the opinion’s \r\npublication should mark an end to discussions on \r\nKosovo’s status. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to reiterate the United \r\nKingdom’s sincere appreciation for the work of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice and to assure President \r\nOwada of the United Kingdom’s continued strong \r\nsupport for the important role played by the Court in \r\nthe international system. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nrepresentative of Serbia has requested to speak in \r\nexercise of the right of reply. May I remind her that \r\nstatements in the exercise of the right of reply are \r\nlimited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and to \r\n5 minutes for the second intervention, and should be \r\nmade by delegations from their seats. \r\n Mrs. Lalic Smajevic (Serbia): My delegation \r\nwould like to exercise its right of reply in response to \r\nthe statement that has just been made by the \r\nrepresentative of the United Kingdom and other \r\nremarks and comments on the Court’s advisory opinion \r\non Accordance with international law of the unilateral \r\ndeclaration of independence in respect of Kosovo. \r\n We believe that opening a debate on the Court’s \r\nopinion on an issue of great sensitivity and complexity \r\nin the light in which it was not meant to be understood \r\ncan only be counterproductive and misleading, not only \r\nin this case but in numerous similar cases of ethnically \r\nbased separatism in the world. \r\n Let me point out that the Court stated in \r\nparagraph 51 of the opinion that it took a “narrow” \r\napproach to the question of the General Assembly. The \r\nCourt in particular underlined that its advisory opinion \r\ndoes not deal with the legal consequences of the \r\nunilateral declaration of independence of Kosovo and \r\nthat it does not address the validity of the legal effects \r\nof the recognition of Kosovo by third States. \r\n It is precisely within this scope and meaning of \r\nthe question that the Court, in paragraph 84 of the \r\nadvisory opinion, stated that “the Court considers that \r\ngeneral international law contains no applicable \r\nprohibition of declarations of independence”. On that \r\nbasis, the Court concluded that the declaration of \r\nindependence of 17 February 2008 did not violate \r\ngeneral international law. \r\n Furthermore, it should be noted that the Court did \r\nnot consider that it was necessary to address such \r\nissues as whether or not the declaration has led to the \r\ncreation of a State or the status of the acts of \r\nrecognition in order to answer the question of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\n In this context, it should be noted that the Court \r\nclearly specified in paragraph 56 of the advisory \r\nopinion that the Court is not required by the question it \r\nhas been asked to take a position on whether \r\ninternational law confers a positive entitlement on \r\nKosovo to unilaterally declare its independence or a \r\nfortiori on whether international law generally confers \r\nan entitlement on entities situated within a State \r\nunilaterally to break away from it. \r\n The Court underlined that it is entirely possible \r\nfor a particular act, such as a unilateral declaration of \r\nindependence, not to be in violation of international \r\nlaw without necessarily constituting the exercise of a \r\nright conferred on it. Additionally, by its advisory \r\nopinion, the Court reaffirmed that both Security \r\nCouncil resolution 1244 (1999) and the Constitutional \r\nFramework of Kosovo promulgated by the Special \r\nA/65/PV.39  \r\n \r\n10-61026 10 \r\n \r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General are in force \r\nand continue to apply. \r\n With this in mind, it is clear that the province of \r\nKosovo remains a territory subject to an international \r\nregime whose final status is undetermined, since the \r\npolitical process designed to determine Kosovo’s \r\nfuture, envisaged in paragraph 11 (a) of resolution \r\n1244 (1999), has not run its course. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): May I \r\ntake it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to \r\nconclude its consideration of agenda item 70? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 73 \r\n \r\nReport of the International Criminal Court \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/65/313) \r\n \r\n  Report by the Secretary-General (A/65/315) \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I give \r\nthe floor to Mr. Sang-Hyun Song, President of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. \r\n Mr. Sang-Hyun Song: It is a great honour for me \r\nto address the General Assembly for the second time as \r\nthe President of the International Criminal Court (ICC) \r\nand to present the Court’s sixth annual report to this \r\nforum (see A/65/313). \r\n At the outset, I would like to offer my deepest \r\ncondolences to the Republic of Barbados on the \r\nuntimely passing of The Honourable Mr. David John \r\nHoward Thompson, the late Prime Minister of that \r\ngreat country. \r\n The past year has been very eventful for the \r\nCourt, including the first Review Conference of the \r\nRome Statute, the first arrest warrant issued for the \r\ncrime of genocide, the first situation brought to the \r\nCourt at the Prosecutor’s own initiative, the start of the \r\nsecond trial, and the voluntary appearance of three \r\nsuspects before the Court, as well as the first decision \r\ndeclining to confirm charges against a suspect. Since \r\nmy last briefing to the General Assembly (see \r\nA/64/PV.29), four more nations have joined the ICC, \r\nbringing the total number of States parties to 114. I \r\nwarmly welcome Bangladesh, Seychelles, Saint Lucia \r\nand Moldova into the ICC family of countries \r\ndedicated to justice and ending impunity. \r\n Despite the impressive progress that has been \r\nachieved, significant challenges remain before us, \r\nespecially with respect to the cooperation of States, \r\nwhich is the backbone of the ICC’s work. Since \r\nmembers have the Court’s report (see A/65/313) before \r\nthem, I will focus my remarks on a few key areas. \r\nFirst, I will discuss the landmark event of this year: the \r\nReview Conference of the Rome Statute held in \r\nKampala, Uganda. Secondly, I will give an update on \r\nthe activities of the Court, including a discussion of the \r\nchallenges posed by State cooperation and a review of \r\nour work with respect to victims. Thirdly, I will discuss \r\nprogress towards the global impact of the Rome \r\nStatute. \r\n The first Review Conference of the Rome Statute \r\nwas held from 31 May to 11 June in Kampala. In \r\naccordance with the Statute, the Review Conference \r\nwas convened by the Secretary-General. “The old era \r\nof impunity is over”, he said in his memorable opening \r\nspeech, and continued, “In its place, slowly but surely \r\nwe are witnessing the birth of a new age of \r\naccountability”. The main agenda item was the \r\npossible amending of the Rome Statute with respect to \r\nthe crime of aggression, which States were unable to \r\nagree upon at the Rome Conference in 1998. An \r\nagreement was reached on the last day with the \r\nadoption of a definition of the crime of aggression \r\nbased on General Assembly resolution 3314 (XXIX) of \r\n1974. The Court’s ability to exercise jurisdiction over \r\nthe crime of aggression will be subject to a new \r\ndecision to be taken by States parties after 1 January \r\n2017. \r\n A pledging ceremony and a stocktaking exercise \r\nwere held in Kampala, creating significant potential for \r\nfurther enhancing the effectiveness of the Rome Statute \r\nsystem. The three key areas that require continued \r\nattention are cooperation with the Court, strengthening \r\nnational jurisdictions under the principle of \r\ncomplementarity, and global ratification of the Rome \r\nStatute. The Review Conference was a powerful \r\nreminder of the strong connection between the United \r\nNations and the Court. Several high-level United \r\nNations officials participated in the stocktaking on \r\ninternational criminal justice in Kampala, drawing \r\nattention to the invaluable role that the United Nations \r\nplays in promoting the rule of law, peace and justice in \r\nthe world. \r\n Let me now proceed to the update on the \r\nactivities of the Court. Its first trial, that of Mr. Thomas \r\n A/65/PV.39\r\n \r\n11 10-61026 \r\n \r\nLubanga Dyilo, is approaching its conclusion. He is \r\ncharged with the recruitment of child soldiers under \r\n15 years of age into forces under his command and \r\nwith using them in hostilities in the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo. Mr. Lubanga’s defence began \r\npresenting its evidence on 7 January. \r\n The second trial before the Court started on \r\n24 November 2009. This is the case of Mr. Germain \r\nKatanga and Mr. Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui, two alleged \r\nformer military leaders charged with murder, rape, \r\nattacks on civilians, the use of children in hostilities \r\nand a number of other war crimes and crimes against \r\nhumanity allegedly committed in the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo. \r\n With respect to the situation in the Central \r\nAfrican Republic, Mr. Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo is \r\ncharged with murder, rape and pillage in his alleged \r\ncapacity as a military commander. His trial is now \r\nready to start, after the Appeals Chamber dismissed a \r\nchallenge last week to the admissibility of the case \r\nbefore the Court. The trial will begin on 22 November. \r\nThis decision is but one example of the growing body \r\nof jurisprudence that is fortifying the Court’s legal \r\nstability. \r\n In the situation in Darfur, the Sudan, which was \r\nreferred to the International Criminal Court by the \r\nSecurity Council, three people have appeared \r\nvoluntarily before the Court. In one case, that of \r\nMr. Bahr Idriss Abu Garda, the Pre-Trial Chamber \r\ndeclined to confirm the charges against the suspect. \r\nThis clearly demonstrates the total independence of the \r\njudges and the Office of the Prosecutor from each \r\nother. The hearing on the confirmation of charges \r\nagainst two other persons, Mr. Abdallah Banda \r\nAbakaer Nourain and Mr. Saleh Mohammed Jerbo \r\nJamus, is scheduled to commence on 8 December. \r\n A new investigation was opened during the past \r\nyear concerning the 2007 2008 post election violence \r\nin Kenya. Seven years after the ICC’s establishment, \r\nthis is the first situation brought to it at the \r\nProsecutor’s own initiative, with subsequent \r\nauthorization by the Pre-Trial Chamber. Of the other \r\nfour situations before the Court, three were referred by \r\nthe situation countries themselves, and one by the \r\nSecurity Council. \r\n Beyond the growing number of judicial \r\nproceedings unfolding in its courtrooms, the Prosecutor \r\nis continuing his investigations into the five situations \r\nbefore the Court. He publicly announced that he would \r\npresent two new cases in the Kenya situation before the \r\nend of this year. He is also proactively gathering and \r\nanalysing information on crimes that may have been \r\ncommitted within the jurisdiction of the Court in other \r\nsituations. The Prosecutor has publicly announced that \r\nhe is looking into situations concerning Colombia, \r\nGeorgia, Afghanistan, Côte d’Ivoire, Palestine and \r\nGuinea. \r\n Let me now turn to the question of cooperation \r\nwith the Court, which is of paramount importance to its \r\nability to fulfil its mandate. I am delighted to report \r\nthat less than three weeks ago, the French authorities \r\napprehended Mr. Callixte Mbarushimana, a Rwandan \r\ncitizen and alleged senior member of the armed group \r\nForces démocratiques de libération du Rwanda \r\n(FDLR), suspected of being criminally responsible for \r\na wide range of crimes against the civilian population \r\nin the Kivu region of the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo. His transfer to the seat of the Court is pending. \r\n The arrest of Mr. Mbarushimana was an excellent \r\nexample of multilateral collaboration leading to \r\nconcrete results in the pursuit of international justice. \r\nIn addition to France, cooperation was provided by \r\nother States parties, as well as non-parties, including \r\nGermany, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and \r\nRwanda. At the same time, the ICC Prosecutor \r\nprovided cooperation to the German authorities in their \r\ninvestigation of other alleged senior leaders of the \r\nFDLR who were arrested in Germany last year. This is \r\na clear example of positive complementarity in action. \r\n After years of continuous violence in the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, these latest \r\ndevelopments provide hope for more stability and the \r\nprevention of future crimes, which is the ultimate goal \r\nof the Rome Statute system. However, another \r\ncommander sought by the Court, Mr. Bosco Ntaganda, \r\nis still reported to be at large in Goma, allegedly \r\ncontributing to ongoing crimes. This arrest warrant \r\nmust be executed, and I call on all relevant actors to \r\ncooperate to that effect. \r\n In total, arrest warrants issued by the \r\nInternational Criminal Court are outstanding against \r\neight people. This is having a devastating effect on \r\nvictims and the communities affected by the crimes \r\nunder the Court’s jurisdiction. Four of those avoiding \r\njustice are alleged commanders of the Lord’s \r\nResistance Army sought in connection with the \r\nA/65/PV.39  \r\n \r\n10-61026 12 \r\n \r\nsituation in Uganda; the warrants for their arrest have \r\nbeen outstanding for more than five years. I urge the \r\ninternational community to intensify its efforts to bring \r\nthese people to justice. \r\n In the situation in Darfur, two arrest warrants \r\nhave been pending against Mr. Omar Hassan Ahmad \r\nAl-Bashir since the Pre-Trial Chamber in his case \r\nissued the first warrant for his arrest for genocide \r\nbefore the Court on 12 July. Lastly, the arrest warrants \r\nissued in 2007 against Mr. Ahmad Muhammad Harun \r\nand Ali Muhammad Ali Abd-Al-Rahman have still not \r\nbeen acted upon, and on 25 May the ICC Pre Trial \r\nChamber decided to refer the matter of the Sudan’s \r\nnon-compliance with its obligation to cooperate with \r\nthe Court to the Security Council. \r\n Additionally, in August, the ICC Pre-Trial \r\nChamber informed the Security Council and the ICC \r\nAssembly of States Parties, of Mr. Al-Bashir’s visits to \r\ntwo States parties, Kenya and Chad, despite the Court’s \r\noutstanding arrest warrants against him. The \r\ntransmittal of this question to the Security Council and \r\nthe Assembly of States Parties underlines the purely \r\njudicial nature of the Court, which is safeguarded by \r\nthe option to refer matters with potential political \r\nimplications to the appropriate political bodies for their \r\nconsideration. \r\n The situation with respect to the outstanding \r\narrest warrants is deeply troubling. As the Assembly \r\nknows, the ICC is completely reliant on State \r\ncooperation in the enforcement of its orders and \r\ndecisions. If States do not provide the cooperation \r\nnecessary for the Court’s functioning in accordance \r\nwith their legal obligations, the Court will not be able \r\nto fulfil its mandate and impunity will continue to \r\nflourish. \r\n The ICC’s engagement with victims is of \r\nunprecedented value and is steadily expanding. One of \r\nthe greatest innovations of the Rome Statute was to \r\nallow the participation of victims in the proceedings \r\neven when they are not called as witnesses. In the \r\ncountries where we have active cases, the ICC’s \r\noutreach programme communicates with the local \r\npopulation, informing victims of their rights and \r\nhelping communities generally understand the Court’s \r\nmandate and proceedings. \r\n We also have the Trust Fund for Victims, which \r\nwas established, pursuant to the Rome Statute, to \r\ncollect voluntary contributions and to administer \r\nreparations ordered by the Court as a result of its trials, \r\nas well as to provide physical and psychological \r\nrehabilitation and other support for the benefit of \r\nvictims and their families, even before judicial \r\nproceedings are concluded. This strikes me as a most \r\nimportant quality of the Trust Fund for Victims — the \r\nability, at a very early stage, to engage in support of the \r\nvictims of crimes in situations before the Court. \r\n At present, the Fund is reaching out to more than \r\n40,000 direct and many more indirect beneficiaries in \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, Northern \r\nUganda and, as of next year, the Central African \r\nRepublic. In Ituri, for example, the Fund has been \r\nsupporting an accelerated learning programme and a \r\nday-care centre for girls who have been abducted and \r\nraped and who have given birth while in captivity. For \r\nthese young women, their babies can be a source of \r\nstigma, an impediment to their education and a \r\nconstant economic burden. The Trust Fund-supported \r\nschool gives these girls a chance to regain the \r\neducation they lost while in captivity and to develop a \r\npositive bond with their children. \r\n This example demonstrates the unique role of the \r\nTrust Fund at the crossroads of international justice \r\nand humanitarian concern for victims, acknowledging \r\ntheir plight and restoring their human dignity. I \r\nconsider the actions of the Fund to be highly relevant \r\nto the ICC’s overall mission and worthy of the \r\ncontinued financial support of States and other donors. \r\n As the Secretary-General said at the opening of \r\nthe Review Conference, the ICC must have universal \r\nsupport if it is to become an effective deterrent. While \r\nit is remarkable that as many as 114 States from all \r\nregions of the globe have joined the Statute, the fact \r\nremains that large parts of the world’s population are \r\nfor the time being outside the protection offered by the \r\nICC system. \r\n I hope that non-States parties will consider \r\npossible ratification of the Statute with an open mind. \r\nThe lack of legal capacity should not be an obstacle for \r\nratification. Technical assistance for that purpose is \r\nwidely available from a variety of sources. Joining the \r\nICC not only sends out a strong signal of commitment \r\nto the rule of law, peace and justice, but it also gives \r\nthe State in question the right to participate fully in the \r\nICC’s work. Elections for the post of Prosecutor and \r\nsix vacancies for judges will be held in 2012; now \r\n A/65/PV.39\r\n \r\n13 10-61026 \r\n \r\nwould be an excellent time to join and shape the future \r\ncourse of the ICC’s development. \r\n Let me recall that the ICC is not intended to \r\nsubstitute for national justice systems. The Rome \r\nStatute makes it very clear that national criminal \r\njurisdictions have the primary responsibility for the \r\nprosecution of international crimes, the ICC being \r\nmerely a safety net. The domestic justice systems of \r\neach State should be so well equipped to deal with \r\ninternational crimes that they serve as the main \r\ndeterrent worldwide. This, I believe, is an objective \r\nshared by all States, whether they are parties to the \r\nRome Statute or not. \r\n The Review Conference created significant \r\nmomentum for broadening and deepening the Statute’s \r\ninfluence with respect to national jurisdictions, but that \r\nis merely the beginning. Far more needs to be done, \r\nand I am glad to see discussion starting on the \r\nmainstreaming of Rome Statute issues into rule of law \r\nand judicial reform capacity-building. The United \r\nNations is uniquely placed to facilitate that process. \r\n Another momentous year is behind us, and the \r\nICC has continued its progress on many fronts. This \r\nwould not have been possible without the relentless \r\ncommitment of the international community, for which \r\nI am deeply grateful. Let us continue to build on our \r\nshared values so that we may move a step closer to \r\neradicating impunity for the gravest crimes of concern \r\nto all of humanity. Member States should embrace the \r\nICC — it is their court. \r\n Mr. Grauls (Belgium) (spoke in French): I have \r\nthe honour to speak on behalf of the European Union. \r\nThe candidate countries Croatia and the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia; the countries of the \r\nStabilization and Association Process and potential \r\ncandidates Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and \r\nMontenegro; and the Republic of Moldova, Ukraine \r\nand Georgia align themselves with this statement. The \r\nEuropean Union thanks the International Criminal \r\nCourt (ICC) for its sixth annual report to the United \r\nNations covering the period 1 August 2009 to 31 July \r\n2010 (see A/65/313). \r\n This year, four new States from four different \r\ncontinents — Bangladesh, Seychelles, Saint Lucia and \r\nthe Republic of Moldova — joined the circle of States \r\nparties to the Rome Statute, bringing that number to \r\n114. The European Union welcomes the new members \r\nand pledges to continue its efforts to achieve \r\nuniversality and preserve the integrity of the Rome \r\nStatute. \r\n During the period under consideration, the ICC \r\nlaunched an investigation into a new situation, that of \r\nKenya; it conducted three trials; and in relation to the \r\nsituation in Darfur, it took a decision declining to \r\nconfirm charges against a suspect, organized the \r\nvoluntary appearance of two other suspects, and issued \r\na second arrest warrant for President Al-Bashir on \r\ncharges of crimes of genocide. \r\n Moreover, the Prosecutor initiated preliminary \r\ninvestigations into several incidents that the \r\ninternational community had forcefully condemned, \r\nincluding the atrocities committed on 28 September \r\n2009 in Conakry, Republic of Guinea. Despite certain \r\ndifficulties, the past year has seen the Court make fresh \r\nprogress towards meeting the hope placed in it by the \r\nStates parties and the victims of the most serious \r\ncrimes. \r\n In the year of the reporting period, the first \r\nReview Conference of the Rome Statute was convened \r\nfrom 31 May to 11 June in Kampala by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his capacity as depositary of the Rome \r\nStatute. The European Union thanks the Ugandan \r\nauthorities and commends their efforts in organizing \r\nthat event in their country. The warm welcome and the \r\npositive and constructive spirit manifested by all \r\ndelegations present were certainly instrumental to its \r\nsuccess. \r\n The Kampala Conference successfully concluded \r\nits discussions on three amendments to the Rome \r\nStatute: the first on article 124, the second aimed at \r\nextending the Court’s jurisdiction over war crimes in \r\nsituations of non-international armed conflict, and the \r\nthird on the crime of aggression. The European Union \r\ncommends the spirit of consensus that has prevailed \r\nand has enabled a final agreement to be reached. We \r\ncan now say that the work initiated in Rome has finally \r\nreached fruition. \r\n Furthermore, the first Review Conference of the \r\nRome Statute was a major milestone that provided a \r\nforum for the States, international organizations and \r\nrepresentatives of civil society in attendance in \r\nKampala to reaffirm their resolve to promote the \r\nStatute, make specific pledges to that end and submit \r\nthemselves to a stocktaking of international criminal \r\njustice. That stocktaking addressed four fundamental \r\nissues in the Rome Statute system and culminated in \r\nA/65/PV.39  \r\n \r\n10-61026 14 \r\n \r\nthe adoption of two resolutions and a declaration. It \r\nalso clearly identified the areas on which we ought to \r\nconcentrate our efforts. \r\n Nevertheless, the recent report of the ICC, while \r\ncommendable insofar as it describes the efforts the \r\nCourt has made in fulfilling its mission, raises serious \r\nquestions. The number of acts of violence that continue \r\nto be perpetrated, in particular against women and \r\nchildren and including in country situations of which \r\nthe ICC is seized, is extremely worrying. The \r\ninternational community must concentrate its efforts to \r\nensure that the Court is effective in punishing those \r\ncrimes and preventing them in the future. \r\n In that regard, we should recall one of the \r\nfundamental principles of the Rome Statute, namely, \r\ncomplementarity, according to which it falls first and \r\nforemost to each State to investigate and prosecute the \r\npresumed perpetrators of the most serious crimes \r\nagainst the international community. The Court may \r\nexercise its powers only in the event that a State is \r\nunable or unwilling to do so. The European Union and \r\nits member States are determined to carry out their \r\ncommitments to that end for the effective \r\nimplementation of the Rome Statute. \r\n The Court’s report underlines, in particular, the \r\nneed to reinforce our collective and individual efforts \r\nto ensure that the international arrest warrants issued \r\nby it are enforced. Particularly in that regard, the \r\nEuropean Union also recalls that Security Council \r\nresolution 1593 (2005) imposed obligations on a \r\nnon-State party, namely, the Sudan, to cooperate with \r\nthe Court. The European Union regrets the \r\ninfringements by the Sudan of its international \r\nobligations and commends the reaffirmation by the \r\nKampala Review Conference of the need for all States \r\nparties to fully meet their obligations under Part 9 of \r\nthe Rome Statute. Accordingly, it expresses its concern \r\nabout the difficulties raised by certain States parties in \r\nrelation to the enforcement of those obligations. \r\n Unless all the stakeholders in the international \r\ncommunity, ranging from States, whether parties or \r\nnot, to international organizations to civil society, put \r\nup a united fight, the objectives of the Rome Statute, \r\nand more generally, the purposes and principles of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter aimed at promoting \r\ninternational peace, security and international well-\r\nbeing will not be achieved. Despots will continue to \r\nlive in impunity and use their influence to continue \r\ntheir activities unchallenged. As for the victims, they \r\ncan only hope that justice will be done and that they \r\nwill receive some form of compensation. \r\n The support that the Court receives from the \r\nUnited Nations is broadly described in the Court’s \r\nreport. The European Union welcomes that support and \r\ncalls on other international organizations to follow that \r\nexample by stepping and formalizing their cooperation. \r\n The European Union and its member States \r\nundertake for their part to pursue their efforts in the \r\narea of the fight against impunity, in particular by \r\ngiving the Court all the diplomatic support it needs and \r\nby continuing dialogue with its different partners to \r\nclear up any misunderstandings and dispel any \r\nconcerns. The European Union has been relentless in \r\nits efforts to date and undertakes to pursue them. \r\n Mr. Kapambwe (Zambia): Let me begin by \r\nconveying the condolences of my Government to the \r\nGovernment of Barbados on the recent passing of the \r\nPrime Minister and to the Government of Argentina on \r\nthe passing of the former President. \r\n At the outset, the African States parties to the \r\nRome Statute wish to affirm their support for the fight \r\nagainst impunity and assert that those who are \r\nimplicated in the most serious crimes must be brought \r\nto account. We are committed to the universality of the \r\nRome Statute and call on all States to ratify it. \r\n The African States parties welcome the sixth \r\nannual report of the International Criminal Court (ICC) \r\nas submitted to the United Nations in document \r\nA/65/313. \r\n The first-ever Review Conference of the Rome \r\nStatute of the ICC, which took place in Kampala from \r\n31 May to 11 June 2010, can be seen as a critical \r\nmilestone in the evolution of international criminal \r\njustice, as it amended the Rome Statute to include a \r\ndefinition of the crime of aggression and the conditions \r\nunder which the Court could exercise jurisdiction with \r\nrespect to that crime. The Kampala Review Conference \r\nshould also be seen as a continuation of the legacy of \r\nRome, as we, States parties, continue to strive for a \r\nmore humane world in which we do not commit \r\nheinous crimes against one another and in which we \r\ncan impose severe sentences on those who breach the \r\nminimum standards of treatment that we have set for \r\nourselves. \r\n A/65/PV.39\r\n \r\n15 10-61026 \r\n \r\n Turning to the issue of cooperation, we concur \r\nwith those who say that the fact that all five of the \r\nCourt’s current situations are in Africa, three of which \r\nwere self-referrals, is not a negative reflection on the \r\ncontinent. On the contrary, it illustrates the high regard \r\nthat those States have for the protection and promotion \r\nof the rule of law in that they have availed themselves \r\nof the judicial assistance provided by the Court in \r\ncases which, owing to their complexity and/or political \r\nsensitivity, lend themselves to being better dealt with \r\nby the Court. \r\n But we also need to avoid the perception of \r\nseeing the ICC as targeting Africa. A central complaint \r\nby some African officials is that the ICC’s exclusive \r\nfocus on investigations in Africa to date suggests that \r\nthe Court is unfairly targeting Africa. But this \r\ncomplaint should not obscure the consistent, active \r\nbacking for the ICC among African Governments and \r\ncivil society across the continent. \r\n It is well known that African Governments were \r\nactively involved in establishing the ICC. More \r\nimportantly, more States are parties to the Court in \r\nAfrica than in any other region. This August, yet \r\nanother African State, the Seychelles, ratified the Rome \r\nStatute, bringing the number of African States that \r\nhave done so to 31. In addition, at the first Review \r\nConference of the ICC in May and June in Kampala, \r\nAfrican Governments reinforced strong African support \r\nfor the Court’s work. African States parties participated \r\nactively, often represented by high-level officials, and \r\nmade strong statements in support of the work of the \r\nCourt. \r\n However, we should bear in mind that much of \r\nthe African Union’s concern with regard to the ICC \r\nrelates to the Security Council’s inaction. The African \r\nUnion has premised its call for non-cooperation with \r\nthe ICC on the Security Council’s ignoring its July \r\n2008 request to defer the case against President \r\nAl-Bashir of the Sudan. Even among officials who \r\nstrongly support the ICC concern has mounted that the \r\nSecurity Council has shown disrespect for the African \r\nUnion by failing to respond either positively or \r\nnegatively to its deferral request. Resolution of this \r\nissue is the only way to facilitate cooperation between \r\nthe African Union and the ICC. \r\n In the light of the foregoing, we implore all \r\nstakeholders to become activists and urge the Security \r\nCouncil to respond to the request by the African Union. \r\nThe integrity of the Court and even that of the Security \r\nCouncil itself is at stake. \r\n The important role played by international \r\ncriminal justice as embodied in the work of the Court \r\nand similar criminal tribunals, such as the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda, the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the \r\nSpecial Court for Sierra Leone, in establishing respect \r\nfor the rule of law, thus bringing about peace, order \r\nand stability in conflict-torn societies, is one of the \r\ngreatest achievements of our time. \r\n The African States parties welcome the efforts \r\nmade by the Court to further implement its strategic \r\nplan and to foster cooperation with States and \r\ninternational and regional organizations. Those steps \r\nare vital, if the activities of the Court are to be \r\nunderstood and appreciated by the diverse \r\nconstituencies that it was created to serve. In that \r\nregard, the African States parties reiterate their \r\ncommitment to the objectives of the ICC and call for \r\nthe establishment of a suitable mechanism to enhance \r\ncooperation between the Court and States parties. \r\n On the issue of geographical representation and \r\ngender balance in the recruitment of ICC staff, the \r\nAfrican States parties would like to see that nationals \r\nof all States parties are given equal opportunity to work \r\nat the Court. The system of recruitment should not be \r\nbased on how much a State party contributes to the \r\nCourt, since the Court is an independent judicial \r\ninstitution. It is worth noting that all the situations that \r\nthe Prosecutor is now handling are situated in the \r\nterritories of least developed countries. It must \r\ntherefore be ensured that those countries are adequately \r\nrepresented at senior levels in the Court. Justice must \r\nnot only be done, it must be seen to be done. \r\nTherefore, the ICC, being at the peak of criminal \r\njustice globally, should be seen to be fair, not only in \r\nits decisions, but also in its recruitment policies. \r\n The African States parties will continue to \r\ncooperate and support the ICC and call on all States \r\nparties to identify well-qualified personnel for \r\nappointment to the bench and other positions of the \r\nCourt, which would enhance the efficiency of the \r\nCourt. The Court must remain independent and free \r\nfrom any kind of political interference, so that its \r\ndecisions can in turn be universally respected. \r\n Mr. Charles (Trinidad and Tobago): First of all, \r\nwe wish to express our appreciation to those \r\nA/65/PV.39  \r\n \r\n10-61026 16 \r\n \r\ndelegations that offered words of condolence on the \r\ndeath of the Prime Minister of Barbados and join \r\nothers in expressing our own condolences to the \r\ndelegation of Argentina on the death of its former \r\nPresident. \r\n I have the honour of speaking today on behalf of \r\nthe States members of the Caribbean Community \r\n(CARICOM) that are parties to the Rome Statute of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC). We commend the \r\nPresident of the Court for the presentation of his \r\ncomprehensive report prepared under article 6 of the \r\nRelationship Agreement between the United Nations \r\nand the ICC (see A/65/313). CARICOM States parties \r\nview the report as an important instrument to convey \r\nessential information on the activities of the Court \r\nduring the preceding year, not only for the benefit of \r\nStates parties, but also for the benefit of the wider \r\nmembership of the United Nations. \r\n During the reporting period, States parties and \r\nothers witnessed the hosting in Kampala of the Review \r\nConference of the Rome Statute, a landmark occasion \r\nthat was eagerly anticipated. It provided an opportunity \r\nfor States parties and other entities to recommit \r\nthemselves to the principles that led to the adoption \r\nand conclusion of the Rome Statute and the \r\nestablishment of the Court. \r\n CARICOM States parties were represented at the \r\nConference both at the level of States parties and \r\nsignatory States and through the CARICOM \r\nsecretariat. Our representation was a demonstration of \r\nour resolve to assist the Court in its mandate to \r\nprosecute those alleged to have committed grave \r\ncrimes under the Rome Statute and to contribute to the \r\npromotion and maintenance of international peace and \r\njustice. \r\n The Conference also provided an ideal forum for \r\nengaging in an exercise of stocktaking with regard to \r\ninternational criminal justice. We found the exchanges \r\non the issue of cooperation to be very useful. For us, \r\nthe principle of cooperation is essential to the long-\r\nterm success and survival of the Court. Without the \r\ncooperation of States parties and others in areas such as \r\nwitness protection, enforcement of sentences, and most \r\nimportantly, the execution of outstanding arrest \r\nwarrants, the Court will be unable to bring to justice \r\nthe principal offenders who commit genocide, war \r\ncrimes and crimes against humanity. CARICOM States \r\nparties were thus encouraged that among the many \r\npledges made at the Conference were the expressions \r\nof the willingness of States and others to cooperate \r\nwith the Court. We hope that those pledges will be \r\nfulfilled as soon as possible. \r\n Pursuant to the provisions of articles 121 and 123 \r\nof the Statute, the Conference considered proposals for \r\namendments submitted by States parties. It was \r\ngratifying to witness the exchange of views in both the \r\nplenary and the informal sessions of the Conference on \r\nthe various proposals. CARICOM States parties and \r\nobservers were satisfied with the open and transparent \r\nmanner in which the consultations were conducted. As \r\nstrong supporters of the rule of law at both the national \r\nand the international levels, we welcomed the \r\namendment to article 8, paragraph 2(e), of the Rome \r\nStatute. It is our view that that amendment has \r\nstrengthened existing international humanitarian law, \r\nand we therefore pay tribute to the delegation of \r\nBelgium for proposing that very timely amendment. \r\n Since the beginnings of the discussions on the \r\nICC, CARICOM has been encouraged by the \r\nwillingness of participants to work in a spirit of \r\ncompromise. Consequently, while we were among the \r\nadvocates for the removal of article 124 of the Statute, \r\nwe recognized that the decision on that topic was \r\nreached after tremendous debate and in a spirit of \r\ncompromise. Nevertheless, it is our expectation that, \r\nwhen the matter is reviewed in 2015, States parties will \r\nrecognize that provision as being anachronistic, \r\ntantamount to a reservation, and will therefore agree to \r\nits deletion. \r\n In 1998 at the Rome Diplomatic Conference on \r\nthe ICC, States parties agreed to include the crime of \r\naggression under article 5 of the Statute but did not \r\nagree on a definition of the crime and the conditions \r\nunder which the Court would be able to exercise \r\njurisdiction of that crime. The matter was left to a \r\nfuture event. That event was the Kampala Review \r\nConference, which ended a process that included the \r\nwork of the Special Working Group on the Crime of \r\nAggression, the intersessional meetings at Princeton \r\nUniversity as well as other forums. \r\n After exhaustive discussions spanning many \r\nyears on the utility, practicality or timing of the \r\nadoption of a definition of the crime of aggression, a \r\nbreakthrough was achieved at the Review Conference. \r\nWhile some delegations remain dissatisfied with the \r\noutcome and ask whether we have arrived at a less than \r\n A/65/PV.39\r\n \r\n17 10-61026 \r\n \r\nperfect solution, CARICOM States parties are satisfied \r\nthat the Rome Statute has been duly amended through \r\nthe relevant provisions of articles 8 bis, 15 bis, and \r\n15 ter. More importantly, article 5, paragraph 2, has \r\nbeen deleted forever. The Statute now provides a \r\ndefinition of the crime of aggression and for State party \r\nreferral, proprio motu investigation by the Prosecutor, \r\nas well as Security Council referral. In our view, that \r\nrepresents a true spirit of compromise and a reflection \r\nof the mood of the international community at this \r\ntime. \r\n The success achieved in Uganda was due not only \r\nto the willingness of States parties to compromise, but \r\nalso to the skill employed by the President of the \r\nAssembly of States parties, Ambassador Christian \r\nWenaweser, and his team, which included Prince Zeid \r\nRa’ad Zeid Al-Hussein, now the Permanent \r\nRepresentative to the United Nations of the Hashemite \r\nKingdom of Jordan. We, as CARICOM States parties, \r\nawait the convening in 2017 of the meeting at which \r\nStates parties, following the prescribed procedure, will \r\ndecide whether to activate the jurisdiction of the Court \r\nover the crime of aggression pursuant to the \r\namendment that was adopted at the Review \r\nConference. \r\n The Court is at a critical point in its short life. We \r\ncontinue to observe the judicial proceedings, which are \r\nbeing conducted in keeping with the highest traditions \r\nof due process, the relevant provisions of the Rome \r\nStatute and other rules. We must continue to offer our \r\nsupport and protection to the ICC. Such protection is \r\nessential to ward off often unnecessary criticisms on \r\nthe part of its detractors. That support should not only \r\nbe based on our legal obligations but should also be \r\nderived from the commitment by all United Nations \r\nMember States to end impunity. \r\n CARICOM States parties will continue to work \r\nfor the universalization of the Rome Statute. During \r\nthe past year we were elated that a Member State, Saint \r\nLucia, became the latest CARICOM State party to the \r\nRome Statute. \r\n It is our expectation that all CARICOM States \r\nwill, in the near future, become parties to the Rome \r\nStatute and complete this most important dream that \r\nwas begun in 1989 by my former Prime Minister, \r\nMr. Arthur Napoleon Robinson. \r\n Mr. McNee (Canada): I have the honour to speak \r\ntoday on behalf of the CANZ group, namely, Canada, \r\nAustralia and New Zealand. Before speaking on the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC), may I offer the \r\ncondolences of that group on the sad passing of former \r\nPresident Kirchner to the Government of Argentina. \r\n The year 2010 has been a significant one for the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. Earlier this year, \r\ndelegations from States parties, observer States, \r\ninternational organizations and civil society, as well as \r\nofficials from other international courts and tribunals, \r\nmet in Kampala for the first Review Conference of the \r\nRome Statute. The delegations participated in a \r\nstocktaking event that gathered the world’s experts on \r\ninternational criminal justice for a frank and sincere \r\ndiscussion on the topics of cooperation, \r\ncomplementarity, victims and affected communities, \r\nand peace and justice. We hope to see appropriate and \r\ncontinued follow up on those themes over the coming \r\nyears. \r\n States parties at the Review Conference also \r\nworked in a spirit of compromise with the aim of \r\nstrengthening the Court and improving the \r\ninternational criminal justice system. They adopted, by \r\nconsensus, amendments to article 8 of the Statute, as \r\nwell as provisions on the crime of aggression. The \r\nadoption of the provisions on the crime of aggression \r\nmarked the culmination of years of discussion and \r\nreflects the strong desire of States parties to \r\noperationalize the Court’s jurisdiction in a practical \r\nand balanced manner. \r\n States parties at the Review Conference also \r\nendorsed the Kampala Declaration, reaffirming their \r\ncommitment to the basic principles of the Rome Statute \r\nand the role of the International Criminal Court in a \r\nmultilateral system that aims to end impunity, establish \r\nthe rule of law, promote and encourage respect for \r\nhuman rights and achieve sustainable peace. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n It has become trite to say that the Court cannot \r\neffectively accomplish its mandate without the \r\nnecessary cooperation from States parties and others. \r\nThis past year has witnessed both accomplishments and \r\nchallenges in the sphere of cooperation. \r\n Just weeks ago, authorities in France successfully \r\napprehended Callixte Mbarushimana, pursuant to a \r\nsealed warrant of arrest issued by the Court. Canada, \r\nAustralia and New Zealand welcome that arrest and \r\ncommend France for the actions that it has undertaken. \r\nA/65/PV.39  \r\n \r\n10-61026 18 \r\n \r\nWe further welcome the cooperation shown in that \r\narrest by the Democratic Republic of the Congo and \r\nother States in the region as a concrete example of their \r\ncommitment to justice. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\n The situation in the eastern provinces of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo is alarming. The \r\nuse of sexual violence as a weapon of war and as a tool \r\nin the systematic intimidation and control of local \r\npopulations must be stopped. Canada, Australia and \r\nNew Zealand call upon all parties involved to take the \r\nnecessary steps to prevent the commission of such \r\ncrimes and to protect civilian populations. Ensuring \r\ncriminal accountability for the perpetrators is a crucial \r\nelement in stopping those crimes. Those who are \r\nresponsible must be brought to justice, and that \r\nincludes not only direct perpetrators, but also those \r\nwho are responsible for planning and coordinating such \r\nreprehensible attacks. \r\n In that regard, Canada, Australia and New \r\nZealand are also encouraged by the arrest of Sadoke \r\nKokunda Mayele by United Nations and Congolese \r\nforces and urge the Democratic Republic of the Congo \r\nto continue, and to enhance, its cooperation with both \r\nthe United Nations and the Court. Where necessary, the \r\nICC can play a vital role in investigating and \r\nprosecuting those who bear the greatest responsibility \r\nfor the commission of serious crimes. We also urge the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo to pursue domestic \r\navenues of investigation and prosecution for other \r\nperpetrators. \r\n We hold out hope that such recent developments \r\nmay prove to be a basis for complementarity in action, \r\nwith a coordinated response between the ICC, the \r\nUnited Nations, national authorities, regional actors \r\nand the international community as whole. It has \r\nbecome clear that all of those entities must work \r\ntogether to ensure accountability and to bring justice to \r\nvictims. \r\n While the recent arrests in relation to crimes \r\ncommitted in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \r\nare encouraging, we must also acknowledge that \r\ncooperation has been lacking in relation to other cases \r\nand situations. The arrest warrant for Bosco Ntaganda \r\nremains outstanding, as do the four arrest warrants for \r\nthe leaders of the Lord’s Resistance Army. \r\n With regard to the arrest warrants that have been \r\nissued in the Darfur situation, namely, for Ahmad \r\nHarun, Ali Kushayb and President Omar Al-Bashir, we \r\ncontinue to call upon States parties to fulfil their legal \r\nobligations under the Rome Statute to cooperate with \r\nthe Court in the execution of those warrants. Canada, \r\nAustralia and New Zealand also note the obligation to \r\ncooperate with the Court under Security Council \r\nresolution 1593 (2005) and urge, more broadly, all \r\nStates and relevant regional organizations to cooperate \r\nfully with the Court. \r\n The early jurisprudence of the Court has \r\ndemonstrated that the rights of the accused are being \r\nprotected at both the procedural and the substantive \r\nlevels. The legitimate place to contest charges is before \r\nthe Court itself, and not in the political arena. \r\n Looking forward, Canada, Australia and New \r\nZealand anticipate that the upcoming ninth Assembly \r\nof States Parties will be a fruitful meeting. We \r\nanticipate further discussions on the administrative \r\nissues of budget and governance. In that respect, we \r\nunderline the important role of the Assembly in \r\nproviding oversight and guidance on those matters as \r\nprescribed by the Rome Statute. The Court and the \r\nAssembly must continue to work together \r\nconstructively with a view to establishing and \r\nmaintaining the framework of a permanent, \r\nindependent institution that has the respect and \r\nconfidence of the international community. \r\n Mr. Park In-Kook (Republic of Korea): At the \r\noutset, I should like to express our special recognition \r\nto President Judge Sang-Hyun Song and the other staff \r\nof the International Criminal Court (ICC) for their \r\noutstanding efforts and achievements in making the \r\nCourt function on a broad track. Through their work \r\nand dedication, the ICC has made a significant \r\ncontribution to the attainment of the goals envisioned \r\nin the Rome Statute. The Republic of Korea welcomes \r\nthe four new members and hopes that the new members \r\nwill help to promote the universality of the Court and \r\nthe integrity of the Rome Statute. \r\n I should like to commend the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport (see A/65/313), which highlights the Court’s \r\nmost important work over the past year. Thus far, the \r\nCourt has made notable achievements through its \r\ninvolvement in five situations, namely, in Uganda, the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, the Central African \r\nRepublic, Kenya and the Sudan. \r\n A/65/PV.39\r\n \r\n19 10-61026 \r\n \r\n This year, we witnessed another historic moment \r\nwith the Review Conference in Kampala, where we \r\nsuccessfully amended several provisions and discussed \r\nkey issues for future implementation. The success of \r\nthe Review Conference is proof that the ICC has left its \r\nfledgling stage and is now entering an era of full-scale \r\ndevelopment. \r\n I would like to take this opportunity to welcome \r\nthe new judges, Silvia Alejandra Fernández de \r\nGurmendi and Kuniko Ozaki. We believe that the \r\nnewly appointed judges will make a remarkable \r\ncontribution, building on the progress made to date. \r\n I would like to comment on the proceedings \r\nregarding the situation in the Congo. Since the first \r\nICC arrest warrant was issued and sealed by Pre Trial \r\nChamber I in early spring 2006, the Lubanga trial has \r\nexperienced several short suspensions. I hope that, \r\nbased on the assessments made so far, the ICC will be \r\nable to proceed with Lubanga and other cases, and thus \r\nmove forward effectively with the deliberate speed of \r\ninternational criminal justice. \r\n I would like to cite another case, that relating to \r\nthe situation in Darfur, where international cooperation \r\nis still needed, despite Security Council resolution \r\n1593 (2005) and legal obligations under the Rome \r\nStatute. In that context, I would like to draw the \r\nAssembly’s attention to the importance of gathering \r\npolitical will in order to further the work of the ICC. \r\n I would also like to commend the ICC for \r\nproviding substantial assistance to the Special Court \r\nfor Sierra Leone from its inception up until today. That \r\nshows that the ICC may be on its way to becoming a \r\ncentral hub for international tribunals in the future. For \r\nthat purpose, further communication and coordination \r\nbetween the Court and the Special Tribunals is \r\nrequired. \r\n Beyond all scepticism and frustration, the ICC \r\nwas established to enshrine the hopes of the \r\ninternational community for justice. We are very \r\npleased by the progress the Court has arduously made \r\ntowards that goal. The Republic of Korea will continue \r\nto be a strong supporter of the ICC as it solidifies its \r\nplace as an important international mechanism and the \r\nsole permanent criminal court. \r\n Mr. Sumi (Japan): I would like to thank Mr. Sang-\r\nHyun Song for his in depth report on the most recent \r\nwork of the International Criminal Court (ICC) (see \r\nA/65/313), as well as to congratulate the Court on its \r\nincreasingly important role in the fight against impunity \r\nin the international community. \r\n The ICC was established in 2002 as the first \r\npermanent international criminal court in the history of \r\nthe world, to which any State party or the Security \r\nCouncil could decide to refer a situation. Since the \r\nestablishment of the Court, eight years ago, three \r\nStates parties — namely, Uganda, the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo and the Central African \r\nRepublic — have referred their respective situations to \r\nthe ICC. The Security Council has referred one \r\nsituation — that of Darfur, the Sudan — to the Court. \r\nIn addition, the Prosecutor has initiated an \r\ninvestigation on the Kenyan situation. That progress \r\nshows that the ICC is on a path of growth. Today, we \r\nwould like to raise several points on the work of the \r\nICC. \r\n First, one of the most important principles to be \r\nkept in mind is that of complementarity. Every State \r\nhas a duty to exercise its criminal jurisdiction over \r\nthose responsible for the most serious crimes. The role \r\nof the ICC is complementary to such national criminal \r\njurisdictions. States parties must do their best to \r\nexercise their national jurisdiction over a situation \r\nbefore referring it to the ICC. \r\n Secondly, the experience of the ICC, although \r\nrelatively short, has reaffirmed the importance of \r\ncooperation by States. In those cases in which full \r\ncooperation has been extended by the States concerned, \r\nthe ICC is making steady progress. Where such \r\ncooperation has not been forthcoming, the ICC is faced \r\nwith serious challenges. Cooperation by States with the \r\nICC is therefore essential for the effective investigation \r\nand prosecution of cases by the Court, in particular as \r\nregards the arrest and surrender of suspects and the \r\ncollection of evidence. \r\n Thirdly, Japan would like to emphasize the \r\nimportance of efficient and effective administration of \r\nthe Court. In that regard, Japan is of the view that \r\nStates parties should seek to clarify the responsibilities \r\nof the different organs of the Court and the relationship \r\nbetween the Court and the Assembly of States Parties, \r\nas well as the judicial procedure of the Court. \r\n Fourthly, it is indeed a matter of historic \r\nsignificance that we achieved the codification of the \r\ncrime of aggression at the Rome Statute Review \r\nConference, held in Kampala this year. In order to \r\nA/65/PV.39  \r\n \r\n10-61026 20 \r\n \r\nmake that success legally stable, we must continue our \r\nefforts to avoid, to the maximum extent possible, legal \r\nambiguity in the amendments adopted, taking into \r\naccount the nature of international criminal justice, \r\nwhich requires strict legal rigour. \r\n Finally, let me return to the matter of the \r\nuniversality of the membership of the Rome Statute. As \r\na result of the recent ratifications by Saint Lucia, \r\nSeychelles and Moldova, 114 States are currently \r\nparties to the Rome Statute. Japan is pleased to see the \r\nsteady increase in the number of States parties. In order \r\nto enhance the role of the ICC in the international \r\ncommunity, however, the Court’s membership should \r\nbe universal. It is therefore important that more States \r\nbecome parties to the Rome Statue, especially States in \r\nthe Asian region, where the number of States parties is \r\nmuch lower than in other regions. \r\n In March 2010, Japan co sponsored a round-table \r\nmeeting of legal experts with the Government of \r\nMalaysia and the Asian-African Legal Consultative \r\nOrganization in Putrajaya, Malaysia, that included an \r\ninaugural address by Judge Kuniko Ozaki. At that \r\nmeeting, the Republic of Korea, Kenya and Japan \r\nshared with non-party States their experiences in \r\nratifying the Rome Statute. Japan will continue its \r\nefforts to increase the number of States parties, in \r\nparticular from the Asian region, with a view to \r\nachieving the universality of the ICC. \r\n Japan sincerely hopes that the points it has raised \r\ntoday will be given serious consideration by the ICC, \r\nStates parties, other States and civil society in order to \r\nfoster an ICC that is more efficient, effective, universal \r\nand systematically sustainable. \r\n In conclusion, let me express the sincere \r\nappreciation of Japan for the work that the ICC has \r\naccomplished to date. It is our hope that the Court will \r\ncontinue to work diligently in the fight against \r\nimpunity and consolidate its credibility and reputation. \r\nIn that regard, Japan is determined to continue and \r\nstrengthen its contribution to the ICC, and thereby to \r\nthe establishment of the rule of law throughout the \r\ninternational community. \r\n Ms. Gendi (Egypt): At the outset, I would like to \r\nexpress Egypt’s appreciation to the President of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) for submitting the \r\nreport under consideration today (see A/65/313). I \r\nwould also like to thank the Court for playing an \r\nimportant role in the development of international \r\ncriminal law concepts to address heinous crimes \r\ncommitted against peoples and societies. \r\n International criminal tribunals are becoming \r\nincreasingly important in the enforcement of the rule of \r\nlaw — in particular with regard to international law, \r\ninternational humanitarian law and human rights law \r\n— with a view to maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity. The role of the ICC should be complementary \r\nto that of national judiciaries, which have inherent \r\njurisdiction to prosecute citizens who commit such \r\ncrimes. That emanates from the principle of the \r\nresponsibility of a State to ensure the safety and \r\nsecurity of its citizens. It also flows from the fact that \r\nsovereignty equals responsibility — the responsibility \r\nof every nation and Government to protect their people \r\nfrom crimes. \r\n Against that backdrop, Egypt is of the view that \r\nthere is an increasing need to adhere to the established \r\nnorm of international law by which the implementation \r\nof a convention is conditioned by a State’s accession \r\nthereto. States should therefore not be obligated to \r\nfollow the provisions of the Rome Statute if they have \r\nnot of their own free will explicitly accepted to do so. \r\nObliging States to act otherwise constitutes a violation \r\nof the principle of pacta sunt servanda and is \r\nincompatible with the concept of State sovereignty and \r\nthe freedom of States to choose the treaties to which \r\nthey become party. \r\n In the same vein, the delegation of Egypt takes \r\nnote of the outcomes of the Review Conference of the \r\nRome Statute, convened from 31 May to 11 June in \r\nKampala, at which States parties made significant \r\npledges on a wide range of issues. One of those was to \r\narrive at a definition of the crime of aggression, taking \r\ninto account the importance of the issue, especially as \r\ncircumstances and developments on the international \r\nscene point to the need to establish such a definition. \r\nThat will enable the Court to exercise its jurisdiction \r\nover that crime in the same way that it does over the \r\nother crimes falling within its jurisdiction. \r\n The Court can also benefit from the ongoing \r\ndiscussions in the International Law Commission on \r\nthe immunity of State officials from foreign criminal \r\njurisdiction, with a view to enriching the dialogue and \r\nexchange of views between international legal and \r\njudicial bodies working in the framework of \r\nmultilateralism. That should serve to enhance \r\n A/65/PV.39\r\n \r\n21 10-61026 \r\n \r\nconformity and complementarity in the work of those \r\nbodies. \r\n The delegation of Egypt also stresses the \r\nimportance of the International Criminal Court’s \r\ncontinued pursuit of a balanced approach in its work by \r\nadopting a policy that accentuates its judicial nature \r\nand avoids the politicization of its work, so as to \r\nensure its impartiality and independence and to allow it \r\nto meet its legal and moral obligations. \r\n In that regard, Egypt reaffirms the importance of \r\nthe Court remaining strictly transparent. It should also \r\nrefrain from recourse to confidential lists of names of \r\naccused, so as to ensure transparency and \r\naccountability. \r\n Furthermore, the procedures for investigating, \r\ngathering evidence and authenticating documents need \r\nto be improved, especially with regard to investigating \r\ncrimes and providing strong material evidence that \r\nconfirms the consistency of the crimes committed and \r\nthose defined in the Statute. It is of similar importance \r\nnot to proceed with the legal classification of facts \r\nbased on incomplete or partial examinations thereof, or \r\non examinations that do not take all the legal \r\nconsiderations into account. \r\n Consequently, the delegation of Egypt reiterates \r\nthat the Court should respect the considerations to \r\nwhich I have referred when dealing with the African \r\ncases referred to it. Moreover, it is important that the \r\nCourt consider cases from other parts of the world. \r\nOtherwise, the continued consideration of cases \r\nfocused on only one region of the world may give the \r\nwrong impression, namely, that crimes against \r\nhumanity are being committed only in Africa or that \r\nthe Court does not target other regions where those \r\ncrimes are also being committed. \r\n In that context, Egypt expresses its concern over \r\nthe consequences of the indictment by the International \r\nCriminal Court of the President of the Republic of the \r\nSudan, taking into consideration the delicate nature of \r\nthe peace processes under way in the Sudan and the \r\nongoing efforts aimed at facilitating the early \r\nresolution of the conflict in Darfur. We also support the \r\ncall by the African Union on the Security Council to \r\ndefer the process initiated by the ICC in accordance \r\nwith the provisions of Article 16 of the Rome Statute. \r\n In order to avoid being selective in referring \r\ncases to the ICC, it is imperative that the Security \r\nCouncil not politicize its work. It is also necessary that \r\nthe Prosecutor expedite the decision to begin an \r\ninvestigation of the crimes against humanity committed \r\nin the occupied Palestinian territories. We reaffirm the \r\nresponsibility of the international community to follow \r\nup the recommendations of the report (A/HRC/12/48) \r\nof the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the \r\nGaza Conflict, as recommended by the General \r\nAssembly in resolutions 64/10, of 5 November 2009, \r\nand 64/254, of 26 February 2010. In that regard, the \r\nCourt should ensure that no one enjoys impunity. It \r\nshould also uphold the letter of the law and the \r\nestablished legal norms that we all strive to implement, \r\nas well as consolidate the application of the rule of law \r\nto all peoples and communities without exception. \r\n Mr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): I would like to \r\nthank the President of the International Criminal Court \r\n(ICC), Judge Sang Hyun Song, for presenting the \r\nreport of the Court (see A/65/313) today, which \r\nillustrates the impressive range of activities in which \r\nthe Court has been engaged over the past year. We are \r\nsatisfied to see yet again that the Court has made \r\nfurther progress in its proceedings and that it continues \r\nto work in the manner in which it was conceived that it \r\nwould, namely, as an independent and effective \r\ninternational court committed to the highest standards \r\nof justice and working within its jurisdiction and on the \r\nbasis of the principle of complementarity. \r\n As a State party to the Rome Statute, we fully \r\nrespect the independence of the Court and will \r\ntherefore not comment on the specifics of cases before \r\nit. \r\n States parties have also strengthened the Rome \r\nStatute system through the successful conclusion of the \r\nReview Conference in Kampala in June. \r\n In the area of universality, which must remain our \r\nlong-term goal, we were particularly pleased about the \r\nratifications of Bangladesh, Seychelles, Saint Lucia \r\nand the Republic of Moldova, which increased the \r\nnumber of States parties to 114. \r\n The successful outcome of the Review \r\nConference is a milestone in the development of \r\ninternational criminal justice. States parties were able \r\nto complete the work left unfinished by the United \r\nNations Diplomatic Conference of Plenipotentiaries on \r\nthe Establishment of an International Criminal Court \r\nby adopting the amendments on the crime of \r\naggression. I would like to thank all the negotiating \r\nA/65/PV.39  \r\n \r\n10-61026 22 \r\n \r\npartners for their constructive engagement on this \r\ndifficult issue, which allowed us to adopt both the \r\ndefinition of the crime of aggression and the conditions \r\nfor the exercise of jurisdiction, and to do so by \r\nconsensus. This is truly a historic achievement that \r\nstrengthens the rule of law at the international level \r\nand goes to the core of the purpose of the Organization. \r\nIn that context, I would like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his unwavering personal commitment to \r\nthe International Criminal Court. \r\n The Government of Liechtenstein has already \r\ntaken a decision in principle to ratify the amendments \r\non the crime of aggression as soon as possible. We \r\nhope that many other States parties will do the same. \r\nWe were also encouraged by the strong participation of \r\nnon-States parties in the proceedings of the Kampala \r\nConference. We hope that some of them will find the \r\ncompletion of the Rome Statute useful on their way to \r\njoining it. In Kampala, we as States parties kept the \r\npromise made in Rome that we would complete the \r\nStatute at the first Review Conference. \r\n When we adopted the Statute, in 1998, we knew \r\nthat the crimes to be dealt with by the Court — \r\ngenocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and, \r\nindeed, the crime of aggression — were inextricably \r\nlinked to situations of armed or political conflict, and \r\nwould thus give rise to controversial and strongly held \r\nviews by all those affected. Indeed, the expanding \r\nactivities of the Court have evoked both strong support \r\nand adverse reactions by stakeholders involved. This is \r\nan illustration of the relevance of the activities of the \r\nCourt and should not be seen as a distraction from the \r\nsignificant underlying consensus in the international \r\ncommunity — whether States have already decided to \r\njoin the Rome Statute or not — that there can be no \r\nimpunity for the worst crimes of international concern. \r\nAs our discussions in Kampala on peace and justice \r\nhave shown, we all stand by this principle, while it can \r\nbe difficult to apply in practice. \r\n The Review Conference has set in motion highly \r\nproductive discussions on how we can do better in \r\nimplementing that principle, and has culminated in \r\nconcrete commitments undertaken through the \r\nKampala Declaration and individual pledges. The area \r\nof complementarity is where we hope that the greatest \r\nprogress can be made in the near future. States parties \r\nhave reaffirmed their primary responsibility to \r\nprosecute perpetrators of genocide, crimes against \r\nhumanity and war crimes. National jurisdictions are at \r\nthe heart of the fight against impunity. The Court has \r\nalready had an important catalytic function that has led \r\nto the strengthening of national jurisdictions. We note, \r\nfor example, the intention of the Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo to try the recently arrested militia \r\ncommander Mayele and other suspected war criminals \r\nin its domestic judicial system. Indeed, genuine \r\ndomestic proceedings are not only an obligation \r\nstemming from the Geneva Conventions, they are also \r\nthe preferred option under the Rome Statute. \r\n The multitude of United Nations actors and \r\nothers engaged in rule of law capacity-building and \r\ntechnical assistance play a very important role in that \r\nrespect. Those efforts must be strengthened and their \r\ncoordination must be improved, under the leadership of \r\nthe Rule of Law Coordination and Resource Group. \r\nAgain, it is important to stress that States are obliged \r\nunder treaty law and customary international law to \r\ndomestically prosecute genocide, crimes against \r\nhumanity and war crimes, irrespective of whether they \r\nare parties to the Rome Statute or not. Improving \r\ntechnical assistance in that respect is thus a necessity \r\nthat should be seen independently from the daily \r\nbusiness of the Court. Indeed, it goes to the very heart \r\nof the mandate of the United Nations itself. \r\n Cooperation is another area where progress can \r\nand must be made. The Court’s effectiveness is wholly \r\ndependent on the cooperation of States, international \r\norganizations and civil society. We welcome the \r\ncontinued cooperation extended by States, in particular \r\nwith regard to the situation in the Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo, as recently underscored by the arrest of \r\nCallixte Mbarushimana in France. \r\n At the same time, there is concern about the lack \r\nof support for the Court’s activities in a number of \r\nother situations, most prominently the investigation \r\nmandated by the Security Council regarding Darfur. \r\nThat lack of cooperation poses a challenge to the \r\nauthority of the Security Council and also puts into \r\nquestion the legal obligations underwritten by States \r\nparties to the Rome Statute. We note in particular that \r\nno State party can be relieved of those obligations by \r\nvirtue of a competing obligation outside of the Rome \r\nStatute. We therefore hope that States parties will \r\nengage in a constructive dialogue on how to improve \r\ncooperation across the board, including in situations \r\nwhere such cooperation entails difficult political \r\ndecisions. It is also our hope that the Security Council \r\nwill live up to its obligation to consider the issue of \r\n A/65/PV.39\r\n \r\n23 10-61026 \r\n \r\ncooperation in the one case where it has deferred a \r\nsituation to the Court. \r\n The Court continues to stand as a beacon of hope \r\nfor victims of mass atrocities around the world. We are \r\npleased that the paradigm shift reflected in the Rome \r\nStatute towards a more victim-centred approach \r\ncontinues to be put into practice by the Court. In that \r\ncontext, Liechtenstein places particular importance on \r\nthe activities of the Trust Fund for Victims and has \r\npledged to continue its financial support for it. \r\n Mr. Appreku (Ghana): I wish to thank you, \r\nMadame, for giving me the floor to deliver the \r\nstatement of the Ghana delegation on agenda item 73, \r\nwith regard to the report of the International Criminal \r\nCourt (see A/65/313). At the outset, the Ghana \r\ndelegation wishes to align itself with the statement \r\ndelivered by the Permanent Representative of Zambia \r\non behalf of the African group of States parties to the \r\nRome Statute. We would also like to make a few \r\nadditional comments in our national capacity. \r\n My delegation welcomes the sixth annual report \r\nof the International Criminal Court. The Ghana \r\ndelegation wishes to commend the President of the \r\nCourt, His Excellency Judge Sang Hyun Song, for his \r\nremarkable presentation of the report of the Court. My \r\ndelegation is gratified to learn that under the \r\npresidency of Judge Song, the Court continues to make \r\nsignificant progress in fulfilling the aspirations of the \r\nframers of the Rome Statute to promote international \r\ncriminal justice in order to ensure accountability and \r\nend impunity in respect of grave crimes of the most \r\nserious concern to the international community, in \r\nparticular genocide, war crimes, crimes against \r\nhumanity and acts of aggression. \r\n The first Review Conference of the Rome Statute \r\nof the International Criminal Court, held in Kampala \r\nfrom 31 May to 11 June, has been hailed as a historic \r\nevent, as it provided an opportunity to introduce \r\namendments to the Rome Statute to include a definition \r\nof the crime of aggression and the conditions under \r\nwhich the Court could exercise jurisdiction with \r\nrespect to that crime. My delegation applauds the \r\nSecretary-General for ably discharging his mandate, \r\nconferred under the Rome Statute, to convene the first \r\nReview Conference. We also commend all concerned \r\nwho contributed to the success of the Conference, \r\nnotably Ambassador Christian Wenaweser of \r\nLiechtenstein, who is the President of the Assembly of \r\nStates Parties, and Ambassador Prince Zeid Ra’ad Zeid \r\nAl-Hussein of Jordan, who chaired the special working \r\ngroup on the crime of aggression. We also \r\nacknowledge the countless non-governmental \r\norganizations and civil society groups that played an \r\nimportant role in mobilizing the participation of people \r\nto show interest in the Review Conference. \r\n The Kampala Review Conference offered States \r\nparties and non-States parties alike a rare moment to \r\ntake stock of the Rome Statute system since the \r\nholding of the Rome Conference. The challenge ahead \r\nis to address in a dispassionate manner some of the \r\nlingering issues arising from Kampala and to ensure \r\nthat there is a common and better understanding of the \r\namendment that was agreed to in Kampala in respect to \r\nthe crime of aggression, including the role of the \r\nSecurity Council in the determination of an act of \r\naggression, in the absence of which a charge of the \r\ncrime of aggression might be difficult to sustain. The \r\nforthcoming session of the Assembly of States Parties \r\nin New York should provide another platform to \r\ncontinue the dialogue with a view to further clarifying \r\nthe amendment adopted in Kampala. \r\n Ghana supports the need for further improving \r\nthe interaction and relationship between the Court and \r\nthe Assembly of States Parties, with due regard for the \r\nprinciple of judicial independence and impartiality. The \r\nprinciple of complementarity, which underpins the \r\nRome Statute, means that the need for capacity-\r\nbuilding at the national level must be given top priority \r\nas well. While perpetrators of serious crimes must be \r\nbrought to justice, equal attention must be paid to the \r\nneed to create conditions to address the root causes of \r\nconflicts, including enhancing the rule of law, with the \r\nultimate aim of preventing violent conflicts that tend to \r\nfoster the crimes the Rome Statute was meant to punish \r\nor deter. \r\n I wish to conclude by commending the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, supported by the United Nations Legal \r\nCounsel, for his continued commitment to promoting \r\ncooperation between the Court and the United Nations \r\nand for upholding the principle that justice is essential \r\nto the maintenance of international peace and security, \r\nwhich are in turn necessary for sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\n We are not about to forget to acknowledge, with \r\nour deepest appreciation, the efforts of the Government \r\nand people of Uganda in hosting the Review \r\nA/65/PV.39  \r\n \r\n10-61026 24 \r\n \r\nConference on African soil, thus underscoring our \r\ncontinent’s dedication to the advancement of the rule \r\nof law, justice and accountability. African States were \r\ninstrumental in bringing the Rome Statute into force in \r\nsignificant numbers, and an African country has hosted \r\nthe first Review Conference. \r\n Going forward, the key challenges will include \r\nthe promotion of the universality of the Rome Statute \r\nand effective international cooperation to strengthen \r\nthe fight against impunity, which ought to be the \r\ncollective responsibility of all peoples and States. \r\nGhana hopes and believes that the outstanding issues \r\npreventing the opening of an International Criminal \r\nCourt liaison office in Addis Ababa and greater \r\ncooperation between the Court and the continent will \r\nbe resolved sooner rather than later, to enable African \r\nStates to lead the effort towards the universality of the \r\nRome Statute, as was envisaged by the Assembly \r\ndecades ago when it first considered the idea of \r\nestablishing a permanent international criminal court \r\nthat left no Member State behind or beyond the reach \r\nof justice and accountability. \r\n Mr. Hernández (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nMexico would like to thank the President of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court, Judge Sang-Hyung Song, \r\nfor the presentation of the Court’s sixth annual report \r\n(see A/65/313) to the General Assembly. \r\n We welcome the recent accession of four States \r\nto the Statute, namely, Bangladesh, Saint Lucia, \r\nSeychelles and the Republic of Moldova. There are \r\nnow 114 States parties to the Rome Statute, which is a \r\nclear indication of the Court’s universalization. \r\n The year 2010 marks an important step for \r\ninternational criminal justice and for the system built \r\non the Rome Statute. The holding of the first Review \r\nConference and its successful results are proof of this. \r\nThe adoption by consensus of amendments to the \r\nStatute, particularly those related to the crime of \r\naggression, is in itself a success that demonstrates both \r\npolitical will and illustrates the responsible, inclusive \r\nand comprehensive participation of delegations at the \r\nConference. \r\n In Kampala, we had the opportunity to reflect on \r\nthe current situation and the challenges that \r\ninternational criminal justice faces eight years after the \r\nentry into force of the Rome Statute. Similarly, we \r\nreaffirmed our commitment to the Court with pledges \r\naimed primarily at guaranteeing effective cooperation. \r\nIt is now up to States parties to implement the Kampala \r\noutcomes, thereby strengthening the operation and \r\nindependence of the Court above and beyond any \r\npolitical considerations. The first Review Conference \r\nshould be seen as the beginning of a permanent process \r\nof evaluation and improvement of the international \r\ncriminal justice system that allows us to strengthen the \r\nCourt’s work and the provisions of the Rome Statute. \r\n On this point I would like to reiterate my \r\ncountry’s belief that the Rome Statute will not be \r\ncomplete until the use of nuclear weapons is classified \r\nas a war crime. We will therefore continue to promote \r\nthat cause in the working group to be established by \r\nthe Assembly of States Parties during its next session. \r\n Six years have passed since the establishment of \r\nthe judicial system provided for under the Rome \r\nStatute. In spite of the great efforts by the staff of the \r\nCourt, there is still a long way to go. Nine arrest \r\nwarrants still remain to be executed, and the challenges \r\nin the field are countless. We should not forget that the \r\nInternational Criminal Court will be able to exercise its \r\nmandate only if it can rely on the full and effective \r\ncooperation of the international community. \r\n My delegation believes it is important to stress \r\nthat refusal to cooperate with the Court amounts to a \r\nclear violation of international obligations under the \r\nRome Statute and, in certain circumstances, the Charter \r\nitself. Non-cooperation thus requires that tough \r\nmeasures be taken by the Assembly of States Parties \r\nand, in some cases, by the Security Council. In that \r\nregard, Mexico considers it urgent to develop \r\nmechanisms that can effectively implement the \r\nprovisions set out in article 87, paragraph 7, of the \r\nStatute. \r\n My delegation is convinced that the challenges \r\nthe Court faces in becoming a role model for justice \r\nwill be overcome only if we have a solid, efficient and \r\neffective institution. Now, almost 10 years since the \r\nCourt was established, the time has come to assess its \r\ninstitutional operation. Through a constructive and \r\nstructured dialogue among the Assembly of States \r\nParties and the various bodies of the Court, we should \r\nidentify options that can improve the governance of the \r\nCourt and strengthen its institutional framework and \r\njudicial independence. \r\n However, I also wish to emphasize that a role \r\nmodel for justice must also be a model in the area of \r\nhuman and financial resources. Rationalizing \r\n A/65/PV.39\r\n \r\n25 10-61026 \r\n \r\nexpenditures, achieving judicial proceedings that are \r\nmore effective, efficient and responsive, as well as \r\npromoting the transparency and accountability of all \r\nthe Court’s bodies, are measures that will result in \r\nbetter use of the available resources. For these reasons, \r\nMexico calls upon the Court’s various bodies and \r\nofficers to reflect on its real needs and to propose their \r\nown internal budget austerity measures, taking into \r\naccount the financial sacrifices they may entail, as a \r\nsign of their willingness to work towards a Court that \r\ncan carry out its functions efficiently in terms of costs. \r\n More than 60 years have passed since the \r\nadoption of the Convention on the Prevention and \r\nPunishment of the Crime of Genocide, in which the \r\nidea of a permanent international criminal court was \r\nfirst conceived. Today that ideal is a reality. Now it is \r\nup to the international community to work together in \r\norder to maintain the efficacy, efficiency and integrity \r\nof the Rome Statute, while it falls to the Court to \r\nestablish itself as a role model for justice that makes a \r\nmeaningful contribution to the prevention of the most \r\nheinous. Mexico will support the Court in its efforts. \r\n  The meeting rose at 5.55 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
