(Switzerland) \r\n \r\n \r\n  In the absence of the President, Mr. Badji \r\n(Senegal), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m. \r\n \r\nAgenda items 13 and 115 (continued) \r\n \r\nIntegrated and coordinated implementation of and \r\nfollow-up to the outcomes of the major United \r\nNations conferences and summits in the economic, \r\nsocial and related fields \r\n \r\nFollow-up to the outcome of the Millennium Summit  \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/65/L.7) \r\n \r\n Ms. Anderson (Ireland): The co-facilitators — \r\nAmbassador Baso Sangqu of South Africa, Ambassador \r\nClaude Heller of Mexico and myself — warmly \r\nwelcome today’s debate, and we hope that the draft \r\nresolution (A/65/L.7) as circulated will be adopted at \r\nthe conclusion of our discussion. We trust that Member \r\nStates will have had the opportunity over the past three \r\nmonths or so to reflect on the contents of our report \r\n(A/64/868, annex), and we look forward to hearing \r\nviews today. On behalf of the co-facilitators, I would \r\nlike to present some brief comments on process, \r\ncontent and the way forward. \r\n First, with regard to process, it seems to us that \r\nthe way in which the membership engaged itself in this \r\nexercise represents the United Nations at its most \r\nconstructive. We felt throughout a true sense of \r\ncommon purpose. There was extensive participation at \r\neach of the open-ended consultative meetings. Inputs \r\nfrom other stakeholders, in our various seminars and in \r\nour engagement with the Geneva community, were also \r\nimpressive. Throughout, interventions were thoughtful \r\nand detailed, with views cogently set out and opposing \r\nviewpoints listened to with respect. \r\n The co-facilitators tried both to encourage that \r\napproach and to reflect it in our work. In framing our \r\nanalysis and recommendations, we sought to distil the \r\nexperience and good sense of the full range of \r\ninterlocutors. As we have made clear, our purpose was \r\nto define approaches that could keep the membership \r\ntogether, while meeting the essential test of \r\nstrengthening the peacebuilding architecture. Finding a \r\nconsensual approach, without sacrifice of honesty or \r\nclarity, is not easy. If we fell short, we hope Member \r\nStates will accept that this was the spirit that inspired \r\nour work. \r\n As regards content, we would like to highlight \r\njust a few brief points in relation to the four principal \r\nchapters of the report. Following the identification of \r\nkey issues, we begin our analysis in the field. We \r\ncannot overemphasize the importance of that \r\nperspective. In our consultations, we found it sobering \r\nto see the lack of understanding on the ground of what \r\nis being attempted in New York. The New York-field \r\nconnection simply has to work better. And we also felt \r\nit essential to underline again the imperative of \r\nnational ownership. That works both ways. The \r\ninternational community must understand the limits of \r\nits role as midwife to a national birthing process, and \r\nnational authorities in turn must recognize the \r\nresponsibilities that ownership confers. \r\nA/65/PV.40  \r\n \r\n10-61032 2 \r\n \r\n Our second major focus is on the role and \r\nperformance of the Peacebuilding Commission at \r\nHeadquarters. In that chapter, we try to work \r\nsystematically through the issues arising, including in \r\nparticular the relationship between the Organizational \r\nCommittee and the country-specific configurations. We \r\ndefine the challenge in that relationship as the need to \r\ncombine innovation and vibrancy with weight and \r\nsolidity. \r\n Amid the generally very positive reactions to the \r\ncontent of this chapter, some delegations expressed \r\ndisappointment at not seeing a fuller embrace of their \r\npositions on certain specific aspects. Such a reaction is \r\nalways understandable, but we would say to those \r\ndelegations that if their views were not fully embraced, \r\nit was because there were countervailing views that \r\nalso had validity and deserved to be taken into account. \r\nThat was in the nature of the exercise. \r\n Our third major area of focus is on key \r\nrelationships, both within the United Nations — with \r\nthe Security Council, the General Assembly and the \r\nEconomic and Social Council — and with other \r\npartnerships. As we make clear, the Commission’s \r\nrelationship with the Security Council is critical in \r\nshaping the Commission’s agenda and in determining \r\nits relevance within the United Nations architecture. \r\nWe are conscious of the view of some that the report \r\nshows insufficient circumspection in treading on that \r\nsensitive ground. In all honesty, we do not think we \r\ncould have said less. There has already been an \r\nopportunity for discussion in the Security Council; \r\ntoday, we would want only to emphasize that the \r\nemergence of the new dynamic we envisage — \r\nbetween a more forthcoming Security Council and a \r\nbetter-performing Peacebuilding Commission — is \r\nessential, if peacebuilding is to assume its proper place \r\nin United Nations priorities. \r\n Together with the Security Council, the General \r\nAssembly is also, of course, a co-parent of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission. The Assembly’s \r\nco-parenting responsibilities have not been exercised \r\nas fully as they could have been, and our report tries to \r\nsuggest possible ways to achieve a more structured and \r\ninteractive relationship. Already in this session and \r\nunder our current President, we hope that those \r\navenues will begin to be explored. \r\n Our fourth area of focus is the Peacebuilding \r\nSupport Office and the Peacebuilding Fund. We look at \r\nchanges necessary within the Support Office, including \r\nstaffing issues, but also at the role and weight of the \r\nSupport Office across the Secretariat as a whole. In \r\nthat regard, we particularly underline the importance of \r\na clear and unequivocal message from the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that peacebuilding is central to United Nations \r\npriorities, and the need for his support of \r\norganizational arrangements that reflect this. \r\n Finally, a word about the path from here on: the \r\nco-facilitators extend our thanks to the President of the \r\nAssembly, the President of the Security Council and \r\ntheir respective teams for their work in framing a \r\nresolution that could command consensus in both \r\nbodies. It is consistent with the way this exercise has \r\nbeen conducted from the outset that there should be a \r\nconsensual text; any other outcome would fracture the \r\nsense of common purpose that it is so important to \r\nsafeguard. Even if the draft resolution before us does \r\nnot in every word reflect the preferences of everyone, \r\nwe trust and believe it has sufficient strength and \r\nclarity to ensure that the recommendations in the report \r\nare appropriately taken forward and implemented. \r\n Our report concludes with a sense of urgency and \r\nthe hope that it will serve as a wake-up call. It would \r\nbe very easy to lose that sense of urgency, to feel — \r\nnow that we have a report and a draft resolution, and \r\nwith a new country, Liberia, on the Commission’s \r\nagenda — that all is basically well, and that we can \r\nrevisit the subject in five years’ time. There is no room \r\nfor any such complacency. The World Development \r\nReport, to be issued shortly, will again set out the grim \r\nrealities and remind us of how corrosively conflict eats \r\naway at developmental gains. The needs remain very \r\ngreat; our report will have value insofar, and only \r\ninsofar, as it leads us to respond to them more \r\neffectively. \r\n Mr. Momen (Bangladesh): I have the pleasure to \r\nspeak today on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement \r\n(NAM) on the review of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission. \r\n At the outset, the Movement would like to \r\nexpress its sincerest appreciation to the co-facilitators \r\nof the review process, the Permanent Representatives \r\nof South Africa, Ireland and Mexico, and commend \r\nthem on their transparent, all-inclusive and objective \r\nefforts, which resulted in the present report and \r\nrecommendations (A/64/868, annex). \r\n A/65/PV.40\r\n \r\n3 10-61032 \r\n \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement would also like to \r\nexpress its appreciation for the President’s efforts and \r\nthose of Uganda in negotiating the draft resolution \r\nunder consideration by the General Assembly \r\n(A/65/L.7), with a view to its adoption by both the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council today. \r\n The United Nations has developed and improved \r\nits peacebuilding efforts in post-conflict situations \r\nthrough an integrated system established by the \r\nGeneral Assembly to play the pivotal role in the \r\ncoordination of those United Nations peacebuilding \r\nefforts. In the meantime, the international community \r\ncame to realize the importance of the decision of the \r\n2005 World Summit to establish the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, which has contributed significantly to \r\npeacebuilding through its achievements over the past \r\nfive years of its operations. \r\n In that context, the Movement has supported \r\nUnited Nations peacebuilding efforts through the \r\nGeneral Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic \r\nand Social Council and the Peacebuilding Commission, \r\nestablished by resolution 60/180, where the operations \r\nand activities of the latter are becoming increasingly \r\nimportant as a result of its accumulated expertise, the \r\nlessons learned over the past years and its important \r\nrole in coordinating international efforts to prevent \r\npost-conflict countries from relapsing into conflict. \r\n Today’s adoption of the draft resolution by the \r\nGeneral Assembly is a commitment towards taking \r\nforward the final recommendations of the review \r\nprocess and reaffirming our willingness to develop the \r\nUnited Nations peacebuilding architecture, with the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission at its centre, by taking \r\nadvantage of more opportunities for countries to be \r\nincluded on the Peacebuilding Commission’s agenda, a \r\nclearer sense of how the engagement of the \r\nCommission should contribute to peacebuilding \r\nprocesses in the field, a stronger relationship being \r\nforged between the Commission and the Security \r\nCouncil, the General Assembly and the Economic and \r\nSocial Council, and a more enabled Peacebuilding \r\nSupport Office. \r\n While the Movement welcomes the \r\nrecommendations in the report, it is of the view that \r\ncertain elements should have been included in that \r\ncomprehensive review process in order to strengthen \r\nthe role of the Commission. Those elements include, \r\ninter alia: providing the needed funding jointly from \r\nthe General Assembly and the Security Council, in \r\nconsultation with the Commission, to peacebuilding \r\nfield missions and field visits; negotiating a set of \r\nclear, efficient and flexible rules of procedures for the \r\nOrganizational Committee of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission; redefining the relationship between the \r\nCommission and the Fund, where the Commission \r\nshould play a principal role in setting the general \r\npolicy for the Fund and in developing an accountability \r\nframework for the Fund’s operations in consultation \r\nwith its Advisory Group; identifying appropriate ways \r\nfor international financial institutions to finance the \r\ncritical economic activities needed to consolidate peace \r\ndirectly by eliminating the roots for economic and \r\nsocial inequalities most often identified as major \r\ncauses for unrest and conflict; and establishing a \r\ngreater balance between the roles of donor and \r\nnon-donor countries in the Commission’s activities. \r\n The Movement reiterates the central role \r\nexpected from the Organizational Committee of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission in implementing the draft \r\nresolution and the recommendations of the review \r\nprocess, in full cooperation and coordination with the \r\nprincipal bodies of the United Nations and all relevant \r\nactors, in order to achieve the expectations of the \r\ninternational community in a more effective \r\npeacebuilding approach. \r\n The Movement stresses that the Commission \r\nmust focus on the implementation of the review’s \r\nrecommendations, with a view to achieving the \r\nfollowing objectives. \r\n First, the Commission must ensure that national \r\nownership underpins the entire peacebuilding process \r\nfrom the initial phases of early peacebuilding, in \r\nparticular the planning stage and negotiations on \r\npeacebuilding strategies. A stake for national actors \r\nmust be built into those phases to enable the transfer of \r\nthe management and implementation of peacebuilding \r\nstrategies and projects to the concerned Government \r\nand its national partners, including parliament and civil \r\nsociety. \r\n Second, it must reaffirm the necessity of national \r\ncapacity-building by developing the needed \r\nmechanisms, ensuring continued political support and \r\nproviding the required technical and financial \r\nresources, and ensuring that all actors, including \r\npolitical parties, parliaments and civil society, are in a \r\nA/65/PV.40  \r\n \r\n10-61032 4 \r\n \r\nposition to engage meaningfully in the peacebuilding \r\nprocess. \r\n The third objective is to develop the institutional \r\nrelationship between the Commission and the principal \r\nbodies of the United Nations, including through \r\ninnovative exchange frameworks, in particular the \r\nestablishment of early peacebuilding components in \r\npeacekeeping operations during the consultations on \r\nthe establishment or renewal of a peacekeeping \r\nmandate, as well as regular exchanges among the \r\nOrganizational Committee, the country-specific \r\nconfiguration and the General Assembly, the Security \r\nCouncil and the Economic and Social Council. \r\n Fourth, the Commission must intensify the nexus \r\nbetween development and peace by prioritizing \r\ndevelopment and ensuring its full integration into \r\npeacebuilding efforts in countries emerging from \r\nconflict. It is crucial that peacebuilding strategies \r\naddress and respond to the range of development \r\nchallenges faced by the country concerned. \r\n Fifth, it must strengthen gender mainstreaming \r\ninto the priorities of peacebuilding strategies and their \r\nactivities. The potential contribution that women can \r\nmake to peace processes hardly needs reiteration. \r\nFurthermore, the success of any peacebuilding process \r\nrests also on its ability to ensure gender equality and \r\nthe empowerment of women within the political, \r\neconomic and social spheres. In that context, it is \r\nimportant that the General Assembly, the Security \r\nCouncil and the Peacebuilding Commission study and \r\nevaluate the report of the Secretary-General on \r\nwomen’s participation in peacebuilding (A/65/354) and \r\nthe seven priorities underlined in the proposed action \r\nplan. \r\n Sixth, the Commission should develop multiple \r\nforms of engagement that are appropriate to the special \r\ncircumstances of different countries, on a case-by-case \r\nbasis, thus encouraging countries in post-conflict \r\nsituations to be included on the Commission’s agenda. \r\n The seventh objective is to strengthen the role of \r\nthe Commission in providing political support to \r\nUnited Nations peacebuilding missions, which, in turn, \r\nshould reflect United Nations peacebuilding principles \r\nand priorities in their operations, and to ensure the full \r\nintegration of the work of United Nations actors on the \r\nground, based on joint planning and clear inventories \r\nof actions to avoid duplication. \r\n Eighth, the Commission should capitalize on its \r\ncurrent composition, in accordance with paragraph 4 of \r\nresolution 60/180, so as to draw on the competitive \r\nadvantages and expertise of the diversified \r\nrepresentation of the general membership in the \r\nOrganizational Committee, in particular the \r\nrepresentation of United Nations Charter bodies. \r\n Ninth, the Commission must develop and \r\nstrengthen the recruitment of international civilian \r\ncapacities to address the specific needs and \r\nparticularities of the countries concerned and \r\ncommunities within which such capacities will be \r\ndeployed, and to support national institutional and \r\nhuman resources capacity-building. There is also the \r\nneed to further develop the cooperation frameworks of \r\nUnited Nations agencies, programmes and bodies with \r\nregional and subregional organizations and institutions \r\nand developing countries that have accumulated the \r\nexpertise needed to build peace within a specific \r\ncountry or in a specific region, as well as to promote \r\nboth South-South and triangular cooperation in that \r\narea. \r\n Tenth, the Commission must focus on \r\nmaximizing benefits from the available capacities of \r\nthe United Nations, the international financial \r\ninstitutions and the donor community, in order to \r\nsupport peacebuilding efforts. In that regard, it is \r\nimperative to establish a monitoring, evaluation and \r\nfollow-up mechanism to ensure the implementation of \r\nall national and international commitments made \r\nwithin the framework of the nationally agreed \r\npeacebuilding priorities and strategies. \r\n Finally, the Commission must focus on ensuring \r\nconsistency in the priorities of international funding \r\nmechanisms, including the Peacebuilding Fund, with \r\nnational peacebuilding priorities of the countries \r\nconcerned and the need to consider innovative methods \r\nto strengthen the resources of such mechanisms, in \r\nparticular the Peacebuilding Fund, so that such \r\nresources will constitute a cornerstone for funding \r\npeacebuilding strategies whose successful implementation \r\nand dividends on the ground would encourage further \r\nengagements and commitments from the international \r\nfinancial community to support comprehensive \r\npeacebuilding processes and sustainable development \r\nstrategies. \r\n The Peacebuilding Commission is uniquely \r\npositioned as the high-level platform for coordination \r\n A/65/PV.40\r\n \r\n5 10-61032 \r\n \r\nbetween the needs on the ground and the United \r\nNations system. Its initial responsibility is to assist \r\ncountries on its agenda in determining their own \r\npeacebuilding priorities. Using its knowledge and \r\nexperience, the Commission must bring its political \r\nweight to bear in efforts to engage the United Nations \r\nsystem and the wider international community in \r\nfulfilling those priorities in the best possible way. \r\nMoreover, it must not hesitate to use its political \r\nweight to urgently address issues of mutual \r\naccountability. It is by recognizing and leveraging to \r\nthe full extent the essentially political role that the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission can deliver effectively its \r\nresponsibilities within its mandate. \r\n In that regard, the Non-Aligned Movement \r\nwelcomes the consensus around the current draft \r\nresolution, offers its full support for the progressive \r\nimplementation of the recommendations of the review \r\nwithin the next five years and stands ready to support \r\nthe efforts of the Peacebuilding Commission in \r\nmonitoring and following up on these \r\nrecommendations. \r\n Mr. Grauls (Belgium): I have the honour of \r\nspeaking today on behalf of the European Union. The \r\ncandidate countries Turkey, Croatia, the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the countries of \r\nthe Stabilisation and Association Process and potential \r\ncandidates Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, \r\nMontenegro and Serbia, as well as Ukraine, the \r\nRepublic of Moldova, Georgia and Armenia, align \r\nthemselves with this statement. \r\n I would like to thank the President of the General \r\nAssembly and his Office for organizing this important \r\ndebate concerning the 2010 review of the United \r\nNations peacebuilding architecture and for preparing \r\nthe draft resolution we have before us today \r\n(A/65/L.7). \r\n From the outset, the European Union has been a \r\nstrong supporter of the United Nations peacebuilding \r\narchitecture. As the largest donor in the five countries \r\non the Peacebuilding Commission’s agenda, the \r\nEuropean Union has cooperated intensively within the \r\ncountry-specific configurations and the Organizational \r\nCommittee of the Commission. The European Union \r\nhas also been strongly committed to making the review \r\nof the peacebuilding architecture a success and has \r\nactively taken part in the informal consultations \r\nchaired by the co-facilitators. \r\n The European Union would like to praise the \r\ntireless efforts of the co-facilitators and warmly \r\nwelcomes their report (A/65/868, annex) as a balanced \r\ndocument, based on extensive consultations with the \r\nUnited Nations membership and other stakeholders. \r\nThe report contains a thoughtful analysis of the \r\nchallenges and useful recommendations for the way \r\nahead. \r\n In terms of next steps, the European Union fully \r\nsupports the draft resolution before us today. The \r\ntimely adoption of that short and straightforward \r\nresolution will allow all relevant United Nations and \r\nother actors to build on the momentum generated by \r\nthe review of the peacebuilding architecture by taking \r\nforward, as appropriate, the recommendations of the \r\nreport. The European Union would also like to call on \r\nthe Secretary-General to play a major role by bringing \r\nthe United Nations system together in order to further \r\nimprove the effectiveness of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission and the support that the Peacebuilding \r\nSupport Office provides. \r\n The European Union welcomes the recognition in \r\nthe draft resolution that the peacebuilding work of the \r\nUnited Nations requires sustained support and adequate \r\nresources to meet the challenges. As a strong believer \r\nin peacebuilding, the European Union stands ready to \r\nredouble its efforts to help implement the \r\nrecommendations of the report and enable the United \r\nNations peacebuilding architecture to live up to the \r\nexpectations which accompanied its establishment. \r\n Mr. Bowler (Malawi): I have the pleasure of \r\nspeaking today on behalf on the Group of African \r\nStates on the review of the Peacebuilding Commission. \r\nAt the outset, the African Group would like to express \r\nits sincere appreciation to the co-facilitators, \r\nAmbassador Sangqu of South Africa, Ambassador \r\nAnderson of Ireland and Ambassador Heller of Mexico, \r\nfor the true commitment and passion with which they \r\nhave executed this noble task. I would also like to \r\nthank His Excellency the President of the General \r\nAssembly and his entire office, as well as the Uganda \r\ndelegation, for their leadership. \r\n The draft resolution before us today (A/65/L.7) \r\nwill not take us to heaven as desired, but may help to \r\nsave us from hell. The African Group has taken note \r\nthat certain members of the Permanent Five were from \r\nthe outset not constructive in the review process and \r\neven adopted a selfish approach. We are extremely \r\nA/65/PV.40  \r\n \r\n10-61032 6 \r\n \r\ngrateful to the United Nations for what it represents \r\nand what it stands for as well for the opportunity for \r\ndialogue that it provides to its membership, for that \r\nvery reason. \r\n In Africa, we view the United Nations as \r\nextremely relevant. The United Nations has developed \r\nits peacebuilding efforts, but no doubt there is a very \r\nlong way to go. The draft resolution before us makes a \r\ncommitment towards implementing the recommendations \r\nthat will contribute to strengthening the peacebuilding \r\nprocess. \r\n In December of this year, we will be at the five-\r\nyear mark since the adoption of the General Assembly \r\nand Security Council resolutions establishing the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, whose review is under \r\nconsideration today. When the Commission was \r\nformed in 2005 as an intergovernmental advisory body \r\ndesigned to specifically focus on post-conflict \r\npeacebuilding situations and, more importantly, avert \r\nrelapse into conflict, the expectations of the recipients \r\nof its services were naturally raised. However, as \r\ndiscussed in the review report (A/64/868, annex), those \r\nexpectations were not adequately met. Again, five \r\nyears on, when the Commission was up for review, it \r\nwas expected that the review process would enhance its \r\neffectiveness. \r\n The review report and its recommendations carry \r\nthe hopes of those people in post-conflict situations \r\nwhose fate depends on our conscious and collective \r\nresponsibility to salvage them from the devastating \r\neffects of conflict. Most of those people are Africans. \r\nAfricans urge all of us to put our shoulders to the \r\nwheel to make peacebuilding work. The tragedy of \r\nconflict is that the most vulnerable, particularly women \r\nand children and youth, become the victims. It is not \r\nonly immoral, but should be regarded as a crime, if we \r\nwho are privileged to be given the responsibility of \r\nproviding peace fail in our duty. Diluting the \r\npeacebuilding final draft resolution any further would \r\nbe a betrayal of our responsibilities. \r\n Conflict zones are living hell and require our \r\ncommitted and serious efforts to alleviate and reduce \r\nthe suffering, as well as to bring about a real and \r\nmeaningful peacebuilding process. At the risk of \r\nrepeating what is contained in the report, I would like \r\nto emphasize the following points that could help us \r\nenhance our post-conflict peacebuilding activities. \r\n Without prescribing to the Security Council how \r\nit should go about its work, there is a greater need to \r\nstrengthen the relationship between the Council and the \r\nCommission if we are to achieve maximum results. In \r\nthat relation, therefore, the Peacebuilding Support \r\nOffice needs to be strengthened. \r\n Long-term development should be at the centre of \r\npost-conflict interventions. As much as quick-impact \r\nprogrammes are important, long-lasting peace can only \r\nbe cultivated and sustained when people enjoy the \r\ndividends of peace that are embedded in long-term \r\ndevelopment strategies. To achieve that, we need to \r\nfocus on comprehensive and nationally owned \r\ninterventions supported by holistic, system-wide \r\ncoordination and sustained interventions. \r\n The Peacebuilding Fund can only do so much. \r\nPost-conflict peacebuilding needs more resources, and \r\nthe United Nations should devise innovative ways, in \r\npartnership with other partners, such as the \r\ninternational financial institutions, regional \r\norganizations and funding institutions, to sufficiently \r\nfinance peacebuilding activities. \r\n The conflict-prevention dimension of the United \r\nNations might be the only sustainable approach to \r\naverting the challenges that come with post-conflict \r\nsituations. We therefore call on the United Nations, and \r\nthe Security Council in particular, to focus attention on \r\nconflict-prevention strategies, instead of expending \r\nalready scarce resources resolving conflicts that could \r\notherwise have been prevented. \r\n It is also important to note that there is a need to \r\nsustain the attention of the international community on \r\nthe agenda countries. It is vital that support is \r\ncontinued beyond fundamental peacekeeping and that \r\nit extends into building secure nations. \r\n On Tuesday, 26 October, we commemorated the \r\ntenth anniversary of Security Council resolution 1325 \r\n(2000), which seeks to put women at the centre of \r\nconflict prevention, resolution and post-conflict \r\npeacebuilding activities. Accordingly, for us to achieve \r\nsustainable peace, we need to involve women as equal \r\npartners in all conflict prevention, resolution and post-\r\nconflict peacebuilding activities, including governance. \r\n It is important, furthermore, for us to involve \r\ncivil society with Governments, and our national \r\nframeworks must be people-centred. \r\n A/65/PV.40\r\n \r\n7 10-61032 \r\n \r\n In conclusion, we align ourselves with the \r\nstatement made by the Permanent Representative of \r\nBangladesh on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement \r\nand support the adoption of draft resolution A/65/L.7, \r\nentitled “Review of the United Nations peacebuilding \r\narchitecture”. We hope that we all will take the \r\nnecessary steps to implement the recommendations of \r\nthe report in our collective pursuit of sustainable peace. \r\nWe also call upon the membership to embrace this draft \r\nresolution, particularly the permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council. As I mentioned earlier, in the process \r\nof coming up with the draft resolution, we felt that \r\nsome members might not have understood our needs in \r\nAfrica, where sadly most of our efforts in \r\npeacebuilding initiatives are targeted. We call on the \r\nmembership to support the draft resolution. \r\n Mr. Staur (Denmark): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of the Nordic countries, Denmark, Finland, \r\nIceland, Norway and Sweden.  \r\n Allow me first of all to thank the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly for organizing today’s debate, in \r\nwhich we conclude the 2010 review of the United \r\nNations peacebuilding architecture, as mandated by the \r\noriginal General Assembly and Security Council \r\nresolutions. \r\n Furthermore, allow me also to stress the strong \r\nappreciation of the Nordic countries for the dedicated \r\neffort and hard work of the three co-facilitators, who \r\nconducted the review in an open, inclusive and \r\ntransparent manner, allowing for all views and voices \r\nto be heard. The Nordic countries warmly welcome the \r\nreport of the co-facilitators (A/64/868, annex), which \r\nwe feel accurately reflects the current situation and \r\noutlines innovative means and ways to amplify the \r\nreach and relevance of the peacebuilding architecture. \r\nMost importantly, the Nordic countries feel confident \r\nthat the report and its recommendations reinforce the \r\nability of the Peacebuilding Commission to deliver \r\nadded value where it counts most, which is at the \r\ncountry level. As we stressed at the outset of this \r\nreview process, the Nordic countries strongly believe \r\nthat the determining benchmark for success should \r\nultimately be the real impact in each and every country. \r\n The Nordic countries are firmly committed to \r\nadvancing the work of the United Nations \r\npeacebuilding architecture, and this review has been a \r\nwelcome occasion to take stock, to reassess the efforts \r\nso far and to look at the challenges facing the wider \r\npeacebuilding agenda. The moment has now come to \r\ntransform the ideas and recommendations generated by \r\nthe review into tangible advances on the ground. The \r\nrecent establishment of a Peacebuilding Commission \r\ncountry-specific configuration for Liberia offers an \r\nopportunity to do just that, and we welcome Liberia’s \r\ndecision to seek the advice and support of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission on its path towards \r\nconsolidating peace. \r\n The Nordic countries can support the short draft \r\nresolution before us today (A/65/L.7), and we look \r\nforward to contributing actively to its follow-up and \r\nimplementation. We acknowledge that peacebuilding \r\nwork requires sustained support and adequate \r\nresources, and we pledge our continued support in that \r\nregard. We join others in calling for the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to vigorously take that agenda forward with a \r\nview to achieving more coherent and effective United \r\nNations delivery in fragile and post-conflict States. \r\n Our debate today in the General Assembly \r\nfollows in the footsteps of another closely related \r\ndebate on post-conflict peacebuilding conducted in the \r\nSecurity Council as recently as on the 13th of this \r\nmonth. Indeed, very close links exist between the \r\nreview of the peacebuilding architecture and the \r\nSecretary-General’s progress report on peacebuilding \r\nin the immediate aftermath of conflict (A/64/866), as \r\nwell as his report on women’s participation in \r\npeacebuilding (A/65/354). Allow me to reiterate in this \r\nforum the Nordic countries’ full support for those \r\nreports and their recommendations. Successful and \r\nsustained peacebuilding requires that a wide set of \r\nactors come together in highly complex circumstances \r\nand work coherently towards nationally owned goals. \r\nThe Nordic countries are confident that this review, as \r\nwell as the recent reports of the Secretary-General, has \r\ncontributed positively towards this elusive but \r\nworthwhile ambition. \r\n Mr. Kleib (Indonesia): I would like to begin by \r\nthanking the President of the General Assembly for \r\nconvening this debate to discuss the review of the \r\nUnited Nations Peacebuilding Commission (PBC). We \r\ncommend the process and conduct of the 2010 review \r\nof the Commission under the able leadership of the \r\nambassadors of South Africa, Mexico and Ireland as \r\nco-facilitators. My delegation associates itself with the \r\nstatement delivered earlier by the representative of \r\nBangladesh on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement. \r\nA/65/PV.40  \r\n \r\n10-61032 8 \r\n \r\n Indonesia concurs with the executive summary of \r\nthe report on the review of the United Nations \r\npeacebuilding architecture that: \r\n “We are now at a crossroads: either there is a \r\nconscious recommitment to peacebuilding at the \r\nvery heart of the work of the United Nations, or \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission settles into the \r\nlimited role that has developed so far.” (A/64/868, \r\nannex, p. 3) \r\n As stated in the report, the greater number of \r\nMember States, including Indonesia, strongly favours \r\nthe former path. Draft resolution A/65/L.7, as it stands, \r\nreflects this conclusion and points in the right direction \r\nto that path. \r\n The draft resolution will determine the course of \r\nactions by the Commission in the future and must thus \r\ncontain elements to strengthen its role and \r\nperformance. We were heartened to learn of the draft \r\nresolution’s stipulated request for all relevant United \r\nNations actors to take forward the recommendations \r\nset forth in the report, thus reinvigorating a conscious \r\nrecommitment to peacebuilding. \r\n Our firm position in this regard is to support the \r\nspirit of the draft resolution, which also cites the \r\nreport, and others, based on our experience as a \r\nmember of the PBC Organizational Committee from \r\n2006 to 2008. For example, as the first Chair of the \r\nPBC Strategy and Policy Task Force on Private Sector, \r\nin April 2008 Indonesia submitted an exhaustive set of \r\nobservations and recommendations to the \r\nOrganizational Committee on the important role of the \r\nprivate sector with respect to its contribution to post-\r\nconflict peacebuilding. That was an important task in \r\nthe context of exploring ways the PBC could fulfil its \r\nmandate to marshal resources. \r\n The outcome document set out methodologies for \r\nthe PBC to strengthen concrete interactions and \r\nsynergies with the private sector in a meaningful \r\nmanner, especially in areas involving funding sources, \r\nmicrofinance and remittances. However, to date, due to \r\ncertain viewpoints on the limited role of the PBC, such \r\nrecommendations have not materialized. The report at \r\nhand on the PBC review highlights the urgency of \r\nresource mobilization as an entry point for the PBC to \r\nconsider its potential for a greater role in engaging \r\nother stakeholders, such as the private sector. \r\n We also note that the report of the co-facilitators \r\nreflects the current reality of the nexus between \r\npeacekeeping and peacebuilding. It serves as a wake-\r\nup call for all of us to strengthen our collective \r\ndetermination to deal with peacebuilding and \r\npeacekeeping in a more comprehensive manner. \r\nPeacebuilding efforts must occur in parallel to \r\npeacekeeping; it is therefore imperative that the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission engage in an early and \r\nseamless manner. \r\n Therefore, Indonesia is of the view there is a very \r\nclose connection between the review process of the \r\nPBC and the ongoing review of civilian capacity \r\ncurrently being conducted by the Secretary-General. \r\nThe latter serves as an important strategy of the United \r\nNations in the areas of conflict prevention, \r\npeacekeeping and the intermediate aftermath of \r\nconflict. The draft resolution on the PBC review as it \r\nstands is in line with these two important review \r\nprocesses. \r\n In this regard, Indonesia is taking keen interest in \r\nthe ongoing review of civilian capacity in those two \r\nimportant areas, and emphasizes that the PBC should \r\nhave a bigger role in the process of broadening and \r\ndeepening the pool of experts, giving particular \r\nattention to mobilizing the capacities of developing \r\ncountries and of women. We also join others who \r\nbelieve that the implementation of the report’s \r\nrecommendations in an integrated manner will help \r\npave the way for a revitalized Peacebuilding \r\nCommission — one which is more relevant, more \r\nflexible, better performing, more empowered, better \r\nsupported, more ambitious and better understood. \r\n In closing, I would like to reiterate my \r\ndelegation’s firm belief in the contribution that the \r\nPBC has made and will continue to make in the future \r\nto peacebuilding efforts in various parts of the world, \r\nprovided that it continues to receive sustained and \r\nsteadfast support from the international community. To \r\nthat end, my delegation reaffirms its unwavering \r\nsupport to any effort to advance the work of the PBC. \r\n Mr. Sumi (Japan): I would like to thank the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly for convening this \r\nimportant meeting to consider the outcome of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission (PBC) review. I would also \r\nlike to extend my gratitude to the co-facilitators, the \r\nAmbassadors of Ireland, Mexico and South Africa, for \r\n A/65/PV.40\r\n \r\n9 10-61032 \r\n \r\npresenting their report entitled, “Review of the United \r\nNations peacebuilding architecture” (A/64/868, annex). \r\n Japan welcomes the report presented by the co-\r\nfacilitators and urges all related United Nations organs \r\nto take forward the relevant recommendations of the \r\nco-facilitators, with the aim of further improving the \r\nimpact of PBC activities on the ground. In this regard, \r\nI would like to express Japan’s support for the draft \r\nresolution (A/64/L.7) before the Assembly. In order to \r\ntake forward the co-facilitators’ recommendations, I \r\nwould like to raise the following three points for \r\nfurther consideration. \r\n First, Japan would like to stress once again the \r\nneed to diversify the approach of the PBC’s \r\nengagement in post-conflict countries. As suggested by \r\nthe co-facilitators, we should consider employing \r\nlighter approaches than the current full country-\r\nspecific configuration. Therefore, Japan supports the \r\nidea of seeking a multitiered approach — sectoral, \r\nregional and “light footprint” engagement — as noted \r\nin paragraph 95 of the report. The priority agenda for \r\nthe PBC’s engagement in Liberia that we are now \r\ndiscussing through the draft statement of mutual \r\ncommitments on peacebuilding should be more \r\ntargeted and focused. \r\n Another useful approach is to consider a specific \r\nfocus in a cross-country and cross-sectoral manner. As \r\nthe co-facilitators point out in paragraph 55 of their \r\nreport, youth employment has been identified as a \r\npotential Achilles’ heel in any peacebuilding process. \r\nJapan considers that the PBC has a role to play in \r\ndeveloping strategies based on such perspectives, \r\nwhich require special attention. \r\n In this regard, I would like to recall the \r\ndiscussion in the working group on lessons learned on \r\nthe issue of post-conflict employment. This year, the \r\nPBC should follow up that discussion and apply the \r\nlessons learned to the actual activities on the ground. \r\nIn addition, as the representative of Canada proposed \r\nin the most recent meeting of the Liberia country-\r\nspecific configuration, cooperation between the \r\ncountry-specific configurations of Liberia and Sierra \r\nLeone is also useful in promoting youth employment in \r\nthe post-conflict situation in relation to the Mano River \r\nInitiative. \r\n Secondly, I would like to stress the importance of \r\nstrengthening the PBC’s advisory role to the Security \r\nCouncil. To that end, Japan supports the co-facilitators’ \r\nrecommendation in paragraph 109 that the \r\nconsultations between the Security Council and the \r\nPBC be enhanced. In that connection, I am delighted to \r\nnote that the newly adopted note by the President of \r\nthe Security Council on working methods (S/2010/507) \r\nechoes the co-facilitators’ recommendation. I would \r\nlike to report that Japan chaired the informal working \r\ngroup on the working methods of the Security Council. \r\n In paragraph 61 of the annex to presidential note \r\nA/65/507, the Council expresses its intention \r\n “to invite the Chairs of country-specific \r\nconfigurations of the Peacebuilding Commission \r\nto participate in formal Security Council \r\nmeetings at which the situation concerning the \r\ncountry in question is considered, or on a case-\r\nby-case basis, for an exchange of views in an \r\ninformal dialogue”. \r\nJapan would like to explore the possibility of having \r\nsuch an informal dialogue, ideally on Liberia, at an \r\nappropriate occasion before the end of the year. \r\n Thirdly, Japan generally supports the notion that \r\nthe function of the Peacebuilding Support Office \r\n(PBSO) must be enhanced to maximize the \r\neffectiveness of PBC programmes. On the other hand, \r\nwe would like to stress the need for the PBSO to \r\nclarify the division of roles and its comparative \r\nadvantage in relation to other, related United Nations \r\ndepartments. Japan supports the co-facilitators’ \r\nrecommendation, in paragraph 109, that the head of \r\nPBSO be invited to brief the Security Council in the \r\nsame manner as the heads of the Department of \r\nPeacekeeping Operations, the Department of Political \r\nAffairs and the Office for the Coordination of \r\nHumanitarian Affairs. However, careful examination is \r\nnecessary in considering the question of the ratio of \r\ncore to non-core staff within PBSO, as mentioned in \r\nparagraph 149. \r\n In addition, we should further look into creating \r\nsynergy between the PBC and the Peacebuilding Fund. \r\nWe have no objection to the idea that the Peacebuilding \r\nFund should retain decision-making autonomy on the \r\nallocation of its funds, but we believe that the PBC can \r\nprovide strategic guidance as well. In this context, \r\nJapan supports the strengthening of such interaction \r\nbetween chairs, the PBSO and the Peacebuilding Fund \r\nAdvisory Group. \r\nA/65/PV.40  \r\n \r\n10-61032 10 \r\n \r\n In conclusion, I would like to reiterate our \r\nreadiness to participate in the coming discussion on \r\nhow we may move forward the implementation of the \r\nrecommendations of the co-facilitators. Japan \r\nencourages the PBC to expedite the discussion to this \r\nend. Japan stands ready to actively take part in those \r\nefforts. \r\n Mr. Aeschlimann (Switzerland) (spoke in \r\nFrench): The creation of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission (PBC) was of real benefit. Since its \r\ncreation in 2005, the PBC has proven its value. \r\nThrough its national configurations, it has managed to \r\ncontribute to peacebuilding in the countries on its \r\nagenda. Peacebuilding nonetheless requires considerable \r\ncommitment in the form of political, institutional and \r\nfinancial investment. We therefore need to make it one \r\nof our highest priorities. \r\n As stressed in the co-facilitators’ review \r\n(A/64/868, annex), the peacebuilding architecture \r\ndeserves to be further improved and strengthened. \r\nSwitzerland welcomes this worthwhile report, which, \r\nin our view, addresses the essential issues and includes \r\nappropriate recommendations in the light of the \r\nchallenges ahead. \r\n It is our firm conviction that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s leadership is essential to ensuring adequate \r\nfollow-up for the implementation of the report’s \r\nrecommendations. Most of the recommendations can \r\nbe implemented in their current form by the organs to \r\nwhich they are addressed. We believe that follow-up on \r\ntheir implementation should be ensured, for example, \r\nby the PBC Organizational Committee. \r\n In our capacity as Chair of the Burundi \r\nconfiguration, we have drawn the following three \r\nlessons. First, countries on the PBC agenda hold the \r\nkey to the success of the exercise. Their commitment \r\nand political will determine the process. This \r\ncommitment must be shared by civil society and \r\nexpressed through its direct involvement in the \r\npeacebuilding process. The configurations have no \r\ndecision-making power; their relationship with the \r\nrelevant countries is comparable to that of a client and \r\nhis attorney. \r\n A second determining factor is the shared \r\ndefinition of clear, realistic and tangible objectives. \r\nThe PBC and the countries on its agenda must agree on \r\nthe expectations and objectives for both sides. \r\nDialogue and monitoring should help to evaluate \r\nprogress and determine the steps required. \r\n Thirdly, the Chair needs specific support for its \r\nfunctions in New York and adequate support in the \r\nfield, as stressed by the co-facilitators. It is important \r\nto ensure the continuity, predictability and expertise \r\nrequired for the work of the Chair. This could be done \r\nby strengthening the PBSO. \r\n We are in favour of a regular dialogue between \r\nthe Security Council and the Chair of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission. Moreover, we would like \r\nto see the Security Council further involve the \r\ncountries concerned and invite the chairs of their \r\nrespective configurations to participate in the related \r\ninformal consultations. Since the PBC also draws its \r\nlegitimacy from its relationship with the General \r\nAssembly, we should also explore ways to deal more \r\nsubstantially with peacebuilding issues in the \r\nAssembly and the Economic and Social Council. This \r\npossibility should be seriously explored. We think that \r\neconomic and social questions can play a central role \r\nin efforts to adequately respond to peacebuilding \r\nchallenges. \r\n The role and identity of the Organizational \r\nCommittee deserve in-depth consideration. The \r\nOrganizational Committee needs to be given greater \r\nimportance, for example, by strengthening its function \r\nof regular follow-up of the work of the various \r\nconfigurations and by using it more as a forum for \r\nexchanges of experience or good practices in the area \r\nof peacebuilding. With this in mind, Switzerland \r\nsupports the report’s suggestion that the working group \r\non lessons learned be integrated into the Organizational \r\nCommittee. \r\n In conclusion, it is our view that the review of the \r\nPBC must enable the international community to \r\nrecommit itself to meeting the challenges in the area of \r\npeacebuilding. We therefore support a determined \r\neffort to pursue the implementation of the \r\nrecommendations of the Secretary-General and the co-\r\nfacilitators’ report. \r\n Mr. Errázuriz (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): First \r\nof all, my delegation thanks the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly on having convened this debate on \r\nthe United Nations peacebuilding architecture and the \r\nconsultations that have taken place. \r\n A/65/PV.40\r\n \r\n11 10-61032 \r\n \r\n With draft resolution A/65/L.7 before the \r\nAssembly, an important cycle in the review of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission has been concluded. We \r\nmust now implement its recommendations with a view \r\nto improving the peacebuilding architecture and its \r\neffectiveness. I would also like to congratulate the \r\nrepresentative of Uganda, in his capacity as President \r\nof the Security Council, on having completed the \r\nreview process during his presidency. \r\n Chile aligns itself with the statement made by the \r\nPermanent Representative of Bangladesh on behalf of \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement countries. Chile would \r\nalso like to congratulate the three co-facilitators of the \r\nreview process of the Peacebuilding Commission — \r\nthe Permanent Representatives of Ireland, Mexico and \r\nSouth Africa — on the excellent work they have done \r\nand for the comprehensive and inclusive process they \r\nhave undertaken, which has culminated in a \r\ncomprehensive and balanced report (A/64/868, annex). \r\n Chile, as pro tempore Secretary of the Rio Group, \r\nhad the opportunity to organize a meeting of the \r\nco-facilitators with the members of the Rio Group. We \r\nwould like to thank the Chair of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, Ambassador Peter Wittig of Germany, \r\nand the Commission’s previous Chair, for the excellent \r\nwork they have done. \r\n We would also like to thank the chairs of the \r\ncountry-specific configurations for their dedicated \r\nwork. I would particularly like to mention the \r\nparticipation of developing countries in the country-\r\nspecific configurations. In this regard, the excellent \r\nwork of the Permanent Representative of Brazil, \r\nheading the country-specific configuration for Guinea-\r\nBissau, deserves special recognition. Liberia’s recent \r\nincorporation into the agenda of the Commission, with \r\nthe Permanent Representative of Jordan as Chair of \r\nthat country-specific configuration, leads me to hope \r\nthat we will see greater and more decisive participation \r\nof our countries in this important area of the work of \r\nthe United Nations. \r\n We would also like to express our thanks for the \r\npresentation of the draft resolution, on which we will \r\nvote shortly. We believe that it reflects the report and \r\nrecommendations of the co-facilitators, and we hope \r\nthat its adoption will launch a new stage in the life of \r\nthe Commission, in which relationships with other \r\nUnited Nations departments and agencies will be \r\nstrengthened, particularly those directly involved in \r\npeacebuilding and peacekeeping activities. This new \r\nstage should at the same time be characterized by daily, \r\nregular work with the principal organs of the United \r\nNations. In this regard, we note the co-facilitators’ \r\nrecommendation that there should be informal and \r\nregular dialogue in the framework not only of the \r\nSecurity Council, but also of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil and the General Assembly. \r\n Given the fact that gender issues are relevant to \r\nthe founding resolutions of the Commission, we hope \r\nthat there will be close cooperation with the recently \r\ncreated gender entity, UN Women. Similarly, in this \r\nsecond five years of the PBC’s existence, we hope to \r\nsee a stronger Peacebuilding Support Office to ensure \r\nthe human and financial resources essential to meeting \r\nthe challenges that confront the countries on the \r\nCommission’s agenda. We also look forward with \r\ninterest to the debate involving the members of the \r\nCommission in order to see how we can implement the \r\nco-facilitators’ recommendations. Chile will continue \r\nto participate in that discussion, and will propose that \r\nmeetings of the Organizational Committee be open to \r\nall States Members of the United Nations. We believe \r\nthat this practical measure will allow Members to get \r\nto know the work of the Commission. We believe that \r\nthe principle of national ownership should continue to \r\nbe the cornerstone on which rest the peacebuilding \r\nprocess and its three pillars: security, development and \r\nhuman rights. \r\n In conclusion, we would like to say that the \r\nrecent incorporation of Liberia as the fifth country on \r\nthe Commission’s agenda was an important step in the \r\nright direction of incorporating a new country in a \r\npartial way and with a limited mandate, in accordance \r\nwith the request of the Government concerned. It is \r\nthus the first country to implement the multitier \r\nprinciple. \r\n Mr. Vilović (Croatia): My delegation aligns itself \r\nwith the statement of the European Union, which we \r\nwholeheartedly support. However, allow me to take \r\npart in this timely and exceptionally relevant debate by \r\nadding a few short comments in my national capacity. \r\n As we pointed out a few days ago during the \r\nSecurity Council debate (see S/PV.6396) on the \r\nSecretary-General’s overview of the progress achieved \r\nin the implementation of his agenda for action, set out \r\nin his reports on peacebuilding in the aftermath of \r\nconflict (A/64/866) and the participation of women in \r\nA/65/PV.40  \r\n \r\n10-61032 12 \r\n \r\npeacebuilding (A/65/354), it is obvious that broad \r\ncross-regional support for stronger peacebuilding is \r\nincreasing, encompassing Governments, international \r\norganizations and civil society. \r\n It is our strong belief that, in the rapidly changing \r\nenvironment we live in, which constantly puts new \r\nchallenges on our agenda, we have to painstakingly \r\nmaintain hard-won gains and make every effort not to \r\nreopen battles we have already won. Furthermore, we \r\nare of the view that every relapse into conflict brings \r\neven more despair and disappointment than its initial \r\noutbreak, since it undoubtedly worsens existing \r\nproblems, annihilates all national achievements and \r\nconfirms the curse of the vicious cycle that we are \r\ntrying so hard to eliminate. \r\n As I have pointed out on previous occasions, it is \r\nour conviction that the time to establish a new balance \r\nwithin the United Nations peacebuilding architecture \r\nhas definitely arrived and that we have to make the \r\nmost of the new momentum we currently possess. In \r\nthat light, Croatia welcomes the excellent report on the \r\nreview of the United Nations peacebuilding \r\narchitecture (A/64/868, annex) presented by the three \r\nco-facilitators, and fully supports the recommendations \r\ncontained therein, based on the field experience to date \r\nwith the countries on the agenda of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission (PBC). \r\n The report certainly represents a sound basis for \r\nthe needed renewal of our peacebuilding efforts and \r\nstronger pursuit of our peacebuilding commitments. \r\nWe particularly welcome the open, transparent and \r\ninclusive process by which the co-facilitators \r\naccomplished their demanding task, as well as their \r\nefforts to achieve the widest possible participation of \r\nall relevant stakeholders in this comprehensive \r\nexercise. \r\n In conclusion, allow me to underscore two of the \r\nmain findings of the co-facilitators’ report that are \r\ngenerally accepted and widely confirmed and, in our \r\nopinion, certainly worth repeating, and without which \r\nthere can be no successful peacebuilding: first, national \r\nownership, with all its implications, and in particular \r\ncomprehensive capacity-building; and secondly, the \r\nsustainability of resources. Obviously, without the first, \r\npeacebuilding becomes an artificial, international self-\r\ncentred exercise with no roots and no hope for durable \r\nsuccess. Without the second, peacekeeping will fade \r\naway soon after its enthusiastic introduction, but long \r\nbefore producing its eagerly awaited results: security, \r\ndevelopment and lasting peace. \r\n Finally, let me finish by expressing our strong \r\nsupport for the draft resolution before us (A/65/L.7), as \r\nwell as our conviction that the appropriate \r\nimplementation of the recommendations contained in \r\nthe co-facilitators’ report — combined with a thorough \r\nexamination of the Secretary-General’s ambitious \r\nagenda for action and careful consideration of his latest \r\nrequests, proposals and recommendations — will bear \r\nfruit and bring us significantly closer to our common \r\ngoal — sustainable, comprehensive and cost-effective \r\npeacebuilding. \r\n Mr. Quinlan (Australia): I would first like to \r\nthank the President of the Assembly for convening \r\ntoday’s debate. Building the defences of peace is the \r\nmost difficult work we can undertake, but of course it \r\nis also the most essential. \r\n At the outset, I would like to very much \r\ncommend the Permanent Representatives of Ireland, \r\nMexico and South Africa for their leadership of our \r\nefforts throughout this review of the United Nations \r\npeacebuilding architecture. \r\n Australia’s own recent direct experience in \r\npeacebuilding endeavours in Timor-Leste, Solomon \r\nIslands and Papua New Guinea have taught us a \r\nnumber of lessons that have come to be accepted as \r\nself-evident truths about peacebuilding and which are \r\nreflected in the co-facilitators’ report (A/64/868, \r\nannex). For example, effective peacebuilding requires a \r\nlong-term commitment in support of national \r\nownership and national plans. Effective peacebuilding \r\nis a complex and challenging undertaking that demands \r\nthe coordinated engagement of a range of actors from \r\nthe outset to address political, security, humanitarian \r\nand development needs in parallel. Effective \r\npeacebuilding demands a continual focus on the \r\ndelivery of actual outcomes on the ground and on \r\nhelping countries emerge from conflict and develop as \r\nstable and prosperous nations. \r\n Obviously, the peacebuilding architecture in New \r\nYork needs to support that reality, and we therefore \r\nvery much support the co-facilitators’ report. It is \r\nfirmly grounded in reality and, once implemented, \r\nshould lead to what the co-facilitators envisage as a \r\nmore relevant, flexible, empowered and better \r\nunderstood Peacebuilding Commission (PBC) and, \r\nabove all, a more ambitious one — more the kind of \r\n A/65/PV.40\r\n \r\n13 10-61032 \r\n \r\nPeacebuilding Commission that our own leaders had in \r\nmind in 2005. Such an outcome, of course, is in the \r\ninterests of all Member States. \r\n There are three threads to the report that I would \r\nlike to touch on quickly today. \r\n The first is the need for stronger partnerships. \r\nThe report notes, unsurprisingly, that effective \r\npeacebuilding must accompany peacekeeping from the \r\nvery inception. In other words, the planning of peace \r\noperations should be seen not as a military task alone, \r\nbut as one that demands a multitude of voices, \r\ncombining political, humanitarian and development \r\nconsiderations with the security dimension. \r\nFurthermore, adequate resources clearly must be \r\nallocated to address those critical activities from the \r\nbeginning. If left unfunded, these things, of course, \r\nhave the potential to threaten peace. \r\n The unique composition of the PBC, bringing \r\ntogether engaged Member States, United Nations \r\npartners, regional organizations and international \r\nfinancial institutions, is vital to that endeavour. In turn, \r\na closer and more organic relationship between the \r\nSecurity Council and the PBC is essential, and is \r\nneeded throughout the whole process to ensure that the \r\nCouncil’s consideration of a situation provides an \r\navenue through which those disparate voices are heard \r\nin the planning of peace operations. That should be \r\ndone, of course, in close cooperation, as I have said, \r\norganically with the PBC. \r\n It is equally important that a strong partnership \r\nexist between the international community and the \r\nconflict-affected Member State itself. The PBC should \r\nbe seen as a forum in which the international \r\ncommunity listens not only to itself, but also to the \r\ncountry under consideration, to ensure that a true \r\npartnership can develop between the two. \r\n Secondly, there is obviously a need for greater \r\nflexibility. We need to be cognizant of and able to \r\nrespond to the rapidly changing political and security \r\ncontext in post-conflict societies. We need to equally \r\nbalance the need for rapid responses to short-term \r\nissues, particularly security issues, against our steady \r\nefforts on longer-term goals. The report recommends \r\nflexibility in the modes of PBC engagement, tailoring \r\nits support to the needs of a particular situation. That \r\ndoes not negate the need for a holistic approach to the \r\npeacebuilding challenges in the country as a whole, but \r\nrather it challenges us and the PBC to ensure that its \r\nengagement is really adding value. \r\n Thirdly, the need for greater cohesiveness is well \r\nunderstood. The report recommends the use of a single \r\noverall planning document around which the national \r\nauthorities and the international community can \r\ncoalesce. That will ensure that all actors, national and \r\ninternational, have a shared understanding of all the \r\nfactors that affect a nation’s ability to build a \r\nsustainable peace and are able to align their activities \r\nto achieve the best outcome. The PBC needs to \r\nencourage our collective peacebuilding efforts in \r\nsupport of a single national plan and to ensure that its \r\nown activities are equally aligned to the plan. \r\n Our debate today represents only the end of the \r\nbeginning of our work. We now need to turn to the \r\nearly implementation of the report’s recommendations. \r\nTo that end, we strongly support the draft resolution \r\n(A/65/L.7) — indeed, we could have supported an even \r\nstronger resolution — that will be adopted at the end of \r\nthis meeting and its mechanisms for keeping the \r\nprocess of implementation under annual review. \r\n We welcome the intention of PBC Chairman \r\nAmbassador Wittig to shortly convene an in-depth \r\ndiscussion on the way forward in implementing the \r\nreport’s recommendations. We must collectively rise to \r\nthe challenge of ensuring that we learn the lessons of \r\nthe past five years, as distilled in this very helpful \r\nreview, and improve the operation of the peacebuilding \r\narchitecture to deliver better results for countries \r\nemerging from conflict. \r\n To conclude, the report notes that a new approach \r\nto peace operations is a challenge that confronts the \r\nUnited Nations as a whole. It calls for a shift in \r\nmindset, away from the current predominantly \r\npeacekeeping one to a mindset in which peacekeeping \r\nis seen as only one part, albeit the most decisive and \r\ninfluential at the beginning, of a broader peacebuilding \r\neffort. \r\n I know that we all agree that our key focus needs \r\nto be on helping countries emerge from conflict and \r\ndevelop as stable and prosperous nations. We need to \r\nlet that focus be our guide and shape our New York-\r\nbased structures accordingly. \r\n Mr. Wittig (Germany): In my capacity as Chair \r\nof the Peacebuilding Commission (PBC), I would like \r\nto make the following brief remarks. \r\nA/65/PV.40  \r\n \r\n10-61032 14 \r\n \r\n The Peacebuilding Commission welcomes the \r\naction expected today by the General Assembly on the \r\ndraft resolution contained in document A/65/L.7. I \r\nwould like to thank the three co-facilitators for their \r\nexcellent report (A/64/868, annex) and their tireless \r\nefforts throughout the consultations and drafting \r\nprocesses. \r\n The draft resolution before the General Assembly \r\ntoday clearly spells out the need to take forward the \r\nimplementation of the relevant recommendations \r\ncontained in the report, with the aim of improving the \r\neffectiveness of the Commission. The РВС intends to \r\ntake its role and responsibility in the implementation of \r\nthe relevant recommendations very seriously. Indeed, \r\nthe Commission has already taken initial steps in \r\nresponse to a number of issues and challenges reflected \r\nin the report. Most recently, the process of engaging \r\nLiberia, the fifth country to be placed on the \r\nCommission’s agenda, represents an important step in \r\nthat direction. \r\n Furthermore, the PBC intends to convene shortly \r\nan in-depth discussion on the way forward in \r\nimplementing the relevant recommendations. We will \r\nrely on our collective wisdom and renewed \r\ncommitment to ensure that the interests and aspirations \r\nof the countries on the Commission’s agenda will \r\nremain the focus of any future actions. \r\n To that end, we look forward to working closely \r\nwith the Secretary-General, the United Nations system \r\n— the General Assembly, the Security Council and the \r\nEconomic and Social Council — regional \r\norganizations, international financial institutions and \r\nall relevant stakeholders in the countries on the PBC \r\nagenda and beyond. \r\n The 2010 review process has generated political \r\nmomentum and underscored the evolving prominence \r\nof post-conflict peacebuilding at the United Nations. \r\nLet us all capitalize on this momentum and move \r\nforward with determination and conviction. \r\n Allow me to add some remarks in my national \r\ncapacity. Germany fully aligns itself with the remarks \r\nmade by the Permanent Representative of Belgium on \r\nbehalf of the European Union. As a strong supporter of \r\nthe United Nations peacebuilding architecture, \r\nGermany welcomes and commends the most valuable \r\nwork of the co-facilitators and their excellent report. \r\nGermany fully supports the recommendations of the \r\nreport of the co-facilitators and is committed to \r\nworking together with all relevant actors inside and \r\noutside the United Nations system in order to take \r\nforward their implementation and to increase the \r\neffectiveness of the Peacebuilding Commission and its \r\nsupport provided by the Peacebuilding Support Office. \r\n I would like the thank the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and his Office for convening this \r\nimportant debate today and for presenting the draft \r\nresolution, which Germany fully supports. Broad \r\nsupport within the United Nations architecture is \r\nimportant for the future work of the PBC. Only with \r\nthe approval and support of the Security Council and \r\nthe General Assembly can the PBC fruitfully continue \r\nits work and fully contribute to the peacebuilding \r\nmechanisms of the United Nations. \r\n Mr. Adik (India): I would like to thank the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly for convening \r\ntoday’s meeting on a topic of importance and \r\nsignificance to all of us. Let me at the outset align my \r\ndelegation with the statement delivered by my \r\ncolleague from Bangladesh on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement. \r\n Because of time constraints, I will not read out \r\nthe full text of my statement, which I have circulated in \r\nthe Hall. I will refer only to certain parts of my \r\nstatement. \r\n I wish to begin by echoing the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s assertion, in his report last year on \r\npeacebuilding in the immediate aftermath of conflict \r\n(A/63/881), wherein he emphasized the imperative of \r\nnational ownership and the anchoring of international \r\npeacebuilding efforts at the host-country level. My \r\ndelegation recognizes the importance of post-conflict \r\npeacebuilding as the foundation for building \r\nsustainable peace, security and development in the \r\naftermath of conflict. \r\n Sustainable peacebuilding requires an integrated \r\napproach with coherence among activities in the realms \r\nof politics, security, development, human rights and the \r\nrule of law. Security clearly is the key peacebuilding \r\npillar. Capacity-building also assumes significance, \r\nespecially in instances where countries find it difficult \r\nto completely utilize the financial assistance they have \r\nbeen provided. It is equally important to focus on \r\nbuilding economic opportunity, particularly for young \r\npeople, along with political and social stability. \r\nUnemployment among the young is a major factor in \r\nthe perpetuation of the underlying causes of conflict. \r\n A/65/PV.40\r\n \r\n15 10-61032 \r\n \r\nEconomic revitalization and economic opportunity, \r\nespecially among the young, are crucial in achieving \r\nsustainable peace and security. \r\n Another key issue is that of financing. Let us be \r\nclear and acknowledge the fact that the lack of funding \r\ncontinues to be a major impediment to the success of \r\npeacebuilding initiatives. It goes without saying that \r\nother elements, such as human resources and technical \r\nassistance through the provision of appropriate \r\ntechnologies, are important as well. \r\n Given the sensitivities of such peacebuilding \r\ntasks as security sector reform and development \r\nadministration, a high degree of coordination within \r\nthe United Nations is desirable. Work in the country-\r\nspecific configurations has been a positive dimension. \r\nMy delegation is therefore of the view that the \r\ninternational community, acting through the \r\ninstrumentality of the Peacebuilding Commission \r\n(PBC), must always strive to ensure that there is a two-\r\nway dialogue between countries on the agenda of the \r\nPBC and the Commission. Of particular importance are \r\nconsultations with troop- and police-contributing \r\ncountries, both individually and through the \r\ninstrumentality of the PBC, while formulating and \r\nrevising mandates of United Nations missions. \r\n Ever since the creation of the PBC in December \r\n2005, India, as a member of the Organizational \r\nCommittee, has engaged itself constructively with the \r\nwork of the PBC. We have contributed to the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund in the spirit of supporting the Fund \r\nin achieving its task as mandated by the General \r\nAssembly and the Security Council. Further, we are of \r\nthe view that the Fund should act as a catalyst for good \r\ngovernance. In this regard, we note with approval the \r\ncreation of the Senior Advisory Group for the Review \r\nof International Civilian Capacities in fulfilment of the \r\nagenda for action outlined by the Secretary-General in \r\nhis 2009 report on peacebuilding in the immediate \r\naftermath of conflict. \r\n My delegation is of the view that the international \r\ncommunity, acting through the instrumentality of the \r\nPBC, must always strive to ensure that there is \r\neffective two-way dialogue between countries on the \r\nagenda of the PBC and the Commission itself. In this \r\nregard, it is important that the ongoing review reorient \r\nthe existing peacebuilding architecture in order to \r\nenable the Organizational Committee and the PBC to \r\nplay a more decisive role in formulating the \r\nCommission’s approach to post-conflict situations. \r\nAlso, the country-specific configurations must not run \r\nahead of national Governments in setting targets. \r\nNational needs rather than normative prescriptions \r\nshould determine peacebuilding priorities. \r\n A mechanism should be devised to incorporate \r\nthe wealth of experience that is available with the \r\ntroops on the ground. No effort should be spared that \r\nmight enrich the peacebuilding process in a post-\r\nconflict society. To maximize the peace dividend \r\nthrough peacebuilding and peacekeeping, it is \r\nnecessary that mandates be mindful of the specificities \r\non the ground. The Commission and the Organizational \r\nCommittee should play an important role in this regard. \r\n It is neither possible nor desirable to transplant \r\nmodels specific to one region to another context. The \r\ninternational community must not be unduly eager for \r\na standard implementation to bring peace in a hurry. \r\nSustainable peace has to be earned diligently, \r\nempathetically and inclusively. In that regard, regional \r\nand subregional approaches to crisis situations have \r\ngreat relevance while peacekeeping and peacebuilding \r\nmandates are being worked out at the United Nations. \r\nWe believe that the peacebuilding architecture must \r\ninstitutionalize structures and processes to that end. \r\n To assist the Peacebuilding Commission in \r\ncarrying out the task under its mandate as an \r\nintergovernmental advisory body, it is incumbent upon \r\nall organs of the peacebuilding architecture, such as the \r\nGeneral Assembly, the Security Council and the \r\nEconomic and Social Council, to work in a coordinated \r\nand coherent manner. The Commission should not \r\nmerely advise States on post-conflict peace \r\nconsolidation but should rather help with the efficient \r\nharnessing of international expertise. \r\n We must be cognizant of the fact that \r\npeacebuilding is still a concept in its infancy and is \r\ncontinuously evolving. The international community \r\nhas taken the idea of peacebuilding on board in order \r\nto fulfil the important need of handling post-conflict \r\nsituations. It is therefore imperative that we ensure that \r\nthe institutions that constitute the peacebuilding \r\narchitecture and peacebuilding itself are successful. \r\n In conclusion, let me share India’s unique nation-\r\nbuilding expertise in wide-ranging and diverse settings. \r\nWe have strived for a better life for our people. In the \r\nprocess, we as a nation have acquired capacities \r\nrelevant to development and peacebuilding. We have \r\nA/65/PV.40  \r\n \r\n10-61032 16 \r\n \r\nshared our experience with a number of countries \r\nmaking the transition from conflict to peace. We will \r\ncontinue to make our abilities available to countries in \r\npost-conflict situations and cooperate with the United \r\nNations in its peacebuilding endeavours. \r\n Mr. Parham (United Kingdom): I would first \r\nlike to thank the President for organizing today’s \r\ndebate, which, along with the adoption of the draft \r\nresolution we have before us (A/65/L.7), marks an \r\nimportant stage in our efforts to improve the impact of \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission. \r\n Like others before me, I would like to offer my \r\nparticular thanks to the three co-facilitators for their \r\ntireless efforts in undertaking the review. The review \r\nreport (A/65/868, annex) provides some useful \r\nrecommendations that will sharpen the work of the \r\nCommission. I would like to highlight in particular \r\nthose recommendations relating to the Commission’s \r\ncountry-specific work. An emphasis on better analysis \r\nand a focus on the key bottlenecks to peace in a \r\nspecific country and on establishing mutual \r\ncommitments between the Government and the \r\ninternational community on how best to unblock the \r\nbottlenecks will put the Commission in much better \r\nstanding for achieving results. \r\n So too will the proposals for the Commission to \r\ntake a flexible approach to its country work and the \r\npotential for the Commission’s work to be chaired by a \r\ncountry rather than by an individual. Those proposals \r\nwill also help sharpen the Commission’s advice to the \r\nSecurity Council, the General Assembly and the \r\nEconomic and Social Council. We also support efforts \r\nto forge a much more dynamic relationship between the \r\nSecurity Council and the Commission. \r\n But the report is not the end of the process. We \r\nmust now move quickly to the next stage of bringing \r\nthese recommendations forward and ensuring that the \r\nCommission makes a real difference on the ground. \r\n There are big challenges to be met in the coming \r\nmonths. In practical terms, we need to see genuine \r\nprogress on issues like security sector reform in \r\nGuinea-Bissau; the elections and disarmament, \r\ndemobilization and reintegration in the Central African \r\nRepublic; and strengthening of the rule of law and \r\nsecurity sector reform in Liberia. We hope that, by \r\ndemonstrating results, the Commission will become a \r\nmuch more sought after and influential body, engaging \r\neffectively in countries on its agenda. \r\n When we meet here again in five years’ time \r\nfollowing the next review, we shall judge ourselves \r\nagainst these kinds of benchmarks. The United \r\nKingdom reiterates its firm commitment to help ensure \r\nthat we do. \r\n Mr. Pankin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): The Russian Federation supports the work of \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission as an important \r\ninstrument for enhancing effectiveness and \r\nstrengthening the coordination of cooperation in \r\ninternational peacekeeping activities in post-conflict \r\nStates with the participation of international financial \r\ninstitutions, while complying with the main \r\nprerogatives of the main bodies of the Organization, in \r\nparticular the Security Council. \r\n We think that the review of the work of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission that has been conducted \r\nthis year will make it possible for us to continue work \r\non further improving and enhancing the impact of the \r\nwork of the Commission. We think that the fact of \r\nconducting this review has already led to increased \r\ninterest and attention to the peacebuilding efforts of the \r\nUnited Nations and the work of the Commission in \r\nparticular, which is something that is very positive. \r\n We would like to thank the co-facilitators of the \r\nprocess of reviewing the Peacebuilding Support Office, \r\nnamely the Permanent Representatives of Mexico, \r\nIreland and South Africa, for preparing the report \r\n(A/64/838, annex). The report highlights a host of \r\nproblems that the Commission encounters in its work. \r\nWhat is important is that it confirms the advisory and \r\ncoordinating function of the Commission and the \r\nprimacy of the principle of national responsibility and \r\nthe priority of strengthening the national capacity of \r\ncountries that find themselves in the post-conflict \r\nphase of their development. \r\n Many of the proposals contained in the report \r\nprepared by the co-facilitators deserve to be supported. \r\nHowever, they need to be examined in detail, along \r\nwith the appropriate bodies of the United Nations on \r\nthe basis of their competence and mandates, before \r\nimplementing the proposals, if indeed they are found to \r\nbe acceptable. That is what the draft resolution before \r\nus urges us to do. We are ready to adopt it.. \r\n Mr. Barton (United States of America): The \r\nUnited States of America would like to thank our \r\ncolleagues from Ireland, Mexico and South Africa for \r\n A/65/PV.40\r\n \r\n17 10-61032 \r\n \r\ntheir fine work. We welcome their comprehensive \r\nreport (A/64/838, annex). \r\n The review of the Peacebuilding Commission \r\nprovides many important recommendations on how to \r\nmove peacebuilding forward, from greater coordination \r\nbetween New York, the field and the United Nations \r\nsystem overall to how to truly incorporate gender into \r\nways to build national ownership. The United States \r\nstrongly supports the Peacebuilding Commission’s \r\nwork and this review, as promoting sustainable peace \r\nlies at the heart of the United Nations mission. \r\n Former Secretary-General Annan used to speak of \r\nthe missing middle between peacekeeping and \r\nsustainable development. The Commission is striving \r\nto meet that commitment by linking ambitions in New \r\nYork with programmes in the field, coordinating better \r\nwith international institutions, running programmes \r\nand assessing needs in post-conflict countries. The \r\nCommission should encourage actors to support \r\ncoherence in the field through more inclusive dialogue, \r\ngreater innovation, stronger best practices and better \r\nresource delivery and capacity-building. We urge the \r\nCommission to more systematically and substantively \r\nengage women in peacemaking and post-conflict \r\nplanning processes and to commit to implementing the \r\naction plan proposed in the Secretary-General’s report \r\non women’s participation in peacebuilding (A/65/354). \r\n In the end, the success of peacebuilding depends \r\non leadership from the country emerging from conflict \r\nitself and on its own leaders and communities. The \r\nUnited Nations must make that its top priority. \r\n The Peacebuilding Commission review marks an \r\nimportant milestone as we all assess the role that the \r\nCommission — and the United Nations as a whole — \r\ncan and should play in helping post-conflict societies \r\nfind their footing on the path to lasting peace and \r\nprosperity. \r\n Mr. Travers (Canada): Draft resolution A/65/L.7, \r\nwhich is now before the General Assembly, and the \r\ndraft resolution that will be presented in the Security \r\nCouncil later today demonstrate the commitment in \r\nboth bodies to strengthening the United Nations \r\ncontribution to peacebuilding. The two draft \r\nresolutions also represent an important reaffirmation of \r\nthe role that the Peacebuilding Commission (PBC) can \r\nand should play within the United Nations. \r\n Canada welcomes the co-facilitators’ report on \r\nthe 2010 review of the United Nations peacebuilding \r\narchitecture (A/64/868, annex). The co-facilitators \r\nhave made a major contribution by detailing the way \r\nforward, and must be commended for their unflagging \r\nefforts. Equally important, the comprehensive and \r\ninclusive nature of the review process has created \r\nmuch-needed momentum towards an increasingly \r\neffective United Nations peacebuilding architecture. \r\nWhile Canada commends the consensus that the review \r\nhas built, the real test now lies with the implementation \r\nof its concrete recommendations. In this light, allow \r\nme to briefly speak to four areas that deserve particular \r\nattention. \r\n First, Canada endorses the report’s assessment \r\nthat the PBC needs to maintain a flexible, multitiered \r\napproach. The country configuration model has proved \r\nto be an effective means of engaging with countries \r\nrecovering from conflict. The inclusion of Liberia on \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission’s agenda not only \r\ndemonstrates progress but also further underscores the \r\nneed to adjust to each post-conflict context. The \r\nCommission must continue to innovate in this manner, \r\nincluding by adopting lighter forms of engagement. \r\nThis will allow greater flexibility in its responses to \r\nparticular needs and at different points in the \r\npeacebuilding process. \r\n Secondly, Canada stresses the importance of \r\ncloser cooperation with field-level peacebuilding. The \r\nCommission’s engagement must be aligned with \r\nexisting national strategies and be complementary to \r\nthe work of relevant peacebuilding actors on the \r\nground. In this respect, Canada welcomes proposals to \r\nmore effectively draw on the national resources \r\navailable within the full membership of the country \r\nconfigurations. \r\n Thirdly, the proliferation of peacebuilding actors \r\nreinforces the need for a thematic focal point to bring \r\ncoherence to broader peacebuilding efforts. The \r\nPeacebuilding Commission can productively enhance \r\nits role as a forum for supporting reform processes, \r\nsharing best practices and debating outstanding \r\ninstitutional challenges. This will require an increased \r\nwillingness to draw on expertise resident within the \r\nwider peacebuilding community. As its experience \r\nbuilds, the Commission will also be better placed to \r\nsystematize the lessons learned from its own work. \r\nA/65/PV.40  \r\n \r\n10-61032 18 \r\n \r\n Finally, the Commission must continue to \r\ndevelop stronger partnerships with other peacebuilding \r\nactors, including regional organizations, the \r\ninternational financial institutions and civil society. \r\nThis is also true within the United Nations, where there \r\nis an enduring need for closer relationships with the \r\nGeneral Assembly, the Economic and Social Council \r\nand the Security Council. In our view, enhanced \r\ncooperation between the Security Council and the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission holds particular promise. A \r\nmore effective working relationship between the two \r\nbodies, based on a clearer mutual understanding of the \r\nCommission’s role and increased use of informal \r\nlinkages, should be explored. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n Canada welcomes the conclusion of the 2010 \r\nreview of the United Nations peacebuilding \r\narchitecture. Now the hard work begins. Canada \r\nencourages all relevant United Nations actors to move \r\nforward on the recommendations of the review. In \r\nparticular, Canada looks to the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission to work closely with actors in the field, to \r\nadopt a more flexible, multitiered approach and to \r\nfocus greater attention on its potential thematic role \r\nwithin the United Nations system. Canada stands ready \r\nto play an active part in advancing this agenda. \r\n Mr. Chabi (Morocco) (spoke in French): My \r\ndelegation would like to commend the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly on his facilitating role in negotiating \r\nthe draft resolution under consideration by the \r\nAssembly today (A/65/L.7). We also wish to strongly \r\ncommend Ms. Judy Cheng Hopkins and the \r\nPeacebuilding Support Office for their excellent \r\nmanagement of that important area of United Nations \r\nwork. \r\n While we align ourselves with the statement \r\nmade by the representative of Bangladesh on behalf of \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement, my delegation would like \r\nto make the following additional points. \r\n The challenges of peacekeeping and \r\npeacebuilding are permanent. The international \r\ncommunity must realize in concrete terms and through \r\na coordinated response the principle of collective \r\nsecurity. In that context, the Kingdom of Morocco, as a \r\nmember of the Peacebuilding Commission (PBC), \r\nunderlines the importance of enhancing the \r\nCommission’s role and of taking measures to bolster its \r\nstructural, organizational and operational effectiveness, \r\nincluding by financing the Peacebuilding Fund. \r\n We note with interest the content of the co-\r\nfacilitators’ report on the review of the peacekeeping \r\narchitecture (A/64/868, annex). The report’s \r\nrecommendations deserve serious attention, especially \r\nthose relating to the coordination of local and \r\ninternational actors, the financial and qualitative \r\nstrengthening of the Support Office within the \r\nSecretariat and the creation of new cooperative \r\ndynamics between the Security Council and the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission. \r\n Five years after the establishment of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, which stirred a lot of \r\nenthusiasm in the international community, much has \r\nbeen accomplished in this area, despite the lack of \r\nmeans. Peacebuilding occupies a special place in the \r\nUnited Nations agenda. Moreover, activities in its \r\nsphere are bound to intensify, especially in the light of \r\nthe increased role of civil society in peacekeeping. As a \r\nresult, the clothes designed for the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission five years ago have grown too tight, if I \r\nmay use that figure of speech. For that reason we \r\nshould re-examine the parameters of our global \r\napproach to peacebuilding. \r\n On the operational front, the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission will gain efficacy by two principal \r\nmeasures: tightening the link between the \r\nOrganizational Committee and the country-specific \r\nconfigurations and improving the functioning of the \r\ncountry-specific configurations. The Organizational \r\nCommittee should thus continue to focus primarily on \r\nstrategic questions and on expanding partnerships \r\nwithin and outside the United Nations. On the matter \r\nof the country-specific configurations, it is important \r\nfor them to include a strong national component so as \r\nto increase ownership and permit a smooth transition \r\nfrom the United Nations mandate to the host country \r\ntaking charge of the primary sectors. The establishment \r\non the ground of country-specific configuration liaison \r\ncommittees will allow better interaction among \r\nmembers of the Commission, the host country and the \r\nPeacebuilding Support Office. \r\n The Peacebuilding Commission is struggling to \r\nfind its bearings within the United Nations peace and \r\nsecurity architecture. The links it has developed with \r\nthe principal organs of the United Nations — the \r\nGeneral Assembly, the Security Council and the \r\n A/65/PV.40\r\n \r\n19 10-61032 \r\n \r\nEconomic and Social Council — remain notably weak. \r\nWe must enhance the Commission’s interactions with \r\nthose bodies and clear the way for balanced \r\nrelationships, especially with the Security Council, \r\nwhich is charged by the Charter with matters that \r\nthreaten international peace and security. That requires \r\nintegrating a regional perspective in the work of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, notably through a strategic \r\ndialogue with the Community of West African States \r\nand the countries of the Mano River Union. \r\n The Peacebuilding Support Office plays a leading \r\nrole in the implementation of integrated peacebuilding \r\nstrategies. Given the diversification of the agenda of \r\nthe PBC and in order to maintain the quality of the \r\nwork of the Office, it is important to provide it with the \r\nnecessary human, financial and operational resources. \r\nIt is also important to increase the cooperation between \r\nthe Peacebuilding Support Office and the Office of \r\nRule of Law and Security Institutions of the \r\nDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations in order to \r\ndevelop strategic platforms in peacebuilding. \r\n It is well known that the prevention of conflicts \r\nand the development of United Nations capacities in \r\nthe fields of early warning, mediation and the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes could contribute to significantly \r\nreducing the horrors of conflicts. Peacebuilding, as an \r\ninstrument for change and resolving conflicts, has an \r\nimportant preventive dimension that we should take \r\nadvantage of. That goal can only be achieved if we \r\ntake full stock of the collective nature of this challenge \r\nand of the minimal cost of peacebuilding as compared \r\nto the cost of dealing with conflicts. \r\n A Chinese saying has it that the best is the enemy \r\nof the good. The Peacebuilding Commission is an \r\nexcellent instrument that could be improved but that \r\nplays an important role in the United Nations \r\npeacebuilding architecture. Collectively, it is up to us \r\nto improve its effectiveness, expand its interactions \r\nwith the other main United Nations organs and \r\ndiversify its partnerships. \r\n Mr. Kim Bonghyun (Republic of Korea): At the \r\noutset, I would like to express my delegation’s support \r\nfor the adoption of draft resolution A/65/L.7. I would \r\nalso like to take this opportunity to join other members \r\nin commending the work of the co-facilitators and their \r\nextensive and in-depth report (A/64/868, annex) on the \r\nreview of the United Nations peacebuilding \r\narchitecture. We take note of the many valuable \r\nobservations and recommendations it contains. \r\n As mentioned in the report, peacebuilding is a \r\ncomplicated process that takes time. However, this \r\nsimple truth should not hinder the concerted efforts \r\nthat are being made towards the realization of peace in \r\nthe aftermath of conflict. In that regard, I am glad to \r\nnote that the report clearly states that effective \r\npeacebuilding must not follow peacekeeping \r\noperations, but accompany them from their inception. \r\nThe task ahead will be to come up with an effective \r\norganizational approach that complements and further \r\nenhances the role of both peacekeeping and \r\npeacebuilding. In addition, my delegation shares the \r\nview that coordination and coherence among the \r\nvarious United Nations bodies and organizations, \r\nespecially with the Security Council, is a key element \r\nin effectively carrying out peacebuilding initiatives. \r\nPromoting more structured interaction with other \r\ninstitutions, such as the World Bank and regional \r\norganizations, is also of crucial importance. \r\n With regard to the Peacebuilding Support Office \r\n(PBSO), we underscore the call for the strengthening \r\nof the Office in order for it to adequately perform its \r\nmandated role. It is indeed unfortunate that there are \r\nonly 41 posts in the PBSO, of which about 70 per cent \r\nare either temporary, seconded or extrabudgetary posts \r\nor funded by the Peacebuilding Fund. \r\n As stressed in draft resolution A/65/L.7, my \r\ndelegation hopes that the relevant United Nations \r\nactors will take forward the appropriate \r\nrecommendations contained in the review report. The \r\ntask ahead is to streamline the various \r\nrecommendations with a realistic goal in mind. We \r\nhope that members will henceforth be able to engage in \r\nproductive discussions on priorities and, in turn, \r\nimplement the urgent recommendations in an \r\nexpeditious manner. To that end, the Republic of Korea \r\nwill strive to render its constructive support. \r\n Mr. Sefue (United Republic of Tanzania): I \r\nshould like to begin by expressing our gratitude to the \r\nPermanent Representatives of Ireland, Mexico and \r\nSouth Africa for facilitating this important review on \r\nbehalf of the entire membership of the United Nations. \r\nWe commend them for their hard work and for \r\nengaging and consulting with a wide range of \r\ninterlocutors, within and outside the United Nations \r\nsystem. The present report (A/64/868, annex) and its \r\nA/65/PV.40  \r\n \r\n10-61032 20 \r\n \r\nrecommendations have therefore benefited from the \r\nkind of comprehensive and inclusive approach we have \r\nalways called for. \r\n We would like also to extend our deepest \r\nappreciation to the President and to Uganda for their \r\nleadership and efforts in negotiating draft resolution \r\nA/65/L.7 with a view to its adoption by both the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council today. \r\n My delegation aligns itself with the statement \r\nread out by the representative of Bangladesh on behalf \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement. As co-chair with \r\nDenmark in facilitating the negotiation of the \r\nresolutions that established the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission (PBC) in 2006, I want to say how happy \r\nwe are to witness the adoption of the report (A/64/868, \r\nannex) on the review of the United Nations \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and architecture and \r\ntoday’s draft resolution by both the General Assembly \r\nand the Security Council. \r\n The Peacebuilding Commission is a relatively \r\nrecent addition to the United Nations family. Yet, it \r\nembodies the hopes of many and bears a unique \r\nlegitimacy and authority from both the General \r\nAssembly and the Security Council. This dual blessing \r\ngives the PBC a strong mandate, which we are all \r\nbeing called upon to support if it is to deliver \r\naccording to our expectations — especially those of the \r\npeople who count on us to help them build on and \r\nsustain their newly found peace. \r\n It is in that regard that my delegation welcomes \r\nthe report presented by the co-facilitators, entitled \r\n“Review of the United Nations peacebuilding \r\narchitecture”. As I said earlier, that report is based on \r\nextensive consultations within the United Nations \r\nmembership and with other stakeholders. Likewise, my \r\ndelegation welcomes the upcoming adoption of the \r\ndraft resolution by the General Assembly, which \r\nreaffirms the importance of the peacebuilding work \r\ncarried out by the United Nations and the role of the \r\nPBC in addressing the needs of countries emerging \r\nfrom conflict and nurturing them towards sustainable \r\nand irreversible peace. In adopting the draft resolution, \r\nwe will be making the necessary commitment towards \r\nthe implementation of the final recommendations of \r\nthe review process and reaffirming our readiness to \r\ndevelop the United Nations peacebuilding architecture \r\nwith the Peacebuilding Commission at its centre. \r\n My delegation recognizes the important role and \r\nthe central task of the Organizational Committee of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission in implementing the draft \r\nresolution and the recommendations of the review \r\nprocess. Looking forward, we would like to emphasize \r\nthe following three goals we envisage for them. \r\n The first goal is to prevent a relapse into conflict \r\nby working with the people in addressing the root or \r\nstructural causes of a previous conflict in a given \r\ncountry, in collaboration with other organs in the \r\nUnited Nations system and regional organizations. \r\n The second goal is to achieve national ownership \r\nof the peacebuilding process, which should be \r\nemphasized in the PBC at Headquarters in New York \r\nand in country configurations. National ownership \r\nshould include the participation of other national \r\nstakeholders, such as national parliamentarians and \r\nrelevant civil society organizations. Women and youth \r\nmust be part of that process. \r\n The third goal is to achieve a clear relationship \r\nbetween the Peacebuilding Fund and the PBC as a \r\nnon-operational entity. That could be achieved if the \r\ndecision-making procedures regarding disbursement, \r\ntargeting and implementing partners were clearly \r\ndefined to permit timely and effective funding \r\ninterventions. Flexibility should also be exercised in \r\nthe interpretation of the non-operational role of the \r\nPBC, as situations vary from one country to another \r\nand the PBC’s presence on the ground remains periodic \r\nand diffused. \r\n Tanzania welcomes a consensus adoption of \r\ntoday’s draft resolution and looks forward to the \r\nsuccessful implementation of the recommendations of \r\nthe review report. The United Nations cannot impose \r\nlasting peace on a people. It is the people themselves \r\nwho can ensure that the seeds of peace germinate, take \r\nroot, grow and thrive through an inclusive and \r\nparticipatory process that must involve women and \r\nyouth. Our duty is always to be there, lending a helping \r\nhand and nurturing a tree of peace that is suitable and \r\nspecific to each situation. For many years, the United \r\nNations developed the capacity and competence to put \r\nout the fires of conflict. Now we must develop the \r\ncapacity, the system-wide competence and the \r\nwherewithal to build peace and prevent the recurrence \r\nof conflict. As always, Tanzania stands ready to do its \r\npart and pledges its full support to the PBC in New \r\n A/65/PV.40\r\n \r\n21 10-61032 \r\n \r\nYork and at the country level in the process of \r\nimplementing the recommendations. \r\n Mr. Wang Min (China) (spoke in Chinese): The \r\nChinese delegation would like to thank the President \r\nfor convening today’s meeting. \r\n The establishment of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission (PBC) marked an important milestone in \r\nthe reform of the United Nations. The current five-year \r\nreview is clearly significant in taking stock of the \r\nPBC’s work, drawing on lessons learned and \r\nstrengthening the role of the Commission. We express \r\nour appreciation to the co-facilitators, namely, the \r\nPermanent Representatives of Ireland, Mexico and \r\nSouth Africa, for their fine work. We also wish to thank \r\nPresident Deiss and Ambassador Rugunda, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Uganda, who holds the rotating \r\npresidency of the Security Council for this month, for \r\ntheir efforts to facilitate reaching consensus on the \r\noutcome of the review among the parties concerned. \r\n Over the past five years, the PBC has achieved \r\nmuch in its work, but it still faces numerous \r\nchallenges. There is therefore still room for \r\nimprovement in its work. The report on the review \r\n(A/64/868, annex) made many useful recommendations \r\nthat merit thorough consideration by Member States \r\nand relevant agencies. Today, I would like to \r\nemphasize the following four points. \r\n First, the country in question is primarily \r\nresponsible for post-conflict peacebuilding in that \r\ncountry. All stakeholders should fully respect country \r\nownership. All assistance should therefore be focused \r\non capacity-building and providing the necessary \r\nresources and support. The international community \r\nand the United Nations, including the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, mainly have the task of providing \r\nrecommendations and assistance, rather than of \r\nsubstituting for the efforts of the country in question. \r\nIn developing national peacebuilding strategies, we \r\nshould fully take into account the views of the country \r\nin question and respect the priorities that it has \r\nidentified. \r\n Secondly, peacebuilding requires unanimity. The \r\nrelevant international agencies and regional \r\norganizations should take an integrated approach to \r\nenhancing coordination, synergy and efficiency. The \r\nPBC should work harder to set straight its relations \r\nwith other major United Nations agencies, while \r\nbringing into play its unique influence and promoting \r\nboth the separate roles of and coordination among the \r\nPBC, the World Bank and regional organizations in the \r\nareas of peacebuilding. \r\n Thirdly, the PBC should improve its working \r\nmethods and increase the efficiency of the \r\nOrganizational Committee and the meetings of \r\ncountry-specific configurations. We support the PBC in \r\nstrengthening its relations with the General Assembly, \r\nthe Security Council and the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil, in accordance with the mandates of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Council, and in making \r\nmore targeted recommendations on peacebuilding. \r\n Fourthly, it is necessary to find a prompt solution \r\nto the current difficulties in mobilizing financial \r\nresources for peacebuilding. While it is important to \r\ndevelop viable peacebuilding development strategies, \r\nthe crux should be to mobilize greater financial support \r\nfor post-conflict peacebuilding efforts by the countries \r\nin question. The PBC could play a greater coordinating \r\nrole by integrating bilateral and multilateral funding \r\nsources and facilitating the World Bank, the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund and other financial \r\ninstitutions making larger contributions. China calls on \r\nmore countries to contribute to the Peacebuilding \r\nFund, while also hoping that the Fund will continue to \r\nimprove its work and increase its supervision and, \r\nconsequently, its efficiency in resource utilization. \r\n China has always supported the United Nations in \r\nplaying a crucial role in peacebuilding and the work of \r\nthe PBC. We are confident that the current five-year \r\nreview on the work of the PBC will provide a new \r\nstarting point for improving the PBC’s work and \r\nenhancing its efficiency and role. \r\n Mr. Wolfe (Jamaica): Let me start by thanking \r\nthe co-facilitators for producing a very comprehensive \r\nand analytical report on the review of the United \r\nNations peacebuilding architecture (A/64/868, annex). \r\nTheir assessments and recommendations for the future \r\nenhancement of United Nations engagement in the area \r\nof peacebuilding are critical as we move forward. \r\n Allow me also to thank the President for \r\nconvening this debate within the General Assembly. \r\nIndeed, the Peacebuilding Commission (PBC) is a \r\ncreation of both the Security Council and the General \r\nAssembly. It is therefore fitting that the wider United \r\nNations membership is also able to provide an \r\nassessment of the report and of the functions of the \r\nA/65/PV.40  \r\n \r\n10-61032 22 \r\n \r\npeacebuilding architecture five years after its \r\nestablishment. \r\n As one of the original members of the PBC, \r\nJamaica is committed to a strengthened and enhanced \r\nPBC that is able to fulfil the vision and hopes vested in \r\nit five years ago by Member States and the five \r\ncountries currently on the PBC agenda. \r\n Jamaica associates itself with the statement \r\ndelivered earlier by the representative of Bangladesh \r\non behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement. As time does \r\nnot allow for a detailed presentation of our views, I \r\nwill limit my focus to three main areas: first, the role \r\nof the Organizational Committee; secondly, the place \r\nof the PBC within the Secretariat; and, thirdly, the \r\ndevelopment dimension of peacebuilding activities. \r\n First, allow me to make a brief comment on the \r\nissue of national ownership. Jamaica agrees that \r\nnational ownership of the peacebuilding process is the \r\nmain element for success in the area of peacebuilding. \r\nNational ownership begins with the respective \r\nGovernments being able to have significant input in \r\ndeveloping peacebuilding strategies, including in the \r\nrespective strategic framework documents. We cannot \r\ncontinue to pay lip service to that key principle in the \r\ncontext of peacebuilding or any other area of activity. \r\nNational ownership also necessitates that all segments \r\nof the community be allowed to shape the future of the \r\nrespective countries. \r\n While the report takes note of the important \r\ncontribution to be made by women and civil society \r\nand the shortcomings of the PBC in that area to date, \r\nwe would have liked to see more substantive \r\nrecommendations on involving all segments of society \r\nof the countries on the PBC agenda. \r\n We have taken due note of the recommendations \r\nof the co-facilitators in the area of capacity-building, \r\nwhich is an essential element of national ownership. At \r\nthe same time, however, more substantive \r\nrecommendations on measures to improve national \r\nownership of the peacebuilding process would have \r\nbeen important in entrenching this element in the \r\nCommission’s activities. \r\n Another key issue is that of an exit strategy for \r\nthe PBC with respect to the countries on its agenda. As \r\nwe have noted, that issue has been given substantive \r\ntreatment in the report. This is an area in which \r\nnational ownership is very critical. Countries on the \r\nPBC agenda must have a significant say in determining \r\nthe benchmarks for success on the path towards \r\nsustainable growth and development. \r\n The distance between New York and the countries \r\non the PBC’s agenda will always pose a problem and a \r\nchallenge. To that end, we see potential in establishing \r\na PBC-focused body at the local level. At the same \r\ntime, however, that should not serve as a substitute for \r\nfull engagement between the membership in New York \r\nand the Government representatives on the ground. We \r\nwould therefore encourage the increased use of modern \r\ntechnology, specifically video-conferencing, as a \r\nmeans of ensuring a constant level of engagement. At \r\nthe same time, however, there is no substitute for face-\r\nto-face engagement and interaction. We would \r\ntherefore encourage, to the extent possible, increased \r\nfield visits by the PBC to the countries on its agenda, \r\nwhich should be funded through the Peacebuilding \r\nSupport Office. \r\n Let me now make a few comments on the role of \r\nthe Organizational Committee. Jamaica shares the view \r\nthat the PBC Organizational Committee has been \r\nrelegated to a peripheral role. A strengthened and \r\nenhanced PBC requires a more proactive role for that \r\nbody. We also firmly believe that in its capacity as \r\ncommittee of the whole, the Organizational Committee \r\non the PBC should hold quarterly meetings with all \r\nchairs of the country-specific configurations and the \r\ngeneral membership to review benchmark targets, \r\nchallenges faced and the progress achieved on the \r\nground in all of the countries under consideration. That \r\nwill be useful especially for smaller delegations that \r\nare members of the PBC. We believe that such \r\nquarterly interactions by the committee of the whole \r\nare critical to ensuring that a comprehensive, real-time \r\nunderstanding and review of the work under way in the \r\ncountries on the PBC agenda is taking place. \r\n The recommendation to hold meetings of the \r\nOrganizational Committee on thematic issues is an \r\ninteresting dimension that merits further consideration. \r\nWe have also taken note of the co-facilitators’ decision \r\nnot to reopen discussions on membership. Dare I say, I \r\nfully understand the reasons. However, while we \r\nrespect that decision of the co-facilitators, as more \r\ncountries are placed on the Commission’s agenda — \r\nand I think this was mentioned in the statements of the \r\nrepresentatives of Morocco and Tanzania — the ability \r\nof the limited membership of 31 States is a question \r\nthat must be squarely confronted. From Jamaica’s \r\n A/65/PV.40\r\n \r\n23 10-61032 \r\n \r\nperspective, consideration must be given in particular \r\nto expanding the membership from the General \r\nAssembly category. For a majority of Member States, \r\nlike my own country, the General Assembly category is \r\nthe only means by which membership on the PBC is \r\ncurrently accessible. \r\n With respect to the place of the PBC within the \r\nSecretariat, there is general recognition among the \r\nmembership of the importance of the peacebuilding \r\nfunction to the overarching goals of international peace \r\nand security. Jamaica fully shares the views expressed \r\nin the report that the PBC and the Peacebuilding \r\nSupport Office must become a resource centre for \r\ngenerating knowledge and interest on a broad range of \r\nissues that impact peacebuilding activities. \r\n In order to generate the necessary buy-in and give \r\ngreater prominence to the Organization’s peacebuilding \r\nactivities in the field and among Member States, it \r\nmust begin to be streamlined throughout the entire \r\ngamut of United Nations activities. Peacebuilding \r\nactivities are not and cannot be undertaken in a \r\nvacuum, removed from other aspects of the \r\nOrganization’s work. Delivering as a whole is critical \r\nto generating real change on the ground. The only sure \r\nmeans to accomplish that is by ensuring that \r\npeacebuilding is viewed as a top priority. Political \r\nsupport and a record of achievements are critical \r\nfactors to achieving this end. \r\n The debate concerning the place of the PBC \r\nwithin the Organization is an important one. Has the \r\nPBC carved out a place for itself, or must it be \r\naccorded a level of prominence within the \r\nOrganization? For the PBC to achieve its goals, both \r\nmust take place simultaneously. In that regard, we fully \r\nagree with the need not only to strengthen the role of \r\nthe Organizational Committee and enable it to further \r\nenhance its relationships with all other relevant bodies \r\nincluding the Economic and Social Council, Security \r\nCouncil and General Assembly, but to strengthen as \r\nwell the capacities of the Peacebuilding Support Office \r\nto support its varied functions. \r\n Let me quickly move to the development \r\ndimension of peacebuilding activities. Since the \r\ninception of its membership of the PBC, Jamaica has \r\ncontinued to advocate for a greater focus on the \r\ndevelopment dimension of post-conflict peacebuilding. \r\nWe are therefore heartened to note the substantive \r\nfocus placed to this aspect in the report and we \r\ncommend the co-facilitators in that regard. It is a \r\ngenerally understood maxim that there is no peace \r\nwithout development and no development without \r\npeace. \r\n As the PBC moves forward to assist the five \r\ncountries currently on its agenda, and possibly future \r\ncountries, the development dimension must become \r\nmore central to peacebuilding activities on the ground \r\nfrom the outset of the PBC’s engagement. In order to \r\nensure that this is the case, peacebuilding funds must \r\nof necessity be more flexible. Moreover, the existing \r\ngap between the commitment of funds and \r\ndisbursement on the ground to ensure timely \r\nimplementation of quick-impact projects needs to be \r\nurgently addressed. In that regard, we believe that the \r\nPBC, through its Organizational Committee acting as \r\ninterlocutor between the donor community and the \r\nGovernments of the countries under consideration, can \r\nplay a very useful role. We agree with the conclusion \r\nthat there must be a balance between the concerns of \r\nthe donor community and the day-to-day needs on the \r\nground in post-conflict environments. This is perhaps \r\none of the potential areas of focus for the PBC. \r\n In conclusion, as with any review process, the \r\ntrue test will be realized in the implementation of the \r\nrecommendations, both on the ground and here in New \r\nYork. We cannot allow the five-year review to simply \r\nbe relegated to an academic exercise to simply satisfy a \r\nmandate contained in the founding resolutions. \r\n Finally, leadership from all will therefore be \r\ncritical. The Secretary-General and the PBC’s parent \r\nbodies, the Security Council, in particular its five \r\npermanent members, and the General Assembly must \r\ndemonstrate their commitment to peacebuilding \r\nactivities and the PBC and ensure that, to the extent \r\npossible, the recommendations are implemented. \r\n Mrs. Dunlop (Brazil): I would like to thank the \r\nPresident for convening this meeting and for the \r\nelaboration of the draft resolution that the Assembly \r\nwill adopt today (A/65/L.7). I would also like to thank \r\nthe co-facilitators of the Peacebuilding Commission \r\n(PBC) review process for the work they have \r\nundertaken. Their report (A/64/868, annex) is rich and \r\ncomprehensive, although more could have been said \r\nabout the work of the country-specific configurations. \r\nFor example, the document would have certainly \r\nbenefited from visits to the countries on the PBC’s \r\nagenda. As I said, however, it is a good report, for \r\nA/65/PV.40  \r\n \r\n10-61032 24 \r\n \r\nwhich we are grateful to the co-facilitators. The \r\ndocument presents valid and thoughtful recommendations, \r\nwhich we support in general. My delegation also \r\nsupports draft resolution A/65/L.7. \r\n We believe, however, that the process followed in \r\nthe consideration of the report and the negotiation of \r\nthe draft resolution could have allowed for an open \r\ndebate, especially in the Organizational Committee. We \r\nalso believe that an entity of the United Nations system \r\nunder review must be given the opportunity to give its \r\nviews to the decision-making bodies. It is our opinion \r\nthat, given the wide support enjoyed by the \r\nrecommendations, transparency and participation \r\nwould have caused neither undue delay nor major \r\ndisagreement among Member States. We hope and \r\nexpect that this will remain a regrettable exception. \r\nBrazil looks forward to an active and participatory \r\nconsideration of the implementation of the \r\nrecommendations by the respective organs. \r\n Mr. Sial (Pakistan): Pakistan aligns itself with \r\nthe statement delivered by the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Bangladesh on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement. Pakistan attaches great \r\nimportance to the review of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission (PBC). We value the work done by the \r\nco-facilitators. Their report (A/64/868, annex) is based \r\non oral and written statements contributed by Member \r\nStates. Pakistan remained engaged with the review \r\nprocess and also contributed a written proposal. \r\n In the five years since the 2005 World Summit, \r\nwhich established the PBC, the world has realized the \r\nimportance of peacebuilding efforts. The five-year \r\nreview of the PBC is a testimony to our collective \r\ncommitment to refine and improve peacebuilding \r\nstrategies based on important lessons learned, in a \r\nspirit of introspection. The report of the co-facilitators \r\nhas rightly underscored the complexities of \r\npeacebuilding. These complexities stem mainly from \r\nconstructing a consensus narrative on peacebuilding at \r\nthe global level. \r\n The concept of peacebuilding is relatively new \r\nand the international community is still creating \r\ntemplates for successful peacebuilding strategies. \r\nExpectations of quick dividends and the process of \r\nfinding the right balance between national ownership \r\nand donors’ agendas further augment the complexity. \r\nThe peacebuilding architecture can address these \r\ncomplexities by optimizing the interplay of various \r\nactors inside and outside the United Nations. \r\n The report has also analysed the relationship \r\nbetween the peacekeeping and peacebuilding fields and \r\nhow a dynamic mix can prevent relapse into conflict. \r\nThe report has rightly argued that peacebuilding and \r\npeacekeeping must accompany each other from the \r\ninception of a mission. This approach requires more \r\ncoordinated assessment and planning of peacebuilding \r\nand peacekeeping activities. Important milestones have \r\nalready been reached in synergizing the two fields. \r\nToday, 10 out of 16 peacekeeping missions have \r\npeacebuilding components. The Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, with the unique composition of its \r\nOrganizational Committee, is an ideal interface of \r\npeacekeeping and peacebuilding fields. In that context, \r\nI would like to underline the point that the equitable \r\nrepresentation that exists among membership \r\ncategories of the PBC must be preserved in the interest \r\nof closer coordination. \r\n Pakistan supports draft resolution A/65/L.7 on the \r\nreview of the peacebuilding architecture. We are happy \r\nto join the consensus on its adoption. \r\n Mr. Touray (Sierra Leone): I would first of all \r\nlike to express our appreciation to the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly for convening this important debate \r\non the review of the peacebuilding architecture. It is a \r\npleasure to make a statement on the review of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission (PBC) conducted in \r\naccordance with resolution 60/180, as set out in the \r\nannex to document A/64/868, which is based on \r\nextensive consultations with the United Nations \r\nmembership and other stakeholders. I would like to \r\nexpress our appreciation and thanks to the \r\nco-facilitators, namely, the Permanent Representatives \r\nof Ireland, Mexico and South Africa. \r\n We wholeheartedly align ourselves with the \r\nstatement made by the Permanent Representative of \r\nMalawi on behalf of the Group of African States. \r\n The path to sustainable peace following violent \r\nconflict is an immense challenge that requires the \r\ncollective and sustained effort of the international \r\ncommunity and local stakeholders. The creation of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission in 2005 during the sixtieth \r\nsession of the General Assembly is therefore not only \r\nvery relevant in coordinating and supporting \r\nprogrammes aimed at preventing a relapse into \r\n A/65/PV.40\r\n \r\n25 10-61032 \r\n \r\nconflict, but also a laudable initiative by the United \r\nNations. \r\n As stated in former Secretary-General Boutros \r\nBoutros-Ghali’s Agenda for Peace, issued in 1992, \r\npeacebuilding largely involves “action to identify and \r\nsupport structures which will tend to strengthen and \r\nsolidify peace in order to avoid a relapse into conflict” \r\n(A/47/277, para. 21). It therefore becomes imperative \r\nto achieve security and an end to hostilities, on the one \r\nhand, and, on the other, to engage in the parallel \r\nlonger-term process of consolidating peace — by \r\nreconciling people and groups and reforming or \r\nrebuilding institutions, structures and economies — to \r\ndiminish the possibility of a violent relapse. \r\n The establishment of the Peacebuilding Support \r\nOffice and the Peacebuilding Fund — as well as the \r\nselection of Sierra Leone and Burundi as the first two \r\ncountries, together with Guinea-Bissau and the Central \r\nAfrican Republic, and now our sister Republic of \r\nLiberia, on the peacebuilding agenda — has raised \r\nhigh expectations for peacebuilding. As highlighted in \r\ndraft resolution A/65/L.7, the peacebuilding work of \r\nthe United Nations requires sustained support and \r\nadequate resources to meet challenges. The \r\ncomprehensive review of the work of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission is very crucial in \r\ndetermining lapses and progress made and what is \r\nrequired to achieve its mandate. \r\n As noted in the Secretary-General’s report to the \r\nSecurity Council contained in document S/2010/471, a \r\ndelegation of the Peacebuilding Commission visited \r\nSierra Leone in March 2010. It recognized the progress \r\nmade since the end of the war and cited our experience \r\nas a successful example of multilateral peacebuilding. \r\nThe PBC delegation also reported that significant \r\nchallenges remained to be addressed before Sierra \r\nLeone could fully realize its long-term sustainable \r\ndevelopment aspirations. International support for \r\novercoming the remaining obstacles is therefore very \r\nvital, and more so as we get closer to the 2012 \r\nelections. \r\n On 28 September 2010, my delegation submitted \r\nto the PBC a joint progress report on the \r\nimplementation of the Sierra Leone Government’s \r\nAgenda for Change. The report, jointly prepared by the \r\nGovernment in full collaboration with its international \r\npartners and civil society, acknowledges the steady \r\nprogress made in the implementation of the Agenda for \r\nChange, but equally pointed out serious gaps and \r\nchallenges owing mainly to the lack of funding and the \r\nneed to address capacity constraints. Key among the \r\nmany outstanding issues that require immediate \r\nattention are youth unemployment, implementation of \r\nthe recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation \r\nCommission, drug trafficking and transnational \r\norganized crime, support to the electoral process and \r\nadvancing good governance reform. \r\n The Sierra Leone Government’s Agenda for \r\nChange second poverty-reduction strategy paper was \r\nprepared and adopted and is now being implemented \r\nthrough inclusive, broad-based and comprehensive \r\nconsultations and participation. It received \r\nendorsement by the Peacebuilding Commission in June \r\n2009. At that historic meeting, the Commission also \r\ncalled upon its member States and all development \r\npartners to accept the Agenda for Change as the core \r\nstrategy document for Sierra Leone. There is no doubt \r\nthat this implied the compelling need for the \r\ninternational community and development partners to \r\nsupport the implementation of the Agenda with \r\nsufficient resources. While my delegation continues to \r\nexpress its appreciation to the United Nations and our \r\ndevelopment partners for support to the \r\nimplementation of the Agenda for Change, it is \r\nregrettable that the Sierra Leone Multi-Donor Trust \r\nFund is yet to receive the level of support envisaged \r\nwhen it was launched. To date, only the Government of \r\nCanada has contributed to the Trust Fund. \r\n My delegation wholeheartedly agrees with and \r\nsupports the conclusions and recommendations of the \r\npeacebuilding review, including the draft resolution for \r\nits implementation. \r\n  The meeting rose at 12.45 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
