Corrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum. \r\n10-61179 (E) \r\n*1061179*   \r\nPresident: Mr. Deiss . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Switzerland) \r\n \r\n \r\n  In the absence of the President, Ms. Waffa-Ogoo \r\n(Gambia), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda items 13 and 115 (continued) \r\n \r\nIntegrated and coordinated implementation of and \r\nfollow-up to the outcomes of the major United \r\nNations conferences and summits in the economic, \r\nsocial and related fields \r\n \r\nFollow-up to the outcome of the Millennium Summit \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/65/L.7) \r\n \r\n The Acting President: In connection with draft \r\nresolution A/65/L.7, I now give the floor to the \r\nrepresentative of the Secretariat. \r\n Mr. Zhang: In connection with draft resolution \r\nA/65/L.7, entitled “Review of the United Nations \r\npeacebuilding architecture”, I wish to put on record the \r\nfollowing statement of financial implications on behalf \r\nof the Secretary-General in accordance with rule 153 of \r\nthe rules of procedure of the General Assembly. \r\n Under the terms of paragraphs 2 and 3 of the \r\ndraft resolution, the General Assembly would request \r\nall relevant United Nations actors to take forward, in \r\nline with their mandates and as appropriate, the \r\nrecommendations of the report presented by the \r\nco-facilitators (A/65/868, annex) with the aim of \r\nfurther improving the effectiveness of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission. \r\n Recognizing that the peacebuilding work of the \r\nUnited Nations requires sustained support and adequate \r\nresources to meet the challenges, it is anticipated that \r\nadditional staff resources would be required in the \r\nbiennium 2012-2013 to improve the effectiveness of \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission. Those resources would \r\nallow for providing capacities for communication and \r\noutreach and for undertaking the mapping of existing \r\npeacebuilding initiatives and resources in countries for \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission. Furthermore, they \r\nwould support the resource-mobilization functions of \r\nthe country-specific configurations, the implementation \r\nof the recommendations of the review report \r\nconcerning the development of an effective \r\ncommunications strategy for the work of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, as well as the undertaking \r\nof missions to engage and consult with actors such as \r\nthe European Union, the World Bank, the African \r\nDevelopment Bank, the African Union and relevant \r\nregional organizations for the purpose of building \r\npartnership for peacebuilding, including resource \r\nmobilization. \r\n Such requirements would be considered in the \r\ncontext of the finalization of the proposed programme \r\nbudgets for the biennium 2012-2013. Accordingly, the \r\nadoption of draft resolution A/65/L.7 would not entail \r\nany additional requirements under the programme \r\nbudgets for the biennium 2010-2011. \r\n The Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\ntake a decision on draft resolution A/65/L.7, entitled \r\n“Review of the United Nations peacebuilding \r\narchitecture”. \r\nA/65/PV.41  \r\n \r\n10-61179 2 \r\n \r\n May I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt \r\ndraft resolution A/65/L.7? \r\n  Draft resolution A/65/L.7 was adopted (resolution \r\n65/7) \r\n \r\n The Acting President: The General Assembly \r\nhas thus concluded this stage of its consideration of \r\nagenda items 13 and 115. \r\n \r\nAgenda item 73 (continued) \r\n \r\nReport of the International Criminal Court \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General (A/65/313) \r\n \r\n  Report by the Secretary-General (A/65/315) \r\n \r\n Mr. González Sarasa (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nMay I begin by expressing deep condolences on the \r\npart of the Cuban Government and people for the \r\ndeaths of the Prime Minister of Barbados, The \r\nHonourable David Thompson, and of the former \r\nPresident of Argentina, Néstor Kirchner. \r\n The establishment of an international criminal \r\njurisdiction that is impartial, non-selective, effective, \r\nfair, complementary to national justice systems, \r\ngenuinely independent, and therefore free of \r\nsubjugation to political interests that might erode its \r\nessence, continues to be an objective that Cuba \r\nsupports. \r\n The International Criminal Court has a \r\nconstitutive problem regarding the limitations on its \r\nindependence, given the way in which its relations with \r\nthe Security Council have been defined. Article 16 of \r\nthe Rome Statute gives the Council the power to \r\nsuspend investigations or trials undertaken by the \r\nCourt, a matter that was not settled with outcomes of \r\nthe Review Conference of the Rome Statute, held in \r\nKampala on 31 May to 11 June. \r\n The definition of the crime of aggression arrived \r\nat during the Conference fell short of Cuba’s \r\nexpectations. Thus, the opportunity was lost to \r\nestablish a generic definition covering forms of \r\naggression that also manifest themselves in \r\ninternational relations between States and are not \r\nlimited to the use of armed force but can have an \r\nimpact on the sovereignty, territorial integrity and \r\npolitical independence of States. \r\n For more than 50 years, Cuba has been subjected \r\nto such forms of aggression, resulting from the \r\naggressiveness and permanent hostility of its powerful \r\nnorthern neighbour, which have caused thousands of \r\ndeaths and injuries and incalculable material, economic \r\nand financial damage to the people of Cuba. Moreover, \r\nthe definition of the crime of aggression that was \r\nadopted in Kampala adds an ambiguous qualifier to the \r\nelements that the Court should consider in determining \r\nthe existence of such an act, in that it fails to describe \r\nclearly what is meant by the gravity and scale that \r\ncharacterize such crimes and render them clear \r\nviolations of the Charter of the United Nations. \r\n In Cuba’s opinion, the use of force by a State in a \r\nmanner incompatible with the Charter of the United \r\nNations is in itself a grave breach of the Charter. The \r\nintegrity of the Rome Statute as a complement to \r\nnational criminal jurisdictions must be protected. The \r\nCourt must remain impartial and fully independent of \r\nthe political entities of the United Nations, which must \r\nnot be allowed to affect its functioning. The \r\nresponsibilities of the Security Council under the \r\nCharter should not limit the Court’s role as a judicial \r\nbody. \r\n Cuba maintains a constructive position regarding \r\nthe establishment of an international criminal justice \r\nsystem that is genuinely impartial, effective, \r\nindependent and complementary to national \r\njurisdictions. In that regard, we have followed with \r\ninterest the Court’s evolution and developments within \r\nit. We have participated with interest as an observer in \r\nthe meetings of the Assembly of States Parties to the \r\nRome Statute. \r\n We would, however, like to express our concern \r\nabout a serious precedent that has been established in \r\nthe way in which the Court can initiate proceedings \r\nagainst nationals of States non-parties to the Rome \r\nStatute, where the jurisdiction of the Court has not \r\nbeen accepted in keeping with article 12 of the Statute. \r\nThe Cuban delegation reiterates that the legal principle \r\nwith respect to the consent of the State concerned must \r\nbe respected, since this is a treaty that is covered by \r\nArticle 11 of Part II of the Vienna Convention on the \r\nLaw of Treaties of 23 May 1969. \r\n A/65/PV.41\r\n \r\n3 10-61179 \r\n \r\n My delegation reaffirms its determination to \r\ncontribute to the implementation of international \r\ncriminal law so that it is fully effective and conforms \r\nwith international law, particularly the United Nations \r\nCharter. \r\n Mr. Osman (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): My \r\ndelegation has examined the report (see A/65/313) of \r\nthe International Criminal Court (ICC) before the \r\nGeneral Assembly, and particularly Chapter III \r\nregarding the Sudan, which includes information that \r\nlacks any objectivity or legal foundation. This has \r\nstrengthened our conviction more than ever before that \r\nour firm position vis-à-vis the Court is right and just \r\nand that we have been dragged into its proceedings, \r\nwhich are based on political deception disguised as \r\nlaw. Needless to say, such politicization of \r\ninternational justice runs completely counter to the \r\nobjectives for which the Court was established. The \r\nSudan was a full participant in all the preparatory \r\nmeetings that preceded the drafting of the Statute of \r\nthis Court, culminating in its adoption at the 1998 \r\nRome Conference. \r\n I should mention from this rostrum that since that \r\ndate, and before the Statute entered into force, the \r\nSudan has repeatedly and distinctly warned about the \r\nrisk of politicizing the Court and deflecting it from the \r\nobjectives for which it was established. Since that time, \r\nwe have also warned about the gravity of the \r\npossibility that certain States might take advantage of \r\nthe relationship between the Court and the Security \r\nCouncil, as addressed in article 13 (b) of the Statute, in \r\norder to transform the Court into a purely political tool \r\ndisguised as a legal entity. Now we see that the \r\nsituation that we warned of at the preparatory meetings \r\nbefore the drafting of the Statute has materialized and \r\nthat the facts confirm what we repeatedly warned of \r\nand explained when expressing our reservations. \r\n Africa, our mother continent, is now paying the \r\nprice for the ambiguity and the grey texts of the \r\nprovisions of the Rome Statute, which have been \r\nabused by certain circles that have used the Court as a \r\nmeans to serve their political interests, which can be \r\nseen in the targeting of African States and their leaders, \r\nas if the Court’s only jurisdiction were in Africa and in \r\nno other continent. That politicization of justice is \r\ncompletely unacceptable. That is what has led the \r\nAfrican Union to adopt its firm and principled position \r\nrejecting such a blatant politicization of justice, a \r\nposition endorsed by major regional organizations and \r\npolitical and geographical groups, representing more \r\nthan two thirds of the total membership of the United \r\nNations: the African Union, the League of Arab States, \r\nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference, the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement and the Community of Sahel-\r\nSaharan States. \r\n From this rostrum, I salute all the member States \r\nof those organizations. In spite of being parties to the \r\nRome Statute, they have not hesitated to declare their \r\nfirm rejection of the Court’s transformation from a \r\njudicial body into a tool for political intrigue and \r\nextortion, which cannot be further from the main \r\nobjectives for which the Court was established. What \r\nkind of justice ignores hundreds of thousands of \r\ncivilians outside of Africa who have been killed \r\ncollectively by means of the latest and most destructive \r\ntools of war and death? Why does it only see what \r\nhappens in Africa? Where are the preconditions to the \r\nexercise of jurisdiction under article 12 of the Rome \r\nStatute? \r\n With regard to the competence of the Security \r\nCouncil, we have already drawn attention to that \r\nsituation based on the fact that the Council is a \r\npolitical body that Member States of the Organization \r\nhave been attempting for over two decades to reform \r\nand have not been able to do so. It was obvious to us \r\nthat article 13 (b) of the Rome Statute would be abused \r\nwith regard to certain cases that are before the Security \r\nCouncil and would be referred to the Court under \r\nChapter VII of the Charter. It was not strange, then, \r\nthat resolution 1593 (2005), regarding the situation in \r\nDarfur would be adopted in a flawed manner and in \r\ncontradiction of basic justice and equality, both of \r\nwhich prohibit exceptions or selectivity. \r\n We could speak for a very long time if we started \r\nto dissect all the claims that have been made against \r\nthe Sudan, its leadership, its people and its sovereignty. \r\nThe professional conduct of people of law and \r\njurisprudence is based on integrity and impartiality. \r\nThey do not engage in political or media campaigns in \r\norder to become stars or to prove themselves. Justice is \r\nmuch larger and more sublime than limited personal \r\ngains. What we have seen in the prosecution statements \r\ncould not be further from the provisions of article 15 of \r\nthe Rome Statute. \r\n The Assembly is well aware that during the \r\npreparatory consultations on the Rome Statute, many \r\ncountries expressed reservations over the unlimited \r\nA/65/PV.41  \r\n \r\n10-61179 4 \r\n \r\nauthority of the Prosecutor, and they were right to do, \r\nsince mixing politics with the law would ruin both and \r\ntransform them into a complete distortion that annuls \r\nthe basic tenet of legal jurisprudence, namely, that \r\npeace is the highest form of justice. The moves made \r\nby the Prosecutor with regard to the Darfur issue are a \r\nclear example of the politicization of his position. The \r\nProsecutor has become a real obstacle to the political \r\nprocess aimed at achieving comprehensive and \r\nsustainable peace in Darfur. Every time negotiations \r\nget closer to conciliation and the signing of an \r\nagreement, the Prosecutor comes up with another case \r\nor a new fabricated accusation that sends the wrong \r\nmessage to the armed rebel movements, taking back \r\nthe political process to square one. \r\n In that context, the most recent decision by the \r\nCourt to add the crime of genocide to the list of \r\nallegations against the leadership of the country and \r\nthe symbol of its sovereignty took place during the \r\npreparation for the presidential elections in my country \r\nand at a time when negotiations in Doha, under the \r\nsponsorship of the brotherly country of Qatar and with \r\nthe participation of the United Nations-African Union \r\nMediator, Mr. Djibril Bassoulé, were close to reaching \r\nan agreement. It was then that the Prosecutor came up \r\nwith a fabricated new accusation, namely, the crime of \r\ngenocide, an accusation made against His Excellency \r\nthe President of the Republic of the Sudan. \r\n Let me ask the Assembly: is it conceivable that a \r\nPresident of a State who is alleged to have committed \r\nthe crime of genocide against certain tribes in his \r\ncountry would, at the same time, have five Ministers in \r\nhis Government from those tribes, including the \r\nMinister for Justice? How could that be when \r\nthousands of members of those tribes live in the heart \r\nof the capital, Khartoum? Scores of members of those \r\ntribes are also members of the federal Parliament, and \r\nthe state parliaments as well. Would this not give an \r\nindication that the accusation is false and has \r\nabsolutely no basis in truth? \r\n The irony and the extreme excesses of the \r\nProsecutor reached their limit with his description of \r\nthe elections in the Sudan as similar to Nazi elections. \r\nWhere is the law and the objectivity in this purely \r\npolitical description? Is this evidence of professional \r\nconduct? \r\n We were not at all surprised with the new \r\ntendency of the Court to contradict the well-established \r\nand most basic tenets of international law, particularly \r\nwith regard to the immunity of heads of State and \r\nGovernment, which have been adopted by the \r\nInternational Court of Justice with regard to all \r\nprovisions relating to high officials of that kind. How \r\nclear, then is the difference between one Court and the \r\nother. \r\n It is also ironic that the Assembly considered \r\nyesterday morning the report of the International Court \r\nof Justice (A/65/4) and reaffirmed that that Court, in all \r\nof its decisions and advisory opinions, was completely \r\ncommitted to the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nparticularly with regard to respect for the sovereignty \r\nof States and their territorial integrity. Where does the \r\nInternational Criminal Court stand with respect to \r\nthose values and principles of justice? \r\n In the light of the position taken by the heads of \r\nState of African and Arab countries, the heads of State \r\nof the countries of the Non-Aligned Movement, \r\nmeeting at Sharm el-Sheikh in brotherly Egypt in 2008, \r\nrejected the Court’s proceedings and decisions with \r\nregard to the Sudan. We would like to commend the \r\nstrong position taken by the Afro-Arab summit held in \r\nSirte, Libya, in September 2010; that meeting also \r\nrejected the decisions of the Court. \r\n In conclusion, the delegation of the Sudan, while \r\nparticipating in these deliberations on the report of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court, would like to express its \r\ndeeply held belief that peace-loving countries and \r\ncountries that are guided by the values of justice, \r\nfreedom and equality cannot accept the politicization \r\nof the Court nor its deviation from the objective for \r\nwhich it was established. We are firmly confident that \r\nall States Members of the United Nations, including \r\nStates parties to the Rome Statute, are fully aware of \r\nthe just position of the Sudan, in which it totally \r\nrefuses to deal with the Court in any way, since that \r\nbody has deviated from the path of law and justice, \r\nbefore which all are equal and are treated without \r\nselectivity or discrimination. We believe that people \r\nare aware of and feel the hegemony of certain \r\ninfluential States over the Court, which has led the \r\ntargeting of African leaders in a way that recalls the \r\nformer abominable colonial era. \r\n We wish to reaffirm that we will continue our \r\ndiligent efforts to reach a timely, comprehensive, \r\npolitical and sustainable settlement of the conflict in \r\nDarfur regardless of the Court’s actions and its \r\n A/65/PV.41\r\n \r\n5 10-61179 \r\n \r\ndestructive role. At the same time, we will make every \r\neffort to hold accountable anyone who has perpetrated \r\ncrimes or violations during the conflict in Darfur. \r\nJustice will be served in all cases. \r\n In that regard, I would like to refer to the \r\nstatement made by the President of the Court that it \r\nwas not the Court’s objective to replace national legal \r\nsystems. I would respond to that by saying that the \r\nInternational Criminal Court, in its present form and its \r\nlegal basis, which is completely flawed, cannot replace \r\nthe Sudanese legal system, now or ever. \r\n The Sudanese judiciary has had a brilliant record \r\nand a strong legacy of integrity, credibility and \r\nprofessionalism. That legacy goes beyond the Sudan to \r\nmany other African, Arab and Asian countries. Many \r\nlegal figures of the Sudan have worked and still work \r\nin those countries, using their legal expertise and \r\nprofessionalism and an integrity and credibility \r\ntestified to by all. They are in a much better position to \r\nbring about justice in the Sudan, and no one else can \r\ndo that. \r\n Ms. Blum (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nwould like to begin my statement by expressing my \r\ncondolences and those of the Colombian Government \r\non the death of The Honourable David Thompson, \r\nPrime Minister of Barbados, and of former President of \r\nArgentina Néstor Kirchner. \r\n My delegation thanks the President of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court for submitting to the \r\nGeneral Assembly the Court’s sixth report, covering \r\nthe period 1 August 2009 to 31 July 2010 (see \r\nA/65/313). \r\n In taking note of the report, the delegation of \r\nColombia wishes to highlight the contribution of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court to the continuing \r\ndevelopment and strengthening of international \r\ncriminal law. We also welcome the Court’s own \r\nstrengthening as an independent institution in fulfilling \r\nits mandate to investigate and prosecute crimes under \r\nits jurisdiction. \r\n Among the elements highlighted in the report \r\nsubmitted by the Court, we underscore the efforts to \r\nsupport national jurisdictions in their primary \r\nresponsibility to investigate and prosecute alleged \r\nperpetrators of the most serious crimes of concern to \r\nthe international community, as well as the Court’s \r\nefforts to develop the complementary aspects of its \r\njurisdiction. \r\n In addition, I would like to mention some aspects \r\nconsidered during the Review Conference of the Rome \r\nStatute, held in Kampala from 31 May to 11 June. \r\nAmong the achievements of the Conference, we \r\nhighlight the adoption of the Kampala Declaration, in \r\nwhich States reaffirmed their commitment to observe \r\nthe duties and responsibilities agreed to under the \r\nRome Statute, as well as to guarantee its full \r\napplication, universality and integrity. \r\n We also highlight the 102 pledges of support to \r\nthe International Court made by 37 States, the thematic \r\nreviews undertaken to take stock of international \r\ncriminal justice and various resolutions on some of \r\nthose issues, progress in the review of the Statute in \r\nconnection with the crime of aggression, the resolution \r\non the amendment that seeks to include the use of \r\ncertain weapons as war crimes under the Court’s \r\njurisdiction, the resolve to keep in force the existing \r\narticle 124 in its current form and the provisions \r\nadopted on the execution of sentences. \r\n Colombia had made significant progress in \r\nharmonizing its domestic legislation with the principles \r\nand rules of the Rome Statute. In that regard, it should \r\nbe noted that in April 2009 my country acceded to the \r\nAgreement on the Privileges and Immunities of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. Similarly, as stated in the \r\nCourt’s report, it is worth mentioning that on \r\n1 November 2009 the seven-year transition period that \r\nthe Colombian State had set with regard to the entry \r\ninto force of the Rome Statute with regard to the \r\nCourt’s competence to recognize certain acts as crimes \r\nof war came to an end. \r\n The Government of Colombia believes that the \r\nwork of the Court is decisive in preventing and \r\ncombating impunity and in encouraging States to \r\ndetermine that national judicial bodies should carry out \r\ninvestigations and trials of alleged perpetrators of \r\nserious crimes, bearing in mind the complementarity of \r\nthe Court’s jurisdiction. In that regard, it is important \r\nto highlight that the report of the International \r\nCriminal Court acknowledges that Colombia’s national \r\ncriminal justice system has made efforts to deal with \r\npersons responsible for conduct proscribed by the \r\nRome Statute in various broad categories. \r\n In that regard, it should be pointed out that \r\nColombia has achieved greater efficiency and \r\nA/65/PV.41  \r\n \r\n10-61179 6 \r\n \r\neffectiveness in its system of justice by strengthening \r\nits criminal prosecution service. The Office of the \r\nAttorney General has been modernized and continues \r\nto strengthen its investigative capacity. The criminal \r\njustice system has the competence to be seized of \r\nalleged human rights violations committed by members \r\nof the security forces. \r\n In general, through a policy aimed at \r\nstrengthening democratic security, Colombia has \r\nreaffirmed its commitment to respect for human rights \r\nand the rule of law as an integral part of State policies. \r\nThe national Government continues to apply, with the \r\nutmost strictness, the mechanisms available to it to \r\nrespond in an exemplary manner and to bring to justice \r\ncomplaints made to it on all violations involving State \r\nofficials, including the security forces. In developing a \r\nproject within the Office of the Attorney General to \r\nanalyse cases of violations of human rights and \r\nbreaches of international humanitarian law, 301 cases \r\nof possible arbitrary killings have been studied. Several \r\ncourts have issued convictions against perpetrators, and \r\nthey have been upheld. \r\n Moreover, support has been provided to the \r\nhuman rights unit of the Office of the Attorney \r\nGeneral, supplying the logistics and security \r\nguarantees needed to form 1,973 commissions to \r\ninvestigate cases of the killing of protected persons. In \r\nour penal code, that sort of killing is defined as a crime \r\nagainst persons protected by international humanitarian \r\nlaw, whether by illegal armed groups or by other \r\nactors. That support has helped to bring about trials \r\nand, by May of this year, 50 convictions had been \r\nhanded down. \r\n It is also worth highlighting the national efforts to \r\nensure the implementation of the principles of justice, \r\ntruth and full reparation with regard to victims of \r\nviolence perpetrated by illegal armed groups. The State \r\nof Colombia has developed an operational system of \r\nreparations for victims through an administrative \r\nprocedure. A total of 121 defence lawyers have been \r\nemployed to represent victims. Through that \r\nprogramme, trial representation has been provided to \r\n111,118 victims in the past two years. \r\n In addition, the Government of President Juan \r\nManuel Santos has presented Congress with a new bill \r\non reparations to victims, including the restitution of \r\nland to those who were dispossessed during the \r\nviolence. This shows that our State is giving the utmost \r\nnational priority to combating impunity. To that end, \r\nall branches of the Government continue to work to \r\nstrengthen access to and the administration of justice. \r\n The United Nations is called on to promote the \r\nuniversality of the Rome Statute. It is important that \r\nthe States that have not yet ratified this instrument \r\nconsider doing so promptly. Full and effective \r\ncollaboration among States, multilateral organizations \r\nand the International Criminal Court is essential for the \r\nCourt to achieve its objectives. We therefore reiterate \r\nour call on States represented here and to the United \r\nNations to continue to support the Court in order to \r\nensure that it can become established as a decisive \r\ninternational entity in combating the most serious \r\ncrimes and ensuring that such crimes do not go \r\nunpunished. \r\n Mrs. Smith (Norway): Let me start by expressing \r\nNorway’s continuing support and full recognition of \r\nthe work of the International Criminal Court (ICC) \r\nduring the past year. Norway welcomes the sixth \r\nannual report of the ICC (see A/65/313) and would like \r\nto thank the President of the Court, Judge Song, for his \r\ndetailed and informative report and presentation here \r\nyesterday. \r\n I would like to focus on three issues that are \r\nsignificant for the Court’s work. These are, first, the \r\ncooperation of States parties and other States with the \r\nCourt; secondly, the universality of the Rome Statute; \r\nand thirdly, the Review Conference held in Kampala in \r\nJune this year. \r\n First, Norway welcomes the arrest of Callixte \r\nMbarushimana by French authorities earlier this \r\nmonth. Over the past few years, Norway has increased \r\nits efforts to strengthen the protection of civilians, \r\nespecially women and children, from the atrocities of \r\nwar. We have had a particular focus on the widespread \r\nsexual violence that has been perpetrated during the \r\nconflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. \r\nSexual violence constitutes one of the most serious \r\ninternational crimes. The arrest of Mr. Mbarushimana \r\nwas a crucial step in efforts to prosecute the alleged \r\nperpetrators of the sexual crimes committed in the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. \r\n However, eight ICC arrest warrants remain \r\noutstanding. They pertain to the situations in Darfur, \r\nUganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. \r\nThis is a matter of grave concern to Norway, and \r\nbrings me to the issue of State cooperation. \r\n A/65/PV.41\r\n \r\n7 10-61179 \r\n \r\n The ICC depends on the cooperation of the States \r\nparties. The recent arrest was a joint effort by many \r\nparties, including France, the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo, Rwanda and Germany. It is an excellent \r\nexample of successful cooperation among States. All \r\nStates parties must do their utmost to provide the ICC \r\nwith the best possible working conditions. Norway \r\nexpects States with legal obligations under the Statute, \r\nor that have entered into cooperation agreements with \r\nthe ICC, to fulfil their obligations and to demonstrate \r\ntheir commitment to justice in practice. \r\n We therefore urge all States parties concerned to \r\nfulfil their responsibility to make the outstanding arrest \r\nwarrants effective. In the Darfur situation, we call on \r\nall States, including the Sudanese authorities, to \r\ncooperate fully with the Court and to comply with their \r\nlegal obligations under Security Council resolution \r\n1593 (2005). We would in this connection also \r\nencourage the Security Council to consider measures \r\nthat would ensure compliance with this resolution. \r\n Turning briefly to the issue of universality, we are \r\npleased to note that, with the entry into force of the \r\nRome Statute for the Republic of Moldova on \r\n1 January 2011, there will be 114 States parties to the \r\nStatute. The number of States parties is rising every \r\nyear. It is remarkable that so many States from all parts \r\nof the world have ratified the Statute in such a short \r\ntime. Norway strongly hopes that the ICC will enjoy \r\nuniversal adherence in the future. We believe that the \r\nlong-term interests of all nations, irrespective of their \r\nsize, region or political orientation, are best served by \r\nstrengthening the rule of law and promoting justice. \r\n We would like to thank the Government of \r\nUganda and all other contributors for a successful \r\nReview Conference. In his opening statement in \r\nKampala, the Norwegian Foreign Minister said that we \r\nshould not only review the Rome Statute but also \r\ncelebrate the ICC and the political, diplomatic and \r\nlegal work it took to create it. The Conference showed \r\nus that there is still a strong political and diplomatic \r\ncommitment to furthering the legal work to strengthen \r\ninternational criminal justice. In addition to reviewing \r\narticles 8 and 124, the Conference amended the Rome \r\nStatute to include a definition of the crime of \r\naggression and the conditions under which the Court \r\ncould exercise jurisdiction over that crime. \r\n We were also pleased to see that the Norwegian \r\nproposal on enforcement of sentences materialized in a \r\nresolution that calls upon States to accept in their \r\nprison facilities persons sentenced by the ICC. The \r\nresolution also confirmed that a sentence of \r\nimprisonment can be served in prison facilities made \r\navailable by an international or regional organization, \r\nmechanism or agency. Further, we also welcome the \r\nresolutions on the stocktaking of international criminal \r\njustice and the Kampala Declaration. In the \r\nDeclaration, States parties reaffirmed their \r\ncommitment to the Rome Statute and its full \r\nimplementation, as well as to its universality and \r\nintegrity. \r\n On that note, I would like to reiterate Norway’s \r\nfirm and long-standing commitment to the Rome \r\nStatute and to an effective and credible International \r\nCriminal Court. We believe that the ICC should enjoy \r\nthe broadest possible support of all States. We all share \r\nthe universal values attached to the protection of \r\nhuman dignity. This protection is enhanced by taking \r\nconcerted action to suppress the most serious crimes \r\naffecting the international community. \r\n Mr. Ulibarri (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nAllow me to begin by expressing the condolences of \r\nmy delegation, Government and people to the people \r\nand Government of Barbados on the death of Prime \r\nMinister David Thompson. Our condolences go \r\nlikewise to the people and Government of Argentina on \r\nthe death of former President Néstor Kirchner. \r\n Costa Rica thanks the President of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court and welcomes the detailed \r\nreport (see A/65/313) that he has submitted to the \r\nGeneral Assembly. We also express our \r\nacknowledgement of the work carried out by the staff \r\nof the Court over the past year. \r\n Since the establishment of the Court, Costa Rica \r\nhas fully supported its work. In addition to our support \r\nfor its tasks, we have repeatedly called for the \r\nuniversal ratification of and full compliance with its \r\nStatute. As in previous years, we appeal for the \r\ncooperation of States and United Nations bodies, in \r\nparticular the Security Council, with the Court. Support \r\nfor the Court is, in effect, support for the victims of the \r\nworst crimes against humanity, which must not go \r\nunpunished. \r\n We welcome Bangladesh, Seychelles, Saint Lucia \r\nand the Republic of Moldova as new States parties to \r\nthe Rome Statute. With these new parties, there are \r\nA/65/PV.41  \r\n \r\n10-61179 8 \r\n \r\nnow 114 States, including my country, that recognize \r\nthe jurisdiction of the Court. \r\n The International Criminal Court represents a \r\nmajor step forward in strengthening human rights and \r\ninternational law as a whole. However, we must \r\ncontinue to work on consolidating it as a key judicial \r\ntool in combating impunity and ensuring accountability \r\nin the international system. Our ultimate objective \r\nshould be to build an international community on the \r\nsolid foundations of justice. \r\n Costa Rica believes that justice is a cornerstone \r\nof the quest for comprehensive, lasting peace. We see \r\npeace and justice as natural allies that complement \r\neach other. One need not be sacrificed for the other. On \r\nthe contrary, peace and justice, together with \r\ninternational security and stability, can be achieved \r\nonly if they are pursued together. \r\n The Review Conference of the Rome Statute in \r\nKampala in June was a fine opportunity for States to \r\nreaffirm our commitment to the Rome Statute and its \r\nongoing relevance, full implementation, universality \r\nand integrity. My country reiterates its resolve to \r\ncomply fully with the commitments made at the \r\nConference. \r\n Costa Rica welcomes the amendment made by \r\nStates to paragraph 2 (e) of article 8 of the Statute to \r\ninclude within the Court’s jurisdiction various war \r\ncrimes when committed in armed conflicts not of an \r\ninternational character. We also commend the inclusion \r\nof a definition of the crime of aggression and the \r\nconditions under which the Court could exercise \r\njurisdiction with respect to that crime. We hope that, \r\nwhen that amendment comes up for adoption in 2017, \r\nStates will demonstrate their genuine commitment to \r\nthe Court and adopt the amendment without serious \r\ndelays. \r\n The cooperation of States is essential to the work \r\nof the International Criminal Court. Its effective \r\njurisdiction depends to a large extent on States’ \r\nfulfilling their obligations to cooperate with it, help in \r\nthe execution of its decisions and bolster its \r\nindependence. Among those obligations is, of course, \r\nthe execution of its arrest warrants. We are therefore \r\nconcerned that the report states that nine arrest \r\nwarrants have not yet been executed, which is rightly \r\nseen as the most pressing challenge now facing the \r\nCourt. \r\n Another task that cannot be delayed is for States \r\nto enact enabling legislation or other appropriate \r\nprocedures in keeping with international law that will \r\ncontribute to improving understanding of the Court’s \r\nwork at the international level, as provided for in the \r\nDeclaration on cooperation adopted by States members \r\nof the ICC in Kampala. \r\n It is also essential to ensure the cooperation and \r\ncommitment of the Security Council. The Court’s \r\nability to focus on its judicial functions and fulfil its \r\nwork, free of political pressure from any State, greatly \r\ndepends on the Council’s support and its insistence on \r\ncompliance with obligations to the Court arising from \r\nits decision. \r\n In this connection, we reaffirm our great concern \r\nthat the report reflects yet again the Government of the \r\nSudan’s failure to comply with its international \r\ncommitments. We emphasize that the Sudan’s \r\nresponsibility to comply with the arrest warrants issued \r\nby the Court derives not from the Rome Statute but \r\nfrom the resolutions of the Security Council and the \r\nvery Charter of the United Nations. Therefore, its \r\nfailure to cooperate represents a breach of international \r\nobligations voluntarily entered into by the Sudan as a \r\nState Member of the Organization. \r\n Lastly, we reiterate our commitment to \r\ncontinuing to cooperate constructively with the Court \r\nin its work. \r\n Mr. Stuerchler Gonzenbach (Switzerland) \r\n(spoke in French): My delegation would like first to \r\nexpress our sincere condolences to Barbados and \r\nArgentina. \r\n My delegation thanks President Sang-Hyun Song \r\nfor his introduction of the sixth annual report of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) (see A/65/313). We \r\nalso express our gratitude to all of the Court’s staff \r\nmembers for their daily efforts in carrying out their \r\ndifficult work. \r\n The year 2010 marks a turning point for the \r\nInternational Criminal Court and for world justice. \r\nTwelve years after the signing of the Rome Statute and \r\neight years after its coming into force, the States \r\nparties, meeting at the Review Conference of the Rome \r\nStatute in Kampala, adopted a definition of the crime \r\nof aggression and agreed on the conditions for the \r\nexercise of jurisdiction with regard to that crime. \r\nSwitzerland welcomes the fact that States have found a \r\n A/65/PV.41\r\n \r\n9 10-61179 \r\n \r\ncommon solution by consensus, in full accord with the \r\nStatute and the United Nations Charter. That historic \r\nevent was the result of intensive negotiations and a \r\nspirit of compromise. \r\n According to the compromise, States parties are \r\nprotected after ratification in accordance with \r\nparagraph 5 of article 121. The jurisdictional regime \r\nprovided for in article 12 remains intact, with two \r\nexceptions. States not party are excluded from the \r\njurisdiction of the Court in all circumstances, while \r\nevery State party may lodge an opt-out declaration if it \r\nwishes to be excluded. That delicate compromise \r\nshows that the States parties all seek an effective \r\nInternational Criminal Court capable of fulfilling its \r\nmandate. \r\n Sixty-five years after the crimes against peace \r\ntried by the International Military Tribunal at \r\nNuremberg and the International Military Tribunal for \r\nthe Far East in Tokyo, the crime of aggression has been \r\ngiven an international definition and integrated \r\npermanently into the jurisdiction of the ICC. That helps \r\nto strengthen the protection afforded by international \r\ncriminal law in the form of ius contra bellum, which is \r\nfirmly anchored in the United Nations Charter. My \r\ndelegation calls on all States parties to the Rome \r\nStatute to ratify the amendment concerning the crime \r\nof aggression, which will activate the jurisdictional \r\nsystem as of 2017. \r\n Progress on the crime of aggression is not the \r\nonly success in Kampala that my delegation would like \r\nto mention. The amendment on the utilization of three \r\nkinds of weapons in non-international conflicts is \r\nequally important. It strengthens the protection of \r\ninternational humanitarian law and reduces the gap \r\nbetween the Statute’s treatment of crimes in \r\ninternational conflicts, on the one hand, and those in \r\nnon-international conflicts, on the other. \r\n The convening of the Review Conference in \r\nKampala, Uganda — a country that has chosen to refer \r\nits situation to the Court — was highly symbolic. It \r\nshowed once again that the Court responds above all to \r\nthe needs of those States in which the most serious \r\ncrimes have been committed. It was also edifying to \r\nmeet the victims and to come to a better understanding \r\nof their needs and wants. Their desire to resume their \r\nlives with dignity filled us with a feeling of great \r\nhumility. \r\n The role of the Court is a complementary one. \r\nThe main responsibility for bringing the perpetrators of \r\ninternational crimes to justice remains in the hands of \r\nnational jurisdictions. The Rome Statute prompted the \r\nmodification of many of those national legal systems. \r\nAmnesty is no longer an option for the most serious \r\ncrimes within the jurisdiction of the Court. The Court \r\nhas shown that it can intervene when so required by its \r\ncomplementary role. The first trials have already \r\nbegun. \r\n The Court has had a major influence on the \r\nresponse to international crimes. The Rome Statute and \r\nthe Court have the potential to effect a fundamental \r\nand lasting change in the international legal system. \r\nHowever, the ICC will be able to realize this potential \r\nonly if it can count on the unshakeable support of the \r\nStates parties in the execution of arrest warrants. Nine \r\narrest warrants are currently awaiting execution. \r\n Unless all States give the Court their support, it \r\nwill lose credibility and be unable to fight effectively \r\nagainst impunity, pursuant to its vocation and the \r\nunanimous desire of all the countries that ratified the \r\nStatute. This was recognized during the Review \r\nConference of the Rome Statute. The declaration on \r\ncooperation emphasizes that all States are obligated to \r\ncooperate with the Court, whether under the Statute or \r\nunder relevant Security Council resolutions. Moreover, \r\nit singles out the crucial role of the execution of arrest \r\nwarrants in ensuring the effectiveness of the Court. \r\n The Court is today the main catalyst in advancing \r\nthe cause of international criminal justice. My \r\ndelegation is confident that its successes will induce \r\nthose States that have not yet ratified the Rome Statute \r\nto do so. The system will be fully operational only \r\nwhen we have achieved the universal participation of \r\nStates respecting their obligations. Such is the wish of \r\nmy delegation, which has at all times insisted on the \r\nneed for a Court that is effective, independent and \r\nuniversal. \r\n Mr. Shawabkah (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nAllow me at the outset to welcome the President of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC), Judge Sang-Hyun \r\nSong, and to thank him for introducing the sixth annual \r\nreport of the ICC to the United Nations (see A/65/313), \r\nwhich was submitted pursuant to the Relationship \r\nAgreement between the United Nations and the Court. \r\nThe report provides an overview of the main \r\nA/65/PV.41  \r\n \r\n10-61179 10 \r\n \r\ndevelopments in ICC activities between 1 August 2009 \r\nand 31 July 2010. \r\n Jordan welcomes the cooperation that the United \r\nNations has offered to the ICC and affirms the need \r\nand importance of States’ cooperation with the ICC in \r\norder to achieve its objectives and purposes. From this \r\nrostrum, Jordan calls on all States and international and \r\nregional organizations to fully cooperate with the Court \r\nand to assist it in all aspects, be it by collecting \r\nevidence, offering logistical support for field missions, \r\ntransporting witnesses, apprehending and handing over \r\nindividuals or executing sentences handed down by the \r\nCourt in order to end impunity for the most serious \r\ncrimes. \r\n International cooperation is very important to \r\nimproving the operations of the ICC, be it in terms of \r\ncoordination or of information exchange. Jordan \r\nreaffirms its continued support for the ICC and its \r\nbelief in the principles for which it was created. The \r\nICC is a main pillar in bolstering international justice, \r\nmaintaining international peace and security and \r\nensuring the supremacy of the rule of law. \r\n Mrs. Cabello de Daboin (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): My delegation would \r\nlike to begin by expressing our thanks for the report of \r\nthe International Criminal Court (ICC) on its activities \r\nfor 2009-2010 before the General Assembly (see \r\nA/65/313). In the report, the Court reports to the \r\nUnited Nations for the sixth consecutive year on its \r\nmain activities in bringing to justice those responsible \r\nfor the most serious crimes affecting the international \r\ncommunity. The report reflects the unifying work of \r\nthe ICC and we would therefore like to congratulate its \r\nPresident and all its members. \r\n Section II of the report was written for the \r\npurpose of describing the outcomes of an event that \r\nwas extremely important to the Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela. As is generally known, from 31 May to \r\n11 June the Review Conference of the Rome Statute \r\nwas held in Kampala, Uganda. We would again like to \r\nthank the people of Uganda for their hospitality during \r\nthe Conference. \r\n In Kampala, an amendment was adopted whereby \r\nthe definition of the crime of aggression and the \r\nconditions under which the ICC can exercise \r\njurisdiction with respect to that crime were \r\nincorporated into the Statute. The political \r\ncircumstances prevailing on the international scene in \r\n1998, when the Rome Statute was adopted, made it \r\nnecessary for the crime of aggression, although \r\nformally included in the Statute, to remain outside the \r\nCourt’s jurisdiction. A waiting period was introduced, \r\nboth for defining the crime and for the activation of the \r\nCourt’s jurisdiction with respect to it. It was hoped \r\nthat, 12 years on, the international political scene \r\nwould have evolved to the benefit of countries that, \r\nlike ours, have voiced their desire for a true \r\ndemocratization of the United Nations system, \r\neliminating once and for all the antidemocratic system \r\nthat prevails in the Security Council. Unfortunately, \r\nfrom 1998 to our meeting in Kampala, there were few \r\nmajor changes in this regard. \r\n While the definition of the crime of aggression \r\nhas finally been incorporated into the Rome Statute, we \r\nall bore witness to the great pressure exerted by those \r\nStates which, with a view to continuing to postpone the \r\nfull operation of the ICC, proposed the establishment \r\nof a new waiting period before which the Court could \r\nexercise its jurisdiction over the crime of aggression. \r\nMy delegation recalls the example of one statement \r\nmade during the Conference, according to which the \r\nInternational Criminal Court was not yet sufficiently \r\nmature to include the crime of aggression and it would \r\ntherefore be necessary to await a further review \r\nconference to discuss the question of its incorporation. \r\nAs a result, the international community will have to \r\nwait yet again, this time until 2017, when the Court \r\nwill finally exercise jurisdiction with respect to the \r\ncrime of aggression and begin to try those responsible \r\nfor committing that serious crime and bring an end to \r\nimpunity in that regard. \r\n Nevertheless, with a view to striking a balance at \r\nthe Kampala Conference, we were encouraged that the \r\namendment was adopted by the consensus of all \r\nmembers of the ICC and that, as of 2017, the Court \r\nwill be able to exercise its independence and not be \r\nsubject to political filters, in compliance with its \r\nobjectives and functions. \r\n As a State party to the Rome Statute, my country \r\nwelcomes the outcome of the Conference and notes \r\nthat, in Kampala, we not only adopted the amendment \r\nto the Statute concerning the crime of aggression and \r\narticle 8, which we also welcome, but that States \r\nparties also reaffirmed our commitment to the Statute \r\nand the International Criminal Court in the aptly titled \r\nKampala Declaration. We also welcomed the pledging \r\nceremony, which our delegation considered to be an \r\n A/65/PV.41\r\n \r\n11 10-61179 \r\n \r\nimportant event due to its openness and inclusiveness, \r\nand in which States parties, non-parties and regional \r\norganizations participated. Venezuela was among those \r\nthat participated and pledged. \r\n In this regard, we recall that, in the days prior to \r\nthe Review Conference, the Union of South American \r\nNations (UNASUR) and its heads of State and \r\nGovernment met in special session and issued a \r\ndeclaration condemning the most serious crimes of \r\ninternational concern and reaffirming their \r\ncommitment to the Rome Statute and the ICC. \r\nUNASUR represents the only region in which every \r\nState has ratified the Rome Statute. \r\n Today, UNASUR is mourning the untimely and \r\nshocking passing of its Secretary-General, former \r\nArgentinean President Néstor Kirchner, whose death is \r\na loss not only for Argentina but for the whole region. \r\nIn the words of our President, Hugo Chávez Frias, \r\nNéstor Kirchner was a pillar of the continent, a \r\nbulwark of the region, a friend of South America and a \r\nbrother of Venezuela. Our profound condolences go to \r\nthe people of Argentina and to his wife, President \r\nCristina Fernández de Kirchner. We will miss that great \r\nbuilder of the new Latin American homeland who was, \r\nabove all, a friend and brother to Venezuela. \r\n We would not wish to end our statement without \r\nfirst thanking the co-facilitators of the ICC review for \r\ntheir valuable work, which allowed the Review \r\nConference to take a genuine step forward in terms of \r\nthe assessment and future of international criminal \r\njustice. Finally, the Republic of Venezuela asserts once \r\nmore its firmest commitment to the system that \r\nincludes the Rome Statute and the ICC. Proof of that is \r\nthe fact that my country was the third country of the \r\nLatin American and Caribbean region to ratify the \r\nStatute. In this context, my delegation stresses that the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela is convinced that, if \r\ntrue international criminal justice is to exist, the Rome \r\nStatute must achieve universality as soon as possible. \r\nTo that end, we commit ourselves to promoting, in the \r\nvarious forums of Latin America and the Caribbean in \r\nwhich we participate, its ratification by those countries \r\nthat have not yet done so. In this context, we welcome \r\nthe newest States parties to the Statute: Bangladesh, \r\nSeychelles, Saint Lucia and Moldova. \r\n Mr. Rodríguez (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nwould like to thank the President of the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC), Judge Sang-Hyun Song, for his \r\nthorough presentation of the hard work accomplished \r\nby the Court in the past year. \r\n Over the past year, a number of events pertinent \r\nto the work of the Court have occurred. First, \r\nBangladesh, Seychelles, Saint Lucia and Moldova have \r\nratified the Rome Statute, so that we now total 114 \r\nStates parties. This is very encouraging, but a number \r\nof States have not yet ratified or signed. Peru therefore \r\ncalls on those States that have not yet done so to ratify \r\nor become parties to the Statute so that it can achieve a \r\ngenuinely universal scope that will prevent the most \r\nserious crimes of international concern from going \r\nunpunished. \r\n While the increase in the number of States parties \r\nis essential, so too is strengthening cooperation among \r\nStates so that the Court can achieve its goals. To that \r\nend, it is always important to remember that States \r\nmust comply with the provisions of the Statute by \r\nsupplying information; executing arrest warrants issued \r\nby the Court; detaining suspects and transferring them, \r\nwhere necessary, to the Court; protecting witnesses and \r\nvictims; and implementing and aligning their domestic \r\nlaws with the Statute. \r\n Unfortunately, the Court does not always enjoy \r\nthe necessary cooperation. This is a matter of concern, \r\nas the report of the Court (see A/65/313) indicates in \r\nregard to arrest warrants that have not been executed, \r\nthat some persons whose arrests have been ordered by \r\nthe Court have yet to be brought to justice or \r\nsurrendered to the Court. The cooperation of States \r\nwith respect to arrest warrants is an obligation derived \r\nboth from the Statute and from the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\n Similarly, we must support cooperation between \r\nthe ICC and the United Nations. It should be noted that \r\nsuch cooperation has allowed the Court to undertake \r\nimportant efforts and to publicize and raise awareness \r\nof its work. We trust that such cooperation will become \r\nincreasingly close and coordinated, so that the Court \r\ncan rely on the support of the various organs and \r\nentities of the United Nations. \r\n The International Criminal Court plays a \r\nfundamental role in promoting the rule of law in that it \r\nis the only permanent judicial institution charged with \r\ninvestigating and trying those charged with the most \r\nserious crimes of international concern. This task \r\nrequires a balance to be struck between respecting the \r\nrights of the accused and allowing victims to \r\nA/65/PV.41  \r\n \r\n10-61179 12 \r\n \r\nparticipate in the proceedings, which is one of the \r\ninnovative aspects of the Rome Statute. \r\n The outstanding work of the Court’s judges and \r\nstaff has allowed the ICC to enjoy great legitimacy in \r\nthe eyes of the international community. We can \r\ntherefore assert that the international community, and \r\nvictims in particular, recognize the Court as a genuine \r\ninstrument of justice. This is borne out by the fact that, \r\nduring the current judicial year, it has received 559 \r\nnew communications relating to article 15 of the Rome \r\nStatute. This is noteworthy, given that behind these \r\ncommunications are potential cases in which war \r\ncrimes, crimes of genocide or crimes against humanity \r\nmay have been committed. \r\n There can be no doubt that the Review \r\nConference strengthened the system created by the \r\nRome Statute. On the one hand, the Kampala \r\nDeclaration and the exercise of submitting pledges \r\nreflect the firm commitment of States to the Court’s \r\nwork and to international criminal justice in general. \r\nSimilarly, the stocktaking of international criminal \r\njustice has made it possible to address crucial areas \r\nrelating to cooperation, complementarity, the impact of \r\nthe system on victims and affected communities, and \r\nthe relationship between peace and justice, as well as \r\nto identify the challenges they present. Dealing with \r\nthis requires the involvement not only of States but \r\nalso of international organizations and, in particular, of \r\ncivil society. \r\n Moreover, the amendments adopted will make it \r\npossible to fully implement the provisions of article 5 \r\nof the Statute, regarding crimes that are under the \r\nCourt’s jurisdiction. It should be noted that, with \r\nrespect to the crime of aggression, through its \r\nresolution RC/Res.6, the Review Conference expressed \r\nits determination to make the Court’s jurisdiction \r\noperational as soon as possible. To that end, States \r\nagreed on a definition of the crime of aggression and \r\nthe conditions necessary for the Court to exercise \r\njurisdiction, such exercise of jurisdiction being subject \r\nto a decision to be adopted by the States in 2017. \r\n Lastly, Peru wishes to reiterate its willingness to \r\ncollaborate actively and constructively with the \r\nInternational Criminal Court in order to combat \r\nimpunity for the most serious crimes of international \r\nconcern. \r\n Ms. Millicay (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nBefore I begin, I would like to express my thanks for \r\nthe heartfelt condolences expressed by the delegation \r\nof Venezuela and for the displays of sorrow and \r\naffection received from other delegations on the death \r\nof the former President of my country, Mr. Néstor \r\nKirchner. \r\n Argentina expresses its appreciation and \r\nrecognition to the President of the International \r\nCriminal Court, Mr. Sang-Hyun Song, for his \r\nsubmission of the report on the Court to the United \r\nNations contained in document A/65/313. \r\n The Rome Statute and the International Criminal \r\nCourt are among the most notable achievements of \r\nmultilateral diplomacy, and their contribution to \r\nfighting impunity for crimes against humanity, crimes \r\nof genocide and war crimes is evident. Only a decade \r\nafter the adoption of the Rome Statute, the Court is a \r\nfully functioning permanent international criminal \r\ntribunal. \r\n Since the last report of the International Criminal \r\nCourt to the Assembly (A/64/356), in addition to the \r\nsituations in Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo, the Central African Republic and Darfur, the \r\nSudan, in November 2009 the Court assigned the \r\nsituation in Kenya to Pre-Trial Chamber II, which \r\nauthorized the Prosecutor in March 2010 to open an \r\ninvestigation. Also, on 22 November 2010, the trial \r\nagainst Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo for war crimes and \r\ncrimes against humanity in the Central African \r\nRepublic will begin. \r\n This year also finds the Rome Statute and the \r\nInternational Criminal Court strengthened. To date, 114 \r\nStates are parties to the Statute. Accordingly, I would \r\nlike to welcome Bangladesh, Seychelles, Saint Lucia \r\nand Moldova to the Statute. \r\n The other reason to be gratified is the success of \r\nthe Review Conference of the Rome Statute, which \r\ntook place in Kampala, Uganda, from 31 May to \r\n11 June. The Conference, excellently organized by the \r\nRepublic of Uganda, was attended by a large number of \r\nStates parties, non-parties and representatives of civil \r\nsociety. Attendance at the segment devoted to the \r\ngeneral debate and the adoption of the Kampala \r\nDeclaration was at the highest level. \r\n A/65/PV.41\r\n \r\n13 10-61179 \r\n \r\n Allow me now to refer to the achievements of the \r\nReview Conference. \r\n The Conference adopted, as corollary to the high-\r\nlevel segment, the Kampala Declaration, whereby \r\nStates parties reaffirmed their commitment to the Rome \r\nStatute and to its full application, universality and \r\nintegrity. They also renewed their determination to put \r\nan end to impunity for perpetrators of the most serious \r\ncrimes of international concern, emphasizing that \r\njustice is a fundamental building block of sustainable \r\npeace, and decided to pursue and strengthen their \r\nefforts to ensure full cooperation with the Court in \r\naccordance with the Statute and to maintain their \r\npolitical and diplomatic support for the Court. They \r\nalso decided to celebrate 17 July, the day of the \r\nadoption of the Rome Statute in 1998, as the Day of \r\nInternational Criminal Justice. \r\n At the pledging ceremony, many States parties, \r\none observer State and one international organization \r\nof regional integration made pledges. Argentina was \r\namong them. \r\n The stocktaking of international criminal justice \r\nproduced remarkable results, due undoubtedly to the \r\nhigh level of the panellists and other participants and to \r\nthe active participation of States and civil society. \r\nArgentina had the privilege of being one of the focal \r\npoints, jointly with the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo and Switzerland, on the topic of peace and \r\njustice. We were pleased to participate in the panel on \r\nthat topic in Kampala, whose debates reinforced the \r\nconclusion that there can be no lasting peace without \r\njustice and that peace and justice are thus \r\ncomplementary requirements. I take this opportunity to \r\nrecognize the devoted and cooperative work of \r\nSwitzerland and the Democratic Republic of the Congo \r\nand the contribution of the experts providing \r\nbackground material and of States and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, which also provided \r\nvaluable material. \r\n One of the firmest commitments made in the \r\nKampala Declaration was to work actively during the \r\nReview Conference towards the satisfactory outcome \r\non the amendment proposals to be considered at the \r\nConference. \r\n Regarding article 124, the Review Conference \r\ndecided to retain it in its current form and agreed to \r\nfurther review its provisions during the fourteenth \r\nsession of the Assembly of States Parties, in \r\nrecognition of its merely transitional nature. The \r\nReview Conference also adopted amendments to article \r\n8 of the Statute, adding to the list of war crimes acts \r\ncommitted in the context of armed conflicts not of an \r\ninternational character, employing poison or certain \r\npoisonous weapons; asphyxiating, poisonous or similar \r\ngases and all analogous liquids, materials and devices; \r\nor bullets that expand or flatten easily in the human \r\nbody. Such amendments constitute a step forward in \r\nthe fight against impunity regarding breaches of \r\ninternational humanitarian law. I recognize the \r\ninitiative of the delegation of Belgium in this regard. \r\n But the definition of the crime of aggression is \r\nthe amendment that determined the historic \r\nsignificance of the Review Conference. In 1945, the \r\nfounders of the modern international community and of \r\nthis Organization decided to ban the use or threat of \r\nuse of armed force by States as a pillar of the peaceful \r\nrelations among States. The Kampala Conference \r\nreinforced that pillar through the incorporation of \r\narticles 8 bis, 15 bis and 15 ter into the Rome Statute, \r\ndefining aggression as a crime that triggers individual \r\ncriminal liability. The adoption of articles 8 bis, 15 bis \r\nand 15 ter fulfilled the mandate arising from the now-\r\ndeleted paragraph 2 of article 5 of the Rome Statute. \r\n Article 8 bis contains the definition of the crime \r\nof aggression. This definition was drawn up during \r\nyears of work by a working group open to the \r\nparticipation not only of States parties, but also of \r\nnon-parties and representatives of civil society. The \r\nelements of crimes were also adopted. Regarding the \r\nexercise of the jurisdiction of the Court with respect to \r\nthe crime of aggression, article 15 bis, adopted in \r\nKampala, provides for the referral by a State and the \r\ncommencement of an investigation proprio motu by the \r\nProsecutor, as set forth in paragraphs (a) and (c) of \r\narticle 13 of the Rome Statute. \r\n Referral by the Security Council in the case of \r\naggression is provided for in similar terms to those for \r\nother crimes under the jurisdiction of the Court. State \r\nreferral and the commencement of an investigation \r\nproprio motu represent a balance between the role of \r\nthe Security Council and that of the Court as an \r\nindependent judicial tribunal. In both cases, the Court \r\nwill be able to exercise its jurisdiction with respect to \r\ncrimes of aggression committed one year after the \r\nratification or acceptance of the amendments by \r\n30 States parties and after the parties have adopted, as \r\nof 2017, the decision to activate the exercise of \r\nA/65/PV.41  \r\n \r\n10-61179 14 \r\n \r\njurisdiction of the Court in accordance with the \r\namendment. \r\n The historic significance of the incorporation into \r\nthe Rome Statute of the definition of the crime of \r\naggression and the conditions for the exercise of the \r\njurisdiction of the Court cannot be underestimated. \r\nNegotiations began after the adoption of the Rome \r\nStatute, as recalled by the heretofore unfulfilled \r\nmandate contained in paragraph 2 of article 5. During \r\nthose protracted negotiations, notable progress was \r\nmade on the definition of the crime of aggression, \r\nleaving for Kampala and the previous phase the hard \r\nwork of defining a formula containing the conditions \r\nfor the exercise of the jurisdiction of the Court. \r\n The negotiating effort was enormous. Lasting for \r\nyears, it was guided by the successive coordinators of \r\nthe Special Working Group on the Crime of \r\nAggression, with the active participation of States \r\nparties, non-parties and non-governmental organizations. In \r\nKampala, delegations worked hard to achieve a \r\nformula that may not have represented the ideal that \r\nevery country would have preferred with respect to the \r\nexercise of jurisdiction, but that largely incorporated \r\nelements of all positions and thereby reflected a \r\ndelicate compromise of the kind that can be achieved \r\nwhen great effort is exerted towards a common \r\nobjective. That made it possible for the amendment on \r\nthe crime of aggression to be adopted by consensus. \r\n We hope that the amendments adopted by the \r\nReview Conference will soon be communicated to \r\nStates parties by the Secretary-General, in his capacity \r\nas depository for the Statute, and we encourage all \r\nStates parties to the Statute to ratify the amendments \r\nadopted as soon as possible, including the one on the \r\ncrime of aggression. \r\n The International Criminal Court is the first \r\npermanent international criminal tribunal. Cooperation \r\nby States, particularly the States parties, is required in \r\norder for the Court to exercise its full jurisdiction. Part \r\n9 of the Rome Statute establishes obligations for States \r\nparties — which were reaffirmed by the renewed \r\ncommitment set out in the Kampala Declaration — to \r\nstrengthen our efforts to ensure full cooperation with \r\nthe Court, in particular in the enforcement of Court \r\ndecisions and the execution of arrest warrants. \r\n  Mr. Mac-Donald (Suriname), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n \r\n Allow me to conclude by recalling, as we did in \r\nthe Kampala Declaration, \r\n “the aims and purposes of the Rome Statute \r\nand ... the noble mission and the role of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court in a multilateral \r\nsystem that aims to end impunity, establish the \r\nrule of law, promote and encourage respect for \r\nhuman rights and achieve sustainable peace, in \r\naccordance with international law and the \r\npurposes and principles of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations,” \r\nand to reiterate, once again, the firm commitment of \r\nArgentina to the International Criminal Court. \r\n Mr. Seck (Senegal) (spoke in French): Senegal \r\naligns itself with the statement made yesterday by the \r\nrepresentative of Zambia on the Rome Statute on \r\nbehalf of the Group of African States (see A/65/PV.39). \r\nI would also like to make some comments in my \r\nnational capacity. \r\n At the outset, I offer warm and sincere thanks to \r\nthe President of the International Criminal Court, Mr. \r\nSang-Hyun Song, for the detailed presentation of the \r\nCourt’s activities from 1 August 2009 to 31 July 2010. \r\nAs President Song said, during the period under \r\nreview, the Court’s activities experienced significant \r\ndevelopments that will undoubtedly impact the life and \r\nthe future of that body. But I am sure that Member \r\nStates will agree that the successful organization on \r\nAfrican soil, in Uganda, of the first Review Conference \r\nof the Rome Statute, was the beacon that will certainly \r\nlead to the next phase of international criminal justice \r\nin the next decade, in view of its considerable \r\ncontribution to the strengthening of the Rome Statute \r\nand international humanitarian law. \r\n In fact and in line with our expectations, the \r\nReview Conference was not simply another \r\nopportunity to just gather together and then return \r\nhome without having seriously considered the many \r\nchallenges that must be addressed in order to fine-tune \r\nand complete the system established by the Rome \r\nStatute. Besides the list of subjects considered in the \r\nstocktaking, reflecting the Court’s major concerns, the \r\nlaudable results achieved by the Review Conference \r\nunder the Statute’s mandate for the review should also \r\nbe commended. \r\n A/65/PV.41\r\n \r\n15 10-61179 \r\n \r\n Of course, that mission was not easy, given the \r\nmany cases of reticence seen here and there mostly for \r\npolitical or strategic reasons. But the challenge was \r\nwithin our grasp, thanks especially to the belief and \r\ncommitment exhibited. Results were also achieved \r\nwith regard to the difficult issue of the crime of \r\naggression, which required more than a decade of \r\nintensive work. The compromise reached in Kampala \r\nwas certainly not perfect — as is the case for any \r\ncompromise — but still allowed us to define the crime \r\nof aggression and establish conditions for the Court’s \r\njurisdiction in that regard, even though a decision must \r\nstill be taken after 1 January 2017 in order to activate \r\nthat jurisdiction. Thus, the decision, which required \r\ngreat effort to achieve, must be correctly applied. The \r\nCourt’s credibility depends on that. \r\n We should also welcome the widening of the \r\nCourt’s competencies with regard to war crimes \r\nresulting from certain acts committed in a \r\nnon-international armed conflict, such as the use of \r\ncertain toxins and expanding bullets, toxic \r\nasphyxiating gases and all similar liquids, solids and \r\nmaterials, as well as the use of bullets that flatten and \r\nspread throughout the body. That is an additional step \r\nto strengthen international humanitarian law and \r\nshould be welcomed appropriately. \r\n I would like to conclude by reiterating the \r\nunwavering commitment of my country, Senegal, and \r\nits senior authorities to the ideals of peace and justice \r\nthat underpin the international criminal justice system \r\nand form the basis of the International Criminal \r\nCourt’s creation. Senegal’s unequivocal commitment to \r\nthose fundamental values — which has translated into \r\nvisible participation in all regional and international \r\ncampaigns and initiatives to promote and create an \r\ninternational criminal court — strengthens its resolve \r\nin the quest for an apolitical, non-discriminatory and \r\nimpartial international criminal justice system that \r\nmeets the legitimate aspirations of peoples for peace \r\nand justice. \r\n Mr. Gevorgian (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): First, allow me to express our appreciation to \r\nMr. Sang-Hyun Song, President of the International \r\nCriminal Court, for his report (see A/65/313). The \r\nRussian delegation is pleased to note the growing \r\nmomentum in the Court’s work, its strengthened role in \r\ncombating impunity and its contribution to ensuring \r\nwider observance of international law in general. My \r\ndelegation notes the importance of the Court as the \r\nfirst full-time international organ for criminal justice \r\nthat is general in scope and not designed to consider a \r\nparticular regional situation. \r\n The Court possesses a powerful capability for \r\npreventing the most serious crimes, which can affect \r\nthe interests of the entire international community. The \r\nCourt’s strength is not so much that it can punish, but \r\nthat its very existence exerts a serious influence both \r\non the global political climate and on States’ domestic \r\nlegislation. It is important that that potential be fully \r\nrealized. It is hard to imagine achieving that goal \r\nwithout the reliable support of States and international \r\nand regional organizations. \r\n Russia favours strengthening the authority of the \r\nCourt and is attentively following the status of cases on \r\nits docket. In our view, the broad participation of States \r\nin the Rome Statute is a vitally important factor for the \r\nCourt. The Court is going through a formative stage. \r\nThe extent to which it effectively and objectively \r\ndischarges its functions will largely determine its \r\nprospects for becoming a truly universal organ for \r\ninternational criminal justice. \r\n At the Rome Diplomatic Conference Russia voted \r\nfor the Statute, and later signed it. Now, though it \r\nremains outside the framework of the Statute, Russia is \r\ncooperating with the Court in a fruitful manner. \r\n An important milestone in the development of the \r\nCourt was this year’s Review Conference of the Rome \r\nStatute in Kampala, in which our delegation \r\nparticipated actively. We are grateful to the \r\nGovernment of Uganda for its excellent organization of \r\nthe event and for its hospitality. The Russian \r\nFederation has a generally positive assessment of the \r\nresults of the Conference. Of course, the main question \r\nbefore the meeting was the adoption of the amendment \r\non the crime of aggression, without which the \r\njurisdiction of the Court would be incomplete. \r\n That matter is of great importance and its \r\npolitical significance far transcends the Court. The \r\nsolution that was found was, of course, a compromise. \r\nIt is important that it was based on broad consensus \r\nincluding both parties and non-parties to the Statute. \r\nThe compromise formula reflects, in our opinion, the \r\nrole of the Security Council in the global system of \r\ncollective security. However, we still have some \r\nconcerns regarding the possible prospects of the Court \r\nexercising jurisdiction over crimes of aggression \r\nA/65/PV.41  \r\n \r\n10-61179 16 \r\n \r\nwithout the appropriate decision by the Security \r\nCouncil. \r\n We discussed that issue in Kampala, and we \r\nre-emphasize here that the crime of aggression bears a \r\nclear, undeniable political dimension. It is always \r\ncommitted not by individuals but by leaders of States \r\nrelying on the full power of their States, so an \r\nindividual cannot possibly commit the crime of \r\naggression without aggression by the State. Under the \r\nUnited Nations Charter, the universal treaty \r\nsuperseding all other international treaties, the \r\nprerogative of establishing that an act of aggression has \r\nbeen committed belongs to the Security Council. \r\n That is, in our view, the objective legal situation. \r\nThe Court cannot operate in isolation from it. It has \r\nworked and is working in an international legal context \r\nup until now. In that regard, we are of the view that the \r\ninterpretation and application of the relevant provisions \r\non aggression should be implemented in full \r\ncompliance with the United Nations Charter. On that \r\nbasis, we believe it reasonable that the Conference \r\nconditioned the application of the provisions on \r\naggression on the adoption of a special and separate \r\ndecision to that effect to be taken after 1 January 2017. \r\n Mr. Moeletsi (Lesotho): We align ourselves with \r\nthe statement delivered by the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Zambia on behalf of the African \r\nStates parties to the International Criminal Court. We \r\ncommend the Court for its comprehensive report, \r\ncontained in document A/65/313. As a State party to \r\nthe Rome Statute, Lesotho has consistently expressed \r\nits support for the Court. Lesotho reiterates that \r\nsupport today. My delegation sees the Court as an \r\nimportant institution in the fight against impunity and \r\nin the promotion of justice. \r\n Our statement will address the cooperation of \r\nStates parties and other States with the Court, the \r\nuniversality of the Rome Statute and the recent Review \r\nConference of the Rome Statute, which was held in \r\nKampala in the Republic of Uganda. Our basic premise \r\nis that the Court cannot discharge its functions \r\neffectively without the cooperation of States parties \r\nand other States, but particularly the States parties. As \r\nstressed in the report, the Court relies on the \r\ncooperation of States parties and other States in such \r\nareas as facilitating investigations, arresting and \r\nsurrendering persons, protecting witnesses and \r\nenforcing sentences. It is in that context that we urge \r\nall States parties to do their utmost to provide the Court \r\nwith the best possible assistance. \r\n However, we are acutely aware of the necessity \r\nfor States to have a consistent, clear and unambiguous \r\nframework for cooperation under the Statute. In that \r\nregard, we note the Court’s efforts to engage in \r\nbilateral agreements with States parties with regard to \r\ncooperation under the Rome Statute’s general \r\nobligation to cooperate. \r\n Regarding the universality of the Rome Statute, \r\nwe are pleased to note that, with the ratification of the \r\nRome Statute by Bangladesh, Seychelles, Saint Lucia \r\nand the Republic of Moldova, there are now 114 States \r\nparties to the Statute. It is a remarkable achievement \r\nthat so many States from all regions have ratified the \r\nStatute within such a short space of time. It is also a \r\ngenuine reflection of the international community’s \r\nincreasing rejection of impunity for serious crimes and \r\nevidence that there is a rising tide in favour of the rule \r\nof law. \r\n The crimes falling under the jurisdiction of the \r\nCourt are universally accepted as the most serious \r\ncrimes of international concern. We share a common \r\nresponsibility to ensure that they are effectively \r\ninvestigated and that the perpetrators are brought to \r\njustice. We are now witnessing a historic shift towards \r\nuniversal acceptance of the thesis that the long-term \r\ninterests of all nations, irrespective of size, region or \r\npolitical orientation, are better served by strengthening \r\nthe rule of law and promoting justice. We encourage all \r\nStates that are not parties to positively consider being \r\nStates parties to the Rome Statute. \r\n The recent Review Conference of the Rome \r\nStatute in Kampala was undoubtedly a success. It \r\ntackled critical questions such as the definition of the \r\ncrime of aggression and the conditions under which the \r\nCourt may exercise jurisdiction in respect of that \r\ncrime. The Conference also provided an opportune \r\nmoment to take stock of the state of criminal justice. \r\nThe stocktaking exercise covered areas such as peace \r\nand justice and complementarity. Lesotho continues to \r\nbelieve that, in the final analysis, the success of \r\ninternational criminal justice founded on the Rome \r\nStatute must partly be determined by the capacity of \r\ndomestic court systems to deal with the serious crimes \r\nin question. We therefore deem it fitting that a \r\nstocktaking exercise was part of the Review \r\nConference. \r\n A/65/PV.41\r\n \r\n17 10-61179 \r\n \r\n In conclusion, we reiterate Lesotho’s firm and \r\nlong-standing commitment to the integrity of the Rome \r\nStatute and to an effective and credible International \r\nCriminal Court. We believe that the Court should enjoy \r\nthe broadest possible support from all States. As United \r\nNations Member States, we all share the universal \r\nvalues that are fundamental to the protection of human \r\ndignity. That protection relies on concerted action on \r\nour part to prevent the most serious crimes affecting \r\nthe international community as a whole. \r\n Mr. Böhlke (Brazil): I thank the President of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC), Judge Sang-Hyun \r\nSong, for presenting the sixth report of the Court (see \r\nA/65/313) to the General Assembly (see A/65/PV.39). I \r\nalso commend him and his fellow judges for their \r\nsignificant contribution towards fostering international \r\njustice. \r\n International law has been under constant \r\ndevelopment, and one of the hallmarks of that \r\nimpressive movement is the attribution of a special \r\ncondition to individuals. They are no longer only the \r\nsubject matter upon which treaties are negotiated. Now, \r\nindividuals are entitled to specific rights and also bear \r\nresponsibilities under international law. \r\n In that context, the Rome Statute puts the human \r\nperson at the centre of international law. The ICC is the \r\nfirst permanent, treaty-based court to try persons \r\naccused of the most serious crimes of international \r\nconcern. At the same time, it allows victims of such \r\ncrimes to be part of the proceedings in order to present \r\ntheir views and observations, with the possibility of \r\nobtaining some form of reparation for their suffering. \r\n However, the Court cannot move ahead alone. In \r\norder for the Court to succeed in its efforts to provide \r\njustice, it needs the vital support and cooperation of all \r\nStates. Universality is a permanent concern of those \r\nwho helped to establish the Court. My delegation \r\nsincerely hopes that more States, large and small, may \r\nratify the Statute or accede to it in the near future with \r\na view to granting a truly universal character to the \r\nCourt. \r\n Like previous delegations, Brazil applauds the \r\nrecent decision of the Governments of Bangladesh, \r\nMoldova, Saint Lucia and Seychelles to ratify the \r\nRome Statute, making the number of States parties 114. \r\nIn becoming parties to the Rome Statute, those States \r\nhave contributed to strengthening the legitimacy of the \r\nCourt and have joined the international community in \r\nits endeavour to put an end to impunity. \r\n On a different note, we wish to express our \r\nsatisfaction with the significant achievements of the \r\nReview Conference of the Rome Statute, held in \r\nKampala earlier this year. At the Kampala conference \r\nwe took an important step in the fight against impunity. \r\nBased on a consensus decision taken by all States \r\nparties, with the valuable support of many other \r\ninterested delegations, we were able to amend the \r\nRome Statute to include not only the definition of the \r\ncrime of aggression, but also the conditions under \r\nwhich the Court may exercise jurisdiction with respect \r\nto that crime. \r\n While acknowledging the role played by the \r\nSecurity Council in determining the occurrence of an \r\nact of aggression, the Conference agreed to authorize \r\nthe Prosecutor, in the absence of such determination, to \r\ninitiate an investigation on his own initiative or upon \r\nState referral, with the prior authorization of the \r\nPre-Trial Division of the Court. That approach ensures \r\nthe independence of the Court. \r\n My delegation has strongly advocated for the \r\nneed to define the crime of aggression. That position \r\nreflects Brazil’s long-standing commitment to \r\ninternational law and, specifically, the primacy of \r\nmultilateral rules on the use of force. In our view, the \r\nadoption of the definition of the crime of aggression \r\nstrengthens the Court, fulfils an obligation undertaken \r\nin Rome in 1998 and contributes to a more just, safe \r\nand equitable international order. \r\n Obviously, the successful outcome of the Review \r\nConference was possible only in the light of the firm \r\nengagement and remarkable flexibility of many \r\ndelegations. The result was a compromise deal that \r\ncombined elements from all participants. Part of that \r\npackage was the decision, by the same majority of \r\nStates parties as is required for the adoption of an \r\namendment to the Statute, to activate the agreed \r\nmechanism only after 1 January 2017. \r\n Even though it was not the preference of my \r\ndelegation, we accepted that the Court does not have \r\njurisdiction with respect to crimes of aggression \r\ncommitted on the territory of non-States parties or by \r\ntheir nationals. Nor does the Court have jurisdiction \r\nwith regard to States parties that declare that they do \r\nnot accept the Court’s jurisdiction over the crime of \r\naggression. Otherwise, the Court continues to have \r\nA/65/PV.41  \r\n \r\n10-61179 18 \r\n \r\njurisdiction over the crime of aggression in relation to \r\nall States parties. \r\n In addition to the progress made with regard to \r\nthe crime of aggression, my delegation notes with great \r\nsatisfaction other important achievements of the \r\nReview Conference, such as the adoption of \r\namendments to article 8 and the Kampala Declaration, \r\nwhich reaffirms our commitment to the Rome Statute \r\nand the Court. Moreover, the Review Conference \r\nconstituted a valuable opportunity to engage States \r\nparties, observers and civil society in a more in-depth \r\ndiscussion of the current status of international \r\ncriminal justice, addressing some pressing issues, such \r\nas peace, justice, complementarity, victims and \r\ncooperation. \r\n In conclusion, my delegation wishes to stress the \r\nimportance of further strengthening cooperation \r\nbetween the International Criminal Court and the \r\nUnited Nations. The work of the Court contributes to \r\nour efforts to include the concept of the rule of law in \r\nthe many ongoing initiatives undertaken within the \r\nUnited Nations system. \r\n Ms. Guo Xiaomei (China) (spoke in Chinese): At \r\nthe outset, I would like to thank President Song for his \r\nreport on the International Criminal Court (see \r\nA/65/313). \r\n China always attaches importance to the role of \r\ninternational criminal justice in the advancement of \r\nsocial development. China is in favour of setting up an \r\ninternational criminal judicial institution that is \r\nindependent, impartial, effective and universal to serve \r\nas a complement to national legal systems in punishing \r\nthe gravest international crimes, promoting \r\ninternational peace and achieving judicial justice. \r\n We have been closely following the activities of \r\nthe International Criminal Court. The Court has now \r\nbeen established for more than seven years. Not only \r\nhas it made some progress in institution-building, but it \r\nalso has entered into full judicial functioning, initiated \r\nthe investigation and prosecution of a number of cases \r\nand carried out explorations in judicial practice. It \r\nshould be acknowledged that the Court’s activities \r\nhave heightened the attention of the international \r\ncommunity with regard to international criminal law. \r\nAt the same time, we have also noted that some of the \r\nCourt’s practices have affected the stability of and the \r\nharmony among countries in the regions concerned and \r\ngiven rise to broad concern in the international \r\ncommunity. \r\n The first Review Conference of the Rome Statute, \r\nheld in Kampala in June, adopted an amendment to the \r\narticle on the crime of aggression. China, as an \r\nobserver State, participated in its negotiation in a \r\npositive and responsible manner. China has noted that \r\nsome countries still have concerns and reservations \r\nregarding that amendment. We will closely follow \r\ndevelopments in that regard and are ready to further \r\nexchange views with all countries on that issue. \r\n The Chinese delegation believes that the Court, \r\nas part of the international community and as a \r\nmember of the world peace and security system, cannot \r\noperate successfully without the support of countries \r\nand relevant international organizations. The Court \r\nmust conduct its work within the current international \r\nlaw system, based on the United Nations Charter. \r\n International judicial justice and international \r\npeace are mutually reinforcing and complementary. A \r\nfundamental requirement for the pursuit of judicial \r\njustice should be to safeguard the values of peace and \r\nsecurity and maintain a harmonious and stable \r\ninternational order. Therefore, it is our hope that the \r\nCourt will exercise its functions more prudently in its \r\nfuture work, further establish its credibility and, \r\nthrough its objective and impartial performance, win \r\nbroader trust and support from the international \r\ncommunity so as to make its contribution to peace and \r\njustice. \r\n Mr. Ntwaagae (Botswana): At the outset, allow \r\nme to convey my delegation’s sincere condolences to \r\nthe Government and people of Barbados and of \r\nArgentina on the sad loss of their Prime Minister and \r\nformer President, respectively. \r\n Let me take this opportunity to express our \r\nappreciation to the President of the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC) for the report of the Court (see \r\nA/65/313), which contains useful information on this \r\nagenda item. \r\n Botswana aligns itself with the statement \r\ndelivered at the 39th meeting by the representative of \r\nZambia on behalf of the African States parties. I would \r\nlike to make some general comments on a number of \r\nissues in my national capacity. \r\n A/65/PV.41\r\n \r\n19 10-61179 \r\n \r\n The consideration of this item comes at time \r\nwhen we have just witnessed the historic Review \r\nConference in Kampala, where we adopted some \r\namendments to the Statute, including a definition of the \r\ncrime of aggression. \r\n As a State party to the Rome Statute, Botswana is \r\ncommitted to maintaining the integrity of the Statute \r\nand supporting the promotion of its universality. We \r\nalso believe that the International Criminal Court \r\nshould be given the freedom to exercise its mandate \r\nwithout political or external influence. \r\n We are, however, alive to the fact that the role \r\nand mandate of the Court is intended to be \r\ncomplementary to national judicial systems. States \r\nhave the responsibility to develop legislation that will \r\neffectively deal with, and act as a deterrent to, \r\nperpetrators of crimes, including crimes against \r\nhumanity. That complementary function of the Court \r\nshould not be misinterpreted as an affront to national \r\njurisdiction and establishments, but should simply be \r\nunderstood as assisting our own efforts in closing the \r\nimpunity gap. \r\n We should never lose sight of the deterrent value \r\nprovided by the Rome Statute in safeguarding the \r\ninterests of global peace and security. The Statute gives \r\nthe international community an excellent opportunity \r\nto advance the ideals of the United Nations Charter, in \r\nwhich there is universality in the respect for human \r\nrights and enjoyment of fundamental freedoms for all. \r\n Botswana — consistent with its commitment to \r\nthe ideals and principles of the United Nations Charter \r\nand to the promotion of democracy, good governance, \r\nrespect for human rights and the rule of law — is of the \r\nfirm conviction that it is essential for Member States to \r\nextend the necessary cooperation to the Court in order \r\nto ensure that the perpetrators of grave crimes are \r\nbrought to justice. \r\n Botswana fully subscribes to the notion that the \r\nobjectives of international peace and security may be \r\npursued jointly, with the Court exercising its judicial \r\nmandate while the relevant organs of the United \r\nNations exercise their political mandate. My delegation \r\nis fully convinced that the relationship between the \r\nCourt and the United Nations system provides a good \r\nplatform for joint initiatives aimed at resolving \r\nconflicts and addressing the plight of victims, as well \r\nas promoting accountability on the part of those who \r\nare entrusted with the rare privilege and authority to \r\ngovern. \r\n We therefore believe that it is timely to invest our \r\ncollective energy in consolidating and strengthening \r\nthe role of the Court by building bridges between the \r\nCourt and the countries in question in order to reduce \r\nthe current negative perception about the work of the \r\nICC. We do not believe that the establishment of the \r\nICC Liaison Office at the African Union will be \r\ncontrary to that spirit, but rather that it would go a long \r\nway in addressing the misconceptions about the role \r\nand function of the Court. \r\n Let me conclude by once again reaffirming \r\nBotswana’s commitment to the preservation of the \r\nintegrity and independence of the International \r\nCriminal Court. To that end, I am pleased to report that \r\nBotswana is currently reviewing its domestic \r\nlegislation with a view to giving full effect to the \r\nprovisions of the Rome Statute. \r\n Mr. Joyini (South Africa): South Africa would \r\nlike to begin its intervention by associating itself with \r\nthe statement delivered at the 39th meeting by the \r\nPermanent Representative of Zambia on behalf of the \r\nAfrican States parties to the Rome Statute of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC). \r\n I am delighted to welcome His Excellency \r\nMr. Song, President of the International Criminal \r\nCourt, to New York. We thank him and his team of \r\njudges, not only for the Court’s report (see A/65/313) \r\nbut also for their tireless efforts in the promotion of \r\ninternational criminal justice with the ultimate \r\nobjective of securing a peaceful world for all of us who \r\nlive in it. \r\n We have taken note of the report of the ICC to the \r\nGeneral Assembly. As always, we found the report to \r\nbe comprehensive and to touch on very important \r\naspects relating to the Court’s work. \r\n We have particularly taken note of section III of \r\nthe report, on judicial proceedings. As a firm believer \r\nin judicial independence, we will restrict our comments \r\non that chapter. We note, however, that the effective \r\nand efficient functioning of the ICC itself, being \r\nindependent but also accountable in its administration, \r\nis also an important factor in bringing an end to \r\nimpunity and for setting standards for the prosecution \r\nand adjudication of the most heinous crimes of concern \r\nto humanity. \r\nA/65/PV.41  \r\n \r\n10-61179 20 \r\n \r\n A lot has been achieved over the past eight years, \r\nwith the ICC now having five active situations under \r\ninvestigation or in the trial phase. We look forward to \r\nthe completion of the Court’s first trial, a milestone \r\nthat will make tangible the fight against impunity. \r\n Again, we have taken note of the situations under \r\nanalysis by the Prosecutor. We are hopeful that the \r\nOffice of the Prosecutor will, with the requisite \r\nurgency, consider those issues and come to a decision. \r\nWe welcome the draft policy on the preliminary \r\nexaminations phase, and we are in the process of \r\nstudying this policy document. We also note that the \r\nProsecutor, having begun to deal with the situation in \r\nKenya, has decided to proceed with investigations. We \r\ntrust that other situations that have been pending for \r\nsome time, including those in Georgia, Colombia and \r\nPalestine, inter alia, will be decided upon in due \r\ncourse. \r\n In our statement of last year under this agenda \r\nitem, we urged the Office of the Prosecutor to adopt a \r\npurposive interpretation to article 12 of the Statute in \r\nconsidering whether to proceed with investigations. It \r\nis our view that, in order for the Court to be truly \r\nuniversal, it should be of benefit to victims everywhere \r\nin the world. \r\n The next two years are going to be significant in \r\nthe life of the Court. A new Prosecutor is to be elected \r\nin 2012. We hope that the process of electing the new \r\nProsecutor, in conformity with the Rome Statute and \r\nthe relevant resolutions of the Assembly of States \r\nParties, has begun in earnest. We are confident that the \r\nAssembly of States Parties will select a person of \r\nintegrity to hold that very important office. \r\n Without question, the highlight for the Court and \r\nfor international criminal justice in general in 2010 was \r\nthe Review Conference of the Rome Statute held in \r\nJune in Kampala. We are thankful to the Government \r\nof Uganda for hosting what we believe was a very \r\nsuccessful Review Conference. \r\n My delegation was particularly pleased with the \r\nconduct of the stocktaking exercise, which provided an \r\nopportunity for ICC States parties to look back and \r\ntake stock of the contributions that the Court has made \r\nto international criminal justice. In the course of the \r\nstocktaking at the Review Conference, we were able to \r\nconsider, in a comprehensive and honest manner, \r\nvarious aspects, including cooperation, peace and \r\njustice, complementarity and the impact of the Rome \r\nStatute on victims and affected communities. In all of \r\nthose areas, we were able to engage not only with each \r\nother as States parties, but also with non-States parties \r\nand civil society, on contributions that the Court can \r\nmake and has made to the further development of the \r\ninternational criminal justice system. \r\n As an outcome of those deliberations we were \r\nable to adopt a number of resolutions and, importantly, \r\na ministerial Declaration on the Review Conference, in \r\nwhich we collectively reaffirmed our commitment to \r\nthe principles and values underlying and reflected in \r\nthe Rome Statute. As we proceed to deal with issues \r\nafter the review, let us not forget those deliberations. \r\nWe should continuously look back and ask ourselves \r\nwhether our actions are in keeping with the \r\ncommitments that we made in Kampala. \r\n My delegation was particularly pleased to serve, \r\ntogether with the delegation of Denmark, as a focal \r\npoint for the topic of complementarity, which, as we all \r\nknow, is at the heart of the Rome Statute. Under that \r\nprinciple, the Court can only act where States are \r\nunable or unwilling to genuinely investigate and \r\nprosecute crimes in their own jurisdictions. Thus, even \r\nwhere serious international crimes have been \r\ncommitted, a case would not be admissible to the Court \r\nif the State concerned was itself conducting genuine \r\ndomestic proceedings. As focal points — and this idea \r\nwas affirmed by the States parties at the Review \r\nConference — we believe that, in order to give effect \r\nto the principle of complementarity in the Statute, \r\nnational jurisdictions must be strengthened and enabled \r\nto conduct genuine national investigations and trials of \r\nthe crimes included in the Rome Statute. We are \r\ndelighted to have been reappointed by the Bureau to \r\ncontinue on as a focal point with a view to taking \r\nforward the decisions reached in Kampala. \r\n But, of course, there were other issues on the \r\nagenda of the Review Conference, most notably the \r\nquestion of article 124 and the proposal on the \r\nenforcement of sentences. We are particularly pleased \r\nthat we were able to reach a decision to facilitate the \r\nwillingness and capability of States to offer facilities \r\nfor the enforcement of sentences. \r\n Without question the main issue on the agenda of \r\nthe Review Conference was the definition of the crime \r\nof aggression. At this stage, we all know that the Rome \r\nStatute includes aggression as a crime but provides that \r\nthe Court may exercise jurisdiction only after the \r\n A/65/PV.41\r\n \r\n21 10-61179 \r\n \r\nadoption of a definition. The deliberations, both before \r\nand during the Review Conference, brought into sharp \r\nfocus the relationship between the Court and the \r\nSecurity Council. It is unnecessary to rehash the debate \r\non whether the Council’s mandate in the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security is primary or \r\nexclusive; surely we all know it is the former. Many of \r\nus expressed serious concern about leaving the \r\ndetermination of the crime of aggression in the \r\nexclusive hands of the Security Council. \r\n While the legally complex outcome of \r\nKampala — which provides for the possibility of \r\nopting out and delays the exercise of jurisdiction — is \r\nless than what we would have liked, my delegation is \r\nnevertheless pleased that we were able to reach a \r\ncompromise outcome by consensus. We trust that the \r\nrequired number of ratifications and a positive decision \r\nby the Assembly of States Parties in 2017 on the \r\nexercise of jurisdiction by the Court over the crime of \r\naggression will allow the operationalization of the \r\ndefinition in seven years’ time. \r\n As we end our statement, we wish to say a special \r\nword of gratitude to the President of the Assembly of \r\nStates Parties, Ambassador Wenaweser, who will be \r\npresiding over the Assembly for the last time in \r\nDecember. We thank him for his tireless efforts in \r\nsometimes difficult situations. \r\n In conclusion, the International Criminal Court is \r\nan institution designed to create a better world. We will \r\ncontinue to support the Court, so that it can grow from \r\nstrength to strength. \r\n Mr. Ileka (Democratic Republic of the Congo) \r\n(spoke in French): My delegation has taken note of the \r\nsixth annual report of the International Criminal Court \r\n(ICC) to the United Nations (see A/65/313), presented \r\nby the President of the Court, Judge Sang-Hyun Song. \r\n To begin with, we would like to concur fully with \r\nthe statement made yesterday by the representative of \r\nZambia, who spoke on behalf of the African States \r\nparties to the International Criminal Court. \r\n The situation in the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo was voluntarily referred to the Court by our \r\nauthorities, acting on behalf of populations in our \r\ncountry, which has been stricken by what some have \r\nrightly called the first African world war. The \r\nInternational Criminal Court was created, in fact, to \r\ntake on those types of situations. That is why the \r\nfoundation of the Rome Statute, based on what to some \r\nis a simple theory, is a reality that the peoples of the \r\nCongo, particularly those of North and South Kivu and \r\nthe district of Ituri, are living every day. \r\n Wars — and all forms of violence that negate the \r\ndignity and sacred nature of human beings — have no \r\nnationality. That reality, which some wish to confine to \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo in order to \r\nescape their own obligations and responsibilities, is \r\nintolerable and unacceptable. It concerns us all, and \r\ncooperation with the Court must be the foundation for \r\nour action. Regarding cooperation — and we will never \r\ncease pointing this out — the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo was the very first State party to develop \r\nsignificant cooperation with the Court. Our country’s \r\nefforts in that area are unquestionably a model of \r\ncooperation with the Court, and several legal \r\ndocuments testify to that fact. \r\n First, the Democratic Republic of the Congo did \r\nnot wait for the Rome Statute to enter into force before \r\nratifying it. We ratified it on 30 March 2002, more than \r\nthree months before its entry into force. Secondly, my \r\ncountry proactively referred its situation to the Court \r\nas of 3 March 2004, signed an agreement on judicial \r\ncooperation with the Court on 6 October 2004, and \r\nconcluded an agreement on judicial assistance with the \r\nthen United Nations Organization Mission in the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and the Court. \r\nThirdly, on three occasions in connection with \r\nproceedings before the Court and at the request of the \r\nCourt, the Democratic Republic of the Congo executed \r\narrest warrants from the Court against its nationals. \r\n Clearly, the Democratic Republic of the Congo \r\nbelieves that peace and justice are complementary. We \r\nrecognize through our experience the irreplaceable role \r\nof justice as a factor in social harmony, national \r\nreconciliation, peace, security and stability. It was with \r\nthe help of justice that we were able to bring peace \r\nback to the districts of Katanga and North Katanga. It \r\nis with the help of justice that we intend to bring peace \r\nback to the entire country. In that regard, my \r\ndelegation welcomes the recent arrest in Paris, on an \r\nICC warrant, of the Executive Secretary of the Forces \r\ndémocratiques de libération du Rwanda (FDLR). \r\nMr. Calixte Mbarushimana will have to answer for war \r\ncrimes and crimes against humanity, including murder, \r\nrape, torture, persecution and destruction of property, \r\ncommitted in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in \r\n2009. \r\nA/65/PV.41  \r\n \r\n10-61179 22 \r\n \r\n The sixth annual report of the International \r\nCriminal Court to the United Nations, which we are \r\ndiscussing in this meeting, describes the very \r\nsignificant progress made in the work of the Court, \r\nwith the start of trials in some situations and the \r\nconfirmation of charges in others, as well as the \r\nopening of new investigations. In that regard, my \r\ndelegation would like to take this opportunity to recall \r\nits interest in seeing the proposal for organizing trials \r\nin situ implemented. That would fulfil a long-held \r\ndesire to grant some moral satisfaction to the victims \r\nof the crimes and to deter potential recidivists. \r\n Such progress in the course of international \r\ncriminal justice is being achieved in the context of a \r\nstrong campaign of hostility against the Court. The \r\nCourt should set up mechanisms that can curb such \r\ncampaigns, which risk undermining the Court’s \r\nreputation and compromising its achievements, despite \r\nthe fact that more than half the Member States of the \r\nOrganization are now parties to the Court, less than \r\nfive years after its entry into effect. It is just as \r\nimportant, however, that the Court consider its own \r\noperations, reflect on how it works and become more \r\nprofessional and less political. Politics and justice do \r\nnot necessarily go well together. As a final note to this \r\npart of my statement, my delegation would like to \r\nwelcome to the club of States parties to the Court its \r\nmost recent members, namely, Bangladesh, Saint \r\nLucia, Seychelles and Moldova, which bring the \r\nnumber of States parties to 114. \r\n The Review Conference held in Kampala in May \r\nand June was a valuable opportunity for Member States \r\nto confirm the achievements of Rome and to strengthen \r\nthe belief that the Court is a gift of hope for future \r\ngenerations and an important step forward for respect \r\nfor human rights and the rule of law. The Kampala \r\nDeclaration, in which States reaffirmed their \r\nwillingness to promote the Rome Statute and its full \r\nimplementation, as well as its universal nature; the \r\nstocktaking of international criminal justice at \r\nKampala; and the modifications to the Statute, which \r\nnow includes a definition of the crime of aggression \r\nand the conditions under which the Court may exercise \r\njurisdiction over that crime, are all achievements that \r\nwe should guard jealously. \r\n In conclusion, and to reiterate my delegation’s \r\nwillingness to watch over the respect for the integrity \r\nof the Statute of the Court, I would like once again to \r\ncall on those delegations that have not yet done so to \r\nbecome States parties to the Court, so that together we \r\nmay contribute to the universality of the fight against \r\nimpunity. \r\n Mr. Muhumuza (Uganda): I join other speakers \r\nbefore me in expressing my delegation’s condolences \r\nto the Governments of Barbados and Argentina during \r\nthis time of great loss to their nations. \r\n Uganda is humbled by the words of gratitude \r\nexpressed by various delegations concerning our \r\nhosting of the first Review Conference of the Rome \r\nStatute from 31 May to 11 June. \r\n To begin with, I associate my delegation with the \r\nstatement delivered by the Permanent Representative \r\nof Zambia on behalf of the African States parties to the \r\nRome Statute of the International Criminal Court. \r\n We thank the President of the International \r\nCriminal Court for his report (see A/65/313). Uganda \r\nreiterates its commitment to the Court and the fight \r\nagainst impunity, which it showed in making the first \r\nState referral and, more recently, by hosting the first \r\nReview Conference of the Rome Statute. At the \r\nConference, States parties reviewed and amended the \r\nStatute, conducted a stocktaking of international \r\ncriminal justice and made significant pledges on a wide \r\nrange of issues. \r\n Kampala was indeed a continuation of the legacy \r\nof Rome in the pursuit of a more humane world. \r\nHolding the Conference there offered an opportunity to \r\nmany victims from the region to interface with the \r\nother stakeholders in the fight against impunity. The \r\nadoption of the Kampala Declaration reaffirms our \r\ncommitment to the Rome Statute and its full \r\nimplementation, as well as its universality and \r\nintegrity. We remain particularly concerned, however, \r\nthat Joseph Kony and the Lord’s Resistance Army \r\ncontinue to cause untold suffering to defenceless \r\nwomen and children, in spite of the indictment. \r\n The Court is steadily marching on the road to \r\nuniversality. Accordingly, we welcome the new \r\nmembers — Seychelles, Saint Lucia and Moldova — \r\nwhose ratification of the Rome Statute has brought the \r\ntotal membership to 114. We call upon other States that \r\nhave not yet done so to consider ratifying the Rome \r\nStatute. Universal ratification will send a clear message \r\nthat there is no room for impunity for anyone, \r\nanywhere. \r\n A/65/PV.41\r\n \r\n23 10-61179 \r\n \r\n We recognize that the Court relies on the \r\ncooperation of States, international organizations and \r\ncivil society to carry out its functions, in accordance \r\nwith the Rome Statute and international agreements \r\nconcluded by the Court. We therefore call on all States \r\nto offer the necessary cooperation so as to enable the \r\nCourt to carry out its mandate without reserve. \r\n Finally, unlike traditional jurisdictions, the Rome \r\nStatute recognizes and allows victims to participate \r\nactively in the proceedings, with the possibility of \r\ncompensation for the harm inflicted. We therefore \r\nencourage the Court, in its recruitment of staff, to take \r\ninto account the cultural peculiarities of victims and \r\nwitnesses who are required to be in The Hague to \r\nparticipate in Court proceedings. We believe that the \r\nfurtherance of justice calls for appropriate attention to \r\nthat important matter. \r\n Mr. Al Habib (Islamic Republic of Iran): The \r\ndelegation of the Islamic Republic of Iran expresses its \r\nappreciation to the President of the International \r\nCriminal Court for submitting the sixth report of the \r\nCourt, contained in document A/65/313. The report is \r\nunique in the sense that it contains the outcome of the \r\nfirst Review Conference of the Rome Statute of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court, held from 31 May to \r\n11 June in Kampala. \r\n The Review Conference managed to reach \r\nagreement on the definition of the crime of aggression. \r\nThat is a breakthrough in many respects and offers \r\nhope that the most serious crimes of international \r\nconcern will not go unpunished. While we rejoiced in \r\nseeing that long-overdue desire to criminalize \r\naggression bear fruit, we cannot help expressing our \r\ndissatisfaction at the fact that the outcome of the \r\nConference was far from the expectation, especially \r\nsince the implementation of the most promising clauses \r\nwas postponed for at least seven years. \r\n The Islamic Republic of Iran reiterates its \r\nposition that any act of aggression is of a grave nature, \r\nirrespective of its consequences, and constitutes an \r\ninternational crime. That finding cannot be affected by \r\nso-called understandings. Nor can we invoke resolution \r\n3314 (XXIX), on the definition of aggression, to \r\ndistinguish between acts of aggression, by their \r\nconsequences. \r\n In the view of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the \r\ninclusion of a clear reference to the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations left no doubt that any use of armed \r\nforce by a State in cases other than those stated in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, namely, the use of \r\narmed force in self-defence if a State is the victim of \r\nan armed attack and the use of armed force when \r\nauthorized by the Security Council under Chapter VII \r\nof the Charter, is unlawful and should be qualified as a \r\ncrime of aggression under resolution 3314 (XXIX). \r\n As a victim of an all-out act of aggression, the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran attaches the utmost \r\nimportance to the process of defining the crime of \r\naggression and including it in the Rome Statute of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. We are delighted to have \r\nactively engaged in the process, as a result of which \r\nthe International Criminal Court now has the necessary \r\nlegal jurisdiction to prosecute the perpetrators of the \r\nmost serious crimes of international concern. However, \r\nthe mission will not be accomplished until and unless \r\nwe make sure that the conditions for exercising such \r\njurisdiction are met. We look forward to see that vision \r\ncome true in 2017, and we stand ready to cooperate \r\nconstructively with others in that direction. \r\n Also, while regretting that the Review \r\nConference had no chance to work towards \r\ncriminalizing the use of weapons of mass destruction, \r\nparticularly the use of nuclear weapons as the most \r\ndestructive and inhumane weapons, the delegation of \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran hopes that that key issue \r\nwill be kept high on the agenda of the next Review \r\nConference. \r\n My delegation takes note of paragraphs 81 to 85 \r\nof the report, concerning developments in connection \r\nwith the possible exercise of jurisdiction by the Court \r\nover the international crimes committed in the \r\nPalestinian territories by the Israeli regime. While we \r\nunderstand that the Court is still examining the \r\njurisdictional question, we hope that such important \r\ntechnicalities will, in the end, lead to justice through \r\nthe prosecution of the perpetrators of the gravest \r\ncrimes of international concern. \r\n The declaration filed by Palestine with the \r\nRegistrar of the Court on 22 January 2009, pursuant to \r\narticle 12, paragraph 3, of the Statute, provides \r\njurisdiction to the Court with respect to the crimes \r\ncommitted on the territory of Palestine since 1 July \r\n2002. It is expected that the Prosecutor will interpret \r\nA/65/PV.41  \r\n \r\n10-61179 24 \r\n \r\narticle 12 of the Statute in such a manner that the main \r\npurpose of the Court, namely, ending impunity for the \r\nperpetrators of the most serious crimes of concern to \r\nthe international community, will be realized. \r\n For its part, the International Criminal Court \r\nshould be faithful to its Statute and general \r\ninternational law. That having been said, the Court \r\ncannot ignore international rules relating to the \r\nimmunity of State officials, as recognized under article \r\n98 of the Rome Statute. Likewise, the referral of cases \r\nto the Court should not be based on political \r\nmotivation or selectivity. The Court should cautiously \r\ntake into account the consequences that its decisions \r\nmight have on the advancement of peace and stability \r\nin such cases. \r\n In that respect, I draw the Assembly’s attention to \r\nthe concerns raised by the African Union, the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement and the Organization of the \r\nIslamic Conference, as well as many other countries, \r\nconcerning the recent decisions of the Court on the \r\nDarfur situation. \r\n Mr. Touray (Sierra Leone): We join other \r\ndelegations in expressing our sincere condolences and \r\nsympathies to the Governments and people of \r\nBarbados and Argentina as they mourn the loss of their \r\nesteemed and dear departed leaders. \r\n At the outset, allow me to express my thanks and \r\nthe appreciation of my delegation to the President of \r\nthe Assembly for convening this debate on the report of \r\nthe International Criminal Court contained in document \r\nA/65/313 and to the President of the International \r\nCriminal Court, Judge Sang-Hyun Song, for presenting \r\nthe comprehensive report of the Court. My delegation \r\naligns itself with the statement delivered by the \r\nPermanent Representative of Zambia on behalf of the \r\nAfrican States parties to the International Criminal \r\nCourt and would like to make a few comments from a \r\nnational perspective. \r\n Sierra Leone welcomes the annual report of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court and the significant \r\njudicial progress made by the Court. My delegation \r\nalso congratulates the Government of Uganda, the \r\nBureau of the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome \r\nStatute, States parties and other States, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, civil society organizations \r\nand all those who in diverse ways contributed \r\nimmensely to the successful outcome of the Review \r\nConference of the Rome Statute held in Kampala from \r\n31 May to 11 June. The historic achievements made in \r\nUganda, including the adoption of the definition of the \r\ncrime of aggression and the conditions for the exercise \r\nof jurisdiction regarding such crimes, form a major \r\nmilestone in the development of international criminal \r\njustice. \r\n The universality of the Rome Statute is critical in \r\nthe fight against impunity. In that vein, my delegation \r\nwelcomes the ratification of the Rome Statute by \r\nSeychelles, Bangladesh, Saint Lucia and the Republic \r\nof Moldova. We encourage States that are not parties to \r\nconsider becoming members of the Rome Statute. As is \r\nthe case for other international courts and tribunals — \r\nsuch as the International Criminal Tribunal for \r\nRwanda, the International Criminal Tribunal for the \r\nformer Yugoslavia and the Special Court for Sierra \r\nLeone — cooperation continues to be the main \r\nchallenge facing the International Criminal Court. With \r\nregard to the diversity in the situations of the various \r\ncourts in terms of mandate, local situations, political \r\nwill and methods of funding, to mention a few areas \r\napplicable to each of those ad hoc tribunals, specific \r\nlessons learned in terms of cooperation as experienced \r\nin each case could be of tremendous significance to the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. We therefore underline \r\nthe need for each and every State to do everything \r\nwithin its power to cooperate with and provide support \r\nfor the Court in the implementation of its judicial \r\nmandate. We should always remember that the Court’s \r\npotential for deterrence lies mainly in the likelihood of \r\nthe threat of prosecution being carried out. Any \r\ndilution of that threat makes the worldwide fight \r\nagainst impunity and the role of the Court within that \r\nprocess much more difficult and the risk of failure \r\ngreater. \r\n As we all know, the International Criminal Court \r\ndoes not have the advantage of being focused only on \r\none situation. It operates in situations that can be \r\nvolatile and where the security situation can vary from \r\nday to day. It operates in situations where there are \r\ndifficulties in spreading information and where the \r\ninfrastructure is usually challenging at best. We know \r\nthat type of situation very well; not so long ago that \r\nwas the situation facing my country. Just one decade \r\nago we were in a state of crisis, but as of now we have \r\npeace, we have justice and we have a functioning \r\ndemocratic system. Many challenges await us, but we \r\nare in a good position to meet those challenges. One \r\nreason for our success is that we faced the need for \r\n A/65/PV.41\r\n \r\n25 10-61179 \r\n \r\naccountability head-on and took steps to address that \r\nneed. \r\n Of course, the Special Court for Sierra Leone \r\ncannot and does not claim sole responsibility for our \r\nchange of fortune. That credit may be claimed by the \r\ngood men and women of Sierra Leone and the existing \r\npolitical will backed by the support and assistance of \r\nthe international community and our good bilateral \r\npartners. Nevertheless, the Special Court has in its own \r\nway made an important contribution to the restoration \r\nof the rule of law, which has helped us to move \r\nforward. It has done so by being present in the \r\neveryday life of our country, by not interfering in \r\npolitics or internal matters and by being there and \r\nmaking an effort to be known and understood and to \r\nengage with all Sierra Leoneans. Here we want to \r\nreaffirm and acknowledge the support and cooperation \r\nof the international community, the people of Sierra \r\nLeone and civil society organizations. \r\n In the area of complementarity, we recognized the \r\nfact that the role of national jurisdictions is crucial in \r\nthe prosecution of the perpetrators of war crimes, \r\ncrimes against humanity and genocide. Because of that, \r\nour Government has drafted a bill for the \r\ndomestication of the Rome Statute and is currently \r\ncollaborating with the Special Court for Sierra Leone \r\non the establishment of a witness and victim support \r\nunit within the national judiciary. Thus, all actions and \r\nactivities through potential partner countries aimed at \r\nsupporting national jurisdictions in meeting their \r\nobligations under the Rome Statute — including \r\nrelated activities, like those of the Rule of Law Unit of \r\nthe United Nations, aimed at strengthening the rule of \r\nlaw and domestic systems — are pivotal in the fight \r\nagainst impunity. \r\n Justice must be protected, as justice is a critical \r\ncomponent of peace. Without justice, there can be no \r\npeace, and without peace the lives of hundreds of \r\nthousands of people are put in jeopardy, right now and \r\nfor future generations. We must not allow a weakening \r\nof international criminal justice processes; we must, \r\ninstead, support them, promote them, protect them and \r\ndefend them. This is the only way forward to lasting \r\npeace and a prosperous future for all. \r\n To conclude, my delegation reiterates its support \r\nfor the Court as a key element in the restoration of \r\npeace and international rule of law. To maximize its \r\npotential, we must continue our efforts towards the \r\nuniversal ratification and implementation of the Rome \r\nStatute, we must provide the Court with clear and \r\nsteady cooperation and, above all, we must assist the \r\nCourt by providing it with clear guidance and \r\nconstructive support. We recognize the fact that \r\ncapacity-building is the key to the realization of that \r\nobjective. \r\n Mr. Morejón (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish): The \r\ndelegation of Ecuador is pleased, Sir, to see you \r\npresiding and with the way you are conducting this \r\nportion of the debate. \r\n The delegation of Ecuador has taken due note of \r\nthe report by the President of the International \r\nCriminal Court, Judge Sang-Hyun Song, contained in \r\ndocument A/65/313, and we thank him. \r\n Ecuador is happy to note an increase in the \r\nnumber of States parties to the Rome Statute, with the \r\naccession of four new States, Bangladesh, Seychelles, \r\nSaint Lucia and the Republic of Moldova. The current \r\ntotal of 114 States parties to the Statute confirms the \r\ntrend within the international community to take \r\ndecisive action to counter impunity. \r\n Ecuador attended and actively participated in the \r\nReview Conference of the Rome Statute that took place \r\nin May and June 2010 in Kampala. We take this \r\nopportunity to reiterate to the people and Government \r\nof Uganda our thanks for the hospitality that we \r\nenjoyed during the Review Conference. The subjects \r\ndiscussed during the Conference are of critical \r\nimportance, and support for the objectives of that \r\nhistoric event will ensure that progress is made in fine-\r\ntuning the international criminal justice system. \r\n In Ecuador’s view, the principle of combating \r\nimpunity is of absolute importance; it is even written \r\ninto Ecuadorian law. Indeed, my country’s Constitution \r\nitself states in article 80 that no statute of limitations \r\nshall apply to crimes of genocide, crimes against \r\nhumanity, war crimes and crimes of aggression. \r\nEcuador opposed article 124 of the Statute, because we \r\ncannot condone the inclusion of a measure that might \r\nopen the way to impunity for a given State perpetrating \r\none of the crimes identified in Ecuador’s Constitution. \r\n Along those lines, when it comes to taking stock \r\nof international criminal justice, and specifically on the \r\ntheme of peace and justice, we must remain realistic. \r\nAlthough the International Criminal Court has not \r\nexisted for very long, experience has shown us that \r\nA/65/PV.41  \r\n \r\n10-61179 26 \r\n \r\nimpunity cannot be accepted, even in the interests of \r\npeace, and that undertakings like truth and \r\nreconciliation commissions will only be effective if \r\nthey go hand in hand with punishment of the guilty. \r\n We would like to echo what was said by the \r\nrepresentative of Argentina, namely, that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral must be urged to submit to States parties the \r\namendments adopted in the Kampala Review \r\nConference and to urge those States to ratify them as \r\nsoon as possible. \r\n In any case and to conclude, Ecuador, as an active \r\nmember of the Rome Statute, reiterates its support for \r\nthe International Criminal Court. We agree with the \r\nPresident of the Court, Judge Sang-Hyun Song, that the \r\nReview Conference provided an impetus to disseminate \r\nand strengthen the influence of the Rome Statute in \r\nnational jurisdictions. Furthermore, we agree that the \r\nUnited Nations is the only forum in which to carry that \r\nprocess forward. \r\n Mr. Nickels (United States of America): We wish \r\nto join others who have expressed condolences to the \r\npeople of Barbados on the death of Prime Minister \r\nDavid John Howard Thompson. We also wish to \r\nexpress our condolences to the people of Argentina on \r\nthe death of former President Néstor Kirchner. \r\n We would also like to thank President Song for \r\nhis report contained in document A/65/313 and for his \r\nservice to the International Criminal Court (ICC). \r\nAlthough the United States is not a party to the Rome \r\nStatute, we too have an abiding interest in seeing the \r\nCourt successfully complete the prosecutions it has \r\nbegun. As President Obama’s national security strategy \r\nstates, “the end of impunity and the promotion of \r\njustice are not just moral imperatives; they are \r\nstabilizing forces in international affairs”. \r\n The United States remains steadfastly committed \r\nto promoting the rule of law and to helping to bring \r\nviolators of international humanitarian law to justice, \r\nand will continue to play a leadership role in righting \r\nwrongs of that type. As we have emphasized, we \r\ncannot ignore the terrible crimes that have been \r\nperpetrated, wherever they might have occured, and the \r\nmassive human suffering that the world has witnessed. \r\nThe International Criminal Court plays a key role in \r\nbringing perpetrators of the worst atrocities to justice. \r\n The United States was pleased to participate as an \r\nobserver at the Review Conference of the Rome Statute \r\nin Kampala and at the meetings of the Assembly of \r\nStates Parties in The Hague and New York that \r\npreceded it. We sent a large observer delegation to \r\nKampala and participated actively in the stocktaking \r\nexercise, in the many important and stimulating side \r\nevents and in the substantive discussions of \r\namendments to the Rome Statute. The United States \r\nGovernment co-sponsored a side event on positive \r\ncomplementarity in the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo, which has provided an important foundation \r\nfor our work on the issue since Kampala. Moreover, we \r\nwere the only non-party State to make pledges. We \r\nhope that our active and principled engagement has \r\nhelped to enhance the discussions and to improve the \r\noutcomes of Kampala, including the outcome regarding \r\nthe crime of aggression. \r\n We recognize that the amendments adopted at \r\nKampala were a compromise that few if any \r\ndelegations consider perfect. My delegation’s concerns, \r\nin particular about the possibility of investigations and \r\nprosecutions under article 15 bis, in cases where the \r\nSecurity Council has not determined that an act of \r\naggression has occurred, are well known. We believe \r\nthat it was wise for the States parties to subject the \r\nexercise of ICC jurisdiction under that provision to a \r\ndecision to be taken after 1 January 2017. That will \r\nprovide breathing space in which measures that require \r\nattention can be considered and in which progress on \r\nother issues facing the international community — the \r\neffort to ensure accountability for perpetrators of war \r\ncrimes, crimes against humanity and genocide — can \r\nbe consolidated. \r\n We note that the resolutions under which both the \r\naggression amendments and the amendments under the \r\nso-called Belgian amendment were adopted in \r\nKampala state that the amendments are subject to \r\nratification or acceptance and shall enter into force in \r\naccordance with article 121, paragraph 5, of the Rome \r\nStatute. As such, the provisions do not provide \r\nauthority for the Court to exercise jurisdiction \r\nregarding those crimes when committed by the \r\nnationals of a State that does not ratify them or on the \r\nterritory of such a State. \r\n In conclusion, the United States would like to \r\nagain extend our thanks to the States parties to the \r\nRome Statute for the gracious way that our \r\nparticipation has been received over the past year after \r\nsuch a long absence from the Assembly of States \r\nParties meetings. We would also in particular like to \r\n A/65/PV.41\r\n \r\n27 10-61179 \r\n \r\nthank the Government of Uganda for its warm \r\nhospitality at the Review Conference. \r\n We look forward to continued engagement with \r\nthe States parties to the Rome Statute. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker on agenda item 73, entitled “Report of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court”. \r\n I would like to once again welcome the new \r\naccessions to the International Criminal Court, namely, \r\nSaint Lucia, the Republic of Moldova,  \r\n \r\nBangladesh and Seychelles. Allow me also to express \r\nsympathy and extend condolences to the Government \r\nand people of Barbados on the passing of their Prime \r\nMinister, Mr. David Thompson. I would also like to \r\nexpress sympathy and extend condolences to the \r\nGovernment and people of Argentina on the passing of \r\nformer President Néstor Kirchner. \r\n The General Assembly has thus concluded this \r\nstage of its consideration of agenda item 73. \r\n  The meeting rose at 6.10 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
