(Switzerland) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 63 \r\n \r\nReport of the Human Rights Council \r\n \r\n  Report of the Human Rights Council (A/65/53 \r\nand Corr.1 and A/65/53/Add.1) \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): In connection \r\nwith this item, I recall that the General Assembly, at its \r\n2nd plenary meeting, on 17 September, decided to \r\nconsider agenda item 63 in plenary meeting and in the \r\nThird Committee on the understanding that, inter alia, \r\nthe Assembly in plenary meeting would consider the \r\nannual report of the Human Rights Council on its \r\nactivities for the year. \r\n Our discussion today is devoted to the work of \r\nthe Human Rights Council during its latest cycle. I am \r\npleased to welcome among us the President of the \r\nHuman Rights Council, His Excellency Ambassador \r\nSihasak Phuangketkeow, who will introduce the annual \r\nreport of the Human Rights Council (A/65/53). \r\n The documents before us today, which I just \r\ncited, deal with a very large number of questions \r\nrelating to a theme or a situation specific to a country \r\nand thus reflect the diversity and richness of the \r\nCouncil’s work and discussions. The report also \r\ncontains the decisions on the outcome of the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review for more than 60 countries. \r\n It is noteworthy that most of those resolutions \r\nand decisions were adopted by consensus. In that \r\nconnection, I wish to thank Ambassador \r\nPhuangketkeow and his predecessor, Ambassador Alex \r\nVan Meeuwen, for presiding over the Council and for \r\ntheir key role in creating a constructive atmosphere and \r\nensuring that the work proceeded smoothly. \r\n Before opening the discussion, I would like to \r\nmake two observations. \r\n First, the substantial report that we will discuss \r\ntoday stresses the importance of human rights as a third \r\npillar of the mission of the United Nations, alongside \r\nthe promotion of peace and security, and development. \r\nThose pillars are inseparable and mutually reinforcing, \r\nand it is therefore essential that progress be made in all \r\nthose areas. In that connection, the creation of the \r\nHuman Rights Council, now five years ago, was \r\ninstrumental in promoting and protecting human rights \r\nfor all, without distinction of any kind and in a fair and \r\nequitable manner, and in mainstreaming an awareness \r\nof human rights into the United Nations system. \r\n While recognizing that vital contribution — and \r\nthis is my second observation — it is now important to \r\nreview the work and functioning of the Council, in line \r\nwith Assembly resolution 60/251. This review must be \r\ncarried out bearing in mind the Council’s mandate to \r\npromote and protect human rights, with a view to \r\nfurther improving the functioning of the Council and \r\nmaking the appropriate practical adjustments. It is my \r\nintention to complete this process during the \r\nAssembly’s sixty-fifth session. That will require \r\neffective collaboration between Geneva and New York, \r\nand I am pleased with the commitments undertaken in \r\nthat regard. \r\nA/65/PV.42  \r\n \r\n10-61802 2 \r\n \r\n I hope that our discussion today will make a \r\nconstructive contribution to the promotion of human \r\nrights and fulfilment of the mandate of the Human \r\nRights Council. \r\n I give the floor to the representative of Thailand, \r\nwho is also the President of the Human Rights Council. \r\n Mr. Phuangketkeow (Thailand): It is a great \r\nhonour and privilege for me to come before the \r\nAssembly today. Before going into my presentation, \r\nallow me to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your \r\nelection and to express my best wishes for a successful \r\ntenure. \r\n Following the practice of my predecessors, today \r\nI will be presenting the annual report of the Human \r\nRights Council to the General Assembly, in accordance \r\nwith Assembly resolution 60/251. \r\n But as the Assembly may already know, the \r\nHuman Rights Council is undergoing a very important \r\nexercise this year, which is the review of its work, \r\nfunctioning and status, as mandated by resolution \r\n60/251. Therefore, my presentation today will also \r\ntouch upon the review of the Council. Particularly, I \r\nshould like to share with the Assembly the progress \r\nmade at the first intergovernmental working group on \r\nthe review of the work and functioning of the Human \r\nRights Council, which took place in Geneva last week. \r\nOnce our process in Geneva has been completed — no \r\nlater than June next year — it will feed into a separate \r\nyet complementary process of review of the Council’s \r\nstatus by the General Assembly. \r\n The report presented to the Assembly today \r\ncovers the Council’s fourth cycle, from the September \r\n2009 session to the June 2010 session, under the \r\npresidency of my predecessor, Ambassador Alex Van \r\nMeeuwen, Permanent Representative of Belgium, as \r\nwell as the addendum covering the most recent session, \r\nin September, under my presidency. \r\n During the reporting period, the Council fulfilled \r\nits mandate to advance the promotion and protection of \r\nhuman rights through various means. \r\n First, through the Universal Periodic Review, the \r\nCouncil has now reviewed the human rights situation \r\nin 127 countries — two thirds of the Member States. I \r\ncan proudly report that the Council has secured a 100 \r\nper cent participation of States under review thus far. \r\nThe Universal Periodic Review continues to be seen — \r\nI believe rightly so — as one of the Council’s most \r\nmeaningful innovations. Grounded on the principles of \r\nuniversality, equality, constructive dialogue and \r\ncooperation, that mechanism has been successful in \r\ncreating positive synergies in efforts to improve the \r\nhuman rights situation on the ground. \r\n Starting from the national level, the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review has brought government and civil \r\nsociety together to assess and find ways to improve the \r\nhuman rights situation within the country. The level of \r\nawareness and efforts to promote and protect human \r\nrights have been significantly increased. That includes \r\nimmediate improvements in national policies and \r\nlegislation and pledges to bring those in line with the \r\nState’s international obligations, ratification of \r\nadditional human rights treaties, submission of reports \r\nto treaty bodies, and increased cooperation with special \r\nprocedures. \r\n Secondly, in the area of standard-setting, the \r\nCouncil advanced its normative work on a number of \r\nimportant thematic issues. Here I would like to \r\nmention that, complementing the overall United \r\nNations efforts to enhance the rights and welfare of \r\nwomen, the Council discussed a number of issues \r\nrelating to women’s human rights, including maternal \r\nmortality and morbidity, the linkage between the right \r\nto education and the empowerment of women and girls, \r\nthe elimination of discrimination against women in law \r\nand in practice, and integration of the gender \r\nperspective into the Council’s work. In the most recent \r\nsession, in September, the Council also decided to \r\nestablish a working group of five experts from \r\ndifferent social, cultural and religious backgrounds to \r\nwork on the issue of eliminating discrimination against \r\nwomen. \r\n Furthermore, the Council gave a clear sign of its \r\ncommitment to strengthen the rights of the child by \r\nholding an annual full-day discussion on sexual \r\nviolence against children. The Council also extended \r\nthe mandate of the Working Group to draft an optional \r\nprotocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, \r\nthereby aiming at establishing a complaint procedure \r\nfor this particularly important right. \r\n Other thematic issues discussed by the Council \r\nthat I wish to highlight include timely discussion of the \r\nimpact of the global economic and financial crises on \r\nhuman rights, the human rights of persons with \r\ndisabilities, human rights education and training, the \r\nright to the truth, the protection of journalists in \r\n A/65/PV.42\r\n \r\n3 10-61802 \r\n \r\nsituations of armed conflict, and the adverse effects of \r\ntoxic waste on human rights. All in all, a total of 100 \r\nresolutions, 72 decisions and 3 presidential statements \r\nhave been adopted in this reporting period. \r\n The Council has also increasingly resorted to \r\npanel discussions as an innovative format for the \r\nexchange of views and expertise on important human \r\nrights issues. Those discussions benefited from a wide \r\nrange of human rights expertise, including from its \r\nspecial procedures, Advisory Committee and other \r\nsubsidiary bodies, treaty bodies, experts, United \r\nNations specialized agencies, national human rights \r\ninstitutions and civil society. The Council also \r\nbenefited from hearing at first-hand the experience of \r\nvictims of trafficking during a panel discussion in its \r\nJune session. \r\n It is indeed particularly enriching when the \r\nCouncil, in dealing with important situations and \r\nissues, can avail itself of the different sources of \r\nhuman rights expertise and information at its disposal. \r\nI take this opportunity also to acknowledge the \r\ncontinued engagement of non-governmental organizations, \r\nwith an average of 200 organizations present at each \r\nsession that often contribute to the Council’s \r\ndeliberations with first-hand information and critical \r\nanalysis. \r\n Over the reporting period, the Council was seized \r\nwith a number of pressing human rights situations that \r\noccurred in various parts of the world. \r\n Striving for a constructive approach to dealing \r\nwith country situations, the Council has creatively \r\nutilized the features and avenues provided for in its \r\nresolution 5/1. In addition to continued engagement \r\nwith country-specific special procedures and holding \r\nspecial sessions, the Council also resorted to in-session \r\nurgent debates, establishment of independent fact-\r\nfinding missions, and adoption of presidential \r\nstatements and declarations. \r\n A special session was held in January in support \r\nof the post-earthquake recovery process in Haiti. An \r\nurgent debate was held in June on the attack on the \r\nflotilla, followed in the September session by an \r\ninteractive dialogue with the international fact-finding \r\nmission on that case. During that same session, an \r\ninteractive dialogue was held with the Committee of \r\nindependent experts to monitor and assess any \r\ndomestic, legal or other proceedings undertaken by \r\nboth the Government of Israel and the Palestinian side, \r\nin light of Assembly resolution 64/254. An informative \r\nstand-alone interactive dialogue on Somalia, which \r\nsignificantly benefited from the extensive participation \r\nof a variety of international, regional and national \r\nstakeholders, was also held last September. \r\n Let me now turn to an important exercise \r\nundertaken by the Council, which is the review of its \r\nwork and functioning in accordance with Assembly \r\nresolution 60/251. \r\n The review process in Geneva started formally \r\nlast week with the holding of the first session of the \r\nopen-ended intergovernmental working group \r\nestablished for this purpose. This process, I believe, \r\npresents a valuable opportunity for us to assess and \r\nbuild on what we have achieved in the Council and \r\nmake improvements where we can to enhance the \r\neffectiveness of the Council in the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights for all. While the common \r\nview is that this exercise is a review and not a reform \r\nof the Council, we must nevertheless be able to \r\ngenerate meaningful results. We must not lose focus on \r\nwhat we aim to achieve. \r\n First, the Council should be able to make a real \r\nimpact on the ground, leading to the improvement of \r\nhuman rights for all peoples. Secondly, the Council \r\nshould do better in addressing chronic and urgent \r\nissues and situations involving serious violations of \r\nhuman rights in order to react more swiftly and \r\neffectively to such situations wherever they may occur. \r\nThirdly, we should be able to streamline the Council’s \r\nwork to ensure that our time and resources are used in \r\nthe most effective way to fulfil all the mandates given \r\nto the Council. \r\n The review also provides for a timely opportunity \r\nto address the relationship between the General \r\nAssembly and the Human Rights Council. In that \r\nregard, there is a need to better coordinate the work of \r\nthe Council with that of the Assembly, so as to enable \r\nthe Council to respond to all human rights issues, in \r\nparticular the urgent ones, with adequate financial and \r\npolitical backing from this Assembly. \r\n The current arrangements do not allow the \r\nAssembly to consider the Council’s decisions and \r\nrecommendations until the end of the year. That has \r\nnegative implications for both the Council and the \r\nwork of the Office of the High Commissioner. \r\nIncreasingly, newly established activities and mandates \r\nhave to be either postponed or supported by diverting \r\nA/65/PV.42  \r\n \r\n10-61802 4 \r\n \r\nresources on a temporary basis. This issue should be \r\nresolved in the context of the review of the Council \r\nthis year. \r\n As the Assembly knows, the Human Rights \r\nCouncil is now entering its fifth cycle. It is a \r\nchallenging cycle in many respects. We have to \r\nmaintain the pace and progress of the Council’s work. \r\nAt the same time, we have to embark on the review \r\nprocess of the Council that I have just mentioned. \r\n At the beginning of my presidency, I stated that I \r\nwould be guided by certain principles, which I shall \r\nrepeat here. First is the importance of taking a \r\nconstructive and cooperative approach to all human \r\nrights issues and situations. Second is to maintain and \r\nstrengthen the Council’s capacity in terms of making a \r\nreal difference on the ground and enhancing its \r\ncapacity to react to urgent human rights situations in an \r\neven-handed way. The third principle is to ensure that \r\nthe work of the Council provides for inclusiveness of \r\nall stakeholders whose role is recognized as \r\ninstrumental to advancing the cause of human rights. \r\n Before concluding, Mr. President, allow me to \r\nreiterate my personal commitment and that of the \r\nCouncil to support your leadership both in the General \r\nAssembly’s review of the Council’s status this year and \r\nin further advancing, session after session, towards the \r\nfull implementation of the noble objectives enshrined \r\nin the United Nations Charter. \r\n Mr. De Séllos (Brazil): Brazil welcomes the \r\nreport of the Human Rights Council (A/65/53) and \r\nthanks its President, Ambassador Sihasak \r\nPhuangketkeow, for the presentation of the latest \r\ndevelopments in Geneva. \r\n The report displays the vigorous activity of the \r\nHuman Rights Council in the past year. The four \r\nregular sessions and the special session reported upon \r\nproduced 100 resolutions, 72 decisions and \r\n3 presidential statements. Brazil notes with \r\nappreciation that 149 initiatives of the 172 approved by \r\nthe Council were adopted without a vote. Consensual \r\noutcomes represent 87 per cent of all proposals \r\npresented by Member States. It is therefore clear that in \r\nthe human rights agenda, what unites us is far greater \r\nthan what divides us. My delegation maintains that \r\nincreased dialogue and mutual understanding are \r\nfundamental to achieving an even greater convergence. \r\n As a State member of the Council, Brazil has \r\nconstantly worked with a view to achieving outcomes \r\nthat are both meaningful and acceptable to all. In the \r\nreporting period, my Government presented six draft \r\nresolutions and one draft decision, all of which were \r\nadopted without a vote, and usually with numerous \r\nsponsors. Those initiatives addressed several of the \r\nmost pressing human rights issues of our times: the \r\nimpact of the financial and economic crises on the \r\nenjoyment of all human rights; the right to access to \r\nmedicines; human rights in the context of HIV/AIDS; \r\nthe centrality of victims in addressing trafficking in \r\npersons; racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and \r\nrelated intolerance; support for the recovery process in \r\nHaiti after the January earthquake; and the extension of \r\nthe mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the right to \r\nhealth. \r\n My country has also engaged constructively with \r\nthe Universal Periodic Review mechanism, thus \r\ncontributing to its undeniable success. With a view to \r\navoiding selectivity and politicization, Brazil has made \r\nrecommendations to all countries reviewed during the \r\nperiod reported, with the exception of those cases in \r\nwhich we participated as part of the troika. \r\n My delegation notes with appreciation that more \r\nthan two thirds of all United Nations Member States \r\nhave already been reviewed under the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review process. The high level of cooperation \r\nenjoyed by that mechanism may have exceeded the \r\nmost optimistic forecasts. \r\n For all those reasons, Brazil’s assessment is that \r\nthe Human Rights Council is, overall, a success story. \r\nIt has largely fulfilled the great expectations raised \r\nwhen it was established by this Assembly a few years \r\nago. \r\n At the same time, the Council has the potential to \r\nbecome an even more effective instrument for the \r\npromotion and protection of all human rights. In that \r\nspirit, Brazil is fully committed to the ongoing review \r\nof the work and functioning and status of the Council. \r\n Among the necessary improvements, my country \r\nattaches great priority to increasing the Council’s \r\nability to provide cooperation and technical assistance. \r\nBrazil has proposed, for example, that the Council \r\nestablish strategies to implement the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review and special procedures \r\nrecommendations. \r\n A/65/PV.42\r\n \r\n5 10-61802 \r\n \r\n During this review of the status of the Human \r\nRights Council, Brazil would like to recall that human \r\nrights is the only pillar of the United Nations that is \r\nstill not represented by its own principal organ in the \r\nUnited Nations structure. My delegation considers the \r\nreview process to be an excellent opportunity to clarify \r\nand strengthen the relationship between the Human \r\nRights Council and the General Assembly. \r\n If the current status of the Council is to be \r\nmaintained, its reporting line should be directly to the \r\nplenary of the General Assembly. Such an approach \r\nwill avoid duplication of work and will help to ensure \r\nthe necessary financial resources for the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. \r\n Brazil commends the President of the Human \r\nRights Council for his transparent and constructive \r\nleadership throughout the review process. Thanks \r\nlargely to his work and ability to build confidence, the \r\nfirst intergovernmental working group on the review \r\nhas been successful. Brazil also acknowledges his \r\nfundamental role in ensuring close coordination \r\nGeneral Assembly facilitators. \r\n My delegation reiterates its support for the \r\nPresident of the Council. We trust his ability to help us \r\nin achieving a review that will improve the Council’s \r\ncapacity to make a difference on the ground. \r\n Mr. Grauls (Belgium): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the European Union (EU). The \r\ncandidate countries Croatia, the former Yugoslav \r\nRepublic of Macedonia and Iceland; the countries of \r\nthe Stabilization and Association Process and potential \r\ncandidates Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, \r\nMontenegro and Serbia; as well as Ukraine, the \r\nRepublic of Moldova, and Georgia align themselves \r\nwith this statement. \r\n The European Union thanks the President of the \r\nHuman Rights Council, Ambassador Sihasak \r\nPhuangketkeow, for presenting the Human Rights \r\nCouncil’s fifth annual report to the General Assembly. \r\n The members of the General Assembly agreed to \r\nthe establishment of the Human Rights Council in 2006 \r\nin a joint effort to strengthen the United Nations \r\nsystem in the field of human rights and make it more \r\neffective in systematically promoting and protecting all \r\nhuman rights for all. \r\n Serving as members of the Council entails \r\nimportant responsibilities. Resolution 60/251 (2006) \r\nprovides that “members elected to the Council shall \r\nuphold the highest standards in the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights” (para. 9). The resolution \r\nalso asks States seeking membership of the Council to \r\nformulate concrete, credible and measurable pledges to \r\npromote and protect human rights at the national and \r\ninternational levels. \r\n In that regard, the European Union encourages all \r\nStates to consider the Suggested Elements for \r\nVoluntary Pledges and Commitments by Candidates for \r\nElection to the Human Rights Council, prepared by the \r\nOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. \r\n All States should contribute to the \r\nimplementation of the Human Rights Council mandate, \r\nas agreed upon by the General Assembly in 2006. The \r\nmembers of the Council, however, have a particular \r\nresponsibility to victims of human rights violations and \r\nhuman rights defenders. They should lead by example \r\nin working to ensure the full implementation of the \r\nCouncil’s responsibilities. \r\n One of those responsibilities relates to the \r\npromotion of cooperation on human rights issues. \r\nUnder the period covered in the report, the Council has \r\ncontinued to serve as a forum for dialogue on a wide \r\nrange of thematic human rights issues and specific \r\nhuman rights situations. \r\n The Council has contributed to the further \r\ndevelopment and understanding of international norms \r\nand standards in the field of human rights. It has also \r\ncontinued to work to improve its record as regards its \r\nmandate to mainstream human rights into the overall \r\nUnited Nations system. \r\n In that regard, the European Union welcomes the \r\nholding of panel discussions that include \r\nrepresentatives from different strands of the United \r\nNations system, such as the discussions on the \r\nprotection of journalists in armed conflict, maternal \r\nmortality and morbidity or the recent stand-alone \r\ndialogue on the human rights situation in Somalia. The \r\nspecial session on a human rights approach to support \r\nthe recovery process in Haiti also serves as good \r\npractice as regards to human rights mainstreaming. \r\n Furthermore, the Council has a key responsibility \r\nto uphold the principle of the universality of human \r\nrights. In that context and recalling various discussions \r\nwithin the Council, the European Union wishes to \r\nreiterate that cultural values and traditions cannot ever \r\nA/65/PV.42  \r\n \r\n10-61802 6 \r\n \r\nbe invoked to undermine that principle. In addition, the \r\ndebate around religion can, under no circumstance, be \r\nallowed to undermine existing international human \r\nrights law. \r\n The Council is also mandated to monitor the \r\nimplementation of international human rights law and \r\nstandards. Only through objective monitoring and \r\nreporting can the Council identify the needs of victims \r\nand possible areas for capacity-building and technical \r\nassistance to States. \r\n The European Union shares the view that the \r\nspecial procedures play an irreplaceable role, if the \r\nCouncil is to monitor and address worrisome human \r\nrights events. It is crucial that mandate holders be able \r\nto independently assess and draw the Council’s \r\nattention to human rights issues and situations. The \r\nability of mandate holders to undertake country visits \r\nand establish direct contact with the relevant \r\ngovernment structures as well as other national and \r\nregional stakeholders is of crucial importance. \r\n All member States of the Union have extended \r\nand honoured standing invitations to the special \r\nprocedures and the European Union calls upon all \r\nUnited Nations members to do likewise. \r\n The European Union wishes, once again, to \r\nunderline the tireless efforts of the Office of the High \r\nCommissioner in providing, inter alia, support to the \r\nspecial procedures. In that respect, the European Union \r\nwishes to reiterate its firm support for the \r\nindependence of the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights and of her Office. \r\n The European Union welcomes the fact that, \r\nduring the reporting period under consideration, \r\nseveral special procedure mandates were prolonged \r\nand new ones were created. The European Union \r\nwelcomes the establishment of a new special \r\nrapporteur mandate on the freedoms of peaceful \r\nassembly and association, thus enhancing the Council’s \r\nattention in an area that had not been specifically \r\ncovered by the special procedures system. The creation \r\nof a credible, independent mechanism focusing on \r\ndiscrimination against women in law and in practice is \r\nalso a noteworthy achievement of the Council. \r\n During the period covered by the report, the \r\nCouncil extended the mandates on the situation of \r\nhuman rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea, on the situation of human rights in Myanmar \r\nand on the situation of human rights in Cambodia. The \r\nCouncil also renewed the mandates of the independent \r\nexpert on the situation of human rights in the Sudan, of \r\nthe independent expert on the situation of human rights \r\nin Somalia and of the independent expert on the human \r\nrights situation in Haiti. \r\n The Universal Periodic Review complements the \r\nspecial procedures and other human rights tools and \r\nmechanisms designed to monitor and address human \r\nrights situations. We welcome the consideration of \r\n48 States during the period under consideration. The \r\nEuropean Union regrets that some States have failed to \r\naddress all recommendations put forward or have given \r\nreplies that are not in line with the principles of \r\nobjectivity and non-politicization on which this process \r\nis based. The European Union encourages all States to \r\nfully cooperate with all relevant stakeholders in their \r\npreparation for the Review process and in the \r\nimplementation of recommendations resulting from \r\ntheir reviews by promoting consultations with national \r\nparliaments, national human rights institutions and \r\ncivil society representatives. \r\n The European Union highly values the role of \r\ncivil society organizations and national human rights \r\ninstitutions for their important contribution to the work \r\nof the Council. We hope that their cooperation with the \r\nCouncil will continue and develop further. \r\n It is the Human Rights Council’s responsibility to \r\naddress situations of violations of human rights, \r\nincluding gross and systematic violations, which \r\nrequire urgent action from the international \r\ncommunity. The credibility of the Council itself \r\ndepends to a large extent on whether it is able to \r\nrespond to such situations in a timely and adequate \r\nmanner. The European Union regrets that during the \r\nperiod under consideration, the Council remained silent \r\non many human rights situations while choosing to \r\nfocus on others. The mandate of the Council is not to \r\nprotect Governments from scrutiny but individuals \r\nfrom human rights violations. \r\n We believe that the Council should further \r\nimprove its ability to tackle urgent situations of gross \r\nhuman rights violations. That is one of the key issues \r\nto tackle in the 2011 review process of the Human \r\nRights Council, to which I want to dedicate some \r\nconcluding remarks. \r\n The 2011 review process provides a unique \r\nopportunity to make a first and thorough assessment of \r\n A/65/PV.42\r\n \r\n7 10-61802 \r\n \r\nthe Council’s ability to systematically implement all \r\naspects of its mandate. Based on that assessment, \r\nMember States should decide on concrete measures to \r\nimprove the Council’s work and functioning that will \r\nmake it more effective and credible. \r\n One aspect that should be addressed is the \r\nCouncil’s ability to promote international human rights \r\nlaw, its development and its implementation. The \r\nEuropean Union is of the view that the Council has \r\nfailed somewhat to systematically uphold and ensure \r\nthe implementation of existing international norms and \r\nstandards. All Member and observer States must \r\nuphold the universality, indivisibility, interrelatedness \r\nand interdependence of all human rights. \r\n The Council’s ability to monitor and address \r\nurgent and chronic human rights issues and situations \r\nwherever they occur is another aspect of the Council’s \r\nmandate that should be improved upon, as a result of \r\nthe 2011 review process. That aspect is essential in \r\norder to prevent new or further escalation of human \r\nrights violations. The European Union would like to \r\nsee the Human Rights Council play a more active role \r\nas an early warning and preventive mechanism. \r\n The modalities for interaction and dialogue, \r\nincluding on reports following country visits by special \r\nprocedures and the High Commissioner, should be \r\nimproved. Overall, the credibility and the effectiveness \r\nof the Council in that domain depend on the timely and \r\nobjective information the Council has at hand. It is \r\nimportant to strengthen the Council’s ability to \r\nconsider and integrate expert input into its work. At a \r\nminimum, the Council should preserve the integrity of \r\nthe mechanisms it has at its disposal to acquire \r\nobjective information. \r\n As the Periodic Review process moves into its \r\nsecond cycle, focus should shift to the implementation \r\nand follow-up of recommendations. A mere repetition \r\nof the first cycle would not be enough to make the \r\nprocess into a credible Council mechanism. The \r\ndiscussions during the 2011 review process should \r\nbuild on best practices and address the challenges at \r\nhand, including strengthening the role of expert input \r\nin the process and ensuring more attention for the \r\nadoption of the Universal Periodic Review reports and \r\nmore clarity with regard to the State’s position on the \r\nrecommendation put forward and/or the state of their \r\nimplementation. \r\n The Complaint Procedure is a unique victim-\r\noriented mechanism of the Council. Its universal \r\ncharacter makes it indispensable within the \r\ninternational human rights machinery. It complements \r\nexisting mechanisms in the treaty bodies system and at \r\nthe regional level. Given the very poor results obtained \r\nso far, the Complaint Procedure should be considerably \r\nstrengthened as a result of the 2011 review process. \r\n Finally, a key issue to be addressed during the \r\nreview process concerns the relationship between the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Human Rights Council. We \r\nneed to tackle a number of urgent issues. The very fact \r\nthat the President of the Human Rights Council sent an \r\naddendum to the regular report for consideration by the \r\nGeneral Assembly highlights that the reporting cycle \r\nhas to be improved. The budgetary implications of \r\naction taken by the Council also deserve the attention \r\nof the General Assembly. \r\n Last week, our colleagues in Geneva attended the \r\nfirst session of the Open-ended Intergovernmental \r\nWorking Group on the Review of the Work and \r\nFunctioning of the Human Rights Council. The \r\nEuropean Union is actively committed to that process \r\nand remains ready to engage with all States and \r\nstakeholders in a constructive dialogue. The European \r\nUnion welcomes the extension of the mandate of the \r\ntwo co-facilitators by you, Mr. President, and looks \r\nforward to discussions in New York, which will have to \r\nbe conducted in coherent coordination with the process \r\nin Geneva. As stated in the Joint Understanding, the \r\nreview process in New York should be finalized only \r\nafter the review process in Geneva is concluded. The \r\nEuropean Union shares the view that the two processes \r\nshould ultimately converge at the level of this General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Mr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): I would like to \r\nthank the President of the Human Rights Council for \r\nhis report to the General Assembly, which provides a \r\ncomprehensive overview of the work of the Council \r\nduring the last cycle with the addition of the recent \r\nSeptember session (A/65/53). We are grateful for this \r\nopportunity to reflect on the work of the Council \r\nduring that period. We are generally satisfied with the \r\nongoing Universal Periodic Review, in particular as its \r\nuniversality has been respected so far by all States. \r\n We also believe that cooperation with the Review \r\nprocess not only implies a formal Review process \r\nsubmission by each State, but also an engagement with \r\nA/65/PV.42  \r\n \r\n10-61802 8 \r\n \r\nregard to substance. The success of the Review system \r\nwill depend crucially on the manner in which \r\nrecommendations are implemented by the States under \r\nreview and the way in which States discuss and follow \r\nup on them. States under review that reject \r\nrecommendations should nevertheless engage in a \r\ndiscussion about the underlying reasons for the \r\nrejection, and rejections should not in general preclude \r\nproper follow-up on the issue at hand. \r\n A concrete proposal to strengthen the follow-up \r\nprocess could consist of having States submit an \r\ninterim report, possibly oral, on current progress in the \r\nimplementation of the recommendations. Thematic \r\nclustering of recommendations and the integration of \r\nthe outcome into a single document could also \r\nfacilitate implementation and the provision of technical \r\nassistance. \r\n The modalities for the second round of the \r\nUniversal Periodic Review, which, we understand, \r\nhave been part of the ongoing discussions of the \r\nReview in Geneva, will therefore be of crucial \r\nimportance for the ultimate value of the new \r\nmechanism. \r\n We regret that the work of the special procedures \r\nhas again come under criticism. The independence of \r\nthe mandate holders must not be put into question \r\nowing simply to disagreement with their findings. \r\nAllegations of States that an independent expert has \r\noverstepped a given mandate can and should be \r\naddressed by the Coordination Committee. The full \r\nindependence of special procedures is essential to \r\nensuring high-quality work, which makes those \r\nmechanisms such an important feature of the United \r\nNations human rights machinery. At the same time, we \r\nmust continue to ensure that the best possible experts \r\nare chosen as mandate holders. A professional selection \r\nprocess and predictable and adequate funding are \r\nimportant elements in that respect. \r\n Proper and timely implementation of the \r\ndecisions of the Council is crucial for its authority. In \r\nthat respect, the autonomy of the Council needs to be \r\nstrengthened, inter alia through strengthening respect \r\nfor the Council’s decisions in other forums. During its \r\nbrief history, the relationship between the Council and \r\nthe Assembly, in particular the Third and Fifth \r\nCommittees, has been inefficient and at times \r\ninconsistent. From both a procedural and a substantive \r\npoint of view, that relationship has potential for \r\nimprovement and clarification, which would strengthen \r\nthe Council’s role within and outside the United \r\nNations system. \r\n For example, the recurring procedural questions \r\nof where and in what form the report of the Council \r\nshould be dealt with and how the Council’s decisions \r\ncan be appropriately and timely funded require a \r\nsystematic solution. There is also a considerable \r\npotential to increase complementarity between the \r\nagendas of the two bodies. The back and forth between \r\nthe Council and the Assembly on the follow-up to the \r\nGoldstone report (A/HRC/12/48) and then on the \r\nflotilla incident illustrates the problems inherent in the \r\ncurrent practice, usually to the detriment of the Human \r\nRights Council. \r\n A proliferation of political tracks can never be a \r\nsubstitute for effective political action and is, of \r\ncourse, a very inefficient use of our resources. The \r\nreview of the status of the Council here in New York as \r\nwell as of the work and functioning of the Council in \r\nGeneva provides a welcome opportunity to address \r\nthese and other issues. \r\n On the positive side, we note that the Council has \r\nbeen able to create innovative ways of dealing with \r\ncountry situations, in particular the stand-alone \r\ninteractive dialogue on Somalia. Another good \r\ninnovation was the special sitting on the flotilla \r\nincident, leaving aside the question of the parallel \r\nconsideration of the issue in the two bodies I have \r\nmentioned. Both examples illustrate that there is room \r\nfor flexibility within the existing framework and that \r\nthe Council can indeed react in creative ways to \r\nemergency situations. \r\n We also consider it to be a positive development \r\nthat such discussions can take place in an interactive \r\nway and do not necessarily have to result in some sort \r\nof formal decision, certainly not necessarily at a first \r\nstage. We hope that such models will be further \r\nexplored and, when appropriate, will be combined with \r\npositive follow-up consideration. Additional formats, \r\nsuch as monthly briefings by the High Commissioner \r\nfor Human Rights, combined with an interactive \r\ndialogue on current issues, could also help enhance the \r\ndialogue within the Council. \r\n The Human Rights Council depends on \r\nindependent expert input in order to take well-informed \r\ndecisions. As the part of the secretariat that offers \r\nexpertise on human rights, it is the task of the Office of \r\n A/65/PV.42\r\n \r\n9 10-61802 \r\n \r\nthe High Commissioner to provide such input. \r\nCurrently, a considerable amount of human and \r\nfinancial resources of the Office has been taken up by \r\nconference servicing and administrative tasks for the \r\nCouncil. We believe that we should consider the option \r\nof establishing a permanent office of the President of \r\nthe Council, which would help to alleviate the \r\nadministrative burden of the Office of the High \r\nCommissioner and thereby liberate valuable resources \r\nto be used on substantive work in the field of human \r\nrights under the oversight of the General Assembly. It \r\nwould also strengthen the governance structure of the \r\nCouncil itself and thereby contribute positively to its \r\nperception outside. \r\n Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to express Egypt’s appreciation for \r\nthe statement made by the President of the Human \r\nRights Council before the General Assembly, following \r\nthe statement he made yesterday at the general debate \r\nof the Third Committee on the report of the Council \r\n(A/65/53), which was submitted in accordance with the \r\ntemporary compromise agreement to consider the \r\nreport of the Council both in a General Assembly \r\nplenary meeting and in the Third Committee. \r\n This approach re-emphasizes the Third \r\nCommittee’s broad mandate to consider and act upon \r\nall the Human Rights Council’s recommendations \r\ncontained in the report, including those that deal with \r\nthe development of international law in the field of \r\nhuman rights, without prejudice to the right of Member \r\nStates to submit resolutions and decisions in the \r\nGeneral Assembly or in the Third Committee on any \r\nissue contained in the report. \r\n Since its establishment by resolution 60/251, the \r\nHuman Rights Council has continuously improved its \r\nperformance through unifying working standards and \r\nadopting a constructive cooperative approach in \r\ndealing with human rights issues, with a view to \r\nproviding advice and the necessary support, upon the \r\nrequest of Member States. In this way, international \r\ncooperation in the field of human rights has been \r\nimproved based on the principle of the primary \r\nresponsibility of Governments in promoting and \r\nprotecting human rights, as established by the World \r\nSummit Outcome Document of 2005 (resolution 60/1). \r\n The choice of good global governance as the \r\nmain theme for our discussions during the sixty-fifth \r\nsession of the General Assembly has emphasized the \r\nimportant contribution of governance to the protection \r\nof all human rights in accordance with international \r\nconventions and agreements, the significance of the \r\nfull enjoyment of these rights by all peoples of the \r\nworld without exception or discrimination, and the \r\nneed for the international community to intensify its \r\nefforts to achieve the following objectives. \r\n First, we must restore the balance in the \r\ninternational interest in economic, social and cultural \r\nrights, on the one hand, and civil and political rights, \r\non the other hand. That can be strengthened by \r\nbridging the gap between the North and the South with \r\na view to providing better living standards, which in \r\nturn would contribute to the advancement of human \r\nrights for individuals and communities alike. We \r\nshould also strengthen our efforts to combat all forms \r\nof discrimination on the basis of race, sex, language or \r\nreligion, including through the implementation of our \r\njoint commitments, in accordance with the Durban \r\nDeclaration, its programme of action and the outcome \r\ndocument of its review conference. \r\n Secondly, we should respect the institutional \r\nbalance between the roles of the principal organs of the \r\nUnited Nations in addressing human rights issues, \r\nwhile avoiding attempts to address such issues from a \r\nlimited security perspective that fails to take into \r\naccount the social and economic dimensions. \r\nFurthermore, we should avoid the attempts of some to \r\nimpose their own values, ideas and views and the \r\nstandards of their justice, social, legal and human \r\nrights systems on others, and to promote certain \r\ncontroversial notions that do not take into account the \r\ndiversity of the societies’ various social, cultural and \r\nlegislative systems. \r\n In that regard, it is important to respect the \r\nmandate of the Human Rights Council by refraining \r\nfrom submitting country-specific recommendations to \r\nthe Third Committee, particularly since all those \r\nrecommendations target only developing countries and \r\nhamper our efforts to reach consensus solutions, which \r\ncan help strengthen respect for human rights in the \r\ncontext of constructive and objective cooperation \r\namong developed and developing countries. \r\n Thirdly, we should objectively and impartially \r\nstrengthen the programmes of the various mechanisms \r\nwithin the Human Rights Council in all Member States, \r\nwithout exception, double standards, politicization or \r\nselectivity. \r\nA/65/PV.42  \r\n \r\n10-61802 10 \r\n \r\n Fourthly, we should reiterate the central role of \r\nthe Council in ensuring respect for all human rights \r\nand international humanitarian law, in particular in the \r\noccupied Palestinian territories, by verifying Israel’s \r\nfull compliance with all its international obligations, \r\nincluding its commitment to cooperate fully with the \r\nSpecial Rapporteur and the fact-finding missions and \r\ncommissions mandated by the Human Rights Council \r\nto investigate gross human rights violations in the \r\noccupied Palestinian territories. \r\n Fifthly, we must enhance dialogue and promote \r\ncooperation to ensure the effectiveness of the special \r\nprocedures system. It is a shared responsibility \r\nbetween the mandate holders, the States and all other \r\nrelevant parties that should be based on the principles \r\nof transparency, fairness and mutual cooperation, while \r\nensuring full respect by the special procedures of their \r\nmandates and responsibilities granted by the Human \r\nRights Council and their full adherence to the code of \r\nconduct. \r\n Sixthly, we need to provide the financial \r\nresources needed to implement the activities of the \r\nOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in \r\norder to allow it to provide the necessary assistance to \r\nand consultation with Member States, as well as \r\ncapacity-building, and to ensure the Commissioner’s \r\ncoordinated role in supporting the activities of the \r\nHuman Rights Council. \r\n This year, Egypt completed its Universal Periodic \r\nReview within the Human Rights Council and has \r\nsuccessfully demonstrated its commitment to \r\nprotecting and promoting all human rights. On the \r\nbasis of the recommendations that it has accepted \r\nwithin the international review process, Egypt is \r\nsteadily moving towards strengthening respect for \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as the \r\nvalues of democracy and comprehensive societal \r\nparticipation. We are working towards ensuring the \r\nequal rights and duties of all citizens by strengthening \r\ncooperation among the Government, civil society and \r\nthe private sector and the political and democratic \r\nreform process that the Government is steadily \r\nimplementing. Egypt will continue to meet its \r\ninternational obligations and to promote respect for all \r\nhuman rights at the regional and international levels. \r\n While Egypt welcomes progress in implementing \r\ninstitution-building and in developing the working \r\nmethods of the Human Rights Council, including the \r\ncode of conduct for the mandates of Special \r\nRapporteurs, increasing international support for the \r\nUniversal Periodic Review mechanism, the creation of \r\ncomplaint procedures, the establishment of the Forum \r\non Minority Issues, and efforts to rationalize, develop \r\nand improve the working methods of the treaty bodies, \r\nwe look forward to further progress on the Council’s \r\nmechanisms through the specific recommendations of \r\nthe current review process of the Council’s working \r\nmethods under way in Geneva. Those should seek to \r\nensure the full compliance of special procedures with \r\ntheir mandates and with the code of conduct that \r\ngoverns their actions. That is necessary to ensure the \r\nnecessary coordination and complementarity between \r\nthe priorities of the Office of the High Commissioner \r\nfor Human Rights and those of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil in accordance with clear and specific \r\nguidelines in support of the Council’s efforts to achieve \r\nthe universality of internationally agreed human rights \r\nand to improve the effectiveness of the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review mechanism. That would also ensure \r\nthe Council’s balanced programme of work through the \r\njust and comprehensive consideration of all human \r\nrights issues, in particular the right to self-\r\ndetermination. \r\n In that regard, Egypt reaffirms the \r\ncomplementary nature of the review processes of the \r\nCouncil both in New York and in Geneva. It \r\nunderscores the importance of working in a way that \r\nensures reviewing the Council’s status in New York on \r\nthe basis of the report on the review process under way \r\nin Geneva, to be submitted by the Council to the \r\nGeneral Assembly. As the head of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement, Egypt will exert every effort to ensure full \r\ncoordination with all States, in Geneva and New York, \r\nin order to achieve the desired objectives of the review \r\nprocess through consensus. \r\n Mr. Vigny (Switzerland) (spoke in French): My \r\ndelegation thanks the President of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil for his report (A/65/53). Given that the \r\nCouncil is a subsidiary organ of the General Assembly, \r\nSwitzerland believes that the plenary is the appropriate \r\nplace to become familiar with it and to act. \r\n The Council’s balance sheet is impressive, not \r\nonly in terms of its volume and the diversity of topics \r\nand situations that it deals with, but also in terms of its \r\ncapacity for innovation. For example, cross-regional \r\nthematic initiatives, such as human rights education \r\n A/65/PV.42\r\n \r\n11 10-61802 \r\n \r\nand training, make it possible to transcend the \r\ndifferences that characterize group thinking. \r\n Similarly, the Council should better exploit the \r\ninstruments at its disposal in order to react in a more \r\nappropriate way to situations of human rights \r\nviolations, whatever their nature and wherever they \r\noccur in the world. The Council could thus address \r\nsituations in various countries through, for example, \r\npresidential statements, stand-alone interactive \r\ndialogue and urgent debates. Such practices should be \r\nencouraged. \r\n As regards human rights implementation \r\nmechanisms, the special procedures should retain their \r\nindependence in order to give a voice to victims and \r\nhuman rights defenders. Switzerland welcomes the \r\nestablishment of two new special procedures on the \r\nfreedoms of association and peaceful assembly and on \r\nnon-discrimination against women in law and in \r\npractice. \r\n While those procedures must comply with the \r\ncode of conduct contained in Council resolution 5/2, \r\nStates also have the duty to cooperate with them. \r\nFollow-up on the recommendations of the procedures \r\nis a key element in strengthening human rights. In \r\norder to continue to be the Council’s eyes and ears, the \r\nspecial procedures system must undertake initiatives, \r\nas in the case of the joint study on secret detention. \r\nSuch initiatives help strengthen the protection of \r\nhuman rights. \r\n The Universal Periodic Review is one of the \r\nCouncil’s successes. However, some adjustments to its \r\nsecond cycle should be made. It is vital that all \r\ndelegations express their views and that the \r\nrecommendations of the first cycle be appropriately \r\nfollowed up. \r\n Despite some positive developments, the rapid \r\npace of the Council’s work calls for a streamlining of \r\nits programme and working methods. Thus, the review \r\nof the Council’s work started in Geneva is an \r\nopportunity to make the necessary improvements, so \r\nthat all serious situations of human rights violations in \r\nthe world can be considered there. Once again a \r\nmember of the Council, Switzerland is stepping up its \r\nefforts in that direction. \r\n As the Council is almost permanently in session, \r\nwe wish to particularly emphasize the need to \r\ninstitutionalize the Office of President of the Council. \r\nAs in the General Assembly, it is vital that the \r\npresidency of the Council enjoy sufficient support in \r\norder to ensure the stability and continuity necessary to \r\nfulfilling its mandate as effectively as possible. \r\n We are also approaching next year’s review of the \r\nstatus of the Council by the General Assembly. It is \r\nnecessary to establish flexible cooperation between the \r\nThird Committee and the Council in the interest of \r\ncomplementarity and in order to avoid unnecessary \r\nduplication. Finally, it is fundamental that the Office of \r\nthe High Commissioner for Human Rights be able to \r\nmaintain its room for manoeuvre in exercising its \r\nfunctions, including in new areas. It should be placed \r\nunder no supervisory authority other than that of the \r\nSecretary-General. \r\n In conclusion, the year ahead will be a pivotal \r\nyear for the Council. It is up to us to work together in a \r\nconstructive and innovative spirit oriented towards the \r\nimplementation of durable solutions. Our discussions \r\nshould not make us forget, however, the rights and \r\nneeds of victims and vulnerable groups. \r\n Mr. Kleib (Indonesia): First of all, allow me to \r\nexpress my appreciation to the Human Rights Council \r\nfor its report (A/65/53) to the General Assembly. \r\nJudging from the impressive volume of the report, as \r\nwell as the many important themes covered, my \r\ndelegation is truly grateful for the Council’s tireless \r\nefforts to further promote and protect human rights at \r\nthe global level. \r\n I wish also to congratulate and welcome the new \r\nPresident of the Human Rights Council, Ambassador \r\nSihasak Phuangketkeow. My delegation underscores its \r\nsupport and commitment to his forthcoming \r\nendeavours to further the causes of the Council. Let me \r\nalso reiterate Indonesia’s firm commitment to \r\ncontinuously enhancing the credibility of the Council \r\nin promoting and protecting human rights through \r\ngenuine dialogue and cooperation. \r\n In June 2011, the Human Rights Council will \r\nhave ended its fifth cycle and, pursuant to resolution \r\n60/251, a review of its status, work and functioning is \r\nto be undertaken. Indonesia is engaging constructively \r\nwith the review process currently under way in Geneva \r\nand encourages a productive and frank discussion \r\nwithin the auspices of the open-ended \r\nintergovernmental working group on the review of the \r\nwork and functioning of the Human Rights Council. \r\nFor its part, Indonesia contributed to the deliberations \r\nA/65/PV.42  \r\n \r\n10-61802 12 \r\n \r\non various issues during the first meeting of the \r\nworking group in Geneva last week. \r\n We wish to emphasize that, in accordance with \r\nresolution 60/251, the review of the status of the \r\nCouncil is to be undertaken by the General Assembly, \r\nwhile the review of its work and functioning is to be \r\ncarried out by the Council in Geneva. However, this \r\nshould not mean that the process is mutually exclusive; \r\non the contrary, we should ensure that the processes are \r\ninterrelated. Indonesia believes that both reviews \r\nshould contribute to the enhancement of the profile and \r\ncentrality of the Human Rights Council, as well as to \r\nthe promotion and protection of human rights. \r\n Indonesia continues to be a committed participant \r\nand steadfast supporter of the work of the Council, and \r\nattaches great importance to the review of its current \r\nworking practices and mechanisms. It is imperative \r\nthat the Council be able to fulfil its mandate in all \r\naspects. \r\n It is undeniable that the Council, in comparison \r\nwith its predecessor, has made significant progress. \r\nThe comfort level of countries to engage with the \r\nCouncil has clearly increased. One reason for this \r\npositive development is the innovative Universal \r\nPeriodic Review mechanism, which enters its ninth \r\nsession this month. The dialogue around each country’s \r\nUniversal Periodic Review has set an example of how \r\nStates can cooperate and engage constructively with \r\none another in avoiding the politicization of issues and \r\nthe unproductive naming and shaming of one another. \r\nIt is Indonesia’s hope that the mechanism will be \r\nmaintained and made more efficient in the future. \r\n With regard to the work and mandate of the \r\nspecial procedures, Indonesia strongly believes that \r\nspecial procedures mandate holders should maintain \r\ntheir professionalism in fulfilling their mandates \r\nthrough compliance with the code of conduct and by \r\nbuilding mutual trust and closer cooperation with the \r\nStates. Indonesia fully respects the independence of the \r\nspecial procedures mandate holders when they are \r\nconducting their work in line with Human Rights \r\nCouncil resolution 5/2. However, we also wish to draw \r\nattention to paragraph 3 of article 4 of the resolution, \r\nwhich stipulates the necessity for national legislation to \r\nbe respected and upheld at all times. \r\n In the course of its work, the Council has also \r\ndemonstrated its responsiveness in tackling issues of \r\nconcern among countries. One example of this was the \r\nimmediate convening of an urgent debate and, \r\nsubsequently, the adoption of Human Rights Council \r\nresolution 14/1 on the attacks by Israeli forces upon a \r\nhumanitarian flotilla in international waters in June \r\n2010. \r\n Let me conclude by reiterating our hope that the \r\nCouncil will become the main forum in which genuine \r\ndialogue and cooperation in the field of human rights \r\nare undertaken. I am convinced that through our efforts \r\nhere and in Geneva, we can devise ways to reach that \r\ngoal. I therefore hope that the review process will \r\nstrengthen the work of the Council. \r\n Mr. Núñez Mosquera (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nI thank Ambassador Sihasak Phuangketkeow, President \r\nof the Human Rights Council, for his briefing on the \r\nCouncil’s annual report (A/65/53). The establishment \r\nof the Human Rights Council five years ago resulted \r\nfrom the urgent need to address the discredit in which \r\nthe Commission on Human Rights, caught up in double \r\nstandards, confrontation and political manipulation, \r\nfound itself. \r\n In its work, the Council has displayed a solid \r\ndemocratic basis in its working methods and the \r\ndetermination of its agenda. It has worked effectively \r\nand with transparency. However, there remain \r\nchallenges and threats to the climate of cooperation \r\nand genuine dialogue in its work that have to be \r\naddressed in order to achieve greater effectiveness in \r\nits work. For example, we are concerned that it has not \r\nbeen possible to put an end to all those country \r\nmandates, established on a discriminatory and selective \r\nbasis, that determined the treatment of item 9 on the \r\nagenda of the Commission on Human Rights. We are \r\nalso concerned about the way in which item 4 on the \r\nCouncil’s agenda has been used to voice criticism and \r\ncondemnation of countries of the South — always the \r\nSouth — while the human rights violations that occur \r\nin more powerful countries go completely ignored. \r\n Despite these problems, generally speaking it is \r\nundeniable that the outcome of the recent years’ work \r\nof the Human Rights Council has been positive. In its \r\nshort existence, it has managed to consolidate effective \r\npractices to ensure a truly universal scrutiny of the \r\nhuman rights situation in the world and a climate of \r\nrespect and confidence, essential for its work. The \r\nCouncil has also demonstrated its ability to address \r\nemergencies demanding the attention of the \r\ninternational community. On several occasions, it has \r\n A/65/PV.42\r\n \r\n13 10-61802 \r\n \r\nanalysed the serious human rights violations \r\nperpetuated by Israel on the Palestinian people. \r\n Last week in Geneva, we took the first steps in \r\nthe Human Rights Council review process. Allow me \r\nto stress that this is a review, not a reform process. The \r\nCouncil does not need any reform. It is the unjust, \r\nundemocratic and unfair international order that needs \r\nto be reformed. Cuba actively participated in the first \r\nsession of the working group set up pursuant to \r\nresolution 12/1 and offered specific proposals on how \r\nto improve the work of the Council. \r\n The intergovernmental process under way in \r\nGeneva must lay the foundations for the review of the \r\nCouncil and remain inclusive and transparent in order \r\nto come to an agreement on improvements, where \r\nnecessary, while maintaining the Council’s \r\nachievements since its establishment. In this context, \r\nour delegation wishes to emphasize the need to respect \r\nthe mandate laid down in resolution 60/251. The \r\nprocess in New York must start once the process in \r\nGeneva has reached its conclusion. \r\n We do not believe that radical changes need to be \r\nmade to the functioning of the Council. The main goal \r\nof the review process must be to consolidate the \r\napproach of cooperation and dialogue in its discussions \r\nand work. For Cuba, the review must be aimed at \r\nmaking the minimum adjustments truly necessary to \r\nimproving the mechanisms already established by the \r\nCouncil, such as the Universal Periodic Review, and at \r\naddressing those areas where clear regulations are \r\nlacking, such as the issue of the list of speakers and the \r\nlack of a clear and consistent methodology for the \r\ndrafting of the two reports prepared by the Office of \r\nthe High Commissioner for the Universal Periodic \r\nReview. \r\n Cuba will work to retain the positive features of \r\nthe Council and to definitively eradicate selective \r\npractices and political motives that still underlie the \r\ntreatment of human rights situations. We are opposed \r\nto any attempt to return to selective and discriminatory \r\ntreatment against countries. We cannot be led astray by \r\nsiren calls; we cannot remain silent or abet the \r\nhypocrisy and cynical proposals intended to return the \r\nCouncil’s work to the unhappy period of the \r\nCommission of Human Rights and which has been \r\ndefended by certain countries, supported by members \r\nof the Secretariat and transnational non-governmental \r\norganizations paid by developed countries. \r\n The international community hopes that we can \r\nrespond jointly and effectively to all the crises \r\naffecting humankind today, and especially the \r\ncountries of the South. So long as an unjust and \r\nexclusive international economic and political order \r\npersists, the Council must continue to speak out for an \r\nequitable and democratic international order. We \r\nMember States established the Human Rights Council \r\nand we are the ones participating in its work. It is we \r\nwho are responsible for strengthening it. \r\n Mr. Alhajeri (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nGeneral Assembly is discussing today an important \r\nitem on its agenda. I wish to thank the Human Rights \r\nCouncil for the report before us today (A/65/53), which \r\nsummarizes all that has been done by the international \r\ncommunity to reinforce human rights, as well as the \r\nCouncil’s enduring quest to entrench and defend the \r\nprinciples of human rights. \r\n The progress of nations and peoples is measured \r\nby the extent to which human rights are respected in \r\nword and in deed. The United Nations Charter urges us \r\nto further advance and consolidate human rights and to \r\npreserve the basic freedoms of the individual, the \r\nachievement of which requires us all to stand together. \r\n My delegation has read the report submitted \r\nunder this item and wishes to affirm that the State of \r\nKuwait pays special attention to human rights issues. \r\nThe Kuwaiti Constitution of 1962 provides an overall \r\nlegal framework for the protection advancement of \r\nhuman rights, derived from Islamic sharia and relevant \r\ninternational law contributing to the reinforcement of \r\nthe concept of human rights. Thus, the State of Kuwait \r\nis at the forefront of States sponsoring these rights. \r\n As a defender of human rights, at the national \r\nlevel we provide free health care, education and social \r\nand cultural services on an equal basis for everyone. \r\nThe Kuwaiti Constitution also calls for the prevalence \r\nof justice, equality, freedom and the rule of law among \r\nall citizens. Kuwait has established a high commission \r\nfor human rights to review laws and regulations, \r\nrecommend their amendment, and raise awareness of \r\nhuman rights through various media outlets. \r\n Article 7 of the Kuwaiti Constitution refers to \r\nhuman rights and enshrines the concepts of justice, \r\nequality and compassion among individuals. Article 8 \r\nprovides that the State should preserve the pillars of \r\nsociety and guarantee security, tranquillity and equal \r\nopportunities, while articles 36 and 37 guarantee the \r\nA/65/PV.42  \r\n \r\n10-61802 14 \r\n \r\nfreedom of the press and publishing, thought, \r\nexpression and opinion. \r\n The State of Kuwait has paid special attention to \r\nwomen and granted them more rights than duties and \r\nobligations out of its appreciation of the effective role \r\nthat women play in the conservation and stability of \r\nsociety. The Kuwaiti Constitution confirms that all \r\npeople enjoy equal rights to human dignity without \r\ndiscrimination. It is worth noting in that respect that \r\nmy country has ratified the Convention on the \r\nElimination of All Forms of Discrimination against \r\nWomen. \r\n The State of Kuwait has focused particularly on \r\nthe care of children, guided by the principles of its \r\nConstitution and its commitments under the \r\ninternational conventions and agreements it has \r\nratified, including International Labour Organization \r\nConvention 138 concerning Minimum Age for \r\nAdmission to Employment and Convention 182 \r\nConcerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for \r\nthe Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour. I \r\nnote in that respect that 100 per cent of Kuwaiti \r\nchildren completed elementary school in 2009. \r\n People belonging to almost 120 different \r\nnationalities with different cultures and beliefs live on \r\nKuwaiti soil today, and my country has been very eager \r\nto provide these communities with appropriate living \r\nconditions. Furthermore, the Kuwaiti Constitution, in \r\narticles 35 to 39 and 43 to 45, provides for the \r\nstrengthening and protection of freedoms and rights, \r\nincluding the freedom of faith and the freedom to hold \r\nreligious ceremonies, guaranteeing to these \r\ncommunities the exercise of their ceremonies and \r\nbeliefs in total freedom. \r\n Inspired by the saying of the Prophet Mohammed \r\nthat “all people are as equal as the teeth of a comb”, \r\nKuwait affirms the established principles of its foreign \r\npolicy, which emphasizes the consolidation of \r\ninternational peace and security, the rejection of \r\nviolence, non-interference in the internal affairs of \r\nother States, and respect for human rights. \r\n The State of Kuwait, as part of its pursuit to \r\nfurther human rights and human dignity through \r\ngovernmental and non-governmental organizations and \r\ninstitutions, has provided humanitarian assistance in \r\nvarious forms to all suffering peoples in need without \r\nany consideration for their religion, colour or race. \r\n In discussing today the subject of human rights, \r\nwe cannot disregard the gross and grave violations of \r\nall international norms and laws that the Israeli \r\noccupation forces commit against the unarmed \r\nPalestinian people, or Israel’s infringement of \r\ninternational humanitarian law through its illegal \r\nsettlement activities and unjust siege of the Gaza Strip, \r\ndepriving an unarmed population of their basic needs. \r\nThe international community must assume its \r\nresponsibilities and protect the Palestinian people from \r\nall the illegal practices and policies of the Israeli \r\noccupation. \r\n Finally, the State of Kuwait will spare no effort to \r\nfurther advance and defend the cause of human rights \r\nin all international forums. We will do this through our \r\nactive participation in all regional and international \r\nconferences. I would like to emphasize that our pursuit \r\nto further advance the cause of human rights shall \r\ncome to fruition only through the coordination and \r\ncooperation of the United Nations with other entities \r\nand non-governmental organizations. \r\n Ms. Hernando (Philippines): At the outset, allow \r\nme to thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to \r\nspeak on the agenda item on the report of the Human \r\nRights Council (A/65/53). My delegation thanks the \r\nPresident of the Human Rights Council, Ambassador \r\nSihasak Phuangketkeow, for his presence and for \r\npresenting the annual report of the Council. \r\n In 2006, the Human Rights Council was \r\nestablished to strengthen the United Nations human \r\nrights machinery so as to ensure the effective \r\nenjoyment by all of all human rights, covering civil, \r\npolitical, economic, social and cultural rights, \r\nincluding the right to development. As we take stock \r\ntoday of the gains achieved by this relatively young \r\ninstitution, the Philippines notes that the Human Rights \r\nCouncil has made reasonable progress in fulfilling its \r\nmandate as set forth in resolution 60/251. \r\n The workload of the Council has markedly \r\nincreased since its inception, and the growing number \r\nof cross-regional initiatives, which demonstrate the \r\npositive engagement and cooperation of delegations to \r\nwork towards more practical and forward-looking \r\napproaches, indicates that the Council provides an \r\nenabling environment to foster international \r\ncooperation in solving international problems of an \r\neconomic, social, cultural or humanitarian character. \r\n A/65/PV.42\r\n \r\n15 10-61802 \r\n \r\n Several resolutions have been acted upon and \r\nadopted by the Council in its fifteenth session, and the \r\nPhilippines welcomes in particular resolution 15/25 on \r\nthe right to development. Given the current economic, \r\nfinancial and climate crises, as well as recurrent large-\r\nscale natural disasters, the realization of the right to \r\ndevelopment becomes all the more imperative and \r\nurgent. Thus, the Philippines is pleased that the \r\nCouncil continues to act to ensure that its agenda \r\npromotes and advances sustainable development and \r\nthe achievement of the Millennium Development Goals \r\nand, in this regard, to seek to raise the right to \r\ndevelopment, as set out in the Vienna Declaration and \r\nProgramme of Action, to the same level and on a par \r\nwith all other human rights and fundamental freedoms. \r\n Advancing sustainable development and the \r\nrealization of the Millennium Development Goals \r\nrequires the eradication of extreme poverty, which \r\nviolates human dignity. In this regard, the Philippines \r\nsupports the work of the Council towards the \r\nfinalization of the draft guiding principles on extreme \r\npoverty and human rights with a view to ensuring that \r\nthe principles will help strengthen the implementation \r\nof existing international human rights law. They would \r\nalso make international human rights law and policy \r\nmore relevant to people living in extreme poverty by \r\nraising their awareness of their rights and entitlements. \r\n On the issue of the human rights of migrants, the \r\nPhilippines welcomes the Council’s call on States that \r\nhave not yet done so to consider, as a matter of priority, \r\nsigning and ratifying or acceding to the International \r\nConvention on the Protection of the Rights of All \r\nMigrant Workers and Members of Their Families. The \r\nimpact of the global economic and financial crisis \r\nundoubtedly presents additional challenges to the \r\nprotection and promotion of human rights of migrants \r\nand their families and increases their vulnerability to \r\nexploitation, such as trafficking. The Philippines and \r\nGermany therefore sponsored resolution 14/2, entitled \r\n“Trafficking in persons, especially women and \r\nchildren: regional and subregional cooperation in \r\npromoting a human rights-based approach to \r\ncombating trafficking in persons”, at the fourteenth \r\nsession of the Human Rights Council. \r\n The Philippines continues to support the Council \r\nin encouraging Member States that have not done so to \r\nenact domestic legislation and strengthen international \r\ncooperation to combat human trafficking and \r\nsmuggling. The Philippines hopes that the Council will \r\ncontinue to forge international partnerships on human \r\nrights and focus on capacity-building for developing \r\ncountries. \r\n The Universal Periodic Review, with its \r\nintergovernmental and peer-review character, remains \r\nthe most innovative and effective mechanism of the \r\nCouncil in ensuring that States fulfil their \r\nresponsibility to respect and implement human rights \r\nand fundamental freedoms. One hundred and twenty-\r\neight countries have already undergone the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review since it was first established. There is \r\nstill a need, however, to strengthen the review process \r\nif we are to bring to fruition our vision of an ever-\r\nresponsive mechanism to improve human rights \r\nsituations in all countries and to address human rights \r\nviolations wherever they occur. \r\n My delegation acknowledges the role of special \r\nprocedures and their contribution to the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights. Their independence is an \r\nimportant aspect of their work, but must be balanced \r\nby important considerations such as professionalism, \r\nintegrity, efficiency and effectiveness. \r\n Finally, as the Human Rights Council and all its \r\nstakeholders embark on the crucial formal review \r\nprocess, my delegation is confident that dialogue and \r\ncooperation, the pillars of international engagement on \r\nhuman rights, will be strengthened and that all relevant \r\nparties will identify concrete and practical means by \r\nwhich the efficiency of the Council’s work can be \r\nfurther enhanced. \r\n Mr. Hassan Ahmed (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nAt the outset, I welcome the report of the Human \r\nRights Council (A/65/53), introduced by President \r\nAmbassador Sihasak Phuangketkeow, and congratulate \r\nhim on his wise work at the head of the Council and to \r\nwish him every success regarding the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review of the activities and performance of \r\nthe Council. \r\n Since it was established five years ago, the \r\nHuman Rights Council has been an important success \r\nstory of the General Assembly and its subsidiary \r\nbodies in addressing human rights issues on the basis \r\nof the equality of all States through the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review, to which all States without exception \r\nare submitted. Furthermore, in keeping with its \r\nmandate under resolution 60/251, the Council provides \r\nrecommendations through special procedures that can \r\nbe an outstanding process if the mandate holders carry \r\nA/65/PV.42  \r\n \r\n10-61802 16 \r\n \r\nout their task impartially and without politicization or \r\nselectivity, in accordance with the spirit and letter of \r\ntheir mandates and the code of conduct set out in \r\nHuman Rights Council resolution 5/2 and reaffirmed in \r\nresolution 11/11 of June 2009. \r\n Resolution 60/251 refers to a review of the \r\nfunctions and performance of the Council within five \r\nyears, but does not refer to reform because the Council \r\nas it stands is in no need of reform. Rather, it needs an \r\nincrease in and control of its working methods without \r\nchanging its mandate. The Sudan is currently preparing \r\nits report to be submitted to the Universal Periodic \r\nReview during the first half of 2011. The competent \r\nauthorities in my country, as well as civil society \r\norganizations and all other partners, are involved in the \r\npreparation of the report, which will look at the \r\ndemocratic transformation of our country and the \r\nrecent presidential and parliamentary elections that led \r\nto the election of the President and the Parliament in a \r\ndemocratic, peaceful way, as was noted by many \r\nobservers from several areas of the world. \r\n In his report submitted to the Human Rights \r\nCouncil (A/HRC/14/41) at its last session in September \r\nand October 2010, and which is currently under \r\nconsideration, the independent expert on the situation \r\nof human rights in the Sudan, Mr. Mohamed Chande \r\nOthman, commended Sudanese cooperation with the \r\nUnited Nations human rights mechanisms, including \r\nhis own mandate under Human Rights Council \r\nresolution 11/10 of June 2009. The independent expert \r\nalso welcomed the establishment by the Sudan of two \r\njoint human rights forums and of a subsidiary joint \r\nforum of the Sudanese Government and the two United \r\nNations missions, the African Union-United Nations \r\nHybrid Operation in Darfur and the United Nations \r\nMission in the Sudan, to monitor the human rights \r\nsituation there. He also commended legal and \r\nlegislative developments, particularly the Sudan’s \r\nratification of the Convention on the Rights of the \r\nChild, the Press and Printed Materials Act, a new law \r\non public order, and the ratification of the Southern \r\nSudan Referendum Act, the Popular Consultation for \r\nBlue Nile and South Kordofan States Act and the Abyei \r\nReferendum Act. He also commended provincial, \r\npresidential and legislative elections, as reflected in the \r\nreport before us, and the impartiality and fairness of \r\nthe elections and the fact that they occurred without \r\nfraud or violence. \r\n The Human Rights Council has adopted historic \r\nresolutions, in particular those on the Goldstone report, \r\nthe United Nations Independent International Fact-\r\nFinding Mission on the Gaza Conflict, and the \r\nnumerous war crimes, crimes against humanity and \r\ncrimes of genocide committed by the Israeli Army \r\nagainst the unarmed inhabitants of Gaza. These \r\nachievements were supplemented by yet another — the \r\nCouncil’s decision regarding Israeli Army aggression \r\nagainst the freedom flotilla and the murder of \r\nnumerous aid and relief workers attempting to provide \r\nhumanitarian aid to lift the blockade against Gaza. \r\n Mr. Munde (India): My delegation would like to \r\nthank the President of the Human Rights Council for \r\nhis briefing and for introducing the Council’s report \r\n(A/65/53). \r\n Since its creation in 2006, the Human Rights \r\nCouncil has played a commendable role. This has \r\nhelped the Council to achieve its pre-eminent, \r\nlegitimate and premier position in dealing with human \r\nrights issues on the international stage. We are \r\nencouraged by the broad consensus that the Council \r\nhas been a considerable improvement over its \r\npredecessor, the Commission on Human Rights, and \r\nhas addressed human rights issues in a more \r\nconstructive manner. This has been possible mainly \r\nowing to the Council’s basic shift in emphasis to the \r\nprinciples of universality, impartiality, objectivity and \r\ncapacity-building that underlie its mechanisms, agenda, \r\nprogramme of work and methods of work. \r\n The Council’s strength also lies in its emphasis \r\non dialogue, cooperation, transparency and non-\r\nselectivity in the promotion and protection of all \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedom for all. In \r\nsubstantive terms, the enthusiastic participation of \r\nMember States in the Universal Periodic Review \r\nprocess up to now is proof of that. It also underscores \r\nthe success of that innovative mechanism, which has \r\nprovided a platform for the sharing of national \r\nexperiences and best practices in consultation with and \r\nwith the consent of the country concerned. It is also \r\nworth noting that the Review has generated a new \r\nmomentum towards ratification of core international \r\nhuman rights instruments, the submission of periodic \r\nreports to treaty bodies, better cooperation with special \r\nprocedures, greater openness towards human rights \r\ncomplaints procedures, and the enactment of national \r\nmeasures in line with the obligations of a State party \r\nunder relevant human rights instruments. \r\n A/65/PV.42\r\n \r\n17 10-61802 \r\n \r\n I am happy to note the proactive attitude of the \r\nHuman Rights Council in examining and reacting to \r\nseveral emergent human rights situations. Since its \r\ncreation, the Council, in addition to its 15 regular \r\nsessions, has also convened 13 special sessions to \r\ndeliberate issues of special concern. This has helped to \r\nfurther reinforce and strengthen the Council’s \r\ncredibility internationally and provided an appropriate \r\nforum for Member States to raise human rights issues. \r\n We are in the fifth year since the establishment of \r\nthe Council. This is an opportunity to ensure that we \r\nlearn from the current functioning and practices of the \r\nCouncil and formalize them in the ongoing review of \r\nthe Human Rights Council. We hope that our review \r\nefforts will be based on an inclusive approach that \r\nrespects diversity in historical national experiences, \r\ncultures and development. In this regard, we would \r\nlike to welcome the discussions that took place last \r\nweek in the first meeting of the open-ended \r\nintergovernmental working group on the review of the \r\nwork and functioning of the Human Rights Council. \r\n We feel that, during the review process, the \r\nCouncil should consider streamlining its programme of \r\nwork by meeting in two regular sessions for a total of \r\neight weeks every year, with the remaining third \r\nsession of two weeks to be added to the existing \r\nprogramme for the Universal Periodic Review. \r\n In addition, in order to give the necessary focus \r\nto the intergovernmental nature of the Council, we \r\nwould support preserving the procedural and \r\norganizational role of the President of the Human \r\nRights Council and the Bureau. We would also like to \r\nreiterate that the complaint procedure within the \r\nCouncil should be retained, while exploring the \r\npossibility of streamlining its functioning. We believe \r\nthat it serves a useful purpose and that its effectiveness \r\ncan be judged by the relatively high rate of quality and \r\ntimely responses from States. \r\n Having created the Human Rights Council as a \r\nsubsidiary body of the General Assembly, we \r\nappreciate the current practice of presenting the report \r\nof the Council in the General Assembly directly, in the \r\nunderstanding that all its recommendations are \r\nconsidered and acted upon by the Third Committee of \r\nthe General Assembly. \r\n We also call for putting in place mechanisms and \r\nprocedures by which the decisions of the General \r\nAssembly on the report of the Council, especially those \r\nwith financial implications, can be acted upon quickly \r\nby shortening the time for consideration of the \r\nfinancial implications by the Advisory Committee on \r\nAdministrative and Budgetary Questions and the Fifth \r\nCommittee so as to minimize the time lag currently \r\nbeing experienced. \r\n India attaches considerable importance to the \r\npromotion and protection of human rights. India \r\nremains committed to making the Human Rights \r\nCouncil a strong, effective and efficient body, capable \r\nof promoting and protecting the human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms of all. \r\n I would also like to say that a spirit of \r\ncooperation and mutual understanding should guide the \r\nwork of the Human Rights Council. We reiterate our \r\ncommitment to continuing to engage constructively \r\nwith all Member States and to strive to ensure that the \r\nCouncil retains its pre-eminent place in the \r\ninternational human rights arena. \r\n Mr. Al Habib (Islamic Republic of Iran): At the \r\noutset, I would like to thank the President of the \r\nHuman Rights Council for his presentation, which has \r\nprovided us with an overview of the developments and \r\nactivities of the Council and the challenges that it is \r\nfacing. \r\n We welcome today’s meeting to consider the \r\nreports of the Human Rights Council (see A/65/53), \r\nincluding that of its fifteenth session (A/65/53/Add.1), \r\nwhich contain a number of important resolutions, \r\nincluding the reference to the reports concerning the \r\nIsraeli regime’s attacks on the flotilla of ships, as well \r\nas its brutal assault on the innocent Palestinian people \r\nin Gaza. \r\n The establishment of the Human Rights Council \r\nwas one of the most significant initiatives taken in the \r\nUnited Nations, not only for its contribution to the \r\nimprovement of the United Nations human rights \r\nstructure, but also and fundamentally for its capacity \r\nand ability to change the environment of confrontation \r\nbetween Governments that characterized the former \r\nCommission on Human Rights, which ultimately gave \r\nway to the Human Rights Council as a forum for \r\ndialogue and cooperation. \r\n The Islamic Republic of Iran, along with other \r\ndeveloping countries, actively participated and \r\npositively contributed to the reform process of the \r\nUnited Nations human rights machinery and the \r\nA/65/PV.42  \r\n \r\n10-61802 18 \r\n \r\nestablishment of the Council with a view to putting an \r\nend to the long-standing politicization and \r\nmanipulation of the United Nations mechanism by a \r\nfew countries. In establishing the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, we all intended to create a mechanism devoid \r\nof selectivity, double standards and political pressure \r\nwhen it comes to human rights and their promotion and \r\nprotection. \r\n We maintain that the review of the Council’s \r\nfunctions and status, as required by resolution 60/251, \r\nis a great opportunity to assess its performance in order \r\nto identify its weaknesses and strengths. We need to \r\nexamine the Council’s functions, based on key and \r\nobjective criteria. We are of the view that the Council’s \r\nwork will not bear fruit unless partiality, selectivity, \r\ndouble standards and politicization are prevented. The \r\nreview must be pursued in an open, transparent, \r\nnon-politicized, constructive and consensual process. \r\nThe full engagement of Member States in that process \r\nmaintains their confidence in the final outcomes. \r\n Moreover, the reappraisal process of the Council \r\nmust be implemented to review and not to reform the \r\nworking and functions of the Human Rights Council \r\nand should not reopen the institution-building package. \r\nThe reform process should concentrate on removing \r\nshortcomings and maintaining the present capabilities \r\nof the Council, including the enhancement of its \r\nefficiency and credibility in the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights in a fair and impartial \r\nmanner. \r\n There is unanimity among States that the \r\nUniversal Periodic Review constitutes a breakthrough \r\nin the work of United Nations intergovernmental \r\nhuman rights activities. The rationale behind creating \r\nsuch a mechanism was to ensure universality, \r\nobjectivity, non-selectivity and impartiality in the work \r\nof the Human Rights Council. The real advantage of \r\nthat mechanism, in a logical setting, is to allow the \r\nhuman rights machinery to act beyond the monopoly of \r\na few in monitoring the human rights situations of \r\nMember States. \r\n In that context, it is unfortunate that, despite the \r\nexistence of the Universal Periodic Review mechanism \r\nin the Human Rights Council, certain countries still \r\ncontinue to table country-specific draft resolutions in \r\nthe Third Committee of the General Assembly. \r\nEveryone in the room is fully aware of the fact that \r\nsuch resolutions are politically motivated exercises to \r\nserve the political purposes and interests of their \r\nsponsors. Tabling country-specific resolutions in the \r\nThird Committee first and foremost undermines the \r\ncredibility of the Human Rights Council as the \r\nspecialized United Nations organ responsible for the \r\nconsideration of human rights situations in all \r\ncountries. \r\n The national report of the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran was considered at the seventh session of the \r\nWorking Group on the Universal Periodic Review in \r\nFebruary 2010. My Government made comprehensive \r\narrangements with all national stakeholders, including \r\ngovernmental and non-governmental institutions, to \r\ndraw up and submit our national report for the \r\nconsideration of the Working Group. The Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran fully and closely cooperated with the \r\nUniversal Periodic Review mechanism by submitting a \r\ncomprehensive and detailed national report, as well as \r\nby dispatching a high-ranking delegation that actively \r\nand constructively participated in the review of Iran’s \r\nnational report in order to play its part in enhancing \r\nand promoting the newly established mechanism. From \r\na total of 188 recommendations, 123 were accepted, \r\nwhich clearly indicates both our openness and our \r\ncommitment to the promotion and protection of human \r\nrights at the national and international levels. \r\nFurthermore, 20 recommendations were considered for \r\nfurther action. \r\n The Islamic Republic of Iran’s human rights \r\npolicy has continuously emphasized the significance of \r\nan interactive and cooperative approach in the \r\npromotion and protection of human rights, as stipulated \r\nin the purposes and principles of the United Nations \r\nCharter, as well as the avoidance of confrontations, \r\ndouble standards and politicization. Iran’s firm \r\ncommitment for the promotion and protection of \r\nhuman rights includes, inter alia, taking measures \r\nleading to a further convergence of values and \r\nprinciples held by various countries with different \r\ncultural, social and historical backgrounds on human \r\nrights questions. In that regard, we look forward to \r\ncontinuing our close cooperation with the Council and \r\nits members to realize our shared objectives of \r\nattaining greater global justice, equity and development \r\nthrough the enhancement of all human rights for all. \r\n Mrs. Morgan Sotomayor (Mexico) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): I would like to thank the President of the \r\nHuman Rights Council for presenting the Council’s \r\nreport to the General Assembly, in accordance with the \r\n A/65/PV.42\r\n \r\n19 10-61802 \r\n \r\nrelevance that must be given to the protection and \r\npromotion of human rights as one of the pillars of our \r\nOrganization. We welcome the report on the activities \r\nof the Human Rights Council that covers the work \r\ndone by that body between September 2009 and June \r\n2010 (A/65/53) and the report on its most recent \r\nsession, held in September (A/65/53/Add.1). \r\n We agree that the Council’s last working cycle \r\nwas particularly fruitful. I would like to highlight some \r\nof the decisions related to its important regulatory \r\nwork, such as the establishment of a working group to \r\ndraft a United Nations declaration on human rights \r\neducation and training and the extension of the \r\nmandate of the Open-ended Working Group on a \r\nprotocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child \r\non a communications procedure. \r\n Regarding the strengthening of the system of \r\nspecial procedures, the decision to appoint a special \r\nrapporteur on the rights to freedom of assembly and of \r\nassociation should be mentioned, as should the \r\nestablishment of a working group of experts on the \r\nelimination of discrimination against women in law \r\nand in practice. We are sure that the new group of \r\nexperts, whose creation was brought to the \r\nconsideration of the Council by my country, will work \r\nin a spirit of cooperation with States and various \r\nrelevant stakeholders and in coordination with other \r\nUnited Nations entities, particularly the Committee on \r\nthe Elimination of Discrimination against Women and \r\nthe Special Rapporteur on violence against women, to \r\ncompile and disseminate best practices to eliminate \r\ndiscrimination against women before the law. \r\n Mexico is fully committed to strengthening the \r\nUnited Nations Human Rights Council as the \r\nOrganization’s pre-eminent body responsible for \r\npromoting and protecting human rights. In the few \r\nyears that have passed since its creation, the Human \r\nRights Council has made a substantial contribution to \r\nthe protection of human rights, and some of its tools, \r\nsuch as the Universal Periodic Review mechanism, will \r\nhave a greater impact in the future, once the second \r\nreporting cycle begins. That is why we believe that the \r\n2011 review process is an opportunity to \r\nprogrammatically, pragmatically and realistically \r\nidentify the areas in which the Council’s work can be \r\nstrengthened. We must build on the accomplishments \r\nachieved while we identify areas for improvement. \r\n As part of its commitment to promoting the \r\nreview process, Mexico, along with France, \r\nencouraged an informal discussion group that involved \r\n21 countries, the Office of the High Commissioner and \r\ncivil society organizations in order to engage in a \r\nconstructive dialogue on the ways in which this body \r\ncan be strengthened. I would like to note that all \r\ndelegations in Geneva were informed of the results of \r\nthat informal process. \r\n The 2011 review will test our ability to achieve, \r\nthrough a collaborative perspective, the changes \r\nnecessary to ensure the Council’s effectiveness in \r\npromoting and protecting human rights. We are \r\nconvinced that the international community is ready to \r\novercome that challenge. With that goal in mind, \r\nMexico will use that opportunity to make proposals \r\naimed at endowing the mechanisms and procedures \r\nthat the Council has at its disposal with greater \r\nefficiency and impact. \r\n I would like to renew Mexico’s commitment to \r\nwork constructively with all delegations in the review \r\nprocess. \r\n Mrs. Waffa-Ogoo (Gambia): Allow me to thank \r\nthe President of the Human Rights Council for his \r\npresentation of the annual report of the Council \r\n(A/65/53) and to express our appreciation to its \r\nmembers for their efforts in making that Council \r\nfunction as mandated by Assembly resolution 60/251, \r\nentitled “Human Rights Council”. \r\n It is now almost five years since the adoption of \r\nthat landmark resolution, and since then we have \r\nwitnessed the rapid evolution of the Council from a \r\nfledgling institution to a very vibrant subsidiary organ \r\nof the General Assembly. Over the years, we have also \r\nnoted the increase in the volume of the Council’s work, \r\ngiven the number of special sessions it has held since \r\nits creation and the number of countries that have \r\nundergone their Universal Periodic Reviews. We urge \r\nthe Council to continue to fine-tune the work of the \r\nUniversal Periodic Review mechanism as a tool for \r\ngreater cooperation in the promotion and protection of \r\nhuman rights throughout the world. The Council has \r\nalso created a lot of new mandates. \r\n The Gambia underwent its Universal Periodic \r\nReview for the period under review and has carefully \r\nstudied the conclusions of the Working Group. I can \r\nassure the Assembly that we are studying various \r\nhuman rights instruments and conventions to which we \r\nA/65/PV.42  \r\n \r\n10-61802 20 \r\n \r\nare not party with a view to becoming party to some of \r\nthem, in line with our constitutional and international \r\nobligations. We are looking forward to the next review \r\ncycle. \r\n Let me say that perhaps the cycle of reviews \r\nshould be extended to five years. The business of \r\nhuman rights promotion and protection is ongoing, and \r\nwe are committed to that. My delegation therefore \r\nurges the Council to remain true to its mandate as \r\ndefined in its founding resolution. \r\n Assembly resolution 60/251 called for two \r\nreviews, first, a review of the status of the Council \r\nwithin five years by the Assembly itself, and second, a \r\nreview by the Council of its work and functioning five \r\nyears after its establishment, followed by a report to \r\nthe General Assembly. We take note of the appointment \r\nof facilitators for those purposes in both New York and \r\nGeneva and look forward to actively contributing to \r\nthe review processes. \r\n My delegation is particularly interested in the \r\noutcome of the Geneva process. Let me caution that no \r\nreview should attempt to undermine the critical role of \r\nthe General Assembly’s Third Committee as the main \r\nexpert committee dealing with human rights and \r\nrelated issues. The overarching role and universal \r\ncharacter of the Third Committee allow all States to \r\ndeliberate on human rights questions without the usual \r\nlimitations of cost of participation and non-\r\nmembership in the Human Rights Council — \r\nhindrances that will continue for the foreseeable future. \r\n Without prejudice to the outcome of the two \r\nreview processes, it is our considered view that the \r\nCouncil has functioned well as a subsidiary organ of \r\nthe Assembly. The current roles of the Assembly and \r\nits Third Committee should rather be enhanced, as they \r\nallow for greater participation of all States without \r\nexclusion. My delegation equally looks forward to the \r\nreport on the review taking place in Geneva. We intend \r\nto study the report and contribute to any final decisions \r\nthe Assembly may take on the outcome. \r\n Ms. Martina (Ukraine): While my delegation \r\naligns itself with the statement by the representative of \r\nthe European Union, I would like to add a few remarks \r\nhighlighting some specific issues. \r\n During the period covered in the report \r\n(A/65/53), the Human Rights Council dealt with a wide \r\nrange of thematic and specific human rights issues. The \r\nCouncil maintained its important role as a forum for \r\ndialogue and cooperation. At the same time, it should \r\ndo more to improve its ability to address all human \r\nrights situations in a comprehensive and timely \r\nmanner. We welcome the cross-regional initiatives \r\nadvanced within the Council, which, we believe, unite \r\ncountries and strengthen the Council’s work. It is \r\nnoteworthy that consensus was reached on some issues \r\nthat had previously divided States. \r\n We are pleased to note the increasing attention \r\ngiven within the Council to the issue of prevention and \r\nits role in promoting and protecting human rights. We \r\nhope the Council will strengthen the preventive aspect \r\nof its activities and make better use of its prevention \r\npotential in promoting universal respect for and \r\nobservance of human rights and fundamental freedoms \r\nworldwide. \r\n We welcome the work of the Open-ended \r\nWorking Group on the Human Rights Council review \r\nand the active involvement of United Nations Member \r\nStates in that process. The first session of the Working \r\nGroup took place in Geneva last week and marked the \r\nformal launch of the review process. We hope that a \r\nvariety of recommendations and proposals submitted \r\nduring that session will help find the best way of \r\nincreasing the Human Rights Council’s efficiency. The \r\nimportance of coordinating the New York and Geneva \r\nreviews should be underlined. It is also important that \r\nthe review of the Council not hinder its substantive \r\nwork on human rights violations. \r\n Mr. Ali (Malaysia): With the establishment of the \r\nHuman Rights Council in 2006 and its subsequent \r\noperationalization, we have witnessed a key paradigm \r\nshift that clearly distinguishes the Council from its \r\npredecessor. In establishing the Council, United \r\nNations Member States also decided to reject negative \r\npractices such as a coercive or adversarial approach, \r\npoliticization, and naming and shaming, and have \r\ninstead worked together to build an institution based on \r\nthe principles of dialogue, cooperation, consultation \r\nand mutual respect. \r\n As we approach the mandated review of the \r\nCouncil next year, it is Malaysia’s view that Member \r\nStates should focus on reinforcing the strengths of the \r\nCouncil and not on reconstructing, reframing or \r\nunravelling existing arrangements. The review is an \r\nopportunity to take stock and, where necessary, to \r\nmake appropriate adjustments to the institution-\r\n A/65/PV.42\r\n \r\n21 10-61802 \r\n \r\nbuilding package, with a view to enhancing the \r\nCouncil’s effectiveness and efficiency in discharging \r\nits mandate. \r\n It cannot be denied that the establishment of the \r\nCouncil and its many achievements to date, among \r\nwhich is the successful implementation of the \r\nUniversal Periodic Review mechanism, stand out as \r\nconcrete and positive examples of the international \r\ncommunity’s success in promoting and protecting \r\nhuman rights for all. Of course, more can always be \r\ndone to ensure protection for the victims of human \r\nrights violations. \r\n With such considerations in mind, we also \r\nbelieve that as the Council matures into its intended \r\nrole, some thought should be given to streamlining its \r\nwork and increasing its visibility, as well as improving \r\nits working methods. On the latter issue, we disagree \r\nwith criticisms that the Council lacks the capacity to \r\nrespond to human rights situations. In our view, its \r\nresponsiveness has been clearly demonstrated through \r\nits convening of numerous special sessions and urgent \r\ndebates on pressing issues of our times. \r\n My delegation looks forward to the completion of \r\nthe ongoing work in Geneva by the intergovernmental \r\nworking group on the review of the work and \r\nfunctioning of the Human Rights Council. We extend \r\nto them our support both here in the General Assembly \r\nand through our active participation as a member of the \r\nCouncil. \r\n Mindful of the parameters for the current review \r\nprocess, which confine it to the work and functioning \r\nof the Council, my delegation wishes to contribute the \r\nfollowing comments. Firstly, on the Universal Periodic \r\nReview, it is clear that the Review mechanism must be \r\nurgently reviewed, including with regard to its scope \r\nand desired impact, in time for the second Review \r\ncycle. It is important that the principles that underpin \r\nour engagement under the Review process, including \r\nobjectivity, dialogue and cooperation, non-selectivity, \r\nnon-politicization and transparency, be respected and \r\nadhered to within the context of the Review process. \r\nWe reaffirm that the basis of the Review, as well as its \r\nintergovernmental nature, must be retained. Regarding \r\nthe possibility of a gap between the first and second \r\nReview cycles, we stress that spreading future Review \r\ncycles over a five-year period could yield practical \r\nbenefits, including in terms of enhancing stakeholder \r\nparticipation, and that the current order of the Review \r\nshould be preserved to the extent possible, so as to \r\nensure predictability for all States and to enable them \r\nto make adequate preparations for the next Review. \r\nGiven that the second and future Review cycles are a \r\ncontinuing process, my delegation wishes to emphasize \r\nthe importance of closer cooperation and coordination \r\nbetween States and the Office of the High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights, including in the \r\npreparation of the compilation documents. \r\n Secondly, on special procedures, my delegation \r\nreiterates the importance for the special procedures to \r\nrespect and adhere to the code of conduct in \r\ndischarging their mandates. In that connection, my \r\ndelegation wishes to stress that its request and others \r\nlike it should not be misinterpreted as seeking to \r\ninterfere with the independence of the special \r\nprocedures. The positive gains achieved in the process \r\nof nominating, selecting and appointing special \r\nprocedures should be preserved, inter alia through \r\nfurther refining the process of consultation currently in \r\nplace as well as the technical and objective \r\nrequirements for prospective candidates, where \r\nappropriate. My delegation is of the view that the \r\ncurrent duration of country-specific mandates provides \r\nsufficient flexibility for all concerned parties to revisit \r\nparticular situations within one calendar year. \r\n Similarly, on the thematic mandates, my \r\ndelegation envisages no changes and proposes that the \r\ncurrent duration of three years for such mandates be \r\nretained. Additionally, while States are expected to \r\nprovide almost immediate responses to requests for \r\nvisits by the special procedures, the special procedures \r\nshould also reciprocate in a similar fashion when \r\nextended invitations to undertake country visits. \r\n Thirdly, on the Advisory Committee and \r\ncomplaints procedure, my delegation is of the view that \r\nthe Advisory Committee has provided and continues to \r\nprovide a valuable expert component to better inform \r\nthe work of the Council, including on proposals for the \r\nimplementation and operationalization of the Council’s \r\ndecisions. Given its relatively recent establishment and \r\nmindful of the nature of its work, which requires \r\nsignificant time to develop and mature, my delegation \r\nis of the view that the Advisory Committee should be \r\nallowed to function along the present lines. On the \r\ncomplaints procedure, the effectiveness of that \r\nparticular mechanism should not be judged purely on \r\nquantitative grounds. With a view to strengthening the \r\nprinciples of dialogue and cooperation that underpin \r\nA/65/PV.42  \r\n \r\n10-61802 22 \r\n \r\nthe work of the Council and its mechanisms, my \r\ndelegation proposes that current administrative \r\narrangements, which appear discriminatory towards \r\nStates’ representatives appearing before the Council \r\nunder the complaint procedure, be revisited and \r\nchanged as appropriate. \r\n Here in the General Assembly, we have been \r\nfacing, since the establishment of the Council, the issue \r\nof its relationship vis-à-vis the Assembly. This has \r\nshown itself to be a divisive political question and one \r\nthat has been avoided through the practice of splitting \r\nthe item, so that the report of the Council is considered \r\nby both the General Assembly and the Third \r\nCommittee, with the Council’s recommendations \r\nconsidered by the Third Committee. That method was \r\ndevised in the past as a stopgap, but seems to have \r\nachieved our initial overarching goal, namely, to allow \r\nfor the General Assembly to consider and take action \r\non all reports and recommendations from the Council. \r\nWe are, therefore, of the view that the practice can be \r\nretained, as the alternatives would lead to contentious \r\ndebates that would split the Assembly, not necessarily \r\nleading to concrete outcomes, and risk making the \r\nCouncil a tool for the politicization of human rights, as \r\nopposed to being the genuine human rights body it was \r\nintended to be. \r\n On a final note, we wish to acknowledge the \r\ncontribution of non-governmental organizations and \r\nnational human rights institutions to the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights. One of the highly notable \r\nfeatures of the Council is the increased space for the \r\nparticipation of non-governmental organizations and \r\nnational human rights institutions in its work. In order \r\nto ensure the most effective contribution of both \r\nnon-governmental organizations and national human \r\nrights institutions, their participation should be effected \r\nin accordance with the relevant Economic and Social \r\nCouncil and Human Rights Council resolutions \r\ngoverning their involvement. \r\n Mr. Ntwaagae (Botswana): I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Human Rights Council for the report \r\n(A/65/53) under consideration. My delegation \r\nwelcomes the opportunity to participate in \r\ndeliberations under agenda item 63 on the report of the \r\nHuman Rights Council. We thank the President of the \r\nCouncil for his detailed introductory statement. \r\n My delegation attaches great importance to the \r\npromotion and protection of human rights and, in that \r\nregard, we welcome the update on the work carried out \r\nby the Council during the period under review. We note \r\nthat the Human Rights Council has continued to \r\nrespond expeditiously to emerging human rights \r\nsituations around the world, including through special \r\nsessions such as the one convened in January this year \r\nfollowing the tragedy of the earthquake in Haiti. We \r\nfurther note that the Council has also taken decisions \r\non other pressing situations, including that in the \r\noccupied Palestinian territory and the international \r\nprobe on the flotilla raid. \r\n It is important to ensure effective implementation \r\nand follow-up of the decisions and outcomes of Human \r\nRights Council sessions, if the Council is to meet the \r\nexpectations of the victims of human rights violations \r\non the ground. In that connection, while we welcome \r\nthe establishment of new mandates and mechanisms by \r\nthe Council during its fifteenth session, we wish to \r\nemphasize the importance of maintaining a delicate \r\nbalance with existing mandates in order to avoid undue \r\nduplicity. In many cases, it is more important to seek to \r\nstrengthen existing mechanisms and mandates rather \r\nthan have a proliferation of mechanisms when the \r\nimplementation of existing ones already poses \r\nchallenges, especially in terms of funding. \r\n Botswana also welcomes the briefing on the \r\nprocess for the review of the Human Rights Council’s \r\nwork and functioning through the open-ended \r\nintergovernmental working group consultations held \r\nfrom 25 to 29 October 2010. It is encouraging to note \r\nthat the overall assessment of the work of the Council \r\nthus far has been largely positive. \r\n That positive assessment was in part due to its \r\nnew mechanisms, including the Universal Periodic \r\nReview, the complaint procedure, the special \r\nprocedures and the Advisory Committee — in all a \r\nvery strong institutional framework that has been put \r\ntogether to ensure that the Council delivers effectively \r\non its mandate. It was the product of a carefully \r\nnegotiated institution-building text, and we hope its \r\nbalance will be maintained while seeking to strengthen \r\nits implementation during the review exercise. \r\n We view the introduction of the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review mechanism as a major innovation and \r\nbelieve that, while many challenges still remain to be \r\naddressed, the Review has provided sufficient proof of \r\na departure of the Council from its predecessor, the \r\nCommission on Human Rights, in terms of \r\n A/65/PV.42\r\n \r\n23 10-61802 \r\n \r\ndepoliticizing human rights, upholding objectivity and \r\navoiding selectivity and the application of double \r\nstandards in the treatment of human rights. \r\n Special procedures have also been a very \r\neffective tool in advancing the global human rights \r\nagenda. In that regard, we are pleased to state that \r\nBotswana has cooperated with the mandate holders at \r\nthe Human Rights Council, including through \r\nfacilitating their country visits to Botswana. We believe \r\nthat the special procedures play a crucial role in the \r\nwork of the Human Rights Council. Their thematic \r\nreports and recommendations have assisted Member \r\nStates in many ways with respect to approaches to the \r\npromotion and protection of human rights. \r\n There are general concerns regarding the conduct \r\nof some special procedures mandate holders that have \r\nsurfaced, both in sessions of the Human Rights Council \r\nand in the Third Committee deliberations. Member \r\nStates have increasingly pointed to the tendency of \r\nmandate holders to go beyond the mandates that they \r\nhave been given by the Council and, as a result, \r\nproduce reports that do not meet expectations. \r\n Botswana is convinced that that observation is \r\nvalid to the extent that it does not discount the fact that \r\nMember States may in some instances hold views that \r\ndiffer with the recommendations of the special \r\nprocedures mandate holders. Furthermore, it is \r\nimportant to emphasize that the concerns of Member \r\nStates in that regard should not be misconstrued as an \r\naffront on the integrity and independence of the \r\nmandate holders. \r\n We remain concerned that a few delegations \r\ncontinue to try to perpetuate such unprofessional \r\nconduct by invoking the independence of mandate \r\nholders. That approach will only serve to undermine \r\nthe system of special procedures, the work of the \r\nHuman Rights Council and the United Nations human \r\nrights system in general. \r\n My delegation recommends that the Human \r\nRights Council consider instituting strict standards of \r\nprofessional conduct for the implementation of \r\nmandates through special procedures in order to \r\nmitigate such unprofessionalism. That will ensure that \r\nthe Council is compensated for its time and other \r\nresources, as the special procedures process would thus \r\nproduce reports and recommendations solely to serve \r\nmultilateral interests rather than the narrow agenda of a \r\nfew. \r\n Allow me to conclude by reaffirming Botswana’s \r\ncommitment to support the work of mandate holders in \r\nthe discharge of their mandates as part of our overall \r\nconviction that the work of the Human Rights Council \r\nremains valuable to the United Nations human rights \r\nsystem. \r\n We do so trusting that strengthening the \r\nparticipation of stakeholders, including civil society \r\nrepresentatives, is a way to respect the \r\nintergovernmental nature of the United Nations system \r\nand to acknowledge the responsibility of Member \r\nStates to implement their obligations. \r\n As the global human rights watchdog, the Human \r\nRights Council has a very important mandate to \r\ndischarge. Expectations on that score are high. The \r\nburden remains on all of us to ensure that the ideals \r\ncontained in the Council’s founding resolution 60/251 \r\nof the General Assembly and the institution-building \r\nframework contained in Human Rights Council \r\nresolution 5/1 are fully implemented, including through \r\nthe ongoing review process. \r\n Mr. Errázuriz (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nwelcome the introduction made today by the President \r\nof the Human Rights Council to the Assembly, as well \r\nas the Council’s significant and comprehensive reports \r\n(A/65/53). \r\n Promoting and respecting human rights is one of \r\nthe three pillars of the United Nations and one of the \r\nmajor pillars of Chile’s foreign policy. Thus, Chile \r\nplayed a prominent role in the negotiations leading up \r\nto the Council’s establishment. When the review \r\nprocess called for in founding resolution 60/251 started \r\nin New York, Chile lent its full support to the task of \r\nimproving the work of the Council. The result after \r\nthese five years has been positive. \r\n Chile is ready to examine the issue of whether the \r\ncomposition of the Council is best suited to meet the \r\nrequirements of protecting and promoting human rights \r\nand whether it should be one of the principal organs of \r\nthe United Nations, as are the Councils responsible for \r\npeace and security and for economic and social affairs. \r\n However, without referring to prior events, Chile \r\nbelieves that the New York process must be approached \r\nwith pragmatic criteria, not with an effort to reinvent \r\nthe resolution that established the Council, but rather \r\nby making the necessary adjustments to improve its \r\nfunctioning and render it more effective in the field of \r\nA/65/PV.42  \r\n \r\n10-61802 24 \r\n \r\nhuman rights and in its ability to address any \r\nemergencies that may arise in that sector. \r\n Chile believes that civil society has a primary \r\nrole to play in the review process. Here, the seminars \r\nthat have been held with the active participation of \r\ncivil society representatives are of the greatest \r\nimportance. We trust that those exercises will be held \r\nin a timely fashion in this forum. \r\n Of essential importance to the smooth functioning \r\nof the Council is cooperation among Member States. \r\nThat is one of the fundamental differences between the \r\nCouncil and the former Commission of Human Rights. \r\nChile believes that, despite the many endeavours \r\nundertaken by the Council, it is possible to do more. \r\nWithout any doubt, Member States primarily and in the \r\nfinal analysis bear responsibility for protecting and \r\npromoting human rights in their countries and for \r\nagreeing to cooperate when necessary. \r\n The first five years of the Council’s life have \r\nshown clear progress in ways that human rights can be \r\ndealt with by Member States, in particular through the \r\nUniversal Periodic Review mechanism, to which all \r\nMember States are subject. That is a universal, \r\ntransparent and inclusive process that avoids double \r\nstandards and selectivity. Chile submitted its report this \r\nyear. \r\n This year, my country also introduced its first \r\nreport on the implementation of Convention No. 169 of \r\nthe International Labour Organization, and Chile’s \r\nHuman Rights Institute was established. \r\n On 8 December 2009, under the aegis of the \r\nHuman Rights Council, Chile deposited its ratification \r\ninstrument for the International Convention for the \r\nProtection of All Persons from Enforced \r\nDisappearance. By that act and pursuant to article 32 of \r\nthe Convention, Chile acknowledged the Committee’s \r\ncompetence to receive and consider communications \r\nwhen a Member State charges another Member State \r\nwith not observing the obligations of the Convention. \r\nMy Government has reiterated its open invitation to the \r\nrapporteurs of the United Nations human rights system \r\nto visit our country. \r\n Lastly, with respect to the review of working \r\nmethods, I wish to draw attention to the Chilean and \r\nArgentinean proposal submitted in Geneva to improve \r\nthe efficiency of the special procedures while \r\ncontinuing to protect their independence. Chile’s firm \r\ncommitment to promoting and defending human rights \r\nhas been fully expressed through its role as a member \r\nof the Human Rights Council, and we trust that we will \r\nbe able to continue to do that in the coming years, if so \r\ndecided by the Member States of the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Mrs. Aitimova (Kazakhstan): Let me thank His \r\nExcellency Ambassador Sihasak Phuangketkeow, \r\nPresident of the Human Rights Council, for his well-\r\ngrounded and comprehensive report on human rights \r\nissues. My delegation highly appreciates the devoted \r\nand substantive work of the Human Rights Council on \r\na broad range of rights issues involving various social \r\ngroups, as well as human rights in pressing situations. \r\nIt should be recognized that considerable work was \r\ndone by the Council during its fourth cycle. My \r\ndelegation would like to underline the thorough and \r\nprompt reaction of the Council aimed at promoting the \r\nprotection of human rights in numerous emergency \r\nsituations and armed conflicts, as well as at mitigating \r\nthe adverse impacts of the economic and financial \r\ncrisis. \r\n First of all, let me touch upon issues relating to \r\nthe internal functioning of the Council. My delegation \r\nsupports the establishment of an open-ended \r\nintergovernmental working group to review the work \r\nand functioning of the Human Rights Council. The \r\nforthcoming review of the methodology and strategic \r\napproaches of the Council places additional \r\nresponsibilities on the members of that body. \r\n My delegation fully supports the request to \r\nprovide the working group with the necessary \r\nresources and facilities for it to carry out its mandate. \r\nIn that regard, Kazakhstan expects that all relevant \r\nstakeholders, such as civil society, academia and \r\nUnited Nations Member States, will be fully engaged \r\nin the review process, including by providing their \r\nreflections and interests in the future activities in the \r\nupdated mandate. My delegation looks forward to \r\nconsidering the working group’s outcome document, \r\nwhich will be drafted in Geneva. \r\n Further, Kazakhstan expresses its support for the \r\nnewly established mandates of the Special Rapporteur \r\non the right to freedom of association and peaceful \r\nassembly and a working group on the elimination of \r\ndiscrimination against women in law and in practice. \r\nWe believe that those mandates will bridge the existing \r\ngap between internationally agreed commitments and \r\n A/65/PV.42\r\n \r\n25 10-61802 \r\n \r\ntheir implementation on the ground. At the same time, \r\nin accordance with the code of conduct for mandate \r\nholders, Kazakhstan calls upon United Nations special \r\nprocedures to remain committed to exercising their \r\nfunctions in accordance with the framework of their \r\nmandate. That will avoid duplication and deviation \r\nfrom mandates. \r\n My country fully recognizes and supports the \r\nauthority of United Nations representatives and \r\nmechanisms in the field of human rights as effective \r\ntools with which to leverage the promotion and \r\nprotection of rights and basic freedoms. Confirming its \r\nwillingness to strengthen and pursue transparent and \r\nconstructive cooperation with all partners, Kazakhstan \r\nhas issued an open invitation to all mandate holders of \r\nHuman Rights Council special procedures. \r\n Thanks to our Government’s ratification of the \r\nSecond Optional Protocol to the International Covenant \r\non Civil and Political Rights, the citizens of \r\nKazakhstan have gained the opportunity to appeal to \r\nthe United Nations Commission on Human Rights \r\nregarding alleged violations of their civil and political \r\nrights. In that area, Kazakhstan has also taken \r\nmeasures to improve the available national human \r\nrights protection mechanisms in order to deal with a \r\nsignificant number of complaints before they are sent \r\nto the international institution of human rights \r\nprotection, thereby addressing citizens’ appeals and \r\ncomplaints within the country. As of January 2007, \r\nKazakhstan has made efforts to improve the national \r\nlaw entitled “On the Procedure for the Investigation of \r\nthe Appeals of Physical and Legal Persons” and to \r\nenhance the effectiveness of the consideration of \r\ncitizens’ appeals by judicial and local executive bodies. \r\n It should be noted that Kazakhstan successfully \r\nintroduced, at the February to March 2010 session of \r\nthe United Nations Committee on the Elimination of \r\nRacial Discrimination, its combined fourth and fifth \r\nnational reports on the implementation of the \r\nprovisions of the International Convention on the \r\nElimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. In \r\nNovember 2008, the United Nations Committee against \r\nTorture considered Kazakhstan’s second national report \r\non the implementation of the United Nations \r\nConvention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman \r\nor Degrading Treatment or Punishment, along with a \r\nshadow report submitted by non-governmental human \r\nrights organizations. \r\n In its Concluding Observations based on \r\nKazakhstan’s second report and the shadow report, the \r\nUnited Nations Committee against Torture made more \r\nthan 20 recommendations regarding the legislative, \r\ninstitutional and procedural aspects of preventing and \r\neffectively combating torture. The United Nations \r\nHuman Rights Council welcomed the information of \r\nthe representative of the Government of my country on \r\nthe measures undertaken by my country to implement \r\nthe recommendations made by the United Nations \r\nCommittee against Torture. \r\n Kazakhstan has also ratified a range of \r\ninternational documents in the sphere of human rights \r\nprotection. In harmonizing its national legislation with \r\ninternational standards, Kazakhstan signed the \r\nOptional Protocol to the International Convention on \r\nEconomical, Social and Cultural Rights and ratified the \r\nHague Convention on Protection of Children and \r\nCooperation in respect of Intercountry Adoption. In \r\norder to improve human rights protection mechanisms, \r\na national action plan for 2009-2012 and the Outline of \r\na Legal Policy of the State for 2010-2020 were \r\nadopted. \r\n Kazakhstan commends the constructive activities \r\nof the Human Rights Council. Recognizing the human \r\ndimension as a pillar of a stable society, Kazakhstan \r\npresented its candidature to that Charter-based body for \r\nthe term 2012-2015. If elected, Kazakhstan pledges to \r\nfurther enhance the credibility and effectiveness of the \r\nHuman Rights Council and to strengthen the capacity \r\nof the Universal Periodic Review, the first cycle of \r\nwhich Kazakhstan successfully underwent last \r\nFebruary. My Government intends to make every effort \r\nto fully implement the recommendations of the \r\nUniversal Periodic Review suggested by United \r\nNations Member States, non-governmental \r\norganizations, United Nations treaty bodies and the \r\nspecial procedures of the Human Rights Council. \r\n Mr. Seck (Senegal) (spoke in French): I would \r\nfirst of all like to commend the remarkable work done \r\nby the Human Rights Council this year and to express \r\nmy delegation’s sincere appreciation to its President, \r\nHis Excellency Ambassador Sihasak Phuangketkeow, \r\nfor the quality of his report. \r\n Thanks to the joint efforts of its members and the \r\nentire international community, the Human Rights \r\nCouncil is, after only five years in existence, sending \r\npositive signs of its capacity to meet the expectations \r\nA/65/PV.42  \r\n \r\n10-61802 26 \r\n \r\nof its members by constantly improving its working \r\nmethods to make itself more efficient. Indeed, the \r\nimportant resolutions and decisions adopted during its \r\nfifteenth ordinary session not only clearly demonstrate \r\nthe progress made by the Council, but also reflect its \r\ndynamism. \r\n Moreover, in the context of that positive \r\ndynamism, it is worth noting the establishment, during \r\nthe recent session of the Council, of a working group \r\nof experts to examine the issue of discrimination \r\nagainst women in law and in practice, which will \r\ncertainly help, through its recommendations, to further \r\npromote the rights of women. That is an extremely \r\nwelcome milestone, on the heels of which we should \r\nnote and welcome the appointment of the Special \r\nRapporteur on the right to freedom of association and \r\npeaceful assembly, which is likely to strengthen our \r\noptimism about the future of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. \r\n Such results and the many others that have \r\npreceded them demonstrate — if there were still any \r\nneed to do so — that, after just a few years, the Human \r\nRights Council is on the right track to provide \r\nappropriate responses to the situations that need its \r\nattention. However, rather than allowing us to rest \r\ncomplacently on our laurels, the positive \r\ndevelopments, which give rise both to hopes and to \r\nexpectations, should encourage us to step up our efforts \r\nto strengthen the Council and to improve its \r\nfunctioning, where necessary. \r\n From that standpoint, while continuing its work \r\nto promote dialogue and respect for cultural diversity \r\nand to raise awareness of human rights, the Human \r\nRights Council should focus more on the various \r\naspects linked to the right to development, including \r\nthe question of combating poverty, which is an obstacle \r\nthat a large part of humanity faces. \r\n We are convinced that respect for all human \r\nrights without distinction, including the right to \r\ndevelopment, is one of the main guarantees of peace \r\nand stability at the national and international levels. \r\nThat is why my delegation believes that the Council \r\nshould focus more on issues such as the impact of the \r\nglobal economic and financial crises on the realization \r\nof human rights. That would enable it to focus its work \r\neven more closely on the daily realities throughout the \r\nworld. \r\n Another reason for the satisfaction felt by my \r\ndelegation and many actors on the international scene \r\nis, without any doubt, the Universal Periodic Review \r\nmechanism, which the Secretary-General described as \r\nopening a new chapter in human rights promotion and \r\nunderscoring the universality of those rights. \r\n After having reviewed more than 120 countries, \r\nthat mechanism has confirmed our hunch that, by \r\npooling our efforts, it would be possible to establish, \r\namong the various actors, an objective, constructive \r\nand transparent dialogue that could help strengthen the \r\ncredibility of the Human Rights Council. The \r\nUniversal Periodic Review has demonstrated that it is \r\npossible to consider the issue of human rights in an \r\nimpartial approach free of any politicization. \r\n However, the capacity of that mechanism to \r\neffectively contribute to the promotion and protection \r\nof human rights will be measured only by the \r\nimplementation of the recommendations it makes. It is \r\nour joint responsibility to work for the success of that \r\nundertaking, which will make it possible to ensure a \r\nbetter protection of human rights and preservation of \r\nhuman dignity. \r\n In order to preserve and strengthen the \r\nachievements of the Human Rights Council, but also to \r\nreaffirm its commitment to the principles of the \r\nuniversality, interdependence, non-selectivity and \r\nindivisibility of human rights, Senegal will continue, as \r\nin the past, to seek to bolster the foundations for a \r\nfrank and constructive dialogue within the Council. \r\n In accordance with the provisions of paragraph \r\n16 of resolution 60/251, we will undertake, during the \r\npresent session, a review of the functioning of that \r\nbody, the enlargement of which would ensure that all \r\nStates Members of the United Nations are represented. \r\nThe first meeting of the working group on the review \r\nof the functioning of the Human Rights Council, held \r\nin Geneva last week, will show that, although that new \r\nbody has certainly achieved positive results, some \r\nimperfections, inherited from the former Human Rights \r\nCommission, hamper its smooth operation. \r\n Thus, for us, the review process must provide the \r\nopportunity for a frank evaluation of the work of the \r\nHuman Rights Council in order to make the necessary \r\nchanges enabling it to better deal with the challenges \r\nthat we must address in the area of human rights. \r\n A/65/PV.42\r\n \r\n27 10-61802 \r\n \r\n My delegation expresses its readiness to provide \r\nits support and cooperation to the two co-facilitators \r\nappointed by the President of the General Assembly to \r\nconduct that process. We would like, in that \r\nconnection, to express our sincere congratulations and \r\nwishes for every success to the Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of Morocco and Liechtenstein. \r\n Mr. Waxman (Israel): It is with dismay and \r\ndisappointment that I address this gathering as we \r\nconsider the recent report (A/65/53) of the Human \r\nRights Council. According to its founding instruments, \r\nthat Council — one of the leading United Nations \r\nhuman rights bodies — is required to conduct its work \r\nbased on the principles of universality, impartiality, \r\nobjectivity and non-selectivity without distinction of \r\nany kind and in a fair and equal manner. It is, \r\ntherefore, most unfortunate that the Human Rights \r\nCouncil has, time and again, betrayed its responsibility \r\nand its founding principles by turning a blind eye to the \r\nworst human rights violations throughout the world, \r\nwhile conveniently and obsessively focusing on Israel. \r\n Today’s report and the series of draft resolutions \r\nthat it contains show just how far the Human Rights \r\nCouncil has strayed from those founding principles. \r\nOnce again, that forum has been manipulated to serve \r\nthe most cynical of political motivations. Once again, it \r\nhas failed to live up to its responsibility to address \r\nhuman rights abuses around the world, while at the \r\nsame time pursuing a narrow, politicized agenda. \r\n Any objective examination of the Council’s \r\nrecent report would confirm its prejudice against Israel. \r\nAbout half of the country-specific resolutions \r\ncontained in the report that do not deal with technical \r\nassistance are targeted exclusively at Israel. That is a \r\nglaring example of the Council’s profound institutional \r\nbias. Furthermore, since the creation of the Council, 12 \r\nof its 15 regular sessions have adopted one-sided \r\nresolutions condemning Israel and six of the 13 special \r\nsessions of the Council have been devoted specifically \r\nto singling out my country. \r\n I would also note that the Human Rights \r\nCouncil’s agenda item 7 is its only standing agenda \r\nitem concerned with a particular country situation, \r\nsingling it out from all other 191 country situations. \r\nThat fact stands in marked contrast to the basic notions \r\nof fairness and impartiality and is inconsistent with the \r\nletter and spirit of the Council’s constitutive \r\ninstrument, embodied in General Assembly resolution \r\n60/251. \r\n The politicized nature of that Council was \r\ndemonstrated again by its response to the 31 May \r\nincident involving vessels bound for the Gaza Strip. \r\nThe Council found it appropriate to adopt resolution \r\n14/1 condemning Israel only two days after that \r\nincident, without any verifiable factual information \r\nabout what had actually occurred. The Council’s report \r\n(A/HRC/15/21) on that incident embodies the same \r\nspirit of wilful ignorance, making it clear that the \r\nCouncil prefers to perpetuate inflammatory language \r\nand a politicized agenda instead of pursuing the truth. \r\n The biased manner in which the Human Rights \r\nCouncil handled that incident is simply unacceptable. \r\nIn contrast, even as we speak, an objective, thorough \r\nand independent investigation of the incident is taking \r\nplace in Israel. Furthermore, Israel has agreed to \r\nparticipate in the Secretary-General’s Panel of Inquiry \r\non that matter and will share the findings of its internal \r\ninvestigation with the Panel’s experts. \r\n Israel, a vibrant democracy with an active civil \r\nsociety and an internationally respected independent \r\njudiciary, has demonstrated, time and again, its strong \r\ncommitment to engaging in a candid and professional \r\ndialogue in various United Nations forums, including \r\nbefore the Council’s Universal Periodic Review and its \r\nspecial rapporteurs. However, one cannot accept such a \r\nmisguided report. \r\n Countless victims of human rights around the \r\nworld cry out for their plight to be heard. All too often, \r\nthe Human Rights Council is silent. That should, \r\nhowever, come as no surprise, considering that some of \r\nthe world’s worst human rights violators sit on the \r\nCouncil and, all too often, dictate its proceedings. \r\n By failing to fulfil its fundamental mandate, the \r\nHuman Rights Council undermines not only its own \r\nlegitimacy, but also the ability of the United Nations to \r\neffectively promote and protect its founding values. \r\n Mr. Barton (United States of America): We join \r\nour fellow members in welcoming the President of the \r\nHuman Rights Council, and we thank him for the \r\nreport of the Council’s activities during the past year \r\n(A/65/53), the first report during the United States \r\nmembership on the Council. \r\n The report before us is a reflection of both the \r\nCouncil’s strengths and its weaknesses. Over the past \r\nA/65/PV.42  \r\n \r\n10-61802 28 \r\n \r\nyear, we have been proud to participate in many of the \r\nCouncil’s resolutions, particularly those establishing \r\nspecial procedures for the freedom of association and \r\ndiscrimination against women, and also those \r\nregarding freedom of opinion and expression, violence \r\nagainst women, trafficking in persons, the protection of \r\nhuman rights defenders, and the protection of the \r\nhuman rights of those with HIV and AIDS. We have \r\nalso been encouraged by several instances of cross-\r\nregional players working together to address human \r\nrights problems. \r\n Furthermore, we were pleased to participate in \r\nthe adoption of several resolutions that called attention \r\nto human rights situations in specific countries, most \r\nrecently through the renewal of the mandate of the \r\nindependent expert on the situation of human rights in \r\nthe Sudan. Those resolutions will help protect and \r\npromote human rights around the world and are \r\nexamples of what we can accomplish when we work \r\ntogether. \r\n However, we continue to be disappointed by the \r\nCouncil’s unbalanced and one-sided approach to the \r\nhuman rights situation in Israel and the Palestinian \r\nterritories. The Council should treat all countries in an \r\nunbiased, objective manner. As the report notes, in the \r\npast year the Council has passed multiple resolutions \r\nthat target Israel. The United States could not, and does \r\nnot, support those resolutions for many reasons, largely \r\nbecause they attempt to delegitimize the Government \r\nof Israel and make no mention of the serious violations \r\nof international law deliberately committed by Hamas. \r\n That continuing bias is further evident in the \r\nCouncil’s hasty resolution establishing a fact-finding \r\nmission with a flawed mandate to investigate the tragic \r\nincident aboard the Gaza-bound ships in late May and \r\nthe Council’s resolution following up on the fact- \r\n \r\nfinding mission’s report. We also oppose the follow-up \r\nresolution’s recommendation that the General \r\nAssembly consider the report of the fact-finding \r\nmission (A/HRC/15/21), which itself did not \r\nrecommend further United Nations action. We \r\ncommend the Secretary-General’s constructive \r\ninitiative in convening a panel that will receive and \r\nreview the results of Israel’s and Turkey’s \r\ninvestigations, and we welcome the spirit of \r\ncooperation that it represents. We continue to regard \r\nthat panel as the primary method for the international \r\ncommunity to review the incident. \r\n When we joined the Council last year, we came \r\nwilling to support what the Council does well, but we \r\nalso promised to challenge old habits that undermine \r\nits effectiveness and its mandate. It is in that spirit that \r\nwe will engage actively in the 2011 review. In addition \r\nto improving the mechanics and procedures of the \r\nCouncil, we look to working with other Member States \r\nto strengthen the Council’s response to gross and \r\nsystemic violations of human rights wherever they \r\noccur, to establish methods of work to better \r\nimplement the existing criteria for Council \r\nmembership, and to strengthen the independence and \r\nfunctioning of special procedure mandate holders. \r\n Our work on the Council will continue to be \r\nguided by the ongoing steadfast commitment of the \r\nUnited States to human rights and to the four tenets \r\nthat we espoused when we took our seat on the \r\nCouncil: the universality of human rights, dialogue \r\namong nations and people, principled engagement, and \r\nfidelity to the truth. We will continue to work together \r\nwith our fellow Council members to strengthen the \r\nCouncil’s work in order to fulfil its mission and to \r\nrealize the aspirations and principles embodied in the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. \r\n  The meeting rose at 1.05 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
