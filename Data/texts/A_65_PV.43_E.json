(Switzerland) \r\n \r\n \r\n  In the absence of the President, Mr. Ntwaagae \r\n(Botswana), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 3 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 63 (continued) \r\n \r\nReport of the Human Rights Council \r\n \r\n  Report of the Human Rights Council (A/65/53 \r\nand Corr.1 and A/65/53/Add.1) \r\n \r\n Mr. Leucă (Republic of Moldova): The \r\ndelegation of the Republic of Moldova associates itself \r\nwith the statement delivered earlier today by the \r\nrepresentative of Belgium on behalf of the European \r\nUnion. I should now like to add some remarks in my \r\nnational capacity. \r\n First, I would like to thank Ambassador Sihasak \r\nPhuangketkeow, President of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, for introducing the Council’s report (A/65/53 \r\nand A/65/53/Add.1) to the General Assembly, as well \r\nas to congratulate Ambassador Ivan Šimonović on his \r\nassignment as Assistant Secretary-General for Human \r\nRights to lead the Office of the High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights in New York. Their leadership in \r\nmanaging the complexity of human rights activities \r\nand instruments under the United Nations umbrella is \r\nof great importance for the effective realization of the \r\ngoals of the Council, as voiced and shared by all \r\nMember States. \r\n The report of the Human Rights Council reflects \r\nthe diversity and intricacy of the human rights \r\nsituations in various States, as well as the multiple and \r\nsustained measures undertaken both by Governments \r\nand the United Nations system to improve and promote \r\nhuman rights around the world. The Council has \r\nregistered considerable progress through thematic \r\nresolutions related to torture, human trafficking, the \r\nrights of the child and violence against women that \r\nhave a positive impact on the ground. These policies \r\nwill be supported by every country, and jointly by the \r\ninternational community. \r\n One of the recent accomplishments of the Human \r\nRights Council was the consensus adoption of the \r\nUnited Nations declaration on human rights education \r\nand training, initiated by the Platform on Human \r\nRights Education and Training. We hope that this \r\ndeclaration will serve as an important engine for the \r\nimplementation of the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights and as a practical tool for promoting \r\nunderstanding and disseminating information about \r\nhuman rights. \r\n Although since its establishment, in 2006, the \r\ncredibility and capacity of the Council to address \r\nhuman rights issues at the global level effectively and \r\nwithout selectively has been subjected to controversial \r\ndebates on several occasions, the Human Rights \r\nCouncil has proved its relevance and vital role in \r\npromoting the fundamental values of human rights \r\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter. We believe \r\nthat these discussions should become more \r\nconstructive and that, in the framework of the review \r\nprocess, we have to strike a sensible balance between \r\nwhat has been accomplished already and the gaps and \r\nA/65/PV.43  \r\n \r\n10-61876 2 \r\n \r\nlimitations we must overcome in order to achieve the \r\ncommitments articulated in resolution 60/251. \r\n As a member of the Human Rights Council, the \r\nRepublic of Moldova strongly advocates in favour of \r\nthe appropriate implementation of the Council’s \r\ninstitution-building package, adopted in 2007, along \r\nwith the application of new and transformative \r\nelements of the Universal Periodic Review Mechanism, \r\nthe Advisory Committee, the complaints procedure and \r\nthe special procedure mechanisms. These instruments \r\nare essential for the prevention of human rights \r\nviolations and for carrying out country evaluations and \r\nadvancing tailored recommendations. The interactive \r\ndialogue with Special Rapporteurs, concluded \r\nyesterday in the Third Committee, confirmed the \r\nvaluable inputs brought by the special procedure \r\nmechanism for the protection of human rights and the \r\nincreasing interest of Member States to cooperate and \r\nwork closely with the special mandate holders. \r\n My country has its own experience of \r\ncooperating under the special procedures with the \r\nSpecial Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman \r\nor degrading treatment or punishment and the Special \r\nRapporteur on violence against women, who visited \r\nMoldova in 2008 and 2009 upon the invitation of the \r\nGovernment. We are pleased that this exercise was of \r\nbenefit to the Government in helping to highlight areas \r\nwhere additional resources, capacity-building activities \r\nand the adoption of relevant laws were required. The \r\ncommitment of my Government to further increase \r\ncooperation under special procedures resulted in the \r\nextension of a standing invitation to the relevant \r\nmandate holders, as we entrusted them with the \r\nimportant role of safeguarding, monitoring and \r\nadvising on the human rights agenda. In the same vein, \r\nwe will present our national report under the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review Mechanism in 2011. \r\n Important factors in accurately carrying out \r\nspecial procedures include the requirements to strictly \r\nfollow the mandates assigned, rely on existing \r\ninstruments and standards in the field of human rights \r\nand pursue country assessments and reporting in \r\naccordance with those directives. That must be done to \r\nensure that the mechanism does not go beyond existing \r\nregulations or alter the meaning and the aim of the \r\nspecial procedures. \r\n While special mandate holders’ recommendations \r\nare important for the streamlining of the human rights \r\nprotection agenda, it is equally essential to put in place \r\na follow-up mechanism for the elaboration of \r\nguidelines and support for their practical \r\nimplementation. In this respect, we envisage close \r\ncooperation between the Council and the High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights to assist States in \r\nupholding human rights while preserving the \r\nindependence of the High Commissioner, in conformity \r\nwith the mandate adopted by the General Assembly in \r\nresolution 48/141. \r\n The implementation of the Universal Periodic \r\nReview Mechanism as a unique tool to review the \r\nhuman rights record of each Member State is currently \r\nthe pre-eminent State-driven process whereby all \r\ncountries are treated equally and on the basis of \r\nobjective and consistent reporting information. At the \r\nsame time, strengthening the Mechanism and \r\nenhancing the High Commissioner’s role in building \r\nnational capabilities for the implementation of action-\r\noriented recommendations is the key modality to \r\naccelerate and improve the functioning of the Council. \r\nAccordingly, while assessing the performance of the \r\nCouncil, it is essential to streamline the Mechanism’s \r\nreview sessions to ensure more constructive and \r\nsubstantial discussions by Member States. Moreover, \r\nprovided that in 2011 the Council will have reviewed \r\nthe human rights records of every country, we will \r\nneed to consider measures to help States to implement \r\nthe recommendations emanating from the review, as \r\nwell as international instruments in the field of human \r\nrights, through technical assistance, best practices and \r\nlessons learned. \r\n Along the same lines, we consider it necessary to \r\ngenerate more synergy between the Council and United \r\nNations human rights agencies and instruments in \r\norder to avoid duplication of activities and projects in \r\nthe field. Ensuring cohesion in the United Nations \r\nsystem in this area is a complex exercise, but it is of \r\ngreat importance for strong United Nations human \r\nrights action to meet the expectations of peoples. It is \r\ntherefore up to us to encourage all Member States to \r\nvigorously cooperate in order to ensure that the \r\ndialogue established under the Universal Periodic \r\nReview Mechanism is indeed universal and inclusive \r\nof all. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to highlight that, as a \r\nmember of the Human Rights Council, the Republic of \r\nMoldova is committed to continuing to fulfil its \r\nindividual pledges and to doing its utmost to strengthen \r\n A/65/PV.43\r\n \r\n3 10-61876 \r\n \r\nthis important body and its results-oriented \r\nmechanisms, including ensuring its impartiality and \r\nuniversality. \r\n Mr. McLay (New Zealand): New Zealand \r\nwelcomes the President of the Human Rights Council, \r\nAmbassador Phuangketkeow, and thanks him for \r\npresenting the Council’s fifth annual report (A/65/53 \r\nand A/65/53/Add.1). We would also like to take this \r\nopportunity to thank, and acknowledge the work of, his \r\npredecessor, Ambassador Alex Van Meeuwen. \r\n New Zealand remains a firm supporter of the \r\nHuman Rights Council, which plays an important role \r\nas the principal human rights body of the United \r\nNations. As we take stock of another year, we are \r\npleased to acknowledge some recent positive \r\ndevelopments in the Council’s work. In particular, an \r\nincreased spirit of cross-regionalism has been evident, \r\nsuch as with the resolution establishing a new mandate \r\non the freedom of assembly and association, which was \r\nbrought to the Council by a group of seven States \r\nrepresenting five different regional groups. \r\n In New Zealand’s case this year, we were \r\nhonoured to work in partnership with Burkina Faso and \r\nColombia on several initiatives on preventable \r\nmaternal mortality and morbidity and human rights. \r\nThis shows that, working cross-regionally, the Council \r\ncan avoid some of the problems that plagued its \r\npredecessor, the Commission on Human Rights, and \r\nenable it better to fulfil its mandate. \r\n The credibility of the Council will of course \r\nalways be judged by its ability to respond to serious \r\nhuman rights violations. We welcome the fact that, \r\nover the past year, the Council has increasingly used \r\nthe various tools at its disposal in formal and informal \r\nsessions. The recent discussions on mass rapes in the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and the debate on \r\nSomalia are good examples of the Council using a \r\nrange of different tools to consider critical situations \r\neffectively and in a timely manner. \r\n We also regard the Universal Periodic Review \r\nMechanism, the ninth session of which is presently \r\nunder way, as a useful addition to the United Nations \r\nhuman rights machinery. We continue to see great \r\nvalue in the Council’s system of special procedures. \r\n New Zealand is among those countries that have \r\nextended standing invitations to special procedures \r\nmandate holders. This year, we were pleased to \r\nwelcome to New Zealand Professor James Anaya, \r\nSpecial Rapporteur on the situation of human rights \r\nand fundamental freedoms of indigenous people. The \r\nscrutiny afforded by the special procedures system \r\nallows for engagement with leading human rights \r\nexperts. That visit was a welcome opportunity to assess \r\nprogress on indigenous rights in New Zealand. \r\n We appreciate these and other positive elements \r\nof the Council’s work, but much remains to be done. In \r\nthat regard, the Council’s ongoing review of its work \r\nand functioning provides all stakeholders with an \r\nopportunity to consider how to enhance the \r\neffectiveness of the Council. This is an important \r\nopportunity, although it must be borne in mind that the \r\nCouncil’s existing institutional structure contains \r\nunder-utilized elements that could be better \r\nimplemented. \r\n Turning now to the review itself, we are carefully \r\nconsidering all of the proposals made in Geneva last \r\nweek during the first session of the open-ended \r\nworking group on the work and functioning of the \r\nCouncil. Our aim for, and our expectation of, that \r\nreview is simple: to improve the Council’s ability to \r\npromote and protect human rights. In particular, we see \r\nvalue in proposals that would improve the Council’s \r\nability to address critical human rights situations, \r\nwherever they occur; improve the action-oriented \r\nnature of the Council’s work while allowing for \r\nfollow-up where necessary and enhanced coordination \r\nwith other branches of the United Nations system, \r\nincluding the Third Committee and specialized \r\nagencies; provide for a more balanced, transparent, \r\npredictable and streamlined programme of work and \r\nenhance the universality of the Universal Periodic \r\nReview Mechanism and make better use of the work of \r\nspecial procedures. \r\n We regard the input of other Council \r\nstakeholders, including of national human rights \r\ninstitutions and civil society, as integral to the review \r\nprocess as it is to the Council’s work in general. We \r\nsupport the President’s aim of completing the review of \r\nthe work and functioning of the Council in Geneva by \r\nMarch 2011, thus allowing sufficient time here in New \r\nYork for the related review of the Council’s status. \r\n New Zealand congratulates the President on his \r\nable efforts to lead the review process during his \r\ninformal consultations and at last week’s working \r\ngroup meeting. We commend especially his role in \r\nA/65/PV.43  \r\n \r\n10-61876 4 \r\n \r\nbringing together the various regional groups and \r\nbuilding a basis for consensus. \r\n Human rights constitutes one of the three \r\nfundamental pillars on which the United Nations was \r\nfounded. Mainstreaming human rights throughout the \r\nUnited Nations system is at the heart of the mandate of \r\nthe Human Rights Council. New Zealand is hopeful \r\nthat the positive elements we have observed this year \r\nwill continue and that the review of the Council will \r\nmove it further towards the objectives for which it was \r\noriginally established. \r\n Mr. Apakan (Turkey): First of all, I wish to \r\nextend our gratitude to the President of the Human \r\nRights Council for his statement today. We appreciate \r\nhis able leadership of the Council. He has Turkey’s full \r\nsupport. Yesterday, we made a statement in the Third \r\nCommittee on the report of the Human Rights Council. \r\nTherefore, today I will keep my remarks brief. \r\n We welcome the Human Rights Council report \r\ncontained in document A/65/53 and its addendum. The \r\nreport and addendum contain many important \r\nresolutions and decisions. However, I wish to draw \r\nattention to one in particular. Resolution 15/1 concerns \r\nthe follow-up to the report of the Independent \r\nInternational Fact-Finding Mission on the 31 May \r\nincident. The resolution endorses the report \r\n(A/HRC/15/21) of the mission, which was tasked to \r\ninvestigate violations of human rights law and \r\ninternational humanitarian law resulting from the \r\nIsraeli attack in international waters on the \r\ninternational humanitarian convoy to Gaza. During the \r\nattack, Israeli forces killed nine civilians and wounded \r\nmany others. \r\n The Independent International Fact-Finding \r\nMission consisted of highly reputable international \r\nlegal personalities and issued its report after having \r\ninterviewed 112 witnesses, representing over \r\n20 nationalities, in Geneva, London, Istanbul and \r\nAmman. The findings and conclusions of the report \r\ntherefore reflect a meticulous study and analysis of the \r\nsituation. It also contains compelling legal arguments \r\nbased on international law, including international \r\nhuman rights law and humanitarian law. \r\n Among other things, the Mission concluded that \r\n  “The conduct of the Israeli military and \r\nother personnel towards the flotilla passengers \r\nwas not only disproportionate to the occasion but \r\ndemonstrated levels of totally unnecessary and \r\nincredible violence.” (A/HRC/15/21, para. 264) \r\n The report further stated, \r\n “Such conduct cannot be justified or condoned on \r\nsecurity or any other grounds. It constituted a \r\ngrave violation of human rights law and \r\ninternational humanitarian law.” (ibid.) \r\n The Mission also concluded that the following \r\ncrimes had been committed: wilful killing, torture or \r\ninhuman treatment and the wilful causing of great \r\nsuffering or serious injury to body or health. In \r\naddition, the report went on to enumerate a series of \r\nviolations by Israel of its obligations under \r\ninternational human rights law. It also reaffirmed the \r\nillegality of the blockade on Gaza. We note that the \r\nvast majority of the international community supports \r\nthe findings and conclusions of the report, which gives \r\na fair account of the events based on solid facts and \r\nlegal documents. \r\n Meanwhile, our commitment to the Panel of \r\nInquiry established by the Secretary-General in \r\naccordance with the Security Council’s presidential \r\nstatement of 1 June (S/PRST/2010/9) continues. On \r\n1 September, we submitted our interim report to the \r\nPanel of Inquiry, with substantive attachments \r\nincluding autopsy reports and witness accounts. Our \r\ninterim report resulted from an objective study carried \r\nout by the Turkish Commission of Investigation by \r\ninspecting three of the convoy’s ships, taking verbal \r\nand written testimonies from many witnesses and \r\nanalysing the legal implications of the attack. \r\n After having received the Turkish interim report, \r\nthe Panel submitted its first progress report to the \r\nSecretary-General in mid-September. However, Israel \r\nhas yet to present its own report to the Panel. We call \r\non Israel to acknowledge its mistakes and to act \r\naccordingly. Had the Israelis met our expectations of a \r\nformal apology and compensation for the wounded and \r\nthe families of the deceased, we would not be at this \r\nstage. The sooner the Israelis act responsibly, the faster \r\nrelations will normalize. \r\n Until then, we will continue to closely follow \r\ndevelopments in this matter. Depending on Israel’s \r\nattitude in the coming weeks, we can revisit our \r\nposition, in consultation with other relevant groups and \r\ncountries, on how to pursue this issue in the General \r\nAssembly. Moreover, if Israel does not implement the \r\n A/65/PV.43\r\n \r\n5 10-61876 \r\n \r\nconclusions and recommendations of the report before \r\nMarch 2011, the issue will inevitably become one of \r\nthe major agenda items of the sixteenth session of the \r\nHuman Rights Council. In that respect, we also expect \r\nthe High Commissioner for Human Rights to reflect \r\nsteps taken by Israel to that end, if any, in its report to \r\nthe sixteenth session in March 2011. \r\n We also welcome Human Rights Council \r\nresolutions 15/6 and 13/9, with regard to the report of \r\nthe United Nations Independent International Fact-\r\nFinding Mission on the Gaza Conflict. We will \r\ncontinue to follow up the implementation of the \r\nrecommendations contained in the Goldstone report. \r\n In conclusion, I wish to refer to the significance \r\nof fighting impunity and establishing accountability in \r\nthe context of this Organization. If we are to speak \r\nabout justice, we need to end impunity and ensure \r\naccountability. Otherwise, we cannot speak about \r\npeace and stability, let alone credibility. \r\n Mr. Sangqu (South Africa): Let me extend a \r\nwarm welcome to the President of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, His Excellency Mr. Sihasak Phuangketkeow, \r\nand take this opportunity to congratulate him for his \r\nterm of office during the Council’s fifth cycle year. We \r\nwish to reassure him of South Africa’s support in his \r\nendeavour to guide the Council’s work during this \r\ncycle year. \r\n Allow me to also express our sincere appreciation \r\nto the former President of the Council, His Excellency \r\nMr. Alex Van Meeuwen, and to the members of his \r\nBureau who have, in an exceptional manner, steered \r\nthe work of the Council during the reporting period \r\ncovered in the annual report before us (A/65/53 and \r\nA/65/53/Add.1). \r\n We attach great importance to the work of the \r\nHuman Rights Council as a body of first instance \r\nresponsible for universal respect for the promotion, \r\nprotection and fulfilment of all human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms. In that regard, we wish to \r\nemphasize the imperative need for the Council’s work \r\nto be solidly grounded on the fundamental principles \r\nthat underpin the outcome of the 1993 World \r\nConference on Human Rights, namely, the Vienna \r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action. The Council’s \r\nwork must evolve to deal with the contemporary \r\nchallenges facing the peoples of the world, which are \r\ndeeply rooted in the debilitating poverty and \r\nunderdevelopment that still defines the world order. \r\n South Africa has always advocated the need to \r\nconsider all human rights issues on an equal footing. In \r\nthat regard, my delegation encourages the Human \r\nRights Council to accord balanced attention and focus \r\non both civil and political rights as well as economic, \r\nsocial and cultural rights. The notion of the \r\njusticiability of economic, social and cultural rights is \r\nalso an integral thread, especially given the looming \r\ndeadline for realization of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), in order to make the \r\npractical enjoyment of all human rights a reality for all. \r\n In our view, the achievement of the MDGs is \r\ninconceivable without recognition of the \r\nintersectionality and inextricability between \r\ndevelopment and human rights. It is equally important \r\nthat the Council seriously examine the possibility of \r\nestablishing a mechanism or structure to positively and \r\ncomprehensively contribute to General Assembly \r\nprocesses that aim to fast-track the realization of the \r\nMDGs, which, in our view, are human rights. \r\n The Council must equally continue to strengthen \r\nexisting international law, norms and standards, \r\nparticularly where there are substantive gaps in relation \r\nto the contemporary challenges facing all victims of \r\nhuman rights abuses worldwide. That can only add \r\nvalue to the mandate of the Council in terms of the \r\npromotion and protection of human rights. \r\n We are encouraged by the commencement of the \r\nprocess of review of the Human Rights Council, to \r\nwhich the President referred earlier. We are cognizant \r\nof all of the other parallel activities and efforts that are \r\ntaking place in various regions of the world to \r\ndeliberate on this subject. However, it remains our \r\nhope that the intergovernmental working group created \r\nfor that purpose will continue to serve as a forum for \r\nsuch discussions, which must continue to be guided by \r\nthe principles of inclusivity, transparency and \r\ncomprehensiveness. We must congratulate both the \r\nPresidents of the General Assembly and of the Human \r\nRights Council for ensuring that through joint efforts, a \r\ncoherent and coordinated review process will emerge. \r\n The review of the Council should take a victim-\r\noriented approach and aim to prevent violations of \r\nhuman rights, rather than react to those issues. In the \r\nsame vein, it is our hope that, in line with resolution \r\n48/141, the realignment of the relationship between the \r\nOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights \r\nand the Human Rights Council will serve to produce \r\nA/65/PV.43  \r\n \r\n10-61876 6 \r\n \r\ncomplementarity in the efforts of those two \r\ninstitutions. \r\n Similarly, the Council is faced with an odd \r\nsituation of a cycle year that begins in the middle of \r\nthe year and month. That presents a serious anomaly in \r\nits work, with the concomitant result of a sitting \r\nPresident presenting an annual report covering a period \r\nover which he has not presided. This is an issue that \r\nmy delegation raised during the earlier institution-\r\nbuilding processes. We will continue to follow up on it \r\nin the context of the review of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. \r\n Of equal importance is the Universal Periodic \r\nReview Mechanism, which remains the hallmark of the \r\nCouncil’s work. Its universality must be preserved and \r\nstrengthened, particularly with respect to the uniform \r\nstandard questionnaire, which must be developed as a \r\ntool to assess all States. The role of the special \r\nprocedures must remain ever so relevant, particularly \r\nwith respect to the examination of all situations in an \r\nequal manner. It is our firm view that no State is \r\nimmune from human rights violations, hence the need \r\nfor regional mandates remains a necessity. \r\n The remaining process of review will commence \r\nsoon in New York. Our view is clear, that here in New \r\nYork our discourse should relate to the issues on the \r\nstatus of the Council as stipulated in resolution 60/251. \r\n Another area of realignment that remains key to \r\nmy delegation is the question of the relationship \r\nbetween the Human Rights Council and the General \r\nAssembly in general, and with the Third Committee in \r\nparticular. In that regard, we should address the \r\nquestion of how the Committee is supposed to deal \r\nwith the report of the Council. These issues, in our \r\nview, fall within the purview of the review of the status \r\nof the Council. My delegation stands ready to work \r\nclosely and in a constructive manner on the matter of \r\nthe review of the Human Rights Council. We look \r\nforward to fostering such cooperation during this \r\nprocess. \r\n Mr. Weisleder (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nWe are grateful for the report (A/65/53 and \r\nA/65/53/Add.1) that has been introduced to us on the \r\nwork of the Human Rights Council. We particularly \r\nappreciate the opportunity to discuss it in plenary \r\nmeeting of the General Assembly. My delegation \r\nbelieves that it is necessary to coordinate the work of \r\nthe Third Committee and the full Assembly, in order to \r\nfacilitate an in-depth consideration of this important \r\ndocument. \r\n Historically, Costa Rica has had a profound \r\ncommitment to respect, protect, observe and promote \r\nhuman rights. In that connection, the full \r\nimplementation and effect of human rights constitute \r\nthe main pillar of our domestic and foreign policies. \r\n Costa Rica’s national development plan for the \r\nperiod 2006 to 2010, which is still being implemented, \r\nestablishes human rights as a cross-cutting aspect of \r\nState activities and objectives. Despite the difficulties \r\nthat Costa Rica faces as a middle-income developing \r\ncountry that receives very little international assistance \r\nin carrying out social, cultural and economic projects, \r\nby devoting public resources we have been able to \r\ncontinue to improve our people’s living standards and \r\nto build a strong institutional structure for the \r\nprotection of human rights. Such protection is equally \r\nafforded to immigrants, who comprise around 10 per \r\ncent of our total population. \r\n With regard to the most recent session of the \r\nHuman Rights Council, we would like to highlight \r\nonce more the adoption of resolution 15/11, entitled \r\n“World Programme for Human Rights Education: \r\nadoption of the plan of action for the second phase”. \r\nThe resolution was introduced by the Platform for \r\nHuman Rights Education and Training, which \r\ncomprises the delegations of Costa Rica, Italy, \r\nMorocco, the Philippines, Slovenia, Senegal and \r\nSwitzerland. \r\n Human rights education and training is a lifelong \r\nprocess that contributes to the establishment and \r\nstrengthening of societies that are more tolerant and \r\npeaceful, in which all human beings and their inherent \r\nand indivisible human rights are valued, respected and \r\nprotected. It also promotes mutual understanding, helps \r\nto prevent conflicts and violations of human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms on the ground and enhances \r\nparticipation and democratic processes. \r\n Costa Rica attaches high priority to the review \r\nprocess of the work of the Human Rights Council. \r\nFrom our standpoint as an observer State to date, we \r\nhas been deeply involved in the discussions that have \r\nbeen taking place in that regard. We have presented to \r\nthe Third Committee some general ideas on the \r\nprocess, but I would also like to share with Member \r\nStates two of my country’s specific proposals, namely, \r\n A/65/PV.43\r\n \r\n7 10-61876 \r\n \r\nwith regard to the Universal Periodic Review and \r\nspecial procedures. \r\n Based on our own experience in the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review, we believe that it requires some fine-\r\ntuning. Currently, recommendations for each country \r\nexamined are treated unequally and in a disjointed \r\nmanner. This situation has an impact on the way in \r\nwhich the examined country can implement the \r\nrecommendations. We propose improving the operation \r\nof the troika and improving the support provided by the \r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights by way of a guide for clustering and \r\nfiltering recommendations. \r\n We have proposed improving the classification of \r\nrecommendations, as well as consolidating them so \r\nthey appear only once in a catalogue that, once it has \r\nbeen accepted by a State, genuinely reflects a country’s \r\nprogress and the challenges it faces in the area of \r\nhuman rights. The content of each recommendation \r\nshould be sufficiently clear to allow the relevant State \r\nand the other stakeholders concerned to implement it. \r\n We believe that special procedures are crucial for \r\nimproving the situation on the ground. In addition to \r\nunderlining the need for a standing invitation from all \r\nMember States, Costa Rica has therefore proposed to \r\nthe Council the establishment of region-specific special \r\nprocedures as an option to ensure, through broad and \r\nequitable monitoring, an integral approach to human \r\nrights in all countries and regions. This proposal would \r\nnot only help to strengthen the principles of non-\r\nselectivity, objectivity and impartiality; it would allow \r\nfor better oversight of actual conditions from the \r\nperspective of the universality, interdependence and \r\nindivisibility of human rights. It could also serve as a \r\nformula for enhancing States’ willingness to cooperate \r\nin the process. \r\n We would like to recall that Costa Rica has \r\npresented its candidacy for the Human Rights Council \r\nfor the period 2011-2014. We are a country that \r\nrespects peace, tolerance, pluralism, diversity, \r\ninternational law and the multilateral system. We are \r\ncommitted to work in a responsible, systematic, \r\ntransparent and constructive manner in the Council. If \r\nwe achieve our aspiration, we will maintain a dedicated \r\nposition on human rights while also being receptive to \r\ninformation, arguments and positions from all sides, in \r\na transparent and equitable manner. \r\n Mr. Mohamed (Maldives): The Maldives would \r\nlike to thank His Excellency Ambassador Sihasak \r\nPhuangketkeow for his work in presiding over the \r\nfifteenth session of the Human Rights Council and for \r\nhis report presented to us here today (A/65/53 and \r\nA/65/53/Add.1). The Maldives is proud to have been \r\nelected to the Council in May of this year. We are \r\ncognizant of the trust and responsibility conferred upon \r\nus through the overwhelming support demonstrated by \r\nUnited Nations Members across all regions. \r\n The decision by the Maldives to seek a seat on \r\nthe Human Rights Council was a measured one that \r\nreflected our ambition to enable our fledgling \r\ndemocracy to mature and endure through the \r\ndevelopment of institutions that promote and protect \r\nthe political, social and cultural rights of our citizens. \r\nIt was also rooted in the notion that this increasingly \r\nglobalized world calls for tolerance, understanding and \r\nrespect for human dignity as we collectively strive to \r\nfree ourselves from those burdens that have long \r\ndeprived humankind of a world free from hunger, \r\npoverty, ignorance and insecurity. \r\n We believe that these objectives can only be \r\nachieved through a process of positive engagement that \r\ncomprehensively addresses the needs and sensitivities \r\nof the most vulnerable, whom we have pledged to \r\nprotect. Moreover, this process must inspire the \r\nexchange and self-directed adoption of best practices \r\nthat ensure the promotion and protection of human \r\nrights. The Maldives believes that the Human Rights \r\nCouncil and the Third Committee are the appropriate \r\ndeliberative bodies for promoting such processes. \r\n The Maldives became a subject of the Council as \r\nwe undertook our own Universal Periodic Review in \r\nGeneva very early this morning. We consider this \r\nexercise an opportunity to enhance human rights \r\nprotections at home. This recent experience only serves \r\nto strengthen our firm belief that the review process is \r\none of the most successful tools in the Council’s initial \r\narsenal of human rights instruments. Furthermore, our \r\nexperiences this morning reaffirmed the notion that the \r\nmedium for these reviews is true dialogue. We assert \r\nthat these presentations serve not only to inform, but to \r\nengage in a dialogue that allows for meaningful \r\nexamination of and reflection upon one’s challenges \r\nand their solutions. \r\n Lastly on this point, we would like to emphasize, \r\nas we did this morning, that the Maldives has extended \r\nA/65/PV.43  \r\n \r\n10-61876 8 \r\n \r\nstanding invitations to all Special Rapporteurs. Our \r\nGovernment has made sweeping changes in the past \r\ntwo years, and we do not believe that these positive \r\ndevelopments are produced by ephemeral flashes of \r\ninsight in isolation. Rather, we maintain that the \r\nsuccess of our ongoing efforts to evolve is the result of \r\nboth internal pressures and the introduction of external \r\nobservations and solutions that help us to produce new \r\nand improved ways of protecting and empowering our \r\ncitizens. \r\n As Ambassador Phuangketkeow stated yesterday, \r\nthe Council undertook an ambitious agenda in pursuit \r\nof its mandate. The Maldives delegation in Geneva set \r\nout to contribute constructively to this work by \r\npursuing our stated objective of promoting issues of \r\nparticular national concern, namely, the rights of \r\nwomen and children, the prevention of torture, \r\nenvironmental rights, the rights of persons with \r\ndisabilities and the independence of the judiciary. \r\n The Maldives had the honour of jointly \r\nintroducing, together with the United States of \r\nAmerica, a draft resolution that endeavours to \r\nstrengthen the enjoyment of civil and political rights by \r\nestablishing a new United Nations Special Rapporteur \r\nto aid in further protecting the right of expression of \r\npolitical opinions, engage in literary and artistic \r\npursuits, form trade unions and elect accountable \r\nleaders that represent those interests. \r\n In pursuit of our priority to promote gender \r\nequality, the Maldives worked closely with Mexico and \r\nColombia to establish a new United Nations human \r\nrights mechanism designed to monitor, modify and \r\neliminate national laws that discriminate against \r\nwomen. We also endorsed the follow-up to the report \r\nof the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission \r\non the Gaza flotilla attack, voted in favour of continued \r\nUnited Nations engagement with the human rights \r\nsituation in the Sudan and co-sponsored various \r\nresolutions that we believe will bolster our own \r\nnational efforts to strengthen institutions that protect \r\nthe basic tenets of our democracy and the social rights \r\nof our people. \r\n While we are proud of the achievements we have \r\nwitnessed as an observer and then member of the \r\nHuman Rights Council during these past four years, we \r\nreadily acknowledge that the Council requires \r\nimprovements that produce an international body \r\nwhose form and function meet the challenges of its \r\nstated mission. We maintain that although total \r\noverhaul is not necessary, much can be done to ensure \r\na more engaging and positive process in Geneva that \r\ntranslates improvements on the ground into real human \r\nrights. \r\n For example, we believe that any review of the \r\nCouncil should facilitate the active engagement of all \r\nsmall States with the work of the Council. The unique \r\ngeopolitical circumstances of these entities produce \r\nunique needs and perspectives that must be reflected in \r\ndeliberations that have implications for everyone. \r\nMoreover, we believe that improving our methods for \r\ndealing with country-specific human rights situations \r\nand reflecting on a more comprehensive picture of the \r\nstatus of human rights that includes success stories in \r\nensuring the full enjoyment of human rights would \r\nresult in a more constructive process. Lastly, on the \r\nmatter of reform, we would like to assert our support \r\nfor maintaining a minimum of three regular sessions \r\nthroughout the year for the Council’s work, as reducing \r\nthe current number of sessions would constrain the \r\nCouncil’s ability to respond to human rights issues as \r\nthey emerge. \r\n The Maldives believes that real security and \r\nsustainable and equitable development are predicated \r\non the existence of a system anchored by human rights. \r\nWe will therefore continue to pursue initiatives that \r\nprotect and strengthen the rights of victims, improve \r\npreventive measures and encourage constructive \r\ndialogue. Moreover, we will continue to promote our \r\npositive experiences by encouraging countries to adopt \r\na method of honest self-reflection when thinking about \r\nthe human rights challenges they face, while making \r\nuse of an open and honest dialogue in order to develop \r\nsolutions that translate into real success at home. \r\n Mr. Gutiérrez (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): My \r\ndelegation thanks the President of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, Ambassador Sihasak Phuangketkeow, for the \r\npresentation of his report to the General Assembly \r\n(A/65/53 and A/65/53/Add.1). Peru is pleased to note \r\nthat the outcome of the work of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil makes a major contribution to the promotion \r\nand protection of human rights. Although there are \r\nmany important topics for my delegation flowing from \r\nthe report of the Human Rights Council, I should like \r\nto refer to a few of them specifically. \r\n Peru deeply deplores the passage of legislation \r\nthat criminalizes irregular migration, the \r\n A/65/PV.43\r\n \r\n9 10-61876 \r\n \r\nimplementation of which affects the human rights and \r\nthe dignity of migrants. We express our profound \r\nconcern at the arbitrary arrests and detentions that are \r\ntaking place. We reiterate that all migrants, regardless \r\nof their migratory status, should be treated in \r\naccordance with the standards of international human \r\nrights law. We call on States to eliminate these \r\nmeasures, which without a doubt will exacerbate the \r\nproblem of migration, thus encouraging trafficking and \r\nslavery and increasing even more the level of poverty \r\nof migrants and their families. \r\n The elimination of discrimination against women \r\nis an issue to which Peru also attaches special \r\nimportance. We continue to be concerned at the lack of \r\nequality before the law that women suffer from in some \r\nparts of the world, which only limits their development \r\nand the opportunities open to them. For this reason, we \r\ncall on States to comply with their international \r\nobligations. In accordance with the commitments made \r\nwithin the framework of the Convention on the \r\nElimination of All Forms of Discrimination against \r\nWomen, the Beijing Declaration and Platform for \r\nAction and the Millennium Development Goals, we \r\ncall upon them to set aside laws that discriminate \r\nagainst women and increase their social, economic and \r\npolitical vulnerability. \r\n Violence against women also limits their \r\nprogress. It should therefore be condemned, no matter \r\nwhat the forms and circumstances might be, and \r\neffective measures should be taken to eliminate and \r\nprevent it. \r\n Another topic closely related to women is the \r\nrenewed commitment of States to eliminate \r\npreventable mortality and morbidity associated with \r\nchildbearing. This issue is also dealt with in the \r\nCouncil, and Peru has already supported the ensuing \r\nresolution. \r\n We highlight the handling of the human rights \r\nsituation after the earthquake in Haiti and the renewal \r\nof the mandate of the independent expert on that topic. \r\nAs part of the group of friends, Peru supports the \r\nmandate, which is focused on technical assistance and \r\ncapacity-building and respects the decisions adopted \r\nby the Haitian Government on that process. \r\n Furthermore, in spite of the progress achieved at \r\nthe global level in eradicating extreme property, it \r\ncontinues to be a very serious problem and undermines \r\nthe human dignity of millions of people. The \r\neradication of extreme poverty is closely linked to the \r\npromotion and protection of the full enjoyment of \r\nhuman rights. In that sense, it is the responsibility of \r\nStates and the international community to contribute to \r\nthe eradication of extreme poverty. \r\n Given the importance of this subject, Peru will, as \r\nin previous years, once again present to the Third \r\nCommittee during this session a draft resolution on \r\nhuman rights and extreme poverty, which will be \r\nlinked to and support the work of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. \r\n Peru is part of the group of friends on human \r\nrights and extreme poverty, in Geneva, and is \r\ncommitted to supporting the efforts of the High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights. We support her \r\nconsultations on the report on the draft principles and \r\nguidelines on extreme poverty and human rights in \r\naccordance with the mandate of the Council, and we \r\ncall for States and other prominent international actors \r\nto join in that task. \r\n My delegation welcomes the establishment of the \r\ntwo special procedures mandates, the post of special \r\nrapporteur on the right of freedom of association and of \r\nassembly and the working group on the elimination of \r\ndiscrimination against women in law and in practice. \r\nPeru reiterates its commitment to support their \r\nrespective areas of work and the rest of the special \r\nprocedures and working groups mandated by the \r\nCouncil. My country also highlights the importance of \r\nthat work being completed in a fully independent \r\nfashion. \r\n As a founding member of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, Peru has actively participated in the Council’s \r\ninstitution-building process, with the basic objective of \r\npromoting universal respect for and protection of \r\nfundamental human rights in full accordance with the \r\nprinciples of legitimacy, without discrimination or \r\npolitical selectivity. \r\n With the experience garnered at the time as well \r\nas that gained from our current status as observer, Peru \r\nhas presented its candidature to the Human Rights \r\nCouncil for the 2011 to 2014 term. Whether as member \r\nor observer, as we are currently, my country will \r\ncontinuously cooperate with the Council and is \r\nconvinced that, if elected, we will be able to contribute \r\neven further to the Council’s work. \r\nA/65/PV.43  \r\n \r\n10-61876 10 \r\n \r\n My country has been participating in the review \r\nprocess of the Human Rights Council in Geneva. We \r\nhave supported the programme of work and its \r\nmodalities, as presented by the President of the \r\nCouncil. Although that process is led by States, my \r\ndelegation attaches great importance to its inclusive \r\nnature, which enables civil society and national human \r\nrights institutions and regional organizations to \r\nparticipate. \r\n In that context, we appreciate the results of the \r\nfirst session of the intergovernmental working group \r\non the review of the Council, which recently took place \r\nin Geneva. We believe duplication of efforts among the \r\nCouncil, the General Assembly and the Third \r\nCommittee should be avoided. Instead, a \r\ncomplementary aspect should be promoted, which \r\nwould make it easier to promote and protect human \r\nrights on the ground and to strengthen the mechanisms \r\nof the Council. \r\n In that respect, my delegation shares the view \r\nthat the review process should be practical and realistic \r\nand should primarily focus on considering to what \r\ndegree the Council has complied with the mandate \r\nentrusted to it. We also believe that the review should \r\nbe a long-term process. It should not conclude at this \r\nstage, but rather a new review should take place five \r\nyears after the conclusion of the current one. \r\n The implementation of the Universal Periodic \r\nReview Mechanism is one of the elements that have \r\ncontributed to strengthening the universal system of \r\nhuman rights. Although we believe that that \r\nMechanism can be improved, one cannot deny that it is \r\none of the achievements brought about by the creation \r\nof the Council. However, its true dimensions should be \r\nevaluated in the light of States heeding the comments \r\nmade to them during the periodic review. \r\n In line with our ongoing commitment to the \r\nuniversal, indivisible and interdependent nature of \r\nhuman rights, Peru will continue to direct its efforts \r\ntowards greater and better consolidation of the work of \r\nthe Human Rights Council and towards making that \r\nbody complementary to the work of the Third \r\nCommittee. We will do so without, of course, ignoring \r\nthe political principle of the unswerving promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights and fundamental freedoms \r\nand respect for democracy and the rule of law that Peru \r\nhas always had. \r\n Mr. Sial (Pakistan): We would like to welcome \r\nthe President of the Human Rights Council and thank \r\nhim for the presentation of the report of the Council for \r\nthe 2009-2010 period (A/65/53) and its addendum \r\n(A/65/53/Add.1). We would also like to express our \r\nappreciation for the cooperative approach and \r\nprofessionalism of the officials of the Office of the \r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights. \r\n We avail ourselves of this opportunity to \r\ncongratulate Ambassador Phuangketkeow on his \r\nelection as the President of the Human Rights Council. \r\nIn a short time, he has established his credentials as an \r\nable leader who can facilitate consensus in difficult \r\nsituations to carry the process forward in a \r\nnon-controversial manner. Pakistan will continue to \r\nsupport his constructive approach and sincere efforts in \r\ntaking the agenda of human rights forward in a \r\nconsensual and impartial manner. \r\n The Human Rights Council is in its fifth year. \r\nWith all its perceived shortcomings, the Council has \r\nmade tremendous progress both in terms of progressive \r\ndevelopment of human rights standards and in dealing \r\nwith human rights situations around the globe. We are \r\naware of the views concerning the need for measures to \r\nenable the Council to address various complex \r\nsituations. However, in our view, the Council is well \r\nequipped with all the necessary tools. What is lacking \r\nis their transparent, impartial and non-selective use in \r\ndifferent situations. \r\n During the recent interactive dialogue with the \r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights in the Third \r\nCommittee we welcomed her pledge and efforts to \r\nimprove the relationship between her Office and the \r\nCouncil. We believe an enhanced and institutionalized \r\nrelationship benefits all. Accordingly, we welcome the \r\npresidential statement on the subject during the \r\nfifteenth session of the Council (A/HRC/PRST/15/2). \r\n This is also a year in which the Council has to \r\nundergo a major review exercise, concerning both its \r\nwork and functioning and its status. While \r\nacknowledging the importance of the ongoing work on \r\nthat issue, we agree with the views expressed this \r\nmorning by the President that it is only a review and \r\nnot a reform exercise (see A/65/PV.42). Accordingly, \r\nwe would caution against taking adventurous \r\napproaches that may compromise the very balanced \r\nand well-crafted package contained in Council \r\nresolution 5/1. The first session of the working group \r\n A/65/PV.43\r\n \r\n11 10-61876 \r\n \r\non the review has brought forward a diversity of views \r\non this important subject, and we look forward to the \r\nrole of the facilitators in sifting through that diversity \r\nin a manner that serves to improve the work and \r\nfunctioning of the Council in a way that is consistent \r\nwith the package. \r\n As for the review process to be conducted in New \r\nYork, we support streamlining and taking appropriate \r\nsteps that can help the Council to have enough \r\nresources at its disposal without delays to effectively \r\ncarry out its mandated tasks. \r\n The crown jewel of the Human Rights Council’s \r\nwork is the Universal Periodic Review. That \r\nmechanism has proved that meaningful progress can be \r\nachieved on all human rights in a cooperative, \r\nrespectful and non-accusatory manner. While \r\naddressing some of the procedural difficulties \r\nconcerning time management, adoption of reports and \r\nso forth, we must preserve the cooperative and peer-\r\nreview approach of the Review. Due attention must \r\nalso be given to effective follow-up to agreed-on \r\nrecommendations. \r\n Special procedures contribute to and complement \r\nthe Council’s important work. Accordingly, they must \r\nwork within the agreed framework of their mandates \r\nand the code of conduct. While fully acknowledging \r\nthe independent nature of their work, we must also \r\navoid duplication of mandates and urge impartial \r\nassessment of various human rights situations. \r\nCountry-specific resolutions remain the bane of the \r\nCommission era. We must learn from the positive \r\nexamples of the Universal Periodic Review that the \r\ntrue promotion and protection of human rights are \r\nbetter achieved through a non-politicized and \r\ncooperative approach. \r\n Again, meaningful promotion and protection of \r\nhuman rights can be achieved only if all human rights \r\nare given equal importance, as they are interlinked, \r\ninterdependent and mutually reinforcing. Economic, \r\nsocial and cultural rights must be addressed \r\nconcomitantly with civil and political rights. We \r\ncommend the work done by the Council on the right to \r\ndevelopment, and we call for a cooperative approach to \r\nachieve that important right as a priority. \r\n The Council must also pay more attention to \r\ncombating the growing trend of racial and religious \r\nintolerance. Increased instances of xenophobic \r\ndiscourse and policies have resulted in lowering the \r\nsafeguards for the promotion and protection of the \r\nrights of migrants and minorities and undermining \r\nsecular and multicultural values. \r\n An important facet of the Council’s work is the \r\nspace provided to non-governmental organizations and \r\ntheir meaningful contribution in almost all areas of the \r\nwork of the Human Rights Council. We recognize their \r\nvaluable input and hope they will continue to \r\nparticipate and contribute in accordance with the well-\r\nestablished criteria laid down in Economic and Social \r\nCouncil resolution 1996/31. \r\n In conclusion, we would like to express our \r\nsupport for the adoption of this year’s report by \r\nconsensus and hope that both the resolutions and \r\nrecommendations contained therein will be \r\nimplemented. \r\n Mr. Balé (Congo) (spoke in French): I would like \r\nto thank the President for organizing this debate on the \r\nreport of a body whose importance has reinforced the \r\ncorrectness of resolution 60/251. Since its \r\nestablishment in 2006, the Human Rights Council has \r\nshown itself to be a useful tool for the effective \r\npromotion and protection of human rights. Today’s \r\ndebate, which is part of the 2011 review process of the \r\nstatus, activities and functioning of the Council, is of \r\nthe highest interest to the Congo, in the light of the \r\nimportant responsibilities that that organ shoulders in \r\npromoting and protecting human rights around the \r\nworld. \r\n My delegation would like to take this opportunity \r\nto congratulate the Office of the High Commissioner \r\nfor Human Rights, as well as all mandate holders, \r\nrapporteurs, special representatives and independent \r\nexperts whose reports allow us to improve and pursue \r\nour efforts to promote human rights — all human \r\nrights. \r\n My delegation takes note of the Council’s report \r\nA/65/53 and the addendum (A/65/53/Add.1) and \r\ncorrigendum (A/65/53/Corr.1) and would like to \r\nexpress its appreciation of the efforts the Council has \r\nmade towards fulfilling the mission established for it in \r\nresolution 60/251. We also thank the President of the \r\nCouncil for his introductory statement this morning \r\n(see A/65/PV.42). The report is a compilation of the \r\nCouncil’s resolutions, decisions and conclusions from \r\nthe Universal Periodic Reviews. It can, however, serve \r\nto give a complete picture of the range and number of \r\nactivities undertaken by the Council. \r\nA/65/PV.43  \r\n \r\n10-61876 12 \r\n \r\n The various contributions from States — \r\nmembers and non-members of the Council — United \r\nNations institutions and civil society allow us to \r\nglimpse a world in which the universality of human \r\nrights and their interdependence will grow day by day. \r\nThat trend should be a factor for progress in the \r\nunderstanding and analysis of human rights situations \r\nin a world faced with numerous challenges, above all \r\nby crises that constitute serious threats to international \r\npeace and security and that impede development \r\nefforts, particularly the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. In that context, my delegation \r\npays tribute to the efforts of the Human Rights Council \r\nto strengthen, through a multilateral approach, \r\ncooperation in every aspect of the area of human \r\nrights. \r\n After the review of its national report in the \r\nUniversal Periodic Review in May 2009, the Republic \r\nof the Congo threw itself into the implementation of \r\nthe resulting recommendations. The Council’s decision \r\nto complete the review of the human rights situation in \r\nmy country during its confidential session in \r\nSeptember 2009 reflects, in our opinion, its recognition \r\nof the Congolese Government’s commitment to \r\npromoting and protecting human rights. At the same \r\ntime, that endorsement by the international community \r\nwas also seen by the authorities in my country as the \r\nirreversible impulse of a process aimed at building a \r\nmodern State founded on respect for law and \r\ndemocratic rules. The Congolese Government is \r\ncommitted to that and knows it can rely on assistance \r\nfrom both its national and international partners. \r\n Beyond the guarantee of civil and political rights \r\nthat it has undertaken to assure to all its citizens, my \r\nGovernment is determined to promote and protect their \r\neconomic, social and cultural rights. The recent socio-\r\neconomic measures taken on the occasion of the \r\nfiftieth anniversary of the independence of the \r\nRepublic of the Congo are part of that commitment to \r\nensure the right to well-being of the people of Congo, \r\nparticularly in regard to achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. \r\n With regard to protecting children’s rights, my \r\ncountry has just ratified the Optional Protocol to the \r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child concerning the \r\ninvolvement of children in armed conflict. That follows \r\nour ratification last year of the Optional Protocol \r\nconcerning the sale of children, child prostitution and \r\nchild pornography. \r\n This year the Congo will introduce a law \r\nconcerning the promotion and protection of the rights \r\nof indigenous peoples. The current visit to my country \r\nby the Special Rapporteur on the situation of the \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous \r\npeople, Mr. James Anaya, which began on 2 November, \r\nwill give him the opportunity to discuss the human \r\nrights of indigenous peoples with representatives of the \r\nGovernment, indigenous communities and civil society \r\ngroups. His report will eventually clarify for us ways \r\nand means of committing to further promote and \r\nprotect the rights of my indigenous countrymen. \r\n Congo would like to reaffirm once more its \r\nwillingness to hold to all its international commitments \r\nin the area of the promotion and protection of human \r\nrights and to support the international community’s \r\nefforts to that end. That is why my country has decided \r\nto submit its candidature for the Human Rights Council \r\nfor the 2011 to 2014 period, and to that end would like \r\nto request the support of all the States represented here \r\nin the elections, which will be held in May 2011. \r\n The year 2011 is crucial for the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. We will undertake two review processes of \r\nthat important body, here in New York and in Geneva. \r\nThose two processes will, we hope, mutually reinforce \r\nand complement each other in a coordinated way to \r\nensure that there are tangible and effective results in \r\nterms of improving the work and functioning of the \r\nCouncil and its monitoring mechanisms. My delegation \r\nwill support any measure in line with that perspective. \r\nAnd we must also ensure that during that exercise we \r\nreview in depth the relationship between the Human \r\nRights Council and other United Nations bodies with a \r\nview to streamlining and improving the effectiveness \r\nof our institution. \r\n My delegation continues to believe strongly that \r\nthose two processes will lead to enhancing the Human \r\nRights Council and will demonstrate its relevance in \r\nterms of protecting and promoting human rights more \r\nthan ever. \r\n Ms. Tvedt (Norway): Let me start by thanking \r\nthe President of the Human Rights Council for \r\npresenting the Council’s report (A/65/53 and \r\nA/65/53/Add.1). The promotion and protection of \r\nhuman rights is one of the principal aims of the United \r\nNations. Together with the promotion of peace and \r\nsecurity, it constitutes one of the pillars upon which the \r\nUnited Nations was founded. Norway is therefore \r\n A/65/PV.43\r\n \r\n13 10-61876 \r\n \r\nhonoured to be a member of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. \r\n A reinvigorated vision for human rights was at \r\nthe heart of the Secretary-General’s agenda for United \r\nNations reform, which the World Summit endorsed in \r\n2005. The Human Rights Council was created to \r\nstrengthen the United Nations human rights machinery. \r\nNorway took an active part in the negotiation of \r\nresolution 60/251, establishing the Council and in the \r\nnegotiation of the institution-building package. We are \r\nalso actively participating in the ongoing review of the \r\nCouncil. \r\n In the day-to-day work of the Council we have \r\naimed at working constructively with partners from all \r\nregions and groups to raise the credibility, \r\neffectiveness and visibility of the Council. We have \r\ndone so through making full use of the existing system. \r\n In assessing the Council, we would like to \r\nhighlight both important achievements — some of \r\nwhich can be further improved — and shortcomings. \r\n Among the key achievements is, in our view, the \r\nalmost standing nature of the Council. By meeting \r\nregularly throughout the year in three regular sessions, \r\nthe Council has the ability to address human rights \r\nsituations in a timely and effective manner. We also \r\nview the Universal Periodic Review as a success. If \r\nused to its full potential, it can close the \r\nimplementation gap. It can bring the work of the \r\nUnited Nations and the Council to the field — to rights \r\nholders and victims — in partnership with \r\nGovernments. \r\n The system of special procedures continues to be \r\nthe jewel in the crown. The Council’s review, \r\nrationalization and improvement process has worked \r\nwell. The visibility, relevance and impact of the system \r\nof special procedures have been improved through the \r\nUniversal Periodic Review as well as through the \r\nalmost standing nature of the Council. \r\n Promoting the mainstreaming of human rights \r\nwithin the United Nations system is an essential part of \r\nthe Council’s mandate and is fundamental to achieving \r\nthe goals of United Nations reform. The Council \r\nshould devote more time to its mainstreaming mandate. \r\n A key shortcoming is the selectivity in dealing \r\nwith urgent situations. Human rights violations in some \r\nparts of the world trigger immediate reaction by the \r\nCouncil; violations in other parts of the world are met \r\nwith complete silence. That remains a fundamental \r\nshortcoming and affects the credibility of the Council \r\nin all issues. We need objectivity and clearly defined \r\nthresholds for action. \r\n We look forward to a continued inclusive and \r\ntransparent review process in the Council as well as in \r\nthe General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Lukiyantsev (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): The Russian Federation is grateful to the \r\nPresident of the Human Rights Council, Ambassador \r\nPhuangketkeow, for the detailed presentation of the \r\nreport on the work of the Council (A/65/53 and \r\nA/65/53/Add.1). For our part, we are ready to provide \r\nthe President with the greatest assistance possible in \r\ncarrying out his important mandate. The responsibility \r\nof his mandate is particularly high, given the review \r\nprocess of the work of the Council and also decisions \r\non its status. \r\n Last week in Geneva the review process officially \r\nstarted, and the open-ended intergovernmental working \r\ngroup, established on the initiative of the Russian \r\nFederation, began its work. Much remains to be done \r\nin the intersessional consultations, which, with the \r\nassistance of the coordinators, should help us to reach \r\nmutually acceptable decisions during the second \r\nsession of the working group. \r\n Nevertheless, informal discussions on this issue \r\nhave been taking place in various formats for more \r\nthan a year already, and we would like to express how \r\nwe view some of the elements of that process. \r\n It can now confidently be said that the Council \r\nhas demonstrated its ability to carry out the task given \r\nto it. It has justified the trust of the international \r\ncommunity and does not need any far-reaching reform. \r\nThe reviews should serve as an instrument for fine-\r\ntuning and should focus on removing specific \r\nshortcomings that have come to light during the first \r\nyears of its work. \r\n The main challenge is to remove any remaining \r\nelements of politicization, selectiveness and double \r\nstandards. In that regard, we believe that the central \r\ntheme of the review should be enhancing the spirit of \r\ncooperation and dialogue both in the work of the \r\nCouncil and in the area of human rights as a whole. \r\nThat should lead to the depoliticization of the United \r\nNations international human rights agenda. \r\nA/65/PV.43  \r\n \r\n10-61876 14 \r\n \r\n For that it is important to preserve the positive \r\nexperience and balance achieved by the Human Rights \r\nCouncil in 2007 during its institution-building, \r\nincluding in terms of establishing new human rights \r\nstandards and also in the work of the main specialized \r\nprocedures, including the code of conduct. One of the \r\nCouncil’s undeniable achievements has been the \r\nunique mechanism of the Universal Periodic Review \r\nby peers. It has become an effective instrument for \r\nidentifying human rights problems in specific countries \r\nthrough constructive dialogue and jointly identifying \r\nthe means to remedy them with the direct participation \r\nof the concerned States. \r\n We believe that the review of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil should be based on the principles of \r\ntransparency, openness, objectivity and pragmatism. \r\nWe must try to ensure that the outcome of the review \r\nenjoys the greatest possible support. We must avoid \r\nrevisiting the institution-building package of the \r\nHuman Rights Council, which would only lead to \r\nconfrontation. We believe that the future outcome \r\ndocument of the working group should be \r\nsupplemental to that package, based only on specific \r\nproposals by States and following the structure of the \r\nCouncil’s institution-building document. \r\n The provisions of resolution 60/251 define the \r\narrangements and bodies responsible for conducting \r\nthe review of the functioning and status of the Human \r\nRights Council. The issue of the status of the Council \r\ncomes under the purview of the General Assembly. \r\nNevertheless, we believe it would be logical that it \r\nshould be reviewed in the Assembly only after the \r\nreview of the Council’s functioning has been \r\ncompleted. We welcome the understanding reached \r\nbetween the President of the Council and the General \r\nAssembly on that issue. Furthermore, the Council itself \r\nhas the procedural capacity and expertise to allow it to \r\ndraw up its own recommendations for the Assembly on \r\nthe question of its status. \r\n While recognizing the division of powers \r\nbetween the Council and the General Assembly in \r\nterms of the review, we would like to stress that \r\ncooperation and coordination between Geneva and \r\nNew York is both useful and necessary. We welcome \r\nthe attention given by the coordinators in New York, \r\nthe Permanent Representatives of Morocco and \r\nLiechtenstein, to the Geneva process. \r\n Still on the theme of the review status, it should \r\nbe stressed that we are opposed to considering, in that \r\ncontext, membership criteria for the Council. By long-\r\nstanding United Nations practice, elections to limited \r\nmembership United Nations bodies are by a simple \r\nmajority in the regional groups. To attempt to introduce \r\nany additional criteria is not only unrealistic but is in \r\nconflict with accepted practice. We are against the \r\nleading human rights body of the United Nations \r\nsystem becoming a club of the chosen few. \r\n There are elements that could be used to improve \r\nthe electoral procedures for the Council. For example, \r\nthere is an interesting proposal to establish a time limit \r\nfor submitting candidates to elections, which could \r\nmake the pre-election process more transparent. \r\n In conclusion I would like to express the Russian \r\nFederation’s readiness to work actively and \r\nconstructively with all interested parties for the \r\nsuccessful review of the functioning and status of the \r\nHuman Rights Council. \r\n Mr. Dabbashi (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): First of all, I would like to welcome the \r\nPresident of the Human Rights Council and to thank \r\nhim for his statement (see A/65/PV.42) and for his \r\nadministration of the Council. I would also like to pay \r\ntribute to the work of the Human Rights Council \r\nduring the last year and to the High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights for her work in promoting and \r\nprotecting human rights. \r\n Five years after the creation of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil we hope, like other Member States, for a \r\nCouncil that is strong, that demonstrates integrity, that \r\ndeals with human rights issues in an impartial and \r\nconstructive way and that works in a spirit of \r\ncooperation. Priority should be given to the \r\nfundamental rights of people as established under \r\ninternational law and to the elimination of foreign \r\noccupation, since that is the worst violation of human \r\nrights. We hope that the Universal Periodic Review that \r\nbegan in Geneva will become a mechanism that can \r\nindeed promote and protect human rights and enhance \r\nthe role of the Human Rights Council. \r\n The creation of the Human Rights Council led to \r\na new phase of international efforts to promote and \r\nprotect human rights and to establish justice and \r\nequality through objective, neutral action devoid of \r\ndouble standards or selectivity or politicization — \r\n A/65/PV.43\r\n \r\n15 10-61876 \r\n \r\nwhich has, unfortunately, shackled joint international \r\nefforts in various forums. \r\n In conducting a review of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil over the course of this year, in conformity with \r\nresolution 60/251, we must recognize and commend \r\nthe work carried out by the Council since it was \r\nestablished, in terms of decisions and consultations and \r\nof the procedures it has adopted, as well as the support \r\ngiven to Member States and the positive outcomes that \r\nhave been achieved thanks to the mechanism of the \r\nUniversal Periodic Review. I must also mention the \r\nremarkable role being played by that mechanism in the \r\nexamination of complaints, and by the Special \r\nRapporteurs, which all help to promote and consolidate \r\nthe principles of human rights. \r\n Over the past five years, the Council has \r\nconducted its work and has established its institutions \r\nand the Universal Periodic Review Mechanism, which \r\nseeks to deal with human rights issues in all States in \r\nan equal and impartial way, without any politicization \r\nand avoiding political disputes. We hope that all States \r\nwill take account of that principle and will not abrogate \r\nthe defence of human rights under any pretext, \r\nparticularly the daily violations that occur in the \r\noccupied Palestinian territories because of the Israeli \r\noccupation. \r\n Libya had the honour of being elected last May to \r\nthe Human Rights Council. We highly appreciate the \r\nhonour and confidence that the international \r\ncommunity has placed in us, which lays on us the \r\nresponsibility to promote and protect human rights, \r\nboth nationally and internationally. The Libyan Arab \r\nJamahiriya has supported international peace and \r\nsecurity as a member of the Security Council during \r\nthe past two years and will now, as a member of the \r\nHuman Rights Council, work hard to promote and \r\nprotect human rights at the international level, in \r\ncooperation with other Member States. \r\n The international community is encountering \r\nenormous challenges in on the area of human rights, \r\nparticularly in areas of conflict. However, the \r\nviolations of human rights that the Palestinian people \r\nare suffering under the Zionist occupation are unique \r\nand require constant monitoring by the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, in order that an end can be put to the killing \r\nof Palestinian civilians, to detentions, even of women \r\nand children, to the destruction of houses and the \r\nrazing of agricultural land and to the expulsion of \r\nPalestinians from their own land. \r\n More important, an end should be put to the war \r\ncrimes and crimes against humanity that are being \r\nperpetrated in the Gaza Strip and the other Palestinian \r\noccupied territories. Those responsible for such acts \r\nshould be brought to justice so that similar acts can no \r\nlonger be repeated. There should also be constant \r\nmonitoring of the implementation of the \r\nrecommendations contained in the Goldstone report \r\n(A/HRC/12/48) and other reports dealing with \r\ninvestigations into Zionist crimes committed against \r\nthe Palestinian people. We also look forward to the \r\nimplementation of the Council’s decisions and \r\nrecommendations, which are included in the report of \r\nthe Human Rights Council before us (A/65/53 and \r\nA/65/53/Add.1) and in previous reports. \r\n The Acting President: I now give the floor to the \r\nobserver of the Holy See. \r\n Archbishop Chullikatt (Holy See): As the \r\nGeneral Assembly takes up this agenda item, on the \r\nreport of the Human Rights Council, my delegation \r\nonce again affirms the importance of the Council for \r\npromoting universal respect for the protection of all \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms for all, \r\nwithout distinction of any kind, and in a fair and equal \r\nmanner. \r\n Recognition of the dignity of each and every \r\nperson — which the Human Rights Council was \r\nformed to protect and promote — entails full respect \r\nfor the inner and transcendent dimension of the human \r\nperson, which is an integral part of what it means to be \r\na human being. Through the free exercise of \r\nconscience and moral decision-making, human beings \r\nare able to transform themselves into living members \r\nof social life, whose goodwill, charity and hope \r\npromote the dignity and well-being of every member of \r\nthe human family. \r\n Intrinsically linked to the freedom of conscience \r\nis the freedom of religion, by which human beings are \r\nable to pursue the most important relationship of their \r\nlife, that is, their relationship with God. Freedom of \r\nreligion necessarily entails the freedom to subscribe to \r\na set of beliefs, to adopt or change one’s religion, to \r\nprofess one’s faith and to practise that faith fully, \r\nopenly and publicly. \r\nA/65/PV.43  \r\n \r\n10-61876 16 \r\n \r\n Governments have a solemn responsibility to \r\nsafeguard rather than ridicule that inalienable right. \r\nSince the State is not the author of any fundamental \r\nhuman right, it must respect that intimate and \r\nfundamental sanctuary of human freedom, the \r\nconscience, and to allow each conscience its fullest and \r\nhighest expression in the free exercise of religious \r\nfaith. \r\n International instruments and declarations have \r\naffirmed the responsibility of States in that regard. One \r\nneed only to call to mind, for example, the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, which affirms the right \r\nto freedom of thought, conscience and religion, which \r\nincludes freedom to change one’s religion or belief, \r\nand freedom — either alone or in community with \r\nothers, in public or private — to manifest one’s \r\nreligion or belief in teaching, practise, worship and \r\nobservance. \r\n Like every other freedom, the freedom of religion \r\nmust fit harmoniously into the context of all legitimate \r\nand authentic human freedoms. This vital freedom \r\nmust also develop harmoniously, with attentive respect \r\nfor the freedom of religion of others in the context of \r\njust laws that apply to all. Governments have a \r\nresponsibility to promote and guarantee this general \r\natmosphere of responsible freedom. \r\n Today there remain instances of religious \r\nintolerance, discrimination and violence directed \r\nagainst members of many religious minorities, \r\nincluding Christians, in various parts of the world, in \r\nthe form of attacks on religious sites in violation of \r\ninternational law and suppression of individuals’ public \r\nexpression of their beliefs. \r\n In that regard, my delegation recalls with \r\nprofound sorrow the recent siege of the Church of Our \r\nLady of Deliverance, the Syrian Catholic cathedral in \r\nBaghdad, which caused the violent death of so many \r\nChristian faithful — some of whom I knew personally, \r\nincluding the two priests who were murdered, Tha’ir \r\nSaad and Boutros Wasim. \r\n The response to that latest example of brutal \r\nattacks against Christians, in total contempt for their \r\nlives and their dignity, needs to be complete respect for \r\nthe human rights and fundamental freedoms of every \r\nindividual. Constitutional and legislative systems are \r\nunjust when they fail to provide adequate and effective \r\nguarantees of freedom of thought, conscience and \r\nreligion to all. Each and every Government needs to \r\nwork all the more to guarantee fully the right to life, \r\nfreedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief for \r\neach and every person. \r\n Not only do Governments bear responsibility, but \r\nindividuals and communities likewise need to promote \r\ntolerance, mutual understanding and respect among the \r\nfollowers of the various faith traditions. \r\n Education, especially of young people, is \r\nimportant in promoting such a culture of peaceful \r\ncoexistence, with parents having the primary \r\nresponsibility for the upbringing and development of \r\ntheir child. Their right to do so is secured by \r\ninternational instruments, but this right is often \r\ncompromised by the will of the State. In that regard, \r\nparents must be fully respected in their freedom to \r\nensure the religious and moral education of their \r\nchildren, in conformity with their own convictions. \r\n The importance of education, especially of young \r\npeople, in promoting values and mutual respect among \r\npersons brings to mind the important role of those \r\nengaged in educational efforts, especially the primary \r\nrole of parents. In that regard, my delegation cannot \r\nbut be dismayed by the most recent report of the \r\nformer Special Rapporteur on the right to education \r\n(see A/65/162) and his thoughts on comprehensive \r\nsexual education, especially in the context of the \r\nfamily and the community. That is contrary to long-\r\nestablished and internationally acclaimed juridical \r\nnorms that protect fundamental and universal human \r\nrights. \r\n We know that a man and a woman united in \r\nmarriage, together with their children, form a family, \r\nwhich is the natural and fundamental unit of society. \r\nThe institution of marriage is prior to any recognition \r\nby public authority, which has an obligation to \r\nrecognize and protect it. In the family the child is able \r\nto learn moral values, begin to honour God and make \r\ngood use of freedom. Family life is thus an initiation \r\ninto life in society. \r\n International instruments consistently affirm the \r\nright and responsibility of parents in the education of \r\ntheir children. Such instruments rightly affirm that the \r\ndecision regarding the education of the child rests with \r\nthe parents. In that regard, it is important that those \r\nwho hold mandates to report on certain aspects of \r\nhuman rights be faithful to the principles of the United \r\nNations Charter and the applicable human rights \r\n A/65/PV.43\r\n \r\n17 10-61876 \r\n \r\ninstruments. To do otherwise is to imperil all \r\nfundamental human rights. \r\n The best interests of the child are the basic \r\nconcern of the parents, who have the primary \r\nresponsibility for the upbringing and development of \r\ntheir children. Any attempt to create a division between \r\nthe primary responsibility of parents and the best \r\ninterests of their children, as the report of the Special \r\nRapporteur appears to do, does a disservice to the \r\nchild, the parents, marriage and the family, as well as \r\nto the future generation overall. \r\n What is needed instead is respect for the child by \r\nthe support of the family, which for the child is the \r\nhealthiest environment in which to be raised. It is not \r\nthe State but parents who have primary responsibility \r\nfor the education of their children. My delegation takes \r\nthis opportunity to restate the intergenerational \r\nimportance of this responsibility. \r\n Human rights are based on the inherent dignity of \r\nthe human person. Those inalienable rights are founded \r\nin the natural moral order, and they are discernible \r\nthrough right reason, which is universal. My delegation \r\nmust be candid: human rights do not change any more \r\nthan human nature can change. \r\n A fundamental respect for human rights is \r\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter and other \r\ninternational instruments. States are called to fully \r\nrespect these rights, and the Human Rights Council \r\nexists to assist them in that regard. The more the \r\nHuman Rights Council is faithful to its purpose, the \r\nmore it will be able to be of service to all, rather than \r\nto just some. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on this item. The Assembly has \r\nthus concluded this stage of its consideration of agenda \r\nitem 63. \r\n  The meeting rose at 4.45 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
