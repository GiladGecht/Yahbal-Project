(Switzerland) \r\n \r\n \r\n  In the absence of the President, Mr. Mac-Donald \r\n(Suriname), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 38 \r\n \r\nThe situation in Afghanistan \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/65/552) \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/65/L.9) \r\n \r\n The Acting President: I shall now give the floor \r\nto the representative of Germany to introduce draft \r\nresolution A/65/L.9. \r\n Mr. Wittig (Germany): 2010 was a very \r\nimportant year for the future of Afghanistan. The \r\nConferences held in London, in January, and in Kabul, \r\nin July, were important milestones. They provided \r\nguidance for the long-term cooperation of the \r\ninternational community with the Afghan people in \r\ntheir efforts to establish sustainable peace and security \r\nand to rebuild their country. These Conferences paved \r\nthe way for the Kabul process, and their outcome is at \r\nthe centre of the draft resolution before us on the \r\nsituation in Afghanistan (A/65/L.9), which it is my \r\nhonour to introduce today. As facilitator, Germany is \r\npleased with the substantial and balanced document \r\nand the significant number of sponsors. Let me \r\nhighlight the key political messages of this year’s draft \r\nresolution. \r\n First, the draft resolution welcomes the renewed \r\ncommitment of the Afghan Government to the Afghan \r\npeople, and, at the same time, the renewed commitment \r\nof the international community to Afghanistan as \r\nexpressed in the communiqués of the London and \r\nKabul Conferences. These are complementary, as the \r\ncommitment of the international community can only \r\ncomplete but not replace the engagement of the Afghan \r\nGovernment itself. In this vein, the General Assembly \r\nencourages all partners to constructively support the \r\nKabul process, building on international partnerships to \r\nfurther increase Afghan responsibility and ownership. \r\n Secondly, regarding security, the General \r\nAssembly welcomes the Afghan Government’s plan for \r\na phased transition to full Afghan responsibility for \r\nsecurity, based on mutually agreed criteria and \r\nconditions and supported by international partners. The \r\nGeneral Assembly also urges the Afghan authorities to \r\ntake all possible steps to ensure the safety, security and \r\nfreedom of movement of all United Nations, \r\ndevelopment and humanitarian personnel, and notes the \r\nimportance of regulating private security contractors \r\noperating in Afghanistan. \r\n Thirdly, on reconciliation and reintegration, the \r\nGeneral Assembly commends the Afghan Government \r\nfor holding the Afghan National Consultative Peace \r\nJirga in June 2010 in Kabul, and expresses its support \r\nfor an Afghan Government-led peace and \r\nreconciliation process, as recommended by the Jirga. \r\nThe General Assembly also calls on the Afghan \r\nGovernment to ensure that the reintegration \r\nprogramme is implemented in an inclusive manner \r\nconsistent with the Afghan Constitution and \r\ninternational legal obligations. \r\nA/65/PV.44  \r\n \r\n10-61898 2 \r\n \r\n At the same time, the General Assembly recalls \r\nthe respective commitments made in this regard at the \r\nLondon and Kabul Conferences and stresses the \r\nimportance of continued contributions by the \r\ninternational community to the Peace and \r\nReintegration Trust Fund. \r\n Finally, the General Assembly welcomes the \r\nrecent parliamentary elections in Afghanistan — which \r\nwere held entirely under the responsibility of the \r\nAfghan authorities and supported by the international \r\ncommunity — as a crucial step towards consolidating \r\ndemocracy in Afghanistan. In this context, the draft \r\nresolution also commends Afghanistan for the steps \r\ntaken by its relevant institutions to address alleged \r\nirregularities and to ensure a credible, transparent and \r\nlegitimate electoral process in accordance with Afghan \r\nlaws and the Afghan Constitution. \r\n Let me add on a personal note that I am \r\nencouraged by the fact that, among the 249 elected \r\nmembers of parliament, more than 27 per cent are \r\nfemale, which is clearly above the international \r\naverage in national Parliaments. \r\n Furthermore, the draft resolution reiterates the \r\ncall for full respect for the human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms of all, without discrimination of \r\nany kind. It recalls the need to strengthen international \r\nand regional cooperation with Afghanistan in its \r\nsustained efforts to address drug production and \r\ntrafficking, and expresses serious concerns about the \r\nhigh number of civilian casualties. \r\n With the draft resolution, Member States strongly \r\nrenew their message of international solidarity with the \r\nAfghan people and underline that transition is not \r\nsynonymous with withdrawal. The draft resolution is a \r\nwell-balanced call on Member States for continued \r\ncooperation with the Afghan Government in all fields. \r\nAt the same time, the international community urges \r\nthe Afghan Government to continue its efforts to fight \r\ncorruption and fraud, promote respect for human \r\nrights, counter impunity, improve access to justice, and \r\nimplement the rule of law throughout the country. The \r\ninternational community stands ready to assist. \r\n Let me make some additional remarks on the \r\nposition of my country. \r\n First of all, Germany aligns itself with the \r\nstatement that will be delivered by the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Belgium on behalf of the European \r\nUnion later in the debate. Let me add the following. \r\n My country has an old and long-standing \r\nfriendship with Afghanistan. Germany is among the \r\nlargest contributors to the country, providing troops \r\nand development for civil reconstruction. The process \r\nbegun in 2010 will lead to a more stable and sovereign \r\nAfghanistan. This process must be a political process. \r\nThe solution cannot be military, even though the \r\nInternational Security Assistance Force is pivotal to the \r\nfuture of the country. In order to achieve lasting peace \r\nand political stability, the commitment of the \r\ninternational community can only complement but not \r\nreplace the engagement of the Afghan Government \r\nitself. We believe, however, that the United Nations \r\nand its institutions will also have to play a significant \r\nrole in the long term. \r\n Let me seize this occasion by expressing our \r\nheartfelt gratitude to the men and women of the United \r\nNations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, with \r\nStaffan de Mistura at the helm, for the valiant service \r\nthey provide in Afghanistan. \r\n Germany is committed to continuing to support \r\nthe Afghan people and to cooperating fully and \r\nconstructively with the Afghan Government. We urge \r\nthe Afghan authorities to continue their close \r\ncooperation with the international training missions. \r\nWe would like to emphasize the need to focus on \r\nmeasures that bring tangible results for the people of \r\nAfghanistan, including in education, medical assistance \r\nand access to food and water supply, including in \r\nparticular in the rural areas where 80 per cent of the \r\nAfghan population lives. \r\n In concluding, I would like to express my \r\ngratitude to the many delegations from all regions of \r\nthe world that participated actively in the informal \r\nconsultations. My special thanks go to our colleague \r\nand friend Ambassador Zahir Tanin and his very able \r\nteam for their trust and outstanding cooperation during \r\nour consultations. \r\n Mr. Grauls (Belgium): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the European Union. The candidate \r\ncountries Turkey, Croatia and the former Yugoslav \r\nRepublic of Macedonia; the countries of the \r\nStabilization and Association Process and potential \r\ncandidates Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, \r\nMontenegro and Serbia; and Ukraine, the Republic of \r\n A/65/PV.44\r\n \r\n3 10-61898 \r\n \r\nMoldova, Azerbaijan and Georgia align themselves \r\nwith this statement. \r\n Afghanistan has been on the agenda of the \r\nGeneral Assembly for the past three decades. Many \r\nAfghans remember their country as a stable and \r\ntolerant nation at the crossroads of cultures and \r\ncivilizations. Some even speak of a golden age. We \r\ncome here today in the conviction that this era will not \r\nbe just in the country’s past; Afghanistan’s best days \r\nare still ahead. \r\n The past decade has seen a concerted effort by \r\nthe international community and Afghanistan to turn \r\nthe country around. It is not just the Afghan people \r\nwho stand to gain from a stable, free and prosperous \r\nAfghanistan; we all do. Tackling such global and \r\nregional threats as terrorism, militant extremism, illicit \r\nnarcotics and transnational crime also means being \r\nengaged in Afghanistan. Both the heart and the mind \r\ncompel us to do our part. It is an expression of \r\nhumanity and a security interest for all of us. \r\n During the past year, the partnership between the \r\ninternational community and Afghanistan has evolved \r\nto a new phase. It is quite fitting that, after \r\ninternational conferences in places such as London, \r\nParis, The Hague, Bonn and Moscow, we finally ended \r\nup in Kabul itself. After the London Conference in \r\nJanuary had set out the strategic framework and a \r\nseries of important commitments, the Kabul \r\nConference then outlined how these commitments \r\nwould be fulfilled by the Government of Afghanistan \r\nand the wider international community. \r\n The Kabul Conference was a milestone on \r\nAfghanistan’s road towards enhanced ownership and \r\nleadership. The European Union welcomes the draft \r\nresolution before us today (A/65/L.9), which \r\naccurately reflects this new relationship between \r\nAfghanistan and the international community. We \r\nthank Germany for having successfully facilitated the \r\ninformal consultations. \r\n While resolutions, communiqués and action plans \r\nare important in this nation-building effort, ultimately \r\nit all starts and ends with the aspirations of the Afghan \r\npeople themselves. Their hopes and dreams and their \r\nneeds and concerns should take centre stage. \r\n The recent parliamentary elections contributed to \r\nthis new phase by contributing to Afghanistan’s \r\ndemocratization. Many Afghans, among them more \r\nwomen and young people than ever before, at great \r\npersonal risk performed the empowering and \r\nemancipating act of casting their ballots. We hope that \r\nthe new Parliament will now perform well and be \r\nresponsive to the people. The elections were not \r\nperfect, but we have seen progress in how key Afghan \r\ninstitutions functioned. Lessons have been learned \r\nfrom previous elections. Nevertheless, there is still \r\nroom for improvement. However, it is not for the \r\ninternational community but for the independent \r\nAfghan authorities, and in the end the Afghan people, \r\nto judge whether these first Afghan-led parliamentary \r\nelections were transparent, inclusive and credible. We \r\nnow await the finalization of the complaints process \r\nand the announcement of the final results in due \r\ncourse. \r\n The Kabul Conference established a new \r\nrelationship not only between the international \r\ncommunity and the Government, but also between the \r\nGovernment and the Afghan people; and like citizens \r\naround the world, the Afghan people expect results \r\nfrom their Government. They expect safer streets and \r\nroads, not just during elections but in everyday life. \r\nAfghan men and women expect their human rights to \r\nbe respected and justice to be done. Afghans expect a \r\nGovernment that fights corruption harder and focuses \r\nmore on creating jobs for the people. And they expect \r\ntheir Government to deliver such basic services as \r\nhealth services and education. \r\n Living up to these expectations constitutes a \r\ndaunting challenge, but the Government is not alone. \r\nThe international community is there to help. The \r\nEuropean Union will do its part to help the \r\nGovernment deliver. The Lisbon Treaty has made us a \r\nbetter partner — more unified, more cohesive and more \r\ncoherent. Implementing our 2009 action plan will \r\nsharpen our focus and support the Government’s \r\npolicies, especially when it comes to good governance, \r\nthe rule of law and development. \r\n Let me make a few quick remarks on these three \r\nareas. First, with respect to good governance, we \r\nsupport President Karzai and his Government as they \r\nfight corruption and improve the management of \r\nAfghanistan’s finances. In this context, the European \r\nUnion will play its part in channelling more funding \r\nthrough the Afghan Government or multi-donor trust \r\nfunds. Secondly, on the rule of law sector, the \r\nEuropean Union will continue to fulfil an important \r\nrole through the European Union Police Mission. \r\nA/65/PV.44  \r\n \r\n10-61898 4 \r\n \r\nThirdly, development is an area where the European \r\nUnion is spending more than €1 billion a year. Many \r\ndevelopment projects depend on private security \r\ncompanies for their day-to-day operations. That is why \r\nwe welcome the recently reached understanding on \r\nthese companies and look forward to the results of the \r\njoint committee working on it. \r\n In the short run, security is a precondition for \r\ndevelopment, and the European Union continues to \r\nassist the Government in fulfilling that peace and \r\nsecurity precondition. This is especially true for the \r\npolitical challenge of reintegration and reconciliation \r\nand for the ongoing phased transition to full Afghan \r\nresponsibility for security. In the long run, that \r\nrelationship works the other way around, with \r\ndevelopment a precondition to security. For long-term \r\nstability, we need increased prosperity and less poverty. \r\n The President took the Chair. \r\n The European Union’s commitment to \r\nAfghanistan is for the long term. Transition does not \r\nmean immediate withdrawal. We will continue to work \r\nside by side with the Afghan Government and people \r\nand with other partners in the international community. \r\nOf course, in addition to the Government of \r\nAfghanistan, one of our most important partners is the \r\nUnited Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan \r\n(UNAMA), which we firmly support in its \r\ncoordination role. As security is established throughout \r\nAfghanistan, it is hoped that UNAMA will be able to \r\nestablish its presence in more areas of the country. For \r\nthe implementation of its ambitious, refocused \r\nmandate, UNAMA has a well-qualified leader in \r\nSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General \r\nStaffan de Mistura. \r\n All of us are working towards the same goal: a \r\nmore stable Afghanistan where the authorities can \r\nassume responsibility for security and where long-term \r\ndevelopment and diversification of the economy can \r\ntake place. Achieving this goal will be challenging. It \r\nwill not be easy to live up to the expectations of the \r\nAfghan people. Nevertheless, as they say in that \r\nbeautiful country, “There is a path to the top of even \r\nthe highest mountain”. \r\n Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): I have the honour to speak on behalf of the \r\nStates members of the Collective Security Treaty \r\nOrganization (CSTO): the Republic of Armenia, the \r\nRepublic of Belarus, the Republic of Kazakhstan, the \r\nKyrgyz Republic, the Russian Federation and the \r\nRepublic of Tajikistan. \r\n Since early 2010, Afghanistan has experienced a \r\nnumber of milestone events that have been key to \r\nchoosing the path of its future development. The \r\ninternational conferences in London and Kabul \r\nlaunched the Kabul process and outlined the basic \r\nparameters of the process of transferring responsibility \r\nfor the situation in the country to the Aghan \r\nauthorities. The National Consultative Peace Jirga was \r\nheld and the High Peace Council established. \r\nParliamentary elections were generally successful. All \r\nof this has set a solid foundation for development, \r\ndemocratic processes and economic and social \r\nrecovery in Afghanistan, helping it to become a \r\npeaceful, independent, prosperous and neutral State. \r\n However, much more remains to be done. Above \r\nall, there remain the tasks of suppressing terrorist and \r\nextremist threats, achieving lasting national \r\nreconciliation, building competent Afghan security \r\nforces capable of ensuring law and order throughout \r\nthe country, protecting the national borders and curbing \r\ndrug-related criminal activity. These are the \r\npreconditions for effective governance mechanisms, \r\nrestoring economic capacities and developing \r\ndemocratic institutions in Afghanistan.  \r\n The international presence is called on to help in \r\nfulfilling these tasks. While maintaining the central \r\ncoordinating role of the United Nations in general \r\nstabilization efforts, we have entrusted the \r\nInternational Security Assistance Force (ISAF) with \r\nthe key functions of providing comprehensive security \r\nthroughout Afghan territory, suppressing terrorist \r\nactivity and creating an effective Afghan army and \r\npolice force. The international community has ISAF \r\nwith all the tools necessary to achieve their objectives. \r\nThat is why they can be withdrawn from Afghanistan \r\nonly after they report the completion of their mandate. \r\n We are concerned about the rising death toll \r\namong civilians, as reflected in the 2010 mid-year \r\nreport on the protection of civilians in the armed \r\nconflict in Afghanistan. Noting the progress made by \r\nthe foreign military presences in minimizing the \r\nnumber of casualties among the civilian population, we \r\nurge them to make greater efforts to prevent such \r\ncasualties. Otherwise, it will be impossible to move \r\nahead in normalizing the situation. \r\n A/65/PV.44\r\n \r\n5 10-61898 \r\n \r\n Four of the seven States members of the \r\nCollective Security Treaty Organization belong to the \r\nCentral Asian region directly bordering Afghanistan. In \r\nthis regard, we are particularly concerned about the \r\ngrowing instability in the northern provinces of \r\nAfghanistan, where the situation was previously \r\nrelatively peaceful. We call for an end to the ineffective \r\ntactic of squeezing militants out of combat zones, \r\nwhich allows them to maintain their combat ability and \r\nto relocate to other parts of the country, including \r\nnorthern Afghanistan. We are convinced that anti-\r\nterrorism efforts should be aimed primarily at the \r\nelimination of terrorists and extremists. \r\n The process of national reconciliation is an \r\nimportant component of any Afghan settlement. Our \r\ncollective position on this issue is entirely clear and \r\nlogical. A dialogue with the Taliban can be conducted \r\nonly by the Government of Afghanistan and only if the \r\nTaliban repent, recognize the Afghan Constitution, \r\nrenounce violence and break all ties with Al-Qaida and \r\nother terrorist groups. This process should be \r\ncompletely transparent and without prejudice to the \r\nsanctions regime imposed by Security Council \r\nresolution 1267 (1999). Any contacts with the Taliban \r\nbehind the scenes are, in our view, unacceptable. \r\n The task of curbing drug trafficking in \r\nAfghanistan remains critical. Its destructive impact and \r\nscope have spread beyond the region to become a \r\ngenuine threat to international peace and stability. It is \r\nimportant to fight this evil throughout the entire chain \r\nof production and trafficking of drugs, from \r\neradicating drug crops to curbing the flow of \r\nprecursors, as well as including drug traffickers on the \r\nSecurity Council sanctions list. We urge the \r\nGovernment of Afghanistan and ISAF to fight the \r\nAfghanistan narcotics industry more vigorously, \r\nespecially in view of the undeniable fact that drug \r\ntrafficking has become a major source of funding for \r\nterrorist activities in Afghanistan. \r\n Regional organizations, in particular the \r\nCollective Security Treaty Organization, can offer an \r\ninvaluable service to the Afghan authorities and foreign \r\nmilitary presences in their fight against the narcotics \r\nindustry. The time has come to establish operational \r\ninteraction between the CSTO and NATO in combating \r\ndrug trafficking. We are convinced that our \r\norganization’s achievements and potential for further \r\nsuccess in this area can be very useful in effectively \r\nsuppressing drug trafficking. \r\n In this connection, I would like to note that \r\ncombating drug trafficking through the joint activities \r\nof member States was listed as a primary objective \r\nfrom the very inception of the Collective Security \r\nTreaty Organization. \r\n The CSTO has launched a series of \r\ncomprehensive preventive operations under the code \r\nname “Channel” to identify and block routes for the \r\nillegal transportation of drugs and precursors. This is a \r\nlarge-scale operation. It involves representatives of \r\nvarious drug control and law enforcement agencies, the \r\nborder and customs controls of member States, \r\nhomeland security organizations and financial \r\nintelligence services. \r\n The results of the operation include the \r\nelimination of a number of drug smuggling routes from \r\nAfghanistan, the closing of international and \r\ninterregional channels for the delivery of synthetic \r\ndrugs from Europe, the suppression of the activities of \r\nclandestine laboratories, the prevention of leakage of \r\nprecursors into illicit circulation, and, finally, the \r\ndestruction of the economic foundations of drug \r\ntrafficking. As of 2009, the operation had acquired the \r\nstatus of an ongoing project of CSTO. \r\n Since 2003, the operation has completed some 10 \r\nactive phases in which enforcement agencies from \r\nmore than 20 countries, including Afghanistan, \r\nAzerbaijan, Bulgaria, Germany, Iran, Spain, China, the \r\nUnited States of America, Turkey, Ukraine, Finland \r\nand Estonia, as well as such international organizations \r\nas the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \r\nEurope, INTERPOL and the Eurasian Group on \r\nCombating Money Laundering and Financing of \r\nTerrorism joined the competent authorities of CSTO \r\nmember States as observers. For example, during just \r\ntwo stages of the operation in 2009, the coordinated \r\nactions of States led to the seizure of 116 tons of drugs. \r\nA total of over 220 tons have been seized throughout \r\nthe duration of the operation through the anti-narcotics \r\nefforts of the States members of CSTO. \r\n The initiative to establish anti-drug and financial \r\nsecurity belts, with the participation of Afghanistan’s \r\nneighbours, remains very timely. These belts help \r\nmitigate the drug threat and enhance monitoring over \r\nthe transboundary movement of funds that could be \r\ngenerated by the illegal sale of drugs, money-\r\nlaundering and other criminal activities. \r\nA/65/PV.44  \r\n \r\n10-61898 6 \r\n \r\n Operation Channel and the assistance rendered by \r\nCSTO member States to the transit of cargoes for the \r\nInternational Security Assistance Forces in Afghanistan \r\nare examples of effective cooperation among member \r\nStates in countering security challenges and threats \r\nemanating from Afghan territory. We attach the utmost \r\nimportance to coordinated development and \r\nimplementation of a coherent approach to Afghan \r\nissues by all international players concerned about the \r\nfuture of that country. \r\n It is increasingly clear that the current \r\nfragmentation of international anti-narcotics efforts in \r\nAfghanistan is ineffective. Arguments used to justify \r\nthe rejection of coordinated activities in this area are \r\nwell known and unconvincing. They might be worth \r\nnoting only if we were to consider the elimination of \r\ndrug plantations separately from the comprehensive \r\nseries of efforts to eradicate terrorism, promote \r\nstability and help recovery through the cultivation of \r\ntraditional Afghan crops. \r\n CSTO member States are convinced that the \r\nlong-term stabilization of the situation in Afghanistan \r\nand the effective fulfilment of the country’s objectives \r\nare impossible without an integrated approach on the \r\npart of the international community and a gradual and \r\ncarefully calibrated transfer to the Afghan authorities \r\nof the responsibility for the situation in their country. \r\n For our part, we continue to support the central \r\ncoordinating role of the United Nations and encourage \r\nthe further strengthening of the coordination of \r\nactivities by all States and international organizations \r\nin the interests of the Afghan people and the \r\nmaintenance of peace and stability in Afghanistan and \r\nthe entire region. \r\n Mr. Tanin (Afghanistan): I am honoured to be \r\nhere today to discuss the annual draft resolution on the \r\nsituation in Afghanistan (A/65/L.9). I wish to extend \r\nmy gratitude to all delegations that have contributed to \r\nthe debate and to all of the sponsors, whose collective \r\nwork on the draft resolution reaffirms their unified \r\ncommitment to shaping a peaceful future for \r\nAfghanistan. \r\n I would like to further express my appreciation to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Peter Wittig, Ambassador and \r\nPermanent Representative of Germany; Mr. Daniel \r\nKrull, Counsellor in the Permanent Mission of \r\nGermany; and their entire team for their great diligence \r\nand efforts to chair the informal negotiations and \r\ncoordinate the positions of Member States in support of \r\nthe draft resolution. \r\n Last year in November, just after President \r\nKarzai’s re-election, he set forth an ambitious national \r\nagenda for the following five years. In his inaugural \r\nstatement, President Karzai called for all who were \r\nwilling to renounce violence and accept the Afghan \r\nConstitution to join the peace process and embrace \r\nnational reconciliation. He asserted the determination \r\nof the country to take the lead in ensuring security and \r\nstability, with continued international support. \r\n He also committed to establishing a competent \r\nand clean Government, promoting good governance \r\nand fighting corruption. In his speech, the President \r\nreaffirmed the commitment of the Afghan Government \r\nto focus on economic development, growth and the \r\nwell-being of the Afghan people. He laid out the \r\nobjective for greater regional cooperation in all areas \r\nand, finally, expressed with appreciation the desire to \r\nfurther the partnership between Afghanistan and the \r\ninternational community. \r\n The President’s national agenda marked a new \r\nbeginning for Afghanistan to stand on its own feet. The \r\ncommitments made highlighted the readiness of the \r\nAfghan Government and the international community \r\nto embark on a transition to national leadership and \r\nnational ownership. \r\n In January, the international community came \r\ntogether for the London Conference in order to align \r\ninternational support with Afghanistan’s efforts \r\nregarding security, governance and development, as \r\nstated in President Karzai’s inauguration speech. The \r\nConference was an opportunity to establish concrete \r\nplans for transforming Afghanistan’s commitments into \r\nrealities. Through our engagement with our \r\ninternational partners, mutual security goals were set \r\nand specific measures for tackling corruption, \r\nachieving national reconciliation and improving the \r\ndelivery of basic services were presented. \r\n In May, the Presidents of Afghanistan and the \r\nUnited States, with members of both Governments, met \r\nin Washington, D.C., in order to jointly assess the \r\nprospect of a successful new focus on Afghanistan. \r\nThat meeting aimed at strengthening the partnership \r\nbetween the United States and Afghanistan, and \r\nsolidified the united efforts of the two nations for \r\nsustainable cooperation, peace and stability in the \r\nregion. \r\n A/65/PV.44\r\n \r\n7 10-61898 \r\n \r\n In June, the National Consultative Peace Jirga \r\njump-started our reconciliation process with the aims \r\nto end violence in Afghanistan and to unify our nation. \r\nBy consulting with different leaders on ideas and \r\nproposals, we began to align our peace efforts in the \r\ncountry. The Jirga included 1,600 delegates \r\nrepresenting a wide variety of segments of Afghan \r\nsociety, including men and women from all over the \r\ncountry. The Conference spawned a unified call to end \r\nthe miseries of this war and move together towards \r\npeace. \r\n In July, the Kabul Conference, hosted by the \r\nAfghan Government and co-chaired by the United \r\nNations, marked an important step forward in the \r\nongoing process of empowering Afghanistan to assume \r\nits leadership role, which is key to a successful \r\ntransition process. It was the first time that high \r\nrepresentatives of more than 70 countries and \r\ninternational organizations came together on Afghan \r\nsoil. The Conference furthered the international \r\ncommitments made at the London Conference. The \r\nresulting agreement secured a significant increase in \r\nthe level of international funding that will be \r\nchannelled through the Afghan Government, reflecting \r\nrenewed support for national ownership. \r\n The Conference crafted the Kabul process, which \r\nis the new foundation for change through transition to \r\nthe full responsibility and leadership of the Afghan \r\nGovernment. It also developed a new compact among \r\nthe Afghan Government, the Afghan people and the \r\ninternational community. The Kabul process also has a \r\nmajor focus on regional relationships, encouraging \r\nimproved cooperation by all regional parties. At the \r\nConference, Afghanistan’s National Development \r\nStrategy Prioritization and Implementation Plan was \r\npresented, reflecting the renewed commitment of \r\nAfghanistan’s Government to building a secure and \r\ndemocratic future. \r\n In September, we held our second parliamentary \r\nelections, which, as the first Afghan-led elections, \r\nrepresented a significant transition of leadership and \r\nresponsibility to the hands of the Afghan people. The \r\nrecent elections included 2,556 candidates, 406 of \r\nwhom were women. Millions of Afghans cast their \r\nballots to choose 249 members of Parliament, shaping \r\nour nation’s future by strengthening Afghan institutions \r\nand building momentum for stabilization. More than 1 \r\nmillion votes were discounted in this election, \r\nreflecting how seriously the Afghan electoral \r\ninstitutions took the issue of fairness in these elections, \r\nand marking a courageous demonstration of our resolve \r\nto regulate and protect democracy. \r\n Throughout the year, the Government of \r\nAfghanistan made strong efforts to enhance and \r\nstrengthen trust and cooperation with its neighbours \r\nand regional partners. The Government sought to \r\ninvolve regional players not only in peace and security, \r\nbut in trade, development and economic cooperation. \r\nPresident Karzai visited China in March, India in April, \r\nJapan in June and Pakistan in September. He attended \r\nthe sixteenth annual South Asian Association for \r\nRegional Cooperation (SAARC) summit in Bhutan in \r\nApril. Important trilateral summits this year included \r\nthose with Pakistan and Turkey in Istanbul in January, \r\nwith Iran and Tajikistan in Tehran in August, and with \r\nIran and Pakistan in Tehran in January. Afghanistan \r\nparticipated in a quadrilateral meeting in Sochi with \r\nPakistan, Tajikistan and Russia, and was a guest at the \r\nmeeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization’s \r\nCouncil of Heads of State in Uzbekistan. \r\n As we speak, the fourth round of the Regional \r\nEconomic Cooperation Conference on Afghanistan is \r\ndrawing to a close in Turkey, and through \r\nAfghanistan’s participation, our Government seeks to \r\npromote economic cooperation with all countries of the \r\nregion, international partners and financial institutions. \r\nThe Economic Cooperation Organization and SAARC \r\nhave played important roles in strengthening the \r\nprocess of regional and economic cooperation through \r\nmeasures facilitating regional trade and infrastructure \r\nconnectivity. \r\n With our fresh start, as mapped out by President \r\nKarzai’s national agenda, and with the consistent help \r\nof the international community, this first year — our \r\nyear of refocus — was marked by hard work and \r\nrewarded by notable progress. Despite our busy \r\ncalendar, we have made substantial strides in the areas \r\nof economic growth and advancing human rights, \r\nmoving ever nearer to our national goals. \r\n While challenges remain ahead, progress has \r\nbeen made in all areas, including economic \r\nadvancement, women’s rights, education and health. \r\nOur average income has quadrupled since 2001, and \r\nGovernment revenue in the past year surpassed $1 \r\nbillion for the first time. Women will make up over a \r\nquarter of our Parliament after the recent elections, \r\nwhile they already account for 18 per cent of \r\nA/65/PV.44  \r\n \r\n10-61898 8 \r\n \r\nGovernment employees. There are now more than \r\n1,000 women in the Afghan National Security Forces, \r\nand we have ambitious plans to increase this number in \r\nthe coming years. Women and girls now have equal \r\naccess to education, and make up 37 per cent of the \r\n7 million students in Afghanistan. The 71 per cent \r\nstudent enrolment rate is also a sign of our success in \r\nimproving education in our country. We have built \r\n4,000 school buildings in the past nine years and plan \r\nto build 2,900 more by the end of 2013. Furthermore, \r\nthrough the provision of basic health services to nearly \r\n90 per cent of our population, health care in \r\nAfghanistan has improved greatly. Our immunization \r\nefforts have helped millions of children, and infant and \r\nunder-five mortality rates continue to improve. \r\n Important steps have been taken to promote good \r\ngovernance and the rule of law and to fight corruption. \r\nThe Government of Afghanistan has made progress in \r\nthis regard, including through the establishment of the \r\nSenior Appointments Panel and strengthening the \r\npower of the High Office for Oversight and Anti-\r\nCorruption. Last year, our commitment to good \r\ngovernance was demonstrated by the prosecution of \r\ndozens of corrupt officials. \r\n Our fight against narcotics has seen progress over \r\ntime. The number of poppy-free provinces has been \r\nmaintained at 20, and there has been a major reduction \r\nin the production of opium this year. Meanwhile, our \r\nefforts to fight illicit narcotics continue as we work \r\nwith regional and international partners on all aspects \r\nof this global challenge. \r\n Security is the most immediate and critical \r\nchallenge facing Afghanistan, and it is also the most \r\nbasic building block of progress. The Taliban and its \r\nallies continue their attempts to increase insecurity and \r\nspread violence to new parts of the country. The violent \r\ncampaigns of the Taliban and Al-Qaida have killed \r\nthousands of innocent men, women and children. They \r\nhave further destroyed our economy and what we have \r\nworked so hard to build over the past decade. Our aim \r\nis to stop this momentum, and despite the challenges \r\nwe continue to make important strides in the fight \r\nagainst terrorism. This year, Afghanistan’s partners and \r\nfriends have increased the strength of forces engaged \r\nin disrupting and defeating the murderous activities of \r\nthe Taliban and Al-Qaida. As we meet here today, \r\nAfghan and international forces continue fighting \r\ntogether to stop terrorists and the violent activities of \r\narmed groups. \r\n With all the important steps taken throughout the \r\ncourse of the year, and with international support, my \r\nGovernment is prepared to intensify its efforts and to \r\nwork together to launch the transition process. We are \r\ncommitted to taking the lead in combat operations in \r\nvolatile provinces by 2011 and assuming full \r\nresponsibility for security efforts, with the support of \r\nthe international community, by the end of 2014. It is a \r\ngradual and conditions-based process that relies on the \r\nfull support of our friends and partners in helping to \r\nbuild the size, strength and operational capability of \r\nthe Afghan Security Forces. \r\n Afghans know that, ultimately, it is the \r\nresponsibility of our own forces to defend the country \r\nand provide security for our people. Therefore, a new \r\nfocus on the accelerated training and equipping of the \r\nAfghan National Security Forces is vital to security \r\nand a successful transition. We hope that, at the end of \r\nthis transition period, the Afghan army and police will \r\nbe able to take full responsibility within Afghanistan as \r\nintended. \r\n We have increased the numbers of the National \r\nSecurity Forces significantly. With the help of our \r\npartners, we now have approximately 130,000 soldiers \r\nand 106,000 police personnel. We plan to increase \r\nthose numbers to 171,000 soldiers and 134,000 police \r\npersonnel by October 2011. The strengthening and \r\ndevelopment of the Afghan armed forces largely \r\ndepend on the immediate end to parallel private \r\nsecurity structures. In the coming years, the Afghan \r\narmed forces will require the continued commitment \r\nand sustained support of NATO and our main allies and \r\npartners. \r\n Later this month, a NATO summit of heads of \r\nState and Government will be held in Lisbon, Portugal. \r\nThe Summit will be another important milestone in our \r\npartnership with NATO. Among the important issues to \r\nbe discussed will be Afghanistan’s transition strategy. \r\nWe look forward to continuing to strengthen our \r\nrelationship with NATO and expect to establish the \r\nsteps needed for a long-term partnership between \r\nNATO and Afghanistan that will endure beyond the \r\ncompletion of NATO’s combat mission. \r\n Nevertheless, military strategies alone are not \r\nsufficient for the success of stabilization efforts. The \r\npeace process necessitates national reconciliation, \r\noutreach to the people of Afghanistan, and sustainable \r\n A/65/PV.44\r\n \r\n9 10-61898 \r\n \r\npartnerships with the region and international \r\ncommunity. \r\n Reconciliation and reintegration of former \r\ncombatants is critical for establishing peace and \r\nsecurity in our country. It is a reasonable and \r\nresponsible policy to open the door for reconciling \r\nthose who would like to join the peace process. We are \r\nnot only committed to such a policy in word, but have \r\nembraced it through our actions. \r\n First, efforts for achieving peace and security \r\ninclude outreach to the armed opposition, which has \r\nled to their inclusion in peace talks, while our \r\nGovernment and international partners continue to end \r\nthe armed activities of the enemies of peace and \r\nprogress. Throughout our reconciliation process, \r\nhuman rights, including the rights of women, remain a \r\nhigh priority. \r\n Secondly, outreach to the Afghan people is more \r\nthan a communications strategy. Afghans from all \r\nsegments of society should be more actively involved \r\nin the political arena and play a role in promoting \r\nsecurity, defence and development. We must ensure an \r\nenvironment in which all Afghan people feel that they \r\nare the masters of their own destinies. This will enable \r\nthem to participate in the betterment of Afghan society. \r\n Thirdly, regional cooperation is vital for peace \r\nand security in the country. In order to address \r\nterrorism, extremism, and narcotic drug production and \r\ntrafficking, we must have meaningful cooperation and \r\nconduct sincere and effective dialogue with our \r\nneighbours. Closing sanctuaries in the region where \r\nterrorists continue to receive training as well as \r\nfinancial and logistical support is a necessary element \r\nfor eliminating terrorism. \r\n In addition, Afghanistan is firmly committed to \r\nenhancing economic cooperation in the region. We \r\nrecently signed several trade agreements that seek to \r\nincrease bilateral and multilateral trade and create \r\nopportunities for prosperity. Afghanistan is a \r\nconnecting bridge between Central and South Asia, and \r\nall could benefit from economic cooperation, trade, and \r\ninvestment. That can be enhanced within the new \r\nframework of regional cooperation based on mutual \r\nand diverse commitments. \r\n Essential to our efforts is the continued support of \r\nour friends and allies. We appreciate their commitment \r\nand sacrifices, despite the economic struggles of recent \r\nyears. We aim to work actively together to move \r\nbeyond today’s military activities and share our \r\nmotivation for establishing stability and long-term \r\ncooperation. \r\n It is important to consistently assess our efforts. \r\nAt the same time, we must recognize the progress we \r\nhave made as well as the need to allow time for \r\ntransition to continue in this moment that is ripe for \r\nchange. The strength of our partnership with the \r\ninternational community is crucial for the stability of \r\nour people and the peoples of the world. \r\n Let me take this opportunity to reiterate our \r\ngratitude for the sincere support and commitment of \r\nthe United Nations and other international partners to \r\nachieve peace, stability and prosperity in Afghanistan. \r\nWe have confidence in the successful outcome of that \r\nsteadfast support. \r\n The current draft resolution on the situation in \r\nAfghanistan (A/65/L.9) is a reaffirmation of the \r\ncommitment of the international community to the \r\nbetterment of our country. We know all too well the \r\nseriousness of the challenges ahead, but with the \r\nstrength from enduring, and now overcoming, decades \r\nof war and tragedies, as well as with the sustained \r\nsupport of international partners, our nation can \r\nemerge, united for peace and prosperity. \r\n Our continued transition is not only about \r\nhanding over leadership to the Afghan Government, \r\nbut also transforming our entire national landscape and \r\nculture from one afflicted with war to one that is \r\ngraced with peace. \r\n Mrs. Aitimova (Kazakhstan): It is my honour to \r\nspeak today on behalf of the member States of the \r\nShanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO): the \r\nPeople’s Republic of China, the Kyrgyz Republic, the \r\nRussian Federation, the Republic of Tajikistan, the \r\nRepublic of Uzbekistan and my country, the Republic \r\nof Kazakhstan, on agenda item 38, “The situation in \r\nAfghanistan”. \r\n First of all, allow me to express the strong \r\ncommitment of the SCO member States to make a \r\ncontribution to the overall international effort to \r\naddress the existing problems of the Islamic Republic \r\nof Afghanistan, including through the SCO Contact \r\nGroup. \r\n The prevailing situation in Afghanistan and the \r\nscope of its future political stability and economic \r\nA/65/PV.44  \r\n \r\n10-61898 10 \r\n \r\ndevelopment were high on the agenda of the tenth \r\nmeeting of the Council of Heads of States of the SCO \r\nmember States held in Tashkent on 10 and 11 June \r\n2010. The declaration adopted by the Council \r\nunderscored the importance of attaining peace and \r\nstability in Afghanistan and the leading role of the \r\nUnited Nations in coordinating the efforts of the \r\ninternational community in resolving the situation in \r\nthat country. \r\n The SCO stands for achieving durable peace and \r\nspeedy stabilization of the political situation in the \r\nIslamic Republic of Afghanistan, recognizing the \r\nimportance of full respect for the deep historical, \r\nethno-demographic roots and traditions of the people \r\nof Afghanistan, as well as their diverse religious \r\nvalues. \r\n The SCO confirms its unwavering commitment to \r\nAfghanistan’s becoming a peaceful, self-sufficient, \r\nstable and democratic State free of terrorism and \r\nnarcotics. It also supports the Afghan Government-led \r\npeace process, especially in their implementation of the \r\nAfghan Peace and Reintegration Programme, which \r\naims to promote dialogue with those elements in \r\nopposition to the Government that are ready to \r\nrenounce violence, break ties with Al-Qaida and other \r\nterrorist organizations, denounce terrorism and accept \r\nthe Afghan Constitution, in full respect of the \r\nimplementation of measures and procedures introduced \r\nby the Security Council in its resolutions 1267 (1999), \r\n1822 (2008), 1904 (2009) and 1917 (2010), as well as \r\nother relevant resolutions of the Council. \r\n In that context, SCO member States note with \r\nsatisfaction the direct assistance rendered by the \r\nSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General, Mr. \r\nStaffan de Mistura, and the United Nations Assistance \r\nMission in Afghanistan in that process. We also support \r\nthe recommendations contained in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report on the situation in Afghanistan and its \r\nimplications for international peace and security \r\n(A/65/552). \r\n The Shanghai Cooperation Organization calls for \r\nthe implementation of the commitments made at the \r\nInternational Conference on Afghanistan in Kabul on \r\n20 July 2010 to further strengthen stability in \r\nAfghanistan, support the Kabul process of transition to \r\nAfghan authorities of the responsibility for governing \r\ntheir country, as well as international efforts for the \r\neffective implementation of projects for the economic \r\nreconstruction of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. \r\n We welcome the parliamentary elections, which \r\nwere held on 18 September this year, and commend the \r\npreparations undertaken for conducting them under \r\nvery difficult military-political conditions. The conduct \r\nof elections by the Afghans themselves demonstrates a \r\nforward step in the process of creating the conditions \r\nfor stabilization in Afghanistan over time. \r\n The success of the Kabul Conference and the \r\nAfghan parliamentary elections confirm once again the \r\nstance of the member States, as reflected in the \r\nTashkent Declaration, namely, that it would be \r\nimpossible to solve the Afghan problem solely by \r\nmilitary methods. \r\n Member States of the SCO consider the \r\nstrengthening of regional security and stability in \r\nCentral Asia as one of our regional organization’s \r\nhighest priorities in the context of its efforts to \r\ncounteract terrorism, separatism and extremism, drug \r\ntrafficking and transnational organized crime. It is \r\ndifficult to conceive of safety and stability in the \r\nCentral Asian region without addressing those \r\nproblems in Afghanistan. The SCO is therefore \r\nseriously concerned about the current situation in the \r\ncountry where these threats originate. We therefore \r\ndraw attention to the report of the Secretary-General, \r\nwhich states that the overall number of security \r\nincidents increased by 69 per cent in the current \r\nreporting period, which in turn imperils the security of \r\nour region and of the whole world. We therefore press \r\nfor a collective, multilateral effort to urgently combat \r\nthose dangers, which are on the rise. Achieving peace \r\nand stability in the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan is \r\na crucial factor for ensuring overall security to promote \r\nthe sustainable social and economic development of \r\nthe region. \r\n We are seriously concerned about the \r\nincreasingly elevated number of civilian casualties in \r\nAfghanistan, and reaffirm that all parties to armed \r\nconflict must take all feasible steps to ensure the \r\nprotection of civilians at risk. We also call for all \r\nparties to comply with their obligations under \r\ninternational humanitarian and human rights law and \r\nfor all appropriate measures to be taken to ensure the \r\nprotection of civilians. \r\n Owing to the serious threat to the security of SCO \r\nmember States, individually and collectively, we call \r\n A/65/PV.44\r\n \r\n11 10-61898 \r\n \r\non the international community to take urgent and \r\nprompt measures to combat, in particular, the illicit \r\ntrafficking of narcotics, which finances and supports \r\nthe powerful infrastructure and network of \r\ninternational terrorism. \r\n We believe that the production and trafficking of \r\ndrugs in Afghanistan and beyond have given rise to \r\ndrug-related crimes that pose a threat not only to \r\nnational but also to regional and international peace \r\nand stability, as stated in Security Council resolution \r\n1943 (2010). The SCO member States therefore urge \r\nthe international community to develop a global \r\nstrategy to effectively counteract that rampant form of \r\ncriminality, and call upon the Government of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Afghanistan, together with the \r\nInternational Security Assistance Force, to cooperate in \r\nthat effort, as well as to persevere in implementing the \r\nNational Drug Control Strategy. \r\n The SCO has acquired formidable and long-\r\nstanding experience in fighting terrorism, extremism \r\nand separatism. Our member States are committed to \r\nworking in cooperation with the United Nations and \r\nother national and international structures to assist \r\nAfghanistan’s efforts in that direction. The basic \r\npriorities for action are set out in the declaration \r\nadopted at the SCO special conference held in Moscow \r\nin March 2009. \r\n We aspire to actively help the friendly people of \r\nAfghanistan rebuild their independent, neutral, \r\npeaceful and prosperous State. We recognize the need \r\nto consolidate our efforts with those of the United \r\nNations, other regional and international organizations \r\nand key players, as well the parties involved in the \r\nhigh-level international conferences on Afghanistan. \r\n We also call for the full implementation of the \r\nrelevant General Assembly and Security Council \r\nresolutions relating to Afghanistan. \r\n Mr. Grube (Denmark): I would first of all like to \r\nassociate myself with the statement delivered by the \r\nrepresentative of Belgium on behalf of the European \r\nUnion. \r\n At the outset, I would like to use this opportunity \r\nto welcome the parliamentary elections held in \r\nSeptember in Afghanistan. Those elections constituted \r\nan important achievement for Afghanistan in that, for \r\nthe first time, they were organized and managed by \r\nAfghan institutions. The performance of both the \r\nAfghan electoral institutions and the Afghan National \r\nSecurity Forces deserve our recognition. Above all, it \r\nis a very welcome development that Afghan \r\ninstitutions have managed to organize and conduct an \r\nexercise as difficult as those elections. \r\n I also take note of the progress achieved in other \r\naspects of those elections in that the Afghan Parliament \r\nnow has 68 seats out of 249 reserved for women. It is \r\nimperative that women participate in all decision-\r\nmaking that affects their lives. Without the meaningful \r\nand real participation of women, it will be difficult to \r\nattain a peaceful Afghanistan. We now look forward to \r\nthe announcement of the final election results and to \r\nthe establishment of the new Parliament in \r\nAfghanistan. \r\n We are approaching yet another milestone in the \r\ndevelopment of a stable Afghanistan at the NATO \r\nSummit in Lisbon in two weeks’ time. While transition \r\nis an important component of the declaration on \r\nAfghanistan that will be adopted in Lisbon, it is \r\nimportant to maintain that the international community \r\nand the United Nations will continue to play a strong \r\nsupporting role in Afghanistan in the years to come. \r\n Denmark, for its part, is not about to leave \r\nAfghanistan. In line with the conclusions of the Kabul \r\nConference, we will focus even more on strengthening \r\nthe capability and capacity of the Afghan National \r\nSecurity Forces and on broader civilian capacity-\r\nbuilding, while gradually becoming less engaged in \r\ndirect combat operations. We support and encourage \r\nthe transition of lead responsibility to the Afghan \r\nauthorities, but this will have to be based on the \r\nconditions on the ground and the overall capacities of \r\nAfghan institutions, not least the Security Forces. \r\n Denmark fully supports the international \r\npartnership with Afghanistan. Through that \r\npartnership, we will continue to assist the build-up of \r\nAfghanistan’s capabilities to manage its own affairs. \r\nTherefore, the partnership wishes to stress that \r\ntransition does not mean exit. Our intention is clear: we \r\nwill stay committed to the Afghan case and we will \r\ncontinue to increase our focus on the civilian aspects of \r\nthe agreed transition framework. As a demonstration of \r\nthat commitment, Denmark will strengthen its support \r\nfor the rule of law sector and the area of governance, \r\nboth at the national level and in Helmand province. \r\n That having been said, I want to reiterate that a \r\nsustainable transition hinges on the ability of the \r\nA/65/PV.44  \r\n \r\n10-61898 12 \r\n \r\nAfghan Government to ensure security, demonstrate \r\nprogress in governance and provide basic services. The \r\nAfghan Government must therefore demonstrate results \r\nin both socio-economic development and institutional \r\nreform, including increased transparency and sustained \r\nefforts to fight corruption. We welcome the \r\ncommitments undertaken by the Afghan Government in \r\nthat regard at the Kabul Conference. It is important to \r\ndevote all our focus to the actual implementation of \r\nthose commitments and the benchmarks set. \r\n We also took note of the Peace Jirga and its \r\nconclusions with regard to reintegration and \r\nreconciliation. It was welcome that the Kabul \r\nConference further endorsed the strategy of the Afghan \r\nGovernment in that regard. Denmark supports that \r\nprocess and encourages all countries engaged in \r\nAfghanistan, including its neighbours, to play an active \r\nand constructive role. At the same time, we must all \r\nwork to ensure that the progress achieved so far — also \r\nin terms of the fundamental rights of the Afghan \r\npopulation — is not sacrificed as part of a political \r\nsolution. \r\n I also want to extend my compliments to the \r\nSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General, \r\nStaffan de Mistura, and his staff for all their efforts. \r\nThe United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan \r\n(UNAMA) is carrying out an ambitious mandate under \r\ndifficult circumstances. Denmark will continue to \r\nsupport UNAMA, and would welcome its broadened \r\npresence across the country, with a view to enabling \r\nmore efficient coordination in Afghanistan. \r\n A strong United Nations is important in all \r\ncountries, but particularly in post-conflict settings, \r\nwhere the Organization is most needed as a strong and \r\nreliable partner able to provide the essential peace \r\ndividend. In that regard, we support the increased \r\nengagement of United Nations funds and programmes \r\nin Afghanistan. They play a pivotal role in enhancing \r\nthe Afghan Government’s ability to deliver public \r\nservices to the population in an efficient, effective, \r\nequitable and accountable manner. That is key to \r\nstrengthening broad public participation and creating \r\nan environment that is conducive to sustainable \r\nlivelihoods and ensuring long-term stability and \r\ndevelopment. \r\n In closing, I want to commend the Assembly for \r\nconcluding its negotiations on the draft resolution \r\n(A/65/L.9). The fact that we are here today to vote on \r\nthe important subject of Afghanistan proves to me that \r\nAfghanistan remains at the forefront of everyone’s \r\nattention, and I am convinced that we will continue to \r\nwork together to reach a future stable Afghanistan. \r\n Mrs. Smith (Norway): Since 1979 the General \r\nAssembly has repeatedly gathered to reiterate the key \r\nmessage contained in the draft resolution (A/65/L.9) \r\nthat this Assembly will act on shortly: a manifestation \r\nof common responsibility and commitment to support \r\nthe Afghan people in securing a brighter future. \r\nNorway is again pleased to co-sponsor the draft \r\nresolution, which recognizes the important progress \r\nAfghanistan has made in rebuilding itself but also \r\nacknowledges that more work has to be done. We \r\ncommend in particular Germany for that delegation’s \r\nable facilitation of the draft resolution. \r\n Today’s draft resolution reflects the fact that \r\nAfghans must take increasing responsibility for their \r\nown affairs. A steady and responsible transition to \r\nAfghan leadership is a key to sustainability. It also \r\nreflects a new, evolving partnership between \r\nAfghanistan and the international community, based on \r\ntrust and joint commitments. The draft resolution \r\nreminds us, however, that the transition will be a \r\ncomplex task rather than an easy one. Some may think \r\nthat the transfer of increased authority to the Afghans \r\nis a euphemism for a quick solution or premature exit. \r\nOn the contrary, it requires a lot of hard work, political \r\nwill and systematic efforts by all actors; but without a \r\nrobust Afghan leadership we will not succeed. \r\n In that regard, the draft resolution fits well into \r\nthe key message from the Kabul Conference, which \r\ncalled for a renewed partnership between Afghanistan \r\nand the international community, reinforced by a \r\ndeepened contract between the Afghan State and its \r\ncitizens. From now on, the international community \r\nshould respect Afghanistan’s own visions and \r\npriorities, and also demonstrate greater unity of \r\npurpose and better coordination. More funds have to \r\npass through Afghan budgets, to the extent that the \r\nGovernment’s limited capacity to absorb the resources \r\nallows. This means shifting away from quick-impact \r\nprojects, parallel organizations and multiple \r\nuncoordinated projects towards enabling Afghan \r\ninstitutions to design and implement specific Afghan \r\nnational programmes. It is well documented that so-\r\ncalled quick-impact projects carried out by military \r\nforces rarely bring about stability or achieve what they \r\nset out to do. We will continue to stress the need for a \r\n A/65/PV.44\r\n \r\n13 10-61898 \r\n \r\nclear division of roles between military and civilian \r\nefforts, while the humanitarian space is shrinking. \r\n In return, the Afghan Government has to bring \r\nabout real change in the lives of the Afghan people by \r\ndelivering justice and good governance, combating \r\ncorruption and improving public services. This is not \r\nmerely a desire on the part of the international \r\ncommunity but first and foremost the demand of the \r\nAfghan people. The Afghan leadership must, it is true, \r\nenable political processes that are inclusive and truly \r\nnational in their nature. A pluralistic society with \r\nenhanced participation is essential if durable peace, \r\nstability and development are to be achieved. Civil \r\nsociety institutions and their capacity to deliver \r\nservices deserve greater attention than has hitherto \r\nbeen the case, as does their ability to monitor human \r\nrights, even as investment in rebuilding State \r\ninstitutions continues. All of these are ambitious goals \r\nbut not unrealistic ones. We are hopeful, because the \r\nKabul Conference showed that we have a shared vision \r\non how to move forward. \r\n A durable peace requires a political settlement. \r\nThe Peace Jirga expressed a national consensus for \r\npeace and framed the terms on how to reach out. \r\nFurthermore, the Peace Jirga also identified poor \r\ngovernance and abuse of authority as one of the causes \r\nof instability. To sum up: injustice, corruption and \r\nweak governance are all strategic concerns. \r\n Norway strongly supports an Afghan-led political \r\nprocess — including talks with those members of the \r\narmed opposition who are willing to renounce violence \r\nand resume a civilian life — as part of a viable Afghan \r\npolitical settlement. Any political process should be \r\nbased on the principle of inclusiveness and be \r\nconducted in accordance with the Constitution and \r\ninternational human rights. \r\n Furthermore, a durable peace requires that talks \r\nmove towards a structured political dialogue, \r\nconducted in a way that allows for the participation of \r\ncivil society groups, including women. The \r\nparticipation of women is key to any durable peace \r\nprocess, since they constitute half of the population of \r\nAfghanistan. Unfortunately, it is often the ordinary \r\nAfghan people who lose out in the ongoing struggle for \r\npower. We must strive to prevent this. The Afghan \r\npeople need to be included in a meaningful way and \r\nhave their rights protected, if a durable peace process \r\nis to be achieved. \r\n Parliamentary elections were held in September, \r\ndespite the grave security situation. It is too soon to \r\npass final judgement, as the results will not be clear \r\nuntil the Afghan electoral institutions have finished \r\ncounting the votes, verified the results and adjudicated \r\ncomplaints. However, in the future, it will be important \r\nto meet the need for long-term electoral reform by \r\nstrengthening the capacity of Afghan electoral \r\ninstitutions. Though it will be a long-term task to \r\ndevelop a political system that today’s divided \r\npopulation regards as legitimate, we encourage such an \r\nAfghan-led reform process, which should emphasize \r\ncivic education as well as efforts to strengthen \r\nParliament as an institution. \r\n Let me emphasize that, in a time of transition, the \r\nrole of the United Nations Assistance Mission in \r\nAfghanistan is critical, particularly as the international \r\nguarantor of the integrity of the transition to greater \r\nAfghan leadership. Norway condemns the terrorist \r\nattack on the United Nations facilities in Herat on 23 \r\nOctober. Sadly, that attack was another brutal reminder \r\nthat security and stability in Afghanistan are still a long \r\nway off. \r\n In conclusion, let me underscore that Norway will \r\ncontinue to work towards stability and a safe and \r\nsecure environment for Afghanistan and its region. We \r\nare committed for the long haul, as transition does not \r\nmean exit. However, we are prepared for a changing \r\nenvironment. This demands a certain flexibility and the \r\nability to make adjustments in our civilian support \r\nwhen necessary. Together with its international \r\npartners and in close cooperation with the Afghan \r\nGovernment and Afghan civil society, Norway will \r\ncontinue its efforts to build sufficient capacity so that \r\nAfghans can safely run their country. \r\n Mr. Ragaglini (Italy): While aligning itself with \r\nthe statement made by the representative of Belgium \r\non behalf of the European Union, Italy would like to \r\nadd a few remarks to today’s discussion. \r\n Italy welcomes, supports and is a sponsor of the \r\ndraft resolution before us on the situation in \r\nAfghanistan (A/65/L.9) and looks forward to its \r\nadoption by consensus. That will confirm the ongoing \r\ncommitment of the United Nations and all its Member \r\nStates to assisting Afghanistan on the path towards \r\nautonomy, stability and democracy, in line with the \r\nprinciples of effective partnership agreed at the Kabul \r\nConference last July. \r\nA/65/PV.44  \r\n \r\n10-61898 14 \r\n \r\n As was stated at the Kabul Conference and \r\nreiterated at the meeting with the Special \r\nRepresentative for Afghanistan and the Special Envoy \r\nfor Pakistan in Rome on 18 October, the transition will \r\nentail a gradual shift to an international presence with a \r\nstrong civilian focus, which will enable the Afghan \r\nauthorities to undertake a parallel assumption of \r\nresponsibilities in security, governance and \r\ndevelopment. That joint endeavour will seek to lay the \r\ninstitutional and economic foundations for a stable and \r\nindependent Afghanistan, through an incremental \r\nprocess based on gradualism, ownership and the \r\nongoing assessment of agreed and verifiable \r\nparameters. \r\n Italy is firmly committed to that course of action. \r\nOur focus is on the training and mentoring of the \r\nAfghan National Security Forces and the development \r\nof institutional capacities at the local and central \r\nlevels. We are working on improving living conditions \r\nand gradually moving from humanitarian assistance to \r\nthe promotion of local entrepreneurship, capitalizing \r\non existing natural and human resources. Those factors \r\nare, we believe, key to sustainable and balanced \r\ndevelopment. \r\n We are persuaded that the growth, governance \r\nand stability of Afghanistan are closely linked and \r\nmutually reinforcing. We therefore encourage prompt \r\nimplementation of the national development \r\nprogrammes endorsed at the Kabul Conference and a \r\nrenewed effort to address shortfalls in governance, rule \r\nof law and transparency. It is incumbent on the Afghan \r\nGovernment to take concrete action to meet its \r\npeople’s demands for basic services, justice and \r\neconomic opportunities. More effective regional \r\ncooperation, involving the most significant countries \r\nfor the stability of the region, will also play a key role \r\nin promoting security and development in the country. \r\n Italy looks forward to the outcome of the \r\nparliamentary elections, which represent a crucial test \r\nof Afghan ownership and accountability and a further \r\nstep towards a functional democratic dynamic. We \r\nacknowledge the efforts already made to ensure the \r\ntransparency and credibility of the whole process and \r\ncommend the increasing democratic awareness of the \r\nAfghan people. Along the same lines, we reiterate the \r\nurgent need for an overall and inclusive long-term \r\nreform of the electoral process, under the aegis and \r\nwith the assistance of the United Nations. \r\n In that regard, we also wish to express our \r\ngratitude to all the staff of the United Nations \r\nAssistance Mission in Afghanistan, and especially to \r\nSpecial Representative De Mistura, for their pivotal \r\nrole in coordinating the numerous initiatives in support \r\nof the elections and in ensuring the coherence of the \r\ninternational effort in Afghanistan. \r\n Mr. Mac-Donald (Suriname), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n In preparation for the upcoming transition \r\nprocess, we reaffirm our long-term commitment to \r\nfacilitating the achievement, for the benefit of the \r\nAfghan people, of non-reversible and credible \r\nobjectives in the fields of security, governance and \r\ndevelopment.  \r\n Mr. Aslov (Tajikistan) (spoke in Russian): First \r\nof all I would like to thank the President of the General \r\nAssembly for convening this meeting on the situation \r\nin Afghanistan. Tajikistan aligns itself with the \r\nstatements made earlier by the representative of the \r\nRussian Federation on behalf of the Collective Security \r\nTreaty Organization and by the representative of \r\nKazakhstan on behalf of the Shanghai Cooperation \r\nOrganization. \r\n Tajikistan is pleased to be among the sponsors of \r\ndraft resolution A/65/L.9, which will, we hope, be \r\nadopted today by the General Assembly by consensus, \r\nas in previous years. In that regard we express our \r\nsincere appreciation to the Federal Republic of \r\nGermany for its efforts and mediation in the \r\ndiscussions leading up to the draft resolution. \r\n Tajikistan and Afghanistan are connected by \r\nmany historical and cultural ties. The official visit of \r\nPresident Emomali Rahmon a week ago to Kabul, his \r\ntalks with Afghan President Hamid Karzai and the \r\npackage of bilateral agreements signed as the outcome \r\nof that visit have once again demonstrated the \r\naspirations of our two countries to further strengthen \r\nexisting bonds, develop an enhanced, mutually \r\nbeneficial cooperation in varying fields and strengthen \r\ngood-neighbourly relations. We fully support the \r\nefforts of the Afghan Government to achieve national \r\nreconciliation undertaken on the basis of the decisions \r\nof the Peace Jirga. \r\n We congratulate the leadership and people of \r\nAfghanistan for successfully holding general \r\nparliamentary elections in the country. We welcome the \r\n A/65/PV.44\r\n \r\n15 10-61898 \r\n \r\nefforts of the international community, through the \r\nUnited Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan and \r\nthe International Security Assistance Force, aimed at \r\nestablishing lasting peace and stability in that long-\r\nsuffering country. \r\n Tajikistan is also making its contribution to the \r\nprocess of establishing sustainable peace and stability \r\nin Afghanistan. My country is providing specialized \r\ntraining centres for training and retraining staff from \r\nAfghan law enforcement agencies, in particular the \r\nregional college of the Organization for Security and \r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE), which was established \r\ntwo years ago in Dushanbe. Clearly, our common \r\nlanguage will contribute to the training of Afghan \r\nexperts in Tajikistan. Undoubtedly, the fight against \r\ndrug trafficking, terrorism and organized crime \r\nrequires the use of military force. However, it is not \r\npossible to eradicate those threats by the use of \r\nmilitary force alone. To ensure a peaceful society, it is \r\nnecessary to rebuild the economy and restore the \r\nagriculture and infrastructure of the country. \r\n In this context, Tajikistan stresses the need for \r\nwider use of Afghanistan’s economic capacities and \r\nvast natural resources. That is an important factor in \r\nsolving many problems of the country, which has been \r\ndevastated by years of war. In the current environment, \r\nenergy is critical to rebuilding the devastated economy \r\nof Afghanistan. Hydropower plants currently operating \r\nand those under construction in my country are capable \r\nnot only of meeting Afghanistan’s needs for clean and \r\naffordable energy but also of promoting broad \r\nagricultural development through the restoration and \r\nimprovement of the irrigation system in Afghanistan. \r\nIn that context, I would like to stress the importance of \r\nprojects related to building power transmission lines \r\npassing through the territory of Afghanistan, in \r\nparticular the Central Asia-South Asia 1000 project and \r\nthe PTL Solar Sangtuda-Mazar-e-Sharif-Herat-\r\nMashhad project. We also support the project of \r\nbuilding a pipeline from Turkmenistan through the \r\nterritory of Afghanistan to Tajikistan and Pakistan, \r\nwhich, in addition to filling the needs of the region for \r\nnatural gas, will also create a reliable income source \r\nfor Afghanistan. \r\n Afghanistan, because of its favourable geographic \r\nlocation, can play an important role in the development \r\nof regional integration processes. With globalization, \r\nthe value of Afghanistan’s geographical location as a \r\ncrossroads linking different regions of the Asian \r\ncontinent can only increase. Tajikistan fully supports \r\nthe development and implementation of infrastructure \r\nprojects in the field of transportation and \r\ncommunication in Afghanistan and in the entire region. \r\nSuch promising projects as building a rail line to Herat \r\nfrom Sherkhan Bandar, as well as the Mazar-e-Sharif \r\nto Hairatan and Aqina to Sheberghan and Turghundi to \r\nKushka rail lines, are expected to be completed in the \r\nfuture. The connection of Sherkhan Bandar with Lower \r\nPanj in Tajikistan and Hairatan with Mazar-e-Sharif \r\nand Aqina with Imam Nazar in Turkmenistan and \r\nTurghundi with Kushka in Turkmenistan as well as \r\nHerat with Torbat in Iran will turn this route into a \r\ntransit railway of regional importance, which will bring \r\nsignificant annual profit to Afghanistan. Those and \r\nother priority projects were adopted by the Council of \r\nForeign Ministers of the member countries of the \r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, whose latest \r\nmeeting was held in May in Dushanbe. Currently, there \r\nare five road bridges across the border river Panj that \r\nconnect Tajikistan and Afghanistan. Construction \r\nprojects for additional bridges at the Tajik-Afghan \r\nborder are under consideration. \r\n Tajikistan and Afghanistan are connected by a \r\nfibre-optic communication line. Tajikistan is ready to \r\nincrease the number of such lines with Afghanistan, \r\nwhich in turn could provide a stable link between \r\nAfghanistan and other countries in the region. \r\n Establishing peace and security in Afghanistan \r\nwill largely depend on extensive and effective \r\ninternational and regional cooperation as well as on \r\nsincere and consistent efforts by the international \r\ncommunity to achieve the goals that resonate with the \r\nhopes and aspirations of the Afghan people. We \r\nexpress our hope that the General Assembly draft \r\nresolution before us will serve that noble goal. \r\n Mr. Barimani (Islamic Republic of Iran): Allow \r\nme to extend our gratitude to the Secretary-General and \r\nMr. Staffan de Mistura, Special Representative and \r\nHead of the United Nations Assistance Mission in \r\nAfghanistan (UNAMA) and all his colleagues in that \r\nMission for their firm commitment and valuable \r\ndedication to strengthening peace and stability in \r\nAfghanistan. The central role of the United Nations in \r\ncoordinating international efforts in that country is of \r\nparamount importance and enjoys our full support. I \r\nwould also like here to salute the sacrifices made by \r\nUnited Nations personnel in Afghanistan. \r\nA/65/PV.44  \r\n \r\n10-61898 16 \r\n \r\n We are very pleased at the progress achieved in \r\nall areas so far by our brotherly neighbour, in particular \r\nwith regard to security and order and the formation of \r\nrepresentative political institutions. The Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran appreciates the recent parliamentary \r\nelection held in Afghanistan and congratulates its \r\npeople for their participation in an election that was \r\nconsidered to be of high importance for a better future \r\nof the country. The recent election was to a great extent \r\nan Afghan-led and Afghan-managed process where \r\neven the allegations of misconduct were investigated \r\nby Afghan authorities in accordance with Afghan law. \r\n The achievements and progress made in \r\nAfghanistan have been overshadowed by the present \r\nchallenges prevailing in the country. Challenges such \r\nas insecurity, lack of infrastructure, narcotic drugs and \r\nthe issues related to refugees remain sources of major \r\nconcern. \r\n Foreign forces entered Afghanistan with the aim \r\nof establishing peace and security and of rebuilding the \r\ncountry. Nine years have passed since then. According \r\nto many official reports, there has been an increase in \r\nthe degree of insecurity compared to last year, which is \r\na clear indication that the increase in the number of \r\nforeign troops and military operations does not \r\nnecessarily contribute to solving problems in \r\nAfghanistan; rather, it adds to the degree of violence \r\nthere. One reason for that situation is the \r\ndisenchantment of the people with regard to the \r\nconduct of those foreign forces. \r\n The Afghan Government officials say that 9 \r\nmillion people in Afghanistan are living in extreme \r\npoverty, while two years ago only 5 million Afghans \r\nlived under the poverty line. The recent floods across \r\nAfghanistan and in neighbouring countries have \r\nworsened the situation and caused a rise in the price of \r\nsuch food products as rice, cooking oil and meat, \r\nwhich has put many Afghans, who are among the \r\npoorest people in the world, at a high risk of food \r\nshortages. \r\n In the meantime, it is odd that a United States \r\nGovernment audit has found that nearly $18 billion of \r\nthe money paid to thousands of American firms to \r\nrebuild war-ravaged Afghanistan remain unaccounted \r\nfor. The question remains: where has all that money \r\ngone? Is it not that all that money has gone to fill the \r\npockets of big weapons manufacturers, security \r\ncontractors and so forth? \r\n It is now high time to analyse the developments \r\nduring the past nine years, since the start of the \r\nmilitary takeover of Afghanistan, in order to see \r\nexactly in which areas there has been progress and in \r\nwhich areas there has been a lack of progress. We \r\nshould also avoid using stereotyped or imported \r\nprescriptions and admit that security and development \r\nare interlinked. Insecurity has the most severe adverse \r\neffects on development, and underdevelopment is a \r\nviable threat to security. Our approach should be based \r\non the realities on the ground and on social structures \r\nand historical experience. \r\n It is now clear that the hearts and minds of the \r\nAfghan people, who have undergone many hardships \r\nand much suffering in recent decades, cannot be won \r\nby relying on military operations. Instead of \r\ndispatching more troops and private security \r\ncontractors to the country, there is an urgent need for \r\nthe foreign forces to leave Afghanistan. There is also \r\nan urgent need to strengthen the Afghan national army \r\nand national police to enable them to take charge of \r\nsecurity in Afghanistan. It is also urgent that the \r\ncontrol and management of Afghan affairs be handed \r\nover to the people and the Government of that country. \r\n It is crystal clear that the narcotic drugs problem \r\nis still one of the most serious challenges that \r\nAfghanistan is facing. That menace has hindered the \r\ncountry’s progress towards development and has \r\nendangered the security of Afghanistan, along with that \r\nof the region. Moreover, narcotic drugs, as the \r\nfinancial source of terrorism in Afghanistan, have \r\nserved as a breeding ground for terrorists, extremists \r\nand illegal groups who are attempting to destabilize the \r\nAfghan Government. Fortunately, during the past year, \r\naccording to the recent Afghanistan Opium Survey \r\nissued by the United Nations Office on Drugs and \r\nCrime, there has been a drop in the production of \r\nnarcotic drugs, the main reason for which has been \r\nplant infections. \r\n For decades, Iran has been at the forefront of a \r\nfull-scale war against the smuggling of narcotic drugs. \r\nThousands of Iranian law enforcement personnel have \r\nlost their lives or have been injured, and billions of \r\ndollars have been spent to combat drug traffickers. We \r\nhave shouldered a great burden in that fight and \r\nstrongly reiterate our call on those who bear the \r\nresponsibility for combating narcotic drugs on behalf \r\nof the international community to take firm and \r\nmeasurable steps to curb that threat as soon as possible. \r\n A/65/PV.44\r\n \r\n17 10-61898 \r\n \r\n On the issue of Afghan refugees, it is worth \r\nmentioning that we have extended our hospitality to \r\nmore than 3 million Afghan nationals over the past \r\nthree decades. At present, more than 1 million Afghan \r\nrefugees are registered in Iran, while a great number of \r\nunregistered Afghans are also living in our country. For \r\nyears, Afghan nationals have continued to enjoy Iran’s \r\neducational and welfare facilities, inter alia, and to \r\nbenefit from the same subsidies that our own people \r\nreceive. \r\n Despite the challenges in Afghanistan, much has \r\nbeen achieved by the country in its journey towards \r\nstability, security and development. We believe that the \r\nnew approach by the Government of Afghanistan, \r\nadopted in a very prudent and clever manner and aimed \r\nat moving the country towards development and the \r\nbuilding up of its infrastructure, is a great achievement. \r\nThe Kabul Conference held in August this year \r\nprovided us with an opportunity to reassure Afghans \r\nthat, as they continue their journey, the international \r\ncommunity, including neighbouring States, stand with \r\nthem, offering their help and support. \r\n Iran, along with other neighbouring countries and \r\nthe world at large, has a vital interest in a secure, stable \r\nand prosperous Afghanistan at peace with itself and \r\nwith its neighbours. In recent years, we have \r\nundertaken some projects, mainly relying on our own \r\nresources, aimed at rebuilding the country with a focus \r\non infrastructure and capacity-building. So far, the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran’s official assistance to \r\nAfghanistan for those projects amounts to \r\napproximately $500 million. \r\n In the area of regional cooperation, the countries \r\nneighbouring Afghanistan share critical interests in \r\nAfghanistan’s security and long-term stability and are \r\nplaying their role in promoting Afghanistan’s socio-\r\neconomic development. This week, a conference on a \r\nregional approach to developments in Afghanistan was \r\nheld in Tehran, during which the role of neighbouring \r\ncountries was elaborated and some concrete measures \r\nwere taken to strengthen a regional framework in \r\nhelping Afghanistan with development projects. We \r\nintend to work within that framework, which was \r\nadapted from a successful cooperation model employed \r\nby countries neighbouring Iraq. The support of the \r\ninternational community in that endeavour could help \r\nus to strengthen this approach. \r\n In that context, several rounds of meetings have \r\nalso taken place among the heads of State and Foreign \r\nMinisters of Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran and Tajikistan. In that regard, \r\nUNAMA’s involvement in encouraging regional \r\ncountries to cooperate in putting an end to the narcotics \r\ntrade and the illegal movement of people and \r\nsupporting Afghanistan in its efforts to achieve security \r\nand stability are very much welcome. \r\n Let me conclude by expressing our hope for a \r\nbetter and more prosperous future for Afghanistan. As \r\nin the past, we extend our full support to the people \r\nand Government of Afghanistan in achieving security, \r\nstability and comprehensive and sustainable \r\ndevelopment for the country. \r\n Mr. Quinlan (Australia): Australia welcomes the \r\nopportunity to speak in this debate and to endorse and \r\nsponsor the draft resolution on the situation in \r\nAfghanistan (A/65/L.9). \r\n Australia’s own Parliament is itself in the middle \r\nof a debate on Afghanistan and our commitment to it. \r\nThere is no more serious, or difficult, work than \r\nbuilding the defences of peace. The Australian \r\nGovernment has reaffirmed that we remain committed \r\nto international efforts to build a more secure and \r\nstable Afghanistan. \r\n We welcome the international community’s \r\nrenewed support, expressed through the London and \r\nKabul Conferences, as well as the new determination \r\nby the Afghan Government to support the Afghan \r\npeople. We encourage the Afghan Government to \r\ncontinue to address the commitments it made in \r\nLondon and Kabul, particularly regarding combating \r\ncorruption and ensuring access to justice for all \r\nAfghans. \r\n We also encourage all international partners in \r\nAfghanistan to support the Kabul process — the \r\ncentrepiece of the Conference held there — with its \r\nfocus on Afghan leadership and ownership. The \r\nSeptember parliamentary elections reflected such \r\nownership. We acknowledge the efforts made by \r\nAfghan institutions to put in place measures to ensure a \r\ncredible, transparent and legitimate election and to \r\naddress alleged irregularities themselves. \r\n Nonetheless, we believe that long-term electoral \r\nreform is required if the Afghan public’s confidence in \r\ndemocratic institutions is to be strengthened. The \r\nA/65/PV.44  \r\n \r\n10-61898 18 \r\n \r\nAfghan Government’s commitment made at the Kabul \r\nConference to initiate, within six months, a strategy for \r\nlong-term electoral reform is an important first step, \r\nbut only a first step. \r\n Australia also welcomes the recognition in \r\ntoday’s draft resolution of the Afghan Government’s \r\nplan for a phased transition to full Afghan \r\nresponsibility for security, with the Afghan National \r\nSecurity Forces leading and conducting military \r\noperations in all provinces by the end of 2014. \r\n The commitment of Afghanistan’s international \r\npartners to support the Afghan Government in creating \r\nthe conditions necessary to allow for transition is \r\nobviously critical. Security transition should not, as \r\nother speakers have said today, be seen as the end of \r\nour commitment in Afghanistan. Transition does not \r\nsignal withdrawal. After transition to Afghan-led \r\nsecurity, we must recognize that Afghanistan will \r\ncontinue to require support for training, defence \r\ncooperation and aid and development. During \r\nAustralia’s current parliamentary debate on \r\nAfghanistan, Prime Minister Gillard explicitly \r\nrecognized that when she said that \r\n “Australia will not abandon Afghanistan, but we \r\nmust be very realistic about the future. Transition \r\nwill take some years. We will be engaged through \r\nthis decade at least”. \r\n Australia recognizes that the conflict in \r\nAfghanistan will not be won by military means alone; \r\nit requires a political strategy. We welcome the fact \r\nthat the draft resolution highlights the steps that have \r\nbeen taken in this area over the past year, including the \r\nholding of the Afghan National Consultative Peace \r\nJirga in June and the establishment of the High Peace \r\nCouncil. \r\n A long-term solution in Afghanistan ultimately \r\nrequires reconciliation between the Afghan \r\nGovernment and insurgents. The reconciliation efforts \r\nbeing led by the Afghan Government need to be \r\nconsistent with the conditions it itself has set, including \r\naccepting the Afghan Constitution, renouncing \r\nviolence and severing links to terrorist groups. These \r\nundertakings need to be met and observed in practice. \r\nAustralia itself is supporting the political strategy, \r\nincluding through our $25 million commitment to the \r\nAfghan Government’s peace and reintegration \r\nprogramme, conditional on the establishment of \r\nappropriate governance arrangements and a role for \r\ndonors in the management of the fund. \r\n Australia believes that the Security Council-\r\nmandated International Security Assistance Force \r\n(ISAF) strategy — which focuses on a comprehensive \r\nand integrated civilian-military approach, protecting \r\nthe population and building Afghan capacity — \r\nprovides the best prospect for a stable and secure \r\nAfghanistan. Australia is the largest non-NATO \r\ncontributor to ISAF, and the tenth largest overall. In \r\naddition, since the London Conference in January, we \r\nhave delivered a 50 per cent increase in our civilian \r\ncommitment, including by providing a senior civilian \r\nto head the provincial reconstruction team in the \r\nsouthern province of Uruzgan. \r\n We have also increased our aid to Afghanistan by \r\n50 per cent this year, to a total of $123 million. We are \r\naligning our assistance with the priorities outlined by \r\nthe Afghan Government itself under the Afghan \r\nNational Development Strategy. We are also committed \r\nto channelling at least 50 per cent of this aid through \r\nAfghan Government systems, consistent with our \r\nundertakings at the Kabul Conference in July. \r\n As we know, progress is always slow, but it is \r\nbeing made by the Afghan Government and its \r\npartners. In primary education, school enrolments \r\nincreased from 1 million in 2001 to around 6 million \r\ntoday. Some 2 million of those are girls. There were \r\nnone in 2001. Nothing better symbolizes the fall of the \r\nTaliban than 2 million Afghan girls learning to read. \r\n In basic health services, infant mortality \r\ndecreased by 22 per cent between 2002 and 2008. \r\nImmunization rates for children are now in the 70 to \r\n90 per cent range. In vital economic infrastructure, \r\nalmost 10,000 kilometres of roads have been \r\nrehabilitated, and 10 million Afghans now have access \r\nto telecommunications, as compared to only 20,000 in \r\n2001. There are other indicators of progress. \r\n Australia’s own major efforts remain \r\nconcentrated in Uruzgan, where we are seeking to \r\nimprove the Afghan Government’s capacity to deliver \r\ncore services in health, education and transport, \r\nincluding through public infrastructure, and, critically, \r\nto generate job opportunities. \r\n Our capacity-building effort in the province also \r\nincludes the important work being done by the police, \r\nas we help build and develop the Afghan National \r\n A/65/PV.44\r\n \r\n19 10-61898 \r\n \r\nPolice capability to assume greater responsibility for \r\nlaw and order in the province. We have now trained \r\nalmost 1,000 Afghan police personnel in Uruzgan. Our \r\nefforts have also contributed to the successful targeting \r\nof corrupt officials and the tackling of major crimes, \r\nincluding in the area of counter-narcotics. \r\n We have many challenges to face with regard to \r\npolicing, the lack of public confidence being one. \r\nAccess to justice is another. Women in Uruzgan \r\nprovince, where our police are mainly based, have \r\nalmost no access to justice and suffer from poor \r\nknowledge of their rights. There are only three female \r\nAfghan police officers in the major town of Tarin \r\nKowt, but that is three more than was previously the \r\ncase. Progress always involves such small, incremental \r\nsteps, but it is progress nevertheless. \r\n Such civilian enhancements build on Australia’s \r\nmilitary contribution — we have some 1,550 defence \r\npersonnel deployed in Afghanistan. The focus of their \r\neffort remains on training and mentoring the Afghan \r\nNational Army 4th Brigade in Uruzgan so it can \r\nconduct independent security operations. \r\n Of course, we want to bring those Australians \r\nhome as soon as possible; and the Afghan people want \r\nto stand on their own as soon as possible. But \r\nachieving the shared mission we have is critical to \r\nachieving both of those objectives. The commitment of \r\nthe international community remains central to that \r\npurpose. The Security Council authorized the creation \r\nof ISAF in 2001, through resolution 1386 (2001). That \r\nresolution has been renewed on 10 occasions since. \r\nISAF now has a combined coalition force in the field \r\nof some 120,000 troops from 48 nations. More than \r\n70 countries and international organizations attended \r\nthe London Conference, and around 70 the Kabul \r\nConference in July. In that context, we recognize in \r\nparticular the important role that Afghanistan’s \r\nneighbours have to play. \r\n To conclude, Afghanistan’s international partners \r\nrecognize the need to defend, maintain and strengthen \r\nan international order that does not tolerate the \r\nactivities of international terrorist organizations. Our \r\ncollaboration has protected that international order and \r\nmade it increasingly difficult for international terrorist \r\norganizations to do harm anywhere — and to all of us. \r\nAustralia would encourage others to protect the \r\ncitizens of our nations by standing firm against \r\ninternational terrorist organizations such as Al-Qaida, \r\nso that they will not find safe haven again in \r\nAfghanistan. \r\n Mrs. Dunlop (Brazil): I have the honour to \r\nacknowledge the presence of two representatives of the \r\nBrazilian Parliament in the General Assembly Hall, \r\nnamely, Senator Sérgio Zambiasi from the state of Rio \r\nGrande do Sul and Senator Antonio Carlos Valadares \r\nfrom the state of Sergipe. \r\n The annual debate of the General Assembly on \r\nthe situation in Afghanistan offers a valuable \r\nopportunity for us to reaffirm our common endeavour \r\nto support the Afghan Government and its people in \r\ntheir commitment to a peaceful, stable and prosperous \r\ncountry. This year it is also an opportunity to pay \r\ntribute to the important work carried out by Special \r\nRepresentative Staffan de Mistura and the United \r\nNations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) \r\ndespite the difficult circumstances in which they \r\noperate. \r\n Since our last debate, there have been significant \r\ndevelopments in the efforts to strengthen Afghanistan’s \r\nresponsibility for its own security, governance and \r\ndevelopment. President Karzai’s inaugural speech in \r\nNovember 2009 initiated an important transition \r\nprocess in the drive to increase Afghanistan’s \r\nownership of its own future. This was symbolically \r\nreflected in the holding of the first international \r\nconference on Afghanistan on Afghan soil in several \r\ndecades. The Kabul Conference renewed the \r\npartnership between the Afghan Government and the \r\ninternational community. Its outcomes deserve the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s strongest support. \r\n One of the most important elements of that \r\nreinvigorated partnership is the process of transitioning \r\nto full Afghan responsibility for security on the basis of \r\nmutually agreed conditions. Progress in meeting these \r\nconditions will depend not only on improving the \r\nrecruitment and training of Afghan forces; another key \r\nfactor will be providing those forces with the \r\nassistance and equipment needed to perform their \r\nfunctions in a very challenging environment. \r\n This is all the more critical since 2010 has \r\nunfortunately turned out to be the most violent year in \r\nAfghanistan since current international operations \r\nbegan. Brazil deeply regrets the growing numbers of \r\ncivilian casualties, the majority of which continue to be \r\ncaused by the Taliban, Al-Qaida and other extremist \r\ngroups. The efforts and progress made by \r\nA/65/PV.44  \r\n \r\n10-61898 20 \r\n \r\npro-Government forces in reducing civilian casualties \r\nshould be recognized, although more can still be done. \r\n There is no military solution to the conflict in \r\nAfghanistan, as we all know. Brazil supports the \r\nAfghan-led reconciliation and reintegration process, \r\naimed at those who renounce violence, break ties with \r\nterrorist groups and accept the Afghan Constitution. \r\nThe Afghan National Consultative Peace Jirga \r\nexpressed the Afghan people’s clear commitment to \r\nreconciliation and their conditions for it, demanding a \r\njust peace that will not jeopardize the political and \r\nsocial achievements made so far and that guarantees \r\nthe rights of all citizens, including women and \r\nchildren. We welcome the establishment of the High \r\nPeace Council, as well as of the Salaam Support \r\nGroup, recently announced by UNAMA. \r\n The attachment of the Afghan people to a \r\npeaceful and democratic Afghanistan was also evident \r\nduring the recent parliamentary elections. Afghans \r\nonce again defied violence and logistical constraints to \r\nconduct vibrant campaigning and cast their votes. As \r\nwe await the final results of the election, we encourage \r\nthe Independent Electoral Commission and the \r\nElectoral Complaints Commission to continue to carry \r\nout their duties in accordance with Afghan law and free \r\nfrom interference from any side. As soon as the current \r\nelectoral process is concluded, focus on long-term \r\nelectoral reform will be needed, as foreseen in the \r\nKabul process. \r\n The principles of effective partnership recognized \r\nin the Kabul Conference marked a significant \r\nbreakthrough in international cooperation with \r\nAfghanistan. The international community undertook \r\nto significantly increase the aid it channels through the \r\nAfghan budget and to realign off-budget aid with \r\nAfghan national priorities. We look forward to the \r\ntimely implementation of this commitment and \r\nunderline the key role of the United Nations, both in \r\ncoordinating international civilian assistance to \r\nAfghanistan and in strengthening Afghan capacity to \r\ncoordinate aid. \r\n The issue of counter-narcotics remains a serious \r\nconcern in Afghanistan. As it is everywhere else, \r\naddressing this challenge in Afghanistan is a common \r\nand shared responsibility. Countries of production, \r\ntransit and consumption must play their roles. We \r\ncommend the efforts of the Afghan Government to \r\nfight drug production in its territory and trafficking \r\nfrom it, and encourage greater subregional and regional \r\ncooperation in this regard. Such cooperation should be \r\nfounded on respect for Afghan sovereignty and be \r\naimed at strengthening national institutions and \r\nproviding alternative livelihoods. The important role of \r\nagricultural development in this context cannot be \r\noverstated. Yet none of the Afghan efforts will be \r\nenough without corresponding efforts to prevent the \r\ntrafficking of chemical precursors into Afghanistan \r\nand, above all, to reduce demand and consumption \r\nabroad. \r\n Brazil is fully committed to enhancing its \r\ncontribution to peace and prosperity in Afghanistan, \r\nnot only through its action in the Assembly and the \r\nSecurity Council, but also through our bilateral \r\nrelations. My Government has decided to open a \r\nresident embassy in Kabul and, at the request of the \r\nAfghan Government, recently sent a technical mission \r\nto identify areas for cooperation in several fields, \r\nincluding agriculture and mining. We see this as a \r\nstepping stone for closer collaboration in the future. \r\n As an expression of such interest, my delegation \r\nis happy to once again sponsor the draft resolution \r\nfacilitated by the mission of Germany (A/65/L.9), to \r\nwhom we are grateful. We expect that it will enjoy \r\nstrong support in the General Assembly. \r\n Mr. Kleib (Indonesia): Let me begin by \r\nexpressing the wish of Indonesia to see Afghanistan as \r\na peaceful, stable, democratic and prosperous \r\nhomeland for its people, in full accordance with their \r\naspirations. \r\n Much has been achieved by Afghanistan in the \r\npast few years. Both the national authorities and \r\ncivilians are to be commended for their work in \r\nextremely arduous circumstances, and for their \r\nresilience vis-à-vis the ongoing difficulties. \r\n We fully understand that the Government and \r\npeople of Afghanistan are still confronting enormous \r\nchallenges. From security and development to citizen-\r\nresponsive justice and administrative machinery, there \r\nare many bottlenecks. There are also challenges in \r\nproperly equipping and training the national army and \r\npolice, but none that cannot be tackled and solved if \r\nAfghanistan, with the full support of the international \r\ncommunity and the United Nations, remains on the \r\npath of betterment that it has charted for itself. \r\n A/65/PV.44\r\n \r\n21 10-61898 \r\n \r\n The processes of Bonn, Tokyo, the Afghanistan \r\nCompact, Paris and The Hague and the outcomes of the \r\nLondon and Kabul Conferences this year are vital \r\nmilestones. They reflect the will of the international \r\ncommunity as well as that of Afghanistan. The \r\nRegional Economic Cooperation Conference on \r\nAfghanistan taking place this week in Istanbul is also \r\ncritical. \r\n We must all remain true to the commitments \r\nmade and support the Afghan Government so that it too \r\ndelivers on its promises effectively. In that regard, \r\nIndonesia supports and sponsors draft resolution \r\nA/65/L.9, and we thank Germany for its efforts in \r\nfacilitating it. \r\n Indonesia commends the Government of \r\nAfghanistan for the priorities that it has set out, \r\nparticularly through the Afghan-led peace and \r\nreintegration programme, which we hope will be \r\nsustained and nurtured carefully. It is very important \r\nfor Afghanistan, as well as for the international \r\ncommunity, that Afghanistan succeed in its national \r\nreconciliation. \r\n The Indonesian experience with promoting \r\nnational peace also leads us to share the values \r\nreflected in the “Vision for Afghanistan 2020” \r\ndocument, which are articulated in the Afghan National \r\nDevelopment Strategy. Improving economic conditions \r\nremains at the heart of people’s problems in \r\nAfghanistan. Where there has been progress — and \r\nindeed there has been — it needs to be consolidated \r\nand nurtured. \r\n We appreciate the emphasis of the Government \r\non strengthening the agriculture sector. We are also of \r\nthe view that the counter-narcotics effort should \r\ncontinue to be taken as part of an integrated national \r\ndevelopment and peacebuilding exercise. The people \r\nneed to be provided with legal and viable income-\r\nearning opportunities. \r\n With regard to Indonesia’s commitment, my \r\nGovernment is continuing to conduct several training \r\nand capacity-building programmes for Afghan \r\nofficials. These programmes cover the areas of \r\nagriculture, small- and medium-enterprise development, \r\nagro-business technology, public health, waste \r\nmanagement, public administration reform and multi-\r\ndisaster risk management. We will always be keen to \r\nshare Indonesian experience and know-how with \r\nAfghanistan. \r\n Today, my delegation has listened to very \r\nimportant repeated expressions of support by countries \r\nwith regard to helping Afghanistan develop its army, \r\npolice and other essential public services. That is \r\ncritical in order for the Afghan Government to succeed, \r\ninter alia in its goal of having its national security \r\nforces lead and conduct military operations in all \r\nprovinces by the end of 2014. In that context, we are \r\nalso mindful of the need for all forms of international \r\nassistance, including security assistance, to take into \r\naccount the views of the Afghan people and \r\nGovernment. National ownership is indeed critical. \r\n Indonesia remains deeply concerned about \r\nsecurity conditions in Afghanistan. Even now, what \r\nAfghanistan has accomplished is continuously being \r\nundermined by serious challenges to its security and \r\nstability. In that regard, we continue to deplore \r\nincreasing activities by militants and insurgent forces, \r\nincluding attacks on innocent civilians. We also \r\ncondemn the wanton attacks on workers of the aid \r\ncommunity and the United Nations Assistance Mission \r\nin Afghanistan (UNAMA), who sacrifice their lives to \r\nbring relief to common Afghans. Serious challenges \r\ntherefore continue to confront the Government of \r\nAfghanistan. The international community has a major \r\nstake in ensuring that those challenges are met with \r\npersistence and vigour. \r\n I also wish to underline that a cooperative and \r\nstrong partnership between Afghanistan and its \r\nneighbours is crucial in order to tackle the security \r\nchallenge comprehensively and effectively and find \r\nlasting solutions. We therefore welcome the \r\ncommitment of Afghanistan and its immediate \r\nneighbours to enhance collaboration for regional peace, \r\nsecurity and prosperity. \r\n With regard to UNAMA, my delegation believes \r\nthat the Mission remains pertinent in the country. \r\nIndonesia commends UNAMA for its very valuable \r\nwork in arduous circumstances. We support its \r\ncontinued role in supporting recovery and \r\nrehabilitation efforts, as well as its assistance in \r\ncoordinating the global assistance effort. However, we \r\nfeel concern about the obstacles relating to the security \r\nsituation in the country, which continues to hinder the \r\nimplementation of the Mission’s mandate. \r\n To conclude, let me reiterate Indonesia’s full \r\ncommitment to helping Afghanistan succeed. We are \r\nready to help in any way we can so that a nationally \r\nA/65/PV.44  \r\n \r\n10-61898 22 \r\n \r\nreconciled, united, prosperous and democratic \r\nAfghanistan becomes a reality in the very near future. \r\n Mr. Kodama (Japan): Japan welcomes this \r\nopportunity to address the General Assembly on the \r\nsituation in Afghanistan. We are pleased to sponsor the \r\ndraft resolution before us (A/65/L.9). Given the \r\nchallenging situation Afghanistan faces today, it is of \r\nparticular importance to demonstrate the unity of the \r\ninternational community in supporting Afghanistan by \r\nadopting this draft resolution by consensus. \r\nAppreciation is also due to our colleagues in the \r\nGerman delegation, who led the consultations on the \r\ndraft resolution. I also express my sincere gratitude to \r\nthe men and women of Afghanistan and to the \r\ninternational community, who have demonstrated their \r\ndeep commitment to the reconstruction of the country. \r\n The Government of Japan welcomes the \r\npublication by the Independent Electoral Commission \r\nof preliminary results on the lower house election on \r\n18 September. We pay tribute to the Afghan authorities \r\nconcerned, including the Commission, who \r\nparticipated in the election process, and the \r\ninternational community, which supported that process. \r\nWe praise the participation in the election by Afghan \r\ncitizens, despite the security risks, so that they \r\nthemselves could decide their own future. \r\n Japan expects that the reconstruction and \r\ndevelopment of Afghanistan will proceed smoothly \r\nunder the new democratically elected Parliament. As \r\nwe know, the Electoral Complaints Commission is now \r\nconducting its adjudication of complaints and \r\nreviewing the candidates alleged to be involved in \r\nelectoral violations. We highly commend these efforts \r\nand hope that the final results of the election will be \r\nannounced with proper considerations. Also, we would \r\nlike to stress the importance of longer-term election \r\nreform. It is necessary that the international community \r\ncontinues its support for Afghanistan’s efforts in this \r\narea. \r\n At the successful Kabul Conference in July this \r\nyear, important progress was made towards stabilizing \r\nand reconstructing Afghanistan when the Afghan \r\nleadership presented its national priority programme, to \r\nwhich the international community committed to align \r\nits assistance. At the same time, as was reaffirmed at \r\nthe Kabul Conference, it is essential that the Afghan \r\nGovernment undertake the necessary reforms to \r\nstrengthen its financial management capability and to \r\nreduce corruption. The coordination and monitoring of \r\naid through the Joint Coordination and Monitoring \r\nBoard is important for achieving progress in the Kabul \r\nprocess. Together with its partners in the international \r\ncommunity, including the United Nations, Japan \r\ncontinues to assist the Afghan Government to improve \r\nthat capacity. \r\n As Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan stressed \r\nin his address at the General Assembly (see \r\nA/65/PV.14), Japan will provide assistance in such a \r\nway that the people of Afghanistan will be able to \r\nperceive tangible improvements in their lives. Focusing \r\non the three priority areas of security, reintegration and \r\ndevelopment, Japan will provide assistance of up to $5 \r\nbillion to Afghanistan over five years, taking into \r\nconsideration the priority areas of the Afghan \r\nGovernment. \r\n As pointed out in the most recent report of the \r\nSecretary-General on the situation in Afghanistan \r\n(A/65/552), the security situation has continued to \r\ndeteriorate in many parts of the country. Improving \r\nsecurity in Afghanistan is an essential prerequisite for \r\nits reconstruction. In order to strengthen Afghan \r\nsecurity forces so that Afghans can take over \r\nresponsibility for their own security, Japan will \r\ncontinue to provide assistance for the salaries and \r\nequipment of the Afghan National Police. We have also \r\ndecided to provide funding and instructors for the \r\ntraining of Afghan policemen in Turkey. \r\n We appreciate the Afghan Government’s \r\nannouncement of the Afghan Peace and Reintegration \r\nProgramme. In that context, we welcome the \r\nestablishment of the High Peace Council. Japan \r\ndisbursed a $50 million contribution to the Peace and \r\nReintegration Trust Fund. We call for the swift \r\nimplementation of the Afghan Peace and Reintegration \r\nProgramme through the effective use of the Fund. \r\n As for development, Japan believes in the \r\nimportance of showing results through quick-impact \r\nprojects while maintaining a mid- to long-term \r\nperspective. We are providing assistance that is \r\nparticularly focused on the development of human \r\nresources and infrastructure and the development and \r\nrebuilding of the agriculture sector and rural \r\ncommunities. \r\n Stability and reconstruction in Afghanistan \r\ncannot be achieved without the cooperation of those \r\nneighbouring countries that have close ties with \r\n A/65/PV.44\r\n \r\n23 10-61898 \r\n \r\nAfghanistan. Japan actively maintains a dialogue with \r\nAfghanistan’s neighbours. It is our hope that the \r\nstability of Afghanistan will be realized through close \r\ncooperation with a number of regional institutions. In \r\nthat context, we welcome the fourth meeting of the \r\nRegional Economic Cooperation Conference on \r\nAfghanistan, held yesterday in Istanbul. \r\n In conclusion, let me reiterate Japan’s continued \r\nsupport for the nation-building efforts of Afghanistan. \r\nWe hope that Afghanistan’s commitment to realize its \r\nfuture remains unchanged. \r\n Mr. Haroon (Pakistan): The delegation of \r\nPakistan wishes specifically to thank the President for \r\nconvening today’s meeting on Afghanistan. This \r\nmeeting is an annual opportunity for the General \r\nAssembly to review the progress made towards peace, \r\nstability and development in Afghanistan. \r\n Conflict and human tragedy in Afghanistan are \r\nnow three decades old. No other country has suffered \r\nmore than Pakistan from their consequences. It has \r\nimpacted our social and economic fabric, disturbed the \r\npeace and tranquillity of our border regions and given \r\nrise to the common threat of extremism and terrorism. \r\nThe people of Pakistan have shared sorrow and grief \r\nwith our Afghan brothers. \r\n The road to peace and prosperity in Afghanistan \r\ncan only be travelled with the active engagement of the \r\nUnited Nations and its Member States. Today’s annual \r\ndebate in the General Assembly, as well as the \r\nquarterly debates in the Security Council, helps in \r\nnavigating our way on this very difficult road. \r\n This year, the international community’s \r\ncollective journey towards peace and prosperity in \r\nAfghanistan was largely facilitated by the London and \r\nKabul Conferences, which have now generated \r\noptimism that a destination is in sight. The London \r\nConference marked the assumption of responsibilities \r\nby the Afghan Government, and the Kabul Conference \r\narticulated comprehensive benchmarks and timelines \r\nfor the transfer of those responsibilities. \r\n As the Afghan Government assumes greater \r\nresponsibilities in the areas of security, governance and \r\neconomic and social development, it will need this \r\nhouse’s continuing support. The efforts of the Afghan \r\nGovernment and its international partners are required \r\nfor the Kabul process to succeed. Those efforts must be \r\nfocused on priority areas, with appropriate sequencing \r\nand coordination. It is our sincere hope that parties on \r\nboth side of this equation will fulfil their respective \r\nroles and carry out their responsibilities. \r\n To sustain peace and economic development in \r\nAfghanistan, a stable political system based on popular \r\nsupport and the participation of the Afghan people is \r\nessential. In that context, we greatly value the recently \r\nheld Wolesi Jirga elections. These elections showed the \r\ncommitment of the Afghan people to democracy and \r\ndemocratic institutions, despite numerous challenges \r\nand the history behind them. They also demonstrated \r\nthe administrative efficacy and efficiency of the United \r\nNations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), \r\nunder the able leadership of the Special Representative \r\nof the Secretary-General for Afghanistan, Staffan de \r\nMistura. \r\n The Secretary-General’s latest report on \r\nAfghanistan (A/65/552) highlights many positive \r\ndevelopments in Afghanistan. The report also states \r\nthat prospects for peace in Afghanistan continued to be \r\novershadowed by the deteriorating security situation. \r\nThe Secretary-General’s note of caution merits and \r\nrequires the Assembly’s serious attention and \r\nconsideration. \r\n We believe that the vexing question of security, in \r\na society suffering from four decades of war, cannot be \r\naddressed by imposing another war. Military action \r\nalone is not, and will not be, a solution to \r\nAfghanistan’s problems. Yet, currently, some of the \r\npartners engaged — specifically those who are running \r\nthe larger numbers of forces, as illustrated recently in \r\nBob Woodward’s book — are not in favour of anything \r\nless than a full-scale counter-insurgency. That requires \r\nserious consideration. \r\n The Secretary-General has rightly observed the \r\nimportance of peace, reconciliation and reintegration in \r\nthe context of security. This was also at one time part \r\nof the Rydell initiative, which has now been put on the \r\nback burner. But we share the Secretary-General’s view \r\nthat a viable reconciliation process is vital for durable \r\nand long-term peace in Afghanistan. \r\n Pakistan supports an Afghan-led and inclusive \r\nreconciliation process to bring opposition groups into \r\nthe political mainstream. We therefore welcome the \r\nestablishment of the High Peace Council in \r\nAfghanistan and the establishment of the Peace and \r\nReintegration Trust Fund. These are significant steps. It \r\nis our hope that the General Assembly and the Security \r\nA/65/PV.44  \r\n \r\n10-61898 24 \r\n \r\nCouncil will continue to be willing partners of the \r\nAfghan Government in the reconciliation process. \r\n Pakistan has always emphasized the importance \r\nof regional unity to deal with the challenges of security \r\nand development in Afghanistan. In that regard, the \r\nimmediate neighbours of Afghanistan all have a special \r\nrole in its stability. Pakistan is engaged with other \r\ncountries in a number of important regional initiatives \r\non Afghanistan. Those initiatives aim at greater \r\nregional connectivity, with a view to promoting \r\neconomic and commercial cooperation and rooting out \r\nthe menace posed by narcotics, terrorism and \r\nextremism. \r\n Bilaterally, cooperation between Pakistan and \r\nAfghanistan spans the entire spectrum of political, \r\neconomic and cultural relations. There is continuous \r\ndialogue and regular exchange of visits at the highest \r\nlevels. Our two countries have successfully concluded \r\nthe Afghanistan-Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement, \r\nwhich upgraded a previous agreement that was signed \r\nin 1962. Even today, with floods in our country and \r\nmany other problems, we continue to supply reliable \r\nassistance in response to the needs of Afghanistan. \r\n In September this year, President Hamid Karzai \r\nvisited Pakistan. The joint statement issued after the \r\nvisit outlines a detailed course of action to further \r\nstrengthen our partnership in five key areas: security \r\nand counter-terrorism; economic cooperation, transit, \r\ntrade and investment; infrastructure development and \r\nconnectivity; and energy linkages and capacity-\r\nbuilding in education, health and agriculture. \r\n Although Pakistan is engaged in several \r\nreconstruction and developments projects in \r\nAfghanistan — including building hospitals, roads and \r\neducational institutions — regrettably, United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme projects have not used our \r\ntechnocrats or taken advantage of their experience. \r\n We have doubled the number of scholarships \r\noffered to Afghan students for higher education in \r\nPakistan. With new enrolments under the extended \r\nscholarships programme, the number of Afghan \r\nstudents in our colleges and universities is set to reach \r\n6,500 this year. Their fields of study include medicine, \r\nengineering, business, agriculture, information \r\ntechnology and social sciences. We will continue our \r\nmodest contributions to the development of \r\nAfghanistan, despite the financial constraints resulting \r\nfrom the recent floods. \r\n In the area of security, Pakistan’s engagement \r\nwith Afghanistan and its international partners is \r\nrobust. A viable institutional medium of our security \r\nand intelligence cooperation is the Tripartite \r\nCommission, which also includes the United States and \r\nthe International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). \r\nThat cooperation is essential to cement the gains in the \r\ncampaign against terrorism and extremism. May I \r\nremind the Assembly that, after Afghanistan, we \r\nremain the largest sacrificers in this field of conflict. \r\n The interdiction of illegal cross-border \r\nmovements is vital to countering terrorism, drug \r\ntrafficking and commercial smuggling. This is a joint \r\nresponsibility, and one that needs to be addressed more \r\nrigorously. Accordingly, Pakistan has established 1,000 \r\nborder posts. More than 120,000 Pakistani troops are \r\ndeployed on our side of the border with Afghanistan, at \r\na considerable burden to our financial resources. That \r\nis not the case on the other side, where there must be \r\nan increase. We rightfully expect Afghanistan, NATO \r\nand ISAF to reciprocate with active deployment and \r\npatrolling on their side. \r\n Pakistan has housed over 3 million Afghan \r\nrefugees for the past three decades. Despite isolated \r\nspells in voluntary return, we still host over 1 million \r\nAfghan refugees inside Pakistan. Nobody should \r\nunderestimate the enormous social, economic and \r\nsecurity costs borne by us. However, we are committed \r\nto the dignified return of all Afghan refugees. We \r\nwould like to stress the need for strengthening \r\nreintegration programmes for refugees under \r\nAfghanistan’s development strategy. There is a need \r\nfor more diligent and sustained efforts at creating \r\nnecessary pull factors in Afghanistan for the return of \r\nrefugees to their country. We find a slackening in \r\ninterest on the part of the United Nations and the \r\ninternational community to assist in this endeavour — \r\nwhich, with all its necessary resources, it must do. \r\n We greatly value the role of UNAMA. The \r\nUnited Nations has an important role in coordinating a \r\ncomprehensive international effort in Afghanistan. \r\nPakistan would welcome the enhancement of that role \r\nin political and security fields. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to take this \r\nopportunity to thank Ambassador Peter Wittig and his \r\nteam in the German Mission for leading the process of \r\nconsultations on the draft resolution (A/65/L.9) before \r\nus. We believe that the text addresses all the relevant \r\n A/65/PV.44\r\n \r\n25 10-61898 \r\n \r\nissues in a comprehensive and balanced manner. We \r\nare happy to sponsor the draft resolution and urge all \r\nMember States to adopt it by consensus. \r\n Mrs. Miculescu (Romania): In addition to the \r\nstatement made by the representative of Belgium on \r\nbehalf of the European Union, I wish to make some \r\nbrief remarks in my national capacity. \r\n The discussions revolving around the General \r\nAssembly’s draft resolution on the situation in \r\nAfghanistan (A/65/L.9), as well as the Security \r\nCouncil’s quarterly debates on the subject, are \r\nexcellent opportunities to underline the instrumental \r\nrole of the United Nations in that country’s \r\nstabilization and reconstruction process. \r\n Romania is honoured to be a sponsor of the draft \r\nresolution, which has been introduced by Germany. We \r\ncall on the General Assembly to adopt that document \r\nwithout a vote, as a clear reaffirmation of the \r\ninternational community’s commitment to Afghanistan \r\nand a reflection of its hope that it will continue to make \r\nprogress towards achieving a better life for its people. \r\n With the conferences held earlier this year in \r\nLondon and Kabul, the Afghan Government and the \r\ninternational community entered into a new phase of \r\npartnership concerning the way to ensure full \r\nsovereignty and ownership by the Afghan people and \r\nauthorities. In the same vein, we were heartened to \r\nlearn that the Kabul process is on track, as confirmed \r\nduring the recent Security Council debate by the \r\nAfghan Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s Special Representative and head of the \r\nUnited Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, \r\nwhom we congratulate on his endeavours. \r\n At the same time, we are aware of the challenges \r\nfaced by Afghanistan and the international community. \r\nWe fully share the opinion expressed by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his report (A/65/552) that the progress \r\nachieved is fragile and continues to be overshadowed \r\nby the deterioration in the security situation. \r\n But failure is not an option, and if the Kabul \r\nprocess is to advance it is paramount that we all be on \r\nthe same page concerning the priorities set by the \r\nAfghan Government to take over full responsibility for \r\nsecurity and governance where and when \r\ncircumstances permit. Romania is of the opinion that \r\nthe transition process should be driven more by the \r\nfulfilment of the appropriate conditions and less by a \r\ncalendar of fixed deadlines. \r\n Since 2002 my country has been actively engaged \r\nin the international efforts in Afghanistan. Our military \r\ncontribution is — we think — significant and reliable \r\nand its mandate is diverse, ranging from training the \r\nAfghan forces and operational mentoring to the close \r\nprotection of United Nations officials. Currently, there \r\nare over 1,600 Romanian soldiers on Afghan territory, \r\npredicted to reach 1,800 by the end of this year, \r\ndeployed mainly in the southern province of Zabul. \r\n Our presence in Afghanistan means more than \r\ntroops, for we are of the opinion that success cannot be \r\nguaranteed through military efforts alone. There is no \r\nsecurity without good governance and social and \r\neconomic development, and that is why Romania is \r\ndoing its best to assist Afghanistan in various other \r\nways, including offering scholarships to Afghan \r\nnationals and contributing to the European Union \r\nPolice Mission. \r\n Romania has contributed as much as it can to \r\nbringing peace and security to Afghanistan. We have \r\nnot recoiled from danger when our soldiers have made \r\ntheir heroic tribute to liberty, along with so many \r\nAfghans, as well as civilians and soldiers from \r\ncountries around the world. As long as the Romanian \r\npresence is requested by Afghanistan, we shall \r\naccomplish our mission. We are inspired by the \r\nfortitude and courage displayed by the Afghan people \r\nand authorities during the recent parliamentary \r\nelections. I would say that this fortitude and courage \r\nepitomize the strong will of this people, who have had \r\nsuch an intensely challenging history, to build a stable, \r\ndemocratic and prosperous country. \r\n Concluding my remarks, I would like to stress \r\nthat a comprehensive approach to Afghanistan and the \r\nefficient use of resources are now more important than \r\never. The Afghan people and authorities and the \r\nrelevant international organizations and actors need to \r\nwork together, while avoiding unnecessary duplication. \r\nIf the Kabul process is to become a success story, we \r\nneed vision, efficiency, solidarity and, last but not \r\nleast, teamwork. \r\n Ms. Dastidar (India): At the outset, I would like \r\nto express India’s appreciation to the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly for scheduling this discussion on a \r\nsubject of great significance for us, our region and the \r\nworld. I also commend the German delegation for \r\nA/65/PV.44  \r\n \r\n10-61898 26 \r\n \r\ncoordinating intergovernmental negotiations in an \r\nexcellent manner, which has led us to the annual \r\nGeneral Assembly draft resolution on the situation in \r\nAfghanistan, which is traditionally adopted by \r\nconsensus. As we have done for the past several years, \r\nwe are happy to co-sponsor this year’s draft resolution \r\n(A/65/L.9). \r\n The efforts of the international community in \r\nAfghanistan have increasingly focused on security, \r\ndevelopment, governance and regional and \r\ninternational cooperation issues, with the overall \r\nobjective of the Afghan Government eventually \r\nassuming full responsibility for and taking charge of \r\nAfghanistan’s destiny. There have been significant \r\npolitical developments this year, including the London \r\nConference, the Kabul Conference and the \r\nparliamentary elections. \r\n The Kabul Conference marked a new phase in the \r\npartnership of the Afghan Government and the \r\ninternational community — the Kabul process — and a \r\nrenewed commitment to a secure, prosperous and \r\ndemocratic Afghanistan. The Conference demonstrated \r\nthe Afghan Government’s determination to take full \r\nresponsibility for Afghanistan’s own development, \r\nsecurity and governance and the international \r\ncommunity’s willingness to realign international \r\nassistance in accordance with Afghanistan’s priorities \r\nand action plans. \r\n As for India, our great poet, Nobel laureate \r\nRabindranath Tagore, called on us all — Moguls, \r\nChinese, Pathans, Aryans and non-Aryans — to get \r\ntogether and cooperate to give and take in solidarity to \r\nensure universal and regional peace. \r\n The success of the Kabul process largely depends \r\non detailing and implementing the commitments \r\nflowing from the Kabul Conference. Tangible and \r\nsustained improvements on the security front are a \r\nprerequisite for realizing these shared goals. Indeed, \r\nimproved security could create an enabling \r\nenvironment for accelerated progress on development \r\nand governance issues. This is also critical to \r\nexpanding the footprint of the Afghan Government and \r\nto ensuring the greater ownership of these processes by \r\nthe Afghan people. If these processes are to be \r\nenduring, Afghan ownership should go hand in hand \r\nwith Afghan leadership. \r\n The holding of National Assembly elections on \r\n18 September was an important step forward in \r\nstrengthening the democratic framework in \r\nAfghanistan. India appreciates the resoluteness and \r\ndetermination of the Afghan people who participated in \r\nthese elections, notwithstanding threats and \r\nintimidation by the Taliban. I would be remiss if I did \r\nnot place on record our appreciation for the Afghan \r\nGovernment’s lead role and the critical supportive role \r\nplayed by the United Nations and the international \r\ncommunity in organizing the elections. \r\n India’s relationship with Afghanistan is \r\nmultifaceted and characterized by civilizational, trade \r\nand cultural exchanges stretching back to antiquity. \r\nIndia is committed to the unity, integrity and \r\nindependence of Afghanistan, underpinned by \r\ndemocracy and cohesive pluralism and free from \r\nexternal interference. India has contributed to these \r\ngoals through our development partnership, which is \r\nimplemented entirely in accordance with the priorities \r\nof the Afghan Government and people. Our assistance \r\nprogrammes are spread all over Afghanistan and cover \r\nall sectors of development: humanitarian, \r\ninfrastructural, institutional and capacity-building, \r\nsmall-scale quick gestation projects and agriculture. \r\nThe ultimate aim of our assistance, which presently \r\nstands at over $1.3 billion, is to strengthen the capacity \r\nof the Afghan State and people to stand on their own \r\nfeet in the areas of governance and services for the \r\nAfghan people. \r\n Turning to the regional aspect, Afghanistan’s \r\nstability and economic development depend a lot on its \r\nneighbours and the region as a whole. Afghanistan’s \r\ngreatest economic potential perhaps resides in its \r\nimmense potential as a trade, transport and energy hub \r\nand as a bridge linking Central, West and South Asia \r\nand the Gulf. Its prosperity also depends on the \r\nconsumer market of nearly 1.5 billion people in the \r\nSouth Asian subcontinent. \r\n However, in order for this to materialize \r\nAfghanistan’s neighbours need to come together to \r\nforge greater regional cooperation and facilitate trade \r\nand transit. We must expand, rather than hinder trade, \r\ntransit and transport ties, including overland transit and \r\ntrade. That is the best way of bringing the regional \r\ndimension into play in a positive manner. \r\n Growing economic interdependence will also \r\nhelp in weaning disaffected youth away from \r\ninsurgency and militancy and in creating a zone of co-\r\nprosperity in the region. We support the wishes of the \r\n A/65/PV.44\r\n \r\n27 10-61898 \r\n \r\nGovernment of Afghanistan to take the lead in this \r\ndirection. \r\n Peace and reintegration efforts in Afghanistan can \r\nsucceed provided they are fully Afghan-led and \r\nAfghan-owned, carry all sections of Afghanistan’s \r\npopulation together, and abide by the redlines agreed to \r\nat the London Conference and later reaffirmed at the \r\nKabul Conference: giving up violence, cutting off all \r\nlinks with terrorist groups and accepting the \r\ndemocratic and pluralistic values of the Afghan \r\nConstitution, including women’s rights. \r\n Moving forward, it is important that the \r\ninternational community keep in mind the lessons \r\nlearned from past experiences in negotiating with \r\nfundamentalist and extremist organizations and to \r\nensure that any peace process is conducted in an \r\ninclusive and transparent manner. Adequate capacity of \r\nthe Afghan security forces and other Afghan \r\ninstitutions is a sine qua non for protecting \r\nAfghanistan’s sovereignty, plurality and democracy. \r\nThe gains of the past nine years stand to be squandered \r\nif this aspect does not receive the attention it deserves \r\nas the international community ponders its next steps \r\nregarding Afghanistan. \r\n The security and stabilization of Afghanistan will \r\nremain a distant goal unless we are able to isolate and \r\nroot out the syndicate of terrorism, which includes \r\nelements of Al-Qaida, the Taliban, Lashkar e Toiba and \r\nother terrorist and extremist groups operating within \r\nand outside Afghanistan’s borders. The fight against \r\nterrorism cannot be compartmentalized. It is essential \r\nto ensure that support, sustenance and sanctuaries for \r\nterrorist organizations outside Afghanistan are ended \r\nforthwith. \r\n It is worrisome that, despite a reinforced presence \r\nof the International Security Assistance Force, there \r\nhas been a continuing deterioration in the security \r\nenvironment. The most recent report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral (A/65/552) notes that there has been a 69 per \r\ncent increase in security incidents compared to the \r\nsame months in 2009. \r\n In conclusion, in the arduous journey towards \r\nlasting peace, prosperity and stability in Afghanistan, \r\nthe Afghan Government needs a long-term \r\ncommitment from the international community if it is \r\nto successfully confront the challenges that lie ahead \r\nwhile it progressively takes charge of its own destiny. \r\nThe international community must remain steadfast in \r\nits commitment to supporting Afghanistan. The Kabul \r\nConference was a major step in the right direction. We \r\nwelcome these efforts and are fully supportive of them. \r\nWe appreciate the good work done by the United \r\nNations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan. \r\n Mr. Parham (United Kingdom): When the \r\nGeneral Assembly met last year to discuss the situation \r\nin Afghanistan, we identified the importance of driving \r\nforward the process of Afghanization. This meant \r\nworking with the new Afghan Government to build up \r\nits security forces, build constructive relations with its \r\nneighbours, make progress on reconciliation, improve \r\nlocal governance, deliver services for all Afghans, \r\ncontinue to expand the economy and tackle corruption. \r\n The Kabul Conference held earlier this year was a \r\nkey step in Afghanization. It was an unprecedented \r\nevent for Afghanistan, bringing together over 70 \r\ncountries and international organizations, including the \r\nUnited Nations, NATO, the European Union and the \r\nWorld Bank. We commend both the Afghan \r\nGovernment and the United Nations for the success of \r\nthe event, and the personal commitment of both \r\nPresident Karzai and the Secretary-General. The \r\nConference showed the world that Afghanistan is \r\nincreasingly able to run its own affairs. \r\n The Kabul Conference established the Afghan-led \r\nKabul process, which will accelerate Afghanistan’s \r\naccountable governance, reduce dependence on the \r\ninternational community, enhance the capacity of \r\nAfghan security forces and ensure better protection for \r\nthe rights of all its citizens. International donors, \r\nincluding the United Kingdom, have committed \r\nthemselves to realigning their funding behind the \r\nKabul process. This in itself is a significant \r\nachievement for a country as beset by conflict and \r\npoverty as Afghanistan. \r\n The Afghan Government has already made \r\nprogress on its Kabul Conference commitments. We \r\nstrongly welcome the establishment of the High Peace \r\nCouncil, the opening of the Human Rights Support \r\nUnit in the Ministry of Justice, and the agreement of \r\nthe three international members of the anti-corruption \r\nMonitoring and Evaluation Committee. It is important \r\nthat all partners continue to support this process \r\nconstructively. \r\n Although the security situation remains serious, \r\nsteady progress is being made across Afghanistan, and \r\nspecifically in Helmand and Kandahar provinces. \r\nA/65/PV.44  \r\n \r\n10-61898 28 \r\n \r\nAfghan forces and the International Security \r\nAssistance Force have slowed the momentum of the \r\ninsurgency. The areas under the control of the Afghan \r\nGovernment are increasing. However, the situation \r\nremains extremely challenging. We pay homage to \r\nthose in the Afghan National Security Forces and \r\nInternational Security Assistance Force who have lost \r\ntheir lives. \r\n It is essential that partners now work together to \r\nagree on the process of transferring lead responsibility \r\nfor security across Afghanistan to the Afghan security \r\nforces in 2015. This security transition does not mean \r\nthat the partners are looking for an exit from \r\nAfghanistan — far from it. The United Kingdom is \r\nclear that we want to have an enduring relationship \r\nwith Afghanistan. \r\n We regret deeply all civilian casualties caused by \r\ninternational forces. The statistics compiled by the \r\nUnited Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan \r\n(UNAMA) itself show a continued decline in their \r\nnumbers. The United Kingdom will continue to work \r\nto minimize these casualties even further. In contrast, \r\nthe Taliban and their fellow insurgents continue to \r\naccount for an increasing number and proportion of \r\ncivilian deaths — some 86 per cent of those where \r\nattribution can be determined, according to United \r\nNations figures. \r\n Regional cooperation is essential for ensuring \r\nsecurity, stability and prosperity in Afghanistan. We \r\nwelcome the ratification of the Afghanistan-Pakistan \r\nTransit Trade Agreement, which will enable both \r\ncountries to benefit from increased links. We also \r\nwelcome the positive outcomes of the Regional \r\nEconomic Cooperation Conference on Afghanistan, \r\nwhich was held earlier this week in Istanbul to promote \r\nfurther economic cooperation among Afghanistan, \r\nregional neighbours and international partners. \r\n Finally, let me reiterate the United Kingdom’s \r\ncontinued support to the United Nations Mission in \r\nAfghanistan and to Special Representative De Mistura. \r\nUNAMA does vital work in difficult circumstances in \r\npromoting greater aid coherence and effectiveness, in \r\nsupporting the Afghan Government during the recent \r\nelections and in longer-term electoral reform, and in \r\nimportant political outreach. \r\n This General Assembly debate is an important \r\nopportunity to reaffirm our shared long-term \r\ncommitment to Afghanistan and to its stability, security \r\nand prosperity. For its part, the United Kingdom will \r\nsee through its commitment to Afghanistan with rigour \r\nand determination. \r\n Mr. Herczyński (Poland): Let me start by stating \r\nthat Poland aligns itself with the statement made earlier \r\nby the Ambassador of Belgium on behalf of the \r\nEuropean Union. We also wish to thank Germany for \r\nits significant efforts in facilitating the process of \r\nconsultations, which resulted in the draft resolution \r\nbefore us (A/65/L.9). \r\n The annual debate on the situation in Afghanistan \r\nis the best opportunity to underline the prominent role \r\nthe United Nations plays in that country. The \r\ncoordinating role of the United Nations Assistance \r\nMission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) and the activities \r\nundertaken by the Special Representative of the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Staffan de Mistura, enjoy our \r\nfull support and respect. The need to ensure coherence \r\nand facilitate cooperation among the international \r\nactors present in Afghanistan is essential to the \r\nstabilization and development of that country. \r\n A year has passed since we debated in this Hall \r\non the situation in Afghanistan (see A/64/PV.40 and \r\nA/64/PV.41). That year has been marked, on the one \r\nhand, by the second inaugural speech of President \r\nHamid Karzai and, on the other, by recent \r\nparliamentary elections. We have also witnessed \r\nrenewed mutual commitments made by the \r\ninternational community and the Afghan authorities at \r\nthe international conferences in London and Kabul. \r\n Poland has always found it necessary to ensure \r\nthe continuous support of the international community \r\nfor Afghanistan, especially in the field of strengthening \r\nthe capabilities of the Afghan security forces. My \r\ncountry’s involvement in Afghanistan demonstrates our \r\nsense of responsibility for the situation in that country, \r\nwhich still poses numerous threats to international \r\npeace and security. We hope that this year’s decision \r\nby the Government of Poland to increase the number of \r\nPolish troops to 3,000 — 2,600 in Afghanistan and an \r\nadditional 400-troop reserve force, deployable in case \r\nof emergency — will significantly contribute to \r\nbuilding a peaceful and prosperous Afghanistan. \r\n We strongly believe that the key to a peaceful and \r\nsecure Afghanistan lies in the hands of the Afghans \r\nthemselves. The conferences in London and Kabul \r\nformulated a realistic framework for the transfer of \r\nresponsibility for the security situation in the country \r\n A/65/PV.44\r\n \r\n29 10-61898 \r\n \r\nto the Afghan authorities. Poland, being actively \r\nengaged in the Kabul process, takes into consideration \r\nAfghan aspirations, expressed inter alia by President \r\nKarzai, including that the transfer of responsibilities \r\nshould end by 2014. \r\n The success of the Afghan-led process of \r\nreconciliation and reintegration will be one of the \r\nfactors leading to the creation of a stable and secure \r\nAfghanistan. In this regard, we note the debate in the \r\nframework of the Peace Jirga last June and the recent \r\nnominations for the High Peace Council. \r\n Since 2008, Poland has been responsible for the \r\nsecurity of the province of Ghazni. We cooperate with \r\ncentral and local authorities in building conditions \r\nconducive to the transfer of responsibilities. We stand \r\nready to continue our support through training, \r\ncontributions to the capacity-building of Afghan \r\nsecurity forces and development aid. As of today, more \r\nthan 20 per cent of our military personnel present in \r\nAfghanistan have been engaged in training and \r\nmentoring activities. \r\n As the Polish Foreign Minister, His Excellency \r\nRadosław Sikorski, noted in his address during the \r\nhigh-level plenary meeting on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals in September 2010 (see \r\nA/65/PV.6), Afghanistan exemplifies the \r\ninterconnection between security and development. \r\nWithout either, stabilization fails. In 2010, our \r\ndevelopment aid directed to Afghanistan amounted to  \r\n \r\n$12 million. Our plans for 2011 foresee projects in the \r\nfields of strengthening stability, advancing national \r\nreconciliation and improving Afghans’ daily life. \r\n Poland stands ready to share its own experience \r\nin the field of successful political transition. This is \r\nalready the case with regard to local governance and \r\nthe creation of a civil service based on merit. \r\n Let me finally make a few comments on the \r\nrecent parliamentary elections. These elections, \r\nconducted entirely under the responsibility of the \r\nAfghan authorities, constituted an important step \r\nforward towards democracy and normalization. In the \r\nlight of a very difficult security situation, we \r\nparticularly applaud the relatively high turnout, as well \r\nas the active engagement of young and female \r\ncandidates and voters. Now it remains of utmost \r\nimportance to strengthen the electoral framework in \r\norder to provide a transparent and credible basis for \r\nfuture elections. \r\n Afghanistan will need our continuous support in \r\nthe stabilization and reconstruction efforts for some \r\nyears to come. As the transition of responsibilities \r\nproceeds, Poland will stand ready to assist our Afghan \r\npartners in consolidating the progress already achieved \r\non the security front, as well as in strengthening \r\ninstitutions, good governance, democracy and the rule \r\nof law. \r\n  The meeting rose at 1.05 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
