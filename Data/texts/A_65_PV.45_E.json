(Switzerland) \r\n \r\n \r\n  In the absence of the President, Mr. Ndong Mba \r\n(Equatorial Guinea), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair. \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 38 (continued) \r\n \r\nThe situation in Afghanistan \r\n \r\n  Report of the Secretary-General (A/65/552) \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/65/L.9) \r\n \r\n Mr. McLay (New Zealand): New Zealand \r\nwelcomes the opportunity to contribute to this debate \r\nand thanks Germany for facilitating negotiations on \r\ntoday’s draft resolution (A/65/L.9), which we are \r\nhappy to co-sponsor. \r\n It has been nearly 10 years since New Zealand \r\nfirst committed its Special Forces, and then provided a \r\nProvincial Reconstruction Team in Bamyan Province, \r\nto support an Afghanistan that needed strong \r\ninternational support to meet its many challenges. We \r\ndid so acutely aware that as well as almost continuous \r\ninternal war, Afghanistan had, in recent memory, seen \r\nthe 1978 coup, the 1979 Soviet invasion and a \r\nrepressive Taliban regime that brutalized the Afghan \r\npopulation, oppressed women, quashed education, \r\nsupported global terrorism and harboured an Al-Qaida \r\ninsurgency. Those are just a few milestones in a \r\ndifficult history in which, since 1978, 2 million \r\ncivilians have died and many more have fled as \r\nrefugees. \r\n Afghanistan has come a long way since then. \r\nEven in the year since this General Assembly last \r\ndebated this topic there have been significant \r\ndevelopments — parliamentary elections, the London \r\nand Kabul conferences and the Peace Jirga being \r\nnotable examples of events that have contributed to a \r\nmore secure country. \r\n Many aspects of the situation in Afghanistan \r\nmight be addressed today, but in the interests of time I \r\nwill focus on just four: First, New Zealand applauds \r\nthose millions of Afghans who voted in the recent \r\nparliamentary elections, many of them facing \r\nintimidation and defying threats of violence to elect \r\ntheir parliament. We cannot — and do not — hold \r\nAfghanistan to the measure of long-standing, \r\nestablished, mature democracies, but we are \r\ndisappointed that, in some areas, voting could not be \r\nconducted because of security concerns and other \r\ndeliberate obstruction of polling. \r\n On the other hand, while it is very troubling that \r\nalmost a quarter of a million votes cast were \r\ninvalidated by the Independent Electoral Commission, \r\nit is positive that that action resulted from an oversight \r\nsystem that seems to be working and that Afghanistan \r\nwas able to conduct those elections itself, including \r\nkeeping the level of violence well below what many \r\nhad feared. It is also positive that the quota for women \r\nmembers of parliament was exceeded and that, \r\ngenerally, those elected came from diverse \r\nbackgrounds and included a significant number of new \r\ncandidates. All that said, the electoral process had its \r\nshortcomings. We would now call on the Independent \r\nA/65/PV.45  \r\n \r\n10-62052 2 \r\n \r\nElectoral Commission and others involved to maintain \r\nand enhance their rigorous oversight over all such \r\nelections. Those who courageously voted are entitled to \r\nsee that same resolve mirrored in those they elected \r\nand to expect that their new Parliament and all levels \r\nof Government will show they can work on behalf of \r\nand be accountable to all Afghans. That would ensure \r\nthat the will of the people is reflected in the actions of \r\nthe Government and that the central Government and \r\nthe provinces are connected as a cohesive whole. \r\n Secondly, an essential element of capable and \r\ncredible governance is the elimination of corruption. \r\nCorruption is corrosive — it undermines domestic and \r\ninternational confidence, destroys capacity, hinders \r\ngrowth and has sorely tested the capacity of \r\ncontributing nations to maintain or enhance their \r\ncontributions to Afghanistan. We call on the agencies \r\nof central Government and the new Parliament to set a \r\npriority on seeking out and eliminating corruption. \r\n Thirdly, while there have been improvements, we \r\nremain concerned at the security situation. The \r\nparliamentary elections were held during one of \r\nAfghanistan’s most violent periods since the Taliban \r\nwas driven from power — violence that has affected \r\nAfghans, the United Nations Assistance Mission in \r\nAfghanistan (UNAMA), the International Security \r\nAssistance Force (ISAF) and others. Indeed, even with \r\ntwo months still to go, 2010 has already been for ISAF \r\nthe deadliest year of the war. \r\n However, although the security situation remains \r\ntenuous, there have been some positive developments. \r\nThe faster than expected build-up of the Afghan \r\nNational Security Forces and this year’s increase of \r\nnearly 40,000 ISAF troops are providing dividends that \r\nNew Zealand believes must be reinvested in improved \r\ngovernance, social programmes and economic \r\ndevelopment. Those dividends will also help ensure \r\nthat primary responsibility for Afghanistan’s security \r\ncan be transferred to the Afghan National Security \r\nForces, thus allowing international forces to draw \r\ndown and shift the focus of international efforts to \r\nbuilding civilian capacities. \r\n For its part, in Bamyan province, New Zealand \r\nleads the Provincial Reconstruction Team and, in \r\nKabul, our special forces are mentoring the Afghan \r\nCrisis Response Unit. Bamyan is a leading candidate \r\nfor transition, and New Zealand is committed to \r\nensuring that the province can assume responsibility \r\nfor its own security, governance and development. \r\n Fourthly, the security challenges in Afghanistan \r\nare a reminder that fighting alone will not secure \r\nAfghanistan’s future. There must also be a political \r\nsolution in which hard-core insurgency leaders are \r\nfurther isolated, while the majority are integrated into \r\nmainstream society. Accommodation will be required \r\non all sides but should never go so far as to \r\ncompromise hard-fought rights and freedoms, \r\nespecially those of women and minorities. Those who \r\nhave put themselves in harm’s way in Afghanistan have \r\nnot done so to witness, again, officially sanctioned \r\nrestrictions on human rights. \r\n The High Council for Peace will play an \r\nimportant role in any such political settlement, as will \r\nAfghanistan’s neighbours. In January, New Zealand \r\nwas encouraged when Pakistan announced its backing \r\nfor the reconciliation process and, likewise, we \r\nwelcomed the June Afghan-Pakistan declaration on \r\nbilateral cooperation. Pakistan has an interest in a \r\nstable State on its western border, and it is clear that \r\npressure from Pakistan on insurgents could be critical \r\nin encouraging them to lay down their arms. Achieving \r\npeace and reconciliation is the ultimate responsibility \r\nof the Government and people of Afghanistan, but we \r\nalso look forward to positive, closer engagement of \r\nPakistan and Afghanistan’s other near neighbours in \r\nthat process. \r\n The situation in Afghanistan affects many of us in \r\nthis Assembly — whether through involvement with \r\nUNAMA or ISAF, geographic proximity or because of \r\nthe insidious effects of the terrorism that was once \r\nnurtured on Afghan soil. While it is the responsibility \r\nof the Afghan Government to lead efforts to improve \r\ngovernance, stamp out corruption and foster a political \r\nsolution to the conflict, all of us have a supporting role \r\nto play. For its part, New Zealand is committed to \r\nsupporting the Government and people of Afghanistan \r\nin Bamyan province, in Kabul and elsewhere. \r\n New Zealand soldiers were among the first to join \r\nthe campaign against terrorism nearly 10 years ago; \r\nNew Zealanders were among the first to commit to \r\nAfghanistan’s reconstruction; and, today, we continue \r\nto stand with the people of Afghanistan. They have our \r\nsupport as they grow as a nation, and they have our \r\nsupport in securing a better future for all Afghans. \r\n A/65/PV.45\r\n \r\n3 10-62052 \r\n \r\n Mrs. DiCarlo (United States of America): The \r\nUnited States is pleased to join other Member States in \r\nco-sponsoring the General Assembly’s draft resolution \r\n(A/65/L.9) on the situation in Afghanistan. The draft \r\nresolution recognizes the progress made by the Afghan \r\npeople in building a stronger Afghanistan and \r\nacknowledges that much important work remains. \r\n We commend the significant contributions of the \r\nUnited Nations to Afghanistan, noting especially the \r\ncrucial roles played by the Secretary-General, his \r\nSpecial Representative and the staff of the United \r\nNations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) \r\nand other United Nations agencies on the ground. We \r\nalso salute the bravery of the Afghan security forces \r\nand the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), \r\nwho are helping to build a more secure Afghanistan. \r\n Violent attacks by the Taliban, Al-Qaida and \r\nother extremist and criminal groups threaten our \r\ncommon efforts to achieve stability and security. Those \r\ngroups use violence to oppose the Afghan \r\nGovernment’s vision of an Afghanistan that is stable, \r\nsecure, just and prosperous. \r\n We share that vision and echo the draft \r\nresolution’s firm condemnation of such violence, \r\nincluding the 23 October attack on the United Nations \r\ncompound in Herat. We applaud the decisive response \r\nof Afghan security forces and ISAF to that attack, \r\nwhich averted greater bloodshed, and we welcome the \r\nUnited Nations unwavering commitment to \r\nAfghanistan, even in the face of such violence. \r\n The United States joins the Afghan Government \r\nin its efforts to seek a political resolution to the \r\nviolence in Afghanistan through reconciliation, insofar \r\nas insurgents agree to cut ties to Al-Qaida, renounce \r\nviolence against the Afghan State by laying down arms \r\nand agree to abide by the Afghan Constitution, \r\nincluding its provisions guaranteeing the rights of \r\nwomen and all ethnic groups and religions. \r\n We strongly support Afghanistan’s sovereignty \r\nand territorial integrity and are committed to a long-\r\nterm partnership with Afghanistan. In that connection, \r\nwe have more than tripled the number of United States \r\ncivilians working in Afghanistan from 320 in January \r\n2009 to more than 1,000 today. \r\n The efforts of the United States, NATO and other \r\nISAF contributor nations have focused increasingly on \r\nproviding trainers and funding to develop and support \r\nthe Afghan National Security Forces, in line with \r\nPresident Karzai’s goal to have Afghanistan take over \r\nthe lead security responsibility throughout the nation \r\nby 2014. That transition will be governed by careful \r\nassessments of conditions on the ground and the \r\ncapacity of the Afghan forces. \r\n This July more than 60 nations and international \r\norganizations recommitted themselves to building a \r\nstronger Afghanistan at the Kabul Conference. We call \r\non all Member States to redouble their efforts to \r\npromote stability and prosperity for the Afghan people, \r\nalong with peace and security for the region. \r\n We know there are great challenges ahead but the \r\nUnited States and our international partners are \r\nworking closely with the Afghan people to support \r\ntheir efforts to lay the foundation for a better, more \r\nstable and prosperous future. \r\n Mr. Rivard (Canada): Canada is pleased to \r\nco-sponsor the draft resolution before us on the \r\nsituation in Afghanistan (A/65/L.9). Once again this \r\nyear, we warmly welcome the fact that the draft \r\nresolution will be adopted by consensus, thus \r\nreaffirming the collective commitment of all the United \r\nNations Member States to Afghanistan. The draft \r\nresolution expresses our hope and resolve that \r\nAfghanistan, with the support of the international \r\ncommunity, will continue to make progress in \r\nachieving a better life for its people. \r\n Canada remains concerned by the security \r\nsituation in the country, but we note that, in spite of \r\ncontinued challenges, the Afghan National Security \r\nForces are growing in confidence, capacity and \r\ncapability. Canada will continue working with the \r\nAfghan people to help set the conditions for a \r\nsuccessful transition to greater Afghan leadership on \r\nsecurity. We strongly support the Kabul process in \r\ncharting the way forward towards Afghanistan’s \r\nsustainable development, as well as the supporting role \r\nof the Joint Coordination and Monitoring Board. We \r\nlook forward to working with the Government of \r\nAfghanistan and our partners in the international \r\ncommunity in realizing the objectives of the process \r\nand delivering concrete results for the people of \r\nAfghanistan. \r\n Promoting and protecting human rights, including \r\nwomen’s rights, is a core element of Canada’s \r\nengagement in Afghanistan. The good work of \r\ninstitutions such as the Afghan Independent Human \r\nA/65/PV.45  \r\n \r\n10-62052 4 \r\n \r\nRights Commission is an important expression of \r\nAfghanistan’s own commitment to universal human \r\nrights. Canada welcomes the Afghan Government’s \r\nrecent decision to provide the Commission with core \r\nbudget support; we urge it do so in a manner that \r\npreserves the independence of that body. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n The recent parliamentary elections are a step in \r\nthe country’s ongoing democratic transition as the \r\nGovernment of Afghanistan continues to strengthen \r\ngovernance and democratic institutions. We note with \r\nconcern the allegations of electoral irregularities and \r\nfraud, and we look to Afghanistan’s electoral \r\ninstitutions to address them in an open and transparent \r\nmanner. Canada looks forward to the release of final, \r\ncertified results by the Independent Electoral \r\nCommission following the adjudication of complaints \r\nby the Electoral Complaints Commission. In the long \r\nterm, the institutional and professional capacity of \r\nelectoral bodies must continue to develop, the public’s \r\nawareness of their political rights must increase, and \r\nthe needs of key civil society organizations must \r\ncontinue to be supported. Those form the foundations \r\nof the democratic process and improved elections in \r\nthe future. \r\n We recognize that many challenges remain in \r\nAfghanistan’s development, but we are hopeful about \r\nthe progress made to date. Canada and the international \r\ncommunity remain committed to helping Afghans \r\nrebuild Afghanistan into a country that enjoys \r\nprosperity, sound governance, peace and security. \r\n Mr. Koterec (Slovakia): Slovakia aligns itself \r\nwith the statement delivered by the representative of \r\nBelgium on behalf of the European Union. We stand \r\nfirmly behind the Union’s Common Position on the \r\nsituation in Afghanistan. \r\n Slovakia is one of the sponsors of the \r\ncomprehensive draft resolution presented by Germany \r\n(A/65/L.9). The number of sponsors underlines the \r\nscope of the support extended to Afghanistan. I thank \r\nGermany for its fruitful efforts to facilitate a consensus \r\nwithin the international community on the renewed \r\nmessage of encouragement that covers all aspects of \r\nthe country’s achievements and needs, with a principal \r\nfocus on transition. On this occasion, I would like to \r\npoint out some aspects of particular importance to my \r\ncountry. \r\n Afghanistan, a country torn by war for 30 years, \r\nis indisputably a priority for all of us. Slovakia is \r\ncommitted to assisting Afghanistan and contributes to \r\nits stability and security within the International \r\nSecurity Assistance Force (ISAF) and through civilian \r\ndevelopment activities. Together with other countries, \r\nSlovakia will remain engaged as long as needed and \r\nrequested, until Afghanistan is able on its own to \r\nsustain the security that will pave the way for \r\ndevelopment. \r\n As agreed at the Kabul Conference, we consider \r\nthe phased transition of security responsibilities to the \r\nAfghan leadership to be our primary task. This past \r\nspring, Slovakia increased its troop contribution to \r\nISAF to 300, and we are now preparing another \r\nincrease. Yesterday, 3 November, the Slovak \r\nGovernment agreed to a new mandate for our troops. \r\nOur new military contribution will be primarily \r\nfocused on supporting the transition process, including \r\nthe training and stand-up of the Afghan National \r\nSecurity Forces. We will deploy an explosive ordnance \r\ndisposal team for the purpose of protecting the civil \r\npopulation and ISAF forces from mines and \r\nimprovised explosive devices, which cause huge \r\nhuman casualties. At the same time, we are \r\nwithdrawing our national caveats for most of our \r\ntroops. \r\n Apart from our military engagement, we are \r\nexpanding all components of our comprehensive \r\napproach to Afghanistan. It is among three priority \r\nprogramme countries of Slovak official development \r\nassistance, and we plan to review by the end of 2010 \r\nhow our assistance can be better distributed. We are \r\ncurrently establishing a mechanism allowing the \r\ndeployment of civilian personnel in Afghanistan. \r\n I wish to mention a number of projects that the \r\nSlovak Government, together with non-governmental \r\norganizations, universities and the private sector, has \r\nrecently completed or is actively working on. They \r\ninclude reintegrating displaced persons and returnees \r\nin Qarah Bagh; establishing a gastroenterological \r\ncentre in Kabul; educating mothers on how to take care \r\nof healthy or sick children through publicly available \r\nteaching panels and building capacities at Kabul \r\nPolytechnic University; supporting the socio-economic \r\ndevelopment of rural communities in Parwan province \r\nthrough the active involvement of women; expanding \r\nthe urgent-care capacities of the hospital in Lodin; \r\nbuilding a cultural, educational and social centre in \r\n A/65/PV.45\r\n \r\n5 10-62052 \r\n \r\nKunduz province; and educating inhabitants of rural \r\ncommunities on more effective ways of profiting from \r\nagriculture. \r\n We believe that, through targeted projects that are \r\nwell coordinated and aligned with the priorities of the \r\nAfghan Government, we can improve the daily life of \r\nthe Afghan people. We can bring hope and convey \r\nassurances that support is given not only at the highest \r\nbut at all levels. We need the understanding and trust of \r\nthe Afghans to fulfil our common goal of establishing a \r\nsecure, stable and prosperous country. \r\n In conclusion, let me express my hope that the \r\ninternational community, united behind the United \r\nNations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, remains \r\ncommitted to assisting the Afghan Government in the \r\nquest for lasting peace and security and to achieving \r\nfull Afghan ownership of the reconstruction and \r\ndevelopment of Afghanistan. \r\n Mr. Wang Min (China) (spoke in Chinese): \r\nChina associates itself with the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of Kazakhstan on behalf of the Shanghai \r\nCooperation Organization and welcomes the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report on the situation in Afghanistan \r\n(A/65/552). \r\n In recent years, thanks to the leadership of the \r\nAfghan Government, the help of the international \r\ncommunity and the untiring efforts of the Afghans \r\nthemselves, reconstruction in the country has made \r\nheadway. \r\n The success of the International Conference on \r\nAfghanistan in Kabul this July marked an important \r\nstep in the Kabul process and pointed the \r\nreconstruction process in the right direction. The \r\nsmooth and successful holding of the parliamentary \r\nelections on 18 September was a major political event \r\nthat demonstrated the notable progress towards the \r\nestablishment of an Afghanistan run by the Afghans \r\nthemselves. \r\n At the same time, we should not lose sight of the \r\nfact that the Afghan reconstruction process is still \r\nfraught with many challenges that call for the \r\ncontinued efforts of the Afghan Government and \r\npeople and the sustained attention and support of the \r\ninternational community. \r\n Every step forward in Afghanistan is the result of \r\nthe serious commitment and vigorous support of the \r\ninternational community. We appreciate what has been \r\ndone by the United Nations in promoting Afghanistan’s \r\nreconstruction and support the United Nations \r\ncoordinating role. I should like to highlight the \r\nfollowing five points in that regard. \r\n First, in order to achieve peace, stability and \r\ndevelopment, the Government and people of \r\nAfghanistan need to be in the driver’s seat with a view \r\nto full Afghan ownership. We support the Afghan \r\nGovernment’s efforts in capacity-building, with a view \r\nto exercising its full and effective control over the \r\nentire territory. \r\n Secondly, in order to advance the Kabul process \r\nand further progress, balanced efforts should be made \r\nin economic development, security, stability, national \r\nreconciliation, good governance, the rule of law and \r\nthe fight against narcotics. \r\n Thirdly, the international community should \r\ncontinue to help the Government of Afghanistan to \r\nenhance its capacity to ensure national security and \r\nfacilitate the building of its military and police forces. \r\nChina is very concerned about the deterioration of the \r\nsecurity situation and increased security incidents that \r\nhave resulted in a significant number of civilian \r\ncasualties. The transfer of responsibility for security \r\nshould be preceded by the securing of the country’s \r\nstability. \r\n Fourthly, on the basis of respect for Afghanistan’s \r\nindependence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, the \r\ninternational community should honour its \r\ncommitment to assisting that country in the spirit of \r\nconsensus reflected in the communiqué of the Kabul \r\nConference. The international community should align \r\nits assistance with the Afghan National Development \r\nStrategy and the priority areas identified by the \r\nAfghans. \r\n Fifthly, the narcotics problem is a malignant \r\ntumour endangering the country’s security and \r\nstability, and is spreading to Afghanistan’s neighbours. \r\nThe international community should pay more \r\nattention to Afghanistan’s fight against narcotics and \r\nhelp with the implementation of the national counter-\r\nnarcotics strategy. \r\n Afghanistan is a friendly neighbour of China. We \r\nrespect Afghanistan’s independence, sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity. We closely follow developments in \r\nthe country and actively support, facilitate and engage \r\nin its reconstruction. From 2002 to 2009, China \r\nA/65/PV.45  \r\n \r\n10-62052 6 \r\n \r\nprovided more than ¥900 million in grant assistance, \r\ncancelled $19.5 million in mature debts, and was \r\ninvolved in seven construction projects. Since January \r\nthis year, China has provided an additional \r\n¥160 million in grant assistance in such fields as \r\ninfrastructure, health care, sanitation and education. \r\nThe two countries exchanged letters of zero-tariff \r\ntreatment for certain Afghan exports to China, covering \r\nmore than 4,000 items. In addition, China will continue \r\nto step up the training of Afghan professionals, \r\nimplement more projects, and provide assistance to \r\nthose areas in the country which most urgently require \r\nit. \r\n We believe that, with the efforts by the Afghan \r\nGovernment and people and the help of the \r\ninternational community, Afghanistan will emerge from \r\nthe shadow of war very soon, embark on the path to \r\nsustainable development and contribute to regional \r\npeace and prosperity. \r\n Mr. Šćepanović (Montenegro): Since this is the \r\nfirst time my delegation is taking the floor, allow me to \r\ncongratulate Mr. Deiss on his assumption of the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth \r\nsession. We are confident that, under his able \r\nleadership, this session will come to a successful \r\nconclusion and make a meaningful contribution to the \r\nachievement of our common goals. \r\n Montenegro fully aligns itself with the statement \r\nmade by the representative of Belgium on behalf of the \r\nEuropean Union. In addition, allow me to make some \r\nadditional points in my national capacity. \r\n Facing up to the modern world involves many \r\ngreat challenges, and even small countries like \r\nMontenegro have their share of responsibility. It \r\nremains crucial, particularly with respect to the \r\nchallenges posed by the situation in Afghanistan, for \r\nthe international community to stay actively engaged in \r\nthe recovery phase of that country, as it will have \r\nprofound impact on its future. It is important to stress \r\nthat we have so far been able to take this process in the \r\nright direction, but at the same time we have to be \r\nprepared for the long and hard road ahead. \r\n Montenegro is certainly committed to seeking \r\nprogress towards the achievement of the ultimate goal, \r\nshared by Afghanistan and the international \r\ncommunity, of establishing a stable and secure \r\nAfghanistan. In this context, allow me to highlight the \r\nways in which Montenegro is contributing to the \r\noverall process of rebuilding the country and moving \r\nforward on the development of its democratic society. \r\n Soon after Montenegro regained its independence \r\nin 2006, my country donated light weapons and \r\nammunition to Afghanistan. In addition, since March \r\nthis year, a Montenegrin infantry and medical team has \r\nbeen stationed in northern Afghanistan, within a \r\nHungarian contingent and under German command, as \r\npart of the International Security Assistance Force \r\nmission. We would like to take this opportunity to \r\nthank these two countries, as well as our other partners, \r\nfor the excellent cooperation and support they \r\ncontinuously provide us. \r\n In the total number of international forces \r\nengaged in Afghanistan, the contribution of \r\nMontenegro is symbolic. However, it constitutes 2 per \r\ncent of our armed forces, which themselves are going \r\nthrough a dynamic process of reform. Moreover, \r\ntogether with Croatia, my country has launched an \r\ninitiative to explore the possibility of training a joint \r\nteam of instructors that would provide assistance to the \r\nAfghan Security Forces. This initiative is open for all \r\nother Balkan countries to join. \r\n Montenegro also took part in the London \r\nConference in January and the Kabul Conference in \r\nJuly, thus showing its dedication to participating \r\nactively in seeking a sustainable solution for the \r\nsuccessful conclusion of the transition process. We \r\nbelieve that reconciliation and the strengthening of \r\ntrust among different ethnic and political structures in \r\nAfghanistan are of crucial importance to the credibility \r\nof this process. It is also of utmost importance that all \r\ncountries, big and small, be willing and ready to join \r\nthese efforts and provide assistance within their \r\ncapacities, so that the ongoing process can be \r\nsuccessfully and fully achieved. \r\n The draft resolution on the situation in \r\nAfghanistan (A/65/L.9) is yet another step aimed at \r\nsending a clear signal of support to the efforts of the \r\ninternational community to assist the Afghan people in \r\ndefence of their country and in building a better, more \r\nprosperous and safer Afghanistan based on the rule of \r\nlaw. In co-sponsoring the draft resolution, Montenegro \r\njoined a large cross-regional group of countries and \r\nonce again showed its full support and commitment to \r\nthe Afghan people and the situation in Afghanistan. In \r\nthat light, we expect to see the draft resolution adopted \r\nby consensus as a sign of the unity and solidarity of the \r\n A/65/PV.45\r\n \r\n7 10-62052 \r\n \r\nUnited Nations and the whole international community \r\nwith Afghanistan. \r\n Mr. Apakan (Turkey): Let me begin by \r\nexpressing our appreciation for and satisfaction with \r\nthe draft resolution before us (A/65/L.9). We would \r\nlike to thank the Permanent Mission of Germany for its \r\nefforts as facilitator to find common ground and to \r\nreach a consensus. We are pleased to be co-sponsoring \r\nthe draft resolution, which is a balanced document \r\nreflecting achievements so far, as well as the remaining \r\nchallenges in Afghanistan. \r\n The situation in Afghanistan continues to be \r\nserious. Constant, intensive and coordinated efforts are \r\nrequired to maintain the initiative. We are glad to see \r\nthat the Government of Afghanistan, with the \r\nassistance of the international community, has been \r\ndoing just that. \r\n Turkey commends the Government of \r\nAfghanistan for holding the second parliamentary \r\nelections since 2001 on 18 September, as planned, in \r\nspite of the difficult security conditions, and the \r\nAfghan people for their interest and participation in the \r\nelections. We condemn all attacks and attempts to \r\nundermine the election process with violence and offer \r\nour condolences for those who lost their lives. \r\n We are very appreciative of the efforts of the \r\nUnited Nations in Afghanistan, in particular the \r\nassistance provided during the elections, and are \r\nheartened that the United Nations is determined to do \r\nits utmost, even in the face of attacks. Turkey \r\ncondemns the terrorist attack on the United Nations \r\ncompound in Herat on 23 October in the strongest \r\nterms. Such deliberate terrorist attacks should not deter \r\nus; they should only strengthen our determination to \r\nassist the Afghan people in establishing lasting peace \r\nand stability. We salute the courage of the United \r\nNations and Afghan staff and assure them of our \r\ncontinued support and solidarity. \r\n The elections were another step forward in the \r\nconsolidation of Afghanistan’s democratic institutions \r\nand national unity. The holding of the elections was \r\nmade possible by the determined efforts of the Afghan \r\nauthorities and the support of the international \r\ncommunity to that Afghan-owned and Afghan-led \r\nprocess. After the election process has been completed \r\nin full, the Afghan Government and the international \r\ncommunity will be able to focus in greater depth on \r\nAfghanization. \r\n Ensuring the durability of the achievements made \r\nso far in Afghanistan is directly linked to cementing \r\nAfghan ownership, as well as empowering Afghans. \r\nThe Kabul Conference was a turning point in that \r\nregard. The Afghan Government and the international \r\ncommunity should now focus on the implementation of \r\nthe Kabul process, the most important message of \r\nwhich is Afghan ownership. In that regard, we are glad \r\nto see that the Afghan Government is showing strong \r\npolitical will to take that process forward. On the other \r\nhand, the international community should be steadfast \r\nin its commitments and assist the Afghan Government \r\nin a manner that conforms to the conditions, priorities \r\nand requirements on the ground. \r\n Lasting peace and stability in Afghanistan \r\nultimately require political reconciliation. That process \r\nshould seek to embrace all segments of society, give \r\nthem fair opportunities to serve the Afghan cause and \r\nenable their representation. Afghanistan can overcome \r\nthe hurdles it has encountered for so long only through \r\nenhanced unity and solidarity at the national level. \r\n Turkey has maintained the most comprehensive \r\nassistance programme in its history with various \r\ncivilian and military capabilities in support of \r\nAfghanistan’s historic process of transformation. What \r\nis vital in Afghanistan is to win over the hearts and \r\nminds of the Afghan people. Comprehensive civilian \r\nefforts are essential in that regard. Accordingly, our \r\nefforts are directed primarily at helping to improve the \r\nquality of life of the Afghans. In that regard, we put \r\nparticular emphasis on education, health and \r\nagricultural development, as well as capacity-building. \r\n Turkey is also particularly active in support of \r\nregional cooperation. To that effect, we strive to \r\nreinvigorate the cooperation between Afghanistan and \r\nits neighbours, as well as across the region, with a view \r\nto encouraging the countries involved to jointly address \r\nthe challenges that affect them as a whole. We firmly \r\nbelieve that an essential pillar of ensuring the \r\nirreversibility of the process under way in Afghanistan \r\nis directly linked to ensuring better, result-oriented \r\ncooperation at the regional level. \r\n In that vein, before the year ends we will have \r\nhosted no less than 20 major international meetings in \r\nsupport of regional and international cooperation, with \r\na particular focus on Afghanistan. Those include three \r\nsummit-level and several ministerial meetings. We very \r\nrecently hosted the fourth Regional Economic \r\nA/65/PV.45  \r\n \r\n10-62052 8 \r\n \r\nCooperation Conference on Afghanistan in Istanbul, \r\nand held the Academic Platform for Afghanistan \r\nmeeting with the participation of academics from \r\ncountries represented at the Conference. \r\n Turkey is confident that Afghanistan’s stability \r\nand social and political harmony will grow stronger in \r\nthe future. The Kabul Conference was an important \r\nmilestone towards the attainment of those goals. The \r\nimplementation of the process requires determined \r\nleadership on the part of the Afghan authorities and the \r\nclose coordination of Afghanistan’s partners. For its \r\npart, Turkey is ready to do its utmost. \r\n Mr. Čekuolis (Lithuania): Lithuania aligns itself \r\nwith the statement made by the representative of \r\nBelgium on behalf of the European Union. We would \r\nalso like to express our appreciation for the successful \r\nfacilitation efforts of Germany and are proud to join \r\nthe impressive list of sponsors. I would like to thank \r\nthe President for convening this meeting because this \r\ndebate gives us a good opportunity to renew the \r\ninternational community’s message of solidarity and \r\nsupport for the Afghan people on their path towards \r\npeace, security and democracy. \r\n Lithuania welcomed the decision of the Security \r\nCouncil in October to extend the authorization of the \r\nInternational Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in \r\nAfghanistan for one year (see S/PV.6395). In our view, \r\nthe presence of the international community in \r\nAfghanistan, and of ISAF in particular, is essential to \r\nsupporting the efforts of the Afghan people in building \r\na stable and secure Afghanistan. The implementation of \r\ndevelopment projects and administrative capacity-\r\nbuilding are impossible without the stabilization of the \r\nsecurity situation in that country. \r\n Lithuania welcomes the decisions of the London \r\nand Kabul Conferences, which set a clear agenda and \r\nagreed criteria for the transition to full responsibility of \r\nthe Afghan people. The political will of the Afghan \r\nPresident and Government to meet the commitments \r\nundertaken on reforming the country is highly \r\nimportant. \r\n The recent parliamentary elections showed the \r\npotential of the Government to take responsibility for \r\nthe administration of the country. In the context of that \r\ntransition, the United Nations and its agencies must \r\ncontinue to offer all necessary support and assistance, \r\nwhich will be even more important as the process of \r\ntransition to Afghan-led security will start next year. \r\n An assessment of the situation shows the \r\nenormous scope of the tasks ahead. However, dealing \r\nadequately with the tasks of improving overall security, \r\nimplementing development projects tailored to local \r\nneeds, building local capabilities, improving \r\ngovernance and administration, and fighting corruption \r\ndemand that continuous and balanced attention be \r\ngiven to all provinces; if it is not, our gains in some \r\nareas risk being undercut by a lack of progress, or even \r\nregression, in others. \r\n We have seen this ourselves in Ghor province, \r\nwhere we have been leading a provincial \r\nreconstruction team since 2005. The lack of attention \r\nto the province’s real needs on the part of the central \r\nGovernment creates tensions within local society and \r\nbetween local government and local people. We \r\ntherefore would like to see the United Nations \r\nAssistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) more \r\nvigorously encourage the Afghan Government not only \r\nto concentrate on national programmes but to be more \r\nactive in the regions, leaving no forgotten pockets on \r\nthe map of that large country. \r\n Through its 23 field offices, UNAMA has proven \r\nto be an invaluable support to the Afghan Government \r\nin its efforts to improve security, governance and \r\neconomic development across the country. We believe \r\nthat manning the field offices with additional numbers \r\nof dedicated expert advisers would be strongly \r\nwelcomed by local authorities and representatives of \r\nthe international community on the ground. An \r\nenhanced UNAMA presence in the provinces would \r\nundoubtedly benefit the Afghan people and help the \r\nauthorities to better prepare for taking over full \r\nresponsibility for the country. \r\n Let me also stress the need to combine and \r\ncoordinate the work undertaken by various countries \r\nand international organizations in Afghanistan. Closer \r\ncooperation among the United Nations, the \r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \r\n(OSCE) and other international organizations, as well \r\nas regional players, including Afghanistan’s \r\nneighbours, would benefit the people of Afghanistan. \r\nBuilding regional and global consensus on the \r\ntransformation of Afghanistan should be a key \r\nguideline for further United Nations action. \r\n For Lithuania, which will assume OSCE \r\nchairmanship in 2011, the regional dimension is highly \r\npertinent. We are currently considering how we can \r\n A/65/PV.45\r\n \r\n9 10-62052 \r\n \r\nenhance the OCSE role in Central Asia, including joint \r\nOSCE projects and initiatives on border management \r\nand travel document security in the region bordering \r\nAfghanistan. \r\n Development cooperation is a powerful \r\ninstrument in helping to build administrative capacities \r\nand in developing local economies and civil society. \r\nWe believe that there is room to further improve \r\ncoordination and cooperation among donor countries. \r\nFor our part, we are happy to be jointly working on \r\ndevelopment cooperation projects in Ghor province \r\nwith our partners from Japan, the United States, Greece \r\nand other countries. \r\n In this context, let me remind the Assembly that \r\nLithuania will hold a development cooperation \r\nministerial conference on the theme “The road to \r\nsuccessful transition in Afghanistan, province by \r\nprovince”, which will take place on 12 November in \r\nVilnius, the capital of Lithuania. The conference will \r\nfocus on development cooperation potential as an \r\ninstrument for the implementation of the transition \r\nprocess. We hope that the conference will help to \r\ncontribute to the success of implementing the goals and \r\nobjectives of Afghanistan’s transition to peaceful, \r\nsecure and democratic development. \r\n Mr. Ashour (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in \r\nArabic): We are gathered here once again to consider \r\nthe situation in Afghanistan against the backdrop of \r\nongoing suffering and insecurity in that country and \r\ncontinued unjustified murders of civilians by the \r\nTaliban and the international forces. Innocent civilians, \r\nunfortunately, are still, as always, the victims. We \r\ncondemn the tragic and repeated incidents that have \r\ntargeted civilians in Afghanistan, including women and \r\nchildren. Despite successive calls for the necessary \r\nmeasures to be taken to end them, these very troubling \r\nincidents persist. We therefore call on the international \r\nforces to act swiftly to prevent these tragic incidents \r\nand their consequences from recurring. Independent, \r\nfair and impartial inquiries must be carried out in order \r\nto charge those responsible and deny them impunity. \r\n We are deeply concerned by the failure of the \r\ninternational forces to achieve peace in Afghanistan, \r\ngiven that the strategies are focused on and aimed at \r\nachieving a military victory there, regardless of \r\ncivilian losses. Many Afghans are driven into the ranks \r\nof the rebels in reaction to the murder of civilians and \r\nbecause of their feelings of social and political \r\nmarginalization. \r\n My delegation reiterates its belief that a solution \r\nto the situation lies not in enhancing military strength, \r\nbut in a comprehensive solution to the situation in \r\nAfghanistan on the basis of comprehensive national \r\nreconciliation aimed at achieving the overall \r\ndevelopment of the country. In this respect, we support \r\ncalls by some political leaders in Afghanistan for the \r\nconclusion of a ceasefire with the Taliban as a step \r\ntowards achieving stability in the country. It goes \r\nwithout saying that if the money that has been and is \r\nstill being spent on the war in Afghanistan had been \r\nspent on development projects, peace and prosperity \r\nwould already have been achieved and Afghanistan \r\nwould not be what it is today. \r\n The international community is focused on \r\nhelping the Afghan people to build a democratic, stable \r\nand prosperous State. The war is not being waged \r\nagainst the Taliban or other parties, particularly since \r\nan approach based on the use of force cannot, by its \r\nvery nature, ensure security and stability if it is not \r\nmatched by efforts to establish a dialogue aimed at \r\nachieving national reconciliation among all sectors of \r\nthe Afghan population, repudiating violence, fighting \r\ncorruption and combating drug trafficking. \r\n That is why the international community must \r\nsupport programmes and activities that allow \r\nAfghanistan to fulfil all its responsibilities as a \r\nsovereign country capable of providing security and \r\noffering a life of dignity to all its citizens, as well as \r\ncreating the conditions necessary for the withdrawal of \r\nforeign forces. That last condition is a sine qua non for \r\nthe achievement of national reconciliation. \r\n In addition, the role and mandate of the \r\nInternational Security Assistance Force must be \r\nurgently strengthened and provided with the necessary \r\nresources. Support for a larger presence of and more \r\nefficient contribution by United Nations agencies must \r\nbe provided, in particular in terms of development and \r\nreconstruction programmes in Afghanistan, not to \r\nmention State-building. We hope that the international \r\ncommunity will continue to support and assist \r\nAfghanistan more effectively with a view to ensuring \r\nfull stability and sustainable development. \r\n Creating an environment favourable to the \r\nwithdrawal of international forces from Afghanistan is \r\na basic precondition for achieving national \r\nA/65/PV.45  \r\n \r\n10-62052 10 \r\n \r\nreconciliation, which cannot be achieved while the \r\nforeign occupation continues. We are therefore \r\nreassured by the report of the Secretary-General \r\n(A/65/552), which takes note of the political progress \r\nrepresented by the recent convening of the Kabul \r\nConference, which sought primarily to promote the \r\ncapacity of Afghans to take a leading role in and \r\nresponsibility for their own future as soon as possible. \r\n In conclusion, we hope that due regard will be \r\ngiven to the Secretary-General’s evaluation of progress \r\nmade in the implementation of the mandate of the \r\nUnited Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, and \r\nof the Mission’s own priorities, which it submitted in a \r\nreport to be issued by the Secretary-General to the \r\nSecurity Council in December. We hope that that report \r\nwill take account of progress made in all areas with a \r\nview to helping Afghanistan finally escape the vicious \r\ncycle of violence that has persisted for more than 30 \r\nyears. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): We \r\nhave heard the last speaker in the debate on this item. \r\n The Assembly will now take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/65/L.9. \r\n I give the floor to the representative of the \r\nSecretariat to announce additional sponsors. \r\n Mr. Zhang Saijin (Department for General \r\nAssembly and Conference Management): I would like \r\nto inform the Assembly that, since the issuance of draft \r\nresolution A/65/L.9, the following countries have \r\nbecome sponsors: Albania, Argentina, Belarus, \r\nCambodia, China, Croatia, Cyprus, Egypt, El Salvador, \r\nEritrea, Fiji, France, Georgia, Guatemala, Haiti, \r\nHungary, Indonesia, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, \r\nKuwait, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Malaysia, Mali, \r\nMauritius, the Federated States of Micronesia, Monaco, \r\nMorocco, Oman, Palau, the Philippines, Qatar, the \r\nRepublic of Korea, the Russian Federation, Saint \r\nLucia, San Marino, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Sweden, \r\nThailand, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, \r\nTogo, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, Viet Nam \r\nand Yemen. \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): A \r\nsimilar resolution on this item was adopted without a \r\nvote at the previous session (resolution 64/11). May I \r\ntake it that the Assembly decides to adopt draft \r\nresolution A/65/L.9? \r\n Draft resolution A/65/L.9 was adopted (resolution \r\n65/8). \r\n The Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nGeneral Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 38. \r\n  The meeting rose at 4.10 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\n"
