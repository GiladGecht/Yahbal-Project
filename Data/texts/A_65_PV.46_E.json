(Switzerland) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda item 87 \r\n \r\nReport of the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\n \r\n  Note by the Secretary-General transmitting  \r\nthe report of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (A/65/140) \r\n \r\n  Draft resolution (A/65/L.10) \r\n \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now invite \r\nMr. Yukiya Amano, Director General of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, to introduce the \r\nreport of the Agency for the year 2009. \r\n Mr. Amano (International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency): This is my first report to the General \r\nAssembly as Director General of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency. A constant theme of my first \r\nyear in office has been the pursuit of objectives related \r\nto the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and the \r\npromotion of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy in a \r\nbalanced manner. I am trying to change the widespread \r\nperception of the Agency as simply the world’s \r\n“nuclear watchdog”, because that term does not do \r\njustice to our extensive activities in other areas, \r\nespecially in nuclear energy, nuclear science and \r\napplications, and technical cooperation. \r\n Today, I will review the highlights of the \r\nAgency’s work in the past year and share some \r\nthoughts on current issues. I will start with nuclear \r\nenergy. In March, the International Conference on \r\nAccess to Civil Nuclear Energy, which took place in \r\nParis, illustrated the growing international interest in \r\nnuclear power as a clean and stable source of energy \r\nthat can help to mitigate the impact of climate change. \r\nI expressed my conviction that access to nuclear power \r\nshould not be limited to developed countries but should \r\nbe available to developing countries as well. \r\n Some 60 countries are considering introducing \r\nnuclear energy. We expect up to 25 new countries to \r\nbring their first nuclear power plants on line by 2030. \r\nMany of the countries that already have nuclear power \r\nare planning or building new reactors or extending the \r\noperational life of existing reactors. While it is up to \r\nthe Member State to decide whether or not to opt for \r\nnuclear power, the Agency has a key role to play in \r\nensuring that the expansion in nuclear power takes \r\nplace in an efficient, responsible and sustainable \r\nmanner. When countries express an interest in \r\nintroducing nuclear power, we offer advice in many \r\nareas, including on how to put the appropriate legal \r\nand regulatory framework into place and how to ensure \r\nthe highest standards of safety and security, without \r\nincreasing proliferation risks. \r\n The Agency continues to assist countries that are \r\nexpanding existing nuclear power programmes. It is in \r\nthose countries that the most new nuclear power plants \r\nwill be built and where the lifetime of existing plants is \r\nbeing extended. Our work with those countries is \r\nfocused on areas such as operational safety and \r\nsecurity, improving nuclear waste disposal and \r\ndecommissioning old reactors. \r\nA/65/PV.46  \r\n \r\n10-62124 2 \r\n \r\n The Agency signed an agreement with the \r\nRussian Federation in March to establish a low-\r\nenriched uranium bank in Angarsk, which is intended \r\nto provide assurance of supply for nuclear power \r\nplants. Some IAEA member States have proposed other \r\nmechanisms for assurance of supply. \r\n In view of the increasing interest of many \r\ncountries in introducing nuclear power, I would like to \r\nencourage international lending institutions to consider \r\nbeing more open in their approach to funding nuclear \r\npower projects. I also believe that the benefits of \r\nnuclear power in mitigating the negative effects of \r\nclimate change deserve wider recognition in the \r\nrelevant international forums. \r\n I would like to touch upon nuclear applications \r\nnext. The work of the IAEA in areas such as health \r\ncare and nutrition, food security, the environment and \r\nwater resource management is extremely important for \r\nmany member States. I made cancer in developing \r\ncountries a high priority for my first year in office. \r\nSome 665 people in developing countries die of cancer \r\nevery hour — nearly three times as many as in \r\ndeveloped countries. Around 70 per cent of cancers in \r\ndeveloping countries are diagnosed too late for life-\r\nsaving treatment. In many low-income countries, there \r\nis not a single radiation therapy machine. Since 1980, \r\nthe IAEA has delivered over $220 million worth of \r\ncancer-related assistance to developing countries. Our \r\nspecial focus on cancer this year has already started to \r\nbear fruit. I believe we have succeeded in raising \r\nawareness of the problem of cancer in developing \r\ncountries to a higher political level. \r\n Our cooperation with the World Health \r\nOrganization is going from strength to strength. \r\nPledges and donations to our Programme of Action for \r\nCancer Therapy are running at record levels. We are \r\nalso seeing a very strong commitment by developing \r\ncountries to our activities, which has led to an \r\nimprovement in the quality of some of our cancer-\r\nrelated technical cooperation projects. \r\n The availability of water for sustainable \r\ndevelopment is also a growing concern. As member \r\nStates make increased efforts to meet that challenge, \r\nthey need better scientific knowledge of their water \r\nresources. Nuclear technology is also very useful in \r\nthat area. We have initiated a new IAЕA Water \r\nAvailability Enhancement Project, which is aimed at \r\nhelping member States acquire such knowledge. \r\n Turning now to nuclear safety and security, we \r\nhave seen a very significant improvement in the safety \r\nperformance of the nuclear industry since the \r\nChernobyl disaster nearly 25 years ago. That reflects \r\nfactors that include improved design, better operating \r\nprocedures, a strengthened and more effective \r\nregulatory environment and the emergence of a strong \r\nsafety culture. While it is the responsibility of States to \r\nensure nuclear safety, the IAEA promotes an integrated \r\napproach to safety, focusing on management systems, \r\neffective leadership and safety culture. The Agency \r\nalso promotes international cooperation, providing \r\nreview services to member States and supporting \r\nknowledge networks and training. While recognizing \r\nthat nuclear security is the responsibility of States, the \r\nAgency continues to assist States in developing a \r\nsustainable nuclear security capacity. \r\n In April 2010, the Nuclear Security Summit in \r\nWashington, D.C., attended by leaders from \r\n47 countries, reaffirmed the essential role of the \r\nAgency as part of the international nuclear security \r\nframework. It also pledged to ensure that the Agency \r\nhas the resources to assist States in strengthening \r\nnuclear security. Adherence to the relevant \r\ninternational legal instruments on nuclear security has \r\ngradually increased. However, while it has been five \r\nyears since the adoption of the Amendment to the \r\nConvention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear \r\nMaterial, progress towards its entry into force remains \r\nslow. I encourage the parties to the Convention to work \r\ntowards accelerating the entry into force of the \r\nAmendment. \r\n I take great pride in the fact that the Agency’s \r\ntechnical cooperation activities are making a real \r\ndifference in the lives of many people in developing \r\ncountries. As I mentioned, we make nuclear techniques \r\navailable to help fight cancer, boost food production, \r\ncombat animal diseases and improve the management \r\nof scarce water resources, to name just a few areas. \r\n Capacity-building is at the heart of our work in \r\ntechnical cooperation. The ultimate goal is to make \r\ncountries self-sufficient, to help them establish or \r\nmaintain a sustainable, highly specialized and trained \r\nhuman resource base in all areas of nuclear science and \r\napplications. \r\n The IAEA Peaceful Uses Initiative, announced \r\nthis year by the United States, with a generous \r\ncontribution of $50 million over a five-year period, has \r\n A/65/PV.46\r\n \r\n3 10-62124 \r\n \r\nresulted in increased funding for some of our technical \r\ncooperation activities, especially in the area of nuclear \r\npower infrastructure for countries embarking on new \r\nnuclear power programmes. I welcome a pledge of \r\nsupport from Japan and encourage other countries that \r\nare able to do so to contribute to that endeavour. \r\n Turning now to nuclear verification, I have \r\ncontinued to report regularly to the Board of Governors \r\non the implementation of the Agency’s safeguards \r\nagreements. I have stressed that all safeguards \r\nagreements between States and the Agency and other \r\nrelevant obligations should be implemented fully. In \r\nthat connection, the nuclear programme of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea remains a \r\nmatter of serious concern. The Agency has had no \r\ninspectors in the country since April 2009. The \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea has not \r\npermitted the Agency to implement safeguards in the \r\ncountry since December 2002, and it has not \r\nimplemented the measures called for in Security \r\nCouncil resolutions 1718 (2006) and 1874 (2009). I \r\ncall on all parties concerned to make concerted efforts \r\nfor a resumption of the Six-Party Talks at an \r\nappropriate time. \r\n In the case of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the \r\nAgency continues to verify the non-diversion of \r\ndeclared nuclear material, but the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran has not provided the necessary cooperation to \r\npermit the Agency to confirm that all nuclear material \r\nin Iran is devoted to peaceful activities. The \r\ncooperation needed includes, among others, full \r\nimplementation of the relevant resolutions of the IAEA \r\nBoard of Governors and of the Security Council. \r\n Turning now to the Middle East, I submitted a \r\nreport on Israeli nuclear capabilities to the IAEA \r\nGeneral Conference in September, as requested by the \r\nGeneral Conference in 2009. I also held consultations \r\non convening a forum on the relevance of the \r\nexperience of existing nuclear-weapon-free zones to \r\nthe establishment of such a zone in the Middle East, \r\nbut there was no convergence of views among member \r\nStates on that issue. \r\n The Agency is supporting the establishment of \r\nnuclear-weapon-free zones in various regions of the \r\nworld. The Review Conference of the Parties to the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \r\n(NPT) in May 2010 endorsed the convening of a \r\nconference in 2012, to be attended by all States of the \r\nMiddle East, on the establishment of a zone free of \r\nnuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass \r\ndestruction in that region. Having been personally \r\ninvolved in the NPT process since 1995, I was very \r\npleased that the 2010 NPT Review Conference \r\nproduced some concrete results. I hope that the \r\nproposed 2012 conference will take place with the \r\nparticipation of all relevant States and that it will lead \r\nto a productive outcome. \r\n Finally, I would like to reiterate that the Agency \r\nwill continue to implement all aspects of its mandate in \r\na balanced manner in order to address the varying \r\ninterests of member States and facilitate the safe and \r\nsecure peaceful uses of nuclear science and technology. \r\n The President (spoke in French): I now give the \r\nfloor to the representative of Pakistan to introduce \r\ndraft resolution A/65/L.10. \r\n Mr. Tarar (Pakistan): Pakistan’s recent election \r\nas Chair of the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\n(IAEA) Board of Governors for the 2010-2011 period \r\nis a singular honour and a manifestation of the \r\ninternational community’s acknowledgement of \r\nPakistan’s credentials and the role it can play with \r\nregard to the matters within the ambit of the Agency. \r\nWe look forward to working closely with the IAEA \r\nmember States, the Director General and his staff to \r\nfurther our collective interests in a cooperative and \r\nequitable manner. \r\n An expression of deep appreciation for Director \r\nGeneral Yukiya Amano is in order for his efforts to \r\npromote nuclear science and technology, which is the \r\nprimary mission of the IAEA. The role of the IAEA in \r\npromoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy is \r\nindispensable. The Agency is uniquely placed to \r\nfacilitate the transfer of nuclear technology to \r\ndeveloping countries. The global renaissance of \r\nnuclear power generation has enhanced the scope of \r\nthe Agency’s contribution to meeting the needs and \r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century. We are confident \r\nthat the Agency will ensure equitable access to nuclear \r\nmaterials, technology and equipment for peaceful \r\npurposes. As one of the earliest member States of the \r\nAgency, Pakistan has long been a strong advocate of \r\nutilizing nuclear technology for peace, progress and \r\nprosperity for all. \r\n Over the years, Pakistan itself has benefited \r\nimmensely from the expertise provided by the Agency \r\nin the form of expert missions, including the \r\nA/65/PV.46  \r\n \r\n10-62124 4 \r\n \r\nOperational Safety Review Team, Assessment of \r\nSafety-Significant Events Team missions, and the \r\nAgency’s Technical Cooperation Programme. \r\n Pakistan attaches the highest importance to the \r\nIAEA Technical Cooperation Programme. We have \r\ncontributed to it in the form of training, provision of \r\nexperts and hosting of seminars and workshops. We \r\nwould like to stress the need for enhanced and assured \r\nresource allocation for technical cooperation activities, \r\ntechnology transfer and training facilities for \r\ndeveloping countries. We also would like to emphasize \r\nthe importance of further strengthening and expansion \r\nof the Agency’s Technical Cooperation Programme \r\nthrough, inter alia, greater involvement of developing \r\ncountries in the Programme’s design and \r\nimplementation. \r\n Safety and verification issues are important \r\npillars of the IAEA mandate. We share the view that all \r\nStates should comply fully with their safeguards \r\nobligations and international commitments. Fulfilment \r\nby all States of their legal obligations is the most \r\nimportant step towards maintaining the credibility of \r\nthe safeguards regime. A balance between the Agency’s \r\nregulatory, promotional and safety functions will \r\nensure its continuing relevance in the context of \r\npromoting peaceful uses of nuclear energy and non-\r\nproliferation. \r\n There is a need for greater understanding and \r\ncooperation among the member States of the Agency to \r\nadvance its mandate on the basis of impartiality, equity \r\nand professionalism. Efforts are also required to \r\ncorrect the public perception of the IAEA as being just \r\na nuclear watchdog agency. The Agency’s primary role \r\nin the promotion of peaceful uses of nuclear science \r\nand technology needs to be re-emphasized. \r\n Pakistan has established a strong and independent \r\nnuclear safety and security infrastructure. The Pakistan \r\nNuclear Regulatory Authority, an independent entity, \r\nhas been in place for almost a decade now. Pakistan is \r\na party to several international conventions and \r\nactively participates in the nuclear safety and security \r\nactivities and programmes of the Agency. Pakistan is \r\nalso contributing to IAEA databases such as the Illicit \r\nTrafficking Database, the International Nuclear and \r\nRadiological Event Scale and the International \r\nReporting System for Operating Experience. \r\n Endowed with limited indigenous energy \r\nresources, Pakistan has long been a strong advocate of \r\nbuilding nuclear power plants. Pakistan was one of the \r\nearliest countries to launch a programme of nuclear \r\npower generation. Back in 1965, when Pakistan signed \r\nfor its first commercial nuclear power plant, it was the \r\nfifteenth country in the world and only the second \r\ndeveloping country to start a nuclear power \r\nprogramme. Our first nuclear power plant, KANUPP, \r\nstarted operation in 1972. The second power plant, the \r\nChashma Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1, has been in \r\noperation since 2000, while the second unit will be \r\ncommissioned next year. \r\n Pakistan has the experience of more than 45 years \r\nof safe reactor operation and a technical and \r\nengineering infrastructure to maintain and provide \r\ntechnical support to those plants. With a sizeable \r\ncivilian nuclear programme, a well-trained pool of \r\nexperts and decades of experience in nuclear \r\noperations in the areas of power generation, health, \r\nmedicine, agriculture, biotechnology and industrial \r\napplications, Pakistan is in a unique position to share \r\nits knowledge and expertise in a number of areas, \r\nunder IAEA safeguards, including through training \r\nplacements and expert missions. \r\n Pakistan has also been participating in the IAEA \r\nInternational Project on Innovative Nuclear Reactors \r\nand Fuel Cycles since its inception. Like other member \r\nStates, we congratulated the IAEA on the tenth \r\nanniversary of that very valuable programme in \r\nSeptember 2010. \r\n The Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission has \r\nbeen given a mandate by the Government of Pakistan \r\nto install 8,800 megawatts of nuclear energy by 2030 \r\nas part of our Energy Security Plan. The primary \r\nobjectives of the Plan are to offset shortages in power \r\ngeneration to meet the exponential rise in the energy \r\nrequirements of a growing population and an \r\nexpanding economy. Nuclear power generation is \r\ntherefore an indispensable component of our national \r\nenergy security strategy. The Plan envisages setting up \r\nseveral additional nuclear power reactors to increase \r\nthe share of nuclear power in the energy mix from the \r\ncurrent 0.8 per cent to 4.2 per cent by 2030. \r\n In addition to utilizing nuclear energy for power \r\ngeneration, Pakistan has also focused on applications \r\nof ionizing radiation and radioisotopes in the fields of \r\nhealth, agriculture and industry. The Pakistan Atomic \r\nEnergy Commission currently manages 14 nuclear \r\nmedical centres catering to around half a million \r\n A/65/PV.46\r\n \r\n5 10-62124 \r\n \r\npatients every year, most of them free of cost. Four \r\nadditional centres are under construction. Using its \r\nresearch reactor, the Pakistan Atomic Energy \r\nCommission produces domestically most of the \r\nradioisotopes required for medical purposes. Recently, \r\na molybdenum production facility was commissioned. \r\nBesides meeting the requirements of the country’s \r\nnuclear medical centres and hospitals, that facility will \r\nhave spare capacity for export to other countries. \r\n The entry into effect of the amendment to article \r\nVI of the Statute will enhance the representative \r\ncharacter of the IAEA Board of Governors, thereby \r\ncontributing to a more effective role for the Agency. \r\nWe hope the Agency secretariat will strengthen its \r\noutreach activities to achieve that objective. \r\n In Pakistan’s capacity as Chair of the IAEA \r\nBoard of Governors, allow me now to introduce, under \r\nagenda item 87, the draft resolution entitled “Report of \r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency”, contained in \r\ndocument А/65/L.10, on behalf of Albania, Argentina, \r\nArmenia, Australia, Austria, Bangladesh, Belarus, \r\nBelgium, Belize, Benin, Bosnia and Herzegovina, \r\nBrazil, Bulgaria, Burundi, Canada, Central African \r\nRepublic, Chile, Congo, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, \r\nCzech Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, \r\nDenmark, Dominican Republic, Egypt, Eritrea, \r\nEstonia, Ethiopia, Fiji, Finland, France, Germany, \r\nGreece, Guatemala, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, \r\nIraq, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Latvia, \r\nLiechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Madagascar, \r\nMalaysia, Malta, Monaco, Mongolia, Montenegro, \r\nNetherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Paraguay, \r\nPeru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Korea, \r\nRepublic of Moldova, Romania, Russian Federation, \r\nSerbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, \r\nSpain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Tonga, Trinidad and \r\nTobago, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom of Great \r\nBritain and Northern Ireland, United States of America \r\nand Uruguay, as well as on behalf of Pakistan. \r\n The result of consultations in Vienna, the \r\nconsensus text notes with appreciation, as in previous \r\nyears, the report of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (A/65/140); takes note of the resolutions \r\nadopted at the fifty-fourth regular session of the IAEA \r\nGeneral Conference held from 20 to 24 September; \r\nreaffirms the General Assembly’s strong support for \r\nthe Agency’s indispensable role in encouraging and \r\nassisting the development and practical application of \r\natomic energy for peaceful uses, in technology transfer \r\nto developing countries and in nuclear safety, \r\nverification and security; and appeals to Member States \r\nto continue to support the Agency’s activities. It is the \r\nhope of the sponsors that the draft resolution will, as it \r\nwas last year, be adopted by consensus. It is also open \r\nto further co-sponsorships. \r\n Mr. Janssens de Bisthoven (Belgium): I have the \r\nhonour to speak on behalf of the European Union (EU). \r\nThe candidate countries Turkey, Croatia and the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia; the countries of the \r\nStabilization and Association Process and potential \r\ncandidates Albania, Montenegro and Serbia; as well as \r\nthe Republic of Moldova, Armenia and Georgia, align \r\nthemselves with this statement. \r\n I would like to thank the Director General of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for his \r\npresentation of the Agency’s report for 2009 \r\n(A/65/140), as well as the delegate of Pakistan for his \r\nintroduction of the draft resolution (A/65/L.10) on the \r\nreport. The European Union member States are co-\r\nsponsors of the draft resolution. We thank the Chair of \r\nthe IAEA Board of Governors for his efforts, and we \r\nsincerely hope that the draft resolution will be adopted \r\nby consensus. \r\n The IAЕА was created more than five decades \r\nago to promote “Atoms for Peace”, with the mandate to \r\nincrease the contribution of nuclear energy to peace, \r\nhealth and prosperity, to ensure that nuclear activities \r\nare not diverted to military purposes, to spread a \r\nculture of safety and rigorous safety standards \r\nthroughout the world, and, more recently, to avert the \r\nrisk of nuclear terrorism. Today, the Agency is faced \r\nwith a number of compelling challenges, in particular \r\nnuclear proliferation and compliance issues. In that \r\ncontext, the European Union would like to thank IAEA \r\nDirector General Yukiya Amano and the IAEA \r\nsecretariat for their professional and impartial work. \r\nThe European Union assures them of its unfailing \r\nsupport. \r\n The year 2010 marks an important milestone for \r\nthe nuclear non-proliferation regime, which has been \r\ngiven new impetus. Committed to effective multilateral \r\naction against the proliferation of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction, the European Union warmly welcomes the \r\nconsensus reached at the 2010 Review Conference of \r\nthe Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) in May this year. The action \r\nA/65/PV.46  \r\n \r\n10-62124 6 \r\n \r\nplan (see NPT/CONF.2010/50) agreed on for all three \r\npillars of the NPT – non-proliferation, disarmament \r\nand peaceful uses – as well as the agreement on the \r\nprocess for implementation of the 1995 NPT resolution \r\non the Middle East, including a conference to be \r\nconvened in 2012, demonstrates our common resolve \r\nnot only to uphold but also to strengthen the nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation regime. \r\n The 2010 NPT Review Conference reaffirmed the \r\nrole of the IAEA in verifying and assuring compliance \r\nby States with their safeguards obligations, with a view \r\nto preventing the diversion of nuclear energy from \r\npeaceful uses to nuclear weapons. We now need to \r\nbegin implementing the NPT action plan, building on \r\nthe results of the Review Conference and continuing \r\nthe spirit of consensus and cooperation that \r\ncharacterized the negotiations. With regard to the \r\nAgency’s mandate, we will be particularly keen to \r\nensure that the IAEA operates in an effective and \r\nefficient manner and has adequate resources. The \r\nEuropean Union is fully committed to the \r\nimplementation of the action plan and will fully \r\nsupport the Agency’s efforts to that end. The European \r\nUnion invites all member States to engage actively \r\nwith the Agency in that regard. \r\n The Agency’s system of safeguards is a \r\nfundamental component of the nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation regime and plays an indispensable \r\nrole in the implementation of the NPT. The European \r\nUnion reiterates its view that the measures contained in \r\nthe Additional Protocol form an integral part of that \r\nsystem and that comprehensive safeguards agreements, \r\ntogether with the additional protocols, constitute the \r\ncurrent IAEA verification standard. The European \r\nUnion calls for the universalization of those two \r\nessential instruments of the IAEA safeguards system \r\nwithout delay, as a means to strengthen the non-\r\nproliferation regime, enhance security worldwide and \r\nincrease the confidence needed for international \r\ncooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy to \r\nreach its full potential. \r\n The European Union reaffirms its understanding \r\nof the role of the United Nations Security Council as \r\nthe final arbiter of international peace and security in \r\norder to take appropriate action in the event of non-\r\ncompliance with NPT obligations, including safeguards \r\nagreements. \r\n The European Union attaches the utmost \r\nimportance to a high level of nuclear safety worldwide. \r\nInternational cooperation is crucial for promoting the \r\nglobal nuclear safety network. \r\n Nuclear security is an essential programme of the \r\nAgency, and the European Union commends the IAEA \r\nfor its activities aimed at preventing and combating \r\nnuclear terrorism. The NPT Review Conference and \r\nthe Nuclear Security Summit emphasized the important \r\nrole of the IAEA in fostering international cooperation \r\nin nuclear security, establishing a comprehensive set of \r\nnuclear security guidelines and assisting member \r\nStates, upon their request, to enhance nuclear security. \r\n The European Union is of the firm view that each \r\ncountry has the right to define its own energy strategy. \r\nFor those countries that consider including, or plan to \r\ninclude, nuclear power in their energy strategies, the \r\nAgency has a key role to play in assisting them to \r\nensure that the development and operation of nuclear \r\npower takes place under the most stringent legal, \r\noperational safety, security and non-proliferation \r\nconditions. \r\n The European Union welcomes the Agency’s \r\nactivities to increase the contribution made by nuclear \r\ntechnology to peace, health and economic \r\ndevelopment. \r\n The European Union has always been a strong \r\nsupporter of the technical cooperation programme, to \r\nwhich it is one of the main contributors. We recognize \r\nthat addressing the global challenges of hunger, \r\ndisease, poverty and water resource management and \r\ncreating a cleaner and safer environment are \r\nparticularly significant for developing countries, and \r\nthe European Union values the efforts of the Agency in \r\nthose areas. \r\n The European Union reiterates its full support for \r\nthe IAEA and is pleased to co-sponsor the draft \r\nresolution on the report of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency before the Assembly. \r\n Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): I wish \r\nto begin by expressing the appreciation of the \r\ndelegation of Egypt to Mr. Yukiya Amano, Director \r\nGeneral of the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\n(IAEA), for his presentation of the key elements of the \r\nreport of the Agency on its activities in various fields. \r\nThe report reflects the continued effectiveness of the \r\nAgency in fulfilling its mandate in enhancing the \r\n A/65/PV.46\r\n \r\n7 10-62124 \r\n \r\nbalanced interests of member States in the three main \r\npillars of its activities: nuclear technology, nuclear \r\nsafety and security, and verification. \r\n In that context, and to repeat our continued \r\nsupport for the role of the Agency in all three pillars, \r\nEgypt joins, as it does every year, in co-sponsoring the \r\ndraft resolution entitled “Report of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency” (A/65/L.10). \r\n The IAEA plays a central role in the exercise of \r\nthe inalienable right provided to non-nuclear-weapon \r\nStates by article IV of the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) to \r\nacquire and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. \r\nThe final document of the NPT Review Conference \r\nreconfirmed that right last May, stressing the \r\nimportance of respecting the decisions and policies of \r\nnon-nuclear-weapon States relating to their acquisition \r\nof nuclear energy for development goals, and to the \r\npeaceful use of nuclear energy to implement such \r\nplans, without restrictions, by means of international \r\ncooperation to acquire the required nuclear \r\ntechnologies and material. \r\n While a large number of non-nuclear-weapon \r\nStates did not benefit from their right to nuclear energy \r\nin the past, the situation is changing in the face of the \r\nqualitative and quantitative increase in the energy \r\nneeds of countries of the developing world, including \r\nEgypt, imposed by international crises such as the \r\nenergy and climate change crises. \r\n Thus in 2006 Egypt decided, based on our \r\nnational, scientific and practical capabilities, to enter \r\nthe field of nuclear energy. We started the process in \r\nMarch 2010 by adopting national legislation \r\nestablishing a regulatory authority responsible for \r\nnuclear and radioactive safety, which reports to the \r\nPrime Minister. That was part of the preparations under \r\nway to build the first Egyptian nuclear reactor, in the \r\ncontext of the first phase of Egypt’s nuclear energy \r\nprogramme for generating electricity. The larger plan \r\nincludes building four nuclear reactors for electricity \r\ngeneration by the year 2025. Therefore, and in view of \r\nthe IAEA’s increasing role in enhancing sustainable \r\ndevelopment and effectively assisting non-nuclear-\r\nweapon States party to the NPT to meet their growing \r\nneeds for nuclear energy, Egypt looks forward to \r\nincreasing cooperation with the Agency in this \r\nimportant field. \r\n Egypt remains among the leading States that have \r\nprovided unlimited support to the IAEA since its \r\nestablishment, believing in the role of the Agency in \r\nthe field of verification of nuclear non-proliferation \r\nand its role in promoting the benefits of the peaceful \r\nuse of nuclear energy and supporting development \r\nambitions and international needs in a broad range of \r\nfields. \r\n However, the effectiveness of the comprehensive \r\nsafeguards system remains limited in light of the fact \r\nthat it is not universal, especially in the Middle East. \r\nIntensified international efforts are required to \r\nguarantee the implementation of the Comprehensive \r\nSafeguards System in all States of the region, without \r\nexception. To attain the goal of universalizing the \r\ncomprehensive safeguards system, especially in \r\nnon-nuclear-weapon States, it is essential that the \r\nAgency’s role be strengthened in verifying compliance \r\nof nuclear-weapon States with regard to commitment to \r\nnuclear disarmament. \r\n It is also essential to make more significant \r\nprogress in universalizing the NPT itself, especially in \r\nthe Middle East, through the accession of Israel to the \r\nTreaty as a non-nuclear-weapon State. That will enable \r\nnon-nuclear-weapon States to accept additional \r\nobligations, which may enhance the non-proliferation \r\nregime and lead to more balance in obligations in a \r\nnon-discriminatory manner at both the regional and \r\ninternational levels. \r\n On the regional level, all States of the Middle \r\nEast region have joined the Comprehensive Safeguards \r\nSystem with the exception of Israel, which continues to \r\nconduct suspicious nuclear activities outside any \r\ninternational control, disregarding tens of international \r\ncalls and resolutions demanding its accession to the \r\nNPT as a non-nuclear-weapon State. That undoubtedly \r\nincreases the risk of nuclear proliferation in the Middle \r\nEast in a manner that hinders the establishment of a \r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in the region. \r\n Egypt sees promising prospects for significant \r\nprogress in the field of universalizing the NPT in our \r\nregion and for the universalization of the application of \r\nComprehensive Safeguards there through the honest \r\nand balanced implementation of the detailed action \r\nplan adopted by the 2010 NPT Review Conference and \r\nthrough the immediate start of preparations for \r\nconvening the international conference in 2012 to \r\nlaunch regional negotiations aimed at the establishment \r\nA/65/PV.46  \r\n \r\n10-62124 8 \r\n \r\nof a zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons \r\nof mass destruction in the Middle East. In that context, \r\nEgypt reaffirms the importance of the role mandated by \r\nthe 2010 NPT Review Conference to the IAEA in \r\nimplementing the Action Plan and renews its intention \r\nto work seriously with the Agency and with other \r\nconcerned parties to secure the success of the 2012 \r\nconference and its achieving the anticipated results. \r\n On the international level, Egypt welcomes the \r\nsignature of the New START agreement between the \r\nUnited States of America and the Russian Federation \r\nand the subsequent trilateral agreement between the \r\nIAEA and both countries. Through the trilateral \r\nagreement a large amount of weapons-grade fissile \r\nmaterial from previous nuclear programmes will be \r\nsubject to verification by the Agency and be down-\r\nblended for peaceful use in power reactors, thus \r\nensuring that such material will not return to military \r\nnuclear programmes. \r\n Egypt looks forward to expanding the application \r\nof that framework to cover larger and more \r\ncomprehensive forms of quantities of weapons-grade \r\nmaterial and to include all other nuclear-weapon States \r\nin order to bring elements of transparency, \r\nirreversibility and effective verifiability of progress \r\ninto the field of nuclear disarmament. That will help \r\nthe NPT regime to recover its balance and allow the \r\nAgency to play a real role in this crucial area. \r\n The Agency has the central role as the sole \r\ninternational forum mandated to work in the \r\nmultilateral context on developing and supervising the \r\napplication of the highest standards of nuclear safety \r\nand security in nuclear energy reactors and on \r\ncontributing to the ability of developing countries to \r\nsafely benefit from nuclear energy. Bearing that in \r\nmind, Egypt took part in the Nuclear Security Summit \r\nheld in Washington last April and participates in all the \r\npreparatory meetings for the next summit in order to \r\ncontribute to any international effort aimed at dealing \r\nwith such extremely sensitive issues. Our success in \r\nachieving progress on those issues will be difficult \r\nwithout true international joint efforts based on \r\nstrengthening the NPT regime and realizing its \r\nuniversality, on the one hand, and achieving more \r\nprogress in nuclear disarmament efforts, on the other. \r\n In the area of technical cooperation, Egypt has \r\nopened its nuclear facilities and laboratories to States \r\nin the Arab region and the African continent and has \r\nplaced its experience in this field at their service, as we \r\nbelieve in the importance of international cooperation \r\nactivities in the peaceful use of nuclear energy. In that \r\ncontext, Egypt stresses the priority of IAEA technical \r\ncooperation activities, both for Egypt and for other \r\ndeveloping countries that benefit from programmes on \r\nthe use of nuclear technologies in health, agriculture, \r\nfood, water resources, radioactive isotopes and \r\nradiation technologies, inter alia. \r\n While Egypt supports expanding the Agency’s \r\nactivities in the area of the production of radioactive \r\nisotopes required to cure cancer, and while we \r\ncurrently cooperate with the Agency to begin the \r\noperation of a new medical radioactive isotopes \r\nproduction facility for that purpose, my country also \r\nwelcomes the development and upgrading of the \r\nAgency’s technical cooperation strategy aimed at \r\nsupporting the realization of the development \r\nobjectives of member States and identifying the vital \r\nactivities to which nuclear technology can effectively \r\ncontribute in the short and intermediate terms. \r\nConsequently, we reaffirm the importance of securing \r\nand increasing financing for the international \r\ncooperation activities of the Agency, given that such \r\nactivities are among its central functions, according to \r\nits Statute. \r\n In conclusion, I reiterate that Egypt intends to \r\nintensify and increase cooperation with the Agency \r\nwithin our continued effort to enhance our national \r\ncapabilities in the peaceful use of nuclear energy and to \r\nbenefit from the Agency’s full support in our national \r\nefforts in this important field. \r\n Mr. Benítez Versón (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nCuba welcomes and supports the important role of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The \r\napplication of nuclear techniques contributes to \r\nmitigating soil deterioration, desertification, warming \r\nof the atmosphere and other natural phenomena that \r\naffect the production of food and the life of man on \r\nEarth. \r\n We give high priority to cooperation between \r\ndeveloping countries. In that context, Cuba salutes the \r\ntwenty-fifth anniversary of the Regional Cooperative \r\nAgreement for the Promotion of Nuclear Science and \r\nTechnology in Latin America and the Caribbean, \r\nknown as ARCAL. \r\n The technical cooperation pillar of the IAEA \r\nshould be strengthened and should receive the \r\n A/65/PV.46\r\n \r\n9 10-62124 \r\n \r\nresources it needs on an unconditional basis, in \r\naccordance with its priority. \r\n Our commitment to technical cooperation is \r\nstrong, as can be shown through the following \r\nexamples, to cite just a few. First, Cuba strictly \r\ncomplies with its obligations under the IAEA technical \r\ncooperation programme. In 2009, we achieved an \r\nimplementation rate for national programmes of 85 per \r\ncent, which was higher than the general and regional \r\naverage. Secondly, our country participated broadly in \r\nthe coordinated research programmes. In 2009, Cuban \r\nresearchers took part in 29 research contracts under \r\nthose programmes. Thirdly, Cuba strictly complies \r\nwith its financial commitments to the IAEA Technical \r\nCooperation Fund, including a contribution of 100 per \r\ncent of expenses for national participation. \r\n The economic, commercial and financial \r\nblockade, which the Government of the United States \r\nof America has imposed on Cuba for over 50 years, \r\naffects the activities of the IAEA in our country and is \r\nin violation of the Statute of the Agency. Up to \r\nDecember 2009, the embargo has caused Cuba \r\neconomic losses of over $100.154 billion, calculated in \r\na very conservative fashion. Because of the embargo, \r\nthe IAEA is having difficulties in purchasing \r\nspecialized equipment for projects in Cuba, since \r\nAmerican companies or companies with American \r\nshare capital cannot sell that equipment for use in \r\nCuba, since they face the possibility of sanctions. \r\nSimilarly, Cuban citizens have difficulties when it \r\ncomes to participating in training programmes \r\norganized in the United States. That impacts the \r\nimplementation of programmes linked to the fight \r\nagainst cancer, which is a priority for the IAEA. \r\n By denouncing here once again the unjust and \r\nunlawful embargo — which was condemned in this \r\nHall just a few days ago by the overwhelming majority \r\nof the States Members of the United Nations — Cuba \r\nrecognizes at the same time the constant efforts of the \r\nIAEA secretariat to seek alternatives and find solutions \r\nto that situation. \r\n The IAEA certified once again that Cuba strictly \r\ncomplies with its commitments in the area of \r\nsafeguards, confirming us as a country with no \r\nundeclared nuclear material or activities. \r\n We note with profound concern the climate of \r\nmistrust that has been encouraged with regard to the \r\nIAEA verification work in the Islamic Republic of Iran \r\nand the Syrian Arab Republic as a result of geopolitical \r\ninterests and double standards known to all. We \r\nconfirm that verification activities should first respect \r\nthe sovereignty and national interests of member \r\nStates. Also, they should include impartial professional \r\naction by the inspectors and the rest of the personnel of \r\nthe IAEA secretariat, free from any pressure or \r\ninterference that would undermine the Agency’s \r\neffectiveness and credibility. \r\n We call on the secretariat of the IAEA to continue \r\nworking to promote a climate of trust, understanding \r\nand transparency, based on objectivity and truth. In that \r\ncontext, we reaffirm the need to respect the inalienable \r\nright of all States to the use of nuclear energy for \r\npeaceful purposes. \r\n We confirm our support for the denuclearization \r\nof the Korean peninsula and for a solution negotiated \r\nby the actors involved. \r\n We also reiterate our support for the \r\nestablishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the \r\nMiddle East. The call for an international conference in \r\n2012 to establish such a zone, approved at the eighth \r\nReview Conference of the Parties to the \r\nNon-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), is an important step in \r\nthat direction. We urge Israel to adhere to the NPT \r\nwithout delays or conditions. Israel must put all of its \r\nnuclear installations under the broad safeguards of the \r\nIAEA. \r\n On the subject of nuclear fuel supplies, we stress \r\nthat the issue must be addressed in an inclusive and \r\ntransparent way that leads to consensus adoption of \r\nany decisions. Cuba rejects any attempt to use the \r\nsupply of nuclear fuel as a means of political or \r\neconomic coercion or as a mechanism to establish the \r\nmonopoly of a few over the distribution of nuclear \r\nfuel. \r\n I would like to conclude by stressing the common \r\nresponsibility that we all have to bequeath a safer \r\nworld to future generations. That is why nuclear \r\ndisarmament cannot continue to be a goal constantly \r\npostponed and subjected to conditions. Cuba will stand \r\nfirm in the battle for a better world, free of nuclear \r\narms. \r\n Mr. Hermoso (Philippines): At the outset, the \r\nPhilippines would like to express its deep appreciation \r\nfor the work done by Director General Yukiya Amano \r\nand the secretariat of the International Atomic Energy \r\nA/65/PV.46  \r\n \r\n10-62124 10 \r\n \r\nAgency (IAEA). The Philippines welcomes the report \r\nof the IAEA and recognizes the importance of the \r\nAgency. At the same time, the Philippines reaffirms its \r\nstrong support for the Agency’s crucial role in assisting \r\nits member States in the peaceful uses of nuclear \r\nenergy, the transfer of technology to developing \r\ncountries and facilitating nuclear knowledge-sharing, \r\nas well as in nuclear safety, verification and security. \r\n Through its cooperation with the IAEA, the \r\nPhilippines has been developing the necessary human \r\nresources and physical infrastructure for the utilization \r\nof nuclear technologies to help meet the challenges \r\nmany of us face today, particularly in food security, \r\nenvironmental resource management and human \r\nhealth. The Philippines believes that science and \r\ntechnology can help us achieve our Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and places great importance on the \r\nvarious applications of nuclear technology, especially \r\nin the area of food security, where Philippine \r\ncooperation with the IAEA in agriculture has a direct \r\nbearing on the Philippine Government’s programme to \r\nensure affordable food for the tables of Filipino \r\nfamilies. \r\n The Philippines and IAEA also have extensive \r\nlinks in other areas of technical cooperation. There has \r\nbeen much success in increasing industrial \r\nproductivity, irradiation of food exports, providing \r\naccess to clean drinking water and addressing \r\nenvironmental challenges. \r\n The Philippines and the IAEA also cooperate in \r\nthe important field of cancer therapy, namely, the \r\nProgramme of Action for Cancer Therapy, or PACT. \r\nThe Philippines is pleased that the Agency made that a \r\npriority activity, given the rise in the number of cancer \r\npatients, particularly in the developing world. My \r\ndelegation believes that collaboration with the PACT \r\nwill lead to enhanced cancer training capabilities in the \r\nregion, in the context of the regional cancer training \r\nnetwork. The Philippines urges member States to \r\ncontinue to support the Programme through additional \r\ncontributions. \r\n The 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the \r\nNon-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) underlined the \r\nimportant role of the IAEA in helping countries \r\nachieve their Millennium Development Goals through \r\nits technical cooperation programme and its various \r\nactivities in nuclear power and non-power applications. \r\nSimilarly, the Review Conference reaffirmed the role \r\nof the IAEA in safeguards verification, with a view to \r\npreventing the diversion of nuclear energy from \r\npeaceful uses, and in the promotion of nuclear safety \r\nand nuclear security. \r\n The Philippines subscribes to the report’s \r\nassessment that the use of nuclear energy will expand \r\nin the coming decades. It will be an overarching force \r\nthat will create opportunities as well as challenges for \r\nmember States and the IAEA. With that coming \r\nexpansion, nuclear safety and nuclear security are \r\ntherefore vital and should be given high priority. \r\n The Philippines had the distinct honour of \r\npresiding over the 2010 NPT Review Conference and \r\nlooks forward to working with other delegations in \r\nmoving forward and implementing the follow-on \r\nactions set out in the Final Document (see \r\nNPT/CONF.2010/50 (Vol. I)) related to the work of the \r\nAgency. \r\n The Philippines actively participated in the \r\nnegotiation of the resolutions mentioned in the report \r\nand believes that they can provide sufficient direction \r\nto the activities that the Agency will carry out in the \r\ncoming year. The resolutions reflect member States’ \r\nongoing priorities with regard to the different aspects \r\nof the Agency’s work, taking into consideration current \r\nrealities, particularly the limitations in resources vis-à-\r\nvis the growing demands of member States for \r\ntechnical assistance. \r\n However, the Philippines believes that the IAEA \r\ncan contribute to addressing global concerns only if it \r\npursues its activities in a balanced manner. We have \r\nconsistently stressed the importance of addressing the \r\nlong-standing concern of developing countries in \r\nachieving a balance between the Agency’s promotional \r\nrole as outlined in article II of its Statute and its \r\nactivities in nuclear safety, verification and security. \r\n The Philippines continues to recognize that the \r\nchallenges and issues confronting the Agency are \r\ncomplicated by political realities. The member States \r\nof the Agency need to overcome their differences if we \r\nare to advance our common objectives. The \r\nPhilippines, for its part, remains committed to working \r\ntogether in the spirit of mutual trust, respect, \r\ntransparency and constructive dialogue. \r\n Mr. Kleib (Indonesia): Indonesia welcomes the \r\nprogress that the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\n(IAEA) has achieved so far in accelerating and \r\n A/65/PV.46\r\n \r\n11 10-62124 \r\n \r\nenlarging the contribution of atomic energy to peace, \r\nhealth and prosperity in the world. In that regard, we \r\ncommend the able leadership of its Director General, \r\nAmbassador Yukiya Amano. We are confident that \r\nunder the framework of its three pillars, the Agency \r\nwill continue to play a key role as a catalyst for \r\nsustainable development by promoting peaceful uses of \r\nnuclear energy while minimizing the risk of nuclear \r\nproliferation.  \r\n The progress in the betterment of people’s lives \r\ndue to the critical application of nuclear science and \r\ntechnology cannot be emphasized enough. We are \r\npleased that the Director General has put more weight \r\non the promotion of nuclear technology, particularly \r\nfor cancer control. The role of the IAEA in addressing \r\nthe world food crisis last year and its work in \r\nimproving agricultural productivity and quality through \r\nscientific and technical means are also extremely vital. \r\nIn our view, those important roles of the IAEA will \r\nstrengthen its technical reputation, in contrast to the \r\noverwhelming perception that the Agency exists \r\nmerely as a nuclear watchdog. In that regard, we stand \r\nready to support the Director General’s approach. \r\n In the efforts of developing countries to utilize \r\nnuclear technology for the benefit of humanity, the \r\nAgency makes an indispensable contribution that \r\nshould continue to be supported internationally. We \r\nunderscore the utmost importance of the technical \r\ncooperation programme as a vital instrument for the \r\ntransfer of nuclear science and technology, particularly \r\nto developing regions. In that respect the Agency’s \r\ntechnical cooperation should be made more robust and \r\noperational on its own merits, and should not in any \r\nway be politicized. \r\n We welcome the IAEA Peaceful Uses Initiative \r\nand laud all countries that have pledged their support \r\nto contribute to that effort. It is our hope that a \r\nsignificant portion of the funds for the Initiative will be \r\nused to finance the request-based technical cooperation \r\nprojects. \r\n In that regard, Indonesia commends the fact that \r\nthe 2010 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review \r\nConference, in action 54, gave its clear support to the \r\nIAEA for making every effort and for taking practical \r\nsteps to ensure that the Agency’s resources for \r\ntechnical cooperation activities are sufficient, assured \r\nand predictable (see NPT/CONF.2010/50 (Vol. I)). That \r\ndecision provides a sound basis for the Agency to \r\nstrengthen the planning, programming and \r\nimplementation of its technical cooperation. \r\n Indonesia will again have the privilege of being a \r\nmember of the IAEA Board of Governors next year. We \r\nintend to utilize that opportunity to further expand the \r\nAgency’s focus in facilitating the peaceful uses of \r\nnuclear energy in the world, especially in developing \r\ncountries. Since becoming an IAEA member in 1957, \r\nIndonesia has been steadfast in its commitment to the \r\nAgency’s technical cooperation. Indonesia itself has \r\nbenefited significantly from IAEA cooperation in the \r\nareas of food, agriculture, health, water resources \r\nmanagement and other peaceful uses of nuclear energy. \r\n While we look forward to enhancing our \r\nengagement with the IAEA, we hope for greater \r\ncollaboration and support by the Agency in the \r\napplication of nuclear science and technology in the \r\nregion. As part of our commitment to nuclear safety, \r\nwe continue to support the Asian Nuclear Safety \r\nNetwork (ANSN). In April 2010, Indonesia hosted the \r\nthird Nuclear Safety Strategy Dialogue meeting of \r\nANSN. At that meeting, the participant countries \r\nachieved mutual understanding on the utilization of \r\nhuman and information technology networks, among \r\nothers, to continuously improve effective and \r\nsustainable nuclear security in the region. \r\n The IAEA report shows that the Agency has \r\ndevoted its special attention to assisting Member States \r\nin meeting their energy needs, responding to concerns \r\nabout climate change and helping them to ensure food \r\nsecurity and access to clean water. Among those \r\ncritical applications, the report demonstrates how \r\nhealth care can be improved through the use of nuclear \r\ntechniques and accordingly save lives. \r\n In that context and as a reflection of our deep \r\nappreciation of such efforts by the Agency, Indonesia is \r\npleased to join others in co-sponsoring the draft \r\nresolution regarding the work of the IAEA \r\n(A/65/L.10). \r\n Mr. Wang Min (China) (spoke in Chinese): The \r\nChinese delegation would like to thank the Director \r\nGeneral of the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\n(IAEA), Mr. Yukiya Amano, for his report on the work \r\nof the IAEA over the past year. \r\n We note with appreciation that the IAEA has \r\ndone much work to promote peaceful uses of nuclear \r\nenergy and to prevent proliferation of nuclear weapons. \r\nA/65/PV.46  \r\n \r\n10-62124 12 \r\n \r\nIn carrying out its technical cooperation programme, \r\nthe IAEA has actively assisted member States in \r\ndeveloping nuclear energy and using it for peaceful \r\npurposes. It continues to improve the guideline \r\ndocuments in the field of nuclear security and safety \r\nand to assist member States in strengthening relevant \r\ncapabilities. The IAEA has also made efforts to \r\npromote the universality of safeguards agreements and \r\nthe additional protocol and has earnestly performed its \r\nsafeguards function. We are glad to see that the role of \r\nthe IAEA has been widely recognized and supported by \r\nmember States. \r\n Over the past year, with the fast development of \r\nChina’s nuclear energy, cooperation between the IAEA \r\nand China has been further enhanced. \r\n In the field of technical cooperation, the nuclear \r\nenergy special programme has been steadily \r\nimplemented. In June 2010, China signed the 2010-\r\n2015 China Technical Cooperation Country \r\nProgramme Framework with the IAEA, which lays out \r\na solid blueprint for future cooperation. \r\n In the field of nuclear safety, by drawing on the \r\nstandards and norms developed by the IAEA, China \r\nhas put in place relevant legislation and a regulatory \r\nsystem that is in line with international practice. This \r\nyear, at China’s invitation, for the first time the IAEA \r\nsent an Integrated Regulatory Review Service mission \r\nto China to review its nuclear safety regulatory \r\nframework. \r\n Also in the area of nuclear safety, China supports \r\nthe essential role of the IAEA and has actively \r\nparticipated in the development of relevant guideline \r\ndocuments, which have been applied to its nuclear \r\npractices. China signed with the IAEA a Practical \r\nCooperation Arrangement on nuclear security, which \r\nexpands cooperation in such fields as the establishment \r\nof security legislation and standards, capacity-building \r\nand personnel training, as well as nuclear security for \r\nmajor public events. China will also cooperate with \r\nrelevant countries to set up a centre of excellence for \r\nnuclear security in China. \r\n In the area of safeguards, China strictly fulfils its \r\nsafeguards obligation, in accordance with the \r\nsafeguards agreement and the additional protocol \r\nsigned with the IAEA. China supports the Agency’s \r\nefforts to enhance its verification capacity and to \r\npromote the effectiveness and the universality of the \r\ninternational safeguards regime. \r\n China appreciates the great assistance provided \r\nby the IAEA on developing nuclear energy over the \r\nyears and is willing to further enhance its cooperation \r\nwith the Agency in all relevant fields. At the same \r\ntime, China is ready to provide the necessary assistance \r\nto other countries through the IAEA by sharing the \r\nexperience that it has accumulated in developing \r\nnuclear energy. \r\n With the rapid development of global nuclear \r\nenergy, the IAEA’s role is becoming ever more \r\nimportant. It is our hope that with the support of all \r\nmember States, the IAEA’s functions in all fields will \r\nbe further strengthened and that it will focus its work \r\non the following aspects. \r\n First, the Agency should strengthen technical \r\ncooperation and assistance so as to assist member \r\nStates in benefiting from the peaceful uses of nuclear \r\nenergy. It should take into account the opinions of \r\nmember States, especially those of developing \r\ncountries, and take steps to meet their needs for \r\ntechnical assistance. \r\n Secondly, it should continue to foster the \r\ndevelopment of global nuclear safety and security \r\nlegislation, regulation and a standards system, assist \r\nmember States in enhancing their relevant capability, \r\nand strengthen the confidence of the public in \r\ndeveloping nuclear energy. \r\n Thirdly, it should continue to play an active role \r\nin addressing sensitive hot-spot nuclear issues. \r\nDialogue and negotiation are the only way towards a \r\npeaceful resolution of the Korean peninsular and \r\nIranian nuclear issues. We hope that the IAEA and the \r\nDirector General will make full use of their advantage \r\nand play a constructive role in restarting and promoting \r\nrelevant dialogue and negotiation processes. \r\n Ms. Sodov (Mongolia): My delegation would like \r\nto thank Mr. Yukiya Amano, Director General of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for \r\npresenting the annual report on the work of the Agency. \r\nI also wish to thank the representative of Pakistan for \r\nintroducing the draft resolution entitled “Report of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency”, contained in \r\ndocument A/65/L.10, in Pakistan’s capacity as \r\nChairman of the Board of Governors of the IAEA. \r\nMongolia fully supports the report and is co-\r\nsponsoring the draft resolution. \r\n A/65/PV.46\r\n \r\n13 10-62124 \r\n \r\n The IAEA today plays an important role in \r\ndealing simultaneously with freedom from fear and \r\nfreedom from want. The Final Document of the 2010 \r\nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference \r\n(NPT/CONF.2010/50 (Vol. I)) and the consideration of \r\ndisarmament issues in the First Committee vividly \r\ndemonstrate the role that the Agency plays, and is \r\nexpected to play, in promoting a peaceful and secure \r\nfuture for humankind. \r\n The report of the Agency and the outcome of its \r\nfifty-fourth General Conference, held in September in \r\nVienna, show that the Agency is set to play an ever-\r\nincreasing role in the economic and social development \r\nof the international community, especially in \r\ndeveloping countries, in promoting the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. The renewed interest in nuclear \r\nenergy places additional responsibilities on the Agency \r\nfor strengthening nuclear security and the safest use of \r\nnuclear energy and its other applications. My \r\ndelegation highly commends the efforts of the Agency \r\nin assisting developing countries through its technical \r\ncooperation programme in the areas of the peaceful \r\nuses and development of nuclear technology. \r\n I would like to express my Government’s \r\ngratitude to the Agency and its dedicated staff, \r\nespecially its Department of Technical Cooperation and \r\nthe Programme of Action for Cancer Therapy (PACT) \r\nOffice for their contribution in promoting the Agency’s \r\nnoble mission in that area. Like other countries, \r\nMongolia attaches great importance to that programme, \r\nespecially its efforts to promote early detection of \r\ncancer. \r\n This year, Mongolia has been designated as the \r\neighth PACT Model Demonstration Site (PMDS) \r\ncountry. That allows it to combine the country’s \r\nresources with the expertise of the Agency, the World \r\nHealth Organization (WHO) and other partners and \r\nstakeholders to combat the growing epidemic of \r\ncancer, which has become the second cause of \r\nmortality in my country. \r\n I would like, therefore, to take this opportunity to \r\nexpress my Government’s gratitude to the IAEA and its \r\nDirector General for the support that they are providing \r\nin that important field. Mongolia is ready to continue \r\nto work and support the Agency’s efforts to assist \r\ndeveloping countries in the field of human health, \r\nparticularly in nuclear medicine and diagnostic \r\nradiology. \r\n A week ago, Director General Yukiya Amano \r\npaid a visit to Mongolia and we exchanged views on \r\nfurther developing Mongolia-IAEA cooperation. He \r\nalso attended a workshop of the PMDS countries on \r\nissues related to primary measures to prevent cancers \r\nand the role of medical first services, organized by \r\nIAEA-PACT, the WHO and the Ministry of Health of \r\nMongolia. The results of the workshop will make an \r\nimportant contribution to the exchange of experience \r\nand knowledge in that important area of fighting \r\ncancer. \r\n For Mongolia, like for many other agrarian \r\ncountries, the agricultural sector is the major economic \r\narea that defines the welfare and prosperity of its \r\npeople. Therefore, my delegation welcomes the joint \r\nAgency-Food and Agricultural Organization of the \r\nUnited Nations programmes to boost crop and \r\nlivestock production, and to ensure food quality, safety \r\nand security, all of which represent the basic needs of \r\nany people. My delegation thus agrees that it is \r\nextremely important that the Agency continues to help \r\nMember States to reach the MDGs by improving \r\nagricultural productivity. \r\n As a member of the Agency, Mongolia is trying \r\nto play an important role in promoting the noble goals \r\nwe share that are enshrined in its Statute. At present, \r\nMongolia is serving on the Board of Governors and is \r\nworking to contribute to its fruitful work. \r\n Mongolia also had the honour of chairing the \r\nfifty-fourth IAEA General Conference, which adopted \r\nmany important resolutions and decisions in pursuit of \r\nthe Agency’s near, mid-term and long-term objectives \r\naimed at peaceful uses of nuclear energy. \r\n In conclusion, I would like to reiterate \r\nMongolia’s active support for IAEA activities and their \r\nobjectives. \r\n Mr. Dabbashi (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): Allow me, at the outset, to thank \r\nMr. Yukiya Amano, Director General of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for \r\nintroducing the report of the Agency (A/65/140) and \r\nhis commendable efforts as Director General of the \r\nAgency. \r\n My delegation emphasizes the important role of \r\nthe IAEA and its internationally sanctioned mandate to \r\ncarry out a number of very important duties in the area \r\nof peaceful uses of nuclear energy. These duties are \r\nA/65/PV.46  \r\n \r\n10-62124 14 \r\n \r\nbased on the three pillars of nuclear supervision and \r\nverification, safety and technical cooperation. \r\n We commend the assistance that the Agency \r\nprovides to developing nations in the area of peaceful \r\nuses of nuclear energy, and Libya aspires to more \r\nintense and effective cooperation in the future with the \r\nAgency in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, \r\nespecially in the fields of medicine and desalination. \r\n The selective approach being imposed on the \r\nAgency’s resolutions and decisions by some of the \r\nmajor influential Powers has brought disappointment to \r\nmany Member States. There has been more verification \r\nand supervision of certain specific countries and their \r\nactivities, while a blind eye is turned to other countries. \r\nThis is a flagrant injustice which erodes confidence in \r\nthe credibility of the Agency and its work as well as of \r\nthe intentions of some of the major Powers. \r\n In the Middle East region, we note that the Israeli \r\nentity has a large nuclear arsenal that threatens the \r\npeace and security of the region. Nonetheless, that \r\nentity remained outside IAEA supervision. The agency \r\nremains unable to take any effective position that \r\nwould make the Israeli authorities also subject their \r\nnuclear facilities to IAEA supervision. \r\n That is basically due to the fact that Israel has not \r\njoined the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), something \r\nthe international community must seek to achieve in \r\nevery possible way. \r\n We believe that it is high time to implement the \r\ndecision of the 1995 NPT Review and Extension \r\nConference, relative to the establishment of a nuclear-\r\nfree zone in the Middle East. \r\n Regrettably, while the Agency ignores the known \r\ndanger of the Israeli nuclear threat, it deploys greater \r\nefforts to pursue the peaceful nuclear activities of other \r\nStates where, thus far, there is no evidence at all that \r\nthose States seek to acquire nuclear weapons. \r\n In that context, Libya reiterates and emphasizes \r\nthe right of all States to the peaceful use of nuclear \r\nenergy and to the development of its technology. We \r\nalso call for the peaceful settlement of all disputes on \r\nnuclear programmes among the member States of the \r\nNPT to be negotiated in good faith and through \r\nconsultations and dialogue. \r\n My delegation expresses its disappointment that \r\nthe mandate of the Agency does not include the nuclear \r\nStates that have large arsenals of nuclear weapons, \r\nweapons concerning which the entire international \r\ncommunity is calling for their rapid and complete \r\nelimination, as stipulated in article VI of the NPT. \r\n It is thus urgent and important that the \r\ninternational community deploy all efforts possible to \r\nstrengthen the role of the IAEA and to review its \r\nmandate, so that it will cover all countries, without \r\nexception or discrimination, in conformity with a strict \r\nand effective international approach that includes \r\nverification and supervision of the reduction by nuclear \r\nStates of their nuclear weapons until they are totally \r\neliminated. It must also include a balanced \r\nimplementation of the pillars of the NPT, namely, non-\r\nproliferation, nuclear disarmament and the peaceful use \r\nof nuclear energy. \r\n In conclusion, my delegation emphasizes the \r\nimportance of the Agency’s technical assistance to \r\nStates parties to the NPT. To that effect, we call on all \r\nStates parties to expand their technical cooperation in \r\norder to support the Agency with all the resources \r\npossible, so that it can most effectively play its role in \r\nthat respect, given its importance in helping developing \r\nnations to benefit from the peaceful uses of nuclear \r\nenergy in implementing development programmes. We \r\nappeal to advanced countries to facilitate the export of \r\nnuclear technology for peaceful purposes to developing \r\nnations, including to my country, aspiring to use it in \r\nthe fields of medicine, agriculture, energy production \r\nand other fields, which is a right stipulated in the NPT. \r\n Ms. Martina (Ukraine): The year 2010 marks an \r\nimportant milestone for the international nuclear non-\r\nproliferation regime. The consensus reached at the \r\n2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on \r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the \r\naction plan for nuclear disarmament based on all three \r\npillars of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) demonstrate the resolve of all \r\nStates not only to uphold but also to strengthen the \r\nnuclear non-proliferation regime. \r\n Ukraine has always been committed to effective \r\nmultilateral action against the proliferation of weapons \r\nof mass destruction. We believe that we made a \r\nvaluable contribution to the success of the 2010 NPT \r\nReview Conference, chairing Main Committee II of the \r\nConference, which dealt with non-proliferation issues. \r\nWe are particularly glad that States managed in 2010 to \r\nsecure an agreement on further steps to implement the \r\n A/65/PV.46\r\n \r\n15 10-62124 \r\n \r\n1995 NPT resolution on the Middle East \r\n(NPT/CONF.1995/32 (Part I), annex), including a \r\nconference on the topic to be convened in 2012. That is \r\nwhy it is of utmost importance to build upon the results \r\nof the 2010 NPT Review Conference and to avoid \r\ntrends that might undermine the success achieved. \r\n Ukraine strictly fulfils its obligations under our \r\nsafeguards agreement and the additional protocol. \r\nSince January 2006, a comprehensive safeguards \r\nagreement and additional protocol has been in force in \r\nUkraine. We continue to work with the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to establish the \r\nnecessary conditions to start the implementation of \r\nIAEA integrated safeguards in Ukraine. \r\n Each country has the right to define its own \r\nenergy strategy. We are convinced that human \r\nresources development, including education and \r\ntraining, is of vital importance for the safe, secure and \r\npeaceful use of atomic energy. \r\n It is well known that both the Convention on \r\nNuclear Safety and the Joint Convention on the Safety \r\nof Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of \r\nRadioactive Waste Management were developed, inter \r\nalia, as the result of lessons learned from the \r\nChernobyl disaster and that both Conventions provide \r\nGovernments with valuable instruments for \r\nstreamlining national activities in order to achieve the \r\nhighest safety levels. We consider that participation in \r\nsuch instruments provides strong incentives and is in \r\nthe best interest of any country with or planning to \r\nhave its own nuclear power programme. Ukraine calls \r\nupon States embarking on a nuclear power programme \r\nto become contracting parties to those Conventions \r\nwithout delay or hesitation. We are also of the view \r\nthat the Agency’s comprehensive set of safety \r\nstandards is fundamental for any nuclear programme \r\nand any nuclear technology application. We note with \r\nsatisfaction the recent establishment of the \r\nInternational Nuclear Safety Centre as well as the \r\nInternational Seismic Safety Centre. \r\n In May this year, the IAEA presented the final \r\nreport of the Joint European Community-IAEA-\r\nUkraine project on the comprehensive safety \r\nassessment of all operating Ukrainian nuclear power \r\nplants. For the past two years, the Agency has \r\nconducted a number of missions to all 15 Ukrainian \r\nnuclear power reactors, covering issues of design \r\nsafety, operational safety and waste safety. The legal \r\nand governmental infrastructure has been assessed via \r\nthe full scope of the Integrated Regulatory Review \r\nService mission as well. We are pleased to note the \r\npositive conclusions of that in-depth review and \r\nconsider such missions to provide unprecedented and \r\nextremely valuable tools for many other countries \r\nstriving to embark on the development of nuclear \r\nenergy. We would like to encourage other countries \r\nboth with mature and with emerging nuclear power \r\nprogrammes to consider conducting such missions and \r\nassessments. \r\n I would like to inform delegations that Ukraine \r\nparticipates in the work of the International Uranium \r\nEnrichment Centre in Angarsk (Russia), which is the \r\nfirst such type of joint enterprises and which may serve \r\nas an example for future activities in this field. \r\n Nuclear security is an essential programme of the \r\nAgency. Ukraine commends the IAEA for its activities \r\naimed at assisting States in preventing and combating \r\nnuclear terrorism. \r\n On 12 April 2010, the President of Ukraine, \r\nViktor Yanukovych, and the President of the United \r\nStates, Barack Obama, reaffirmed in a joint statement \r\ntheir shared vision of a world free of nuclear weapons, \r\npledged to work together to prevent nuclear \r\nproliferation and to realize the goal of securing all \r\nvulnerable nuclear materials. President Yanukovych \r\nannounced Ukraine’s decision to get rid of all stocks of \r\nhighly enriched uranium by the next Nuclear Security \r\nSummit, and our partners will provide the necessary \r\ntechnical and financial assistance to support that effort. \r\n The activities related to the transportation of \r\nhighly enriched uranium from Ukrainian research \r\nreactors have already begun. We intend to remove a \r\nsubstantial part of those stocks by the end of the year. \r\nThe meaning of our voluntary step is crystal clear — \r\nUkraine takes non-proliferation seriously. We expect \r\nthat our example will serve as a pattern for others. Our \r\ndecision is also a proof of our commitment to \r\nimplementing Security Council resolution 1887 (2009). \r\n Ukraine welcomes the IAEA’s role in nuclear \r\nsecurity competence development. We pay \r\nconsiderable attention to the issue at the national level, \r\nand this year, with the graduation of 48 nuclear \r\nsecurity engineers from the Sevastopol National \r\nUniversity of Nuclear Energy and Technology, we have \r\nreached one of the important milestones. We commend \r\nthe Agency for its invaluable support to Ukraine in \r\nA/65/PV.46  \r\n \r\n10-62124 16 \r\n \r\ndeveloping training and education facilities at \r\nSevastopol National University for nuclear security \r\npurposes, and confirm our willingness to contribute to \r\nthe implementation of the IAEA nuclear security \r\neducation programme. \r\n Ukraine also appreciates the considerable \r\nactivities of the Agency to strengthen nuclear security \r\nmeasures at major public events, particularly the \r\nsupport being provided to Ukraine and Poland in \r\npreparation for the 2012 Union of European Football \r\nAssociations Championship. \r\n We recognize the importance of supporting \r\nresearch on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, \r\nespecially safety, waste management, radiation \r\nprotection, the safety and efficiency aspects of \r\nadvanced technology, as well as the importance of \r\nenhancing international cooperation in these fields. \r\nFundamental to these activities is the maintenance of \r\ncompetence and know-how across the nuclear sector. \r\nWe view positively the increase in IAEA research \r\nactivities concerning innovative reactor technologies \r\nand fuel cycles. Ukraine offers relevant expert services \r\nto the IAEA on a free-of-charge basis within the \r\nInternational Project on Innovative Nuclear Reactors \r\nand Fuel Cycles. \r\n Ukraine will continue further active cooperation \r\nwith the IAEA on the development and implementation \r\nof regional programmes addressing the issues of non-\r\npower use of nuclear technologies, namely, medical \r\napplications, dosimetry and mitigation of the \r\nconsequences of the Chernobyl catastrophe. \r\n Ukraine has always been a strong supporter of the \r\nIAEA Technical Cooperation Programme, which \r\nconstitutes an important statutory function of the \r\nAgency. Ukraine considers the implementation of the \r\nIAEA Programme to be the cornerstone of international \r\ncooperation on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. \r\n I take this opportunity to gratefully acknowledge \r\nthe work done by the IAEA in planning and \r\nimplementing technical cooperation programmes and \r\nactivities, which reflect the needs of different countries \r\nand different regions. Addressing the global challenges \r\nof hunger, disease, poverty and water resource \r\nmanagement and the creation of a cleaner and safer \r\nenvironment are of particular significance to \r\ndeveloping countries. Ukraine values the efforts of the \r\nAgency in those areas. \r\n Regional and national technical cooperation \r\nprojects have contributed significantly to the safety and \r\neffectiveness of the peaceful use of nuclear energy in \r\nUkraine. As of now, we can point to tangible and \r\nsustainable results of our cooperation, particularly \r\nregarding safety improvements at our nuclear power \r\nplants. We also highly appreciate the results already \r\nachieved in improving the quality and effectiveness of \r\nnuclear medicine, radiotherapy and medical physics. I \r\nwould particularly like to mention the modern \r\nequipment and training for nuclear oncology and \r\nradiotherapy with which we have been provided. \r\nHuman health will remain one of the priorities for our \r\ntechnical cooperation programme in future. \r\n I take this opportunity to draw the attention of \r\ndelegations to an important event for Ukraine next \r\nyear — the commemoration of the twenty-fifth \r\nanniversary of the Chernobyl catastrophe. My \r\ncountry’s strategy to address the lingering after-effects \r\nof the Chernobyl catastrophe is aimed at fostering the \r\nregion’s long-term development and providing people \r\nwith the support they need to maintain safe and healthy \r\nlives. I would like to inform the Assembly of the \r\ninitiative of the President of Ukraine, co-sponsored by \r\nBelarus and the Russian Federation, to convene an \r\ninternational conference under the theme “Twenty-five \r\nyears after the Chernobyl accident: safety for the \r\nfuture” in April 2011 in Ukraine to mark progress \r\ntowards the goal of returning to normal life and to \r\naddress the issue of the safe uses of nuclear energy. We \r\nlook forward to the broad participation of interested \r\nStates and international institutions in the conference. \r\n Ukraine, with the support of the international \r\ncommunity, is still restoring the Chernobyl site. As the \r\nmajor projects enter the construction phase, substantial \r\nsums — estimated at €750 million — will be required \r\nto complete them. International solidarity will be \r\nessential to raising the necessary funds. We count on \r\nthe support of donors and States at the upcoming \r\npledging event on that occasion to help us bring the \r\nChernobyl projects to a successful conclusion. \r\n Finally, we would like to join other delegations in \r\nwelcoming the IAEA report to the sixty-fifth session of \r\nthe General Assembly (see A/65/140) and in expressing \r\nhigh appreciation for the work of the IAEA Director \r\nGeneral and the Agency. \r\n Mr. Ruey (Singapore): The Singapore delegation \r\nwould like to thank the Director General of the \r\n A/65/PV.46\r\n \r\n17 10-62124 \r\n \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Mr. \r\nYukiya Amano, for his comprehensive annual report \r\n(see A/65/140). We are pleased to co-sponsor the draft \r\nresolution (A/65/L.10) before the Assembly today. \r\n The IAEA has played an important role in \r\npromoting the safe, secure and peaceful uses of nuclear \r\nscience and technology. Its verification activities and \r\nnuclear security programme are integral to the \r\nadvancement of nuclear disarmament and \r\nnon-proliferation. We believe that the IAEA should \r\nremain the global focal point for nuclear cooperation, \r\nin line with its three pillars of science and technology, \r\nsafety and security and safeguards and verification. \r\n There has been much movement on the nuclear \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation agenda this past \r\nyear. Amid the political commitments made, we must \r\nnot forget the practical side of the equation, which is to \r\nensure that these commitments are implemented. In \r\nthis regard, the IAEA plays a vital role by monitoring \r\nwhether progress is made, and Singapore thus \r\nwelcomes the Final Document of the 2010 Review \r\nConference of the Parties to the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). \r\n The importance of the IAEA’s role is also \r\ngrowing more evident in the context of broader trends \r\ntowards the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The Asia-\r\nPacific’s demand for energy, in particular, has \r\nincreased with the region’s rapid economic \r\ndevelopment and can only become more pronounced. \r\nThirty-four of the 55 nuclear power reactors currently \r\nunder construction are located in Asia. Singapore \r\nsupports the right of States to use nuclear energy for \r\npeaceful purposes, as guaranteed under the NPТ. \r\nHowever, we also believe that this right must be \r\nbalanced by the grave responsibility of careful \r\nconsideration of safeguards issues and full compliance \r\nwith non-proliferation obligations. In this regard, \r\nSingapore urges all States that have not done so to sign \r\nthe comprehensive safeguards agreement and the \r\nAdditional Protocol with the IAEA, so as to enhance \r\nglobal and nuclear security. \r\n States also have a responsibility to strengthen the \r\nnon-proliferation regime and should demonstrate their \r\nseriousness about this by supporting the IAEA \r\nsafeguards and verification regime. The efficacy of the \r\nIAEA ultimately depends on the participation and \r\ncooperation of member States. As we have said \r\npreviously, we call on parties to the NPT to cooperate \r\nfully with the IAEA in order to allow a conclusive \r\ndetermination of the nature of their nuclear activities. \r\nWe hope that full cooperation will be rendered to the \r\nIAEA in areas where it is lacking. \r\n Recognizing the importance of the IAEA’s work, \r\nSingapore ratified its Additional Protocol and the \r\nmodified small quantities protocol in March 2008. In \r\nAugust, we were pleased to host an IAEA workshop on \r\nadditional protocols and trade. In that month, we were \r\nhonoured to receive Director General Amano in \r\nSingapore under the Singapore International \r\nFoundation’s Distinguished Visitors programme. \r\nSingapore hopes to continue contributing actively to \r\nthe work of the IAEA as a member of the Board of \r\nGovernors for the term 2010-2012. \r\n Several countries in our region have indicated \r\nthat they either will be or are pursuing nuclear energy \r\nprogrammes. Singapore is also preparing a pre-\r\nfeasibility study to explore whether nuclear power \r\nshould be included as part of our energy mix. In this \r\nregard, we reiterate our support for greater regional \r\ncooperation to complement and strengthen \r\ninternational and national efforts in the area of nuclear \r\nsafety and security. \r\n Within the Association of Southeast Asian \r\nNations (ASEAN), we have recognized the IAEA’s role \r\nand expertise in promoting nuclear safety and security. \r\nWe also appreciate the IAEA’s participation in the \r\nASEAN Regional Forum Inter-Sessional Meeting on \r\nNon-Proliferation and Disarmament, held in Singapore \r\nin July. Among other things, forum participants agreed \r\nthat the objective of a multilateral fuel cycle was to \r\npromote the peaceful use of nuclear energy, and that \r\nthis was complementary to a global non-proliferation \r\nregime. \r\n As the issues of safety and security are important \r\nto all countries seeking nuclear power, Singapore will \r\ncontinue to work with all IAEA member States to \r\nstrengthen international and regional standards, and to \r\nstrengthen our own commitments. We have thus \r\ndecided to join the IAEA’s Illicit Trafficking Database, \r\nand are now working towards acceding to the \r\nConvention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear \r\nMaterial and its 2005 amendment. We hope that all \r\nMember States will continue working towards \r\nestablishing effective regulatory, administrative and \r\nlegislative infrastructures as they explore the option of \r\nnuclear power for generating energy. \r\nA/65/PV.46  \r\n \r\n10-62124 18 \r\n \r\n In conclusion, Singapore continues to view the \r\nrole of the IAEA as indispensable and relevant. In \r\nparticular, as more countries explore the use of nuclear \r\nenergy, we need to continue to support the Agency’s \r\nwork on the three main pillars of safeguards and \r\nverification, safety and security, and science and \r\ntechnology. As Singapore continues its work on the \r\nIAEA Board of Governors in the two years ahead, we \r\nwould like to reiterate our full support for the Agency’s \r\nrole and work, and we look forward to working with \r\nIAEA member States to advance that work. \r\n Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): At the outset, I would like to convey my \r\ngratitude to the Director General of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Mr. Yukiya Amano, \r\nfor his introduction of the Agency’s report (see \r\nA/65/140). The Russian Federation greatly values the \r\nIAEA’s work to improve and strengthen the global \r\nnon-proliferation regime and to ensure the broad and \r\nsafe use of nuclear energy. \r\n The Agency is making a substantial contribution \r\nto resolving issues relating to reliable energy supplies, \r\ncombating global climate change, and improving \r\nhuman health and well-being throughout the world. It \r\nis important that the IAEA pursue its involvement in \r\nthe interests of broadening international cooperation in \r\nthe area of peaceful uses of atomic energy. The future \r\ndevelopment of nuclear energy and its large-scale use \r\nfor economic development ends requires the united \r\nefforts of interested States in achieving a systemic \r\napproach to resolving the complex issues connected \r\nwith such activities. The IAEA must continue to \r\ndispose of all the resources and authority necessary to \r\nfulfilling its mandated activities. Russia has \r\ndemonstrated and will continue to demonstrate full \r\nsupport for the Agency’s activities, as reaffirmed \r\nduring the recent visit of the IAEA Director General to \r\nMoscow. \r\n Regarding the IAEA’s activities, we cannot fail to \r\nmention the unique nature of the Agency’s verification \r\nmechanism, which permits very effective monitoring of \r\nStates’ implementation of their non-proliferation \r\nobligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT). We believe it important \r\nthat the Agency’s monitoring capabilities continue to \r\nexpand, including by ratifying the IAEA \r\ncomprehensive safeguards agreement and its additional \r\nprotocol as universally recognized standards of \r\nverification and implementation by States of their \r\nnuclear non-proliferation obligations. \r\n Russia participates actively as a financial donor \r\nin projects to strengthen the IAEA’s safeguards system, \r\nincluding the allocation of resources to implement \r\nnational scientific and technical support programmes \r\nfor the Agency’s safeguards activity. We fully endorse \r\nthe Agency’s efforts in the area of technical \r\ncooperation and assistance to developing countries. We \r\nwelcome its large-scale efforts to assist participating \r\nStates in setting up and improving the physical \r\nprotection of nuclear materials and facilities, which \r\nundoubtedly promotes strengthened physical nuclear \r\nsecurity worldwide. We advocate the broadest possible \r\nparticipation of States in the relevant mechanisms. \r\n In the context of the large-scale development of \r\natomic energy, the Russian Federation attaches great \r\nimportance to the following issues: the development of \r\na new architecture for peaceful nuclear cooperation, \r\nbased on multilateral approaches to the nuclear fuel \r\ncycle; the guaranteed provision of nuclear fuel cycle-\r\nrelated services; and solutions to the problem of \r\ndisposing of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste. \r\n On the basis of these priorities, Russia proposed \r\nan initiative for developing a global atomic energy \r\ninfrastructure and creating international nuclear fuel \r\ncycle service centres. We are pleased to note that our \r\ninitiative has been taken up and proved to be a genuine \r\ncontribution to resolving the issues of the provision of \r\nunbiased access for all NPT-participating States to the \r\nfruits and benefits of the peaceful use of nuclear \r\nenergy, subject to the implementation in good faith of \r\nall non-proliferation commitments. It offers States an \r\nopportunity to enjoy the benefits of nuclear energy and \r\nto meet their nuclear fuel needs without creating \r\nexpensive and — from the proliferation perspective — \r\ninsecure nuclear fuel cycle elements. \r\n Within the framework of this initiative, in 2007 \r\nRussia, together with the Republic of Kazakhstan, \r\ncreated the International Uranium Enrichment Centre \r\nthrough a publicly traded company, the Angarsk \r\nElectrolytic Chemical Combine. In 2008, the Centre \r\nreceived all the necessary authorization and licences to \r\nlaunch operations as a supplier of services and \r\nmaterials. Last year, the Centre was joined by Armenia, \r\nand this August by Ukraine. A breakthrough in \r\nestablishing a new architecture for global nuclear \r\ncooperation was reached with the signing — pursuant \r\n A/65/PV.46\r\n \r\n19 10-62124 \r\n \r\nto a November 2009 decision of the IAEA’s Board of \r\nGovernors — of an agreement between Russia and the \r\nAgency on the creation on our territory of an assured \r\nbank of low-enriched uranium under the direction of \r\nthe IAEA, aimed at helping States that encounter \r\ndifficulties with nuclear fuel supplies for non-trade-\r\nrelated reasons. This project opens up the possibility of \r\nimplementing similar initiatives in order to provide \r\nconditions favourable to meeting the lawful interests of \r\nStates in developing atomic energy and simultaneously \r\nto end the duplication of sensitive nuclear technologies \r\nall over the world. \r\n I would like to emphasize that the principles for \r\nthe creation of safeguarded supplies are based on \r\narticle IX of the IAEA’s Statute. The rights of Agency \r\nmember States, including those relating to the \r\ndevelopment of their own production capacities in the \r\nnuclear fuel cycle area, are neither infringed nor \r\nrestricted. Gaining the right to receive low-enriched \r\nuranium from the assured supply does not mean having \r\nto renounce the right to creating and developing one’s \r\nown fuel cycle. The material can be supplied to any \r\nnon-nuclear State member of the IAEA that is in \r\ncompliance with its safeguards agreement and has \r\nplaced its global nuclear activity under IAEA \r\nsafeguards. \r\n One example of international cooperation \r\nsuccessfully implemented under the aegis of the \r\nAgency is the implementation of the International \r\nProject on Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel \r\nCycles, initiated by Russia. We support the efforts of \r\nthe Agency secretariat to finance the Project from its \r\nregular budget and urge all participating States to \r\nfinance it directly from assessed contributions. The \r\nRussian Federation has decided to contribute \r\n23 million roubles per annum for the years 2008-2012 \r\nfor the long-term financing of the project. \r\n Regarding regional proliferation challenges, we \r\nwelcome the practical contribution of the IAEA to \r\nfinding multilateral solutions. We pay tribute to the \r\nAgency’s efforts to implement safeguards agreements \r\nin Iran and Syria and to use its expert capacities to \r\nguarantee the sustainable operation of the nuclear non-\r\nproliferation regime. \r\n The Russian Federation sees no alternative to a \r\npolitical and diplomatic settlement with regard to the \r\nIranian nuclear programme. We hope for more active \r\ncooperation between Iran and the Agency and for the \r\nfull implementation by Tehran of Security Council and \r\nIAEA Governing Board requirements. We urge Iran to \r\nrespond constructively to the proposal to resume \r\nnegotiations with the 5+1 group, and hope that such \r\nnegotiations will begin soon. \r\n I should like to reaffirm our support for draft \r\nresolution A/65/L.10 on the report of the IAEA. As a \r\nsponsor of the draft resolution, Russia fully shares the \r\nevaluation of the importance of the Agency’s work and \r\nis convinced that it will continue to strengthen \r\ninternational security and work towards solving the \r\nissue of reliable energy supply. \r\n Mr. Kodama (Japan): At the outset, I should like \r\nto thank the Director General of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Mr. Yukiya Amano, \r\nfor presenting the annual report of the IAEA (see \r\nA/65/140). \r\n This year, the international community has \r\nembarked on a new stage of critical importance to the \r\nrealization of a world without nuclear weapons. In \r\nMay, the Review Conference of the Parties to the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \r\n(NPT) agreed on an action plan, which was \r\nincorporated into the Final Document adopted at the \r\nConference. This agreement presented us all with an \r\nopportunity to restart nuclear disarmament and \r\nnon-proliferation efforts based on the spirit of \r\ncooperative multilateralism. Japan believes that all the \r\nStates members of the IAEA should now make \r\ncombined efforts to steadily implement the action plan, \r\nin concert with the Agency. \r\n Japan is determined to be at the forefront of the \r\nefforts of the international community aimed at \r\nattaining a world without nuclear weapons. To that end, \r\nJapan co-hosted, with Australia, a foreign ministers’ \r\nmeeting on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation \r\nhere in New York in September to discuss concrete and \r\npractical measures to reduce nuclear risks in the world \r\nas an interim milestone in our endeavours to realize our \r\ncommon goal. The States that participated share this \r\npurpose, and Japan, in cooperation with those \r\ncountries, intends to lead international efforts in this \r\nregard. \r\n Japan welcomed the visit of Director General \r\nAmano to Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August, and \r\nregards it as a highly important step forward that will \r\ncontribute to the growing momentum being built \r\ntowards a world without nuclear weapons. We are \r\nA/65/PV.46  \r\n \r\n10-62124 20 \r\n \r\ngreatly looking forward to his follow-up efforts. He \r\nindicated in a symposium in Nagasaki that the Agency \r\nwill be able to contribute to nuclear disarmament in the \r\nimplementation stage. \r\n As a member of the Board of Governors since the \r\nfoundation of the Agency, Japan has worked jointly \r\nwith the Agency to promote the peaceful uses of \r\nnuclear energy, thus making a significant contribution \r\nto the Agency’s activities. Japan will make further use \r\nof the knowledge and experience that it has acquired in \r\nthe civilian uses of nuclear energy and in strengthening \r\nand improving the efficiency of the safeguards system, \r\nwith a view to assisting developing countries through \r\nthe Agency’s Technical Cooperation Programme. \r\n The IAEA has been playing an essential role in \r\nthe social and economic development of the world by \r\napplying nuclear science and technology. Japan highly \r\nappreciates this role of the Agency. In June, the \r\nGovernment of Japan made a cabinet decision on “The \r\nnew growth strategy: blueprint for revitalizing Japan”. \r\nAs one of the main pillars of this strategy, Japan will \r\nactively promote green innovation — that is, \r\ninnovation in the environment and energy sectors to \r\ncreate a low-carbon society in Japan. Japan is \r\nconvinced that nuclear energy is key to attaining stable \r\nsupply, environmental compatibility and economic \r\nefficiency at the same time, and thus to fuelling \r\ninnovation. \r\n The Nuclear Security Summit was held \r\nsuccessfully in April. Japan greatly welcomes this \r\nachievement and is now preparing for the \r\nestablishment of an integrated support centre for \r\nnuclear non-proliferation and nuclear security, to \r\nfollow up on its announcement at the Summit. Through \r\nthe activities of the centre, Japan, in cooperation with \r\nthe Agency, will contribute to meeting needs, such as \r\nthose in human resource development, for \r\nstrengthening nuclear security, especially in Asian \r\ncountries. \r\n Japan firmly believes that technical cooperation \r\nshould continue to be one of the core missions of the \r\nIAEA. Japan, taking advantage of its own long history \r\nand achievements in the application of radiation \r\ntechnology — such as medical applications, including \r\ncancer therapy — attaches importance to technical \r\ncooperation activities. Many States members of the \r\nAgency have significant needs, and Japan will continue \r\nto make technical and personnel contributions in these \r\nareas. \r\n However, the worrisome reality is that there is a \r\nshortage of human resources to support the peaceful \r\nuses of nuclear energy. While attaching importance to \r\nthe Agency’s efforts for the development of such \r\nhuman resources, Japan will contribute to those efforts, \r\nmore mindful of the utilization of its own experts in the \r\nAgency. \r\n Needless to say, strengthening and improving the \r\nefficiency of IAEA safeguards is especially vital to the \r\nenhancement of the non-proliferation regime. Japan \r\nbelieves that the most realistic and effective way to \r\nstrengthen the IAEA safeguards is the universalization \r\nof the additional protocol that more than 100 States \r\nhave concluded with the Agency. In concert with the \r\nAgency and its member States, Japan will further \r\ncontribute to the universalization of the additional \r\nprotocol through such activities as hosting the Asian \r\nSenior-level Talks on Non-Proliferation and making \r\ncontributions to the IAEA’s seminars. \r\n The North Korean nuclear question continues to \r\npose a grave threat to the peace and security of East \r\nAsia and to the international community as a whole, as \r\nwell as a serious challenge to the NPT regime. \r\nRegarding the Iranian nuclear issue, it is urgent and \r\nindispensable that Iran allay the concerns and gain the \r\nconfidence of the international community. Japan will \r\ncontinue to act, including by steadily implementing the \r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions, with a view to \r\nsettling these nuclear issues in concert with the \r\ninternational community. \r\n Today, the IAEA is expected to fully carry out its \r\ncore missions under its Statute, while facing a great \r\nnumber of important challenges vis-à-vis the national \r\nsecurity of each country and the human security of \r\neach living person. As I stated earlier, Japan will make \r\nfurther contributions to the Agency’s activities by \r\ndrawing on its knowledge and experience with regard \r\nto the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, with full \r\ninternational confidence with regard to \r\nnon-proliferation. On this occasion, Japan calls upon \r\nall States members of the Agency to give the highest \r\npriority to maximizing common interest and addressing \r\nchallenges through constructive cooperation. \r\n Mrs. Aitimova (Kazakhstan): Kazakhstan wishes \r\nto congratulate Mr. Yukiya Amano, Director General of \r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), on \r\n A/65/PV.46\r\n \r\n21 10-62124 \r\n \r\nhis very comprehensive and forward-looking report \r\n(see A/65/140). We fully endorse his vision to change \r\nthe general image of the Agency from that of simply \r\nthe world’s nuclear watchdog, with verification and \r\nsecurity functions, to that of an entity focusing on \r\nnuclear energy, nuclear applications and technical \r\ncooperation. \r\n As a member of the IAEA, Kazakhstan is proud \r\nof its record of collaboration with the Agency and will \r\ncontinue to work to strengthen it through our own \r\nnuclear energy, non-proliferation and disarmament \r\npolicies, and also by promoting those policies at the \r\nregional and global levels. My country is a major \r\nproducer of uranium ore and has the fuel fabrication \r\ncapability to further expand its involvement in the \r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy within the framework \r\nof IAEA safeguards and the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). \r\nKazakhstan collaborates with the Russian Federation in \r\nmaking its uranium available for enrichment at the \r\nInternational Uranium Enrichment Centre in Angarsk, \r\nSiberia, for use as nuclear fuel in power reactors. \r\nCurrently, we are also working on the Kurchatov \r\nNuclear Technologies Park, under the surveillance of \r\nthe IAEA. \r\n My delegation has been following with great \r\ninterest the initiative of the IAEA to develop a new \r\nframework for utilizing nuclear energy based on \r\nmultilateral approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle in \r\norder to reduce the further spread of sensitive nuclear \r\nfuel cycle technologies. We endorse the Agency’s \r\ncriteria that any mechanism devised should be non-\r\npolitical, non-discriminatory and available to all \r\nsafeguards-complying member States, so that no State \r\nshould be required to give up its rights under the NPT. \r\nThis proposal may seem difficult to realize today, but \r\nnonetheless initial efforts can be made in that direction. \r\n Kazakhstan has offered to host an IAEA nuclear \r\nfuel bank for the use of those unable to acquire \r\nsupplies of nuclear fuel on the market. We hope that \r\nthere will be a positive unified decision in the near \r\nfuture, considering that the country has voluntarily \r\nrenounced its nuclear weapons. Our national atomic \r\nenergy company, Kazatomprom, is in the process of \r\ncreating a vertically integrated establishment with a \r\ncomplete nuclear fuel cycle, in accordance with IAEA \r\nstandards. \r\n Together with Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, \r\nTurkmenistan and Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan has \r\nestablished a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central \r\nAsia, which came into force in August 2009. The zone \r\nis an additional contribution to our efforts towards a \r\nworld free of nuclear weapons and thus is an important \r\nregional confidence-building and security measure. We \r\nhave not only signed but strictly abide by the IAEA \r\nsafeguards agreements and additional protocol in an \r\nopen and transparent manner. \r\n Kazakhstan supports the establishment of a \r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East as a \r\nsolution for peace in the region, and has therefore \r\nendorsed the recommendation of the May 2010 Review \r\nConference of the Parties to the NPT that a conference \r\nbe convened in 2012. We will work collaboratively \r\nwith other member States towards its successful \r\noutcome. \r\n Kazakhstan also works rigorously to meet \r\ninternational standards regarding the security of \r\nnuclear facilities so as to reduce the risk of nuclear \r\nterrorism and the smuggling of nuclear weapons or \r\nnuclear and radioactive materials in the region. It also \r\ngives very high priority to addressing the \r\nenvironmental concerns that are unique to Central Asia \r\ndue to the fact all of the region’s five States have \r\nhosted nuclear weapons infrastructure and now \r\nconfront common ecological problems related to \r\nradiation. \r\n We consistently implement the International \r\nConvention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear \r\nTerrorism, as well as Security Council resolution 1540 \r\n(2004), in order to strengthen measures to combat the \r\nillicit trafficking of nuclear and other materials. As a \r\nmember of the Nuclear Suppliers Group and the \r\nZangger Committee, Kazakhstan maintains the strictest \r\ncontrol over its equipment and installations that enrich \r\nuranium and reprocess spent nuclear fuel. \r\n Kazakhstan conscientiously implements the \r\nrecommendations of the Nuclear Security Summit held \r\nin April in Washington, D.C., and will fully cooperate \r\nin the next security summit in Seoul in 2012. This year, \r\nmy country ratified and acceded to four major nuclear \r\nsecurity conventions and is reviewing a draft law to \r\naccede to the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for \r\nNuclear Damage. We are decommissioning the BN-350 \r\nnuclear reactor and, with the support of the United \r\nStates Department of Energy, implementing a project to \r\nA/65/PV.46  \r\n \r\n10-62124 22 \r\n \r\nconvert the second research reactor to produce radio \r\nisotopes from low-enriched uranium. My country \r\nwelcomes the proposal to strengthen the infrastructure \r\nof the IAEA Incident and Emergency Centre as the \r\nglobal focal point for international preparedness and \r\nresponse to nuclear and radiological safety or security-\r\nrelated incidents. \r\n In view of the growing importance of nuclear \r\nenergy, Kazakhstan has an agreement with the IAEA on \r\ntechnical cooperation for the years 2010-2015 to \r\ndevelop nuclear energy for nuclear education, medicine \r\nand agriculture, research reactor safety, nuclear \r\ntechnology, and radioisotope and radiation \r\napplications. We welcome the Agency’s nuclear \r\nresearch in health care, nutrition, food security and the \r\nenvironment, as well as in resource management for \r\ncollective global human security. \r\n An issue of great importance to us is that \r\nKazakhstan, though a stalwart and responsible member \r\nof the IAEA, is being denied the opportunity to \r\nparticipate in the work of elective bodies due to the \r\nexisting rules of procedure. In fully supporting the \r\nearly entry into force of the amendments to article VI \r\nof the IAEA Statute, Kazakhstan is confident that a \r\nsolution will be found so that we may participate fully \r\nin its activities. \r\n Kazakhstan is among the sponsors of draft \r\nresolution A/65/L.10, “Report of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency”, regularly contributes to the \r\nIAEA budget, makes voluntary contribution to the \r\nTechnical Cooperation Fund and stands ready to fulfil \r\nits financial obligations. \r\n As members are aware, my country closed down \r\nthe Semipalatinsk nuclear test site, the second largest \r\nin the world, on 29 August 1991. On the initiative of \r\nmy country, the General Assembly declared 29 August \r\nas the International Day Against Nuclear Tests, which \r\nis observed in countries around the world, creating \r\nawareness of the need for a world free of nuclear \r\nweapons. \r\n We share the prevailing view that the entry into \r\nforce of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty is \r\nessential to the effective functioning of the NPT. In this \r\ncontext, my delegation thanks the Agency for its \r\nparticipation in our many activities. \r\n To conclude, we extend our full support to the \r\nDirector General in addressing all aspects of the \r\nAgency’s mandate in a balanced manner in order to \r\nrespond to the varying needs and interests of member \r\nStates, and look forward to another cycle of productive \r\ncollaboration to address the global issues of nuclear \r\ntechnology. \r\n Mr. Taboul (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): I should \r\nlike at the outset to convey my gratitude to the Director \r\nGeneral of the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\n(IAEA) for his annual report to the General Assembly \r\n(see A/65/140), which includes programmes and plans \r\ndeveloped by the Agency to promote the transfer of \r\ntechnology for peaceful purposes, uphold the global \r\nnuclear safety and security regime and ensure the \r\nsafety and security of nuclear power facilities. It also \r\noutlines the greater role that the Agency continues to \r\nplay in the field of cooperation in the use of nuclear \r\nenergy for peaceful purposes and development. \r\n We take this opportunity to commend the efforts \r\nof Mr. ElBaradei and to wish every success to his \r\nsuccessor, Mr. Amano. \r\n The Sudan attaches great importance to the \r\nreport’s reference to the application of nuclear \r\ntechnology in enhancing food security, combating \r\ninsect pests and effectively managing water resources, \r\nas well as to technologies for new irrigation systems \r\nand large-scale agricultural projects. That is why the \r\nincreasing cooperation of the Agency with UNICEF in \r\nthe educational and agricultural fields, as well as with \r\nthe World Health Organization, is clearly of special \r\nimportance. \r\n Assistance to developing States in developing \r\ntheir national technologies complements the Agency’s \r\nefforts in the implementation of technical cooperation \r\nplans and projects. We hope that cooperation will be \r\ndeveloped within the framework of the Agency’s health \r\nprogrammes, including the revitalization of and \r\nsupport for regional and continental projects to combat \r\nmalaria and similar deadly diseases in Africa, and to \r\nenable the continent to achieve social and economic \r\ndevelopment, including the realization of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the \r\ninternationally agreed development agenda. \r\n The delegation of the Sudan reiterates the right of \r\nall States, including my own, to develop programmes \r\nand research and generate nuclear energy for peaceful \r\npurposes without discrimination and in line with \r\ninternational standards and terms of reference. My \r\ndelegation reiterates the need for all countries to \r\n A/65/PV.46\r\n \r\n23 10-62124 \r\n \r\nrefrain from exerting pressure on the Agency and from \r\ninterfering in its activities in order to protect its vital \r\nrole and credibility. We therefore call for more justice \r\nand equity in resolving the Agency’s problems \r\nvis-à-vis certain countries through dialogue and \r\nnegotiation. \r\n The delegation of the Sudan wishes to reiterate its \r\nfirm position of support for the aspirations of all \r\ngeographical regions to nuclear-weapon-free zones \r\npursuant to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT), one of the basic pillars of the \r\ninternational peace and security architecture. We are \r\nconcerned that the Middle East is still far from \r\nachieving this objective. It has struggled to do so for \r\ndecades because Israel, the only nuclear State in the \r\nregion, refuses to submit its nuclear programmes to the \r\nIAEA safeguards regime and continues to ignore the \r\nrepeated appeals of the international community in this \r\nregard. Israel’s commitment to implementing the NPT \r\nand its Additional Protocol is crucial to reducing \r\ntension in the region and would blaze a trail towards \r\nachieving regional security and international peace. \r\n My delegation enthusiastically hopes that the \r\nIAEA will maintain its support for the right of \r\ndeveloping countries to the peaceful use of nuclear \r\nenergy under the Agency’s full supervision. We are \r\nconvinced that nuclear energy production for peaceful \r\npurposes will achieve great results for development, \r\ngiven the cost and scarcity of other means of \r\ngenerating power. The high costs of alternative energy \r\nsources push developing countries to seek cheaper and \r\nmore efficient means. We believe that the enhanced \r\ncooperation and assistance of developed States to \r\ndeveloping States in this field and through alternative \r\nenergy sources would mitigate the dangers of resort to \r\nnuclear energy. \r\n In our view, it is logical that the Agency should \r\nprompt the developed States to cooperate with the \r\ndeveloping countries in this field. My delegation \r\ntherefore welcomes the efforts of the IAEA and all \r\ndeveloped States to strengthen cooperation with \r\nAfrican States in the peaceful use of nuclear energy in \r\nthe fields of health and medicine, along with the use of \r\nalternative energy that would contribute to the \r\nachievement of the MDGs. \r\n Ms. Anderson (United States of America): The \r\nUnited States supports the adoption of the draft \r\nresolution (A/65/L.10) on the report (see A/65/140) of \r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). As \r\nwe have done in the past, we have co-sponsored the \r\ndraft resolution to emphasize our strong support for the \r\nAgency and its invaluable role in accelerating and \r\nenlarging the contributions of atomic energy to peace, \r\nhealth and prosperity throughout the world. \r\n To that end, we look forward to continuing to \r\nwork with member States to ensure that the IAEA has \r\nthe necessary resources to address the growing array of \r\nchallenges it faces and to respond to the increasing \r\nnumber of requests for support that it receives from \r\nmember States. In addition, the United States strongly \r\ncommends the IAEA’s technical excellence and \r\nimpartiality in the conduct of its statutory treaty and \r\nadvisory duties to member States. \r\n We thank Director General Amano for his \r\nexcellent report to the General Assembly and express \r\nappreciation for the important initiatives he has \r\nundertaken in his first year at the helm of the IAEA. \r\nThe United States looks forward to continuing to work \r\nwith the Agency’s secretariat and Member States to \r\nadvance the IAEA’s work across its three pillars. \r\n Mr. Valero Briceño (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): We thank Mr. Yukiya \r\nAmano, Director General of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA), for his participation in this \r\ndebate and the presentation of the IAEA’s annual report \r\n(see A/65/140). \r\n Our country supports the work of the IAEA as a \r\nspecialized agency in verification, technical \r\ncooperation and the peaceful use of nuclear energy and \r\nin preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons. It \r\nalso appreciates the cooperation between the IAEA and \r\nits States members. We welcome the introduction of \r\nthe draft resolution entitled “Report of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency”, contained in document \r\nA/65/L.10, by Ambassador Raza Bashir Tarar of \r\nPakistan on behalf of the Chair of the Board of \r\nGovernors of the IAEA. \r\n The outcome of the International Ministerial \r\nConference on Nuclear Energy held in Beijing in April \r\nstated that nuclear energy will increasingly contribute \r\nto humankind’s future sustainable development. \r\nNuclear technology can limit the impact of human \r\ndiseases and contribute to animal health and pest \r\ncontrol. When applied to agriculture and food, nuclear \r\ntechnology can rid humankind of the adverse effects of \r\nA/65/PV.46  \r\n \r\n10-62124 24 \r\n \r\nclimate change and help with food security at the \r\nregional and global levels. \r\n The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has \r\nbenefited from the technical and financial cooperation \r\nprovided by the IAEA through various projects \r\ndeveloped in our country in recent years. Among these \r\nprojects I would highlight the strengthening of the \r\nnational regulatory infrastructure for controlling \r\nradioactive sources; the strengthening of the national \r\npreparedness and response system for radiological \r\nemergencies; the strengthening of the national \r\nregulatory infrastructure for the safe management of \r\nradioactive waste in Latin American States; and the \r\nstrengthening and upgrading of technical capacities to \r\nprotect the health and safety of workers exposed to \r\nionizing radiation. \r\n In the framework of the close cooperation \r\nbetween the IAEA and the Venezuelan Government, in \r\nMarch 2009 the former Director General of the \r\nAgency, Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei visited our country \r\nfor the first time. On that occasion, he held important \r\nmeetings with various Government ministers and the \r\nPresident of the National Assembly. He also paid a \r\nvisit to the Luis Razetti Hospital, which specializes in \r\nthe treatment of cancer. We take this opportunity to \r\nreiterate our appreciation for the work done by \r\nMr. ElBaradei as Director General of the IAEA. \r\n The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela was \r\nelected as a member of the IAEA Board of Governors \r\nfor 2009-2010. In this framework, we support the \r\nsovereign right of all States to work for the \r\ndevelopment of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, \r\nnuclear non-proliferation, disarmament and \r\nverification. Nuclear energy development represents a \r\nrational alternative to the growing demand for \r\nelectricity in Venezuela. Our country depends on \r\nhydroelectric power from the Guri Dam to produce \r\n70 per cent of this energy. Natural and climatic factors \r\naffect reservoirs and can cause serious electricity \r\ncrises, as happened recently. \r\n Furthermore, the development of nuclear energy \r\nin Venezuela will allow our country to progress \r\ntowards full energy sovereignty. It would minimize \r\ndependence on hydroelectric power and fossil fuels in \r\nparallel with the need to mitigate the negative effects \r\nof climate change. In this context, on 15 October the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela signed a cooperation \r\nagreement with the Russian Federation to develop \r\nnuclear energy for peaceful purposes in Venezuelan \r\nterritory. The agreement provides for cooperation in the \r\ndevelopment of a nuclear power programme and the \r\nconstruction and operation of a research reactor to \r\nproduce radioisotopes for peaceful uses in medicine \r\nand industry, as well as a nuclear power plant. \r\n The cooperation between Venezuela and Russia is \r\nconducted pursuant to the laws of the States parties and \r\nto international agreements to which both States are \r\nparties, in compliance with the principles of \r\nuniversally accepted international law and \r\nrecommendations of the IAEA. The agreement signed \r\nbetween Russia and Venezuela is an expression of the \r\nsovereign right of countries to develop nuclear energy \r\nfor peaceful purposes and to optimize its advantages as \r\nfuture sources of alternative energy. The completion of \r\nthis bilateral cooperation agreement is governed by the \r\nhighest principles guiding Venezuela’s international \r\npolitics, namely, independence, equality among States, \r\nself-determination and non-interference in the internal \r\naffairs of States. \r\n Based on the pacifist tradition of the Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela, our Constitution establishes our \r\nduty as Venezuelans to promote peaceful cooperation \r\namong nations and to promote nuclear disarmament. \r\nVenezuela supports the sovereign right of all States to \r\ndevelop nuclear industry for peaceful purposes, in \r\naccordance with the provisions of articles I, II and IV \r\nof the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons (NPT). Thus, Venezuela rejects any attempt \r\nto nullify the nature and scope of these provisions \r\nthrough actions that violate the integrity of the NPT. \r\n Venezuela recognizes that the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency is the sole competent authority \r\nfor verification, which must be based exclusively on \r\ntechnical and objective considerations. \r\n We continue to note with concern that a group of \r\ncountries has pursued its efforts to pressure the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran to relinquish its legitimate right to \r\ndevelop peaceful uses of nuclear industry, seek \r\ntechnological independence and diversify its energy \r\nsources. Such pressure should cease in order to open \r\nthe way to a negotiated political solution to this \r\nimpasse, which must take into account the interests of \r\nboth the Islamic Republic of Iran and of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency. \r\n The treatment of this matter in other forums that \r\nare unfamiliar with the technical nature of the IAEA \r\n A/65/PV.46\r\n \r\n25 10-62124 \r\n \r\nsafeguards system has resulted in the use of biased, \r\ndiscriminatory and subjective criteria that could affect \r\nthe authority and credibility of the Agency. My country \r\nis concerned that inappropriate practices that violate \r\nthe principle of the legal equality of States are \r\nbecoming entrenched. It is therefore necessary to \r\npromote measures to build confidence and address \r\nthese issues in a fair and balanced manner. \r\n Venezuela regrets that the State of Israel is the \r\nonly country in the Middle East that has not acceded to \r\nthe NPT or indicated its intention to do so. Israel must \r\naccede to the Treaty without further delay and submit \r\nits nuclear facilities to the IAEA safeguards regime. \r\nMy country hopes to see the establishment of a \r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. The \r\nconference to be held in 2012 will be a valuable \r\nopportunity to achieve results in this regard. The \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency has a fundamental \r\nrole to play. \r\n Mr. Kim Bonghyun (Republic of Korea): At the \r\noutset, my delegation would like to express its \r\nappreciation to Mr. Yukiya Amano, Director General of \r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for \r\nhis first annual report (see A/65/140) and statement on \r\nthe Agency’s activities and achievements over the past \r\nyear. We highly commend the Director General for \r\nhaving adeptly guided the Agency in its range of \r\nextensive activities since assuming office. We fully \r\nsupport draft resolution A/65/L.10, and would like to \r\ntake this opportunity to address several issues \r\npertaining to the report. \r\n We commend the Agency for its professionalism \r\nand impartiality in promoting the safe, secure and \r\npeaceful use of nuclear science and technology. This is \r\na vital task whose success will lead to the realization of \r\nthe IAEA’s overarching objective: the accelerated and \r\nenlarged contribution of atomic energy to peace, health \r\nand prosperity throughout the world. \r\n However, the ever-increasing demand for the \r\nexpanded use of nuclear energy poses considerable \r\nchallenges to the Agency. Today more than ever, we \r\nneed credible assurances that all nuclear materials are \r\nused solely and entirely for peaceful purposes. We are \r\nof the view that the IAEA is the sole competent \r\nauthority to verify the non-diversion of declared \r\nnuclear materials and the absence of undeclared \r\nnuclear activities and facilities. It follows, then, that \r\nthe IAEA should be equipped with the appropriate \r\nauthority as well as resources to sustain the capacity \r\nneeded for this purpose. \r\n In this context, we strongly support the \r\nuniversalization of the comprehensive safeguards \r\nagreement and its additional protocol. Together, these \r\ninstruments now constitute the contemporary standards \r\nfor ensuring confidence in States parties’ compliance \r\nwith their obligations arising from the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). My \r\ndelegation urges those States parties that have not yet \r\ndone so to conclude and bring into force the \r\ncomprehensive safeguards agreement and its additional \r\nprotocol without delay. We would also like to draw \r\nattention to the growing importance of the ratification \r\nof the revised small quantities protocol by relevant \r\nStates, in particular those introducing nuclear power. \r\n The IAEA has a unique role to carry out in \r\nsupporting member States’ efforts to establish \r\ncomprehensive national nuclear security regimes \r\nthrough capacity-building, human resource \r\ndevelopment and other forms of assistance. The \r\nNuclear Security Summit held in Washington, D.C., in \r\nApril reaffirmed the essential role of the IAEA and \r\nmobilized support for the Agency’s continued efforts to \r\nhave at its disposal the appropriate structures, \r\nresources and expertise to carry out its mandated \r\nactivities. My delegation believes that global nuclear \r\nsecurity will greatly benefit from international \r\ncooperation and that the IAEA, with its technical \r\nexpertise, can make a significant contribution to \r\nstrengthening the international security framework. \r\n The Republic of Korea, as announced on several \r\noccasions, will host the plenary meeting of the Global \r\nInitiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism and the next \r\nNuclear Security Summit in 2012. My Government \r\nwill consult closely with the IAEA and other member \r\nStates with a view to achieving productive outcomes \r\nthat contribute to international efforts in this field. \r\n The nuclear renaissance cannot be sustainable \r\nwithout a high standard of nuclear safety performance \r\nand the proper application of safety standards at all \r\nsteps of the fuel cycle. We welcome the Agency’s \r\nassistance to countries embarking on or expanding \r\ntheir existing nuclear power programmes in developing \r\nappropriate infrastructure, facilitating human capacity-\r\nbuilding and strengthening relevant regulatory systems. \r\nWe also hope that the Agency will continue to assist \r\nmember States in improving their national radiation, \r\nA/65/PV.46  \r\n \r\n10-62124 26 \r\n \r\ntransport and waste safety infrastructure and capacity-\r\nbuilding. In order to continue promoting nuclear safety \r\nlearning and cooperation on a global and regional \r\nbasis, the Republic of Korea, in cooperation with the \r\nAgency, is offering overseas training and graduate \r\ncourses in specific fields, such as site selection, design, \r\nconstruction and operation through the International \r\nNuclear Safety School of the Korea Institute of Nuclear \r\nSafety. \r\n My delegation would like to emphasize that the \r\npeaceful resolution of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea nuclear issue is vital not only to \r\nsecuring lasting peace and prosperity on the Korean \r\npeninsula and in North-East Asia, but also to \r\npreserving the integrity of the international \r\nnon-proliferation regime. \r\n We welcome the adoption of a resolution on the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea at the IAEA \r\nGeneral Conference in September, as well as the fact \r\nthat the IAEA is continuing to engage in the matter \r\ndespite the absence of Agency inspectors in Yongbyon, \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea. The 2009 \r\nannual report underlined once again that the Agency \r\nhas been unable to implement safeguards in the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea since \r\nDecember 2002 and is therefore not in a position to \r\ndraw any safeguards conclusions regarding the country. \r\n However, the absence of IAEA inspectors does \r\nnot mean that there is nothing for the Agency to do \r\nthere. On this point, we welcome the emphasis \r\nrepeatedly placed by Director General Amano on the \r\nauthority of Security Council resolutions regarding the \r\nimplementation of the Agency’s safeguards agreement \r\nwith the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. \r\nAlthough the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nis currently refusing to cooperate with the IAEA, my \r\ndelegation hopes that the Agency will be able to \r\nresume an active role in the process of denuclearizing \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. \r\n The Republic of Korea has consistently held the \r\nposition that all States that have not yet ratified or \r\nacceded to the NPT should immediately do so as \r\nnon-nuclear-weapon States in order to achieve the \r\nTreaty’s universality. The Republic of Korea is \r\ncommitted to the NPT’s goal of a world free of nuclear \r\nweapons and supports international efforts to bring \r\nabout progress in the establishment of a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zone in the Middle East. We therefore \r\nwelcome the reaffirmation at the 2010 Review \r\nConference of the Parties to the NPT of the importance \r\nof the 1995 Middle East resolution and the agreement \r\nto convene a conference in 2012 to discuss its \r\nimplementation. We hope to find the best way to \r\nsustain momentum towards the establishment of a \r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East by \r\nbuilding upon the outcome of the 2010 NPT Review \r\nConference. It is our firm belief that the IAEA, \r\nbolstered by a spirit of confidence and compromise, \r\nwill play a facilitating role in the process of \r\nestablishing the Middle East as a zone free of nuclear \r\nweapons. \r\n In conclusion, my delegation would like to \r\nreiterate its support for the work of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency and that it is pleased to \r\nco-sponsor draft resolution A/65/L.10 on the report of \r\nthe IAEA. \r\n Mr. Langeland (Norway): Norway is pleased to \r\nco-sponsor the draft resolution (A/65/L.10) on the \r\nreport of the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\n(IAEA) (see A/65/140). My Government attaches great \r\nimportance to the IAEA. Besides being a key guardian \r\nof our collective non-proliferation regime, the IAEA is \r\nan important partner in promoting social and economic \r\ndevelopment while ensuring the safety and security of \r\npeaceful nuclear programmes. Through its extensive \r\ntechnical cooperation programme, the Agency is \r\nproviding assistance to developing countries in \r\npromoting health, food security and environmental \r\nmonitoring. As such, the Agency plays an important \r\nrole in contributing to the achievement of the United \r\nNations Millennium Development Goals. \r\n Nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament are \r\nclosely linked. We cannot achieve the goal of \r\neliminating nuclear weapons, as set out by the Treaty \r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), \r\nunless there is confidence in the integrity of the \r\nnon-proliferation regime. The Final Document of the \r\n2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the NPT \r\n(NPT/CONF.2010/50 (Vol. I)) contains clear commitments \r\non both disarmament and non-proliferation. It is vital \r\nthat we provide the Agency with the legal tools \r\nnecessary to implement its non-proliferation mandate. \r\nNorway therefore reiterates its call for the \r\nuniversalization of the IAEA comprehensive \r\nsafeguards agreements and the additional protocol. It is \r\nonly through the full implementation of these two \r\ninstruments that the Agency will be able to conclude \r\n A/65/PV.46\r\n \r\n27 10-62124 \r\n \r\nthat nuclear activity in any given country is for \r\npeaceful purposes only. Norway also urges all \r\ncountries with outstanding proliferation issues to \r\ncooperate fully with the Agency in resolving these \r\nmatters and in demonstrating the entirely peaceful \r\nnature of their nuclear programmes. \r\n The NPT Review Conference also underlined the \r\nimportance of international cooperation with regard to \r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy. It should be noted that \r\nthe majority of countries around the world, including \r\nNorway, do not produce electricity from nuclear power \r\nplants. But we recognize that, as the demand for energy \r\nincreases, more countries may come to identify nuclear \r\nenergy as an attractive option. The role of the IAEA \r\nwould then become even more critical in the years to \r\ncome. \r\n Norway has made substantial voluntary \r\ncontributions in support of the IAEA’s work in \r\nstrengthening nuclear safety and security in developing \r\ncountries, and to the establishment of a nuclear fuel \r\nbank. It is imperative that we, the member States, \r\nprovide sufficient and predictable funding so that the \r\nAgency can fulfil its important mandate. Equally \r\nimportant is that the international community should \r\ndemonstrate full political support to the IAEA. My \r\ndelegation expects that the draft resolution before us \r\ntoday will be adopted by consensus. \r\n Mr. Abay (Ethiopia): Let me begin by thanking \r\nAmbassador Yukiya Amano, Director General of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for the \r\nreport (see A/65/140) he presented on the work of the \r\nAgency. My delegation would also like to express its \r\nsupport for the draft resolution (A/65/L.10) on the \r\nIAEA’s annual report. \r\n Ethiopia strongly believes that the work of the \r\nIAEA for the safe, secure and peaceful uses of nuclear \r\nscience and technology is a paramount contribution to \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. \r\nWe acknowledge that the Agency’s growing role in \r\npromoting the socio-economic development of member \r\nStates through its technical cooperation is bringing \r\ntangible progress to our efforts to reduce poverty and \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals. In this \r\nregard, my delegation would like to commend the \r\nactivities of the IAEA in assisting member States in the \r\npeaceful use of nuclear energy through the \r\ndevelopment of effective and efficient programmes \r\naimed at improving scientific, technological and \r\nregulatory capabilities. It is obvious that the IAEA’s \r\nprogramme has helped many countries meet energy \r\nneeds, improve health, combat poverty, protect the \r\nenvironment, develop agricultural sectors, manage \r\nwater resources and optimize industrial processes. \r\nHence, there is sufficient reason to believe that all \r\nthese have contributed considerable support to our \r\nefforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. \r\n My country is one of the States benefiting from \r\nthe IAEA’s activities under the Agency’s Technical \r\nCooperation Programme. Our major project with the \r\nAgency is aimed at eradicating the tsetse fly from the \r\nSouthern Rift Valley regions of Ethiopia with an \r\nintegrated pest management approach. The project is \r\ncurrently being implemented within the framework of \r\nthe Pan-African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis \r\nEradication Campaign initiative, with the support of \r\nthe African Development Bank together with the \r\nEthiopian Government. \r\n It is worth mentioning that the technical \r\ncooperation between Ethiopia and the Agency in the \r\narea of human health has also resulted in the \r\nestablishment of a modest national infrastructure for \r\nthe application of nuclear medicine and radiotherapy. \r\nOur technical cooperation with the IAEA to apply \r\nisotope techniques in managing our water resources is \r\nalso well under way. I would, however, like to call \r\nupon the Agency to continue its efforts, particularly to \r\nsupport Ethiopia and other developing countries in \r\ncombating cancer through sustainable cancer therapy \r\nprogrammes by implementing more integrated national \r\nand regional programmes. \r\n My delegation is also most appreciative to the \r\nIAEA for dedicating this year’s Scientific Forum to the \r\ntheme “Cancer in developing countries: Facing the \r\nchallenge”. We consider the Forum to be an important \r\nmedium in consolidating the global effort to address \r\nthe ever-growing problem of cancer. It is also our firm \r\nbelief that the forum will come up with relevant \r\noutcomes that will enhance the efforts of the IAEA and \r\nits member States in addressing this health hazard. \r\n We firmly believe that we must assure the \r\nAgency’s programmes of sufficient and predictable \r\nresources and, more importantly, a balanced \r\ndistribution of those resources to the Agency’s \r\nactivities relating to safeguards, nuclear safety and \r\ntechnical cooperation. Ethiopia is also of the view that \r\nthe Technical Cooperation Programme is playing a \r\nA/65/PV.46  \r\n \r\n10-62124 28 \r\n \r\ncrucial role in transferring nuclear technology to \r\ndeveloping countries. \r\n As a representative of one of the founding \r\nmembers of the Agency, I would like to reaffirm \r\nEthiopia’s commitment to the peaceful use of nuclear \r\ntechnology by respecting global and regional \r\ninstruments that are designed to control radioactive and \r\nother nuclear materials by promoting the peaceful use \r\nof nuclear applications. \r\n In conclusion, allow me to reiterate our profound \r\nappreciation to the IAEA, particularly its Board of \r\nGovernors, for its dedication to strengthening essential \r\ntechnical cooperation activities between the Agency \r\nand my country. Ethiopia will continue to do its level \r\nbest to enhance this positive spirit of cooperation with \r\nthe Agency, as well as with all the development \r\npartners that have so far made generous contributions \r\nto our development endeavours in this domain. \r\n Mr. Al Habib (Islamic Republic of Iran): Today, \r\nthe General Assembly was briefed by Mr. Yukiya \r\nAmano, Director General of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency on the Agency’s main activities for the \r\nyear 2009. His informative report (see A/65/140) \r\nindicates that the Agency is developing its activities in \r\nmany areas of nuclear technology in the interests of the \r\nhuman community. \r\n The IAEA was established with the basic purpose \r\nof accelerating and enhancing the contribution of \r\natomic energy to peace, health and development \r\nthroughout the world. The Agency has therefore a real \r\nresponsibility, now more than ever before, to assist \r\nmember States in using nuclear energy effectively and \r\nefficiently for peaceful purposes. \r\n Nuclear energy today has found an important \r\nplace in everyday human life. Today, atomic energy is \r\nwidely used in agriculture, industry and medicine, in \r\nparticular cancer treatment. The use of atomic energy \r\nand its advanced applications, especially in the field of \r\nrenewable sources of energy, has increased on a broad \r\nscale.  \r\n Despite the global economic crisis in 2009, as \r\nreported by the Agency, both energy demand and \r\ninterest in nuclear power continue to grow. The \r\nincreasing construction and operation of nuclear \r\nreactors in electricity production around the globe \r\nindicate that more and more States are pursuing nuclear \r\nenergy as a component of their energy mix in the new \r\ncentury. The new global trend towards decreasing the \r\nuse of fossil fuel and the encouragement of States to \r\nadopt clean-air policies are yet added incentives for the \r\nfurther development of nuclear energy for peaceful \r\npurposes. \r\n The essential role of the Agency in the \r\ndevelopment of activities to enhance the capacity of \r\nmember States to use nuclear energy is also \r\nacknowledged by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which in its article IV \r\nimposes an obligation on States parties to facilitate the \r\nfullest possible exchange of equipment, materials and \r\ntechnological information for peaceful purposes. \r\nFurthermore, States parties are urged to enhance their \r\ncooperation in developing nuclear energy without \r\ndiscrimination or restriction. \r\n Unfortunately, the level of cooperation with \r\ndeveloping nations on the part of the countries that are \r\nthe main suppliers of nuclear high technology has yet \r\nto be promising. Indeed, nuclear cooperation between \r\nthe suppliers and recipients has always been marked by \r\nrestriction, hindrance and disruption. Furthermore, it is \r\nan unfortunate fact that being a party to the NPT and \r\nthe IAEA safeguards agreement not only has not \r\nfacilitated the nuclear cooperation between States \r\nparties prescribed under the Treaty, but has even served \r\nto create impediments to the peaceful uses of energy. It \r\nis even true that non-parties are more richly rewarded \r\nwith nuclear cooperation than are States parties. The \r\nrecent trend of bypassing NPT obligations, particularly \r\nby the Nuclear Suppliers Group when it cooperates \r\nwith non-NPT parties, which could lead to more \r\nproliferation, is a dangerous development. \r\n In the case of Israeli clandestine nuclear \r\nactivities, which are completely outside any IAEA \r\nmonitoring, nuclear exchanges and transfers of \r\nadvanced nuclear materials, equipment and technology, \r\nfacilitated by the United States and its partners, have \r\ncontributed and continue to contribute to the \r\nproliferation activities of that regime, which is \r\nendangering global and regional peace and security. If \r\nanything, failure to accept the NPT and safeguard \r\nobligations should burden outsiders to the NPT with \r\nthe most severe restrictions, rather than provide them \r\nwith impunity. \r\n The 189 States parties to the NPT at the 2010 \r\nReview Conference, aware of the threat posed by \r\nIsrael’s secret nuclear activities, recalled the \r\n A/65/PV.46\r\n \r\n29 10-62124 \r\n \r\nreaffirmation by the 2000 NPT Review Conference of \r\nthe importance of Israel’s accession to the Treaty and \r\nthe placement of all its nuclear facilities under \r\ncomprehensive IAEA safeguards and called on that \r\nregime, the only non-party to the NPT in the Middle \r\nEast, to accede to the Treaty as a non-nuclear-weapon \r\nparty at an early date. \r\n What has been done by the IAEA on this \r\nimportant issue? The answer is disappointing. \r\n In addition, the 2010 NPT Review Conference \r\nadopted by consensus conclusions and \r\nrecommendations for follow-up actions, some of which \r\nrelate directly to the Agency’s activities. In this \r\ncontext, I would like to recall that the Conference \r\ncalled for continued efforts within the IAEA to enhance \r\nthe effectiveness and efficiency of its Technical \r\nCooperation Programme; to strengthen the \r\nProgramme’s capacity to assist developing States \r\nparties in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy; and to \r\ntake practical steps to ensure that IAEA resources for \r\ntechnical cooperation activities are sufficient, assured \r\nand predictable. In today’s presentation by the Agency, \r\nwe expected to hear the Agency’s future plans on such \r\nimportant issues. \r\n One of the neglected tasks of the IAEA involves \r\nits involvement in the nuclear disarmament process. \r\nThe IAEA Statute stipulates that the Agency should \r\nconduct its activities “furthering the establishment of \r\nsafeguarded worldwide disarmament”. The 2010 NPT \r\nReview Conference adopted, however insufficiently, \r\ncertain actions in this regard. For instance, the \r\nConference resolved that the nuclear-weapon States \r\nwould commit to declaring to the IAEA all fissile \r\nmaterial designated by each of them as no longer \r\nrequired for military purposes; to placing such material \r\nas soon as practicable under IAEA or other relevant \r\ninternational verification; to arranging for the \r\ndisposition of such material for peaceful purposes; and \r\nto ensuring that such material remains permanently \r\noutside military programmes. \r\n In this context, all States were encouraged by the \r\nConference to support the development of appropriate \r\nlegally binding verification arrangements within the \r\ncontext of the IAEA in order to ensure the irreversible \r\nremoval of fissile material designated by each nuclear-\r\nweapon State as no longer required for military \r\npurposes. The Conference also called for the wider \r\napplication of safeguards to peaceful nuclear facilities \r\nin the nuclear-weapon States. \r\n The question now is: What is the Agency’s plan \r\nin this important area? It is obvious that the Agency \r\nneeds to be more active in that regard. \r\n In conclusion, since reference was made to Iran’s \r\npeaceful programme, I would like to point out the \r\nfollowing. While all of the IAEA reports repeatedly \r\nconfirm that the Agency continues to verify the \r\nnon-diversion of declared nuclear material in Iran, it \r\nseems that the Agency’s recent reports have been \r\nprepared under pressure from outside, using unusual \r\nlanguage with regard to the safeguards obligations. The \r\nAgency has to basically confirm that it has already \r\nverified non-diversion of the declared nuclear material; \r\nthat all declared nuclear material is accounted for and \r\ncontinues to be used for peaceful purposes, as already \r\nreported by the Agency’s inspectors; and that that has \r\nalways been the case over the past several years. \r\n Reporting so much technical detail about Iran’s \r\npeaceful nuclear activities proves that the Agency has \r\nfull access to all nuclear material and facilities in the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran, including through frequent \r\ninspections through the Agency’s containment and \r\nsurveillance efforts. Therefore, claiming that Iran has \r\nnot provided the necessary cooperation is incorrect and \r\nmisleading. It has to be noted that additional requests \r\nare beyond the provisions of the NPT comprehensive \r\nsafeguards and that they have been made under the \r\npretext of illegal resolutions of the Security Council. \r\n As a last point, I should reiterate that the people \r\nand Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran are \r\ndetermined to exercise their inalienable right to nuclear \r\ntechnology for peaceful purposes and to build on their \r\nown scientific advances in developing various peaceful \r\naspects of this technology, including the fuel cycle. \r\nIran is steadfast in its commitment to its obligations \r\nunder the NPT and does not request anything more \r\nthan being allowed to exercise its inalienable rights. \r\n In the meantime, we have always declared our \r\nreadiness for talks based on justice and mutual respect. \r\nJust recently, Iran welcomed the return of the 5+1 \r\ngroup to the talks. In a reply letter from the Head of the \r\nOffice of the Secretary of the Supreme National \r\nSecurity Council of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the \r\nwillingness of the 5+1 group to return to the talks with \r\nIran was acknowledged and appreciated. In that letter, \r\nthe desire to resume talks on the basis of Mr. Jalili’s \r\nA/65/PV.46  \r\n \r\n10-62124 30 \r\n \r\nletter to Ms. Ashton, dated 6 July 2010, from \r\n10 November 2010 on and in a place and on a date \r\nconvenient to both sides, was reiterated. We are \r\nwaiting to see the other parties demonstrate their \r\ngoodwill and real intention to engage in meaningful \r\nand successful talks. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on this item. \r\n We shall now proceed to consider draft resolution \r\nA/65/L.10. \r\n Before giving the floor to the speaker in \r\nexplanation of vote before the voting, may I remind \r\ndelegations that explanations of vote are limited to \r\n10 minutes and should be made by delegations from \r\ntheir seats. \r\n Mr. Kim Yong Jo (Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea): The delegation of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea would like to explain its position on \r\ndraft resolution A/65/L.10, entitled “Report of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency”. \r\n The report of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (IAEA) (see A/65/140) and IAEA General \r\nConference resolution GC(54)/RES/12 of September \r\n2010 show that the IAEA persists in its unfair attitude \r\ntowards the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula. As \r\nalready clarified in so many cases and on so many \r\noccasions, the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula is \r\nthe direct outcome of the hostile nuclear threat policies \r\nof the United States against the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea. For the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea, the nuclear threat goes beyond \r\nabstract notions to practical experiences. The nuclear \r\nissue was created by the introduction of nuclear \r\nweapons into the Korean peninsula by the United \r\nStates in the late 1950s. Its nuclear threat against the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea lasted for more \r\nthan a half century. \r\n As everybody knows well, no conventional \r\nweapon represents a deterrence to any kind of nuclear \r\nthreat from a third party. The nuclear threat from the \r\nUnited States has, in a word, resulted in the creation of \r\nour nuclear deterrence. \r\n In order to revive the process of the \r\ndenuclearization of the Korean peninsula, what is most \r\nimportant is to build confidence between both sides — \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the \r\nUnited States, which are the main parties to the nuclear \r\nissue on the Korean peninsula. Confidence-building \r\nbetween both sides — the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea and the United States — is urgent as \r\nit has become the master key to addressing the present \r\nissue. \r\n To this end, first of all, a peace treaty aimed at \r\nputting an end to the state of ceasefire between the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and the United \r\nStates should be concluded, if possible, as soon as \r\npossible. The conclusion of a peace treaty is the best \r\nway to realize the denuclearization of the Korean \r\npeninsula. If durable peace mechanisms had been set \r\nup earlier on the Korean peninsula, neither the nuclear \r\nnor the denuclearization issue would have arisen. The \r\nconclusion of peace treaties will certainly help to ease \r\nthe present confrontations between the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea and the United States and \r\naccelerate the process of the denuclearization of the \r\nKorean peninsula. \r\n As long as the IAEA continues either to take \r\nmeasures or to adopt resolutions that take up the issues \r\nfrom only one side, while unfairly turning its face from \r\nthe real nature of the issues, it will never resolve the \r\nnuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. Proceeding \r\nfrom this point of view, the delegation of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea strongly \r\nopposes resolution GC(54)/RES/12 concerning the \r\nnuclear issue of the Korea peninsula, adopted at the \r\nGeneral Conference of the IAEA on 24 September. \r\n With regard to the argument of Japan and South \r\nKorea concerning the nuclear issue on the Korean \r\npeninsula, the delegation of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea totally rejects in strong terms their \r\nallegations because they are entirely based on their \r\nintentional misunderstanding and neglect of the root \r\ncause of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. \r\n The Acting President: We have heard the only \r\nspeaker in explanation of vote before the vote. \r\n The Assembly will now take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/65/L.10. \r\n I should like to announce that, since the \r\nintroduction of the draft resolution, Georgia and the \r\nRepublic of Zambia have become sponsors. \r\n May I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt \r\ndraft resolution A/65/L.10? \r\n A/65/PV.46\r\n \r\n31 10-62124 \r\n \r\n Draft resolution A/65/L.10 was adopted \r\n(resolution 65/9). \r\n The Acting President: May I take it that it is the \r\nwish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 87? \r\n It was so decided. \r\n \r\nProgramme of work \r\n \r\n The Acting President (spoke in French): Before \r\nadjourning the meeting, I would like to inform Member \r\nStates that consideration of agenda item 69, entitled \r\n“Strengthening of the coordination of humanitarian and  \r\n \r\ndisaster relief assistance of the United Nations, \r\nincluding special economic assistance”, and its \r\nsub-items (a) to (d), which was scheduled for Monday, \r\n15 November 2010, has been postponed to a later date \r\nto be announced. \r\n Also, the specific meeting focused on \r\ndevelopment, under agenda item 115, entitled “Follow-\r\nup to the outcome of the Millennium Summit”, which \r\nwas scheduled to take place on Monday, 22 November \r\n2010, has been postponed to a date in the resumed \r\nsession, to be announced. \r\n  The meeting rose at 1.20 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
