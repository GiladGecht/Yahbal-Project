I am happy to welcome \r\nthe President of the Security Council, His Excellency \r\nSir Mark Lyall Grant, who will shortly present to us the \r\nSecurity Council report (A/65/2). That report is one of \r\nthe important instruments of interaction between the \r\nCouncil and the Assembly. It is therefore essential that \r\nit should serve as the basis for a substantive debate. \r\n Our meeting today is an opportunity for us to \r\nstudy the progress and the challenges confronting the \r\nCouncil, as well as to reflect on the strengthening of \r\ncooperation between the General Assembly and the \r\nSecurity Council, so that together those two bodies \r\nmay be even better able to promote the values and \r\nprinciples of the United Nations. Regular, close contact \r\nbetween the Presidents of the General Assembly and \r\nthe Security Council also constitutes another \r\ninstrument. Since taking office, I have met all the \r\nPresidents of the Security Council and will continue to \r\ndo so. I am grateful to them for the substantive \r\ndiscussions we have had. The recent adoption by both \r\nbodies of a resolution concerning the review of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission (General Assembly \r\nresolution 65/7 and Security Council resolution 1947 \r\nA/65/PV.48  \r\n \r\n10-63228 2 \r\n \r\n(2010)) has also shown us the benefits of such \r\ncooperation. \r\n In recent years there has been positive movement \r\ntowards greater transparency in the Security Council, \r\nand it is important that those efforts continue. That \r\nleads me to make a few remarks on the second item we \r\nwill discuss today: Security Council reform. This is an \r\nessential part of reaffirming the central role of the \r\nUnited Nations in global governance. In that regard, I \r\nwould like to stress that almost the entire world agrees \r\nthat we need to adapt to the changes that have taken \r\nplace in the world since 1945. \r\n That is why I convened a preliminary informal \r\nmeeting on 21 October, once I had confirmed \r\nAmbassador Tanin in his role as Chair of \r\nIntergovernmental Negotiations. It is essential to build \r\non existing convergences and to narrow differences of \r\nopinion in order to reach more tangible results. \r\n I have therefore asked Ambassador Tanin to \r\ncontinue his work on the text that has emerged from \r\nthe second revision by holding open and transparent \r\nconsultations. I call on all Member States to support \r\nhim in his work. \r\n At the beginning of the year, we will take stock \r\nand consult the Assembly on the follow-up on the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations process. \r\n It must be very clear that the solution is in the \r\nAssembly’s hands. It is Member States’ determination \r\nto make something of that process that will lead to \r\nprogress being made. It is therefore essential to \r\ndemonstrate flexibility, willingness to compromise, \r\ngood faith, creativity and mutual respect in an \r\natmosphere that is transparent and inclusive. \r\n Both Ambassador Tanin and I are at the \r\nAssembly’s service to support it in its effort to find a \r\nsolution that enjoys widespread support. However, that \r\neffort is the Assembly’s responsibility. I welcome the \r\nAssembly’s views on the agenda items and hope that \r\nour discussion will allow us to make progress. \r\n I now give the floor to the President of the \r\nSecurity Council, His Excellency Sir Mark Lyall Grant, \r\nto introduce the report of the Security Council. \r\n Sir Mark Lyall Grant (United Kingdom): \r\nMr. President, on behalf of the members of the Security \r\nCouncil, I would like to congratulate you on your \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-fifth session. As President of the General \r\nAssembly, Sir, you have a key role to play in working \r\nwith the Security Council to enhance and strengthen \r\nthe relationship between those two important organs of \r\nthe United Nations. \r\n In my capacity as President of the Security \r\nCouncil for November, it is my honour to introduce the \r\nannual report of the Council to the General Assembly \r\nas contained in document A/65/2. The report covers the \r\nperiod from August 2009 to July 2010. The \r\nintroduction to the report was prepared by the \r\ndelegation of Nigeria, which held the Council’s \r\npresidency in July. On behalf of the Security Council, I \r\nwish to thank Ambassador Ogwu and her team for their \r\nefforts. I would also like to thank the Secretariat, \r\nwhich prepared the second part of the report. \r\n There is always room for improving the report. I \r\nwould be happy to pass back any feedback from the \r\nGeneral Assembly today to the Security Council. \r\nTransparency in the Council’s work is a frequent \r\nrequest of the wider membership. That is why the \r\nSecurity Council holds as many open meetings as \r\npossible and why it supports the live broadcast of its \r\nmeetings on the Internet. Another tool to increase \r\ntransparency is the regular meetings between the \r\nPresidents of the General Assembly and the Security \r\nCouncil, which provide a valuable link between the \r\nCouncil and the wider membership. We also urge \r\nMember States to take full advantage of the regular \r\nbriefings by the Security Council during the course of \r\nthe year, which provide details of the Council’s \r\ndiscussions on issues of the day. \r\n The Security Council has adopted other measures \r\nto increase transparency in its work in the recent past \r\nand will consider ways to do it further in the future. I \r\nwould draw attention to the adoption of a new \r\npresidential note adopted by the Council on its working \r\nmethods (S/2010/507), which is aimed at enhancing \r\ntransparency, interaction with non-Council members \r\nand efficiency. That note takes into account many of \r\nthe views expressed by Member States during the open \r\ndebate on the Council’s working methods in April (see \r\nS/PV.6300). \r\n Some long-running situations, including in the \r\nMiddle East, Cyprus and Western Sahara, remain \r\nunresolved, as do issues in which the Council has \r\nbecome engaged in recent years, including Nepal and \r\nGuinea-Bissau. Huge challenges remain in the Sudan, \r\n A/65/PV.48\r\n \r\n3 10-63228 \r\n \r\nSomalia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. \r\nBut there have been some successes, and the Council \r\nhas worked to make progress across the board in what \r\nhas been a busy year. I would like to touch on those \r\nsituations in more detail today. \r\n Over the past year, the Council has maintained a \r\nstrong thematic focus in much of its work. Those \r\nthemes are now well established on the Council’s \r\nagenda: conflict prevention and peacekeeping, \r\nprotection of civilians, children and armed conflict, \r\nwomen and peace and security, and relations with \r\nregional organizations. \r\n The tenth anniversary in October of resolution \r\n1325 (2000) on women and peace and security was a \r\nlandmark event. The Council adopted a presidential \r\nstatement that supported taking forward a set of \r\nindicators as a framework to track the implementation \r\nof resolution 1325 (2000) in situations of armed \r\nconflict, post-conflict and other relevant situations \r\n(S/PRST/2010/22), which was a significant step \r\nforward and an important signal that more progress \r\nneeds to be made to mainstream those ideas. There will \r\nbe a high-level review of the implementation of \r\nresolution 1325 (2000) in five years’ time. \r\n Overall, there has been significant progress over \r\nthe past couple of years in the Council’s thematic \r\nwork. The challenge now is to translate the thematic \r\nresolutions into real actions on the ground. \r\n Conflict prevention remains a key focus for the \r\nSecurity Council. Council members believe that the \r\nCouncil, working with the United Nations as a whole, \r\nmust work more effectively to help prevent the \r\noutbreak of violent conflict and not be confined merely \r\nto responding after the event. Preventing conflict is, \r\nfirst and foremost, the responsibility of each national \r\nGovernment, but we must continue to ensure that the \r\nSecurity Council has access to early warning \r\nanalysis — we have made some improvements in that \r\nregard in the past year — and that we are also able and \r\nwilling to take decisions on the basis of that analysis, \r\nwhich can help prevent violent conflict. We should also \r\nsupport strong and capable machinery for United \r\nNations mediation and preventive diplomacy and \r\nensure that our collective efforts to support social and \r\neconomic development can lessen the potential for \r\npeople to resort to violence in redressing their \r\ngrievances. \r\n The Security Council has intensified its efforts to \r\nconduct a transparent and inclusive dialogue aimed at \r\ndeveloping more effective United Nations \r\npeacekeeping. In a series of formal and informal \r\ndebates among peacekeeping stakeholders, the Council \r\nhas worked to build consensus towards substantial \r\nreform. Over the coming year, the Council will \r\ncontinue to engage constructively with the troop- and \r\npolice-contributing countries, regional organizations \r\nand non-governmental organizations and civilian and \r\nmilitary leaders from field missions. The Security \r\nCouncil Working Group of the Whole on United \r\nNations Peacekeeping Operations has brought Council \r\nmembers together with troop- and police-contributing \r\ncountries informally to discuss both cross-cutting and \r\nmission-specific peacekeeping issues. There have been \r\nimportant contributions from the Secretariat, from the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly, from the \r\nCommittee of 34, i.e. the Special Committee on \r\nPeacekeeping Operations, and from the Fifth \r\nCommittee, which have worked in parallel and together \r\nto form the United Nations peacekeeping partnership. \r\n The Security Council has welcomed the report \r\npresented by the co-facilitators on the review of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission (PBC), which aims at \r\ndelivering better results on the ground and improving \r\nthe work of the Commission. The Council supports the \r\nwork of the Commission and is willing to make greater \r\nuse of its advisory role. It is important that the \r\nCommission now take up the challenge by helping to \r\nremove obstacles to peace, such as by promoting \r\nprogress in security sector reform in Guinea-Bissau; \r\npromoting reintegration of former combatants in \r\nBurundi; completing a comprehensive disarmament, \r\ndemobilization and reintegration programme in the \r\nCentral African Republic; helping to build institutional \r\ncapacity in Sierra Leone; and strengthening the rule of \r\nlaw in Liberia. \r\n The Council’s work on peace and security \r\ncontinues to depend on the effectiveness of measures \r\ntaken under various sanctions regimes. Significant \r\nadvances in both the policy and practice of sanctions \r\nregimes were achieved in the past year. They include \r\nthe adoption of more detailed and precise Security \r\nCouncil resolutions containing more targeted measures, \r\nand fairer and clearer procedures for listing and \r\ndelisting. In particular, the appointment of an \r\nombudsperson for the Security Council sanctions \r\ncommittee established pursuant to resolution 1267 \r\nA/65/PV.48  \r\n \r\n10-63228 4 \r\n \r\n(1999) regarding Al Qaida and the Taliban is a \r\nsignificant and welcome development. However, there \r\nremain challenges. For example, there should be better \r\ncoordination and information-sharing among States, \r\nand between States and the various sanctions \r\ncommittees. \r\n In addition to the work of the sanctions regimes, \r\nthe Security Council has also actively worked towards \r\ninternational security through its non-proliferation \r\nefforts. They include the adoption of resolution 1887 \r\n(2009), which addressed the issues of nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation and nuclear disarmament, and the \r\nongoing work of the Security Council Committee \r\nestablished pursuant to resolution 1540 (2004). That \r\nwork includes a comprehensive review of the status of \r\nthe implementation of resolution 1540 (2004), and \r\nimproved transparency and technical assistance \r\ncoordination. \r\n The Counter-Terrorism Committee also continued \r\nits core work on assessing States’ implementation of \r\nresolutions 1373 (2001) and 1624 (2005) and \r\nfacilitating assistance where needed. It improved its \r\noutreach and transparency by increasing its open \r\nthematic briefings. \r\n The Council’s annual report illustrates the range \r\nof geographical issues that were considered in the \r\nreporting period. I would like to draw attention to a \r\nfew particular cases that will continue to occupy the \r\nCouncil in the coming year. \r\n We can expect the situation in the Sudan to \r\ncontinue to occupy the Security Council in the year \r\nahead. The increased rhythm of Council engagement \r\non the Sudan issue in 2009 and 2010 demonstrated the \r\nCouncil’s commitment both to the Sudan and to \r\nconflict prevention. Whatever the outcome of the \r\nreferendums on the status of Southern Sudan and \r\nAbyei, the Security Council will have a continuing \r\ninterest in the peace and prosperity of all Sudanese \r\npeople. \r\n The Council has also followed developments in \r\nDarfur closely, including the security and humanitarian \r\nsituation, and the Doha peace process, which the \r\nCouncil has called on all rebel groups to join without \r\nfurther delay and without preconditions. The Council \r\nvisited the Sudan in October, and will continue to \r\nmonitor the work of its two peacekeeping missions in \r\nthe Sudan, the United Nations Mission in the Sudan \r\nand the African Union-United Nations Hybrid \r\nOperation in Darfur. \r\n Somalia is one of the most complex challenges \r\nfacing the Council today, and will likely be an even \r\nbigger issue in 2011. Progress will require enhanced \r\ndialogue and cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand the African Union (AU). More broadly, the United \r\nNations relationship with the African Union, including \r\nthe Security Council’s relationship with the AU Peace \r\nand Security Council, needs to be placed on a more \r\nstrategic footing, as that relationship will be critical for \r\npeace and security in Africa. \r\n The situation in the Middle East remains a \r\npriority for the Security Council. In June, the Council \r\nissued a statement following the tragic Gaza flotilla \r\nincident (S/PRST/2010/9), and in August welcomed the \r\nestablishment by the Secretary-General of the Panel of \r\nInquiry. Council members have consistently agreed on \r\nthe need for a negotiated peace in the Middle East, \r\nleading to a two-State solution. Looking ahead, the \r\nSecurity Council will want to see substantive progress \r\ntowards a comprehensive peace in the Middle East. \r\nCouncil members will continue to discuss and assess \r\nthe situation in the Middle East on a regular basis. \r\n The Security Council carried out a number of \r\nmissions during the year. In May it visited the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo to discuss the future \r\nof United Nations engagement in that country, with \r\nparticular reference to the mandate for the \r\npeacekeeping mission and the reconfiguration of the \r\nUnited Nations Organization Mission in the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo to the United \r\nNations Organization Stabilization Mission in the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. \r\n In June, the Security Council visited Afghanistan, \r\nwhere it met President Karzai, his ministerial team, \r\nmembers of the opposition, parliamentarians and civil \r\nsociety. The Council saw at first-hand the excellent \r\nwork of the United Nations Assistance Mission in \r\nAfghanistan (UNAMA) team — and Special \r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General Staffan de \r\nMistura in particular — in delivering their mandate and \r\ncoordinating the overall civilian effort. The visit \r\nunderlined both the scale of the task in Afghanistan and \r\nthe Security Council’s commitment to Afghanistan’s \r\nfuture. In the year ahead, the Security Council will \r\ncontinue to offer UNAMA its full support and will \r\nencourage UNAMA’s leadership in aid coherence and \r\n A/65/PV.48\r\n \r\n5 10-63228 \r\n \r\nstrengthening its ties with the International Security \r\nAssistance Force in order to support security transition, \r\npolitical outreach, and supporting the Government of \r\nAfghanistan in implementing electoral reform. \r\n These are just a few of the issues that the Security \r\nCouncil has covered in the reporting period. It has \r\nexamined many other situations on the ground, from \r\nHaiti to Chad, and from Timor-Leste to Iraq. On behalf \r\nof all Security Council members, I should like to thank \r\nthe members of the General Assembly for this \r\nopportunity to introduce the report. I would also like to \r\nexpress the Security Council’s appreciation for the \r\nwork of the Secretary-General and the Secretariat, with \r\nwhom it works very closely, and whose cooperation \r\nand assistance is invaluable in helping the Council to \r\nfulfil its mandate. \r\n Mr. Abdelaziz (Egypt): I have the honour to \r\nspeak today on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement. \r\n At the outset, I would like to express the \r\nMovement’s appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Ali \r\nAbdussalam Treki, President of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-fourth session, for his efforts in advancing \r\nthe important issue of Security Council reform. I would \r\nalso like to congratulate you, Sir, for including this \r\nissue among your priorities for the sixty-fifth session, \r\nand for reaffirming confidence in His Excellency \r\nAmbassador Zahir Tanin, Permanent Representative of \r\nAfghanistan to the United Nations, in continuing to \r\nserve as Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations on \r\nSecurity Council reform, in order to achieve maximum \r\nprogress during the sixty-fifth session. \r\n The Movement also commends you, \r\nMr. President, for choosing “Reaffirming the central \r\nrole of the United Nations in global governance” as the \r\ncentral theme of the Assembly’s sixty-fifth session. \r\nThat noble objective can only be achieved through \r\nworking on the delicate balance in the Charter between \r\nthe principal organs of the United Nations, revitalizing \r\nthe work of the General Assembly, and reforming and \r\nexpanding the Security Council. \r\n The Non-Aligned Movement attaches great \r\nimportance to achieving concrete results on Security \r\nCouncil reform through intergovernmental negotiations \r\nand in accordance with General Assembly decision \r\n62/557 and subsequent decisions 63/565 and 64/568. In \r\nthat regard, the Movement’s position is clearly \r\nreflected in section E of the Sharm el-Sheikh Final \r\nDocument (A/63/965, annex), adopted by the fifteenth \r\nSummit Conference of Heads of State and Government \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement. \r\n The Movement believes that the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council should be addressed in a \r\ncomprehensive, transparent and balanced manner, in \r\norder to reflect the needs and interests of both \r\ndeveloping and developed countries alike. Reform \r\nshould also aim at limiting and curtailing the use of the \r\nveto with a view to its ultimate elimination. The \r\nenlargement of the Security Council, as the body \r\nprimarily responsible for the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security, as well as the reform \r\nof its working methods, should lead to a more \r\ndemocratic, more representative, more accountable and \r\nmore effective Council. \r\n In that context, the heads of State and \r\nGovernment of the Non-Aligned Movement \r\nacknowledged the historical injustices against Africa \r\nwith regard to its representation in the Security Council \r\nand expressed support for increased and enhanced \r\nrepresentation of the African continent in a reformed \r\nSecurity Council. Moreover, they took note of the \r\ncommon African position as reflected in the Ezulwini \r\nConsensus and the Sirte Declaration. \r\n Improving the working methods of the Security \r\nCouncil is of great importance to the Movement, as \r\nreflected in the relevant paragraphs of the Final \r\nDocument of the fifteenth Summit of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement and in several initiatives presented by the \r\nMovement throughout the years since the Security \r\nCouncil reform process was launched. Those initiatives \r\ninclude and are not limited to the comprehensive \r\nnegotiating paper submitted by the Movement in 1996, \r\nas contained in the report of the Open-ended Working \r\nGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation on \r\nand Increase in the Membership of the Security \r\nCouncil and Other Matters related to the Security \r\nCouncil (A/51/47). \r\n Transparency, openness and consistency are key \r\nelements that the Security Council should demonstrate \r\nin all its activities, approaches and procedures. The \r\nrules of procedure of the Security Council, which have \r\nremained provisional for more than 60 years, should be \r\nformalized in order to improve the Council’s \r\ntransparency and accountability. Moreover, the \r\nMovement rejects any attempts to use the Council to \r\npursue national political agendas and stresses the \r\nA/65/PV.48  \r\n \r\n10-63228 6 \r\n \r\nnecessity of non-selectivity and impartiality in its \r\nwork. \r\n In that regard, there is an urgent need for the \r\nSecurity Council to adhere to the powers and functions \r\naccorded to it by the Member States under the United \r\nNations Charter. The Council should therefore stop \r\nencroaching on the functions and powers of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil by addressing issues that traditionally fall \r\nwithin the competence of those organs. The Security \r\nCouncil should also avoid resorting to Chapter VII of \r\nthe Charter as an umbrella for addressing the issues \r\nthat do not necessarily pose a threat to international \r\npeace and security. It should, rather, fully utilize the \r\nprovisions of other relevant chapters, where \r\nappropriate, including Chapters VI and VIII, before \r\ninvoking Chapter VII, which should be the authority of \r\nlast resort. \r\n Security Council-imposed sanctions remain an \r\nissue of serious concern to the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement. The use of sanctions raises fundamental \r\nethical questions as to whether sufferings inflicted on \r\nvulnerable groups in a targeted country are a legitimate \r\nmeans of exerting pressure. In that regard, the \r\nobjectives of sanctions regimes should be clearly \r\ndefined, and their imposition should be for a specific \r\ntime frame and be based on tenable legal grounds and \r\nshould be lifted as soon as the objectives are achieved. \r\nThe conditions demanded of the State or party on \r\nwhich sanctions are imposed should be clearly defined \r\nand subject to periodic review. \r\n Last year, the Non-Aligned Movement noted that \r\nthe annual report of the Security Council continued to \r\nbe a procedural overview of the Council meetings, \r\nactivities and decisions. Examining this year’s report, \r\nwe believe that there is a room for further improvement \r\nin the report to reflect the Council’s challenges, \r\nassessments, rationales and the decision-making \r\nprocesses followed in each of the cases covered within \r\nthe reporting period. \r\n In our view, the report should provide more \r\nexplanations of the positions on the different issues \r\nconsidered in the Council, including cases in which the \r\nCouncil failed to act, particularly those relating to \r\ninternational peace and security. It should also set forth \r\nthe reasons behind the different outcomes emanating \r\nfrom the Council, be they resolutions, presidential \r\nstatements, press releases or statements to the press. \r\n In addition, the Council should submit special \r\nreports for consideration by the General Assembly, in \r\naccordance with Article 15, paragraph 1, and Article \r\n24, paragraph 3, of the United Nations Charter. \r\nFurthermore, it is vital that regular interactions \r\nbetween the presidency of the Security Council and the \r\nwider membership of the United Nations during the \r\npreparation process of the Council’s annual reports be \r\nmaintained, which could contribute to enhancing the \r\nquality of the reports. \r\n I would like to say a few words more in my \r\nnational capacity. I associate my remarks with the \r\nstatement to be delivered by the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Sierra Leone on behalf of the African \r\nGroup. \r\n Egypt is keen to achieve tangible progress and \r\nreach concrete results in the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on the Security Council reform based on \r\ndecision 62/557. Paragraph (d) of that decision clearly \r\nstipulates that the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nshould be based on proposals submitted by Member \r\nStates. The rationale is to preserve the \r\nintergovernmental nature of the process and avoid \r\njeopardizing the neutrality and impartiality of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly and the Chair of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, especially since the \r\nmain objective of the negotiations is to ensure the \r\nwidest possible political acceptance by the Member \r\nStates themselves. \r\n The five key issues of our intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations have been clearly defined in \r\nparagraph (e) (ii) of decision 62/557. They remain \r\ninextricably linked and constitute an integral, \r\ninseparable package that has to be agreed upon \r\ntogether. Accordingly, any agreement should be based \r\non full consideration of all those issues without \r\nattempting to classify them into issues that constitute a \r\npoint of convergence and issues that constitute a point \r\nof divergence, or attempting to avoid the most difficult \r\nissues and reach agreement on easy issues that could \r\nhave been agreed years ago. We are not looking for just \r\nany agreement; rather, we are looking for an agreement \r\nthat would have the desired effect on the power \r\nstructure in the Security Council, which simply \r\nrequires that we concentrate on reaching agreement on \r\nthe easiest and most difficult topics at the same time. \r\n Egypt, along with the African Group, continues to \r\nbelieve that States and groups of States should agree \r\n A/65/PV.48\r\n \r\n7 10-63228 \r\n \r\nfirst on principles, substance, terms and criteria before \r\nembarking on any drafting exercise. They should also \r\nagree on the form of that drafting exercise, whether it \r\nseeks to compile only certain specific proposals \r\npresented in past rounds of intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations or all of them together. That agreement on \r\nprinciples should include an institutional agreement on \r\nways and means to rectify the serious historical \r\ninjustice to Africa as the only continent not represented \r\nin the category of permanent membership of the \r\nSecurity Council and not adequately represented in the \r\nnon-permanent category. Mere reference to increasing \r\nAfrican representation without providing details is \r\nsimply not enough. \r\n Egypt reiterates once again the validity and \r\nstrength of the common African position represented in \r\nthe Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration. \r\nLimiting the expansion of the Security Council to the \r\nnon-permanent category alone is not an option for us, \r\nas it will neither change the power structure of the \r\nCouncil nor correct the historical injustice to the \r\nAfrican continent. \r\n Let me recall here that Africa is opposed in \r\nprinciple to the veto and believes that it should be \r\nabolished, but as long as it continues to exist and as a \r\nmatter of common justice, it should be extended to all \r\nnew permanent members of the enlarged Security \r\nCouncil, in full application of the principle of equality \r\nbetween current and new permanent members. \r\n In that context and with a view to dealing with \r\nthe issue of the Security Council reform in a realistic \r\nmanner, Egypt believes that the negotiations should \r\ndeal effectively with the veto rights of new and current \r\npermanent members together, including the misuse or \r\nthreat of use of the veto right. That approach would \r\nnecessitate the serious consideration of restricting the \r\nveto right of current and new permanent members to \r\nexclude, at a first stage, cases of genocide, ethnic \r\ncleansing, crimes against humanity, grave violations to \r\ninternational humanitarian law, cessation of hostilities \r\nbetween belligerent parties and the election of the \r\nSecretary-General. That will strengthen the \r\ncommitment of the permanent members to the \r\ninternational responsibility of the Security Council and \r\nof all members of the General Assembly to protect \r\npeoples from such heinous crimes, rather than to \r\nprotect, for political or other considerations, those who \r\ncommit such crimes. In itself, that would be the \r\nmaximum manifestation of genuine global governance. \r\n A balanced regional representation will be closely \r\nlinked to the size of the enlarged Security Council. \r\nTherefore, when the Ezulwini Consensus states that \r\nAfrica is demanding no less than two permanent seats \r\nwith all the prerogatives and privileges, including the \r\nright of veto, along with two additional non-permanent \r\nseats, that should be read in the sense that Africa might \r\ndemand more permanent seats if it feels that other \r\nregions smaller in number are getting more seats than \r\ntheir ratio of representation. \r\n The African selection of candidates should not be \r\nseen as a contradiction to Article 23 of the Charter, \r\nwhich will continue to govern the election process in \r\nthe General Assembly. We also believe that an enlarged \r\nSecurity Council, with at least 26 seats, will not \r\nnegatively affect the efficiency and effectiveness of the \r\nCouncil, but will enhance representation and \r\ndemocracy. \r\n Despite the continued efforts and attempts within \r\nthe Security Council to improve its working methods, \r\nparticularly those undertaken by the Council’s Informal \r\nWorking Group on Documentation and Other \r\nProcedural Questions, as reflected in the note by the \r\nPresident of the Security Council (S/2010/507), none \r\nof those attempts meets the aspirations or the ambitions \r\nof the larger majority of Member States. Moreover, \r\nfocus should be on the consideration, adoption and \r\nimplementation of the proposals presented in that \r\nregard, including the proposals and positions of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement and the Small Five. \r\n Regarding the issue of the relationship between \r\nthe General Assembly and the Security Council, Egypt \r\nstresses that encroachment by the Council on the role \r\nand functions of the Assembly should stop. The quality \r\nof the Council’s annual reports submitted to the \r\nAssembly, the coordination between the Presidents of \r\nboth organs, the role of the Assembly on questions \r\nrelating to international peace and security and in the \r\nprocess of selecting and appointing the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and many other issues must be dealt with \r\neffectively. \r\n Different proposals have been made for an \r\nintermediate approach. Egypt believes that that \r\napproach does not respond to African demands, as it \r\ndoes not guarantee a true expansion of the permanent \r\ncategory and excludes granting the right of veto to new \r\npermanent members. \r\nA/65/PV.48  \r\n \r\n10-63228 8 \r\n \r\n That new approach is still ambiguous, and we \r\nwould welcome further clarifications from its authors \r\nconcerning its final objective, the duration, renewal \r\nand termination of intermediate seats, the limitations \r\non veto rights for current and new members in the \r\nintermediate phase, the period of transition, the rules \r\nthat would be applied for the rotation of intermediate \r\nseats, and the exact details of the review stage. \r\n Enhanced representation of developing countries \r\nand small States in the Security Council is also one of \r\nthe fundamental pillars of the reform process, since the \r\nadoption of resolution 48/26. Egypt stresses the \r\nnecessity takeoff taking duly into account the position \r\nof members of the League of Arab States demanding a \r\npermanent seat for the Arab Group in any future \r\nexpansion in the category of permanent membership of \r\nthe Council, as reaffirmed in the Sirte Declaration \r\nadopted by the Arab Summit in its ordinary session of \r\n28 March 2010. We also stress the necessity takeoff \r\ntaking into account the position of the Organization of \r\nthe Islamic Conference demanding adequate \r\nrepresentation of the Muslim Ummah in any category \r\nof membership in the expanded Council. \r\n In conclusion, Egypt reiterates that what we need \r\nis the political will of us all, large and small, \r\ndeveloping and developed, permanent and \r\nnon-permanent members, in order to achieve the results \r\nthat could garner the widest possible political \r\nacceptance, and I hope we can make strides towards \r\nthat objective during the current session. \r\n Mr. Aisi (Papua New Guinea): I have the honour \r\nto speak on behalf of the Pacific small island \r\ndeveloping States (SIDS) represented at the United \r\nNations, namely Fiji, Palau, the Republic of the \r\nMarshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Samoa, Solomon \r\nIslands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and my own country, \r\nPapua New Guinea. \r\n We thank the United Kingdom for introducing the \r\nreport of the Security Council (A/65/2) under the \r\nagenda item before us. The Pacific SIDS welcome the \r\nopportunity to participate in this debate on the question \r\nof equitable representation on and increase in the \r\nmembership of the Security Council and related \r\nmatters. \r\n The reform of the Security Council is long \r\noverdue. In the 2005 World Summit Outcome \r\n(resolution 60/1), we, the international community, \r\ncommitted ourselves to early reform of the Council \r\nbecause we recognized that reform is necessary to \r\nincrease its effectiveness and legitimacy. Furthermore, \r\nthe reforms will properly reflect the contemporary \r\ngeopolitical and economic realities, rather than those of \r\n1945. \r\n It is therefore critical that we redouble our efforts \r\nto achieve success. In a world where peace is not \r\nenjoyed by all, we must ensure that the body charged \r\nwith the primary responsibility for the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security is properly structured \r\nto enable it to effectively discharge its duties, as \r\ndetailed in the United Nations Charter. \r\n As a global community, our commitment to peace \r\nand security is measured by our commitment to the \r\neffectiveness of the system that we have put in place to \r\nsafeguard all people from the ravages of war and \r\nconflict. So in delaying the reform of the Council, we \r\nare contributing to the current global insecurity. We \r\nurge all Member States to recognize the global good to \r\nbe achieved by a reformed Council, one that is more \r\nrepresentative of the people whom it serves, and to \r\nurgently enhance our work so that we conclude this \r\nmatter. \r\n The position of the Pacific SIDS on a reformed \r\nSecurity Council is well known. In relation to the \r\nquestion of categories of membership, we consider \r\nexpansion in the number of both permanent and non-\r\npermanent members to be critical. The Pacific SIDS do \r\nnot support the creation of new categories of \r\nmembership in a reformed Council, such as a new \r\ncategory of extended seats. \r\n The current composition of the Council does not \r\nsufficiently represent all regions of the world and does \r\nnot reflect the geopolitical realities of this century. \r\nThat is most obvious in the case of Africa, where it is \r\nimperative that permanent seats be given to correct the \r\ninjustices of the past. The Group of Latin American \r\nand Caribbean States (GRULAC) is also not \r\nrepresented in the permanent category, while Asia, with \r\nonly one permanent seat, is underrepresented. \r\n The redressing of that imbalance in one of the \r\nmajor decision-making bodies of the United Nations is \r\nmost critical if the United Nations reform agenda is to \r\nbe properly achieved. Therefore, the Pacific SIDS \r\nsupport two new permanent seats for Africa and one \r\nfor GRULAC. We also support two additional \r\npermanent seats for Asia and one for the Group of \r\n A/65/PV.48\r\n \r\n9 10-63228 \r\n \r\nWestern European and other States. We also support \r\nfive additional non-permanent members. \r\n The expansion of the Council as we have \r\ndescribed it attracts the widest convergence among the \r\nUnited Nations membership, and we urge all countries \r\nto show flexibility so that we can move forward on this \r\nissue. \r\n The existing regional group arrangement used to \r\npropose members for a two-year non-permanent seat in \r\nthe Council through the concept of equitable \r\ngeographical distribution also requires reform. The \r\nexisting arrangement is no longer equitable in the \r\ndistribution or selection of members from within the \r\nregional groups to serve on the Council. A more \r\ndemocratic and fair system of selection and a more \r\nbalanced geographical distribution of subregions \r\nwithin the groups is required when proposals by groups \r\nfor non-permanent seats in the Council are put forward. \r\n The option of allocating a seat to the small island \r\ndeveloping States within the existing group structures \r\nmust be included in some form of assurance, contained \r\nin guidelines that could be part of a realistic reform \r\nprocess. Those assurances will afford the SIDS a more \r\nbalanced opportunity to serve in the Council and will \r\nreflect a more democratic sharing of the concept of \r\nequitable geographical distribution. \r\n In relation to the report on the Council’s work, \r\nwe are of course disappointed that the Council did not \r\ntake up the issue of climate change. We urgently call \r\non the Council to begin consideration of the threats to \r\ninternational peace and security posed by climate \r\nchange. Climate change threatens to place tremendous \r\nstress on our national and international institutions and \r\ncould displace millions of people around the world. \r\n In our region of the Pacific, climate change may \r\nresult in the physical disappearance of entire nations, \r\nwith their populations rendered stateless. As the United \r\nNations body that holds primary responsibility for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, the \r\nSecurity Council has a duty to use the expansive \r\npowers granted to it under the Charter of the United \r\nNations to respond to the security threat posed by \r\nclimate change. \r\n In the summer of 2009, this body unanimously \r\npassed resolution 63/281, recognizing for the first time \r\nthe clear connection between climate change and its \r\nimplications for international peace and security. In his \r\nreport pursuant to that resolution (A/64/350), the \r\nSecretary-General identified several pathways by \r\nwhich climate change can threaten international peace \r\nand security. We agree with his statement that \r\n “the international community must anticipate and \r\nprepare itself to address a number of largely \r\nunprecedented challenges posed by climate \r\nchange for which existing mechanisms may prove \r\ninadequate” (A/64/350, para. 101). \r\n We agree with those conclusions and consider it \r\nimperative that the Security Council begin immediate \r\nconsideration of actions it could take to respond to \r\nthese growing threats. \r\n The Security Council has long recognized that it \r\nmust act to prevent disputes before they arise. To the \r\ncurrent Council members, we ask that they support this \r\ncall to action and place the issue on the agenda for \r\n2011. Given the enormity of the threats posed by \r\nclimate change, it is incumbent upon the Council to \r\nbegin work on this enormous task at once. \r\n Mr. Seger (Switzerland) (spoke in French): I \r\nhave the honour to speak on behalf of the group of five \r\nsmall nations (S-5) — Costa Rica, Jordan, \r\nLiechtenstein, Singapore and Switzerland. \r\n My statement will address both agenda items 29, \r\n“Report of the Security Council”, and 119, “Question \r\nof equitable representation on and increase in the \r\nmembership of the Security Council and related \r\nmatters”. \r\n With regard to item 29, the S-5 welcome the \r\nholding of a debate on the annual report of the Security \r\nCouncil (A/65/2). We also commend the efforts of the \r\nUnited Kingdom, as the current President of the \r\nCouncil, for its wise initiative to introduce an element \r\nof reflection and analysis in the introduction of the \r\nreport. We hope that other Council Presidents will \r\ncontinue that practice. \r\n Nevertheless, we believe that the time has come \r\nto take additional steps in order to make this debate \r\nmore meaningful. Such measures would involve \r\nchanges in both how the annual report is drafted and \r\nhow it is discussed here. The sixty-fifth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, whose overarching theme is global \r\ngovernance, gives us a good opportunity to reflect on \r\nthe ways in which the report, and the manner in which \r\nwe consider it, could be improved. \r\nA/65/PV.48  \r\n \r\n10-63228 10 \r\n \r\n Ideally, the discussions of the Security Council’s \r\nfuture reports should meet three criteria: they should be \r\ninformal, inclusive and interactive. If we manage that, \r\nwe will be able to draw greater and more tangible \r\nbenefits from the annual report in the context of our \r\ncommon endeavour to strengthen international peace \r\nand security while fully respecting the tasks, mandates \r\nand competencies of both the General Assembly and \r\nthe Security Council. \r\n The Charter of the United Nations clearly confers \r\nprimary responsibility for the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security on the Council. A more \r\nsubstantive and interactive dialogue between the two \r\nmain organs of the United Nations, and among Member \r\nStates, on the annual report is not meant to challenge \r\nthat prerogative. Nonetheless, the Council could \r\nbenefit from stronger involvement of its members. That \r\nwould help it better discharge its functions. At the \r\nsame time, political discussion with the Members of \r\nthe Organization would have the additional advantage \r\nthat the decisions taken by the Security Council would \r\nenjoy a greater sense of political ownership by States \r\nthat would thus have a greater sense of involvement in \r\nthem. \r\n In that sense, the annual report would constitute \r\nan excellent opportunity not only to review the past but \r\nalso for all parties to draw lessons with a view to \r\nimproving the options and strategies for the coming \r\nyear and beyond. In other words, the discussion of the \r\nreport, instead of being primarily retrospective, should \r\nbe a forward-looking exercise. Such discussion need \r\nnot be a formal exercise; indeed, the Five propose a \r\nmore seminar-like format, which could take the form of \r\na series of workshops focused on situations and/or \r\nthemes. \r\n Our ideas may seem like a quantum leap to some, \r\nbut the fact of the matter is that the debate on the \r\nreport of the Security Council has become stale and \r\nritualistic. As such, it has lost a great deal of its \r\nmeaning. If we truly wish to work together towards \r\ninternational peace and security in keeping with the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, we need to be bold and \r\ninnovative to get more out of this annual report. The \r\nFive therefore invite all Member States to reflect on \r\npossible improvements during this sixty-fifth session \r\nof the General Assembly. \r\n That having been said, the Five would like to \r\nmake the following remarks on this year’s report. \r\nAlthough we had hoped for more in terms of the \r\nprocess as well as the contents of this report, we have \r\nseen some encouraging progress. \r\n With regard to the process, we welcome the \r\nopenness displayed by Nigeria in holding a dialogue \r\nwith Member States on the annual report. Nonetheless, \r\nwe propose that all Member States should be \r\nsubstantively involved at an earlier stage in the \r\ndrafting process — for example, through an interactive \r\nopen debate. We would also like to see those exchanges \r\nreflected in the annual report. \r\n With regard to the contents of the report, we have \r\nnoted some positive new elements in this year’s report, \r\nwhich could serve as a basis for further improvements. \r\nFirst, we commend Nigeria for having included the \r\nanalytical summaries of some of the presidencies, \r\nwhen available. Secondly, in the chapter on the Sudan, \r\nwe noted a new practice whereby the discussions \r\nwithin the Council following a briefing by the \r\nProsecutor of the International Criminal Court were \r\nreflected. In that context, we support and encourage the \r\ninclusion of an analysis of the current challenges \r\nfacing the Security Council, its evaluations, and the \r\nrationale for its decisions. \r\n Thirdly, the Five underscore the need to highlight \r\nthe linkages between thematic, regional and country-\r\nspecific issues. The chapter on the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo clearly shows the relevance of \r\nthe Council’s approach to women and peace and \r\nsecurity in the fight against sexual violence against \r\nwomen in armed conflict. The annual report should \r\ntake account of that. \r\n Finally, we welcome in particular the inclusion of \r\na chapter on working methods. In future, we would \r\nsuggest expanding on that chapter by adding the \r\nCouncil’s assessment of its consideration of and \r\nprogress on that matter, and informing the wider \r\nmembership on the implementation of the note by the \r\nCouncil President in document S/2010/507. \r\n In concluding our remarks on item 29, the Five \r\nwould like to congratulate the current presidency of the \r\nSecurity Council for having breathed an innovative \r\nspirit into the discussions and for favouring \r\ninteractiveness. We would also like to highlight that the \r\nincrease in the number of open debates organized each \r\nmonth by the Council President — while one marker of \r\nopenness and inclusion — in itself cannot translate into \r\nmeaningful discussions. \r\n A/65/PV.48\r\n \r\n11 10-63228 \r\n \r\n In that context, the procedural changes presented \r\nby the United Kingdom during its informal briefing \r\nlast week for members of the General Assembly \r\ndeserve support, as they will make debates less \r\nformulaic and more conducive to discussions. We \r\nparticularly welcome the idea of organizing an \r\nexchange of views with the Department of Political \r\nAffairs. We are also open to suggestions for making the \r\nconsultations within the Council more spontaneous, \r\nlively and productive. We encourage future Council \r\npresidencies to follow that positive example and to \r\ncontinue such efforts. \r\n The issue of working methods leads me to agenda \r\nitem 119, on the reform of the Security Council. The \r\nS-5 thank the Council for holding an open debate on its \r\nworking methods in April this year (see S/PV.6300), \r\nwhich was followed by the updating of the note by the \r\nPresident of the Council (S/2010/507). We commend \r\nthe Informal Working Group on Documentation, and \r\nJapan as its Chair, for their work, and welcome the \r\nupdated version of the presidential note. That \r\ndocument constitutes a good compilation of existing \r\npractices and of developments since the adoption of the \r\nfirst such presidential note (S/2006/507). At the same \r\ntime, we believe that the note does not fully address all \r\nthe important areas of work with regard to working \r\nmethods. In particular, we regret the absence of \r\nimplementation mechanisms. \r\n The S-5 will continue to focus on the issue of \r\nreforming the working methods of the Security Council \r\nas a matter of priority. Progress in that area has to \r\nhappen whether or not we can agree on an expansion of \r\nthe Council. \r\n With regard to the enlargement of the Security \r\nCouncil, the S-5 hope that the sixty-fifth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly will pave the way for initiating real, \r\nsubstantive and interactive negotiations. If we are not \r\nable to take that process to the next level, the United \r\nNations will be perceived as an organization incapable \r\nof reforming itself. That would be very detrimental to \r\nthe image and the credibility of the United Nations and \r\nwould reflect badly on us as Member States. Therefore, \r\nwe welcome the early resumption of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, as well as the \r\nreappointment of Ambassador Tanin as its facilitator. \r\nWe wish to assure Ambassador Tanin of our full \r\nsupport for the upcoming process. \r\n Mr. Touray (Sierra Leone): Permit me to thank \r\nyou, Mr. President, on behalf of the African Group, for \r\nyour opening remarks this morning, and for convening \r\nthis joint debate on agenda item 29, on the report of the \r\nSecurity Council to the General Assembly on the work \r\nof the Council for the period August 2009 through July \r\n2010, and on agenda item 119, dealing with the \r\nquestion of equitable representation on and increase in \r\nthe membership of the Security Council and related \r\nmatters. \r\n I should also like to thank both the Security \r\nCouncil and the Secretariat for the report contained in \r\ndocument A/65/2. We thank the Council’s President, \r\nSir Mark Lyall Grant, for introducing the report. \r\nHowever, in our representative capacity we will \r\nconfine our intervention to matters relating to the \r\nworking methods of the Council and its relationship \r\nwith the General Assembly and to the question of \r\nequitable representation on and increase in membership \r\nof the Security Council and related matters. We will \r\nspeak on other matters in the report in our national \r\ncapacity. \r\n Mr. President, your choice of “Reaffirming the \r\ncentral role of the United Nations in global \r\ngovernance” as the central theme of the Assembly’s \r\nsixty-fifth session could not have been made at a better \r\ntime. The United Nations, despite the daunting \r\nchallenges that confronted it in the immediate \r\naftermath of the Cold War, has evolved to be the most \r\nlegitimate forum where all nations could meet to find \r\nsolutions to the myriad of problems confronting our \r\nworld. \r\n In an increasingly interdependent, globalized \r\nworld, the United Nations has gained recognition as a \r\nnorm-setting institution in governing relations between \r\nand among nations — hence the need to reaffirm its \r\ncentrality in global governance. But in doing so, it \r\nbecomes imperative that we all recommit ourselves to \r\nthe reform process now ongoing. For the legitimacy \r\nand central role of the United Nations in global \r\ngovernance to be fully achievable, there is a need to \r\naddress the burning issues of democratizing the \r\nSecurity Council through equitable regional \r\nrepresentation in order to reflect the current \r\ngeopolitical realities, and of making the Council more \r\nrepresentative, transparent and accountable to the \r\nwider membership in order to give effect to the \r\nlegitimacy of its decisions and make it more effective. \r\nA/65/PV.48  \r\n \r\n10-63228 12 \r\n \r\n Less than a month ago, convinced of the urgent \r\nneed to reaffirm the centrality of the United Nations in \r\nglobal governance as we entered into the Assembly’s \r\nsixty-fifth session, the President convened a closed \r\ninformal plenary on the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nin order to sound the views of the membership on \r\nwhere the reform process is, where it is leading us and \r\nhow we can move the process forward. \r\n The President concluded that, first, the second \r\nrevision of the single negotiation text composed by the \r\nfacilitator could serve as a vehicle to move the process \r\nforward. Secondly, the facilitator should continue to \r\nwork through open, inclusive and transparent \r\nconsultations that would allow the text to evolve in a \r\nbalanced and comprehensive way. Thirdly, \r\n11 November — that is, today’s joint debate — would \r\noffer the opportunity to move the process forward. \r\nFourthly, the responsibility to do that rests with \r\nMember States. Finally, he urged Member States to \r\nreflect on their positions and interact to find a way out. \r\nWe unreservedly support his remarks and very much \r\nhope that this joint debate today will open a window of \r\nopportunity for finding solutions to what at this stage is \r\na seemingly intractable subject. \r\n We continue to reiterate the imperative of \r\nreforming the Security Council in a comprehensive \r\nmanner that will enhance the efficiency and \r\neffectiveness of the United Nations in its primary \r\nresponsibility of maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity. Attention should therefore be given to \r\nimproving the relationship between the Security \r\nCouncil and the General Assembly, enhancing the \r\nefficiency and transparency of the Council’s work, and \r\npromoting more interaction and dialogue with \r\nnon-Council members on the Council’s working \r\nmethods, in addition to the most important issue of the \r\nexpansion of the Council in both the permanent and \r\nnon-permanent categories. Bringing the two agenda \r\nitems 29 and 119 together in this debate is a clear \r\nindication that the two are interlinked. \r\n On that note, we acknowledge the Security \r\nCouncil’s presidential note contained in document \r\nS/2010/507, issued on 26 July 2010, and the progress \r\nmade towards attaining greater efficiency and \r\ntransparency in the Council’s working methods, \r\nparticularly in the holding of more meetings and \r\nconsultations with other stakeholders such as Member \r\nStates, troop-contributing countries and \r\nnon-governmental organizations. \r\n We also welcome the Security Council’s visit to \r\nspecific missions engaged in areas in the continent that \r\nare on its agenda to garner accurate information on the \r\nground and to increase the effectiveness of its work \r\nand decisions. We encourage the Council to continue \r\nwith such measures aimed at improving, nurturing and \r\nenhancing its relations with relevant stakeholders. \r\n In particular, we continue to stress the need for \r\nmore inclusiveness, transparency and legitimacy in the \r\nCouncil’s proceedings. Here, we would like to \r\nemphasize that the rules of procedure — which remain \r\nprovisional after 60 years of the Council’s existence — \r\nare a cause for concern. Additionally, we urge its full \r\ncompliance with the provisions of Article 15, \r\nparagraph 1, and Article 24, paragraph 3, of the United \r\nNations Charter by submitting special reports to the \r\nGeneral Assembly for its consideration, and urge that \r\nthe Council’s annual reports be analytical enough to be \r\nof added value and significance. \r\n Furthermore, it is important for the Security \r\nCouncil to concentrate on the mandate and competence \r\naccorded to it by the United Nations Charter and resist \r\nresort to Chapter VII provisions of the Charter as an \r\nexcuse to address issues that do not really fall within \r\nthe ambit of the provisions. We urge the Council to \r\ncontinue to work more cooperatively with the General \r\nAssembly and the Economic and Social Council by \r\nholding more intense and regular consultations with the \r\nPresidents of both organs, which would foster \r\nharmonious interaction and avoid encroaching on the \r\nmandates of the other two organs. \r\n We therefore reaffirm the need for full \r\nimplementation of the relevant provisions of Assembly \r\nresolutions 51/193, 58/126 and 59/313. \r\n We acknowledge progress made during the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations in the previous session, \r\nculminating in the single negotiating document as a \r\nsignificant step in the right direction. We would like to \r\nthank His Excellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth \r\nsession, and Ambassador Zahir Tanin, the facilitator, \r\nfor their tireless efforts in promoting and advancing the \r\nreform process. It now behoves us all to build on that \r\nprogress by continuing the negotiations within the \r\nframework of decisions 62/557, 63/565 and 64/568 in a \r\nway that will allow the text to evolve in an open and \r\ntransparent manner. \r\n A/65/PV.48\r\n \r\n13 10-63228 \r\n \r\n In that vein, there is need to identify and agree on \r\nthe structure and approach by which to continue the \r\nnegotiations. Consequently, it is our view that we \r\nshould now aim at meaningful consultations and an \r\ninteractive approach that will move the process \r\ntowards consensus-building. We support the \r\ncontinuation of the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nalong with the facilitator, seeking to reach an \r\nagreement on the principles and criteria relating to the \r\nfive key issues, or negotiables, as stipulated in \r\nparagraph (e) (ii) of decision 62/557. \r\n Our call for Africa’s representation in both the \r\npermanent and non-permanent categories of the \r\nSecurity Council, as contained in the Ezulwini \r\nConsensus and the Sirte Declaration, is to address the \r\ninjustice that a continent of 53 States, accounting for \r\nabout 70 per cent of the Council’s work, has had to \r\ncontend with, and continues to contend with, as against \r\nthe geopolitical realities of today’s world. \r\n Africa therefore demands and continues to \r\ndemand an expansion in both categories of \r\nmembership, permanent and non-permanent, with no \r\nless than two permanent seats together with all the \r\nprerogatives and privileges, including the veto as long \r\nas it continues to exist, and a total of five non-\r\npermanent seats, with the African Union being trusted \r\nwith the responsibility of selecting Africa’s candidates. \r\nAny continued delay in the process will not only \r\nsucceed in prolonging that historical injustice but will \r\nalso question the legitimacy of the decisions of the \r\nCouncil and the integrity of its proceedings. \r\n In conclusion, Africa reiterates its call for a \r\nCouncil that is more inclusive, effective, transparent, \r\nefficient and accountable. Africa urges all Member \r\nStates to continue to negotiate in good faith and with \r\nmutual trust and to endeavour to make concerted \r\nefforts to achieve progress in the negotiation and move \r\nthe process forward. It is therefore incumbent on us all \r\nto continue the process in an atmosphere of flexibility \r\nand compromise so that a reform that satisfies the \r\nbroad consensus of membership can be achieved. \r\n We in Africa are committed to working with all \r\ninterested groups and the general membership in this \r\nsession to make Security Council reform a reality. \r\n In our national capacity, my delegation \r\nacknowledges with appreciation the report on Sierra \r\nLeone in the Council’s report for the period August \r\n2009 to July 2010 (A/65/2). We would like to take this \r\nas another opportunity to thank the Council and the \r\ninternational community for the continued support in \r\nour post-conflict peacebuilding effort. Sierra Leone is \r\ndeeply committed to building on the gains since the \r\nend of hostilities and will continue to endeavour to \r\nwork with all stakeholders to ensure sustainable peace, \r\nstability, growth and development. \r\n Mr. Lambert (Belgium) (spoke in French): Our \r\nworld is in the process of an accelerated \r\ntransformation. We all know that the economic, \r\npolitical, institutional and development positions of \r\nmany countries are in a full process of change. \r\n Within the United Nations, we all promote \r\neffective multilateralism. We must therefore take into \r\naccount the reality of certain changes. The United \r\nNations institutions, including the Security Council, \r\nshould better reflect that new reality in an equitable \r\nmanner. Indeed, recently we have been able to see that \r\nthe attention to the issue of the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil is and continues to be very current in the \r\ninternational sphere, at the highest levels. The outside \r\nworld has expectations when it comes to this issue, and \r\nconsequently has expectations of us. \r\n It is in this context that I welcome the laudable \r\nwork of Ambassador Tanin, who has been able to \r\nachieve remarkable progress by initiating an exercise \r\nintended to make the current negotiating text more \r\noperational. Many delegations, including those of the \r\nBenelux countries, have contributed to this exercise by \r\nintroducing proposals for improving the text on the \r\nfive major topics before us. We remain prepared to do \r\neven more during the current session of the General \r\nAssembly. I also welcome the specific attention that \r\nyou, Mr. President, are devoting to this effort. For us, \r\nthat is a positive sign that should inspire us to continue \r\nwith the momentum initiated at the beginning of this \r\nsession. \r\n Here and now, I wish to appeal to all members of \r\nthe Assembly to contribute concretely and technically \r\nto producing a real negotiating text through specific \r\nproposals to improve the current one, which will be the \r\nprincipal task of this round of negotiations. The mere \r\nrepetition of traditionally held — and therefore well-\r\nknown — points of view is no longer an option. From \r\nnow on, we must produce results. The outside world is \r\nwatching, expects much from us and, indeed, expects \r\nus to do better. Ideally, we should be prepared to target \r\nelements that essentially constitute the real political \r\nA/65/PV.48  \r\n \r\n10-63228 14 \r\n \r\nGordian knot, such as enlarging the Council in its two \r\ncategories. \r\n The objectives to be reached this year are \r\ntherefore clear in our minds. My delegation remains \r\nprepared to rise to the challenge and to assume our \r\nresponsibility in an interactive fashion. \r\n Mr. Wittig (Germany): Please allow me to first \r\nthank you, Mr. President, for the personal attention that \r\nyou have been giving to the topic of Security Council \r\nreform. We are very grateful both to you and to the \r\nChair, Ambassador Tanin, for the fact that we have \r\nalready been able to hold one informal plenary meeting \r\non the issue under your presidency of the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n The importance of United Nations reform, and in \r\nparticular that of the Security Council, cannot be \r\noverstated. There are concerns about global governance \r\nbeing restructured and about the creation of new \r\ninternational formats, such as the Group of 20. In \r\nrecent days, we have been witnessing an important \r\nreform of the International Monetary Fund. The \r\nconcern is that the United Nations might be left behind \r\nin this process, as its basic structure has remained \r\nessentially unchanged since 1945, while the \r\nOrganization’s membership has grown from 51 at the \r\ntime to 192 Member States today. \r\n It is our responsibility as Member States of the \r\nUnited Nations to ensure that these concerns do not \r\nbecome a reality. Time will not play in the favour of \r\nthe United Nations, if an adaptation of its structures to \r\nthe realities of our times cannot soon be achieved. We \r\nmust reach a reform compromise, if the Security \r\nCouncil is to preserve its place at the heart of the \r\nmultilateral system. With its unique claim on \r\nlegitimacy and its indispensable functions as outlined \r\nin the Charter of the United Nations, it must remain, in \r\nour view, the body that deals with threats to peace and \r\nsecurity in the world. \r\n We should therefore not lose any more time in the \r\nreform process. We welcome the fact that it is now ever \r\nmore widely recognized that the Council’s future \r\ncomposition will reflect current geopolitical realities. \r\nPresident Obama delivered an important speech in New \r\nDelhi at the beginning of this week highlighting this \r\nparticular fact. We have to ensure that the Security \r\nCouncil can play its role in the twenty-first century. \r\n The overwhelming majority of Member States \r\nconsiders this aim to be best served by an expansion of \r\nthe Council in both of its membership categories. Like \r\nour African partners and many others, Germany and its \r\npartners in the Group of Four firmly support this model \r\nof expansion. That was a clear result of the sixty-fourth \r\nsession, and it is reflected in the second version of the \r\nnegotiating text that was put forward by the Chair of \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations, Ambassador Tanin. \r\nWe now need to build upon this result. All of us will \r\nhave to engage in the endeavour to find the \r\ncompromise solution with the broadest possible \r\nsupport. \r\n I appeal to all members to now swiftly take the \r\nnegotiating process in the informal plenary meeting \r\none step further to arrive at a third version of the \r\nnegotiating text by the end of the year. That version \r\nshould eliminate overlaps and merge identical \r\npositions, and thus be significantly shorter than the \r\nsecond version. \r\n We call on you, Mr. President, and on the \r\nChairman of the intergovernmental negotiations, to \r\nwork with Member States — possibly also in groups — \r\nand aim for a shortened version by the end of the year. \r\nThis process should eventually be used as an \r\nopportunity to narrow down the options and should be \r\nthe basis of any stocktaking. The membership could \r\nthen start with actual negotiations about the reform by \r\nthe beginning of next year. We should firmly envisage \r\na concrete outcome by the end of the sixty-fifth \r\nsession. \r\n Let me stress that we should arrive at a reform \r\nthat changes the Council for the better. In doing so, a \r\npermanent African presence on the Council, as well as \r\nthe permanent presence of other countries from the \r\nSouth — from Latin America and from Asia — is \r\nessential. But those who are the largest contributors to \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security \r\nwill of course also have to assume their rightful place. \r\n Last but not least, improving the working \r\nmethods of the Security Council is another essential \r\nelement of the reform. A Council thus reformed would \r\nbetter serve the interests of all Member States. \r\n Mr. Kleib (Indonesia): Let me begin by thanking \r\nyou, Mr. President, for convening this important debate \r\non two interconnected agenda items. We also wish to \r\nthank the delegation of the United Kingdom, as the \r\ncurrent President of the Security Council, along with \r\n A/65/PV.48\r\n \r\n15 10-63228 \r\n \r\nother Council members, for presenting the Council’s \r\nannual report for the period 1 August 2009 to 31 July \r\n2010 (A/65/2). We also take this opportunity to thank \r\nthe delegation of Nigeria, which held the Council’s \r\npresidency in July, for its work in drafting the \r\nintroduction of the report. \r\n Indonesia associates itself with the statement on \r\nthe position of the Non-Aligned Movement delivered \r\nearlier by the representative of Egypt. \r\n The vast number of Council resolutions, \r\npresidential statements and field visits during the \r\nperiod covered by the report shows the seriousness of \r\nglobal peace and security challenges. The Council and \r\nthe agencies of the United Nations system have indeed \r\nplayed a very important role in helping to mitigate \r\nconflict and foster peace. Indonesia commends the \r\nCouncil for its actions in many of the cases mentioned \r\nin the report. We applaud it for its many open briefings, \r\nas well as its consultations with troop- and police-\r\ncontributing countries, as part of the effort to plan and \r\nexecute peacekeeping operations more effectively and \r\nwith clear and up-to-date mandates. \r\n At the same time, as some have pointed out, we \r\ntoo would have preferred greater analysis and \r\nelaboration of the Council’s approaches in the report. \r\nIndeed, there is always room for improvement. In that \r\nregard, it would be helpful to United Nations Members \r\nif the report of the Council could include the \r\nimplementation status of the Council’s own decisions. \r\nIt is important that the General Assembly, whose \r\nmembers entrust the Council with the maintenance of \r\nworld peace and security, should have a better \r\nunderstanding of the complete picture. Also, the report \r\nshould be not just about the Council’s successful \r\ndeliberations, but also about its failure to act on \r\nparticular issues. It is not an institution incapable of \r\nfailure. \r\n On United Nations peacekeeping and many other \r\nmatters concerning international peace and security, the \r\nCouncil should conduct a more meaningful exchange \r\nof views with Member States in general, especially \r\nthose whose interests may be directly affected by \r\npossible decisions of the Council. Apart from \r\nenhancing the quality of the Council’s decisions, that \r\nwill create greater ownership over the Council’s \r\ndecisions among the relevant stakeholders, making it \r\nmore effective. \r\n On the subject of Security Council reform, my \r\ndelegation would first like to commend Ambassador \r\nZahir Tanin of Afghanistan for his hard work at the \r\ninformal intergovernmental plenary meetings of the \r\nGeneral Assembly to steer what is certainly not an easy \r\nprocess. A reformed Security Council that, inter alia, \r\naddresses the imbalance in the Council’s composition \r\nin relation to the vast number of developing countries \r\nfrom various regions, as well as making the Council \r\nmore representative, accountable and effective are both \r\nessential. The future composition of the Council should \r\nnaturally include the newly emerging Powers. \r\n We support the efforts to draw up a negotiating \r\ntext, which is definitely a good basis for further \r\nnegotiations. However, in our view, no matter how \r\nhard we try to fine-tune the text during this session, a \r\nbreakthrough in finding solutions to differences will be \r\nbeyond any text. There needs to be greater political \r\nflexibility in agreeing on generally acceptable points. \r\nProgress will be made when the formula for Council \r\nreform is such that it is acceptable to the wide majority \r\nof countries, including those that have a particular \r\ninterest in reform. We need to move forward to work \r\non the points of convergence that can unite the largest \r\npossible number of countries. \r\n Indonesia is among those countries that believe \r\nthat expanding both categories of membership offers \r\nthe greatest potential for addressing the fundamental \r\nshortcoming of the Council as it is presently \r\nconstituted, namely, its lack of representation. That \r\ndefect is widely recognized and hardly needs repeating. \r\nExpanding both categories of membership offers a rare \r\nopportunity to achieve a Council that better reflects the \r\ncontemporary world and, indeed, can anticipate \r\nprojected trends for the future. \r\n However, notwithstanding the obvious appeal of \r\nexpanding both categories to ensure a more \r\nrepresentative Council, it is our considered view that at \r\nthe present time we can realistically say that it is the \r\nmiddle ground that may garner the widest possible \r\npolitical acceptance, and that it is the intermediate \r\napproach on the key issue of categories of membership \r\nthat deserves further consideration in order to move the \r\nprocess forward. In saying this, we are not jettisoning \r\nthe possibility of future reform involving expanding \r\nthe permanent membership. This is one issue that can \r\nbe addressed in the review concept within the \r\nintermediate approach, which we will all delve into in \r\nthe future. \r\nA/65/PV.48  \r\n \r\n10-63228 16 \r\n \r\n There are many variants of the intermediate \r\napproach. We should therefore encourage ourselves to \r\nexplore it further. Our suggestion is that this year’s \r\nsession can add substantive value to advancing the \r\nprocess of Council reform by further exploring the \r\nkind of intermediate approach we can agree on. \r\nRegarding the issue of the size of a reformed Council, \r\nwe should also take a middle-ground approach. A \r\nsuggestion at this stage is to expand the membership to \r\nbetween the mid-20s and 31. We need to work to arrive \r\nat an agreed-on number that reflects the world’s \r\nplurality, with its vast number of developing countries \r\nand regions, in a more balanced manner. \r\n While opinion also varies on the remaining three \r\nkey Council reform issues, Indonesia is certain that, \r\nthrough increased cooperation, collaboration and \r\ndialogue, differences can be narrowed and agreements \r\nreached on advancing the reform process we are all so \r\npainstakingly invested in. \r\n Finally, my delegation would like to reiterate that \r\nall five key issues of Security Council reform should \r\nbe negotiated as an integral part of a comprehensive \r\npackage. Indonesia, for its part, stands ready to engage \r\nwith all countries to advance Council reform on a \r\nviable path. \r\n Mr. Ragaglini (Italy): Thank you for convening \r\nthis debate, Mr. President. It helps us to focus in a very \r\nconcrete way on two issues related to the Security \r\nCouncil, namely, its annual report and the reform \r\nprocess. \r\n The Security Council was involved in intensive \r\nactivity during the period considered by the report \r\n(A/65/2). It dealt with geographic crises in Africa, the \r\nMiddle East, Asia, the Balkans and Haiti. It also \r\ndevoted considerable time to thematic and general \r\nissues, including terrorism, the protection of civilians, \r\nwomen and peace and security, peacekeeping \r\noperations, peacebuilding and non-proliferation. \r\n To respond to the growing demand of Member \r\nStates to improve its effectiveness, the Security \r\nCouncil, under the leadership of the Turkish \r\npresidency, also held an important summit last \r\nSeptember focused on ensuring an effective role for the \r\nCouncil in the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity. On that occasion, the representative of one of \r\nthe Council’s members made the following statement: \r\n  “Improving the effectiveness of the Security \r\nCouncil depends also on the role of \r\nnon-permanent members. They must fully \r\nparticipate in the decision-making process. Non-\r\npermanent members can bring a diversity of \r\nviews and regional experiences to the Council. It \r\nis not appropriate to call upon them only to ratify \r\ndecisions already taken by the permanent \r\nmembers.” (S/PV.6389, p. 16) \r\n That member was Brazil, and the representative \r\nwho made the statement was its Foreign Minister. We \r\nfully share the letter and spirit of the approach of our \r\nBrazilian friends. I shall now shift focus to the Security \r\nCouncil reform process. \r\n We are not deaf and we are not blind. We are \r\nclosely watching the reshaping of the international \r\ncommunity. We understand and welcome the will and \r\ncapacity of Member States to contribute more and to \r\ntake on more responsibilities. Over the past 15 years, \r\nthe world has changed dramatically; it will change \r\neven faster in the next decade. In reforming the \r\nSecurity Council, we all have the responsibility to \r\nconsider the changes that the past and present have \r\nbrought, but especially those that the future will bring. \r\nWe need to make the Council more legitimate, more \r\nrepresentative and more effective. \r\n A reformed Council must give a chance to the 70 \r\nMember States that have never served on it. We must \r\nmake it accountable to the General Assembly through \r\nthe noblest of democratic principles, that is, the right to \r\nvote and to elect representatives. These are the reasons \r\nthat we strongly believe that the Security Council \r\nneeds to be reformed. That is why we do not believe \r\nthat a democratic, representative and legitimate reform \r\ncan be achieved by enlarging the Council and \r\nextending outdated and ineffective privileges, such as \r\npermanent membership, to a few, while neglecting the \r\nrights of many. \r\n Italy, its Uniting for Consensus allies and many \r\nlike-minded Member States are convinced that a \r\nreformed Security Council must be more \r\nrepresentative, more accountable and more flexible. \r\nUnder our proposal, it would be more representative \r\nbecause, by including longer-term seats and new non-\r\npermanent members, more Member States would have \r\na chance to serve. It would also be more representative \r\nowing to an innovative approach to regional \r\nrepresentation, which is particularly significant \r\n A/65/PV.48\r\n \r\n17 10-63228 \r\n \r\nfollowing the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty and \r\nthe progress achieved by the African Union. It would \r\nbe more accountable because even longer-term seats \r\nwould be subject to elections and scrutiny by the \r\nGeneral Assembly. And it would be more flexible \r\nbecause our proposal has the merit of making the \r\nCouncil adaptable without the need to spend another \r\n17 years looking for a reform to adapt it to new \r\nrealities. \r\n The latter is a crucial point. If we add new \r\npermanent members now — say four or five — in \r\naddition to further non-permanent members, what shall \r\nwe do in 10, 15 or 20 years’ time when other countries \r\nwill be ready to assume greater responsibilities? Shall \r\nwe add other permanent members while applying the \r\nsame logic? Will we end up with a Council of 30 to 35 \r\nmembers? Will it work better or worse? Will not \r\nBrazil’s concerns on the attitude of permanent \r\nmembers — which we share — be heightened? \r\n Of course, the Uniting for Consensus proposal is \r\nnot a take-it-or-leave-it proposition. It is a genuine and \r\ndoable proposal — the newest in the past five years — \r\nwhich takes into account the link of all five key issues, \r\nreflects a fresh and compromise-based approach and \r\nshows flexibility, creativity and good faith. It is \r\ntherefore imperative that, during the current session, \r\nthe members of the Assembly show the same \r\nflexibility, readiness to negotiate and willingness to \r\ncompromise in order to work on the text prepared by \r\nthe facilitator, Ambassador Tanin. Italy and its partners \r\nare ready to do so. \r\n Mr. Alotaibi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to express my appreciation to the \r\nPermanent Representative of the United Kingdom, the \r\nPresident of the Security Council for this month, for \r\nhis introduction of the Council’s report (A/65/2) to the \r\nGeneral Assembly, and for his important briefing on \r\nthe Council’s activities over the past year. I am also \r\npleased to congratulate the new non-permanent \r\nmembers of the Security Council for the period 2011-\r\n2012, namely, Colombia, Germany, India, Portugal and \r\nSouth Africa. I also wish to reaffirm my delegation’s \r\nsupport for the statement delivered earlier by the \r\nrepresentative of Egypt on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement. We also welcome a new decision to once \r\nagain place trust in Ambassador Zahir Tanin to lead the \r\nwork of the intergovernmental negotiations aimed at \r\nreaching a historic agreement that would strengthen the \r\nrole of the Security Council. \r\n The two topics under consideration today are \r\namong the most important items on the agenda of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, namely, the report of the Security \r\nCouncil and the question of equitable representation on \r\nand increase in the membership of the Council. The \r\nissue of reform continues to be stalled after 18 years of \r\ndiscussions. We have not yet reached any agreement on \r\neither the changes to be made or the form that the \r\nCouncil should have, although there is international \r\nconsensus that the Council must be reformed. \r\n However, we cannot ignore the fact that there has \r\nbeen progress in the negotiations, especially on the \r\nworking methods of the Council. There is almost \r\ngeneralized agreement on many of the procedures and \r\nproposals to be introduced. There is no doubt that there \r\nmust be general agreement when it comes to any issue \r\npertaining to expanding and reforming the Security \r\nCouncil, so as to ensure that the reform is real, enjoys \r\nwide acceptance and is easy to implement. There is \r\nalso a need for transparency, good faith and avoiding \r\nany unilateral actions aimed at achieving national \r\ninterests. The purpose of serving as a member of the \r\nCouncil is to contribute to the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. That entails a \r\nresponsibility to maintain objectivity and not seek \r\npolitical gains for any State or regional group. \r\n Kuwait’s position on the issue of Security \r\nCouncil reform, which has been clearly set out on \r\nmany previous occasions, is grounded on the following \r\nestablished principles. The reform of the Council \r\nshould be an integral part of a comprehensive reform \r\nof all the organs of the United Nations. The reform \r\nprocess should aim at improving efficiency and \r\nensuring effectiveness and legitimacy. It should be \r\ncomprehensive and ongoing in order to meet its \r\nresponsibilities, keep pace with changes and address \r\nthe challenges and developments facing the \r\ninternational community. Any increase in the \r\nmembership of the Security Council should serve to \r\nbolster its role in maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity and increase the legitimacy and credibility to \r\nits resolutions. \r\n We attach great importance to improving both the \r\nworking methods of the Council and its relations with \r\nthe other principal organs of the United Nations, \r\nnamely, the General Assembly and the Economic and \r\nSocial Council. Kuwait therefore supports the \r\nproposals made by the Non-Aligned Movement aimed \r\nat increasing transparency in the work of the Council \r\nA/65/PV.48  \r\n \r\n10-63228 18 \r\n \r\nand facilitating the flow of information to and from \r\nMember States. We also recognize the need for full \r\nrespect for the respective mandates and competencies \r\nof each organ, especially those of the General \r\nAssembly, as well as the need to limit the role of the \r\nSecurity Council to discussing issues that pose a threat \r\nto international peace and security. \r\n In that regard, we reiterate the importance of \r\ncodifying the procedures adopted by the Security \r\nCouncil to improve its working methods, without \r\nwaiting for an agreement on other issues — such as \r\nthose relating to the size and composition of the \r\nCouncil and its decision-making process — especially \r\nsince codifying those procedures would not necessarily \r\nentail amending the Charter. We also believe that the \r\nSecurity Council should adopt permanent rules of \r\nprocedure, instead of the provisional ones under which \r\nit has been operating for more than 60 years. \r\n Kuwait also supports keeping in place the \r\nmechanism for the election of non-permanent members \r\nof the Council established under Article 23, paragraph \r\n2, of the Charter, as it provides a greater opportunity \r\nfor small Member States to serve on the Council and \r\ncontribute to its work. That is especially important \r\ngiven that, after six and a half decades, more than a \r\nquarter of Member States have yet to serve as members \r\nof the Security Council. \r\n With regard to the veto, we consider it important \r\nto place limits and controls on its use, including \r\nlimiting it to issues under Chapter VII of the Charter. \r\n Should there be an agreement on increasing the \r\nnumber of non-permanent seats, distributing those \r\nseats to regional groups should take into account the \r\ngreat increase in the number of Members from among \r\nAsian States. \r\n We should also not ignore the right of Arab and \r\nMuslim countries to appropriate representation in \r\naccordance with their size and contributions to \r\ndefending the purposes and principles of the Charter. \r\n In conclusion, we reaffirm our support for all \r\nefforts to strengthen the role and performance of the \r\nSecurity Council. We must reach a consensus that will \r\nensure that the Security Council is able to carry out its \r\nwork under the Charter without any obstacles. \r\n Mr. Oyarzun (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): My \r\ndelegation appreciates the opportunity to hold this joint \r\ndebate on the Security Council report to the General \r\nAssembly (A/65/2) and Security Council reform. \r\n With regard to the Security Council report to the \r\nGeneral Assembly, I am grateful for the statement \r\nmade by the Permanent Representative of the United \r\nKingdom, as President of the Council. The report \r\nsubmitted at this session is more analytical than that of \r\nthe previous year, but even more progress could be \r\nmade through the inclusion of additional, qualitative \r\ninformation. \r\n Spain attaches great importance to positive \r\ninteraction between the Security Council and the \r\nGeneral Assembly. The interaction and cooperation \r\nbetween these two main organs of the United Nations \r\nshould be improved through greater transparency and \r\naccountability, which would promote the adoption of \r\nmore useful methods to prevent and eliminate threats \r\nto international peace and security. \r\n The United Nations Charter provides guidelines \r\nfor interaction between the General Assembly and the \r\nSecurity Council. Articles 15 and 24.3 provide for the \r\nsubmission by the Council of annual and special \r\nreports to the General Assembly. \r\n Among the matters addressed by the Security \r\nCouncil, cross-cutting issues are of special relevance to \r\nthe Assembly. Issues such as the fight against \r\nterrorism, peacebuilding, the disarmament of ex-\r\ncombatants and the prevention of conflicts are of \r\nspecial interest, since the Assembly has responsibilities \r\nfor various aspects of them. Greater coordination and \r\ninteraction between the Council and the Assembly in \r\ndealing with these would be desirable, including \r\nspecific information in order to make the work of the \r\nUnited Nations more effective. It would also be \r\ndesirable to have greater transparency in the work of \r\nthe Council and greater participation of Member States \r\nin the activities and decisions of the Council, \r\nespecially on those issues directly affecting them. It \r\nwould also be desirable for the debates of the Council \r\nto be more open to statements from Member States \r\nwith an interest in the topics under discussion and that \r\nthere be greater interaction with troop-contributing \r\ncountries involved in operations authorized by the \r\nCouncil. \r\n My delegation, in any case, appreciates the \r\nimportant role of the Council in the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security, and believes that the \r\nCouncil should strengthen its preventive diplomacy \r\n A/65/PV.48\r\n \r\n19 10-63228 \r\n \r\nactivities before international crises arise and be more \r\nflexible in dealing with them once they do occur. \r\n I should now like to address the question of \r\nSecurity Council reform. \r\n We appreciate your interest, Sir, and that of \r\nAmbassador Tanin — who is once again responsible \r\nfor chairing the intergovernmental negotiations at this \r\nsession — in achieving concrete results during your \r\nrespective mandates. You can count on the full support \r\nof the Spanish delegation in this endeavour. \r\n As I stated at the exploratory meeting held on \r\n21 October, my delegation — along with others of the \r\nUniting for Consensus group — is prepared actively \r\nand constructively to pursue negotiations on the basis \r\nof the revised negotiation text that was submitted to us \r\nby Ambassador Tanin on 27 August. \r\n The word “negotiate” is absolutely key here. It \r\nmeans making concrete proposals that can generate \r\nconsensus, and demonstrating the will to reach a \r\ncompromise solution acceptable to all. Conversely, \r\nnegotiating does not mean reiterating positions that are \r\nsufficiently well known and officially on record, such \r\nas ours, which continues to favour the enlargement of \r\nthe Council exclusively in the category of non-\r\npermanent membership. \r\n I think we need to acknowledge that something is \r\nnot quite right when, three months after the \r\npresentation on 26 May of the first version of the \r\nnegotiating text, we have not been able to shorten its \r\nlength by even a single page. The first revision was 31 \r\npages long, and the second is the same length. \r\nUnfortunately, negotiations remain at an impasse \r\nsimilar to that which existed before we had a \r\nnegotiating text. \r\n Since we cannot put the blame on the Open-\r\nended Working Group or, I imagine, on the former \r\nPresident of the General Assembly or on Ambassador \r\nTanin and his team, we are compelled to acknowledge \r\nthat the full responsibility falls entirely to us. However, \r\nalthough responsibility for the impasse is undoubtedly \r\na collective one, it is not exactly the same for all. I \r\nthink we need to recall that the Uniting for Consensus \r\ngroup was the only group to submit concrete \r\namendments to the first revision, merging several of \r\nour proposals into a single one that was included in the \r\nsecond. We also remain the only group that has \r\nproposed an alternative model, demonstrating our \r\nreadiness to explore the so-called intermediate model \r\nby adopting some of its elements, such as the creation \r\nof longer-term seats for non-permanent members and \r\nthe inclusion of the review concept at the end of a \r\ncertain period of time. Neither of these was part of the \r\nmodel we proposed in 2005. \r\n After five rounds of negotiations, we believe that \r\nthe time has come for other groups to follow suit. In \r\nany case, we have the mandate to immediately continue \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, as set out in decision \r\n64/568, which I recall was adopted by consensus on 13 \r\nSeptember. Accordingly, my delegation would like to \r\nsee a road map, provided well in advance, for the sixth \r\nround of negotiations that would include the dates of \r\nand topics for each meeting. We would also like to \r\nknow if consultations will be held prior to the next \r\nround. If they are, we would like to be reassured that \r\nthe consultations will not become negotiations held at \r\nthe margins of the informal plenary of the General \r\nAssembly. \r\n Mr. Askarov (Uzbekistan), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair. \r\n Along with the road map, we attach great \r\nimportance to scrupulous adherence to the rules of the \r\ngame for the negotiations that were set out in General \r\nAssembly decisions 62/557, 63/565 and 64/568. I \r\nwould like to refer to the following three such rules in \r\nparticular. \r\n First is the comprehensive nature of Security \r\nCouncil reform and the indissoluble interlinkage \r\namong its five key issues. It is essential for the \r\nnegotiations to continue to include these five issues \r\nwithout excluding or marginalizing any of them. \r\n Second is the open, transparent and inclusive \r\ncharacter of the negotiations, including, as the case \r\nmay be, possible consultations prior to the beginning of \r\na new round. It is essential that no delegation be left \r\nout or any proposal excluded. I take this opportunity to \r\nrecall that this is the first time that the General \r\nAssembly is addressing the issue of Security Council \r\nreform in plenary since the entry into force of the \r\nLisbon Treaty. My delegation will endeavour — we \r\nhope, with others — to promote a model of reform that \r\nwill be fully consistent with the legitimate aspirations \r\nenshrined in the Treaty, giving preference to the \r\ngeneral interest of all States members of the European \r\nUnion over the particular interests of any single \r\nmember State. \r\nA/65/PV.48  \r\n \r\n10-63228 20 \r\n \r\n Third is the membership-driven aspect of the \r\nnegotiations. It is essential that all initiatives always \r\ncome from Member States or be unequivocally \r\nendorsed by them. In short, my delegation cannot \r\naccept that the rules of the game be changed mid-game, \r\neven if it is argued that this would benefit the \r\nnegotiations. \r\n To conclude, I reiterate my invitation to the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly to play a proactive \r\nrole in monitoring the negotiations, complementing \r\nand strengthening the work of Ambassador Tanin, just \r\nas he did at the meeting of 21 October, which he \r\nattended from beginning to end. That would be the best \r\nway to help us fulfil the obligation he assigned to us to \r\nobtain concrete results by the conclusion of the current \r\nsession. \r\n Mr. Araud (France) (spoke in French): I thank \r\nthe Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom, \r\nin his capacity as President of the Security Council, for \r\npresenting the Council’s annual report to the General \r\nAssembly (A/65/2). The improved quality of the \r\nSecurity Council’s annual reports is evidence of \r\nimprovements in its working methods in terms of \r\nincreased transparency and improved interaction with \r\nall States Members of our Organization. \r\n France is mindful of those aspects of the Security \r\nCouncil’s necessary evolution and emphasizes the \r\nother issues that must be addressed if the Council is \r\nfinally to enter the twenty-first century: regional \r\nrepresentation, membership categories and size. \r\n It is well known that France is committed to \r\nachieving an ambitious reform of the Security Council \r\nthat would allow the Council to strengthen its \r\neffectiveness and make it more representative. Areas of \r\nconvergence became apparent in the work carried out \r\nunder the leadership of Ambassador Tanin, the chair of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations at the sixty-fourth \r\nsession of the General Assembly. An expansion of the \r\nSecurity Council in the two categories of membership \r\nis one area attracting increasing support. We must work \r\non these areas of convergence in order to launch \r\ngenuine negotiations and to avoid getting bogged down \r\nin successive unilateral statements. \r\n We must build on the progress represented by the \r\ndocument drawn up at the sixty-fourth session thanks \r\nto the facilitator’s efforts. It is now time to work \r\ntowards achieving a shorter and more functional text \r\nthat will allow us to engage fully in genuine \r\nnegotiations before the end of the year. We therefore \r\nurge Ambassador Tanin to do his utmost to achieve this \r\nobjective by the end of the year. \r\n Fundamentally, Security Council reform must \r\ntake into account the emergence of new Powers that \r\nwant to assume the responsibility of a permanent seat \r\non the Security Council and that are, in accordance \r\nwith the United Nations Charter, able to make a \r\nsignificant contribution to the Council’s maintenance \r\nof international peace and security. With that in mind, \r\nwe support the accession of Germany, Brazil, India and \r\nJapan to permanent membership. We also support an \r\nincreased presence of African countries on the Security \r\nCouncil, particularly among its permanent members. \r\nThe question of an Arab State among the permanent \r\nmembers of the Security Council is also to be \r\naddressed. \r\n However, if we do not achieve real progress at \r\nthe sixty-fifth session; that is, if there are no \r\nnegotiations — and this is a juncture we have not yet \r\nreached — we must face that reality and consider the \r\ninterim stage of reform jointly proposed by the \r\nPresident of France and the British Prime Minister. \r\nSome people have asked us — and some have asked \r\nhere today — to define the parameters of that proposal. \r\nMy delegation believes firmly that these parameters \r\nmust emerge from negotiation and that they cannot be \r\nprescribed but must be fully embraced by all Members. \r\nFirst, a consensus must emerge whereby this Assembly \r\ncommits to the path of negotiating an interim reform. \r\nWere that to happen, I am convinced that those States \r\noperating in good faith would be able to generate the \r\nworking documents needed for the task. \r\n We know everyone’s positions, having heard \r\nthem many times and having heard them yet again this \r\nmorning. Nevertheless, we face a clear choice. Either \r\nwe pursue this fruitless rehashing and Security Council \r\nreform will die a slow death, to the satisfaction of \r\nsome and the detriment of all; or, conversely, we start \r\nnegotiations. It is a question of political will. France \r\ncalls on the Assembly today to make this decision, as \r\nwe have done before at the highest levels of State, \r\nincluding the President of the Republic. \r\n Mr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): The Russian delegation welcomes the \r\nconvening of today’s meeting of the General Assembly, \r\nwhich gives all Member States an opportunity to \r\n A/65/PV.48\r\n \r\n21 10-63228 \r\n \r\ndiscuss the work of the Council over the year and to \r\ndiscuss questions of its reform. \r\n We thank the President of the Security Council, \r\nthe Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom, \r\nSir Mark Lyall Grant, for introducing the annual report \r\nof the Security Council (A/65/2). We also thank the \r\ndelegation of Nigeria, which has done a great deal of \r\nwork in putting together and preparing the document. \r\nWe believe that overall it objectively reflects the \r\nmomentum of the work of the Council in the past year. \r\nThe fact that the Council, as in previous years, has \r\nbeen actively involved in dealing with important \r\nproblems in the area of security shows that the \r\ninternational community is adhering to the \r\nirreplaceable principle of the unique legitimacy of \r\nSecurity Council decisions, which are fundamental to \r\nsettling issues of international peace and security. \r\n The purpose of the Council’s reports is to give a \r\nholistic and factually accurate idea of the work of the \r\nCouncil for the year. The current report fully rises to \r\nthat challenge. In terms of specific approaches of \r\nCouncil members to different issues on the agenda, \r\nMember States have many other opportunities to \r\ninform themselves, including by visiting the Council’s \r\nnumerous open meetings. \r\n Along with improving the format and content of \r\nSecurity Council reports, positive evolutions in the \r\nworking methods of the Council continue and its \r\npractice of holding open debates and briefings has \r\nexpanded. An important milestone in this regard was \r\nthe Council’s adoption in July of the revised \r\npresidential note (S/2010/507, annex). The note \r\nreflected an array of new elements in the work of the \r\nCouncil, including enshrining the intent of its members \r\nto invite, as needed, the chairs of the country \r\nconfigurations of the Peacebuilding Commission to \r\nparticipate in official meetings of the Council in order \r\nto consider the relevant countries’ situations. It also \r\ncalls for their participation in an exchange of views \r\nwith Council members in informal dialogue. \r\n The Russian delegation is of the view that the \r\nwork of the Council must in future maintain a \r\nreasonable balance between transparency and \r\neffectiveness, in the understanding that the important \r\nthing is to build the Council’s capacity to discharge its \r\nCharter responsibilities to maintain international peace \r\nand security. \r\n We favour a further deepening of interaction \r\nbetween the Security Council and the General \r\nAssembly. In this area, we need to focus on those \r\nspheres in which real cooperation between these two \r\nmain organs of the United Nations is not only possible \r\nbut necessary, on the basis of mutual acknowledgement \r\nof their respective authorities. \r\n As a permanent member of the Council, Russia \r\nhas consistently called for enhancing the effectiveness \r\nof the Council’s work, including by making it more \r\nrepresentative. However, efforts in this direction must \r\nnot have a negative impact on the Council’s \r\nfunctionality. We are in favour of maintaining a \r\ncompact membership of the Council, and we are \r\nconvinced that ideas that would lead to an infringement \r\nof the prerogatives of current permanent members, \r\nincluding the veto, would be counterproductive. \r\n It is our view that the final formula for Security \r\nCouncil reform must be based on the broadest possible \r\nsupport of the membership. The proposed models of \r\nCouncil reform have not enjoyed such report to date. It \r\nis therefore necessary at this session of the General \r\nAssembly to continue our negotiating work to bring \r\npositions closer together. We anticipate that the efforts \r\nof the President of the General Assembly and the work \r\nof the negotiations’ facilitator, the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Afghanistan, Ambassador Tanin, will \r\nbe aimed first and foremost at providing as much \r\nassistance as possible in achieving this goal, in the \r\nunderstanding that the ownership of the negotiating \r\nprocess must remain with the Member States \r\nthemselves. This work must be conducted in a \r\ntransparent and inclusive manner, without artificial \r\ntimelines. How far we advance in the talks will depend \r\non the political will and readiness of States to achieve a \r\nreasonable and effective compromise. \r\n Mr. Nishida (Japan): I would like to thank the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly for convening \r\ntoday’s plenary meeting to discuss the report of the \r\nSecurity Council (A/65/2) and Security Council \r\nreform. I would also like to extend my appreciation to \r\nAmbassador Mark Lyall Grant of the United Kingdom \r\nfor introducing the report in his capacity as President \r\nof the Council. \r\n It was indeed fortunate that President Deiss chose \r\nglobal governance as the theme for the general debate \r\nof the current session in September. During the debate, \r\nall Member States responded positively to this theme \r\nA/65/PV.48  \r\n \r\n10-63228 22 \r\n \r\nand reaffirmed that the United Nations is the central \r\nforum for global governance. In this regard, it was very \r\ntimely that he convened and presided over the first \r\nmeeting of the intergovernmental negotiations of the \r\ncurrent session on 21 October, in accordance with \r\ndecision 64/568. At that meeting, his appointment of \r\nAmbassador Zahir Tanin to chair the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on his behalf was endorsed by Member \r\nStates. Japan welcomes the President’s strong interest \r\nin this issue. We trust that he and Ambassador Tanin \r\nwill exercise strong leadership in guiding us towards \r\nproducing substantive results during this session. \r\n The Security Council must reflect the political \r\nrealities of the twenty-first century. The Council has \r\nbeen reformed only once, more than 45 years ago, to \r\nincrease the number of non-permanent members from 6 \r\nto 10. The membership of the United Nations has \r\nexpanded by approximately 65 per cent since then. The \r\nnumber of Member States, especially from Asia and \r\nAfrica, has increased dramatically during these years. \r\n Reform of the Security Council is long overdue. \r\nOur political leaders recognized this in the Millennium \r\nDeclaration (resolution 55/2) in 2000, and again in the \r\n2005 World Summit Outcome Document (resolution \r\n60/1). During the general debate of the sixty-fifth \r\nsession in September, the majority of political leaders \r\nof Member States stressed that urgent reforms, \r\nincluding reform of the Security Council, need to be \r\nundertaken to ensure that the Organization is able to \r\nfulfil its responsibilities. \r\n At the first meeting of the negotiations on 21 \r\nOctober, almost all permanent representatives \r\nreiterated the necessity of early reform of the Security \r\nCouncil. While on his visit to Japan in the last week of \r\nOctober, President Deiss also emphasized repeatedly \r\nthat a strong United Nations requires a decisive effort \r\nto reform the Security Council, among other organs. \r\n We believe that realizing early reform of the \r\nSecurity Council will require political will and high-\r\nlevel action on the part of Member States. To that end, \r\nthe Foreign Ministers of the Group of Four met in New \r\nYork on 24 September for an exchange of views on \r\nSecurity Council reform. We committed ourselves to \r\ncontinuing to participate actively in the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations and to work in \r\ncooperation with other countries with a view to \r\nachieving concrete results during the current session. \r\n Japan’s position is that the Security Council must \r\nbe reformed through modifications that include the \r\nexpansion of both the permanent and non-permanent \r\ncategories of membership, as well as improvement in \r\nthe Council’s working methods, so as to make the body \r\nmore broadly representative, legitimate, effective and \r\nresponsive to the realities of the current international \r\ncommunity. \r\n An enlarged Security Council should include, on \r\na permanent basis, those Member States that have \r\ndemonstrated well the readiness, capacity and \r\nresources to play an important role in the Security \r\nCouncil in the twenty-first century. In the general \r\ndebate on 24 September, Prime Minister Naoto Kan \r\nconfirmed this goal by stressing Japan’s determined \r\naspiration to take on further responsibilities for \r\ninternational peace and security as a permanent \r\nmember of the Security Council (see A/65/PV.14). \r\n Now is the time to move to the next phase in the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. In this round, we \r\nshould not permit ourselves to simply continue \r\ndebating and repeating what transpired in the previous \r\nfive rounds. Japan, for its part, will spare no effort to \r\nhelp accelerate the work in order to produce, by the \r\nend of this year, a revised negotiating text that is more \r\nconcise and useful for negotiation purposes. Japan has \r\nalready begun and continues to engage more actively \r\nwith other delegations, including those of African \r\nStates, in a flexible manner in order to prepare the \r\nground for concrete action with a view to achieving \r\ntangible results during the current session. \r\n If we continue to defer reform and the current \r\ncomposition of the Security Council remains \r\nunchanged, we are concerned that not only the ability \r\nof the United Nations to carry out self-reform but also \r\nthe Council’s legitimacy will be increasingly \r\nquestioned. Security Council reform is not simply a \r\nmatter of concern for a small number of Member \r\nStates. This task is a common responsibility of those of \r\nus representing Member States now on behalf of \r\ngenerations to come. \r\n Even after the Security Council has been \r\nexpanded, it will continue to make decisions that have \r\nan impact on the wider membership of the United \r\nNations, with a limited number of countries \r\nparticipating in the decision-making process. The \r\nworking methods of the Security Council are therefore \r\ncrucial to its effective functioning, and enhancing the \r\n A/65/PV.48\r\n \r\n23 10-63228 \r\n \r\nCouncil’s transparency, efficiency and interaction with \r\nnon-Council members benefits Council members and \r\nnon-members alike. Such efforts are essential if the \r\nSecurity Council is to fulfil its responsibility to act \r\npromptly and effectively in favour of international \r\npeace and security. \r\n The Security Council has been conducting an \r\nongoing discussion on the improvement of its working \r\nmethods. During Japan’s presidency in April, the \r\nSecurity Council held an open debate on working \r\nmethods. While noting the improvements made in \r\nrecent years, most non-members called for further \r\nenhancement, transparency and interaction with the \r\nwider membership. Taking note of the views expressed \r\nby Member States during the open debate, the Informal \r\nWorking Group on Documentation and Other \r\nProcedural Questions, which I currently chair, worked \r\nto revise the presidential note on working methods \r\n(S/2006/507). The revised presidential note \r\n(S/2010/507) was adopted by the Council on 27 July. \r\nThe new note accurately reflects the current procedures \r\nand practices of the Council. \r\n The revised note also clarifies the guidelines for \r\nthe preparation of the annual report under the \r\nleadership of the President of the Council for the \r\nmonth of July of each calendar year. Japan welcomes \r\nthe fact that the annual report of the Security Council \r\nwas prepared in line with the revised presidential note. \r\nWe commend the efforts made by Nigeria to interact \r\nwith non-members in the preparation of the annual \r\nreport for this year. Such interaction has been \r\nincreasing in recent years. We also welcome the fact \r\nthat the improvements in the Council’s working \r\nmethods achieved during the reporting period were \r\ndescribed for the first time in the introduction of the \r\nannual report. \r\n I would like to conclude by reiterating Japan’s \r\ncontinuing commitment to improving the working \r\nmethods of the Council. \r\n Mr. Li Baodong (China) (spoke in Chinese): I \r\nwould like to thank the Permanent Representative of \r\nthe United Kingdom for his briefing on behalf of the \r\nSecurity Council on the annual report of the Security \r\nCouncil to the General Assembly (A/65/2). I would \r\nalso like to thank Nigeria and the Secretariat for their \r\nefforts in drafting the report. \r\n The United Nations Charter entrusts the Security \r\nCouncil with the primary responsibility for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. Over \r\nthe past year, the Council has been committed to the \r\npeace and reconstruction process in Afghanistan, Iraq \r\nand Haiti, and ensured the smooth transition from \r\npeacekeeping to peacebuilding in countries such as the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone and \r\nTimor-Leste. It has supported the deployment of \r\npeacekeepers in the Sudan and pushed for the political \r\nprocess in Darfur. The Council has supported \r\npreventive diplomacy and the settlement of disputes \r\nthrough peaceful means, such as good offices, \r\nmediation, dialogue and consultation. \r\n The Council has made ongoing efforts to combat \r\nterrorism and prevent the proliferation of weapons of \r\nmass destruction and transnational organized crime. It \r\nattaches importance to strengthened cooperation with \r\nregional and subregional organizations and protection \r\nof the rights and interests of women and children in \r\narmed conflict. \r\n Nevertheless, the Middle East peace process still \r\nfaces severe challenges and the situation in Somalia \r\nremains unstable. The Security Council needs to play a \r\nbigger role in some long-standing hotspot issues. \r\n Improving the working methods of the Security \r\nCouncil and increasing its transparency will enable the \r\nCouncil to better carry out its responsibilities. The \r\nCouncil has made efforts in this regard, such as \r\nholding more open meetings and debates, strengthening \r\nits communication with the General Assembly, the \r\nEconomic and Social Council and other main organs \r\nand agencies of the United Nations, and increasing \r\nexchanges with non-Council members and countries \r\ncontributing troops to peacekeeping operations. The \r\nInformal Working Group on Documentation and Other \r\nProcedural Questions has made a contribution in this \r\narea. China supports the further improvement of the \r\nSecurity Council’s working methods. \r\n The international community is now faced with \r\nincreasing common challenges in the areas of peace \r\nand security. We hope that the Council will put greater \r\nemphasis on Africa’s requests and support the efforts \r\nof the African Union to maintain peace and security on \r\nthe continent. The Council needs to make better use of \r\npeaceful means, such as good offices and mediation, to \r\nprevent conflicts and turmoil, reform and improve \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations, and support \r\npost-conflict peacebuilding so as to make a greater \r\ncontribution to international peace and security. \r\nA/65/PV.48  \r\n \r\n10-63228 24 \r\n \r\n China supports a necessary and reasonable reform \r\nof the Security Council. The reform should include not \r\nonly an expansion of the Council’s membership, but \r\nalso an improvement in its working methods. The \r\nreform should help improve the authority and \r\nefficiency of the Council and enable it to fulfil more \r\neffectively the responsibilities entrusted to it by the \r\nUnited Nations Charter. Security Council reform \r\nshould give top priority to increasing the representation \r\nof developing countries, in particular that of African \r\ncountries, and give more small and medium-sized \r\ncountries access to the Council and its decision-making \r\nprocess. \r\n Security Council reform is a complex and \r\ndifficult project to engineer, as it involves the future of \r\nthe United Nations and the immediate interests of all \r\nMember States. Member States are still divided over \r\nthe approaches to the reform. It is necessary to \r\npersevere with democratic and patient consultations \r\nand to meet each other halfway. China is opposed to \r\nsetting artificial time limits. \r\n The five clusters of issues concerning Security \r\nCouncil reform are closely interlinked and should not \r\nbe addressed in isolation. There has to be a package \r\nsolution to the reform. A piecemeal or step-by-step \r\napproach will lead nowhere. China supports continued \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform and appreciates the efforts made by President \r\nDeiss and Ambassador Tanin, chair of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. \r\n We hope that the Assembly will, pursuant to \r\ndecision 62/557, continue at this session to conduct \r\nmember-driven intergovernmental negotiations in \r\naccordance with the principles of openness, \r\ntransparency and inclusiveness, and make vigorous \r\nefforts to seek a solution that garners general \r\nagreement among Member States and that serves the \r\ncommon interests of Member States and the long-term \r\ninterests of the United Nations. \r\n Mrs. Aitimova (Kazakhstan): The delegation of \r\nKazakhstan would like to thank the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly for organizing once again this joint \r\ngeneral debate to discuss such important issues as the \r\nreport of the Security Council (A/65/2) and item 119 \r\non the question of equitable representation on and \r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council and \r\nrelated matters. \r\n I would like to express our gratitude to the \r\nSecurity Council and the United Kingdom for \r\nproviding us with a comprehensive overview of the \r\ngrowing number of immediate and long-term strategic \r\nand operational activities and questions, as well as \r\nthematic and general issues, that go beyond \r\ngeopolitical conflicts to global peace and security \r\nconcerns. We note with satisfaction the new areas \r\nencompassed by the Council’s subsidiary organs and \r\nworking groups and its cooperation with regional and \r\nsubregional organizations to accomplish its mandate. \r\n The rapid augmentation of the Council’s scope, \r\nfocus and activities, impacting all regions and \r\npopulations of the world, obliges the international \r\ncommunity to speedily reform that key organ of the \r\nUnited Nations. It is evident that there is a close \r\nconnection between the effective implementation of its \r\nmandate, on the one hand, and the issues of equitable \r\ngeographical representation, categories of membership \r\nand the veto right, more efficient working methods and \r\nthe relationship with the General Assembly, on the \r\nother. \r\n It was three years ago that the General Assembly \r\nadopted the historic decision 62/557 to commence \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on the reform process, \r\nand we commend the efforts of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, under the chairmanship of the \r\nAmbassador of Afghanistan, Mr. Zahir Tanin, in this \r\ndirection. \r\n The commitment of Member States to \r\nunanimously agreeing to start discussions on five \r\nmajor reform issues marks an important milestone and \r\ncalls for greater political will to make the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations successful. The \r\nCouncil’s accountability to the General Assembly is \r\nclear, as stated in Article 24 of the Charter. We \r\ntherefore reiterate calls by Member States for greater \r\ntransparency and the wider participation of the general \r\nmembership in peace and security issues. \r\n Kazakhstan once again confirms its commitment \r\nto reform of the United Nations, and primarily the \r\nCouncil in terms of increasing its membership in the \r\ncategories of permanent and non-permanent members \r\nso as to enhance regional representation. My \r\ndelegation reconfirms its position on increasing the \r\nCouncil’s membership from the existing number of 15 \r\nto 25 by establishing six permanent and four non-\r\npermanent Security Council seats. \r\n A/65/PV.48\r\n \r\n25 10-63228 \r\n \r\n The present procedure of the negotiation process \r\ncalls for a new intermediate formula to bridge the \r\ndivergence between the majority of Member States \r\nfavouring an increase of the Council in both categories \r\nand the Uniting for Consensus group, which insists on \r\nexpanding only the category of non-permanent seats. It \r\nis thus advisable to examine this intermediate strategy \r\nin a spirit of compromise and inclusiveness during the \r\nongoing negotiation process, rather than start a fresh \r\nround of negotiations. \r\n We propose that new permanent members be \r\ngranted the veto right only after an assessment of their \r\nwork and contribution to peace and security through an \r\nongoing mandatory review at the Conference; but their \r\nentry should not be delayed for too long. \r\n The Council has repeatedly proven its inability, \r\nbased on its structure and working methods, to agree \r\non common action in military conflicts and sudden \r\nemergencies with far-reaching humanitarian or security \r\nimplications for the international community. We need \r\nto strengthen the cooperation modalities between the \r\nCouncil and the Assembly, which by definition is a \r\nmore democratic body representing the interests of all \r\nMember States, in order to facilitate more informed \r\ndecisions and actions by the Council. \r\n We welcome the measure to increase the number \r\nof open meetings of the Security Council and to reduce \r\nits closed meetings, but we also expect greater \r\ntransparency. Currently, non-member States invest \r\nmuch time and effort in seeking vital information about \r\nclosed consultations from external sources. The data \r\nculled may be too late, not available at all, or \r\ninappropriate. Non-members of the Security Council \r\nneed to know first-hand the deliberations, decisions \r\nand positions of each Council member on subjects \r\nconsidered so that our Governments can more \r\nappropriately decide on State policies and actions, \r\nthereby strengthening the Security Council’s authority \r\nand the public’s trust in its mandate. \r\n However, there remains the potential threat of \r\nreaching a deadlock in the Security Council reform \r\ndeliberations, which my delegation would like to avert \r\nat all costs. Hence, commencing discussions on the \r\npaper by including in it each proposal of every \r\nMember State without exception could lead to \r\ninnovative ideas and a compromise decision reached by \r\nthe maximum possible majority. \r\n To conclude, I would like to express once again \r\nthe readiness of Kazakhstan to work with other \r\nMember States to reach an agreement on United \r\nNations reforms, with reform of the Security Council at \r\nits core. \r\n Mrs. Viotti (Brazil): This year’s debate on the \r\nannual report of the Security Council (A/65/2) and on \r\nSecurity Council reform has special meaning for my \r\ndelegation. Brazil has had the honour to serve on the \r\nCouncil as a non-permanent member for seven of the \r\n12 months covered by the report before us. During \r\nsuch time, we have striven to honour the trust the \r\nmembership placed on us last November. \r\n As in previous mandates, we have been active \r\nand constructive in all items on the Security Council’s \r\nagenda. We have also been consistently and firmly \r\nindependent, while willing to cooperate with other \r\ndelegations and compromise when needed and \r\nwarranted. We have also remained attentive to the \r\nneeds and interests of the wider membership. \r\n An important aspect of our work on the Security \r\nCouncil has been helping to improve the Council’s \r\nworking methods in order to make the organ more \r\ntransparent and accessible. We actively supported the \r\nrevision of presidential note S/2006/507, which \r\nconsolidates some relatively recent efforts of the \r\nCouncil to meaningfully interact with Member States. \r\nAmong them, I would single out the informal \r\ninteractive dialogues and the possibility of inviting the \r\nChairs of the Peacebuilding Commission to pertinent \r\ninformal consultations. Brazil will continue to work for \r\nconcrete and effective reforms in the working methods \r\nof the Council. \r\n Our experience in the Security Council has made \r\neven clearer to us the urgent need to expand the \r\nCouncil in both categories of its membership. It has \r\nalso become evident that we need to increase the \r\nparticipation of developed and developing countries \r\nalike, including African countries. Only such a reform \r\nwill enable the Council to preserve and enhance its \r\nlegitimacy and effectiveness, while increasing \r\ntransparency and access to non-members. Fortunately, \r\nthe overwhelming majority of the membership has \r\nalready identified that need. For almost two years now, \r\nunder the wise and able guidance of our facilitator, \r\nAmbassador Zahir Tanin, we have exhaustively \r\nexchanged views on Security Council reform. It has \r\nbecome clear that most Member States favour the \r\nA/65/PV.48  \r\n \r\n10-63228 26 \r\n \r\nexpansion of the Council in both categories of \r\nmembership. \r\n It is also evident that the mere addition of non-\r\npermanent members, even if their terms were longer \r\nthan the current two years, would only preserve the \r\nstatus quo. Notwithstanding the very important \r\ncontribution that non-permanent members have made \r\nand continue to make to the Council — and I thank the \r\nPermanent Representative of Italy for noting our \r\nappreciation for their role — true reform of the Council \r\nrequires the establishment of new permanent members \r\ncommitted to such reform. \r\n Our experience also shows that we need to \r\nexpand the set of perspectives and positions \r\nrepresented in the Security Council in order to better \r\nunderstand and effectively cope with challenges to the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. We \r\nmust therefore see the number of seats increase to \r\naround 25 or 26 — numbers that seem to accommodate \r\nall those perspectives. Let me add that we also concur \r\nwith the Permanent Representative of Italy on the \r\nadvisability of reviewing the situation created by the \r\nreform, and that is why the Group of Four (G-4) \r\nproposal includes a review clause after a period of \r\n15 years. \r\n At the sixty-fourth session, at the request of an \r\noverwhelming majority, the Chair of the negotiations \r\nprovided us with a negotiating text that includes all \r\npositions presented by Member States and which has \r\nbeen accepted by all. The present session has had an \r\nauspicious start. We warmly welcome the prompt \r\nresumption of the intergovernmental negotiations in the \r\ninformal plenary of this Assembly, and the \r\nreappointment of Ambassador Zahir Tanin as facilitator \r\nof the process. \r\n We cannot spend yet another year on statements. \r\nDecisive progress must be made during the current \r\nsession, for we cannot afford to waste the momentum \r\ngained last year and the current favourable juncture, \r\nwhich includes Mr. Deiss’s presidency. We reiterate our \r\ncall for a streamlined negotiating text that is more \r\nworkable and operational. We continue to believe that \r\nMr. Deiss’s leadership and initiative, given his \r\nauthority and impartiality, would be crucial to the \r\npreparation of such a document and for its wide \r\nacceptance. \r\n Brazil and its G-4 partners are willing to heed the \r\ncall from the President and Ambassador Tanin for more \r\ninteraction among Member States. During the \r\nfollowing month, we will be reaching out to fellow \r\ndelegations seeking ways to bridge the gaps between \r\nthe various positions. The G-4 itself renewed its \r\ncommitment to the process and reaffirmed its unity of \r\npurpose in a ministerial meeting held last September in \r\nNew York. \r\n My delegation has always engaged in the \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform with an open \r\nmind and with determination. We will continue to do \r\nso. \r\n Mr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): We welcome \r\nthis opportunity to discuss two closely interlinked \r\ntopics: the report of the Security Council (A/65/2) and \r\nthe question of its reform. As a member of the group of \r\nfive small nations (S-5), we fully associate ourselves \r\nwith the statement made by Switzerland earlier today. \r\nWe are grateful to the President for his personal \r\nengagement in the reform process, to Ambassador \r\nTanin for his continued efforts in leading the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, and to the current \r\nPresident of the Security Council, Ambassador Lyall \r\nGrant, for introducing the report of the Council. \r\n We believe that the United Nations Charter \r\nestablishes a relationship of accountability between the \r\nCouncil and the membership of the Organization, on \r\nwhose behalf the Council carries out its functions. The \r\nconsideration of the Council’s annual report is \r\ntherefore one of the most important elements in that \r\nrelationship. The ritualistic and highly repetitive \r\nmanner in which the report is considered year after \r\nyear does not do justice to the opportunity we have and \r\nto the role which the report could and should play — as \r\nan opportunity to reflect on the overall performance of \r\nthe Organization in the area of peace and security. \r\n The task of making the debate more meaningful \r\nrests both with the Council — in particular, by offering \r\na report that can serve as a basis for a substantive \r\npolitical discussion — and the rest of the United \r\nNations membership, which should engage in a \r\nsubstantive discussion instead of stereotypical criticism \r\nof the report. We hope that this year’s debate and its \r\naftermath can mark the beginning of more fruitful \r\ndiscussion. \r\n A/65/PV.48\r\n \r\n27 10-63228 \r\n \r\n The S-5 has made several concrete proposals to \r\nstrengthen the format and content of the report, the \r\nprocess in which it is drafted and the format of its \r\nconsideration by the wider membership. We will \r\ncontinue to work in that spirit and make positive \r\ncontributions. We note with appreciation some \r\nimprovements that have been made in the format of the \r\nreport, such as the reflection of majority and minority \r\nviews of States in the summaries of some debates, \r\nwhich is a helpful practice that should be expanded to \r\nall summaries. We are also pleased that the updated \r\nnote by the President of the Security Council \r\n(S/2010/507) formalizes the process leading to the \r\nproduction of the report’s introduction. \r\n In that context, we take note of the consultations \r\nwith the wider membership conducted in advance of \r\nthe report’s production. That practice should be \r\ncombined with a further informal consultation once the \r\ndraft report is available. We also reiterate our view that \r\nthe report should try to reflect the cross-cutting impact \r\nof thematic issues, which would be an important \r\nimprovement, not just for the format of the report, but \r\nbecause it would likely help the Council to overcome \r\none of the weaknesses of its daily work, since the \r\nreflection of decisions on thematic issues remains one \r\nof the big challenges for the Council. \r\n Finally, we note the link between the monthly \r\nassessments by Council Presidents and the introduction \r\nof the report, which is a welcome development that \r\nenables each Council member to positively influence \r\nthe quality of the report by submitting an analytical \r\nassessment at the close of its presidency. \r\n The S-5 has welcomed the updating of the note \r\nby the President of the Security Council contained in \r\ndocument S/2010/507, in particular, some of the new \r\nelements such as guidance for Security Council \r\nmissions and interactive debates. The note is thus a \r\nuseful compilation of the tools available to the \r\nCouncil. At the same time, it does not address some \r\nimportant subjects that we have been raising for a \r\nnumber of years and it also does not provide any \r\nmechanisms for the consistent implementation of the \r\nmeasures contained in the note itself. Indeed, document \r\nS/2010/507 should therefore not be the end, but rather \r\nthe end of the beginning of the process to improve \r\nworking methods. \r\n We look forward to continuing working directly \r\nwith the Council, the Informal Working Group on \r\nDocumentation and Other Procedural Questions, and \r\nwish, of course, in the framework of the reform process \r\nin the General Assembly plenary, to make the Council \r\nand its work more accountable, more legitimate and \r\nmore transparent, as our leaders decided at the summit \r\nmeeting in 2005. We are grateful to those Council \r\nmembers who share the view that improving the \r\nworking methods of the Council will help improve its \r\nstanding. In that respect, we warmly welcome the \r\ninnovations announced by the United Kingdom on the \r\nassumption of its presidency this month. It is our hope \r\nthat subsequent presidencies will also explore \r\ninnovative approaches. \r\n There is a substantive linkage between working \r\nmethods and the enlargement of the Council, although \r\nprogress on the former does not depend on a decision \r\nwith respect to the latter. In the end, the enlargement of \r\nthe Council is done through a set of amendments to the \r\nUnited Nations Charter, while working methods are \r\nimproved through an ongoing process. \r\n We continue to believe that the current \r\ncomposition of the Council is neither a faithful \r\nreflection of the membership of the Organization nor of \r\ntoday’s geopolitical realities. Enlarging the Council is \r\nthus both necessary and urgent. That is why, a while \r\nback, we submitted an intermediate solution as a \r\npossible way out of the deadlock created by the well-\r\nknown positions on the table. For ease of reference, we \r\nhave attached a copy of our model of an intermediate \r\nsolution to hard copies of my statement being \r\ndistributed this morning. \r\n The proposed solution would create a new \r\ncategory of seats, allowing Member States to serve for \r\nlonger terms — for example, for 8 or 10 years — to \r\nstand for immediate re-election and thus to serve on a \r\npermanent basis as Council members. After the \r\ncompletion of two terms using the new category of \r\nseats, the new regime would be subject to a review that \r\nwould comprise all essential aspects of Council reform, \r\nbut at the same time would not entail any automaticity \r\nwith regard to substantive outcomes. We are pleased to \r\nsee that intermediate models are also promoted and \r\nexplored by others, and we would be interested in a \r\nprocess that leads to the emergence of a single \r\nintermediate model. \r\n We look forward to Ambassador Tanin’s \r\nleadership in engaging the membership in substantive \r\nnegotiations and will support him in those efforts. \r\nA/65/PV.48  \r\n \r\n10-63228 28 \r\n \r\n Mr. Valero Briceño (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): The Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela associates itself with the \r\nstatement made by the representative of the Arab \r\nRepublic of Egypt in its capacity as the Chair of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement. \r\n The report of the Security Council (A/65/2) raises \r\na variety of concerns, which have already been \r\nmentioned by many delegations. A very important one \r\nis that this organ is increasingly encroaching on issues \r\non the agenda of the General Assembly, thereby \r\nweakening the role that should be played by the \r\ncommunity of nations — the “G-192”. That can be \r\nseen not only with respect to some items on working \r\ngroup agendas, but also in connection with broad \r\nthemes such as violence against children in conflict, \r\nsexual violence against women in conflict, the \r\nprotection of civilians in armed conflict and the issues \r\nof drugs, justice and the rule of law and intercultural \r\ndialogue, among others. \r\n We have no doubt that the Security Council has \r\nhad some success in addressing situations in some \r\ncountries suffering from the scourge of internal \r\nviolence — not infrequently fomented from abroad to \r\nachieve economic gains. However, the Council has \r\noverstepped some of the mandates conferred by \r\nresolutions on peacekeeping operations and has taken \r\non functions having to do, for instance, with reforming \r\nelectoral, judicial, penal and public safety systems, to \r\nname just a few.  \r\n As we move towards rebuilding the United \r\nNations to align it with the demands of the world and \r\nof all the countries that make up this forum, we have to \r\nask ourselves how the Security Council functions and \r\nhow it addresses matters having to do with \r\ninternational peace and security. Developing countries \r\nare sometimes criminalized for alleged lack of respect \r\nfor Security Council resolutions or the Charter, while, \r\nat the same time, by means of the veto, others, which \r\nwith impunity fail to observe the norms of international \r\nlaw, are absolved from their human rights and Geneva \r\nConventions obligations. \r\n The Security Council report does not include \r\nmany of the observations that numerous non-members \r\nof the Council have made in open debates on various \r\ntopics on the United Nations agenda. That is the case \r\nwith regard to the fight against terrorism, the situation \r\nin the Middle East and the question of Palestine. It is \r\nnecessary that the United Nations and its organs, in \r\nparticular the Security Council, implement a strategy to \r\npreserve peace and security that reflects the interests of \r\nall the countries and peoples of the world. \r\n We express our appreciation to the President of \r\nthe General Assembly for his interest in moving \r\nforward with an issue of such crucial importance as the \r\nreform of the Security Council, and that of the United \r\nNations as a whole. We also commend the performance \r\nof Ambassador Zahir Tanin, Permanent Representative \r\nof Afghanistan, as facilitator of the informal \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. In accordance with \r\nGeneral Assembly decisions 62/557, 63/565 and \r\n64/568, we must move forward so that, in the near \r\nfuture, we can have a Security Council that is more \r\ndemocratic and more transparent, and therefore more \r\nlegitimate. \r\n For Venezuela, the issues of equitable \r\nrepresentation on the Security Council, increasing its \r\nmembership and related matters are closely related to \r\nthe Organization’s ability to fully fulfil the purposes \r\nand principles enshrined in the Charter. In that regard, \r\nthere is a need for progress in the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, which have already produced a document \r\nsetting out the positions of Member States. We \r\nappreciate the work of Ambassador Tanin in compiling \r\nthat document. It is now necessary to move towards a \r\nsynthesis that encompasses the majority positions in \r\nthe five thematic areas around which the informal \r\nnegotiations have centred. \r\n It is clear that a majority of countries favours \r\nexpanding the Security Council in both the permanent \r\nand the non-permanent categories of membership. \r\nThere is also agreement that expansion should allow \r\nfor the participation of countries from Latin America \r\nand the Caribbean, Africa and Asia in ambits from \r\nwhich, since the San Francisco Conference, they had \r\nbeen excluded. \r\n The path towards rebuilding and democratizing \r\nthe United Nations has been chartered. In order for it to \r\nbe relevant at the present historical juncture, the \r\nOrganization must fairly, effectively and transparently \r\nreflect the interests and needs of the entire \r\ninternational community. There is also consensus on \r\nthe need to make the working methods of the Security \r\nCouncil more transparent. \r\n The desire expressed by many countries to limit \r\nor eliminate the use of the veto in the future has also \r\n A/65/PV.48\r\n \r\n29 10-63228 \r\n \r\nbeen clearly reflected in the compilation prepared by \r\nthe facilitator. It is important to underline that a \r\nmajority of countries supports limitations of one sort or \r\nanother on the use of the veto. This is a laudable \r\nstarting point for forging a common position on that \r\nissue, as well as from the perspective of rebuilding and \r\ndemocratizing the United Nations. Along that path, \r\nVenezuela will continue to stress the need to eliminate \r\nthe veto right per se. \r\n Venezuela is confident that, with the President’s \r\nleadership, we will be able to move forward a process \r\nto reform the Security Council and the United Nations. \r\nWe extend our cooperation in working towards that \r\nend. \r\n Mr. Apakan (Turkey): I would like to begin by \r\nthanking the President of the Assembly for convening \r\nthis joint meeting, which provides yet another \r\nopportunity to reflect on the activities of the Security \r\nCouncil, as well as on the Council’s ongoing reform \r\nprocess. I also wish to express our appreciation to the \r\nUnited Kingdom as President of the Security Council \r\nfor the month of November 2010 for presenting the \r\nannual report of the Council to the General Assembly \r\n(A/65/2). Let me also thank the Permanent Mission of \r\nNigeria for its valuable efforts in preparing the report \r\nand coordinating it with the Member States. \r\n The report provides an accurate account of the \r\nwork of the Security Council and demonstrates the \r\nmultiplicity of the issues that are on its agenda. It also \r\npoints to the heavy workload of the Council, whereby \r\nAfrican issues, particularly in the context of \r\npeacekeeping and peacebuilding efforts, remain at the \r\nforefront. Finally, the report points, albeit indirectly, to \r\nmany of the important challenges that lie ahead for the \r\nCouncil, and indeed for our Organization as a whole. \r\n While the report, as suggested by many other \r\ndelegations, could have been more analytical and less \r\ndescriptive, we are also well aware of the complexities \r\nthat would have rendered such an analytical approach \r\nrather difficult to implement. Having said that, there is \r\nstill much room for further improvement of the \r\nworking methods of the Security Council in order to \r\nenhance its transparency, accountability and \r\ninclusiveness. We will continue to support all efforts to  \r\n \r\nthat end. Member States have recently had ample \r\nopportunity to express their positions on the Security \r\nCouncil reform process. However, as is customary, I \r\nwould also like to briefly touch on Turkey’s position on \r\nCouncil reform. \r\n My country has taken an active part in the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations that began in February \r\n2009. Although the past five rounds of negotiations \r\nhave been useful in examining negotiable aspects and \r\nexploring the basic linkages among them, we believe \r\nthat the membership remains seriously divided on \r\nissues such as categories of membership, regional \r\nrepresentation and the question of the veto. \r\n As a current member of the Council, serving \r\nagain on the Council after almost half a century, \r\nTurkey has benefited immensely from that unique \r\nexperience and responsibility. We believe that that \r\nexperience should not be limited to a small group, but \r\nhas to be available to all aspiring Member States, large \r\nor small, developed or lesser developed. \r\n In particular, those Member States that have the \r\nmeans and capabilities to ensure peace and stability in \r\ntheir region and beyond should be allowed to take a \r\nmore active part in the work of the Council. We are \r\ntherefore supportive of the extended representation of \r\nsuch Member States on the Council. \r\n We also support correction of the historic \r\ninjustice perpetrated against Africa by substantially \r\nimproving the representation of that continent on the \r\nCouncil. \r\n We do not, however, support the expansion of the \r\nCouncil in the permanent category of membership. \r\nAdditional permanent seats, in our view, would not \r\nbide well with the idea of a democratic, accountable \r\nand transparent Council. If the reformed Security \r\nCouncil is to be the Council not only of today, but also \r\nof the future, it is imperative that we all concentrate \r\nour best efforts on proposals that will provide the \r\nCouncil with the necessary flexibility as regards to its \r\ncomposition. Such a Council will be better equipped to \r\neffectively address the multitude of challenges facing \r\nour world. \r\n The meeting rose at 1.05 p.m. \r\n \r\n"
