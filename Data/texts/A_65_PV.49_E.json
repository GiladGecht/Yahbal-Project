(Switzerland) \r\n \r\n \r\n  The meeting was called to order at 3 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\nAgenda items 29 and 119 (continued) \r\n \r\nReport of the Security Council (A/65/2) \r\n \r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and increase \r\nin the membership of the Security Council and \r\nrelated matters \r\n \r\n Mr. De Borja (Philippines): Mr. President, at the \r\noutset, I would like to thank you for putting Security \r\nCouncil reform on the top of your busy agenda. At the \r\nsame time, I wish to congratulate His Excellency \r\nAmbassador Zahir Tanin, Permanent Representative of \r\nAfghanistan, on his reappointment as Chair of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council for the Assembly’s sixty-fifth session. \r\n I also wish to thank His Excellency Ambassador \r\nSir Mark Lyall Grant, Permanent Representative of the \r\nUnited Kingdom and President of the Security Council \r\nfor the month of November, for introducing this \r\nmorning the annual report of the Council (A/65/2), \r\nprepared by Nigeria, on the state of play in the Council \r\n(see A/65/PV.48). \r\n The Philippines aligns itself with the position set \r\nforth by the Permanent Representative of the Arab \r\nRepublic of Egypt who spoke on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement at the 48th meeting. However, \r\nmy delegation wishes to stress several key points. \r\n The Philippine position on this issue is well \r\nknown and remains consistent. Like many Member \r\nStates, the Philippines strongly and constructively \r\nsupports Security Council reform. That position dates \r\nback to the early years of the United Nations when, as \r\na founding Member, the Philippines advocated reforms \r\nin the Council several years after its creation to make it \r\nmore responsive and effective. \r\n Fast forward to the present: the Philippines is one \r\nof the Member States that requested the Chair, after \r\nseveral rounds of talks, to reduce the positions and \r\nviews of the different delegations to writing. We are \r\ntherefore very satisfied that the Chair heeded our call \r\nand ably produced a text that reflects all proposals on \r\nkey issues. Some prefer to call it a compilation text, \r\nwhile others want to call it a negotiation text. Whatever \r\nthe preference may be, it is clear that we now have a \r\nworking draft that can serve as a basis for meaningful \r\nand substantive negotiations in the course of which \r\namendments or revisions may be introduced. \r\n The Philippines is pleased that its proposals on \r\nall key issues are reflected in the text. I would just like \r\nto deal with one Philippine proposal that has caught the \r\ninterest of other delegations, namely, our proposal on \r\nthe size of an enlarged Security Council. Yes, the \r\nPhilippines proposes a Council with 31 members, a \r\nnumber perceived by some as too extreme, if not \r\nwishful thinking. Of course there is a rationale behind \r\nthat number. The size of the future Security Council \r\nmust conform to the principles of equitable \r\ngeographical distribution and balanced regional \r\ndistribution. At the same time, let me add that aside \r\nfrom being futuristic — as that number anticipates the \r\nideal size of the Council in the years and decades to \r\nA/65/PV.49  \r\n \r\n10-63467 2 \r\n \r\ncome — the proposal is democratic and representative \r\nof all States Members of the Organization. \r\n I will not go through the details or elements of \r\nthat proposal due to time constraints. Suffice it to say \r\nthat our delegation believes that if we are given the \r\nopportunity in future negotiations to expound on our \r\nposition on this item, other delegations will give it due \r\nconsideration and a favourable response. \r\n The Philippines recognizes that Security Council \r\nreform is a work in progress and not a quick fix. \r\nHowever, that must not be construed as though the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations should be a never-\r\nending process. Yes, it is imperative to reflect on all \r\nour views and positions — that is part of our \r\ndemocratic procedure — but we should also agree \r\nwhen to stop talking and start negotiating. \r\n We have done sufficient talking already. In \r\nessence, we have to move from rhetoric to action, to sit \r\ndown and negotiate — agree or disagree, as the case \r\nmay be — but at the end of the day, we need to \r\nproduce the results that we are all anxious to achieve. \r\n In that regard, the Philippine delegation proposes \r\nto the Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations on \r\nthe reform of the Security Council the creation of an ad \r\nhoc group to help him create a workplan, a timeline for \r\nnegotiations and the modalities by which agreements \r\non given issues will be reflected in a text for approval \r\nand adoption by the General Assembly. \r\n Let us be realistic. We do not expect to have an \r\nagreement on all issues all at once. The Philippines \r\ntherefore cannot subscribe to the view that nothing is \r\nagreed unless everything is agreed. A general \r\nagreement on Security Council reform can only be \r\nachieved step by step, one step at a time. Only after \r\ngathering agreement on all points can we then agree on \r\nthe totality. \r\n A lot of work remains to be done and many \r\nobstacles still lie ahead of us, but that should inspire all \r\nof us to work even harder. We must keep our faith and \r\nenthusiasm for Security Council reform. No big \r\nachievement is ever attained if it is not fuelled and \r\nsustained by enthusiasm and the belief that success is \r\npossible. \r\n Mr. President, we value your able and competent \r\nleadership, and we thank you once again for giving \r\npriority to Security Council reform in the Assembly’s \r\nagenda. The Philippines stands ready to support you \r\nand Ambassador Tanin and to play a constructive role \r\ntowards the attainment of our common goal, that is, to \r\nsee a Security Council that is more representative, \r\naccountable, democratic, transparent, responsive and \r\nefficient. \r\n Mr. Cuello Camilo (Dominican Republic) (spoke \r\nin Spanish): The Dominican Republic is grateful to \r\nAmbassador Sir Mark Lyall Grant, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of the United Kingdom and President of \r\nthe Security Council during the month of November, \r\nfor the thorough presentation of the report of the \r\nSecurity Council (A/65/2) before the Assembly. We \r\nalso greatly appreciate the sister delegation of Nigeria \r\nfor its role in the preparation of the report. \r\n The Dominican Republic particularly appreciates \r\nthe follow-up by the Security Council to the continuing \r\ndifficult situation in the neighbouring Republic of \r\nHaiti. We are particularly grateful for its swift action \r\nafter the tragic earthquake in Haiti on 12 January, when \r\nit approved an increase in the military and police \r\ncontingent of the United Nations Stabilization Mission \r\nin Haiti.  \r\n The Dominican Republic trusts that the Council’s \r\nfollow-up on the situation in Haiti will lead, sooner or \r\nlater, to strengthening the capacity of the Haitian \r\npeople themselves so they can assume the management \r\nof their own destinies. We trust there will be a \r\nsuccessful transition from peacekeeping to \r\npeacebuilding, with secure institutions that solidify the \r\nrule of law and provide a basis for the restoration of \r\nthe confidence of all in a future of prosperity and \r\nsocial justice, generating jobs in Haiti for all Haitians. \r\n We therefore welcome the adoption of the \r\nSecurity Council’s presidential statement on transition \r\nand exit strategies (S/PRST/2010/2), by which a view \r\nwas adopted of peacekeeping as a partner with, rather \r\nthan an alternative to, political strategies on the \r\nground. \r\n The Dominican Republic thus trusts that \r\npeacekeeping will have more clearly defined goals and \r\na specific timetable for returning to territories in \r\nconflict conditions allowing them to live in peace, \r\nirreversibly overcoming the causes of the conflict and \r\nthus making it possible to dismantle the peacekeeping \r\noperation once the mission is accomplished. \r\n Despite the efforts of members of the Security \r\nCouncil, the annual report continues to lack an \r\n A/65/PV.49\r\n \r\n3 10-63467 \r\n \r\nanalytical perspective, with detailed information on \r\nboth public meetings and informal consultations that \r\nenables us to absorb with greater benefit its 223 pages, \r\nincluding 27 pages of introduction on the Council’s \r\nwork, 21 on subsidiary bodies, and 186 containing \r\nnothing more than reference information on documents \r\nthat have been adopted, considered or received. There \r\nis a lack of pointers enabling us to understand why \r\nconflicts that are key for international peace and \r\nsecurity — for example, the situation in the Middle \r\nEast — continue without resolution. \r\n However, the Dominican Republic welcomes the \r\nefforts of Council members to intensify transparency \r\nand responsibility in their important work. In that \r\nconnection, we recognize the constructive nature of the \r\nnote approved under Japan’s chairmanship of the \r\nInformal Working Group on Documentation \r\n(S/2010/507), which will undoubtedly contribute to \r\nimproving the Council’s working methods and provide \r\ngreater possibilities for all Member States to better \r\nunderstand the work of the Security Council and to \r\nparticipate in issues and concerns of common interest \r\non its agenda. \r\n True improvement in the working methods of the \r\nSecurity Council can come about only if the Council is \r\nreformed. We therefore rely once again in the wise \r\nleadership of Ambassador Zahir Tanin, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Afghanistan. \r\n The Dominican Republic supports a \r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council \r\ncovering the five key issues set out in the important \r\nGeneral Assembly decision 62/557, namely: categories \r\nof membership, the question of the veto, regional \r\nrepresentation, the size of an expanded Council and its \r\nworking methods, and the relationship between the \r\nCouncil and the General Assembly. \r\n As the position of the Dominican Republic in \r\nrelation to each of those issues is already known, I will \r\ntake this opportunity to express once again our \r\nconviction regarding the imbalance in the current \r\nmembership structure of the Council. New countries \r\nmust have the opportunity to serve on the Council. \r\nThat includes small island developing States, which \r\nplay a role in the resolution of regional political \r\nconflicts and in the promotion of joint responses to \r\nnew challenges to security such as climate change or \r\nthe prevention and mitigation of and response to \r\nnatural disasters. \r\n Regions such as Africa and Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean, moreover, do not have the kind of \r\nparticipation in the Security Council that they deserve \r\nin light of the political realities of the twenty-first \r\ncentury. That is why the Dominican Republic hopes \r\nthat the recent outcry that we have heard for an \r\neffective, efficient, credible and legitimate Security \r\nCouncil will now be matched by the political will and \r\nthe commitment of the Member States to the reform \r\ndemanded by our times. \r\n Mrs. Kolontai (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): The \r\nRepublic of Belarus has always advocated a \r\nconstructive approach to the issue of Security Council \r\nreform, which we have repeated during the negotiation \r\nprocess. We believe that the fundamental goal of \r\nCouncil reform should be to further enhance its \r\neffectiveness. \r\n We commend the activities of the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Afghanistan to the United Nations, \r\nAmbassador Tanin, as Chair of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform. \r\n Belarus is keen to see Security Council reform \r\nleading to a more balanced, more equitable distribution \r\nof the Council’s power. We support increasing the \r\nnumber of Council members by giving additional seats \r\nto all regional groups. We draw attention to the \r\nunderrepresentation of the Eastern European Group \r\namong the non-permanent membership. We affirm our \r\nposition on the need to expand the representation of \r\nthat group of countries among the Council’s non-\r\npermanent members. \r\n On the issue of the working methods of the \r\nSecurity Council, we note the importance of involving \r\nin the Council’s work delegations that are not \r\nmembers. Here, we welcome the practice established in \r\nrecent years of the Council holding regular briefings \r\nfor such delegations. \r\n We also commend the regular contacts on the \r\nexchange of information between the Presidents of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council and \r\nsharing information on those contacts with Member \r\nStates. \r\n Belarus supports involvement of non-Council \r\nMember States in the decision-making process in \r\ndecisions of interest to them. We also support \r\nexpanding the practice of holding open meetings and \r\nthe organization of close interaction among the \r\nA/65/PV.49  \r\n \r\n10-63467 4 \r\n \r\nsanctions committees with States that are subject to \r\nsanctions. \r\n We also believe that the Council should avoid \r\nexpanding its agenda to include issues falling within \r\nthe purview of the General Assembly and the \r\nEconomic and Social Council. We believe that attempts \r\nto bring before the Council updates on the \r\ndevelopments of the internal political situations of \r\nMember States that are not linked to threats to \r\ninternational peace and security do not have any legal \r\ngrounds and undermine the Council’s reputation. \r\n The Republic of Belarus is in favour of \r\npreserving and strengthening the role of the Security \r\nCouncil as the main element of the system for \r\nmaintaining international peace and security. \r\n Mr. Almansoor (Bahrain) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nFirst of all, I would like to sincerely thank His \r\nExcellency the Permanent Representative of the United \r\nKingdom, Ambassador Sir Mark Lyall Grant, President \r\nof the Security Council for the month of November, for \r\nhis detailed briefing on the annual report of the \r\nSecurity Council in document A/65/2, which we are \r\nreviewing under Article 15, paragraph 1, of the United \r\nNations Charter. \r\n My delegation fully endorses the statement by the \r\nChairman of the Non-Aligned Movement on this item \r\n(see A/65/PV.48). \r\n We should note that it is useful for the General \r\nAssembly to study the two items on the agenda before \r\nus together — the report of the Security Council, and \r\nthe question of equitable representation on and increase \r\nin the membership of the Security Council and related \r\nmatters — due to their close links. Doing so allows us \r\nto do a meaningful evaluation of the Council’s work in \r\na relevant manner through an assessment that has been \r\narrived at over the years, given the importance that this \r\nissue holds for Member States. \r\n It goes without saying that despite the importance \r\nof the review of the Council’s annual report in itself, it \r\nis in the General Assembly an important opportunity \r\nfor Member States to make observations on the \r\nCouncil’s valuable work during the period covered by \r\nthe report, given that the Council is the principal \r\nUnited Nations body vested by the Charter with the \r\nprimary responsibility for maintaining international \r\npeace and security. In our view, the review of the \r\nreport, important as it is, can be truly significant only if \r\nwe consider the report’s preparation and substance, \r\nwhich clearly details the working methods and manner \r\nin which the Council addresses the issues before it. \r\n I wish to make a number of observations that we \r\nbelieve are necessary. \r\n The preparation and discussion of the report, an \r\nannual practice, is an opportunity for Member States’ \r\ncomments and observations on the activities and \r\ndecisions of the Security Council. They concern us all, \r\nbecause Member States, as we have seen in recent \r\nyears, believe that this annual debate could be much \r\nmore useful if the report contained more analytical, \r\ndetailed information that would allow Member States \r\nto keep up with the deliberations that have taken place \r\nin the Council, with a view to arriving at better \r\ndecisions. That could be facilitated by the provision of \r\nmore information on the Council’s work and by \r\nholding more open meetings and briefings, while at the \r\nsame time limiting the number of closed consultation \r\nmeetings. \r\n Important and vital as the Council’s work is, and \r\ngreat as the expectations of the international \r\ncommunity and Member States are in terms of its \r\nperformance — which we must all bear in mind — for \r\nits part, the Council must make more sustained efforts \r\nto address the serious issues that undermine stability so \r\nthat peace and harmony based on considerations that \r\ninterest the international community and that stem \r\nfrom the Council and the resolutions it adopts can \r\nreign. It is also important to explain the circumstances \r\nunder which the Council is sometimes unable to find \r\nthe right solution to certain important issues before it, \r\nso that Member States can identify weak points and \r\nshortcomings and propose appropriate solutions for \r\nsuch issues. \r\n My delegation highly appreciates the work of the \r\nCouncil and the missions that its members carry out. \r\nWe realize the scope of the responsibility it assumes \r\nvis-à-vis the increasing number of issues on its agenda, \r\nsince primary responsibility for maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security rests with the Council, \r\nand that things must remain that way, as envisaged by \r\nthe Charter. However, that responsibility should be \r\nshouldered in the most effective way possible in order \r\nto ensure appropriate solutions to the issues. \r\n We can say that the Security Council has shown \r\ngreat responsibility and addressed many questions with \r\ngreat seriousness. My delegation thus welcomes the \r\n A/65/PV.49\r\n \r\n5 10-63467 \r\n \r\nattention it has paid to Africa, the scene of many \r\nconflicts which the Council has tackled positively and \r\nattentively. The same goes for many other international \r\nissues, which leads us to say how much we appreciate \r\nthe Council’s activities. \r\n Nonetheless, the Council has not been able to \r\nfind appropriate solutions to extremely important \r\nissues, such as the Palestinian cause, which to this day \r\ndoes not receive the attention and seriousness it \r\ndeserves. The fact is that the States that are involved in \r\nthat debate on the Council, particularly those that are \r\nfundamental stakeholders in all issues concerning \r\nthem, could be useful and fruitful if that approach is \r\nadopted in an effective manner. It could help us find \r\nrapid solutions that all Member States would like, since \r\nwe are all striving for the same goal, which is to find \r\nsettlements to international conflicts that require the \r\ninternational community’s attention. We therefore \r\nshould strengthen relations between the General \r\nAssembly and the Security Council so that, as \r\nstipulated by the Charter, responsibility can be \r\nassumed properly. That can help consolidate the \r\nfounding principles of the United Nations. \r\n Intergovernmental negotiations on Security \r\nCouncil reform had a successful beginning during the \r\nAssembly’s sixty-third session, in step with Assembly \r\ndecision 62/557. The membership has since welcomed \r\nthose developments, based on their profound \r\nconviction of the importance and urgency of reform, \r\nbecause the Security Council does not reflect current \r\ngeopolitical realities. As a result, there is a need to \r\nimprove representation in order to allow the Council to \r\nfully discharge its mandate effectively. \r\n Ongoing intergovernmental negotiations must be \r\nbased on transparency and realism, in order to arrive at \r\nfeasible proposals on the basis of a broad political \r\nagreement among Member States. In order to meet the \r\ndemands of world leaders during the 2005 World \r\nSummit with regard to the importance of early Security \r\nCouncil reform, that reform must be comprehensive, \r\nbalanced, transparent and cohesive and must be based \r\non equitable and balanced geographic representation. \r\n Moreover, we need to increase the number of \r\nSecurity Council members and improve its working \r\nmethods. The Council’s agenda must reflect the \r\naspirations and needs of both developed and \r\ndeveloping countries. There is also a need to grant a \r\nseat to the League of Arab States, which could be \r\noccupied sequentially by its members, as is the practice \r\nwithin the League. \r\n It is also important that the respective powers of \r\nthe main bodies of the United Nations be respected so \r\nthat they will not be encroached on. The Security \r\nCouncil has primary responsibility for issues that \r\nthreaten international peace and security, in keeping \r\nwith the Charter. Relations between the Council and \r\nthe General Assembly, which represents the legislative \r\nauthority of the Organization, must be characterized by \r\na spirit of partnership and a sense of responsibility. \r\n We would like to reaffirm the importance of \r\nrefraining from recourse to Chapter VII of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations. That Chapter should be invoked \r\nonly as a last resort, after all diplomatic solutions \r\nprovided for by Chapters VI and VIII of the Charter \r\nhave been exhausted. \r\n The right of veto must also be restricted, as it is \r\nan obstacle to taking vital decisions on which a \r\nmajority of Council members should agree. \r\nFurthermore, the Council’s rules of procedure should \r\nbe made official, because we cannot accept that they \r\nremain merely provisional more than 65 years after the \r\ncreation of the United Nations. Moreover, it is utterly \r\nunjustified. \r\n The Kingdom of Bahrain attaches particular \r\nimportance to this issue. It urges the Security Council \r\nto take into account the interests and concerns of \r\nMember States and to faithfully reflect geopolitical \r\nrealities. It also encourages all Member States to \r\nparticipate in innovative and creative solutions to \r\ncomplex international issues that affect their stability \r\nand security. We also hope that the reformed Security \r\nCouncil will be able to reflect the aspirations of all \r\npeoples. \r\n Mrs. Miculescu (Romania): At the outset, let me \r\nexpress my warm appreciation to Ambassador Joy \r\nOgwu for her hard work in preparing the annual report \r\nof the Security Council to the General Assembly \r\n(A/65/2). I would also like to thank Ambassador Sir \r\nMark Lyall Grant for introducing the document, as well \r\nas all the Security Council members for their intense \r\nactivity during the reporting period. It really is \r\ncommendable that the initiative to have an informal \r\nmeeting with the Member States in order to exchange \r\nviews on the report materialized for the third year in a \r\nrow. It has thus turned into a very useful tradition. \r\nA/65/PV.49  \r\n \r\n10-63467 6 \r\n \r\n Romania welcomes the continuing trend towards \r\ngreater openness and transparency in the Security \r\nCouncil’s work. That is made possible by multiplying \r\nthe number of open debates, briefings and meetings \r\nwith troop-contributing States. The trend was \r\nreinforced, at the conceptual level, through the \r\nadoption of revised presidential note 507 (S/2010/507), \r\nthe interaction between members and non-members of \r\nthe Security Council, and the regular dialogues held \r\nbetween the Presidents of the General Assembly and \r\nthe Security Council. \r\n We praise the Security Council’s efforts to \r\nincrease openness and transparency, for they provide \r\nall Member States with the opportunity to make a more \r\nsignificant contribution to matters at the heart of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, such as the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security. \r\n The report before us mirrors the wide range of \r\nactions undertaken by the Council on our behalf, \r\nrevealing that during the reporting period there were a \r\nsignificant number of issues that the Council had to \r\ndeal with as efficiently as possible. In our view, the \r\nlargest number of those activities were geared, quite \r\ncorrectly, to bringing resolution to the most \r\nchallenging situations around the world, such as in \r\nAfghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \r\nHaiti, Iraq, the Sudan — including Darfur — or Timor-\r\nLeste, to mention just a few. \r\n At the same time, we have to recall that there are \r\ninstances, such as the situation in Georgia, that should \r\nnot be allowed to drop off the Security Council’s radar, \r\nas they may have a critical impact on regional and \r\ninternational peace and security. \r\n Romania also takes keen interest in the Council’s \r\nsubstantial work and the considerable attention paid to \r\nthematic debates of comprehensive relevance. Those \r\ninclude nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, the \r\nillicit trade in small arms and light weapons in Central \r\nAfrica, peacebuilding and peacekeeping, the protection \r\nof civilians in armed conflicts, and, of course, women \r\nand peace and security. \r\n We the peoples of the United Nations agreed that \r\nthe Council acts on behalf of the entire United Nations \r\nmembership for the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security. While some would claim that the report \r\ndoes not provide a comprehensive picture, many \r\ncountries, including my own, deem that the document \r\ncould and should depart from mere statistical \r\ninformation and develop an even more analytical \r\nassessment, thus providing a reflective profile of the \r\nCouncil’s activities. \r\n Let me now turn to the second item on the agenda \r\ntoday, which is the reform of the Security Council. \r\n I would like to express to you, Mr. President, my \r\ndelegation’s appreciation for the inclusion of Security \r\nCouncil reform among your priorities as President of \r\nthe General Assembly. In addition, my delegation \r\nwelcomes the reappointment of Ambassador Zahir \r\nTanin as facilitator of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. His elegant mastery, resolution and \r\nperseverance guided us through five rounds of \r\nnegotiations, and for the first time in 18 years of \r\ndebates on Security Council reform, we are in a \r\nposition to negotiate on the basis of a comprehensive \r\ndocument. We are looking forward to starting the sixth \r\nround of negotiations as soon as possible, as that \r\ndocument needs to be streamlined and trimmed of \r\nredundancies. \r\n Romania acknowledges the special contribution \r\nmade by the members of the Security Council. We \r\nstrongly believe that it is of utmost importance for all \r\nMember States of the United Nations with the capacity \r\nto serve on the Council to be provided with the \r\nopportunity to do so. Hence, we feel that the \r\nenlargement of the Council is a real must that should \r\nbe given careful and swift consideration in order to \r\nensure that that main body of the United Nations better \r\nreflects the political realities of the current \r\ninternational stage. \r\n As my delegation has stated time and again, we \r\nwill be able to build a solid political foundation for \r\nreforming the Security Council if, and only if, both \r\ncategories of membership are expanded. At the same \r\ntime, for enlargement to work, it is of critical \r\nimportance that none feel excluded and that the \r\nprinciple of equitable geographic representation \r\nprevails. In that vein, Romania supports the requests \r\nfor better representation voiced by the Eastern \r\nEuropean, Latin American and Caribbean, African and \r\nAsian Groups of States. \r\n Expanding the number of Security Council \r\nmembers is just one side of the coin; improving its \r\nworking methods is the flip side. Both are of equal \r\nrelevance in order to make that United Nations body \r\nmore transparent, inclusive, accountable and effective. \r\nAnd while a higher number of seats would allow a \r\n A/65/PV.49\r\n \r\n7 10-63467 \r\n \r\nmore frequent, yet still time-limited, presence on the \r\nCouncil for the rotating members, by improving \r\nworking methods we could make sure that all States \r\neligible for non-permanent membership have access to \r\nthe Council’s activities at practically any time. \r\n The discussion we had during the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations indicated the clear \r\ninterest of many delegations concerning an \r\nintermediate formula. My delegation believes that we \r\nshould continue to explore the merits of such an \r\noption, if that formula could be of help in furthering \r\nthe reform. \r\n In conclusion, let me express my conviction that \r\nit would be a tremendous loss if the energy invested by \r\nthe vast majority of Member States during the previous \r\nfive rounds of negotiations has been invested in vain. \r\nLet us hope that the next round of negotiations will \r\nprovide a decisive boost to Security Council \r\nenlargement. And of course I want to assure you, Mr. \r\nPresident, that you and Ambassador Tanin can certainly \r\ncount on Romania’s unwavering support in pushing \r\nforward the Security Council reform process. \r\n Mr. Parham (United Kingdom): The United \r\nKingdom has already made a statement on the annual \r\nreport of the Security Council (A/65/2) in its capacity \r\nas President of the Security Council for the month of \r\nNovember. The Assembly will have heard in that \r\nstatement that we have tried to move away from a \r\nstandard reiteration of the Council’s annual report. \r\nInstead, we have used this opportunity to assess \r\nhonestly the Council’s work and to look ahead to some \r\nof the issues on its agenda. In that way, we hope that \r\nthe debate can reflect more on the Council’s work and \r\nless on the drafting of the report itself. So I would like \r\nto thank others for their comments today in response to \r\nthe statement and the acknowledgement that efforts are \r\nbeing made to improve the Council’s work. We should \r\naim to have a genuine debate about the Council’s work \r\nand move away from a fixation with the report itself. \r\nFor all its faults, it is purely a tool that records the \r\nwork of the Council from August to July. \r\n Turning now to the issue of Security Council \r\nreform, I am pleased to reiterate the United Kingdom’s \r\nongoing commitment to reform. During the month of \r\nNovember, we are using our presidency to bring some \r\nsmall innovations to the Security Council’s working \r\nmethods. Those include greater use of \r\nvideoconferencing and more interactive consultations \r\nwithin the Council. For example, this morning I \r\nchaired a meeting of the Council with troop and police \r\ncontributors to the United Nations Mission in the \r\nSudan, at which we were joined by videoconference by \r\nthe Special Representative of the Secretary-General, \r\nthe Force Commander and many other members of \r\ntheir team both in Juba and in Khartoum, as well as the \r\nSecretariat here in New York. That gave rise to a much \r\nmore interactive, valuable and productive discussion \r\nthan those meetings have often produced in the past. \r\n On the Council’s structure, we continue to \r\nsupport permanent membership for Brazil, Germany, \r\nIndia and Japan, as well as permanent representation \r\nfor Africa. We look forward to working with many of \r\nthose countries next year when they join the Security \r\nCouncil. \r\n Since intergovernmental negotiations began in \r\nFebruary 2009, the collective desire to move the \r\nprocess of Council reform forward has been clear. \r\nWhile progress may not have been as fast as some \r\nmight wish, under Ambassador Tanin’s skilful \r\nchairmanship there has been concrete progress. The \r\ncompilation paper sets out the positions and proposals \r\nof Member States. As the negotiation process \r\ncontinues, we remain ready to work with Ambassador \r\nTanin and others here today to determine how the \r\ncompilation paper can best be used to deliver real \r\nprogress. As ever, the responsibility for that progress \r\nremains with Member States. We therefore hope that \r\nall will rally behind Ambassador Tanin. \r\n In addition, the United Kingdom continues to \r\nadvocate consideration of alternative options. An \r\nintermediate model could provide for a new category \r\nof seats with a longer mandate than that of members \r\ncurrently elected. On completion of the intermediate \r\nperiod, a review should take place to convert the new \r\nseats into permanent ones. \r\n Some have asked what the details of that model \r\nare. We expect that the actual modalities, including the \r\nduration and the number of seats, will emerge through \r\nthe course of the negotiations. We hope that further \r\ndiscussions on the various intermediate models will \r\ntake place as the negotiations continue. \r\n Ms. Ochir (Mongolia): At the outset, I would like \r\nto thank the President of the Security Council, \r\nAmbassador Sir Mark Lyall Grant, for presenting the \r\nreport of the Security Council, contained in document \r\nA/65/2. Mongolia commends the Council for its critical \r\nA/65/PV.49  \r\n \r\n10-63467 8 \r\n \r\nwork in discharging its function of maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security. Over the reporting \r\nperiod, the Security Council has delivered quite a few \r\nmomentous decisions, including resolution 1887 \r\n(2009), adopted at its summit meeting in September \r\n2009 on the issue of nuclear non-proliferation and \r\nnuclear disarmament. We also welcome the increased \r\nfrequency of open debates in the Council on matters \r\npertaining to the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security. \r\n The efforts made by the Security Council to \r\nimprove its cooperation with the Secretariat and the \r\ntroop-contributing countries, and particularly the work \r\nof its Working Group on Peacekeeping Operations, \r\nhave helped to promote both cross-cutting and mission-\r\nspecific issues, increase the common understanding of \r\npolicy issues, and address the existing gaps between \r\nmandates and their implementation on the ground. \r\nWhile recognizing those positive developments, we \r\nwish to emphasize that there is still room for the \r\nfurther enhancement of the Council’s work in that area, \r\nincluding through providing all available political \r\nsupport to peacekeeping operations and ensuring the \r\nactive participation of all stakeholders in setting \r\nachievable mandates. \r\n My delegation has also taken note of certain \r\nmeasures aimed at improving the working methods of \r\nthe Security Council since the last report (A/64/2). In \r\nthat respect, we welcome the open debate held in the \r\nCouncil on 22 April 2010 (see S/PV.6300) on the issue \r\nof improving its working methods, including in the \r\narea of documentation and other procedural questions. \r\nWhile expressing our appreciation of the efforts to \r\nenhance the access of non-Council Member States to \r\nthe work of the Council, my delegation calls for fuller \r\nimplementation of the revised presidential note \r\n(S/2010/507). \r\n While the activities of the Security Council were \r\nindeed extensive during the reporting period, as in \r\nprevious years its annual report lacks a substantive \r\nanalysis of those activities and their impact. The \r\nprovision of an analytical annual report is essentially \r\none of the Council’s obligations to the larger \r\nmembership of the Organization. \r\n As for the question of Security Council reform, \r\nsince the adoption of the historic decision 62/557, five \r\nrounds of intergovernmental negotiations have taken \r\nplace in the informal plenary of the General Assembly \r\nunder the skilful stewardship of Ambassador Tanin, \r\nwhom we sincerely congratulate on his recent \r\nreappointment. We had the opportunity to listen to \r\nMember States reiterating their principled positions, as \r\nwell as some new proposals, on the five key issues of \r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council. \r\n As we approach the next round of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations at this session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, my delegation wishes to strongly \r\necho the position expressed by many previous speakers \r\nthat, in order to move the process forward, we need a \r\nshort, manageable text in order to engage in genuine \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform. We remain \r\nhopeful that the Chair will produce such a text prior to \r\nthe next round. \r\n Mongolia’s stance on Security Council reform is \r\nwell known. We have consistently stood for a just and \r\nequitable enlargement of the Security Council by \r\nincreasing the number of permanent and \r\nnon-permanent members alike, while ensuring the due \r\nrepresentation of developing and developed countries. \r\nHere, Mongolia wishes to reiterate its support for \r\nJapan, Germany and India as permanent members, \r\nalong with the equitable representation of Africa and \r\nthe Group of Latin American and Caribbean States in a \r\nreformed Security Council. \r\n Our stance on the enlargement of both current \r\ncategories is guided by and based on the legitimate \r\ncomposition defined by the Charter and the political \r\nrealities of today’s world, as well as the principles of \r\njustice and equality, so as to ensure greater and \r\nenhanced representation of developing countries, \r\nparticularly the unrepresented and underrepresented \r\nregional groups. \r\n Our position is also clear on what has been called \r\nan intermediate model. Inasmuch as it entails the \r\ncreation of a third tier of Council members, my \r\ndelegation finds it difficult to support. \r\n We are in favour of restricted use of the veto \r\npower in the Security Council, in particular with regard \r\nto Chapter VII-based decisions, and we support its \r\neventual abolition. As long as the veto right exists, it \r\nhas to be extended to the new permanent members so \r\nas not to create a new category of membership of the \r\nSecurity Council. In that regard, we also support the \r\nclearly expressed position of aspirants to have a \r\nvoluntary moratorium on the use of the veto until the \r\nproposed Security Council review conference. \r\n A/65/PV.49\r\n \r\n9 10-63467 \r\n \r\n We strongly believe that, in order to make the \r\nnecessary breakthrough in the reform process, we need \r\nprimarily to take a decision on the categories of \r\nSecurity Council enlargement. In that respect, we share \r\nthe view that the overwhelming majority of Member \r\nStates have expressed, in no uncertain terms, their \r\npreference for increasing the membership of the \r\nSecurity Council in both current categories, and we \r\nexpect that reality to be reflected in a negotiating text. \r\n Finally, Mr. President, I would like to welcome \r\nyour decision to make Security Council reform one of \r\nyour priorities, and to express my delegation’s sincere \r\nhope that, with your strong leadership, the General \r\nAssembly will make meaningful progress at this \r\nsession towards a timely reform of the Security \r\nCouncil, as mandated to us all by world leaders at the \r\n2005 World Summit. \r\n Mr. Osorio (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): As I \r\nam addressing the General Assembly for the first time \r\nas Permanent Representative of Colombia, I offer you, \r\nMr. President, and all the States Members of the United \r\nNations my warmest wishes and the renewed and \r\nongoing commitment of my country to contributing to \r\nand participating actively in the noble cause of this \r\nOrganization. \r\n The subject of this debate is of particular \r\nrelevance to Colombia because of our recent election to \r\na seat on the Security Council for the next two years. I \r\ntake this opportunity to express our gratitude for the \r\nvote and confidence vested in us by 186 Member \r\nStates. \r\n In thanking the current President of the Security \r\nCouncil, Sir Mark Lyall Grant, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of the United Kingdom, for introducing \r\nthe Council’s report (A/65/2), I would like to express \r\nsome observations about Security Council reform. \r\n There is undeniably a heartfelt need for Member \r\nStates to update the composition and working methods \r\nof the Council in order to ensure better representation \r\nand more transparency. At the sixty-fourth session of \r\nthe General Assembly, some progress was made and it \r\nwas possible to discern new modalities for reform of \r\nthe Security Council and the aspirations of the various \r\nregional groups and Member States in general. Our \r\ngratitude goes to Ambassador Ali Abdussalam Treki for \r\nhis skilful conduct of that process as President of the \r\nAssembly, and to Ambassador Zahir Tanin, the chair of \r\nthe informal intergovernmental negotiations. \r\n From our viewpoint, the objective of bringing \r\ngreater democracy to the Security Council will be \r\nachieved by extending the category of non-permanent \r\nmembership. If that expansion is based on fair \r\ngeographical representation, with clearly regulated \r\nrotation, it will be possible to strengthen the political \r\nlegitimacy of that organ. It will also ensure the \r\nefficiency and efficacy of its working methods and \r\ncommunications. We believe that such a balance can be \r\nattained with a total membership of roughly 25. \r\n Regarding the veto and its use in the Security \r\nCouncil, a clear framework of reference must be \r\nestablished to restrict its use exclusively to exceptional \r\ncircumstances. The transparency of the Council’s \r\nworking methods can be guaranteed by improving \r\naccess to information, holding more open meetings and \r\nenhancing communication channels between the \r\nCouncil and all the other Members. \r\n Italy and Colombia, speaking for the United for \r\nConsensus group, presented a reform model last year \r\nthat seeks to define and reconcile the various \r\napproaches and to lay the foundations for a more \r\nrepresentative, more democratic, more effective and \r\nmore transparent Security Council. The document \r\ncontains specific proposals in five areas: first, \r\ncategories, terms and mandates of new members; \r\nsecondly, the necessary majorities for the taking of \r\ndecisions and the use of the veto; thirdly, working \r\nmethods and procedures; fourthly, the relationship \r\nbetween the Security Council and the General \r\nAssembly; and fifthly, a mechanism for the review of \r\nthe reform. Those are the areas on which we must \r\nfocus our efforts and put our ability to compromise and \r\ninnovate to the test. As a member of the Security \r\nCouncil, Colombia will be in the vanguard of those \r\nefforts. \r\n Mr. Kalita (India): I am honoured to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly on behalf of my country on the \r\nreport of the Security Council (A/65/2) and the \r\nquestion of equitable representation on and increase in \r\nthe membership of the Security Council and related \r\nmatters. \r\n We thank the delegation of the United Kingdom \r\nfor introducing the annual report of the Security \r\nCouncil for the period 1 August 2009 to 31 July 2010. \r\nWe would also like to thank the delegation of Nigeria \r\nfor its efforts in preparing the introductory section of \r\nthe report. My delegation would like to place on record \r\nA/65/PV.49  \r\n \r\n10-63467 10 \r\n \r\nour appreciation to the delegation of Uganda for \r\nconvening an informal meeting with Member States on \r\n21 October for the preparation of the report. \r\n At the outset, let me state that we align ourselves \r\nwith the statement to be made by the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Jamaica on behalf of the L.69 group \r\non Security Council reform. \r\n In our view, the report of the Security Council is \r\nan important means for facilitating interaction between \r\nthe members of the most representative organ of the \r\nUnited Nations and its most empowered brethren. The \r\nUnited Nations Charter itself bestows on the report a \r\nprofound gravitas, as is evident from the fact that it has \r\na separate provision mandating such a report, rather \r\nthan including it with the provision for reports from \r\nother United Nations bodies. It is therefore imperative \r\nthat the annual report of the Security Council inform, \r\nhighlight and analyse the measures that it has decided \r\nupon or taken to maintain international peace and \r\nsecurity during the reporting period. \r\n The membership of the General Assembly has \r\nrepeatedly requested that the report be more analytical \r\nand incisive, rather than a mere narration of events. It \r\nis important that the General Assembly be aware not \r\nonly of what decisions were taken but also of the \r\nrationale, efficacy and impact of the Council’s \r\ndecisions, in terms of crystallised takeaways for the \r\nmembership of the General Assembly. \r\n At the same time, however, let us give credit \r\nwhere it is due. I refer in particular to resolution \r\n64/301 on the revitalization of the work of the \r\nAssembly. Operative paragraph 9 of that resolution \r\nrefers to the improvements that have been made in the \r\nquality of the annual reports of the Security Council \r\nand encourages the Council to make further \r\nimprovements as necessary. Like other delegations, we \r\nare also of the view that while we may have covered a \r\nfew yards, we still have miles ahead of us. \r\n The United Nations membership must recognize \r\nthat the lacunae in the report are a manifestation of the \r\nunderlying problems of the representation and working \r\nmethods of the Council, which remain opaque and non-\r\ninclusive. The report, this year too, continues to be a \r\nstatistical compilation of events — a bland summary \r\nand listing of meetings and outcome documents. \r\n There is no other option but to recognize that the \r\nreal solution not only for a more credible, legitimate \r\nand representative Council, but even for a more \r\nthorough report lies in the comprehensive reform of the \r\nCouncil, including an expansion in both the permanent \r\nand non-permanent categories of membership, and its \r\nworking methods. In this context, it is important to \r\nnote that an overwhelming majority of Member States \r\nhave clearly expressed their preference for such a \r\nreform during the five rounds of intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations held so far on the issue of reform of the \r\nCouncil. \r\n Mr. Al-Jarman (United Arab Emirates), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair. \r\n We are enthused by the fact that the President of \r\nthe General Assembly has undertaken a number of \r\nquick and commendable steps, thereby ensuring that \r\nthe Assembly remains faithful to the central directive \r\nof its decision 64/568 of 13 September 2010 to \r\nimmediately continue intergovernmental negotiations \r\non Security Council reform in informal plenary \r\nmeetings of the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth \r\nsession. At the earliest instance — on 1 October, to be \r\nprecise — the President reappointed Ambassador Zahir \r\nTanin as the chair of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Council reforms. On 21 October, he \r\nconvened a meeting of the entire United Nations \r\nmembership on this important issue. \r\n My delegation welcomes these steps, which \r\nreflect the resolve of the vast majority of the United \r\nNations membership to achieve early reform. These \r\nactions, we hope, bode well for the process. There \r\nexists sufficient basis for optimism that, by the end of \r\nthe current session of the General Assembly, we will be \r\nable to achieve concrete results on Security Council \r\nreform under his stewardship and guidance. \r\n We are equally happy that, with each passing day, \r\ncountries and leaders around the world are publicly \r\narticulating their support for India’s candidature as a \r\nnew permanent member of an expanded Security \r\nCouncil. Most recently, India received affirmation of \r\nsupport from the President of the United States, \r\nMr. Barack Obama. The Indian delegation takes this \r\nopportunity to thank the United States for this kind \r\ngesture. We also call on other nations to extend their \r\nvaluable support to us. \r\n We also hope that the Secretary-General will \r\ncomplement the initiative and enthusiasm of the \r\nAssembly President in the context of Council reform. \r\nThis issue without a doubt will acquire salience in the \r\n A/65/PV.49\r\n \r\n11 10-63467 \r\n \r\ncoming year as the Secretary-General prepares for his \r\nsecond term. \r\n Both in our individual capacity and as a member \r\nof two groupings devoted to early reform of the \r\nCouncil — the Group of Four (G-4) and the L.69 \r\ngroup — India would like to highlight certain salient \r\nfeatures of the various proposals and positions as \r\ncaptured in the negotiation text. \r\n First, the overwhelming majority of Member \r\nStates have expressed their clear preference for \r\nexpansion of the Council in both its permanent and \r\nnon-permanent categories. \r\n Secondly, on the size of the Council, there is \r\nconvergence on the need for expansion from the \r\ncurrent 15 to a figure in the mid-twenties. Also, most \r\nof the positions have called for a mandatory review \r\nafter a period ranging from eight to 15 years.  \r\n Thirdly, the G-4 position on the question of the \r\nveto is unambiguous and constructive. We stress the \r\nneed for an outcome that ensures the democratization \r\nof decision-making within the Council. India is willing \r\nto engage with all concerned with an open mind on this \r\nkey issue. \r\n Fourthly, India associates itself with the growing \r\nclamour for the early reform of the working methods of \r\nthe Council. \r\n Fifthly, on the issue of regional representation, \r\nwe lay great store by the principle of equitable \r\ngeographical distribution. India supports a Charter-\r\nbased distribution of seats that addresses the lack of \r\nrepresentation of African, Latin American and \r\nCaribbean countries; the lack of adequate \r\nrepresentation of Asian countries in the permanent \r\nmembership; and the lack of adequate representation of \r\ndeveloping countries, including least developed \r\ncountries, landlocked countries and small island States, \r\nin the non-permanent membership. \r\n Finally, India calls for the General Assembly and \r\nthe Security Council, as two principal organs of the \r\nUnited Nations, to respect each other’s distinct roles, in \r\naccordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter, \r\nso as to secure the effective functioning of the United \r\nNations as a whole. \r\n In conclusion, we are both ready and willing to \r\nreach out to other countries and to work in close \r\ncooperation with them towards the goal of achieving \r\nurgent reform of the Council, in keeping with the \r\nchanging realities of the current times. We need to \r\nshorten the negotiation text and then proceed \r\nwholeheartedly into real negotiations. This is the view \r\nof the overwhelming majority of the United Nations \r\nmembership, besides being the only logical course of \r\naction for anyone even remotely committed to reform. \r\n Let me assure the President of the Assembly and \r\nthe rest of the United Nations membership of our \r\nwillingness to remain constructive and reasonably \r\nflexible on all issues on the table in the months to \r\ncome, and urge other delegations to do likewise. \r\n Mr. Heller (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): At the \r\noutset, allow me to thank the President of the \r\nAssembly for having organized this joint debate, which \r\nprovides Member States with an opportunity to address \r\nboth the content of the annual report of the Security \r\nCouncil (A/65/2), of which Mexico has been an elected \r\nmember since 2009, and the reform of the Council, a \r\nmatter to which my country attaches particular \r\nimportance. I would also like to thank the President of \r\nthe Security Council, the Permanent Representative of \r\nthe United Kingdom, for having presented the annual \r\nreport of the Security Council to the General Assembly. \r\n Allow me to start by addressing the question of \r\nthe reform of the Security Council. I will not reiterate \r\nhere Mexico’s position on each of the issues \r\nconcerning reform, as it is already well known and we \r\nhave referred to it frequently during the negotiations \r\nprocess. Rather, I will confine myself to commenting \r\non the negotiating process and the prospects for future \r\nrounds. \r\n Since the adoption of decision 62/557 and the \r\nstart of intergovernmental negotiations, the reform of \r\nthe Security Council has assumed particular \r\nsignificance. We have participated in five negotiating \r\nrounds and have heard proposals from Member States, \r\nsome of which are novel and others better known. \r\nThese have been compiled into the document submitted \r\nby Ambassador Tanin, whom we congratulate on his \r\nwork as facilitator of this process. It is now up to \r\nMember States, using that document as a basis, to \r\ndisplay the necessary political will to achieve \r\nsignificant progress towards a comprehensive reform \r\nof the Security Council with the broadest possible \r\nsupport of Member States. \r\n Mexico has always been prepared to negotiate in \r\nall seriousness. We have displayed this in our \r\nA/65/PV.49  \r\n \r\n10-63467 12 \r\n \r\nflexibility in considering alternatives and innovative \r\nproposals and in our desire to continue to improve the \r\ndocument of the facilitator. But we cannot negotiate on \r\nour own. It is surprising that to date more States or \r\ngroups have not been willing to negotiate, but rather \r\nprefer to maintain their original positions. \r\n Also surprising are unilateral pronouncements by \r\nStates claiming the exclusive right to determine the \r\ncomposition of the Security Council, flouting the will \r\nof the General Assembly and prejudicing the result of \r\nthe reform process. Recent statements of this type \r\nhamper the negotiating atmosphere and exacerbate \r\ndivisions among the various regional groups. \r\n Security Council reform cannot be imposed by a \r\nsmall number of States or decided upon in alternative \r\nforums. It must be the outcome of the broadest possible \r\nagreement of Member States. We must aim not at \r\ndistributing more privileges to a few, but rather at \r\nimproving the representativeness, efficiency, \r\ntransparency and accountability of the Security \r\nCouncil. Hence, Mexico does not support expanding \r\nthe category of permanent membership, which would \r\nrestrict access to the Security Council and its ability to \r\nadapt to the changing realities of the world. \r\n We can continue to improve and further refine the \r\nfacilitator’s document in forthcoming rounds, but \r\ncomprehensive reform will be achieved only if we have \r\nthe political will necessary for serious negotiation. In \r\nthat context, Mexico stands ready. \r\n As an elected member of the Security Council, \r\nMexico participated actively and constructively in \r\ndrafting this year’s report to the General Assembly, \r\nensuring that the information contained therein is as \r\nobjective and substantive as possible and faithfully \r\nreflects the actions of the Security Council in the \r\nperiod under review, in particular during June 2010, \r\nwhen Mexico was President of the Council. \r\n This exercise in transparency and analysis is \r\nparticularly evident in the introduction of the report. In \r\nthat regard, we acknowledge the work of the Nigerian \r\ndelegation in drafting the annual report through a \r\nprocess of open consultation with the General \r\nAssembly, promoting Security Council transparency \r\nand making the report more analytical and substantive. \r\nHowever, despite the progress made, my delegation \r\nnotes that the annual report still has room for \r\nimprovement. \r\n During the period covered by the annual report, \r\nthe Security Council was faced with serious \r\nchallenges. To note but a few, in Haiti the Council had \r\nto address the devastating consequences of the \r\nearthquake that aroused the sympathy of the entire \r\nworld. In Somalia, internal instability and its regional \r\nrepercussions called for measures to preserve security \r\nand strengthen capacities to address the problem of \r\npiracy and to ensure the survival of the Transitional \r\nFederal Government. \r\n In the Sudan, given the continued humanitarian \r\ncrises, the United Nations monitoring capacity was \r\nenhanced and the foundations laid to implement the \r\nDoha agreement and to continue to focus attention on \r\nthe preparations for the referendum scheduled for \r\n2011. \r\n In Afghanistan and Iraq, terrorist attacks and \r\ninsurgent groups had to be dealt with and efforts \r\npursued to improve security and strengthen national \r\ninstitutions. \r\n In Kyrgyzstan, a humanitarian crisis was avoided \r\nand regional stability preserved. In Gaza, the attack on \r\nthe humanitarian aid flotilla was addressed, opening \r\nthe way for the investigation of the incident and for the \r\npartial lifting of the restrictions imposed on those \r\nliving in the Gaza Strip. However, as we all know, the \r\nagenda of the Security Council is burdened with \r\nconflicts that continue to threaten international peace \r\nand security. The Middle East in its various aspects \r\nprovides a good example of this. \r\n Perhaps the most noteworthy achievements of the \r\nSecurity Council are to be found in the cross-cutting \r\nchallenges that have become part and parcel of its \r\nagenda. The Council has enhanced capacities to \r\nmonitor, demobilize and reintegrate minors recruited in \r\narmed conflict, by means of initiatives introduced in \r\nthe Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict, \r\nchaired by Mexico over the past two years. The \r\nadoption of resolution 1882 (2009) and the presidential \r\nstatement on that subject in June (S/PRST/2010/10) are \r\nsignificant achievements that will have a direct impact \r\non the protection of children. \r\n With respect to the protection of civilians, \r\nbenchmarks have been established to monitor the \r\nprotection of women and children, taking into account \r\nin particular the re-emergence of sexual violence, \r\nparticularly in the African continent. The bases were \r\nalso laid to focus greater attention on post-conflict \r\n A/65/PV.49\r\n \r\n13 10-63467 \r\n \r\nsituations by means of the review process of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, in which Mexico played \r\nan active part as a facilitator in the process. \r\n In the past, the review of the implementation of \r\nresolution 1540 (2004), the Committee established \r\npursuant to which I chaired, was a significant step \r\nforward in preventing the proliferation of weapons of \r\nmass destruction among non-State actors. \r\n Mexico’s participation in the Security Council \r\nhas been guided by its firm belief in the importance of \r\nelected members playing their part in maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security, which is a shared \r\nresponsibility pursuant to obligations under the United \r\nNations Charter. By participating in the Security \r\nCouncil in 2009-2010, we have once again \r\ndemonstrated our commitment to the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security and the preservation of \r\nthe principles and purposes of the United Nations \r\nCharter. \r\n As a permanent member of the General \r\nAssembly, my country shall continue to play an active \r\npart in the negotiating process on the comprehensive \r\nreform of the Security Council in order to adapt it to \r\nthe reality of our times and to meet the challenges \r\nfacing the international community. \r\n Mr. Mnisi (Swaziland): It is an honour to address \r\nthis Assembly under agenda item 119, and my thanks \r\ngo to the President of the Assembly for convening this \r\nmeeting. My delegation aligns itself with the statement \r\nof the Group of African States delivered by the \r\nrepresentative of Sierra Leone. \r\n The item under consideration has become one of \r\nthe most important intergovernmental processes in the \r\nUnited Nations. It is a process characterized by the \r\nbroad interest of the varied constituents of the United \r\nNations in the fact that the current balance of power \r\ntilts towards a small circle constituting 3 per cent of \r\nthe membership. This, on its own, is a parody that does \r\nnot say much about the turn of history, the irrelevance \r\nof the patron/client relationship and the evolution of \r\nconsensus in the twenty-first century. \r\n Without prejudice to the mandate of the Security \r\nCouncil and the inherent intricacies that uphold it, \r\ncontemporary history has taught us that the 3 per cent \r\nwho run the show have relied heavily on the \r\ncooperation of the larger membership in many of its \r\nundertakings. This simple fact indicates the breadth of \r\nawareness of the need for the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil, over and above the fact that the organ was \r\nestablished on a foundation of control before its \r\nmandate was subsequently glossed over. Few can \r\ndispute the notion that, in modern times, the need for \r\nthis control has faded. The advent of globalization, \r\nwith all its faults, has mandated a redistribution of the \r\nspoils as the whole interface of challenges has mutated. \r\nHowever, without much consequence, the Open-Ended \r\nWorking Group commissioned some 15 to 16 years ago \r\nhas not made any tangible headway in collating \r\nthoughts on where the vital players lay their beliefs. If \r\nthere are any thoughts at all, they are usually a \r\ncaricature of the demands of the disenfranchised. \r\n The Kingdom of Swaziland encourages the \r\ninformal plenary negotiations currently under the \r\nguidance of Mr. Zahir Tanin, Permanent Representative \r\nof Afghanistan, whom we thank for his continued \r\npartiality to progress. We have witnessed a bare-\r\nknuckled exchange of views, and we hold out the hope \r\nthat these exchanges will transform into a real \r\nnegotiation with real trade-offs. \r\n The intergovernmental process has revealed a \r\nhorde of differences that are daunting. Some are \r\ninterregional and some are based on the continued \r\nprevalence of narrow interests and the desire to \r\nperpetuate the status quo. It is a known fact that some \r\nare preoccupied with the notion of reform by proxy. \r\nSome have divided the forces of negotiation by \r\nintroducing cumbersome approaches to reform. \r\nUnreservedly, my delegation rejects outright the \r\nintermediate approach widely held in the African \r\nGroup. This is a clear divide-and-rule strategy, and the \r\napproach comes in many forms and manifestations — a \r\nchameleon that would take years if not decades to \r\ndisentangle. It also adds to the apathy of the permanent \r\nfive and their slow response to the reform process. \r\n The Kingdom of Swaziland reiterates its full \r\nsupport for the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte \r\nDeclaration. Without repeating the contents of either, \r\nwhich are known to all, they remain our lodestar and \r\nwe encourage those who set out to distort their \r\nprinciples to consider the many motivations put \r\nforward by any State member of the African Group. \r\nThe historical injustice and regional bias within the \r\nSecurity Council are unmistakable. More than half of \r\nthe Security Council agenda is laden with items \r\nrelating to Africa. Does that not indicate a need for the \r\ninstitutional memory of Africa? Without prejudice to \r\nA/65/PV.49  \r\n \r\n10-63467 14 \r\n \r\nother disenfranchised groups or regions, the Security \r\nCouncil’s preoccupation with Africa legitimizes such a \r\nquestion. \r\n The need for no less than two permanent seats \r\nand five non-permanent seats can never be overstated. \r\nAfrica needs to find a voice within those ranks and the \r\nsooner that need is internalized, the better will be the \r\nprospects for the region to deal with its peace and \r\nsecurity dynamics. We will not venture to analyse the \r\nneed for some to keep Africa out of the Security \r\nCouncil establishment, because my country has no \r\ninterest in that prospect. \r\n In closing, Swaziland urges the chairperson of the \r\ninformal plenary meetings to remain loyal to decision \r\n62/557, which enabled the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. We also urge him to maintain his \r\nimpartiality to positions and to employ the relevant \r\nstrategies conducive to a quick and fruitful conclusion \r\nof the process. \r\n Mr. Benítez Versón (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nTo begin, I note Cuba’s full support for the statement \r\nmade by the representative of Egypt on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement. \r\n Cuba appreciates the presentation of the annual \r\nreport (A/65/2) of the Security Council. We recognize \r\nthat efforts have been made to improve the quality of \r\nthe report. Nonetheless, much remains to be done. The \r\nreport remains basically a descriptive document that \r\nlacks the analytical and substantive approach needed \r\nby Member States to assess the work of that organ. \r\nCuba calls on the Council yet again to work in that \r\ndirection. \r\n On the other hand, we again wonder why the \r\nCouncil never submits to the Assembly the special \r\nreports stipulated by the Charter in its Articles 15 and \r\n24. Such reports would be very useful as a complement \r\nto the annual report. Regrettably, they remain absent. \r\n Cuba underlines the responsibility of the Council \r\nto duly account to the General Assembly. In conformity \r\nwith the Charter, we have entrusted that organ of very \r\nlimited membership with the prime responsibility to act \r\non behalf of Member States, although not \r\nautonomously, to maintain international peace and \r\nsecurity. The Security Council needs urgent and deep \r\nreform. The United Nations cannot truly be reformed \r\nwithout reform of the Security Council. That reform \r\ncannot continuously be postponed or disregarded. The \r\ndemand of the majority cannot continue to be ignored. \r\n Cuba has participated actively in the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council, which have been conducted in an \r\nexemplary manner by the Permanent Representative of \r\nAfghanistan, Ambassador Tanin. Unfortunately, there \r\nhas been no clear progress in this process. Despite the \r\ninterest of the vast majority, in reality it has not been \r\npossible to hold true negotiations. And there is a \r\ngrowing risk that we will end up repeating the process \r\nof endless deliberations without concrete results, which \r\nfor more than 15 years took place in the General \r\nAssembly Open-ended Working Group on the Question \r\nof Equitable Representation on and Increase in the \r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters \r\nRelated to the Security Council. We must move to real \r\nnegotiations as soon as possible. \r\n Cuba considers that genuine reform of the \r\nSecurity Council must include seven basic elements. \r\nFirst, the number of members of the Council must be \r\nincreased to no less than 26. With that figure, the \r\nproportion between the number of members of the \r\nCouncil and of United Nations Member States would at \r\nleast approach that existing when the United Nations \r\nwas founded. \r\n Second, the main purpose cannot be to \r\nenlargement for its own sake, but must rather be to \r\nrectify the unjustifiable underrepresentation of \r\ndeveloping countries in the Council. Cuba will not \r\nsupport any partial or selective expansion or any \r\nenlargement of the composition of the members of the \r\nCouncil to the detriment of developing countries. \r\n Third, the increase in Security Council \r\nmembership must occur in both the permanent and \r\nnon-permanent categories. The majority supports that \r\nposition. Increasing only the number of non-permanent \r\nseats would further widen the huge gap that already \r\nexists between permanent and non-permanent \r\nmembers. There can be no equitable representation in \r\nthe Security Council if developing countries, including \r\nentire regions, remain totally underrepresented in the \r\ncategory of permanent membership. How is it possible \r\nto justify, for example, the fact that while over half of \r\nthe Council’s agenda items refer to problems in Africa, \r\nthat region still has no representative among the \r\npermanent members? \r\n A/65/PV.49\r\n \r\n15 10-63467 \r\n \r\n Fourth, the new seats to be established, including \r\nthose in the category of permanent membership, must \r\nenjoy exactly the same prerogatives and rights as those \r\nattributed to the current seats, without establishing \r\nselective or discriminatory criteria. \r\n Fifth, the veto is an anachronistic and \r\nantidemocratic privilege that must be eliminated. As \r\nlong as the veto exists, at least an appropriate \r\nproportion of developing countries must also be able to \r\nexercise it. The entry of new permanent members \r\nwithout veto power would be equivalent to creating a \r\nnew category of Council members, which is not \r\nfavoured by Cuba. \r\n Sixth, the main increase in the number of both \r\npermanent and non-permanent members must go to \r\ndeveloping countries. Permanent membership must be \r\ngranted to at least two countries from Africa, two \r\ndeveloping countries from Asia and two countries from \r\nLatin America and the Caribbean. \r\n Seventh, a profound transformation of the \r\nCouncil’s working methods is required. Although some \r\nmodest changes have been made in recent years, most \r\nhave been more formal than substantive. The truth is \r\nthat, at present, the Security Council is not transparent, \r\ndemocratic, representative or efficient. It is our \r\ncollective responsibility to change that unacceptable \r\nreality. \r\n We advocate a Security Council in which closed-\r\ndoor consultations are the exception. We aspire to a \r\nCouncil that addresses the matters under its purview \r\nand does not encroach upon those of other bodies, as \r\noccurs with alarming frequency with respect to issues \r\nbefore the General Assembly. We want a Council that \r\ntakes genuinely into account the opinions of all \r\nMember States before making decisions and that \r\nensures the real access of non-members to that body. \r\n Before concluding, allow me to comment briefly \r\non a matter of procedure that we believe to be \r\nimportant. In Cuba’s opinion, in the future we must \r\nseriously consider whether it is appropriate for the \r\nGeneral Assembly to continue debates on agenda \r\nitems 29 and 119. Given the time restrictions and the \r\nfact that we are compelled to address two extremely \r\nrelevant and far-reaching items in only one statement, \r\ndelegations must omit many important facts and the \r\nsorely needed in-depth review is not achieved. While \r\nwe acknowledge their interrelationship, we believe that \r\nboth the annual report of the Security Council and the \r\nreform of that organ are matters that, given their \r\nimportance, scope and implications, deserve to be \r\ndiscussed separately by the General Assembly. \r\n I would like to conclude by congratulating the \r\ndelegations of Colombia, Germany, India, Portugal and \r\nSouth Africa on their election to the Security Council \r\nand to wish them every success in their important \r\nresponsibility. \r\n Mr. Dabbashi (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): We are meeting today to discuss two \r\nimportant items that have been on the agenda for many \r\nyears. Our consideration of those two items is a sign of \r\nour commitment to achieving a positive and successful \r\noutcome to the Security Council reform process, which \r\nwe consider to be a basic prerequisite for the reform of \r\nthe United Nations as a whole. Let me take this \r\nopportunity to thank Ambassador Zahir Tanin, \r\nPermanent Representative of Afghanistan, for presiding \r\nover the intergovernmental negotiation process and for \r\nhis skilful management of it. \r\n While we agree with and support the entire \r\ncontents of the statements made by the representative \r\nof Sierra Leone, on behalf of the Group of African \r\nStates, and the representative of Egypt, on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement, my delegation would like to \r\nmake some observations regarding what we believe to \r\nbe important for Security Council reform. \r\n Member States have made tremendous efforts in \r\npast sessions to achieve concrete progress in reforming \r\nthe Security Council and expanding its membership. \r\nFor our part, we are determined to maintain our \r\nsupport for the reform efforts and are committed to \r\ncooperating constructively with all parties in order to \r\nreach a genuine reform of the Security Council that \r\nwill make it more reflective of today’s realities and, \r\nconsequently, more able and effective in performing \r\nthe duties entrusted to it by the Charter. \r\n However, at the same time we stress the need to \r\ncorrect the historic injustice done to the African \r\ncontinent by denying it representation in the permanent \r\nmembership of the Security Council, to seek redress \r\nand recognition of its historic rights, and to end its \r\nmarginalization by giving it the opportunity for \r\nequitable, permanent representation in the Security \r\nCouncil. In that regard, Libya believes that the \r\nimmediate granting, before the end of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiating process, of one of the \r\ntwo permanent seats that Africa has been seeking \r\nA/65/PV.49  \r\n \r\n10-63467 16 \r\n \r\nwould be a legitimate response that would contribute to \r\nthe success of those negotiations, since Africa would \r\nthen stand on equal footing with other regional groups. \r\n If we seek genuine reform of the Council, we \r\nmust all work together to break the moulds set by its \r\npermanent members, which would necessarily entail \r\ncomprehensive reform of all the United Nations \r\norgans. To that end, we believe that there is no \r\nalternative to granting the General Assembly full \r\nmandates and to making its resolutions binding on all \r\nMember States and all United Nations bodies, as the \r\nGeneral Assembly is the genuine representative of the \r\npeoples of the world. Thus, the Security Council would \r\nbecome a tool for the implementation of resolutions \r\nadopted by the General Assembly. \r\n We should also seriously consider the idea, put \r\nforth earlier by Libya, to replace permanent \r\nmembership of States with permanent membership of \r\nregional groups. In this context, the privilege of the \r\nveto would either be granted to all or withdrawn from \r\nall. \r\n We believe that Security Council reform should \r\ninclude a genuine reform of its working methods, \r\nactivities and procedures. Transparency and openness \r\nin the Council’s work should be taken into \r\nconsideration, as should the need to ensure the \r\nparticipation of non-member States, particularly those \r\ninvolved in issues under consideration, in the meetings \r\nof that organ. Closed meetings and informal \r\nconsultations should be abolished. Consultations \r\nshould be restricted to the consideration of draft \r\nresolutions and presidential statements. All meetings \r\nand discussions should be open. There should be no \r\nrestriction to participation of United Nations Member \r\nStates in any meeting. \r\n Reports of the Security Council to the General \r\nAssembly, including that before us today (A/65/2), do \r\nnot provide a clear picture of what takes place in the \r\nSecurity Council or reflect the Council’s commitment \r\nto the contents of the resolutions of the General \r\nAssembly. There is also a need to abandon the \r\nnarrative approach and to include analysis of the \r\ndeliberations on the basis of which the Security \r\nCouncil resolutions are adopted. Indeed, the various \r\npositions of States, particularly permanent members, \r\nare not described in the reports, nor are any reasons \r\noffered to explain the Council’s powerlessness to \r\naddress serious crises that threaten international peace \r\nand security. We hope that future reports of the Council \r\nwill be more useful, more analytical and more \r\nexplanatory in detailing the reasons for its failed \r\nperformance in maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity. \r\n We also express the hope that the General \r\nAssembly will act at the right time to correct the \r\nshortfalls of the Security Council, whether they be \r\nresort to double standards or to the use or threat of use \r\nof the veto, which have been pervasive in recent years. \r\n Mr. De Klerk (Netherlands): The annual Security \r\nCouncil report before us today states very clearly: \r\n  “The Security Council, in discharging its \r\nfunction of the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security, was engaged in yet another \r\nyear of intensive activities.” (A/65/2, p. 1) \r\nIt convened 191 formal meetings, most of which were \r\npublic; it adopted 54 resolutions — one more than last \r\nyear — and 27 presidential statements; and issued 42 \r\nstatements to the press. \r\n This is a consistent production that illustrates the \r\nimmense workload of the Security Council and its \r\nworking groups in the sixty-fourth session. My \r\ndelegation appreciates that hard work, and we also \r\nappreciate that during the reporting period, the \r\nCouncil’s work was characterized by an increase in the \r\nnumber of open debates and briefings. In this context, \r\none should not forget that the Council has made \r\nsignificant strides in improving its working methods \r\nand in increasing the transparency of its work. \r\n For the sixty-fifth year, the Security Council will \r\ncontinue to act on behalf of all Members of the United \r\nNations. Therefore, it is a matter of legitimate concern \r\nto the entire membership that the composition of the \r\nCouncil should appropriately reflect the geopolitical \r\nrealities of today, and not those of 1945. \r\n At a time when countries, and certain groups \r\nwithin countries, still resort to violence or continue \r\nwith conflict, it is precisely in matters of war and peace \r\nthat legitimacy and resolve are most essential — \r\nlegitimacy and resolve that only the United Nations \r\nand the Security Council can provide. \r\n In the view of the Netherlands, the Council’s \r\nlegitimacy and continued effectiveness are both at \r\nstake. In order for the Council to remain effective, a \r\nbalance needs to be struck between its legitimacy and \r\n A/65/PV.49\r\n \r\n17 10-63467 \r\n \r\nits effectiveness. In our view, both can go hand-in-hand \r\nif there is a modest increase in Council membership. \r\n Following the announcement made by President \r\nObama earlier this week, the eyes of world opinion are \r\nonce again focused on the question of Security Council \r\nreform, giving new impetus to the process that was \r\nlaunched at the end of the sixty-third session. At the \r\nend of the sixty-fourth session, His Excellency \r\nAmbassador Tanin was able to successfully present a \r\nnegotiation text. We should aim for tangible results by \r\nthe end of this session of the General Assembly. \r\n The Netherlands Government would like to take \r\nthis opportunity to reiterate its appreciation of and \r\nstrong support for the judicious work that Ambassador \r\nTanin, as chair of the intergovernmental negotiations, \r\nhas done so far. The membership should build on this \r\nsolid work. The negotiation text, as presented by the \r\nchair this summer, should be drastically shortened into \r\na condensed and consolidated text. To this end, \r\nAmbassador Tanin has submitted some valuable \r\nproposals that merit further discussion. If Member \r\nStates do not manage themselves to come up with a \r\nshorter text, we should explore other ways to achieve \r\nthis. The Netherlands is ready to play an active role in \r\nthis regard. \r\n Having listened carefully to the statements of the \r\nmembership, my delegation noted that the so-called \r\nintermediate solution has been mentioned more \r\nfrequently than in the past. There is a momentum \r\nbuilding for such a temporary and transitional solution \r\nthat should be a crucial step towards a more permanent \r\nsolution. Naturally, this transitional solution can take \r\nmany forms and shapes, and this is a debate that has \r\nyet to begin. \r\n Let me close by quoting our former Prime \r\nMinister, who said in this very Hall: \r\n “[I]t is clear to the Netherlands that there should \r\nbe more room for more countries to join the \r\ndiscussions and exert influence: room for large \r\ncountries that in 1945 were not yet large enough \r\nor were not yet Members of the United Nations; \r\nbut also room for smaller nations that, as troop-\r\nsupplying countries or as interested parties in a \r\nparticular region, should have the right to speak. I \r\nwould add immediately that countries that want \r\ninfluence should realize that this entails financial, \r\npolitical and moral obligations. Or, in the words \r\nof Winston Churchill, the price of greatness is \r\nresponsibility.” (A/65/PV.16, p. 29) \r\n Our declarations today create expectations and \r\nobligations; consequently, doing nothing leads to the \r\nconclusion that the United Nations cannot deliver. It is \r\nup to us to prove the United Nations pessimists wrong. \r\n Mr. Goledzinowski (Australia): We thank the \r\nSecurity Council for the submission of its annual report \r\n(A/65/2) and the Permanent Representative of the \r\nUnited Kingdom, Sir Mark Lyall Grant, for his \r\nintroduction of the report to the General Assembly. \r\n I take to heart the suggestion of Ambassador \r\nParham earlier that we should not obsess about the \r\nreport, as opposed to the work of the Council itself. So \r\nI will restrict myself to welcoming the report, which is \r\nas good as any of its kind that we have seen. However, \r\nwe continue to believe that, fundamentally, the Council \r\nshould commit to a vision of active accountability and \r\ndeliberate transparency, and that this should be \r\nreflected in a more analytical report, perhaps in parallel \r\nwith the existing procedural report. \r\n Turning now to the other subject of today’s \r\ndebate, Security Council reform, Australia maintains \r\nthat reform of the Council is one of the most important \r\nissues we are seized of here at the United Nations, \r\nsomething in which we all have a stake. Yet little \r\nprogress has been achieved, and substantive \r\nnegotiations have yet to really commence. We should \r\nnot shy away from the difficult questions. Reform of \r\nthe composition of the Council is clearly long overdue. \r\nIn particular, the absence of permanent membership \r\nfrom the African and Latin American and Caribbean \r\nregions is a striking injustice. \r\n My delegation has said before that the impasse on \r\nforging consensus on composition and size of a \r\nreformed Council should not serve as an obstacle to \r\nachieving meaningful reform of the Council’s working \r\nmethods. It is vital to enhancing the credibility of the \r\nUnited Nations and its capacity to fulfil the goals set \r\nout in the Charter. We welcome the revisions reflected \r\nin the note by the President of the Security Council \r\n(S/2010/507), issued in July following the Security \r\nCouncil’s open debate on working methods in April \r\n(see S/PV.6300). But we also agree with the remarks of \r\nthe group of five small nations, delivered this morning \r\nby Ambassador Seger of Switzerland, who pointed out \r\nthat a significant oversight in the note is the absence of \r\nimplementation mechanisms. \r\nA/65/PV.49  \r\n \r\n10-63467 18 \r\n \r\n We would also like to join with the calls by our \r\nPacific neighbours this morning for the Council to take \r\nup the issue of the implications of climate change and \r\nsecurity, following the historic passage of General \r\nAssembly resolution 63/281. We request the Council to \r\nplace that matter on its agenda in 2011 and to urgently \r\ndeliberate on action to address that existential threat. \r\n In conclusion, we thank Ambassador Tanin for his \r\ncontinued efforts as Chair of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. I cannot put it better than Her Excellency \r\nthe Ambassador of Romania did this afternoon in \r\ndescribing his “elegant mastery”, perseverance and \r\npersistence. I assure Mr. Tanin of Australia’s continued \r\nsupport and confidence. \r\n Mrs. DiCarlo (United States of America): I \r\nwould like to thank the Security Council President for \r\nthis month, Ambassador Lyall Grant of the United \r\nKingdom, for his introduction of the Security Council’s \r\nannual report (A/65/2) to the General Assembly, and \r\nAmbassador Ogwu and the Nigerian delegation for \r\ntheir preparation of the annual report during their \r\npresidency of the Security Council in July. \r\n The annual report provides non-Council members \r\nwith a transparent and comprehensive review of the \r\nintensive work of the Security Council. We hope the \r\nreport does indeed facilitate the exchange of \r\ninformation and enhance the cooperation between the \r\nAssembly and the Council, two co-equal principal \r\norgans of the United Nations. The United States takes \r\nseriously the importance of making sure that all \r\nMember States are informed of and appropriately \r\ninvolved in the Council’s work. The Council has made \r\na distinct effort to ensure that more of its meetings are \r\nopen, and we welcome the participation of all Member \r\nStates in Council proceedings during such sessions. \r\nDuring our presidency of the Council next month, the \r\nUnited States will be continuing the practice of \r\nproviding a briefing to non-members on the Council’s \r\nprogramme of work. \r\n Turning to our other topic today, we welcomed \r\nthe reappointment of Ambassador Tanin to chair the \r\nsixth round of intergovernmental negotiations on \r\nSecurity Council reform. We support Ambassador \r\nTanin’s efforts to shepherd these negotiations forward, \r\nand we hope Member States will approach the next \r\nround with pragmatism and flexibility. While we know \r\nthat genuine disagreements remain on certain aspects \r\nof the issue, we hope the talks can lead to a reform \r\nprocess that is Member State-driven and enjoys broad \r\nconsensus. As we stated during the first five rounds of \r\nthe negotiations and will continue to discuss in the \r\ncurrent round, the United States believes that the long-\r\nterm viability of the Security Council depends on its \r\nreflecting the world of the twenty-first century. We \r\nsupport expansion of the Council in a way that will \r\ndiminish neither its effectiveness nor its efficiency. Let \r\nme briefly summarize key elements of my \r\nGovernment’s position. \r\n The United States is open in principle to a modest \r\nexpansion of both permanent and non-permanent \r\nmembers. We strongly believe that any consideration of \r\nan expansion of permanent members must be country-\r\nspecific in nature. In assessing which countries merit \r\npermanent membership, the United States will take into \r\naccount the ability of countries to contribute to the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security and \r\nother purposes of the United Nations. \r\n As we stated in our national security strategy \r\nearlier this year, my Government is committed to \r\nengaging emerging Powers in the international \r\narchitecture. The United States supports a Security \r\nCouncil membership that upholds human rights and the \r\nrule of law at home and abroad, and makes significant \r\ncontributions to the implementation of Security \r\nCouncil decisions, especially through their \r\nenforcement, as well as through financial, personnel, \r\nand political support. As we have previously stated, the \r\nUnited States is not open to an enlargement of the \r\nSecurity Council that changes the current veto \r\nstructure. \r\n We remain committed to a serious, deliberate \r\neffort, working with other Member States, to find a \r\nway forward that both adapts the Security Council to \r\ncurrent global realities and enhances its ability to carry \r\nout its mandate and effectively meet the challenges of \r\nthe new century. \r\n Mr. Limeres (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): My \r\ndelegation is grateful for the report of the Security \r\nCouncil contained in document A/65/2. We also \r\nwelcome the convening of a new General Assembly \r\nmeeting on Security Council reform, providing another \r\nopportunity to ascertain the points of view of United \r\nNations Members on reform and how progress can be \r\nmade on the subject. I would also like to pay tribute to \r\nthe work done by Ambassador Tanin towards our \r\nshared goal. \r\n A/65/PV.49\r\n \r\n19 10-63467 \r\n \r\n We must remember that Security Council reform \r\nis an extremely important matter, owing to its \r\nimplications for the Organization. It must, therefore, \r\nenjoy the support of all Member States. It cannot be a \r\nprocess in which each side competes for a specific \r\nnumber of followers, but rather one that leads to a \r\nsolution accepted by all Members, since it will \r\npermanently change the shape of a body with lofty \r\nresponsibilities. \r\n Furthermore, Council reform is not limited to a \r\nsingle aspect, although there is one that seems to take \r\ncentre stage. Ambassador Tanin’s informal document \r\nidentifies five issues: categories of members; the veto \r\nquestion; regional representation; the size of the \r\nSecurity Council and its working methods; and the \r\nrelationship between the Council and the General \r\nAssembly. All of those elements are intimately related \r\nand demand reform, which, in order to achieve the goal \r\nof all Members for the Council — which has primary \r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security — will transform it into a more \r\nrepresentative, transparent, inclusive, democratic and \r\neffective body. \r\n In some of those five issues my delegation sees \r\npossibilities for consensus, since they have not been \r\nthe subject of major disagreements among Members. \r\nFor example, it is generally accepted that appropriate \r\nmeasures must be adopted to improve the working \r\nmethods of the Council and that the interaction \r\nbetween the Security Council and the General \r\nAssembly must be improved. There is also potential for \r\nconsensus on the number of Council members. We \r\nmust not see the strongly divisive matter of categories \r\nof membership as an obstacle to the wider issue of \r\nreform itself, which is necessary. \r\n The achievement of progress towards a successful \r\nreform is imperative, which is the consensus view of \r\nall Members. Argentina reiterates that the type of \r\nsolution that could generate that level of support \r\namong United Nations Member States will not come \r\nfrom a so-called interim approach, which could entail \r\nthe possibility of crystallising a particular position — \r\nespecially if that position does not enjoy the support of \r\na consensus of Members — but rather from an \r\napproach that seeks an intermediate or compromise \r\nsolution. The intermediate solution that we envision \r\nwould mean, basically, an increase in the number of \r\nnon-permanent seats. It would permit the many \r\ncountries that have not yet had the chance to \r\nparticipate as Security Council members to do so. \r\n Argentina believes that a solution of that kind \r\nwould lead to a more representative Council, because it \r\nwould correct the lack of representation of some \r\nregions and of developing nations. At the same time it \r\nwould bolster the legitimacy of the Council, making it \r\nmore democratic. The argument that to increase the \r\nnumber of non-permanent members of the Council \r\nwould just perpetuate the status quo is, in fact, \r\nfallacious. Actually, it is increasing the number of \r\npermanent members that would not only maintain the \r\nstatus quo — which is an imbalance whereby a few \r\ncountries permanently enjoy a privileged position — \r\nbut in fact exacerbate it. The permanent member \r\ncategory is not based on the concept of democratic \r\nrepresentation but rather, as we all know, is the product \r\nof a particular moment in history. Further, it \r\ncontradicts the explicit recognition by Members of the \r\nOrganization of the role of non-permanent members of \r\nthe Security Council. An intermediate solution would \r\nalso contain in itself the germ of durability, because it \r\nwould mean a Council that not only reflected the \r\ndynamic of today’s world but also was adaptable to \r\nfuture changes on the international stage. Lastly, \r\nelections would foster a sense of the Security Council’s \r\naccountability. \r\n I want to reiterate my delegation’s support for the \r\nproposal in that vein presented by Italy and Colombia \r\non behalf of the Uniting for Consensus group, of which \r\nArgentina is a member. I want to emphasize the \r\ngroup’s desire for negotiation. It has not only \r\npropounded the idea that reform must be based on \r\nproposals that could realistically garner the support of \r\nthe majority of States but has also demonstrated \r\ngenuine flexibility to the end of achieving a \r\ncompromise solution. We trust that the dynamism of \r\nthe President of this session of the Assembly will \r\ninspire all delegations to confront the issue with \r\nrealism and flexibility, keeping in mind that the viable \r\nsolution is one based on compromise. \r\n Argentina wants to make progress through a \r\ntransparent and predictable process, fundamentally \r\ndriven by the States. In that regard, I wish to voice our \r\ndisagreement with the suggestions made this morning \r\nthat the President of the Assembly and Ambassador \r\nTanin should promote a truncated version of Mr. \r\nTanin’s document, via consultations with groups of \r\nMembers. I want to underline Argentina’s belief that \r\nA/65/PV.49  \r\n \r\n10-63467 20 \r\n \r\nnegotiation on a matter of such importance must not be \r\napproached as a process of elimination of positions in \r\nan unofficial document, merging them in various ways \r\nwithout the participation of the entire membership. \r\nTransparency is essential to such participation, and \r\nonly open consultations can provide the appropriate \r\nframework for discussions of this very important issue. \r\n The search for a compromise that would enjoy a \r\nconsensus among all Members depends, as one \r\ndelegation stated this morning, on dedication and open-\r\nmindedness. Allow me to point out that the latter is \r\nessential in order to identify realistic compromises that \r\nall Members can accept for a reform that is vital to the \r\nUnited Nations. Argentina has faith in the wise \r\nleadership of the President of this session and will \r\nsupport his efforts in the matter. \r\n Mr. Appreku (Ghana): I am grateful for the \r\nopportunity to deliver the following statement on \r\nbehalf of the Ghanaian delegation on these two \r\nimportant agenda items. \r\n My delegation associates itself with the statement \r\nmade by the Permanent Representative of Sierra Leone \r\non behalf of the African Group and the statement made \r\nby the Permanent Representative of Egypt on behalf of \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement and wishes to make the \r\nfollowing remarks in our national capacity. \r\n My delegation joins other speakers in thanking \r\nthe President of the Security Council for the month of \r\nNovember, Sir Mark Lyall Grant, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of the United Kingdom, for presenting \r\nthe report of the Council to the General Assembly \r\n(A/65/2). My delegation also thanks the Nigerian \r\ndelegation for preparing the introduction to the report. \r\nThe role of the Secretariat in the preparation of the \r\nreport is also appreciated. \r\n Ghana attaches great importance to the role of the \r\nSecurity Council, as enshrined in the Charter, in the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, and \r\nthat explains why, as a non-permanent member from \r\n2006 to 2007, our country contributed actively to the \r\nwork of the Council. When not a member of the \r\nCouncil, my delegation has, both in the past and in \r\nrecent times, endeavoured to participate in the \r\ndeliberations of the Council through its thematic \r\ndebates, including the recent open debates on \r\npreventive diplomacy and on women and peace and \r\nsecurity, among others, as well as in informal briefings \r\non the work of the Security Council. \r\n The interaction of the Security Council and the \r\nGeneral Assembly should be informed by a need for \r\nthose two principal organs to strive, while respecting \r\neach other’s mandates, to complement their activities \r\nwith efforts to achieve the shared objectives of the \r\nOrganization concerning peace and security, human \r\nrights, development and the promotion of international \r\nlaw, including respect for the principles and purposes \r\nof the Charter. \r\n Indeed, there are certain areas of the work of the \r\nUnited Nations, such as post-conflict peacebuilding, \r\nwhere the need for complementary, collaborative and \r\ncoordinated approaches to its work is mandated by the \r\nrelevant concurrent founding resolutions. Such an \r\napproach will be a sure way of strengthening and \r\nenhancing the effectiveness of the Organization. \r\n Given the importance of regional organizations, \r\nsuch as the African Union, in the attainment of the \r\nobjectives of the Organization, my delegation calls on \r\nthe Council to assess the impact or effectiveness of \r\ninitiatives aimed at enhancing cooperation between the \r\nCouncil and regional organizations. In fact, that \r\nevaluation should be a two-way matter, in which inputs \r\nfrom regional organs, such the African Union Peace \r\nand Security Council, become or remain desirable. \r\n Despite the significance of the work of the \r\nCouncil, Ghana is convinced that the current position \r\nof the Council will be strengthened through reform of \r\nthat organ. The United Nations that was born in 1945 \r\nwith some 50 Member States is different from today’s \r\nUnited Nations, 65 years later, with 192 Member \r\nStates, in a changing world, requiring the Organization \r\nto adapt and be responsive to the changing times. \r\n Thus, the intergovernmental negotiations on the \r\nquestion of equitable representation on and increase in \r\nthe membership of the Council and other related \r\nmatters must be given renewed urgency. Ghana will \r\ntherefore continue to support the facilitator of the \r\nnegotiations, the Permanent Representative of \r\nAfghanistan, His Excellency Ambassador Zahir Tanin, \r\nin expediting the process to an early and successful \r\nend. Like other African States, Ghana looks forward to \r\nan outcome of the negotiations that will lead to the \r\ncreation of additional permanent seats to be allocated \r\nto African States. \r\n In conclusion, I wish to stress that amending the \r\nCharter to allocate permanent places to African States \r\non the Security Council is long overdue. Addressing \r\n A/65/PV.49\r\n \r\n21 10-63467 \r\n \r\nthe imbalance in the composition of the Security \r\nCouncil, in particular in the permanent seat category, in \r\nwhich African States are not represented at all, will \r\nensure greater equity in the application of the principle \r\nof unanimity and give more substance to the principle \r\nof equitable geographical representation in the \r\nmembership of the Council. \r\n To conclude, the Ghana delegation will, \r\ntherefore, also count on the leadership and commitment \r\nthat the President has demonstrated so far, in particular \r\nthe interest he has shown in the issue of Security \r\nCouncil reform, in reaching that goal. \r\n Mr. Wolfe (Jamaica): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of the so-called L.69 group of countries (see \r\nA/61/L.69). The L.69 group comprises a diverse group \r\nof countries from Africa, Latin America, the \r\nCaribbean, Asia and the Pacific that are united by a \r\ncommon cause, namely, to achieve lasting and \r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council. \r\n The report of the Security Council (A/65/2), \r\ncovering the period of 1 August 2009 to 31 July 2010, \r\nrepresents a factual record of the activities undertaken \r\nby the Council with respect to the various countries \r\nand situations on the agenda. We have also taken note \r\nof, and indeed welcome, the greater level of \r\nengagement between the Council and the African \r\nUnion (AU), in particular, its Peace and Security \r\nCouncil. The full engagement of Africa in finding a \r\nsolution to long-standing conflicts is critical to \r\nensuring that hard-won peace is transformed into \r\nlasting peace, security, stability and sustainable \r\ndevelopment throughout the continent. \r\n We look forward, therefore, to more frequent and \r\nin-depth engagements between the Council and the \r\nAfrican Union and further emphasize the need to equip \r\nthe African Union through capacity-building and \r\nresource mobilization so that it can be at the forefront \r\nof solving conflicts on the continent. \r\n While the efforts of the Council to improve its \r\nworking methods and enhance transparency are indeed \r\nimportant, they must be viewed solely as one element \r\nin its overall reform process. Improved working \r\nmethods, though necessary, cannot substitute for the \r\ncomprehensive change that is required in the \r\ncomposition of the membership of the Council to \r\nrender it more reflective of contemporary global \r\nrealities. \r\n In that context, the L.69 group is pleased to note \r\nthe efforts of the facilitator and Chairman of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiating process, which has \r\nresulted in a text-based document. It is our hope that, \r\nthrough further discussions and negotiations, we will \r\nbe able to condense the document into a more \r\nmanageable text as the negotiating process moves \r\nforward. \r\n Allow me to reiterate the guiding principles that \r\nhave underpinned our collaboration within the L.69 \r\ngroup. The L.69 group supports expansion in the \r\nCouncil’s permanent and non-permanent categories of \r\nmembership. It is only through such an expansion, \r\nwhich addresses the lack of representation of the \r\nAfrican, Asian and Latin American and Caribbean \r\ncountries, that we can achieve a more representative, \r\nlegitimate, credible and effective Council. \r\n The L.69 group also supports a Charter-based \r\ndistribution of seats that addresses the non-\r\nrepresentation of some regions in the permanent \r\nmembership and the underrepresentation of developing \r\ncountries in both categories of membership, including \r\nsmall island developing States in the non-permanent \r\ncategory. New permanent members should be selected \r\nbased on the criterion established in the United Nations \r\nCharter. The L.69 group supports an increase in the \r\nCouncil’s membership from its current 15 to some \r\n25 members. The L.69 group supports the conduct of a \r\nreview of the composition of the permanent \r\nmembership after a period of 15 years to ensure that it \r\ncontinues to reflect the global realities. \r\n As we have previously stated, the L.69 group \r\ncalls for a comprehensive improvement in the \r\nCouncil’s working methods, which is necessary in \r\norder to ensure greater access and transparency to \r\nnon-Council Members and the full implementation of \r\nArticles 31 and 32 of the United Nations Charter. We \r\nare also of the view that the Council must become \r\nmore accountable, fair, inclusive, open and consistent \r\nin its actions. \r\n The group is also of the view that there must be \r\nrestrictions on enlarging the scope of Article 24 of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter; formalization of the Council’s \r\nrules of procedure; improved and enhanced \r\nconsultations with troop- and police-contributing \r\ncountries; reasonable restrictions on the use of the \r\nveto; more open debates, meetings and briefings by \r\nUnited Nations officials; and a wider and earlier \r\nA/65/PV.49  \r\n \r\n10-63467 22 \r\n \r\ncirculation of draft resolutions and draft presidential \r\nstatements. There must be rational use of sanctions and \r\nrationalization of the Council’s agenda. Also, we \r\nsupport changes to the decision-making process and \r\nthe scope of decision-making as one means of making \r\nthe Council more effective and more relevant. \r\n The L.69 group also calls for an improved \r\nrelationship between the Council and the General \r\nAssembly, including through improved reporting, \r\nregular consultations between the Council and the \r\nAssembly, and strict adherence to their respective \r\nmandates defined in the Charter. \r\n In closing, allow me to recall paragraph 30 of the \r\nMillennium Declaration (resolution 55/2), in which \r\nworld leaders, inter alia, resolved to intensify the \r\nefforts to achieve a comprehensive reform of the \r\nSecurity Council in all its aspects. I would also recall \r\nthe 2005 World Summit Outcome document (resolution \r\n60/1), in which leaders further resolved to support \r\nearly reform of the Security Council as an essential \r\nelement of overall efforts to reform the United Nations \r\nin order to make it more broadly representative, \r\nefficient and transparent and thereby further enhance \r\nits effectiveness and legitimacy and the implementation \r\nof its decisions. \r\n The L.69 group is committed to playing its part in \r\nensuring that comprehensive reform of the Security \r\nCouncil is not left to future generations. We must work \r\ntogether to realize a reformed, more representative and \r\nmore accountable Security Council, in order to ensure \r\nthat future generations are able to live in a safer and \r\nmore secure world. \r\n Mr. Motanyane (Lesotho): I thank the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of the United Kingdom, in his capacity \r\nas the President of the Security Council for the month \r\nof November, for presenting the report of the Council \r\n(A/65/2) to the General Assembly today. Our thanks \r\nalso go to Nigeria for its immense contribution to the \r\npreparation of the report before us. \r\n I would like to align myself with the statements \r\ndelivered by the Permanent Representatives of Sierra \r\nLeone and Egypt on behalf of the African Group and \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement respectively. Allow me, \r\nhowever, to add a few remarks in my national capacity. \r\n The importance of the Security Council cannot be \r\noveremphasized. It speaks to the very formation of the \r\nUnited Nations. The reasons why the United Nations \r\ncame into existence are known to all. Mankind had \r\nbeen severely marred by the scourge of war. We then \r\nresolved to: \r\n “unite our strength to maintain international \r\npeace and security, and to that end: to take \r\neffective collective measures for the prevention \r\nand removal of threats to the peace”. \r\n Naturally, therefore, it becomes clear that the \r\nresponsibility to maintain world peace reposes equally \r\non all of us. In the words of the Charter, membership in \r\nthe United Nations is open to all peace-loving States \r\nthat, in the judgement of the Organization, are able and \r\nwilling to carry out those obligations. \r\n Consequently, there can be no doubt about the \r\npossibility of any one Member State serving in any \r\nUnited Nations organ, including the Security Council. \r\nIn short, the Security Council should not be the \r\nexclusive domain of a few. The Council’s current \r\nmembership is not reflective of the geopolitical \r\nrealities of the United Nations. The time for heeding \r\nthe call for comprehensive reform of the Security \r\nCouncil is, we wish to submit, long overdue. \r\n When the United Nations was formed in 1945 by \r\nabout 50 States, all the regions of the world were \r\nrepresented. Africa, too, was represented by certain of \r\nits States that had attained independence then, namely, \r\nEgypt, Ethiopia, Liberia and others. Despite that fact, \r\nAfrica did not make it into the Council’s mainstream. \r\n Today, the membership of the United Nations has \r\nexpanded more than threefold — an important \r\nstructural change in our Organization. With the end of \r\nthe Cold War, a new situation emerged, which clearly \r\ndictates a radical and yet progressive reform of the \r\nCouncil. The Security Council has, however, remained \r\nthe same as it was some 65 years ago — a grave \r\ninjustice indeed. \r\n The reform process has been long and, to a \r\ncertain extent, wearisome. Nonetheless, we should not \r\nlose hope. It is not too late, I believe, to reverse the \r\nsituation. It is time to enter into real negotiations, and \r\nwe are looking forward to doing that. The position of \r\nAfrica is well known, and so too are the positions of \r\nother regions, groups of States and individual Member \r\nStates in the intergovernmental negotiations on the \r\nreform of the Council. \r\n Clearly, we are all in favour of a model that will \r\ngarner the widest possible support. We wish to reiterate \r\n A/65/PV.49\r\n \r\n23 10-63467 \r\n \r\nthat the reform enveloping all the five key clusters — \r\nnamely, membership categories, the veto, regional \r\nrepresentation, the size of an enlarged Council and \r\nworking methods — and the relationship between the \r\nCouncil and the General Assembly will go a long way \r\ntowards revamping and bringing legitimacy to the \r\nCouncil. Needless to say, a reformed Council should \r\naccommodate the unrepresented, underrepresented and \r\nsmall- and medium-sized States. \r\n Turning to the report of the Security Council, we \r\nnote some considerable strides made by the Council in \r\ndischarging its mandate. The agenda of the Council \r\nreflects that the Council is striving to be responsive to \r\nthe current threats to international peace and security. \r\nWe note that the Council had to deal with complex \r\nconflict situations throughout the world. However, we \r\nrealize that the Council may not, by virtue of its \r\nexclusive nature, be able to adequately and definitively \r\naddress such problems. \r\n While we note the efforts to enhance \r\ntransparency in the working methods of the Council, a \r\nlot still needs to be done. A significant number of \r\nCouncil meetings are still held in camera. Lack of \r\nadequate consultations between the Council and the \r\nGeneral Assembly remain a cause for concern. The \r\nrules of procedure of the Council remain provisional. \r\nMoreover, it is our view that it would be desirable for \r\nthe report of the Council to be more detailed and \r\nanalytical on the question of how its efforts impact on \r\npeace processes in conflict areas, whether there is \r\nvariance in the level of compliance with its directives \r\nor resolutions, what the cause of that is and how the \r\nCouncil intends to solve that problem. \r\n I would like to conclude by reiterating that the \r\nonus is on us, as a collective, to unite our forces for a \r\ncommon good — that is, the comprehensive reform of \r\nthe Security Council. The ideals of our founding \r\nfathers enjoin all of us to take decisive and inspiring \r\nsteps to reshape the configuration of the Council. \r\nWhatever the dimensions of the problem may be, we \r\nmust seek solace in the saying that, where there is a \r\nwill, there is a way. If, indeed, a robust Security \r\nCouncil is the desire of all of us, let us run and finish \r\nthe race. As we do so, let us ensure that none of us is \r\nleft by the wayside. \r\n Mr. Ulibarri (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nCosta Rica welcomes the United Kingdom’s \r\npresentation of the annual report of the Security \r\nCouncil to the General Assembly (A/65/2) and is \r\npleased that the President of the Assembly has \r\nconvened this debate on the reform of that organ. \r\n We align ourselves with the statement made by \r\nthe Permanent Representative of Switzerland on behalf \r\nof the group of five small countries, of which we are a \r\nmember. We support many remarks made by the \r\nPermanent Representative of Italy, coordinator of the \r\nUniting for Consensus group, and by other \r\nrepresentatives of States members of that group, to \r\nwhich we also belong. \r\n This debate is an excellent opportunity to reflect \r\nupon and make progress on the four central elements \r\nthat should guide the process of Security Council \r\nreform. I am referring to increasing its efficiency, \r\nstrengthening its transparency, improving its \r\nrepresentativeness and consolidating its legitimacy. All \r\nof this needs to be done in order to bolster the role of \r\nthe United Nations, and that of the Security Council in \r\nparticular, in global governance. \r\n To that end, Costa Rica believes that we need to \r\nmove forward in two crucial areas. The first is that of \r\nensuring an appropriate balance of powers and more \r\nvigorous interaction between the General Assembly \r\nand the Security Council. The second is that of \r\ndeveloping a comprehensive reform process that \r\naddresses not only the composition of the Council, but \r\nalso its working methods more broadly. \r\n Two years ago, on an occasion such as this, my \r\ndelegation expressed that, for Costa Rica, the \r\nintroduction of the annual report of the Security \r\nCouncil before the General Assembly “should not be a \r\nmere exercise of rhetoric, nor should it become a mere \r\nstatement of facts” (A/63/PV.53, p. 6). The introduction \r\nof the report should lead to a more analytical and \r\ninteractive engagement that looks not only to the past \r\nbut also towards the future. Both the retrospective and \r\nthe forward-looking analyses require us to do more \r\nthan simply give an inventory. \r\n Costa Rice reiterates the need for the Council to \r\nsubmit to the General Assembly, in addition to its \r\nannual report, special reports pursuant to Articles 14 \r\nand 15 of the Charter. Such reports are especially \r\nimportant with respect to the establishment of new \r\npeacekeeping operations, the substantive modification \r\nor termination of mandates, or the imposition of a \r\nsanctions regime or other coercive measures. \r\nA/65/PV.49  \r\n \r\n10-63467 24 \r\n \r\n Furthermore, my country, as a member of the \r\nsmall five, again invites and encourages members of \r\nthe Security Council to hold an informal, inclusive and \r\ninteractive debate with all Member States during the \r\ninitial stage of the drafting of the report. In this regard, \r\nwe appreciate Nigeria’s efforts and openness to \r\ndialogue with Member States during the preparation of \r\nthe report presented today. \r\n However, such opportunities for openness and \r\ninteraction need to become more common and more \r\nin-depth. My country knows that this is possible. For \r\nexample, when we held the presidency of the Council \r\nin November 2008 and it fell to us to present the \r\nannual report for the year ending 31 July 2008, my \r\ndelegation went beyond a simple description of the \r\ncontents of the report, the resolutions and presidential \r\nstatements adopted, and the meetings held. Costa Rica \r\nintroduced a substantive innovation by speaking in its \r\nnational capacity on the report being presented. \r\n That innovation was part of our efforts to \r\nimprove the working methods of the Council. In our \r\nview, the presentation of the annual report should give \r\nan overview that evaluates the effectiveness of the \r\nmeasures adopted by the Council and the positions of \r\nits members at the time of adoption. Ultimately, it \r\nshould be an opportunity to review the action taken by \r\nthe Council, as has been done this year in the chapter \r\non the Sudan. \r\n With regard to agenda item 119 on Security \r\nCouncil reform, Costa Rica wishes to acknowledge the \r\ninterest and resolve of the President of the General \r\nAssembly to move forward on this crucial issue, and \r\nexpresses its satisfaction that Ambassador Tanin will \r\ncontinue to lead the process. Reform needs to be \r\nundertaken comprehensively and with flexibility, \r\npragmatism and vision, without losing sight of the \r\noverarching goals we seek to achieve, which I have \r\nalready mentioned. \r\n As part of this process, we commend the holding \r\nof an open debate on working methods in April this \r\nyear (see S/PV.6300), which led to the revision of \r\npresidential note S/2006/507. We also commend the \r\nwork of the Informal Working Group on \r\nDocumentation and Other Procedural Questions, \r\nchaired by Japan. However, we regret, as was stated by \r\nthe representative of Switzerland on behalf of the small \r\nfive, that no chapter on implementation mechanisms \r\nwas included. \r\n We also welcome the increase in the number of \r\nopen debates held by each of the monthly presidencies \r\nof the Council, the inclusion of a chapter on working \r\nmethods in the report, and the changes — announced \r\nlast week by the United Kingdom at the informal \r\nmeeting it held as President of the Council with \r\nmembers of the Assembly — to make debates less rigid \r\nand more streamlined. We support the British proposal \r\nto organize an exchange of ideas with the Department \r\nfor Political Affairs and to make Council consultations \r\nmore spontaneous, productive and real-time. Costa \r\nRice urges future Council Presidents to follow this \r\nexample. \r\n For Costa Rica, the forthcoming negotiations will \r\nbe key for hearing and weighing up arguments, and \r\narriving at the best results possible, ideally by \r\nconsensus. The challenge before us — of reforming our \r\nbodies and, at the same time, our Organization so that \r\nit remains the political axis of global governance — is \r\na stirring one from which we must not shy away. \r\n Ms. Martina (Ukraine): At the outset, let me \r\nexpress my gratitude to the President of the Security \r\nCouncil for the month of November, the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of the United Kingdom, for his \r\nintroduction of the annual report of the Security \r\nCouncil to the General Assembly (A/65/2). \r\n Ukraine has always been an advocate of a strong \r\nUnited Nations, with the Security Council as its \r\nprincipal organ entrusted with the primary \r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security. We therefore welcome new \r\ninitiatives and developments, especially those \r\nconceived through creative, out-of-the-box thinking \r\naimed at achieving this objective. \r\n My country considers preventive diplomacy to be \r\nan indispensable yet often overlooked instrument in the \r\nSecurity Council’s toolkit. My delegation hopes that \r\nthe horizon-scanning exercise introduced earlier this \r\nmonth will help dust off this tool so as to shift the \r\nCouncil’s focus from conflict management to conflict \r\nprevention. We would like to hear more about the first \r\nscanning session, as well as whether it will become an \r\nestablished Council practice from now on. \r\n The period under review was marked by an ever \r\nstronger thematic thrust to the Council’s agenda. This \r\ntendency, in our view, bodes well for the aim of a \r\nvibrant United Nations by capturing the most \r\nchallenging and far-reaching trends in international \r\n A/65/PV.49\r\n \r\n25 10-63467 \r\n \r\nrelations and bringing them to the Security Council \r\nChamber. If there is to be a shortlist of topics that fall \r\nunder the thematic category, we would like to see the \r\ntraditional issue of United Nations peacekeeping and \r\nthe rather recent addition to the Council’s agenda of \r\nmaritime piracy at the top of that list. \r\n At the same time, we must be cautious not to \r\noverburden the Security Council with matters of a \r\ncross-cutting nature, which ought to be tackled with \r\nadded value in other United Nations forums. Here, the \r\nmain criteria should be the respective prerogatives and \r\ncomparative advantages of the various United Nations \r\nbodies, primarily the Security Council and General \r\nAssembly. \r\n With regard to United Nations peacekeeping, we \r\nare encouraged by its constant presence on the \r\nCouncil’s radar screen throughout the year, with this \r\nmonth being no exception. My delegation also takes \r\npositive note of some proactive procedural innovations, \r\nsuch as videoconferencing with field commanders. Yet \r\nsome troop-contributing countries (TCCs), especially \r\nthose which are middle-ranked, may notice that the \r\nparticipation of TCCs in these debates or consultations \r\nis either statistical or confined to the top five, top 10, \r\ntop 12 or other “top something” format. As \r\npeacekeeping is rightly said to be a global partnership, \r\nit is essential for the Council to expand its outreach \r\nand give TCCs a stronger voice in decision-making \r\nprocesses relating to peacekeeping operations. \r\n Much of what has been achieved by the Security \r\nCouncil can be attributed to the input of its rotating \r\nmembers. We believe that, with the strong and unique \r\ncomposition of the Council, the next few years will \r\npresent an excellent opportunity to look into the most \r\neffective ways of channelling and maximizing the \r\nbenefits of the contributions of non-permanent \r\nmembers. My delegation welcomes the newly elected \r\nmembers of the Council and looks forward to progress \r\nin this important area. Ukraine, for its part, stands \r\nready to contribute to this process both outside of the \r\nCouncil, by sharing innovative ideas and relevant \r\nexperience, and as a prospective member, should it be \r\nelected for the 2016-2017 term. \r\n In the meantime, we would like to recall the \r\npractical suggestion that the valuable but very much ad \r\nhoc practice by which the regional groups are briefed \r\nmonthly by the non-permanent members they delegate \r\nto the Council be formalized. This would provide \r\ngreater insight into the Council’s daily business, the \r\nneed for which is widely agreed upon by non-members. \r\n In principle, we see no obstacles preventing the \r\npermanent members from engaging in such outreach as \r\nwell, so as to share the benefits of their uninterrupted \r\ninstitutional memory. In this case, occasional \r\nambassadorial exchanges might be complemented by \r\nmore regular — at least monthly — interactions at the \r\nexpert level. \r\n I am pleased to note the progress that has been \r\nachieved this year in our collective undertaking \r\ntowards the comprehensive reform of the Security \r\nCouncil. I am referring to the creation of a compilation \r\ndocument which gave shape to the structure of our \r\nongoing intergovernmental negotiation process. The \r\nnegotiation text, which was welcomed and supported \r\nby Member States in consensus, reflects a general \r\ndesire to move forward. We encourage the \r\noverwhelming resolve of Member States to continue \r\nalong the path of text-based negotiation and call on the \r\nchairman, Ambassador Tanin, to prepare a new revision \r\nof the text that better reflects the possible areas of \r\nconvergence and reduces obvious overlaps in the \r\npositions of Member States. \r\n Ukraine considers both directions of reform — \r\nenlargement of the Security Council and improvement \r\nof its working methods — to be priorities. Achieving \r\nprogress in at least one of these spheres will favour our \r\nlong-term interests. \r\n We support the increased representation in that \r\nbody of developing countries from Africa, Asia, Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean. We also believe that an \r\noverall enhancement of the composition of the Security \r\nCouncil should be based on the existing regional \r\napproach. Ukraine is open to discussing all possible \r\noptions and new creative approaches to Security \r\nCouncil reform. Still, our standpoint remains \r\nimmutable: any increase in the non-permanent \r\nmembership of the Security Council should ensure an \r\nenhanced representation of the Group of Eastern \r\nEuropean States by the allocation of at least one \r\nadditional non-permanent seat. In this regard, we insist \r\non the preservation of the full version of the relevant \r\nitem in the negotiation text as an inseparable part of \r\nthe Eastern European Group’s position in the \r\nnegotiations going forward. \r\n Ukraine remains committed to engaging actively \r\nand constructively in an open, transparent, inclusive \r\nA/65/PV.49  \r\n \r\n10-63467 26 \r\n \r\nand comprehensive Security Council reform process \r\nwith a view to achieving a solution that can garner the \r\nwidest possible political acceptance of Member States. \r\n Mr. Tladi (South Africa): At the outset, allow me \r\nto associate myself with the statements delivered by \r\nthe Ambassadors of Egypt and Sierra Leone on behalf \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement and Group of African \r\nStates, respectively. We also wish to thank the \r\nPermanent Representative of Jamaica for his statement \r\non behalf of the L.69 Group. \r\n We thank the President of the Security Council \r\nfor the report (A/65/2) outlining the activities relating \r\nto all questions considered by the Security Council \r\nunder its mandate for the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security. \r\n My delegation welcomes with appreciation \r\nnotable improvements in the working methods of the \r\nSecurity Council. These include meetings with troop-\r\ncontributing countries ahead of Council consultations, \r\nregular briefings by envoys of the African Union and \r\nby the chairs of the various country-specific \r\nconfigurations of the Peacebuilding Commission. \r\nRegular field missions of the Security Council to \r\ncountries on its agenda and the outreach of the \r\nWorking Group on Peacekeeping Operations to troop-\r\ncontributing countries are encouraging developments \r\nthat should be further strengthened and enhanced. \r\nAdditionally, an increasing number of formal meetings \r\nwere held in public, providing greater transparency to \r\nthe Council’s work. \r\n Since the Security Council is mandated under \r\nArticle 24 of the Charter to act on behalf of the entire \r\nmembership of the United Nations in the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security, South Africa \r\ncontinues to call for greater engagement with non-\r\nmembers of the Security Council, especially those that \r\nare directly affected by or involved in specific conflict. \r\nWe are therefore especially pleased to see that \r\ndocument S/2010/507 commits the President of the \r\nSecurity Council to provide \r\n “substantive and detailed briefings to Member \r\nStates in a timely manner” and that these \r\nbriefings should take place “shortly after informal \r\nconsultations of the whole” (S/2010/507, annex, \r\npara. 3). \r\n Our delegation views this as a positive and \r\nconcrete commitment by the Security Council to be \r\nmore transparent in the execution of its mandate, and \r\nwe encourage the general membership to take full \r\nadvantage of these consultations. \r\n We are also satisfied with the informal and \r\ninnovative measures adopted by the Security Council \r\nover the past few years to engage with relevant parties \r\nto conflict situations in an interactive manner, and we \r\nsupport the further development of these practices. The \r\nSecurity Council must adopt creative and flexible \r\npractices if it is to be well informed about developing \r\nsecurity situations and efficient in its decision-making \r\nprocesses. This will allow the Council to choose more \r\nappropriate responses from the range of tools at its \r\ndisposal, as mandated by the Charter. \r\n The Security Council remains the primary global \r\nbody tasked with the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security. In fulfilling this Charter mandate, \r\nthe Council cannot abdicate this role to smaller contact \r\ngroups that are unaccountable to the wider United \r\nNations membership. Any action related to \r\ninternational peace and security should be addressed by \r\nthe Council as a whole. \r\n Additionally, the Council cannot shirk its \r\nresponsibility by failing to address long-standing \r\nconflicts, such as that in the Middle East and the \r\nsituation in Western Sahara. These conflicts are being \r\naddressed by the Council regularly without any \r\nmeaningful action. Lack of action by the Council on \r\nthese issues undermines its credibility. Accordingly, the \r\nSecurity Council must redouble its efforts to deal \r\nsquarely with the situation in Somalia. The general \r\npopulation in these sisterly countries deserves greater \r\nand better attention from the international community. \r\n My delegation is of the view that sustainable \r\npeace can be achieved only by addressing both the \r\nsecurity and development challenges confronting \r\ncountries afflicted by conflict. In this regard, we \r\nwelcome the increasing attention paid to thematic \r\ndiscussions on peacebuilding and the nexus between \r\npeacekeeping and peacebuilding. We reiterate our view \r\nthat peacebuilding and peacekeeping are not linear \r\nprocesses but should be carried out in an integrated \r\nmanner to ensure the sustainability of peacekeeping \r\nefforts. \r\n We also welcome other thematic debates, \r\nincluding on the protection of civilians and sexual \r\nviolence against women in armed conflict. The United \r\nNations should be at the forefront on the issue of the \r\n A/65/PV.49\r\n \r\n27 10-63467 \r\n \r\nprotection of civilians, especially women and children \r\nin conflicts, lest it lose its credibility in the eyes of \r\nthose vulnerable groups. \r\n South Africa further welcomes the increased \r\ncooperation between the Security Council and the \r\nPeace and Security Council of the African Union. The \r\nestablishment of the enhanced United Nations Office to \r\nthe African Union in Addis Ababa is a positive step \r\ntowards creating greater synergy between the Security \r\nCouncil and the Peace and Security Council. \r\nFurthermore, the establishment of a joint task force to \r\nfurther elaborate strategic and operational issues \r\nbetween the two secretariats is welcomed. \r\n Despite these very positive developments, South \r\nAfrica maintains the view that more needs to be done \r\nin terms of ensuring flexible and predictable financing \r\nfor peacekeeping operations undertaken by the African \r\nUnion on behalf of the international community. \r\n The reform of the Security Council remains a top \r\npriority. We believe that the membership should rally \r\ntowards making definitive progress during the sixty-\r\nfifth session of the General Assembly and achieving \r\ntangible outcomes. \r\n We welcome the reappointment of Ambassador \r\nTanin as facilitator of the reform process, and we \r\nencourage him to persist in his intention to structure \r\nconcrete, text-based negotiations around the five key \r\nissues, during which members will be encouraged to \r\nundertake more informal drafting exercises, as he \r\nproclaimed in the last round. While the last rounds \r\nregistered limited progress, we believe that important \r\nand irreversible strides have been made to place us \r\nfirmly on a steady course towards text-based \r\nnegotiations. There is no going back into the open-\r\nended working group mode of endless consultations. \r\nThe time for restating and rehashing well-known \r\npositions is now truly over. Now is the time for \r\nmeaningful give-and-take negotiations, with a firm \r\nview to concluding them and achieve the vision of our \r\nleaders, as contained in the 2005 World Summit \r\nOutcome document (resolution 60/1). \r\n For this to happen, we believe that there are three \r\nconditions that must be met. First, we require a \r\nstreamlined text that identifies, or at least begins to \r\nidentify, areas of convergence. We believe that the first \r\nstep in preparing such a text should be the \r\nidentification and deletion of repetition and \r\nredundancies, which are an unfortunate characteristic \r\nof the current text. Secondly, we need to identify and \r\ndiscard those proposals that offer no prospect of \r\nproviding an outcome. And finally, we need to identify \r\nand consolidate those proposals that offer the best \r\nprospect for providing a solution. \r\n We remain firm in our view that the outcome of \r\nthe process as outlined above would lead us to produce \r\na text with real options as requested by an \r\noverwhelming majority of the membership of the \r\nUnited Nations in their letter of 23 December 2009. It \r\nis our firm view that progress could be achieved based \r\non a convergence of views that fundamental reforms \r\nwould require the expansion of the Security Council in \r\nboth categories, while building on the convergence of \r\nviews on working methods and on the relationship \r\nbetween the General Assembly and the Security \r\nCouncil. Similarly, there is general support for \r\nincreasing the size of the Council. \r\n In conclusion, my delegation stands ready to \r\ncontinue to participate in the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, which should lead to a transformed, \r\ndemocratic, representative, accountable and more \r\ncredible Security Council. With the necessary political \r\nwill, the sixty-fifth session could deliver on this vision. \r\n Mr. Husain (Canada): I thank the President of \r\nthe General Assembly for having convened this \r\nimportant meeting. I also thank the President of the \r\nSecurity Council for having presented the annual report \r\nof the Security Council (A/65/2). \r\n The report makes it clear that a wide variety of \r\ncomplex and important issues, both geographic and \r\nthematic, that continue to be of concern and relevance \r\nto the general membership of the United Nations \r\nremain on the Council’s agenda. Canada welcomes the \r\nopportunity to share its views on these issues, as well \r\nas on discussions regarding Security Council reform. \r\n The past year witnessed a number of critical \r\nissues that required urgent action by the Council. Only \r\n10 months ago, a devastating earthquake hit Haiti, \r\ngravely affecting the people and the United Nations \r\nStabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). The scale \r\nof the destruction required the international community \r\nto come together to bring relief and aid in \r\nreconstruction as quickly as possible. The Council \r\nplayed its part by ensuring that MINUSTAH was \r\nsufficiently bolstered to provide security and assistance \r\nto the Haitian Government in the immediate aftermath. \r\nMuch work remains to be done, however, and Canada \r\nA/65/PV.49  \r\n \r\n10-63467 28 \r\n \r\nencourages the Council and the broader international \r\ncommunity to continue providing much-needed support \r\nto the people of Haiti. \r\n Canada welcomes the information provided in the \r\nreport on the Council’s activities with respect to other \r\ncritical geographic areas, including the situations in \r\nAfghanistan and the Middle East, and peace operations \r\nin a number of African countries such as the Sudan, \r\nSomalia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. \r\n The report of the Council also outlines the \r\nprogress made in consulting troop-contributing \r\ncountries (TCCs) and police-contributing countries \r\n(PCCs). Canada strongly supports this outreach to \r\nTCCs and PCCs, as effective and timely consultations \r\nare essential in order to broaden support for \r\npeacekeeping operations. \r\n Given the importance of these operations, Canada \r\nhosted a series of informal discussions on different \r\naspects of peace operations. Canada urges the Council \r\nto continue to enhance its consultations, both on \r\nspecific mandates, as well as on broader thematic \r\npeacekeeping issues, with the broader United Nations \r\ncommunity. Canada will continue to promote such \r\ndialogue, in particular in its role as chair of the \r\nWorking Group of the Special Committee on \r\nPeacekeeping Operations. \r\n The past year has also been important with \r\nrespect to peacebuilding. Canada welcomes the \r\nincreased interaction between the Council and the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission (PBC). As Chair of the \r\nSierra Leone configuration, Canada has appreciated the \r\nmutually reinforcing role that the Council and the PBC \r\ncan play in advancing peacebuilding in a post-conflict \r\ncountry. The lessons learned to date with respect to \r\npeacebuilding will be all the more relevant as more \r\ncountries come on to the PBC agenda. I would \r\ntherefore encourage the Council to engage even further \r\nwith the Peacebuilding Commission in the year to \r\ncome. \r\n Canada welcomes the progress made in \r\nimproving the working methods of the Council, \r\nincluding the revision of presidential note S/2006/507. \r\nHowever, considerable work is still required to \r\nenhance the transparency of the Council. For example,  \r\n \r\nwhile the report of the Security Council details the \r\nscope of the actions taken by the Council, it still falls \r\nshort of providing analysis of how and why those \r\ndecisions were made. Although producing such a report \r\nmay be difficult, it would be a tangible step towards \r\nimproving both the transparency and accountability of \r\nthe Security Council to the broader membership. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\n Canada’s position on Security Council reform is \r\nwell known. My country strongly believes that \r\ndemocratic, accountable and transparent reform \r\nrequires an increase in the number of elected, \r\nnon-permanent members. An expansion in the number \r\nof elected members would allow for a better \r\nrepresentation of all the world’s regions — most \r\nespecially those that have long been underrepresented, \r\nsuch as Africa — and would afford Member States \r\ngreater opportunities to serve on the Council at regular \r\nintervals. \r\n Yet, even with an increased number of seats, the \r\nSecurity Council must remain of a reasonable size that \r\nwould allow it to take swift and effective action. In \r\naddition, serious consideration needs to be given to \r\nimproving its working methods and to placing some \r\nrestrictions on the use of the veto, in particular on \r\nissues related to crimes against humanity, war crimes \r\nor genocide. \r\n At the same time, Canada recognizes that neither \r\nits position nor any other traditional position enjoys the \r\nvery broad support of the Assembly that will be \r\nrequired for such an amendment, and it is unlikely that \r\nthey will in the near future. For that reason, Canada \r\nurges all States to look towards potential compromises. \r\nFor example, in our country’s view, the intermediate \r\noption put forward by Colombia and Italy attempts to \r\nbridge the various positions and therefore may form \r\nthe basis of consensus. \r\n There may be other approaches that are possible \r\nas well. Canada remains open to considering and \r\ndiscussing them, and urges all parties to the \r\nnegotiations to work together to find a compromise \r\nsolution that is in the clear interest of all States \r\nMembers of the United Nations. \r\n  The meeting rose at 6.05 p.m. \r\n \r\n \r\n"
